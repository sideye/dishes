Communication was excellent, and he answered all our questions in a very timely manner. We had an excellent tasting and got to try everything on the menu before deciding on choosing them for our caterer. They were so  helpful in making our decisions for our wedding menu. The overall price was fairly reasonable compared to some of the other popular SF trucks that we looked at. The truck showed up in a timely manner for setup and was able to serve all 90 or so guests within the first hour of service (2 hours total) with people going back for seconds (and maybe more). I was grateful that they were able to modify the coca-cola braised pork to be gluten free on a bed of greens (without the buns) for our gf friends, and even were able to make a veggie-only medley on a steamed bun for our vegan friend (the tofu is actually battered in buttermilk -so delicious, but not vegan). Service was very friendly, and the red truck was clean and quite a nice addition to our wedding. \n\nWe were very  pleased to have The Chairman Truck cater our wedding, and would do it again in a heartbeat.", "author": "Amanda F."}

Yesterday (Tuesday) night, I saw it outside of Daly City's Serramonte Shopping Center while passing by and was excited to get some of that good stuff!\n\nI decided to split a pork belly baked bun and a coca-cola braised pork steamed bun with another. The truck seemed to have quite a good amount of business and I often hear hype about this truck so I was excited to dig in. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed by what I was given especially since I probably overhyped it for myself. The baked bun was extraordinarily buttery and the pork belly was a bit dry. The daikon radishes added a nice sweet and sour taste to it, but I found it to be rather average overall. For the steamed bun, I found the bread to be slightly tough as if it had been sitting out for a while. The meat was certainly not bad though as I enjoyed the fatty bits here and there.\n\nOverall, I ended up finding The Chairman to be all around not too bad, but nothing to get super hype about. I will certainly try it out again sometime though as I do like their creative approaches in what they serve and I find myself it situations where I would like a small and simple $4 steamed bun.", "author": "Joshua M."}

The Chairman's menu can be described as modern Taiwanese cuisine. It mainly consists of baked or steams buns with a choice of protien and bowls with rice/noodles along with a choice of protein.

I generally do not like vegetarian sandwiches but I managed to put down the the miso cured tofu bun effortless. The tofu patty had a terrific outside sear which gave it a nice crunch. The sandwich itself was minimalist with only some crispy choy-sum along with the tofu that worked very well together.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-03", "description": "I like buns... white buns... more specifically fluffy, steamed, white buns. I think they would taste good with just about any type of filling. I thought the buns were a little pricey. I wanted to hit up an Asian grocer and buy some steamed buns from the frozen aisle, heat them up, and stuff them. Well, that never happened. Too many people raved about these buns, so curiosity won me over. Everyone was right. They are good. \nThey serve steamed buns (~$4) and baked buns (~$7). It's on the pricey side for a bao, but the steamed bun trend is still going strong.\nThe aforementioned steamed buns are a soft, mildly sweet, bleached white color. The baked buns are the larger, brown ones. They're also good, but I'm not as fond of the sticky sugary glaze, so I stick to the steamed ones.\n\nTender Pork Belly - red miso glaze, turmeric pickled daikon, green shiso:\nEasily my favorite of the bunch. It's not red cooked pork, but the fatty pork belly nestled in a soft white bun is winner. The acidity of the pickled daikon helps cut through some of the richness and adds flavor, but sometimes they top the buns with so much daikon, the tart flavor overpowers the pork belly.\n\nCoca Cola Braised Pork - savory cabbage, preserved mustard seeds, garlic mayo:\nNot bad for braised pork. The cabbage was rather bland, and not too satisfying having a mouthful of shredded cabbage.\n\nSpicy Chicken - toasted sesame puree, panchan pickled carrots & cucumber, cilantro:\nPretty tasty! Good balance of flavors, mildly spicy & tart. & Good chicken\n\nMiso Cured Tofu - tofu, mayo, baby choy-sum:\nNot surprisingly, my least favorite of the bunch. It was okay, but I thought I would like it better, since I usually like tofu. It was pretty bland. The mayo also didn't do much to bring a satisfying factor for a carb-on-carb combination.\n\nOverall, I approve! They're more of a snack. If I wanted these things to fill me up, I'd need about 4 steamed buns.\n\n&...storytime...\nSeveral years ago, there was a legal battle over the 'Chairman Bao' name. A popular east coast steamed bun joint already laid claim to 'Chairman Bao' for his number-one selling gua bao. I didn't understand why such a name was coveted. An innocuous pun that alludes to controversial totalitarian rule doesn't seem like it would help sell steamed buns. Surely these business owners should be able to come up with something more clever and more catchy. I wasn't too interested in this East vs West Coast conflict, but the East won - with unnecessary belligerent words. The Chairman Truck still draws long lines, regardless of any name change. I'm sure most people didn't even notice these red panda themed trucks had dropped the 'Bao' in the name.", "author": "Joy W."}

The Chairman is definitely one of the more hyped up food trucks in the area, and if you ever see a Chairman line during Off the Grid on a Friday night, it's a total nightmare. I think I once waited over half an hour to get my order in. The good thing is that once your order is in, they assemble the food pretty quickly and you get the order almost instantaneously. It's good, but I'd personally prefer to attend one of their locations with no wait (e.g. went to The Chairman yesterday at Off the Grid Cupertino -- didn't wait, and got my food in less than a minute, it was great). \n\nI've tried the tender pork belly and the coca cola braised pork. I'm at an odd position where I love the tender pork belly itself, but don't super love the slaw that comes with it, and I like the daikon on the braised pork but not so much the pork -- so my actual dream would be to have the tender pork belly with the daikon.\n\nThat being said, the Chairman basically specializes in steamed buns with a type of meat sandwiched in the middle. Prices are fairly good -- $3.75 for one which I guess is moderately expensive, but that's just how much the landscape actually costs these days. I recommend them steamed -- I've tried their baked buns, but found them to be a little on the disappointing side. It kind of just tasted like the meat in a brioche bun... underwhelming indeed. Better to just go steamed. Quality is good -- it's pretty delicious and they can also be pretty filling as well. \n\ntldr; one of my favorite food trucks! not necessarily worth the crazy long wait, but it's still good", "author": "Jasmine X."}

The little man knows what's up. If you (and perhaps your child in tow) are not up to tracking the whereabouts of the truck, you could always show up when Off the Grid is at Fort Mason.\n\nWhen it came to choosing the steamed or the baked bao, I opted for the buns that had a bit of a crisp to it. The baked bao was that exactly, two large breads toasted to a dainty crisp on the outside but soft and moist on the inside. Paired with the juicy pork belly, the bao never once became too dry or bland in flavor. The pork belly was marinated to perfection, a piece of meat and its fatty side that properly retained savory juices. Crisp and crunchy pickled daikon interject between the tender meat and fluffy bread to give the bao some bite (sourness and texture). I think the ratio of pickle to meat was decent, although I could have used a little less daikon. The bao was the size of a large burger, so it wasn't easily devoured in a few bites. It was messy to eat, especially when unable to get all layers of the bao with each mouthful.", "author": "Cici T."}

Literally dripping in fat, but hitting all the right tones. The spicy chicken bao was pretty damn good too, but not at ALL spicy -- needed some amping up with Sriracha (which they do have at the truck).\n\nAt $3.75 for the pork belly steamed bao, and $3.25 for the chicken it was a little on the pricey side, but the advantage of buying the smaller, steamed buns meant I could have a greater variety, and really taste the contents of the bun as opposed to the bread itself.

They rotate between locations in SF, South Bay and East Bay. Check their website to find out where they're going to be for the week.\n\nThe menu is very simple here. They have various gua baos, which are a Taiwanese sandwich with some sort of meat and/or veggie filling in a steamed or baked bun. The steamed buns ($3.75 each) are smaller and like the buns you'd get with peking duck. The baked buns ($6.75 each) are more like burger buns. They also have wonton chips on the menu.\n\nI got two steamed buns: the tender pork belly and the spicy chicken. The buns themselves are nice and fluffy and slightly sweet. The fillings tend to be a little greasy so the buns help to cut that greasiness. At $3.75 each, the buns are kind of on the pricey side, especially given the size. They aren't super filling, so unless you get many buns, they make more for a snack or light lunch. Two buns was definitely just a snack for me, and quite a pricey snack if it weren't free that day. But they're super yummy!\n\n==========================\n\n-TENDER PORK BELLY - 4.5/5 \n(with tumeric pickled daikon + green shiso)\nThe truck is known mostly for its pork belly bun. And true to its name, the pork is super tender and moist, but also VERY fatty. I'm not a huge fan of fatty pork belly, so I wasn't too fond of the cut of meat, but I still liked the bun overall. The skin on the pork belly is crispy but not overly crunchy, and the pickled daikon added some crunch and texture to tender pork as well as a nice tangyness to the sweet marinade of the pork. Definitely recommend, unless you really don't like fatty pork belly.\n\n-SPICY CHICKEN - 5/5\n(with toasted sesame puree, pickled carrots/cucumber + cilantro)\nThere was a lot going on in this bun flavorwise - spicy from the chicken, creamy and nutty from the sesame puree and tangy from the pickled veggies - but I really liked the combination of flavors. I only wish the chicken were spicier. Unless you have a really low tolerance to spiciness, this is a must try!", "author": "Jessie L."}

And then I promptly went to eat more Asian food after this, because I was still hungry.\n\nOf the two, I liked the pork belly better. It's more traditional in the baos, after all, adding a more sweet, succulent taste to complement the bread.

Hmm...\n\nThe case for 5-Stars:  Man, the food is tasty.  This is one of a handful of food trucks that I go to regularly.  The menu is incredibly simple - four types of Bao, each coming in two versions:  Baked or steamed.  The offerings are great.  Two of the buns have pork - one with the most delicious Coca-Cola braised pork, the other with rich and well-cooked pork belly.  There is also a chicken option with tender and flavorful chicken, and a terrific tofu bao.  All are finished with sauces that compliment the other ingredients perfectly.  Also, as a popular food truck goes, the lines move fast, and you won't get a Sisig-esque lunchbreak killer.\n\nThe case for 4-Stars:  $$$.  I just never feel like the dollar goes quite far enough here.  Bao are $3.25 or $3.75 for steamed - upwards of $6 for baked.  This is not a bad-deal, per se.  It's just not a great deal.  And, three steamed bao are tasty, but if you were starving, three wouldn't do the trick.  Additionally, I eat my lunch late.  Usually after 1pm or 1:30pm.  On a few occasions they've been out of things - sometime one of the types of bao (which is tough, when there are only four options to begin with), sometimes just a single ingredient.  Yesterday, no sesame puree sauce for my chicken.  These aren't killers.  Just, not 5-star traits.\n\nTips:\n1.  Go with the steamed bao.  One of the great qualities of this place is that you can try a few different flavors in a single visit.  While some of the bao are better than others, it's good to try a few things.\n2.  The braised pork is the best.  Mmm mmm...  The meat is extremely tender and has a great flavor.  The toppings are savory cabbage and a mustard-cream sauce.  \n3.  If you like spicy food, soup-up #2 with a little Sirancha.  It compliments the flavors nicely.\n4.  Even if you don't normally dig pork-belly, it's worth trying theirs.  It's rich and flavorful, and as tricky as prok-belly can be to do well, it's always cooked correctly here in my experience.\n5.

I recently moved to the area, so this was definitely a good opportunity for me to venture out into the community and see what Oakland has to offer.

Okay, pharmacy puns aside, let me get to the review.\n\nI'm not much of a food truck fan, which often seems like hipsterfied fabricated street food, often insidiously draining your wallet.  However, Chairman Bao really lives up to the hype.  \n\nIt is a fine art of fusion, unlike the slackers who add kimchi to something American and think they've pulled off something worthy for a foodie.  Well, THIS foodie is rarely impressed by fusion, and the Chairman truck is one of them.  They use traditional Chinese peking duck buns as the vehicle for a filling incorporating Asian ingredients with modern flavor profiles.\n\nThey have steamed and baked buns; the baked buns were uncomfortably similar to burgers, and the steamed buns are smaller so you could try more different ones (yes I shamelessly got 3, best decision ever):\n\nTender Pork Belly with Turmeric Pickled Daikon & Green Shiso, $3.75: Not that pork belly ever disappoints, but this surpasses fried chicken in being a comfort food.  It's indeed tender, and when combined with tangy daikon and pungent shiso, it is just an amazing flavor explosion (and the explosiveness is appropriately diffused by the soft white bun).  \n\nSpicy Chicken with Toasted Sesame Pur\u00e9e, Pickled Carrots-Cucumber & Cilantro, $3.75: It's actually spicy o.O Again, the veggies and seasoning complemented it very well.  I would just suggest eating this before the tofu because it becomes quite comforting after the spiciness.\n\nCrispy Miso Cured Tofu with Garlic-Tofu Mayo & Baby Choy Sum, $3.25: I got this to feel like I'm being healthy, but it was actually very tasty as well.  The texture of the tofu is wonderfully soft on the inside (almost like a scramble), with a crispy outer layer marinated in miso.  There is also copious amounts of choy sum (it's almost like a salad), and it all goes so well together that it makes me wonder why miso tofu choy sum isn't already a Chinese dish.\n\nCoca-cola Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage & Yellow Mustard Seeds, $3.75: This is quite popular but personally I liked the other ones better.  I found the mustard seed cabbage to be somewhat bitter, and the tangle of endives-textured cabbage was a little difficult to eat.  Not bad, obviously, because there's pork belly but I would recommend the other ones.\n\nThey also have a duck one, but that's too fancy for me... it's also pricier and I already get my fix of duck in steam buns at Chinese restaurants.   (Oldschool but way more affordable)\n\nService and ambiance?  Meh it's a food truck... of course they're going to be friendly, of course you're going to admire--and perhaps Instagram-- the colorful truck, of course it's going to have a cute name (though this name is pretty darn cute), and of course you're going to have difficulties finding a place to eat.  But I must say, the culinary finesse at Chairman has renewed my faith in food trucks, after a few other saucy/salty/dehydrating food truck excursions had dashed my hopes.\n\nThe Chairman has extraordinary culinary finesse... if only it could live up to its philosophy and widely distribute yummy steamed buns for all.

But, what makes this bun such a bada$$ is the frickin' tumeric-soy sauce-pickled daikon. Frickin' picklin'.\n\nSo, what has this experience taught me?\n\nOne, they take CC. Two, the line moves quickly. Three, I think we can all agree that bigger buns are bettah. But who really cares about the bun when you have the perfect union of pork belly and pickled daikon in front of you? Make your bun choice based on how much meat you want to eat. And THAT is a different conversation for a different day ;)", "author": "Adele F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-22", "description": "The Chairman Truck (previously known as The Chairman Bao Bun Truck) serves some delicious, mouthwatering, and flavorful meat-stuffed buns.\n\nYou can get your buns one of two ways: baked or steamed. The baked buns are nice and fluffy with a mild hint of sweetness. It's moist but doesn't get soggy with the additional ingredients inside. The steamed buns are also fluffy and delicious, but they get soggy quickly and don't hold all the ingredients as sturdily.\n\nThe most popular ingredient option seems to be the tender pork belly with pickled daikon and green shiso. The pork belly is SO GOOD! The edges are slightly crispy, but the fatty meat as a whole is very flavorful, moist, tender, and smokey. The pickled daikon is mildly acidic and has a nice crunch, complimenting the pork belly's flavor and textures very well. The coca cola braised pork is pretty good as well, but the shredded cabbage it's topped with leaves a very strange and bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of brussel sprouts. The spicy chicken option is somewhat misleading. It seems that the chicken would be the spicy component, but it's actually the pickled carrots and cucumbers that have quite a bit of heat. The chicken still has good smokey flavor, but it's those pickled vegetables that will surprise you.\n\nOccasionally the truck has \"Bao chips\". For $2.50, you get a generous portion of crunchy fried wonton crisps tossed with togarashi spice blend and seaweed. The wonton crisps are very crunchy, but not too oily. They're salty and slightly spicy. If you like the umami taste in Calbee's shrimp flavored chips, you'll like Chairman's Bao chips.\n\nThe amount of food you get for the price you pay at this food truck is reasonable. A single baked bao ($6.75 average) or two steamed baos ($3.75 each, average) is quite satisfying. The major downside is that the menu is very limited, so within three or four visits to The Chairman Truck, you would've tried everything. Whatever happened to their lion's head meatball and duck confit options?", "author": "Priscilla W."}

I had three flavors - pork belly, spicy chicken, and beef rib. Pork belly is clearly the winner for me without doubt. It's very flavorful, cooked with soy sauce, cooking wine and many more ingredients with love and care, sinfully tender that it could almost melt in my mouth. And it's so magical that I can't really tell the difference between lean meat and fat by tasting as the texture is almost the same - you will have extremely tender lean meat enriched by fat, and \"compact\" fat that you won't feel guilty to have. On top of it is pickled thinly-sliced radish, a great complement that brings freshness and saltiness to make the pork belly even more enjoyable. I'm usually extremely picky about animal fat in food, and for most of the time I would simply leave fat on my plate if it's too rich. But this time it totally won me over.\n\nSince the pork belly bun shines so much, it's almost unfair to write reviews for the spicy chicken and beef rib bun next to it. The texture of the chicken is good, not too well done with enough flavor. But I would expect a bit more spice. The beef rib bun is surprisingly good paired with cabbage and the bun, but of course the flavor is not as memorable as the pork belly one.\n\nGet the pork belly ones, and one piece won't be enough!", "author": "Yuhuan T."}

Initially looking for an Asian option food truck in the bay area, everyone and their mother kept suggesting them, so we decided why not?\n\nWe gave our guests the choice between Pork Belly, Braised pork butt, Tofu, and Spicy chicken steamed buns.  Each was exquisitely yummy, but the pork belly was definitely the crowd favorite.\n\nThe Chairman Truck was by far the most professional truck we worked with.  They were very prompt, straight forward with their options and pricing, communicated with us regularly, and had catered before at numerous wedding events.  This made the process extremely easy and comforting.  While they were one of the more expensive splurges of our event, they definitely lived up to the age old saying \"you get what you pay for.\"\n\nDuring the reception, everyone working the truck was also really helpful, fast, and fun.\n\nEven after the whole event, they stayed to box up all our extra buns...we over estimated the ability of our guests to stuff themselves...and they made sure we got everything before they left.\n\nIn regards to The Chairman Truck's ability to cater an event, I'd highly recommend them.

The steamed buns are tiny, so you'd probably need to order three to satisfy your hunger. The baked buns are bigger, but one will probably still not be enough.

I was wondering why this truck suddenly became The Chairman like the serene-looking but totally totalitarian panda in the logo was Sinatra or something. Truth be told, I really don't care about the political battles that caused the name change since I was excited to try the buns. Why, you may ask?\n\nWell, it's the first time I have had anything in these parts remind me of a menu item from David Chang's Momofuku operation, probably the best Southern-fried Asian fusion food I've ever had. It's obvious that's the inspiration for chef Eric Rudd's creations here since the steamed buns look like carbon copies of Chang's appetizers (see my photo from Momofuku Ssam Bar if you don't believe me - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1Ed-tb_0dBGrXfsYyehmvg?select=1fLj9Y-XQNAeEw9r9n8Chg). The truck was parked at the Chevron station next to the 17th Street Plaza where I usually see the Cr\u00e8me Brulee Truck. I got so excited I think I made a little penguin fin-clapping gesture and decided to try two of them. Hey, they're small, and I couldn't help myself.\n\nThe steamed ones sounded healthier and at $3.75 a piece, were three bucks cheaper than their baked cousins. Both were in the poufy white-clamshell buns I recall so well from Momofuku. The first was stuffed with Coca-Cola-Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage, Yellow Mustard Seeds and Kewpie Mayo. Delicious and about three bites in my famished condition. But I have to tell you my preference was the Tender Pork Belly with Tumeric-Pickled Daikon and Green Shiso (see photo). Pork belly is a can't-miss food item for me, especially when it's braised into a crispy texture making the crunch of the daikon a nice complement. I doubt if I'll ever try the spicy chicken or tofu variations because, well... what for? Pork is for the ages.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...hey, if you're going to copy anyone, copy David Chang, I say\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...gee, it's a truck, granted a cool one with a Communist panda logo\nSERVICE - 3 stars...you order, you wait, you pick it up, no big whoop\nTOTAL - 4 stars...pork belly for the proletariat...Mao would shed a tear", "author": "Ed U."}

They're not there that day. Downtown San Francisco? They're just pulling away. Today was the day.

The baked ones look like a burger, which is fine but you're here to get the best Chairman experience you can. Get the steamed.\n\nI had the spicy chicken and the pork belly and both were amazing. The chicken is not especially spicy, but more tangy and rich and flavor. The pork belly is likewise very soft and has a bold taste where you want to lick your fingers after. The pickled vegetables on top add a nice counter balance to the heavy meat so it doesn't feel as greasy as other types of street food. My friend had the tofu and was not so impressed, so if I were you I would stick to the richer meats.\n\nEnjoy! It's worth it.\n\nIf you're on Stanford campus, the Chairman comes every two weeks to the street right outside Mitchell Earth Sciences (near the big fountain outside Thornton).

I loved the tanginess of the mayo on the braised pork bao. My favorites were the pork belly and braised pork. I liked the spicy chicken but it was too spicy for me to finish a whole bao. It's really not THAT spicy but I can't take a lot of spiciness. I liked both the steamed and baked bao equally. If you're trying to decide between the two, go with the steamed bao for a smaller portion and the baked bao for a larger portion. Both are slightly sweet and soft.

Looking back, I wish we would have gotten a steamed and a baked bun so I could try the different styles but I really can't complain at all as it was so good I considered going back for another. There was a bit of a line but the wait was totally worth it! \n\nI only wish that there was a Sac truck but as there is not, I can guarantee that when in SF, I will most definitely be stopping at the Chairman!", "author": "Nicole I."}

This is currently my favorite gourmet mobile food truck in the Bay Area! Why you ask? Let me dive into several reasons why it is MY FAVORITE.\n\nA little background, The lines have always been long at Off The Grid SF and at other food truck gatherings throughout the Bay Area. I have tried to wait in those long lines but would give up after 30 minutes. Finally, at Moveable Feast San Jose a few weeks ago, I was finally able to try Chairman Bao and I was hooked. Everytime the truck makes a stop at Moveable Feast, I try to be one of the first in line to get their pillowy soft steamed buns with pork belly. \n\nThe pork belly is tender and flavorful with slices of pickled yellow daikon. A simple concoction is combined into a highly addictive and hand held bun for on-the-go goodness. These buns are portable which make them a huge winner in my book. I can eat them easily while driving or walking through Downtown San Jose or SF. I can eat at least four but I typically purchase about two so I can be able to try other things at Moveable Feast. In addition, the staff is very friendly. I have had several conversations with the owners and staff and they work very hard to pump out lots of buns without sacrificing the quality of their food.\n\nThe other bun fillings are very good as well but the pork belly takes the cake. Some other things to note, line up early because the lines for Chairman Bao can get long so either line up early or be patient. Also, Chairman Bao has just been voted as one of the Bay Area's top 5 food trucks by Zagat! Woohoo!", "author": "Danster L."}

While I LOVE their innovative spin on classic Chinese baos, I just can't justify $3.75 for their teeny tiny baos.\n\nFirst off, when I read the descriptions, I was already drooling. Pork always catches my attention so I ordered a steamed bun with pork belly and pickled daikon and another with pulled pork. I was expecting something resembling a classic bao stuffed with pork yumminess.  When I received it, I was baffled by what it was.  The baos they used are like the ones you get with peking duck, little steamed buns big enough to put in a pinch of meat and maybe a bit of veggies.  I was so disappointed, until I bit into it.  Thus began the conflict. While I was disappointed with the size and shocked by the price, the taste transported me to porcine heaven.\n\nSo, I tried Chairman Bao again, just to see if maybe I'd get over this indecisiveness.  We had the pork belly again (since I'd been dreaming of it since I had it) and the sesame chicken with scallions.  After two tries, I'm still on the fence.  \n\nI still have dreams about the pork belly which turn into nightmares of not having enough cash when I finally get to the front of the line that I've been waiting in for an hour.

That's not to say you shouldn't try all of them though. The baked buns look like burgers, with the same ingredients in it as the steamed ones. \n\nYes, it's those steamed buns like what you get at a Chinese restaurnat with your duck. But the ingredients they put in it, it's just downright clever and delicious. \n\nMY FAVORITE: braised pork steamed bun. \n2ND FAVORITE: TOFU steamed bun\n3RD FAVORITE: Pork belly daikon bun - Yes, this is the one on the 7x7, it's pickled daikon with pork belly. A winning combo, but I still prefer the first 2 yummy ones. \n4TH FAVORITE: Sesame Chicken bao - new on their menu, a bit spicy, but good flavor.\n\nThe baked buns are about ~6-7 bucks, and steamed ones around ~3-4 bucks. For one person, sure a baked bun would satisfy you for lunch, but if it was up to me, I'd get a braised pork, and a tofu veggie bun. Those are soooo good. Trust me, i know what you're thinking. You're a meat lover, so am I. But man, that tofu is fried and is meaty already and the dressing they use on the veggies is just finger lickin' good. \n\nI sound like a Chairman Bao commercial, but really I just wish they will get some trucks runnin'  on a usual basis in south bay.

My boyfriend and I first stumbled upon the Chairman Truck at Off the Grid: Fort Mason and  we were more than excited to try their pork belly bun since we heard tons of good things about them! The wait for the Chairman Truck was around 10-15 minutes, which wasn't too bad since their employees seemed super friendly and were extremely patient with each customer. I also happened to stumble upon their truck at Off the Grid: Serramonte, and they forgot one of my orders so they not only were very apologetic, but they threw in another chicken bun for free. It wasn't necessary, but was very much appreciated because it showed how awesome their customer service is! A steamed pork belly bun is $3.75 and a baked pork belly bun is around $6, I believe, so we ended up getting 2 steamed pork belly buns.\n\nSteamed Pork Belly Bun with Pickled Daikon - Steamed to perfection, the bun was very similar to a peking duck bao bun, but with pork belly and pickled daikon, which is a type of radish. It smells awful, but it is so freaking delicious and is the perfect complement to that equally perfect pork belly!\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend The Chairman truck.

While I found the Steamed Buns tasty, I thought their portions were small and overpriced which was a bit of a turn off for me.  Since I usually give places more than one try, I decided to give them another chance when they stopped by Brisbane again.  And this time I tried their Baked Bun.  It's so much more worth it than the steamed buns.\n\nThe Pulled Pork Baked Bun is huge!  Take a look at the pic (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=6YZaRgVAiw8cFE6dS8q85w), it's just as good as it looks!  Loaded with Pork, it was delicious!  Word of note, like a Burrito, after having one of these, it should keep you satisfied for a few hours.\n\nAnd because you have to order them when you visit Chairman Bao, I also ordered two Steamed Buns, one Pork Belly and one Red Sesame Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=G3ZZErMfHpLd2_TuVWyKwQ).  The Red Sesame Chicken had a nice sweet and spicy kick to them which I liked and the Pork Belly was amazing as usual.  I think I was gypped the first time I had their Steamed Buns because the ones I had this time were loaded with meat!  And yes, I had these with my Baked Bun.  I'm such a pig!!\n\nSo why the upgrade to only 4 stars and not 5?  It basically comes down to pricing.  While I believe that $6.75 for a Baked Bun is worth it, I'm still on the fence with paying $3.75 each for their Steamed Buns.

A really nice spin-off from the traditional savory steamed or baked buns, the Chairman Truck incorporates some of the more unconventional ingredients to create awesome lunch bites.

This fare is certainly not for the diet conscious, it is loaded with fatty goodness, their pork belly bun being their flagship product. I had the Coca Cola braised pork bun with savoy cabbage and yellow mustard seeds. The pork was nicely charred and had the texture and crunch of a burnt end, the cabbage and mustard seeds provided an additional crunchy kick. The real Chairman would appreciate the concept, though he'd probably want doggy or kitty in his bun (I'm kidding, I love all animals, they're all very tasty, including Snoopy and Garfield).\n\nCome here early to avoid the long lines.

However, when I was in Vegas two months ago for a Bachelorette Party, my gf told me our mutual friend took over Chairman Bao. Although hesitant, I was longing to do a re-do and last Friday's (4.8.11) OTG - Civic Center gave me the perfect opportunity to do so as the lines are much shorter. My colleagues and I got in line at around 11:35 AM (opens at 11:30 AM) with 7-8 people in front and we had our buns in tote in about 8 minutes. \n\nI got the Steamed Pork Belly Bun w/ Pickled Daikon ($3.75) and was BLOWN AWAYYYYYYY!

The pork belly was crisp and as I bit into it, all the savory juices burst into my mouth. It was JUICY, SUCCULENT and lightly drizzled with hoisin sauce for that hint of salty sweetness. The pickled daikon's acidity complemented the pork belly by helping to balance the richness of it. \n\nAfter devouring the Pork Belly Bun I wanted more and didn't even feel like eating my Katsu Curry from JapaCurry anymore. Hands down, it was the BEST pork belly and BEST rendition of a Chinese steamed bun I've ever had!!! \n\nAs soon as I got back to the office, I text my friend to let her know about my re-do of Chairman Bao and she told me our mutual friend had been braising the pork belly till 5 AM that morning--talk about dedication!

He told me that he revamped the recipes along with a new steamed bun and made sure that extra care is taken when preparing these buns which truly shows in the execution and taste of the mouth-watering bun. \n\nAs someone who is a harsh critic of Asian Fusion Fare (because flavors are often watered down), Chairman Bao's Pork Belly Bun totally WON me over!

The pork belly bun at The Chairman is my first exception. Per a Yelper's recommendation, I ordered the Baked Pork Belly bun. Absolutely fantastic! The buns help mask the taste of the fat, and instead you get the creamy-fat texture from it. Pickled radishes are also something I don't usually go for with my chopsticks, but they cut through the bun and meat to round out the sandwich nicely.\n\nWe got an order of the bao chips and my tip is: to pass the Bao chips.

I got to go during Off The Grid and they were the only trucked with a roped off line, and deservingly so. I felt so bad for JapaCurry next door, who had no line at all! Anyways, it's definitely pricey for street food, but the ingredients are solid. They didn't have the Duck Confit that day so I was a bit sad, soI opted for the Tender Pork Belly with Daikon in a steamed bun and my bf had the Rosemary Chicken in a baked bun (which was huge, kind of like a burger). Glad we tried out both types of buns; I think the baked bun is better for meats with lots of sauce (baked bun soaks it up) and the steamed bun is better for when the taste of the meat is the star. \n\nI wouldn't stray too far from the truck after you order; they may expedite your order if other people's orders contain items that are still cooking, your order was small, etc. The price does make me question if this place is worth it, so far now, I'll think of it as a treat. Definitely beats the Kogi Truck of LA-- When I was attending UCLA, there was a lot of hype around Kogi so you'd see all these people chase after it around the campus-- which was not worth it at all.

Or should I say If you don't know what traditional Gua Bao is, then your just someone who wants to be a foodie. With that being said, there's a few factors to throw in before giving an honest rating of this truck. \n\nBackground: \n-I'm motha-fa'king Taiwanese! \n-I go back to Taiwan once to twice a yr. I know what is traditional and what isn't. Street food is in my blood, my culture. \n-Let's not even think about American food prices and American hormoned filled pork! \n\nOkay, now here's the story. Put all that junk aside and eat like an American, this place is a hit. Even if your Taiwanese and you put yourself in another shoe. You think you can get better Gua Bao (or should I say Chairman Bao) from a Taiwanese restaurant in the Bay Area? I doubt it (unless you like prebraised frozen of a week fatty pork).\n\nChairman was a hit place for me. Yes, I spent 6.5 for a damn bun (made not by Chairman but from a Chinatown bun factory). Normally something like this in Taiwan nightmarket should be around $1.5 if not less and maxed at $2USD. Put aside the price, and the plane ticket, and all that jibberish that a foodie can talk about, this place is darn good. \n\nThe pork fatness wasn't overwhelming. In fact, it was just right. They added their own twist to the filling which doesn't exist in our traditional Gua Bao. I normally like to see peanut powder, cilantro, mustard greens and the nice steam bun. But here at Chairman, you have a choice between the traditional steam bun and the more American style baked bun. They didn't fill the thing with unnecessary junk that would ruin the taste. In fact, every bite was mouth watering (not from juices, but the natural aroma of the fatty pork). It tasted like the braised pork belly was done early in the morning and ready by noon time. It tasted like grandma's cooking, except mixed with their grandchildren's american twist. \n\nEven though it sounds all good, it's still not a 5 star thing. I still prefer grabbing my $1.5 bun in Taiwan when I'm back. It's not the same yah-know?", "author": "Eric Y."}

Red sesame chicken with scallion and bak choy: This is very Korean inspired because the scallion and bak choy is really one of many versions of kimchi.  I was a little confused as to whether this or #3 was the pork because they're both shredded/pulled-ish.  At first sight I could tell kochujang (red pepper paste) was the main ingredient so it might be re-creatable at home.  As for the \"red esame\" in the name, I don't know where that was.\n\n2. Crispy garlic tofu with miso greens: Almost everyone preceding us in line skipped out on this one because only freaky vegans would pick it.  But I went with my hunch and didn't regret it at all.  The flavors are really light and the tofu is a different texture but somehow, it works.  It's on the firmer side and you can definitely taste the garlic.  The greens were marinated in a way that made them really refreshing and held true to their original flavors.\n\n3. Pulled pork with pickled daikon:  A little disappointing maybe because I have daikon fairly often.  I didn't feel that the pork had incredible flavor compared to the others so what a bummer.\n\nWith all these the mantou is still consistent in every order and bite.  Number one in my book is still the pork belly.", "author": "Shannon L."}

During peak hours the line would be close to 45- 60 mins long. Not to mention that your standing and waiting in the cold and have no where to sit after. It is more understanding when your in restaurant cause your in a restaurant. \n\nThe pork belly is their best dish. Its about $4 each. Its the same portion size you would get at any Chinese restaurant, so i would need to eat about 4 of them to get full. So now im at a total of $16 with no drinks. Tip and drinks about $20. Kinda high for a food truck, but i wouldn't buy a steak for $50 from a food truck even if it was the same steak from \"Mortons\"\n\nWith that said...\n\nI would recommend this place to ANYONE who loves good food.

Well the baked spicy chicken bun hit it on the big red dot for me at the San Jose Night Market: http://nightmrkt.com/ . \n\nI'm usually a healthy eater so it was a bit of a challenge staying away from red meat and pork, so I was about to let down my guard for the pork belly bun which everyone was raving about. At the last minute I realized there was a chicken option 3rd rows down on the menu. \n\nFirst I started off with a fork trying to peck and the 'fusionite' dish that looked so familiar yet foreign to me. Chicken was tender, the rich sesame dressing was not overly salty with just the right creaminess, the bun was soft and somewhat tasty. Eh... not bad. Then I realized, what a dumbass. It's in a bun, so put down the fork and go grab it with your hands! That's what I did. Put it all together and you get a really delicious Asian infused spicy chicken sandwich with sliced pickled carrots that really enhance the experience. \n\n$6 and it was worth every penny. Next time I'll grab this as well as the pork belly bun. The line was too long for me to go back that night, but I'll be back ANOTHER night!

Chairman Bao is the latest SF food truck to debut yesterday in the SOMA area selling Chinese bao (stuffed steamed or baked buns, like mini sandwiches). http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mm8E0AevUmxiray5APcfqA/l This iconic truck is currently parked at 1200-7th street, in front of Economy Restaurant Fixtures from 12-2pm. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r4IUojLiXmixL6pZAnyN9Q/l Check twitter for updates on upcoming evening locations and hours.\n\nThe prices are not exactly cheap (since the average bao costs less than $1 in Chinatown, and gua bao at Tea Garden is under $2) but affordable. A combo goes for $9 - choose two steamed buns OR one baked bun, plus a shaved ice drink. If you order a la carte, the baked baos are $5.75 each, while steamed baos (clam-shaped) are $2.95 - because they hold less filling. There are 6 choices for fillings: pork belly with pickled daikon, sesame chicken with scallion & bok choy, lion's head (pork meatball) with kimchee, duck confit with mango salsa, Chinese sausage with egg and hoisin sauce, and the vegetarian bao: garlic tofu with miso greens. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f7fkjC7OYTNh30oXrDNfIw/l\n\nThe fresh fruit shaved ice drinks ($3.50) have a few unusual flavor combinations: pineapple salted caramel, strawberry coconut, ginger lychee, and mango matcha green tea. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k3PaVqjbiNOFpID6r6W5NQ/l It's similar to Vietnamese dessert cups filled with chopped fruits and gelatin, but with shaved ice added. Other drink options include: iced tea, coconut water, vitasoy and others for $1.50 or more. The location is remote but so far so good (the fatty pork is the best choice so far). I'll update and add pics later after I try more menu items. Overall, 3.5 stars but rounded up to 4 stars because of the nice friendly service!\n\nThis is actually the 2nd street vendor to offer the steamed gua bao or siao bao in SF (not including regular Taiwanese restaurants). The other street vendor is \"MaliNumNum Treats\", she makes a slightly smaller version for $2, with 3 meat choices, no veggie version yet.\n\n*****\n\nRivalry with east coast vendor? - As soon as I heard the \"Chairman Bao\" name being used I knew there might be some controversy. Because I had read (previously bookmarked for places to try) about a small NY shop that opened last year named Baohaus, which has a menu item ($4 each) with that same name. And today it surfaced, the owner of Baohaus posted a reproaching foul mouth rant in his blog claiming that he owned that name. At first I was willing to consider his point of view as valid, but after he mentioned how he \"hates yelpers\" (even though he's a yelper too. Yelp flagged his 5-star review of his own place.) I lost all interest and his rant became meaningless noise to me. Yelpers are customers too, I believe that owners should respect all customers. Also no longer bookmarked to try that east coast spot.\n\nUpdate: Legally same/similar name use is not an issue since they operate in different regions.", "author": "Luis C."}

I tried a couple of steamed buns -- pork belly & tofu -- when The Chairman was in San Jose for the Moveable Feast in Willow Glen.  I found both disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the \"tender\" pork belly was anything but ... in fact, I almost reflexively spit out my first bite since the texture took me by surprise.  When you are expecting melt-in-your-mouth sumptuous pork belly and what you get is like a super-fat slab of bacon it is just not good.  Also, while normally I would agree that daikon paired with a greasy food is a good thing, it just didn't work for me in this case.  The flavor of the daikon was overwhelming, and though the pork belly's flavor was underwhelming it just didn't balance out.\n\nI liked the tofu bun better than the pork belly, but it still had its problems.  For being \"miso cured,\" I sure struggled finding the hit of miso umami I was expecting.  The tofu itself was nicely crisped on the outside and had a decent texture (though after eating the exquisite tofu from San Jose Tofu Co. at mom's house and at area Japanese restaurants it was a bit of a let down).  The pairing with the Chinese greens worked better than the daikon/pork belly pairing, and there was some sort of dressing/sauce that was tasty but I could have used a more generous dollop.\n\nOn the bright side, I did like the actual steamed bun in its pillowy goodness.  I suppose if I ever ran across this truck again I might try some of their other offerings -- I mean how could you ever go wrong with duck confit?  Though now that I think about it, I used to think the same thing about pork belly ...", "author": "Susan Y."}

Usually, there aren't too many people waiting around for their order either, since the Chairman is pretty quick at getting you your food.\n\nI always order the steam version since I think the slightly sweet bao pairs so well with the fillings, but there's something to be said about the baked version too (for one thing it's bigger, which means more to eat!).\n\nIn order of favorite:\n\nCoca-Cola Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage & Preserved Yellow Mustard Seeds\nAt it's best, this one is my favorite. But, the braised pork suffers from one thing: inconsistency. One day, it can be tender, juicy, and flavorful with a touch of sweetness, but another day it might be a bit dry, or just lacking in flavor.  Still, I always order it since when it's good, it just blows the pork belly (my second fav) out of the water!\n\nTender Pork Belly with Turmeric Pickled Daikon & Green Shiso\nConsistently delicious. I always order this with the Braised Pork, since regardless of how the Braised Pork turned out, the Pork Belly will always be crisp, tender, and flavorful. After all, how can you mess up pork belly--it's just extra thick bacon!\n\nMuscovy Duck Confit Terrine with Green Papaya, Orange Pickled Red Onions & Mint\nThe one thing about this is that Chairman is usually out of it. Of all the times I've gone to Chairman (more times than I can count), I've only seen the Duck available once. It's nice change of pace if you can find it, though. The papaya on top is fresh and crunchy and the duck is savory and tender.  But, if I had to choose, I'd still say the two pork flavors are better.\n\nSpicy Chicken with Toasted Sesame Pur\u00e9e, Pickled Carrots-Cucumber & Cilantro\nI always thought I liked chicken over pork, but Chairman is making me eat my words (or just their delicious bao!). It's good, and if you won't eat the even better pork buns, I'd highly recommend this as a substitute, but if you're not eating pork because you don't think you like it, try the Pork Belly...I'm sure it'll change your world!\n\nCrispy Miso Cured Tofu with Garlic-Tofu Mayo & Baby Choy Sum\nI'm going to be honest, I always prefer meat to non meat, but my love for Chairman was so strong that I wanted to try their meatless option.

Having already tried two of their buns with Sharon on my last visit, I knew it was worth a second!\n\nThey specialize in making tasty buns, a perfect balance of sweetness and soft dough, with great toppings. You can either have the smaller steamed version of the bun or the larger baked version. I have yet to try the baked version, something I'll be sure to do on my fourth trip to San Francisco!\n\nWith Sharon: spicy chicken with toasted sesame pur\u00e9e, crunchy pickled carrots, cucumber & cilantro. I remember the chicken being a bit tough, although the flavors were bang-on! The bun is the most memorable of the components, definitely unique to the food truck.\n\nOn the left: a Coca-Cola braised pork with savoy cabbage & preserved yellow mustard seeds. Super tender pork with a tangy twist. On the right: tender pork belly with turmeric pickled daikon & green shiso. Juicy bits of pork belly, and the daikon sliced so thin, it made a perfect slaw. Although their descriptions sound like very strong flavors (yellow mustards.. tumeric..), they're done very nicely with not one flavor overpowering another. Good balance!\n\nAt this point, we saved our stomachs for the other food trucks on the other end, only to return to The Chairman to buy another bun. Yes, they're that good! Even the guy on the truck smiled as if this happens all too often. We ended up getting my favorite of all four that I've tried now: the crispy miso cured tofu with garlic-tofu mayo & baby choy sum. Whatever they use to batter that medium-firm tofu is amazing. And although I'm not usually a fan of baby choy, it worked really well with the mayo sauce. Best one of them all, despite it sounding way less appetizing! As a snack for down the road, I also ordered the chips. Might as well try as much as I can on the menu!

Tender pork bellies that's topped off with turmeric, pickled daikon and green shiso. The delightful combination is like Heaven & Earth wrapped in a cloud of soft, fluffy and pillowy buns.\n\nHow about some Coca Cola braised pork with savory cabbage, yellow mustard seeds and Kewpie mayo? Hey, don't knock it till you try it. If that ain't your cup of tea, they also have spicy chicken with toasted sesame puree, pickled carrots, pickled cucumbers and cilantro. And for the vegans, they offer a crispy miso cured tofu with garlic-tofu mayo and baby choy sum. Prices for the chicken and tofu are $3.25 for steamed buns and $6.00 for the baked buns.\n\nBut the Chairman's star is the Pork Belly that just oozes with delightful flavors that will make you crave like a meth addict willing to prostitute yourself just to get another hit. Yeah, they're that addictively good. \n\nThe Chairman is a regular fixture at Off The Grid events all over the Bay Area, and it's often the star attraction at the Fort Mason location as they are usually positioned in the middle with the other trucks surrounding them like a cavalry protecting the herd. \n\nWhether you spot the big red truck with a logo of a Giant Panda wearing the Communist hat in the middle of an OTG event or parked on the streets of San Francisco, be sure to line up and get some buns. \n\nAnd a message to Eddie Huang:\n\nGiant Panda from the West will fart in your general direction, you douchebag!", "author": "John G."}

I get really excited when they're there and instantly line up. You will not regret it unless you're worried about your weight of course. The taste is divine. It is a little pricey though but it is a must have. Can't say I have any regrets. If you feel like going a little heavier get the baked buns.

I've tried this truck twice, and while the ingredients - especially the coca-cola braised pork - are tasty enough and fairly rich, you could do almost as well exploring your way through Asian bakeries, sandwich shops, and restaurants in suburban Asian strip malls or in urban Chinatowns. Lots of variety, reasonable freshness and quality, and far lower prices.\n\nWith baked buns going for $6 or more (and more... and more... it seems, every time I see this truck), this is one expensive experience. They're really gussied-up sliders with decent-quality ingredients, a little Asian flair, and clever packaging in that they come from a funkily decorated truck with cute pandas. On their own, they merit 3-4 stars at most.\n\nFor me, they weren't a satisfying experience either, unless you get 2 or 3 of the baked or steamed buns. All in all, super long waits, uncertain variety (they tend to sell out of certain items quickly), and a poor price/value proposition.\n\nIf you're at a food truck festival like Moveable Feast or Off the Grid and plan on spending $10-12 anyway, you'll likely find better taste and value at other trucks if you compare their menus closely and look at what other people are eating.", "author": "Vincent L."}

I wasn't feeling the Hapa truck; they're okay, but it wasn't tickling my fancy at the time.  Even though I like Southern Sandwiches, the line was long.  The choices left were Seoul on Wheels and The Chairman Truck.  Pacing back and forth between the two truck vendors, I decided on the latter.\n\nSteamed baos were $3.75 each, except the Crispy Tofu baos with baby bok choy and garlic mayo, $3.25 each.  I ordered the pork belly bao and the crispy tofu bao for $7.00.  I opened the container and looked at my savory goodies...hmmm...they seemed a bit small for the price and I asked myself - did I get my money's worth?  Oh my, looks can be deceiving!!!  I love them and I did get my money's worth!!!\n\nThe steamed pork belly bao topped with pickled daikon and green shiso was delicious, quite filling and the pork belly itself was tender and tasty.  However, for some strange reason it had hardly any fat on it.  I guess the vendor must have taken one look at me and thought she got plenty of fat on her, and doesn't need the added fat on the pork belly...awww I feel so deprived not having to chew on some of that fat or some fat back...lol.    \n\nNext up was the crispy tofu bao with the baby bok choy.  Ooh wee (or oui), I inhaled it and wished I had bought another one.  I have eaten miso soup, ma po tofu, stir fried green beans with tofu, deep fried tofu stuffed with ground pork, but I never had a crispy tofu bao and I never knew how great they taste.  Better yet, never mind about getting a pork belly bao the next time, I'll settle for three steamed crispy tofu baos.\n\nDefinitely I will add this truck to my short list of mobile food vendors.", "author": "Carol C."}

The bun is soft and light, the perfect vessel for the pork and diakon. \n\nThe braised pork was is sweet and bursting with flavor. The pork itself is pull apart tender.

Everything was seasoned \"Asianly-perfectly\" (a cross between Korean cuisine meets Chinese cuisine) with super fresh toppings such as kale and cucumbers. I don't think the chicken was too spicy so I think even the sensitive types could handle it. Anyone who wanted more spicy could use siracha sauce from their counter.

The turmeric daikon looked weird to me at first because I am strictly a \"meats and potatoes\" girl however, I ate the entire thing almost in 2 gigantic bites because it was that finger-lickin' yummy!

The daikon pickles were really good. The steamed bun had a good taste, but sort of dense in texture. One problem with the pork belly steamed bun was that it needed some sort of sauce, if there was any... it was too mild. I could barely finish one bun because it tasted so fatty. A sweet soy sauce like they use for peking duck at chinese restaurants would have made my steam bun so much better. I really think they should consider adding this option. It would've knocked my socks off. Another problem was the lack of fresh veggies, perhaps cabbage or butter lettuce. There's a lot more potential for the pork bun, but overall it was a little bit of a disappointment.", "author": "Ashley T."}

I mean who doesn't love a man in uniform speeding off to save lives?\n\nThe Chairman Truck is my new favorite big red truck. Because they save hungry, overworked, cubicle-ridden lives one meal at a time.  \n\nThe first time I had the Chairman Truck was at the Treasure Island Flea a few years ago. They might as well call themselves the Crack Truck because after one bite of my pork belly bun I was addicted.\n\nSo when my office started having food trucks come in for lunch on Wednesdays I told all of my co-workers how life changing these buns are, one by one they finally braved the Disneyland line to get some pork belly in their bellies. Go ahead, call me a bun pusher, I'm not ashamed. Now-a-days we check the food truck line up each week in hopes that the Chairman is coming. And we can't be the only ones with our fingers crossed because there is no other food truck that creates lines like the Chairman does. I almost feel bad for its competitor food trucks, but then I don't because they don't sell pork belly buns.\n\nI've tried everything on the menu except for the tofu. Usually I opt for baked buns over steamed buns, but if you want to keep your lunch on the lighter side, or sample a bit of everything, steamed is the way to go. A little bit of Sriracha is the perfect sauce. And (as I already raved about) the pork belly is my favorite. The meat is perfection and I'm obsessed with the pickled daikon.\n\nSo is it Wednesday yet?", "author": "Kristen K."}

I guess when you do only a handful of foods, you do them pretty damn well. \n\nI had the tender pork belly first. Honestly, this is as close to perfect pork belly as I could imagine. First and foremost, the skin of the pork walks that fine line between being crispy without being too tough to get your teeth into. The meat inside is moist and melts in your mouth. The bread is fresh and lightly toasted, which leaves the entire mouthful feeling pleasantly warm. \n\nI also got the sesame chicken, which was equally good. But if you compare the ideal chicken sandwich to the ideal pork belly sandwich, you know pork belly is winning every time.

I ended up getting the red sesame chicken with pickled sliced cucumber and carrot as well as the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens. Both baked \"People's Buns\" at $6 each. Steamed ones are $3.25. \"Chairman's Buns\" such as the pork belly are $3.75 steamed and $6.75 for baked.\n\nThe red sesame chicken was my favorite! Really delicious! The chicken was tender and slightly spicy and the cucumbers and carrots were refreshing. The crispy tofu on the other hand, was lacking the garlic flavor I was looking for and the tofu could have been crispier. It was just alright.\n\nI gave this truck another go when they were parked in front of the Frey Norris Gallery opening a couple of weeks ago. Anyway, I got the red sesame chicken again, but this time steamed...and it was just as good! I also tried the Bao chips ($2.50), which were basically fried wonton chips with bits of nori and salt. They were a little too salty for my liking so I really wouldn't recommend them. \n\nTo sum it up, I've had pretty good experiences with this truck and look forward to eating more buns from them.

In any case, the price is ok and the portions were generous, so I will lean towards a 3 more than a 2 star.", "author": "Dianna D."}

I don't turn 25 for a whole month! Distressed as I was, I went to go and meet up with my boyfriend for lunch in that little alley way for bao. He knows I'm a sucker for puns, and the Chairman? I mean, really, how could I NOT go?\n\nI moped around and was generally sad in line while the boyfriend ordered one of each on steamed bao. We took it up to his office to eat, and I was already surprised that it basically looked like a taco, if you described a taco to a person who did not know what a taco was and only had steamed bao in the form of discs. The toppings were pork belly (oh yes, KAKUNI!), coca-cola pork, and spicy chicken. Each bao had its own pickled vegetable to keep it company.\n\nSullenly, I took a bite. My mood elevated - not to the point of extreme happiness, mind you, but there's something about food that takes a bad day and turns it into \"better than expected\". The bao was excellent. I was one of those kids that took steamed bao and only ate the bread part, and left the meaty bits behind. This was not the case here. I sincerely wished I was in a better mood while we were in line, because I definitely would have ordered one of each for myself, too. Surprisingly, the pickled veggies were my favorite, but I wouldn't have them without the meat. Honestly, if they just gave me a giant Spirited-Away-sized bao with all the meats and veggies in it, I'd be a happy camper.\n\nI'd definitely come back again. Next time, I'm getting my own portions. I'm surprised my boyfriend shared...well, not really, but I mean, I don't really know if I'd share them...they're perfectly sized when you order three for yourself! The baked buns were much bigger, so if you're looking for a sandwich, that's probably what you want to go for.", "author": "Robbin A."}

The ingredients are not used in any Chinese cooking involving the other ingredients in the same bun and these aren't even real \"buns\" since they are actually breading for peking duck or chicken - a traditional Beijing dish where you put the roast duck or chicken inside the sweet wedged bread sliced down the middle with some hoisin sauce and green onions.\n\nThat aside, $3.75? really?

I was really looking forward to the spiced duck bun, but they didn't have any duck that day. They had the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens, red sesame chicken with scallions and bok choy, tender pork belly with pickled daikons, and braised pork belly with some sort of slaw. I ordered one of each (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sT8TRzofJym5w0khZkOJhw?select=k7H8rqrkz4OyzF3kgmrwhA), for about $3.75 for each steamed bun. The baked bun was about $6, which I thought sounded a little overpriced so I didn't get it. I also prefer my buns steamed, not baked. \n\nI was very impressed with how delicious the buns tasted! The tender pork belly with pickled daikons (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sT8TRzofJym5w0khZkOJhw?select=NUIdqZY892mJlFIudDEocw) and the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens were my favorites. The pork belly slices were predominantly fat, but that's what pork belly is all about. It was gluttonous, but oh so good! It was very well prepared and full of flavor. The pickled daikon was crisp and served as a perfect contrast to the jelly pork belly. The crispy garlic tofu with miso greens was very refreshing. The tofu was soft inside, crispy on the outside, and complemented very well with the miso greens.\n\nThe lady who took my order was very nice. She wasn't pushy and allowed me time to decide on what I wanted--even if it was everything on the menu. I assume that everything is already prepped, so it didn't take them very long to put my order together.

I ordered a braised pork steamed bun w/ mustard seeds and cabbage. The meat was sweet, savory, and flawlessly cooked.

The atmosphere was laid-back, with a folk singer playing acoustic guitar.\n\nHad the pork belly with baked bun.  The bun is like the outside of a baked char siu bao, but the size of hamburger roll.  Pork belly is the same meat as bacon, but braised or roasted instead of fried (and not smoked).  So you have tender strips of lean and fat, and that is why the meat is so filling and rich tasting.  It has a little seasoning, maybe a hint of Chinese 5 spice.  The tanginess of the pickled daikon on top is a refreshing complement and helps to cut the richness.   \n\nI asked the guy taking orders if the spicy chicken was really spicy, and he said no, it was mild.  So I ordered it on the baked roll and got a wonderfully flavored bun filled with medium-spicy (to me) chicken cooked in a sauce with complex Asian flavors including the advertised toasted sesame puree and I think hoisin sauce.

The steamed bun most resembles the taste and size of a Peking duck bun while the baked bun resembles the taste of a baked BBQ pork bun that you get at Dim Sum and the size of a small burger bun. While the baked bun is heavier in terms of being greasy, it is much tastier and definitely more worth it for your money.\n\nI was told that the pork belly was the specialty and the most popular item so I opted for that. The pickled daikon paired with the meat inside the bun was a perfect pairing to offset the sweetness of the bun and saltiness of the meat. \n\nTip: Sometimes they run out of the baked buns before the end of the night so even if you're thinking of trying other food trucks around, hop into Chairman Bao's line first to ensure that you'll get a baked bun because it's so much more worth it and tastier than a steamed one", "author": "Stacey L."}

During SJ Eats, we bought one of everything on the menu - steamed bun with chicken, steamed bun with pork, and steamed bun with tofu and miso greens, in addition to a baked bun with pork.\n\nThe steamed bun was soft and fluffy.  The slight sweet taste offset the saltiness of the chicken/pork.  The chicken bun was a bit spicy, but with goof flavor and the chicken was very tender.  The pork belly bun was very, very good!  The pork belly melted in my mouth, and the pickled daikon added crunchiness to the softness of everything else.\n\nWhat I did not like were the steamed bun with tofu and miso greens and the baked bun with pork belly.  The tofu bun lacked flavor, even with the miso greens.  Even though the tofu looked fried, everything was just a bland, soft mush.\n\nThe baked pork belly bun was way too dry, and the portion was simply too big.  Not saying \"too big\" as in it is worth the price tag - I meant too big in terms of having to chew the same dry meat and flavor for an extended period of time... Eeek.\n\nOverall, I don't think this is something that worth waiting for two hours for, even though the steamed buns were very tasty.

Here in San Francisco Chairman Bao is certainly one of the major players in this Street Food revolution so when I found out they were going to be in Emeryville this Monday I was going to hunt them down. \n\nJust before lunch I took my daughter, my brother and his girlfriend down to Emeryville to find this truck. (It's not that hard to find since it looks like a fire truck with tattoos. You can see it three blocks away.) When we got there there were only a few people in line since they were still setting up, but as soon as they open, the masses of followers started to show up. \n\nAs soon as they started taking order I ordered the Steamed Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon and Duck Confit with Mango Salad in a baked bun. My brother and his girlfriend ordered the Steamed Sesame Chicken with Scallions and Bok Choy and the Steamed Pork Belly. \n\nMy immediate favorite is the Duck hands down. It is shredded duck and some kind of sweet mango relish thrown in a baked Chinese bun. The immediate reaction to the first bite is \"Humm this is different, a little spicy, hummm.\" Then as I took the last bite I'm saying \"G-- D--- this is good, I'm buying another one.\" \n\nThe Sesame Chicken was also delicious and spicy, as my brother's girlfriend gave me some to try. I'm definitely getting more of that on my next visit. \n\nThe Steamed Pork Belly was also good, although it didn't make a big splash as the other food. \n\nOverall I loved it. No problem giving Chairman Bao a cool 5 stars. I love the whole Street Eat Revolution and it's my honor to support this movement. \n\nOne request for Chairman Bao Ban, please pay a visit in Hercules Market Hall, PLEASE!!!\n\nUpdate 1/3/2011: Follow up meeting with the Chairman and this time I got the Braised Pork w/ Savoy Cabbage and Preserved Mustard Seeds. It was delicious, but I still put the Duck Confit above them all.  I also got to try their Ginger Lychee Lemonade, it was so good, you got to try it.", "author": "Mel B."}

BUT Yelp readers, this is why my solitude was justified:  \n\n1. This is finger food of the highest caliber.  Sumptuous meats (pork belly and duck confit are amazing) and fresh vegetables (baby bok and pickled daikon) combined and sandwiched into a fresh Chinese style steamed roll serve as a totally awesome reminder of the more authentic dishes natives like myself love and also as a gentle introduction to Asian snacks for those less fortunate and less Chinese.\n\n2. The shaved ice/jelly/boba drinks are different.  Salted ginger with little tiny cubes of lychee jelly and boba on the bottom?  More please.  Unlike anything I've ever had at any Asian tea shop.  \n\n3. Have you all seen the Chairman truck?  That truck is seriously just really awesome to look at.  I dont think any other Bay Area food truck has been as successful in its viral marketing using the truck itself.  Very commendable. \n\nMinus 1 star for the wait time, but they do their best and I could tell the service staff was really stressed out trying to bring out all the food as fast as possible.  I don't understand why the girl in the front passing out all the food is there though. I didn't find her to facilitate the process all that much. \n\nI will admit that maybe this concept is a bit overrated, and more delicious Chinese food can be found easily in SF at a smaller cost with only a fraction of the wait time, but I have to commend the homies/comrades over at Mobi Munch for doing such an excellent job with its marketing for this truck.

Great interpretation of the Chinese classic \"gua bao\". Offerings came in two sizes: steamed bun and baked bun. Steamed bun is soft and sweet, and the 2-3 bites-sized portion; you'd probably have to eat at least 2 or 3 to feel really satisfied. Baked bun is closer to the size of a burger; if you're really hungry you could probably eat one and a half of those. \n\nHighly recommend the pork belly with pickled daikon and the spicy chicken. Unlike some food trucks, Chairman gets the flavor balance right between the richness you get from the meat and the acid from the topping. \n\nDon't forget about the Tofu, either.

I got their most popular offering, the pork belly, both on a steamed bun and a baked bun, and then I threw in a Coca Cola braised pork steamed bun for good measure. The steamed bun is just as I'd imagined. It's the type of bun you get with Peking duck, only bigger and slightly more refined. The baked bun is the type of bun you get with a char siu bao -- brown, slightly sweet, and toasted to perfection. \n\nThe pork belly was so far beyond disappointing that I'm still questioning just what cut of meat was used. It was dry, hard, and not at all the luscious, fatty, tender pork belly that my taste buds are accustomed to. There was supposed to be some sort of sauce, but hell if I could find it, and shiso? Where? Shiso has such a specific taste that if there had been even a hint of it, I would've noticed, but nope. Nada.

The only bad thing about this truck is that the buns aren't big enough. I love every bite, but I wish I could prolong it.

The two biggest complaints about Chairman Bao seem to be the prices and waiting in long lines, one of which is valid.  \n\nIf you attend an Off The Grid event where the Chairman Bao truck is taking part, especially if it happens to be Off The Grid Fort Mason, then you will without a doubt find yourself waiting in a long line to place your order.  Yes, it's in part due to the truck's trendiness among those who regularly attend Off The Grid and similar food truck events, and you can't dismiss the awesome design and paint job that adorn the truck itself, but the biggest reason for the long lines at the Chairman Bao bun truck is without a doubt the food.  Buns, steamed or baked, filled with fresh, well prepared ingredients, and made to order.\n\nIf you're looking for taco truck prices from a decade ago then Chairman Bao is probably not what you're looking for.  Take into consideration the cost of food items at similar trucks currently operating all over the Bay Area, and Chairman Bao's prices are not out of line with that of their competition.  If there was a negative side to the prices charged by trucks like Chairman Bao, it's that the old school taco trucks see this trend as a reason to jack up their own prices.  A pork belly or duck confit steamed bun for $3.75 each from Chairman Bao makes more sense to me than a $7 or $8 breakfast burrito filled with chorizo, refried beans, rice, and guacamole (not even potatoes) from a taco truck.", "author": "Jay U."}

Because I've actually made them at home and know that waiting in line for those little pillows of porktastic-ness is worth every cent and every second of your life that you will never get back from waiting in line.\n\nYes, I've attempted to make Momofuku's pork buns at home and holy smokes Batman, let me tell you, they are a labor of love (aka, in Anastasia lingo: they are a mutherphuckin' pain in the a$$!!) It took me FOUR PHUCKING HOURS from start to finish. Make the dough. Let in rise. Wait. And wait some more. Knead the dough. Let is rest. Let is rise again. Wait again. Blah. Blah. Blah. In the meantime, the pork belly needs to roast in the oven for a gazillion hours. Then you have to make the pickles and last but not least steam the little buggers. Oh, and did I mention assembling the damn things before they are chowed down at lightning speed. I might as well take up smoking or something if I want to knock off five years of my life in one day!\n\nAs much as I love the Chairman's buns (moist and fluffy, yes they are.), sometimes I need a change from the same ol' same ol'. I have to admit the last couple times I've been to OTG, I've walked on passed the Chairman. Without a second glance. I've been tempted by something new. Thou shalt not speak its name, but it rhymes with MoJa (say that three times) -- the new long line in town.\n\nSo kids, the next time you begrudgingly moan and groan about the Chairman line, just think of me slaving away in the kitchen for FOUR PHUCKING HOURS. And just be grateful it's not you having to make these buns. A 15-20 minute wait in line is not all that bad considering what goes into making those little pillows of porktastic-ness.", "author": "Anastasia B."}

We've tried both the steamed buns and the burgers, and I definitely prefer the steamed buns because they are more delicate and since they are smaller, you can also try a lot more of the buns! I love the miso cured tofu with baby choy sum - the tofu is delicious but the choy sum did taste a little funny because of the sauce and I would have preferred it just as it is. Both the braised pork and the pork belly are to die for - really tender and flavorful and not oily at all, although the daikon may take some getting used to. The spicy chicken was way too spicy for me unfortunately. I took one bit and gave up so I can't say how yummy (or otherwise) it is.

During my first trip to Off The Grid, this was our last stop. I lucked out and a friend had the hook-up at this place. We got the braised pulled pork baked bun, the pork belly with pickled daikon baked bun, along with four different steamed buns.\n\nI tried a little bit of each and each one was AMAZING. The meat in the braised pulled pork bun was flavorful and had a tasty coleslaw topping. The bun itself was soft, fluffy, and slightly sweet. The meat on the pork belly bun was also pretty good. I'm not a big fan of fatty meats like pork belly, so I only had a small bite, but it also was quite tasty! I didn't get to try any of the steamed buns except for the tofu one, but the bun on that one is also nicely balanced. It's pliable, yet firm enough to hold in the good stuff. The tofu is also very flavorful, though, slightly salty.\n\nWhen we got our items, they were fresh and still mighty hot, but that is the way to eat it! Even when I decided to pick at some leftovers later that night, it was still heavenly!

I split the meal (2 buns + drink) with a friend, and we got the pork belly with daikon and the duck with mango. Both were really tasty. The pork belly had an exceptionally fatty cut of pork, and with the daikon, the combination was unbeatable. I loved the duck with mango, and even though I thought the combination was odd to begin with, I took a bite and all my doubts disappeared.

Tried The Chairman at the Menlo Park \"Off the Grid\" venue and it was fantastic.  I had the pork belly and spicy chicken, both with the steamed buns.  I'm usually not a fan of steamed buns from dim sum joints, but these were excellent and just the right size.  The richness of the meat is nicely balanced by the pickled vegetables on both these buns.  The line was longer than at any of the other trucks, but it was well worth the wait.  Looking forward to going back again to try the coca cola braised pork bun and the tofu bun.

This plan worked wonders for me, as upon my arrival I was teetering on the verge of chewing my own tongue off for nourishment.  \n\nHapa SF: very quick line, 7 pieces of thumb-sized Lumpia Shanghai rolls, tender grounded pork, water chestnut, shredded carrot, served with sweet chili plum sauce.\n\nMagnolia: I had both a sippable IPA and later a dark Porter that was well hopped and was colored as between a medium-Oak and dark-Walnut in appearance.  Very refreshing, the line looks intimidating but it moves rather quickly.\n\nKoja Kitchen: is centered in the ring of trucks, so they had a bit of a line.  It was about a 20-30 minute wait-time, but with my IPA in hand from Magnolia it was easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.. and their Tiramisu alone would've been well worth the wait.  But of course the short ribs with chives over a bed criss-cross fries tasted amazing.  I saw a couple eating the rice cake version which looked a bit difficult and messy, so we opted for the fries.\n\nThe Chairman: the creamy clam chowder was the perfect choice to warm myself up with the dropping temperature.. all the Gua Bao steamed buns looked amazing as well, but I wouldn't have been able to take more than a bite of one.  I already made a note to find this truck again, for the duck confit terrine with green papaya, and orange picked mint + onions.  It sounds and looked amazing as it was being dished out to others ahead of me.  This truck has coconut water!\n\nFat Face: strawberry coconut popsicle was the perfect last note, and amount of natural sweetness to end this eating-spree on.. Especially on the walk back to the car, the subtle coconut flavor melds very well with the fragrance of the strawberry. \n\nAll the food was great, inexpensive (most ~$5-7 range), sizeable portions (perfect for sharing), heavenly smells.. but be warned you will leave smelling char-broiled / post-camp fire.", "author": "Ty T."}

The buns also held up fine (were maybe a taad bit thin) and had that nice, slightly sweet taste. But what I was confused about was the overall bun. Most buns I've had also included some small slices of cucumber, or some relish, or some light powdery nutty topping. The daikons were kind of overpowering, I'd have preferred a lighter veggy instead. The coca-cola pork was standard. \n\nPrice: A combo deal would be nice? $3.75 per bun is alright as a snack, but to get a lunch's worth, becomes pricey.

The filling choices are fresher and tastier than anything you'll get in Chinatown, but there is a price premium for that!  If you get a bunch of the smaller steamed buns it's like your own personal curbside dim sum.\n\nBuns: You have two choices.  The steamed buns are like the ones you'd get served with Peking Duck, overflowing with the filling.  The baked bun is NOT like the one you'd get at a Chinese bakery with BBQ pork hiding inside, it is more like a brioche sandwich roll cut in half with a double serving of filling.  The baked option is more filling, but I prefer the steamed bun because the flavor is subtler and lets you focus on what's in the middle.\n\nTender Pork Belly: Large slabs of pork belly and lots of them.  Very tender unlike some tough pork bellies that are cooked too fast.  Soft all throughout, sadly no crispy outside though.  The pickled daikon does a good job of pairing tart with the rich fatty pork.  Definitely my favorite.\n\nBraised Pork: Very soft pulled pork with a creamy mustardy sauce.  Seemed more like Southern BBQ than Chinese influence.  Kind of like a slider, so I wasn't too wowed.  Maybe they should try Chinese Hot Mustard instead?\n\nRed Sesame Chicken: Thankfully it's not that deep fried chicken in a sticky sauce you get from greasy Chinese restaurants with numbered menus.  The whole thing had an overwhelming taste of tahini.  Not as rich as the pork options so it went down very quickly.\n\nCrispy Garlic Tofu: I was shocked that the tofu tasted so good!  Many times tofu from street carts tends to be an afterthought to assuage the whiny vegetarian/vegan co-worker in the lunch group.  It was lightly fried; think chicken milanese not the Colonel's.  HEAVY garlic taste which is totally yummy, but best for a day when you don't have any client meetings in the PM.\n\nBao Chips: Too much nori!

The pork belly is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I also liked the homemade daikon pickles that go on top of the pork belly...cripsy, sweet, sour...yum.  Gimme a jar of that to go.  You can throw in a jar of pork belly too while you're at it.\n\n2. Tofu\nYes!  I know it's not paleo, but I had to try it...and I actually liked it 2nd best.  Hats off to you Chairman Bao.  If I had to bet on my order of buns I would have lost due to this upset.  The tofu was very flavorful.  Way Awesome.\n\n3. Braised Pork\nOh Braised Pork...you were supposed to be #2.  It was good, but just didn't have the same flavor impact as the Pork Belly and the Tofu.\n\nRest:\nDidn't really stand out to me...besides at these prices do you want to waste your time with anything lower than 3rd place?\n\nSo if it were so good why 3 stars?

(It was a good thing I went there first as the lines were humongously long soon after!)\n\nI'd planned to try a steamed and a baked bun but changed my mind when I saw the prices (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sT8TRzofJym5w0khZkOJhw?select=n2ppbhXNKoAOB19OTE1Zdg). $3.5 for a steamed bun was steep enough so there was no way I would pay $6 for a baked one. (Though I saw someone else eat one and they were the size of burgers--not exactly small eats. Still, you can get a baked bbq pork bun in Chinatown for 70 cents.) I got the red sesame chicken and braised pork steamed buns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sT8TRzofJym5w0khZkOJhw?select=D8l2LToZj5azA6XRpbIVVg).\n\nThe chicken was flavourful but really really spicy; the bok choy helped and provided a nice crunch. I liked the braised pork better; it was flavourful but not as intense and very tender (kinda like pulled pork). I wasn't a fan of the steamed bun itself though. Chairman Bao doesn''t make them fresh so by the time you get them they're cold and stale. Steamed buns should really only be eaten fresh--while there's still steam coming off and the skin still slightly sticks to your fingers.\n\nOverall the buns were just meh and the inflated prices didn't help. I'd much rather have the authentic stuff for only a small fraction of the price.", "author": "Steph L."}

Awesome looking food truck that serves up delicious food. \n\nI think the steamed clamshell \"bao\" (normally reserved for peiking duck) is an ingenious vessel for packing the flavor in. It's fluffy and chewy, without being mushy. It's slightly sweet and is soft enough to soak up all those residual oils and juices and sauces from the meat. \n\nTheir pork belly is just ridiculous. Pork belly by itself is an insanely delicious cut. It is fatty, juicy, tender, crispy, basically every type of flavor/texture you could ever want. The Chairman heaps on generous chunks of pork belly and tops it off with some sweet/sour pickled daikon. It adds a nice visual touch, as well as a nice crunch and cooling bite to level out the richness of the pork belly. \n\nI also tried their coca-cola pork shoulder. It's flavorful and tender and almost reminded me of a fresher version of the dried pork sung that you find in chinese grocery stores. The mustard seeds on top are a nice touch.\n\nStill haven't tried their baked versions, but I'm sure they will be just as good.", "author": "Tim W."}

They had Char Siu, Spicy Garlic Chicken, and Crispy Tofu, however no Duck Confit which I was really hoping for :( \n\nGot both there Steamed and Baked Version of Char Siu and Garlic Chicken with a cost of about $20 in total. There is a large difference in price, but there is a REASON for it, the Baked ones are about 3X the size of the steamed; its like eating a larger sandwich/burger.\n\nThe food was great, tasty buns and chewy buns, well seasoned/spiced chicken and char siu. The savory meat flavors went well with the soft dough and crunchy sourness from the pickled veggies stuffed inside (daikon/carrots/bok choy). Portions were decent, but being Chinese and knowing that SF Chinatown has the same stuff for a millions times cheaper holds me back. Its awkward to pay more than a $1 for a bun...seriously man, go eat some bomb dim sum.\n\nThe only things that turned me off was that the truck/workers/foodboxes were just dingy and greasy at the time...like I don't want to wear white clothes and be near it greasy; however this was the SJ EATS shindig so the masses obviously wore them down.", "author": "Randy L."}

I've been wanting to try The Chairman for the longest time and I finally got to this past weekend while my boyfriend waited in line for KoJa Kitchen. \n\nSince we were both starving, I ordered the baked pork belly bao, steamed braised pork and steamed spicy chicken bao. Pork belly was hands down my favorite and totally worth it for $6.75. Like I've mentioned before, food truck food can get pretty pricey sometimes so I wasn't too surprised about the price. The pork belly was so tender and flavorful. The pork was chopped up in many pieces and there was so much that the meat kept falling off with every bite. A in my book for not being stingy on the meat!\n\nSpicy chicken was pretty good but didn't blow my mind. I couldn't really taste the spiciness of it which was a bummer. The steamed baos were warm and yummy though! There was a decent amount of meat on it but I'd rather pay another $3 for twice as much.\n\nThe coca-cola braised pork steamed bao was delicious! The pork was braised, pulled and put into a tiny little steamed bun with lots of meat. I guess you can say I have low standards so I'm not disappointed in overhyped foods but I really liked the flavor in the pulled pork. It wasn't try at all. \n\nFor my first bao experience, I left a happy, happy girl.

I was stoked when I moved to SF to find that there is an actual Food Truck Stop on Mission St.  They change up their trucks every day and post on a website. Boy was I lucky to have Chairman Bao on the day I went to the truck stop. This place is awesome. Probably one of my two favorite trucks next to the \"Kogi\" Truck in Los Angeles.\nYou can either get a steamed or baked bun. The baked is essentially a hamburger and the steamed is essentially a taco. The prices are a bit steep than in Chinatown but man the flavors are solid here. They took something traditional and added a nice twist to it with the ingredients that they place into it. The pork belly is my favorite by far here. The pickled daikon adds a solid contrast both flavor and texture wise and the pork belly is super tender and flavorful. I also had the spicy chicken also which was solid but nothing beats the pork here. Definitely use siracha sauce if you like a little kick but trust me, even without it you would love it. \nIf you have not tried the Chairman yet, find it and get some.

Off the Grid is quite the spectacle and the Chairman Truck is really the centerpiece of the whole event. I ordered a selection of their buns (2 baked and 2 steamed) not knowing exactly what I would be getting with that but excited to smaple their wares.\n\nEnded up with 2 of the pork belly (1 baked and 1 steamed) and 1 each of the chicken and the braised pork and quite satisfied. The steamed buns were everything I've grown to love in a steamed bun (tender, slightly sweet) and the baked buns really packed extra stuff inside (making the extra cost well worth it) and held up to the ingredients both texture wise and flavor wise. \n\nThe pork belly in the buns was fantastic and all of the toppings were really tasty and matched each of the meats appropriately. The neon picked radish really cut through the richness of the pork belly and despite my general hatred of mayo, the Kewpie mayo on the braised pork really worked in the context of the mustard seeds and the cabbage.

Could it have anything to do with Eddie Huang (of Baohaus NY) threatening a lawsuit of copyright name infringement? Who knows. For now Eddie has rights to a Chairman Bao truck. And at least we know Eddie's Chairman Bao is based on his homeland's Taiwan style \"hamburger\" or gua bao, which got bastardized by David Chang and ended up making million$.\n\nBut anyway for this Chairman,  it is a good thing that \"Bao\" isn't in their name anymore. Phew.\n\nBecause what I had off the Chairman Truck was an ab$$$$olute aBAOmination. Especially to real Chinese food.\n\nPerhaps I'm a traditionalist (re: a real a$$ $nob) at heart. I've had  mantou before (plain steamed buns) from Northern to Shandong style in Taipei and Hong Kong, Shanghainese steamed bun version in Hong Kong (including the pan fried one), cha siu bao (been eating those mofo's since I was 2 or younger, no joke), and in the last 5 years have had Taiwanese version of Shen Jian Bao, xiao long bao, Northern style baozi (pork and cabbage steamed buns), as well as some of the very best Taiwanese gua bao in Taipei, that ruined me for life. For example, Lan Jia Gua Bao in Taipei, a relative newcomer competitor to Shih Jia Gua Bao (30++ year old shop near Tong Hua Street Night Market) that is one of the greats\n\nhttp://beefnoguy.blogspot.com/2010/01/lan-jia-gua-bao-pork-belly-burger.html\n\nAnd thus ruined me so much that no commie Panda on wheels, even if customized by a Japanese chef (gasp), could impre$$ me no more.\n\nIf Chairman's steamed pork bellay bunz taste anything like NYC David Chang's MomoFuk-U's then no thank u.\n\nOk so the Commie Panda on wheels the other night had:\n\n\"Tender pork belly with pickled daikon\" - was told the pork belly was braised then grilled or was it fried. A miniscule portion that I could hold with two fingers, pretty much gone with 3 medium sized bites. $3.75 poorer....$hit. Two flavor profiles....SALT and SOUR, not much going on there. This pork belly prep definitely caters to the American palette, but those who've had Cantonese, Taiwanese, Hangzhou style pork belly (in Asia and at the competent North American Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants) will find it on the dull side. Even a shio butabara (pork belly skewer) or tontoro (pork cheek) grilled skewer at a good yakitori joint executes the salted swine even better. Hell even Ramen Parlor's buta kakuni which I'm not a fan of has more flavor. As for charcoal grilled pork belly in a bun off a truck, guess this won't work, unless the truck itself is powered by charcoal....maybe on a choo choo?\n\n\"Braised pork with savoy cabage and mustard green seeds\" - similar thing, except it was tender lean meat...again two very similar flavor profiles, almost one dimensional. The cabbage and mustard green seeds was however a nice touch texture wise, but a lot more was missing to make this easier to swallow in terms of worthine$$. Spicy rooster sauce would not have made this any better. Another $3.75 gone.\n\nOui oui je comprende....this is \"food truck mania\" and supposed to be trendy. And no, not everyone is a traditional$t $nob and if the real thing were offered by the Commie Panda at the same price at the same size, they would not like it. And plus most of you probably prefer CP over the rendition done by Joy in Foster City (that charges pretty much the same price for TWO similar sized items, but way more delicious and closer to the real deal than this trendy slider wackadoodle). And yes now I know why some Vietnamese expat yelpers (or those who know real Vietnamese food) look at Charles Phan's projects (or Chris Yeo's or basically most Asian fusion gone hip) and think he $old his $oul for rock & roll. But at least I have more respect for Charles Phan... than some fu$n simplified bao wannabe :-o\n\nI'm definitely not sold on this hype, sorry. A single Lan Jia Gua Bao is NT$50 or a shade near $1.60 for something that's completely amazing that has texture, multiple tastes, fragrance, and just visually impressive. $3.75 for something that's 1/3 of the size, more than x2 the price, that has ridiculously few condiments (I mean yeah Sriracha is there but WTF? No shaved peanut powder, no cilantro, no kimuchi, and the pork itself has little flavor other than salt or soy?) make this overrated and overpriced.", "author": "Ken K."}

The mustard greens were good, but the tofu was not crispy at all. In fact it was really mushy and did not go well with the soft steamed bun. I love anything with garlic, but this particular garlic sauce was sour and not pleasant to eat.\n\nPork Belly with Pickled Daikon bun - I liked this one. The pork belly was very soft and well flavored and went well with the crunchy daikon.\n\nSpiced duck confit with mango and onion - This one was my favorite because it had the best combination of flavors, with the soft spiced shredded duck with the sweet mango and that little kick from the onion.\n\nIt did not live up to the hype but I am still glad I tried it.

Both time at the Eat Real festival in Oakland, 2011 and 12. And I think that is probably why I think it is so good. It sort of become a tradition and treat for me.

I don't think my stomach have the ability to stretch enough to fit like 10 baos a day. \n\nI really have no clue what the prices are because at Eat Real festivals, the prices are capped to around 5 bucks. But either way, it was very affordable and I left the truck with no complaints from my wallet or stomach. \n\nWhat I think makes the baos here so good, is balance! The meat is savory and juicy, the bao is a perfect vessel and what I think is the most important component, the pickles! Daikon, carrots, radishes, cucumbers, all of them cuts right through the fattiness of the meat and provide your mouth with the necessary crunch. Topping your baos off with siracha is a must! The spiciness adds a whole new dimension. I'll stop talking out of my butt and let you guys go try it for yourself!", "author": "Tung T."}

The line was still pretty long, but it moved a lot faster than I remembered, probably because they didn't have their shaved fruit drinks that I loved. I asked about them and was told that they only serve them on \"special days.\" I also didn't see the duck confit bun on the menu. Since it was a Friday during Lent, I could only order the garlic tofu bun ($3.25 for steamed). It did not hold a candle to the pork and duck buns. I wouldn't order them again, even on a day when I am not allowed to eat meat.

They really put effort into each ingredient, which totally shows in a seemingly small bun filled with just a few pieces of meat and veggies. The meat is marinated in wonderful juice, done to perfection. But I mean, how can do you go wrong with pork belly?! Still, it's good. The veggies that accompany the meat in the buns are no afterthought, they're also carefully seasoned to enhance the meat in the bun, making the whole thing a symphony in your mouth. \n\nSo far I've had the pork belly (duh!), the pork braised in coke or something, and the tofu. Everything just melts in my mouth and tastes so good. Even the tofu was wonderful, given that it has to compete with pork belly in my mouth. \n\nNow I don't think they make their own \"bao\", steamed or baked, from scratch.

The steamed ones are in what look to me like peking duck buns filled with yummy savory goodness (pork belly with pickled daikon or duck confit with mango salsa or chicken with bok choy and scallions...). So they are considerably smaller than their baked counterparts. The baked ones are about the size of a hamburger bun sliced in half and filled with the filling of your choice.

The least flavorful out of all of them but at least the meat wasn't chewy!\nGarlic Tofu w/ Greens: As a meat person, this vegetarian option surprised me! I think partly why the tofu was so good was because it was fried but also with its flavors and the sesame oil bok choy, it was the perfect combination of crisp. \nRed Sesame Chicken: Wow, that was such a kick of flavor! Chicken was good and really spicy! But it wasn't overwhelming... just the right amount of flavor balanced with some leafy greens.\nPork Belly with Pickled Daikon: the best one yet! Nice and tender and full of flavor with the slightest hint of spice. It was simply perfect.

So do yourself a favor and get TWO because it just works out in the end.  No, there is no discount if you get more.  Just saying.\n\nSo that's what I did.\n\nThe first was the pork belly and the second the Coca-Cola marinated.  Both with the steamed bun.  You can choose baked, but wtf?  A baked bun would really take away from the experience.  This is what I mean.  The steam buns fold nicely around the generous amount of meat and topping.  You get the right amount of each.  The topping is a slightly astringent pickle and parsley.  Respectively each complimenting the pork belly and Coca-Cola meats.  Both give a stunning presentation and contrast in flavors and textures.  Put the same combo in a baked bun?  Nah.\n\nCondiments?  Siracha and thingy cups.  But do yourself a favor.  The flavor combinations stand on their own.\n\nIf the meats are that good, I'm sure the tofu variant is probably just as good as well.", "author": "Hummer W."}

The baked is, as described on their menu: \"A large Asian dinner roll-shaped bun, baked with a light sugar glaze for a golden brown crust and a fluffy center.\" That is accurate. The steamed bun is a steamed bun; a staple of China's venerable history, now ubiquitous due to several years of success at Momofuku.  \n \nFirst, I wanted the duck - no duck this day; next, the tender pork belly with turmeric pickled daikon and green shiso (steamed bun); then, Coca-Cola braised pork with savoy cabbage and preserved yellow mustard seeds (baked bun); and finally, spicy chicken with toasted sesame pur\u00e9e, pickled carrots-cucumber, and cilantro (baked bun). \n\nThe long and short of it? Delicious is as delicious does; while I might quibble about occasional bites hewing toward too much sweetness, I will not do so today. However, once you've had an Asian-fusion bun of excellent quality (Mission Chinese used to), as far as the palate-memory knows (10 years ago at Momofuku), you've pretty much had them all - it is up to the imagination of the chef to distinguish his/her goodness from all the other goodness doing the same thing. Oft times simplicity is best, but man cannot live on one note (sweetened pickled veg), or one song (said veg with fill-in-the-blank Asian flavored protein), alone (on a Chinese bun). \n\nEat here and you will be happy to hum; but I promise no tears of pleasure.\n\nI'll be back.

They're shaped sort of like a taco shell and are made of white flour and have a fluffy but sweet taste to it. Chairman Bao offers their menu on either steamed or baked buns with the steamed buns being around $4 and baked being around $6+. The special I ordered was only available on a steamed bun though.\n\nNow I have no idea what confit is but the duck confit was amazing! Imagine skinless duck meat that has been hand pulled and compressed into a dense rectangular patty topped with just the right amount of sweet sauce and papaya salad.

At 1:15 there were still a dozen people in front of me, and things clearly were not moving along, so I asked my coworkers to put in my order and bring it back to the office for me, which they were kind enough to do. My meeting was done (at 2:00) before they got back. WTF?\n\nThe buns were tasty enough, but suffered from major issues with being too messy to eat easily; if I had been walking down the street trying to eat this food instead of sitting down, things probably would have been a disaster.\n\nChairman Bao, this is not how you run a food truck. It shouldn't take forty-five minutes to get to the head of the line and place your order, and then a further half hour to actually get said food. ESPECIALLY not when your menu offers all of six freaking items.

You can opt for a steamed bun which looks like a white pancake folded in two but stuffed with veggies and meat or you can order the baked bun which acts as a hamburger bun with the meat and veggies in between.

The soda marinate gave the pork a sweet and tasty flavor and the mustard seeds gave it a weird taste in a good way.  The pork belly bun was mediocre which may be due to either the quality of the pork or the skills of the cook.  The chicken is .... chicken.

I was one of those kids who stole all the steamed buns off the platter when the family ordered Peking Duck.  I was the kid who would ask to buy just steamed buns from Asian bakeries and markets, and gorge on about 5 just to ruin dinner.  So when I stumbled upon Chairman Bao at Eat Real 2010, I was kind of excited (a la kid in a candy store, but in my case, kid in a steamed bun store).\n\nThe first thing I noticed while waiting in the kind of long line, was the unique design and color scheme of the truck with the huge panda who I assume is Chairman Bao.  Walking slowly, step by step, mouth watering and stomach grumbling, I could not wait to eat some steamed buns.  Finally, upon reaching the front of the line, I had to order as much as I thought I could consume (and carry in one hand because the other hand had a beer in it), so I got a red sesame chicken, pulled pork and crispy tofu steamed buns.\n\nI got three knowing I would have to share with my fellow festival goers, so while walking around (and getting lost on purpose) looking for my group, I took bites out of all three.

If you're in the city a lot, I suggest hunting them down on other days where they camp out in front of various bars and shops because the line is shorter and that's always a good thing, cause girrrrrrl I'm ain't tryna wait foreva for my buns, I wants it NOW! If you must, go to OTG early or split up with friends and choose who has to be the unlucky one to wait in that super-long line while the rest of your crew roams around to check out other trucks haha.", "author": "Helen Z."}

I went earlier tonight and it was good enough to warrant a same-night review :)\n\n$3.75 for the steamed bun. It includes: delicious, buttery-soft chunks of pork belly and crispy, pickled daikon sandwiched between a pillow-soft white bun. \n\nIt was DELICIOUS. An explosion of flavors in my mouth. The fattiness of the pork belly contrasted so well with the sharp flavor of the daikon. Yes, the pork buns are expensive. But yes, they are so, SO worth it. \n\nThe sounds kind of weird, but the flavor of the daikon reminded me of the flavor of the slaw at Bakesale Betty's. And the bun reminded me of the buns on the famous pork buns at Ippudo Ramen in NYC (so, so good as well!). I definitely want to return to try their other buns/menu items.", "author": "Anita C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-22", "description": "The whole concept of trucks is so unique to the bay area. It seems there are hundreds of these running around and I'm not sure why, but I always associate them with cheap, good food. \n\nThe good part is correct, the cheap part isn't. \n\nOn one of my days off, I was craving for a couple of these. Granted I'd never had them before, but god the pictures and descriptions were tantalizing enough. Plus given the innumerable delicious options in SF I've rarely found the need to repeat any visit to any restaurant, barring a couple (mainly due to proximity to my place).\n\nSo, I got on twitter, stalked Chairman Truck's account, and found out they were near the Market/Castro area for the night. As I walked there I was contemplating my choices (and hoping there weren't any lines I had to deal with) I love that they only have a few. Makes life a lot easier. Given that I didn't exactly understand the portions, I tried two things, one steamed and one baked. And my choices were the Baked Spicy Chicken Puree with toasted sesame puree, pickled carrots-cucumber and cilantro and steamed crispy miso cured tofu with garlic-tofu mayo and baby boy chum.\n\nIf you want bigger portions, baked is the way to go. If you want more bite-sized portions, then steamed is your go to choice. My favorite of the two was hands down the baked spicy chicken. It wasn't bite sized, perfectly done, the spices were balanced, and the hot sauce I had it with made it one of the best baos I've ever had. I wouldn't say this is incredibly authentic, but who cares when it's so damn good?! I hear the pork belly bao is amazing. Next time I get a craving that will be the one I'll be trying. \n\nThe tofu was good, but not nearly as satisfying and it paled in comparison to the chicken. And lastly, the bao they use is great. Perfectly buttered. Get 1 (or 10) and be happy :)", "author": "Aditi R."}

I had visions of a long line, slow service and then learning that they ran out what I wanted just as I placed my order.  The line moved quickly, a printed receipt was given at the order window and your number is called from the pick up window when the food is ready (the wait for the food and shaved ice wasn't long - 5 minutes?)  I was still admiring Chairman Bao's red & black bun truck, wondering if they sold t-shirts and had stickers or pins, when my number was called.  They had three people inside to take orders and payment and assemble orders.  The truck had a few bottles of srichaca outside.  \n\nThe menu is short - 6 types of bun fillings that you can have on a baked bun ($5.75) or steamed bun ($2.75): pork belly, sesame chicken, lion's head meatball, Chinese sausage & egg, garlic tofu, duck confit.  They also have four types of shaved ice.  Meal deals are $9 + tax (one baked bun + shaved ice drink OR two steamed buns + shaved ice drink).\n\n* Ginger lychee shaved ice: Firm slivers of lychee jelly sit atop a mound of finely shaved ice and chewy tapioca pearls at the bottom. I enjoyed the various textures, the tartness, and the subtle ginger taste.  I thought with all that ice, it would taste too watered down but that didn't happen.  \n* Lion's head meatballs with fresh kimchee steamed bun: The steamed bun is folded over the filling, almost like a taco.  The bun was fluffy, smooth and nice.  The meatballs were tender and good but the napa cabbage kimchee wasn't crunchy at all (ick) and they added a salty brown sauce (hoisin?) that wasn't necessary or complementary.  I wouldn't get it again unless they improve that soggy kimchee and remove that sauce.\n* Pork belly with pickled daikon steamed bun: Yummy, the same excellent steamed bun, a thick slab of luscious, moist five spice pork belly, thin, crunchy rounds of sweet yellow daikon and a bit of onion mixed in.  The daikon was fine but not special.\n\nThe buns are small but that pork belly bun is delicious and I'm also a fan of the shaved ice drinks.\n\nCash only.", "author": "Lolia S."}

I showed up at around 4:30ish and of all the trucks present Bao had by far the longest line. As it got later the line got longer and longer so I was glad to get there early. \n\nI only got one bun there, the pork belly on steamed bun and it was fantastic. The bun was soft and sweet, the pork belly was fatty and had a nice salty flavor. The pickle daikon and vegetable provided a nice refreshing sour crunch to go with the soft chewy texture of the bun and meat. \nThrow in some siracha and you have an item that combines 4 distinct flavors into one delicious snack.\n\nThe main reason that I can't give Chairman Bao a 5/5 is because of the price. At 3.75 for a steamed bun and 6+ for a baked bun, you just don't get much food for how much you pay. The buns are quite small and to get a full meal you would have to buy 3+. \n\nHowever, the food is good enough to warrent buying a bun just because it tastes so good.

Doors opened around 6 and, after the opening acts, it was finally time for Mos. Now, like a typical star, he didn't come out right when it was his turn to perform. Instead, he decided to take his sweet ass time and make the crowd wait... and wait... and wait... Things got so bad that the MCs had to resort to holding an impromptu freestyle rapping competition a la 8 Mile between guys who were convinced they could flow, but were in fact really terrible. But that's another story. \n\nAnyway, as the crowd got increasingly restless and began to throw things at the MCs on stage and started chanting \"refund!\" Mos finally came out and performed. The crowd went crazy and by the end of the show, all was forgiven and everyone left satisfied.\n\nWhy do I tell you this story? Because that was basically my experience with Chairman Bao. Being one of the more well known food trucks in the Bay Area, Bao's reputation precedes itself. I first encountered Bao at SJ Eats aka \"Let's Try and See How Many People We Can Cram Into One Condensed Area Before They Want To Kill Themselves.\" While all the other trucks had been open for a good 30 minutes, Bao was still not open, but a sizable line had formed. I decided to skip out on Bao that day, but we would meet again the next week at Off the Grid. \n\nTrucks began opening by 5pm, but Bao was again taking its time. A line again started to form in great anticipation and this time my gf and I got in it because when you see a line start to form, you naturally just get in it because you don't want to miss out, right? Anyway, after all the other trucks opened for business, an Off the Grid staff member knocked on the Bao door and told them to get moving and open up. They obliged.... kind of. They opened their windows, but still weren't actually taking orders yet. We could see the workers inside prepping food... and you knew they could see the line that was waiting on them as well. \n\nFinally, probably a good 20 minutes after they had been told to open up, they started taking orders. And, like my Mos Def experience, after you eat their buns, you sort of forget that they made you sit there and wait and wait and wait. After trying five or six different places that day, it was clear that Bao has something unique. A little pricey? Perhaps. But you really can't get their style of bun anywhere else. \n\nAnyway, let's recap. Chairman Bao: kind of a diva, but worth the price of admission.", "author": "Eddie L."}

American (hamburger) and Asian (lion's head meat ball, and pork belly) foods together. It's like adapting and being able to create something that maybe the hipsters would like to eat. \n\nI still think food truck food should not be at such a high price. $9 for buns and a drink? I know this is \"gourmet\" or whatever but come on. There are way better Chinese buns out there.

It was neither.. the daikon on it was nice. \n\nThe Duck had a stem of some plant in it.. and a small bone.. -_- stem must have dropped into the truck while they were prepping or something. \n\nI think the one i liked most was probably the pulled pork for the dressing on the salad/coleslaw. I felt like the buns were nothing special (maybe because i grew up on fresh baked bbq pork buns)..so the steamed one would have been more interesting with these ingredients. \n\nPineapple Salted Caramel. It was quite tart! I couldn't pick up the salted caramel part. But i did pick up on the ginger. \n\nOverall it's a nice try, colorful truck, interesting presentation of ingredients and drinks.

Even after deconstructing the sandwich and examining it, I can't explain it. There's something about the texture of the tofu itself. \nEven when it's frozen, then defrosted and cooked, while the texture changes, it's not like this.\n\nIf I could make tofu taste this yummy, I'd make it this way all the time!\n\nPartly it's the crispy crunch in the char-grilled exterior, partly its the creamy, not mushy inner part, but that's not all of it.\nMaybe it's the seasonings in the accompanying slaw. Maybe it's the slightly sweet baked bun (and the sweeter steamed, pillowy one).\n\nAll I know is, the sum is greater than the parts.\n\nSince I'm gluten-free, I tasted the buns (both steamed and baked) for research purposes, after downing some digestive enzymes. Then I transferred the insides of the sandwich to gluten free bread. BIG mistake. \nHad to put them back where they belonged to get the full enjoyment.\n\nIt's the whole package together that makes any later agonies of digestive and respiratory reaction to the gluten totally worth it.

I've tried the Pork Belly, Braised Pork, and the new Sesame Chicken--all delicious, but the Pork Belly, hands down the best of the three.\n\nMy only gripe is that the lines at these events for Chairman Bao can get kind of long, but once you get your order in, it doesn't take too long for them to call your name. Though compared to other trucks, it doesn't take the most out of your pocket, but $3.75 for steamed buns and around $6 for the baked buns (which I've yet to try) is a bit pricey for the size of the buns.  But again, if you don't hit up these trucks too often, it's nice to spend a bit more for some tasty food.  \n\nIf you haven't it's definitely a must try.

If you get the pork belly, just know what you're getting into. It's greasy and fattening which makes it so delicious and they give you giant, generous pieces.

I did enjoy the bun itself. \n\nFor the steamed ($3.75), I got it with pulled pork with savory cabbage and preserved mustard seeds. I liked the meat of the pulled pork - it flavorful and not dry. I liked the cabbage, but the mustard seeds were bitter so if I took a wrong bite I'd get a shooting splurge of bitterness. \n\nNext time I'd probably give their other buns a try before settling on a favorite. \n\nIf you know where they are going to be and plan on going, I'd go early because the lines will start forming.", "author": "Lang T."}

Otherwise, the mango salad on top of the bun is refreshing and counters the spice nicely.\n\nThe pork belly was heavenly.  Yes, it is fattening, but it is also true that the pickled daikon helps add a nice crunch and flavor to the pork belly.  If you think you're going to feel guilty ordering the pork belly because you worked out this morning, don't order it.

Chairman truck was still closed but had roughly 5 to 7 people waiting in line for it to open.  My husband was a little skeptical saying how well does a bao feed someone.  The guy in front of us turned around and said, \"You got to try the food here, especially the pork bellies.\"  He gave us his tip to buy the steamed baos and buy at least 3 to fill you up. He was spot on.  The steamed baos were so good.  I had one Pork Belly Bao with Turmeric Pickled Daikon and Green Shiso, one Coca-Cola Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage & Preserved Yellow Mustard Seeds, and one Spicy Chicken with Toasted Sesame Pur\u00e9e, Pickled Carrots-Cucumber & Cilantro. Wow, all three blew me away.  The pork belly bao was my favorite, since it was tender pork belly and the seasoning was very tasty. My second favorite was the spicy chicken. This bao had a little kick to it but it was not over-powering.  The Coca-Cola Braised Pork bao was also very tasty and I enjoyed all three.  My husband got three Crispy Miso Cured Tofu with Garlic-Tofu Mayo & Baby Choy Sum and he loved the bun and the flavors of the miso cured tofu.

I finally had the chance to grab a bite on my day off at work.\n\nI arrived early, about 11:45am, but apparently that wasnt early enough to snatch the highly sought after pork belly bun with daikon.  The line was minimal and picked up by 12:15.\n\nI ended up getting two of each of the following steamed buns; Duck confit with mango slices, braised Berkshire pork with savoy cabbage and preserved mustard seed, and spicy sesame chicken with pickled carrots.  \n\nAll of them had a great balance between savory, and sour-y.\nMy fav meat might have been the pork....it's oh so tender.\nThe duck confit also had wonderful flavor.  The chicken had a spicey kick but not to strong.  The buns are soft, I'm not sure if they are house made or from a vendor but they taste authentic.\nI also ordered the pina colada matcha which was freakin sour! It doesn't pair to well with the buns imo.  It's way to soury, the buns have enough acidity imo.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased and will try again so I can order a porky belly bun.  Good stuff. also one of my fav artist, James Jean did the truck art. sweeet!", "author": "Alan B."}

The pork was tasty and tender. The huge mustard seeds were interesting...\n\nSteamed:\nRed Sesame Chicken - I loved it! The chicken was very flavorful and the chopped pieces of bok choy was a nice touch.\nCrispy Garlic Tofu - This was pretty good. Probably the most tasty tofu I've had in a while, but the texture was a bit too mushy for me.\nAlso Pulled Pork\n\nI really enjoyed the buns and will come back for more!

The bao bun truck is generous on bun to meat/fat ratio, but at the end of the day that much fat shouldn't cost that much. \n\nWhat I found delicious though was the $3.50 mango matcha green tea drink. Not too sweet and full of different colors and textures.  I highly recommend everyone to try these concoctions. I almost feel like these refreshments should be the truck's stronger selling point! \n\nThat said, I'm glad I tried this truck and would probably eat the food again, minus having to wait the 20 minute for my pork fat on a bun combo.", "author": "Laura H."}

My two favorites are the steamed pork belly and the spicy chicken. I prefer the steamed to the bake, but they are all great. The steamed are smaller so order 2.

Nonetheless, on to the review!\n\nFOOD: 4 stars.  I have tried the tender Pork Belly, Crispy Tofu, Coca Cola Pork, and the Spicy Chicken (basically all except for the Duck Confit). For some reason the Duck Confit Bao is always sold out when I go to the truck, I blame being responsible and attending class. All of the options (for the most part) are delicious and the combinations are just genius! \n   -Crispy Miso Cured Tofu: MY FAVORITE! I am always on-and-off vegetarian, and this option is my go-to regardless of what kind of food-restrictions I have. \n   -Tender Pork Belly: MY other FAVORITE! The tender pork belly is what I wished bacon tasted like and the daikon's slight acidity cuts the some of the fatty qualities that pork belly has. \n   -Coca-Cola Braised Pork: It is like Asian carnitas. \n   -Spicy Chicken: Even though this is my least favorite, it does not mean they taste bad...I just prefer others. The spice level is mild, so it is suitable for most taste palettes. \n   For all the options, you can choose between baked or steamed buns; both have a soft & fluffy texture with a hint of sweetness. I recommend steamed, they are like....chubby tacos? \n\nPRICE: 4 stars. I feel so wrong thinking that The Chairman Truck is a tad overpriced since nothing on the menu is over $7. Steamed buns are $3.25- $3.75 and if I go food truck-ing on an empty stomach, I can't just order one... at least two... maybe three? These baos are no where near as inexpensive as a Chinese Bakery, but to some extent The Chairman's baos are worth it. \n\nFinal Words: If you spot The Chairman Truck, do stop by and pick up a bao or two. I recommend the Crispy Tofu and/ or the Tender Pork Belly.", "author": "Thank Y."}

Finally the star aligned where I was free to make a decent walk for lunch and the Chairman was kind enough to post itself within striking distance.\n\nWith a head full of anticipation and expectations, I walked nearly a mile and climbed a few steep blocks on California to reach Chairman Bao.  I decided to gorge and go for the baked bun combo meal + an extra steamed bun for variety.  This meant a baked bun with pork belly as well as a steamed bun with chicken.\n\nThe pork belly sandwich was great.  Keeping it simple, it went without any fancy sauce and stuck to the basics of pickled daikon along with fatty, yet flavorful slices of pork belly.  Nomalicious to say the least.\n\nThe red sesame chicken w/ scallion and bok choy can be likened to korean spicy chicken.  It had a similar flavor and crunch from the greens and was smothered in spicy sauce.  \n\nThe buns in itself were good and of high quality, assuming they were bought from a legit Chinese bakery.  To top it off, I had a lychee ginger shaved ice drink that was uber refreshing.  \n\n4 very solid stars and the only reason it doesn't get 5 is because, for some reason, I just wasn't blown away.  This could be due to the high expectations or 2 months of anticipation, but it was simply very delicious, rather than amazing.

Everything complemented one another:  the perfectly shredded cabbage, the succulent pork, the magical sauce, the sturdy bun.  I was stuffed after one bun so I had the chicken bun for dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-22", "description": "First time I ate here, I can truly say the idea was original and the food was great even the tofu. This could also be due to the fact it was the Sactomofo event where we waited for three hours in the sun. In my previous review, I had a gripe about how the prices were more at the event after I noticed the price menu that was posted on yelp. I took back my words and apologized after a chairman bao rep wrote back and explained that the prices were old and that they were unable to take down posted pictures on yelp. \n\nReturning yesterday for the Sactomofo 4 event, I decided to show my support by starting my food truck tour with you first instead of the much talked about Nom Nom truck. After waiting a much appreciated one hour only in line, my mind was made up and determined to get one of those pink boxes displayed on the pickup window. When I asked the girl from the order window how many comes in the pink box, I was told it depends on how much I order. Because of her reply, I ordered one of everything baked and steamed and then asked if that was enough to get me the pink box. Ecstatic from her sales pitch, she proudly confirmed that I would be one of the few to be \"looking cool\" walking around with their exclusive box. However, my food were packed in three plain dull beige looking boxes. When asked why it's not packed in the pink designed box, I was told that they don't \"give those away\" and that it was \"bolted down\". Frustrated, I told him I would not have ordered that much if I wasn't able to get the box and that I was told by the cashier girl that I would. Without an apology, his only response to me was \"you wanted the box\"? \n\nTalking about customer service. I don't know you do it up there in s.f. but our local food trucks appreciate the businesses they receive here in Sac. Food trucks cannot legally operate in Sacramento but us foodies show full support to the food truck industry largely due to their food and their appreciation to us patrons. For someone who is well respected in the industry such as yourself, it is shameful that you are using sleezy sales pitch to get more orders in. I expect lies from salespeople, but never thought a food truck would operate in the same way. The food may have been good the first time around, but the tasteless way how you handled it this time around left a bad taste. I should've demanded a refund and not even accept the food but out of respect for the event I said my peace and angrily accepted it walked away. My face may be covered on yelp but I wasn't being anonymous when I was yelling about ur lies in front of everyone. No food is worth a bad unapologetic service, especially from a small business owner.", "author": "Minh C."}

I was pretty excited to see them at OTG:  Upper Haight last Thursday after having missed them right outside my office at lunch time.  And so I didn't mind having to wait in line for the 15 or so minutes for the 2 buns I ordered.  But just like how some of their reviews are great and some are not, that's exactly what I experienced.  First off, I got a pork belly bun cuz my coworker said it was DEE-LICIOUS...and you know, it was pretty good.  It had lots of flavor and the toppings complimented each other.  The second bun I got was their St. Paddy's Day special made with pork shoulder.  I gotta say, I wasn't impressed.  In fact, I had buyer's remorse.  Haha.  Unlike the pork belly, the pork shoulder was dry and bland and was a poor comparison to the other I just had.    So yeah, take what you will from this review.  There's obviously other items on their menu, but in a situation like Off The Grid where there's a lot of people and several other choices and trucks to eat from, I doubt I'd line up again just for the one bao and I'd be wary of trying anything else unless I read a really good review about it.", "author": "Joe M."}

Luckily we beat the crowd and I tried both the steamed buns with pork belly and braised pork.\nI'll be the first to admit that there is a lot of hype surrounding food trucks as a whole, but the first bite into the pork belly bun left a stupid, greasy smile on my face. It was melt-in-your-mouth tender and tasty. It matched perfectly with the fresh, fluffy bun and the crisp coleslaw/daikon. I didn't expect much as much for the braised pork, but it was equally as juicy and well-marinated. Pork is easily overcooked, but apparently the Chairman can avoid that. I was also very impressed that while both buns were similar in content, they were both very flavorful and different in their own way. You know that everything isn't just slathered on with the same sauce and thrown on the bun, but there is actual thought to the menu. Awesome.\nThe biggest downfall is that they are pricey for what they are. $3.75 for the steamed bun (essentially the kind that looks like a taco that goes with peking duck) and $6.00 for the baked bun (resembles a giant cha siu bao, I presume). \nBut believe the hype and try it.", "author": "Jen T."}

Plenty of duck, not under-seasoned or overcooked, with the mango salad for a bit of a contrast (but there were only 3 slices of mango in my bun).

Today I sampled a couple of sliders from The Chairman.\n\nI have to say that at $3.75 each these are comparatively teeny sliders.  Usually I'm good for a four bite min on a slider, but the two I ordered were gone in about two and a half.\n\nFirst up, the Miso marinated 'crispy' tofu with bok choy.  The flavors of the tofu and bok choy were nice but not quite bold enough to stand out from the steamed bun.  Also the tofu wasn't very crispy, in fact it was only remotely crispy on one side.  So I had mostly bun with some bok choy and a tiny slice of tofu that was basically the same texture as the bun.  I think this could be really delicious if it were done properly.\n\nSecond, a spicy shredded chicken with a delicious crispy carrot relish.  The spiciness of this one held up well and was a great compliment to the sweet sticky bun.

Now what can I do with $4?!?! I could donate it to charity. I could buy 4 cans of soda. I could have gotten a side of kim-chee to go with my rice plate at Seoul on Wheels. But then I saw the big panda bear and decided to take a look at the menu, and I saw the bargain price of $3.75 for a pork belly taco! \n\nWithin 2 minutes, I was served with a piping hot and tender pork belly, wedged between a bun with pickled daikon on top. The daikon gives a crunch that contrasts with the tenderness of the pork belly. Did I mention how tender the pork belly meat was? \n\nOn the other hand, the bun was so small. It was probably half the size of a BBQ Pork bun you'd get at a Chinese dim sum place. Yes, yes I know, this is NOT a dim sum spot and we are NOT in Chinatown, but with a truck that clearly reminds you of China (red colors, a panda, a name resembling Mao Zedong) we cannot help but think we'd get some \"Chinese\" out of this joint i.e. cheap prices and big portions. \n\nWas it good? You betcha. Was it expensive? Although on a Yelping price range you would give it a single dollar sign ($), if I was to have a full lunch out of Chairman Bao's menu selection, I would probably be dropping at least $15. Mind you this is a food truck! \n\nBut based on the quality ingredients and the taste/flavor, it is definitely worth a try. It was a great \"snack\" while I was waiting for my BBQ Rice Plate from the other truck. (I am going to stop plugging for that aforementioned food truck, if you want to learn more, type them into the yelp search box above). \n\nIn any event, based on the quick and friendly service (+1 star), delicious food (+1 star), use of a panda as your logo (+1 star), and most importantly the funky ass name of \"Chairman Bao\" (+2 stars!!!), I would have given you a 5-star rating. But alas the small portion for my bun for the slightly premium price makes me have to deduct one star (-1 star). Therefore if my math is correct, that gives Chairman Bao a 4-star rating and I am pretty sure I will be back for more of that delicious pork belly.", "author": "Kevin L."}

There was nothing wrong with the bun, taste wise, but it wasn't anything special either.  Luckily, I had no wait, so perhaps that's why there's two stars in my review rather than one.  The big problem with the bun was the price.  $3.25 for what was a two bite snack is nuts.  At $1.50, I'd probably give the bun a 3 or 4 star, so this rating is really more about the value than the quality of the food.  Also, perhaps the meat buns are better/worth the price.

The pork and duck which I both tried tasted the same and the stuff that came with it like lettuce with mustard seeds or the red pickled onions were alright. I doused my buns with sriracha. It's definitely fusion and far from being anything Chinese. I knew it was fusion but I thought it would be an enhancement to the Chinese dish with more flavor but keeping close to the real thing.

The bun itself was small and dainty but the crispy garlic-infused tofu cutlet was the size of a cell phone! It came loaded on top with fresh (collard?)greens that had been tossed in a miso dressing. The best part was the greens included the leaves AND the stems. It was messy to eat and I probably looked totally awesome wiping miso off my face after stuffing it with tofu, but it was so worth it.

I tried the pork belly in both the steamed bun and baked bun, and the coca cola braised pork in a steamed bun.\n The Pork belly is definitely delectable, and the neon yellow slices of pickled daikon provide a splash of color and cut some of the richness of the belly. The cola pork was just okay.\n I love Chinese steamed buns, but they're really best eaten right out of the bamboo steamer basket. They're like fluffy pillows when they're still warm. I'm not sure, but the texture and temperature of the Chairman's bao suggests to me the buns aren't being steamed on the truck, which is too bad or maybe that's good, cause otherwise I'd eat too many of them.

We live in Redwood City and go to Belmont special for this Off the Grid.  On Monday, I picked up my very active 2 year old from daycare and headed to Off The Grid for this food truck.  Upon arrival, they were not open yet and there was one person in front of me.  She ordered and received her food before I even ordered. Keep in mind that I'm 6.5 months pregnant and it was boiling hot and I was with a cranky 2 year old.  It took almost 10 minutes before they took my order due to computer issues, which is fine.  I placed my order for the same thing we always get.  They gave it to me and I rushed back to my car to get home as my 2 year old was pretty restless at this point.  When I got home ready to eat. I saw that they gave me the wrong order.  So, my husband went back there to get a refund.  By the time he would have got home, it would be an hour later and being pregnant, I cannot wait that long to eat when I'm hungry or I'll get sick.  When my husband arrived there for the refund they were extremely rude to him and blamed me for ordering the wrong thing and for picking up someone else's order.  How could I pick up someone else's order when there was only one person in front of me and she already got her food?

After trying the bao at Momofuku and Baohaus in New York, the SF versions are falling flat.  First of all, the steamed buns are store bought.  Secondly, the fillings are not flavorful.  The pork belly was just unappetizing thin, chewy, gray slices of smoked bacon.  The egg and sausage, lions head meatballs, duck confit were just bad.  Especially the confit - the duck was bone dry and lacked any gamey flavor.  The only reason I am giving the Chairman a star is because the chicken bun with spinach and kim chee was tasty.", "author": "Monica L."}

Now, I haven't eaten a lot of pork belly, but I definitely know one thing. It's a damn good thing this is not a Sacramento-based truck. If it was, I would be getting a triple bypass within the next year or two.\n\nIn addition to the pork belly steamed bun, (can't fathom tackling the slightly larger baked version...) I put away a tofu steamed bun. I guess it was my attempt to counteract the godlike, sweet, delicious fat with something I guesstimated to be healthier. While I'm not sure my health logic was at all sound, (the tofu is grilled to the level of awesome) the tofu is probably a dark horse, and I feel it needs some props. It's not your run-of-the-mill tofu, because this has had some serious make out action with a grill after getting itself all sauced up. If I was a vegetarian, I would eat these for breakfast. And possibly those other meals as well. The bok choy is delicious, and the combination of sauces create notes of umami that take my brain into sushi-esque territory. (I could envision myself grabbing some of these suckers paired with a bottle of sake cloaked in a paper bag, running through the streets of The Bay like some kind of crazy gourmet gutter punk.)\n\nSo yeah, pork belly bun is deserving of all of its praise. It may *seem* a little dry at first, but the fact it's cloaked in heavenly fat is going to clear that right up. Get it on a steamed bun, as that will help also. Get several (they are cheap!) if you're going to gripe about size.\n\nBut... I have a feeling that every single bun this place produces is extraordinarily good. Your preference is probably simply a trivial opinion. This is gourmet level stuff from a freaking truck. No dress code, no reservations, none of that. But this stuff is every bit as legit.

My son doesn't like veg so I ordered one without but the meat itself was still quite tasty.\n-red sesame chicken on baked bun- a bit spicy for my taste but the meat was flavorful\n-crispy garlic tofu on steamed bun- I actually Really enjoyed this one. the tofu had a really nice garlic flavor and I liked the firm, chewy texture of the tofu inside the bun. The greens added a nice crispy contrast.\n\nOverall, I was happy with everything we had.\nGo again? Definitely would go again. I prefer the steamed buns so would probably just order all steamed next time.", "author": "J L."}

I had the pork belly, and all it had was a chintzy thin piece of pork belly overwhelmed by the puffy bun.  I felt deeply unsatisfied.  It should have been a thick, unguent, succulent piece of pork belly.  If you want to try what I am thinking of, go to one of the Momofukus in NYC and try theirs.

With the addition of the hoisin sauce and daikon made it the perfect combination. While my husband thought the pork was too fatty, I thought it was succulent. I'll be back for more.", "author": "Isabella L."}

It seems like it would be ultra oily and fatty like most people have been saying about pork belly, however, I did not find this to be true.  IN fact, I find this less fatty/oily than a regular hamburger or a bbq pork bun from dim sum place. The meat they use in the buns is actually quite lean and good quality pork/chicken.  I had the pleasure of trying the pork belly, cocacola braised pork and spicy chicken.  I have to say the spicy chicken was actually my favorite one!  I loved all the sauces and pickles they added to the bun, made all the flavors mash together well.  The tofu (though onlyhad a small taste was good as well but not crunchy enough for me.  Three small steamed buns is enough for lunch.. the baked a little large to me and also more expensive.. not really worth the almost $6 per bun in my opinion.", "author": "Margie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-20", "description": "Thanks to Chairman Bao Bun Truck for supporting Sunday Streets volunteers - and thus giving me access to their little bundles of pillowy, juicy, sweet and salty heaven. \n\nThe staff people were really friendly, and the food was ready really fast - within a minute or two of ordering. I had two steamed buns - \"crispy garlic tofu\"  and \"tender pork belly with pickled daikon.\" I didn't have to pay for them and wasn't even thinking about what they should cost - but they were really, really good. Instead of the buns (bao) you'd get at dim sum, that have the filling cooked into the middle, these buns are folded over the fillings, like a puffy white taco or a sandwich. I assume this is what makes it possible to have them be both freshly cooked and fast. So, maybe not the traditional presentation, but the ingredients seemed similar (higher quality meat than most of what I've had in restaurant or store-bought buns), and the texture of the bun seemed identical to the traditional ones. \n\nThe buns themselves were perfect - tender and pillowy, a little bit sweet, and the right size to hold the filling. I was pretty hungry, so I was eating fast and taking big bites - I think it took me 6-8 bites to finish each one, plus the scooping up of fallen ingredients, and the satisfied licking of fingers. \n\nThe crispy garlic tofu was as advertised - crispy (but not swimming in oil), with plenty of sauteed greens (bok choy maybe?) and a very tasty, garlicky sauce that was the consistency of creamy salad dressing. I could taste the greens and the tofu and the bun, so the sauce wasn't overpowering; the overall combination was a nice blend of flavors and textures. Not particularly spicy, and the garlic flavor is not strong until you're done eating.\n\nThe tender pork belly with pickled daikon was also good, though a bit more prone to falling out of the bun as one eats (perhaps I was chowing down too fast, though). The pork belly was tasty and went really well with the pickled daikon; together they were more sweet than salty/savory, and yes, tender and juicy.", "author": "Kate H."}

After ordering the pork belly and sesame chicken steamed buns from the girl in the truck, i stood aside with all the other hungry patrons and patiently waited for my buns. When they finally called my order number, I almost jumped for joy. Opening the paper tray, I knew I was in for a treat! The aroma of the fatty pork belly along with the spices of the chicken was so mind numbingly good that I wanted drop my bags and sit on the sidewalk with everyone else and wolf them down. Of course my bf wanted to wait till we got home first so I reluctantly agreed(he drove). 30 mins later and 10x hungrier I finally got to take my first bite, and I swear I heard my taste buds sing, or dance, or both. Not only was it absolutely delicious, but the bun held its form and texture. Translation: They were NOT soggy! So fluffy and soft, like a cloud. Not a rain cloud, but a happy one on a sunny day.
