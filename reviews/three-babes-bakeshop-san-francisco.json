The cherry pie was loaded with fruit, not overly sweet, and with none of the gummy cornstarchy filling that sometimes appears in cherry pies. The buttermilk (my fave) was similarly not overly sweet, with a \"just right\" consistency. I would have preferred more berries, but that was solved by putting more fresh berries on top of the pie. \nThank you, Three Babes. By the way, they also supplied the pies for our daughter's wedding on Memorial Day weekend, 2017 -- they were terrific and disappeared as soon as they were served. \nThe pies are made from locally-sourced ingredients, are delivered super-fresh (thank you, GOOD EGGS!) and simply made everyone happy.", "author": "Meryl S."}

The hands-down favorite of the group was the key lime pie but I didn't get a slice. My favorite was the strawberry blackberry crumble which I went traditional ala mode. So nostalgically comforting to warm up a slice of pie and add a scoop of old fashion vanilla ice cream on it. Tartness of the berries against the sweet ice cream. Yum! Also tried some of the bittersweet chocolate pecan and it's rich - almost a fudge-like filling if that's your thing. \n\nThey also have gluten-free and vegan options if you pre-order but otherwise feel free to pick up a sweet treat to share in the Ferry Building.", "author": "Jon L."}

We had confirmation stating that the pies will arrive between 11am - 1:00pm. Guess what? They didn't come until almost 3 pm. One of my colleagues had to call to confirm the status of our pies. But had we not call them, will they have been proactive and call us to tell them they're running late? This all comes down to the customer service experience, and ours was not a good one. Especially when you have 200 employees asking about the arrival time and we weren't able to provide any answers since the Bakeshop failed to communicate in a prompt manner.\n\nI thought the pies were mediocre. I tried the key lime, bourbon pecan, chocolate pecan, and blueberry crumble. The pies were all overly sweet and tasted no better than something I could've bought at a grocery store.

I'm very glad we did.\n\nThe pies themselves are uniformly beautiful and delicious, but that seems to be pretty well covered in the reviews already available here so I won't deal with that much.\n\nAs we were planning our wedding, I happened to stop at a coffee shop where the bakery had set up a table to sell their pies.  This was my first introduction to Three Babes, and the slice I had was so good that I decided to see whether they do weddings. They do. We called and set up a tasting, which amounts to picking up from the farmer's market a bag filled with mini slices of each of their pies.  It was a great way to spend an afternoon.\n\nFor our wedding, we ordered two of each of their available flavors, and they were all wonderful.  The pies on offer vary a bit by season because they use fresh, local ingredients, which is nice.  They also offer a ton of flexibility for various dietary restrictions (gluten free, vegan, or both).  The bakery recommended an amount of pie and we ordered extra to be safe, which turned out to be a mistake. Their recommendation was spot on.  (\"Mistake\" is not quite the right word, because the only downside is that we now have several delicious pies in our freezer.)\n\nThe company was also really great to work with throughout the whole process from the tasting through the wedding.  While wedding cake places need weeks or months of advance notice, the bakeshop only needed a few days.  (Unsolicited wedding planning advice from someone that got married one time: whenever possible, choose vendors that aren't part of the wedding industrial complex.)  The bakeshop delivered the pies, pre-cut, to our venue in the city at no cost.  \n\nWe would highly recommend buying pies from Three Babes, whether for a wedding or any other occasion where you want delicious pie.", "author": "Andrew B."}

I got a slice of key lime, and even an hour before they closed up shop at the Ferry Building Farmers' Market, it was still well-chilled and in good shape. Their key lime pie is dense and set more like a cheesecake, which was surprisingly creamy. I even loved the lime zest on top. Zested peels always taste bitter to me, but they put the perfect amount on for color.\n\nMy friend got the banana cream pie and told herself she'd save it for later, but couldn't resist finishing it off once she tasted it. I actually asked someone to go buy me a second slice after I'd left the farmers' market, but Three Babes was all packed up by the time they got there. If I worked in an office around the area, you bet I'd order their pies for any and every staff potluck.\n\n$6 seems pricey to spend on a slice of pie, but as a baker myself, I know how hard it is to make some of the baked goods we take for granted. Laminating dough and perfecting pie crust is time-consuming! Besides, they offset some of that by giving you their buy 10, get 1 stamp card.", "author": "Gwen W."}

I was in charge of dessert for Thanksgiving so the impulsiveness in me goes \"Oh! I'll have one Classic Apple Pie please!\" and hands over my credit card without asking how much my apple pie cost. Checked my email an hour later and I got a receipt for a $40 pie! The most expensive pie I've have ever bought. So I thought, let's go big or go home! I went out and bought three pints of Three Twins Ice Cream to go with my Three Babes Apple Pie because it was just too perfect that way. Dessert costed me $50 this Thanksgiving but it was all worth it!\n\nI don't normally eat apple pie but if it's served a-la-mode, I'm all over it! Heated up the pie in the oven and loaded mine up with vanilla bean ice cream and the first thing I noticed when I took a bite was how thick, dense, yet flaky the crust was! I don't think I've ever had apple pie with such a good tasting crust. It was buttery, warm and so flaky. The filling was also a perfect consistency, the filling didn't fall out when I served the pie!\n\nThey use seasonal, organically-grown produce, from local farms in California. Their pies are all hand made and they have so many varieties of pies with fruits, nuts, custard, cream and savory. So many choices! $40 is pricey for a 10 inch pie, but it think it's worth it for special occasions.", "author": "Janny S."}

Of course I asked what their most unusual pie was and was suggested their signature Salty Honey Walnut. $6 for what looked like 1/6 of a deep dish pie.\n\nSalty Honey Walnut ($6 slice)\n- Salted candied walnuts on top, giving an interesting taste combination of sweet and salty masking any bitterness from the walnuts.\n- Not overly sweet, but enough to give you a slight sugar burn at the back of the throat.\n- Amid the caramel flavour there is a slight eggy (?) flavour that sort of ruined this pie for me. Otherwise this is a tasty and interesting pie!\n\nThey really need to be positioned right next to some kind of juice stand for sheer convenience because after that much pie, you'll probably want a drink.\n\n$6 is pretty daunting to pay for a slab of pie, but all their pies are made from scratch. And the quantity you get makes a good breakfast or even light lunch, considering you can easily end up at a cafe paying $10+ for a boring omelette, and that's before tax, tip, and San Francisco Employee Mandate.\n\nTasty pies and a great deal.

Later that weekend, they emailed me and acknowledged that they might have seemed rude (uh, yes), they are just stressed because they've just recently had some bad experiences with weddings.  \n\nThis all made me nervous, but I perused their \"wedding guide\" anyway.

It was my first pecan pie, and will probably be the only one I eat from here on out.

I am not a huge sweets fan and I generally stay away from desserts because they are frequently too sweet for me. With that said, I'm OBSESSED with pie crust. I think it's so delicious, especially when its flaky and crusty and sprinkled with brown sugar and just has that touch of flavor from the pie filling. If I could eat pie crust all day, I'd weigh 200 lbs in 10 days. Serious.\n\nThree Babes Bakeshop, although in a random location in the \"backyard' of another restaurant, definitely came through in the pie crust category. I got the rhubarb pie with peaches and something of a mint variety and it was amazing. The pie wasn't too sweet, not too gooey and the crust was perfect. Just how I liked it. Their pies are pricey by the whole but not bad for a slice since a slice is quite hefty by itself. \n\nDefinitely recommend any of their fruit pies if you don't want it to be too sweet or their walnut pies if you're a sweets lover!", "author": "Lorrie M."}

Another Mission-based business but lacking a true brick-and-mortar \"Three Babes\" is actually a kickstarter funded concept from two young women from central California and although prices may run as high as $40 for a single pie the team's artisan work has undeniably earned a cult following and substantial accolades - the combination finding them sold out of one option while I nabbed the last slice of Chocolate Pecan just after 8:30am.  Verbose in words like all-natural, organic, and sustainable that are meaningful to many but no marker for 'taste' it was to the $12 toll of two slices that I partook in Anna and Lenore's baked goods and although the Chocolate Pecan was indeed delicious with flavors harkening a 'Turtle' candy it could not hold a candle to the signature Salty Honey Walnut - the buttery crust still flaky and crisp beneath an avalanche of toasty walnuts whose soft bitters found balance in local honey flecked with bits of sea salt - a truly remarkable pie tiptoeing the line between sweet and savory while wowing in every bite.", "author": "Michael U."}

I read they're always at the Ferry Building's Farmers Market every Saturday so I decided to check them out.\n\nThere were a number of pie flavors they were selling today, classic apple and Bourbon apple pie being among them. Being on this pie-craving kick since before pi day, I immediately ordered a slice of classic apple pie. \n\nThe slice of pie was $6 which seemed a little pricey, but maybe worth it. The pie was beautiful with a golden-brown crust and sprinkled raw(?) sugar. The apples weren't peeled so that was interesting. \n\nUpon taking a bite, I was immediately disappointed. The overwhelming lemon juice really took me out of the whole experience. All I tasted was the acid of lemon and not apples. Don't get me wrong, I love my citrus fruits but this was really too much. I also never heard of putting lemon juice in apple pie, is it to preserve the apples?\n\nThe apples weren't chewy or even somewhat crisp like most apple pies I've tasted. There also wasn't enough cinnamon, buttery goodness, sugar, and even caramel. Believe me, I'm not a hard pleaser when it comes to pie.

With an epic fail under my belt I decided to try out these \"babes\".\n\nTheir bakeshop is located in a little stall near the Stable coffee shop. Why does it sound like I'm talking about a some horse race track? You can pay either by cash or credit via iPhone. I was surprised to find out that I had to put down a $7 deposit for the glass pie dish.\n\nI wish they had put this fact on their website. So with just the pie it's $32-38; with pie dish it's $37-45. They pick up your pie dish the following weekend. If you ask nicely they might deliver you a pie when they pick up your pie dish. This glass pie dish might seem cumbersome for both customer and bakeshop yet I had no problems with this system.\n\nMy cherry rhubarb lattice pie looked absolutely gorgeous, golden brown with deep colored natural fruity filling. I ate this pie with my eyes. The pie is really delicious especially if you microwave your slice for twenty seconds. I was worried that they'd skimp on the fruit filling but it's really packed with plump juicy cherries and rhubarb. The crust is great. You can taste the butter and lard for sure. The crust ends taste like dense croissant which can be super filling.\n\nOrdering a pie is very easy. They're pretty quick in returning emails or questions. In person they're even nicer. Sometimes they deliver to the rest of the Bay depending on their route. It's best to stay on their mailing list if you want to know. When I came they didn't have any bags but they said they ordered some. They graciously gave me a leftover cardboard box to put my pie in.\n\n______\n\nI'd totally recommend Three Babes Bakeshop for a picnic or special occasion. I haven't had a pie this good in a long time. I'm kinda glad they aren't located right by me or else I'd gain 15 pounds in crust alone.", "author": "Michael H."}

I'd heard of this pop-up pie shop on Facebook, where I saw teasers for sweet and savory pies. The menu, packed with classic pies made with fresh, local and organic ingredients, piqued my curiosity so I figured I'd check out the soft opening for their pie delivery service over Memorial Day weekend--I arranged a pickup while up in the city for a concert.\n\nNow I'm serious about pie and it's far too rare to find a standalone pie operation these days. I couldn't order just one pie, I ordered two--plus another two pies-in-jar. (Or is it pie-in-jars? Or pies-in-jars? Where's my editor when I need him?) The menu for the weekend just had too many delicious flavors and I couldn't resist. (And don't worry--I shared some of my pies with others, though it took great willpower not to devour them on my own!)\n\nI ordered a whole pie each of the banana cream pie and that weekend's savory pie, fromage blanc with green garlic. \n\nThe banana cream pie was delicious. The cream filling so creamy! The fresh organic bananas so banana-y! The flaky crust so buttery. And there was a caramel surprise at the bottom--a nice touch.\n\nI honestly didn't know what to expect from the savory pie. Prior to that weekend, I'd never even heard of savory pies, much less tasted one. It was a little bit like a cheesecake, honestly, but much tastier because it's pie, with buttery pie crust. The filling was appropriately dense without feeling dense. It was rich with flavor from the fromage blanc cheese and hints of garlic and onion. This was a nice cheesy indulgence that one of my coworkers remarked would be great with beer. (Considering we were at work, neither of us decided to test that pairing ourselves.)\n\nThe pies-in-jars were fun--a nice way to get a little taste of pie. I sampled the strawberry rhubarb crumble and the honey salted walnut. The strawberry rhubarb was tasty, but I'm a sucker for strawberry rhubarb pie during the summer--it just feels so right, doesn't it? The salted honey walnut was a little dry, but once I heated it up, it was perfect, with a good blend of sweet and salt from the nuts and sugar.\n\nI'm eager to try more of the Babes' pies, especially now that they've opened their proper popup pie shop at the Stable Caf\u00e9. I'm feeling another trip to the city coming on, and hopefully there will be time for pie.", "author": "Raul N."}

No wait, it was the bourbon peach pie...no wait...see there is no way to pick a fav. I wish I could eat a piece or two of their pie every day. However, after losing 76lbs since December, that is not a wise move.\nJust go get a Three Babes Bakeshop pie!!!! (A little pricey, but I think most pies these days (showing my age) are. Great ingredients though!)", "author": "Jules B."}

We served their pies for both Thanksgiving and Christmas to our guests, and also sampled at the Ferry Building. The pies are delicious, unique, and completely ethically made - from organic, locally sourced ingredients by enthusiastic employees. Their customer service is top-notch and you can serve the pies to guests or enjoy a piece on your own with pride and confidence - presentation and taste are stellar.

They make pies.  The pies are OK, but not worth $43 ($36 for the pie + $7 for the \"Cake Plate deposit\").  We tried the Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble.  It was good.  I didn't realize that I needed to consult my financial planner before buying baked goods though.\n\nI know that we have all entered the era of $3 gourmet cupcakes, gourmet cookies and gourmet etc, etc etc. but this was over the line.  Go to your local bakery or Safeway and buy their best pie and then give $15 to a homeless person.  You will enjoy the pie and feel better because you've done something socially useful.\n\nNot everyone's mid-life fantasy to be featured on the Food Network needs to be indulged.

I got to eat my pie on a nice warm sunny day in the Saison patio.  That is quite a comfortable setting for a \"pop up\".\n\nThe ladies selling the pies were very nice and sociable, and obviously know their product well.   \n\nWe got a plum custard pie.  the pie was very good.  It has a nice tartness to it, but not too tart.  The plum flavor was very nice.  The custard was not too thick nor too sweet.  It was the perfect texture and sweetness level.  The custard pie was comforting without being overly rich and decadent.  \n\nThe butter crust is very nice.  Pie crusts are typically ultra crispy (in my opinion they are also pale, starchy, and otherwise unremarkable).  This pie crust is an all butter crust, so you won't get that ultra crispy \"crisco\" crust.  It might not be that crisp at all actually.  The crust is similar to a yummy french croissant, or like a very nice crostata.    For me, this was exactly what I wanted! \n\nI would definitely come back again and again.", "author": "Jeremy R."}
