When we arrived the restaurant was virtually empty, and they had not even bothered to set up the table.  The lunch rush started to arrive as we were getting ready to check out, and as the restaurant started to fill with people it was clear that this is the type of restaurant that cannot typically easily accommodate large parties during a rush.  I bet they were relieved to see us go so they could break up our table.\n\nThe food was ok, but nothing special.  We all shared several pizzas, salads, and beer.

We ordered an extra large combo to go for $40 and the pizza was soggy.  Like when you lift the slice, it would fall a part! I had to use a fork and knife to eat my pizza.  Even slice house pizza's which is world class good is only about $25.\n\nWe should have just gone to Safeway to get a frozen Dijorno pizza for $10 and wait the extra half hour to cook it up at home and it would have tasted WAY better than Amici's.

It was also cut awkwardly; 2 giant slices and 2 tiny slices. \n\nLinguini: The small size was just enough for one person. It was pretty oily and only the clams were seasoned. The linguini by itself was bland. \n\nGarlic Bread: Everyone, take a look at the pictures. It was totally burnt...front and back! This was $3.75! It's almost $1 per slice! Inedible! Pathetic! No quality control?!?!\n\nThe total for the order was around $40.

While the food is still excellent, the service has gone downhill.  \n\nMy wife & I came here yesterday after the Giants Race.  We finished on the early side, so the restaurant was not busy when we were seated.  But as the dining room filled up, our server seemed to forget about us, bringing our food out very slowly.  We ordered a salad and a pizza; the salad took over 15 minutes to arrive, and the pizza over 20 minutes after that.  The server never came over to check on us to see if we needed any drink refills, either.\n\nThe worst thing was that we were seated right near one of the 3 TVs in the place, all of them on different sports stations.  But none of them were on CSN Bay Area (the Giants TV channel).  Right before the game started, I flagged down our server and asked him if he could get the manager to change the TV to the Giants game.  He said he would... then promptly forgot.  We followed the Giants game on our phones.\n\nEventually, our server brought us the check.  It took him a while to collect my credit card, and didn't get it back for another 10 minutes.

And to top it all off I was given the wrong order twice and apparently the manager whom I was supposed to speak to is helping in the kitchen where all my orders are coming out wrong.", "author": "Patricia M."}

Caesar salad was plain...and only one container of dressing was provided for two salads.  We had to ration the dressing, which probably contributed to the plain-ness.\n\nSo - to recap - a half eggplant parm, two salads with not enough dressing, and a partially filled \"bowl\" of mushroom soup came to $35 before tip.  \n\nThe food wasnt terrible, but it wasn't so great that I'll drop that kind of cash here again.

They are the best chain- local or national- in the Bay Area for sure.  This location near the stadium is an asset to the area- I have eaten here on a few occasions, had their pre-game slice boxes a few times, and also was treated to them handing out small free sample cheese slices recently after a game.  I will surely try to vulture those again in the future.\n\nMy only gripe is that Amici's is ridiculously expensive.  My last visit was $60 for a pitcher of Sierra Nevada and a customized 13\" pizza with 3 toppings.  Really? It was great, I enjoy their charred thin crust, and I'll surely return.

The crust IS a bit darker than most of us pizza eaters might be accustomed.  Amici's explains on their website that because the pizza is brick oven cooked, the crust usually comes out darker (even blackened in spots) than non-brick oven cooked pizza.  Not to worry!  Overall, the pizza was absolutely delicious and the crust tasted great.  Amici's clearly uses fresh, quality ingredients; the pizza just looked gourmet.  Usually my wife and I order from Goat Hill Pizza, which is pretty damn good pizza.  And, when we find a pizza place we like we usually stick with it.  So, this was a big deal.  \n\nHere's the not-so-great.  Two medium pizzas and an order of gnocchi (which was rather small) came to $65, which, to me, seemed a bit over priced.  Yet, with that said, I'll pay for quality food that tastes good.  Ya get what you pay for in this world.

Delivery was fast.  The biggest problem is the price.  3 one-topping medium pizzas - $73 delivered.  Wait...what?  WTF?!? $80 with tip for 3 damn smallish medium pizzas?  That's about 4x what the same meal would be for Domino's.  Granted, these pies are way better than Dominos, but still - shit, that's expensive.  Amici's isn't THAT great.  And to top it off, you are going to charge me almost $25 for a medium pizza that is more like a small, AND you are going to skimp on the toppings?  Really?  The extra-cheese had no detectable increase in the amount of cheese from the other two, and the sausage literally had maybe 10 pieces of sausage on the whole pie - 2- per slice.  That sucks.

The menu i looked at online said they had oven roasted garlic as a topping and sauteed mushroom. Not sure why but I always picture \"sauteed  mushrooms\" as FRESH mushrooms. These were canned. I guess fresh was too difficult. The garlic was yummy and the mild italian sausage as OK.  \n\nThe only other thing I have to mention is the crust. We asked for the thin crust and indeed, got it.  But the menu specifically says, \"If a darker crust is not to your liking, please specify \"light crust\", although the result may be undercooked for some tastes.\"  Now I don't know about YOU, but I really appreciate it when a restaurant brings this type of stuff up. It means they want you to know ahead of time something that might be a fault of theirs and remedy it.  So, as you've probably figured out by now, we went ahead and ordered the crust \"LIGHT.\"\n\nNever happened. The bottom of the pizza was black as the night.  Still tasted good, but still. Also there were those canned mushrooms. Of course we ate it. and it was GOOD.

I'm not quite sure but I felt that she had something against us or wanted us out ASAP. Ordering wasn't too much of a hassle though. I was able to be flexible with swapping pastas. Normally I stick with the fettuccine Alfredo but I thought I would switch it up a bit with linguini. I was sharing with the co-host and ordered a large size. Little did I remember that ordering a large size was not even able to satisfy MY OWN appetite. I had to order another large pasta with vegetables, garlic, to share. I was hoping to keep the cost lower too as I was watching my budget for the holiday season. That didn't happen.\n\nWe had to keep asking for water refills since it wasn't protocol apparently. The wait time was pretty long and we did not order any appetizers. If you're hungry, consider ordering a pasta one size smaller than your appetite suggests and go with an appetizer (or two). A friend also ordered a pizza and it came out somewhat burnt and TINY for a personal size, sadly. \n\nCustomer service really needs to get a huge upgrade, seriously. I don't want to dine in a facility that doesn't have a favorable impression towards its patrons. We did, however, get a friendly waitress to take a group photo for us so that was a plus. Other than that, not much going on.", "author": "Dominic T."}

Darcey made recommendations, noted the order thoroughly and even took personal responsibility to speak to the chef.  Then she even checked the food order to make sure it was safe.

And for a chain pizza (albeit a small chain), Amici's East Coast does serve up really tasty, NY-style pizza the way they make it back there.\n\nIt was nearly empty on the evening of Valentine's Day as I guess pizza would be the kiss-of-death for any budding romance. My friend and I have no such problems, so we went for the garlic-infused Calabria pizza, which was layered with bits of crispy pancetta and tomato chunks over a meltdown of provolone and mozzarella. I think it's quite yummy. A 13-inch Medium is a bit over $16. I tried to offset it with a $3.95 Side Salad which I willingly allowed to be drowned in their Caesar dressing.\n\nThe service was most attentive but sometimes a strange bit of victim-speak would come out - when the waitress asked for our dirty plates, she said, \"Is this mine to have, sir?\"...uh, sure, now begone, young wench!

And with him being a true Italian, I truly trust his judgment and maybe eat an Amici someday. \n\nWell, that day is \"today\" or \"tonight\" for that matter, when I just received another pair of tickets for the Giant's game. But this time, I got tickets from another co-worker and yes, better seats than my weekend bleacher section. I just happened to get off work late, so I went straight to the ballpark after work. \n\nAnd walking around the suddenly emerging area of China Basin/South Beach area, some of the nearby businesses have table(s) with quick snacks and/or drinks to take to the ballpark. Amici's pizzeria is one of them, and they have an employee with boxes of sliced pizza for sale. And I paid $3.00 for a slice of a small deep-crust cheese. It's not really a big slice like Blondie's, but fresher and thicker with the gooey melted cheese. For a guy who infrequently eats pizza, I thought that lone slice was ok.\n\nMr. Barbieri definitely knows what he is talking about with the pizza. But a true test, I definitely need to try more of their foods in the near future to really judge how the restaurant really is", "author": "Matt G."}

The Trentino Pizza, thin crunchy crust layered with toppings of sweet red onions, spinach, pancetta, parmesan, mozzarella, feta, and the olive oil drizzled all over was infused with lemon.   We requested that with an extra helping of garlic.  The host laughed and stated that no one would be kissable after that meal.\n\nOther recommendations for the pizza would be the Calabria pizza, simple, no tomato sauce........and the spicy Pepper Chicken Pizza.  Spicy but tender pieces of chicken dot this gourmet pizza.\n\nFor a large, our tab was around $25, but we took the other half home with us.

The taste of the pizza dough itself is very bland. Apparently a few co-workers from New York like this type of \"dirty bottom pizzas\". For my taste, it's not a favorite. In my opinion, the nearby South Beach Cafe serves better pizza (when done correctly) for less.\n\nMy only real beef with Amici's is that they don't know how to cook bacon. In both their Calabria pizza (pancetta) and the spinach salad, the bacon has been overcooked into crispy burned bits. I like bacon, I don't like burned bacon.\n\nPastas are okay, and the meatballs with marinara sauce are very good. The restaurant is nice and the service is pleasant. Prices are a bit expensive.\n\nI ordered their garlic breadsticks once, with a pizza carryout order, but I think that they gave me the plain ones instead, because I couldn't see/taste or smell any of the garlic. They also seem to forget to add utensils and napkins (even though I asked for it, but I forgot to check the bag - my fault for not checking).\n\nI do like their fancy packaging (foil lined bags for the breadsticks, and foil lined cardboard bottoms for paper bags with hot food). It's part of their good service.\n\nConvenient Free delivery within downtown and other specific areas (see map):\nhttp://www.waiter.com/wwwsys/amicis/amicis1.deliverymap.gif\n\nIf you're outside of their delivery area, there's a delivery charge with Waiter.com.\n($8.95 delivery charge + $2 fuel surcharge + 15% driver support charge)\nWow!

It's the first time on a while, so it's a chance to update my review.\n\nWe ordered the Amici's regular combo. It's the most conservative choice because it pretty much contains the basic toppings (like pepperoni, mushroom, etc.) that we all like.  The medium size was 13 inches, almost perfect for two people.  The crust was thin and flaky, a big plus for someone like me who dislike thick crusts. In fact, I'm not sure if there are other places there the crust stands out so much for being as good as the rest of the pizza.\n\nThe staff was pretty nice and attentive despite the pregame crowds. There's outside seating which we had a chance to enjoy that evening.\n\nThey do charge 4.85 percent tax due to the requirement for restaurant employee health insurance. I commented on it last time also but this tome I will not deduct for it. (I wonder if it's charged also at their other location in SF.)\n\nStudying the menu, it's good to see they serve mini size also (seven inches).

We waited a good amount of time before our server came around to apologize for the delay as the kitchen had not received our order.

They had no problem with a last minute request for plates, napkins and lots of cheese and peppers.\n\nI'll be honest; I'm not a big fan of their pizza however.  The crust is super thin but the bottom crust is almost always burnt black.  I checked each pie and that was the case on all of them.  There is barely cheese on the top and the regular toppings are usually pretty sparse.  The red sauce is not very tomatoey and it does have a little sort of spicy kick to it.

This place has huge placement on Giants radio, it is RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM ATT PARK and has NO TV??? HELLO?!! I'll go to Pete's, Pedro's the Public House or any other place on King Street, 2nd, Townsend, etc. \nI walked over last week, had a small pizza, side salad and 1 beer and dropped over $30?

Not like Pizza Orgasmica cornmeal crust (which, by the way, is awesome).  I'm talking about really crispy, kind of burnt, super thin crust.\n\nI've seen a couple of Amici's delivery cars around my building, so I decided to look it up and try it.  After registering for an account on waiter.com (I wish they'd just have their own online ordering system like Extreme or Chico's), I ordered a thin-crust pepperoni pizza, garlic breadsticks and minestrone soup.  For delivery, I clicked the \"deliver at 8 PM\" on the drop-down menu, since it was only 4:00 in the afternoon and I wanted a few more hours for the hangover to clear.\n\nAt 4:45, the doorbell rang, and it was the Amici's delivery guy.  Puzzled, I told him that my order wasn't supposed to arrive until 8.  He looked at the receipt, called the restaurant, and apologized for the pizza.  Not wanting to make a big deal of it, I just took it and saved the breadsticks for the next day.  I wasn't that hungry yet, but the minestrone soup was delicious, and just a cup of it made me full enough to only have one slice of pizza.\n\nThe pizza is eh.  I loved the thin-crust, but there was something about the cheese and the little baby pepperonis that just didn't quite add up in my head.  Since I ate most of it the next day and it just wasn't the type of pizza that you eat cold, I'm sure that's a reason why I'm rounding down.\n\nGarlic breadsticks were good, but not garlicky enough.  Again, I'm sure it would've tasted better hot, but they satisfied my carb cravings.\n\nThe other factor in rounding down was for them not checking the delivery time.  Thanks, I appreciate the efficiency, but there's a HUGE DIFFERENCE between getting your dinner at 5 PM, and getting it at 8 PM.", "author": "Tori S."}

I'd have to say, though, that the toppings were a little lacking in quantity.  I know, I shoulda just gotten cheese, but I didn't know if they were good til just now.  The Philly is what I got, and it was decent.\n\nDelivery service was prompt, less than 30 minutes delivery to my office here in SOMA/FiDi.  And they take my corporate AmEx!  sweet!\n\nMy only complaint:  price.  $25 for a large that wasn't as large as a true NY large.  That's a LOT.  If it were more affordable, amici's would definitely get 5 stars.", "author": "Fong L."}

It still leaves a lot to be desired, but definitely my favorite.  The crust is *ALMOST* right.  If they didn't do the nouvelle burning in the wood ovens it would be far better.\r\n\r\nThey have some funky toppings you'd never see in a Manhattan or Jersey pizzeria....eggplant? caramelized onions? soy mozzarella?  But  some of them are pretty tasty...the manhattan red clam has become a favorite.\r\n\r\nThey slice their sausage nice and thin, unlike so many SF places that crumble it and dump it on, the sauce could use a little spicing up but they get the right ratio of cheese to sauce and the grease factor is dead on.\r\n\r\nBut I just can't give it higher than 3 stars because of the prices.  I got a large two topping and a half-antipasto salad...which is just some iceberg lettuce with a few measly slices of salami and some pepperoncini, and it came out to $32...and I picked it up!  For delivery it comes to almost $40 with tip.  That's just ridiculous.\r\n\r\nBut I still have their number in my speed dial.

As soon as we shared the pepperoni pizza in August, we began the countdown until we could eat it again.  Last week, he drove his car over from Atlanta, and throughout the trip, the pizza kept coming up in our conversations.  \n\nI love anticipation, don't you?\n\nAnyway, we ate here yesterday for lunch and it was just like I remembered.  Well, I was five pounds heavier, but at least the food was the same.  If not better. \n\nThis time (because of the five pounds) I ordered tomatoes on my half.  They asked us if we wanted fresh garlic.. (heck yes). \n\nThe thin crust was great, because it allowed me to eat 3 pieces and not feel too guilty.  \n\nI also had a salad with the fat-free tomato vinagrette.. This sounds dumb, but I was surprised at the thick tomato base.  Strangely appetizing, though, so I will order it again.  \n\nIf you're on a date, you may want to order the salad to appear feminine;  If you're already married to the guy, forego the salad and attack the pizza. \n\nMedium is enough for two people.

Let's face it...when us East Coast transplants hop in the covered wagons and make our journey across the US, the first thing we look for after stabling our horses is a good pizza place.\n\nSo, I've made a decision. You must have your favorite category of New York pizza, a favorite Chicago Pizza, and now, a completely separate West Coast favorite. And if I am picking my favorite West Coast pizza...this is it. I mean, I have tried a lot of pizza here so far that I would probably only eat again if I were homeless, but this little gem (and you wouldn't guess that it is more of a chain than a one off) is different. It would be foolish of someone to try and compare anything to the masterpieces that come from NYC or Chicago, but it is safe to say, this place is good.\n\nNow that the baseball season is over, you will have no problem getting in here at anytime. And if they were open at 4am, I would be embarssed to say I would have been there.\nI went with a date and was sat promptly at a nice table in front of the window looking out on the main drag. We ordered a large (which is 14 inches, but seems bigger...yeah, a guy said that...but it's the truth) and it is plenty. In five minutes or less, the pizza was hot and steaming and smelling great right in front of us.\n\nThe pepperoni is fantastic. If you have tried to best places in New York and know the difference between Bella Grande pepperoni and the Wal-Mart pouch that Domino's uses, it' s a must taste.\n\nAnd the best part...the brick oven. The pizzas come out with that charred, black smokey crisp, without being burnt, and still having great texture.\n\nFor those that might argue it isn't close to NYC pizza, I will remind before you walk in that NYC is 2500 miles away, and for that reason, this is as close as I can find. I might be all about the looks like all the rest of those guys, but this girl is great on the inside too.

But we ended up in conversation for the most of our dinner, nice people.  \n\nNow, you may have read some of my other reviews regarding pizza, so you should know that I am married to a person nicknamed the Pizza King.  He was in full force on Saturday.  Whatever you want, honey, I'm willing to try something different, except artichoke hearts, I really can't eat those.  And I want a large of whatever we get, we can take it home if needed.  OK I said, and started perusing the menu.  Most of the pizzas in size large were more than $20, a little pricey for the thin crust I would say.  But, we are in SF I guess we're paying for the rent, not so much for the pizza.  I suggested getting a New Yorker (mozzarella and tomato sauce) and adding hot italian sausage and jalapenos (at $1.30 each).  He agreed and thought that was a fantastic choice.  \n\nOur server was on top of it right from the beginning, or about 7-8 minutes into our arrival--it was packed.  She asked if we wanted drinks and/or salads, we said YES and YES.  The pitchers are only $12.50 for your gourmet microbrews, we opted for the Pilsner Urquell.  I paid $9.00 for a 16 oz. Harp in the ballpark.  It hit the spot with the spicey pizza we chose. We also ordered the small Caeser to split, but she mistakenly gave us a large--that's OK she said, I'll only charge you for the small, my error.

The large order of penne with meat sauce was about $15, and I wasn't even full after the meal.  The pasta was cooked fine, and the small amount of meat was good, but I would have been better off just getting some Ragu meat sauce and some penne pasta at Safeway and creating a science experiment/cooking in our office kitchen.\n\nThere was so little sauce in the penne, that I felt like I was playing the game, Where's Waldo, except the pasta version, Where's the Meat Sauce.  At first I couldn't find the meat sauce.  When I looked at the pasta, I thought that I got the wrong order because I didn't notice the meat or much sauce.  However, after about 5 minutes of investigation and digging through the pasta, I found \"Waldo\" or in this case, the meat sauce towards to bottom of the pasta.  I noticed a few scattered tiny pieces of meat between a few pieces of penne pasta.  Now I know what it must have been like to be part of the California Gold Rush; it was like I hit gold; finally I found some meat sauce.\n\nThe best thing about the pasta and meat sauce was the side of Parmesan cheese. Without the generous portion of Parmesan cheese to mix in with the penne, the dish would have been fairly tasteless except the few bites that actually contained meat sauce.\n\nIf I'm going to spend $15 for pasta to go, I would expect to be full from the meal and to get most of the protein from the meat sauce and not the packet of Parmesan cheese.", "author": "Josh K."}

And not knowing much about East Coast Pizza, I thought that was going to be a good thing.\n\nWell, one day on the way, early to the Pac Bell Park to watch a Giant's game we passed by what was a NEW Amici's going up for business. I think it was the first week even. So, I said, \"Let's go in and give it a try, I've HEARD great things about it.\"\n\nSo we did.\n\nThere were a lot of pizzas on the menu and the servers (all new apparently, and a lot of them too) were very nice. I don't remember there being any free pre-meal bread but they had a lot of parmesan cheese available. Did I have a salad? I might have but don't really remember.\n\nWe ordered, of course, a pizza, a healthy veggie pizza and when it came we were shocked. \"is that all the pizza?\", I thought. It was much smaller than I thought it would be. And when I tasted it it was all burned on the bottom, apparently from the brick pizza oven. It had no flavor except burned flavor and that's not a good flavor.\n\nWell, the view was nice but the pizza was not. I probably should have sent the thing back but I chickened out and ate what I could anyways because it was getting close to gametime. Needless to say, I wasn't happy. Plus, it was as thin as a piece of paper, no bulk to it at all. If that is East Coast pizza, guess what East Coast, you lose. We want thick pizza out here fellas.\n\nMaybe I just had a bad day and maybe Amici's is not for me. They certainly are doing well with all of the stores they are opening up around the Bay Area but for me, I won't be back. There are just so many better pizza options around here, like Round Table that it just isn't worth my time to give Amici's another go. Sorry.", "author": "Terry H."}

I hear the guys on KNBR talk about how great this pizza is, so I just had to try it. What a disappointment!  The pizza was NOT even close to what we had in New York, but the beer was cold, so that helped a bit. The worst part was that the waiter was rude!  I am always extra nice to servers because I know it is a tough job, but this guy was not nice at all. He knocked into another server who was helping him and caused her to spill water all over my friend. He acted like it was her fault. It certainly wasn't!  He is bringing this place down with his attitude that he was really not happy to be there. Not a good experience and very expensive. I hate when I highly anticipate something and it's a total let down. I gave it two stars because of the good location and the fact that you can watch the guy toss pizza dough in the air as he hand throws the crust. KNBR did me wrong!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-02-25", "description": "Calling Amici's an \"East Coast Pizzeria\" is a complete misnomer, as there are two styles of pizza typically found on the East Coast. First off, you have New York pizza, typified by a thin crust that is foldable which is topped with a rich combination of tomato sauce and cheese. This can be found at Arinell, not Amici's. Amici's is trying to replicate, with some success, the pizza from New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nWhen it comes to New Haven style pizza, there are some significant characteristics: the crust should be very thin, seasoned with olive oil and salt and should never get floppy. This base can be covered with chopped clams, olive oil and grated cheese or it can be covered with a little red sauce, mozzarella and some toppings. Not a mountain of toppings, but some sausage, pepperoni, peppers, onions, anchovies and other bits to enhance the flavor of the pizza. Shape isn't as important, nor is cutting it into symmetrical wedges... but color is, as the bottom should have areas of jet black char from the heat of the wood or coal fired brick oven, and the top of the pizza should blister from the heat anywhere where it is not covered with cheese. Is your mouth watering yet?\n\nAmici's tries to replicate this, and in some ways they have: the cheese mix is pretty dead on, and the crust exhibits the sort of charring and blistering you would expect, though it isn't oiled and salted first, which makes it lose out a little on the flavor. For the past few months, I usually have Amici's delivered three times a month - and the pies are consistantly good, but nowhere as good as when you get it served hot at the restaurant.\n\nPoints off for their prices, the occasional delivery issue (getting a pie with the cheese all slid over to one side), and the piece of metal my wife unfortunately found in her chicken pesto pasta one time.", "author": "Avery G."}

The pizza came without tomato sauce, but instead was very cheesy. There was mozarella and provolone cheese, lots of garlic, broccoli, Italian sausage, and pepper flakes all on top of a thin crust that came out piping hot and flaky. I really don't like eating thick or regular crusts, so I was happily relieved to see that the pizzas are all thin crusted. I really enjoyed the taste, especially with the garlic and the bit of spice coming from the pepper flakes. The sausage had a smokey flavor to it which made it taste even better and complimented the flavors of the pizza.

I was suprised it would only take ten minutes, since it was a game day.  I showed up in ten minutes and picked up my pizza.  Three minutes later I was at home ready to enjoy a slice and a beer after a long day at work.  Opened up the box, and looked at a pizza that was probably cooked forty five minutes ago, and spent way too much time in the oven.  The bottom of the pizza was a consitent black crust.  This was not an oven blister, but a constant burn.  \n\nI call up Amici's and was immediately asked, \"have you ever had our pizza before?\"\n\nNo, but this pizza is burnt.  They told me they would give me a credit, or I could come back. \n\nHave you changed the pizza game?  New groundbreaking pizza methods?\n\nOn the way back to the restaurant, I looked at pizzas on the outside table.  They were all normal looking pizzas, not burnt.  \n\nWhen I went in I showed them the pizza, and they said this was normal.  I've been in the restaurant business for over 15 years, so I was a little unnerved at the response from someone in the service industry.  No apology, just an excuse!  You should order your pizza under cooked?  Next time I will go to a real pizzeria.  \n\nif you mistake, admit your mistake, and rectify the situation.  Do not lie to a customer.

It's not the best place on earth, and it's not the only real East Coast pizza on the West Coast.\n\nAmici's, however, offers an excellent pre-game meal for hungry Giants fans.  I come here about twice a month during baseball season.  Get here early, or risk not getting a table or being late for the first pitch.  On warmer days, you can try sitting outside if you don't mind the sounds of The Embarcadero traffic and the screams of overzealous scalpers.\n\nAmici's features thin crust pizza, which is surprisingly non-greasy.  They have about 15 or so 'signature pizzas,'  or you can ask them to create your own with your favorite ingredients.  \n\nIf you order an Extra Large pizza, perfect for 2 hungry adult males, you can ask them to make it a half-and-half for $2 more.  We usually get 1/2 Amici's combo (Pepperoni, Meatballs, Bacon, Mushrooms and Black Olives) and 1/2 Calabria (Mozzarella, Provolone, Pancetta and Green Olives).  We also get a salad, but it's pretty boring.\n\nThe waitstaff is polite, experienced and prompt.  They're trying to serve you as quickly as possible, since an hour before the game, the line is usually out the door.

So if you move the toppings you see gooey dough- yuck. The thin crust is so good, not crispy thin, just perfect!\n\nI love the pollo pizza with fresh garlic. I also love the spinach salad with bacon, pine nuts, feta and roasted red peppers. This place has the BEST ranch dressing, too. I know, not really diet food. \n\nI'm not sayin' this is \"diet\" food, but I enjoy it now about once a week. I don't feel stuffed or bloated.

The small version of this salad is only $8.50, generous enough for an entire meal. The larger version ($14.75) is said to serve as many as 4, but I think it would be a good dinner size for 2. \n\nI think Amici's prices are high, but again you do have a dining-room experience (with the pleasure of the variety of King Street walking by).

The number of bottom burns I've eaten at Amici's makes me wonder if when the distribution tractor trailer pulls up in the back alley, you wouldn't perhaps see boxes of \"Acme New York Homeless Dude Fire Pit Ashes\" being off-loaded by the dolly full. This is a real bummer actually, because without the burns the crusts threaten to taste pretty good and are appropriately thin and crispy, if that's your thing.\n\nIt's also pricey for what you get, and there are cheaper, better meals to be had in the area.

Pizza-wise the sauce was fairly flavorful and the crust couldn't seem to decide if it wanted to be a crispy thin crust or a crusty thick crust and settled somewhere in-between.

I was right. This allowed us to be seated quickly and take our time, so we ordered their hearth-baked breadsticks. They were hot from the hearth (I practically burned my thumb on them, cause it got stuck inside the breadstick...) and came with tasty ranch and marinara dipping sauces. I ordered the linguini with pesto and clams and enjoyed every bite. The clams had a little sand in them....but that's normal. Overall, a good place for pizza or pasta, but the menu lacked much else.", "author": "Matt H."}

We usually share a spinach salad or garden salad and order two large pizzas (Amici combo and \"wildcard\" choice).  We've tried the manhattan clam & garlic, spicy chicken, and hawaiian (pineapple/canadian bacon aka ham).  In general, the pizzas are good if you enjoy thin crust, but they sometimes overcook it especially the combo.  Tried their lasagna which is not bad.  Also, brought out-of-town relatives here for a family dinner (party of 12) when Tommaso's was closed for vacation.  The vibe is of a chain restaurant, but the classic sport photos lend a warmer feel.  The original on 3rd Avenue in San Mateo has less of a \"chain\" feel.

I order the Trentino (knowing one guest won't eat sausage) and they tell me it will be ten minutes.  So, I take a seat and wait.  About ten minutes later, I look down at the receipt in my hand, and lo and behold, it says pizza Siciliano instead of Trentino! Oh, no!  I brought my receipt over to the host who took my order and told him I ordered the Trentino pie.  He said he made a mistake and looked embarrassed.  At that point, I said don't worry about it, 'cause the pie is about ready to come out and I'm running late.  (Hmmm...how rude is it to ask a guest to pick the sausage off of her pizza?  Oh, well.)  The manager came over and checked with me, and I said no worries, I'll take the Siciliano.  He said he'd check w/ the kitchen, then told me the pizza was almost done.  I waited a little bit longer, then the manager came out w/ TWO pizzas.  He said he felt bad about the mix-up, and had the kitchen make a Trentino to go along with the Siciliano.  I was so surprised and pleased, and, relieved that no one had to pick off the sausage!  Plus, both pizzas were delicious.  Big thanks for the customer service.

I even prefer to most pizza in Italy.  The Pepperoni is a classic, but not for those with high cholesterol, as there is a good deal of grease.  The Pesto is also a good choice.   The highlight of Amici's pizza its thin crispy crust and light cheese.   It's a great bargain and they deliver too.  If you're looking for something healthy go elsewhere.\n\nPick up a few slices before a baseball game or concert at SBC park.", "author": "Ian M."}

Didn't have a great experience but thought we would give it another try.  Unfortunately, this visit did not give us any reason to change our mind.  We stopped by for lunch on the way to see Totem.  Right from the start - everything was disappointing.  The place was nearly empty when we arrived yet they wanted to seat us at a table right by the front door.  We asked to be moved to a different table.  The service was substandard.  The waitress could not answer any of questions regarding the food and couldn't make any suggestions.  She never came by to check on us to see how the food was or to ask for refills.  When the pizza arrived, it was black on the bottom.  I made a comment which the waitress ignored.  Ordinarily we love savoring the crust but because it was burnt it was otherwise inedible.  My son said it was the worse pizza he has had.  We would have sent it back but couldn't afford to wait for another pizza or else we'd miss our show.  Plus, $22.95 for a medium sized pizza is highway robbery.  The thing they have going for it is the location - but that is about it.  Before leaving, I asked if they had any comment cards or if I could speak with the manager.  The hostess told me to make a review on yelp.  Ok - you asked for it so here it is.", "author": "Will L."}

There's no \"by the slice\" option for lunch, and the pizzas themselves lack any kind of signature taste, like an unusual cheese or sauce blend.. My experience has been that it's well-prepared, thin-crust pizza, served by nice staff.

In terms of the food, i usually get one of the pizzas because i've found the pastas to be pretty bad and would only give it 2 stars.  HOWEVER, today, i was blown away by their service, which is why i'm giving them 4 stars.  it is cold and rainy and i'm assuming there are tons of people calling in for deliveries.  this time, the delivery took longer than normal, around 40 minutes.  i wasn't too disturbed because I wasn't starving, but it was great to have the delivery guy apologize right away and say that this normally doesn't happen but the bad weather and the large calls for deliveries has pushed them behind schedule.  to me, 10 minutes isn't that much of a delay compared to other pizza places.  when i opened up the box, i found that it was the wrong pizza.  i was slightly annoyed, but the pizza i received looked pretty good, so i didn't call them to complain.  within 20-30 minutes of the delivery, amici's calls me back to ask if i received the wrong pizza and apologized.  they knew exactly what pizza i received (show's there some semblance of logistics) and apologized profusely.  they offered to send me another pizza right away or to credit me for my next purchase.  i chose to accept the credit since i had already eaten and was full.\n\nat the end of the day, i respect amici's more for owning up to their mistakes and preemptively calling me to offer a solution.  even though the food is so-so, it is very likely that i'll order again from them because of this positive experience.", "author": "Jay M."}

My fiance and I didn't particularly want pizza, so we settled on pasta, which was too expensive in our opinion... but when you're a student and it's finals, you do what you have to do. We ordered pesto pasta with chicken. When we got it, they messed up the order... we got alfredo pasta with chicken. Although we were upset, we do like alfredo sauce and opted to just eat the pasta instead of wait for them to come back and fix the order. That was our biggest mistake. About three hours later we were both up with food poisoning, and remained up for the better part of the night. I guess there was something wrong with the alfredo sauce. Whatever the reason, it was a very unpleasant night. Be wary of Amici's... I know I have not eaten there since, and have no plans to--ever--in the future.", "author": "Bridgette A."}

Being from NJ, and thus an expert on pizza, this is up there with Joes in Union, NJ on Vauxhall Road. The only bias is I dont enjoy chicago pizza, the same way. Whenever, guest  visit our winery from Chicago, I always let them know east coast pizza is real pizza. A pizza should be thin and crispy and yes oily!  I wish there was an Amici's in santa rosa.

I would have given them 4 stars but I took away a star because of the parking situation - or lack thereof. King Street is a very busy street, and if they are offering drive-by pick-ups, they should at least have a space handy for quick stops.
