Tickets were your standard price tag for SF/NY/LA/CHI.\n\nThis was my first time and I will definitely come back again. Two things really caught my attention. First were the breathtaking Gottardo Piazzoni's \"The Sea\" and \"The Land\" murals. The second were the Hollywood Suites by Steven Kahn. Apparently the murals caused a lot of controversy when they were moved from their original location - the San Francisco Public Library which is now the home of the Asian Art Museum. Unfortunately, I did not have time on this trip to check out the Asian Art Museum but it is on my list for the next trip. The murals are absolutely beautiful and I spent quite a chunk of time just lost looking at them. The second thing that stuck to me the most was the Hollywood Suites. I don't want to talk about them much because they are very intense and I think putting it in writing will take away from the mental experience of looking at it in person.\n\nAside from the current exhibit of Muslim contemporary fashion which basically ended up taking up almost all of my time there some of my favorite things to see were the art work dedicated to AIDS outbreak awareness, Latin American arts (pre-colonization), and works highlighting LA riots. They have a huge Mesoamerican collection which is a must see.", "author": "Zain R."}

Over the past year plus, I've really enjoyed attending new exhibits at the De Young and the Legion of Honor as well as revisiting their permanent exhibits. The permanent collection at the De Young features a selection of western art ranging from Modigliani to Dali to Chihuly. Most recently, the Contemporary Muslim Fashions exhibit unveiled a well-curated selection of high fashion pieces and modern athleisure-wear designed with Islamic female modesty in mind while still advancing style and dramatic effect. There are beautiful pieces featuring truly impressive and precise couture detailing. The Art of Propaganda was also a great exhibit that features historic print and film media from the 1930s and 1940s that were designed to influence public opinion and wartime morale. I especially enjoyed discovering Disney's wartime posters and cartoons.", "author": "Christine T."}

Bunny and I were actually walking through the Golden gate park where this place is located, from one end to the other.  Cal us crazy we thought it be fun and relaxing.  What we didn't realize it HOW BIG the GOLDEN GATE PARK is.  So when we stopped to take a break we wandered pass this museum and wanted to check it out.  We didn't actually think we'd be in there long because neither of us is that into modern or contemporary art.\n\nWhen you walk in you hit with this massive entryway.  We buy tickets and start to walk though.  There are restrooms all over and there is also a caf\u00e9 in the back of museum with seating inside and out.\n\nThe first art we saw was this huge piece of something on the wall. It was made of old wood, and metal and parts looked like birds.  I'm not sure what it was but it looked like something my little nieces could do.  Sorry I don't get that style of art or why someone thinks it is art.  It was both cool and weird at the same time.\n\nWe wandered upstairs and into the South Pacific.  This was a HUGE exhibit and seem to take up half the floor.  Tribes and the headdresses they wear, bags the make and carry, rituals and etc.  Basically a taste of how they live.  I found that very interesting.  There was also a film showing with another group I believe Thailand and how they do funerals, the music and what they wear.  Very cool to see.\n\nNext e wandered through the halls of more our style of art. Mostly European.  They had furniture which I LOVED as well and sculptures.  Some Deigo Rivera but sadly no Frida.  I LOVE HER! \n\nOn to a room with huge pieces of fruit and some sort of large statue that looked like a man.  We were definitely back to the more modern art.  At least I think it was modern.  By this time we had been there a few hours.  Next was the New Zealand room were they had different people painted from photos on the wall.  The nice thing is that they also had a large table book which you could read as you walked through.  In the back was a film on the people that were painted.  Some of the people interviewed were distant family members or historians.  They gave you a inside look of what the people were like and their life.  I found that VERY INTERESTING.\n\nThere is a GI-NOR-MOUS book store or gift shop as well.  two floors jam packed with books, a large kid section, all types of housewares, scarves, etc.  You'll find something for yourself or someone else.\n\nOver all a RELLY NICE and HUGE museum.

For example, in the South Bay/Silicon Valley area, you have places like the Tech museum and the Pace Gallery. Heck, even Intel has its own little space for the public. In the East Bay, you have places such as the Oakland Museum of California. \n\nAnd in San Francisco, you have more museums than you can count on your fingers. The de Young Art Museum is definitely one that I recommend you check out. \n\nRecently, my girlfriend and I had this ambitious plan (well I technically dragged her along, but you know) of visiting 3 different museums around the Bay in one day. The first on our list was the de Young. The really cool thing (that makes the Bay Area EVEN BETTER) about this museum and several others around is that it's free during certain weekends (if not most) of the year for people who have Bank of America cards. Note: even if you don't it's only $15 admission and I think they really don't look at your ID to see if it matches your card. Just use a friend's or something. \n\nThe de Young museum is located in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the giant playground that is the equivalent of New York's Central Park. I really recommend coming to the de Young a bit earlier in the day to avoid lines, find a parking spot + have more time during the rest of your day to enjoy the city. Unfortunately, parking can be a nuisance in Golden Gate Park, and so you may have to use the garage/park on the street.\n\nIf I have to describe the de Young in a few words, I'd say that it is \"truly a magical place for various types of art.\" Here, you will see different exhibits ranging from African American history, glass art, as colonial art. There's at least a few floors with hundreds or different things to look at. If I have to give you an estimate of how long you can spend here, I'd say you can spend upwards to 2-3 hours here. Personally, my favorite part of the de Young was actually the tower. It's 9 stories up and you get a GORGEOUS 360 view of the SF/Bay Area. You can also peep on the long lines at the Academy of Sciences next door. \n\nFor those of you who may not know, the de Young is actually the sibling museum to the Legion of Honor. They both operate under the same system (I think). For example, they both offer free admission to BoA customers and their admission tickets have both names on it. I've been to the Legion of Honor before (also when it was free haha), and I have to say that de Young is definitely a better experience. Though the former has different exhibits (i.e. more sculptures and architecture), I feel like you can spend so much more time on the latter for the price.\n\nOverall, I have to say that de Young is absolutely a must-try experience in San Francisco. If it is considered a tourist trap, then let it be known that it's an amazing one. I have to give it an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this.\" You can get SO lost in this museum, and it's totally worth it - be it free or be it that you spend $15. If I come back, you bet I'm paying that extra $$ for the special exhibits!\n\nHave fun and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

I went in the morning and spent 4.5 hours. \n\n\n-What to do first?\n\nGo up the Hamon tower to experience 360 views of the grounds and some parts of the city. \nAmazing and totally worth it.\n\n-Collections\n\nMy favorites were the Oceanic art and the art of the Americas but they have lots more (more info here http://deyoung.famsf.org/collections)\n\n-Food\n\n There is a caf\u00e9 in the museum although not cheap, it offers great tasty food.  I had the tomato soup and it was fresh and flavorful. They have a variety of bake goods and salads that will satisfy anyone from Gluten free, vegan to carnivore.\n They have an indoor dining room and outdoor patio with greenery and some beautiful sculptures.\n\nThere are some food tents outside that offer different types of cuisines.

But then you gain appreciation for the detailed handiwork and the amount of LSD that went into producing these incredible happy 8.5\"X11\" billboards essentially to promote bands and agendas.\n\nSuper cool and while it was pricey ($25) it was worth it the one time to go and see. Keeping in mind the normal standing exhibits were $FREE to go check out, that might be a better way to go about it next time.\n\nAlso, drinks are delish (had myself a Bloody Mary) but the prices are not ($13 for a tiny plastic cup).\n\nGo check out the high tower before it closes early for the night, gorgeous views and located just right of the museum ticket desk.

This is part  of The  50th Anniversary being celebrated all over California this year. People piled in from all over the world to see the exhibition. There was over a 2 1/2 hour wait just to get in for the final weekend of the exhibition. As you walked into the museum the outside glass walls were lined with giant buttons of sayings back in the day. So we had time to kill & had lunch @ their cafe which was also mobbed. I had to have the Summer of Love Melon & Cucumber Salad which was very good. Healthy & Tasty. The museum highlighted the first gathering called The Human Be-In which was held @ Golden Gate Park in San Francisco in January 1967. The gathering of The Tribes with poetry & music. This event led to the rise of Haight Ashbury, The Hippie Movement, The legendary Monterey Pop Festival & then to Woodstock. People seem to take these outdoor concerts for granted. This is where & how Pop Culture all began. They had Jerry Garcia's Hippie Diploma along with his Americana hat. Janis Joplin's pocket book was also on display. They had a room from top to bottom of an endless array of concert posters of back in the day. You were enveloped in it. They also had another room which simulated You being on a Psychedelic trip. There was also a room where lights Color & music collided - the very beginnings of Pre MTV, music videos & dance clubs. There were giant shag pillows you sat down & got totally immersed in the happening vibe. Wavy Gravy's  Rainbow Jumpsuit was also featured. Then Levi's had a fashion display of all the clothes  of the 60s & 70s on mannequins in many of the rooms. Some of the clothes were cool, others were hysterical & still others you could wear today.

No outside food or drink allowed, though they didn't make us throw away our unopened box of cookies, instead asking us to put it in our backpack.\n\nThey have a very diverse collection of art, from modernism to impressionism, glass art from Chihuly, landscape paintings, classical portraits, African masks, and some abstract. It's a different theme for sections of the museum. Whoever creates the gallery spaces does a good job of putting the right pieces together, as it made our stroll through the galleries more enjoyable. It's very open so you'll never feel too crowded and you can appreciate the art the way it is. Even if you're not into art, I think there's something for everyone at the museum, and part of fun is finding something interesting. \n\nIt's a little amusing how much security there is here - they just stand in the corners watching people. Can't imagine mysterious art thieves swooping down to steal a glass statue. And for those of you who like taking selfies with art backgrounds, they allow no-flash photography at this museum.\n\nIf you really want to be thrifty, you could come here before 4:30 to check out the observation tower... the come downstairs around 4:30 to enjoy the gallery. 40 minutes is enough time to look at the art they have, but seriously this place is huge so I recommend coming back to really appreciate the art. I'll have to come back some day.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

What a coup for us to be able to see the Dutch Mona Lisa right in our backyard.  \n\nAll featured exhibits including the current Oscar De La Renta is for an additional fee if you are not a member.  However, this time we were there to see a special exhibit that was included in the general admission price, the Royal Hawaiian Featherwork: N\u0101 Hulu Ali'i, most of which is from the Bishop Museum in O`ahu.  Although I have seen most of the pieces on a previous visit to the Bishop, there were pieces there from private collectors and universities around the country and world like New Zealand.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-20", "description": "The de Young is one of two \"fine arts museums\" of San Francisco, the other being the Legion of Honor. It used to include the Asian Art Museum, which was one half of the pre-1989-earthquake museum building, but that is now a separate entity.\n\nI cannot recommend either the Legion of Honor or the Asian Art Museum enough. They are both fantastic, well-curated, worth-the-admission museums. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the deYoung.\n\nFor the record, I have been a member of the deYoung since around 1988 (again, pre-1989-earthquake). I remember there being a wine and chocolate reception in the museum itself when I first joined, and being able to wander the galleries during the reception where both the security guards and the docents were chatty, professional and informative. They don't offer such receptions any more, and the security guards and docents are best avoided, as some of them are downright nasty.\n\nThe deYoung is a victim of its own success. It's not worth the price of admission, unless you truly want to see either an exhibit or a specific piece. Unless you can get in for free, the view isn't that amazingly better than many of the other high-rise view opportunities available to tourists in the City. It's always crowded, parking is always difficult, and while public transit is available it's either a long walk or undependable. I don't find the deYoung up to the caliber of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (or LACMA, where I was also a member) and it's no Met. It's simply a brag-piece, the purported flagship museum of San Francisco, and really, if you missed it, you wouldn't be missing much. Again, the Legion of Honor, though smaller, is much, much better and the Asian Art Museum downtown is exceptionally breathtaking.\n\nWant specifics? The architecture of the new museum, both inside and out, just fails on every level. It does look like a giant, frumpy designer handbag made from the hide of an endangered species. How appropriate for the elitist clique that inhabits the governing board of this museum. The interior is cold, not well-navigated, and kind of feels smaller and less grand than promised. And whatever curator is kissing the ass of certain persons on the governing board seems to feature a lot of special exhibits of contemporary clothing designers over all other types of art. Really? It's not a specific costume museum. For costume, you'd want to visit the Met or LACMA. Why else are there so many special exhibits geared to the tastes of emaciated socialites who are the only ones who can afford such designers in the first place?\n\nEither the staff and volunteers are demoralized, or they've been trained to treat visitors as badly as possible. I would challenge the \"unlimited museum access\" with a membership - I had the person checking me in snarl that I'd already been there four times that month. I like visiting the museum, especially when I'm studying a specific piece, or I'm blue and need cheering up. Apparently, that's an issue. And then there was the security guard who snatched my sketchbook and told me that drawing in the museum was not allowed. I can't even - I had a small book, about 3 X 5, and I was using a mechanical pencil. How is that against the sketching rules the museum has laid out?\n\nEven the special \"support groups\" the museum has are severely lacking. I joined the Textile Arts Council, which promises seminars, workshops, field trips, even international travel opportunities. Which amounted to a couple of things a year. Hardly worth it. I very much wanted to access the library in their \"Textile Study Center\" but while I indicated an interest in certain books they had, I was told I'd need to present my thesis beforehand and have several professor recommendations in order to use it. And that I should probably check for the books I needed on Amazon first. Oh, okay. Wow.\n\nMaybe the best thing that can be said about the deYoung is that it represents the municipality where it's located - it's difficult, expensive, elitist, forbidding, plastic and doesn't deliver.", "author": "Ingrid J."}

The history of each item is posted stating the dignitary it belonged to, how they obtained it, i.e., gifted by the King or queen, and who's collection it now resides.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-03", "description": "It's hard to figure out what the de Young is about. Unlike other museums, like the Asian Art Museum or the SFMOMA, it doesn't have the main point of the museum in its name. Overall, you'd describe it as an art museum, but what kind of art museum? Even w/the Legion of Honor, you can hone it down to mainly old European art. But the de Young seems to be a random mishmash of all types of art & artifacts. I wonder how they decide to put a work of art in the de Young, Legion, or SFMOMA. What I can say for sure is that the de Young & other museums don't have Asian art because that all goes to the Asian Art Museum. \n\nI've always thought the interior design/architecture was the best thing about the de Young. It's very beautiful inside, & they paid a lot of attention to detail, like those tall, narrow windows on the 2nd floor that look down to the gorgeous lobby area, or that little horizontal area w/floor-length windows that look down to the pretty patio/garden area. The cool details of this museum reminds me of the East Asian library at Cal, which seems to have also been designed by very detail-oriented architects.  \n\nIn recent years, its been the thing to put a LOT of pseudo-profound, provocative thought into the design of museums & other destination buildings. And even compared to other renovated museums in SF, they put A LOT of thought into every aspect of the de Young's look. I guess they wanted this to be a defining feature in Golden Gate Park - something outlandish, the way they've liked to design important buildings since the late 90s or so. People have forgotten that the de Young is all about that ugly tower, & the view of the city from the tower, & the pretentious copper siding of the building that's supposed to turn green (verdigris) over time to blend in w/the greenery of the park. \n\nI've always thought the de Young's collection was pretty lame. But if you're in the mood, like if you're in the mood to read a difficult, overrated 19th century novel, then exploring the de Young's art is semi-interesting, in a reflective & introspective sort of way. You can feel proud of yourself for enjoying culture & for pretending to understand the very difficult-to-absorb wall plaques introducing the art of the region. It seems museum wall plaque writing never took a hint from Strunk & White or whatever, & museum jargon takes precedence over readability. Or maybe it's just hard to absorb stuff written on a wall as opposed to a book or something online. \n\nThere's a deep, dark, unpopular part of the museum full of Guinea art & artifacts. I bet 90% of the people visiting that section didn't connect it to Guinea art - they don't make that obvious. All the random tribes & locations they mention in the placards are things you've never heard of. And they only have one big sign in front saying it's Guinea art, w/no map, like they have in other museums, to orient you visually to where it is. And that whole large, dark area also has Native American art, and if you go further in, it's African art, with no real delineation between the vastly different cultures on different continents. It seems the museum makers were being subconsciously stigmatizing, throwing all the non-Western stuff into one large, dark area, w/o really making it clear what is what, and putting all the European/American stuff into pretty, brightly lit rooms. \n\nThere's a lot of interesting aspects of this museum. The cafe seems like it should be something, but the espresso drinks are mediocre. The patio is really nice, & the garden/green area is pretty romantic. I have a vague idea that the greenery area at the patio is one of the few places that stands out as having fall colors in SF. There's actually a little pond & some nondescript \"nature\" nooks outside the museum, but those seem like an afterthought, and they haven't put much work into the upkeep of that area. \n\nThe top level of the museum store has a lackluster selection that seems very dated & overpriced. I'm not sure who it's supposed to appeal to. But the bottom level of the store has the more interesting art-oriented stuff, like prints & art books. It's kind of like the SFMOMA store, except less pretentious & less focused on modern art. \n\nThe de Young has a lot of very expensive-looking, put-together, well-dressed young people, like at the SFMOMA & Legion of Honor. Like a lot of SF, the crowd at the de Young seems conservative, yet slightly edgy at the same time. It's intellectualism & academia - you think you're all that, but you're just falling into the Keeping Up With the Joneses sort of elitism that you aspire to. The de Young, like most other museums, is a very aspirational sort of place. \n\nOverall, I don't think the de Young is worth a visit for locals unless you come on a free day. There's plenty of free days - the usual free day of the month, as well as the free first weekends for Bank of America cardholders.", "author": "Valle H."}

This was an epic view, though a bit of uneas for those with vertigo. \n\nIn general, much of this museum (08/16) is dedicated to ancient artifacts from the Americas, Africa, and Pacific/Oceanic Islands. Clothes, tools, furniture, instruments, masks, jewelry, weapons, sculptures...the list goes on and on. I loved the variety of cultures this museum provides exhibits for. Naturally, I'm quite familiar with art from the Americas, but I was amazed by the African sculptures, New Zealand Maori carvings, and the Indonesian textiles. Never seen a Pacific Islands collection like this!\n\nI imagine the price here is a bit steep, and I acknowledge that part of my great experience was getting in for free, hahaha. Parking across the street at the Cal Academy of Sciences is also ridiculously expensive. \n\nIn all honesty, if you are a lover of museums then you simply must come visit de Young!", "author": "Stephen R."}

A museum volunteer/employee tainted our experience almost from the start. The employee who took our ticket payment was so very kind and pleasant. He explained where we should place an adhesive decal on our shirts to indicate we'd paid. Yards away, we encountered another employee who was ensuring people who were entering an exhibit space were wearing the decal. She was loud, and incredibly rude to all the patrons climbing the stairs to the exhibit room. These were people who'd just paid for admission and were conspicuously wearing the decal. She loudly demanded to see the decal from yards away, in an otherwise quiet area. These people had all just walked past her, none of them running, or moving aggressively. It was extremely unpleasant. We'd walked within feet of her for a few minutes before climbing the stairs and she yelled at us too. She'd clearly posted herself in a poor position to view the decals. That was her choice. The interaction was terribly unpleasant and not the way I want or expect to begin a museum visit. The museum itself was alright, though I did not think the exhibit spaces were organized well for traffic flow. There are some interesting pieces, and the observation space was lovely. The museum's backpack policy was odd, too. Most museums require backpacks to be worn in front. This museum requires them to be carried below the waist, which is most uncomfortable. It doesn't accomplish anything either. There were several pieces displayed below waist height that could be damaged by someone carrying a bag this way, but not by a person carrying a bag above the waist. There are ways to preserve the art and remind people to be spatially aware (of the art and other visitors) that don't require patrons to be uncomfortable throughout their visit.

It seems easy to get lost and even easier to get overwhelmed by everything around you so a plan is key.\n\nYou will definitely enjoy your visit here no matter the day or time you swing by, so you really can't miss; just learn from my mistakes and chances are you'll enjoy it much more!", "author": "Emily S."}

Time to fix that situation.\n\nThe line for tickets was surprisingly long for 2:30 PM.  First stop was the American section, heavily influenced by European art obviously, with portraits, furniture, historical settings, landscapes, statues, and silverware galore.  My favorites are still the landscapes; the detail captured in each sunset-lit mountain and forest is extraordinary.  Further on was the impressionist section and post-impressionist work, including two paintings by Salvador Dali.  Overall, it was fascinating to see the transition in art style, particularly in painting more realistic faces.  \n\nOn the same floor were statues and masks from New Guinea, Northern Africa, and Indonesia.  Quickly skimmed through this section.  Interesting contrast to the American artwork, but most of the pieces were made fairly recently (mid-1900s) so I wasn't struck by a sense of authenticity.  Still, it was fascinating to see how all these different cultures designed their gods and their rituals.\n\nBack on the first floor, decided to check out the Mesoamerican section.  Wow.  This section is definitely worth checking out.  There are so many well preserved artifacts that are 1400+ years old, both murals and clay figures, that it's kind of mind boggling to think about.  Also it was fascinating to learn more about Mayan culture through the figurines, tools, and art displayed.  \nThis section leads into the modern art wing, first through sculptures and then to the paintings.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-29", "description": "As every child has his/her secret place, James Turrell's Three Gems is a secret space of the de Young Museum, tucked into a grassy mound in the Osher Sculpture Garden. People who live in the city at present need a secret place like Three Gems. Those people are swept away by city's indiscreet wave; the crowd and circumstances that they don't even know. Furthermore, they let the things around them go before they form their opinions about them. Within the city, we lost our chance to stop and think about the reality. There is no break. If we keep living in this way, we will eventually drown. However, Turrell's artwork is like a secret place in the city which allows people to slow down their tempos and rest themselves from their hustle and bustle lives. I firmly believe we need places like Three Gems to think about our surroundings and to reconnect with nature.\n\nI visited Three Gems before I realized that Turrell is a renowned artist/pioneer in the Southern California light-and-space art movement. Even though I barely knew the artist, Three Gems was very impressive. I was surprised not only by its size but also by the way he arranged the experience of the artwork from the beginning until the end. The sculpture is part of a series of Turrell's work called Skyspace. This permanent artwork was commissioned for the de Young Museum in San Francisco by Mr. and Mrs. Osher in 2005, and it is free during the museum's open hours.\nWhen I visited the place, it was the middle of the day. The weather was perfect to enjoy the artwork. First, I had to walk through a short tunnel cut into the hill which makes the work more unique and raises more expectation. Then, I faced a cylindrical space carved out of the hill. As I was walking along the chamber, I finally entered inside the dome through an open door. There was a stone bench which ran around the circumference of the chamber allowing visitors sit and view the sky through an oculus cut at the top of the dome. Viewers' perceptions of the sky color are subtly altered by LED lightings inside the dome during night visits, which is an optimal viewing time. The sculpture also provides a great experience during day time by changing based on light and weather conditions outside the chamber. The light from the roof shines a spotlight into the room. Upon first encountering Three Gems, I felt a great calm over me, and I think that wasn't just for me. While I was staying the place, a lot of visitors sat on the bench silently for several minutes, absorbing the light and the passing of the clouds above. It was a perfect moment. \n\nWithin city nowadays, it is all about fast, fast and fast. There is no doubting the word \"rapid\" represents the city. There is no space or time for people to slow down and look back. Everything began to change so quickly after the tech tsunami in 2012. According to Rebecca Solnit, \"the tech culture seemed in small and large ways to be a culture of disconnection and withdrawal.\" I am not saying accepting the emerging culture is a bad thing, but this phenomenon fabricates the world around us, and people just follow it, not looking at the negative or positive effects of it. In the interview with Michael Govan, Turrell said, \"we live within this reality we create, and we're quite unaware of how we create the reality.\" In the city, I feel I'm in a wave. There is no point that I can stop and sort out my thoughts. Although this rush city tries to disconnect people, we need to have something that reconnects the city back to people. \n\nFrom Hito Steyerl's journal, she mentioned, \"contemporary art is not only about beauty. It is also about function.\" Regarding function, Turrell's work is a sculpture, but at the same time, it is a great interactive art that brings people together. While I was staying at the place, I saw some visitors use the space as a cafe or any chair in the park. They talked about their daily lives such as their kids and jobs. Few other visitors utilized the place as a Buddhist meditation chamber. They just sat on the bench for a while quietly and looked up at the sky through the hole. Three Gems genuinely brings us towards nature and community.\n\nAccording to Jerry Saltz, he said public spaces in the city became a simple getaway. Three Gems is not viewed as much as it is entered and experienced. Seeing the sky, which we do daily, but through the dome was an entirely new experience; sit down on the bench, close eyes, and try to experience the changing atmospheric conditions outside of the dome by hearing birds' twittering, feeling the sunshine and fresh breeze, and smelling the grass. Three Gems successfully lets viewers fully experience the artwork itself. The artwork reconnects people and nature. Lucy Lippard said, \"nature includes everything, even technology, created by humans, who are part of nature.\"  In that sense, it is even more integral to have places like Three Gems within a city to retreat and have a moment of peace and reflection for ourselves.", "author": "Ji Won Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-01", "description": "Probably more remarkable for its architecture than its actual art collection, the de Young is nevertheless is a must-see when visiting Golden Gate Park.  While there are some notable works here by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Diego Rivera, Georgia O'Keefe, and others, the majority of the artwork, especially those on the second floor, are anthropological in nature - objects from the Americas, Africa, and Oceania.  What really stands out here is the building's copper-plated exterior designed by architectural firm Herzog and de Meuron.  As time passes, the building's brown color will assume a greenish hue to match the surrounding environs thanks to oxidization - a process that has already begun in the years since the museum's re-opening.\n\nOf the things you can do here, I would highly recommend the following: First, be sure to check out the observation tower, as the views of the area are spectacular.  While you won't find the stunning panoramic views of San Francisco like you would at the Marin Headlands, you will have a lovely view of the Academy of Science, Golden Gate Park, and Sutro Tower.  You should also be able to see the Golden Gate Bridge and the Transamerica Building  peaking out over the tops of not-so-distant hills.  I'm under the impression that you could get away with visiting the observation tower without a ticket, as nobody seemed to be checking stickers or tickets from the entryway to the elevator.  And, second, don't forget to visit the Osher sculpture garden.  There are many interesting sculptures that are sure to entertain children and adults alike.  The pathway leading up to James Turrell's \"Three Gems\" is like a secret passageway lined with bamboo.  The structure itself is striking and peaceful, and it's interesting to see how people react when they realize how their voices have echoed upon reaching the center room.  There are ceramic apples littered around the grounds that are perfect for funny photo opportunities. Like the observation tower, I'm under the impression that you don't need paid admission to enter the area.\n\nOtherwise, take advantage of the fact that admission ($10 for adults / higher for special exhibitions) to the de Young also counts as admission to the nearby Legion of Honor - another smaller art museum with classical architecture that specializes in European artwork.  If you come early enough in the morning, especially on weekends, you can often find street parking along Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive.  If you're not willing to circle, then there are garages underneath the music concourse.  Either way, there's so much to do in the area and in Golden Gate Park that it's not a problem if you have to pay for parking.\n\nUnless you read every caption, listen to the audio tour, or need frequent breaks, you probably won't spend the entire day at the de Young.  This isn't the Met.  But, that's okay; museums shouldn't gobble up all your time when there are so many other awesome things to do in the surrounding area!", "author": "Greg T."}

I tried to make this a free trip by finding street parking instead of garage parking so the closest you can park is on 10th street. It was around 1pm and I was luckily able to find one parking spot so hopefully you are lucky too. If not, there are garages with hourly rates. We originally tried parking near the Ocean and looking for the shuttle but the shuttle stops were nowhere to be found and it is a pretty far shuttle so might as well try to find parking. General admission was free but if not, it is $23 without the special exhibits. My friend forgot his card and check so the lady told him that he could download the app and sign in and got in for free. That is nice.\n\nThe rooms are pretty big and you can see most of the second and third floor but the first floor and some of the rooms are blocked off if you purchased general admission. It took us about 2 hours to go through everything. There is a mix of sculptures, paintings, and fixtures so I really enjoyed the variety. There are a few rooms that go through US history and it reminded me of AP US history haha. You must go to the Hamon Tower on the 9th floor and check out the view. It is free and you can see the rest of the park including the Academy of Science. It reminded me of the Empire State Building but obviously not to the same extent. Definitely worth a visit :) \n\n\n**TIPS**\n1) I am not sure how long free admission will last but this weekend may be your last chance with your BOFA card. My friend was able to download the BOFA app and got free admission, so maybe they will let you here. If not, bring a check as proof.\n2) Go to the tower and go to the 9th floor for a nice surprising view.\n3) Cafe food is decent and feels so smancy fancy.\n4) Enjoy!", "author": "Amy H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-02", "description": "Visiting art museums is one of my favourite things to do. Living in SF, I really, really wish I had better things to say about de Young. \n\nLet's start with the positives:\n- the viewing gallery offers a great view of San Francisco\n- it's located in a very beautiful part of Golden Gate Park\n- the building itself is quite handsome \n\n... and that's about all I can think of. \n\nTo be fair, I didn't spend a ton of time in the permanent collection area. The collection of American paintings seems extensive, but I found the arrangement quite hard to navigate. \n\nNow I will start ranting about my most recent visit, and sadly it's a pretty standard experience I've had with de Young so far. \n\nThe exhibition:  Oscar de la Renta: The Retrospective (a blockbuster exhibition just from the title).\n\n1. Ticket price: $38 with audio guide for a less than 1-hour exhibition, that's more expensive than most European museums. \n\n2. Getting into the show: On our first try, my friend and I got there at 12:30 pm. We were running a bit short on time, but the lady at ticket counter ensured us that we could finish by 1:30, so we proceeded with the purchase. However, when we got to the entrance the staff said we needed to wait till 1pm to get in. Naturally the first attempt was a failure, but luckily we were allowed to change to tickets for another day. This time, we were again told to wait in line for entrance and all the staff seemed very impatient (maybe due to how popular this exhibition was). But we got in nevertheless. \n\n3. The curation: This is a super interesting theme and they have some very exciting pieces of work from Oscar de la Renta, but the curation was very odd. Here's why: \n1. In the first room, the dresses and the explanatory signs were not arranged in matching order, which was very confusing. \n2. Some dresses were placed facing away from the audience with the intention of showing off the details on the back. However, in most exhibitions the mannequins would be placed in front of a mirror so people can see the front as well. Well, not de Young (at least not until the last room). \n3. All of the dresses on display were made to measure, therefore they don't always fit the mannequins. In the souvenir book of this exhibition there are photos of clients wearing the dresses and descriptions of the occasions, but these details were lacking in the actual exhibition.\n4. One of the rooms was showcasing how the designer loved gardening and was inspired by gardens. There's a gigantic TV showing the views of a garden, but there was no description of where this garden is from whatsoever (we found out it was the designer's garden in the souvenir book)\n5. There were some random objects on display to help creating the atmosphere of a theme. For example, in the part where they show the oriental influence on the designer, the curators put a huge Chinese style vase along the dresses. There was an explanatory sign for the vase, but it simply says \"borrowed from the mayor's office\" (what? why?) without giving more details on which era it's from, or country of origin. Given that this is in a fine art museum, I found it very underwhelming. It'd have been better not to put any signs at all. \n\nI've been to 4 or 5 exhibitions in de Young, and was disappointed by the curation every single time. Given the ticket price for these shows, I probably won't go back any time soon.", "author": "Rachel Z."}

The Keith Haring exhibit (Google him, he's famous) was a whopping $29, plus another $7 for an audio guide.  Apparently this institution knows something I don't, because there were massive crowds lining up to see just that, while the permanent collections were almost devoid of visitors.  Or it might be that people had to line up for tickets to ask basic questions like \"where is the exhibit entrance and can I buy a ticket separately?\" because there were no visible signs indicating entrance location or that you could buy regular tickets at the same counter as the (heavily advertised!) Keith Haring exhibit, for 70% less.\n\nAlso, they REALLY don't want you to drive here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-02", "description": "It has been almost two years since I have written an update on the deYoung! I went there today because it was first free weekend on Bank of America. However, the general admission does not cover the special exhibitions. I used to be a member, had to give it up because of lack of funds. (Temporary condition for the time being.) I also take advantage of the first free Tuesday of the month as well at the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco aka the deYoung and the Legion of Honor. \n\nThe last time I was here at the deYoung was for the \"William S. Paley: A Taste of Modernism exhibition and the \"Rudolf Nureyev: A Life in Dance.\" I successfully passed my online modern art history class; much of it was inspired by visiting the Modernism at the deYoung. Much of the art that I read about and was discussed on the forum boards was featured in the exhibition. Much of Picasso's works were featured here at the deYoung; was quite surprised that Mr. Paley (the head of CBS) owned much of Picasso's work, especially the cubism and the synthetic cubism. I was also surprised to see Renoir, Matisse, Cezzane, Gaughin, and Derain, to name so many.\n\nI saw the Rudolf Nureyev exhibition last time I was here; this exhibition was the principal reason I made a return visit today.  I am taking another humanities class and one of the required assignments/elements is to do a write-up of a museum exhibition or a theatrical performance. So I figure, combine the two arts by writing about the exhibitions dedicated to one the premier male ballet dancers who devoted his whole life to the art and craft of ballet as a dancer, choreographer, director, producer, actor, and visionary. He made the role of the male ballet dancer more than just a partner, frame, and accessory to the ballerina. Other than Baryshnikov (who forged his own path), no other male ballet danseur comes to mind who has made the impact that Nureyev has in the world of ballet.\n\nI have had the pleasure of seeing Nureyev dance while he was still alive. Before he was famous in London when I was a sprog, aged ten in one of those full-length ballets. I remember he was very, very funny.  Ballet is supposed to be a very serious craft, and here he was making the audience laugh. I saw him dance with Natalia Makarova in SF; do not recall if it was \"Giselle\" or \"Swan Lake.\" (I think it was \"Giselle.\")  And the last time, was as a guest artist with The Royal Ballet of Canada. (Still have the program in my archives.)\n\nI say go see \"Rudolf Nureyev: A Life in Dance\" before it closes; last day is February 17. \n\nAll I know for sure is, there is nobody like Rudolf Nureyev these days who lived to dance and danced as long as he lived. Definitely one of a kind.\n\nYelp Update #1 for 2013.", "author": "Chiara A."}

Ok, the Concourse can be a little overwhelming for a newbie. Just pull in on Fulton Street (if you are coming from 19th Ave like I do) and follow the signs. If there are no spaces, you will have a wait until security lets you in. No worries, just turn your car off and hang out. Once you are allowed in, drive slow and keep driving until you get to the floor of parking that is also the entrance to the museum. It really can't get any easier!

On a separate occasion we were in really early before almost anyone else was there and my daughter sat on the steps behind where the ticket desks are. A different guard told her I'd need to get her up as others could be coming down. Like I wouldn't have done that if there were others. Another occasion, yes another one, a member of staff barked at my two year old for being about a meter from one of the guard rails around a picture, even though I had my arms around her waist. Utterly bizarre over reactions on each occasion. Totally unwelcoming, really old fashioned.

I have wanted to see this exhibit about the SF World's Fair from the Victorian era.  I have read books about the one held in Chicago and as a kid recall going to the Palace of Fine Arts where the Exploratorium use to be.  So yes, I was very excited about going to this museum.  \n\nBut sadly, I was disappointed with the exhibit.  I expected to see more.  It was just one small room with a few sculptures and paintings.  Perhaps if my boyfriend and I paid $8 for the guided tour headphones it would have been more fascinating but we did not want to pay that!

There is a good variety of stuff to look at and they constantly change their special exhibits. I only come here on free days, however, and they charge extra for those exhibits, so I've never seen one. On top of that, the workers I've encountered are usually dismissive and even slightly rude. I also felt like the security guards constantly followed me because I was carrying a backpack (don't recommend you bringing one if you come here!). It just created an uncomfortable environment for me when I was just trying to look at and enjoy the art.\n\nWith that being said, there are some pretty cool things about the museum though! I like the location of the deYoung, situated right in Golden Gate Park with a nice, serene area around it. I also love the architecture. It's definitely not a kind of aesthetic for everyone, but I love the geometric, blocky structure. \n\nLike many reviews have said, the highlight of this museum is definitely the observation tower!

I usually stop there first for lunch despite the ludicrous prices.  From there, I have to walk a whole block to the members' counter to get my ticket then all the way back to the elevators to get to the sometimes questionable exhibits (I'm referring to the lame \"Summer of Love\"). The ticket counters are placed for the convenience of the drivers and we muni riders are completely disregarded.   Because of my disability, I need to sit down periodically.  However, the benches provided are so low that I need someone to help pull me up from them.  since I usually go by myself, this becomes awkward.  \nThe kicker is that the last time I was there, they have removed the gender designations from the excellent restrooms so that now it is a free-for-all!  There were some men in the former women's room, looking uncomfortable and some women who were confused.  This is so ridiculous.  I have no objection to a transgender person using any restroom he/she deems appropriate, but I do not want to share a restroom with a strange man.  This is just downright creepy!\nAs for getting home, as there is no bus stop going back the way I came, I must either cross the huge concourse to the Academy of Sciences or make the long walk to Fulton, risking getting run over by cars and bikes on JFK drive.

If you have a particular appreciation for that type of art, this (sadly) is probably the best place in the SF Bay Area to enjoy them.\n\nThe whole museum feels limited. For the somewhat expensive admission price (~$20 including special exhibits), it's a rather small art gallery. You can browse through all the rooms within an hour. But I suppose that's an American thing. Similar museums in Europe often take hours to walk through.\n\nSpecial exhibits rotate periodically (there should be a new exhibit every several months), but there are usually several exhibits that will remain there throughout the year. Thus there's very little point in getting a membership unless you really love exploring every new special exhibit.", "author": "Nathan Y."}

The sunny cafeteria with outdoor patio had a variety of sandwich options and the line there was well-managed. Even the gift shops were well run, with interesting books, jewelry and reproduction art. What disappointed me was the exhibit.\n\nI don't know why the museum staff constructed a time-limited Georgia O'Keeffe showing which focused on her early painting around the Hudson River Valley. It looked little like her final works and did not highlight the creative process that changed her into a great artist.  Extracting a snippet from any artist's life leaves an incomplete impression and I would describe the show as lackluster. In my opinion, the most fascinating story a fine arts museum gets to tell is a narrative/visual about the gradual development of talent in one unique individual. \n\nThrough personally observing the unfolding of the creative process young people are often drawn to try art. There were many teens in the crowd, but that was not the message conveyed.  A few decades of an artist's early works is only a fragment of their career. It is the shifts, the failed attempts and the final evolution which fascinates us, demonstrates perseverance and culminates in self-expression. That is what intrigues many of us. Judging by the volume of visitors, it's unfortunate that the museum failed to include examples of the artist's work all the way until late in her career.

Don't get me wrong, the various types of art on display was amazing; however, the staff could use some major work. Never have I felt so disrespected or embarrassed! It's only natural to want to take photos of some of the art within the museum, I will admit we may have stepped too close to one of the paintings but we in no way, shape or form, had any intention of doing harm or touching. In comes one of the rudest \"employees\" I've ever come into contact with shouting at us to step back and not touch the painting. \n\nFirst, we are adults here, there's no need to shout, had you POLITELY requested we step further back we would have happily complied, which is what we told this gentleman, he in turn said, \"I don't care how you think I should do my job. The only thing you should be touching are the elevator buttons\"  WOW REALLY?!! We weren't even trying to touch it! \nSecond, where are the posted signs that say you have to be 2 feet away? \nThird, what would you say to people who have a hard time seeing the tiny print next to the paintings?!! Would you treat them the same way?? \n\nTrust me, as a nurse, I've had my fair share of old, crotchety people to deal with maybe even worse, but this was unbelievable.

I regret not doing so!\n\nSo to the ASSHOLE of an employee who marred my first experience at this museum, thank you for also making it my last.

Most weekends though it is \"free\" museum day though de Young will just have it at a discount price rather than have you go in for free. \n\nEach floor of the building has unique art styles from different periods of time. When I went, the bottom floor was mainly modernized art where as you go up higher in the building you'll see much older types of art like pottery and such. If they ever have the Asian Art Exhibit again, I recommend checking it out. \n\nThere is a park area in the front to hang out or take a nap or whatever if you don't want to go inside... There is another interesting museum nearby so if you purchase tickets for the art museum you should be able to get into the science museum for cheaper or maybe free.", "author": "Scott F."}

Building is a mystery tour of nooks and crannies, odd angles, and a lookout tower that's like a tree house above the park canopy. Their permanent shows are inspirational and I never tire from them, their rotating shows bring fresh blood and excitement. The current Turner opened my eyes suprisingly to his expressive work that is both detailed and expansive. \nGreat coffee in the cafe, great outside sitting area, make sure you go into the dome, opening nights are a blast of San Francisco at its best - young hipsters to wealthy established family patrons all decked out in their best.

Well, too bad.\n\nMore important, however, is that the lighting is absolutely terrible.  Incredibly dim.  Sometimes you have to read the info sheets to find out what color something is!

He was a street artist and social activist, who fought for public art so all could enjoy his work. He also taught art and collaborated with kids in underprivileged communities. I was excited to see that the de Young had a special exhibition devoted to Keith Haring, but was highly disappointed that they charge $29 per person for it. Entrance fees for world-class museums such as the Louvre in Paris and the Van Gough museum in Amsterdam are much more affordable. Such a hefty entrance fee is in opposition to what he stood for. Keith Haring died years ago so not sure if the museum or owners of his collection are making all the money, but it is very sad they did not honor the spirit of his artistic expression. \n\nI have attended special exhibits at the de Young before and do not remember them costing so much. There are some extraordinary pieces in the regular museum collection, but I feel the pieces lack cohesion. The flow of the pieces/collections seem to be a little disjointed. The architecture and rooftop views are impressive though.", "author": "D. P."}

One can wander through, and be lost in the exhibits - from ancient (carvings from Arizona Native Americans) to modern (Picasso, et al.) and beyond. \n\nThe only thing that mars my enjoyment of the museum is the rude, un-family friendly, attitude of some of the security guards. Today I was told I could not babywear my baby on my back. I was told \"backpacks\" or \"things worn on backs\" were not allowed.  My daughter is neither a backpack nor a thing. She was happy and smiling until Kevin Allen, Security Supervisor, said I couldn't wear her on my back. She was on my back so we could both face forward and see the srt. After he made me take her off, happy baby became screaming baby - which I'm sure the other visitors really appreciated. \n\nI very much think the museum should rethink its outmoded policies and join the modern world of baby wearing!", "author": "Audrey W."}

I didn't find it to be particularly impressive or even well organized, and I wouldn't rush to go back.\n\nThe other big negative was that that tickets with the special exhibit were almost $30 dollars.

First, if you go the first Saturday of the month and you are a Bank of America cardholder, the price of the exhibit and admission to the museum is only $15 ($25 regular price with $10 Bank of America discount).  So do not buy your ticket online ($21) thinking it will be cheaper!  The BOFA discount gets you $10 off and admission to everything.  \n\nWe accidentally went to the Olmec exhibit first (downstairs where King Tut was).  It was ok.  Then we saw what we came for on the upper level.  AMAZING!  They had so many pieces.  The funny thing was that the items were commissioned and donated by the wearer of the item so the dresses and outfits were different sizes and not a standard size as you imagine on a runway.  One of the dresses was too big to put on a mannequin (they left the wearer of that dress unnamed).  They had the good stuff in the back (bolero jackets, flamenco skirts, matador hats and sequins, wedding gowns, and Balenciaga's versions of the little black dress).  They had two-piece skirt suits, ball gowns with elaborate sequins and draping.  I wished I could touch the pieces!  That was the only element that was missing that wouldn't be possible anyway =(  I love touching fabric.\n\nThey tried to showcase 360 the pieces by putting some of them in glass boxes but a lot of the pieces were on a static display so you could not appreciate the back and look at the layering up close to figure everything out.  \n\nWe should've waited until Picasso to see this exhibit, but I couldn't wait!  I highly recommend it.  Now I have Balenciaga exhibit postcards to add to my collection of Chanel exhibit postcards from the MET.  =)  They were only $1 each.\n\nParking is a pain.

I remember going there back in high school and just loving all the work on the walls of that old train station. That's probably why I love the Impressionist period so much. All the paintings were displayed in such a great, rustic way. No in a stuffy museum, but open train station. When I heard the artwork was coming to a museum near me, I bought tickets right away.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-28", "description": "Keith Haring's Untitled (Three Dancing Figures), Version A, Edition 2/3 (1989) is a public sculpture that has been in San Francisco since 2001, and has been moved multiple times since its original installation. The sculpture depicts three brightly colored cut out figures in traditional Haring style (similar to human outlines or stick figures). Their arms are in the air in different positions and they are bending their knees or kicking to create the motion of dancing. They are twisting in a circle on a black plastic base. The figures are created in the primary colors -- red, yellow, and blue -- and have a glossy finish that reflects surrounding movement. It is made of painted aluminum and weighs 3,200 pounds.   Keith Haring was a part of the pop art movement and had a political focus on the AIDs movement and the gay rights movement. Haring died in 1990 after a long personal battle with AIDs. Untitled holds a certain level of subtext relevant to San Francisco's political history, however it remains within the realm of art generic enough to be considered publically acceptable. \n\nSan Francisco is seen as a progressive city, especially surrounding gay liberation related struggles. By featuring a sculpture that exudes celebration, brightness, and acceptance, the city attempts to bring joy and city pride to the public through art.  This is one of Haring's more celebratory sculptures, but it fails to create a political message past a childlike lens of basic differences (the only separation between figures is color, and they are bright and primary, so the sculpture is easily non-politicized). As Matthew Bajko, a journalist from the Bay Area Reporter, puts it, \"the piece depicts a trio of enmeshed figures that resemble larger-than-life characters that have escaped from the children's board game Candy Land.\" A lot of public art is made to avoid politicism; in order to sell most public art it has to be detached from political sore spots in the community.  Despite the piece's background, it still falls into the realm of generalized, uncontroversial public sculpture. At a deeper level the piece has a message of inclusivity and appreciation of humanity. The figures are separated from gender binaries, and their bright colors could represent different ethnicities coming together, or the LGBT community (the symbolism of the rainbow flag). \n \nUntitled was originally located on the corner of 3rd and Howard streets in front of the Moscone center and across the street from SFMOMA.  In 2012 the sculpture was part of a large public art restoration project funded by ArtCare, San Francisco's fund dedicated to maintenance of the Civic Art Collection.  The majority of the restoration funding came from the Keith Haring Foundation, which donated $65,000 in comparison to ArtCare's $10,000 contribution. At that point, the sculpture had been there for a decade and showed signs of negligence. By restoring the piece, the city showed renewed interest in maintaining its public art collection to pique interest. More recently the piece was moved to the front entrance of the de Young museum for an exhibition of Haring's work. Moving the sculpture questions the importance of public art placement. If Untitled is as successfully received in front of the de Young as it was in front of the Moscone center, does that make it diverse and malleable, or simply ineffective? Public art is typically put in spaces where it's visible but not attention grabbing enough to control a space, so in all fairness, the piece may be equally effective because it wasn't given the centrality it deserved in the first place. Most site-specific public art pieces end up being moved at some point, and although it changes the artwork, it doesn't have to ruin its purpose. \n\nIn fact, the move from the Moscone center to the de Young wasn't the first time the piece changed locations. This sculpture wasn't originally commissioned by the city of San Francisco or by the Moscone family. It was made in New York in 1989, one year before Keith Haring's passing, and was added to San Francisco's art collection over a decade later. By moving this sculpture from New York to San Francisco, a part of its original intention was taken away.  Haring visited San Francisco several times and enjoyed the city, but it wasn't his original grounds for working or living. He represents the concept of celebration, and the deeper concept of equality, but that doesn't mean he's representing San Francisco as a whole. In the time since its original placement in 2001, San Francisco's environment has changed drastically. Despite its liberal history, the city is at a point where people who have lived there for decades are being displaced. This occurs even more so for people of color and people in the LGBT community , so even if in the past Haring's sculpture held representative qualities for San Francisco, its political message is slowly becoming obsolete.", "author": "Alexandra C."}

But Georgia O'Keefe is worth it, so that's not my real issue.\n\nWe went in through security, bought tickets, went through the ticket check at the entrance to the exhibit, and then about 100' feet into the exhibit, an employee comes RUNNING over to us, and tells us we have to exit because jogging strollers aren't allowed. There were strollers everywhere. But JOGGING strollers evidently are a big no no. Nobody said anything at any of the three points before, including when we paid. We saw no signs. And nobody could explain why. We went to coat check as directed to check the stroller, unpacked everything... do you know how much stuff you have packed in a stroller with a baby? lol. And then we were told we couldn't leave it there either, we had to get security to check it into a closet. Where there would be no ticket. And they weren't sure where it was. At that point, I was beyond fed up. \n\nOnly high point - with a manager's help, we got our money back.\n\nSeeing art shouldn't be so hard.", "author": "Kristen M."}

This work is easy to be missed when you go to the museum, because it is hidden at the back of the garden. Just the experience of this work made the museum visit totally worth for me. You sit inside a round chamber with an oculus cut in the roof throughout which you can see the sky. Due to LED lightning inside of the chamber and the way the chamber is built I felt like I was sitting both inside and outside, and the sight of clouds slowly passing by, while all sounds from the outer world are muted, is super restful and brings you in a contemplative mood. I never did any meditation but I think this work had a meditative impact on me. A great work of art, so please do not miss it.\n\nhttp://deyoung.famsf.org/about/site-specific-art-commissioned-de-young/james-turrell-three-gems-2005", "author": "Sarah X."}

I asked someone who looked official. He told me to go to the will call line. There was someone sitting there with a closed sign in front of them. After about five minutes the window was opened. I was told that I already had a ticket. At a minimum there should have been signage telling people with bar codes what to do. After going through this frustration, I wasn't in much of a mood to enjoy the art.\n\nAlso, the way the stanchions for the line was setup there was only about an 18 inch space for people going in and out to walk through.

My one quibble is that these works deserve close scrutiny to appreciate their wonderful detail. L. mentions that in one etching of Rembrandt's banker (who helped him out of bankruptcy), the banker is seated amidst a collection of art works imported by the Dutch East Asian company. Behind him is a seated Buddha sculpture and, when L. finally got through the crowd and up close to look with a magnifying glass, she could read millimeter sized Chinese characters on the statue's \"apron.\" The guards didn't appreciate her proximity to the piece and it was made somewhat uncomfortable by the odd placement of the large floor registers blowing cold air up right in front of the etching.\n\nSo after seeing the exhibit, you might check the gift shop, your local book store or, if necessary, Amazon, and think about purchasing The Complete Etchings of Rembrandt: Reproduced in Original Size (Dover Fine Art, History of Art) so that you can take time to examine, with a magnifier, these master works.

The Birth of Impressionism exhibit was amazing last year and I suppose a little surreal since the last time I had viewed those same paintings was after college standing in Paris (paintings were from the Musee d'Orsay).  And last week I went to the Picasso exhibit and got to marvel at his work progressively through his lifetime.  Really interesting to see his work live and arranged in the chronological order of his years, reflecting his changing moods (and lovers).\n\nAll and all I'm a fan of this museum.  It's a great place to take in an interesting exhibit, wander the halls of the larger museum, and maybe relax in the cafe with a glass of wine.", "author": "Robin L."}

A comparator is the Guggenheim (more architectural marvel than enjoyable museum) to Central Park.\n\nAnyways, the de Young was hosting a Warhol exhibit, and our host was a huge Warhol fan. I was skeptical (fan, I'm not). But after attending, yeah, I was impressed. The exhibit chronicled the life of Warhol, from crazy to crazier. It was a fascinating glimpse into the deranged, popcorn culture mind of a genius. At times, it made you feel sorry for him. At others, it made you want to be him.

While I was walking through the rooms looking at his amazing collection of timeless works put together into one collection, I realized that there is a very high probability that I'd never see most of these pieces again in person and also that I'd probably never see them all together like this.  \n\nAside from the Picasso exhibit, they have a great variety of other art.  They have some traditional American art spanning the late 1700's to early 1900's.  They have some modern and abstract works from local and international artists.  Some cultural pieces and sculptures spanning the Egyptians, South American civilizations, etc.  All very intriguing to look at, discuss, and enjoy.  Plenty of diversity so any art fan could enjoy.  \n\nAlmost as entertaining as the art for me was the structure and architecture.  Very, very impressive design.  You must go to the 9th floor to catch the view(although a good chance that it'll be overcast and foggy).  Walk around the outside and check out the pond, the framing of the structure, etc.  \n\nVery reasonably priced.

I'd been to the modern art museums in Chicago and New York, and as much of a Bay Area fan that I am, those other two cities had the De Young beat hands down for a long time.  And where the Guggenheim and Metro are still much larger than the De Young (although the De Young's collection is spread out over more than once facility; Legion of Honor), this new renovated facility has much increased and improved the amount of space and therefore art that one can see.  It now takes more than one day to see the whole building and collection, whereas before you could breeze through there in an hour or so to see mediocre art from various periods in US and California history.\n\nHowever, if you go there, be aware that if you on a rainy day  (as I did today), or a day requiring outer wear, that there is a Coat Check on the lower level.  As I bought a ticket and walked through with my black raincoat, cap and laptop in its case strolled over my shoulder, I seemed to grab a few looks from people.  Oh well.\n\nThe museum store is exceptionally well stocked, and the prices for the big coffee table books are about on par with what you would pay at a major chain bookstore.  And the gift shot / bookstore is two stories, and exceptionally well stocked with books on artists of various disciplines and their work, including a very healthy section dedicated to kids and young adults.  There was the usual postcards, t-shirts and other merchandise, but the books and DVDs on art were what caught my attention.  Regrettably the one DVD I wanted, the documentary on Maya Lin, was not there, but a host of others were, including one about two middle income art aficionados who amassed a great collection of art \"on the cheap\" (an award winning documentary).\n\nThe place is now almost too big, because I skipped the lower level exhibits, the tower, and another wing filled with art from another area of the globe, though today I did manage to see the Polynesian art as part of a collection of the Hawaiian exhibit that is currently being featured.  \n\nLarger, more art, an exceptional art oriented bookstore, and for a museum the prices are actually reasonable, I think I got more than my money's worth, including seeing docents in training as they lectured artists who sat on the floor asking questions about the displays.  And, the museum was busy.  Before the De Young always attracted a certain amount of traffic, but now it truly has art aficionados visiting.\n\nAs usual Golden Gate park has some issues with parking, but I was able to park my vehicle securely under the Academy of Sciences and walk to the De Young.  New exhibits, including pieces I had only seen in books, and which I could get close to and look at, including the famous Polynesian mural, I'd say I got more than my money's worth.\n\nDefinitely worth visiting at least once.", "author": "Blue G."}

Yet the people seem to hold my interest more than the art.  The children were having a great day out, oblivious to anything but freedom and space.  Small groups with a guide seemed to be learning much, maybe too much, about each item observed.  Somehow I felt more comfortable at the de Young than most museums,  I could pick just a few things to examine without a worry that I had missed something important.    \n\nThe de Young is perfect for Golden Gate Park fitting into the vibe of San Francisco, a relaxed encounter with a few wonders of art.

When we first walked in, we thought that the mannequins were actual people but it turns out they used a projector for the faces. So creative! It must've taken the team hours to re-design all the clothes and style all the mannequins and I'm glad they did because it was really cool. I also learned something new! haha I didn't know JPG was the mastermind behind Madonna's like a virgin corset. It was pretty cool. My fave was the crazy wedding dress that took him 300+ hours to make and the coat jumper with matching thigh-high boots on the circle runway thingy. I snapped a lot of pics =) JPG is so talented. His fashion is definitely something I dare not wear but love to look at. I would love to see his runaway live.

And the small but quality collection of ancient artifacts, including an actual mummy and a Roman sarcophagus! Then a stroll over to the Asian Art Museum for more tasty wonders there. Coming here was an almost heavenly experience when I was younger. I suspected things were 'going South' when they exiled the European art to the Legion, and definitley knew it when the Asian collection flew-the-coop to Civic Center pigeon land. All that was left was American and Tribal folk art. Not that that is a bad thing.\n\nI've purposely avoided the new De Young for years, but decided to check it out finally. On approach, it has all the appearance of a rust bucket B-29 assembly plant left over from WWII and once you get inside, has all the charm of Walmart/meets/Hilbert space. Museum guides that have all the charm of annoyed ocelots cajoling old ladies and tiny children, DHS style on little infractions of absurd improprieties.

In those days, any joy or amusement associated with visiting museums was paralyzed by an academic objective. Now that I have a more heightened understanding and appreciation of of history, genre, and craftsmanship, visiting the de Young is a treat, not a dreaded assignment.\n\nIt's evident how much sweat was invested in beautifying this once earthquake-ravaged museum: with its dramatic copper fa\u00e7ade, palm-lined landscapes and conservatory flitting ribbons of light through the leaves onto the grounds, it's lovely and intelligently designed and staged for the large influx of daily visitors. \n\nThe de Young includes tremendous collections from several periods throughout American history, ranging from 1670 to present day. Highlights include Neoclassical; Victorian and realism; the Hudson River School, and Social Realism and American Scene. Some pieces are frighteningly realistic (e.g. Thomas Hovenden's \"The Last Moments of John Brown\"); others are ethereal and dreamy (Henry Alexander's \"Scene from the Mikado\" with Louise Paullin). Others masterfully tell a story, recalling a simpler time pre-dating the advent of technology, civil rights and women's suffrage (Grant Wood's \"Dinner for Threshers\"). \n\nOn exhibition through August is \"Picasso: Masterpieces from the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso, Paris\", which I was so fortunate as to see without booking reservations months in advance. It was an admitted privilege to stand mere feet from paintings I've created a veritable monument to in my bedroom: \"Portrait of Olga\", \"The Matador\", \"Wounded Bird with Cat\", and Rose Period works I confess I strongly prefer to the Cubist works. If the breadth of this collection is indicative of the de Young's other visiting exhibitions, I will DEFINITELY be returning for the Masters of Venice exhibition in October.\n\nAnother work on my \"Must-See\" list: Al Farrow's \"The Spine and Tooth of Santo Guerro\" (look at this thing up close!), which pierces you with its painstaking detail. This is one prime example of an artist not allowing his creative intent to be stifled by an overt socio-political message manifest in splattered paint and glued-on \"found objects\".

The second floor had the most stuff but I liked the things on the first floor the best (especially the Mesoamerican art). \n\nThere were security guards in every room (probably to remind people not to touch or sit on any of the artwork) and we got scolded by a crabby old security lady for standing too close to an art piece. We were looking at a picture of George Washington made out of  over 200 $1 bills and it was behind half inch glass so I don't see why we had to stand 2 feet back. She had no issue with us getting really close to the Rembrandt painting the dollar bill piece was modeled after (which I assume is more valuable and for some reason not behind glass or any sort of protective casing).\n\nThe gallery in the lower level with the Modernism exhibit was a huge waste of money. We paid $11 extra per ticket and spent all of 2 minutes down there.

I never wrote a review on an art museum which is unfortunate as I was an art history major at college. I have a deep appreciation for art. I went to exhibitions like the 2-part series of the Musee d'Orsay Exhibition at the de Young and \"Picasso's Influence on American Art\" at the SF MOMA. During those times I never wrote a review for either exhibition and I enjoyed both of them. Let this be my first art museum review.\n\nI specifically came here for \"A Girl with a Pearl Earring\" Exhibition. As you enter this exhibition there is the complimentary exhibition of \"Rembrandt's Century\". I recommend checking out \"Rembrandt's Century\" first before heading to \"A Girl with Pearl Earring\". The Rembrandt exhibition details engravings during the 17th century. It provides you an insight of art in Holland during that time. However personally the number of works displayed in this exhibition is overwhelming. You don't have a chance to grasp each work. My previous experience is when there are too many works to look at you get fatigue. Overall the Rembrandt exhibition is a nice way to start an exhibition. On the other hand I did prefer \"A Girl with a Pearl Earring\" much better than the Rembrandt exhibition. There are 35 paintings on this exhibition. These paintings were highly selective for this exhibition. As the saying goes \"quality over quantity\" and \"A Girl with a Pearl Earring\" fits this description. For both exhibitions I highly recommend the audio tour to get insights.\n\nI can't wait for another great exhibition at the de Young.", "author": "Gerald R."}

The entire building is of peculiar awfulness, but it is the tower that it is the true abomination. It is completely out of place in its surroundings; when catching a glimpse of it while walking in the Richmond, I feel insulted and depressed.\n\nWhat I hate more than anything else is reading reviews in the NY Times, etc. telling me how glorious the building is. I know it's as arrogant of me to deny the joy it may offer as it is for the cognoscenti to dictate an aesthetic knowing full well the average person will find it perverse. But make no mistake: it IS perverse. The de Young demands that people deny their visceral reaction, their natural sense of what is beautiful and pleasurable, and instead reach for a conclusion that is condescending and elitist.", "author": "Bob S."}

Since the arrangements are located throughout the museum, you need to pay special exhibition price to visit during this time ($20 adults/ $16 students). The ticket will allow you to see the Warhol and the Yves St Laurent special exhibits as well.

Face it, while the Old museum was once based on a grand 1915 PPIE structure, once shorn of all its ornament it was just as ugly as this one, and the interior was dowdy to boot.   I'm not sold on the ugly flooring, which looks like pavers, or the built in bench seating that seems more appropriate to a waiting area in Knotts Berry Farm,  but the tower view is still as impressive as ever, and still free, and now that the buzz has long since fallen away, you can tour the museum's collections without having to fight your way to the wall and back out again.  \n\nBut oh those special exhibits.   What crowds.  Can't the museum find a way to handle them?  Why am I paying extra to feel like I'm on a subway at rush hour?  How is that conducive to the experience of Art?\n\nIt is nice to see that the Music Concourse, following the completion of both museums, is now back to a glory it knew only in decades past.   All three fountains are working; and only the grass around the Francis Scott Key memorial looks worn.  This part of the park at least is the only part that looks like a park in a wealthy city like San Francisco, and not some broke rust belt burg out east.   I didn't see any turtles in the fountain though---were they nesting below water?  Or have they been removed.\n\nThis isn't one of my favorite institutions in San Francisco, but don't let that keep you away.  The tower is certainly a place to take out of towners.

That's what makes the DeYoung more inviting than many others in the city.\n\nThe copper covering of the building hasn't oxidized enough to melt into the surrounding greenery, but I imagine that'll take a while.

With a toddler in tow, we visited this museum on a rainy Saturday morning. The street parking was plentiful and the short walk to the museum was pleasant with the arboretum and the Japanese Garden along the way. Once inside, we were told to go to lower level coat check to hand in our jackets and umbrella.  That was fine.  \n\nAfter the elevator brought us back on the ground floor, there was this bench in front of the museum store right across the elevator.  There was not an artwork in sight for at least 800 feet. My son seated himself on this bench so I took some photos with flash.  Immediately this guy approaches us and says no flash.  My husband and I are the artsy fartsy kind of people-and we know the 4-1-1 of museum etiquette/policy, having been around all the major and some lesser museums around the world.  This was way ok though.\n\nWe spent about 1 hour at the de young museum and to make the long story short, (1) we were told that I had to carry the small backpack-purse I had IN MY HAND, not sling it on my back, all the time while at the museum. What kind of dictatorship is running this place? The backpack purse holds all of my wallet and cell phone, fer Pete's sake.\n(2) we were warned sternly not touch anything by this security dude because my 3 year old son was pointing at one of the glass encased exhibits.\n(3) my toddler got tired, as toddlers tend to do when they walk around a bit, and wanted to be carried.  My husband gave him a piggy back ride and once again, the security huffs over and tells the husband to put the tired kid back down on the floor.  At this my husband and I exchanged meaningful glances and left the crappy museum.\n\nOf the exhibits themselves, sure, there are plenty of interesting articles.  Mediocre collections really, but hey, considering the newness of the place, the museum has to start somewhere. The architecture of the place is very airy and every angle of the structure from inside is art itself.

It's true with most exhibits that you notice different things the second time around.  I ended up with nearly twice the number of images I got the first time.  The crowds were much thicker than they were on my initial visit, but with one week remaining before the exhibit closes I'm sure it will be wall to wall people for the next several days.\n\nThe de Young Museum has long been a place that I go to to let my mind relax.  Long before the current building was even designed I'd frequent the old museum building with my drawing tablet and my charcoal pencils, sit in a quiet gallery and sketch out an old painting.  Among my favorites were William Michael Harnett's \"After the Hunt\", Alexander Pope's \"The Wild Swan\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RJ3NiTTSl00iT-Hu0-2ktQ?select=a5T860X1u3UhBRj9ZBfeJg) and Samuel Marsden Brookes' \"Salmon Trout and Smelt\".  Pope's piece was probably the easiest to sketch of the three, but I was pretty baffled with the different tones of gray on the Brookes piece.\n\nI still do quick sketches inside the museum these days, but my taste in art has become much more simple.  Among my favorites are oil pieces such as John Singer Sargent's \"Study of Architecture, Florence\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RJ3NiTTSl00iT-Hu0-2ktQ?select=RsEeAHZi-bMjjzPCBJn4og) and George C. Ault's \"Highland Light\".  I found another one that I really liked just recently in George Henry Durrie's \"Winter in the Country\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RJ3NiTTSl00iT-Hu0-2ktQ?select=eYcyup6b5aBtuFTG-6JgSg).\n\nFriday Nights at the de Young are fun too, but I prefer early morning weekday visits to avoid the crowds.\n\nMaya Lin's Systematic Landscapes opens in October.  I wonder if I'll procrastinate on that exhibit as well.\n\nThe Chihuly exhibit closes on September 28.  If you haven't seen it yet you're really missing out on a real treat.  Here's a link to my Flickr gallery where I've posted my low resolution email size photos:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/14144647@N06/sets/72157607267102277/", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-22", "description": "\"The DeOld was so much BETTER than the DeYoung.\" or \"Honey where did you park the Battleship?\" \n\nIf you are a native San Franciscan or even a transplant like myself chances are that you remember the DeYoung in its classic, symmetrical, real museum form. If you are a normal person with a non warped sense of aesthetics you will remember that the old museum was much better and more harmonious as an architectural feature of the park and was much more pleasant as an exhibition venue. \n\nSince the damage incurred in the 1989 earthquake some demented mind  decided  it was a \"fabulous\" idea to further the scar and  to replace San Francisco's beloved fine art  museum with a lopsided monument to a rusty, holey, battleship as interpreted by a drugged out architect with a Star Destroyer fetish. The building is an absolute travesty of gimmickry and weird odes to Dr. Suess as executed in perforated copper sheeting. As a classically trained architect/artist I find the entire thing to be a sort of egotistical expression of aesthetic rape by some Swiss nutcase who decided to erect a copper monument to his nation's cheese in Golden Gate Park. The \"modern\" museum already looks dated and like a gimmick/practical joke that fell flat with no hope of recovery. If interpreted artistically it can be seen as as  a politically offensive testament to WWII and the Doolittle Raid since it looks just like an aircraft carrier pointed at the ever so charming and blessedly traditional and  non modernized Japanese Tea Garden.\n\nAnd now for the interior and the exhibits. Entering the old DeYoung was a treat for the senses, the reflecting pool, the stately tower, the grand entrance and such had the charm and old world beauty of a museum from an Indiana Jones movie, Now the entrance is through a dark, dank hole that has all the charm and grandeur of a banana republic airport. We visited in the rain and were treated to an extra dose of visually depressing. If you are looking for the reflecting pool it has been relocated at least in some sort of broken and mangled reinterpretation to the side of the crooked, holey ship.\n\nArchitecturally speaking the building is an exercise of rubbish ergonomics, wasted space and stairs that hurt even the most fit of ankles and knees. The established exhibits are as always great but seem to be smaller and less grand than what used to be there before. The changing/visiting exhibits are definitely a hit and a miss. For each \"Girl with the Pearl Earring\" \"Pre Raphealites( more of those please)\" or \"King Tut\" or \"Maya\" exhibit we get forced to stomach something like the current Keith Haring travesty or a double dose of Hockney. Sorry but as one of only two fine art museums in the city there should not be several months of family unfriendly exhibits such as the Haring travesty. 80s pop art with pornographic imagery ( devils engaged in oral sex) does not belong at the DeYoung. Museums should be a venue for ALL AGES to learn from the accomplishments of the past and not to be mentally warped by the imagery of some infantile, pretentious \"artist\" of highly debatable \"talent\".  These are exhibits that already have a venue called the MOMA and for each Hockney/Haring type of thing that shows up at the DeYoung I am wondering how many John Singer Sargent or Anders Zorn exhibits show up at the MOMA? If they do perhaps I will switch museum allegiances.  That said there is a reason I am not a member at the MOMA and that is because I do not like modern art but I respect that people do and that they have that museum to fulfill that need. Please respect us, the classical art enthusiasts by not wasting our precious memberships on exhibits that belong in a completely  different venue. Rock concerts do not belong in the Opera house and Opera does not belong in a rock venue, same with visual art.\n\nI am giving it 2 stars since I ADORE some of the permanent art also love many of the visiting exhibits but would love less stuff like Haring and more classics. The staff is generally AMAZING and wonderful but then that is the nature of museum people in general and they deserve the credit tenfold. The location is beautiful but sadly the building is abhorrent at best. Also as a European transplant to SF I have to say the prices here to visit a museum or the Academy are OUTRAGEOUS !! Apparently it all used to be free until the 80s. Yay\" Progress\" !!", "author": "Aud S."}

He finds that it's inexusable that a piece of artwork with a gumball machine drawn on it is art and sold to museums for millions of dollars. I do find them interesting and yes, I will create my own modern art someday. \n\nThe other parts - mostly upstairs is the ancient arts and artifacts from different parts of the world - Africa and the Pacific Islands mostly. I think it's pretty cool that they have all that artwork and artifacts to educate people about different parts of the world.

For example a collection of cloths owned by some rich pretentious jerk is not my idea of a museum visit ( I can go to the local thrift store and see the same stuff in the old lady section). I guess the curator/s feels that he/she has to appeal to the bourgeois talentless artless crowed and so these type exhibits persist.  \n\nAnyways there are great exhibits as well such as the recent King Tut collection which I enjoyed immensely.\n\nIf you want a feeling of a real museum go to the Palace Of Fine Arts.", "author": "Sheva B."}

And the place was packed with a big line.  I was lucky in that I got tickets from a museum member so we went through the \"VIP\".  But still, we had tickets for a specific day and time.  Saturday at 2PM. They aren't messing around.\n\nOkay, so the de Young grounds and the building are awesome.  Just as an example, on the side of the building there's a zoo like area with caged animals.  All the animals...sculptures.  Not bad.  Even a Mark Rothko hater such as myself can appreciate this.\n\nAs for the packed exhibit hall... it was packed but well run.  They do a good job of getting the hipsters from point A to point B.  It took about 1.5 hrs to go through all the rooms.  After seeing all those masterpieces, you feel like you've seen something special ...even if you don't completely understand it.  \n\nLooking at the other ray ban wearing hipsters, I got the feeling that some were out of their element as well, but glad they tried it.

To compare this to the the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay just doesn't add up. San Francisco is very fortunate to have a small part of their collection made public to the residents of the Bay Area as the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay had many other options but chose to ship them here for us to see.\n\nDo expect to be crowded in, the De Young is doing it's best to accommodate as many people as possible into the exhibit so just expect to be bumping elbows and making new friends as you browse the art work.\n\nThere is a parking garage, but it is expensive.

Well I will give them 1 star on average because the membership ticketing desk is always really nice and are 5 stars. \n\nI cannot wrap my head around what is wrong at this museum.  Either I just have the bad luck of always doing the wrong thing JUST at THIS museum or the staff at this museum really\nhave an incredibly stringent training process that beats into them that under no circumstances may these rules be broken and if someone comes in with something that they obviously don't know doesn't belong there (like someone actually brought a banned item on purpose), or appear to be doing something that's creating a problem, you should treat them like they're trying to get away with something.\n\nFirst let me preface with the fact that my son goes to museums with us. He's been to tons of museums and seen different exhibitions and has been to the Legion of Honor regularly.  They are amazing at the Legion of Honor. Never a problem. But Literally every time we are at the De Young we get admonished about something that makes no sense and always seriously in the most condescending and/or rude way possible. For example once I was in a walkway, but no one was in the walkway. I was visibly struggling to get my son out of the walkway while struggling to pull the stroller. A cafe worker comes over to me and rudely looks me in the eye and says, \"Mam. You can't stand there.\" I tell him, \"As you can see I'm doing the best I can.\"  He gives me a look and walks away.  \n\nI get the no backpacks on your shoulder thing and happily comply.  But some of the other things they haven't allowed just don't make any sense. I wasn't allowed to check in my son's balance bike so that I could just buy a book from the gift shop. I promised I wasn't going to sneak into the museum. I just needed to buy a book.  But they wouldn't check in his bike.  I've never had a problem at any other museum if I hand carry the bike so I didn't bring a lock. In the end they said I could leave it all the way in the parking lot as the bike could not enter the building. The risk I take was that the museum holds no responsibility if it is stolen. And I just wanted to buy one book from the gift shop that I could see from the check out point. Less than ten feet away. You're killing me.\n\nYes I get you can't bring in bikes and I understand why, but if you use common sense you can see that the bike is smaller than a stroller. And you can check in a stroller. Why can't the check in policy be based on the size of the object? I definitely understand if they said I couldn't bring the bike into the exhibition areas of the museum, but even if I tried to sneak into the museum after being let into the gift shop, they still have ticketing checkpoints at all the viewing areas.  I mean really? In the end I bought a book because we were late for the bday party when I should have just nixed it and gone across the street to the Academy of Sciences.  I love the kids books and toys buyer at the De Young and Legion but I'm not buying there anymore.  I'm going to take note of the cool things there and buy them somewhere else.  I can't support someone who isn't going to support me.  And you know what? Based on my conversation I can tell that since I'm not a fancy donor they don't care either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-18", "description": "I went to the DeYoung yesterday to see the Keith Haring exhibit, and decided to take the time afterwards to check out the rather extensive African and SE Asian art collections the museum houses. Here's how the DeYoung decided to curate the collections: You walk up a staircase to a large picture window which forces you to turn left or right. Turn to the left, and you see a dark room with a solitary Dogon (Mali) statue of a woman. The rest of the gallery is obscured by walls and darkness. Turn to the right and you see two galleries, one bathed in light and featuring a large oil painting of a waterfall, the other dark. Well, guess I'll just turn all the way around and see several brightly lit galleries containing brightly colored art from post-Columbian America.\n\nThe art in the African and SE Asian collections is mostly wood and iron sculptures and ceremonial pieces, durable works which I am assuming could stand the light of day (or at the very least, artificial light), whereas the delicate oil paintings from 18th century America require special care to prevent peeling and erosion. Nonetheless, the shades are drawn on the non-Western galleries and the shades are wide open on the Western ones (the same principles also apply on the main floor, where the pre-Columbian American art is similarly draped in darkness).\nWhat message are you sending, DeYoung? Is Africa a dark, scary place devoid of people (because there was NO ONE in any of the non-Western galleries, while the well-lit, Western galleries were teeming with crowds)? The curation also left something to be desired, with all the placards referencing stale art critiques about how little \"we\" know about the art, but that it probably references \"gods\" or \"traditions.\"\n\nIf a big chunk of your collection is non-Western art, why would you actively work to make it inaccessible by plunging it all in darkness, unless to make a larger cultural point about art? The \"3 Hours in the DeYoung\" brochure that highlights the \"must-sees\" indicates only one piece from the extensive African collection to see, the solitary Dogon figure that is the FIRST piece in the collection from the main entrance, so that you can quickly glance at it from the atrium before heading back into the light (a similar treatment of SE Asia is also accomplished). Meanwhile, there are many, many must-sees from the other half of the collection, that from post-Columbian America (in all those well-lit spaces, no less!)\n\nThe absolute crown of this whole enterprise was the enormous painting in the post-Columbian America section that faces the SE Asian collection (from a well-lit space). It features a large scene of \"explorers\" landing upon a shore full of indigenous Pacific Islanders while some puritanical folks arrive on a boat. ARE YOU SERIOUS? You have a wildly colonial depiction of what probably is a precursor to outright genocide, conveniently juxtaposed next to your large collection of art from Papua New Guinea. What. The.

Today was I think my third time, that's averaging about once every 7 years...I'm not too fond of this place, it doesn't have living animals like the zoo or Academy of Sciences. I know, IT IS A MUSEUM, I don't think I appreciate art enough to come a few times a year, like I do with the zoo or Academy. Maybe if I was more intellectually inclined, I would understand and appreciate this place a bit more. I guess I shouldn't compare this place to anything, it stands on it's own.\n\nThroughout the museum...I saw paintings, sculptures, art, & my fav part of the place is upstairs. Upstairs at the tower (9th level) has a GINORMOUS map of SF and a view of the park. This is probably THE BEST attraction here. There were people pointing out where everything was...that was sort of annoying.

De Young people should go to the Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe De Young has plenty of galleries with an emphasis on Western Hemisphere art and decorative art. Unfortunately, none of the works knocked me off my feet. The organization of the works was also unsettling where periods are freely mixed. The pieces exhibited were not from top tier artists and not the best works from the artists that are represented. I hate to say the De Young is a second rate museum, but it's a step below the top museums in comparable-sized American cities and even by San Francisco standards as I prefer the Legion of Honor and the SF Museum of Modern Art.\n\nThe observation tower is nice, but the overhang is too low and I needed to hunch over to see straight out. That seems like a huge design flaw like building a car where the driver needs to duck down to see out the front window. Besides, I like the views (of water and the Golden Gate Bridge) from the Legion of Honor better.\n\nI'm also not a fan of the building. The exterior is dark and sullen that reminds me of a militaristic stealth design. The interior layout isn't helpful either. Part of the reason it took 90 minutes to get through the exhibits was the zigzag floor plan that was hard to follow along with waiting in line for the elevators to the observation deck.", "author": "Brian U."}

Stocky, and pseudo Moderne, the old building looked more like an abandoned utility factory.  The new building is very urban, and reminscent of the Art Brut period of architecture, which has been redefined a eco-tech in this building.  Lots of use of natural materials, and asymmetry, make it compatible with both the park setting and the city scape int he background.  \n\nWe went for the first half of the Impressionist exhibit.  Since I always do everything at the last minute, and hope for discounts, I got tickets to the twilight show, just before closing.  These included dinner in the Museum Cafe after viewing the show.\n\nThis show had the great benefit of being less expensive, there was ample parking, and there were no crowds entering when we did, apart from a private cocktail party.  We also took brilliant photos in the near sunset light outside the museum.\n\nThe show itself was fascinating, and beautifully curated to show all the work leading up to the full expression of Impressionist art.  It made great intellectual sense to see how the prominant the influences, such as the Barbizon School of art, led to the development of Impressionist work.\n\nThe new De Young is a welcome addition to the already scholarly Bay Area assortment of art venues.", "author": "Saralee S."}

We are fans of all forms of art, so we have a natural appreciation for whatever collection might be showcased.  The viewing tower was probably our favorite part.  It has 360 degree views of beautiful San Francisco.  We were fortunate to catch it on a clear day so it was spectacular!  Lunch at the cafe wasn't as disorganized the day we went as some of the reviews say.  Since it is the only place to grab food in the museum, expect there to be a line.  We went with the menu items instead of the grab-n-go stuff and were very pleased.  The food is actually quite gourmet, considering it's just a museum cafe.  And if you are there for a long day and need a PM break, I would recommend you go back to the cafe and have a cup of coffee and the fruit tarte.  It's done well.  What also makes the De Young (and other museums in the pavillion) particularly fun to go to, is that there is so much else to explore outside of it.  You can literally hit up another place, like the Calfornia Academy of Sciences or the Japanese Tea Garden because it's all right there too!  Admission for 3, including the Oscar De La Renta exhibit cost me $60. Not bad.  I think the lunch at the Cafe cost just as much.

They have new/special exhibits all the time so make sure to check the website before you visit.

I'm an architecture student so I'm going to solely put my review on the architecture itself.\n\nThis building is an art of beauty, the different angles of the building allows great photographs and the materials chosen for the building is just brillant. The corten steel changes over as it weathers and the small pocket green showcases inside is a great relief as you are roaming inside. I find the layout of the museum a bit confusing, but maybe it's because I have no sense of direction. I was also to check out Maya Lin's exhibition while I was there so that was excellent. Which means that I had been there awhile back.

I say museum and not gallery because there are more than just paintings here and several displays are interactive. \n\nLike many, I came here primarily for the Jean-Paul Gaultier special exhibit, but I was also interested in the regular exhibits. I love fashion and I'm thrilled that I moved to SF just in time to see the first-ever showcase of Gaultier's entire body of work right before it leaves North America. The exhibit runs until August 19 and I highly recommend checking it out even if you think high fashion/haute couture is not your thing. The breadth and depth of Gaultier's creativity is astonishing. His use of non-traditional fabrics in couture garments (denim, wool, etc. overlaid on silk tulle and chiffon in evening gowns, for example) is remarkable. His impact on modern culture is legendary--Madonna's cone bras, the corset dress, the use of shark skin, are just some of his famous contributions to the world of fashion. He is the genius who inspired future designers like Alexander McQueen (whose fashion exhibit at the Met last year was also breathtaking). \n\nThe rest of the art at the de Young spans many styles, eras and cultures. There's pretty much something for everyone with the exception of pre-18th century paintings. There aren't very many of those. However, you can find everything from Chihuly to African art to Native American artifacts to colonial-era furniture to a cute little sculpture garden where you can let the kids run free while you sip tea on a beautiful patio.\n\nMy favorite pieces at the museum:\n\nCornelia Parker, \"Anti-Mass\": An incredible abstract sculpture with an amazing interplay of lines and angles\n\nFlora C. Mace and Joey Kirkpatrick, \"Watercatcher\": Fantastic use of ordinary materials\n\nHoward Ben Tre, \"The Lightness of Being #4\": Gorgeous color in a classically-shaped sculpture that evokes images of bygone cultures or magical fantasy worlds\n\nKaren LaMonte, \"Dress 3\": An amazing way to showcase a dress, especially after viewing the Gaultier exhibit. And let's face it, the cast glass is pretty\n\nGustavo Grunewald, \"The Niagara River at the Cataract\" and \"Horseshoe Falls from Below the High Bank\": A lovely, simple painting of the Falls\n\nGottardo F. P. Piazzoni, \"The Sea\": At first glass, this might not seem all that interesting, but stare at it for a few minutes and you will feel an incredible sense of serene calm\n\nAdmission to the museum is free the first Tuesday of every month and special exhibits (like the Gaultier one) are reduced price ($10 instead of $20). Unfortunately, today is the last free admission day before the Gaultier exhibit ends, but regardless, it's still worth checking out the museum.\n\nTIP: Walk or take the bus to the museum instead of driving/biking. Walking through Golden Gate Park's lush flowers, trees and vegetation is the perfect way to whet your spiritual appetite before enjoying all the art at the museum.", "author": "Josephine L."}

It could be seen that lots of time and effort was put in everything.  The same could not be said for this particular designer exhibit. \nThe clothing, what little was put on display, was all lovely but the entire retrospective took about 15 min to see and walk through, I was simply shocked at how short it was.  Previous designer retrospectives such as Balenciaga and Jean Paul Gaultier took at least an hour to go through because there were so many items see.  Also the clothing were displayed in creative ways that one could walk around the mannequin displays to get a full 360 degree view.  \nI understand that perhaps a retrospective on his work was in high demand seeing as the designer himself passed away just last year.  But rather than rushing things together, I would have been fine to wait another year for a proper display of his work too have been made; instead all there were, were mannequins put together against walls and corners (not being able to see the front or back details of the dresses).  This visit was defiantly not worth the price.\n\n***Also as a note to the museum I overheard plenty of people trying to buy tickets specifically for Oscar De La Renta and they were not able to do so because they had apparently \"sold out\" of tickets. This doesn't make sense to me as space would clear once people left the exhibit area, and there is no reentry so there could just be line made and a couple people enter every 15 min or something.  Many people, including myself come to the museum to see the special exhibitions and I saw many people leave simply because they could not get tickets for Oscar De La Renta.  This is poor planning on the museum's part and perhaps it can be fixed for the future. Or simply make certain exhibit tickets only available for purchase online that way so many people wont leave disappointed in having made a wasted trip to San Francisco.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

I rolled my eyes, and then proceeded to enjoy the antiquities.\n\nAmidst the occasional cheese, there was a good deal of real meat in this exhibit.  Unlike the last exhibit in '79 (which I also saw), about half of this exhibit was not Tut's stuff at all, but Tut's relatives.  This didn't make it less interesting though.  There were actually few of the items from '79 there, but there were also other pieces that I had never seen before, neither thirty years ago nor in any book.  It was a really nice and informative exhibit, despite corny titles for Tut like \"Commander in Chief\" which was displayed boldly on the wall above some of his tomb items.  I did have a great time here--some items brought back memories.  The museum itself looks fantastic, with great eye appeal.\n\nI remarked to a friend that this exhibit should really be called \"The Zawi Hawass Show\" (after Zawi Hawass, who is Egypt's Minister of Culture).  His name is all over it.  After the exhibit is over, you are routed through the gift shop with a huge, signed picture of Hawass on the wall wearing an Indiana Jones hat.  It's actually a promotion for the Zawi Hawass line of hats, and you can choose from a stack of hats there at the shop, the proceeds of which go to charity.

I came here to see King Tut most recently but also saw the glass art display from last year which I cannot remember the name of right now to save my review ... :\\ ... and also came here to see the regular exhibits (and one other one, again, my memory is failing ... must be all the alcohol?)\n\nFor the most part, I only got the bag check once and it was when I went to the regular portion of the museum, never their special exhibits. I didn't mind it much as the security just looked through my bag and passed me on. Sometimes their exhibits are pretty cool but other times slightly disappointing (still well presented) but it was overall a cool, educational experience every time I go. The chihuly exhibit, for example (yay I remembered the name) featured many beautiful artsy glass pieces that I thoroughly enjoyed and was very well setup to impress. The King Tut exhibit was ... okay I suppose. Not the best but it was still interesting to read with all the audio tour info. \n\nThe regular portion of the museum is a little dry, lots of historical items to look at but no real path, story or category being told or kind of sporadic in that way. I'd still come here for any future cool exhibits that show up on my radar.", "author": "Lorrie M."}

I have never actually stopped inside it though. Today, my relatives who are art enthusiasts were in town, heard the Van Gough and beyond exhibit was also in town so they wanted to go. \n\nParking was a hassle of course. We headed straight for the garages and they have a network of underground tunnels so you can just skip all the tourists and scoot out of the park when you leave. Still, we found a spot near the entrance. We had time to kill before the Van Gogh and beyond exhibit started so I went into the Art in America exhibit. \n\nConventional wisdom has it that old PreColombian art is mostly broken up and dirty but not the art here! The little bowls with ornate designs and faces from the Mayan era looked well preserved. They definitely evoked the time when they were made in South America. \n\nIn a nearby room, the modern art was extremely creative with a cathedral made completely out of parts of guns and bullets. Also, there was a colorful seashell. \n\nThen of course we went over to the wonderful Van Gough, Cezanne and beyond exhibit. The pros of this exhibit were the paintings of course which featured fantastic works such as Starry Night and the Snake Charmer. The audio tour was helpful too. \n\nThe cons of the exhibit though were that the audio tour should have explained more paintings, it only covered a few of them but their explanations were good. Also, there were too many people in the exhibit at once so it was difficult to admire a painting closely without blocking someone else. The museum people let visitors in in groups but they should have made those groups smaller. The exhibit did have chairs and I definitely needed them because the air in the exhibit was stuffy. I am very sensitive to stuffy air because one time when the air was really stuffy I...I am not going to get into it. \n\nOverall, the DeYoung Museum was a great place and I liked the exhibit but they need to let less people in at once and put in better ventilation for the Van Gogh, Cezanne and beyond exhibit.", "author": "Alec W."}

I just couldn't understand why \"the young museum\" didn't have more kid stuff!\n\nI do remember taking art and theater classes in some back rooms that were off limit to the public but that I could probably still find if the old building still stood.  (FYI, I was the Scarecrow in a product the Wizard of Oz and I flopped around all over the stage.  A histrionic triumph of stupendous, colossal monotude, as Jimmy Durante would say.)\n\n(I will get to saying something about the current museum, I promise!)  I remember the old lovely building with the peaceful turtle pond out front and the old statue in the middle of the pond.  I was happy to find that the pond and the old statue are still present, around to the side of the museum instead of in a courtyard in front.  (Don't know about the turtles.)  \n\nThe interior of the museum is just fine and the exhibits they have are excellent.  But I still have a spasm of horror every time I look at the exterior of the new building.  Why would anyone deliberately make something that looks like it's falling apart with rust?  But I love the Andy Goldsworthy art in front, the running crack in the sidewalk that starts at the street and winds its way through the main courtyard, through carefully placed stones, and finally up to the door.

The regular collection includes a good selection of relics from Africa and the Pacific Islands.\n\nThe remodeled de Young is a huge improvement over the prior space.  Not only are the exhibits consistently good, but the museum itself is much better, with more space and more light.  The only downside of all these great exhibits are the crowds.  As usual, if you come early or come late there will be more room to move around and spend more time viewing the exhibits.  The docents are pretty good and the audio tours are okay.  Make sure to set aside enough time to head up to the observation tower for a beautiful view of SF.  The building itself is work of modern art.\n\nI would recommend the cafe.  The food is tasty and includes some healthy options (that being said, the fries are pretty good).  The prices are decent too, well, decent enough so that you don't leave feeling like you've just been gouged (airports, stadiums, movie theatres).   There's a sculpture garden outside for dining and for kids to run around.  \n\nMembership and muni passes provide some of the discounts.

I work as a guest services associate at another prominent San Francisco museum, and if I ever treated our guests the way I was treated at the de young, I would not have my job for long. \n\nUpon walking in, we were immediately accosted by a very irritated associate (volunteer perhaps?) who was intent on us taking our backpacks to coat check IMMEDIATELY. She did not ask politely, merely demanded and snapped at us as if we should know not to bring backpacks into a museum that is in the middle of a giant park. Can't imagine we were the first one's dim witted enough to bring in backpacks from day at the park, but you'd think we were from her attitude. But I get it, we were happy to take our bags to coat check. We started making our way to coat check as she so politely (sarcasm) requested, and she stopped us again and snapped at us some more, saying we could not actually walk down to coat check with the backpacks on our backs, but that we had to remove them and carry them down in our hands. Fine. This we did. \n\nWe were then given our (overpriced, if I'm being honest) tickets in the form of a sticker. The obvious thing to do was to remove the sticker and put it on an article of clothing and throw the backing of the sticker away. We got into line where a different associate immediately began barking at an entire line of people to tell them if they only had the sticker and not the backing, they wouldn't be let in as the backing of the sticker was obviously (again, sarcasm) the actual ticket. My sticker was still in tact luckily but I imagine this was an issue for some, and instead of graciously welcoming us into the exhibit as we do at my place of work, she barked at us the whole way in while herding us through like cattle. It didn't appear that anyone in line was doing anything wrong and it seemed everyone had the proper ticket, but she yelled at us as through we didn't. I get that it was busy and probably stressful but that's kind of in your job description to be able to deal with that politely! I know because I have the exact same job and deal with it as well! \n\nThe attitude of the staff really ruined my experience of an otherwise beautiful exhibit, and the de young would do well to train their staff in the proper way to handle large crowds without making their guests feel so unwelcome.", "author": "Tracie T."}

I can spend hours and hours here and that's where the wifey and I don't see eye to eye. \n\nI love visiting this place and you may also say that this structure is a wonderful piece of art in it self. The architecture blends perfectly in the heart of Golden Gate Park. The tower for me symbolizes the renewed spirit to accentuate new ideas while preserving the naturally beauty of an environment. I truly believe that a civilization will crumble without artists to stimulate our senses both visually and emotionally. \n\nYou see, you cannot look at something without having a reaction to it - whether it's positive or negative, we all have that reaction. That's the beauty I see as if I'm trying to pierce into the artist's soul looking at these objects. Having a facility like this is very stimulating and we are lucky that they are available to anyone. I mean everyone. \n\nThe first Tuesday of every month is free to the public and you may choose to give a donation upon entry. This is a wonderful program as it gives access to people who may otherwise cannot afford such luxuries. If it inspires just a few person to want to create while it provides an avenue to uplift themselves, then it's doing it job for it's the artists' works of arts that will last for centuries and even millenniums. \n\nJust the thought of someone years from now who can look at an object and create that window to peer thru our time just gives me goosebumps.

You can see the brush strokes and signatures of some of the world's most famous artists and art. Unfortunately for us, we weren't able to get tickets to the King Tut exhibit. If you want to go, I'd say get tickets in advance. I heard you can get them at Costco, but you have to wait a few days to go or something like that. Anyway, we wandered through the museum's main exhibits and it was really cool. From the brick to the charred remains of a burned down church, to the little church built with gun parts and bullets.

It's very industrially modern. Odd shaped rooms and corridors. Very thought provoking even when just moving from room to room. The height (excuse the pun) of the visit was the elevator ride to the top of the viewing area. You can see the park and surrounding San Francisco hills. A fantastic view.

I'd heard good things about the exhibit, so I was amped to go (in retrospect, probably not a fantastic idea to have such high expectations... but oh well).\n\nGeneral admission was $32.50 per person for adults including the King Tut exhibit. Egads!! That's more than many of the museums I'd been to in NY and Europe (the Museum of Natural History and the Met, ahem). Whatever, it's New Year's day, we are going to start off this year learning things!\n\nWe weaved our way down the long stairs to the entry of the Exhibit. It was like waiting for a ride at a Disneyland. The entrance is metered, and these 2 double doors open into a dark movie room so you can have a 90 sec video-history on the boy-king. Way to build up the suspense.\n\nThe exhibit itself is about 8 rooms full of beautifully showcased artifacts of Tutankhamen's daily life, found in his tomb, and from his family. Lots of chairs, staffs, some jewelry, masks... but no tomb (that won't leave Egypt). In its stead you find a hologram of his tomb. Lame, but whatever. Seeing the old urns where his innards were stored (and his 2 still born daughters) was cool in a creepy graveyard kind of way.\n\nA la Disneyland, the exhibit ends by dumping you into a very well lit gift shop so you can purchase your own mini casket and walk like an Egyptian with overpriced museum garb. Yes, you can even buy earrings with King Tut dangling from your lobes. Classy! Only there is no photo of you looking glazed as you wind through the exhibition. Darn. \n\nWe went upstairs only to find that the rest of the museum had closed at 5pm. So, $32.50 x 2 for just 1 exhibit. Super let down. To maximize our admission, we looked through the museum store to see postcards of the other exhibits. The only thing I learned is that the museum store is overpriced. \n\nIn the end: King Tut exhibit: mildly underwhelming. Museum, beautiful architecture but overpriced. Lovely outdoor garden & location in GG park. Might return on a free Tuesday.\n\nDetails: No food or drink allowed. Non-flash photography OK in exhibits other than King Tut.

We got into the park around noon and saw a super looooooooong line!  I pulled over and had Lester W. ask what the line was for...luckily it was for the free day at the CA Academy of Sciences...phew!  There was no way I was going to wait if that was for the De Young.  We parked the car and made our way to the museum.  \n\nWe could've bought our tickets online, but we procrastinated and just ended up buying them at the museum.  Tickets on weekdays are $27.50 and weekends are $32.50.  Since I played hookie, I got the weekday price.  What we didn't know was that you had to wait until the next available time slot to view the King Tut exhibit.  This is where buying online comes in handy....you can pick what time slot you want, so you don't have to wait around.  \n\nThe rest of the museum's exhibits were the same as when I had visited last year, so I was went through everything really fast.  I had to kill some time by getting a drink at the museum's cafe.  When our time slot came up, we lined up to find out that we had to wait in another line downstairs.  The older I get, the more I hate waiting in line...grrrrr!\n\nThe King Tut exhibit was ok.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  It seemed like a majority of the exhibit was about his family....who his parents might be..etc...etc...  Maybe I should just go to Egypt to see the real deal.  \n\nThe De Young itself is a nice little place to visit at least once in your lifetime.  On a clear day, the observation tower provides great views of the city.  I probably won't come back unless they have a really good exhibit.  And now I know to buy my ticket ahead of time, so I don't have to wait around.", "author": "Patra I."}

The permanent collections are very nice and it's a great space that I enjoy visiting.\n\nHOWEVER... The current special exhibitions, Modernism and Native American Line Art are limited snooze-fests with poor attendance as a result.  As a matter of fact, since the Girl with the Pearl Earring and Rembrandt back in 2013, I've become increasingly disappointed with the special exhibitions. The Hockney was too much and nothing else has been all the great. My opinion is shared judging from the relative size of the crowds. \n\nI heard there was a change in the staff, and it was apparently not for the better. I say visit, but be very wary of paying extra for the special exhibits unless you've heard good things about them.

The exterior almost looks like a futuristic ship (aquatic and/or space craft like) and includes a Tower Observation Floor that looks over Golden State Park with views of the California Academy of Sciences, the Music Concourse (area between the California Academy of Sciences and the de Young Museum), and the quintessential housing that San Francisco is known for. As we looked at the area around us, the fog started to roll in. It's an eerie feeling and makes me think of that 1980 movie \"The Fog\". It also brought back memories my first time in San Francisco when I was just in grade school. We were sightseeing from the bus and saw the fog rolling down the hill. It moved so organically--like it was alive. Just in time for Halloween!

That meant passing by the SF MOMA and eventually through Golden Gate Park where that was a huge line of cars waiting to drive through. I looked over to my right through the hazy SF weather and saw the De Young Museum and my Yelp events instincts took over. \n\n\"I can get into that museum for free!\" I proclaimed.\n\nI then had to explain the Bank of America museum admission promotion that I learned about while perusing the Yelp events board to my mom and sister.

(http://www.yelp.com/events/los-angeles-its-baaaack----free-museum-admissions-on-bank-of-america) \n\nAll the pieces of the puzzle were in line for me to milk a free ticket to this museum as A) It was the first weekend of the month and B) we just happened to need to pass through Golden Gate Park to get to my sister's apartment. Fortuitous indeed.\n\nI love museum hopping and I was eager to check out the museum scene in SF so this was a treat for me. But I must say the lady working as a cashier was none too happy I was getting a $10 ticket for free (it's about time Bank of America did something for me besides being the single most cause of headaches and of me yelling profanities at their attempt at customer service.) The place was packed for the King Tut exhibit but unfortunately BOFA doesn't cover that...bummer.\n\nThe rest of the museum, however, was pretty interesting. It was like a mixed bag of different types of art and I never really knew what I was going to see from wing to wing. They pretty much have a little of everything from sculptures to Pop Art but the most interesting portion of the museum had to be the art from Africa and New Guinea. \nCheck out this picture:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RJ3NiTTSl00iT-Hu0-2ktQ?select=6WYRLQJF3tLSQDES_a43nw\n\nWhen I say interesting I mean it gave me the heebie jeebies. \n\nOverall I'd go to De Young to see some things you wouldn't ordinarily see in other museums.

I've been hearing Steve Martin's \"King Tut\" in my head for the last 3 days.  Thankfully, that song isn't as annoying as say \"It's a Small World.\"  Otherwise I would be trying to pull out my brain through my nostrils as they did in ancient Egypt.  Don't believe me?  Watch Tales from the Darskide- the segment with Steve Buscemi.\n\nAnyhow, being a lover of all things Egyptian and having an awesome friend who was a De Young member, I got to see this exhibit on Friday night.  Oddly enough, the last (and only) time I had been to the De Young was to see another Egyptian exhibit, for Hatshepsut.  This exhibit was cool, to be sure, but I wasn't blown away.   \n\nThe pros: \n*It's really interesting to see items that have survived for all these years- such as a chair that the Boy King may have sat on.\n*Like others have mentioned, they have descriptions not only in the display cases themselves, on the top border, on 3 sides.  So you can read what's in the case while you patiently wait for the old lady and her fanny pack who has to sound out the words to move.  \n*The audio tour is good, and although it's authentic, the thick accent sometimes makes it difficult to understand.  And I used to work with an Egyptian doctor and understood him perfectly.\n*Technology is beneficial\n\nThe not as good:\n*If you're expecting the gilded coffin, don't.  It's not there.  While the exhibit is about King Tut, a lot of the artifacts are from his extended family (grandparents and such), and not necessarily from his tomb.    \n*Like many things you pay a bunch of money to see, the exhibit dumps you in the gift shop.  Where you can buy things completely unrelated to King Tut, like a mummy rubber ducky (although a great gift for my favorite Killabunny).\n\nIf you're into Egyptian items and/or King Tut, go.

The security isn't as off the wall and over-serious as other places (I'm looking at you, MoMA), they'll tap your shoulder and give you a hint and back off. Or just give you a look like you know you shouldn't be doing that, and wait for you to stop before actually intervening. It's kind of fun, actually. \n\nThe fact that you now also have the fully restored and out of this world Academy of Sciences across the way is an incredible bonus. They did a stunning job making that part of golden gate park so cohesive. \n\nSo I say go, check it out, find yourself staring at one of a kind art work and out of this world exhibits. And hey, if that doesn't get you, the view from the observation deck is always pretty rad.", "author": "Samantha D."}

I love the unique, curvy, metallic design of the building and the upside-down pyramic architecture of the observation tower, which offers breathaking 360-degree views of the city. The sculptures, gardens, and ponds that surround the area are worth a trip alone (perhaps even worth forgoing the museum admission price)! \n\nThe museum itself boasts a broad collection of art: American paintings and sculptures, African Art, Oceanic Art, New Guinea Art, Textiles, Graphic Arts, and much more. The vast amount of space dedicated to these many galleries is so overwhelming, even dizzying, that I would be surprised if anybody walked through the entire museum (at a pace slow enough to actually appreciate the art) in a single day. In fact, I was so overwhelmed that I walked through 2-3 collections before becoming restless. \n\nThe exhibitions that were featured that weekend showcased the works of Yves Saint Laurent and Andy Warhol. The Yves Saint Laurent showcase was much smaller than expected (in fact, only 2 rooms), and took only about 45 minutes to fully enjoy (worth the $10? Not so sure...). There were some beautiful dresses and designs on display, all from different periods and in different styles & colors, but as a guy, I don't think I appreciated this exhibit as much as my girl friends. Also, I found it particularly ironic that most people in the exhibit were watching the YSL Fashion Show on a television screen in the room, even though they were surrounded by the ACTUAL YSL pieces that were shown on the screen. Why pay $10 extra to spend most of your time crowding around a TV instead of enjoying the pieces in person?! I was dumbfounded, but at least that meant more observation room for me!\n\nThe Andy Warhol exhibit was incredible, definitely the highlight of my visit. This multi-room exhibit featured the work of one of the biggest badasses of the modern art era. On display was a variety of Warhol's album covers, silkscreen paintings, photographs, films, sound recordings, and stunning illustrations of iconic pop music royalty: Elvis, The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Grace Jones, and more. What's awesome was that each room was set to a hypnotic soundtrack from the '60s-'80s: the pounding sounds definitely complimented the visuals effectively. The best part of the exhibit was definitely the psychadelic room complete with strobe lights, a plush circular lounge chair, trance-like music and Andy Warhol experimental videos plastered across all walls. I'm not gonna lie, it almost felt like I was on drugs!", "author": "Joseph F."}

The museum itself I woud give 5 stars.\n\nSort of a letdown (King Tut ).  Maybe it was the huge long lines that I had to wait in to get into the exhibit, or the hype about \"the find of the century\", or the fact that I had to shell out $28 bucks to get into this show.  In any event, I came out feeling a bit cheated. \n\nOnce one endured the wait (kind of like Disneyland, where you wait in a long line, finally get to the front and get in...to another long line) one gets ushered into a waiting room with 199 other people.  There's an intro video about Tut and the find and his relatives and then you are free to walk thru the 10 rooms of displays.  There's definitely some good stuff, everything is about 4000 years old and it is truly interesting.  But it's also truly crowded.\n\nI think the problem is that I had higher expectations.  For one thing all the advertizing has the famous gold mask on it.  There is a gold Tut coffinette that looks like the poster, but its only 14 inches high.  You go from room to room, thinking that in the last room at last you'll get that golden bonanza; in fact in the last room I spied the glow of lots of gold next door...but that turned out to be the retail store and the glow came from all the fake masks they were selling.\n\nApparently I'm not the only visitor that felt cheated.  I see on the museum's website that there's a blurb about the famous gold mask and how you can view it...in Cairo.  \n\nSo it's not like it's not worth seeing if you want to see a bunch of good Pharaoh stuff.  There is an impressive large gilded casket that contained an aunt of Tut.  And for $28, you can also visit the rest of the deYoung, which was great.  I especially recommend the New Guinea exhibit, just as fascinating as Tut, but about 100 times less crowded.", "author": "Emily A."}

Luckily it's fairly light on conceptual and video art, save for one video piece left over from the David Hockney show. \n\nThere seem to be some changes, though, that I'm not too excited about. They have all of their employees in these cerulean blue ski jackets, which makes no sense since they keep the place at 80 degrees year round. Am I buying tickets for a ski lift, or for an art museum? There was also an employee at the ticket desk screaming \"NEEEEEEEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!\" at everyone. That was a bit jarring and tacky.\n\n And when I was there last weekend, there were groups of children running, screaming, and flailing about, with seemingly no adult supervision and nobody controlling them. Art museums are nice, quiet, calm places to go see beautiful art.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-11-12", "description": "I love visiting the DeYoung - there are both things to do there for free and admission. I do currently have a student membership, which I recommend to all people still in school, because you can't beat the discount. \n\nI find it odd that some people I hate the design of the museum - I find it pleasing, and you don't notice it much from the street as the brush has grown to cover lots of it. See it from the westside as you come down the slope on JFK drive. It's beautiful. You also cannot beat the 360 view from the observation tower on a clear day. It is free to go up the tower, so if you're only walking through, don't have much time, already went to the Academy of sciences, or can't afford the museum that day, you can still go up the tower. Just check what time it closes, they close the tower before the museum. There is also a small section of the ground floor gallery that is free. I do agree that the free areas can be confusing at times. I think it changes depending on the exhibits. Like, typically the rooms on the north side of the building are usually free, but right now, most of it is part of the David Hockney exhibit and no longer free.\n\nI've seen quite a few exhibits that have left me floored - Chihuly, Picasso, Jean Paul Gaultier, and most recently, David Hockney. I'm not crazy about the indigenous pieces, but love the contemporary art downstairs and the fine art upstairs. My only gripe is that it's easy to get lost upstairs on the southside of the building. But the end of the building that overlooks the outdoor area has some nice benches that look outside. Nice spot for thinking, drawing, resting. \n\nJust as a warning, everyone gets their bags checked upon entrance. You also may not want to bring a backpack in, since they're pretty picky about people wearing their backpacks on their *gasp* backs. They don't want you knocking things over accidentally when turning. Wear it slung on your side or leave it in the car. I can't speak for the parking as I typically walk or bike here - but the underground parking seems pricey. Park on JFK or Fulton and walk there, even if it's a little walk. I know some tourists scoff at the idea of not being able to park at where you're going, but it's SF, doesn't work that way here. \n\nThe people at the membership services were really nice and let me apply the price of the two tickets I had paid to see the Picasso exhibit (at the time) towards my membership! So I really only paid $10 more! With the museum pass I get myself and a guest free tickets each time I go! It pays for itself after about 4 visits. AND your membership also gives you free entrance to the Legion of Honor. Plus members get invited to see some exhibits before they open to the public, I was able to see the Man Ray exhibit at the LoH with a very small group! No bumping shoulders to see anything.

While I don't approve with the modern additions as seen from the exterior, once inside the place is just deceivingly gorgeous!!! \n\nWe still had on our sticker \"passes\" from the Legion of Honor and were instantly admitted to the de Young...  then I got lost quick!!! If I thought the LoH was huge, then I was mistaken ~ the de Young was so \"BIG\" that I was reminded of aircraft hangars at the airports! Big, airy, high ceilings and lots of open free space! Saw the Andy Warhol exhibit unknowingly and simply because the layout of the entrance-way on the \"first floor\" pushed visitors to this special exhibit after passing through the entrance.\n\nTaking the ramped-stairs, one gets lost in a maze of long wide halls that lead to an opening exhibit and from there on, passing through doors/openings that lead to yet another. Keep your kids in firm hand because if not, it'll be days before you see them again! Lots of glass windows and reflective glass \"walls\" that further the idea of openness within the de Young!! In many cases, I found the mixture of glass enclosures of nature made a pleasant vision of what is and isn't...  in some cases, depending on how you stood facing these \"enclosures\", it could be very much as interesting as the displayed exhibits!!\n\nI particularly enjoyed the Observation Tower - take the elevator to the top floor for a 360-degree view of San Francisco from Golden Gate Park!! It was great!! A small gift shop is available there also, but I loved the scenery - can't beat the view. Seems for a small fee, one can go here on Fridays till 8pm!!", "author": "Tony L."}

I remember the de Young from when it was a coral-colored mediterranean-style structure.  I also remember being BORED TO TEARS at this museum.\n\nMe: MOM.  DAD.  LET'S GO TO THE STEINHART AQUARIUM, OK?  IT'S RIGHT THERE. *tap dances on the wooden floors to hear the echo*\n\nParents: No.  Just look at the paintings.  Aren't they cool?\n\nMe: *scowl* \n\nSilly young-Jennie!  Now I'm a member of FAMSF.  For $99, you get a year's worth of admission for yourself and a guest, including free entry to all special exhibits here and the Legion of Honor.  I have seen Van Gogh's Starry Night Over The Rhone (a red-letter day for me) at the Post-Impressionism exhibit, I have seen Jean Paul Gaultier, I have seen the Masters of Venice (what's up, Titian?).  I even stopped in to say hi to King Tut, although he was a little smaller than I expected.  It's organized, although I recommend going to popular exhibits early in the morning for maximum impact.  (But what do I care?  I can just come back again!)\n\nIf you're not a member, buying a ticket here will also admit you to the Legion of Honor on the same day.  \n\nThe special exhibits here (and the Legion) are top-notch.  The permanent collection also boasts a fantastic American Art selection. I remember seeing my first trompe l'oeil here as a child--and saw it again when I was taking American Art in undergrad.  You can find Bierstadt and I think at least one Church here.\n\nThe observation deck is also a gorgeous way to end a day at the museum.  \n\nMy only regret is that I didn't see the Chihuly exhibition when it came around.

Everybody was buzzing about it.\n\nAs a modern architectural feat, that proudly looks over Golden Gate park - the De Young is worth visiting, if just to marvel at it's heavy copper structure. Guarded by two white Sphinxes and palm trees that gracefully stretch into San Franicsco's sky - the De Young's thick copper base continues to  trigger oooohs and aaaahhhs, even from those that visit it regularly. And when the sun sets and rises, the De Young's copper angles and corners are shadowed and lit with superb poignancy.\n\n\nMore than just a building, the De Young is an impressive haven for a vast variety of multi-cultural art. It's exhibits are continually changing, evolving, and the museum does an applaudable job of representing varied time periods through all sorts of art. They are always looking to engage visitors, with different events and add innovative touches to the museum's exhibits, by enhancing them with interactive lectures, music, dance, and discussion. The De Young staff, never cease to search for new bridges that help make their art  more accessible and relative to all ages.\n\nEvery time that I have visited the De Young, I have been impressed with the way the museum opens up and invites you in. In every way.  It is evident that the staff are excited about the museum and enjoy watching new people absorb all of the art.They refrain from \"babysitting\" exhibits and showingrooms, and really allow people to explore each piece.The museum lacks pretension, and the bright lobby catches natural light with ease and never ceases to be nothing short of remarkably welcoming. \n\nThe views from the De Young are not overhyped. They are breathtaking and well worth the elevator ride up. Also, late at night on special events, be sure to take advantage of the museum's cafe and outdoor eating area. At night, when the heat lamps are going, you can sip on drinks and nibble on snacks, nestled between the surrounding vibrant palm trees......\n\nCast against the dark sky and moon glow, the copper walls of the De Young have never been more captivating.", "author": "Jessica T."}

The exhibits have enough variation (from the permanent collection to the special ones that have been here in the past few months), that I honestly get excited to visit the de Young. I love everything from the angled benches that they have in the lobby area, to the stairs leading you up to the second floor area. \n\nThe observation tower is super cool and I especially like the fact that you can go up to see the view for free on days that you may not want to check out the museum (or pay the museum fee). That view alone is priceless. \n\nLastly, the location is perfect. Near so many other things that once you are done with the museum, you can walk in the park afterwards or grab a bite to eat at any of the amazing local restaurants. I mean, I even like the MUNI ride there, so easy for an east bay gal to commute to....sigh...what more can I say??", "author": "Hilda Z."}

There was no King Tut death mask as shown on the advertising posters and no King Tut body either. The lines were long and of course in the usual de Young fashion they were deceiving too.  You wait in a long line upstairs only to find out you have another long line downstairs.  The exhibit was overcrowded with rude ushers pushing you through the exhibit.  When you finally get to the end you find out that you have been ripped off.  There is no King Tut sarcophagus or death mask, the collection was small, and the lines were too long even with a scheduled time on the ticket.\n\nWell, I am getting smarter now and I decided to read the Yelp reviews on the \"Post-Impressionist Masterpieces from the Musee D'Orsay\" exhibit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-20", "description": "This was my first time viewing a special art exhibit here at the de Young, although I had been inside once before.  The exterior design is bluntly modern, but I liked the finish and color of it.  Once you make your way through the entrance, you notice the large lobby area and somewhat unorthodox location of the ticketing desks. The rooms throughout the first level are not designed to be overly complicated or modern; the open art displayed here seems to bring life and character into every nook of the de Young.\n\nI was lucky enough to have caught the Van Gogh, Gauguin, C\u00e9zanne and Beyond: Post-Impressionist Masterpieces from the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay last month here with a friend who suggested it.  This is a very rare occasion where these priceless pieces were brought from the permanent collection @ Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris, France.  I believe that a section of that museum was going to be renovated which is why they were temporarily moved and exhibited here.  The lines for this exhibit piled up every half hour with mostly middle-aged couples and retirees, not too many patrons under 40 in this one.  You wait on the level above the actual exhibit and then again on the lower-level, and you begin to notice how the members wait for a lesser time.\n\nAfter getting in, I realized it was pretty damn jam-packed even with the 30-minute levy they instated.  But you immediately see some pretty interesting Impressionist paintings, and soon enough you see Van Gough's work.   Additionally Signac, Gauguin, Renoir, and Cezanne all in the same area... which happens to be so crowded you have trouble navigating.  I was affected by seeing the few works of Van Gough for the first time, especially Starry Night over the Rhone.  There was also Bedroom at Arles which was nice and a Portrait of the Artist.  My favorite artist in this section happened to be C\u00e9zanne which used bright color and used still life technique in many of the oil on canvas.  \n\nThe sequence of the art is carefully thought out; as you can tell they presented some mildly interesting art in the beginning then climbed to Van Gogh and Cezanne shortly after the beginning then smoothly slowed to more drab and less colorful pieces in the very middle.  And at the end, they had a few mildly evocative pieces depicting war or sex to close the exhibit.  Altogether it was pretty impressive, I was glad to see these priceless paintings and more of the museum itself.", "author": "Kenny P."}

The collection is crap and the special exhibits are anything but, with the exception of the Musee d'Orsey collection which passed through in two stages.  That was phenomenal.  But, everything before or since has been very poorly curated.  The current show, Girl With A Pearl Earring, is a joke.  Sure the featured painting is a classic, but the rest of the collection makes very little attempt to connect the viewer with the other pieces on exhibition.  It is just a joke.\n\nThe whole museum experience is very commercial, unlike the fine museums of the world where you feel immersed in art, here one feels like they're walking through a showroom, no photography allowed!\n\nRegarding the permanent collection, we're talking about some seriously poor taste.  It's a real challenge to find an interesting/impressive piece of art among the museum's vast permanent collection.  Considering the amount of money that went into this museum, the results are simply pathetic.  I'm embarrassed to take visitors from out of town to this 'museum.'

If you hold a BoA card, the general admission is waived and you would only have to pay $10 for both of the exhibits that were going on, which were YSL and Warhol, which I thought was well worth the price.\n\nThe YSL exhibit was great, featuring works worn by many royal and famous figures, as well as outrageously fun costumes. Some might wonder who would ever wear some of the attire, but it is in an art museum afterall, so you would probably not think of it as wearable, but as an art piece. Though, there were a few pieces that I can see be worn today and be fashionably in, but the outfit was constructed in the 1980s. One of my favorite line was the one dedicated to artists--there were some amazing beading work there. There's also a screen that played footage from live runway shows, and someone who was watching said \"its interesting to see the outfits in motion,\" which i couldnt agree more.\n\nThe Warhol exhibit was AMAZING. It was much bigger than YSL's featuring at least 7 galleries or so. The galleries highlighted different moments and interests in his life--art and music. There were some Polaroids of people like Aretha Franklin and Liza Minelli that Warhol worked with for his screen printed arts. Dont miss out on the polaroid of him in drag as well--I would've missed it if I didnt chose to take a second pass at the last 3 galleries. The ambiance was awesome too--featuring music in certain sections (studio 54) and plenty of amazing art and quotes from him. There's a room of photos of famous celebraties, which triggered a lot of memories and \"wow, did they really look like that??\" Oh, and who doesnt love the banana?\n\nQuickly strolled through the American art gallery. I've already been through this one, and loved the realism of one of the sections (the one with the bird). Also noticed there were a few new additions. The tower's as great as ever and we also revisited the Turrell piece, though I wish we went in there when the sun was higher.\n\nI would definitely recommend going for the Warhol exhibit and if you can appreciate fashion, then hit up the YSL exhibit as well.

Whoever organized this show--EPIC FAIL in terms of design.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Unlike the Met or the MOMA where you can walk right in and see an exhibit, at the De Young you have to buy tickets ahead of time. Then you are assigned a time to show up that day.\n\n2. Once you show up at your predetermined time, you have to wait an additional 40 minutes in line to get into the actual exhibit, after shuffling through multiple checkpoints in line with...screaming children, groups of tourists, etc who are being herded like cattle through a series of roped-off walkways as if you're getting on Space Mountain at Disney World.\n\n3.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-09-25", "description": "I finally made it inside the de Young Museum, after touring the grounds several times.  What a great experience.\r\n\r\nFrom the website, I find it very hard to get a sense of what this museum is about.  Since its creation, there has been a lot of press about the Herzog & deMeuron design, which is dramatic and impressive.  For me, it works wonderfully, and I see something new every time I look at it.  One day I know that we will barely remember the time when it was not there, and our eyes will adjust to its shape as something familiar in the landscape of the park, not a recently settled stranger.\r\n\r\nThe inside is very clean and linear, however the lines intersect and twist and weave, growing narrow and then wide again in a very interesting way.  There are gardens inserted into outdoor corridors, an unbelievable cantilevered overhang, and of course the twisted Tower.  Many windows offer many different views.  It is a place to stop, look, consider, move on.  \r\n\r\nWe started by taking the elevator to the top of the Tower to the 9th Floor Observation deck. Definitely recommend this experience, both for the stunning views of the city and the bay, and to integrate yourself with the structure of the museum.  Once you look at the world from the eye of the Tower, you will never look at the Tower again without remembering that experience.  Take a moment to look at the Ruth Asawa sculptures that are on the ground floor by the elevator banks - they are amazing.\r\n\r\nWe had limited time, so we went to the \"Quilts of Gee's Bend\" exhibit.  It was eye-opening - so incredible to think that women in this rural town in Alabama spent generations making quilts that are so original and sophisticated that when you squint your eyes, you could be looking at modern art.  I loved being able to get up close to the quilts to look at the details, and then stepping away to get a sense of the overall look.  The layout and displays flowed well and ended with a video about the quilt makers.  \r\n\r\nWhile we were there, there were several performances going on - one on the main floor of the museum, and one out by the culture garden.  It struck me that this was different than so many museums that I've been to in that it allowed people to have several different experiences within one visit.\r\n\r\nWe spent some time in the sculpture garden, taking time to visit the James Turrell \"skyspace\" interactive sculpture, called \"3 Gems\".  Another truly unique experience that I definitely recommend.\r\n\r\nI am still not sure I could describe to someone what the de Young is all about, as it is about many things.  All I can say is that it is a museum where you can go, look, touch, view and experience art and culture, in a completely unique way.  You may spend your time listening to a gospel choir.  You may go up the the Observation Deck and be reminded of the beauty of the landscape.  You may see something primitive, modern or both.  Go with an open mind, ready to look and listen, and you are sure to find something of interest and inspiration.", "author": "Liz S."}

I have to give it three stars for the presentation and metering the visitors through the exhibit and the quality of the total presentation was first class. \n\nThe funny part is I have seen a lot of the artifacts in the Cairo Antiquities Museum and they have much much more ancient Egyptian artifacts, but when I was there displayed in old store glass displays and not labeled very well. \n\nThe audio tour was pretty good with Omar Sharif narrating some of the facts that were also included on the placards which I might add were very well marked at eye level and above so those who could not get close could understand what they were looking at. I found some of the hype surrounding Tut mysterious early death a bit too much as it was documented the did have a broken leg bone when a CT scan was done of the mummy. Oh, Tut is not allowed to leave Egypt so all you see are the beautiful implements and one of the many sarcophagus's that entombed the boy king. \n\nI felt like I was at Disneyland as they dump you right into a gift shop at the end of the Tut exhibit. \n\nWith the swine flu but going around I wondered if they even thought of cleaning the audio wands after people had held them to their face and ears and put their fingers all over it. \n\nAfterward we did view the Amish Quit and a few of the other exhibits. I wanted to go up in the tower, but was overruled by the nice group that invited me and supplied me a free ticket. \n\nParking is nicely done and is right under the Museum and priced accordingly. \n\nThe overall layout of the Museum is very angular so navigating around is a bit of a challenge for the first time.

The de Young is a beautiful museum on the outside, as well as the inside.  I've read quite a few reviews on Yelp about this place and I must admit I am surprised by the negativity.  A lot of people said it is an \"eye sore\" and they \"don't get why it's so ugly\" and it's \"seems really stupid.\"  That is pretty ignorant, way to live up to the \"dumb American\" stereotype!  Why not read WHY they decided to build it this way? :)\n\nEvery inch of this museum was especially crafted to mean something.  The rich copper will oxide over time, turning into a beautiful green and blending more into the landscape.  The inside is expertly laid out for easy navigation -- rooms are open, the light is directed towards certain objects and pieces.  Just take a step back and learn to breathe.  Ask yourself WHY someone chose this particular angle, reflection, color, or window?  Here is some more useful information: http://www.arcspace.com/architects/herzog_meuron/de_young.html \n\nThe de Young is lucky enough to be the only museum IN THE WORLD to be showing the \"Birth of Impressionism\" exhibit from the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in France.  We are very lucky that France/USA have a special relationship which includes their national art treasures being transported here.  That being said, part one which includes: Degas, Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Pissarro, Manet will be ending September 6th.  Then make way for part DEUX which includes: Van Gogh, Cezzane, Gauguin, etc. :)  \n\nThe exhibit does cost extra as they have to make their money somehow.  The rooms will be crowded so please, be patient.  The same thing would happen at any museum -- like crowds gathered around Mona Lisa at the Louvre.  This is not a child-friendly exhibit, don't bother bringing your bulky strollers and toddlers.  I'm a bit confused why any parent would bring their kids to a museum that has only art, when the Academy of Science is much more kid-friendly and right across the street.  This is suppose to be a place of quiet to reflect, admire and study great works of art.\n\nI made it through the exhibit in an hour, some have taken longer.  I didn't have an audio guide but I should have liked a docent tour.  I think for the second part I will try to have that arranged.  Remember, once you leave that's it!  Lots of people want to get in and see the paintings.\n\nLastly, purchase tickets in advance.  Tickets sold out!  I saved money with my student ID which was nice.  \n\nAll in all, what a wonderful experience!

I woke up my peacefully sleeping toddler. She was not especially happy as she had planned to sleep through it. Lots of wheelchairs were clicking and whirring everywhere (the gallery is very proud that it is accessible to wheelchair users), but God forbid I could push my two-year-old daughter around in a stroller. I was then told (quite rudely) by one of the staff that I could not carry my daughter on my shoulders either. Lots of retired people were staggering around on sticks and walkers, but God forbid I could carry my daughter on my shoulders. This is the antithesis of \"family-friendly\", in my opinion.\n\nIf you are an art lover in the Bay Area, well first of all I feel very sorry for you. The local galleries are poor, pretentious and expensive, so no luck there. If you can afford it, save up your cash and go to Europe or the East Coast and see a grown-up exhibition in a real gallery. You won't regret it.

I was a bit wary that the de Young would be like other fancy spancy art museums, huge exhibits, tons of pieces, but short of any substantial history within arms reach. Surprisingly the Van Gogh, Guaguin, Cezanne and beyond had panels on display that not only provided background on the iconoclasts of the time, but they brushed on some technique. This really helped shorten the gap between the viewer and the artist. Art alone can be pretty esoteric. \n\nPostcards and pictures don't do the paintings here any justice. One of my favorites was Renoir's \"dance in the country\". I loved his vibrant use of primary colors and his ability to make some of his paintings appear to illuminate from beneath the canvas; something lost in the prints of postcards. I also discovered his \"Luncheon of the boating party\"(not present at this exhibit) was referenced in one of my favorite french films. Renoir you are my new love. \n\nOne other painting also left a strong mark on me. Van Gogh's self portrait, Autumn 1887. Characterized by thick brush strokes, harsh lines, and an austere visage, it drew an uneasiness from me, almost bone chilling. That painting epitomized his fractured being at the time so well, it made me wonder if some of his paintings were a cry for help, help that might have prevented his demise. Seeing his stuff was an eye opener, though his famous \"starry night\" wasn't exactly life changing. \n\nAll in all, the exhibit is worth seeing if I haven't expressed that enough. A few rules: You can't re-enter once you leave so make sure you use the bathroom beforehand and it can get crowded, REALLY crowded. Try not wear backpacks, the security guards will be on your ass about it, old man/woman or not. And photography is not allowed. *sad face*", "author": "Alesia T."}

After having the recent pleasure of viewing Van Gogh's second version of \"Starry Night\" at the Museum of Modern Art , New York, I was looking forward to experiencing his first representation, without taking a trip to Paris. \n\nYou have to love this kind of exhibit. People from different walks of life, young and old, from different cultures, all coming together to enjoy works of genius. \n\nThe exhibit appropriately starts out with a display of late-Impressionist paintings, including paintings by Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir. Not a bad way to start, and I really enjoyed the warmth ironically emanating from Monet's \"Frost\" (1880). \n\nMoving away from the these late impressionists, the next room offers works from neo-impressionists masters like Seurat and Georges Lemmen. Try viewing Georges Lemmen's \"Beach At Heist\" (1891) from the right side, about ten feet away, at a thirty to forty five degree angle. Pretty cool in my book. The color from Maximillien Luce's \"The Siene at Herblay\" (1850) also leaves a lasting impression, pardon the pun. \n\nI highly recommend spending some time in front of Seurat's series on the far wall. Great technique and detail. You have to see this stuff close up to appreciate his work. I have to confess, however, that while viewing Seurat, a certain Van Gogh painting in the room to the right held part of my attention. \n\nAfter a quick once over of a few of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings in the main room, I quickly moved over to Van Gogh. The man was obsessed with painting his \"Starry Night\". What a painting. You can almost feel this guy layering on thick powerful short strokes with passion. You feel the coldness from the blue colors of the night. and movement of the wind. But there is also the warmth from the city lights and stars piercing through this painting, lighting the way for the couple on the banks of the Rhone. This is a much more peaceful \"Starry Night\" than the version he painted a few months later while he was in a mental institution. I guess not so unexpected. What a privilege to see these two masterpieces within two months.", "author": "Gregory C."}

It has been the best present ever.  Normally Baroque is my style, but who can say no to their very persuasively beautiful Latin American exhibit.\n\nBut what are really spectacular are the show.  The post impressionist show is one of the most impressive collections of art I have seen.  Very, very crowded.  But then again I believe that children and art are like children and booze, a recipe for disaster. The Balenciaga show made me want to try on every one of those dresses and play Belle.  I believe that his winter 1951 was a season completely dedicated to me.  And then there were the huge Olmac heads.  Damn, those indigenous people could make some really big heads.  Very impressive.\n\nMy favorite pieces are not in fact in the museum but outside in the sculpture garden.  And both are kind of tucked away, my secret art.  The first is an amazing metal piece that is huge and shiny and has hole through the middle.  It looks all crinkly and fun to touch.  Every time I see it i just want to climb all over it.  The second is all the way at the back of the garden down a secret path to a small round building.  When you walk all the way around and into it you find a white room with a round hole in the cieling and a mirroring piece of blue marble beneath it.  I love it.  It is quiet and peaceful and nice.

That was fine.  Looked up and saw this huge desk that I assumed was the admissions desk.  Walked over and saw that every window was labeled \"Member.\"  Another, equally confused, customer, asked someone, \"where do you buy tickets if you're not a member?\"  He was directed to another desk on the other side of the lobby -- that is not visible from the front door.  A little signage letting people know where to go would be nice. \n\n-- The women selling the tickets did not smile, say hello, or do anything to indicate they were not completely miserable.  Not really the most inviting introduction to the museum. \n\n-- Rather than have one entry point where you show your ticket and then are done, there are several \"ticket check points\" throughout the museum.  I just found this added to my overall sense of not being quite welcome.  I felt like I was under suspicion and had to keep validating my right to be there. \n\n-- Everybody is given a little sticker to wear to show their \"level\" of visitorship. \"Member.\" \"Special Exhibits.\" \"General Admission Only. No Special Exhibits. WITH a MUNI Discount.\"  This is primarily for the benefit of the guards at the aforementioned \"ticket check points,\" but also served to literally place a label on every museum guest. \n\nThe art itself was fine, but did not blow me away.  Maybe I was just not feeling the art thing that day, but, after a cursory walk through, I was ready to head out.  (I should add, in contrast to the doleful front desk people, the floor guards were all very friendly and helpful.)  I'd go back if there were a special exhibit I was interested to see, but would not go back just to see the permanent collection again. \n\nOverall, I would say I had a three star experience, but I am adding a star because the views from the Observation Tower totally kick ass!", "author": "Elena M."}

Birth of Impressionism is only there 'til September!\n\nMagnificent works of art that I'd never seen in person...no waiting in line...classy place set in a beautiful park...drool!\n\nBecause the Impressionism exhibit is special, it had a higher charge than general admission. I bought our tickets online at $21 apiece. Didn't buy the audio tour. I'm not a member because my attendance at museums is relatively rare. Considering the fantastic once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see these historic pieces only an hour from home, the price was a bargain. The admission got us into both the deYoung and Legion of Honor because we visited both on the same day.\n\nReally hard to believe it was possible to get so close to such awesomeness. My sweetheart isn't a fanatic like me, but even he thought it was incredible to stand right in front of Whistler's Mother. \n\nThere were lots of paintings I'd never seen before, that have inspired me to learn more. Then there were others that were \"OMG -- I know that one! And it's HERE!\"\n\nSomething that really confused us was the profusion of patrons  standing or sitting around who seemed totally disinterested. Just yakking and being bored or unimpressed. \n\nHuh? If the majesty is lost on someone, fine, it's not their thing, but what are they doing there? I found it disrespectful. Do they just go because they're spending the day in the Park? There are other touristy spots in the Park for people not interested in old art. \n\nSeeing the works was very humbling for me as an artist. So many times, I've left paintings unfinished for so many reasons. I let things stop me. I let life stop me. The old masters did not let things stop them. Despite war, disease, famine, poverty, heartbreak, whatever, they produced gifts that are enjoyed all these generations later. \n\nSo go, and enjoy!", "author": "Sue Ellen E."}

Anti-modernists would disagree, but it's great to see bold statements injected into S.F., as these are sadly lacking.\n\nThe art curation is rather mixed -- very good exhibitions alternate with craft presented as art: 'craft' as defined by works that are aesthetically pleasing, design, works that are already accepted as art a century ago but created today; 'art' as defined by surprising/unexpected works that take up contemporary issues, works that push the boundaries of art, thus often copied and adopted by others (i.e. avant-garde) and sometimes take a generation (or two) before being accepted by the public. \n\nIn doing so, the de Young is giving up its position as a world class museum.

Whether it is out in the sculpture garden or in the center lobby in front of Gerhardt Richter's Strontium. It's vast and 3-D looking. It will give you a headache but it will also blanket you in its warmth. It's the perfect mural to stand up to height of the De Young.\n\nWhile the building is big, the permanent collection here is small. Sad to say, I felt like it's the left over art that gets housed at the De Young. I will say that I was excited to see a Joan Miro- my second sighting (the first was in Spain so this is quite nice as I didn't have to fly across the Atlantic). It's the sculptures, the building, the special exhibits, and the views that are worth it here.\n\nEvery thing, every nook and cranny is a spectacle. As I walked through the building and wandered through the art, I was really excited to discover views over the sculpture garden and make my way towards the tower. There are skylights everywhere to let in natural light and the walls are made of glass to let you be one with the greenness of Golden Gate Park.\n\nThe observation tower is so much fun. It has beautiful sights and on this sunny day I saw views of the golf course near the Legion of Honor, the top of the Golden Gate Bridge, CPMC Parnassus, the park, a protest/parade using a giant Ghandi, my car parked on the street, etc. It's endless and it's awesome.\n\nIt was lunchtime and we decided to grab a bite to eat at the museum cafe. I would never have suggested eating at a museum cafe. I'm more of the okay let's go hit up one of SF's cool neighborhoods for a bite. But in this case it made sense. We wouldn't have to move the car or pay for parking and we could enjoy eating al fresco in the sculpture garden. Again this space is amazing and I will say the inside eating area has awesome light fixtures and the museum does try to provide somewhat of a fancy meal for you. Even if most of the items are bussed in by a caterer, they do provide some excellent choices. Yes you will pay $10 for a sandwich and salad (not together but for each) but it is worth it.

I've heard about the artist before back in high school and thought nothing of it until I saw pictures of his work from one of my teachers and just had to come visit to see for myself!  The exhibit is over after September 28th so I highly recommend the trip to see it!\n\nThe museum itself is a lot bigger than I anticipated.  We finished the bottom floor and suddenly discovered the staircase to other floors and the permanent collection was just immense.  I adored the colonial time period work, it was fun seeing how much time changes things.\n\nOverall I think it's a fun place to go if your usual agenda to go out for the day consists of going to the park, seeing a movie, or eating out with some friends.  Enlighten yourselves in a more cultured activity if that's appropriate to word it that way.  \n\nAdmission isn't that bad, it's generally $10 for adult admission and $6 for students (college and under with ID).  Not sure about other prices, but the exhibit itself cost us another $5 each, worth it.  You can take pictures as long as they're not flash. \n\nIf you can take less items with you as possible do so.  One of the guards there is anal about keeping purses in front of you and he'll likely remind you 1000 times over if you didn't hear him the first time,", "author": "Anne N."}

It's a monstrosity, and does not fit in at all. It's large, and feels really nihilistic with it's large window-less brown walls, and the dark sort of gold tunnel you need to go through to get to the main door. It's confusing and is not built to accommodate large groups of people.\n\nThis is especially prevalent in the special exhibits like the recent King Tut exhibit and the Birth of Impressionism exhibit. The basement level is used for these special exhibits, and the rooms there are small, and have no natural lighting. Also, the way these rooms are built is not ideal for moving large groups of people. The way it is now makes for there to be bottlenecks at every doorway between rooms, and there is nothing to keep people from going up within five inches of the paintings. Furthermore, those selling the tickets believe that these rooms were built for about three times as many people as can actually fit. It is always too crowded to see anything in the exhibits at all.\n\nSkip this museum, and head over to the Legion of Honor instead. It's a much more pleasant experience!\n\n(also, the top floor of the large tower has a map of San Francisco that cuts off the bottom 1/5th of the city where I happen to live.

Came here with my mom for the Balenciaga exhibit. They were also showing a Picasso exhibit, but you had to pay additionally to see that, and it only showed at 2 times per day. \n\nSo, we got there, parked in the very convenient parking garage (they didn't have that before the reconstruction) and walked right into the museum. It was a little confusing as far as where to go for what exhibit as there didn't appear to be much signage. However, the staff helped out at every turn and directed us to the right place. Kind a strange guy at the info desk who, after we asked him a question, tried to engage us in more conversation...like he didn't want to dispense info about the museum, just wanted someone to talk to. My mom's 'gift of gab' also wasn't helping. \n\nShe wanted to become a museum member so she could go to more exhibits at a discount price. Worth it if you live in or near SF and want to go to more than 4 per year. She got me in with her new membership for free. Cool! \n\nThe musuem itself has been redone in such a modern feel. The exhibit spaces still exude the feeling of whatever it is being shown, however. One hall displayed treasures from 18th century America and you could really see all those items in the aristocratic homes of the era. \n\nAlso, I don't care what anyone says. The Balenciaga showing was amazing. He is one of the very first designers to recognize the marriage of art and textile/clothing design. What woman wouldn't feel like royalty wearing some of those designs?! amazing for what they are and when they were made. \n\nAll I can say is that if you live near the de Young, you should go. It is a treasure and you're lucky to have so many worldly exhibits come through the building. Those who don't live near big cities do not have the luxury of seeing so many unique pieces of history at our fingertips.", "author": "ciara c."}

REALLY looking forward to seeing King Tut's exhibit, regardless of the hefty admission fee.\n\nThe only downfall of these museum (and of the Tea Garden/surround Museum area really) is the lack of parking. It gets really old driving up and down the small roadways hunting for spot to wedge your car into. Unless you make it there before 11am, good luck. On a weekend, shoot for a time before 10am. And yet, even after hunting for parking, the museum is worth the wait. If you really can't deal, park in downtown and take the Culture Bus that stops near the MoMa.\n\nBack to the perks: I've eaten at the museum caf\u00e9 on several occasions and had some great meals. I can't speak for the ready-made sandwiches, but made to order sandwiches are very good. At my last visit, I shared the Warhol Sloppy POP-py sandwich, which was really tasty and big enough to serve 2.

We made it to the museum for the last operating hour of day for the Jean Paul Gaultier exhibit, which is fabulous by the way! The hour came and went, and the museum started closing down; and, the staff turned into prison patrol masters (officers title is undeserving in their case) that were rude and pushy to get everyone out. They were inflexible and eager to rush us all out of the museum like some heard of animals. Quite a few families, patrons and other attendees, obviously making this exhibit visit part of their Mother's Day treat, were swept out of the museum like some garbage (kid you not, guards were blocking people out from any path unless it was to the exit with their own bodies and outstretched arms, not to mention raised voices).\nI fully understand that museum is closing down. Everyone was making their way out of the exhibit and out of the museum, but no one was running out of there like it was on fire. In fact, would you see any of those people working at de Young making a rush of consideration to exit out of wherever (grocery store, shopping mall, event, a museum?!) had they been somewhere right at the closing hours - I don't believe they would. \nI don't understand how museum allows for such inconsiderate, detached, rude, pushy and careless behavior and attitude in their employees, when a good portion of the museum experience comes from their employees.\n\nDe Young is a museum without customer service! ...until I've experienced otherwise.", "author": "Busy P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-07", "description": "Tut review:  HEY, YOU!  ... OVER HERE!!  ... IMPORTANT REVIEW OF TUT SHOW AHEAD!!!\n\nOK, now that I have your attention, take everything negative you have heard about the current Tut exhibit at the De Young and toss it in the trash can.  It simply ain't so!\n\nHere's the deal; ... After reading and hearing dozens of complaints about the show, we bit the bullet, paid our 30 bucks per ticket, and went to the show Saturday morning (2/6/10).  The two major complaints I'd heard were that the show was nowhere near as complete as the last Tut show, back in the late '70s, and that the ads for this show were misleading, since they showed a photo of one of the casket faces, which weren't even in this current show.\n\nFirst of all, while there aren't nearly as many Tut-specific items in this show as in the previous one, there are far more Tut-related pieces.  By that I mean that there are many artifacts dealing with earlier and later Pharoahs and their families, but all related in one way or another with Tut. For me, this makes this show as interesting, if not more so, than the previous show. \n\nFor example, there are a few major pieces relating to Tut's possible father, Akhenaten, and his wife Nefertiti. (He's the Pharoah who messed with their religion, changing from many gods to one Sun god).  The sculptures of Akhenaten and Nefertiti alone are worth the price of admission, IMHO. He is as strange-looking as she is drop-dead gorgeous, even in contemporary terms. But enough sexism.\n\nThe other complaint, about the face mask, turns out to be a case of mistaken identity. The piece in the posters IS in the show, ... it's actually a photo of the face on the canopic container for one of Tut's organs ... in this case, the liver. The fact that this container is only about 12\" tall makes the detail on the face, body and interior of the case even more amazing. \n\nSome more positive aspects of this show:\n\nThe display cases are all at eye-level, and most are viewable from all four sides. All the cases can be be seen close-up, with no velvet ropes keeping you too far away for a good look at the details.\n\nThough there are timed group entries into the show, no one at the showing we were at was pushing people along.  We stayed as long as we wanted, where we wanted. We were able to move back and forth from room to room, with no enforced time limit. \n\nThe show is very well-lit, with each display shown to best advantage. We rented the audio modules for a few extra bucks, but unless you want only the very basic info on each piece, or you're in love with Omar Sharif's voice, don't bother. All the info you need is on the display cards at each exhibit. Even better, the usual \"one information card per exhibit\" rule was tossed, and there are three or four of them per piece, so the crowd isn't forced to one side to see the info.  \n\nOn that same note, all the displays are arranged in a way that helps prevent grid-lock and the usual blocked views.  We were able to get good, close-up looks at all the exhibits, with only a few seconds wait at the more popular pieces.\n\nI don't want to waste your time mentioning all the \"Wow!\" pieces, but one in particular caused me to utter a kinda-too-loud \"Damn!\"  It was  the so-called \"practice piece\" of the Pharoah's left profile in bas relief on limestone. (I say so-called because my professional art background makes me think that the piece is actually an \"approval sketch\" of sorts, made to show, and get approval for, a master-sketch to be used for all subsequent pieces).   \n\nThe \"Wow!\" factor comes from the probability that this piece was essentially a quickly done maquette, or scale model. The importance is that these tend to be done solely by the master sculptor, rather than by a member of the sculptor's staff.  Plus (if my supposition is correct), such a piece would almost certainly have to be personally handled and approved by the subject himself, and possibly even initialed as a final approval of the \"look\". \n\nThe one downer is the ban on all photography. I can understand a ban on using flash, but banning all photos, especially in this day of mini-cameras, seems to be more about guaranteeing good sales in the gift store than anything else. But just between us, I was still able to almost secretly get a few good shots with my point & shoot digital ... \"almost\" because I was caught by an over-eager guard, who insisted that I show him what I had shot, and that I delete them. Fat chance of THAT happening.  Between my mumbling some nonsense to him, and the fact that I was about two feet taller than him, I got away with all the shots.  Shame the hell on me. \n\nAnyway, I obviously loved the show, and I'm glad that I ignored the negative reviews.  I'll probably go back again.", "author": "Chuck L."}

I have been to many of San Francisco's museums and this has been one of my favorites.  Upon entering you are greeted by a large and impressive collection of Tree Ferns surrounded by moss and rock streams These are contained within a multi-level glass enclosed viewing which is open to the sky above.  You walk past these transitioning to/from the upper and lower levels. The bay winds easy whip the ferns to and from - inspiring. \n\nAs for collections, I'm a fan of the American Decorative Arts which has renowned pottery samples of Schmidt from Rookwood and Sicard from Weller and a few splendid pieces by Louis Comfort Tiffany.   It's one thing to see them on TV, quite a another to see them up close.\n\nThe special exhibition:  Real to Real: Photographs from the Traina Collection was a nice surprise as I have a photographic background and I've not seen these works prior. \n\nThe wire and shadow sculptures which are located on the way to the observation  tower are by Ruth Asawa.  These are quite impressive when you consider the intricate nature of the pieces coupled to the shadows projected onto the wall. \n\nThe special surprise at de Young is the observation tower which allows one a 360 degree view of the surrounding areas as well a a nice look down onto the copper facade museum below.  From here, it's awesome to see the Tree Ferns location, the rocks at the irregular pentagon entrance and even the details worked into the buildings roof... and how all these fit the building and surrounding grounds into an special exhibit of their own - nice touch! \n\nI recommend taking the MUNI as one gets $2 off of admission while also getting a nice stroll through Golden Gate Park.

I had never been to the de Young prior to that  visit; so upon entry I was instantly mesmerized by the architecture and the open layout of the museum. I enjoyed the Pacific Islander exhibit of historical artifacts, as well as the New American exhibit of portraits and furniture, but what I most enjoyed was an exhibit titled, \"In the Name of God: War, Religion, and the Reliquaries of Al Farrow.\" The artist constructs scale models of religious icons from Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faiths made strictly from ammunition, gun parts, and in some cases, human bone. The exhibit was shocking, but in my opinion, effective. Kudos to the de Young! \n\nBecause that particular visit to the museum was specially arranged for our group, we were able to be present during the installation of the Yves Saint Laurent exhibit.

There was indeed a sarcophagus there, but it was not our man Tut.  NO Tut sarcophagus?  That's just ri-donk-u-lous.  (Apparently, the Tut sarcophagus is no longer allowed to leave Egypt.)\n\nNot to say the exhibit wasn't impressive.  It was really quite amazing to see the artifacts they had there, all preserved so delicately, perfectly maintained and in most cases glistening in the professional installation lighting.  \n\nBut the advertising is pretty misleading.  You won't see a big ol' Tut.  Instead you'll see a little \"Honey, I Shrunk the Boy King Tut\" mini sarcophagus there.  Not nearly as impressive as what is expected after paying such a hefty price for tickets.\n\nThe cost of a ticket for members was lowered to $22.50, which seemed high for an exhibit (IMHO).  I cringed when I told my class about it because I knew my students and their families could not afford it.  (Non-members: child ticket is $16.50, adults are $32.50)\n\nTo advertise an awesome exhibit like Tut and make the price so unreachable to so many students in San Francisco seems a tad thoughtless.  I know for a fact that the majority of kids in my entire school did not get to go, which makes me frown.\n\nAnother thing that makes me frown...the impossibly large crowds of hot, sweaty people.  Being nearly 9 months pregnant at the time of our tour, I was shoved, cut in front of, denied a seat on the many benches, and basically given no slack at all as my ankles began to swell and my head became light.  By the time we left the cramped quarters of the exhibit, I was nearly passing out from the sheer effort of getting through the hoards.

The entrance to the exhibit evoked a Disney ride, but once we were in the gallery we were able to examine every piece at our leisure. \n\nLook, they're not going to bring the Pyramids of Giza and put them in the basement. It's best to appreciate what they decided to bring over this time. \n\nLike life-size statues of the kings and queens of this New Kingdom dynasty. The amazing story of Akhenaten, who brought monotheism to Egypt.  The dramatic way in which Tutankhaten restored the old religion, the old temples and the old priests, renaming himself Tutankhamun, only to die suddenly and mysteriously (nobody at the exhibit mentioned the controversial reports of neck wounds), without heirs, at 19. \n\nLike the incredible detail in the jewelry, the ushabti, the furniture, and the other funerary artifacts. Yes, these are the grave goods from a royal tomb 3,331 years old. In perfect condition. That alone should be cause for amazement. \n\nMaybe the interior coffins weren't there, much to some other viewers' chagrin.

The oldest known metal hinges on a jewelry box, look like they could have been machine tooled today. \n\nIt's enough to make you realize that the ancient civilizations were peopled by men and women who were every bit as artistic, every bit as skilled, every bit as ingenious, as you and I today.

Trying to laugh it off, I gently snatched the chocolate back. The guard merely blinked back at me. After a 10 second pause, he mumbled a stone-faced \"just kidding\" and then proceeded to tell us to move out of line. WTF?\n\nI attended the Yves Saint Laurent exhibit, which was poorly organized and contained a rather sparse collection of models. As I was walking in (and the exalted inventor of the smoking suit rolling in his grave), I saw a sign that read \"No photographs except for special exhibitions.\" Great! I pulled out my camera and zeroed in on a fantastical YSL creation. \n\nWithin seconds, another dipsh!t security guard appeared to tell us that \"Cameras are only allowed with no flash.\" Fine!

I guess that's my fault for being dumb and not reading right, but it's so misleading, just as everyone else says. King Tut isn't there. Here's how it goes:\n\nYou start off by watching a 90-second introductory video on King Tut then once permitted, go through different rooms that all have very beautiful and interesting artifacts and ancientttt items. It's nice! Very nice. Dimly lit, some rooms have videos that talk about ancient life and times of King Tut. Everything is about King Tut basically! It's extremely crowded though. You'd think after all the waiting, it wouldn't be so packed. It'll take you a while to go to see every artifact and exhibit because of how many people there are in that cave. I was thrilled, however, to see the tomb of King Tut's grandmother or whoever she was. It was big, shiny, and really thrilling. I could NOT wait until King Tut, yeah?! So I was going to the last room and what the hell did I see? A cheap ass photo of King Tut on a plastic piece of shit. WOW GG King Tut exhibit. I mean...if you're going to have a picture and let me down, can't it at least be in COLOR?! Or a fucking hologram. Paying 27.00 for a ticket to see a black and white photo? I would have had the same damn museum experience searching photos through Google images. Room after room and the finale is a platform with a photo. Nice. I think the most exciting thing in that last room, is King Tut's dagger and the jewelry. So look for that.\n\nIt is crowdeddddd. So if you want to make the most out of your money, you might consider purchasing  an audio tour for an extra 7 or so to save you some time because it is a bit hard to make way to read the descriptions on each exhibit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-15", "description": "This is a special museum. The first time I came here, which was in 2006, I was really excited about a collection that combined contemporary art, folk art and applied art from different parts of the world, and painting from the first half of American history. It almost exoticizes painting and \"the fine arts\" by featuring paintings from when the medium was still developing in America while making the work from the southern hemispheres and Native American societies that is usually exoticized feel like the mainstream tradition of the world's art. \n\nOn a recent visit, in September, I didn't enjoy myself as much. Maybe it was because the composition of the collection was less of a surprise or a novelty, or maybe it was because some of my favorite pieces had been rotated out of the permanent display. One thing that really bothered me was a temporary exhibition of the Paley collection--a private collection assembled in the mid-twentieth century that belongs to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. MoMA is a good place for it: it includes works by Matisse, Picasso, Gauguin, Cezanne, Derain... all the big names who figure in the standard history of modern painting and sculpture. Seeing it at the DeYoung felt weird, because this is a history that the museum's permanent collection ignores. The fact that these works were assembled by a private collector, the large-format photographs of the paintings hanging in the Paleys' home, and the exhibition's title, \"A Taste for Modernism,\" made it seem like an exhibition about interior design--an appropriate theme for the De Young, given its focus on applied art, but it seems like the wrong way to handle these masterworks. In general, I don't like exhibitions of private collections because it becomes about the collectors--not the work of the painters but the money that bought all of it. Sometimes when I'm at major museums I find myself thinking about the structure of the art market and its influence on museum displays, and I like the De Young because it engages a wider variety of art's social contexts and economies. The exhibition of a private collection of modernist masterpieces makes me concerned about the direction the museum is taking, and this is a fairly young museum so it's vulnerable to missteps. \n\nIt was hard for me to choose between three and four stars for me personally, but I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from coming for at least one visit, so I'll give it four.", "author": "Brian D."}

I mean, taking my daughter to see this legendary exhibit was a no-brainer, and I think she was delighted with our Daddy/Daughter date, but really... the exhibit fell short.\n\nHere are some things you should know:\n- There is no coffin (sarcophagus) from Tut's tomb in this exhibit.  All 7 layers of his coffin are somewhere else.  There is an adult sized one of one of his femaie ancestors, but it wasn't in his tomb.  There is a fetus coffin and face mask from one of his two children that didn't die, but it's not very beautiful or ornate.\n- His death-mask is no longer part of the exhibit.  It once was.  Hell, it's the icon of the exhibit, but alas, it's not here.\n- His enbalming jars are there -- well one is -- but be careful or you'll miss it.  It doesn't look like the ones from his ancestors.\n- His mummy has never traveled with the exhibit.  All mummies stay in Egypt.  If you hoped to see a mummy, you'll be disappointed.\n\nWhat's left are some trinkets and a few nice pieces of furniture from his tomb.  His childhood chair...a few nice chests.  I don't mean to seem obsessed with death.  But, that's what you Egyptian tombs are all about -- how they viewed death and the afterlife.\n\n- No photos inside.

At 1pm, best you can do is buy 4:30pm tickets.  Or at least that was the case when I went.*\n\nI know, it's cruel.

Hence, he was bummed.  Tip to parents:  Tut is not a kid friendly exhibit.  Skip and head to Academy of Science if you got young ones under 7.  Why?\n\n1) Exhibits are sitting about 5ft high.\n2) Kids are not allowed to sit on your shoulders to get better view.\n3) Backpacks are not allowed to be worn.  Can only hand carry.\n4) No food or water allowed except in their Cafe and terrace.\nSecurity guards constantly (and courteously) enforce 2, 3, 4.\n\nOh yeah, +++ for the hieroglyphics stencil we bought from gift store.  My 6 year old is now writing \"i hate my sister\" in ancient egyptian prose.

However, the day I went, all the non-member Tut tickets until 4:30pm were sold out.  And they told me buying a membership would get me in asap.  Which we gladly did.  Details, details...see below for Drue's explanation:\n\n\"There are 300 tickets per entry time - a percent go to membership and a percent to the general public. There are days that membership tickets sell out before general admission. If there are membership tickets unsold they are transferred to general admission right before the entry time.\n\nSo.... members are given a situation in which it is more likely they can get tickets for an earlier time, but it is not guaranteed.\"", "author": "Jason Y."}

I arrived about an hour before closing time, but the woman I dealt with at the front desk was still very nice and accommodating and didn't try to make me feel guilty for showing up so late.  Most of the security guards are fairly unobtrusive, and when it was closing time, they announced it to me without hassling me, like a woman over at CA Academy of Sciences had done on another visit.\n\nThe observation tower is amazing-looking.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-26", "description": "Impressive collection of American art, but know that the permanent collection is relatively limited - this is the kind of museum that you go to when there is a special exhibit that you want to see and not a sprawling amalgam of art from many time periods that you can browse at your leisure.  The hubs and I drifted through the American paintings, only stopping on a couple trompe l'oeil pieces that I remember studying in college but had never seen in person.      We did catch some stunning Chihuly and Chuck Close works, along with some killer modern photography (and some Gursky's that I'd never seen before), but the trip felt abbreviated, as if the museum needed another floor or two to explore.  Still, a gorgeous building in an idyllic park means that if your interest wanes on the art, you can always drink in the scenery outside.  Would definitely visit this place again.", "author": "Angela G."}

It reminded me of visiting the Musee d'Orsay in Paris  -- that's where this collection of paintings originates.  The paintings are grouped in schools, with an explanation in each room that highlights the history of and connections between the painters.   The Van Gogh room had several notable paintings of his and is worth the trip in itself.   But there's a lot to learn and appreciate about Cezanne, Gaughin, Renoir, Rousseau, Seurat and many others.  I recommend it highly to anyone who loves art and  art history.  It's quite an improvement over the previous, Impressionist, exhibit.\n\nI give the exhibit itself 5 stars, but securing tickets and going through the multiple lines is a pain.", "author": "Leslie G."}

We had fun and overall the experience was unforgettable. \n\nThis was our first visit back since our high school days, but this time with wedding bands and a 10-month-old in tow. We specifically came to visit the King Tut exhibit, but stopped at the cafe, observatory, and upper floor exhibits. \n\nFirst, the Tut exhibit: better than expected, but crowded. There are lots of rules to control the big crowds, which was good. However, I felt a little bad hiding in the corner to feed our baby because no food or drinks were allowed. The exhibit itself was incredible. There is so much stuff and the information was nicely organized and fascinating to all ages. Lots and lots of information. \n\nThe rest of the museum was really nice. It was relatively empty, especially the upper floor exhibits. It seemed like a nice place to really explore the many different genres of art. \n\nThe observation floor was impressive. So good, in fact, that it made me a little nauseous when we were up there. The gift shop was a little unnecessary, though. \n\nI would bring snacks if you don't want to drop a bunch to eat while you're there.

As Qyper lizok mentioned, the perorated copper also literally takes on a fourth dimensions, as it will change with time.\n\n\n Second, the collecions and shows:\n \nThe recent Tutankhamun exhibit was a lovingly put-together show that used the location for maximum dramatic effect without dumbing the content down.

We were almost certain that we weren't going to get the tickets but we got them just in time for the 2:30 p.m. showing. \n\nThis was the first time that I've been to the DeYoung museum in YEARS and I'd have to say that it's more for people that appreciate art or have knowledge of art. Most of the time I just took quick glances at items without reading the captions but there were a few pieces that intrigued me like the bowl of fruit made of blown glass, a sewn portrait of George Washington made completely from dollar bills, and a abstract chair that looked like it could've belong to Lady Gaga! \n\nAs for the King Tut exhibit, I enjoyed it because I've always had a fascination with ancient egyptian things. Although it was a rather small collection, I can understand the risk that it takes to transfer these 3,000 year-old items. There are 10 galleries with 6 of those being artifacts of King Tut's relatives. The remaining 4 had items that were buried with King Tut and things found inside his tomb. To see the detail and the colors used to decorate these items was an experience in itself. They were all very beautiful. It was a bit disturbing knowing that they took this one crown-looking thing off his mummified skull.  \n\nOverall though, I would only recommend going to DeYoung when it's free even though there's a load of people unless you were really into art.

Wow, how times have changed!  This was my first time in the renovated space, and I have to say the architecture is completely lost on me. There was no proper entrance and the space just seemed inefficiently planned and a bit stark. Evidently the copper exterior is supposed to show it's patina over time, but I saw no evidence of this and was really turned off by it. \n\nThe collections are another story. We had time to enjoy the African exhibit, the special Andy Warhol exhibit and John Friede's \"JOLICA\" collection of Indonesian Oceanic art. The story behind Friede's exhibit is almost more intriguing than the beautiful artifacts. The collection is currently caught in the crosshairs of a legal dispute involving John Friede, his brothers, and an inheritance settlement from Walter Annenberg, which was reportedly used to bankroll this exhibit. \n\nAside from the drama, the De Young's collection is pretty diverse, and the current Warhol exhibition is a good intro to contemporary art, though I found it to be pretty basic. If I had my way I would have pushed the curatorial envelope a bit more. \n\nOverall, the De Young's collection is a nod to it's past, their special exhibits are a nod to the future and the architecture is a bust, but the winning collection trumps the facade. \n\nHeads up, Tut is coming back here in June.", "author": "C L."}

Skipped the Tut exhibit only because I haven't heard very good reviews on it, and I saw it in 1979.  \n\nI'm torn.  I have to say, they did a good job with the building.  It's very unique.  BUT - as someone who grew up in San Francisco and had visited the old museum for many, many times... I have to say that this new building doesn't feel like a museum at all.  It's like a modern art gallery.  It doesn't have that \"classic\" feel anymore that a true museum should.  \n\nI don't know.  Maybe I'm getting old (gasp), but I miss the old museum.  We already have a MOMA in the city - don't need another one.  \n\nStill I give 4 stars because if you don't compare it to what is used to be, it's a very nice place.  The display areas are roomy enough for small crowds to move through.  Plenty of seating for those who tire easily.  Don't know when I'll ever go back, but I'm glad I've visited the new building once.  \n\nDon't forget to go up to the viewing area of the tower.  Beautiful views of the city and the Golden Gate Park area.  And of course, when they say that you can see the Golden Gate Bridge from up there, they're not exactly lying.  You can see the top of the towers peeking out from behind the trees in the way.", "author": "Denise M."}

I wasn't really expecting much because I knew all the famous iconic treasures from his tomb would not be in the exhibit. The exhibit is organized into 10 galleries, the last four of which I think are the best. I know, 10 galleries? Don't worry, it only takes about 2 hours to fully go through the exhibit. I recommend purchasing tickets from Costco, which comes with the audio tour. Entrance is controlled by times and they let in small groups at a time so it doesn't get too crowded inside. \n\nThe exhibit is well organized, with information plates at the top and bottom of the exhibit box. Most of the items come from other tombs, like those of King Tut's grandparents or his great-grandfather. The items in the last four galleries are ones that actually came from his tomb. I can't remember, but I think it was the last gallery that has a few items that were actually found on King Tut, wrapped in the linens. My favorite was the sword. It was so detailed and ornate.\n\nI had a great time looking at all the treasures in this exhibit. I highly recommend checking it out before it's gone. Admission to the exhibit also includes admission to the museum, and if you have time you should take a look around at the galleries.", "author": "Lyn L."}

It was a clear day so we could see the ocean to the west the golden gate bridge to the north and the bay and financial district to the east. It was like a work of art to see the city sprawling out below us. It is a very unique view and it is nice because there are no other large buildings near by to obstruct the view. \n\nWe also had lunch at the cafe and it was very good. We both ordered salad and it was reasonably priced and were very large, fresh and refreshing. \n\nI look forward to coming back in the near future to check out the King Tut exhibit. Another cool feature is that on the first full weekend of the month Bank of America sponsors free admission to the museum for customers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-09", "description": "I went to the King Tut exhibit at the De Young Museum last week and found it to be pretty cool. I hadn't ever been so it was all new to me.\n(I guess it has come around in various guises throughout the years.)\n\nYou're looking at a child's chair, jewelry and statuettes from 3,500 years ago. (Many statuettes were placed in the burial vault to be 'servants to do hard labor for the King in the afterlife.' - Though they shouldn't be needed because all kings became Gods in the afterlife.\n\nLooking at this stuff makes you wonder how dude feels about being on display. \"We\" ransacked his grave in the name of... history? \nThis exhibit does make bank.\nWhat if we put all the things back where they were and suddenly a curse was lifted? Yea. What if all of a sudden, canned sitcom laughter sounded less like ocean waves and more like real human snickers???.... Naw. \n\nDid you Mr. Tut came to power at 9 years old and died at 19?\nI get the hit he was more of a dilettante king. More into statues of himself and less into Universal Health Care.  \nI also think THIS king probably didn't reincarnate as Elvis because there is little to no trace of musical instruments in what I saw.\n\nNuf about that though.  I do recommend going. \n\nBut you may have some sticker shock. \nIt can cost as much at $32 to get in. The 'free Tuesday of the month' doesn't cover special exhibits.\n(I had paid $25 as part of a networking business exchange, so I'm not exactly what the rate is for adults.)\n\n At the end of the exhibit they have a changing projection on a slab of concrete that shows pictures of the actual mummy with various implements found in the coffin shifting in and out of focus. A big necklace around Tutman's neck, then you see a dagger near his side etc. It's mildly creepy but interesting all the same.\n\nWhat's great is that there are no tour guides. \nThey give you a thing to listen to (shaped like an old telephone or tv remote). \n\nCertain displays have numbers posted on them. You push the numbers on the device and listen to Omar Sarif tell you about the history of the object in a (too) thick egyptian accent.\n\nThe rooms are all really dark with powerful lighting on the various displays.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-03", "description": "Having recently seen the Chiluly exhibit and seeing that I just returned from free museum day, I feel inspired to bring you...\n\nThe De Young Museum: A review in two acts\n\n(NOTE: This'll be a long one so curl up with a cuppa and get ready to read.)\n\nPrologue\nBeing unemployed and having a crap load of time on my hands, I'm making it my mission to do all the museums that offer free days. First on the list was the De Young, mostly for the recently opened Andy Warhol exhibit ($10 separate entrance fee but it was for all special exhibits. Including Yves Saint Laurent. Holla), but also just because I hadn't been in the rest of the museum in a while.\n\nACT ONE - ANDY\nFor an artist that I practically adore, I knew very little about Mr. Warhol before seeing this exhibit. I mean I knew he was a bit \"out there\" but not THAT out there. But I don't think I should be surprised. He was a successful artist in the 60's, and anyone doing anything worth talking about back then had to be a genius or completely off the wall, quite possibly both. At any rate this exhibit was definitely impressive and in depth. For example, I had no idea how into dance &amp; classical music he was. It made me want to DESPERATELY purchase the diagram of the tango in the gift shop along with the print of the silk screened image of Marilyn. But then I remembered I was putting off getting my dry cleaning because it costs $30. Oh well, maybe I can get it for my birthday :)\n\nACT TWO - YVES\n\"Fashion changes, style remains\"\n\nThis statement could not be said more accurately or beautifully. For someone who doesn't care what is fashionable except in the \"Is this going to make me look like a house?\" way, I was utterly floored by the Yves Saint Laurent exhibit. Seriously, near tears with the beauty and style I feel I have been starved of for so long. With vague interest, I wandered into this exhibit and was promptly schooled on the master of modern women's fashion. \n\nAnd in all seriousness, the styles that YSL is famous for - the women's tuxedo, the pants suit, the pea coat - are as stylish today as they were 40 years ago. At least half of the exhibits made me want to run out to my nearest consignment shop and scour the place for such timeless articles. And the other half were just as inspiring but in the way that makes you think, \"I can't imagine wearing that but this man was an imaginative genius.\"\n\nExhibits like this sometimes make me sad. It makes me think our best years are behind us. Perhaps it really HAS all been done before. But then again there is hope. For all the ironic t-shirts, skinny jeans, and other fashion mistakes I pray to end each day, it is that hope for the return of fashion that HAS style that keeps me praying. After all, if it has all been done before, it most definitely will be done again.\n\nEpilogue\nThe rest of the museum was as I remembered it, impressive and extensive. The best are the places to sit :) But in the end I have to tip my hat to the De Young. A fabulous main hall as well as some truly amazing special exhibits makes this museum one to watch and visit regularly.", "author": "Alexis B."}

I'll break it down, though, because they're very different experiences.\n\nAite, here we goes!\n(WARNING: This is part review, part personal ramblings.  I think Yelp is quickly replacing my personal blog, so ya'll just have to put up with my irrelevant personal notes!  You can stop here if you don't want to deal with all that.)\n\n1.  The Deyoung Museum\n+ Awesome location in the park.  Although, I'm a bit biased because I only live a few blocks away.\n+ Every first weekend of the month, Bank of America customers can get in for FREE.  This is an AWESOME perk.  So break out that plastic; it is well worth it!\n+  If you asked me to describe what kind of art this museum holds, I'd have trouble explaining because it's got so much: Oceanic, Revolutionary-era American art, Modern Art, random sculptures, African, and the list goes on.  They always have pretty cool special exhibits, including a recent Yves Saint Laurent piece, a Maya Lin domino-like installation, and more.  Stay tuned for craziness this summer when King Tut arrives; it'll be crazy/awesome when that happens.\n+ There's a Turrell skyspace outside!  I like these things because you can sit in there for a long time and zone out or fall asleep or have long talks with whoever you're with.\n+ It just feels...the way a museum should.  With all the dim lighting, the darkish rooms, the galleries.  Oh!  And it doesn't have much modern art, which is always cool in my book because I hate modern art. \n\n2.  Friday Nights at the Deyoung\nSo, I've heard of Friday Nights at the Deyoung for the past year or so but never bothered to check it out.  Tonight, my friend and I finally decided to hit up this event, and WOW, what a great introduction to Friday Nights @ the museum!  We walked in, and some lady asked me if I wanted to talk to some guy dressed as Andy Warhol who was being videotaped.  At first I was like, errrrrr, but then I thought, oh what the hell, I'll just do it, it could be fun.  \n\nSo, I signed some forms, sat down, had a really stupid, inane conversation with the actor, and then just as I was walking away, I read the poster which said that all the \"interviews\" would be posted online, on flickr, on facebook, and the one voted most \"liked\" would get some sort of prize.  Oh boo.  This was right after I gave them a bunch of fake contact information on the forms.  So now even if a prize comes along (srsly doubt it), I won't be getting anything, AND there's some stupid video of myself and a stupid actor talking about soap pads floating around online.  FML. \n\nBut anyway, that was the worst of it.  Everything else was really cool.  There were special fashion exhibits, free Fiji water, a jazz band, and lots of swing dancing.  What I thought would be a night of just looking at and making fun of art surprisingly turned into almost two hours of swing dancing.  My friend and I were at least 10 years younger than everyone around us, but whatever, it was so awesome!  I've never done any swing dancing in my life, but this was so fun, and the crowd was so fun to watch, and so even though I was messing up a lot, I didn't care at all.  I felt just so happy and alive and nothing could wipe the smile off my face.  High on life.  That's how I felt. \n\nI had so much fun in those two hours, and I quickly realized afterwards that I don't want it to just end.  I just feel like if you meet a new person or discover a new thing or new experience that makes you so incredibly happy and feel so alive, by all means, GO FOR IT because life's too short to just stand on the sidelines and watch.  So now, I'm going to look into taking swing dancing lessons.  Swing is really cool, fun, cute.  I can/will do all that!\n\nSo, yes, spanks to the Deyoung Museum for putting on these FREE shindigs every Friday night, for giving people the opportunity to discover something new and exciting, for promoting cultural stuff that's also extremely fun and vibrant.\n\nFive stars for cool museum, diverse artwork, consistently good special exhibits, free/fun Friday nights, and the opportunity to discover something new that makes you feel more alive than you have in a long, long time.  \n\nCheers to the Deyoung!", "author": "Vivian C."}

Most of the material I already knew or was familiar with. In retrospect, I don't think I would have missed much if I didn't see the exhibit. The crowd/lines inside the exhibit were ridiculous. I mean, come on! If there are designated entry times, you would think the crowd would be more manageable.\n\nYes, parking is a rip off, but when is parking ever a good deal?", "author": "Kathryn C."}

I am not a very cultured person and walking around in this museum makes me feel like a phony.\n\nThe de Young is huge and impressive though. I came for the Asian American Art Exhibit (which I will Yelp soon) because my professor gave us this visit as an assignment. Student tickets for general admission are $6, which is very reasonable...but I can't say the same for the Special Exhibits (ie Asian American Art).\n\nI don't have much to say about the museum besides that it is a must-visit for people who like these things. I went through the Yves Saint Laurent exhibit, but alas...I'm not into high fashion either! My favorite piece of his was this wedding dress which was like a white furry dome...seeing an actual model strutting down the runway in that thing would make my day. Hell yeah, the igloo look.\n\nAnd then his quote: \"The most beautiful clothes a woman can wear are the arms of the man who loves her.\" That's pretty clever Mr. Saint Laurent! Maybe I'll put it in my favorite quotes on Facebook. Only, this is San Francisco...let's not assume that it's a man doing the loving.\n\nThat being said, my favorite part of my visit to de Young was walking around with my hand held by the guy who likes me (I hope).", "author": "K W."}

This time they had a special exhibition for Yves Saint Laurent, and, Asian American Modern Art featuring Maya Lin.  There was another exhibition showing off prints, but I get tired of prints fast.\n\nThe two major exhibitions are great.  Keep in mind that the Saint Laurent collection is the only showing in the country.  Why?  In the words of the Laurent house, \"Well because they asked us.\"  Although I'm not much of a fan of looking at fashion displayed on mannequins, this wasn't much of  a problem.  The haute couture designs are so meticulously made that it'll impress the truck driver in you.\n\nIn all honesty I thought there would be more on Saint Laurent's creative process and techniques; instead, they just displayed many pieces from his prolific career.  That's not to say there isn't a lot of fashion to be seen.  So much evening wear!\n\nThe highlight for me was the Asian American Modern Art exhibition.  I'm a fan of Asian American Art, so this was a treat.  Often times I think that Asian American Artists are overlooked.  I was glad to see them mention this in their exhibition statement.\n\nMaya Lin's exhibition is awesome as well.  Until now I haven't really heard of her.  She's an artist I'll be looking out for in the future.  She does sculpture work inspired by environmental formations.  Through the use of imaging techniques Lin manipulates wood, metal, and other mediums to portray the environment in a new exciting fashion.  She has an outdoor sculpture at the Academy of Sciences near the cafe so keep an eye out.  I always wondered who made that cool sculpture.\n\nOne gripe I have of De Young is their pricing of merchandise.  I understand that museums will charge a higher percentage than retail stores in order to sustain themselves.  But there comes a point when too much is too much.  Their Saint Laurent DVDs were going for $30.  And their Karl Lagerfeld DVDs were going for $36.  That's as much as a hardcover book!  I guess that's what the Internet is for.\n\nNOTE: If you're feeling a bit adventurous try going here without buying a ticket.  Not once did I see anyone look at my ticket or sticker.  hahaha", "author": "Michael H."}

I was fortunate enough to see the Post Impressionist exhibit. (van gogh, Cezanne, Matisse) We arrived at 2, as suggested, to stand in line for the 2:30 showing. This didn't take too long, however, they could have done a better job at monitoring the crowds already and still viewing. When we made that final turn before entering the exhibit- my breath was literally taken away by the sight of a stunning golden piece titled \"La Carmencita\"...to the art director whom arranged the lighting for this event, bravo.... I tend to notice things other than the actual subject at times, and admired the frame work, and choice of wall colors in every room. Well, onto the Van Gogh...if you ever have the chance to see what \"van gogh blue\" is, in person, I suggest you do so...my heart flopped, and I literally struggled to fight back tears...it was incredibly moving. \n\nThey do offer an audio tour, which can be quite annoying to some, since a lot of folks (with the headsets) just stand around for a longer period of time (it must be very informative)- and you kinda have to nudge your way around, however, I'm sure its not like this while viewing the permanent collection. \n\nIf youre ever near, I highly suggest even just taking a peek off the tower deck...wow! (and free) I enjoyed this more than the view from Sears Tower... I cant wait to find an excuse to go again- especially since Ive been reading about the upcoming Picasso exhibit!

I'd read all the complaints about it in the newspaper and the opposition to the parking garage underneath.  Last year's Bouquets to Arts exhibit was the first time I'd been here.  It was shortly after I retired.  I was entranced w/ the exhibit, but I was equally taken w/ the building itself, which has windows in unexpected places offering glimpses of the outdoors, of landscaping enclosed w/in the building, of the copper exterior walls, of galleries below.  I love the convenience of the parking lot, which allows access when the park is closed to cars on weekends.\n\nNina, Larry, Alan and I came this morning for the Chihuly exhibit.  Nina and I first saw Chihuly's work 15 or 20 years ago, I think, in the little art museum on the campus of Southern Oregon University in Ashland and I was hooked.  I've seen it at the Smithsonian and in a variety of galleries and a huge show last year at the Fairchild Tropical Botanical Gardens in Miami.  The latter show was both inside and outside w/ glass artfully arranged among the plants.  This exhibit is more concentrated and it is exceptional.  The first room contains an exhibit of his vase-like forms.  Another room shows his ikebana forms.  A third room showed a collection of Native American patterned woolen trading blankets, most by Pendleton, on one long wall.  On the opposite wall was a collection of Chihuly basket forms intermingled w/ Native American baskets in various sizes and patterns.  A massive wooden plank running the length of the room in the middle was arranged more of the basket forms, some alone some nested.  The room was dim and the colors were earthy and translucent and it was mesmerizing.  The next room held huge, colorful Macchia, folded and mottled bowls.  At some point in the exhibit was a series of pale purple upright forms stuck into logs, looking like so many gorgeous birthday candles.  One room held chandeliers.  Another room held cylinders w/ woven glass designs fused onto the outside and the room adjacent to that had a glass ceiling on which seaforms and Persians were arranged.  It was impossible to keep my jaw from dropping open.  Another room contained two boats, one piled high w/ various colorful shapes exploding from it, the other a more quiet collection of large and colorful balls. The last room  was another long exhibit of various fanciful plant- and animal-like forms interspersed w/ large ball forms.  Everyone seemed as excited about the glass as we were.  In each room I heard guards admonishing people not to touch and to stay behind the grey tape or to be mindful of their purses.  They must have felt like kindergarten teachers.  I was annoyed at first, but it's completely understandable.  The glass is fragile and not to be touched, although I wanted to.  It's the kind of exhibit I'm going to want to return to.  Last year I was so thrilled w/ Bouquets to Art that we joined the museums, so we're members and I can, as often as I want.\n\nWe went to the observation tower, which affords an incredible 360* view of San Francisco and environs.  You can see the Academy of Sciences building across the concourse, getting ready for its September opening.  The bandshell is being renovated.  After lunch we went outside to see the saffron tower, but it wasn't that impressive in the daylight.  Maybe at night.  The towers we saw at Fairchild were much more striking.  The Andy Goldsworthy piece in the entrance on the way out was powerful and interesting. \n\nWe looked a little at some of the permanent collection and then decided to go home.  But as we were on our way to the garage our attention was caught by a video, \"Chihuly in the Hot Shop\", a 90 minute account of his reunion w/ glassblowers he'd worked w/ 20 years ago.  We came in in the middle and couldn't stay until the end, but what we saw was pure glass porn.  We bought one to take home.", "author": "Toni M."}

We want to stand in front of his works and say stuff like, \"That Andy Warhol really had vision\", \"Andy Warhol broke down barriers\", and \"Andy Warhol liked to dress up as a clown and run around scaring children.\"  Okay, not the last one, but what I really ended up saying is \"this is crap\".  The emperor has no clothes.  Maybe it's because I'm not as celebrity-crazed as some or maybe some would say I just don't have sophisticated taste, but honestly out of maybe 200 pieces, I liked about 5 (and those mostly from his early work).  Can't we just all admit that Warhol was a drugged out, partying, eccentric, flamboyant, and quirky artist who may have been amusing and interesting but mostly generated garbage?\n\nNot to be a party pooper, but I felt a bit the same about the YSL exhibit.  Yes, I'm a dude, so I don't think I am exactly in the target audience for this one in the first place.  But, 95% of the stuff in the YSL exhibit was outrageous and gaudy and nobody would ever wear it outside.  I just don't get that about fashion.  The handful of \"normal\" pieces could be pretty hot, but it was hard to tell when they were draped on mannequins from 1982.  \n\nI don't like being a downer and giving negative reviews - I really wanted to like the De Young.  But, I'm not willing to lie to feign sophistication by someone else's standard (what, you're not supposed to eat hot tamales while drinking wine?).  The building is cool, the size of the museum is manageable and not overwhelming, and there is some pretty good variety with the African, American, and Latin American collections, as well as some mod stuff.

And never on a Friday night.\n\n-The service will be short, cold, and at times downright unprofessional and rude. The \"security guard\" outside actually started a verbal altercation with Basi L and WOULD NOT back down, even though there was no problem to begin with. \n\n-If there is a special exhibit, you may have to wait in a line running the length of the entire lobby for over an hour to get anywhere near said exhibit.\n\n-Unless you have a really good job, you probably won't be able to afford to get drunk enough here to make the visit worth your while.

The regular exhibits are decent, but the special exhibits are always great. Friday nights at the de Young are a blast. It's great that they have live music in the lobby. I do wish they kept the tower open a little later though - being up in the tower at night would be quite an experience! The de Young is truly an amazing place, and the store is fun to browse. If you decide to drive to the museum, keep in mind that the nearby streets tend to be pretty chaotic. You can sometimes find free street parking near the intersection of Fulton Street and 10th Avenue. Note that Fulton has a 2 hour limit whereas the numbered streets don't.\n\nRENTING THE DE YOUNG - 3 stars\nThe short version: the de Young is a wonderful place for any special event. We are so glad we had our wedding at there. 5 stars for the gorgeous venue, but 2 stars for some of the staff we had to deal with. No issues when dealing with the facility rental staff directly. However, there was clearly a serious lack of communication between the staff and security personnel. Can't believe how unreasonable and difficult they were to deal with on the day of the event.\n\nThe long version: The facility rental staff are really good with email. Securing the date, signing the contract, etc, were pretty straight forward. Keep in mind that the vendors on their recommended vendors list tend to be quite pricey, and you are limited to a small selection of approved catering companies. Everything went really smoothly with the de Young until the rehearsal and the day of the wedding...\n\nWe held our rehearsal in the sculpture garden (the actual space of our ceremony) on a weekday afternoon. We were interrupted multiple times by different security personnel telling us we were not allowed to be in the garden. Each time someone came to tell us off, I told them the facility rental manager was aware we were holding a wedding rehearsal at that time. Eventually, security told us we absolutely had to get out of the garden ASAP and should use the cafe terrace instead. Firstly, why would we come all the way out to Golden Gate Park to hold our rehearsal in the space adjacent to our actual ceremony space? For the amount of money we paid to rent the venue, I think an hour long rehearsal should be allowed. Secondly, it doesn't make any sense for us to be on the cafe terrace playing music on our little boombox while other museum visitors were sitting there eating and drinking. Security would rather us disturb other visitors on the terrace than let us rehearse in the empty garden. \n\nOn the day of the wedding, the main entrance security personnel would not let us inside the museum because we had flowers. They told us to wait by the doors until we were granted special clearance. San Francisco in July is absurdly cold. My bridesmaids and I were freezing! Then, another member of security later came over to yell at us for standing near the doors. Awesome. Security also mistook the groom's parents for guests and refused to let them inside even though their names were on a list of approved people. Completely ridiculous that security kept trying to turn them away without even bothering to consult the list. \n\nOur florist and her staff showed up at the de Young around 1pm. They started decorating the garden with paper lanterns. Security made them take the lanterns down even though the lanterns had been pre-approved. Someone else showed up and said the lanterns were fine, so our florist put the lanterns back up. Then, someone else yelled at them for hanging lanterns on the trees again. Eventually, we had to sort this out with the on-site staff ourselves. Not exactly something you want to deal with a couple hours before your wedding ceremony.\n\nde Young staff wouldn't let our florist and her team unload any flowers and insisted that everything be stored in some storage space until about an hour before the wedding. As a result, $500 of orchids wilted in some storage space. Wow, what a waste. Our florist was forced to improvise and sent her team to nearby stores to pick up pink roses at the very last minute. Apparently the de Young staff member on site threw a fit and stormed off when our florist started arranging rose petals on the tables to make up for the missing orchids. I did not see this myself, but it does not sound very professional at all. \n\nAfter our event, we felt like we were being rushed to leave. I understand they needed us to clear out so they take down everything and clean up, but it was very overwhelming as we were saying goodbye to guests and gathering our belongings. Not a pleasant end to the night. We're so glad we chose to have our wedding at the de Young, but things could have gone a lot smoother.", "author": "Waz W."}

However during the day, the entire structure is covered with a dark brown grid looking material.  The construction of the rooms are also somewhat confusing, it gets exhausting as you meander around.  You are pretty much at a lost as far which way to go. The only thing that I did like is the 360-degree view from the de Young Tower.  There is an direct elevator that goes up to the top level. The elevator does not stop anywhere on the way back down to the first floor.  It's not nearly as high up as the view from Twin Peaks but it's worth seeing.\n\nThe collection is so so.  Religious paintings, weaved baskets and blankets, carpets, tapestries, craved ivory and wood, recent artwork from unfamiliar artists, blown glass, wearable art, etc.  Gallery highlights include Art of the Americas, Native American Art, Art of Africa, Art of Oceania, and Textiles.  A changing photography exhibition, I saw a few celebrity portraits of Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn, Kirk Douglas, etc.  I didn't see Art in America to the 20th Century, and Contemporary American Art which other reviewer said was boring, maybe I didn't miss anything.  The artist names for the American art here that I am familiar with are Copley, Sargent, Cassatt, Lloyd Wright, O'keeffe, Rivera, and de Kooning.  The art collection does not include my favorite periods, impressionist and neo-impressionist. From the visitors guide, \"Guest artists present exhbitions on the themes of shifting identities, personal narratives, and cultural assumptions.\"  This is a museum?  Hmmm, whatever.  There seems to be a whole lot of something going on, what that is I can't really say.\n\nThere are two \"Introduction to the de Young\" docent tours a day, which might be a good idea as the the traffic flow and room placement is pretty random.  The Nan Kemper - American Chic exhibit was closed for some reason.  No flash in the galleries, still photography is allowed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-04-24", "description": "The missus and I decided to take in the new DeYoung museum after regarding its incredibly ugly tower from various vantage points outside the park. Between rain squawls on Sunday, we traipsed as a couple that was grateful to get out of the rain, as well as a couple of art lovers who might consider membership. Bottom Line: STAY AWAY.\n\nThe building is not what I would consider a \"gift to the street\". It looks more like a grain elevator that's been caught in some sort of mosquito netting for protective purposes. Inside, the layout is confusing to the point of off-putting. I'm willing to accept a certain amount of creative splitting up of galleries, hallways, stairways and elevators but this is ridiculous. \n\nStaffing was a mixed bag... Some people were incredibly polite and helpful. One kind person actually led us away from a long line at admissions and moved us toward self-service PCs that, among other things, asked whether we'd like to become members. I thought it might be a good idea (seeing as we've joined just about every other museum in town) but my wife sagely recommended a wait-and-see-if-we-like-the-place attitude. Good thing!\n\nThere's some kind of gray eminence that prevails over the venue. To my eye, the galleries were darker than they should be. Acoustics were LOUD. I like some peace and quiet to look at art and the hard floors and sourd reflecting walls and ceilings seemed to amplilfy any noise in the room.\n\nBut the museum's real problem is one of public relations and handling its prospects. There's an attitude there that is not friendly toward visitors. The collections are stunning. As a for instance, we tried to go to the Frank Lloyd Wright exhibit, only to learn that it costs an extra $5 per person or some such to attend. That would have been fine, but at four-thirty or somewhere around that time, the admissions desk where you could pay the extra money was closed. The museum was open for another 1/2 hour, so we figured that it might be a good opportunity for management to essentially \"promo\" a short visit, but NO-O-O-O. We were turned back at the entry. It isn't good publicity to not permit a person to see a gallery without a ticket and then not provide a way for people to buy a ticket, even if their visiting time would be limited.\n\nOkay, rightee-oh, on to the next attraction. How about the fine collection of art of the Americas. Really pretty. Two floors up. Maybe take the elevator, Guess What? Elevator only goes up one floor. Have to change. No problem. But where. Guides don't know but one has enough presence of mind to tell my wife that the back pack that is hanging by one band over her shoulder and then cradled in the crook of her arm must be \"hand held.\" Meaning, we suppose that neither of its shoulder straps should be laced over the shoulder. \n\nWhat's that all about.\n\nWe entered feeling good about getting out of the rain and harboring general good will toward the museum as a shelter from the storm. We left thinking, \"Boy am I glad we didn't join! This place thinks way to much of itself.\"\n\nThen we were outside. The sun was shining. And we looked back at a building that is a true eye sore and felt glad to escape to prettier parts of GGP, like the arboretum across the street.", "author": "Dan M."}

I haven't visited since its remodeling, and De Young does not fail to disappoint.  Various things from my visit:\n\n1.  The architecture of De Young is stunning:  the bronzed cladding and the unique V-shaped design of the building is a pleasure to admire.  The 360 degree view from the observation deck tower is amazing, and I didn't know that the view rivaled the one from Embarcadero Center.  All around you, one can see the Golden Gate Park, the various districts of the City, the Golden Gate Bridge, downtown, the Bay and the Pacific Ocean.  This view is worth the picture!\n\n2.  Collections are superbly presented, yet slightly random:  while I enjoyed the well-organized and themed floors, it often felt that the De Young lacked a sense of consistency.  I was looking forward to seeing their Asian art collections, but I saw little of those.  There seems to be little sense of unity in their collections, and often seemed to lack of theme in what they are attempting to project to the visitor.  Perhaps they could introduce larger focal pieces that would direct my attention to any theme?\n\n3.  Sculpture garden and random art pieces a surprising joy to see:  the modern art garden is perfect for taking pictures and on a sunny SF day, sitting outside at the De Young Cafe and enjoying time with those you came with makes visiting this star jewel of SF a pleasure.  To experience San Francisco culture, no visit isn't complete without checking out De Young.\n\nHighly recommended as a must-see in SF.", "author": "JC K."}

If you haven't been to this world-class museum yet, I would definitely suggest doing so now because the new Chihuly special exhibit is awesome- literally, you will be awestruck by the beauty of his work and installations as you travel through the exhibit.  Even my brother, who tends to be both crowd and art-averse, thought the exhibit was gorgeous and well-worth spending a sunny Saturday afternoon inside.\n\nThe Chihuly exhibit showcases some of the greatest glass sculptures you'll ever see up-close and personal.  The beauty of this exhibit is that you can get pretty close to see all the various colorations in the glass, while also taking in the installation as a whole.  Photos without flash are allowed, so bring a camera or at least your cell phone, so that you can capture some of the beauty in front of you.  Be prepared for long lines though- both to purchase tickets and then going through the exhibit itself.  Make sure that you show up EARLY- tickets to the exhibit do sell out before the museum closes, since the last group gets to go in at 4 pm.\n\nWhile the star of my visit today was the Chihuly exhibit, the De Young also offers the tower and observation deck, which is surprisingly free.  Its been great to be able to view the progress of the new Academy of Sciences building across the way, as well as to just get views of a part of San Francisco that you normally would not get.  Their cafe is also pretty good- you can sit inside if its a cold, foggy day or sit outside on the grass if its nice.\n\nAll in all, a great musuem that most definitely warrants a trip to Golden Gate Park.  Parking can be a bit of a hassle, but with enough patience and some luck, you'll be able to find free street parking.

When it was being built, I assumed that it was wrapped in scaffolding that would reveal a beautiful objet d'art when removed.

Couldn't be more out-of-place in GG Park if it WERE a smokestack.\n\nHouses a first-rate collection of realistic American art which is, unfortunately, art's most boring genre.  A nice space for traveling collections.  Otherwise, worthwhile bits and pieces.  Strange to find a pre-Columbian fragment there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-24", "description": "Like most recent reviewers, I journeyed to the de Young museum to check out \"Van Gogh, Gauguin, C\u00e9zanne and Beyond: Post-Impressionist Masterpieces from the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay\". It was, in a word, fantastic. The line to enter the exhibit is just like being at Disneyland, with VIP members getting first priority. Once you are granted entrance, you then feel like herded cow.  Everyone's anxious to see the paintings, so clumping and huddling will naturally occur. Be cautious of the black tape, which keeps you about a foot and a half distance from some of the paintings. I unknowingly stepped over the line at one point, and the \"museum police\" were on me like white on rice! Eek! \n\nThe museum is easily accessible via public transportation [we BART'd and MUNI'd it]. The staff was helpful and courteous. The caf\u00e9 wasn't too bad, I'd say above average for museum food.  There is a Hot menu where you place your order for grilled items and sit down, and a Cold menu option where you can grab sammiches, antipasta and cold drinks. The museum stores are great. There is a store on the main floor, and another one located right outside of the exhibit (See? Just like at Disneyland..). I will say that the latter was better than I had expected. There are a variety of products to choose from that come plastered with your favorite painting. A sample list includes: magnets, postcards, note cards, playing cards, business card holder, and bookmarks. \n\nI walked away with a handful of favorite artists and paintings, and a newfound appreciation for Pointillism [think Georges Seurat's \"A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\"].\n\nThe other exhibits in the museum are good, too. But they really do pale in comparison to the main event. \n\nOther handy dandy tips when visiting the de Young: \n- Buy your tickets from Costco. It's cheaper and comes with an audio tour. The audio tour is a nice little perk. In lieu of a guided tour, this allows you to glean more insight into the artists and their works.  \n- Be sure to reserve your tour time. Don't just randomly show up one afternoon because chances are high that you'll be turned away. \n- Visit the Observation Tower. It's FREE (woot!) and has amazing views of the City. \n- Take public transportation. It may take more time, but it's also more convenient. \n- If you intend on taking notes, use a pen & paper. I was innocently taking notes on the notepad of my iPhone and was scolded immediately because there are no electronic devices allowed.  \n- Arrive early and take your time.  There is A LOT to see. And unless you're going to make a trip to Musee d'Orsay (highly suggested, may I add), make the time to truly enjoy these works of art. \n \nThe Post-Impressionist exhibit is there through January 2011. And the line-up for the rest of 2011 is looking pretty exciting!", "author": "Shereen R."}

I knew from other Yelpers that it was not a definitive sampling from his tomb, but I was thrilled, nevertheless, to see over 3,000-year-old artifacts looking gorgeous and exquisite in design, like his diadem with carnelian and gold, a great shield with Tut as a sphinx, his gold sword and his ceremonial crook and flail. I thought the installation was well done, lighting, and traffic flow were handled well. We paid full price rather than get in long lines on a weekend or free Target day. \n\nWe enjoy the De Young very much, and I especially like the American 19th-century paintings by Sargent, Bingham and others. Whistler's scathing \"Frilthy Lucre\" ( that's how he spells it) painting of a creditor is great. Very out of character for him. Some nice marble sculptures too--love Penelope. We were pleasantly surprised by the Amish quilt collection. Really amazing how like op art these patterns and colors are. We enjoy the cafe mainly for the view of the sculpture garden and Japanese Tea House. Sat outside under the plastic tent covering the patio and enjoyed the rain.

The photography exhibit was displayed terribly.  The work was interesting but displayed in amateurish mountings that made them difficult to see.  One of their more important pieces is the Rembrandt Peale oil of George Washington which is hidden upstairs in a poorly lit side hallway (dim, unflattering lighting is a problem in a number of exhibits here).\n\nBiggest pain in the neck at the de Young is the security staff who are extremely intrusive.  If you're a guy, don't carry anything if you can help it.  Women can swing their pocketbooks & shopping bags freely.  Guys are subjected to a bag inspection (do terrorists visit mediocre museums?); and them further harassment in other rooms.  Over my shoulder I was carrying a small camera bag and I also had a small drawstring sack on my back.  First security guy informed me that I was not allowed to have anything on my back but he was fine with it hanging just from one shoulder.  In the next room I was told that wasn't ok so I moved my camera bag & sack to hang from my elbow and that guard said that was OK.  Later still a 3rd guard told us that bags can only be held in your hand and in front of you or they must be checked.  The guards explained that they are afraid people might back into a display if they forgot they were carrying something or they might swing a bag into some artwork if it was dangling.

I highly reccommend anyone planning to see this marvelous once in a lifetime exhibit unless you travel to NY or France to come see it before it ends in Jan 11.  I am going to reserve my tickets again because I want to see it again and bring other friends to see it with.  \n\nFor those of you who do not know the Musee D'Orsay in France is undergoing renovations and so they are having this VERY SPECIAL exhibit of Post Impressionist art here at the DEYOUNG only, and I believe so in NY too!   So- once in a lifetime!   I am so inspired whenever I see my favorite artists pieces in real life, nothing compares to seeing or reading it in text books.  The Post Impressionist begins with Renoir, and goes on to Van Gogh, Gaughin, Cezanne and more.  There is even one Picasso painting.  I loved the Van Gogh and will make my own rendition of STARRY NITE OVER THE RHONE (to paint and place near my STARRY NITE that I did a long time ago).  Gaughin is facintating in that his earlier influences weren't evident til later he even had a midlife crisis and is facinating in his self portrait with yellow Christ.  Not a fan of pointilissm but have to say there are some that really looked awesome!  Artists who veered toward symbolims are toward the end (some of whom I've never really knew of) but will check out. \n\nVery important also- once you are in you cannot re-enter.  So even though it is crowded take a break and sit on the coaches once in awhile to get from room to room.  \n\nDefinitely worth the money!!!! And definitely one of the best exhibits I've seen in all my museum experiences....I missed the earlier one though the Monet one :(....Am waiting to see the PICASSO one that I believe is showing in June/July 2011 at De Young.

Take a moment to admire it on the inside and out, stroll through the outdoor gardens and look up at the tower from below.\n\nSure the rotating exhibits like Chihuly are a wonderful draw, but the diversity of art here really surprised me. The Art in America to the 20th Century and Contemporary Art wings held several nice moments for me admiring paintings that have the ability to take you to another time and place, just for a moment.  The Native American, African and Oceania collections held blankets, masks, tapestries baskets and carvings all worth a view.  I had a lot of fun going up and down the extra fat steps which require two feet per step to navigate, working the leading leg extra hard by the time you reach the top step. \n\nA must see is the view from the tower, take the elevator up to the observation deck for a 360-degree treat that you don't want ot miss.  The view of the living roof of the Academy of Sciences building, Golden Gate Park and the skyline view are gorgeous. \n\nIf you only have a few minutes rest on a bench in the garden and admire the building, but you could easily spend many hours here like I have.", "author": "Laurie H."}

And the museum looks like a huge, uninspired block of copper - oh wait, it is a huge block of copper.  Which will quickly rust, given its proximity to a very large body of salt water.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I decided to take the plunge and enter the de Young - hey, at least I would get a break from looking at that ugly tower while I was indoors.  \r\n\r\nBUT, as the boyfriend and I were approaching the front doors, we noticed four mercedes SUVs parked on the sidewalk in front of the museum.   At that point I nearly vomited.  What were these horrible manifestations of EVIL doing parked ON A SIDEWALK in front of a PUBLIC museum?  Plus, they made the de Young even uglier because they were silver and they totally clashed with their copper background. \r\n\r\nBut I digress....\r\nI was surprised at how aesthetically pleasing the inside of the museum was - in sharp contrast to its outside (did I mention that the exterior is very ugly?).

I hadn't been there in 5 or so years when they closed it down, tore it up and put up the current Mayan Temple they call a museum. The crack in the pavement piece that run through the entryway is very cool and fun. I love it when architectural art plays a role in the design, and this one certainly did. \n\nThe collection itself is good. I like Post-Modernism and the pieces they have on display are pretty good. The modernist stuff is good and the traditional arts area is probably their strongest. It's all done very traditionally with well-made labels and excellent way-finding. \n\nThe two rotating exhibits we went to were a mixed bag. The Yves Sanit-Laurant exhibition was fantastic, one of the best exhibits of it's kind I've ever seen. They let the objects speak and did little in the way of set-dressing, which is a problem I usually have with exhibits of this kind. The dresses were amazing and the interpretation was top-notch. As a museum, it's th ekind of exhibit I wish I could put together. \n\nThe Andy Warhol exhibit was OK. I wasn't thrilled, though there were some of the most significant pieces of his career there, like the Brillo boxes, but there was also a lot missing from it and it seemed to cover much of the same ground in multiple ways. The exhibit of album covers was the highlight, as was the coverage of his work with Merce Cunningham and folks. \n\nAll in all, I liked the museum.

Since my aunt had asked to check it for a wedding party in the summer. Figured hey its free and I can walk through the museum, look at things, and check out the place to see if it would work for my aunt.\nFirst of all there are only a few areas for the general public to visit, which is basically the second floor. And there are no signs pointing to where people are allowed to go. \nWhen we arrived on the second floor we started looking at this painting when  this old woman, who did not identify herself as an employee but I later found out her name is Rebecca,started to tell me to put my purse to the side. I ignored her because I thought she was just some loony wanting to chit chat, mostly because she was standing right next to me and she was baciscally whipsering. I mean personal space man! Then she became agaited and told my sister the same thing. As my sister walked away she asked my sister if she wanted to get kicked out. How rude!! Speak  up if you want people to listen to you!\nWe complied but she kept following us throughout the second floor telling us to put our purses to the side or not to stand to close to the painting. It was creepy!\nThe annoying employee, Rebecca, also thought it was necessary to mention that we were on camera before we left to look at the other exhibits. I mean come on it's a museum of course there are cameras. I felt like a criminal. \nThe paintings and sculptures are interesting but I'm not sure it's worth encountering Rebecca again.

The de Young is crowded, very family unfriendly and expensive. The Palace is just hard-to-get-to with lots of big name artists but crummier examples of their work.\n\nOur experience at the de Young recently was one of the worst I have ever had. We bought tickets at Costco for the Birth of Impressionism show and did not realize that strollers are not permitted inside the exhibition. With a 26 pound 2-year old, there was no way to enjoy anything in a set of galleries stuffed full of people, most of them in wheelchairs.\n\nJust when we thought things could not get worse, the guards in the galleries told us we could not place the 2-year-old on our shoulders (possibly the only way to actually see any paintings). They were quite sharp with us and claimed their lawyers would not permit such a dangerous perch for her. It was awful. What we could see of the paintings was not all that impressive or well displayed. It was dark and crowded and hot. Like a bomb shelter. Not a museum.\n\nSo to sum up: Don't come here. Don't ever come here with kids and especially, don't come to one of their splashier exhibitions. There are better museums in SF. The SFMoMA is pretty good. You CAN use a stroller there.

There were plenty of facts outlined around the exhibit; from the lineage of King Tut, to the small paragraphs of facts that described each item within the casings.\n\nMy only critique would be that some of the rooms were rather vast and encompassed plenty of space.  Space for more stuff that is!! I mean, I don't know the details about where everything else is from his tomb, but seriously.  For example, one of the casings would read, \"Here lies one of four canopic jars that housed King Tut's internal organs after mummification.  This one most likely held his intestines.\"  And in my mind I'm thinking....\"umm...excuse me....where the hell are the other THREE?!\"  Or another casing would say, \"This is one shakti (miniature figurines displaying a spirit or god that will do labor for the pharaoh in the after life) found within King Tut's tomb.  This was one of literally hundreds found within the tomb.\"  And here's me.....\"Ok, seriously? You have the nerve to say hundreds, yet you can't even give us maybe even just 5 more??!\"\n\nI'm just saying.\n\nAnd I know it's a lot to ask....ok, maybe too much.  But I must say I was just a tad bit disappointed that King Tut wasn't actually there.  Yes, you read that right.  I wanted THE sarcophagus of King Tut there....and the actual mummy wouldn't have been bad either.  ;-D\n\nBut, the exhibit did have a great video and projection image that displayed the many layers of coffins and encasings it took to bury King Tut.\n\nGrowing up, I was a huge fan of Egyptian history.  And this exhibit definitely brought me back to those days when my eyes would light up as we entered the Egyptian history chapters of our textbook.  Just to even see a few of his real life belongings, and the pure gold jewelry he used to adore....simply amazing.\n\nWhat a life of glamour and wealth, eh?\n\nSeriously.  Go check it yourself.\n\nI was very pleased that our tickets included admission to the deYoung itself and our visit wouldn't be given justice without mentioning the amazing amazing amazing chocolate creme brulee and apple crisp at the deYoung cafe!!  Yum.  Skip the brownies and chips.  Go towards the glass casings under the registers.  That's where they keep the good stuff.\n\nAfter indulging ourselves, my friend and I checked out the African and Oceanic art exhibits.  My anthropologic fix was satisfied, as we took in hundreds of crazy and unique masks.  Can we just say how obsessed these people are about the phallus in their art? Haha! It was definitely such a great way to confirm some of my anthropology studies back in college about sex, gender, and culture of south east pacific island communities.  Another weird thing about some of the masks we saw was that there were some masks that had skulls.  Yes, human skulls.  Crazy!\n\nLastly....the observation deck simply took my breathe away.

They have a huge collection with something for everyone's taste.  There are beautiful landscapes upstairs, including one of my Grandpa's favorites, Thomas Moran.  There are the cultural arts, with artifacts from the Americas and New Guinea, Oceanic Art, too.  And you want to talk about glass check out the section of Contemporary Craft. There is a Chihuly from his Venetian series done in collaboration with glass master  Lino Tagliapietra, and a cool piece by Toots Zinsky.  Even the building itself is a work of art.\n\nThere is a lot to see, but not so much that you can't do it in one day.  And if you are going for just a quick jaunt, but haven't gotten enough of an art fix, your DeYoung ticket will get you into the Legion of Honor for free on the same day.\n\nThere is ample underground parking, but if you want to stay green the N-Judah light rail line will drop you at 8th and Judah, which is about a 10 to 15 minute walk to GG Park, through the botanical gardens, to the DeYoung.  So don't miss this Museum even if you are a peninsula dweller like me.  Take CalTrain to the light rail, buy the $1.50 ticket, pretend you are in Paris, and take in some art!", "author": "Karly L."}

The architecture of the DeYoung is everything you could want in a museum: futuristic yet natural.  Plus there's the signature tower, with a great view (though nothing to rival Twin Peaks).\n\nWhat I really love about the museum is its breadth.  In addition to an extensive collection of American art ranging from the 19th to the 21st century, it also holds no less than 3 indigenous art exhibits: the Americas, Africa, and Oceania.  I'm sure Marshall McLuhan would agree that it's a great design for today's increasingly integral world.\n\nAlso, I've been to the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and I'll put the contemporary art here up against that stuff any day.  A great philosopher once said, \"The problem with being avant-garde is knowing who's putting on who\".  And while it's easy to take potshots at modern art, I really felt the exhibits in Paris were simply daring you to reject them as meaningless, whereas the works here really speak for themselves, while still being mind-bogglingly original.", "author": "Wes M."}

It is not the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  I hear countless complaints about the de Young's shortfalls and I think that they are unfair.  The de Young is a great museum, with innovative design, and a great amalgamation of interesting art that should be observed and enjoyed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-11-27", "description": "It's hard to live up to hype, fanfare and flash -- forces of publicity that seemed almost antithetical to the de Young way of olde.  But that's just why in some ways the \"new\" de Young wins me over, and why in some fewer ways it falls flat on its face.\n\nThe exhibits:  mostly magnificent, almost rogue in selection by comparison to what the de Young used to be known for.  November 2006, for instance:  Ruth Asawa, Ed Ruscha, the Quilts of Gee's Bend (which drew crowds in almost club-like density).  Then an engaging permanent (but still hungry for broader representation in certain regions) collection of works from the Americas and Africa.  By strict convention, the museum's exhibits are usually 50% craft/artifact, 50% art.  \n\nWith its quality of exhibits, the de Young has quickly captivated a wide range of patronage in its rebirth.  But, just as easily -- too easily, it almost always leaves me wishing for just a bit more, as if the exhibitions are incomplete.\n\nIn a connector gallery displaying a small and unconventional collection of \"portrait photography\" they exhibit Warhol, Avedon, Arbus (OK, portraiture by a stretch), heck even Radcliffe Bailey.  But not a single Mapplethorpe portrait.  They waste wall space on Karl Lagerfeld, but they overlook Mapplethorpe.  Hell, an Anton Corbijn photo would have been infinitely more relevant and valuable to this exhibit than a freakin' Lagerfeld puff piece.\n\nNext door in the African art collection, they have a stunning collection of tribal masks.  I mean wonderful and broad in representation.  But not one single piece representing the Songye people.\n\nThe Gee's Bend exhibit was so wildly popular, they extended it for almost 3 months, but what was clearly the biggest attraction at the museum this season was crammed in a claustrophobic corner gallery.  The quilts deserved a better space.\n\nAll told, I'm not at all impressed by the museum interior and gallery layouts.  Most feel like enclosures, some are downright crammed, and all too often works are displayed with the same significance as merchandise at an Old Navy or EQ3 furniture store.  Compare it with how the Asian Art Museum in SF lights and displays their works and you'll know what I mean.\n\nPerhaps the single most annoying element of the whole place:  the security collective that behave like the fucking gestapo.  Yes, I appreciate that they take their job seriously, but Jeezus H., someone  teach them the simple fact that politeness and compliance are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThere are a few things about the overall museum design that do stand out remarkably to me.  The dimpled fascia of the building doesn't move me as much as the huuuuuge Richter photo-mosaic in the main interior plaza that was probably commissioned to mirror that building's feature.  Then there's the sitting room adjacent to the American painters gallery overlooking the sculpture garden -- a wonderful piece of space.  Best in show:  the Andy Goldsworthy stone work outside the main entrance of the museum, in which one continuous crack works through the tiles and boulders scattered in the entry atrium -- so subtle and fantastic that most people will never even notice it.", "author": "Alfonso E."}

It took me way too long to make it out to the De Young - a shame since it's so close to my home.  I'm SO glad I finally made it out.\n\nI read an article about the museum in San Francisco Magazine describing the building arcitecture - apparently it's supposed to resemble the canopy of the Park.  Very cool.   \n\nAs a student, tickets were only $6.  If you show them a muni transfer ticket or bus pass, you get another $2 off your ticket.  So, I went to a great museum today and only paid $4.  What a deal.\n\nI don't know if it was the exhibits or the architecture or that its situated in Golden Gate Park, but I liked the museum a lot.  The featured exhibits were very cool (i know they change, so I won't go into them).  The other permanent exhibits were good too.  \n\nI sometimes feel like MOMA is a little too avant garde for me.  The De Young was a good compromise for my art tastes.  \n\nThere are great views of the western side of the city from the observation deck.  I imagine on weekends it gets pretty crowded up there (I went on a Wednesday afternoon and I thought there were just enough people - bordering on too many).\n\nI also went to the cafe and enjoyed a snack and glass of wine.

We went on a Wednesday because the tickets are cheaper if you go after 5 (score!).  We waited in a line, to go into a room, to watch a movie narrated by Omar Shariff, and then the doors magically open to a statue of the boy king with a spotlight over him and the inevitable \"OOOOHHH\" and \"AAAHHH\" from the crowd.\n\nUnfortunately, that was the only \"ooH\" ing and \"ahh\"-ing done for the next 45 minutes or so.\n\nWe cramped ourselves into a series of galleries of egyptian artifacts: mirrors, cosmetic boxes, tomb trinkets and the like.  We even went into a room that had a huge sarcophagus of a mummy that was Tjuya (Or something).  We kept thinking, THIS IS A SIGN WE ARE CLOSER TO HIM!!\n\n\"HIM\" turned out not to be one of tut's coffins, but instead a tiny little baby tut coffin that held his liver.  YES, that is what is on all the posters.  It looks remarkably like the inner coffin, but it's not so don't expect to see that there.\n\nWe were baffled when we noticed the exhibit was over and we were nearly in a gift shop.

Although the building is rather hideous from afar, it's quite attractive up close.  It's often compared to the Tate Modern in London (another Herzog & de Meuron project), which is unfortunate, because they are such different animals.  Whereas the Tate Modern got its imposing scale as a remodel of an old power plant, the DeYoung's scale is totally contrived (and poorly contrived at that).  If someone forced me to choose one of these over the other, I'm afraid the Tate would win.  But whereas the Tate's galleries are generally very plain, the DeYoung is filled with fun corners and strange nooks.\r\n\r\nAs for the DeYoung collection, I think that San Francisco has to be quite proud.  It's eclectic almost to the point of schizophrenia -- which sounds just about right for San Francisco!

A miss match or as the kids call it a mash-up of art.  Pop art next to japanese simplistic next modern next to who knows.  Inept.  That is all i can say.  Throughout the musuem there seems to be less then perfect flow.  I see very little effort to stay within some kind of a theme.  This is what happens when you allow credentials to dictate your hiring and choices in art.  Goldsworthy?  He did the front crack down the sidewalk???  Oh please.  This not what he does.  His art is enjoyed in photos before it disolves back to nature.  He laughed all the way to the bank.  Goldsworthy's work is in the similar vein to the Quetzalcoatl in San Jose by the late Robert Graham's Frankly or as I like to call it \"poop in the park\" ... I am sure as his staff cracked the sidewalk they were snickering at the art establishment.  \n\nFurthermore, I am a big fan of Ikebana.  However the flower exhibit is absolutely hilarious.  Current to spring 2011.  There are some wonderful flower exhibits that are mauled by absolutely horrid work.  One word for you: EDIT.

But I'm not really one of those \"on a mission\" people when it comes to museums.  I like to stop and read shit.  So, after like an hour (or two) of standing and walking around a museum my leggies get achey.  Toss in multiple stairs and friends going off in different directions and it's tiring. \n\nI would recommend the museum yes, definitely.  Really nice exhibits and informative reading materials.

The first Tuesday of every month is a great reason to check this location out each month--FREE MUSEUM DAY!\n\nThis is for the King Tut exhibit.  1 Star.\n\nI went with some family from out of town and was completely underwhelmed.  The crowds are unbearable the first few rooms.  The artifacts are nothing special.  You don't get any actual Tut items until you reach the final room.

The exhibit encompasses a chronology of garments from the House of YSL, starting in 1962. \n\nAs the successor to Christian Dior, YSL imposed his own style, which is evident in all garments exuding utmost feminity, power, class, and elegance. Each piece albiet simple or complex, was definitely crafted with much attention and creative thought. I was utterly amazed at the construction and intricate details of each suit, gown, or coat. More importantly, the articulation and silhouette between the human body and the garment is simply beautiful...which I'm sure is the YSL aesthetic.\n\nMost of his iconic pieces where inspired by artists such as Mondrian, Warhol, and Matisse.

The colors and textures say exactly that. The layout of the place is also very confusing. We had NO idea which way to go, or whether we'd already seen whatever was around the corner or down the blind alley in front of us. \n\nAlso the arrangement of the collection seems to be more about honoring donors and benefactors than about making a coherent statement about the relationship of one era or art form or region to another. There are no transitions, and the jump cuts make no sense.\n\nOn the positive side we saw an astonishing photo show (by Hiroshi Sugimoto) that was beautifully arranged and lit -- quite easily the best photo show I've ever seen, period. So they do know HOW to run  a museum if their dons would just give them a little slack.\n\nOn the negative side, the cafe was cold, impersonal (which is actually one of the central qualities of the whole joint), badly organized, confusing, and way way substandard for a culinary destination like San Francisco. \n\nI'm not arguing for way expensive or overly chi-chi cuisine, but would it be too much to ask for decent interesting food offered in a logical enough manner that native speakers could figure it out and feel their money was well spent?

Well, then you learn the whole museum is set up that way, from the broken line running from the curb to the door, from the reverberating atom displayed on the wall.  It's all about shift.  \n\nYou can learn this as I did by taking an official tour from a docent who is found in the Wilsey Court and apparently on the 2nd floor as well.  The docent who led us was named, Michelle, I believe, and she was absolutely terrific in taking us through the museum's first floor.  She was so warm yet whipsmart, I wanted to invite her over for dinner.  She had an awesome task of taking us through the Contemporary American/Western displays and explaining the history of the museum to us, a rag tag group of tourists, art aficionados, artists and clueless wanderers which she did flawlessly.  \n\nYou learn a lot on this tour and it inspired us onward after.  My mother, an observer of abstract who says \"What the hell is THAT? You brought that stuff home in the 1st grade\" was satiated though she still sniped \" ok maybe I see the boat, I see a parrot but everything else is a mess\"  \n\nThe space itself is the furthest thing from a mess.  The mess hall, the cafeteria is just that, not a simple, polite cafe. The food is surprisingly good, the service friendly and efficient. On a sunny day you can sit outside, enjoy the outside art (The Paperclip!!!) and eat, so art for the peoplesque.  \n\nRumor has it, Herzog and deMeuron have hired one of SF best architects to lead their next project, a museum in Napa.  The Bay Area holds its breath... but until then we have hours and hours to enjoy this jewel in our midst.  \n\nGo today and go early to avoid the line to the 7 degree turning tower with the great view.

There are many surprisingly disquieting pieces of modern sculpture. The building itself is intriguing, with all the weird angles and strategically placed windows and rusty looking metal.

Did they have cameras in the 16th century?!\"  Sugimoto also has  a mesmerizing photo series of different oceans and seas around the world. Yeah, they all look pretty much the same, but still there's something hypnotic about looking at oceans. I also loved his photos of thousands of Buddha statues called \"Sea of Buddha.\"  Finally, math geeks will love his elegant series of \"mathematical models\" -- 3-D sculptural versions of  trigonometric functions.

The audio does add a bit, but not much, to the overall experience. \nAs for the other parts of the museum - I didn't look too thoroughly.

Well laid out and presentation signage was clear.  The choices of artifacts nicely inter-related to the size and shapes of Egyptian architectural proportions and room sizes.  The flow presented the artifacts in a chronological order giving audiences and the crowds well handed visibility.  There was nice places to rest and relax and you got a formal presentation of discovery with history.  Well worth the money to see items used by a young boy King, but not only that, you get a feeling of what it was like in those times.\nFor those that need the sensationalism of Tut's mask present, it's in Cairo and never leaving there again.  This happened because so dork damaged it when moving it on a previous tour.   Personally I would think it's a smart move on Egypt's behalf, besides I don't see the United States let the Constitution, signed copy of the Declaration of Independence or for that matter Betsy Ross' flag go abroad.   If you have a problem with that, go see your mummy.\nSpeaking of mummy: the gift shop.

I wasn't too excited about it, but it was a nice sculpture (my boyfriend took a greater interest than I did). \n\n- Yves St. Laurent: I thought the idea of fashion in a museum was silly at first, but I was so impressed with how many pieces from history at the exhibit. This exhibit certainly changed my perception about fashion that it could be an art form. One of the pieces I remember was a tribute to Van Gogh. He beautifully translated Van Gogh's painting to a dress and something so wearable. I was amazed. Each piece was like a painting in itself. This exhibit was probably the most crowded in the whole museum.\n\n- Asian/American/Modern Art: \"Shifting Currents:\" as an Asian American, I was pretty disappointment with this exhibit. I thought they missed the whole concept of being an Asian American or the process of discovering their identity. Most pieces were either very Asian or very American. Few represented the two concepts as one entity. Perhaps it is a new idea from this generation. I do appreciate the pieces from the Japanese internment camps as there are few photographs to capture their persecution. Their paintings reflected what happened externally in the camp as well as what the Japanese experienced internally. \n\nI am always delighted to go to MOMA. \nThey also have an awesome gift shop that adds another hour to my visit. :)", "author": "Lori L."}

Please do so.

The little theatre by the museum shop was showing a 'making-of' movie showing the amazing creation of Chihuly artwork. It was hard to find a seat and space, more so after the \"look at me, how pedantic I am in my Segway\" lady went in. Standing by the door, we see this video with a lot of people cheering in an industrial dome backed by the horrible music of something similar to \"My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult\". In a very tactful way (for the kids, I'm sure), the close-captioning was turned on displaying the lyrics of a highly sexual song. Kids, now you can go back to your 1st grade class and tell the teacher what a 'sexy kisser' you are!\n\nIn the video, we see this muscled up, dark, long white hair, 80s Meatloaf video-style man (call him \"Glass God\") working the glass. Sweaty and working hard in front of a furnace, it will make women and men swoon alike and break all boundaries of straightness. This man enlists the help of other dudes to carefully mold the glass, move it around and make it a \"WOW, THAT'S DAMN GOOD TALENT\" piece. One problem...NONE OF THESE GUYS ARE CHIHULY!!!!!!\n\nWhile all this hot action is going on and the Kill Kult clones' bass is throbbing, Captain Lou Albano is sitting on a desk AWAY from the furnace. That's Chihuly! He doesn't do anything! He sits there in a Tony Bahama (or imitation) hideous shirt and scribbles on a pad with pencils held together by a rubberband. Wow, what a gimmick, I need one like that. At the same time Chihuly is doodling with the skill of a 3 year old on an Etch-a-Sketch and possibly stuffing his face with Twinkies from one of his 'signature' bowls, his interns (i suspect) and what we call \"Glass God\" are really busting their asses and then showing him the finished work. \n\nIt is to note at this moment, that Chihuly wears an eye patch. However, this is not because a piece of glass flew through it or was anything related to his art. Supposedly, this accident messed up his depth perception. I must wonder if he then really knows how the bowls look like...hmmm..\n\nAfter \"Glass God\", a.k.a \"The Real Talent Here\", is done and shows the piece, Capt. Lou Chihuly gives a thumbs up and people in the Thunderdome cheer! I mean, they go all out like they saw Gene Simmons spit fire during \"God of Thunder\". This is pompous and ridiculous.\n\n\nOh, what have you, my kitten just did a chaotic piece of art in the floor:\n\"Untitled Friskies 1: My Volatile Existence\"\nLet me call DeYoung, someone has to see this!\n\n2 Stars because overall I like the DeYoung museum and some of their collection (in a vacuum, away from the rude visitors) and is one of the cleanest places in the city.\n\n:::: END OF WARNING :::::\nINTELLECTUALITOS AND SNOBS, YOU WERE WARNED\n:::: END OF WARNING :::::", "author": "Jesus G."}

When I first came on member preview weekend last October to the new de Young, I felt pretty ambiguous about it. The non-contiguous galleries weren't easy to navigate, the Oceanic/African art was unsettlingly displayed, and the site-specific installations that I'd gotten so excited about (Andy Goldsworthy, wow!) were just okay. Now that I've been back several times, I appreciate the small galleries. I can come to see a blockbuster exhibit and pair it with one of the permanent galleries, or just come by to see the textiles and furniture and call it a day, guilt-free.\n\nThe collections here are sort of schizo (erm, eclectic?) But that's all well and fine with me, because it means I get a little of everything. Of particular note is the photography gallery.\n\nAs for the African/Oceanic collections... this is tough. A museum that's as old as the de Young, that dates back to when it was a-okay to drop into another country and buy up antiquities to put behind glass - how do you deal with a legacy like that? I don't agree with the way that the de Young has chosen to display these works, backlighting and dimlighting them (though this may be for conservation purposes, I don't know) and giving them this haunting, primitive quality. But on the other hand, what solutions are there, really? Dioramas and such \"living history\" displays can be equally demeaning. I only hope that the curators at the de Young will continue to think about how this work is shown.\n\nThat said, two things that are unquestionably cool at the de Young -- the Bouquets to Art event every March, when local florists & ichibana artists create works inspired by the art, and the Connections Gallery, where contemporary artists respond to art in the permanent collections or the rotating shows.", "author": "Marisa L."}

I was really excited to see the \"Birth of Impressionism\" exhibit yesterday as one of the highlights of my summer stay-cation. \n\nFirst of all, I called to find out the cost of tickets the night before.  I was told that it was \"free\", as part of the first Tuesday of the month is free day - great, I hadn't purposely planned to take advantage of their free day, but free is better than $25 / person.  \n\nYesterday: after driving around in the parking lot for 15 minutes - apparently everyone else must have had the same idea - we arrived in the very loud and crowded lobby of the museum.  We bought tickets (discounted to $15 / person, as part of the free day benefits, I guess) for the next available time, which was an hour away.  Then, we saw the line ups.  It looked like about an hour in the first line, which was in the main lobby.  This brought you downstairs to the second line up, which I would guess took another 45 minutes to get into the actual exhibit.  We decided we did not want to spend the majority of our time in the city, in a noisy line up.  On trying to return our tickets, we were told they were nonrefundable.  Luckily, we caught a couple just about to buy tickets for the next available time (almost 2 hours away), and they were happy to buy our tickets for the earlier time we had purchased.  \n\nAll in all, I have enjoyed visiting the De Young Museum in the past - it is an impressive building in a beautiful location.  The collections are well worth taking the time to explore.  \n\nNEVER GO ON FREE DAY, unless you love a noisy, large crowd.  The staff all seem grumpy, and not happy to offer any kind of assistance - I experienced this both on the phone and in person.  \n\nI really want to see this exhibit, but not sure if it is worth another attempt.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-11", "description": "King Tut Review:\n\nI came to the De Young to check out the King Tut Exhibition, something I've been waiting to see for many years! Having heard that the De Young has some of the \"treasures\" from Tutankhamun's tomb, I went nutty and lined up a day to view the exhibition. \n\nSetup:\n\nThe setup is pretty typical for most exhibition dealing with Egyptian artifacts. I liked how they based the exhibition on the family lineage (or said known lineage) of Tutankhamun's family and or rulers prior to his ruling.  So another words you do not start right off looking at his belongings and his tombs artifacts. Instead you travel from the top and slowly make your way into his time of ruling. I thought this was pretty neat but again it is typical in most exhibitions.\n\nArtifacts/Treasures/The Meat:\n\nThe exhibition is nicely laid out so that viewing of items is some what easy, especially for larger groups. However, if there is a good crowd you may find that viewing the items can be a bit hard. My best advice to anyone going to check out any exhibition; be sure to wait 5-10 minutes and be at the end of the group, that way you have no issue viewing items. Nothing like seeing someones head instead of the cool jewelry!\n\nAnyhow, the items were pretty neat and I thought they had a good amount of items from each ruling period. Remember, you will go through a good 3 galleries before reaching the climax of the exhibition, tut's stuff. Before reaching his gallery, you will see some really nice stuff from chairs, a full sarcophagus, and several other items. Really, just enough to get you going and ready for the main event.\n\n\nTutankhamun's display:  \n\nI am personally satisfied with the overall items on display from Tutankhamun's tomb. I honestly did not expect to see too much and I think what was displayed was good enough for me. NO you are not going to see the famous mask, nor his sarcophagus, and neither the mummy himself. If you know Egyptology, you know that the Egyptian Government has put a lock on a lot of Tutankhamun's items (amongst others belongings), and especially those which are extremely fragile. That noted, all these items are fragile but Tutankhamun's items are more or less the most popular.  So I was surprised to see that there were a good 100+ items from his tomb on display. Hey, I am not complaining... I'd rather see a one then none. I am not too sure what people are expecting but to me this was a good enough score to satisfy my crave for Egyptology!\n\nThere are a few galleries within Tutankhamun's main display. Again, each slowly climb up to the actual burial room. His gallery is setup as if you were entering the tomb itself, not visually but the order in which items were found and the rooms they were found in. This is pretty nice since you can get a feel where each item was found and its overall placement in the tomb.\n\nWithout going too much in detail and ruining the overall treasures, I must say this is a great exhibition to visit. You will see just enough items to really appreciate the overall culture, art, and ways of early Egypt. \n\nIt took me a total of about 90 minutes to fully view every items, read its description, and leave the exhibition. Not too bad, it is a bit on the short end but I expected this for the most part. \n\nWant more? an hour drive to the south will put you into the San Jose Egyptian Museum which holds a ton of Egyptian Treasures and Mummy's.", "author": "Jay D."}

My first visit to the De Young was yesterday, and I purposely stayed away from the the site until I knew I was going to walk into the doors to get that full effect. And it didn't disappoint. \n\nWe wound up sneaking in through the side of the cafe, which was a little weird. A bag check later, we were in. The ghetto part of me wanted to just sneak away into the galleries, but I wound up paying like everyone else. Once you're in you get a sticker to wear (remember the foldable pins you had to wear before? That would have been fab!) and you're off and running. \n\nThe galleries were light and airy, and you'll recognize some of the familiar pieces from back in the day (the old De Young), which makes you wonder if they truly rotate the pieces. The special exhibits were wonderful: the Gee Bend Quilts and the Chicano Experience exhibits were lively, but the video media portions were a bit small for my tastes. \n\nThe venue itself is the star here, the copper not quite ready to blend, and the dotted walls invite you to touch them and dig into the divots. The mini atriums were a nice blend of metal and nature, and the flat rocks (shale? who knows) looked more like leaves than rocks. There are some vantage points you should see, like the floor to ceiling window behind the Hudson River painters that overlooks the sculpture garden is worth a check. The benches make you feel like you're in church.\n\nThe tower deserves a lot of time and you could spend a good few minutes alone looking at the big map of San Francisco trying to find your house but not mine, apparently, because the hood doesn't represent! Aiyah! Anyways, great 360 views will take your breath away as well. \n\nThe cafe? Suprisingly good. TIP: go early or go later, but don't go during lunch hour. Crowded as all hell. Tomato basil soup and grilled cheese (I added tomatoes!) was amazingly good and FAST!\n\nDespite a largely positive experience, there was one negative: the staff. They maintain a very heavy presence and I suspect that two of the young men were following us not because I had a camera but because like the many objets d'art, we were to be admired.

I remember seeing the Tut exhibit back in the 70's and we stayed in line for about almost 2 hours. There was a mob of people at the exhibit and it was frustrating for me since I was little and it was hard to see everything.\nThis time they had it organized where people go in certain numbers at a time. We had the 2:00 showing. My mom is a member so we had will call tickets, and a different line to stand in. When we entered the first area it was a darkened room with dim lighting and a big wooden door that led to the exhibit. The spokesman talks about the exhibit and shows you a 90 second movie about King Tut and how Howard Carter found his tomb. Then we entered the exhibit and wander around. The displays are great, with the description in more than one place on the casings so you can read it either close up or farther back from above in larger lettering which is nice. There are some relics that are quite exquisite with the jewels that were worn, the copper coffin and the alabaster jars.\nOne thing you must know is that the big pieces of the exhbit like the main coffin, the mummy and the golden mask are not in the exhibit. That is because, after 3000 years they are now too delicate to travel. I'm glad I got to see that in the 70's! \nThey do show them on video screens throughout the exhibit. They even have the one rectangular slab that shows the mummy in it's tomb, and effectively show what pieces were in the tomb with the mummy. Very interesting. They have a video that shows the 5 layers within the tomb before you get to the actual mummy. \nThe gift shop was great, with some unique stuff and fabulous jewelry. I got a couple of things there. Now I wish I had gotten the calendar!\nThe cafeteria is indoor outdoor. That day it was member appreciation time and they had a $12 lunch deal which is a turkey sandwhich, a cup of soup, salad and a nice little custard desert. Drink is not on that special. I had a beer. Mom had diet cola. They also had a member appreciation reception with free beverages and appetizers in another room.\nThere's more: The newly rennovated museum now has an elevator that takes you to the tower where you can see the whole park and the city. I am not sure if you can go on Friday night, but it's worth a shot.\nThere are twilight tours on Friday evenings which is nice. There is a free shuttle service that takes you around the park so you don't have to walk or drive everywhere. There are muni lines as well. The 44 line is just outside going towards inner sunset, and accross at the Steinhardt Aquarium the 44 goes to 6th and California. We took that bus to the California Stop and took the 1 California. It worked out okay for us since we didn't have to wait long for the buses. It would be hell to park and expensive for a cab. \nGo early on the weekends because there are a lot of people.

A King Tut exhibit with no King Tut just bad advertising.  I realize that the Egyptian government doesn't want any of the sarcophagi or death mask traveling, but include that fact in the exhibit itself.  The video that National Explorer put together animating the various tombs that covered the final sarcophagus was too fast as ultimately useless.\n\nIf the real thing can't travel, I see nothing wrong in making replicas that people and kids can touch.  On some level I would prefer it.\n\nThe rest of the museum seemed randomly thrown together.  While there were a couple of exhibit areas that were organized by geography, most were just all mixed together in a mishmash of random artwork.\n\nThen there is the staff and their stupid policies.  You can bring your backpack in, but you have to carry it as your side.  What purpose does this serve?  It doesn't make it any less likely that you are going to knock other people or exhibits, it does just the opposite, it makes you more unwieldy and awkward.  I have never been to another museum that requires this, not even the Louvre. \n\nThe staff is rude and they can't keep their story straight.

In honor of my milestone it's time for an update of the DeYoung museum review.\n\nI love this museum!  Truth in advertising requires I admit my skepticism of the design when first revealed.  In manifestation this is a beautiful museum.  The galleries are well portioned, appropriately flexible and flow well one to the next.  My only big beef with the overall design is a lack of planning for the huge crowds drawn by the fantastic exhibits.  The entry doesn't allow for an easy flow in/out when it's busy.  That said this little frustration disappears once inside.\n\nWe have seen several major traveling exhibits here.  Tut and the French Impressionists stand out for us.  These events brought stunning priceless and famous works to our view.  We saw Tut three times finding new and fascinating things each time.  The French Impressionist exhibits have just floored me.  Like so many I had seen for years photos of Blue Boy, Whistler's Mother, Starry Night and a host of other famous paintings.  The opportunity to see them so intimately was an incredible joy.  Photos never do paintings justice.  Brush strokes invoking sense of movement and the sense of light are so often lost in transference.  Seeing them so close was a privilege I'll treasure forever.  All the major traveling exhibits have been housed in the lower level galleries.   Aside from the cattle chute entry, each exhibit has been unique in gallery design, flow and feel.  I've forgotten each time I was in the same space.  \n\nI once enjoyed a delightful dinner with Nancy Hamon.  She is the wonderful soul who funded the tower now bearing she and her husbands name.  Because of her gift admission to the tower is free in perpetuity. The observation floor is amazing.  Its vantage point as one of the tallest structures on the west side of the city affords 360 degree spectacular vistas.  Many thanks Nancy! \n\nThe DeYoung is one of SF's greatest treasures.

To some it is a hideous piece of metal attempting to be overly modern.  But to others (such as much self) it is a beautiful work of art that is on par with many of the fantastic pieces that frequent the building.  \n\nWhat many have to realize is that the copper plating on the surface has a purpose.  Over time as the copper reacts with the air (mostly with the sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) it will oxidize to form a blueish-green coating over the surface.  Decades from now (it's a slow process) the entire building will blur into the surroundings, making it look as-if it has literally grown out of the ground.  \n\nThis effect is further influenced by the spiral tower protruding from the East-side of the building, in a way resembling a spruce tree that twists as it grows.  And as Ashton mentioned below, is an engineering marvel on it's own.   Be sure to take the elevator to the top so that you can enjoy the view from above.\n\nThe overhang that sticks out to cover the cafe is nothing short of breath taking.  It may look trivial from the distance, but once you are standing right under it and gaze upwards, you start to feel the collosal impact it delivers.\n\nAs you walk in you pass through a hallway which has the names of all the contributors set behind a glass plate.  Perserving their names for the life of the building.  What may look like a structural defect, the floor has a large crack that runs through the large stones.  An interesting concept that is well understood to San Franciscans.\n\nThe middle of the building has a garden that is visible from virtually any part of the museum.  A beautiful touch.  Beyond that the rest of the interior begins to lack in style and design.   Navigating around it becomes confusing, even to repeat visitors.  The walls are bare and some of the spaces oddly shaped, for no apparent reason (not even if you are taking into consideration the exterior's shape).

I was very very impressed with both the museum and the exhibit.\n\nDale Chihuly's glass installations were absolutely amazing.  Shapes, colors and arrangements were all incredible.  I'm sorely tempted to describe my favorites, but I'll just hold my tongue and let you figure what my top 3 would be.  If you have not made a visit yet, I highly recommend checking it out before it goes away at the end of September.\n\nThe permanent collection at the museum has some great sections and pieces as well.  I probably sped through about half of it after my 30 minute Chihuly viewing so I'll need to make another trip to take in the rest.  \n\nI took my parents who were in town visiting so we made a point to go to the top of the tower.  From below it doesn't seem all that high, but it was pretty cool, even if you've lived in SF for a long time.  Its a great view and great perspective of the city.  You can pretty much see every building in the Richmond and Presidio.  I would definitely recommend the tower if you're visiting or have out-of-town guests.\n\nTry to see the Chilhuly exhibit on a weekday or I would suggest buying an advance ticket.  I went on a Thursday @ 2:00 and it was crowded, but very manageable.  Combined with a nice stroll around the park, it was a great day.", "author": "Zach J."}

Thanks to modern day CT scanners, we now know he had a several fractures including one above the left knee acquired 2 days before his death.  The cause of death is speculative but may have been due to an infection from that fracture.\nThe museum hosted several gala events for members for this exhibition before the official opening tomorrow, Saturday.  The Wednesday nite event was attended by many city celebrities and deep pocket donors.  Thursday evening's gala was for contributing members willing to fork out an additional $35/pair for a buffet in addition to the cost of the tickets.   \n\nWe were led downstairs to the exhibit where digitalized photos with captions of the 1920's discovery and treasures hang on the wall.  You enter a darkened room much like the one at Disneyland's Haunted Mansion and watch a short video and then the doors automatically open and the tour begins.  I like to read and look at every item and it takes me longer than most folks when going thru an exhibit. \nThere are so many things to admire and they saved the best for last. Gold necklaces, crown, dagger and a CT image of the King within the coffin in the last room.  The painted wooden bust of the boy king when he ascended to the throne at age 9, is still vivid with color, just as if it was made yesterday, so well preserved.  \n\nThe end of the exhibit leads you into the bookstore with books, jewelry, posters, t-shirts, postcards, magnets, and all sorts of memorabilia related to the exhibit.  It's been 30 yrs since the exhibit last came to SF in the 1970's and it may never return again. There are new items not seen before of many of the King's relatives.  There's even a kiosk outside the bookstore where you can print your own cartouche (converting your name) for $1.00.  \n\nAfterwards, we were back in the lobby level enjoying the ample buffet of fried chicken breast pieces, couscous, vegetables, lox and capers, pita bread, meatballs in tomato sauce,  dolmas stuffed with rice, etc.  There were at least 3-4 tables of the same foods in the lobby and another room with the same spread and a band playing old time music.  A room near the bookstore was filled with desserts - fruit, cookies, baklava, little tea cups with lemon, butterscotch or chocolate pot o'cream.  Unlimited wine, beer, soda, sparkling water, green apple martinis and some blue drink (like blue toilet water) were were available. Folks were dressed in suits, some jeans (invitation indicated \"business casual\"), black dresses and some party dresses, pants, etc.  A couple of dancers dressed in Egyptian-type clothing were dancing about from room-to-room.

I'll admit, I was a little reluctant only because I've been to the De Young and seen how it looks and I was skeptical that they had what it takes to put on a really wonderful special exhibit. Still, I've never seen Andy Warhol's work up close, plus I got FREE ADMISSION through Bank of America's first weekend of the month free museum pass with BofA card program, so I hopped on the Muni and checked it out.\n\nMy main beef with the museum is that the layout and organization seems scattered and random at times. Turn to your left and you'll see an Aztec stela, and turn to your right and you can see some delightful blow glass in the shape of a fruit dish! Something about that pairing just doesn't seem right...\nI was, however, completely wrong about the special exhibit. What I witnessed was truly worthy of (and I'm going to be a total SoCal snob here) the LACMA. Not just prints and photos, this truly was an total sensory experience. As you walk through the exhibit you can listen to the music Warhol's favorite musicians pumped in through speaker, look at actual furniture from his \"Factory\", lie down on a psychedelic round sofa with plush pillows and look at a light show, and watch creepy videos of Lou Reed staring at you unblinkingly. A great exhibit and one you should check out if you're in the area.\n\nSo really: 3.5 stars for the De Young, and 5 stars for the Warhol exhibit.

I have never been to the Old De Young so no comparison at all.\n\nAt the first sight, the museum itself was so modern and different as I could tell.  When getting closer, I noticed it was Copper!   Always amazed by copper and its rustic shine but had never imagined a museum made of copper.  A big contrast is sculptures and decorations of fine details next to it, such as French vine sculpture.  There are also many trees surrounding the museum and they seem to be trimmed to unusual shapes to go with the place.  \n\nA surprise from Bf was to bring me to the top of the tall tower as soon as we got inside.  We had a great view of Golden Gate Bridge and SF city and of course the museum area and Legion of Honor.\n\nInside were different exhibition rooms for American, African and Oceania arts.  Bf's most favorite was the room with murals of early California.  After a tour of their exhibitions, it seemed to me they host quite a big collection of tribal arts.  \n\nWe had lunch in the museum caf. Its design is as modern as the museum, with metal roof, tables and chairs.   We sat outside, bathing in the sunshine and enjoying the great view of the sculpture garden.  The sandwich was good and I still remembered their potato chips with olive oil. \n\nWe have seen many people in the museum, couples, family with kids and tourists.  Wonder whether they would think the same, it's such a museum of creativities in architecture!   Or  creative works are for those who know what creation is about?", "author": "Ile F."}

For day trips it is perfect as you can check out all the fine art and then just stroll over to that California academy of Sciences. As for the museum itself, all the rooms are orderly and arranged in a manner that makes it simple to navigate from one area to the next - you basically walk in one big circle and see everything on each floor respectively. The do get some pretty amazing and notorious exhibits for display, so this is not by any means a run of the mill museum. I'm particularly fond of the more large scale contemporary pieces they have on display. My one regret is not having gone up into the tower they have on site, would have loved to do some HDR work from up top, but well ... maybe next time.

Instead, this place has a hyper mish-mash of everything similar in one room, then, after you are done, ok rush into the next room, and lets smash everything together with no regard if it made sense.\n\nThe one thing I was impressed with was the glass sculpture exhibit, too bad it was in an awkward corner of the museum. On the second floor there was a total waste of space with photographs of people wearing red rain coats. Seriously, what is this? I did not understand any of it, was it supposed to be a recreation of a famous photographer, a social experiment on weirdness? I tried to understand it from reading the material, and I decided I was not going to spend any more time with it.\n\nSadly, the best art in my opinion was the Greek / Roman room, a tinsy itty bitty room with an impressive display of art.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-12", "description": "I've been to the de Yong twice now, once to visit the permanent exhibits and once to check out the recent batch of special exhibits (Asian American Modern Art, YSL, and Maya Lin's exhibit). First, I have to say that the building itself is stunning. I go running regularly in Golden Gate Park and I always make it a point to go by the museum, especially at twilight when it's light up because it truly is an SF architectural gem. I've heard the view from the tower is great too; unfortunately I've only been when it's rainy/cloudy (actually by design, I like to be outdoors when it's nice out) so I haven't ventured up yet.\n\nAs for the exhibits, I'm really impressed by the quality and variety of the collections. I normally go for standard oil paintings, but the de Young's diverse collections (diverse both by region of the world and by medium of art) were a treat. From the permanent collection, the New Guinean sculptures were out of this world, and I can't imagine many other museums around the country having a similar exhibit to this extent - definitely a \"must see\". The African art exhibit was sort of a yawner; I was hoping for something more eye-catching. The exhibit on American paintings up to the 20th century is pretty solid and I especially liked the room dedicated to the Hudson River School of painters. \n\nDownstairs, there is an exhibit on modern American art that seems to rotate, because when I went I couldn't find any Hopper or Diego Rivera paintings, which I was really looking forward to. However, there is this really cool room displaying three sculptures by Al Folsom - each one is a different house of worship (cathedral, synagogue, and mosque) built exclusively out of war-related items (bullets, sub-machine guns, etc.) to highlight religion's connection with war. Conceptually, it's an easy shot at religion and a theme that's been explored ad nauseum, but nonetheless a must-see just for the sheer physicality of the exhibit.\n\nAs for the special exhibits I would HIGHLY recommend the one on Asian American modern art. I had a little trouble coming up with a unifying theme for the whole thing, but some of the paintings are worth the trip alone (my favourites included ones by Yun Gee, Chiura Obata and Chang Dai-Chen). If nothing else it is a good chronicle of the history of Asian-American art in the 20th century, with particular attention to the Bay Area.\n\nThe only downside is that the special exhibits cost an extra $10. Regular admission to the permanent collection is $10 but you can get a student discount with an ID ($6 admission) and a further $2 discount if you have a Muni pass. (Compare to $25 admission and long lines at the neighbouring California Academy of Sciences.)", "author": "Nicolas L."}

My friend saw it about two weeks ago in Barcelona and said they didn't have lots of stuff for sale there. I guess it's an American addition to the exhibit... To be fair, the exhibit was well-laid out and explained lots of stuff, which most people will need to read to know what they are seeing. There is also an audio thingie you can rent that tells you about it all. I've read mixed reviews from other cities about that part. It was nice that they had the explanatory plaques on each side of the boxes holding the art, so many people could read at once. My main quibble comes from the fact that I saw it at L.A.C.M.A. in Los Angeles 29 years ago and it was fabulous -- this time around it had less Tut and more context with stuff from his predecessors. No solid gold mummy mask like before -- WTF! Apparently, Egypt didn't want to loan more than they did -- they want you to go to Cairo to see it all.

First of all they barely have any of the good stuff.  They barely have any exhibits at all, they have like 10 gallery rooms, but what you don't know is there's like only a few  items in each room.  In fact, one of the major pieces (mask) on posters all over town isn't even in the exhibit.  Many of the items aren't even from Tut's tomb.  The two major parts of the show aren't even exhibits, but videos about Tut and a projected image of the famous coffin (that can't travel anymore because of insurance reasons).    It was so cheesy and almost like an amusement ride.  I'm not wondering if it also wasn't just a big advert for National Geographic at the end.

De Young is the only museum hosting YSL's collection in the US. when will you ever get to see the famous Modrian day dress? \n\ncurrent exhibit: Warhol LIVE. $20. ends May 17. silk screens, music recordings, films, photographs inspired by music, the VELVET UNDERGROUND. i will be taking a trip to the bay area to see this. field trip anyone?", "author": "Marilu R."}

We've had memberships at different museums in the city at different times, and I have to say that the deYoung really gives you good \"bang for your buck.\"  Plus, the FAMSF membership also gives you free access to the Legion of Honor, and you don't have to pay extra to see the special exhibits.  \n\nThe special exhibits are always SPECTACULAR.  They are interesting and curated beautifully with fantastic lighting, etc.  I usually get the headsets for the special exhibits as well - it's worth the few extra dollars as the recorded content is always informative, and I prefer listening while looking at the art, rather than reading the little exhibit signs.    \n\nThe permanent collection is a little haphazard, and the flow from one exhibit to the next can be a little funky the way it sometimes jumps  continents and eras, but for the space they have and how they've used it, I've got to give them props.\n\nThe deYoung's outreach to the community is stellar with tons of interesting and FREE stuff offered.  Friday Nites at the DeYoung are a ton of fun.  And they also do concert series with great local acts.   Plus, if you have kids, they offer lots of free Saturday and after school classes and events that bring even the youngest of art lovers into the fold.

It was a big hit with Glo.. She has not been particularly happy here in the Bay Area after moving up from San Diego last year.. but her Bay Area loving son, daughter, and son-in-law.. continue their campaign to make her love it eventually..\n\nAnyway two additional items I'd like to note: \n\n(1.) They have a room of oil portraits by early American artists.. Benjamin West, Charles Wilson Peale, John Singleton Copley.. from the colonial times.. and the neat thing is that these portraits are just hanging on the wall.. not behind glass or set back out of reach. You can gaze at them from afar (meh) or you can get right up next to them.. your face inches from the canvas and observe how they applied their brush strokes to the canvas to try and capture so-and-so's five O'clock shadow.. or so-and-so's gleaming eyes, or so-and-so's delicately formed lips.. and when you get this close and observe so closely, it almost *seems* as if you are actually getting a notion about how those painters must have felt at that instant, applying a little white, just here.. to try to capture that gleam, or shading their subject's lip just so.. almost as if you *are* them.. gazing at their subject's face and trying to capture the elusive detail that will convey who that person is.. And so it is that Charles Wilson Peale.. though long dead.. and perhaps quite accidentally.. managed to sort of capture the likeness of some Naval personality name \"Mordecai Grist\" .. but more than that conveyed *to you* what he was seeing and observing and even feeling at the moment he applied that stroke to the canvas.. over 200 years ago..\n(2.) It is refreshing to listen to the tourists.. especially the foreign tourists.. enjoying the striking views from the observation deck atop the tower.. and asking the employees what was the name of this beautiful park that surrounds them... Yep.. 'Frisco.. whatever its contradictions, whatever its pretense, whatever foolishness and pettiness its residents might often be guilty of is still a very notably beautiful, friendly, and celebratory place to experience. And we are lucky to live so close.\n(3.) If you *are* in the museum, and the munchies strike *really* hard before you're finished with your visit.. the alternative to the 10 - 11 dollar prepackaged sandwiches and salads.. is a vendor's cart just outside the museum at the corner of John F Kennedy Drive..and Tea Garden Way.. Just keep your visitor's sticker on and you can wander in and out of the exhibits or the museum itself as you so desire.\n\n==original review===============\n\nI feel a little like Rip Van Winkle. Wandering up from San Jose.. like I do periodically and coming upon the metal-sheathed *new* de Young after oh decades and decades of being used to seeing the old de Young.. (and the *old* California Academy of Sciences) situated around the concourse and bandshell.. and now everything is different .. or different enough that I wasn't too sure which direction I was walking!\n\nWell, the changes- as radical as they are work well. The building, of course is striking.. memorable.. the outside gardens and sculptures are inviting and playful. The viewing deck atop the tower gives you some wonderous views of the surrounding park and parts of the city beyond. The rooms for the exhibits are much airier and much less cramped than before.. Maybe part of that is just having the Asian Art collection, whose prominence always seemed to dwarf everything else, moved out, across town, in its own building, leaving more room for everything else.. and.. uhm.. high ceilings!! seems to make a difference..Oh  the $10 regular admission fee is quite reasonable these days.. although the *free* parts.. the outside courtyard, sculptures and gardens.. The inside lobby and some exhibition rooms are worth the visit in themselves.\n\nThe one caveat I would throw in.. you *might* want to handle your *hunger* issues before hand.. mebe have a nice picnic or something in the surrounding park before you enter the building. If hunger strikes during your visit.. you will find yourself munching on $6.50 cups of potato salad, $10 pre-packaged sandwiches and lettuce salads, $11!!!! Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches ($2.75 at any Vietnamese sandwich shop in San Jo).. Lunch at the Museum costing more than the ticket itself.", "author": "Weide Z."}

Yes, there is a giant gold mask on all the posters, and, no, there is no such mask anywhere in the exhibit. \n\nBut I honestly find it rather shallow that because that one piece isn't there, everyone seems to be able to write of the exhibit as \"awful\" and a \"letdown.\"\n\nI just think its kind of sad that people can't get past whatever initial disappointment they may feel to see and appreciate what a great exhibit the DeYoung is presenting with their Tut collection. Yeah, none of the iconic pieces usually associated with Tut are there - as people have mentioned, the mummies, sarcophagus, and mask can't leave Cairo. But, clearly, those aren't the only things that Tut had. \n\nThe exhibit is IMMENSE, and full of beautiful artifacts from all facets of Tut's life. When you look at those pieces and recognize that they sat in a tomb for thousands of years, and before that were touched and used by people who lived thousands of miles away - literally, were used and touched by King Tut himself - how can you not appreciate how amazing the exhibit is? \n\nSo get over it - the sarcophagus isn't there. Instead, just enjoy the pieces for what they are, an extraordinary glimpse into Ancient Egypt. Ancient-freaking-Egypt, people.\n\nAnd if you can't appreciate how awesome that is, then honestly I don't feel much sympathy that you didn't enjoy the exhibit. \n\nThat ALL being said, definitely go after 4:30, because otherwise you'll be craning your neck over people crowded around the pieces, or else hearing obnoxious people asking where the sarcophagus is and then grumbling about how the exhibit is a \"sham.\" I heard that at one point while I was in the exhibit.

At least, it does very few favors for the nearby bandshell.

I would have liked to see slightly more European and Asian art, but that's just my own personal taste.  The collection they have is quite impressive, and could easily take up a full afternoon to appreciate it all.

When I lived in the Inner Richmond the museum was being renovated thus the long delay in visiting this forum.  I'm kicking myself for not going sooner.  We chose the time based on the exhibit by Hishiro Sugimoto who is a world renowned photographer and noted Japanese National Treasure.  How one obtains this status is beyond me...\n\nNevertheless, we meandered around the museum through different exhibits while waiting for the docent tour of the exhibition to start.  I have to admit that of the many different salons we observed the least inspiring was the African art.  It seemed out of place with the rest of the exhibits.  I'm no art historian but after recently visiting the Louvre I was very impressed with the collections, the space and the presentation of the works here save for the African art.  \n\nThe highlight of our visit was the trip to the observation deck.  From the 8th floor of this annex to the museum you get an unobstructed view of the Golden Gate Bridge and a panoramic view of San Francisco.  It was breathtaking watching the fog roll in and then turning 90degrees to see the downtown area clear as a bell.  Another thrilling aspect to the observation deck that was the ability to admire the artistic flair with which the botanical gardens surrounding the museum were put together.  From up above, the gardens evoked a spirit of calm and soothing and serenity so much so that I drifted off for a few moments in imagination with these thoughts....\n***\nShe sits on the bench among the array of pristine violet, blue and yellow.

I walk towards her on the pebble laden path lithely plucking one of the floral creations.

The entire concept of a copper You Sunk My Battleship just didn't mesh with the natural, established beauty of Golden Gate Park. It's proportions seemed Kong-like, where only a chimp was required. The monolithic tower's height made trees seem insignificant. There was a new bully on the block, or in the park rather. When construction was complete, there was the copper aircraft carrier in all it's glory. I knew that someday I would be forced to make my peace with \"Rusto.\" Well good news, the de Young and I have kissed and made up. I'm happy to say that the de Young is a marvel of architecture successfully complimenting the collections in a way that MOMA just can't. Where MOMA's architecture directly competes with the exhibits, the de Young partners with it's collections. The rich woods assist displaying most of the art, particularly the African and New Guinea displays. The length of the museum spreads the crowds out more, creating better viewing space. There are varying room sizes too, providing different views and settings for the art. Nice! \n\nThere's so much to see. The 900 plus foot Gerhardt Richter mural that demands to be seen the minute one enters the museum. Joan Mitchell, the female Pollack minus the magnitude of controlled disaster. The Tromp L'Oeil room. Karen Ontes \"Dress 3.\" Imogen Cunningham's photographs. And of course no museum is complete without a hint of Hockney somewhere. The Ruth Asawa collection is fabulous.y stunning!! One starts to look at the copper mesh mobiles believing them to be simple, but then recognizes pre computer graphics designs and shapes. The Osher Sculpture Garden is a great place to take tea, or have a bite.\n\nOne funky thing, there aren't enough signs to assist the public. Two examples, a guard kept running around the Asawa exhibit telling people they couldn't take photos. Signage would have helped. There is no sign telling people the cafe closes at 4:15 sharp, leaving staff frazzled after having explained kabillion times that they're closed. \n\nWell worth the price of admission.

Definitely skip it, see the rest of the museum instead. King Tut ripped me off.", "author": "G G."}

The one thing I liked about this museum was the view from the observation deck.  And yes, I did like the architecture, but I found it to be grossly out of place in Golden Gate Park.  I found the former De Young's architecture to be more in keeping with the beauty of the park.  I couldn't help thinking that this tall structure was like a big middle finger sticking it to the park and surrounding neighborhood.  The cavernous space inside seemed way too big for most of the installations, and finding one's way around was a bit of a challenge.  All in all, I thought the installations were pretty boring.  They pretty much paled in comparison to the real beauty of Golden Gate Park outside.  My biggest gripe with this place, though, was the unbelievable rudeness of the security people or staff or whatever the heck they were.  They made a deal about the stroller, then they made a deal about putting my daughter on my shoulders.  They weren't nice about it, either.  The cashier who gave us a ticket looked like she had been sucking on lemons, and had the sour personality to match.  When did it become fashionable to be rude to customers?  Do they take lessons from all the reality shows on TV now, where the meaner you are, the more people admire you?

Then, once inside, there were separate ticketing lines for members, non-members, will-call, the first of two exhibition staging areas, and audio tours. But they were all in the same lobby, so there was lots of confusion as to which line to get in. That's because there was no one telling you where to go, hardly any signage, and they didn't have any of those soft barriers (i.e., stanchions, like those for airport check-in lines) to control/guide the thongs of people trying to get tickets. And it wasn't until you got close to the ticket desks that you could see a small sign saying the exhibition tickets were already sold out. Also, if you want coat check, you have to take an elevator downstairs and then come back upstairs to access either the permanent collection or the first exhibition staging area. \n\nIf you walked in from the adjacent garage, you would almost immediately find a line for the exhibition, but unfortunately, it is just the second staging area, so you still have to go up to the lobby and join the chaos up there. \n\nWhat they really need to do is install a lot of ticketing windows at the front of the building and where you come in from the garage, install permanent stanchions to control/guide guests, put up more signage (and multi-lingual signage), and add a coat check service in the lobby.", "author": "P B."}

I mean, a painting/installation/sculpture is worth a thousand words, you know?\n\nMuseums themselves are perhaps equally difficult to describe, but let me give it a go, starting from the outside and working my way in:\n\nThe parking garage at the De Young is confusing.  It's easy to find the entrance from Fulton, but easier still to lose your car once you're inside.\n\nThe grove of dead trees out front?  Dead.\n\nThe cracked-stone walkway, and large, bench-like rocks, on your way in?  Sit on the rocks if you need a rest, and contemplate the meaning of the cracks.\n\nOnce inside, things start to look up---and out, and over San Francisco.  Head up to the tower and spend as long as you wish checking out the spectacular (assuming the day is fog-free) 360-degree views of the city; it's also endless fun to look at the Google map on the inner wall, and locate your apartment and the apartments of every one you've ever had a crush on.\n\nBack down in the main museum rooms, the modern art and photography, etc., isn't exactly overwhelming in number.  Or in \"Wow.\"  But it's worth a walk through---as is the cafe, on your way back out into the world to find fresh air and non-museum cafe grub.  And make sure that once you get far enough away from the building, you turn around and pause for a second to appreciate the architecture that is really the De Young's crowning glory (Speaking of crowns, what will happen to that copper siding?

The DeYoung leaves a lot to be desired from the interior, and finding your way around the building is not easy.  \n\nHaving said that, the exterior is really spectacular.  Typical to Herzog & DeMeuron's work, the best part of the builing is the skin.  The perforated and CNC etched copper cladding will patina to a beautiful green over time, it will continue to gain texture and beauty as well as integrate into the surrounding landscape.  The concept is quite opposite of traditional museums which strive for a monumental character.  This building integrates, almost camoflauges, itself into the landscape.  What does this civic building say about our society today?  It sits defensively, poised and ready for an impending attack.  The twisting tower is an engineering feat, and a wonderful opportunity to survey the surrounings.  Without this tower the building would be a strange rusty old piece of metal hiding in the bushes.  The massive cantilevered projection at the Cafe side is equally impressive in terms of engineering.  Wow.  \n\nBut the interior is so stripped down that it's boring and soulless.  The floor in honed stone with the painted walls and ceiling is just not enough.  Even activated with people and artwork the space does not sing.  The detailing is underwrought on the Interior, especially the kiosks and benches.  I am not talking about the detailing of the glazing or skin.  That part is rendered & resolved nicely.\n\nFinding your way around this museum is like navigating the Tokyo subway system (and not knowing kanji).  OK maybe not that bad but compared to the SFMOMA this place is a labrynth.  All the sharp angles are cool and edgy and all but will it stand the test of time?  We'll see.  \n\nThe Entry lobby with its stone paving and boulders strewn about is attempting to be zen I think but it does not come across like this.  It seems empty and unfinished.  The Goldsworthy cracked joints in the pavers leading through the boulders is interesting and reminds me of the seismically active land in which we live.  The 'forbidden' gardens crossing through the interior like a DNA double helix is a nice way to let in natural light and color. The ceilings are cool and edgy with the recessed fluorescent strips that create a rhythmic pattern overhead.  The bathrooms are totally unremarkable.\n\nIf the Architects would have given as much weight of thought to the Interior spaces as they did the shell of the building it would have been a 5 star world class structure for sure!", "author": "ashton c."}

It's pretty pricey, but totally worth it, I think. They do a pretty good job of managing the crowds. You purchase tickets for a specific entrance time, then stand in line and they let you in in groups. It's crowded, but not completely horrible.\nWe arrived about 11am but tickets were sold out until 12:30 so we took the opportunity to look at the permanent collections. I don't really know anything about fine art but there were a few interesting pieces including a model of a Gothic cathedral made completely out of dismantled guns and ammunition. Creepy cool.\nThere was also a large collection of Meso-American art pieces, Mayan and such. I was terribly interested in all of it since the BF and I will be headed to Cancun in a couple weeks. There was even a rubbing from the walls of Chichen Itza! What a cool preview of what we're about to see in real life!\nThe Tut exhibit was AMAZING! I loved every minute of it. For those who complained that there was no sarcophagus or death mask, it was pretty well documented in local newspapers, including SF Weekly, that those will never again leave Egypt and would not be part of the traveling exhibition. So it's not really the museum's fault that you're uninformed.\nBesides the sparkly, glittery pieces there were lots of models, vessels and things that were used in everyday life. Some of my favorites were all the little models of fruits and scrolls that were supposed to become real in the afterlife if needed. One of the most amazing pieces is the golden shrine which is engraved with scenes from the daily life of the king. I think I could spend forever in there just staring at everything.

We ate outside and were treated to the dulcet tones of the Golden Gate Park Band in the nearby unfinished amphitheater area.\nThe outdoor area is really quite lovely and reminded me so much of Paris's gardens and the view of the city from the observation deck is not to be missed. It brought a tear to my eye as I looked out on the vista I know and love so dearly.  I can't wait to watch the copper siding of the building age and oxidize to that glorious green shade that will blend into the landscape so well.\nHere's a tip for avoiding the crowds at admission: go downstairs (where the Chihuly exhibit is currently being held) and purchase your tickets from the desk down there.

However, being that i wasn't alive the last time it came through, it was just something i had to do.  After poring over every detail of the Tut exhibit, I didn't have museum stamina needed to go through the rest of the museum. A person can get museumed out, you know?\nWe didn't have any trouble getting tickets for the first entrance time on Labor Day. Parking was a breeze in the garage, but very expensive. I guess that was kind of the theme of the day. I didn't do my research and was expecting more objects to be from King Tut's tomb itelf, but the objects from the other tombs were no less interesting or fantastic.\nThere were a lot of things that were so right with this exhibit. \nThe short videos playing throughout were great and the perfect length.  The benches were well spaced out, and there was a lot of thought put into the height of the displays, and especially the information panels. It was so convenient to stand back and read the panels up high, then come in from all sides and get a closer look, or stand close and be able to read the same panel right under the object.  Each panel was appropriate in length and size, and was good about reminding you about the family relationships frequently. I even enjoyed the cool darkness of it all, which was probably simply to protect the artifacts, but it gave the whole place an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue.\nI felt bad for the people with kids. It wasn't the most interesting thing for them, and without the strollers or baby carriers, you could tell they were irritable. I also hate it when people read the information panels aloud to their kids when i'm trying to read silently to myself. \nOverall, it was worth it. Maybe leave the small children at home, though.", "author": "Krista F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-15", "description": "The new De Young is a sad fall from the previous incarnation.\n\nThe upstairs is tolerably aesthetic, however, the lighting is mediocre, at best. But no history of the artists or the art works is provided as part of displays.\n\nThe ground level redesign succeeds wildly, if the goal is to recapture the experience of viewing art in the walk-ways of an airport. There is no way to present events on the ground-level stage without jamming up foot-traffic. Likewise for other activities that are sometimes staged in the entryway. The acoustics throughout the ground level, including the cafe, are atrocious.\n\nThe basement level with the Tut exhibit is a mixed bag. The layout is poorly considered for the traffic that will be involved in some exhibits. It is idiotic that tickets are sold on the ground level, but checked down a very long flight of stairs. \n\nThe Tut exhibit layout is lit for theatrics rather than thorough appreciation. And, it falls apart in the details. Many items are lit only from the front, not from the back. Descriptions and accounts of history are extremely superficial. Glyphs should be translated everywhere, but are not. Once you are in the exhibit, you have to exit to use a restroom; one is not allowed readmission after leaving. The optional recorded audio tour equipment does not come with headsets, so to use it one has to keep it held up to the head for the entire visit.\n\nThe entire museum is child-unfriendly (something it has in common with the new California Academy of Sciences, just across the way). Almost nothing is accessible to children without lifting them up; and, if you put a child on your shoulders, guards will ask you to put them down (for insurance purposes). Like many art museums (but thankfully not all), the De Young totally missed every opportunity to be friendly to children and people who have children -- it wouldn't have been that difficult to make displays more appealing to all ages, and to have topic-relevant activities for kids that allow adults more time to enjoy the art (not that much time is needed to absorb the idiotically superficial descriptions of the art).\n\nThe De Young cafe is way over-priced, as one would expect.\n\nFrankly, I'd score the new De Young a near-zero, if not for the quality of the art on the upper level.\n\nI can't wait until they rebuild it again. I hope I am still alive. I hope they do a much better job.", "author": "Lou N."}

Absolutely wonderful collection that should not be missed. \nThe \"new\" De Young is pretty impressive. Building design is a piece of artwork itself. The tower has a wonderful 360 degree view of the city. The hanging wire works of Ruth Asawa by the elevators to the tower are beautiful. Don't miss the James Turrell dome outside by the sculpture garden. It is hard to find but once inside of it, it is a moving experience to look at the sky throught the dome. I think at night it is lit with neon. The older exhibits of regions is extensive. I've seen them so many times before since growing up in this area they are pretty ho-hum. They seem to get great exhibits (like Chicano Visions) and have a leg up on SFMOMA in some aspects. The Andy Goldsworthy Faultline at the entrance and gardens are great too. \n San Francisco museums have a ways to go on the food scene. I just came back from NYC and the food at the MOMA and Met were out of this world! The food at the De Young is okay. Kinda pricey, even for a hot dog. Cookies sucked, coffee good, variety slim.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-01", "description": "It's not really fair to hate on an entire museum because one exhibit falls short of your unhinged fantasy of being transported to Ancient Egypt. \n\nThe De Young consistently features captivating art in an incredible variety of media - I include Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs in that evaluation (No, there aren't any mummies. No, the Death Mask isn't there. That's explained in detail on the web site and is more than compensated for by the expansion of the exhibit with equally cool pieces).\n\nMy first trip was for the Sugimoto exhibit a couple of years ago. It was masterfully curated, and the placards and printed guide were well-researched and insightful. I've found this to be true for exhibits I've seen on every subsequent visit. \n\nI've also always found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. Though they weren't at all obligated to do so, they mediated my Tutankhamun Ticketmaster disaster (too boring to detail here - suffice it to say that it sucked and they made it go away). \n\nThe De Young strives to reconfigure popular concepts of art; in addition to providing a space for the consideration of modern and contemporary art, they submit the relics of ancient civilizations to patrons not merely as artifacts, but as art. Every time I go, they've found a new way to demonstrate that the volume of great art in the world is varied beyond imagination and completely inexhaustible. For quality and for breadth, I don't think there's a better museum in the city.\n\nAs far as the Tut Exhibit goes - read the web site beforehand, avoid going at 10 AM on a Saturday with your dSLR dangling from your neck, and accept that Americans are not entitled to see all of the priceless artifacts in the world consolidated into one museum for their convenience.

Once inside you are free to wander the permanent exhibits, find out about becoming a member, or head to the cafe (see my review of the De Young Cafe).

I found the experience rather frustrating, as the museum suffers from a lack of signage, and there don't seem to be a lot of maps showing where you are or where you should go. It starts in the parking lot, which is a long, rectangular space, which was full when we got there. There is no signage indicating that a second floor of parking exists upstairs, and after goiig round the garage twice, following a couple of other cars in a similar predicament, an attendant in a golf cart actually came out and told us that we could go upstairs, up this unmarked ramp. A simple sign with an arrow would have sufficed. Once we got upstairs, we found a space quite quickly. \n\nYou walk into the museum down a long corridor which has no signage whatsoever on where you are or where to go, for example, to get to Will Call which is where we wanted to be. Turns out, on asking a rather diffident attendant, that it is upstairs. So we trek up there, and eventually find the right Will Call line (there are separate ones for members and non-members, for some obscure reason). Got our tickets ok. The Will Call lady then directed us back downstairs to the PI exhibit. We went downstairs and showed our tickets. \"Oh no, the line for the Exhibit starts upstairs\", the same diffident attendant said. \"But we were told to come down here\", I said. \"No. it's upstairs\". \"No, I don't think so\", I said. So he let us in. \"Haven't they done this before?\", I said to my wife. \"After all the Exhibit has already been open six months\". Anyway, we got in, and found the anticipated masses of people, which made viewing rather lengthy. Also, there was nothing to tell you that it was one-way traffic through the event, so if you only see one side of a room on the way in, it is rather difficult to see the other side by doubling back, unless you want to feel like a salmon swimming upstream against the current. \n\nHaving said all that, it is a spectacular exhibit, and one not to be missed. But why do they make it so hard to find things there? We even had to ask where the Cafe was after we had come out of the Exhibit - again, no obvious signs.

It's closing this coming weekend and it's truly a spectacular collection of work.   Like the Frida exhibit at the MOMA, the tickets are time sensitive so groups are let in every 30 minutes. I went last weekend and it was pretty crowded, but I think the De Young will have extended hours to accommodate the closing.  Oo and P.S. photography is allowed (just no flashes)... and Chihuly's organic free flow pieces transform beautifully across film.  It's definitely muse for some stellar photos.", "author": "Mischen C."}

I LOVE the deYoung and the Legion I have been a member to FAMSF for many years and I HIGHLY recommend it for the benefits. \nI went to the King Tut exhibit on Weds. at 11:30 am, and I was glad to have tickets ahead of time because when we finished with the exhibit (and it's not like the Diamond Skull by Hirst where you have only a limited amount of time, so don't be fooled by the time on the ticket) the lines were much longer. \nSPOILER ALERT-\nIt was a very well put together exhibit and it showcased all of the artifacts you've seen on Discovery and the likes. I was disappointed that the Funerary mask was not there (although I could've done my research) nor was the sarcophagus itself.  Only the mini liver scarcophagus, so when you're going through the exhibit take time to really study that one, it's in the 9th room. Luckily I did so when I got to the 10th and final room I wasn't too terriably disappointed to see the hologram(graph?)/images of the actual one. \nI still love the museum for the permanent collection so I can't write a bad review.

Why?  Well, my mom worked here in the mid to late 80's.  I used to meet her here after school to get rides home - I'd walk from my high school in the Haight to her office.  I would get let in to the museum the back way.  It was pretty cool to be let in the back way of a museum after hours when no one is there and walk through sculptures and paintings in mostly dark rooms in complete silence (other than my footsteps on the marble floor) to get to her office.  But you know what?  The exhibits were o.k. but the space was kind of cramped - and her office was gross.  Everything felt old and dusty - there were lots of silverfish running around.  Eewww.  It was everything you ever think about when you think of \"museum\" and \"stodgy\" put together.  The new museum feels so open and airy with high ceilings and windows and natural light and plants and trees and.... aahhhh.\r\n\r\nAnd the exhibits are awesome - the recent Chicano exhibit was frickin' great!\r\n\r\nWhy not five stars?

The modern-themed paintings and Native American carvings were much easier to swallow than the repetitive European Medieval art I've seen in other museums.  I think de Young's hook is its variety--if you don't like paintings there is a ton of 3-dimensional pieces, an artistic architecture embodied in the museum itself, and plenty of interesting readings on the walls.   But the coolest thing was de Young's observation tower--it's truly mesmerizing.  You can see nearly all of SF from it including the two bridges, and there's an enormous aerial picture of the entire city mounted on the wall to boot.

But turns out, they were completely sold out of tickets for the rest of the weekend--that WOULD happen to us. But being in our early 20's, mid 20's, we felt that we should culturally enrich our young, post-college minds on the beauty of art...or so we used as justification for what we did. You see, we realized that to get in, all you needed were these little squares that you stick onto your shirt. They had time stamps on them, but the people checking for stickers weren't paying attention to the times. Being the resourceful kids that we were, we decided to look for squares on the ground. We engaged in distracting the employees, pretending like we dropped something on the ground to pick up a sticker, and lo and behold! After 45 minutes of searching for stickers, we finally found three, stuck it onto our shirts, and strutted right in. Everyone knew what we were up to. In fact, a security guard was laughing at us, and one of the other patrons came up to my friend and told her she saw what we did and thought it was hilarious.

Hideous, bright '80s colored bowls and vases make up the bulk of the show. I can accept that his work is not my thing, and I was at least expected a bunch bright colored glass sculpture but this is nothing but an overt cash grab.\nNote to the director:\nIf you want money from the general public then put in some rides and replace the bookstore and cafe with a Walmart and McDonalds.\nIf you want to be an art museum then please be more serious. \nAlso, take some care with the sculpture. The Sculpture garden really needs to paved - an unfortunate fact is irresponsible Bay Area parents think ANY patch of grass = playground for their undisciplined brats. \nDespite large and prominent \"DO NOT TOUCH\" signs both kids and adults were dry humping early  every sculpture. \nThe so many people had fingered up the Miro that it looked like a smudgy iphone screen.\n\n\nEdit: they get 2 more stars for having the balls to do the Gilbert and George show. I doubt they will ever do anything that good in the near future. Back to bad carpet and fashion shows. \nThe Gilbert and George show was very good - unless you are an acute homophobe.\nTo the idiot complaining about exhibitions not being suitable for children:\nThis is an art institution, not Chucky Cheese or the Exploratorium.\nFor centuries art history has often featured nudity, sexuality and violence. The responsibility of the De Young is to present important artwork, not appease you and your kids. Two minutes of Google research could have told you your kids and Gilbert and George were not a great match. \nMuseums compromise enough as  it is. Grow up, do your own research, take responsibility for your own parenting.\n\nPretty weak collection overall, hopefully that will change in time. I like some of the permanent site specific pieces like the James Turrel and Ed Ruscha and there are a few great paintings in the collection.\nThey have some OK traveling shows but also too many that are just pandering to people who have no interest in looking art like quilts and fashion shows.\nThe building is great and the food is decent.\n\nThey are also really lax about kids, I understand wanting to be family friendly but they let kids climb all over the sculpture which doesn't help the kids or the art.\nExposing kids to art is a great Idea but unfortunately it rarley works out well in reverse.", "author": "Damon S."}

This is not an area of art that I know much about, but the overall space and lighting's great.  I have to admit that I'd always find that particular portion of the museum to be a little unsettling to me.  Probably from fear of finding a shrunken head in a display case somewhere.

There were so many indescribably beautiful and wonderful pieces, some of which seemed so vibrant that they could've been alive.  \nOf course, it was easy for the work to be phenomenal, but the museum itself also well run.  The staff weren't too uptight, as in other museums that I've been to, especially in the Chihuly exhibit which most everyone and their mothers seemed to check out today.  Certain places were a bit crowded and traffic jams weren't uncommon, but with an exhibit as brilliant as this one, I suppose it couldn't be helped.  The rest of the museum was straight forward.  There weren't quite as many pieces as I would've thought, but there were quite a few that I enjoyed.

Speaking of kids, don't bring them.  They will not enjoy any of the statues, and what stuff you can explain to them based on what is written on the walls, will go way over thier heads.

At the same time, the Museum is also charging Members $22 per person to see the King Tut exhibit, thus making it expensive for members to see the show more than once.  I am not sure why anyone would sign up for this deal.", "author": "Tom W."}

We have a membership in order to feel better about short visits with the kiddos.  The building itself is lovely to look at and other Yelpers have written about the basis of the design (trees, light, transformation).  I LOVED the Maya Lin, and felt that this was very accessible to my 4 yo.  There are many groovy pew-like benches placed around the museum, which allowed us to sit and play I Spy with various artworks, as well as look out onto the sculpture garden.\n\nOh, yeah - the Sculpture Garden.  A giant Claus Oldenberg  safety pin, complete with a perfect little spot for the under 7 set to squeeze through and into.  A dozen foot-tall apples. perfect for little bums to sit on.  A mound of climbable grass around the dome.  Trees every where, all with very low branches - so very climbable.  I could go on.  The thing is, everything is a \"do not touch, do not climb\" situation.  Whoever designed that sculpture garden just wasn't thinking - this outdoor area is where families *need* to bring their kids to release some energy and escape from the constant chant of \"this is a looking place, not a touching place!\" - and not only have they made all the art off-limits, but they are TEASING the children with art that is screaming to be handled and loved, trees that are practically BEGGING to be climbed, hills that are meant to be conquered by little feet.  \n\nMy husband and I felt bad for the security guards - out there every 5 minutes berating children for doing what comes naturally to them.  I am a big believer that, if you want to teach kids to have an appreciation for art, they need to experience it on terms that open their minds, not close it.  That outdoor area is practically a big F-U to families with little kids - a big tease that makes me think they'd rather we stayed away until they were teenagers... who no longer care about art because all their early experiences with it were negative.\n\nGreat building, OK collection, wonderful traveling exhibits, and a LAME outdoor space.", "author": "Catherine K."}

Actually, it turned out to be the opposite. I'd seen some gorgeous photos of the building in San Francisco magazine, but I think the weather made all the difference. The photos were taken on a perfectly clear day, but last weekend was cold, overcast and windy. That meant the building was just a dull copper color, whereas in the pictures it seemed to glimmer and reflect the sun and surroundings. \n\nNevertheless, it is still an impressive place. I liked the shards of rock and bamboo gardens; you saw them as you made your way around indoors, and it made you feel like you were outdoors at the same time.\n\nAnd I liked the permanent collections more than I thought. They have some particularly good pieces by Wayne Thiebaud, his vertiginous paintings of San Francisco hills. There's also a piece of the Central Valley, its fields rendered in Technicolor. The permanent collections are more extensive than I thought, too.\n\nThe exhibit we saw, the Arts and Crafts movement, was curated well, made up of little areas devoted to the movement in various countries. It was packed. \n\nMy friend Angie suggested becoming a member because it nearly pays for itself in two visits, particularly the student membership. It includes unlimited free admission for two people to the de Young and the Legion of Honor, where I'm headed next weekend to see the Monet in Normandy exhibit with my mom.", "author": "Deb K."}

It has now become a world-class museum and houses some of the most rewarding and worth while exhibitions I've seen (though some have been average at best).  Not to mention the fact that it has re-invigorated this section of the park, and pushed out some of the all to common riff raff that one would have to step over in order to retrieve a stray golf disc.  And it was done mostly with private funds raised by local philanthropists.  \n\nThe design of the building, both exterior and interior, is a reflection of our city in a minimalist and elegant expression.  It encompasses many influences from the design world that resonate with the history of our area --- most prominently the craftsman movement that had its early roots in this part of the country, and incidentally was one of the first exhibits at the museum.  From the outside I agree that it isn't the most inviting building, but to have an exterior that changes over time --- a living and ever evolving skin, much like that of our city --- is an ingenious representation of what this area is to me --- a reflection of my growth and change as I've lived here and experienced life.  I look forward to watching the green patina develop and blend into the natural surroundings of the park, as I sit in the sculpture garden with a great book or a picnic lunch and gaze at the whimsical lawn art on the grounds.  One of my favorite aspects of the design is the observation tower.  This space lends so much perspective to the area, to the museum, and to me when I stand in it looking out and contemplating my time spent in and memories of San Francisco.  I love this museum.", "author": "Pedro, aka Burgundy M."}

Being my first visit to a San Francisco art museum, I was very surprised at how this collection was shoved into modest, dark rooms, and then hoardes of people were pushed through it like so much bologna thru the grinder! Lucky for me, my height enabled me to jockey for a view most of the time. \nThe Van Goghs were clearly the top draw -- and unless you played the rude card, or wanted to creep along one body width every 5 minutes, you weren't going to get a front row glimpse. I know, because I abided the line for 10 minutes and hardly moved! So I did the over-the-shoulders look from behind 4 or 5 people. It was OK, but only because I've been to the real museum in Paris, which is much more spacious and appropriate for such great works. \nThe gift shop was a little lame too. Surely someone with a little creativity could stock it with more interesting and memorable items than a few books, reprints, espresso cups and a goofy tie?\nC'mon de Young, get some elbow room in there. I echo someone else's review that it must've been pretty frustrating for the wheelchair-bound, trying to move around in that mob. I saw very little accommodation being made by visitors, either. Weird.\nSorry, go to Paris and see this stuff in its rightful home.

However, the experience does have some negatives.  The collection seems to lack focus.  One minute you are looking at French impressionists and suddenly you are looking at tribal masks of Africa.  Because the collection jumps around in terms of location and time, you end up having to read nearly every plaque to get the context of what you are looking at.\n\nThe new building is a mixed bag in terms of architecture.  The main building is a big brown irregular polygon with a strange finish.  The irregular shape creates some non-functional \"dead areas\" cut out from the middle of the building.  The strength of the new building is clearly its asymmetrical tower element  that in addition to making a strong architectural statement has a nifty observation deck to look down on the rest of San Francisco. \n\nThe De Young is a nice art museum but there are better museums to see in SF.", "author": "Brandon S."}

Was somewhat disappointed when I realized we were at the end of the tour and very little jewelry and no Tut. It was a real let down.  I had gone to the De Young website prior to my visit to give myself a bit of an education . There were lots of things included on the site I had looked forward to seeing. Unfortunately, they weren't included in the actual exhibit. Even the banners around town had a picture of Tut, but he was a no show.\n I think if they were honest they should have called the exhibit \"Tuts Tomb\". I still enjoyed myself. It was a beautiful exhibit, just not what I was expecting. Parking is pricey but super easy and the lines into the museum on a Sunday were extremely light. The cafe was a great place to relax after the tour. My major complaint  was the gift shops were stuffed with poorly chosen, uninspired, expensive Tut souvenirs. Do we REALLY need a Tutty-bear ?

Other than the Oakland Museum, I don't think many major institutions have given 18th, 19th, and early 20th century California art the credit it's due.  For a state as crucial as California with so many varied and stunning landscapes, this stuff should be highly coveted, but I guess critics around those time periods had different ideals, huh.  \nI liked the permanent collection as well.  Many works by the mega artists who are near and dear to the bay area, Wayne Thiebaud and Richard Diebenkorn, as well some nice examples by 20th century staples.  I loved the Edward Hopper painting (forgot the title), it really made an impression.  Never cared for Ed Rushca, they have some of his prints up along with Jasper Johns' in a room that seems a little out of place. \nI had trouble following the exhibit on artifacts from the americas.  I'm not sure what the curator was thinking, maybe I was walking the wrong way, but it didn't appear chronological.  Upstairs from that features some older works, including a major painting by Frederic Church and a view of the sculpture garden beyond it.  I spend some good quality time with that painting.\nFun to go to the observation tower, especially with some friends.  If you want a fun joke to play, go up to your friend while s/he is standing at the window and grab them and pretend you are pushing them off the side.  I did this to my friend and he freaked out and I got some good laughs from onlookers.  Then, later, he did it to me and I freaked out EVEN though I was somewhat expecting it. \nThe sculpture garden is nice, especially on a sunny day - the claes oldenberg safety pin was my favorite out there.", "author": "Tim A."}

I'd give the exhibit one less star, except that I've waited most of my life to see this. I'm not going to run down everything in the exhibit, the major attractions can all be seen online. I'm going to get my gripe out of the way up front. Akhenaten was Tutankhamen's father. The exhibit is festooned with a flood (comparatively) of chotchki from Tutankhamen's relatives, to Akhenaten's 3 major items. 3. That's it. Wanna know why? Akhenaten liked guys and at one point ruled with a co-regent king named Smenkhare who we'd also have to mention. The curator of the exhibit is very conservative and would prefer not to talk about such things, so Akhenaten, the bisexual, heretic, one of the most noteworthy and influential pharaohs in all of Ancient Egyptian History, is mostly overlooked. And it's not for lack of artifacts, there are a ton. There, I got it out of the way. The rest...there were some precious items. I'm still trying to figure out how to sneak Tutankhamen's jeweled burial dagger out of the museum. Just kidding. One thrill was seeing my first sarcophagus, belonging to one of the aforementioned relatives. The line going in felt like Disneyland and the audio tour was very basic. To fully appreciate this exhibit, I suggest you do some prior reading, unless of course you are an Egyptologist.  I'm taking my nephew back before the run is up.

The lot off Tea Garden drive was closed, so I proceeded to circle the streets in search of a spot. No luck.  Little did I know that the 10th street parking lot entrance was open.  There were no signs to redirect you, so keep this in mind if you're visitng on a weekend.  The exhibit itself was pretty cool, from the dramatic door-opening entrance to the mysterious exhibit halls.  I highly recommend that you get the audio tour (free with Costco tickets) as the tour would have been extremely boring without it.  It does a good job of explaining certain exhibit pieces and it adds a level of interactivity and drama you just don't get from reading the placards.  The time we spent in the tour was pretty short, just under an hour.  We zipped by some of the pieces as I have a short attention span and hadn't eaten lunch yet.

The type size on the display descriptions is too small unless you are standing nearly on top of the display case. The lighting is many of the rooms is too dim and not properly directed on to the descriptions. If you are older, have poor vision, or if you are in a wheelchair (as several visitors were when I toured) this is a major disadvantage.  The other issue is packing way too many people into each \"wave\" of ticket-holders.  Having too many people in a room, plus too-small type, requires that you hang back until everyone else moves on and THEN walk up, nose-to-glass, and read the descriptions.\nThey also do not enforce the \"no strollers\" rule. Meaning that little kids who don't understand what's going on are either screaming because they want to get OUT of their stroller, or crying because they want to get out of the dark, scary rooms.

Oh, helpful hint, no backpacks, unless you carry it in your hand at all times.  and no cameras...which sucks, but i understand\nit first starts with king tut's grand parents...the only mummy was his grandmother...most do not realize that king tut is not in the exhibit...he is only available in egypt.  i knew that, however my bf and our friends did not know that, they were a bit disappointed.  however, we were all very impressed with the whole exhibit.  \nit was well spaced and it took us almost 2 hours to walk through and enjoy the detail of every item.  benches are placed along the walls and were greatly appreciated after the days activities of walking and standing.  Absolutely amazing.  \nMy only regret is that we did not get to see the rest of the museum, but will definitely come again.", "author": "Cristy B."}

From what I understand, the copperish design is supposed to mimic the appearance of the trees. Blahblahblah. I guess it's what inside that counts, and this place was disappointing. I used to come to the \"old\" pre-earthquake (damn earthquake..) museum back in the day. Back when they still had that funky pond deal outside and those cute little turtles chilling on the rocks with their cute little heads pointed up at the sky. The museum used to be classy and timeless in its way, pretty awesome really (for San Francisco. I hear New York museums are the best). Anyway, the new place just seemed disjointed. It looked expensive (and I'm sure it was..) and whatnot. For someone like me who doesn't know a lot about art, I don't know, it just didn't make much of an impression. I certainly miss back when the Asian Art Museum and the De Young were both in the same complex. Now it seems both have suffered an identity crisis. Have you been to the Asian recently? Wow, what a confusing and ugly place. Yikes. Hopefully with the Academy of Sciences coming back there will be more foot traffic in Golden Gate Park. I want people to come to Golden Gate Park and enjoy it. I hope the De Young can get its \"stuff\" together and be a little more coherent to me in my next visit. Maybe their target audience is too narrow or something.", "author": "Al B."}

Luckily, I had pre-purchased tickets online through museumtix.com for the Chihuly exhibit for 3PM which gave us 6 hrs to spend at CAS if needed... which we spent 5 of... after walking over we had an hour to spare til it was our turn so we roamed around the museum... This was our first time here and the first time I've been to any kind of art museum with the hubs.  It was a nice experience to discuss the different pieces with him and find out the kind of art he liked.  The museum was easy to walk through and not get lost... We were able to get around and not feel like we had already been here.  The Chihuly exhibit was beautiful... it was breathtaking... the colors, the shapes... after going thru it once... we turned around and decided to do it again since there was no re-entry back into it.  It was the last day of the exhibit and it was quite crowded... people were everywhere.

And if you do go bring someone you can have a lot of fun talking with, who also has an appetite for some dancing and alcohol.  Friday nights are free to get in, but to actually go around the exhibits you need to pay for admission, and drinks aren't the cheapest.  This is definitely a pay for the atmosphere place.  I work on the side with the company that sets up the cash bar there so I got admission and free drinks all night for me and the lady friend I brought along.  There's nothing like walking through the exhibits a bit more then tipsy and really checking out art.  We both loved it but the alcoholic in me always brought me to the bar area again to refill.  Right next to the bar in Wilsey Court is where the live music was playing and that night it was all salsa.  Every week the theme changes but it's always a good time out with someone you can have fun with in any situation.  Go here, and tip big at the bar!  I could use the extra cash.", "author": "Alex H."}

I guess its a sister museum to the legion of honor which I've been to, but the exhibits seemed really different. You do get free sameday admission to the legion of honor if you go to the deyoung in case you wanted to do both. There were two floors and four wings and one side was this sculptural artwork by a local japanese artwork where she bent copper and galvanized steel wires into baskets and made them into intricate designs (like stars and trees). The other exhibits were african and native american artifacts, then there was california landscapes which we didn't spend too much time on. And the other exhibit were a bunch of random paintings some by diego rivera and picasso. My boyfriend and i had a good time there. Outside they had giant sculptures, like a giant safety pin, some 3 ft apples, and a hollowed out limestone rock or something. I liked the garden and the japanese artists' exhibit the best", "author": "Thao T."}

Add to that the Bouquets to Art exhibit that my friends are ready to \"call in sick\" to see on the first day next year (and yes, it really was that good, even in its' final hours) and, as we discovered last weekend, the masterpiece that is the cafe's macaroni and cheese (OK- I would add the salad- but macaroni and cheese you will get a second order after you've split one already is worth a mention in any review) - well, you basically have a neat place with fun events and great architecture.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-10-12", "description": "The new de Young officially opens this weekend with a 31 hour continuous opening. The building, by the Swiss team of Herzog & de Meuron, authors of the Tate Modern, is surprisingly warm and humane for a contemporary museum built by superstar architects. Just when you thought glass, steel and poured concrete were the only materials deemed worthy for such buildings, along comes wood. Wooden floors and ceilings, the latter aiding with acoustics so that when the person next to you is chatting incessantly, their voice is softened enough you don't want to kill them -- a very nice touch. This is also likely the first museum designed so that collections can intermingle at the edges of their proper galleries, very unusual, in fact, particular attention has been paid to both the collection and the exterior landscape of the park. Frankly, after so many spectacular museum buildings that look ruined by the objects they are meant to hold, this feels like a revolution.  A puckered and perforated copper skin sheaths the building, giving it an odd, almost chameleon-like appearance, almost as though it were hiding within the park. A smart, thoughtful and somewhat plain sculpture garden by local landscape architect Walter Hood extends the experience to the out-of-doors. This enveloping of inside/outside occurs within the building itself, a welcome feature in what could otherwise have been an experience in artificial light (like SFMoMa). Go this weekend, Oct 15-16, in the middle of the night. They'll be open, and the collection is quite nice.", "author": "Iana S."}

The view from the tower is quite pretty even on an overcast day, but it's a bummer you can't climb up there. I'd give this four stars were it not for the insane amount of harassment from museum personnel regarding bags. We were told it was fine to bring a bag in, but from one room to the next, we were alternatively told to put both straps of backpack on, only put one strap on, carry bag by top handle and not have any part of it on, etc. It was obvious that someone had knocked something important over with a bag in the recent past, but it was took away from our enjoyment of the museum to constantly being hassled about our bags (and given different information by different people).

I really love the way this space looks, from the bi-directional dimples in the rusted fascade and the rolling landscaping that follows as you decend to the basement. thats where the freshness kind of stops for me. We never ventured into the other galleries and instead attempted to enjoy a trip to the tower. Being a Sunday the museum was extremely crowded and as we waiting in line for the elevator up we shouldve known it wouild be the same on the way down. we didnt, or we wouldve left the line all together but instead we boarded an elevator hoping to see some cool views of the city and the new science center next door. As we disembarked we got directly on the line that wrapped around the tower in order to get back down. they never opened the stairs and instead forced everyone to wait as we shuffled around the entire tower.

The creativity expressed here went beyond what I could have imagined with this medium, and the  use of the intense colors was equally compelling. The other exhibits at the DeYoung Museum were worth attending as well, particularly some of the ancient african rooms. The only drawback--a big one--was the poor crowd control and management at the museum. There were hundreds of people pouring in the day (Sat) we attended, and only a few receptionists. No one was directing the crowds, but we somehow learned about more ticket booths down stairs with shorter lines. We headed down, only to find there were only two receptionists, and as we got closer, one got up to leave--apparently it was her break, leaving 40 or so people in line. It took us over 45 min. to get in, and then we had to wait 1.5 hours for the 3:30 show. There were dozens of employees roaming around handing out flyers and watching the crowds, but no one helping usher them through. Admittedly, it was a big crowd (they advertised heavily).

The Turrell piece in the garden outside is much better than a description will make it seem.  The inside architecture is less impressive, but whatever.  The collections themselves are not the best I've seen (and I haven't seen all that many, to be honest) but they're decent.  Love the Thiebaud stuff and the SF figurative pieces, the \"Saxe\" room of contemporary ceramics and sculptures, and F.E. Church's Rainy Season in the Tropics (say what you will, the painting's a crowd-pleaser).  The non-western art was interesting but kind of unfocused and the much-discussed transitions between the Western and non-Western galleries were indeed jarring, but added a kind of (probably unintentional) playfulness similar in attitude to the Goldsworthy piece.
