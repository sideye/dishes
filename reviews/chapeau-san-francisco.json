The owner, Phillipe, and his wife are always front of house making sure everyone is happy. \n\nI always order the three course meal, and I always start with the trio of salmon, which sounds basic but definitely isn't. It's too good to try something else, but I always consider it. The I have also never been disappointed by a main course, but the filet and bacon wrapped pork are my all-time favorites. I recently tried the scallops main and loved it. Perfectly prepared!\n\nThe French toast dessert is amazing! Definitely my favorite, but the warm chocolate cake, nuage de noix (you better love nuts for this one) and ant tarte if they have it on the menu are awesome, too. \n\nConsistent, delicious, and even with the 3 courses and water filled/crumbs wiped without you even noticing, it doesn't feel stuffy at all.

My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and I can most certainly say that it was an unforgettable experience.\n\nEven before we entered the restaurant, the host was so kind and friendly. He made us feel like we were walking into his home for a truly personal experience. After being seated and waiting a bit, our waiter, a quirky French gentleman, provided us with the menus and explained all of the specials for the night. I personally recommend choosing the 3 or 4 course pre-fixe menu just because the value is so much better, and you and your partner can try different things! The quality of service was absolutely superb. Waters constantly refilled, timely checkups to see how we were doing at the table, and even having our napkins folded when we went to use the bathroom added to the whole experience.\n\nAs for the food, there were definitely some highlights and must-gets:\n\nTrio of Salmon: Definitely a must-get! They made this dish so light and flavorful. The crispy capers added a nice crunch and saltiness to the extremely fresh salmon that was served. In addition, there was a hint of sweetness from the caviar and lemon dressing that rounded out the whole dish. \n\nVeal Sweetbreads: If you haven't had sweetbreads, then this is definitely the place to try them! They have a very savory taste, very similar to liver. The texture was slightly chewy but extremely tender, and the dark sauce and mushrooms that accompanied the dish were amazing.\n\nPan-Seared Day Boat Scallop: Probably one of the best scallops I've ever had. Like seriously. Try this dish.\n\nBouillabaisse: The broth was slightly salty for my taste, but all in all a great dish that contained a lot of fresh seafood and also some DELICIOUS gruyere on toast.\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse: This was okay. If you're a lover of smoked meats then I definitely recommend this to you. The duck was extremely tender and the sausage reminded me of Texas BBQ. The beans were also good as well, but definitely serve to fill you up quickly. \n\nChocolate Cake: I love chocolate molten cake so much, and this one was extremely interesting! There was a slight hint of rum in the cake that was a little too strong for me, but aside from that it was delicious.\n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e: The best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've ever had! It was perfectly prepared, with the sweet crispy sugared on top and the light airy vanilla custard on the inside. Such a great way to end a wonderful meal.", "author": "Gregory T."}

Next came the Salade Landaise (Fris\u00e9e, Duck confit and smoked duck magret, fingerling potato chips and vinaigrette), which was a hearty salad. \n(3). It's been a while since I've had traditional escargot and this was delicious. \n(4). Palate Cleanser was apple sherbet with French apple liqueur\n(5).  The main course was filet mignon with seared foie and marrow. Just decadent. \n(6).  Dessert was French toast with caramel ice cream.\n\nAt the end of this particular week, I needed this particular meal. The service was good and the ambiance was very energetic.  With tax and tip, this meal was $130. It's about what you would expect to pay for fine dining in SF. Highly recommended and I'll be back to try out Chef's other items.", "author": "Andrew S."}

They seated us near the corner of the room. It was pretty cozy, the waiter was really nice and explained everything on the menu. \n\nSince we were early birds, we had the opportunity to order a prix-fixe \"(3 or 4). I ordered the 3 and he ordered the 4 meal. The BREAD was SO tasty that I couldn't stop eating it but it was a bad idea! I couldn't eat my meals!!!! \n\nOrdered Oysters for him because he likes it.. but me? mehh not so much!! The chef gave all of us a cup of his asparagus soup in a tiny soup cup. Of course I was hesitant to drink it, but I did! \n\nHe got a duck salad .. or maybe I got the duck salad, and he got the salmon trio which has 3 diff kinds of salmon mushed into one dish. His bonus was one med sized scallop on top of some mushed peas and some sauce. Presentation is very nicely done. \n\nMy main meal was bone marrow and filet minon, I had asked for medium rare (love my meat bloody) and he got the lamb chops. Let's start with the bone marrow, I love love loved the bone marrow, it was so melty and buttery, sounds disgusting, but I don't eat fat, but damn that was so good. At this point I am so full but I decided to try my filet mignon. I take a bite and I'm like um, why is this dry.... I take a bite of his Lamb Chops and it was divine. \n\nAt this point we were BOTH SOOOOOOOO FULL from everything... I couldn't even eat it. I couldn't finish my dessert, I thought my button was gonna fly off. \n\nDessert - French Toast - it was delicious but too full to eat it. Then.. SO's Creme Brulee was light and good, so I had some of that. \n\nOf course we had wine, the wine was paired to our food, I just said surprise us! \n\nOK - This part is kinda gonna sound nasty... since I loved the bread, I loved the butter.. but at one point, the butter had a piece of hair in there, I almost threw up! I told the waiter, and he told us that he will find out who it is and shave his head off LOL..... but to make it up to us, he gave us a glass of rose. \n\nIn the end I told him my mignon was a little on the dry side... he told me he asked the chef to make me another one so i can take it home to eat it and it'll be just right when I heat it up. THAT is SOOOO NICE!!! \n\nThe head chef came out and gave everyone a handshake and thanked the patrons for coming. \n\nI would come back to celebrate some other things!", "author": "Eugenia W."}

The service was friendly and prompt and food was divine. Even though most people were dressed up, we got the distinct feel that chapeau is still a neighborhood joint. What a gem. \n\nWe ordered their three course prefix menu. It's great that you could choose from their regular menu for the courses. I got the foie ($10 supplement), the filet ($6 supplement) and the baked Alaska for dessert. My husband got the French onion soup, the cassoulet and the French toast. The foie was decadent and cooked to perfection. The filet was medium rare and oh so tender. The sauce that came with it was rich and had great depth of flavor and the potatoes were buttery and completed the entree so well. My only complaint was that the meringue on the baked Alaska could be a bit less sweet. My husband also loved his dishes. We polished off everything and the serving sizes were perfect. \n\nI hope to return soon for their early bird special, probably the best deal in town.

My friend had reserved a table late Friday night and it was at full capacity by the time my gf and I arrived. This place is about a 15 minute car ride from Civic Center BART and has very limited parking outside. My friend had to circle for 20 minutes to find a place to park. It also can be hard to miss because there isn't a sign in front of the restaurant.\n\nThe service here was fantastic with the exception of the feeling that we were being attended to less because our group was the youngest in the room. The head chef definitely goes above and beyond to welcome you and can be seen socializing with all the guests. He even gives a great birthday rendition which is one-of-a-kind. They also did not use us to leave as we left around 12:30am which was well after the 10:30pm listed closing time. The chef even personally saw us out like we had been good friends for a long time!\n\nThe food here in French terms is magnifique! (I took a little French in highschool). In order to enjoy the majority of the menu at great value, I suggest ordering the 3/4 course menu amongst a party which is split with the \"!\" In the menu. Be sure to ask how it is done if you are confused. Personally I recommend the Filet Mignon ($40) and Bone Marrow (+$6 but worth it) as well as the Escargot which for my first time was delicious and not how I had imagined snail to taste (like juicy garlic buttered fat of a nice steak).\n\nSome things that took away from the experience were that the tables were really close together, the food took a little long to come out and we had to flag someone down to take our orders after waiting for quite some time. There is also a 4% SF fee added to the bill.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my first time with French cuisine and hope that this place stays around and continues to improve and prosper; I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Victor G."}

The owner always greets each and every individual party from start to finish. I highly recommend snagging a reservation on opentable to guarantee you a spot. \n\nAs soon as my party was seated, we wanted to pop open our Bottle of Opus one to aerate. I was kind of disappointed when one of the gentlemen told me sure but to just put it down when I tried to hand it to him. When our full party finally arrived, about ten minutes, my boyfriend decided to get up to the bartender and ask him if he could help us pop open the bottle. He popped it open right away for us. Corkage fee here is $30 a bottle.\n\nFood here is outstanding as usual. Trio of salmon is the perfect flavors of Smokey yet creamy. The seared foie gras was bursting in fatty oil. It was absolutely delicious. \nI got the prime rib which is shareable between two diners. They recommended it to be done as medium rare. I opted for that, but when it came out, I got rare. I was put off by it but still ate it. The black truffle sauce made it just bearable. I probably should've sent it back, but my boyfriend loves rare beef so I just fed it to him.", "author": "Ada H."}

My first time here was back in 2012 for my birthday and my experience kept with me till this day. Luckily, Chapeau is also part of RWSF so I was still able to try this place for years since for a fraction of the price. My most recent visit was.. quite a while back for a date night with the bf. The place hasn't changed much; same vibe, same attentive service, and the chef/owner greeting us and bidding us farewell and goodnight after our meal.\n\nESCARGOTS: wow. so yummy and hot. 6 delicious hot pieces of escargot baked in this green parsley pesto sauce? IT was good to say the least. You may even dip your bread in to get the rest of the sauce. \n\nCOTE BOEUF: this was on the specials on the day we went and our waiter said it was good enough to share if we're not too hungry. In English terms, Cote Boeuf means Rib Steak which is a thick piece of rib steak with bone. The waiter wasn't joking when he said we could share this. He presented the whole rib steak to us pre-cut and it was very big in portion. Then he took it back in and cut it into pieces for us. The steak was very tender and juicy. The bone marrow was hot and deliciously gelatinous and fatty. Paired together was like a burst of heavenly flavors in my mouth. I really enjoyed it. I had about 5 pieces of perfectly cooked medium rare rib steak and it was more than enough.\n\nBASIL NAPOLEON: I'm not really a sweets person so I often skip dessert but the bf can be when he wants to. He was feeling dessert this particular night so we asked our waiter for a suggestion. He recommended their popular Basil Napoleon which he said was light and not too sweet so that i can try it also. The dessert was very pretty with fruits such as mango, strawberries, kiwi's, etc. It was lightly crisp as you take your first bite but met with a creamy texture once you sink your teeth in. Flavors were interesting and light indeed; my bf really liked it. But it was just alright for me. A bit too sour from the mango. but then again... i do have a biased opinion on desserts and mango lol. \n\nService was superb. Our waiter, Guillame (on the receipt), was really cordial and formal.

The scallops were tender and I was impressed over the fact that there wasn't a sandy texture. Scallops are one of the hardest ingredient to perfect but chapeau definitely perfected it. The sea bass and oxtail was not to my lady's liking. It was overly salted to the point where she scooted her dish to my side for me to eat. typical. The filet was juicy and just gushed with flavor.

The head chef/owner is super nice and makes you feel like you're one of the most important customers when you enter the restaurant and also when you walk out.  The lady owner actually noticed that I was left-handed and switched my utensils the first time I was here.  You feel like you're part of their family.\n\nYou can have a 3 or 4 course meal here.  I generally would do a la carte b/c you're not saving too much for getting the set, unless you're ordering the most expensive from each category (appetizer, main & dessert).  It also prevents me from eating too much since the dishes are mostly pretty rich and heavy.  \n\nThe pan-fried scallops appetizer was delicious.  I loved the sauce and the scallops were cooked to produce the perfect texture.  I would say it's even Gary Danko scallop quality.  However the risotto for the dish was a bit too hard.  They should've cooked it a bit longer.  \n\nI loved the boullabaise.  And again, the scallop in there was perfect.  The fish and mussels were amazing.  The sauce may be a tad too salty for some people, but I don't mind saltiness. I just loved the flavor.  The bacon wrapped pork tenderloins were really good.  It was so tender cooked at medium temperature.  It blended nicely in the sauce.  I typically don't like sweet sauces.  However, this was just a hint of sweetness, so it wasn't that overpowering.  \n\nWe had the baked alaska, which was a bit sweet for my taste.  It's just the meringue.  The chocolate sauce, ice cream, and nuts were awesome.  Just having a little bit of the meringue with the rest of the dessert made it much better b/c it wasn't that sweet.  The nuage de noix dessert was awesome and it wasn't too sweet.  Loved the pistaschio flavor.   \n\nI would have to come back and try the other dishes.  Especially the dish with skate.  You have remember to call ahead and reserve it or just set an earlier dinner reservation.  It's limited quantity.  Plus I've tried skate before.", "author": "Shirley C."}

He made time to give us a back story of how he derived his Cassoulet, a wonderful home-style comfort dish he loved growing up in France.\n\nI find his Cassoulet quite hearty and inviting with its softer textural varieties from the Canellini Beans, Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder, Duck Leg Confit, and regional Sausages from Southern France. It's a heavy dish with a tad too much salt, but can be balanced out with good wine...\n\nI selected a modest 2006 Sup\u00e9rieur Senailhac I found rather luxurious being a bargain French Bordeaux, smooth mouthfeel and a nice fragrant blend with oak and dark fruit tasting notes.\n\nEscargots: a half dozen prepared in the classic Bourguignonne style. Some exertions needed upon mastication, good balance of salty and earthy.\n\nFourme D'Armbert Tart - Frisee Salad, Anjou Pear, Balsamic Reduction: a mountainous pile of Frisee gives a fresh crispness that compliments a heavier pan-fried savory tart batter, offset by the sweetness of the fruit. This was a very simple dish that demonstrated effective contrast.\n\nTrou Normand - Green Apple Sorbet, Calvados: I don't recall ever being served a dessert amuse bouche in between warm savory courses in any French dining, but I find the freezing tartness of the sorbet an effective disruption, giving tonight's dinner a multidimensional experience.\n\nWild Skate Wing in Brown Butter - Fingering Potato, Sauce Grenobloise, Mache: A popular Southeastern French dish is this tricky fish which could taste rather off if improperly prepared. Gardelle seems to have mastered his cooking as the dish tasted wonderful. Excellent pairing with creamed Mache.\n\nFilet Mignon & Bone Marrow - Pommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms, Sauce a la Perigourdine: I'm a sucker for anything marrow; its fattiness is beautifully rendered and plays nicely with a medallion of the steak. Umami nuances tastefully furnished by both varieties of the fungi.\n\nProfiteroles: sweet creamy filling in a puffy choux, topped with chocolate syrup and dusted in powdered sugar. I love how Gardelle sticks with the classics.\n\nTahitienne Vanilla Creme Brulee: a creamy and subly floral-fruity tasting notes from Tahitian Vanilla Beans give this brulee a nuance edge, topped with a perfectly caramelized crisp.\n\nGardelle cordially shook my hand as we departed, sealing a memory to last. This is probably my best French dining experience for under $200 for two. A must try for a bargain prix fixe that should have deserved at least a Michelin.", "author": "Trung N."}

I've eaten in Michelin Star restaurants and Chapeau's service is second to none. \n\nOnly drawback is the level of noise. It is in general a bit loud and for us we had a couple of women right next to us that were extremely loud, and they were sitting next to the wall so it amplified it even more. \n\nBut don't be deterred by this.

Service was superb, from time we entered with warm welcoming handshake, we were seated immediately, to the time we left with farewell \"embrasses\".  Food was excellent- with warm bread constantly refilled before we needed to ask.  Great tasting baguettes and European butter, cream of tomato soup on the house.  Appetizers were good, frois gras definitely worth the surcharge.  My son loved the authentic French onion soup and escargot was on point.  Scallops and mussels came next and by our second course we were full (ate too much of tasty bread).  Nonetheless the pork chops, fillet mignon, and bouillabaisse was so good that although we were already full we had very little to take home.  Finally the dessert- French toast, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and chocolate lava cake.  We didn't leave any room for dessert yet still managed to finish it all - it was that good.  All in all 4 course meal took a total of 3.5 hours - this is NOT fast food.  \nThe setting is modern and sleek with real cloth napkins.  It's boisterous, which suits my Chinese parents just fine. We may have seemed uncouth sharing plates family style in a fancy French restaurant but was never made to feel uncomfortable. (I didn't expect for them to have last minute opening and was in casual T and flip flops- oops.) Definitely more of a dress up place but everyone is welcomed. Even my domineering mom liked it.  She only usually likes Asian food and judges every restaurant harshly, as my dad is a REAL 5 star chef -  equivalent of Michelin rating (minus the service, pure taste - think Soup Nazi on Seinfield).  I stay away from Chinese or Asian food with my dad because, of course, he can make it better.  My dad (took him there for his birthday) simply nodded when asked how dinner was.  That's a huge compliment.  I've only known that myself a handful of times when I've cooked for him.", "author": "Mimi E."}

We got really full and couldn't finish all the entrees and desserts but had at least half of each. The ambience is nice, dim lighting but it was too cozy with tables pretty close to each other. \nAppetizers:\nHighly recommend the foie gras. Escargot was also really good and is served out of the shell. \nEntrees:\nDuck 2 ways was good but the halibut was so flavorful and delish (however too salty for my taste). \nDessert:\nThe oozing warm valrhona chocolate cake was delish w/ the rum raisin ice cream. I love sweets but the Baked Alaska was clawingly sweet - it could've done with 1/2 the merengue and it would've been perfect.

I actually came in expecting a less-than-stellar experience because I was able to snag seats here without reservations on a weekend night when other popular restaurants nearby were all full - but I found the whole experience to be absolutely amazing.\n\nMenu items like the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with parsnip puree, caramelized apple, shaved Brussels sprouts, and apple-calvados sauce were every bit as savory and yummy as they sounded and looked. Quite filling and satisfying stuff, with quite reasonable prices given the good underlying quality. As if I hadn't already gorged enough on the entr\u00e9e, the nuage de noix, with roasted pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts, frozen chantilly & Italian meringue, and an orange glaze was an incredibly sinful dessert.

The restaurant is just what you would expect in an upscale French bistro. It is classy but at the same time very homey. The staff is mostly French as well, and that definitely added to the experience! We started with an amuse bouche of asparagus soup- the only way to describe it is it was really really asparagus-y in the best way! Next I had the corn soup and the boyfriend had the French onion soup. Both were excellent, the corn soup being a little lighter and sweeter and the French onion being more savory and rich. Next we split the filet and the cassoulet Toulouse. The filet was excellent, but we both agreed that the cassoulet was definitely the dish we would both order again. It was rich and comforting, full of tender lamb, duck, and sausage. I'm usually not a duck person either, but that duck was really good! We opted to go somewhere else more casual for dessert, but the desserts on the menu sound awesome and I'd definitely give them a try next time! The food was excellent, and to top it all off the prices were also very reasonable.

From the food to the service, be prepared for an enriching dining experience.  We had the 3-course prix fixe meal as part of Restaurant Week and each course was delectable.\n\nFirstly, the tomato basil amuse-bouche was creamy and had a balanced flavor, and went nicely with the warm French bread.\n\nCourse 1: Trio of Salmon\nNotes: The fish was delicate and fresh, and the balance of gravlax, tartare, and caviar made for a delicious salmon sampler plate.  The roe and fried capers added bursts of salty goodness, which paired incredibly well with the crisp micro greens, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and egg mimosa.  Presentation of the dish was also quite beautiful.\n\nCourse 2: Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin\nNotes: Pork was cooked to perfection: slightly pink in the center, incredibly moist, and very soft.  The bacon added smoky layers of flavor and combined well with the creamy parsnip pur\u00e9e and shaved brussel sprouts.  Sauce was sweet and complemented the savory richness of the proteins.\n\nCourse 3: Profiteroles\nNotes: The profiteroles were fluffy, stuffed with vanilla ice cream, and topped with a dark chocolate sauce.  Presentation of the 3 profiteroles was inviting.  \n\nAll three courses were fantastic in their own right--together, they make for a terrific gastronomic experience. \nThe SERVICE was absolutely impeccable.

The kobocha soup is slightly strange for my taste but enjoyable, and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was so large I barely finished it.

The trio of salmon must be the best one because of its freshness and flavor. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the Bouillbaisse. The sauce was tasty but along the way... it got very strong. At this point, I tried to avoid having too much sauce on the clams. My brother got the prime rib for two (you had to share with another individual) - I really enjoyed his meal more than mine. \n\nAs for dessert, my brother got the chocolate cake. He ended up not liking his dessert, which is odd because he loves chocolate cake. Maybe it was too rich? I got the Baked Alaska. It was so delicious! I don't have a sweet tooth and I was able to finish the whole thing. I must warn you: in the middle, it has coffee ice cream. It tastes very similar to a tiramisu cake. \n\nThe food between every meal was slow. But I think they were trying to encourage us to have conversations within the table. Which isn't so bad if you have a lot to say to each other. :) overall, I really enjoyed this place and would highly recommend it! Maybe call for a reservation ahead of time?", "author": "Sarah F."}

I wasn't expecting much, but I am so thrilled to say I was wrong. This place is what dining out is all about. It's not just about the appreciation of food, but the connection you make with your friends. \n\nWhen we walked in, we were personally greeted by the Chef. In fact, he earnestly greeted each and every party who entered his restaurant. He also said goodbye to us as we left, and sincerely asked for feedback. It was clear that the staff here have a true hearted pursuit for fantastic food.\n\nI had the three course vegetarian meal. My appetizer was the blue cheese turnover, followed by the vegetable napoleon with curried cauliflower sauce, and I finished with the french toast soaked in a rum butter. I have always been left disappointed with vegetarian french options, mainly because the idea is so bizarre in French culture. That is not the case here, every bite was an explosion of incredibly well balanced flavors. The attention to detail was superb. Service was brisk, timely, and well educated on the menu. \n\nSkip the other ridiculously priced French restaurants in San Francisco, and make it a necessity to eat here.

The first time I ordered quail stuffed with veal sweetmeat. I found the combination to be a little odd and the meat was disappointingly dry. The second time however, I ordered the duck two ways, which featured a tender duck leg and breast. It was phenomenal - tender and juicy with a rich flavor. The meat slid right of the leg bone, and the breast skin was cooked to a light crisp. \n\nDesserts here are delicious. I got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and apple tart. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was perfectly creamy with a delicate sweetness. The tart was great as well, though I felt the apple slices were a little soggy.

There's no restaurant I've been to that delivered a better overall experience than Chapeau. \n\nFood: 5/5 -- the best thing is probably that they focus on delivering the original flavors of the ingredients. They go low on salt and sugars and add a good mix of fresh spices and sauces where appropriate. Their vegetable are cooked to the point and match perfectly the way they are combined to a vegetarian dish or with meat. Duck, beef, pork are all cooked to perfection. Their filet steak is outstanding. They have a great selection of fresh sea food dishes which are, again, cooked to perfection. Most dishes are truly French due to the authentic seasoning and ideal pairing of vegetables, meats and sauces. Based on the season, they adjust their menu. Their deserts are excellent as well. Not too sweet and the flavors of the ingredients are always present. \n\nService: 5/5 -- best service I ever experienced. The chef and owner is out constantly to check on his guests. He doesn't just check because he has to, he does it because he truly cares. He's passionate about his work and extremely serious about the dining experience his restaurant delivers. And so is his staff. Tony is the head waiter and extremely professional, fun and attentive. Same as the owner, he loves his job. He is totally serious about the happiness of his customers. Many restaurants seem to pretend and try to be friendly and nice because they have to. But this restaurant really means it. \n\nAtmosphere: 5/5 -- wow. A classic French restaurant. Classical, simple but beautiful interior. Dim light and candles. The owner greats you at the door. The waiters and relaxed yet fast and extremely professional. They take so good care of you in a way where it just feels natural. If you stay long enough, the owner is down for a long talk on the bar way beyond usual business ours.\n\nThis place is perfection. It doesn't get better and more honest than that. Try this out and you'll have an amazing date night here that will easily last 3 hours or more.", "author": "Jonas G."}

We have been to Coi, Saison and many other restaurants in SF over the last several years and Chapeau did not act or present itself in a manner that was snobbish or with a heightened sense of self worth, but the quality of the food was actually better than any restaurant in the city. \n\nWe felt we were eating a home cooked French meal. \n\nWe ordered the three course meal and they brought us an extra dessert. \n\nThe wine menu was constructed thoughtfully with good current choices at different price points. \n\nWhen the chef came out to speak with us, it was in a totally unforced and natural way.

Omg omg omg.\n\nJk, of course I washed my hand. But this actually happened as he was explaining the significance behind the restaurant name, and I was very flattered. You don't see that kind of old school chivalry anymore.\n\nChapeau! is the quintessential French restaurant of San Francisco. I've heard wonderful things about the place since I was in high school and have no idea what took me so long to eat here. It wasn't until this year that I finally dined here with my boyfriend's family. $55 per person for 3 courses from their prix fixe menu, $65 for 4. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think there was an option to order dishes individually so don't say you weren't warned.\n\nThe complimentary cauliflower soup was a delightful opener to our meal. Simple, but very tasty. I ordered the escargots de bourgogne to start, which was wonderfully garlicky and delectably chewy. My bf's dad, a French cuisine enthusiast, ordered the sweetbreads-- a dish I've always been curious about because I've frequently seen it on tv and but have never really seen it on a menu. It was definitely interesting; to be honest, it tasted a lot like the Filipino delicacy balut lol. Not bad, though I think I'll stick to escargot; that's adventurous enough right? We also ordered some foie gras to share, which at most restaurants is my favorite part of the whole meal. This was no exception.\n\nFor my main course, I got the cassoulet de toulouse. REALLY filling. I can't even decide what my favorite part was-- the duck confit or the braised lamb shoulder. The sausage was good too. It's the perfect dish if you want to try a little of everything. Of course I forced my bf to get the filet mignon w/ bone marrow so I can pick off his plate. The bone marrow made each bite of steak melt in my mouth. Just delicious, buttery perfection.\n\nI ordered the nuage de noix for dessert, which I personally liked a lot more than the raved about basil napoleon. I really liked the contrasting textures of the nuts and meringue plus the hint of orange. The basil napoleon was kind of weird to the palette; you get that fruity bite with kiwi as the top note, then the pastry cream, and finally the lingering flavor of basil. Meh, felt like I was still eating an entree. However, of the desserts at our table, my favorite was the creme brulee. Classic.\n\nThe only downside of our meal was the wine that Mrs. Gardelle suggested, which was too young and acidic to truly enjoy with our meal. But they did give us complimentary dessert wine at the end. Overall, good French restaurant. 4 stars for the food, bonus points because the owner is a sweet man whose stories made for an interesting meal.

Another pleasant surprise: we were still able to get the prix fixe, although it was past 6 pm.  Sure, it's $55 for three courses (or $65 for four), but it's still a much better deal and you can try more of the menu. \n\nEverything came out so fresh, some of my boyfriend's dishes were literally boiling as they were set down on the table. In hindsight, they could probably dial it back a bit on that score. He had the cassoulet, packed with protein: duck confit, shredded lamb shoulder, and generous chunks of sausage. I am a constant sucker for duck, truffle oil, and stone fruit paired with savory. The Canard aux Peches was ridiculously perfect for me. Though it was for an extra charge, I'm glad I got the seared foie gras to start. It was delightfully creamy and rich yet balanced by the light texture and pears.\n\nMy boyfriend was torn over almost every dessert, finally deciding on and thoroughly enjoying the Baked Alaska. The only middling point of the meal for me was my dessert, the Basil Napoleon. The feuille layers were limp, and I regretted being too adventurous with basil in a dessert.\n\nFrom start to even moments before we got up to leave, our server was attentive. I was surprised he waited for me to come back to the table to taste my wine before pouring me a glass (I've only ever had this courtesy extended when buying a bottle), and that he folded our napkins every time we got up. The chef had been so gregarious in the beginning, we half expected him to say goodbye as we left. No more than thirty seconds after we remarked upon this did we hear him coming out the door, following us to say goodbye! I was pleasantly astonished he pulled me into bises when he heard me thank him and say good night in my poor French.\n\nIt was a lovely end to our anniversary, and the anniversary when I moved to France for a short bit.

I saw this restaurant from the awesome Stephanie on TV for SF Restaurant Week and had to try. \n\nVery interesting set-up and looks very secretive from the outside but it was a very nice experience once you are inside. They only had about a handful of twenty some small tables, I think, so big groups would probably need to be reserved way ahead by phone. I already had to reserve ours way ahead for an early weekend evening as I found out why when we came. All tables filled once we arrived at 5pm when it opened. They don't open for breakfast or lunch on the weekends. The place is actually not big and they do fill in the bar as well. Decor was nice and simple inside.\n\nThey do put on the menu to put your phone away which I tried to take my pictures quick with no flash. It was kinda dark inside so thank goodness for my iPhone focus made it brighter. \n\nAs for the service, our table was always cleaned by the bus boys when we were done and the waiter always asked how we were doing and was attending. Our waiter was helpful and friendly, too! \n\nWe ordered their 3-course meal for $55 to make things simple. My hubby and I ordered different meals to try everything. \n\nHubby:\nRed wine (excellent and not too dry)\nAppetizer - Pan Seared Day Boat Scallop (simple with pesto risotto but the lobster sauce made it excellent)\nMain course - Filet Minion (this is what should be ordered! It comes spinach, mushrooms and great sauce that compliments everything. It does come with bone marrow that was good and not salty.)\nDessert - French Toast (not your average French toast with raisins but sweet, crispy and sauce was excellent with ice cream on top)\n\nMyself:\n2013 sparking Brut (excellently chilled and good. I downed that too fast!)\nAppetizer - Trio of Salmon (my favorite of all as it's so good! I could have this all night! The tartare caviar with egg mimosa was so good with side tasting of capers and egg bits [not on menu].)\nMain course - Cassoulet de Toulouse (the full dish was not exactly what was on the menu or they might have less ingredients that they had to substitute. I chose this dish to be different as I usually do not like duck but this duck leg confit exceeded my expectations. It was moist and well flavored! Very good. It did come with Toulouse sausage which was good as well. It did not come with shredded lamb shoulder as on the menu but gave me a larger cut sausage that might be pork? It was still good thou. I would have preferred the lamb.)\nDessert - Chocolate Cake (oozing hot dark chocolate with a piece of plantain banana in the middle, the sauce spread tasted like coffee and vanilla ice cream with raisers in it. Very well made and very good.)\n\nEverything was good and well prepared. Quality and service was nothing less than expected. I will have to try it here again once my wallet can afford it again. I love these kind of dates where it's not about how much food you get but the quality and experience. Well deserved rating and we will be back some day...[32/100]", "author": "Edna G."}

I hate to leave a low review as my server was nice and I loved meeting the chef, who greets you with a kiss on the cheek! \n\nThere were three instances that seemed off for a $$$ restaurant, like receiving the wrong order/sending our dish to the wrong table twice, which honestly did not bother me.  But what really threw me off was the super snarky responses from who I presume was the busboy? I had already paid the bill and was at my table alone, packing my things away and waiting for my grandma and mom who were in the bathroom, when an employee came over and started folding my napkin into the cute little hat. I told him he didn't need to do that since we're leaving now. He responded, \"I know. Thanks for telling me how to do my job\". Super thrown off by his curt response, I awkwardly laughed and tried to rephrase what I said since it sounded like he thought I had said something offensive. He then responded, \"I know. Thanks for saving 30 seconds of my life\". Uhhh wtf?? Definitely not what you should be saying to a customer after they just spent $200 at your fancy pants restaurant. I can see how he could see it as telling him how to do his job, but I just don't see the point of dirtying your hands when we are leaving and my intentions were obviously nice!!\n\nPhew. Now the food. Food was 4 stars. The Restaurant Week menu offered a great deal and quality choices. I had the Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin, which was super tender and so juicy. The portion was great and I even had to pack half of it away. The Fish was also delicious and perfectly cooked--the skin tasted phenomenal. I also loved the Salmon Trio starter which is plated nicely. The fried capers were also a great touch as I usually don't like capers. \n\nI'm not sure I'd come back here due to the experience, but really do want to try their famous foie gras...", "author": "Carolyn L."}

Upon entering Chapeau, it is a small area closed off by velvet drapes...very similar to a night club.  My girlfriend and I arrived first, then 2 more, then 2 more....in a very small area.  The Maitre D' acknowledged all of us, checked us in, and kept all of us standing in a small tiny area.  \n\nOnce we were seated, everything changed for the better.  After our waiter (with a beautiful French accent) introduced the menu to us, and introduced a bottle of wonderful French wine, the night automatically got better.  \n\nFirst, a very warm gentleman walked up to our table and in a very friendly tone said \"I did not get a chance to say hi to you\" and shook all 3 of our hands.  We then realized it was the chef and owner Philippe Gardelle!!!  \n\nWe tried everything on the restaurant week menu.  The highlights for me for the trio of salmon (gravlax wrapped salmon tartare with caviar), saut\u00e9ed striped bass (tender fresh fish with creamy mashed potatoes), and the baked alaska (rum cake with coffee ice cream encased by a torched meringue).  \n\nOur bill came in a chapeau....hat!  :-).

While vacationing in San Francisco from New York, we were looking for a casual and friendly setting with excellent food, not a combination easily found. Chapeau! went far beyond our expectations on all counts. From the friendly greeting by Philippe to our delightful and insightful conversations with his wife Ellen, the evening flew by. Needless to say this was all helped by absolutely outstanding food prepared to perfection. The escargot, the trio of salmon appetizer, the main courses of scallops and rack of lamb easily surpassed all our expectations. And the desserts are to die for.

My guess is that I've either developed a taste/newfound appreciation for french food, didn't order the right food last time, and/or my expectation for fine dining is not a stringent as before (since I don't really do it as often, living too far away from SF).  \n\nAnyway, the dining experience was pretty outstanding.  I (unfortunately) was late, but they held our table for us, despite having a full house. Every dish I tried or ate was very tasty as well.

The red theme and line drawing of a woman holding a glass of red wine with a large chapeau tipped over her eyes is rather eye-catching. So I made a reservation and we came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. The interior was cramped and the dim orange lighting made it feel like even more of a tight squeeze. However, it looked nice with flowers on the tables, white tablecloths, and a small bar.\nWe both went with the 3-course menu (currently $44.50), which was not a bad price considering it costs about $10 more than an entree. \n\nSeared Foie Gras:\nThe plate had a very nice sized slab of foie gras. The slab was accompanied with neatly arranged apple slices and some microgreens over a gastrique drizzled on the plate. The outer part was slightly over-seared and a little rubbery. It was still deliciously rich and fatty, while the sauce and the apple slices added sweetness and crunch to the dish.\n\nFrench Onion Soup:\nor Traditional Onion Soup as they call it, was good. Mr. Joy ordered this and I was surprised he liked it even after he ate all the cheese and was left with caramelized onions in broth.\n\nBouillabaisse - Striped Bass, Thai Snapper, Alaskan Halibut Cheeks, P.E.I. Mussels & Manila Clam, Poached in a Fish Fumet, Fondue Proven\u00e7ale, Croutons with Gruy\u00e8re & Rouille :\nGood, I just wish there was more of it. There were a few pieces of fish embedded in the soup, about 3 mussels and clams each. The fish broth was light, but savory. The 'crouton' was actually toasted bread with shredded gruyere. \n\nCanard au Miel & aux \u00c9pices - Duck Breast, Celery Root Puree, Honey & Spiced Duck Jus:\nDelicious duck breast went very well with the sauce. Maybe because I'm Asian, I just think it would be even better if the skin was broiled until crunchy. \n\nFrench Toast - Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Hazelnut Cr\u00e8me Anglaise:\nDelicious take on French toast. The toast was so soft, almost a custard texture. Salted caramel ice cream is one of my favorite ice cream flavors. \n\nProfiteroles:\n3 profiteroles covered in thick chocolate sauce and almond slivers. These were okay, but the puff pastry was a little stale, possibly left in the fridge for a while. The chocolate sauce was cold. I've definitely had better profiteroles. \n\nThe prices aren't bad for French fare, but certainly getting up there. The food was pretty good. It would be nicer if there was a little more room to spread out. If I find myself back here again, I may try the filet mignon with bone marrow. It looks like a good price compared to most other restaurants.", "author": "Joy W."}

I think you HAVE to get either a 3-course or a 4-course meal. They don't price any of their items individually. I went with the 3 course: french onion soup, sea bass with oxtail, and a chocolate cake. Everything was delicious!! The french onion soup was probably the best I've ever had. I usually find them to be too salty, but this was was just right! The sea bass was amazing as well. The oxtail wasn't as tender as I was hoping for, but the mashed potatoes that came with the dish complemented it nicely! The molten chocolate cake at the end was made perfectly! The chocolate inside was just the right molten texture, and the flavors went so well with the rum ice cream.\n\nAt $55 per person for a 3-course meal, this place is a steal!

The food is good standard French cuisine and that's not meant to be a criticism.  I don't think they're trying to push any boundaries and that's fine; they do deliver on great food.\n\nThey have the usual menu along with a 3 or 4 course pre fixe meal option which allows you to choose something from each course on the regular menu.  If you opt for the pre fixe, you'll just get smaller portions.\n\nWe went there on 5/10 and had a great time except for a couple bumps.  The bartender was doing double-duty as our waiter.  As a result, we were left waiting to order and had to flag down someone.\n\nThe larger issue was the specials.  They told us the specials but didn't tell us the price.  We eventually ordered the special entree - prime rib for two.  I figured it'd be up there in price as it was properly cooked, well presented, etc but when we got the bill, we learned that it was $140!

If you're looking for the French Laundry, why are you on Clement? Otherwise, you've found one of the best tiny little French restaurants in the entire Bay Area. Prices are very reasonable ($55 for three courses or $65 for four), and portions are excellent. Also, if I may gush a little, the bread is so wonderfully soft and flavorful on the inside, yet crusty on the exterior that we had about 2.5 baskets worth it.\n\nStarters - let's talk about how hot, well-seasoned (not overly greasy or salty), and perfectly composed their onion soup is. Not only does the bread inside hold its texture after the cooking process, the cheese stays in the perfect chemical state and doesn't just melt away or coagulate. Escargot? Classic. Definitely not for someone who shies away from garlic and oil, but the flavors coming off of this plate. C'est bien.\n\nMains - Although we didn't order the steak and bone marrow for two, the chef came out to personally slice it for other tables, and the smell coming off of this thing was ridiculous. Can I also say, perfectly cooked, rare steak? We had the bacon-wrapped tenderloin and bouillabaisse. Again, perfectly cooked all around. No briny flavors coming off tender mussels and clams. A nice hunk of flaky fish at the bottom, and a very decently braised scallop on top. The tenderloin comes with this creamy mashed potato side that you will melt with when you put it in your mouth.\n\nDessert - WOW. Real creme brulee with vanilla bean inside the vanilla bean custard. Not overly burnt caramelized sugar at the top and just a creamy interior. The real show stopper is the french toast. Again, imagine a great piece of bread that's been covered in egg yolk and seared and then re-covered in hazelnut bechamel and salted caramel ice cream. Top that off with a grape and a candle because it was my birthday.\n\nHow does the night end? Same way it begins. The chef says, \"Au revoir. A bientot!\" and gives us a handshake and goodbye kiss. What a meal. What service. What ambiance. Oh, and we had some wines and such.", "author": "Danny C."}

We checked out their early bird $40 special but didn't see anything we really wanted. We ended up ordering our own entrees on the menu. I ordered the stew with duck and lamb and she ordered the duck confit. For appetizers, we ordered the onion soup and the foie gras.\n\nNow onto the food:\n\nThe foie gras was delicious. I was so soft and fatty. Melted in my mouth. \n\nThe onion soup was basic. Not bad but not amazing. \n\nMy stew dish had good flavor overall. Portion was pretty big. I was quite disappointed with the tenderness of the meat (or lack there of). The lamb was quite dry and I had to compensate with added some of the stew to it for extra moisture. The sausage was good but nothing spectacular. Duck pieces were ok, really nothing special. \n\nMy friend's duck confit was ok. It had decent flavor but also quite dry.\n\nAlso ordered a Bourdeaux wine from France (half bottle was $42). Quite pricey.\n\nOverall the food was ok but maybe I had higher expectations since it's so raved about over Yelp. We didn't order dessert because we were pretty full.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-26", "description": "Chapeau! has been a gem in the Richmond district since the 90's.  I remember dining here as a kid way back at their original location on 15th and Clement.  For the excellent food and value, there's very few like them.\n\nI have always liked Chef Philippe, he's very personable and even came out tonight to greet my GFs and I.  Shook each of our hands along w/ many other patrons and greeted everyone with a smile.  His food - excellent as always and if you have ever been to Chapeau!, then you would also know that his servings are very generous.\n\nWith that being said, it was no surprise that I had leftovers of my duck confit.  I literally had my whole duck leg left and when our server came to clear our plates, I asked him if I could box it up.  He literally looked at me with a \"are you kidding me\" look?  Shocking, I never experienced such rude service here before and plenty of people get boxes for their leftovers here, with their cute foil wrapping with a handle.  I didn't think what I was asking for was out of the ordinary.  I was still in disbelief and thought maybe he did not hear me clearly or understand me so I asked politely again if I could get a box.  The same \"what\" look...TWICE!!  I was sitting on the booth side and my GF who was sitting across from me totally saw his rude expression through the mirror behind me.  Not only was I full, but I was completely mortified at this point.  I am not a confrontational person and definitely did not want to make a scene, especially not over a box, but I also didn't want the food to go to waste.  Since I couldn't get a box that I had kindly asked for, it would have been shameful if I left a whole duck leg with TONS of meat wasted on my plate.  My GF sitting to my left told me to just take my time eating it, they are in no rush.  It was embarrassing to say the least.  I ate way more than I wanted/needed to and by then, our dining experience here was ruined.  \n\nBy the time our desserts came (which was fabulous, especially the French Toast), we were itching to leave.  It was such a shame!  My GF wanted to dine here one last time before she moves away, but I felt so bad she is leaving the city with such a bad impression of Chapeau!  \n\nI know good help is hard to find these days but Chef Philippe does not deserve waitstaff like the gentleman we encountered tonight to ruin his establishment that he has worked so hard maintaining.  My apologies for the low stars but given that they were featured on the Food Network's Mystery Diners back in 2014, Chef Philippe should know that his front end staff is lacking while he is working so hard in the kitchen.  \n\nI wholeheartedly still recommend Chapeau! for their food.  $40 for their 3-course early bird special (5-6pm daily, except Fridays and Saturdays) is a total steal.  Your stomach will leave happy from the delicious food here but don't expect too much in terms of service.", "author": "Janetto L."}

And finally got to eat here last Saturday, thanks to a lovely surprise dinner from the boy.\n\nWe both ended up ordering the prix fixe menu with appetizer, entree, tasting fish, and dessert. In retrospect, this was WAY more food than I ever wanted, but I'm glad we picked it if only for the delicious tasting fish. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the trio of salmon and salade landaise. The salmon was fresh, but I enjoyed the duck salad quite a bit more. The different versions of duck (smoked duck breast, duck confit, and duck liver pate) in the salad were all wonderfully flavored, and the frisee provided a good complement and palate cleanser for all the different tastes. The potato chips on top were a nice touch, too. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" ended up being a delectable scallop surrounded by a creamy pesto risotto. Probably the best part of the meal, to be honest -- highly recommend!  \n\nOur entrees were the skate wing and the cassoulet de toulouse. The skate wing was fresh and tender, but the flavors weren't as complex as I would've liked. The lamb shoulder in the cassoulet was to die for! Juicy with a great texture and hearty mix of flavors... I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it. \n\nBy the time we ordered our desserts, I felt like my stomach was going to explode. As a result, I only ate a few bites of my French toast with salted caramel ice cream, but the few bites I had were amaaaaaazing. The French toast was warm, fresh, and fluffy. The ice cream itself was dense and creamy (and maybe a little too sweet). We also ordered the trio of sorbet (lemon, blackberry, and mango). The sorbets tasted light and natural -- we liked the blackberry flavor the most. \n\nOur waiter was attentive, helpful, and very French. He helped us pick a Santenay pinot noir as a companion to our meal. The wine was flowery and not too heavy, with a flavor that easily permeated throughout the meal. Yum! \n\nMy only gripe about this restaurant is that they sat us VERY close to the next table. There was probably an inch of space between us. Our neighbors were also very loud (thanks to the level of noise in the room, you have to speak up to be heard across the table), which definitely detracted from my experience. Though the lighting is dark and the decor is romantically European, Chapeau! may not be the best location for a quiet, intimate dinner. \n\nI am a sucker for cute little perks like the glittery hat they place your bill in (chapeau means hat in French), and getting to meet the chef at the end of the meal. We left the restaurant somewhat abruptly, and the chef even chased us outside to make sure he got a chance to meet us.

Loved this creamy and rich soup, with all the various flavors and slight texture from the croutons. I had a bite of my bf's salade landaise and that was refreshing and tasty as well.\n- Pan seared scallop on pesto risotto with lobster sauce - OUR FAVORITE of the night!! Scallop may have been a teensy teensy TEENSY bit overcooked, but it was still amazing with the pesto risotto! The sauce just made everything even more moist and flavorful. Delish!!\n- For our main, I had the sauteed striped bass & braised oxtail on garlic mash and the bf had the filet mignon with bone marrow. Both delicious and complimented everything on the dish very well! (I will say that I much preferred the filet mignon entree over the striped bass one.) \n- Creme brulee and tarte alsacienne for dessert! I wish the creme brulee was more on the wamer side, because mine was just room temperature. Regardless, it was yummy! My bf loved his tarte alsacienne and finished every bite! \n\nOverall, had a great experience dining here!

They offer their regular menus but they also offer their pre-fixed menu which is a cheaper alternative is you plan on ordering 3-4 courses.\n\nSome Soup: Not sure what it was but we started off with a shot of some soup they gave us. It was pretty cheesy and delicious.\n\nTrio of Salmon: Very good appetizer. It was super light and refreshing and definitely made me hungrier. \n\nPorcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads: I love sweetbreads and these didn't disappoint. Very rich and buttery. I wish there was more! Definitely recommend this dish - one of my favorites of the night.\n\nPrince Edward Island Mussels: This was bigger than I thought. It came with a ton of mussels that were not overcooked. Fries where thin, nice and crispy.\n\nWild Caught Skate Wing in a Brown Butter: Flaky and nicely cooked although the portion was a little small in my opinion. I saw many other photos and they looked much much bigger than what we got. It was also on the salty side.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Striped Bass & Braised Oxtail: This dish was just salty in every note. Definitely not recommend.\n\nRissotto and Scallops: This was their special that day and it was pretty good. Rissotto was nice and rich and the scallop was cooked to perfection.\n\nBasil Napoleon: Not sure why but I didn't enjoy this dessert. The combination of flavors just didn't work for me... it was unique and interesting though.\n\nWarm Valrhona Chocolate Cake: Pretty dense and rich. Recommend sharing.\n\nFrench Toast with Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Hazelnut cr\u00e8me Anglaise: Hands down the best dessert of the night. The French Toast was amazing and what made it better was the salted caramel ice cream.\n\nOverall, pretty good place for a special occasion or date. I wouldn't mind coming back for desserts. Definitely get the pre-fixed menu courses as it is cheaper. Food was good and service was good.", "author": "Juan F."}

After a year of not going, however, I decided to give this place a try again.\nIt's definitely different, the owner used to greet every guest with a warm kiss on the cheek (my grandma found it disturbing so she hated him), but now he doesn't even appear.\nAlso, the food is definitely not AS good as before, but still better than many other french restaurants.\n\n-Trio of Salmon: still my favorite appetizer! Salmon tartar wrapped wrapped in smoked salmon, with salmon roe and bits of boiled egg as well as fried capers around it. Very good, very delicious. All the different flavors and textures made me so happy.\n\n-Roasted Duck Breast: served with polenta with white truffle oil, bok choy, and spice duck jus. The polenta was simply amazing. Very smooth and creamy, but no truffle taste. I did not care for the bok choy lol (ew veggies). The duck was very tender, but I feel like it can be a little less cooked. Still a great dish though!\n\n-Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin: served with parsnip puree, caramelized apple, kale, and apple calvados sauce. This pork tenderloin is indeed very tender. The sauce definitely goes with it, giving it a very subtle sweetness. The meat wasn't dry, ugh so good.\n\n-French Toast: served with salted caramel ice cream and hazelnut creme anglaise. The flavors are great, but that was it. The french toast was drenched in what seemed like a sea of hazelnut soup. Very soggy. The texture simply made me not want to eat it.\n\n-Basil Napoleon: pinapple, mango, banana, kiwi, and stawberry bits with champagne-citrus pastry cream and feuille de bric. This is the go-to dessert if you want something light and refreshing. Just a warning, sometimes the mangos aren't ripe, but that's the only negative. \n\n-Tahitienne Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee: still my favorite dessert. You can never go wrong with this. Very creamy and vanilla-y! \n\nThe service is still great, however, one of the staff members decided to \"fluff\" the tablecloth for the table beside us, blowing a gust of cold air and some dust over to my mom and I -___- Like, why?", "author": "Jackie T."}

It was a long week and I was looking forward to this evening to be happening!  My boyfriend made reservations and they seated us at the corner in the back with comfy cushioning as seating.  The lights were dimly lit for the romantic setting and with the splendid entrees that kept coming out, I was whisked away to drowsiness and eventually to almost sleeping during the dessert end.  It was very pleasant.  Don't get me wrong!\n\nWe opted for the Prix Fixed (includes appetizer, entree and dessert) with the Trou Normand for the cleansing and tasting fish.  To start off with appetizers, we ordered up the Salade Landaise, which was the Frisee salad with delicately sliced, thin duck confit and smoked duck magret.  It was wonderful!  As for the Trio of Salmon with tartare, bits of sprinkled caviar, egg mimosa, fried capers and creme fraiche, it was well made, but I liked the flavor of the duck better!\n\nFor wine, we ordered up their French Red Wine Bordeaux, which complimented well for all the meals ordered.  \n\nTheir grilled scallop with risotto, was delightfully delicious!  I loved it.  Period.  I ordered up their Cassoulet de Toulouse, which was their braised lamb shoulder for the entree, and it was huge!  Nice and tender, that plate can surely fill 2 people.  If you can't finish that lamb entree (I don't blame you), do pack it to go!  They use foil for packaging and they shape the foil into a swan-like shape and it creates a handle for you to hold it!  Pretty creative over boxes!  Their Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with parsnip puree, was decent, but not the best entree, I would say.\n\nWe got lost in translation for the French desserts, so we asked our waiter which ones we should get.  He didn't steer us in the wrong direction at all.  Their Sauteed Fig in Red Wine Soup dessert, was one of a kind!  Something I have never tried before and worthy of getting!  The fig and wine with vanilla ice cream, complimented warmly with each other!  The taste of fig, vanilla blend and wine, was a wonderful mix that I would have not thought of stirring up!  As for their Tarte Du Jour, which the desciption was not on the menu, but just the name itself on the menu, was superb!  It reminded me of a chocolate puff pastry, but up it by times ten!

My family and I had a reservation for this place at around 9pm on a Thursday night and when we got there, it was packed. I don't think people could've gotten in without a reservation. Anyway, we were seated in a cozy corner table and promptly given menus, after which our waiter came to greet us. He explained the menu, which I thought was very nice, and left us to make our decisions. I was pretty torn on what to get, but I ultimately decided on the 3 course -- green asparagus veloute (appetizer), raviolo (main course), and nuage de noix (dessert).\n\nI really can't say more than that I absolutely loved the food. It came out in a timely fashion, starting with the green asparagus veloute that completely blew me away. I'm normally not a fan of soup appetizers, but I would gladly have this one every day for the rest of my life if I could (ok, maybe not but you get the point). The raviolo was also really really good. The puree inside was fantastic and the flavor was stunning. I cleared both the appetizer and main course out completely; I swear not a trace of anything was left when I had finished. The dessert was also good, but I was so full by that point that I unfortunately couldn't finish it (much sadness).\n\nOverall, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this place if you're looking for quality food at a decent price.

For his repeat we brought two very close friends and it was a disaster from the start.  We waited a very long time to place our orders (25 min).

My partner received his foie and his snails.  They removed those dishes and they brought the scallops for three people but now I got my appetizer - a salad.  I did not receive my scallop.  I NEVER actually got my scallop.   another long wait and the entrees arrived.   My Filet was terrible.  Small portion over cooked (I had asked for medium rare).   Really pretty tasteless.  After they cleared the plates we waited very long time.  Finally I said something to the waiter who was at the bar chatting with another guest.  Then finally we received our desserts - three were OK - nothing exceptional.   However the chocolate molten cake was completely burned. I couldn't believe it.  And it was topped with moth eaten pieces of mint!!  We called over the waiter and eventually the chef came to the table.  He apologized and then left.

After tasting French cuisine in Paris, I believe their emphasis on high quality ingredients makes the French style of cooking the best in the world.\n\nSo far, as of 2014, Chapeau! is the only French restaurant in the bay area that has met and surpassed my expectations.\n\n-Service: Courteous, charismatic, and sincere service.\n\n-Atmosphere: I like how it's not too fancy and the people here aren't overdressed. Not intimating for a high end restaurant. Also great for groups. But better for one-on-one's. Although one thing that bothered me was that it's extremely loud here. I'm not sure if it's the people that are really loud or the room just echos, or both. It's also very crowded. You're literally bumping elbows with the people sitting next to you. Not a bad thing, but not the best if you'd rather have a more intimate and quiet atmosphere.\n\nThe Food:\n-Mussels in white wine sauce- Plenty of sauce that gave it unique flavors.\n-Traditional French onion soup- Best French onion soup I've had. I love how they cover it with real and thick cheese. It's to die for. *Drools.\n-Fries- Comes with two unique sauces. Really good.  \n-Tomato soup with complimentary bread- I loved the tomato soup.

As others have stated, service was slow from the start even though we were there when they first opened for dinner service.  Several times we asked the hostess and bus boys for someone to explain us the menu to expedite our questions and menu choices, they do not communicate with the one server who appeared short handed on this evening.  The restaurant started to get packed, and we were looking forward to the food.\n\nHad the four course menu:\n\n- Foie gras: average, its a cut of your typical foie gras but on soggy bread and a slice of apple.  Felt a bit old in its style and taste.  \n\n- Mesclun Salad w/ fried camembert:  really good, refreshing and balanced.  \n\n- Cassoulet:  stick to your bones type stew, tasty but nothing special\n\n- Nuage de Noix:  light and refreshing, preferred it over the Basil Napolean and Baked Alaska\n\nFor the value, it's a really good option for those wanting to do a pre fixe menu on a lower pricing alternative and to receive such in the Richmond neighborhood.  It is one of the only French restaurants in the area, so I can understand the draw.

I really enjoyed how the employees have fun while they are working, and the feel is not stuffy or uptight at all. \n\nI recommend the Trio of Salmon (great texture), Filet Mignon, Seafood Bouillabaisse, and the Baked Alaska. The Seafood Bouillabaisse was delicately made and very good. Usually I am weary of ordering seafood because restaurants do not always have the freshest options and it does not taste as great, but here it was delicious. The dessert topped it off - my boyfriend and I shared the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the baked alaska. The baked alaska was wonderful because it had the whole shebang (ice cream, merengue, cake, almonds) the only thing missing was that it was not flaming.

However, the food here was just average, the service was incredibly slow, and the overall resturaunt felt crowded and way too loud. I tried the duck and peaches entree and it was pretty good but a tad bit pricier then I would have judged it to be. The French Toast dessert was totally not..how should I say, well presented? It was good for the first few bites but it was overly sweet and just soggy because it was sitting in a bath of sugar (melted ice cream + maybe whipped cream?). The creme bruelle dessert was not bad but pretty sweet as well and someone else who ordered the baked Alaska also thought it was way too sweet and didn't taste good.

I honestly didn't expect such a fancy restaurant to be located here.  \n\nWe were seated in the bar area where it was noisy and super cramped.  It honestly took forever to get service since there was only the bartender that was serving us.  I was already in a very sour mood so I wasn't happy, but once my boyfriend explained how badly he messed up to the bartender, after that he was a wonderful waiter to us.  He suggested us to do a chef's special pre-fix that wasn't even on the menu.  Why not? I deserved a VERY fancy dinner.\n\nBottle of a 2006 Bordeaux Superieur Senailhac: I really needed this bottle of wine.  It went absolutely perfect with our filet mignon and it was rich enough in flavor to compliment the meat.\nDuck Confit Salad w/ a slice of foie gras: I'm a straight up sucker for anything duck and I got a slice of foie gras since the bartender heard that I loved it.\nEscargot: Super buttery and chewy.  Delicious.\nFilet Mignon with bone marrow with a side of potatoes au gratin: The presentation was excellent when served upon us.  \nBaked Alaska: I've been searching for a restaurant that made the best Baked Alaska and they've seriously nailed it here.\n\"Floating\" Island: I'm simply amazed at how they made this dessert. The sugar dome was beautiful and delicious.  The \"custard\" portion was creamy and rich.  The sauce was heavenly.\n\nThe chef was absolutely delightful.

I guess I'll try...\n\nWent here for a friend's birthday. She has a fancy for French cuisine, and this place seemed most reasonable in terms of prices compared to other places we looked at. It was a party of five, and for the most part, we all got something different. We all got the 3-course menu because it honestly seemed like the best deal.\n\nLet me start with the bread. IT WAS AMAZING. The bread was baked with a crunchy crust and super soft middle. With the butter, it paired up perfectly. For appetizer, I got the soup that had a crab cake (I can't rememeber what the name of it was). The soup was PERFECT. It was almost like a tomato cream soup, but was really light. I swear I could've eaten like, 5 bowls of that. Great flavor. One of my friends got the tasting of fish and it was mostly salmon, but was super fresh.\n\nFor entree, I got the filet mignon, medium rare. I was debating between that and the lamb shoulder, but my gut just went with good old beef. It was cooked perfectly; true medium rare. Just enough red juice was oozing, and the meat was tender. It came with diced potatoes and mushrooms, but those got pretty salty once it soaked in the sauce for too long. The filet mignon with the sauce was mouth-watering, on the other hand. It was seriously one of the most tender cuts I've had, and incredibly well made.\n\nFor dessert, we all got something different. I got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but had a taste of the French toast, chocolate cake, baked Alaska, and trio sorbet. French toast was a little too sweet for me, chocolate cake cake was good but super rich (so I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it), trio sorbet tasted like the real fruit (mango, lemon, and black currant, but black currant tasted a bit spiked), and the baked Alaska definitely had a strong rum taste (my tolerance is pretty low since I rarely drink, so others may think otherwise). My creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was not too sweet, and the portion was a huge size. The layer of sugar wasn't perfect since it didn't cut my mouth as I bit into a bite,  and the consistency of the cream part wasn't too thick.\n\nWe walked out of there STUFFED, but our stomachs were definitely happy. It's a cute little restaurant, and definitely a great place to have a nice dinner without breaking the bank. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

You really can't go wrong with what you choose. Everything is prepared with thoughtfulness and skill. Just make sure you have room for everything, because the portions are no joke.\n\nFor appetizer, I opted for veal sweetbreads. A heavy choice to start with, but I couldn't resist the mushroom sauce. Surprisingly, it did not fill me up. The flavors were wonderful.\n\nFor entree, I decided to go on the lighter side - with the skate in browned butter - instead of a heavier meat. It was a great choice. The fish was flaky and the sauce was not heavy at all.\n\nDessert was a challenge - everything looked delicious but how much can I actually eat?

It has always been a great experience, all around, except for last Sunday night.  I will not be coming back here.  There are too many choices here to waste my money and time here. \n\nDinner reservation was at 6:30pm.  We order around 6:45pm.  3 of us order the 3-course prix fixed and one order the 4-course with mussels for the table to share.  At 8pm, after the appetizers and mussels, we are still waiting for our main course, after about 30 minutes passed from the time we finished the mussels.  We really didn't have a waiter, the owner took our order (now come to think of it, she was taking orders from all the tables) and it was hard to catch her attention so I asked the receptionist to check on our order.  As you would expect, when you ask about your order, the answer is it will be out in a minute and it was.  How coincidental right.  3 of us ordered the scallops and my bf order the filet mignon.  All the plates were hot but that's about all that is hot.  The scallops were lukewarm.  My bf ordered his steak medium rare.  The center of the steak wasn't even pink so it wasn't even medium, it was well done.  When I mentioned this to the owner, she did not apologize, she said, we can make you another one - I immediately said no thank you fearing it will take another half an hour.  AND what is the point of ordering your steak 2 hours ago and have it come out not even close to the way you ordered it?  Then she started explaining why we didn't get our main course for so long.  The first thing she said was, you guys ordered the mussels (so it is our fault) and we wanted to make sure you were done with the mussels before your entree came out (how long do you think it takes 4 people to finish 20 or so mussels and we were waiting for 30 minutes after we were done with the mussels) and the last thing she said was we have a small kitchen - um ok, either she meant the kitchen is physically small or that the kitchen staff is small or short handed - either expand the kitchen, hire more people or make your dining room small, if you can't handle a full dining room.    \n\nWe got a free dessert which i don't know what it is supposed to show - we all ordered dessert, didn't need another one.  The filet on the other hand, is $34 plus fois gras, another $15, is a $50 dish, that is over-cooked.\n\nI can't stand incompetence and then people don't own up to it.", "author": "Jasmine L."}

For the first course, 2 escargots, 1 salmon trio, and 1 roasted chestnut soup.  I would've liked to have a taste of the soup as I love roasted chestnut, but I barely even got a second to capture a pic of it before it was devoured so it must be good.  You can not go wrong with escargots which I love served the traditional way in herbed butter so you can dip your bread into the melted herb butter after you eat your escargots.  They were so good that even the kid in a neighboring table was tempted by his mom to try it and ended up eating not 1 but 3 of them.  Granted he had no clue what they really were, it was refreshing to see a child being open to trying new foods willingly.  Salmon trio was also a nice combo of the salted capers, egg, and salmon but could've used more chips to scoop up the yummy mixture.  \n\nEntrees consisted of 2 skate wings, 1 mussel, and 1 pork tenderloin.  The skate wing was very tender and melts in your mouth but I do like my fish with more texture which is more of a personal preference than a reflection of the chef.  I absolutely loved the mussel dish and would probably get that myself next time.  The wine sauce is so flavorful that I ended up probably consuming almost an entire basket of bread myself sopping up every bit of juicy goodness.  The person who got the pork tenderloin really enjoyed it but since I usually like my pork cooked more than medium, I personally did not try it.  \n\nDessert was 2 cr\u00e8me brulees which were a good sized cr\u00e8me brulee and 2 French toasts.  I am so glad that I read Yelpers raving about the French toast as it was so good I ate the whole thing myself without sharing a single bite.  The \"bread\" was soft and moist with the salted caramel ice cream melting a perfect puddle into it and the whole thing surrounded by a hazelnut sauce.  So good, so good, so good!! \n\nAmbiance:  The current location is not as crowded as their old one which I really like not being so close that you can eat off the plate of the person in the next table.  Too much temptation especially since everything looks so good.  I love how Philippe comes by every table to shake hands making you feel like he is welcoming you into his own home for a decadent dinner party.  True to form of European dining, you are not rushed through your courses, nor do they come out on top of each other, giving you a chance to digest your food and enjoy a leisurely dinner with good company and good conversation.  So allocate about 2 hours for your 3 course.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

On the other hand, it's a little bit too small and cozy (it didn't help that we crammed 7 people at a 5 people table as well), so don't bring your big groups here.\n\nHowever, kudos to them for making it work for our big reservation. We did make a reservation for 7, but as these things go, not everyone arrived at the same time. I'm pretty grateful they still accommodated us and whipped up an amazing meal.\n\nThey have prix fixe menus -- you can pick 3 or 4 items from the menu, with a fixed price. This makes it slightly easier to narrow down what you want within each category. I started with the roasted chestnut soup -- perfectly creamy, great start to the meal. Then I had a striped bass and braised oxtail, and the jus with the potatoes are just perfect. I ended the meal with a delicious lemon tart, probably one of the best I've had.\n\nOf course, their wine and cocktails are delicious as well. Don't forget to order some to go with the fabulous meal!\n\nThis is definitely one of the best French restaurants I have dined at, without all the fuss of higher end restaurants.

Combining that with our love to EAT (note we are NOT overweight) we decided to try and just throw some darts against the wall and hope that Yelp helped point us in the right direction.  I'm happy to say that is EXACTLY what happened.  So much so, that we will be returning to Chapeau for another meal during our short 3 night stay up here.  Not only is the food exceptional, but the service is STELLAR.  Sure, in LA we're used to disgruntled aspiring actors and musicians usually serving us with their thoughts in other places.  But don't let that take away from the amazing dining experience that comes from an incredible marriage of both food and service.  \n\nWe chose to do a 3 course menu with a foie gras addition as a starter.  I had the duck salad which, as someone who lived many years in France in my 20's, can say was the most exquisite duck salad i have ever tasted.  She had a chestnut soup which was so divine we used the incredible french bread they serve to swoop up every drop.  For the main courses, we shared the snapper/oxtail and the short rib pasta special.  Both were amazing but the snapper/oxtail dish should NOT be missed.  For dessert, we chose a chocolate cake and profiteroles, both obviously amazing (what high end French place can't make good dessert?) and they brought us some French Toast dessert which was quite honestly the best thing I've been served at the end of a meal in perhaps my entire lifetime.\n\nLet me reinforce I have LIVED many years in France, been to LOADS of French restaurants, am NOT affiliated with the owner and being forced to write an amazing review, and plan to go back tomorrow night.

Since we have so many great places including restaurants here in the SF bay where we can just have a nice relaxing night, why travel elsewhere? It was a Friday night, and the city was expected to be crowded. Fortunately, we were able to reserve a table with Chapeau! at a reasonable time slot. (Not something like 9:00pm)  \n\nFood: 5/5\nWe ordered the foie gras as appetizer. Since this was the first time I have foie gras, I didn't know what to expect. All I can is that it was really delicious! I also think the portion is perfect to be shared by two people, because the liver is so rich in flavor. I also like it is served with slices of apple, the freshness of the apple made a good balance with the foie gras' richness. We had the scallop risotto and the duck breast for entr\u00e9e, both dishes were beautifully presented and very delicious. Personally I like the risotto better as the freshness of the scallop went extremely well with the creamy risotto. Lastly, for dessert, we had the chocolate lava cake with the rum raisin ice-cream, and I ordered a half glass of Riesling wine to go with the dessert. Both the chilliness of the ice-cream and the wine paired very well with the rich chocolate, very satisfied! \n\nPrice/Value: 5/5\nI think for a fine French cuisine, Chapeau! is very reasonably priced. You know how sometimes fine dining restaurants will give an impression that you are paying high price but you don't even feel full or satisfy. Not the case with Chapeau!. In fact, we both feel really full with some left over duck breast, and the bill was actually slightly lower than what I was expecting. \n\nServices: 5/5\nBoth the hostess and our server were very friendly, and our server was very polite and very knowledgeable on the menu. Great services! \n\nChapeau! truly is a gem in the city in my opinion. Great food and services at a reasonably price, and I also like the ambience which is classy but casually relax at the same time. I definitely recommend Chapeau! and I can't wait to go back!", "author": "James N."}

Let's just say that the dinner I had at Chapeau! was one of the latest dinners I've ever had in my life--I'm definitely guilty of being extremely HANGRY by the time we got seated around 9:50pm for our 9:45pm reservation. \n\nI can see why this quaint little restaurant was packed on a Saturday night, and my friend who made the reservation said she had trouble booking a table for us a week+ in advance. Chapeau! definitely reminds me of homestyle French cooking w/ a unique San Francisco twist to it. \n\nAll 6 of us ordered from the prix fixe menu-- which was absolutely SUCH a deal (3 courses for $44.50) Wowzers! \n\nFor my appetizer, I chose the Trio of Salmon- which I thought was on the saltier side, but still delish nonetheless. The salmon tasted quite smokey and overall it reminded me of an Asian fusion inspired dish.\n\nFor the entree I chose the Canard au Miel & aux \u00c9pices. THIS, was the highlight of the meal. I mean, if I would go back to Chapeau!, I would most likely just order this entree and be an extremely happy camper. Now, I love eating duck, especially with the way it is prepared in French cuisine. However, the overall portions at this restaurant are HUGE, and I had to struggle to finish the last 4 pieces of this entree...but I did anyway, and felt like a champ! \n\nThe palate was great and I believe reminded me of cauliflower. It was creamy and I think at this point, filled me up. \n\nFor dessert, I picked the Baked Alaska- Disclaimer: this was the first baked alaska I'd had in my life, yeah-- where have I been right? Anyway, it was good, but not spectacular. I tried my friend's profiteroles--and those, my fellow Yelpers, were AMAZING. I was swept up to cloud 9 by those profiteroles. Heck, I'd probably eat a dozen at one sitting. They really are just that good!! \n\nI think overall, the portions were huge and satisfying, and the hospitality was excellent. The Chef made sure to greet us at the door as we were waiting to get seated (arriving 15 min earlier than the reservation) and proceeded to give each one of us a hug and kisses on the cheek as we left (which I heard is a thing from one of my coworkers), which I found wonderfully adorable. Oh, and on top of giving my friend a candle with her dessert, they also gave us a complimentary French Toast and Basil Napoleon. I didn't have room in my stomach to try the French Toast, but judging from my friends' ooo's and ahh's, they seemed really happy which was wonderful. The Basil Napoleon was extremely fresh and fruity, and my friend's creme brulee came in the biggest ramskin (in terms of diameter) that I had ever seen in a restaurant. I was quite impressed with the plating and presentation of the dishes. Chapeau!", "author": "Denise L."}

The escargot, salmon trio, french toast, and creme brulee are classics that come out effortlessly delicious every time.

The Sunday we went, there was was a smoked salmon, chicken, or bacon wrapped tenderloin. No steak for you beef fiends out there. The pork tenderloin was probably the most interesting -- cooked medium rare and perfectly tender and juicy with an apple-calvados sauce. Gives NOPA a run for it's money! \n\nThe online menu listed a duck confit and wild skate in brown butter, which sounded much more interesting, but alas, they weren't on the menu the day we went.

Absolutely wonderful!\n\nWe arrived around 9:30 and the place was packed.  There were many people outside waiting to be seated, and many more waiting inside for their tables to be prepared.  The moment we walked up the Executive Chef and owner Philppe greeted my friend at the door with a warm welcome, I had no idea my friend knew Phiippe.  I was quite curious about the relationship, but it was quickly explained to me that he had eaten at Chapeau! too many times in the past...makes sense.\n\nWe had the five course Prix Fixe menu...and it was simply one of the best meals I have had the pleasure of eating, in a long while.  Let me list our courses:\n\nCrab Salad\nFoie Gras\nScallop\nDuck Leg & Duck Breast\nEspresso Creme Anglaise \n\nOur server started us out with wonderful drinks to pair with our meal and then the amazing food began to arrive, each dish at the perfect time, each dish the perfect size, each dish tastier than the dish before.\n\nThe Crab Salad was so fresh and delightful.  Delicious crab covering a plate with grapefruit, orange and kumquat confit, pomegranate and pine nuts.  This salad was drizzled with a lemon-honey emulsion to lightly glaze the fruits and crab.  I think I could have eaten two!\n\nOur second course arrived shortly after the salads were cleared away and our table swept for any crumbs that might be littering our eating surface.  I was seriously surprised to see the Foie Gras!  I recall the year that SF decided to make this dish \"illegal\" and having my last wonderful taste of it at Chaya several years ago.  As a New Orlean and French girl, the Foie Gras was adding to my special dinner--thank you Chapeau!  Wonderfully toasted pieces of brioche, tiny slices of fresh green apple and a tantalizing Gew\u00fcrztraminer gelatin aligned the plate with two wonderful Foie Gras medallions.\n\nThe Day Boat Scallop arrived next presented quite lovely in a round, deep dish displaying the thickness and beauty of the large scallop.  Tiny expressions of zucchini and carrot added a hint of flavor to this wonderful scallop atop a saffron beurre blanc that was to die for!\n\nAt this point, I was already getting full, but the selections were so outstanding I was willing to indulge.  The main course was arriving--Duck Leg Confit paired with a Pan Seared Maple Leaf Duck Breast.  If I have not said, \"WOW!\" yet, WOOOOOOW!!!  These two treats were set over top of black eyed peas, kale, shallots and sauce au poivre vert.  OMGoooooodessssss... Everything was perfectly seasoned and so moist and juicy. \n\nFInally, the grande finale arrives--the Opera, an Espresso Creme Anglaise.  I am not a dessert fan, I simply do not partake in sweets regularly; however, this was a must taste.  I did have one decadent bite of the dessert, which was plenty, but I can honestly say that if I did eat sugars this would be the one!\n\nOur server continually checked on us, but never in an intrusive manner, simply with the utmost professionalism.  I never needed or wanted anything outside of the perfect service he provided.  Philippe came to our table to make sure the cuisine was everything we anticipated and also to give me a hug.  Okay, here it comes again, \"WOOOOOOOOW!!!!\"  I got a hug from the wonderful Philippe!  What a splendid way to complete my perfect Valentine's Day meal.  \n\nOur server packaged our duck, as we truly could not endure another bite, yet were unwilling to part with the delicacies.  As our coats were brought back to our table and we were ready to exit the establishment, our server helped me into my coat and scarf and we made our way to the front, in a still very crowded restaurant.  As we were leaving, Philippe came and thanked us, and hugged us again and we decided that a picture was in order--you can see how fat everyone's face is after all that delicious and fattening French cuisine...lol\n\nTo simply summarize my experience, Chapeau! was wonderfully elegant and unpretentious awarding diners with a five star experience from service to menu.  \n\nStephani Smiles for Chapeau! ;)", "author": "Stephani M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-03", "description": "I've had Chapeau bookmarked for years.  Finally checked it out last weekend during Restaurant Week.  And what great timing, since the foie gras ban got lifted.  Chapeau is still a popular place that gets booked up quickly.  I was lucky to be able to get a reservation with three days notice, and an earlier time slot (5PM), the night before.\n\nThe restaurant is cozy but not as small as you would think.  The place was pretty bustling towards the end of dinner and we could see why.  We were the second party to be seated, and I honestly would have preferred another table than the one we got, but I guess that's okay.  Because it was Restaurant Week, Chapeau didn't offer their Early Bird Dinner, which in actuality is a better value than the Restaurant Week menu.  Since foie gras was back I decided on doing the seared foie gras appetizer ($20) and for my entree the duck frisee salad ($16).  He stuck with the Restaurant Week menu and chose: the trio of salmon, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, and the Basil Napoleon.  \n\nFirst came out the amuse bouche which was a sort of anchovy breadstick, first bite, it was just a salty breadstick, then came in the fishy anchovy taste.  He was fine with it, for me, I just couldn't do another bite.  The foie gras mas magical!  He said it was the best foie gras he ever had - even compared to Gary Danko's and Au Cheval's foie gras scrambled eggs.  It was nicely seared and fatty.  The apple slices were the perfect sweet accompaniment.  The trio of salmon was so fresh and light.  Loved the tartare and the creme fraiche and herbs complimented this well.  My frisee came with lots of tender duck confit and duck breast pieces.  I wished it would have came with a little more than duck and the frisee; even a little bit of citrus would have tied everything together and added a wonderful missing element to the dish.  The fingerling potato chips bit did and a nice crunch to it.  He loved his tender and juicy bacon wrapped tenderloin and the au ju was perfect on the bed of mashed potatoes.  He was going to go with the typical creme brulee but I asked him to go with the Basil Napoleon, and we both were glad that he did.  Thin little almost paper thin like crepes with bits of pineapple, mango, banana and kiwi with a light pastry creme makes this dessert light and refreshing.  I think it's a perfect dessert for someone who isn't much into sweets.  \n\nI think Chapeau is almost at 5.  If the Restaurant Week Menu had a beef or duck main entree offering I may have considered going by that menu instead.  They were offering other pre fixe menu options too, but once I heard foie gras I decided to get it with a little something else.  The staff is attentive and wonderful here (ladies you'll get a kiss on both cheeks Parisian style from the owner on your way out as well).

I also tried their signature cosmopolitan with a touch of chambord which made it the best cosmopolitan I have ever had\nWe also had the mushroom strudel which was moist and flavorfull and fabulous.

I look across the room and another couple was all so having a great time intil the end. The couple ask their waitress for something, seem like she ignored them. Then she proceeded to go to the table next to us which I believe are her friends. I am so disgusted of the things that were coming out of her mouth she is so heartless, mocking them and making faces. After saying all those nasty things about the couple. Then she went to the kitchen and brought out a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e after the bus boy dropped off their dessert.

Even for the chocolate cake, I thought that the choice of ice cream (rum raisin) was such a perfect way of cutting the chocolate and creating a great flavour when mixed. \n\nWe totally did get the bill in the silver top hat which I thought was really cute.

We had a couple cocktails each as well at $15 each. They seem to give every table a complimentary dessert in addition to what you order. Service was good and it was a nice ambiance although there wasn't much privacy since tables were so close to each other. They did overcook our filet mignon to medium rather than medium rare.

Since it was my birthday, and I was pretty hungry, I ordered the 4 course menu, which includes an appetizer, a seafood \"tasting\", an entree and dessert. \n\nIn all honesty, I was never all that interested in foie gras before it was banned, but after all that controversy, I just can't help but order it whenever I get the chance, much to the horror of wife, who is a recovering vegan. The foie gras appetizer was the most amazing foie gras that I have ever eaten. It was tender, but with with a delicate crisp, and slightly sweet yet buttery and creamy. It was so amazing, that I'm still thinking about it the day after.\n\nThe seafood tasting was a very large scallop over pesto risotto, with a brown lobster sauce.  The portion itself was small, since it was just a tasting, but it was delicious.  I was tempted to lick the sauce from the bottom of the plate, but Chapeau! is a nice restaurant and probably isn't the type of place to do that.\n\nMy entree was the fillet mignon, with bone marrow, over potatoes and mushrooms.  The fillet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the bone marrow was delicious and buttery when spread over the french bread.\n\nI'm not much of a wine person, so the very friendly waiter suggested a glass of the French Pinot Noir, which complimented all the courses of the meal very well.\n\nThe chef came out to chat with us, and he wished me a happy birthday and congratulated my wife and I on our one month of marriage. He was very happy to hear that we were recently married and gave us a complimentary dessert of profiteroles, in addition to to our French toast and Basil Napoleon.  All three desserts were delicious, in particular the Basil Napoleon and Profiteroles excellent.\n\nAfter we left, the chef ran out to the street and gave us a big hug.

The soup was rich and creamy but wasn't too overpowering. \n\nFor entree I got their Saut\u00e9ed Striped Bass & Braised Oxtail which was good. I liked the Striped Bass alot but the oxtail was just so so for me. My friend got their Wild Caught Skate Wing in a Brown Butter which was good as well.

I chose to order off their regular menu.\n\nRESERVATIONS:\nChapeau is a bit on the smaller side.  It does get a little busy (and a bit on the loud side) so to secure yourself a table, make a reservation.  If you arrive a bit early for your reservation, there is a full bar.\n\nFOOD:\n*Traditional French Onion Soup - Delicious and savory.  The soup had a perfect balance of bread, onions, and a heavy layer of cheese.  Though the soup doesn't look like a large serving, the ingredients make the dish a bit heavy so share the soup if you can. \n\n*Escargot de Bourgogne (6 pieces) - Yum, a must get!  The snails are marinated and baked with butter, parsley and garlic.  Extremely flavorful but be careful when it comes out, the dish is piping hot.\n\n*Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin - The pork was tender, though one piece was more tender than the other.  However though I saw the bacon, I didn't taste the bacon.  The pear sauce (I think?) had a nice sweet, caramel like taste to it.\n\n*Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee - Delicious and was a perfect end to the meal.  The dessert is big enough for two to share.  The custard has a nice vanilla taste and isn't too sweet and the top layer had a nice sweet crunch.\n\nSERVICE:\nService is great.  Our waiter periodically checked up on us without being overbearing.  What was nice was the chef walking over to each table to say his hellos and check to make sure the food was to our liking.  Upon leaving the restaurant, he ran out to say goodbye and to make sure we enjoyed our meal.  My only small gripe is that there wasn't a host to greet us.

My two favorite dishes were the corn soup and bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin. The pork was tenderly delicious and the apple-calvados sauce it was served with was superb. I would go back for this alone! My main dish was the canard (duck breast); the flavors were Asian-inspired, the duck served in a honey and spiced duck jus, which I didn't like at all. For dessert, the cr\u00e8me brulee was way too sweet, so the powdered sugar was unnecessary. The french toast was slightly better, but the mushy texture of the toast with the salted caramel ice cream and hazelnut creme Anglaise wasn't very appealing.\n\nService\nOur server was friendly, but the pacing between dishes was morbidly slow.

They do classic French restaurant cuisine. No frills and no trendy approaches. Just consistent, well executed, classic fine dining.\n\nEverything I've had here I've liked, even the vegetarian options. At my last visit I had the stuffed quail, which was really well done. However, my favorite part of the meal was the amuse bouche they served: a chestnut soup. It was a perfect match with the fall weather that night and the flavor was stunning. I've always wondered why they don't have steak tartare on the menu, but if they ever do I would be a happy diner!\n\nThe wine menu is quite reasonably priced, and of course heavily favors French and West coast wineries. But if either of those are your style, it won't be difficult to find several bottles that pique your interest. They also have a full bar, and make solid martinis.\n\nThe service was also great. Very friendly and entertaining waiter. The chef is also one of the most out going chefs I have ever seen. He was there to greet us when we arrived and also when we left. When he spoke about his restaurant the amount of enthusiasm and passion he had was inspiring.\n\nChapeau is on the short list of restaurants in San Francisco that I will continue to go back to for a long time to come.", "author": "Michael S."}

I had been here before and loved it, so coming here for date night yesterday was exciting.  We ordered the corn soup and veal sweetbreads as appetizers (corn soup from the early bird menu and sweetbreads are on the regular menu but cost extra).  The slightly smoked salmon and filet mignon were entrees, and then we ordered the Basil Napoleon and chocolate cake for dessert.  \n\nThe salmon was prepared nicely, and came with braised asparagus and tomato.  It had a sauce that tasted like sunny d and was way too sweet. I had to pull the salmon and the vegetables out of the sauce onto my side plate, and it was much more enjoyable that way.  So I wouldn't recommend the salmon...\n\nThe filet mignon and veal sweetbreads were excellent, and corn soup is delicious but also little too sweet in my opinion.  Both desserts were great, the basil napoleon had tiny cubes of kiwi, strawberries and pineapple, and had custard in between layers of thin wafers, while the chocolate cake had a molten ganache center, and came with rum raisin icecream and a smear of caramel.\n\nI'd say my entree was not as good as what I ordered before, and I would order the filet mignon next time if I went back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-17", "description": "I'm giving this a 5 because it is a French restaurant with the most interesting dishes I have eaten to date.  I'm really tired of French bistros with a plethora of steak and fry combinations (*ahem* Mon Ami Gabi) and/or just food that tastes so plain.  I knew that couldn't be all that French cuisine was about.  Additionally, the prices are really good for what you're getting.  \n\nFor appetizer, I had the foie gras ($18) layered on top of special bread and came with some sliced apples, greens, and sauce.  Forgive my pathetic description but I was delighted to taste just how fatty the foie gras.  The portion was perfect for two people to enjoy but not be overwhelmed by the heaviness the liver.\n\nThe menu online seems to be a bit outdated so if you're really curious, I'd give the restaurant a call to see what they have.  I ended up getting the rabbit leg stuffed with spinach and came with thumbelina carrots, seasoned grains, and a plum ($28).  It felt like the French interpretation of an American Thanksgiving dinner.  I really enjoyed how the rabbit was cooked and the overall balance of flavors.\n\nMy man's dish was the rack of lamb special and at $37, it's more expensive than the entrees on the menu but this is so worth it!  The portion is generous and they give you about 4 pieces of lamb in addition to ratatouille and a side dish of potatoes au gratin.  The ratatouille was so amazing because the zucchini was cooked perfectly (I always overcook zucchini on accident so I appreciate this).  I've had homemade ratatouille before from a French person and wondered why people were so fond of this bland dish but Chapeau makes me a believer.  Who knew vegetables could be so good?  The potatoes au gratin is loaded with garlic and comes in a dish with a diameter of 5\" so it's a lot.  This was a really hearty but flavor intense dish.\n\nI don't know how long the Baked Alaska dessert has been on their menu but it seems to be making a comeback from the '70s when my dad worked in the restaurant business and this was a popular dessert.  It's rum cake topped with a strong coffee ice cream and topped with Italian meringue.  The entire thing is sitting in a thin pool of chocolate with uniquely crunchy almond slices.  I really liked this except I was surprised at how sweet it was.  A little salt somewhere in here could go a long way.\n\nAttire is really what you want.  Of course you want to look put together but I saw a mix of guys wearing a formal jacket and dress shirt to guys wearing jeans and t-shirts.  Just make sure it's clean and nobody will really care.  I like that Chapeau can be a really special place but also casual and comfortable.  Like many people say, the tables are close together so I hope you like eavesdropping and being eavesdropped on.  We were about 15-20 minutes late for our reservation and they were accommodating although they said the table would be gone if we were late 30 minutes.  Keep that in mind!", "author": "Shannon L."}

The man sure can cook and he is so passionate about his craft that you can't help but admire him.  His personality is infectious as he walks the restaurant floor checking up on each and every table sharing his stories and making sure you leave a happy camper.  And it doesn't hurt that he has a French accent.\n\nThe prix fixe menu is the way to go if you want to try a variety of excellent French food at an extremely reasonable value.  You get an appetizer, tasting fish, entree and dessert for only $46 (plus $6 if you get the filet mignon).\n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the Foie Gras which was excellent.  If you've never had it before, you absolutely must.  So sad that this delicacy will no longer be available in California starting July.  Please save your animal cruelty comments for another website.\n\nThe tasting fish that that day was the Pan-Seared Scallop on Pesto Risotto with Lobster Sauce.  The scallop was delectable and I liked the sauce, but the risotto wasn't as tasty as I would have hoped.\n\nFor my entree, I had the Filet Mignon.  Not the best steak I've ever had, but it was a good portion, flavorful and oh so tender.  I added a Bone Marrow which was rich and buttery the way bone marrow is supposed to be.  Mmm mmm mmm!\n\nAnd oh my gosh the dessert... We were seriously overwhelmed by desserts!  I ordered the Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was good.  It's hard to mess up a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e though.  We also got to try the Napolean which was tasty as well, but perhaps a tad too sweet.\n\nThe consensus favorite though was the Nuage de Noix!  It's a Chef Philippe original creation that combines roasted pistachios, almonds & hazelnuts in a frozen chantilly & Italian meringue to create a masterpiece of delicate textures and flavors.  This isn't hyperbole either.  It's an absolute must try!\n\nIf you love French food, do yourself a favor and pay Chapeau! a visit!", "author": "Peter P."}

I started with the foie gras (and yes I felt guilty ordering it, but simply could not help myself), which was rich, creamy and wonderful.

Let me tell you, these were the best fries i tasted in my life. they were thin and short, just crispy  enough, and came with two sauces: one herby and the other like a chipotle sauce.\n\nNext was foie gras!\nAn appetizer of duck confit salad\nA palate cleanser sorbet- minty lemony something (delicious!)\nthen, entree of stuffed rabbit leg\nand finishing it off with a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (which was phenomenal)\n\nThe whole dinner lasted 3 hours but it was a good relaxing time. the fine details were all there. From the polite waiter who brings a tray full of tea for your selection and the person who sweeps the bread crumbs off the table and onto a plate with the crumb sweeper thing. Finally, the chef came out as we left to kiss us good bye (two cheeks as the french do!) So full after that dinner! good thing we parked about a block away so we could walk it off.", "author": "Marcia L."}

Two of us walked in right when they opened on a Sat night and got seated right away! Had the four course meal and it was definitely filling! I would recommend getting the sweetbreads and salade landaise. The sweetbread sauce made the dish memorable and the salade had my taste buds dancing. For the tasting we got the scallop and I'd say it was the best scallop I've ever had. So fresh and perfectly seared on top a pesto risotto. Filet mignon was great as well! Baked Alaska was very sweet but decadent in the best way possible. The basil napolean was very light and a refreshing way to end an excellent meal :).", "author": "Krista L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-10", "description": "I came here because of the ratings.  with over 2000 raters getting 4 1/2 stars is impressive.  And it's quite difficult to rate this restaurant because it's not a traditional French restaurant you visit.\n\nTherefore, it's difficult to rate against other elegant French restaurants and according to Yelp, 3 stars is good rating.  This restaurant definitely is not \"as good as it gets\" (4 stars).  If just based on the food, it's definitely a 4 stars better than many 1 Michelin star restaurants I went to but the overall package is not a 4 stars.  Frankly, I can't say \"I'm a fan\" neither because the overall experience (not just the quality of the food) is not what I expect from how they price their dishes.\n\nService:\n\n1.  Overall, server are courteous.  However, they lacked of the \"classy restaurant\" training.  Case in point, we sit next to a divided wall where servers, for their convenient, taking plates and serving foods across the divided half wall... that feels... not classy.\n\n2.  The kind of restaurants Chapeau! categorized with, I never had to get the server attention.  Which means it's not understaffed.  I had to ask for water twice, ask to order a glass of wine, asked for bread twice (sorry, kids were hungry), asked to order and asked for a check.\n\n3.  The bus (both of them) were very friendly, hard working but one expects more from a French restaurant at this caliber.  They are wonderful servers and I loved to dine with such staff.  However, they need more training to serve in a classy French restaurant.  One server use a towel when he pours water to prevent water bounce on to the table or the customer, that's training!  However, the other servers obviously didn't have as much training... such as serving dishes between me and my wife while he could have wait to serve from the opening of the table (there were someone standing by our table, I believe it's a server for another table)\n\nDecor:\n\n1.  Even though Chapeau! priced as a high class restaurant, the decor is more like a casual bistro.  The lighting is good but if you look at the decor... the molding around the ceiling and the walls, the chairs, wooden chairs that has no style nor character... feels like you walked into a rustic cafeteria.  \n\n2.  Extra chairs were stacked outside the restaurant by a lack luster single door entry.  I believe if pay more attention to design detail, it can make this a much stylish French restaurant.\n\n3.  The entry was divided by a curtain cornered at the entry.  Lack sincerity. \n\n4.  Bathrooms... I've been to many small restaurants in the city.  The food is no where near the quality of Chapeau! but they were thoughtful and stylish design even with very small space.  But the decor in the bathroom looks like those at some cheap Chinese restaurants.    Design can be done at low cost, again it's how much thoughts they put in to it.\n\nFood:\n\n1.  Cream of corn soup with crab cake and dash of truffle oil - Impressive.  It's creamy but not  heavy.  The flavorful chunky crab cake was just the proper portion.\n\n2.  Baked onion soup - This is not a traditional onion soup.  Because traditional onion soup is not delicious... they are always too salty.  This onion soup emit enormous sweetness...  The beef stock was subtle, didn't overwhelm the onion flavor. The cheese they use is probably Gruyere,  Its aroma and chewiness made the soup perfect.  Personally, I would like to see more cheese, but that just for cheese lover like myself.\n\n3.  Blue cheese tart - I had to say layers were so crispy and buttery, the blue cheese didn't overwhelm the rest of the tart.  It's quite good even for someone who's not a fan of blue cheese.\n\n4.  Foie Gras - It was good.  The timing was perfect... it melts in your mouth but still can flavor the crispiness on the outside.  The only comment I have is that the quality of the goose liver.  I've had better where the chef removed all the tendon/vessels inside the liver.  The one I had still have a little bit in it.  But then, even in some highly rated restaurant in the city, I've had worse experience with the Foie Gras.  Thus, I've no complaint.\n\n5.  Filet Mignon - This is done perfect.  I've seen steak done perfectly medium rare, most places will over cooked it and some under.  Chapeau! did it perfectly.  The mushroom sauce is a bit on the salty side but the steak was not marinated much so it turned out to be a perfect balance.  If anything (trying to be a perfectionist), I'd like a bit more crispy, which means about 50 degree higher heat to slightly burn the outside of the steak to make the crispiness stand out.\n\n6. Seared duck breast - Perfect done. amazingly tender!\n\n7. Bouillabaisse - was smaller than expected.  Especially if you had it in France.  The flavor is good, but the lemon in soup was a bit strong.  It was not my favorite dish.\n\nAll in all, it feels like a Chinese run restaurant with a 1 Michelin star French chef in the culinary.  Come for the food, you'll be a happy camper.", "author": "Mark L."}

That was very appreciated since I was fashionably late and it was busy due to it being the last day of SFRW. Thanks for being so accommodating!\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the prie fix menu. There were two different options. One menu was a 3 course dinner and the other menu was a 4 course dinner. The 4 course dinner comes with a \"Tasting Fish\" course. \n\nThe items we ordered were the:\n--Foie Gras: This was one of the specials for the night and an additional $6 on top of the prie fix menu. This was my favorite dish of the night. It comes with this bread puff, sliced apples and citrus micro greens that really complement the foie gras. Such a delicacy!! The foie gras was liver-y and definitely rich in flavor. \n--Escargot: You can smell the garlic when they place this dish in front of you!! Garlic + EVOO + Parmesan cheese...yum!\n--Scallop with pesto risotto and lobster sauce: This was one of the specials of the night and an additional $11.50 on top of the prie fix menu. I am a huge scallop person and loved the flavors in this dish. I wish I could've ate my boyfriend's portion hehe. :)\n--Mussels in White Wine Sauce: The sauce is full of garlic, white wine and light. This dish comes with a lot of mussels!! Generous portion. I really liked the fries that came with it! It reminded me of In N Out French fries!! Also comes with garlic bread so you can dip it into the sauce. Yum! \n--Veal Sweetbreads: My boyfriend and I didn't know that this is actually the thymus gland or pancreas of the veal haha. We didn't find out until after we ate it. \n--Lemon Tart: Yummy! \n--French Toast with Salted Caramel Ice Cream: Amaze balls!

The main chef/host came to greet us personally at the table which was a nice gesture. Impeccable service by our server, extremely polite and served with perfection.

Not overly sweet, just the way we all like it!! \n\nFinally the bill arrives the quirky way - in a hat!\n\nAt the end of the dinner we were in a complete food comatose!

(okay...that was my one and only attempt at writing anything French in this review)\n\nI went here with my girlfriends and we did a mixture of the DAT (Dine About Town) menu and some things from the regular menu. Here is what we ordered:\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n- Traditional Escargots De Bourgogne (very delish)\n- Trio of Salmon (did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would)\n- Porcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads (if you're looking for something yummy, BUT also different from your normal appetizers, then get this bad boy)\n\nENTREES:\n- Filet Mignon (cooked PERFECTLY and the oyster mushrooms were the perfect compliment to this dish)\n- Wild Caught Skate Wing (GET THIS DISH!!!)\n- Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin (the apple-calvado sauce was SO GOOD....I dipped my bread into it.....nuff said)\n\nDESSERTS:\n- Creme Brulee (delish as expected)\n- Basil Napolean (fruity, light and refreshing)\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake (we loved the rum-raisin ice cream that came with it)\n- Chef's Choice (it was like a chocolate mousse, but there was this layer of crunchy goodness)\n\nWINE:\nThe wine selection is out of control!  We got two bottles and thoroughly enjoyed them both. They arrange the wines from light (on top) to VERY bold (on bottom) and this definitely helps with picking out wine!\n\nCONS:\n- Place is really cramped and crowded, but I guess this is typical in SF. I always felt like cups were going to be knocked over when someone left the table.\n- Service is a bit slow. We had to flag a few people down in order to get our second bottle of wine.

If a restaurant hits all the marks, it gets only gets four stars. In order to get that final star, there must be a dish, a bite--something--that makes time pause for a moment as little fireworks explode from my taste buds. Chapeau indeed had that moment (more on that later) but a few flaws keep it from a perfect score.\n\nMy girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Being my birthday, I went with the works: Menu 2 with the palate cleanser and the upgrade for the filet mignon and bone marrow.\n\nThe appetizers were a good start. I got the veal sweetbreads while she got the trio of salmon. The trio of salmon was a very well constructed dish, something that wouldn't be out of place at a place like Commis. It was light, fresh, vibrant, with lot of good flavor. The sweetbreads were on the other spectrum, but just as good. It's a much heartier dish, borderline an entree, and I was afraid I'd be too full for the rest of the meal afterward.\n\nThe tasting fish was amazing. It was a generously sized scallop on a small bed of risotto. The scallop was perfectly cooked and risotto was seasoned well with amazing flavor. If they tripled this plate and called it an entree, I would be very happy. She didn't get a tasting fish, but Chapeau was gracious enough to give her a set of cutlery and a small plate to join in the fun.\n\nThe main entree is where I felt Chapeau missed the mark. My filet was well cooked, but overly salty, as were the potatoes. You would think they'd taste a dish before sending it out. I much preferred her duck breast but the duck leg confit was touch dry. I know what you're thinking. Duck?? Leg?? Confit?? Dry? But it was.\n\nFor desserts, I went with the baked Alaska while she got the French toast based on a recommendation from a friend. The baked Alaska was unremarkable as a dessert, having any complexity in flavor totally masked by the overwhelming chocolate sauce, which resembled Hershey's syrup more than anything else. The French toast, however, was mind-blowingly delicious. It's so good I still think about it today and wonder if I could call in for take out for just this dish. \n\nOverall, I got the mind-blowing moment I was looking for, but a few flaws keep Chapeau from the perfect score.", "author": "Newton L."}

I recommend getting their 3 course menu ($40) - appetizer, entree & dessert  OR 4 course menu ($50) - appetizer, fish tasting, entree & dessert.\n\nAPPETIZER:\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Foie Gras Special ($6 upcharge) - 2 medium sized Foie Gras (specially fattened duck liver) with Apple, Microgreens & Brioche (French bread). Simply amazing! They just melt in your mouth; Very rich, strong flavored, delicate and fattening at the same time. Eat them with the apple slice & bread for the perfect experience.\n\n\nENTREE:\n\nDay Boat Scallops ($6 upcharge) - 2 Seared Diver Scallops with Pesto Risotto & Lobster Cream Sauce. Bloody amazing; the scallops're made perfectly (a little crispier on outside, so tender on the inside) & the sauce is just good. I'd highly recommend this especially to the seafood lovers.\n\nWild Caught Skate Wing in a Brown Butter, Fingerling Potato, Sauce Grenobloise, Mache ($22.00) - Surprisingly really good. I've never that big fan of fish dishes, but I must say that this dish's worth getting.\n\n\nPALATE CLEANSER:\n\nTrou Normand ($4.50): Green Apple Sorbet, Calvados. It's soothing, not very heavy. I'd recommend it to clean your palate, especially if you're trying a lot of food.\n\nDESSERTS:\n\nNuage De Noix - Roasted Pistachios, Almonds & Hazelnuts in a Frozen Chantilly & Italian Meringue ($8.50) - Very delicious.

I jumped on the dine about town offer and almost ordered off the regular menu because the price difference really wasn't that much more but stuck to the original plan since the dine about town options I have already chosen sounded exciting. \n\nFor the service itself I would give a full five stars. They were very attentive, efficient and friendly. The restaurant was a lot smaller than I had anticipated, the tables are very close to one another but not too uncomfortably so. \n\nTo start off we had the escargot and onion soup. I have had onion soup at regular sandwich delis and also at another very fancy French restaurant that I thought tasted the same. As for the escargot it wasn't what I had expected. I've only had escargot once before but it was stuffed in a mushroom. Both times there wasn't a real taste of the actual snail I can taste, it was the sauce that overpowered. It was chewier, maybe because before the mushroom distracted from the texture. \n\nI had the duck breast that was cooked perfectly. It was pretty good but not the best  I've had. The other entree we had was the bacon wrapped tenderloin. I was surprised that it didn't have a heavier bacon flavor like typical bacon infused dishes. I appreciated that. Though overall I thought it was just okay. \n\nTo end we had all three vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, profiteroles, and nuage de noix. The cold orange sauce of the nuage was yummy, very crisp and refreshing but the pastry was too nutty for my taste. If you love almonds and other nuts you would probably love it, just not up my alley is all. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was really good. Probably one of the  top two best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've had. I really liked that it wasn't too sweet or heavy. The cream puffs was sooo good.

It was served on a bed of parsnip pur\u00e9e, with saut\u00e9ed Swiss chard and a pool of some sauce reduction. There were three slices of cooked peaches buried in the middle.

Absolutely outstanding with the sauce, and normally we focus strictly on the meat. But this was an amazing side and sauce combination.\n\nDesserts fell down a level from our visit 4 yrs ago. Baked Alaska was too sweet; creme brulee had a gluey texture as if thickened with cornstarch.\n\nOverall, still a fine little bistro, and one of the very few places you can almost always find skate, beloved of Europeans but ignored by Americans. Not a destination restaurant to itself (e.g., a \"must go\"), but an excellent choice if you want some good French food and like us, live in Alameda Cty where this level of quality, with its corresponding mid-level cost, simply doesn't exist. \n\nWe love La Folie and Etoile, but both are too costly and too rich to eat at often, whereas you could eat at Chapeau! every couple of months, no problem!\n\nBe aware that service runs a little lean on peak days, because some dishes require tableside service (such as the elaborate Cote de Boeuf) which ties up the waitstaff. Chef owner Gardelle helps out frequently, but you need to plan for at least 90 min to 2 hrs for a meal.", "author": "Jean K."}

First let me say that it took us 15 minutes of sitting in our table before anyone acknowledged us.

Three out of four had the same sweet taste.  I understand the use of sherry in French food but wow everything but the mussels had the same taste. I really love savory food so maybe I selected incorrectly.  The chicken was cooked very moist but it was cloyingly sweet.  I did like the salad a lot.  My husband thought the French onion soup was sweet and his mussels were, as he put it, not the best he's ever had but not the worst.\n\nAnother issue is this restaurant is hot.

The city is full of amazing restaurants so choosing can be difficult. Luckily it coincided with date night with my girlfriend and she suggested that we check out Chapeau! for a lovely, romantic meal. Problem solved!\n\nThe meal started innocuously with a super flavorful, crusty bread with butter that had just enough salt. An amuse bouche of cauliflower soup was served, which would actually become my favorite dish I had all night. It was perfectly seasoned and finished off with a drop of truffle oil. (Truffle oil is one of those ingredients that is somewhat looked down upon by master chefs since it is basically just a manufactured aromatic and not actually a truffle-infused oil. While I wouldn't serve it to Chef Ramsey, I do enjoy a drop or two in my favorite dishes.)\n\nFor our first course, my girlfriend and I enjoyed their trio of salmon and a creamy yellow corn soup.  The salmon was served as stack with gravlax, tartare, and caviar, with egg mimosa, fried capers, and creme fraiche and the soup was served with a deep fried crab cake and white truffle oil.  The salmon dish was fantastic and each component builds on top of the flavor of the last.  The whole dish comes together in a single bite.  The soup was super refreshing and paired perfectly with the crab cake.  I could have done without the drizzle of truffle oil in this case, but it did add a rich dimension to the soup.\n\nOur main courses included the cassoulet de toulouse and oven roasted wild atlantic salmon.  The cassoulet was served with canellini beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder, duck leg confit, and garlic and toulouse sausage, while the salmon came with a fondue provencale, fennel confit, parsley oil, and roasted bell pepper sauce.  The cassoulet was rich and the sausage was delicious, and the meat fell right off the bone of the duck leg.  It might have been a tad over-seasoned but the dish was otherwise executed very well.  The salmon was cooked to medium-rare, something I didn't know was possible.  I loved it, and that's how I'm going to cook mine from now on.  It was perfectly seasoned and light, tender, and amazing.  The components combined to make the perfect summery bite.\n\nFor dessert we shared the nuage de noix and baked alaska.  I really liked both desserts with the nuage de noix being filled with roasted pistachios, almonds, and hazelnuts in a frozen chantilly and italian meringue in an orange soup.  I happen to love nuts and this combination really hit the spot.  I felt like I was eating the world's most special oatmeal cookie.  The baked alaska featured a sponged rum cake, coffee ice cream, italian meringue, chocolate sauce, and candied toasted almonds.  The baked alaska lacked the theater of the San Diego version, but was fantastic nonetheless.  The dark chocolate and rum sauce was to die for and all together a heavenly way to end the meal.\n\nService here was fantastic, with attention to detail starting the moment you walk through the door.  Even the chef came out to say hi, and everybody was just so darn nice.  I enjoyed the entire meal and there were high notes in each course.  If you go, definitely get the salmon and nuage de noix.  It was a fantastic place for a date dinner and I encourage you to bring your loved ones here for a fantastic evening.\n\nFood: 9/10\n\nService: 10/10\n\nPrice: $$$\n\nAtmosphere: 9/10", "author": "Joe M."}

Owner came out to say hello and the service was friendly. Ambiance is OK, perhaps a bit loud, but I guess to be expected in such a small place.\n\nWaiter came over and we decided to go for the 3 course meal. We added onion soup to the order and agreed to pay extra for that. Food was so-so, certainly not as good as I remember. Onion soup was far too sweet, foie gras was tasty while the sweetbread was dry and bland. Main course casoulette was also dry and not terribly tasty while my wife's scallops were quite good. All in all, an \"OK\" meal.\n\nCheck arrived and it's $179 dollars. Apparently we had been upcharged for almost everything we ordered. I questioned the waiter about the bill and I received a poor explanation. I explained that in the future, it is their responsibility to tell customers at the time of the order about upcharges. He apologizes.\n\nWe won't be back given the food and ambiguity on pricing.

My husband and I fell in love with their onion soup, perfectly crusted over with crouton and bubbling cheese, not glued on in a gloppy mess, but just the perfect amount to balance the broth, which btw., is insanely tasty--redolent with sweet and savory. Their mescun salad with the crusted camembert is a revelation, the cheese oozing in the best way possible over the greens, and I knew it was a victory when my husband, who usually doesn't like melted cheese, declared that he needed to order it every time :-) For a time, we got their vegetarian entree, with mushrooms and pastry: unbelievable. We also love their Bouillabaisse, the broth is not like tomato soup, not acid, but rich and velvety with the crouton to sop of the juices, packed high with seafood, and we use the bread to get the rest. I've always loved the cassoulet--a richly potent dish with flavors mingling together for a marriage. Depending on our mood and specials, we rotate on the choices, and their prix fixe is a steal. The service is exemplary, husband and wife making it look easy, when in fact, you know they work their asses off. They're unfailingly gracious and warm, sweet, and kind. The prices cannot be beat, and it's well worth the drive out to the burbs in S.F. for the experience.

Each of her dishes were delicious and beautiful to look at. She had a glass of bubbly to compliment her meal. I started with their specisl vodka martini enhanced with chambers liqueur, wonderful, and not overly sweet. We had an amuse bouche of a creamy tomato soup with a nice drop of basil oil served in an espresso cup. Sorry for the pun, but it did amuse my pallet. I had the mesclun salad with creme dijonnaise, dressed perfectly, every leaf had dressing, put it was not dripping. The fried camembert was warm, creamy,  and the crust was crisp.  Then my entree of striped bass & braised oxtail, with a poultry jus, this was a unique take on surf and turf and a marvel for my tongue,  or need the meal with profiterol.

The soup has the right amount of cream and truffle oil!  I am a big fan of truffle oil and it went very well with this soup. I had a bit of my friend's Trio of Salmon and it has a really refreshing taste...another Yums...\n\n2nd course - Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin - The pork was cooked med and was pretty juicy, but it wasn't as tender as I like.  Tasted was good...but not great.  The pork was laid on top of parsnip puree and kale... the parsnip puree was pretty sweet.  If they could of tone down the sweetness on that, it would of been much better.  Overall, this dish was good...but not great... \n\n3rd course - Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee - Yums...

I was able to get seated at the bar.   When I was still settling in, i heard someone say \" Hello Mademoiselle\"  , shock to hear this, i turned around, and there he was Philippe the head chef.  \" Hello, mademoiselle, how are you? thank you for coming here tonight\" * shakes hands and leaves* i was completely star struck to say the least.  I  never had the head chef come out and talk to people. I felt rich and felt like an important socialite, yes i know i'm dreaming. \n\nAnyways, my friend and i did the prix menu for $38.00.  The special for that night was the foie gras which was an additional 6.00 with is totally worth it! It was seared perfectly! It literally melts in your mouth. I wanted to savor every bite of it and eat it as slowly as possible. If only i can have this as my entree I absolutely love it. They had a special sauce with this dish. I asked my waitress what type of sauce it was, she said it was an apple gastrique sauce. It went perfectly with the foie gras, pear and the bread. I now know what i want to eat if i was stuck on an island and i can only chose one item to eat for the rest of my life. The foie gras totally exceeded my expectations. \n\nWe also were give samples of the shredded rabbit on a baguette. I like how the rabbit was shredded, I've had rabbit before in other places but it was tough. But this wasn't the case here. It was tender and it had a good amount of juice in it.  \n\nFor the main course i had the Filet Mignon with the bone marrow.  The Filet Mignon was good it was tender, I loved the potatoes that it came with. The potatoes were so good and the sauce with the steak was every more tasty. It was my first time eating bone marrow. i was able to scrap all to the bottom and use the spoon to spoon it out. The tasted like foie gras! It was super yummy but too bad it was as small portion.   My friend got the Wild Caught Skate Wing. It wasn't dry and it had a good amount of sauce on it.  It tasted very smooth and silky\n\nFor dessert, we got the baked Alaska and the French toast.  The french toast was very soft and it was covered in caramel. It wasn't too bad, and it went perfectly with the coffee ice cream. I hope to find a way to make it exactly like theirs at home. My friend got the Baked Alaska, It had the Italian Meringue, with rum sponge cake inside and the ice cream inside as well.. I like the outside of it more, because of the texture. The inside had a very strong rum taste to it. So it's perfect for you rum lovers\n\nOverall, i enjoyed my experience here, and I can't wait to come back, but i now know to make reservations far in advance.

Philippe was breezing through the dining area, greeting guests but made a point to come over to our table & shake hands with everyone. What a warm welcome :\n\nMost of us opted for the 4 course option. Our waiter brought us a chilled sorbet-liked 'soup' which is said to have palate-cleansing power, served in an espresso size cup. Not sure if our palates were cleansed but the bread that they served while we waited for our appetiser was indeed heavenly with a hint of garlic, soft on the inside but crispy on the outside. I ordered Trio of Salmon where the salmon gravlax is used to hold the salmon tartar n its round shape, surrounded by egg mimosa & sprinkles of caviar & fried capers to complete the plate. Its a 4-star appetiser because of the fried capers. I had a sample of the mussel & it was delectable too, especially when the bread soaked up all the delicious goodness.\n\nFor the 'fish tasting' it is a pan-seared scallop sitting on a bed of risotto. My scallop was cooked just right but some of the others were slightly over-cooked. The risotto, to me came in slightly under-cooked as I could still bite into the crunchy bits. Next was the much anticipated entree. My left brain had to fight with my right brain... duck or lamb, duck or lamb, duck or lamb... I decided on the 'Special' - lamb-shank. Verdict??? I was disappointed.. what?!?!?!?! yup, you heard me right. DISAPPOINTED!!! It was too salty and the sauce was too sweet for my liking. As none of us ordered the duck, I am still intrigue as to how that would turn out. Maybe that's my excuse to go back there in future\n\nThe most important course of the dinner was of course dessert ;) With 8 of us ordering desserts, I had a chance to sample the Baked Alaska (ice-cream with rum cake), creme brulee and the french toast. French toast top the list. Bummer that I only had just one teeny-weeny bite *sigh*\n\nOn our way out, Philippe was at the door, cheek kissing us gals. Didn't pay attention if the guys shake hands or cheek kissed as well.\n\nWith all the highs & lows, it was overall an enjoyable experience.

There weren't a lot of Oxtail meat in my dish as much as there were fish, but the Saut\u00e9ed Striped Bass was crispy on the outside and freshly steamed on the inside.  \n\nMy favorite desserts were Profiteroles, warm Chocolate Molten Lava cake a la mode, and their French Toast.", "author": "Wendy T."}

It was so rich with truffle flavor. SIMPLY PUT... EVERYTHING WAS PURE ECSTASY.\n\nAnd as I'm sure you've already read... The hosts and waiters are extremely friendly, assertive and accommodating. They put in 100% and nothing less. The chef himself even went around the entire restaurant to welcome everyone! Definitely makes you feel like royalty.\n\nBest meal and experience of my life...

The roasted chicken, the braised short ribs, both so succulent.  The creme brulee was creamy without being too sweet.

The atmosphere is definitely not as intimate or formal at the bar, but the bartender provided impeccable service and everything was...neat and precise in all aspects.  If you had any qualms that service would not be top notch at the bar, cease your worries.  My only complaint was that I couldn't lean back for the 2+ hours we were there.   \n\nI ordered the mesclun salad as appetizer and the sauteed striped bass and braised oxtail for the main.  While waiting, we were served a complimentary cauliflower soup with truffle oil.  Sweet relief for hungry stomachs; smooth, creamy, and the truffle was bold.  There was also complimentary bread.  \n\nThe mesclun salad came out in a large plate.  Good thing I shared half with my friend.  Unique take on salad, lovely flavors coming from pistachios and the sweetest grapes I've had in a while.  The fried camembert on the side brought in even more texture with its crunchy exterior.  I also liked that the cheese wasn't mixed in, giving me a little control and experimentation over the flavors of the salad.  I don't remember being so satisfied by a salad in a restaurant in a long time.\n\nIt took some waiting between appetizer and entree.  The top layer of my entree was lukewarm but still piping hot inside, so not sure if our entrees had been sitting for a bit before being served.  Nevertheless, my striped bass and oxtail entree was delicious; I finished every morsel.  Perfectly sauteed fish stacked over shredded tender oxtail on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes surrounded by a moat of sauce.  No bones to pick through! The sauce was on the salty side though.  \n\nDecided to have dessert to finish off the meal and selected the nuage de noix.  I'm not really a fan of nuts, but this dessert had such an interesting marriage of textures and flavors.  I especially loved the orange soup which provided such a stark tart contrast to the sweet frozen chantilly and meringue.  Oh yes, nothing left on the plate either when I was done.  \n\nWhat a pleasant and charming dining experience!  The chef also made a round through the house to greet everybody and shake every single person's hands.  Upon our departure, he even gave us hugs and goodbye kisses like dear friends.

We had made reservations for a Sunday night and we were seated right away. Service was spectacular that night.\n\nFood:\nComplimentary Bread - Nothing too special\n\nToasted Tomato Bread - Not too sure what this is called, but this was complimentary from the chef. It was pretty yummy. \n\nMesclun Salad with Creme Dijonnaise, Red Seedless Grapes, Pistachio, and Fried Camembert - This salad was huge!!! The fried camembert (cheese) was very yummy!!! I really enjoyed this salad because it was different from the usual type I would eat. After I finished my salad, I was already full and this was just the beginning of my meal too!\n\nTraditional Escargots de Buorgogne - My mom had ordered this and when I tried one of them, they were so delicious!!! I was glad they were not in the shells. The escargots were baked in butter, parsley and garlic. Loved the flavors.\n\nTrio of Salmon - My dad had this and I got to take a bite of it. This had came with tartare and caviar. It was very refreshing and flavorful. Good portion amount. \n\nPrince Edward Island Mussels - I am a big fan of seafood so I had to get this. I love mussels! The mussels were steamed with white whine, shallot and parsley, which came along with a side of pommes frites. Yum! I had been already full from my salad, so I ate all the mussels and saved my fries for to go. The white wine sauce was soo yummy that I asked for more bread to dip and eat it. \n\nWild Caught Skate Wing - Never heard of this dish before, but my dad had this and it was a pretty big portion! I could tell that it was very soft and tender and very flavorful by the looks of it!\n\nBoneless Roasted Half Chicken Dodine Stuffed with Mousse of Veal - My mom had this and I remembered she was really full and had packed this to go! \n\nFrench Toast, Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Hazelnut Creme Anglaise - I was already so full from my main course, but I just had to save room for dessert. The french toast was so good! This was so fluffy! Plus, I loved that it came with the salted caramel ice cream. It melted in my mouth with each bite. \n\nProfiteroles - This was pretty good and sweet at the same time. Quite different from the typical kind of desserts. \n\nNuage de Noix - This had roasted pistachios, almonds and hazelnuts in a frozen Chantilly and Italian meringue, orange soup. A bit sweet, but still delicious.\n\nThroughout the night, service was excellent and they kept checking up on us to see how everything was. We even met the chef that night as he was walking around and shaking everyone's hands. We felt very welcomed throughout the night.

We came here last night for my boyfriend's birthday. We had reservations at 8pm, but we came a little early and were able to be sat immediately which was great.\n\nI'll talk about the service first. After reading a good amount of reviews beforehand, we were delighted to know that the service here is awesome! However, I honestly didn't think the service we received was anything too great. Yes, right when we entered, we were greeted by the welcoming hostess and the chef which was awesome! But the rest of our time there consisted of: our server quickly taking down our order, people just dropping off our food without any clear details of what each course was, no water refills for about 20 minutes of my boyfriend's cup being completely empty, absolutely no check ups or asking us if we enjoyed the food/needed anything else, and a long time to receive our bill. Don't get me wrong, the staff was extremely friendly, but the service wasn't as great as we had read. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was delicious! We both decided to go with the Menu 2: your choice of appetizer, tasting fish, choice of entr\u00e9e, and choice of dessert. They first started us off with complimentary bread of course, which was good! (Partially because we were starving at that point already). It came with (onion?) soup which I really loved. \n\n** Appetizers! I got the foie gras and my boyfriend the trio of salmon. The foie gras was amazing!! Came with toasted brioche, slices of fresh apples, with a delicious Gew\u00fcrztraminer gelatin on the plate. It was actually my first time having foie gras, so I can't really compare it to anything. But it surely hit the spot. My boyfriend's salmon appetizer was good as well; I loved how citrus-y it was. \n\n** Tasting fish! It was a seared scallop with a pesto risotto and lobster sauce. Oh gosh... this was too amazing. I'm somewhat of a pesto freak, so I absolutely loved this course! Everything on this plate was so balanced and mouth-watering.\n\n** Entr\u00e9es! We both got the filet mignon, with extra $5 bone marrow, and extra $8 Sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine. So amazing! Cooked to perfection, and was super juicy. Bone marrow was a little bit on the salty side, but still delicious. I forgot to also mention that the boyfriend and I both had a glass of wine, but sadly I can't remember the name. Our server chose for us because he said it pairs well with filet mignon and he was so right.\n\n** Desserts! I got the Baked Alaska and my boyfriend the French Toast. I fell in love with the baked alaska.. Rum spongecake, rich chocolate sauce, toasted almond slices, coffee ice cream, and meringue.. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about it. My boyfriend's french toast was great as well. \n\nI did write down it was my boyfriend's birthday on opentable, but I guess they forgot.. So I had to remind our server and he rushed back to get a candle. Boo :/ \n\nOverall, we had a good experience. Decent service, delicious food. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking to have a date-night.", "author": "Amy T."}

However, it looked like there was a great deal for Restaurant Week, so a couple of girlfriends and I made reservations.  \n\nFew weeks later and down to just 2 girls for dinner, my girlfriend and I came in and sat at the bar. They were very accommodating to us when we wanted to change times and the amount of people. \n\nWe ended up each getting a glass of white wine. Since we didn't know what to get, our lovely bartender let us try a bit of two different wines. My friend and I ended up getting a glass of each since we enjoyed different glasses. \n\nSince we were going to a share the 4 course menu (which you can do for free if you don't have them split the dish), so we ended up getting all fish dishes. \n\nWe ordered: \n-Trio of Salmon (Gravlax, Tartare & Caviar, Egg Mimosa, Fried Capers & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, Micro Herbs with Lemon Dressing): All the items put together were delicious. The plate was beautiful and we didn't want to eat it, but we did. The eggs and capers definitely added some depth flavorwise, but my favorite way of salmon was probably either the gravlax (which was like cured salmon) or the tartare. Yum!\n-Tasting Fish (Seared Dayboat Scallops with Pesto Risotto and Lobster Sauce): This was a really small dish - especially because it was split between the two of us. The scallop was not that large - somewhat expected something bigger and more risotto. Regardless, it was delicious, though small. \n-Striped Bass (Saut\u00e9ed Striped Bass & Braised Oxtail, Roasted Garlic Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, Caramelized Pearl Onion, Jus de Poulet): YUM. This was definitely really good. It is their take on a surf and turf. The striped bass was perfected cooked and the braised oxtail with the mashed potatoes created this beautiful mixture of food. \n-Baked Alaska (Sponged Rum Cake, Espresso Ice Cream, Italian Meringue, Chocolate Sauce, Candied Toasted Almonds): Since my girlfriend had never had baked alaska before, we decided to try it. Honestly, I love me some cake and ice cream topped with meringue so I had no complaints .However, it was overly sweet in some ways. I agree that a dessert should be sweet, but it shouldn't have my sweet tooth ache! However, it was a delicious ending to our meal. \n\nOverall, I had a great time and definitely some delicious food. The portion sizes varied, but were good enough for the two of us to feel full afterwards. Service was great from our lovely bartender, so we had a good time. \n\nProtip: share a Prix Fix menu with a friend to try the food without paying for the entire meal.

I've never had legit French fine dining so Yelp was a very good friend to me. With an average of 4.5 stars and a total of 1736 reviews, Chapeau! definitely did not disappoint. D thought it was delicious and it was also a delicious cherry pop of the French cuisine for me. \n\nI made reservations for 8pm, but we got there around 730pm since we left early enough to leave plenty of time for parking. Right when we walked in, we were a bit confused as to what to do. When you walk in, it's like a super small \"lobby\" with curtains blocking your view of the dining area so if there is nobody standing in that little lobby waiting on customers, you might be ignored for a long time because no one can see you. So after a minute of being confused, I decided to just walk out of that area so the hostess would be able to see me. If anything, this would be my only complaint for Chapeau. I was scared that this little neglect would set the tone for the night, but thank God it didn't. After the hostess saw us, we were seated right away. \n\nChapeau is small, and with the dim lights, it's very intimate and romantic. The tables are pretty squished together and though the restaurant wasn't that crowded that night, D and I were seated right next to another couple. We were seated so close that it felt like we were just all seated together on one table. It was a bit awkward at first.....but the older couple was very friendly and super cute so it turned out to be a-okay. (I hope to be that cute with my significant other in the future hehe) \n\nAnyway, let's start on the food. D and I both ordered the 3 course meal which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. \n\nAppetizers:\n- I chose the oysters. It came with six oysters, special vinegar sauce with garlic, and lemon. Oh it was divine. The oysters were plump and just the perfect size and the sauce went soooo well with the oysters. \n- D chose the escargot. He loves escargot so I already knew beforehand that he would choose this. I'm glad it didn't disappoint my little birthday boy. At the end of dinner I asked him what was his favorite, and he choose the escargot. Everything was yummy, but this was how yummy the escargot was for him. \n\nEntree:\n- Filet mignon was mine! Hehe mmm! I love meat. I asked for it medium rare and it was indeed medium rare! It was tender and was served on a bed of potatoes and mushrooms. Everything about this dish was cooked to perfection. Honestly if you asked me to choose between the filet mignon itself or the potatoes and mushrooms, I wouldn't know which to choose..I guess it was just too perfect together. \n- D had the duck leg confit. Oh this was really good too! It came with some veggies...and something else but I don't really remember what it was. The duck was tender and soft. Once you bit into it, it pretty much just melted in your mouth. Oh gosh. Talk about orgasm in your mouth..\n\nDessert:\nWe decided on the creme brulee and french toast. Funny story to this. I was waiting for D to go to the bathroom throughout the whole dinner so I could ask our hostess to put a candle on his dessert. Time was flying by and he still didn't leave the table so this had to go down:\n\n \"Umm do you need to use the bathroom?\"\n\"No...\"\n\"Maybe you should go..\"\n\"What..why? Oh. Are you trying to tell them to put a candle on it..?\" -laughs-\n\"Hehe yes.\"\n\nSo he leaves to use the bathroom and after a minute or two trying to find the hostess, I get a text from D saying 'she's waiting for the bathroom LOL'\n\nOh dammit. Then while I tried to wave down a waiter, another waiter started walking out with our desserts. Fail boat.. I ended up asking if he could put a candle on it first and the older gentleman waiter was very happy to oblige to my request. It took a while for D to come out and even though it wouldn't take long for them to put a candle on it, the waiter actually waited for my boyfriend to return to surprise him with his candled creme brulee. I very very much appreciated this :) \n\nSo back to the desserts. OMG SO GOOD. The french toast takes 15 mins to make after ordering but omg omg omg, you have to get this. THE BEST DESSERT EVER. It comes with salted caramel ice cream and goodness, it was that out-of-this-world type of good. The creme brulee was also very yummy. Unlike usual creme brulee with the hard top, this one wasn't as hard. I liked it more this way. Made it seem more fresh and made-to-order. The inside was very creamy and not too sweet. Yums. \n\nWow. Long review, but Chapeau! deserves a full-detailed review. With two 3 course meals, one drink, and one glass of wine, it came out to be around 125$ not including tip. Well worth the money for such a special occasion and such delicious food. I definitely want to come back and try the other dishes. \n\nChapeau!, you definitely chapeau!'ed me.", "author": "Judith L."}

We showed up and realized that there was quite a wait on a Friday night around 7pm, and were prepared to hunker down and wait a solid hour. Fortunately, the host was on top of his game and had us seated in around five minutes, which thrilled us.\n\nWe only ordered a dessert, and our server was very sweet and efficient. We tried the baked Alaska, per her recommendation, and it was served within minutes.\n\nI'm not certain whether we caught them on an \"off night\" or if something was just wrong, but it was definitely not a premier dessert. It reminded me of something you'd get from Marie Callenders in the frozen section. It was small, the texture wasn't quite perfect, and the flavors were slightly bland. We were both underwhelmed by it, overall.\n\nI'd give the place another shot, judging by the reviews and the lines, they must do some things quite well (customer service, for example, was great).

We ordered their 3 course meal (appetizer, entree, and dessert) for $44.50 each. What we ordered:\n\nAppetizers: Veal Sweetbreads and Duck Salad\nOh my god the sweetbreads were the most amazing thing. I came in thinking that they were going to be gross but after one bite it blew my mind. I can't even describe the explosion of flavors from biting into one. The sauce they cook it in is also incredibly delicious. The duck salad was pretty great but not anything too amazing. \n\nEntrees: Skate Wing in brown butter and Cassoulet De Toulouse.\nI had the skate wing and it was fall off the bone soft. I originally had thought I was ordering some form of chicken (yeah idk I'm culinary challenged) but was pleasantly surprised to find out this was fish. I personally don't prefer fish but this skate wing was so soft, juicy, and flaky that it changed my mind. I will always be open to trying fish now. As for the Cassoulet De Toulouse, I personally thought it was kind of a glorified French chili but my friend enjoyed it tremendously and I will admit the sausage was delicious.\n\nDesserts: Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Baked Alaska\nWow. I've had plenty of different creme br\u00fbl\u00e9es but Chapeau's might be in the top two. Just try it. You won't regret it. The Baked Alaska on the other hand was kind of a let down, but that was still alright.

I've been wanting to try this restaurant since over a year ago when someone recommended it to me as one of her favorite restaurants in SF. Well, that's a pretty tall order. Tried to make reservations here back in February for Valentine's Day, but they were completely packed! So the sweetie that my bf is, he remembered I wanted to try this place and booked it as a random surprise for me. Lesson learned: make a reservation in advance!!\n\nYou can order a la carte or from their \"Menu options.\" Meaning either a 3 or 4 or 5 course meal. And the nice thing is, both people do NOT have to do the same option, whereas some places will dictate that you need to. So I got a 3 course ~$40 (choose your own appetizer, entry, dessert) and my bf got the 4 course ~$50, which included a tasting fish. Some options you may have to add a few extra dollars for that choice.\n\nFor appetizers, we got the trio of salmon and the corn soup. The salmon trio was yum!! And very pretty. I love fried capers too. Now, the bf picked the corn soup because there the word \"giant prawn\" in the description, but really...there was only one giant prawn and the rest was corn soup. HAHA...howeverrrr....I thought the soup was absolutely delicious! I love creamy corn soups and this was just the right consistency and sweetness. He was upset there was only one prawn haha\n\nThe tasting fish was a sort of scallop dish. TBH, I couldn't understand the thick French accent of our waiter for the life of me. All I heard were the words \"scallop\" and \"mango\"...which is a weird combination. But this scallop looked kind of like it was deconstructed and flattened. Topped with mango cubes, parsnips, some crunchy nut (maybe hazelnuts...) SOUNDS WEIRD I KNOW. You just had to try it. It was pretty damn good.\n\nEntrees, we got the roasted duck breast and Cassoulet de Toulouse--which had canellini beans,  lamb shoulder, duck leg confit, garlic & toulouse sausage. Roasted duck breast was really tender, the veggies and polenta with it were good...I thought it was better than the one we had at Redd in Napa. Food was solid, wasn't super blown away, but you can tell they definitely put a lot of thought into the food and I enjoyed it.\n\nDesserts: baked alaska (yummy rum cake with espresso ice cream and tahitian vanilla creme brulee...both were solid.\n\nHonestly, I might be okay with just ordering off the menu, but it was a great experience and I would be down to try more things here. But mostly, the ambiance was great and service was excellent as you could expect from French dining. The poor waitress must have thought my bf was a fish because he drank so much water, but she just kept on refilling without a word and without fail. We also got a cozy seat for two in the back booth and we were more than half an hour late for our reservation due to stupid new Bay Bridge traffic, but they called us and held the spot.\n\nThe executive chef, Phillipe, came to offer us the dessert menu and I saw him doing wine pairings for most people. He also wouldn't let me leave without a few pecks on the cheek. Literally...he stuck out his arm to block my pathway as he was talking to other guests to say goodbye to me before I left. Bisou bisou! \n\nHope to come back another time! :)", "author": "Jasmine C."}

When asking about the menu, he explained the menu in the most patronizing way. We asked \"how does the 3-course and 4-course menu work?\" He responded the menu is broken up in sections and pointed to each one saying \"oneeee, twooo, threeee, fourrrr. okay? so you can choose from each section. got it? oneeeeee, twoooooo, threeee and fourrr here\" YES I get it, I'm not a 4-year old. What ticked me off more was when the table next to us asked the SAME question he responded \"you start with an appetizer, then a main entree, then you can pick a seafood, and then dessert\". WTF!\n\nAnyways, food was delicious but came out slow. Between the appetizer til the main entree, we waited about half an hour. I already lost my appetite by then. The best course was dessert - we got creme brulee and french toast with ice cream. The best creme brulee I've ever tasted!\n\nAnd I added 1 star because (who I think is) the head chef is friendly.", "author": "Lian M."}

We've gone by clement many times but neither of us have noticed this restaurant. There were no lines when we got there and with our reservation, we were seated right away. \n\nAs we entered, we felt the warm and inviting atmosphere. Our waiter was so nice throughout the whole experience and explained the menu as well as answered some questions about the dishes. \n\nI ended up getting the 4 course meal: Veal sweetbreads, day-boat scallops with pesto risotto, filet mignon with bone marrow, and the french toast. The sweetbreads were plump and had a great, yet mild flavor. Scallop was firm and not chewy at all. The risotto had the perfect texture; rice was cooked yet had the slightest hardness when chewing. The highlight of the meal had to be the filet mignon. From the sauce, potatoes, mushrooms, plus the bone marrow, created a symphony of foodgasmic flavors in every bite. Filet was cooked medium rare, just how I wanted it. Then... came the finale; the house favorite: french toast with caramel ice cream. It was an incredible dessert with the warm, sticky french toast and the cold, sweet ice cream. What a great ending to a wonderful meal. \n\nThe gf ordered the mussels with frites, bouillabaisse, and lemon tart. Everything was delicious and we were too stuffed to finish all of the desserts. \n\nIt has taken me years of hearing about this place to actually trying it. And who knew it was so close to where we lived? We will definitely be coming back. Service was terrific, food was even better, and to top it all off, the chef ran out the door to thank us for coming to dinner and gave the gf two pecks on the cheek.\n\nThank you for the great meal, Chapeau!", "author": "robin w."}

I am a HUGE fan of French food and have always had high standards for it and I must say, this restaurant was absolutely perfect! Each night, the chef serves a sampler of something that he has made and for us, it was cauliflower cream soup. Omg, it was so delicious! It was light, creamy with a hint of truffle oil that was absolutely delicious!! We loved it so much that we asked the server if we could get a larger portion of it.\n\nFor the entrees, we ordered the ginger soy glazed cod and the duck confit. Portion sizes were very large! I absolutely loved the glazed cod. It just melts in your mouth and the glaze was perfect and spot on! The duck confit was good but I was definitely a bigger fan of the glazed cod. Definitely very filling and well worth the price! After the entrees, we ordered the creme brulee and the french toast. THE CREME BRULEE WAS LIKE HEAVEN! It was a huge portion and was made to perfection! The sugar was not overburnt and the custard was not too sweet and was absolutely delicious! I would highly highly highly recommend ordering the creme brulee! The french toast was good but was slightly too sweet for me but would be a suitable choice for those with a sweet tooth!\n\nParking is not too bad in the area as there are many options. Definitely need to make a reservation ahead of time for this restaurant! Slots fill up fast so you must book ahead of time or you just might be eating late at around 9-10. Definitely worth trying!

Decent price for a coursed meal that you would think would cost so much more! I had escargot for my appetizer, Cassoulet De Toulouse for main course, and their famous French toast. For my first time eating French food the experience was absolutely amazing. Did I mention I spent my 25th birthday  here and my date made sure it was special !

I came here with a bunch of friends for SF Dine About Town at one of my girlfriend's suggestions since she loves French cuisine. I've always passed by this area on Clement but never noticed Chapeau! It has a cute exterior but is quite small and can be easy to miss.\n\nI had made the reservation for 7:30pm for 6 but last mine my friend's girlfriend decided to come along too. Unfortunately because this restaurant is pretty small and they were packed that night, we could not be moved to a larger table and had to accommodate 7 people at a table that was only sufficient for 6. It wasn't really the restaurants fault and both the hostess and our waiter were extremely attentive and accommodating, apologizing for the inconvenience.\n\nThe Dine About Town Menu was $34.95 for a three course pre-fixe meal. After taking a look at their regular menu, we all found it to be unnecessary. Chapeau offers their own pre-fixe menus for similar prices and your options are open to anything on the menu. It costs additional for certain items but well worth the cost.\n\nBetween the 7 of us, we sampled most of the entrees as well as a majority of the desserts. The food was delicious. I don't quiet remember every item we ordered but each entree was as delicious as it looked. I would definitely recommend the Salade Landaise as an appetizer. Pan Seared Foie Gras was the special for the day; this would be a good dish to share since it comes in a large heavy piece. Personally i prefer the rare preparation much more but this was quite tasty as well. It was an amusing highlight that braised lamb came with baby carrots and the filet mignon was quiet tender. For desserts... the Profiteroles is a MUST !! Out of the 5 desserts we shared, this one was the best. Fresh cream puff pastries with chocolate drizzle and ice cream :) :)\n\n\nGet out to Richmond and try this place! & make a reservation so you can get a better table !\n\n- jenn", "author": "Jenn Y."}

Which is a plus for my sister and I, we talked in between courses. \n2) We ordered the escargot and foie gras for appetizers which were both very tasty and delicious. For dinner we had the boullaibaise and filet mignon with bone marrow. They were again very tasty and delightful. The boullaibaise broth was a bit salty but it was still good. The seafood was cooked perfectly. My filet mignon came out medium vs medium rare. But I didn't tell the waiter to return it, it was still good.  \n3) The chef/owner makes the effort to greet and say goodbye to you in person which was very welcoming.\n\nThe negatives - 3 stars for service \n1) The owner's wife was our waitress and you can tell she doesn't have the experience. She pretty much breezed through the menu quick, we felt kinda rushed and confused on what the specials were. Then when we ordered our cocktails I asked for which rose' bottles would be good and if I can try them, she didn't bother to tell me. She just told one of the other waiters to grab a rose bottle and serve it to me. I didn't even know which bottle it was until I asked the waiter if I can see the bottle so I knew which brand or region it came from. Again, we felt a bit rushed in ordering the food.\n2) It's a very small place and for Mother's Day weekend it was pretty packed. All of the tables were full but it was ok, that didn't bother us. What bothered us were the utensils laying out at the end of the bar vs the kitchen. That's where the waiters and busboys would grab clean utensils and set it up on the tables.  It made the bar look cluttered and kinda killed the ambiance a bit.", "author": "Liz P."}

I originally looked into this place for DAT but noticed the have their own prix fixe menu.  Then I saw they had an Early Bird menu and thought it's best to try then because it was such a great deal.  Keep in mind, their Early Bird is actually $33 (an additional $3 if you order the duck) instead of the $28 I originally saw.  Even so, it was still a great deal.\n\nI made a reservation for Sunday at 5:15PM.  Then I thought I was going to be late as I was coming from the Giants game so I called to make it later which they changed for me.  Then we got there around 5:15 afterall and they were more than willing to seat us.  By 5:45 this place got filled up.\n\nBoth my boyfriend and I ordered from the Early Bird menu.\n\nI got the Escargot: really enjoyed it, but I love butter so that's to be expected. I noticed it was one of the most popular/ordered dish as well.  \n\nMy boyfriend got the Trio of Salmon.  Both enjoyed it as well.\n\nFor our entrees I was going to get the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin but the waiter recommended the white skate wing and it was a great recommendation.  The skate tasted so tender.  it was not to heavy but I was full off the meal.  My boyfriend got the duck which we enjoyed but wished there was a bit more fat on the duck.  It was a bit too lean for both our tastes.\n\nFor dessert my bf snatched the French Toast, Soft Caramel, Hazelnut Ice Cream and as the waiter said, it is the best dessert on the menu.  It was sooooooo gooooood.  The soft, delicious, warm french toast with the perfect ice cream. awmygawd.  \n\nWanting to try something different I took the waiter's second recommendation which I think was the Profiteroles.  Four pastries stuffed with icecream served with more icecream.  It was good...but the french toast totally won that.  If we ever returned, we both agreed we'd just order two french toast dishes.\n\nThe venue isn't particularly fancy.  It was a pretty loud environment and the decor didn't shout bougie.  It was a fairly laid back comfortable setting.  And the main cook came out to talk to some diners and was at the door when we left and thanked us.

That was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nI ordered off the #SFRW menu and got: chestnut soup, bacon wrapped tenderloin and Basil Napoleon as my dessert. The soup was fairly good, similar to a lentil. The bacon wrapped tenderloin was definitely on the dryer side unfortunately. The apple-calvados sauce plus the apple made the dish a bit too sweet. I had to use the sauce because of the dryness. The best part of the meal was definitely the bread. The Napoleon had thin crepes that made it fairly good. It wasn't as sweet and definitely something I would try again. We also ordered off the regular menu and had escargot. The escargot was definitely a better starter than the chestnut soup. \n\nIt is a very small, quaint restaurant that would make a good date setting. At the end of the night, the host shook our hands on our way out and was very cordial. If it were not for #SFRW, I probably would not have made my way out here on my own.

If you're looking for a great, affordable but romantic French option, Chapeau delivers an amazing value especially if you can make it there for their $31 early bird prix fixe (5-6pm Sun-Thurs), call ahead for reservations! \n\nThe food itself was above average - the execution was great, but I would not return because I am not a fan of the preparation. \n\n* Cauliflower Soup Amuse Buche - Pretty good, and scalding hot (very much unlike Tony L's experience). It was a tiny cup, and did not make me want more.\n\n* Salmon Trio - A large piece of fresh salmon wrapped around mashed up salmon; the flavor was good, but I dislike when raw fish is ground up because it makes me wonder if they're attempting to mask the texture and flavor of bad quality fish. The complementing sauces and homemade chip was creative and thoughtful, but the chip tasted like 3-day old reused oil. Despite this, my favorite dish of the night and not to be skipped.\n\n* Chicken - The chicken had a slightly crispy skin, served over (too oily) potatoes, and filled with a veal mousse. Not a huge fan of the flavors, and overall kind of boring, but well cooked and executed.\n\n* Skate - First time eating sting ray wing, and it was surprisingly moist and delicate, very unlike anything I've ever had really. Great execution, sauce too salty and buttery, kinda boring overall.  \n\n* Creme Brulee - This creme brulee was so creamy and luscious, perhaps another highlight of the meal and topped with a thin, delicate layer of sugar. I could eat this all day, but what I really wanted was the apple galette on the main menu.\n\n* French Toast - Sliced thin, and served with maple syrup, topped with hazelnut gelato, and other sugary liquids, this was a really creative but just too sweet. The first few bites were good and reminded me of eating a Ferrero Rocher, would recommend only for french toast fiends with a huge sweet tooth.", "author": "Jess C."}

When I first walked into the restaurant, I wasn't sure what to expect. The place is pretty crowded and loud with the bar almost immediately to your left, and most fine dining places I've been to are quiet and romantic. We took a seat at our table and our waiter immediately came to greet us and get our drink orders. \n\nWe decided to go with the 3 course menu. For the appetizers, we had a salad and trio fries which was pretty good. My steak was nicely cooked for the appetizer and very flavorful. For dessert, I ordered the cr\u00e8me brulee and he ordered the French toast. I was surprised at first because French toast isn't something I usually imagine for  dessert but it was probably the best French Toast I've ever had with the bread being nice and fluffy. The price wasn't too bad for the 3 course meal, so it was a great deal, better than ordering a la carte. \n\nVery great service even though the place was pretty packed. As we paid our bill and were leaving, we hear someone trying to get attention. When we turned around, it turned out the Chef was making the rounds and was coming around to our table when we got up and he wanted to make sure we were happy with our meal. It was touching that he cared enough to chase us down the street. It was a very pleasant surprise from walking through the door to a loud, noisy restaurant to having a great meal with great service!

Having four people was perfect b/c we got to eat a little bit of everything! \n\nThe restaurant itself is a very small, plain restaurant, but has somewhat of a homey feel to it. It's atmosphere is nice enough inside that wearing a coat is not out of place, and yet also casual enough to go relax for a casual after work meal. Service isn't too formal, but all waiters are dressed in uniforms. Surprisingly, most of them actually speak French!\n\nOnto the food! They offer 3 course tasting menus where you can choose amongst the full menu list of appetizers, entrees, and a dessert. This is where having 4 people in our party was perfect. For the appetizer we ordered the Foie Gras Torchon with Brioche, Mussels and Fries, Veal Sweetbreads, and Salade Landaise. Note that some appetizers, like the Mussels, can be ordered as an entree or an appetizer, but I would order it as an appetizer so you can try other entrees. Also, the portion size for the Mussel appetizer was plenty big and could easily have been for more than TWO people. The mussels were bite sized and bathed in a delicious wine sauce (and a huge portion!). The Torchon was delicious, as foie always is. \n\nFor entrees, we got the Pork Tenderloin, Filet Mignon, Duck Breast,  and the Skate wing. Oh my, let me try to go through each dish as I just want to describe my favorite one...\nPork Tenderloin: Pretty simple, classic flavors. Nothing great and nothing bad.\nFilet Mignon: Fantastic, hearty meat with a deep rich sauce that was wonderfully soaked into the potatoes. The trumpet mushrooms add even more power to it.\nDuck Breast: This was my friends' favorite. The duck breast was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender, with an excellent lightness to it. Would definitely order again.\nSkate Wing: SO GOOD. Fyi, a Skate is a type of ray so you're eating the meaty wing of it. The meat was soft like seafood would be but still had some texture to it. But mainly, the combined flavors of the skate, potatoes, capers, and sauce balanced so perfectly for such a unique and absolutely delicious entree. I definitely had trouble sharing this plate with everyone..  :)\n\nFor desserts, we got the French Toast, Creme Brulee, Chocolate Cake, and Sorbet Trio. All were perfectly done and tasted great, but the French Toast was exceptionally good. Salted Caramel ice cream oozing over warm French Toast is a definite winner.\n\nPriced at $45 for the 3 course menu, I would gladly go again for the relaxed atmosphere, amazing flavors, and good portions.\n\nAlmost forgot, the bread they serve is hot and crispy I must've eaten an entire loaf myself... so good!", "author": "Charlton Y."}

She never smiled, placed the menus on the table and walked away.  The table seated next to us got a real server but we continued to get the wife who did not explain the specials in detail, like the server next to us did, she served us stale wine and we ultimately had to ask her twice to come and take our order.  We explained to her that we only had 2 hours before the symphony, which should have been enough time, but we ended up running out the door.

Luckily they do their own menu that's only about $5 more! From other yelp reviews, I knew it was going to be good so the foodie in me was really excited to go, even if my reservation was at 10:00 pm.\n\nAs my friend and I stepped into the restaurant, we were greeted by the owner or chef (not sure which one) and he was super friendly! The waiters hit that perfect medium of constantly stopped by to make sure we were doing okay without being bothersome. Now onto the food:\n\nFirst course: \nMussels: HUGE portion for an appetizer! And the pesto toast it comes with is amazing. I recommend getting some pomme frites and dipping them into the sauce.\nDeep fried tiger prawns: Big prawns, good flavor. Not as big of a portion as the mussels.\n\nMy friend got the extra course which was scallops. Out of everything we ate, I would say this is the least memorable since I can't actually remember what it came with. I know it was good but nothing past that...\n\nSecond course:\nChicken Dondine: Menu says half a roasted chicken but it seemed small for half a chicken but definitely enough to fill you up (my friend had leftovers)\nFilet Mignon: In my opinion, the filet blew the chicken out of the water. The flavor was excellent. The meat was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. Even though I was full at this point, I wanted to keep eating it so that my mouth could always have that amazing taste.\n\nDessert:\nFrench toast: Takes longer to come out (~15 mins) but worth the wait. The french toast perfectly complements the ice cream\nHazelnut/Coffee special: As a hazelnut and coffee lover, this was my heaven. Not overly sweet but enough to fill my desire for something decadent at the end of the meal. My only complaint is that it was too small because I wanted to keep eating it! \n\nI love how the restaurant embraces its name and hands out the bills in hats. I especially like the special touch of putting your leftovers into a tin foil basket - so cute! The owner/chef made especially sure to personally say goodbye to us as we left - he even ended a phone call just to shake our hands!

The space is nice, if a teeny bit cramped. The people are all nice, if over extended. The food is nice, if a bit pricy for what you receive! The quality is there, but something always seems missing. It's as if there is someone in the kitchen saying \"good enough\" instead of \"perfect!\"\n\nI'll give you an example of what I mean. My brother had the sweetbreads as an appetizer. Some of his sweetbreads were great, but a few (just enough!) were overcooked! Not enough to ruin the dish, just enough to make the dish just ok. \n\nI'll give you an example of what I mean outside the kitchen. The staff, who are very sincere about doing their job, would come around and try to take our dishes. \"Are you done with that?\" \"Are you finished with that?\" \"Can I take those?\" The only problem was we weren't finished and my brother and I are quick, no grass grows under our feet, eaters! It was just hot! And super hot traditional onion soup can, with that cheesy top,  have the consistency of napalm! :) At another place I might feel rushed, but these guys were super sincere about being helpful and just trying to do their thing. Only, one guy wasn't telling another guy and it soon became a little intrusive. But again, they really seemed like they were trying to be of service and not just move us along. \n\nThere is nothing bad about Chapeau, but there's nothing great about Chapeau either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-06", "description": "An extremely disappointing meal; stressful ambience and terrible service. The food is fine, but not worth the price or tolerating the rest of the experience. Here's our story:\n\nWe arrived on time for a late evening reservation on a Saturday night. The restaurant was crowded: every table was taken and the vestibule / greeting area, which feels like it's about 4 feet by 4 feet, was packed shoulder to shoulder with guests waiting to be seated. It took us several minutes, packed like sardines and listening to the owner yelling into a phone, just to get attention (actually, it required the owner snapping at the maitre d' with an embarrassing and abusive-sounding, \"Will you please seat the people?!\" to get attention). We're still in the vestibule, curtained off from the restaurant, and things are already feeling hectic.\n\nThe dining room is PACKED and LOUD. There are far too many tables in too small of an area, and there's an immediate sense that we're about to have a cheap and commoditized experience. It's obvious the management cares more about optimizing tables/revenue than ambience.\n\nWalking across the dining room, we unintentionally create multiple traffic jams of wait staff and there's an overwhelming feeling that we are in the way. The maitre d' asks for our jackets, but there's literally no room to stretch our arms and take them off. We reach across other diners' tables, careful not to dip our jackets in their $50 entrees, and eek out of our jackets. The maitre d' takes them to the coat room -- actually, some hooks on the walkway between the kitchen and the dining room -- and, in the process, creates a backup of staff trying to get in and out of the kitchen. One waiter tries to walk through the blocked kitchen door, crashes into it, and drops silverware everywhere. Oops. Fortunately, we barely hear the crash over the din of other diners.\n\nOur table is uncomfortably close to the diners on either side of us, so close that they bump into and move our table whenever someone leaves to go home or visit the restroom. My girlfriend and I have trouble paying attention to each other over the conversations happening on either side of us. We felt exposed; absolutely no privacy for intimate conversation.\n\nWe both ordered the $75 chef's menu. The staff was pleasant, but forgetful. They forgot:\n- To bring our wine (we ordered wine as soon as we sat down, but didn't get any until after amuse-bouche and halfway through the first course)\n- To bring an entire course (sorbet before the main course)\n- Silverware for our main course (we watched our rare filet mignon cook for two minutes)\n- Wine refills (we were never offered a second pour in over 2 hours)\n- To clear our plates (we spent significantly more time staring at dirty plates than eating)\n- To clean our table (crumbs everywhere until the very end)\n\nWhen the staff did bring things, they were rushed and oafish. Splashed wine. Silverware thrown down and clanged about. Rushed explanations of the dishes plopped in front of us. Basically, the service quality of a Denny's.\n\nWhen we mentioned a course had been forgotten, there was no apology. They later brought us a free creme brulee, but neither of us wanted it or had asked for it. To add insult to injury, the desserts that did come with our meal (figs in wine sauce) were literally inedible. For our dessert course, we sat disappointed with three plates: one we didn't want, and two we couldn't eat. We picked at the few bites of ice cream that weren't smothered in bitter, salty, fig sauce.\n\nThe bathroom (which we got to know well, having to sit and drink water for over 2 hours) was FILTHY. The floors were wet and dangerously slippery, and the room generally felt unclean. They say you can judge the cleanliness of a restaurant by the bathroom; knowing this, when I saw their bathroom, I considered leaving.\n\nFor two hours and over $200, we felt like we got some decent filet mignon, an enjoyable appetizer, a forgettable amuse-bouche, an inedible dessert, and an order of stress and frustration. We couldn't even get drunk because the staff never remembered to refill our wine glasses. We did enjoy the bread and butter, but the waiter forgot when we asked for more.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever felt RIPPED OFF by a dining experience. Going out for burritos would have been more relaxed and better value. It feels like all of our complaints -- the ambience, noise, forgetful staff, botched desserts -- are simply a product of greed: too many diners without enough space or staff to support them. You can tell this place could be (or maybe once was?) special, but greed is holding it back. What a disappointment.", "author": "Stefan N."}

We greeted upon arrival and thanked with a handshake and doors opened when we left.\n\nThere is something delightful when food arrives looking eloquent, creative and aesthetically pleasing your senses, you just crave that first taste because you know it's going to melt in your mouth. Everything arrived at our table like so. \n\nI loved that we were served with little espresso shots of cauliflower soup, more for the novelty and experience than anything remarkable about the soup.  \n\nScallops were perfectly cooked, light and tender, as was the duck. The salad Ni\u00e7oise was a real treat, olives, anchovies, perfectly cooked quails eggs seared tuna with a mustard accompaniment. We went for the palate cleanser which was somewhat like a lemon and ginger fresh burst in your mouth and certainly made way for our entrees. \n\nI opted for the (not for the feint hearted) cassoulet de Toulouse. Compared to others dishes i witnessed arriving at tables this was certainly the heavier (and larger) of the entree options. The duck was tender but the flavor was overpowered by the sausages and jus.

The knife sliced right through with ease. The mushroom sauce on it was also extremely good. Presentation was a little lacking as it was placed kind of off to the side of the plate; however it was delicious so whatever :-p. I did't like my salmon as much. The mussels that came with it were too salty and the hickory smoked salmon was way too hickory smoked for my liking. In fact, I felt the salmon was a little overdone.

I loved the pistachio crumble on top as well as the walnuts throughout the lovely frozen cream. SO GOOD. My boyfriend ordered the Basil Napoleon which was very fragrant but no where close to what we though it'd be.

We visited Chapeau! for a Dine About Town dinner (yes, I'm finally finishing this review. The stub was sitting in my Yelp to-do list for 3 months!). The ambiance was nice. Dim lights made us all look a little sexier. ;) Seriously, though, there's no need to dress up. I wore an Ann Taylor ruffly collared sweater, skirt, and boots. DH wore a Banana Republic sweater & khakis.\n\nDH noticed the regular menu had a \"create your own 3 course meal\" for only $40. It was only a few dollars more than the DAB menu, but had a lot more choices. Also, they have an early bird special menu (changes periodically) from 5-6 PM Sunday-Thursday.\n\nWe had reservations, which are highly recommended given how packed the place is.\n\nWaitstaff was attentive. Wow, our server actually spoke French! How nice! We were given a complimentary amuse-bouche, eggplant \"caviar\" on crostini, which was okay. Briny notes and eggplant on crunchy bread product.\n\nI ordered the Trio of Salmon, a gorgeously plated appetizer, featuring gravlax, tartar, and caviar. Very playful with the fried capers and microgreens that complemented the flavors in addition to looking pretty. Well worth ordering. DH's appetizer was okay, but not spectacular. He got the veal sweetbreads, which were hearty and earthy.\n\nMy main course was Striped Bass, pan fried. It was fine, but I've had better. The flavors were very traditional. DH was happy with his steak, it didn't seem dry.\n\nOverall, a nice place to spend the evening. We didn't get a chance to meet the chef, which would have been a nice touch. Since we got there early, before the evening rush, parking was easy on the street (angled spots in front of the stores).", "author": "Kari C."}

They are always a pleasant surprise.  I will relay the story of my latest encounter.  My friend and I came for a trip to San Francisco.  I wanted to have some really good food and I knew I could count on Chapeau!.  She had the steak and I had the mussels frites. I love their mussel frites as I can use the bread to soak up all the goodness that's left over.  My friend loved her steak and raved about the quality of the butter and the banana ice cream.\n\nChapeau! also makes really good desserts for after dinner, either if you have had dinner here or somewhere else in the area.  A little pricier dessert but worth it.\n\nI actually have been to Chapeau! when they were at their smaller location that was further down Clement Street.  And I have been at the 'new' location when it was both Clementine and Chapeau!.  Also if you can find any way to eat before 6pm, the early bird special is a RIDICULOUS deal.", "author": "John H."}

Everything here was just so delicious, but I really should start off with their staff. Everyone was so wonderful and attentive, but they also allowed us to have enough alone time to enjoy ourselves and our meals. Even when I just asked for tea, our server went and grabbed their entire box of teas to bring back to me just to let me pick what I wanted. They actually had a huge variety of interesting flavors, so other tea lovers should really request to see that box! He really went above and beyond whenever I made any requests. I can't say enough about how pleasant the experience was just because of their staff alone. \n\nNow onto the food.. we ordered the soup, scallop risotto, prime rib with bone marrow, and sorbet for dessert. I unfortunately don't remember what soup it was, but there was a shrimp  on top and it was delicious. Their scallop risotto, which is making my mouth water thinking about, was amazing. I love scallop and risotto in general so this was a must for me when I saw it on the menu. Next up was the prime rib, which was HUGE. It was meant to be shared between two people, but I'm pretty sure you could squeeze in an extra body or two to finish it. I love prime rib and the boyfriend and I both thought it was great. I'm not a big fan of bone marrow so I only had a small bit of it, but my boyfriend loved it. We then finished off with sorbet, which was a refreshing and nice way to end the meal. \n\nAfter we left, the chef ran out after us to make sure he said goodbye! He was very sweet.\n\nNote:\n- Parking here can be a little tough depending on when you come since it is in the Richmond, but you should still be able to catch a spot within a few blocks of the restaurant. Give yourself a few extra minutes to park so you don't miss your reservation if you're coming during prime time (i.e. weekend dinner hours)", "author": "Kari G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-24", "description": "In San Fran for first time in 25 years, now a foodie and wine lover and French cuisine in particular. Wanted to find two good restaurants for the evenings I had available and Chapeau was very well reviewed here and the menu was the most enticing of the dozen or so options that came to me as recommendations by way of a local. One of my criteria was that the place was close enough to downtown that I would walk back to my hotel in the financial district after an early dinner and Chapeau looked to be about an hour walk, which is just about right. \n\nSummary: great food, great service, good wines, reasonably priced, and I'd definitely return. Traditional French dishes cooked and served by [some] French people.\n\nDetails: First, let me mention that the chef came out of the kitchen periodically and greeted everyone he hadn't already greeted and expressed his appreciation for customers. He's personable and it was a very nice touch and came across as sincere. Second, let me mention that I got a waiter that is French, an older gentleman whose name I believe is Pascal, and he was a significant factor in the entire dining experience and I would definitely ask for him again if I'm able to return to San Francisco and Chapeau is still around. The menu: very traditional French options, this is not fusion or \"inspired\", it is solid French, just the way I like it. Though not on the menu online, I was overjoyed to find fois gras on the menu as a starter and so the only decision to make was the entr\u00e9e. I am partial to duck, particularly confit de canard, and Pascal recommended the Cassoulet de Toulouse. I should have listened to my instincts that were saying \"too much food!\" because every cassoulet I've ever ordered was enough for two persons - but alas, I didn't follow my instincts. The cassoulet was good, a very nice combination of sausages and duck confit with white beans of course. It could have used more herb flavors and it was a bit on the salty side but it was very good nonetheless and I enjoyed it enough to eat far beyond what was intelligent. Yes, I was telling myself \"But you have an hour walk ahead to burn this off!\" However, even an hour walk would not turn out to be enough, and with by the end of the entr\u00e9e I was unable to fathom dessert, which is a shame because the Alaskan is so highly reviewed. I must mention the wines: a wonderful Sauternes (they have several on the menu!) was paired with my fois gras and a reasonable Bordeaux was paired with my entr\u00e9e. The red was not fabulous but the wine list is good enough that were I to have been dining with a companion I would have gotten a bottle of something at the upper end, which were not too expensive.\n\nLastly, for those so inclined, the walk back to downtown is a good one, taking California Avenue all the way. Good sights, very safe feeling, some ups and downs but nothing strenuous. Highly recommend it if you are there when the weather is reasonable. Enjoy!", "author": "Paul R."}

I knew I wanted more and didn't give a rat about a loud drunk sitting next to my table.  My main course was the  bone marrow filet mignon (I didn't care for the filet mignon, only wanted the bone marrow).  The bone marrow was very rich as expected and it was great with their baguette.  The filet mignon was also served with a bed of roasted potatoes and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.  Then for my dessert, I had the Alaskan baked.  I am not a desert person so I can't say much about it.

Delicious. \n\nShe also got: the foie gras. I'm not a huge foie gras person, but she said it was \"pretty good, pretty good.\" In other words, nothing to write home about.\n\nENTREES:\nI got: the salmon dish that came with some cooked tomato, corn, green beans, and, um, chips. Yep, chips. Sounds silly, but they were SO good and went well with each bite.

I've been meaning to come here for sometime now and finally seized the opportunity for Dine About SF. First off, let me just digress and say raising the restaurant week prices to $40 for dinner basically adds zero benefit for consumers, especially when the regular menu pre-fixe is $44.50. \n\nNow Chapeau is a little French restaurant right at the start of Clement street. Walking in the decor is lovely but the noise level here really takes always from the ambiance. When I think French, I think romantic and intimate not clamorous, annoyance. That being said our server had great knowledge of the menu and actually warned my girlfriend about one of their unique dishes (cassoulet the Toulouse). However, what really rubbed me the wrong way was all the additional charges that came with each menu item. Yes, if you are thinking $44.50 for a pre-fixed is too good to be true, you are absolutely correct. Almost all the good menu items were an additional $2-$8 some were even an extra $20. What's the point of even having a pre-fixe menu at that point?\n\nThe food was about average for me. Nothing really stood out. The trio of salmon was tasty and the bread and fries that came with my mussels were probably my highlights. All in all the quality did not match the price tag.

The little voice in my head was secretly praying for the food to not suck. \"My dear lord, please let my duck breasts be crispy on the outside and perfectly tender inside.... \"\n\nMy sincere prayer have been heard. The food was excellent. I have had seared duck breasts in numerous restaurants and finally at Chapeau! I found one that I truly love. It wasn't just the most tender or the most flavorful. All ingredients simply worked in a perfect harmony to create a delightful sensation. The texture of the duck skin has a character of its own. It was crispy yet buttery - a shocking contrast to the soft duck meat. I loved every bite of it. \n\nThe only thing I didn't enjoy as much was the escargot. It was on the salty side and the flavors were kinda monotonic. The trio of salmon was delicious but a bit ordinary. Mussels were excellent. The french fries really caught me off guard. Didn't expect they could actually pull this off so elegantly. Fries were perfectly done and the sauce is a very creative twist. Creme Brulee was the second best I have had. The texture was exactly the way I like - velvety, creamy yet light. A good dessert that will not overwhelm your taste buds with the sugar and butter. Basil Napoleon was very refreshing and memorable.\n\nHave I convinced you to try this place out yet? Did I mention they have this early bird special from Monday thru Thursday? 3 Courses dinner is just $28 if you came in 5pm-6pm.", "author": "Mona W."}

Shockingly poor.\n\nI made reservations about 1.5 months in advance go celebrate our anniversary. I received a call almost a month later saying that the reservation had to be canceled because the restaurant had to be closed for a couple days. This notice was provided in a no-nonsense \"we are canceling your reservation\" type of way.\n\nOkay, fine. I ask if we can be fit in later that week. Nope, they're all filled up for weeks (not surprising; this is why I made reservations 1.5 months in advance). Didn't even bother to say when the next available date would be. I was told to try to find another day to reserve online. Thanks but no thanks.\n\nLook, I understand you're high-brow and fancy and probably have no trouble filling your tables any day of the week. Still, treat your customers with some respect when you cancel reservations they made 6 weeks in advance on them. There wasn't even a single apology for their unexpected closure.", "author": "Pierre B."}

We had reservations at 5:45 and arrived promptly and were seated accordingly by the hostess. Shortly after receiving our menus and perusing for a couple minutes, the waitress came over and explained everything to us because it was our first time. She was very patient and explicit with everything, mentioning surcharges and specialties and such. After strategizing and debating for another short while, we all decided on what we would have. \n\nFor myself, I had a 3 course meal with the Trio of Salmon, Caniard, and Baked Alaska. The salmon, along with every other dish came out beautifully presented. The salmon was delicious and prepared beautifully; the outer layer of salmon was especially delicious in my opinion. Next was my caniard, and it  was perfectly cooked. A little pink in the middle with the skin crispy. There was polenta with some veg on top which was nice and creamy. I cleaned off the entire plate without hesitation. My baked alaska was honestly nothing too extraordinary, but I have to defintely applaud the almond because the texture was so surprisingly crunchy! \n\nMy family also had 3 course meals which included: (apps) escargot, foie gras, oysters, (mains) bacon wrapped tenderloin, cassoulet, bouillabaisse, (desserts) creme brulee, hazelnut french toast, and the rum cake (: \n\nI don't wanna go too into detail on each because that would be a lot to write, but basically everything was delicious. The cassoulet, however, I do have to point out that it may be a little underwhelming. Huge disproportion of beans compared to meat. Given, our waitress diiiiid warn my brother that there'd be a lot of beans. It wasn't amazing but in any other setting, I would have thought it was a pretty solid casserole. Again, it is a casserole, we made that connection a little late hahaha My mom really enjoyed the bouillabaisse also! She kept saying the entire dinner, \"this is how a bouillabaisse should be\" and was kept quiet for the most part with it LOL\n\nCHAPEAU! exceeded every expectation I had going in (: if and when I can, I would go back in a heartbeat.

The veal sweetbreads surprised me -- they were so savory and tender. Scallops were cooked perfectly and the salmon was fresh.

My bouillebaisse's seafood and fish was excellent and cooked perfectly. Though I noticed my dad's scallop was much smaller than mine, about half the size only. The broth could be hotter as I prefer my soup not to be just lukewarm; the flavor was really good however.

I had the rack of lamb or maybe more precisely lamb chops as there were 4 decent sized chops perfectly medium rare pink in the center,  served over a bed of au-gratin style potatoes.   I also got to try my better halfs duck breast... it was moist and sliced thick enough to get the full flavor... it was something special.\n\nI loved my valrhona chocolate lava cake... it was perfectly paired with a super creamy, rum-raisin ice cream,  a fitting side-car to my cake.\n\nThe service was friendly, helpful, and uber-attentive... some people may view this as \"hovering\" but I appreciated their attempt to keep the table clear of used dishes.  Perhaps the busboys were a tad over-zealous but I wasn't overly offended or rushed.  Chef Philippe also took the time to see us out and made sure everything this evening was alright... good man. \n\nDress code is dressy casual -- I wore a collared shirt and neat jeans without a jacket. There were other couples where the gentleman was wearing a jacket and tie so don't be too worried about being overdressed and fitting in.

It was stacked on top of 2 fish filets, and those were good, and a smattering of clams and mussels. The soup was quite heavy and towards the end, I could barely finish the last bit.

Then I noticed that our entrees were also served with a sweet glaze when it should have been a bit more salty.\n\nI think I would come back and give this another shot hoping for a better experience.", "author": "Jeanne L."}

I ordered the bouillabaisse which wasn't bad but i wouldn't pay $40 for it. As for dessert, the French toast and rum cake was good. Food was good but not that great for the price. It wasn't worth it. I've paid less for better quality/ tasting food. \n\nThe service was TERRIBLE! We waited on average 20-25 min for our next course. It took them 20 mins to take our order. We made reservations but they still had us wait for an hour. On top of delaying our table, it took them 30 mins to get us some bread. Come on! I just can't stress how much time we wasted here waiting to be served. The manager there is fake. When we told him we  needed more time to figure out the bill, he turned around, rolled his eyes and shook his head. He pretends to be all nice and shake your hand but I got a glimpse of his face/reaction when he thought no one was looking. \n\nOverall this place is extremely overrated.

However as I was asking her another question, so said ok bye, and promptly hung up on me.\n\nWe watched the couple next to us be brought a desert on the house for their anniv with a candle and everything...so when they asked if we wanted a desert we figured ok they are asking us and will also bring us a happy anniv desert...but nope nothing extra and they actually charged us for the desert!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-10", "description": "When I eat French food, I experience such a bliss that it takes me a couple of days to come down from it. I usually take my sister and together we wax poetic about our gastronomic adventures...sometimes we even sing about it. \n\nAlas, that is not my mood tonight. I am beyond furious and I am thinking that I may need to find a new restaurant for my French adoration because I have been spurned by Chapeau!\n\nFirst, we got to the doors about 5 minutes early and were told to wait. No big deal. But when 5 p.m. came and went, I began to worry slightly. See, it was cold and blowing in a rain storm off the sea so waiting on the sidewalk left much to be desired. Add to the fact that we traveled from Hayward to the city in Friday traffic, of course we were going to be early because getting reservations to this place is getting harder and harder- but it isn't because of the service, after tonight I can be sure of that.\n\nWhen we were seated, we noticed that the pictures save one had been removed and that the wall had a bare, naked feel. Our server came over, an Ethiopian gentleman, and did not introduce himself, but asked if we wanted wine. Do you remember my fear, dear reader? You can read the first review of Chapeau if you need to refresh- because that fear was going to become a reality tonight. Another thing we noticed was the staff had a tight, fearful yet angry feel- you know the feeling when you are at a dinner party where the hosts are fighting? Yeah, something like that- people going into the back room and returning with angry faces, or fearful looks over their shoulders. I wanted to ask if the restaurant had been taken hostage and were they being forced to attend dinner service under duress. \n\nWe made our orders. And the waiter did something that had never happened before- he tried to up sell us. For those who don't know, that is the practice of trying to get you to buy more than you want. We made our order and waited......\n\nFirst course was awesome, they really know how to serve fois gras. I love the texture and flavor of a masterfully crafted plate. This is when things started to go bad...\n\nThe water never usually gets below half full- not tonight, tonight it was empty and I had to actually ask for a refill...then the table of doctors arrived and our waiter just left us. Actually the tables around us, save the doctors table were abandoned. We had to wait for random servers to take pity on us, and when our main course came, the manager served it- thank God or I don't believe we would have eaten!\n\nThe food in the main course was a disappointment. The Bouillabaisse was bland. I have never had a bland thing out of that kitchen! The fish was prepared wonderfully but the broth was bland and missing something. In fact, all of the people at my table agreed, it was like the saucier was on vacation or something. There was a layer missing- leaving the dish ok, but not up to the Chapeau standard that they, themselves set.\n\nSo we completed the main course and we were still missing our server and I am starting to get angry. Let's face it, the recession has left everyone with less money and things I usually got to do every month or two is every three or four instead. So I relish it when I am able to go out to French food.\n\nI started complaining and how did the waiter respond? By giving us a dessert before our dessert course. We were all getting dessert with the prix fix menu- so I am really confused to what this was supposed to achieve. Then after I start complaining the waiter goes and apologizes to my father. My father wasn't paying the bill- I was. This came across as rude and sexist.\n\nWhen the bill came the waiter- who during dessert had taken to coming by every 3 minutes (this doesn't make up for the neglect during the meal). This also got under my skin but all Hades broke loose when the server asked if we needed a cab. Remember reader, we stuck with water! \n\nI asked wither he thought we were tourists and if that was why we received the horrid treatment. Well Mr. Attitude thought I was out of line and started to lecture me, \"Ma'am, I always treat ALL my people with respect\" (Really? Then why were you slobbering all over the doctors' table and ignoring everyone else in your section). Well I was beyond furious and asked to speak to a manager. HE ARGUED MORE WITH ME. I don't know if him getting angry would make me say, \"Hey, you know what you are so right- those other people are so much important than me- you go and do what you want and I will just sit here and suffer quietly since I don't deserve your service\". Not gonna happen. I told the manager and she said she would make it up to me next time. But to be honest, I don't know if I will go back.\n\nNo one should have to be angry after they eat French food. The food quality is slipping- there was obviously no one on the pass checking quality and the food was served in a sloppy hap hazard way. Je suis tres trist!", "author": "Hanna C."}

Ended up picking a wine I liked! \n\nWe started off with bread which was crispy and warm, just how I like it. Then the complementary soup which was served in a tiny cute cup. It was cauliflower and white truffle... OMG it was the best thing of the evening! A sip but it was super flavorful.. Wish I could've had more! We ordered the 4-course each which came with an appetizer, tasting fish, entree and dessert. I had the escargot (a little bland, but was super soft and easy to chew), scallop and risotto (super tasteful), duck breast for the entree and it was one of the best duck dishes I have ever had!!!! So crispy and flavorful!!! Sooooo worth it :D! For dessert I had the basil Napoleon which had fruits and some sort of mango pur\u00e9e pudding thing which was tasty too! My boyfriend had the duck salad (which I did like more than my escargot), same scallop dish, filet mignon and bone marrow (the meat was super tender but not as flavorful as the duck!) and the chocolate molten cake.

The appetizer was delicious-- a pastry filled with bleu cheese fresh greens on top. My boyfriend's French onion soup was also heavenly. Lemon Ginger Sorbet cleanser was good. **Remember people-- a palate cleaner is NOT  a dessert. It's not meant to be overly sweet** The kale ravioli dish was pretty good (didn't blow my mind though). Too much kale in the middle but the pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly. The chicken entree I got a long time ago was amazing.

From the warm service to the close seating quarters, I could have closed my eyes and imagine being in France again!\n\nPascal, our server, was top-notch! So attentive, happy, patient and friendly. He even walked us out of the restaurant at the end of our meal, opened the door for us and gave us big kisses on the cheek. So adorable.\n\nThe food was tr\u00e8s bien! The sliced baguettes arrived warm and toasty with a rather large pot of rich creamy butter to spread to your heart's desire. We started with an Amuse Asparagus Soup with a light drizzle of olive oil, which was simple, flavorful and savory. The Trio of Salmon was texturally on point and extremely delicious to boot. The Tomato Soup with a Fried Prawn was fantastic as well. I've tried to make tomato soups to go along with my grilled cheese sammies, but they've always underwhelmed me. Chapeau!'s made me a believer in the generic tomato soup. \n\nThe Filet Mignon with Bone Marrow (2!) and potatoes was my favorite out of our 3 entrees. The combination of lean filet with buttery marrow is genius. My Mussels were fantastic as well and the fries came with 2 savory sauces - a rouille and an herby aioli. No complaints about the Seared Duck Breast either - unique seasoning and spicy jus. Yum!\n\nThe desserts...oh man. The French Toast is literally a slice of french toast. I thought it was just a playful name for the Salted Caramel and Chestnut Puree that it came with. Rich, cold + hot, and truly decadent. The fruity Basil Napoleon was refreshing and a great choice if you're too stuffed. The Baked Alaska was my favorite - rum spongecake...rich chocolate sauce...toasted almond slices...coffee ice cream...and meringue...I just have no words.\n\nI dock 1 star because the hostess, who I think is the owner's wife, seemed extremely impatient with the table next to us and her face showed it!

This was a great location because we could people watch the entire restaurant and see outdoors too. They do not have valet service, so parking was a challenge.\n\nWe opted for the 3 course meal, but decided to add raw oysters at the beginning (so really 4 courses). I have never eaten a raw oyster, but I was assured that it was properly prepared by my dining companions and cut up slightly to make it easier to eat. You could either add lemon or Red Wine Vinegar Mignonnette. Now I can say I tried them and will go back to eating cooked ones. Not to say they were bad, I ate 2, but could not eat any more.\n\nI had the Trio of Salmon which was delicious and I adored the mini potato puffs with the capers.

I don't know what the pecking order of wait-staff is, but I suspect bartenders must be quite good as they need to be able to handle mixing drinks, pouring wine, and also serving food with makeshift dinner mats and place settings.  \n\nWe ordered a selection of entrees and appetizers:\n\nEscargot - an always decadent dish with plentiful butter and garlic.  Piping hot and quite delicious....\n\nFrench onion soup - a bit light on the cheese and not a very thick broth.  Tasty though.\n\nCassoulet - consisted of duck confit and braised lamb shoulder.  The duck confit was delicious and the lamb shoulder tender.  Lots of beans....\n\nVeal medallions - cooked perfectly medium rare, the generous size medallions looked delicious.\n\nSkate wing - a very generous portion of skate, that was tender and tasty.  The sauce had a large amount of capers though and the flavor was a bit overpowering.\n\nChef Phillipe walked past the bar area several times and I have no doubt he's the reason this place is so successful.  While the stereotypical French place may seem stuffy and full of attitude, he imbibes the restaurant with friendliness and great cheer.  He chatted with us a few times through the night and I was particularly intrigued when a patron ordered the ribeye dish for two.  It looked stupendous.  After an average experience with chateaubriand, I was reluctant to order another steak dish so soon.  But seeing the ribeye (which I love better than filet), I should have.  It was accompanied by two large bone marrow and looked gorgeous.  Next time!\n\nOur bartender/waiter was able to let us order just the bone marrow (since we had our other entrees) and it was great.  Little stuff like that makes the difference.  \n\nChapeau! remains a great find in the Richmond.  Classy, romantic, but also super-friendly and accessible, we had a great experience.  Thanks to Chef Phillipe and his staff for being the site of our special celebration.\n\nChapeau! takes credit cards, including American Express.", "author": "Randy F."}

Our waiter was so pleasant and patient with us, I was so amazed when I looked at how much time had passed. I never felt rushed or disrespected, which was absolutely amazing. Definitely deserving for the 20% tip i left him!\n\nThe DAT menu was just a limited selection of what they usually have on any other night. We ordered:\n\n- Trio of Salmon: This was my FAVORITE! I love salmon and i really thought they did a great job with all the different flavors. It was fresh and the portion was perfect.\n\n- Skate Wing: This dish is the reason that I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5. The first wasn't really tender and it was extremely salty. I feel like this wasn't a good combo with the salad on the side..and it was not particularly pleasing to the eye.\n\n- Pork Tenderloin: The Pork Tenderloin was DELISH! They really knew how to cook it so it wasn't tough and didn't dry out. The apple was so a sweet touch to such a savory dish. Definitely enjoyed this entree quite a bit.\n\n- Creme Brulee: The dessert portion was much smaller than the one I had at Isa..but it was also really good. The caramelized sugar on top wasn't too burnt and had a good flavor/texture.\n\n- Pistachio Mousse: This was a really unique dessert. I didn't appreciate it as much because it was really strange to me...especially after have the creme brulee. The mousse was bland to me. If I had it before the creme brulee, I think i may have been more in love with it.\n\nFANTASTIC selection of wine..and LOVED their red selection. All of this on top of superb service and a friendly hello from the chef...I will definitely be back!!", "author": "Jennifer S."}

You are busy, still preparing fairly priced and generally well prepared French fare to many people ,... but tonight it appears that you forgot that we are YOUR CUSTOMERS and we likely require a little more than just a cursory drop of the menu and wine list. \n\nGranted - we called at short notice earlier today and we got a table in the bar area (which now appears to be fully used for diners - so why not tear the damn ugly space out and put proper seating in there for all of us late planners!?) but we sit there not infrequently and usually get proper service?\n\nTonight the French fellow working the bar area decided that the busboys and runners are all we and the four top next to us needed and he basically just ignored us all night. Never asked about our apps or our entrees and I almost had to send up fireworks to get noticed for a check ! Really he just \"dialed it in\" and if he worked for me he would be unemployed by tonight.\n\nMy wife and I don't need servers to hold our hands or even stop by often - but I expect it when I arrive to take my order, and after each course - just as a check in. Seems like a basic ?! Tonight I think you took my order and dropped off the check after the owner pointed out we had been sitting there w an empty table for way too long !?!\n\nOh, I'd like a coffee w my dessert. You never asked. And we heard later about a special dessert not on the menu and the tart of the day not from you but by overhearing another waiter at the other tables mention it !?\n\nI'll be having that coffee at home, thank you. The service is better there and that is where half of your expected tip will be...\n\nSeriously,...in such a small space w such a simple menu the basics cannot be forgotten and tonight they didn't even exist.\n\nWhat was a reasonably well prepared meal was badly impacted by ZERO SERVICE and the unfortunate bussing staff covering for you.

It tastes really good, but I usually would prefer a lighter bouche to clean up my appetite and get ready for the incoming food.\n- Trio of Salmon (3.5/5): the salmon is supre fresh and the plating is beautiful but the seasoning was just ok, it was a little bit salty and I wish they would give a little bit balanced seasoning sides.\n- Green Salad with mixed nuts and Balsamic Vinaigrette (4/5): the salad was actually amazingly fresh and the dressing is well balanced. I really like the mixed nuts within it. But I would probably never order a green salad in this kinda fine dinning restaurant. The only reason we did cuz my friend is vegetarian.\n- Tomato soup(3.5/5): it was a lil bit sour for me.\n- Pork tenderloin (4/5): it wasn't overcooked but it was a little bit dry. I think they cooked it wrong they used the way to cook filet mignon to cook the tenderloin. The Apple-Calvados sauce was really good and the side dish kale and Parsnip pur\u00e9e made up for the meat for sure.\n- Baked Alaska (4.5/5): this is probably my favorite dish of the night, definitely highly recommended. It's a rum flavored cake with candied toasted almonds inside and italian meringue outside. Also they have the espresso ice cream inside. They sprayed the almonds and chocolate sauce on the plate. There are just so many things on the plate, but it was plated beautifully. The flavor wasn't too creamy but fresh!\n- Vanilla bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (4/5): the reason I ordered this cuz I love creme brulee, but I was kinda disappointed since they made it a little bit too thick. I love the thin creme brulee with nice crispy on top.\n\nService and ambiance (3/5)\nI wasn't happy with the service cuz they are only super nice to the French people or their friends, maybe cuz it was a Friday evening, so they were supre busy. We literally waited for almost 20 mins till the waiter came to ask us what drinks we would like to order. I guess the upside is that the executive chef always came out to ask around how's the food. \nIt was too noisy for a fine dining restaurant and they put the small table supre close to each other, which I literally can hear the next table's convo.\n\nMaybe I would go back again on a non-busy night give a try since I heard so many good things about Chapeau! Towards the end of the night, our waiter left for his shift, the replaced waiter was really frenchy and nice. I wish I had him as my waiter for the whole night instead.", "author": "Christina Y."}

Waiting area is small, none really just an area to check in for your reservation and then you have to go outside and sit on a bench.\n\nThe seats we were sitting on had bread crumbs all over.\n\nWhat made me disgusted was the restroom.

I give it a 4 because I did enjoy my meal here. But to be honest, I was expecting a bit more. It didn't help that the hostess who greeted us had a stick up her a$$. And I had to really question myself if it was me who had a skewed perception of her, or if she really was indeed, RUDE. My husband agreed that she was hurried and rude. She practically threw the napkin onto my lap. I could do it myself, thank you. And then she was giving me the look over. \"Girl, I'll knock your head off your neck, but I'm a lady tonight, so I won't show my ghetto-ness up in here.\" That was the thought that crossed my mind. \n\nI didn't feel comfortable sitting where we were because it was elbow to elbow with the people at the next table. \n\nThe appetizers were traditional onion soup and escargot (snails) submerged in garlic, butter and pesto (?). The soup was ok; it was a bit on the sweet side but my husband liked it just fine. My escargots were good, but I would have liked a bit more snail than all the fixins it had. I used my bread to sop up the stuff. The escargots were on the small side. \n\nI ordered sweetbreads, which I didn't tell my husband what sweetbreads were until much much later. Otherwise, he probably wouldn't have touched it. He didn't like it, even before he found out what it was. I was pleasantly surprised he didn't run out to the restroom to retch. The sweetbreads were yummy (I know I'm disgusting!) paired up with the porcini mushrooms. Delectable. \n\nOur entrees came. My hubs had the halibut and I, the pork tenderloin paired with bacon. Both plates were good. My husband liked his fish way more than I liked my pork. It was a bit tough, less tender than what I would have preferred. The greens that came on the side with the mashed potatoes threw me off. I didn't like the aftertaste. \n\nDesserts were a winner. My chocolate cake started oozing out chcolate the moment I cut into it. Dang, like that? Yes, sirree, like that. Delicious and sinful, perfect for someone not watching what they consume in sugar.

If you're looking at a hat logo, you're in the right place. If you don't know which door to enter, it's the one on the right! I hope that happened to more people besides me....\n\nReservations for a party of two. Definitely get yourself a reservation. You're already on yelp! Open tables is as easy as it gets. Do it and you won't regret it. Arrived about 15 minutes before the reservation because we lucked out with street parking. \n\nWe both got the 3 course meal which is extremely worth it! I know how to eat my money's worth, and if that is something you like to do, 3 course is the way to go. You basically pick from any appetizer, entree, and dessert. \n\nWhat's for dinner?:\n\nAppetizers\nTrio of Salmon- YES. This was really tasty!!! Mountain of raw fish and a few pieces of roe. Confusing eggs on the side probably meant just for decoration but I love eggs! So even though I thought it was random, I didn't mind too much. \n\nFrench Onion Soup- MMMM. It was quite tasty as well. Nice portion and great melted cheese! Being someone who loves cheese, I could always do with more but if you've got the entire surface covered, you're doing a good job! The soup is more on the sweet than salty side. So whatever you prefer I guess?\n\nEntrees\nFilet Mignon- HELL YES. If you aren't getting the filet mignon, you aren't eating your money's worth. Do yourself and your tummy a favor: order this. A MUST! Amazing mushrooms, sauce, roasted potatoes, and cooked to perfection. I finished my entire cut and practically licked my plate clean. \n*PLUS you may also add bone marrow for an additional $5 so I didn't hesitate to do that! Perfect with my meal!\n\nCassoulet De Toulouse- EH. I can definitely do WITHOUT. Good thing for me I ordered the filet! My boyfriend ordered this one. Had a bite and thought THANK GOD THAT'S NOT MINE. It was cooked well but nothing amazing or foodgasmic in your mouth. \n\nDesserts\nFrench toast- YES YES YES. The French toast was amazingly toasted. The sauce was a perfect compliment and the ice cream was a plus. I couldn't get enough of this. \n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e- YUM. Definitely a decent sized dessert to yourself. Thick layer of sugar which is my absolute favorite part. And the vanilla bean was satisfying. Not too sweet and still managed to taste great. \n\nI was hoping for a mixed drink with my meal but it looked like everything was just wine. I decided to pass. But by the end of my meal, I was incredibly satisfied with my meal and the service. I was constantly getting my water refilled without ever having to ask. Some people complained about the inability to hear or have their own conversation, but honestly it's not that bad. It's a small restaurant so don't expect so much people! If you're having inappropriate table talk, then I can see why you would be so upset at the possibility of being overheard, but we were able to have a conversation just fine. A few times we giggled about what the table next to us was talking about, but that's on you. Keep your private conversation down, and your problem is solved! To get into my seat I had to turn sideways to get between the two tables. Of course, while people are eating, they don't want a face full of your booty so make sure the bigger person sits on the outside, another problem problem solved.", "author": "Kristina L."}

It was delicious.  For my entree I had the Atlantic salmon, and I didn't like it as much as I wanted to.  It was very moist and tender, but I just didn't like the sauce that was with it.  My friend's duck breast entree was delicious, especially with the polenta.  For dessert I had the Basil Napoleon, and the basil sauce was a bit too strong for me.  I loved the French toast that my friend had.  Sweet and soft, it's definitely something to get next time again.", "author": "Karen L."}

Most French restaurants of this caliber are double the price. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for dinner earlier this evening and I could not be more excited to write this review.  We ordered the chef's prixe fixe menu for $65/person.  They also offer a 3-course prixe fixe menu for $40/person, in addition to their quite extensive a la carte menu.  Normally, the portions at French restaurants are on the small side, but we left completely stuffed!\n\n\nThe chef's prixe fixe consisted of:\n\n- Cauliflower amuse bouche\n- The landaise salad (which we ordered because they were out of their usual Nicoise salad) - one of the best things I have ever tasted.  It comes with fris\u00e9e, duck confit, and smoked duck magret.  SO GOOD. \n- The halibut carpaccio,  topped with toasted hazelnuts and some finely chopped tropical fruit.  The contrast of flavors and textures of this dish were amazing.  Salty hazelnuts vs. sweet fruit, buttery halibut vs. crunchy hazelnuts, I think you get the picture....\n- Lemon-ginger sorbet to cleanse the palate\n- The filet mignon - was very tender and nicely accompanied by oyster mushrooms and potatoes\n- Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e -  perfectly light and creamy\n- Warm chocolate cake with banana flamb\u00e9e & rum-raisin ice cream - heaven on earth\n\n\nAltogether, it was an absolutely delicious meal from the first bite, to the last.  Every dish was equally outstanding.  Also, the very friendly head chef, came out to greet us several times throughout our meal, a nice touch.  The only thing keeping this from a perfect 5 stars is that our server forgot bring one of the appetizers I ordered, and I asked twice about when it would come.  \n\nNonetheless, this place has amazing food, with reasonable prices.  I highly recommend.", "author": "Juliana K."}

I have never been disappointed coming here through the years.  The service is always excellent and the Chef/owner comes out to greet everyone personally.  A wonderful touch in my opinion.\n\nTo start, I ordered the Creamy Roasted Chestnut Soup.  The soup was rich and creamy but not too overpowering with chestnuts.\n\nNext I had the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin, Parsnip Pur\u00e9e, Kale, Apple-Calvados sauce.  Overall the pork tenderloin was just right, a little pink inside but not too rare.  The parsnip pur\u00e9e was delicious.  It was creamy with a hint of sweetness.  But what ties the entire dish together was the Apple-Calvados sauce. I would literally drink a whole bowl of it if I could.\n\nTo end the night, I ordered the special dessert (which I can't remember the name at the moment) available for the Dine About Town menu.  I'm personally not much of a dessert person but it was surprisingly good, creamy top layer and a somewhat crunchy bottom one.  However my all time favorite would be the French Toast, the caramel sauce is to die for.  \n\nFor those of you unable to get reservations, call Chapeau and ask whether there are any available bar seating.

We definitely thought it was a great way to cap off the entire weekend.\n\nWe both got the 4 course tasting menu which allows you to choose whatever you want off the regular menu to build your courses. Of course you still are limited to picking from the apps, entrees, and desserts per course...you can't just pick 4 entrees in case you were wondering haha.\n\nEverything was seriously D-Lish. The waiter first brought out a little taster \"compliments of the chef\", it was just a spoonful of a creamy pesto, fingerling potato and ham...but what a bite! It was one of my wife's favorites of the weekend haha.\n\nWe got into our appetizers soon after, I had the sweetbreads and she got the salmon carpaccio. I seriously loved the carpaccio, honestly one of the best sashimi/fish carpaccio appetizer type dishes I've had. It had a really light and buttery vinaigrette over the top of it all, with crunchy toasted hazelnuts, fried garlic chips and a few other herbs and spices and sprouts. It was seriously just good shiz between the contrasting textures and flavors. awesome! The sweetbreads were good too but it was just a little big and rich for an appetizer. I'd totally recommend it if you're down with sweetbreads.\n\nOur next dish was our tasting fish of the night which was a scallop on top of a pesto risotto. Another home run dish for chapeau, there's few scallop dishes that I would put above this one that I've personally had. The Risotto was of perfect consistency, not to creamy and to soupy, it was just perfect and the pesto went really well inside of it. The scallop was seared exactly right, and on the bottom of everything sat a brown butter sauce, that had a hint of sweetness to it to help pull it all together. Loved this dish immensely!\n\nfor the entree I got the filet and the wife got the pork tenderloin. I personally thought hers was really good but wouldn't have wanted to eat the whole thing. It was a tad on the sweet side for me, but to each their own because she loved it and thought it was better than my filet. Me on the other hand loved the filet and wanted more of it. Again it was topped with more french butter sauciness in a mushroom reduction. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was the melt in your mouth steak  that everybody writes about when they've had a good steak. \n\nWe ended the meal with the lava cake and the french toast...I'd go with the french toast any day of the week. I love lava cake, but it was just so rich and to end a rich french buttery meal with more rich was just blah. the warm french toast cut through it all, and the ice cream on the side helped too.\n\nGreat food, decent service, and alright ambience and all at a price that makes you smile...i'd give it a solid 4.7 stars", "author": "Calvin C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-29", "description": "In choosing what business would get my 100th review, the choice was easy! Chapeau! (got to add the \"!\") is by far one of the best dining experiences I've had at this point in my life. A few have referred to the restaurant as the \"Poor Man's French Laundry\", and since I think I'm going to be 'poor' for awhile, Chapeau! is a wonderful treat. My first dining experience here was with friends for the holidays and then with my boyfriend, for just a last-minute, we should do something special to celebrate meal (what we were celebrating, I can't even remember anymore). The have a great assortment of appetizers, my favorite being the salad with grapefruit (not currently available) and the foie gras. My favorite dish is hands down the tasting fish, which is more often than not the Scallop Risotto with Lobster Sauce. This was a great recommendation from my aesthetician, Ennee of Pink Cherry Spa. The dish only comes with one scallop, but it's huge, cooked to perfection and the sauce is so creamy! I usually hate risotto, but they make it just right here. Honestly, whatever I get as an entree is kind of an after thought and is usually finished off by my boyfriend. I haven't found an entree I'm completely taken by, but will keep trying them out until I do (so far I've had the sea bass and the duck breast). I'm really not sure why I always go for the 4 course prix fixe when I would be happy without the entree, but I guess it's not really dinner without the entree. By the time dessert comes around I'm stuffed, but the French Toast dessert is so good here, I always find that little bit of room to eat a bit more. \n\nService is spot on here -- for our holiday dinner, they informed us well in advance that our last minute reservation could only be accommodated at the very front of the restaurant, near the entrance, and it may be a little bit cramped. FYI - last minute here can sometimes mean 1-2 weeks in advance. This was fine, as we were just lucky to grab a table (indecisive friends made me late to make an rsvp) and the staff remained very attentive. Chef Phillipe is very friendly, so don't be shocked if he has a conversation with you while you're eating, gives you a peck on the cheek or shakes your hand. Servers do their best to be on top of things and will readily admit when something about your experience is under par. The last time I was there, dessert and our bill took long to get to us as the kitchen was backed up, so they provided us with a small sample of another dessert as we waited. So many other restaurants and their staff are not as quick to address their mistakes (I'm talking about you Radius, but I'll get to that in another review). \n\nThis is a great place to take a significant other for something special, as opposed to someone you are just getting to know. At least for me, the ambiance of this place may be a bit too much and the experience a bit too special to waste on someone you're not crazy about it. I also thought this was a wonderful place to take a small group of friends for a \"coming of age\" type of dinner, you know, where you all get to feel really fancy and a lot older than your high school days, order food you may not know how to pronounce, laugh about how you don't know how to pronounce it, all while enjoying delicious and elegant French cuisine.", "author": "Ghia G."}

I didn't notice the \"shredding lamb shoulders\" nor the unique lamb taste, but it's ok. we were joking about getting some boba pearl drink after this, until we had the dessert.  the creme burlee was probably the best one we've had.  the nuage de noix, though  not big in size, was SUPER rich and tasty, with a lot of different kind of nuts and creme, and unique orange taste.  We were full and satisfied.\n\nI end up paying $134 (18% tips).  Yeah it's expensive, but it's unique enough to recommend to visit at least once.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-01", "description": "Chapeau is a French Restaurant in the Lower Richmond District on that great restaurant filled Clement Avenue.  I was looking forward to eating here and ultimately, left not all that impressed.\n\nIt's your typical overpriced restaurant with ok tasting food but nothing that will go down as memorable other than the excess butter in everything.\n\nThat being said, the ambience of Chapeau! and the service were decent although they forgot to serve me my Pinot Noir with my Prime Rib.\n\nThe menu is rather confusing in that it is cluttered and awkwardly explains things.  For example, there's Menu #1 which indicates you chose an appetizer, entree and dessert where menu #2 indicates that you order an appetizer, an entree, and a fish taste (??) whatever that means.  To make matters more confusing, the \"fish taste\" wasn't even fish but a choice of either mussels or scallops.  Correct me if I'm wrong but from what I recalled in my high school biology class, those aren't fish.  If I'm paying $100/person, I expect fish when I choose a fish taste.\n\nI will say that the scallops, which was the only fish taste available, were not all that bad.\n\nFor my other dish I had a 1/2 dozen oysters which was the best part of my dinner.  This is, of course, because they weren't poisoned with excess butter and raw oysters are among my personal favorite things on the planet to eat.\n\nI had the Prime Rib and can't say I was all that impressed by it.  The au jeux seemed more like KFC gravy to me for some reason and wasn't sizzling hot as I would've expected.  One appetizer that I thought was pretty good was the heirloom tomato salad.  That was my second favorite dish.\n\nFor an extra $5 or so, you can have a super citrussy sour palette clearer prior to your entree.  I forgot the French word used to describe this but I must say I did enjoy that distraction.\n\nAll in all, some key things were accomplished at Chapeau: I had a fun time with friends in a comfortable environment and some of the food and drink was good (very good cocktails).\n\nBut the main dish, dessert, and \"fish taste\" were all far too rich for me to ever wanna come here again.  Sure sure, I know: \"it's French cooking, so...you SHOULD expect butter.\"  But I retort: \"why is it that whenever I go to Paris, and pay 1/2 the price for French food, that, the quality is so much better over there and I never get distracted by excess butter in my plate?\"\n\nMaybe it's simply because I was on vacation so I ate at a slower, less hectic pace.  Or maybe, there's just a lack of quality in all French Restaurants in America?  I can point to two other French restaurants that are much better than Chapeau in SF.  I will not give names, but, one's in the Castro and the other's in the Potrero Hill Neighborhood.\n\nHad fun here, but cannot say I was overly impressed either.  It's definitely not a 4 1/2 star place.\n\nI wouldn't give this less than 3 stars because it does taste ok.  It's just that I personally am not a huge fan of blatantly overly rich foods which I wasn't expecting at such a popular establishment.", "author": "Tony U."}

Only reservation available for that evening.  Since I was with my 11 yo daughter, the waiter was extremely friendly . We were seated at the first table right next to the kitchen. Didn't mind, at least we would get our food first. Sorry, can't recall our waiter's name, but he spoke French. He was very funny and asked us to order in French....well the question was directed to my daughter:). \n\nWe ordered the 3 course( prefix meal for about $45.  My daughter ordered the appetizer corn soup, entre mussels and pome frites, dessert warm chocolate cake. I ordered the escargot and the white fish in a broth, but didn't know I had to drink the broth. The soup was very rich and tasty. The fresh French bread was hot when provided prior to appetizers, very soft, and crunchy on the outside, the best. Forgot to ask if bread is made there or not.  The corn soup was very rich, sweet and tasty. The escargot had quite a bit of garlic, but very yummy and hot, so be careful not to burn yourself.\n\nThe waiter showed us how to eat the mussel the French style by using one shell and pulling the muscle out of the other shell, which was new to us. My daughter loved the mussels, garlic, wine soup base, French fries, she ate everything.\n\nMy halibut was tasty as well with the crunchy kale, bread with melted cheese. Didn't know the halibut came in a soup broth, until the chef/owner came out to explain how to eat the meal.  Normally, the chef/owner comes out of the kitchen to greet his patrons.\n\nLastly, the dessert, warm chocolate cake takes about 20 minutes to make. My daughter was so full, she refused to eat the cake at first, then gobbled the entire dish up. I ordered the trio of sorbet...just perfect, very light, but finished the mango and raspberry flavored. Unsure of the third flavor.\n\nIn addition, our check came in an actual hat, very fun.....The waiter helped my daughter put the hat on for pictures.\n\nOverall, great service, about 2 hours to eat a 3 course meal for 2. Thought we would be finished by 630, but ended up leaving at about 7PM.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-30", "description": "I have been here many, many times. To give you an idea, I have been a patron of Chef Philippe's since his first Chapeau! when it was on 14th street, and had dined at this current location when it was called Clementine. Fast forward to now where it has been renamed to Chapeau! after Philippe closed the other location down.\n\nHaving been a longtime patron, I have tried *every* single dish on the menu and off the menu. The food here is always excellent, and barring some minor details (I will get to it later), never fails to please me and my family. Admittedly, my favorite dish of all time was the foie gras, but ever since the CA ban, the Salmon Trio has filled the spot quite nicely.\n\nTasty and fresh, the dish doesn't overwhelm the palate. The salmon's subtle flavor and texture is emphasized and added to by the caviar and fried capers, and the micro herbs with lemon dressing is a nice complement that doesn't overwhelm the dish. I highly recommend this one to first timers.\n\nYou are always given a complementary Cauliflower soup in a small cup that is rich and creamy. I gotta learn how to make this!\n\nFor the main course, you can (almost) never go wrong with the Prime Rib and bone marrow. It is actually intended for two people, but if you are two females sharing, you will have enough food for a third person (female). It comes with steamed spinach and baked potatoes n' Cheese, along with three sauces that you can choose from for your prime rib. The potatoes n' cheese is always baked just right - the inside is soft and gooey without being overwhelming with its cheese, and the potatoes are always cooked through.\n\nThe best dessert to me is the Baked Alaskan - with a hard crunchy exterior and a gooey, soft rum cake on the inside with espresso ice cream, this is one dessert not to be missed!\n\nCons\nThe ones I would avoid: I had the Cassoulet de Toulouse twice now, and it's always been bland. There's nothing special and the beans just overwhelms the dish. It basically felt like I was eating a fancy baked bean dish...which I guess is what it is, so there you go. I have to admit though, I am bias as I don't particularly like beans.\n\nChef Philippe once had a rabbit dish on the menu. I don't ever recommend it. It was incredibly bland and a bit tough to chew.\n\nWhat else...there are so many dishes, to review them all would make this an essay! So I am going to move onto the service.\n\nThe service here has been on a slow decline. We have been getting more and more snotty or rude waiters where they either were inattentive or took a long time to get us a refill of water, or outright was condescending. In the last case, we have experienced this twice from two different waiters. The most recent one was fired, according to Philippe. Guess we weren't the only ones who got the attitude. Today, we had a white, tall, bald waiter who never checked in on us. It was quite a feat to get his attention for refills or extra utensils, and our tables were never cleared off except when the next course arrived and there was no space. The waiter even dropped a pen on me, which hit my thigh tip down before bouncing away. When I brought it to his attention that something dropped and hit me, did he apologized? No. Instead, he assured me it was just his pen and not to worry. Uhhhh...dude, you just dropped a metal pen on me, a customer. When I was a waitress, it is expected you would apologize for HURTING A CUSTOMER. Not to mention, he was rude when we asked him a few questions about the new dishes, as if the questions were stupid and he was so put upon to answer them. That's one star down.\n\nAs for the food, I tried the Boneless Roasted half chicken dodine today and it wasn't too bad, but not something I would get again nor recommend. The sauce was a tad too salty and the chicken meat was flavorless.\n\nChef Philippe and his wife are lovely and I expect to continue patronizing their restaurant, but today...today was just a not a five star experience.", "author": "C C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-01", "description": "I made reservations for 2 at 8:30 pm on a Friday night, but due to the extreme difficulty of finding parking in the Richmond area, we were running late. When we arrived at 8:45 pm ( I had called them to let them know in advance we were running late) the host was very accommodating and friendly. It was a full house, but he suggested we ordered drinks at the bar while we waited. He walked back several times to make sure we were okay and to assure us that a table was being prepared for us. A man presumably the owner greeted us with handshakes and conversed with us as if we were old friends.\n\nAt the beginning of the meal, we were served with complementary sample sized cauliflower soup- extremely delicious. The aromatic taste of pureed cauliflowers and creamy soup was delectable.\n\nFor our dinner, we ordered half a dozen oysters, french onion soup, Filet Mignon with bone marrow, and Poached Alaskan Halibut in Mussel Sauce.\n\nOysters- For $3 an oyster, I was expecting MORE, literally. The oysters we got were extremely small, 2 of them were almost nonexistent. Just the black tips of the oyster and some goo on the shell. However, they were very fresh and completely sand free. It would just have been nicer to actually have a decent sized oyster for 3 bucks a pop.\n\nFrench Onion Soup- Served on a hot clay ladle, extremely hot & cheesy & onion-y. In more simple terms, it was mouth watering- scrumptious. \n\nFilet Mignon with bone marrow- Filet Mignon was tender and seasoned well, the bone marrow was very fatty and exploding with flavor. \n\nAlaskan Halibut with Mussel Sauce- Halibut was seared to perfection, crispy outer layer, but supple inside. The sauce was amazing and complemented the fish very well.\n\nBoth entrees seemed to be on the smaller portion sized (served on a BIG PLATE), but neither of us could finish our meal. So in retrospect, though it may have appeared small, it's more than enough. At the end of the meal, our waiter was very kind in bringing dessert with a candle to my boyfriend for his birthday. I had let him know the occasion and he surprised us with the kind gesture.

For entrees we ordered the Scallop Risotto (a special that night), the Filet with bone marrow (out of this world), and the Bouillabaisse.

The hostess inside the establishment spotted me crossing the street heading towards the door and made sure to have the door open for me by the time I reached it. Who says chivalry is dead? (although she was technically female..)\nOur server was great!! He was super friendly, courteous, funny and wonderful.

He took pictures for us and even offered to take a picture for us OUTSIDE the restaurant for better lighting purposes. Talk about going \"above and beyond\". He was, in one word, fabulous.\nThe chef went out of his way and made sure he introduced himself to every one of the people in the restaurant and made absolutely sure to bid Au Revoir to us when we left (when we were already outside, mind you). You can't get any more personable or courteous as that.\n\nFood:\nI don't know which was better the food or the service. Because, honestly, they were both ridiculously praise worthy.

Fresh and just the right texture.  The ghee and parsley mixture was just right - not too greasy at all!   Personally I prefer a super crispy sweetbread (think fancy chicken mcnugget) and these are more traditionally soft.

The warm, personal atmosphere is lively (a little noisy, but friendly) and I like how the service has a personal touch.\n\nFor starters we had the trio of salmon (gravlax, tartar and salmon caviar with egg mimosa, creme fraiche) and the mesclun salad. I loved the salmon trio; the caviar added a nice bit of salty bite to the refreshing taste of the gravlax, and with the fried capers (my favorite touch) and creme fraiche the salmon was especially delicious. The mesclun salad seemed a little heavy on the dressing side but very good.\n\nFor our entrees we chose the wild-caught skate wing and the Prince Edward Island mussels; the skate wing, delicately flavored with a fantastic sauce grenobloise over tender fingerling potatoes and croutons, was easily the highlight of my meal. I ended up spooning more of the butter sauce on my fish than I intended (I probably need to detox today). The crouton bits were a little on the hard side and I liked the mache without the dressing, but those were the only things that I might have had differently. Delicious!\n\nDessert was nuage de noix - something I've never had admittedly - pistachios, almonds and hazelnuts (nougaty) in a creamy dessert. The nougat was a little sweet for me, liked the sauce and the dusting of powdered pistachio on top.\n\nLiked how the chef comes to greet all the diners personally.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-15", "description": "Let us all take a moment of silence to commemorate and celebrate Chapeau's success in putting the city of San Francisco on the world's map for fine French cuisine with an American twist.\n\nExecutive Chef Philippe Gardelle's wonderful talent of transferring his mind full of beautiful poetry into a meal can be readily appreciated by those that are fortunate enough to pay a visit to this quaint bistro on Clement.  In operation since the mid-90's up until its move to the Richmond in the fall of '09, Bay Area residents have been treated to the \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" that frequently come out of the mouths of the anticipated sold-out crowds at this establishment as they peer down on their beautifully crafted plates as well as their neighbors'.\n\nIts no surprise to anyone that it requires one to make a reservation well in advance considering the space seats 49 (with an additional 12 at the bar), but Chef Philippe personally welcomes all of his patrons as if he was throwing a family dinner, every night, for a family of 49.  As you walk in, it feels as if you're immediately transported to another world (for those of you that have seen the movie \"Midnight in Paris\") by the charm and finesse of Gardelle and his well-trained staff.\n\nEven with reservations, there have been many times where there was a significant wait after the allocated time slot.  I don't blame them, it must be difficult to get people to leave their chairs here.  However, I never did mind the delay since the spacious bar is always stocked with a flurry of options for scotches, cocktails, and spirits I haven't seen anywhere else.  Its really a nice place to just have a pre-dinner glass of wine.\n\nI have never been a big fan of escargot but was willing to give it another shot with the traditional escargots de borgogne served in butter, parsley, and (yes!) garlic.  As I took a good scoop into my mouth, my taste buds quickly turned from hesitation to exhilaration and I knew right there and then that I had to prepare myself for an excellent dining experience.\n\nSome of my other favorites on the appetizer list include, but are not limited to, the french onion soup, P.E.I. mussels soup served with creme fraiche, parsley, and garlic croutons, as well as the salade landaise, which is prepared with frisee, duck confit, fingerling potato chips, and classic french vinaigrette.\n\nAs for the main course, you can never go wrong with any of their seafood options such as the wild flounder but my all-time favorite item would be the filet mignon served on a bed of pommes de terre landaise topped off with king trumpet and oyster mushrooms.  It really does excel compared to many steakhouses out there.  As such, it is usually an extra $6 to select this item on their prix-fixed menus but is well worth it.\n\nConclude your experience with the always refreshing trio of sorbet with hazelnut basket and apple compote, or one of my personal favorites, the tahtienne vanilla bean creme brulee, and you'll feel like you just had a meal fit for a king.\n\nJust to elaborate a bit more on the service, I will provide an example from one of my experiences dining here.  One time, my friend had accidentally knocked over a glass of wine on the table and immediately, several of the wait staff came over and started to clear everything off of the table.  They quickly replaced the soiled tablecloth with a brand new one (we saw the top of the table completely bare) and replaced every item in exactly the same position it was before.  They were extremely quick going about their business and within 5 minutes, it was as if it never happened and we were sitting at a new table!\n\nChapeau has clearly become my favorite French restaurant in SF and I would easily choose to go here over Gary Danko or Michael Mina.\n\nThank you Chef Philippe & company for letting the rest of us in on your passion and dedication to the craft and congratulations to your continued success!", "author": "Tony L."}

The apps were solid and my main course (a vegetarian stuffed pumpkin) was excellent. Everything was very rich (as expected at a French restaurant) and flavorful. One other bonus - they offer 1/2 glasses of wine so you can switch it up by course if you want to match each without going overboard.\n\nWe'll definitely be back to try everything on the menu.

This will definitely be a go-to spot for special occasions.  \n\nOur reservations were for 615pm, we arrived on time and were seated right away, and the house was already packed, considering they open at 530p.  \n\nWe ordered their special for the day, a prix fixed selection of; 2 apps, an entree to share and 2 desserts.  They came out with freshly baked bread and a tiny bowl of cauliflower soup.  So good.  Our 1st app came out, seared scallop over a bed of risotto, OMG AfcknMAZING!  2nd app was just a ceasar salad; nothing to really brag about but it was really good as well.\n\nFor our entree we order the bone-in rib eye steak.  It was literally the size of my leg, HUGE!!!  (I like it big, but daaamn) ;) they brought it out whole and sliced it at our table, it came with 2 bone marrows for each of us.   Our waiter suggested to order it medium rare and I'm so glad we did.  It was moisture in your mouth, melted butter that required almost no chewing, it was ORGASMIC, it was succulent.  The bone marrow was just as good.  WOW!!!  Still fantasizing over that bombass piece of meat!!  \n\nFor dessert we ordered the lemon tart w/raspberry puree, a little to heavy for me after a meal we just had but was very good.  Also the french toast w/salted caramel ice cream, hmm, was good but was too soggy for my taste.  \n\nAll in all, it was a fabulous  experience, will be back.  \nOH, our waiter, forgot his name, an older french dude with a thick french accent was great!!

So I say \"I made reservations...etc\", the hostess apologizes says they are very busy today.  At this point I guess we should have just let, but after looking for parking for 10 min we decided to make the most of it. \n\nPros: It's a cute place. The owner was super friendly and nice, checked on us a few times. My husband liked his dish, he got Cassoulet de Toulouse and said it was great. I tried it, and it actually was pretty good.\n\nCons: We were seated in the middle of the restaurant near the kitchen, and a few times the waiter bumped into us. I ordered Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin, except that's not what I got, instead it was just a mixture of random things which didn't taste good.  Perhaps it was just because there were busy and messed up.

My friend's salmon was also nothing spectacular and tasted a little dry. \n\nAfter our mains, I ordered the french toast dessert, and she ordered the molten lava cake.

We arrived 15 minutes late for our reservation last night, so we were dining from around 9:30 to midnight. It was fantastic. I had the escargots, the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, and the profiteroles for dessert.  Everything was delicious. Dessert mind you, was on the heavier side, but tasty all the same. \n\nI went with a group of friends. We had just seen the new Woody Allen movie Midnight in Paris in the Embarcadero before heading over here. I think the French theme for the night was entirely coincidental. \n\nPhillipe is an excellent owner/manager/chef. You can tell that he works hard to make sure that every single guest has the best dining experience. He greets you when you enter and when you leave. He also checks on many of the tables through each diner's meal. When a waiter knocked over a glass of water at the table across from ours, I think I saw Phillipe's eyebrow twitch! He was very calm though and checked on those customers to see if they got wet at all. \n\nComing to Chapeau! after going to Chouchou for the last dine about town dinner I did was awesome. At Chouchou, the waiters were icy and yelled at each other in the kitchen within an earshot of all the tables. I'm pretty sure I heard a couple of putain de merdes! being thrown around there.\n\nChapeau! was....ah....lovely.

Sad to say but I was not impressed.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*Service:\nLike other yelpers, I found myself looking around for much of the night wondering when the waiter was going to come take our beverage/wine order, when the waiter was going to take our food order and had to wait 15-20 minutes to get our check. When the server was actually at our table, he was super polite and helpful, but with a full restaurant on a Sunday night, you need to have more than 1 waiter for 10+ tables.\n\n*Chef that everyone raves about:\nYeah he did greet people and sit down with some tables near us which is nice. The strange part though, was that all night, he passed us multiple times but never a hello or smile.  He ran after us when we were walking our and as we were about to walk about the door, extended his hand for a handshake and said thank you. I appreciate the gesture but it felt like it was something he \"had to do\" to live up to the expectation as opposed to sincerity.\n\n*Food:\nIt was good but not spectacular.  People raved about the french bread and wine but I got regular bread and my wine was okay. I ordered the salmon and my dining mate got another fish entree. We shared the duck salad and chocolate cake dessert.  The salmon was baked and tasted a bit over cooked, the duck salad was good but it wasn't finger (fork) lickin' good. \n\nIt's very difficult to get a reservation on a weekend so if you plan on coming here, call early!

This was a very memorable experience and I find myself wanting to go back all the time.\n\nWe sat in the back corner booth which was a perfect spot in the restaurant. Our server was incredibly friendly and over the top French, which was ideal. I even spoke French to him without him making fun of my accent even though he was from Paris. He set up a floor standing wine bucket in front of our table for the bottle of champagne we brought and we both agreed that was a nice touch. Corkage fee is $18.\n\nWe did the pre-fixe appetizer, entree, and dessert. I ordered the French onion soup, the Lamb with ratatouille (special for the night), and French toast. My boyfriend ordered the trio of salmon, filet mignon with bone marrow, and baked Alaska. Before the appetizers, our waiter gave us complimentary little cups of cauliflower soup with truffle oil, which was comforting and creamy. The French soup was a little different aka lighter than most. It doesn't have the excessive amount of cheese and bread on top. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the ratatouille was a great addition. Any time this is a special, I highly recommend ordering. To top everything of, the French toast was absolutely amazing. I would come back just for this! It is one piece of warm toast with caramel ice cream on top and it is excellent. Do not split this dessert, each get your own. I promise you will want every last bite! I can't even comment on my boyfriend's meal, except that his filet was pretty amazing, because I was so obsessed with my own meal.

That's probably the first time I ever hugged a chef and I had just met him too. My immediate first impression was good coming in, although there were a few things that left me with a not so great lasting impression.\n\nFirst I was thankful that the server warned me that the Cassoulet de Toulouse which is highlighted in yelp is actually a very dense, heavy casserole. Glad I didn't order that. Nevertheless, the food I ended up tasting was average/below average at best - although beautifully presented, the main entrees lacked flavor in my opinion. The bacon wrapped pork I had was dry and very flavorless, I didn't want to continue it after 1/4 way through. I tried my boyfriend's mussels and also felt like they were more on the bland side. On another note, the appetizer I had wasn't bad, the Trio of Salmon was pretty good with an interesting combination of ingredients (although a diabetic man sitting right next to us kept complaining relentlessly about it). For dessert the creme brulee was good although I don't think I've ever had bad creme brulee. The Basil Napoleon was not what I expected at all - I assumed it would be a puff pastry with cream and the fruits listed but it turned out to be ultra thin crispy sheets between acidic fruit and custard. It sparked a reaction (I've had these fruits before), that made the roof of my mouth and tongue itchy and unpleasant - again I didn't want to finish my dessert *GASP* On the bright side, the complimentary bread we had in the beginning was delicious, crispy and warm.\n\nI really didn't like the atmosphere of the place since the tables are so close together that I was either lucky enough to hear the whiny people next to us complaining about the food OR on the other side, have an older lady's butt continuously graze the side of my table, worrying each time that she would nudge some plates over. I most likely won't be returning since there wasn't anything on the menu that really interested me in the first place, and the things I did try were disappointing.", "author": "Sandy T."}

We were guests of a friend whom we had not seen in over 7 years and had reservations.

I was a tad skeptical at first about all the Chapeau hype on here, however, like many of you I was not disappointed.\n\nWhy I came here?  --  Yelp hype and recommendations from friends.\n\nWhat was good?  --  Oysters on the half shell:  Fresh and simple.  Served with a red wine and vinegar sauce.  I love the simplicity.  Be sure to enjoy a half dozen or so to start off your meal.  --  Chestnut soup: rich, creamy, and earthy.  I couldn't keep my spoon out of my friends' bowl.  (Shame on me!)  --  Nuage de Noix: A rich ice cream-like dessert.  Perfect combination of smooth and crunchy.  The ice cream is smooth and rich, while the roasted nut blend whipped into the concoction provides a bit of a crunch. \n\nMy verdict?  --  The food is on par with all the hype on Yelp.  For this, Chapeau! deserves 4 stars.  The extra star is from the stellar hospitality of this place!  I believe the owners are the French(?) chef and the Asian hostess, husband-wife duo.  I was greeted by the Asian hostess with a big smile.  She walked me back to the table where my friend was seated.  On the way bag, the owner/chef personally greeted me and shook my hand \"So glad you can join us.\"  Once we were seated, he greeted my table once again.

Unfortunately I arrived late, so I missed out on the appetizers that the gals were oohing and ahhing over. \n\nEveryone liked their entrees as well.  We tried the Skate, Duck, Pork Tenderloin, Branzanio, and Mussels.  My Mussels came with a nice broth of white wine, shallots, and parsley.  I enjoyed them but was more interested in the crisp and salty Pomme Frites.  We went crazy for the rich and smoky rouille (like an aioli) and asked Philippe about its ingredients.  He told us and also mentioned that except for the bread and sorbet, everything was made in house.  Next time I'll get my own Branzanio dish instead of mooching off my friend's plate.  It was fantastic.  \n\nFor desserts, we tried the Chocolate Cake, French Toast, Protiferoles, Nuage de Noix, and the Basil Napoleon.  All were great!  My Basil Napoleon had diced bits of Pineapple, Mango, Banana, Kiwi, and Strawberries with cream and four paper thin overlapping circles of pastry.  I loved it but next time I'll get the Nuage de Noix (\"Cloud of Nuts\").

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-03", "description": "The evening started out less-than-promising.  We had an 8:30pm reservation for a friend's birthday dinner and weren't seated until after 9pm.  We weren't alone.  The small entryway was packed with other parties awaiting their tables as well as a good number of us huddled outside in the cold.  To his credit, the owner/chef was very apologetic and made his rounds among the crowd, keeping each party updated as to the status of their reservations.\n\nWhen we finally were seated, our busboy asked if I would like him to check my coat for me.  Nice.  This doesn't happen at every fine dining establishment that I visit.  I looked over the menu and decided to go with the customizable, 3-course option.  I started with the sweetbreads appetizer, chose the skate wing for my entree, and finished with the french toast dessert.  Here's the breakdown:\n\nPorcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads - Possibly the best sweetbreads dish I've yet to experience!  Delicate, creamy, and served over an aromatic truffle sauce so delicious that I wanted to lick the plate!  Definitely the star of last night's meal!\n\nWild Caught Skate Wing in Brown Butter - The skate was flaky, tender, and practically melted in my mouth.  Its fresh flavor enhanced by the presence of the rich and fragrant browned butter which was accented with a hint of lemon.\n\nFrench Toast with Hazelnut Ice Cream - Buttery, caramel-y goodness.  The \"toast\" slices were sweet, moist, and fluffy with a drizzle of caramel sauce and perfectly complimented with a scoop of hazelnut ice cream.  I didn't want to share, but didn't have room to finish it myself!\n\nMany of my friends ordered the filet of beef with a side of marrow bone, which I got a taste of and was quite delicious.  The staff was attentive as well as the chef and we were comped additional appetizers and desserts to make up for the delay in our reservation, which I found to be very classy.  The chef also took the time to see us out personally and explained the situation in detail.  We had good food, good drinks, and good service.  All is forgiven. :)\n\nI'm definitely coming back for those sweetbreads and french toast!", "author": "Catherine P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-26", "description": "I had no idea that I would end up dining here on a casual date night, but boy, it was an experience to remember!\n\nI came here on a Sunday night - \"J\" booked a 9pm reservation a few hours prior with no problem. When we arrived, we were greeted by none other than Executive Chef Philippe himself (although I did not know who he was at that time!). With a welcoming smile and handshake, he immediately escorted us to our table. After a server came to explain to us how the menu worked, we decided to order \"Menu 2,\" which was the 4-course menu.\n\n*FOOD*\nI ordered the French onion soup (appetizer), scallop with basil risotto (tasting fish), filet mignon (entree), and french toast w/ salted caramel ice cream (dessert). We also got complimentary dishes (which I will mention in the \"Service\" section below)! To start off, the soup was perfect! The scallop dish was simply exquisite, especially the risotto which I am obsessed about (it wasn't too creamy nor too dry). I pretty much had to hold back tears at that point, hah! I do wish the dish consisted of more than one scallop, though. As for the filet mignon, although the meat came out to be medium rare as requested, it was slightly chewy and not as tender as other filet mignons I've had where the meat easily sliced away with a knife. It wasn't anything bad, but it was not the best piece of filet mignon I've had - the potato and mushroom accompaniment were very good though! As for dessert, it was the best French toast I've ever had (and what they recommended too)! The salted caramel ice cream that came with the toast really balanced out the taste of the French toast and although the dessert sounds super sweet, it really wasn't overwhelmingly sweet at all!\n\n\"J\" pretty much had the same courses as me, except for his trio of salmon (appetizer) and trio of sorbet (dessert). The trio of salmon was delicious and a must-have if you like raw fish. The trio of sorbet was nothing special so I suggest choosing another dessert that's more worthwhile.\n\n*DECOR/AMBIANCE*\nThe restaurant itself is rather small and the decor is nothing spectacular, but if you want a place where you can have a quiet conversation with someone, this might not be the place. It was actually quite loud in the restaurant seeing how each table/group is only about a foot or two away from each other. We fortunately sat next to a very nice man who was dining alone and had a lovely conversation about the food with him. (= The couple who sat to our other side, however... they would not STOP MAKING OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. I tried so hard not to throw up my precious food that was happily sitting in my stomach. I've never seen anyone PDA to this extent at an upscale restaurant. Even the group next to them whispered among themselves about it. So as a side note to the couple who sat at the corner back table on 11/23: please get yourselves a room far, far away from here.\n\n*PRICE*\nA little over $50 for a high-quality 4-course meal? What more do you want?!\n\n*SERVICE*\nThe service here is what really shined the most on top of its excellent dishes. As I mentioned earlier, I initially didn't know that the man who escorted us to our table was in fact the main chef of the restaurant. That alone says a lot about the restaurant, when the main chef performs \"normal\" duties like other staff members. I finally realized who he was when he stopped by our table after we ordered to talk about his new \"fake\" foie gras creation, which he explained with such passion and charisma and in which he was very proud of! Surprisingly, after the convo, Philippe went into the kitchen and brought out complimentary faux foie gras for us to try (it was so smooth and tasty)! Another reason why I think the service here was excellent is because no matter how late you stay to finish your meal, you never feel rushed to leave nor do they forcefully try to make you leave. We arrived at 9pm and did not leave the restaurant until a bit after 11:30pm even though the restaurant officially closed at 10pm. While we were enjoying our desserts well after 10pm, Philippe came by our table once again to check up on us and then as he walked away from us, he shouted towards the kitchen something in French and a few minutes later, out came another dessert dish which were \"compliments from the chef\"! All of the other staff members were courteous and on-point when it came to refilling water, etc. (someone even came by to fold my napkin at the table when I went to the restroom). As we were about to leave the restaurant, Philippe stopped us at the bar area and cheerfully \"demanded\" that we give him hugs and kisses (first time I ever kissed a chef on the cheek! Oh, the French!). My only regret is that we didn't take a picture with him - he is so passionate about food and so down-to-earth, and his laugh is absolutely contagious! Thank you for everything, Philippe!\n\nThis is my new favorite French restaurant! I definitely will be coming back. (=", "author": "Victoria V."}

We came for Dine About Town and I actually decided to veer off the DAT menu and go with a normal Prix fixe menu ($38) so I could have Salade Landaise and Cassoulet. These are simple, rural dishes that I had as a child living in Europe that I haven't had in many years.\n\nI enjoyed the Salade Landaise, thinly sliced confit de canard and a small, pan-fried piece of magret de canard (have I mentioned I like duck?) over a simple salad.\n\nHowever, I found the Cassoulet to be nostalgic but underwhelming. Though the duck leg confit (cooked differently this time) was delicious, I found the beans to be relatively bland and a little undercooked; two kinds of sausage served in the cassole did not fit into the overall dish and served only to distract from the delicate flavor of the confit. Plus, it is very heavy because of the beans and the lamb mixed into the sauce (which, by the way, I had lots of trouble tasting..)\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't have staked all my hopes on the quality of their duck dishes. It was actually unintentional because I didn't realize the cassoulet came with confit de canard when I first read the menu.\n\nAnyway, I was able to choose a creme brulee (my default) for dessert. I thought the creme was good, but the crust could have been warmer and a tiny bit more charred to give that deep caramelized taste which the great vanilla bean cream can offset.\n\nPerhaps I will return one day to try other things, but it's kind of an expensive gamble the way I see it...", "author": "Josh K."}

We each ordered a combination of the following dishes (which was not all of the items on the DAT menu)\n\nFirst course\nFourme d'ambert Tart: frisee salad, anjou pear, balsamic reduction\nTrio of Salmon: Gravlax, tartare & caviar, egg mimosa, fried capers & creme fraiche, micro herbs w/lemon dressing\nDeep Fried Black Tiger Prawns: shredded phylo dough, tomato & onion marmalade, petits l\u00e9gumes, herbed a\u00efoli \n\nMy co-worker said the tart was almost like a dessert, it was so sweet but delicious. I had the salmon and loved how fresh the fish was. Capers are an acquired taste but I enjoyed them with the creme fraiche to add to the salmon. One of my co-workers knows the owners, so Chef Phillipe brought us complementary Tiger Prawns. Though they were deep fried, there was not a lot of batter.\n\nI also added Escargot de Bourgogne since I have not eaten escargot in years and have been craving it. The escargot does not have the shell so they're easy to eat but also extremely hot. They are marinated with butter, garlic and parsley and taste very much like pesto.\n\nSecond course\nSauteed striped bass: roasted garlic yukon gold mashed potato, shiitake, king trumpet & oyster mushrooms, caramelized pearl onion, with bordelaise sauce\nBoneless roasted half chicken dondine stuffed with mousse of veal & green peppercorn, challot confit, white mushroom & bacon w/sauce au poivre vert\n\nThe bass was very light as was the sauce accompanying it. I had ordered the chicken and loved how earthy and rich the flavors were. The meat was extremley juicy and tender, not overdone at all.\n\nThird course\nTahitienne vanilla bean creme brulee\nnuage de noix: roasted pistatchios, almonds & hazelnuts in a frozen chantilly & italian meringue, orange soup\nLemon tart\nProfiteroles\n\nThe nuage de noix one of my co-workers orderd was very refreshing and light. I had ordered the creme brulee and loved how it wasn't overly sweet and had lots of the carmelized sugar on top. The chef had sent us two more desserts: the lemon tart & the profiteroles. I really enjoyed the profiteroles as they were basically creme puffs but they were not extremely rich as they were also covered in melted dark chocolate. To me, the lemon tart was extremely sour but it could have also been since I had already taken bites from the creme brulee. Both my co-workers enjoyed it though.\n\nThe waiter was very patient with us as we tried to settle the number of people in our group since many canceled on us. Chef Phillipe constantly check in on us to make sure we were enjoying the meal and made sure to say good-bye to each of us as we left. Overall, among the best experience I'ved had at DAT.\n\nNote: They are not able to accomidate for groups over 6. The restaurant is quite small with street parking very difficult to find.", "author": "Kitty K."}

Superb French meal that exceeded my expectations.  \n\nMy family and I took my mama here to celebrate her birthday and it was definitely the right choice.\n\nService:  I called two days before and luckily scored a reservation at 5:30pm on a Saturday.  We were greeted by the Chef and seated immediately.  Legit.  Our waiter had a very thick French accent, which was hard to understand at times.  He even called us madam and misses. Gentleman brownie points.  I was tempted to joke and say bonjourno monsieur but held back.\n\nThey served unlimited fresh sliced baguettes which was awesome. What was best was that we didn't have to ask the waiters for refill. They knew wassup and gave us another fresh basket right away.  We probably went through 5 baskets of those bad boys. The bread was extra crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just the way I like it. \nOh, and every time you walk away from the table or if the napkin is left unfolded on the table, ::ZOOM:: next thing you see is a waiter re-folding the napkin back in place. \n\nFood:  We all went with the prix fixed three course meal for $38.  I made sure each family member got something different so we could sample each dish.\n\nAppetizer (in order of my favorite)\n- Pan Seared Foie Gras w sliced apples (additional $6)\n- Traditional Onion Soup\n- Trio of Salmon: Gravlax, tartar & caviar, egg mimosa, fried capers & cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, micro herbs with Lemon Dressing.\n- Tomato Bisque with deep fried crab cake  \n\nEverything was divine.  The Foie Gras was bomb diggity ding dongalicious.  It had a nice crisp on the outside topped with a pear glazed sauce.  Once you bite into it, it melted like butter.  That's a big statement coming from someone who usually doesn't like fatty meat.  The sliced apples gave a crisp contrast taste with the Foie Gras.\n\nThe onion soup had a great cheesy crunch on the top and right when you dive your spoon in, you enter a heaven full of melted cheese, crunchy bread bits, and onion soup.  Best part was that it wasn't overly salty like most onion soups.  One step closer to obesity? Perhaps.  Delicious?  Oh, you know it, baby.\n\nThe Trio of Salmon had a beautiful presentation.  The smoked salmon was light and complimented well with the dressing.  I actually really enjoyed the little fried capers sprinkled around, it gave a nice texture to everything.\n\nNow the only appetizer that was slightly disappointing was the crab cake with tomato bisque.  I like my crab cake extra crispy but the ball came a little soggy since it was placed in the tomato bisque.  However, the crab and the tomato bisque had a great consistency.  Dip the bread into the soup! \n\nMain Entr\u00e9e:\n- Rack of Lamb special served in a bed of au gratin\n- Filet Mignon with oyster mushrooms and stir-fried potatoes (additional $6)\n- Salmon with red bell peppers and sweet corn \n\nOut of these three entrees, the rack of lamb wins hands down.  My dad got it done medium and it was so tender, juicy, moist. Any word that makes you want to reply with \"that's what she said.\"  I wasn't a big fan of lamb until I had this perfectly cooked meat. \n\nI had the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was juicy and tender.  Not as tender as that lamb though.  The mushrooms and potatoes went great with the sauce and meat.  Best filet mignon I've ever had? No. But definitely up there. \n\nBoth my mom and bro got the Salmon for a healthier option and after trying them meats, it sure tasted healthy! It came crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  It was served with this spinach puree sauce I wished had a little more flavor so I decided to stick to my meat. \n\nOnto Dessert! Finally! \n- French Toast with soft caramel and hazelnut ice cream\n- Tahitian vanilla creme brulee\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake, rum-raisin ice cream, caramel sauce.\n- Basil Napoleon maui pineapple, manilla mango, banana, kiwi & strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream\n\nFrench toast. ::drool::  Just get it. It was heavenly.  It came out warm and soft with this amazing caramel sauce and went great with the ice cream. My whole family scarfed that baby down so fast like a nascar.  \n\nThe Cr\u00e8me Bruelee came in a big portion! I likey.  I do wish the top was more crunchy, but it was light and not overly sweet.  \n\nHoly cow, did I need some milk for this Chocolate cake!  It was extremely rich and creamy.  Right when you pop that sucker out...warm chocolate oozes out so fast.  My family couldn't finish this because it was too heavy. \n\nAnything that tastes too healthy to me does not have that yummy factor.  Basil Napoleon had great chopped fruits in it but it was nothing comparable to the others..  \n\nMy parents have been to Paris multiple times and claim this was better than the meals they've had there.  Afterwards, the Chef said goodbye to us and we got to take a picture with him.  Coolios.\n\nOverall, a clutch 5 star meal. Well done, Philippe Gardelle.", "author": "Cam C."}

It's still an enjoyable place - and obviously successful judging by the crown on a Wednesday night - but it's changed a lot:\n\n- Wait Staff.  We brought our own bottle of wine, a sentimental favorite, and the waiter seemed a bit unhappy when it became apparent we weren't ordering drinks from the menu.  It took about 20 minutes and a couple of requests for bread to arrive.  I think my water glass was filled once in the course of 2+ hours, and plates that we were no longer eating from were very slow to be removed (see below).\n\n- Food Prep.  The appetizers were fine.  We ordered the steak with bone marrow for two, and asked for it to be served medium (as we had done the year before).  It came out quite a bit rarer than medium, and that was after a long wait from the time we'd finished our appetizers.  The beef was well seasoned, but we couldn't eat the rarest pieces.  It took another 20 minutes before the dishes were cleared, despite the fact that we were right on the path to the kitchen.  I wound up stacking the plates myself, as the pooling blood from the rare meat was unpleasant to look at after a while.\n\nI realize it's a busier place than it used to be, and maybe that's just where Chapeau is in its lifecycle -- no longer a quiet, thoughtful restaurant and more of a fast-paced bistro.  I miss the former, and am not all that sure that the latter works for me.", "author": "Doug J."}

Turns out they had another location which was much better. Looks like they may have consolidated reviews for both shops. With the glut of amazing restaurants in SF there's really no reason to come back here. \n\nThe saving grace is the bartender. He was friendly, charming and helpful. \n\nWe ordered:\n- salad with duck: **. Was just like a banquet salad. There was absolutely nothing special. \n\n- oysters: *. While meaty the oysters had a terrible funky taste. Do NOT order them. Save your oyster orders for a different restaurant. \n\n- cassoulet: ***. Pretty good. The beans were a little underdone. The sausage has some grit to it. The duck was a bit bland. It's a generous portion though. \n\n-pork wrapped in bacon: **. Dry. You barely get the flavor of the bacon which totally misses the point. The gravy had a skin on it, although it had a good flavor. \n\nService: **. When we first walked in the host was snapping at someone on the phone. One of the waitresses was dragging her feet around, as if she were wearing flip flops. The sound was so annoying. No one looked happy except for the bartender.  \n\nThe crowd: More  mature.

She got the Trio of salmon which had lox, tartar, & roe.  It looked really pretty & she & my dad finished the plate in a flash.  For entree she had the Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin which looked still raw in the middle but I am sure the kitchen wouldn't let it out if it wasn't safe to eat.  Besides, it's been a few days and she isn't dying of cystercercosis.  The puree @ on the plate was really sweet & we think it might be banana.  Unfortunately this item is not on the menu online so I can't go back and verify our suspicion.  She finished off with Profiteroles which were nice but they were no match to the ones I had @ Delfina (read my review).  The chocolate sauce was quite sour & overwhelmed the flavor of the vanilla ice cream so it was just cold.\n\nI created my own 4 course dinner starting with the Traditional escargot de Bourgogne.  I haven't had escargots since I was 10 so this was a treat.  They were really meaty & super delicious.  I do wish they were still in their shells though.  Then came the fish tasting course which was a Seared scallop that evening.  My scallop was cooked nicely although the risotto was a bit salty.  I had the Striped bass & braised ox tail for entree & that was the most disappointing dish of the evening.  The filets were a bit fishy, there was this 1 tiny bite of ox tail hidden in the dish, & the sauce was strangely sour in a way that my palette is not accustomed to.  The best thing about the dish was the mashed potato which was really rich, creamy, & buttery good.  I ended with a French toast which I adored.  I am not sure what kind of bread was used but its density was able to soak up all the hazelnut sauce goodness.  The salted caramel ice cream was in sanely good.\n\nMy Daddy (can't call him a birthday boy & birthday man sounds weird) also created his 4 course dinner.  He started with the Porcini crusted veal sweetbread.  This was our first time have sweetbreads & we really liked how creamy they were.  He also had the Scallop tasting course that I did and he actually had sand in his scallop.  He had the Cassoulet de Toulouse for the main course which he found to be too salty (he has hypertension so he doesn't eat a lot of salt).  He really liked the Cannellini bean with the shredded lamb shoulder though.  He finished his meal with his favorite dessert, a Tahitienne vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It had a really nice crust on top, it wasn't too sweet, & it was creamy without being too rich.\n\nThe service was good except for the main waiter who gave off a \"I don't really want to be here serving you\" attitude.  The man who I assume to be the chef/owner shook our hands when we arrived & gave my mom & I kisses on the cheek when we were leaving...that led to some awkward but funny moments.  This was the first time I've been able to really treat my parents to a nice dinner so it was good to know that they liked it.", "author": "Karen S."}

Practically 4 out of the 6 dishes were bite size appetizers or deserts while the remaining two were medium size entres. (My favorite was the Oyster with Caviar and the roasted Quial. The filet minion was ok).\nThe taste was decent and although the place was a bit cramp, I love the way they set up the Valentines day vibe. The lights were dim, few candles, ballons and confetti that was the perfect balance. Nothing too tacky or lovey dovey, the set up was just right.\n\nI cannot emphasize how much thanks I have for the head chef. I remember as soon as me and my GF walked out of the restaurant, about half way down the block the head chef ran out towards us. At first I assumed that I had forgotten to sign the tab, however by surprise he just wanted to thank us and gave us both a hug. He expressed to us how much he enjoyed his job and he was very greatful to have us. \nHes been working there for over 10 years, so if you are curious to find out who the head chef is, just ask.", "author": "HonestOpino N."}

The owner was a delight; he greeted every person in the restaurant. \n\nMy husband and I ate every morsel on each of our plates because the tastes were too good to let a drop go to waste! Everything was perfect tasting, and came out in just the right amount of time. We each had the early bird special which included an appetizer/salad/soup, an entree, and a dessert. I had the tart with pear, blue cheese, and frisee salad- amazing! My entree was the flounder with a potato leek puree, and mushrooms- amazing! Our desserts were Tahitian vanilla creme brulee (OMG!), and a french toast with hazelnut ice cream. I am in a food coma! \n\nSO SO SO SO SO SO SO Lovely and wonderful !

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-04", "description": "Greetings!\n\nChapeau simply means hat, but adding the exclamation point and Chapeau! is a generic expression as a means of approval.  Kind of like the gesture of tipping your hat so it totally makes sense.  Now that I've enlightened you with such a useful piece of knowledge let me tell you a little bit about this restaurant.\n\nI was not very impressed with Chapeau!.  I had pretty high expectations, but apparently when we went it was undergoing some construction.  Hopefully it looks better regularly, but I can't imagine how it might look any different.  It seemed a bit overpriced for a location in Inner Richmond and I couldn't see why the restaurant warranted a 4.5 rating.\n\nWe got the Menu 1, which allowed us to get an appetizer, entree, and dessert item for a pretty good price at $38, but you had to pay a little extra for all the foods that you actually wanted to eat.  For the appetizers we got the Oysters and the Trio of Salmon.  But I don't know what they meant by trio of salmon because it looked and tasted pretty damn singular to me.  The smallest piece of salmon I've ever seen, but I'm a fatty so those are the things that frustrate me.  We got the Cassoulet de Toulouse and the Filet Mignon.  My lamb shoulder was pretty sub par and not very tasty and the Filet Mignon was delicious because it's Filet Mignon.  And I don't even want to write more, but the desserts were just decent.\n\nTo top it all off I think we sat next to the biggest bag of douche ever.  He was obviously drinking too much and he was just an insecure and lonely middle aged man who talked way too much.  So the food was decent and the experience would have been horrid, but our waiter was awesome.  I forgot his name, but he was a kind old Asian man who really made us feel appreciated and he had absolutely excellent customer service.  He was the best part of the restaurant and would only want to be served by him because he was that good.  That is all.  Never going back!\n\nthe Great,\nGumZ", "author": "David C."}

We felt welcome and for the most part taken care of.  I wish the tables weren't jammed so close together that you could easily be a part of your neighbor's conversation if you wished.\n\nOn the other hand, none of my dishes (I went for the three course menu) were really very good.  The trio of salmon appetizer was pretty bland.  My partner's salad tasted better, which is saying something because I love salmon. Our skate fish entrees were VERY salty, and my dessert apple tart was lacking flavor.  It's rare that I don't finish/enjoy a dessert, but the crust was dry and the apple on top was dried out as well.  The tiny scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was mostly melted upon arrival tasted good, and I wished there were more of that.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the owner bid us farewell at the door, which was a nice touch.\n\nFor a meal that ended up costing $65/person, I wish I would have at least enjoyed one of my courses.

I was looking for a place that's fancy but not too fancy - you know, so you can dress up a little for fun but not have to worry enough about if you're using the right fork on your course - and this fit the bill completely. Place is a bit crowded and loud when it fills up, but homey and friendly. The chef stopped by three times during our short visit! \n\nThey have \"set menus\" where you can choose three courses from their normal menu for a reduced price. We got that as its a great deal but it may have been a poor decision for a small eater because the portions are HUGE. We happened to get smaller, daintier dishes (goat cheese napoleon and veal sweetbreads for appetizer, filet mignon and rabbit for entree) but the couple next to us who got dishes with almost hilariously large portions stopped halfway through their entree in defeat. You're not going to get that \"wow that was delicious but I could use a burger\" feeling here - more \"oh god that was so good and now I'm going to food coma for ages in the glow of good French food bliss.\"\n\nFood was all delicious, and my favorite of the night was dessert of basil napoleon.

It wasn't so greasy the way that duck can be, and the polenta that came with it was a perfect complement. I had the poached halibut with fennel, and again, it was delicious. \n\nFor dessert, my husband got the nuage de noix (also by the recommendation of our waiter) and it did not disappoint.

We both had the prix fix dinner (the special one that had the fish tasting - $49 each) and left extremely satisfied.\n\nAppetizers:\nI got the trio of salmon. It looked like a small portion but was incredibly tasty and surprisingly filling. I think it was one of my favorite dishes of the night! It tastes really good with the bread, and I almost wish they gave me more of that potato chip that was used as decoration! My boyfriend got a rainbow trout dish and it came with a very tasty salad. We both really enjoyed our appetizers because of their quality and their quantity, so it was definitely a good start to our meal!\n\nTasting fish:\nThat night's tasting fish was a scallop (I know right?! A single scallop...and this made our prix fix an additional $9...) on a bed of pesto and creamy rice in a sea of lobster cream sauce. It was really good but I'm not sure if it was worth $9...a little overpriced for the quantity.\n\nEntrees:\nI got the cassoulet de toulouse because I love duck confit, and my boyfriend got the veal sweetbreads (I guess he was feeling particularly adventurous!). My cassoulet was really delicious and came in a huge portion, but at this point I could barely eat any of it because I had gotten 3/4 full from the previous 2 dishes and the bread! It came with shredded lamb and beans in kind of a stew and the duck confit. I think that it was a little salty for my taste but still overall delicious!\n\nDessert:\nI got the chocolate cake (DIVINE) and my boyfriend got the apple tart. The chocolate cake came with a banana flambe (and I love anything banana flavored!) that offset the bitterness of the dark chocolate. I really loved this cake :)\n\nHighly recommended for date night! Get your reservations in early, though, because I think my boyfriend tried to reserve dinner for the 2 of us almost 2 weeks in advance for a Friday night and he still couldn't get a table until 9pm!

Read on.\n\nThis is the first 'ritzy' French bistro I have been to in San Francisco, so pardon my novice review and seemingly immature taste bud and lack of food jargon.\nInstead of booking weeks or even months in advance, my friend was able to book a party for 4 the day before. Because it was a Saturday night, parking was absolute hell and we managed to arrive at the restaurant 20 minutes late. Not a problem, and the head chef Philippe personally sat us down after firm handshakes. He is a very jovial guy interested in his patrons. This was the first flag that this restaurant was not to be underestimated.\n\nI started off with a pinot noir, which was very sweet and reasonably priced at $4.50 for a half-glass. The meal I ordered was the 3-course meal for a fixed rate of $38.\n\nFood:\nAppetizer: Salade Landaise:Fris\u00e9e, Duck Confit & Smoked Duck Magret,Fingerling Potato Chips, Classic French Vinaigrette. The salad was OK, vinaigrette added a savory flavor. The chips at the side served as a nice complement to the salad, a softer and easier to chew version of the croutons found in a salad, yet still remaining crunchy. The cherry on top for this appetizer though, was the duck at the top. I love Peking duck, and I expected to chew right through this one but it instantly melted in my mouth causing instant palate gratification and sensory overload. This part alone made this appetizer worth it, eat it slowly. *\n\nEntree:\nCassoulet de Toulouse: In simpler English terms, the main course appeared to be breaded lamb swimming in a sea of canellini beans. Like the other meat in this restaurant, everything is so soft and my teeth literally cut through the lamb like butter. The beans were mixed in a sauce and made the meal filling. The garlic and toulouse sausage was OK, I've had juicier and softer sausage.\n\nDessert:\nWarm Valrhona Chocolate Cake: Very hot, crispy chocolate cake that started 'bleeding' liquid chocolate once I cut into it. In the middle I found caramelized banana sorta like a hidden gem, props for the aesthetics of the meal. To the side was the creamiest vanilla ice-cream I have ever eaten, which made a cool compliment to the hot fudge. I also sampled my friend's French Toast which she got at the waiter's suggestion, and I must say that they transformed the french toast like an art. The soft, spongy french toast was a full-circle end to the satisfying meal (and if i were to go back again, I would definitely get this instead.... maybe I have a grass is greener on the other side envy).\n\nAmbiance was a little crowded, as this is a small restaurant but service was definitely unprecedented, even for an upscale restaurant like this.

Service was up to par. the food was ALLLLL amazing. i tried the foie gras... omg. i can still taste it in my mouth. GOODNESS GRACIOUS. it was like heavan came down and got seared in a pan, and placed on my plate with slices of apples. hahaha. AHHH. i also got the petit poussin... goodness, chicken needs to be like that. ALL the time. hahaha. i murdered that plate. hahhaah. it was ALL gone. hehe. i didnt want to share at all...\n\nfinally...i went this weekend for my bday... lol. (yes, i guess its now a tradition) and this experience was the reason for the minus one star. Ok, maybe i am tripping, but was there a different chef? that guy did not look like Chef Phillipe... =.=', weird. lol. maybe he got a hair cut and grew out some facial hair.. but still.. ionooo. hahaha. but yes, so the menu that we oh so loved was well different. lol. i got the escargot, the salmon (even tho i wanted the petit poussin again, it wasnt available) and my bf got the sweetbread (which he really really really really really liked) LOL. he wanted to lick the plate. goodness. and he got the duck breast and duck leg... umm what. ok. so the escargot is very yummy, has plenty of flavors , and i dipped it in bread. the salmon was forgettable.. my bf said he didnt liek the fact that there were only a few peices of breast... and a leg. he wanted it to be all breast! (hahaha) and then they ran outta creme brulee. OMG. so sad. i was actually sad. like verge of tears. lol. hahaha. so i had to get the chocolate cake and by got the profilitures..(sp?) ... eh. they were ok. lol... sad facE. super sad face...\n\nso all in all..i will still return.. perhaps earlier so i can get my creme brulee.. and hopefully the Real Chef Phillipe will be there.. or um grow his hair back out. they do have an extensive wine list. and greattt service! i loveee the atmoshpere. lol.  i dont have to whisper. haha. actually its really loud in there. but yes. i still love this place!!! \n\n=]", "author": "Judy W."}

We visited the restaurant nearly every time we were in the city and it got better and better with each visit.  Until it changed hands, or merged, or whatever it did when it took on the new name-- Chapeau! \n\nWe first visited \"Chapeau\" shortly after it changed hands.  And we noticed just a hint of decline -- the sauces a little too salty --the stupid straw hat when we got our bill -- nothing major, still a great place.  But we visited this Thursday evening and I left our favorite little Bistro almost in tears.  \n\nI knew something was off the minute we sat down.  It was cold in the restaurant and the woman who seated us was dressed in a winter coat and barefoot wearing slides (these are basically flip flops with heels).  Where was the chef?  Where were the French waiters? Where was the pride and professionalism? There were no fresh flowers at the bar or anywhere, (save some pathetic nearly dead daisies  stuffed into a little 3 inch can you'd get from the Dollar Store on the tables)  and nothing on the walls. \n\nThen the appetizers arrived.  My salmon trio was pounded with a meat mallet and not in a good way.  The Roe served with it smelled and tasted fishy, as in not fresh.\nMy Husband's sweetbreads were chewy and gross (his words). \n\nEntrees were equally disappointing.  My Husband and I both ordered the lamb.  I've heard others say this is the best thing on the menu.  Oh my.  Maybe Thursday night is the real chef's night off-- but our lamb, while generous (too much so) in portion was dry and dare I say, PREsliced.  As in maybe made far ahead of time, sliced, and then warmed before serving -- completely devoid now of both juices and flavor.  I would have preferred half a portion of Clementine's lamb to the double portion of Chapeau's.  (NOTE TO OWNER:  you cannot make up for quality by increasing portions)\n\nBut the worst part, the part where I knew the affair was over, the potato gratin.  Formerly this was a square of carefully prepared wonderfulness - thinly sliced potatoes with just the right balance of Gruyere and cream -- oh the memories.  What we got was a sloppy ramekin of diced potatoes with cheddar melted on top -- a greasy pile of yuk that one might be served at Applebees.  \n\nI was frankly too upset to enjoy dessert.  But the \"Fixe\" was in, so what could we do?\n\nAgain, I got the feeling food was imported from somewhere else,  passed off as something they created.  The apple tart was barely warm and the bottom crust soggy. (A sure sign of thawing).   The Profiteroles also tasted thawed and I think  were doused with Hershey's syrup.  If it wasnt, it tasted like it.  So sad.\n\nI am accustomed to this type of \"pretender\" restaurant in my hometown.  Which is why I  look forward to a trip to the city for something better.   This will sound snobby, but as you can see by the many five stars Chapeau continues to receive, 95% of diners either cannot tell the difference, or don't really care (I don't know which is worse).\n\nSo they sold out. I get it.  Why do the work if practically no one notices? But It really hurt to see one that strove to be the very best, sink to the level of mediocre pretender.    \n\nChapeau has no !.  I predict a slow and steady decline until it becomes obvious to all this is no longer fine dining.", "author": "Denise M."}

The food was top notch, well prepared and unique combinations of flavors. My boyfriend and I did their 3 course menu. We were greeted by a friendly staff and given a small taster of pickled potatoes. I can't remember the appetizers, but I know they were good. I had their duck and it was perfectly seared and paired with this amazing sauce. My boyfriend got their pork with this apple sauce...traditional pairing but the way they did it was very interesting and delicious. The desserts were great, we had this pistachio one and their chocolate dessert. \n\nI knocked off one star because of the amount of trouble and disappointment my boyfriend felt having my surprise birthday dinner here. He noted it was my birthday in the original reservation, called the hostess to remind them, and reminded the hostess when we entered, but when the check came and nothing else, he was disappointed. He had to mention something to our waitress when she came for the check. She tried to prepare something, but it was nothing compared to what the table next to us received for their anniversary.

BAY AREA, SEASON 2: JACQUES PEPIN SPECIAL  (291)\n\nFebruary 13, 2010, Saturday, at 5:20 PM\n\nCupid must have been smiling on us this Valentine's eve.\n\nNot only we scored parking a block away at this parking nightmare neighborhood, we also snagged a table at Chapeau  without a dinner reservation before 6pm during this lovers' holiday!\n\nVENUE/AMBIANCE: Love was in the air at Chapeau--a teeny-tiny but cozy French Bistro.   The place was warm, festive (read: loud!)  and relaxed.  The tables were so closely placed together but I did not feel closed in. It was still possible to whisper \"sweet nothings\"  without being listened in by diners next to you.  I guess because the place was equally loud! Definitely not for quiet dining but I liked it this way tonight. Diners were getting more relaxed as they were enjoying their bottles of wines. (Some couples ordered 2 bottles each.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=OAc2e7WyaMSCGmY0el8EnA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=rGxHjwPLt1HnTYnkPdABFw\n\nSOCIAL SCENE: It was packed to the door and every seat was taken. Romeos of all ages wooing Juliets were at his restaurant tonight. \n\n It was nice to see old men and women dressed very nice for their dates as well as the teenager-looking young man right next to us who was obviously so uncomfortable in his suit but trying to impress his young date. (Young loves can be tragic but cute!)\n\nSERVICE: Our waiter spoke French, of course, which BF and I do not speak but he was not pretentious. Quite friendly and helpful with the menu.  Despite the tight space, the service was like a choreographed dance. Everything went smoothly during dinner. Attentive but not overbearing and we never felt hurried--just as how French dining should be.\n\nDRINK: Kir Royale for me. Nice and bubbly.\n\nAPPS:  Escargot in Garlic Sauce:  I ate a lot of snails when I was growing up in the Philippines cooked by my mom in coconut milk and squash. It's my fave! Snails are not exotic for me but they are for my BF and most Americans, I think.  We enjoyed our escargot and used our bread to clean out every last drop of the garlic sauce! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=untlhyUAbezHx3WsY8V3mA\n\nPALATE CLEANSER:  2 orders of Apple Sorbet with Calvados: Very fresh-tasting sorbet with a generous splash of apple liquor.

My gosh! I'm not a poultry person but this game hen dish was so juicy and had nice deep poultry flavors.  The sauce was slightly sweet with a hint of lavender.  Very nice! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=Vb4o2-ap9k5LaJNSnzkSvQ\n\nCHOCOLATE CAKE: (Warm Chocolate Cake\nBanana Flamb\u00e9e, Rum-Raisin Ice Cream, Caramel Sauce) Perfect way to end a delighful dinner.

We realized the quality of service and food had degraded since then our last visit 2 years ago.\n\nChef is running the floor full time now instead of in the kitchen as before. They really need a chef managing the kitchen as the food really didn't taste as good as before.\n\n\nAppetizer 1: \nPrince Edward Island Mussels:\nSteamed with White Wine, Shallot & Parsley,\nPommes Frites & Rouille. \n\nThe mussels themselves are good. The pool of white wine sauce was tooooo salty. The cropped herb was way too much and overpowered the taste of mussels. The combination caused the mussels too salty and grassy. \n\nThe fries and sauce that came with the mussels were great, but the presentation needed help. The fries were put in a paper & wire cone rack. Usually only big pieces of fries or fried food would use such a big cone rack. Tiny pieces of fries like theirs got lost in the cone. We had to \"fish\" them out.. and because the fries were so little, they began to fall out from the bottom of the cone. \n\n\nAppetizer 2: Trio of Salmon\nGravlax, Tartar & Caviar, Egg Mimosa, Fried Capers & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche,\nMicro Herbs with Lemon Dressing\n\nWith salmon and creme fraiche, it couldn't go too bad. The dish tasted decent and presented well.\n\n\nHowever with all the messiness caused by the fries and breads, the waiter didn't bother to clean that up... Crumbs all over the table while we waited for our entrees.\n\n\nEntree 1:\nPorcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads:\nKing Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms, Baby Carrots & Turnips,\nTruffle Sauce, Fried Leeks, White Truffle Oil. \n\nThe presentation looked decent; the smell of truffle oil was exciting. That fried leeks was NO GOOD. It was greasy and tasted greasy. It's not crispy; it's tough to work with. By the time you can swallow the other elements, you'd still need to continue to chew on it. \nSalty & greasy. The truffle sauce was on the heavy greasy side. It tasted like their almost poured back the oil they used to sear the sweetbreads onto the plate. The sweetbreads absorbed the grease and gave me that heavy greasiness to the stomach. I went to the vegetables, expecting the baby carrots and turnips would help lightening the grease. The baby carrots were OK, but the turnips were way too salty. After that, I need to go for water to chase down the salt and grease. I could only finish 2/3. Couldn't go any further.\n\n\nEntree 2:\nFilet Mignon,\nPommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms,\nSauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine\n\nSalty & greasy. Again, it tasted like the oil that they used to cook the meat were poured back onto the dish. It caused the meat tasting greasy. The grease was absorbed by the potatoes on the plate, causing the potatoes tasted greasy as well. The skill of cooking this steak should still be refined. The dish did not perform as well as a filet mignon dish should be. \n\n\nIf they look at our order, we didn't order much wine. Either if we ordered, the entrees were still waaaay to greasy for a normal dish. \n\nWith this meal, I think I drank at least 4 glasses of water to chase down that saltiness and greasiness.\n\n\nDessert 1:\nTrio of Sorbet\n\nIt was great. Can't go too wrong with sorbet.\n\n\nDessert 2:\nTahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\n\nI wish that creme brulee served either chilled or slightly warm. Room temperature of the creme brulee had a yogurt-y texture and didn't taste as good as expected... \n\n\n\nIf 2 years ago, I'd give it a 4-star... \nNow I say I'd only give maximum a 3-star.", "author": "Karen N."}

We ended up ordering different things and sharing it with one another. I got the Pre Fixe Menu 1 with the Trio of Salmon, Pork Tenderloin, and the Creme Brulee. Julia got the Pre Fixe Menu 2 with the Corn Soup with Crab Cakes, Seared Scallop with Pesto Risotto, the Baby Chicken Entree, and the Sorbet Trio. Kat got the Veal Sweet Breads and the Rack of Lamb. \n\nHonestly, everything we ordered was really good. Some of my favorites were: The Trio of Salmon, Scallop Risotto, the Veal Sweetbreads, the Creme Brulee. All three entrees were delicious and we ended up taking home left overs because we were so stuffed! \n\nI would definitely come back here! Overall, we each paid about $60 and although pricey, I think you get a good amount of food that's great in quality and taste for the amount of money that you pay.", "author": "Tien P."}

My boyfriend and I had dinner at Chapeau a few months back, and we have yet to have a meal as wonderful as the one prepared here (and that really says a lot since we just came back from Paris). \n\nOur experience was very pleasant from the moment we stepped into the restaurant. We were well cared for by the staff, and Chef Philippe was cordial enough to greet many of the patrons as soon as we were seated. We both ordered pre fixed menus and were highly impressed by each dish. The Trio of Salmon was amazing to say the least - such rich flavors and textures. I am still dreaming about it - what a masterpiece! \nFor the tasting fish, there was a scallop dish with risotto in lobster sauce, which was so fresh and decadent. By this point in the meal, we were so blown away that we honestly can't remember what entrees we ordered that night.

My boyfriend had the cassoulet toulouse, which was very flavorful --not too bland, not too salty. We had some good quality kir to accompany our meal, which wasn't too expensive at $7 a pop. For French cuisine, Chapeau offers a good deal. There prix fix meals include appetizer, entree and dessert for $40 and under. Usually, you would be paying $36-$40 per person just for an entree alone at other French restaurants.\n\nFor dessert, I had the french toast with soft caramel and hazelnut ice-cream. It was a supremely indulgent move that was worth every bite. I loved it! My boyfriend had the chocolate cake, and we now totally understand why it is a hit on yelp! Chef Phillippe was a genius to add the bit of banana in the cake. \n\nWarning: It gets very crowded on weekends so come early or make reservations!

It was a cauliflower bisque or something and it was amazing. Other than that nothing was memorable. I had a steak with foie gras and so did my date, neither of us were satisfied. My steak was NOT rare, as I had ordered it. (I opted to get the extra foie gras on top of the steak for an additional fee.) when I informed out server that my steak was over cooked she brought it back to the kitchen, she brought me a new steak with the foie gras from my previous steak scooped on top. I understand foie gras is expensive and they didn't want to give me another piece, but the least they could do was heat it instead of tossing it cold on top of a hot steak. I found that to be really odd, and of course, disappointing. \n\nThe decor was very cute, but it was overcrowded.

With a kiss from the chef who personally escorted us to the table I knew I was in for a good night.  \n\nThis place has been on my list of to try places for ages and I was super happy that I was able to snag a reservation even during Valentines Day weekend.  As I expected, the place was already bustling and crowded when we arrived for our 7:15 PM reservations.  Walking to our table I instantly fell in love with the ambiance.  Apparently it was newly remodeled and I loved the vibe they were going for - intimate and romantic.  I sat on the booth side and they had little pillows you can use to put behind your back for extra comfort.  Nice little touch that I appreciated.  And of course as expected tables were pretty close together but nothing out of the norm for a SF restaurant.\n\nIf you go here, you have to go for their prefix menu of $38 - most bang for your buck.  With this deal you get your choice of appetizer, entree and dessert.\n\nAMUSE-BOUCHE (compliments of the chef):  Cauliflower soup.  Not sure how the chef managed to get cauliflower to taste delicious but he did it.  Rich and creamy it left me wondering what was to come.\n\nAPPETIZER:  Seared scallop on a bed of basil pesto risotto with a lobster sauce reduction.  This dish was so good that I literally sat there with my eyes closed savoring every last bite of the dish.  It was their special so I knew I had to get it.  An extra $3 but well worth it.\n\nENTREE:  Bacon wrap pork tenderloin.  Enough said.  Anything that consists of bacon wrap anything is always good.\n\nDESSERT:  Chocolate cake.  Perfect ending to a perfect night.  Loved the warm chocolate cake that had more chocolate oozing out of the middle once you break the middle.\n\nFood here really is just amazing.  I still can't believe how affordable this place was considering we each got three plates.  I'm already recruiting friends to come with me and catch their early bird prefix menu which is even cheaper.\n\nRandom fact:  Chapeau in french means hat.

It was a nice personal touch that set Chapeau apart from the rest.\n\nThe food, overall, was memorable. I think Gary Danko makes better seafood and steakhouses make better steak, but there were some standout dishes. \n\nThe best dishes of the night, ranked from best to least, IMO: \n\n1. Seared Scallop over Pesto Risotto rested above a Lobster Bisque was heavenly. All the flavors melded so well together and the flavors were perfectly balanced. The scallop was seared to perfection. I would definitely come back just for this dish. \n\n2. Foie Gras Special - Delicious, perfect mix of sweet, salty, and fatttt. \n\n3. Porcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads - i learned from my roommate that this is a veal gland.. it was SURPRISINGLY delicious. You can tell it has more of an organ texture than meat. But the taste was so good, i forgot how weirded out i was originally. \n\n4. Prime Rib - Only comes in portions for two. My other two roommates shared and I tasted some. It was cooked to the perfect temperature, came with bone marrow and bread and tasted amazing. The meat was so tender and juicy. I am usually not a fan of Prime Rib (hence why i've never been to House of Prime Rib) but this was delicious. \n\n5. Traditional Escargots cooked in Butter, Parsley & Garlic presented inside what looks like an egg carton.. - way too salty \n\n6. Filet Mignon with potatoes and mushrooms. Not impressed and very mediocre.\n\nWe also had drinks and the selection was limited but good enough for the average patron unless you are a connoisseur of wine and alcohol.  \n\nOur meal lasted 3 hours and we didn't feel rushed at all.

I order something different every time I come here and am always overwhelmed by how great it is.\nWe always get the 3-course prix fixe which is $40 a person. Not bad at all for the quality of food and service here. If you are worried about getting small portions - don't be. I am always so full when I leave here - sometimes I even have to take some of my food to go.\nI've tried the skate wing, sea bass, scallop risotto, mussels, napoleon, cauliflower amuse-bouche, tiger prawns, escargot, salmon tartare, most of the desserts and more. Each of those were equally incredible, mouth watering, and had a WOW factor. Even their mashed potatoes and fries are godly. My top entree, appetizer & dessert would have to be the sea bass, goat cheese napoleon, and baked Alaska.\nThe staff might be even better than the food if that is possible.

We were not blown away as we were at Alexander's. We decided to opt for Menu 2 with the fish tasting for $38 per person. Ever since BH and I partook in foie gras, we've been craving it for every single meal afterward, so he, of course, got the foie gras appetizer while I decided to expand my tasting horizons and ordered the sweetbreads (pancreas from a veal).  \n\nI didn't think I was an organ person, but it turns out I LOVE foie gras and I really like sweetbreads too!  The sweetbreads weren't too bad tasting.  The texture was like fatty chicken and the flavor wasn't pancreas-y at all (not that I know what pancreas tastes like) but tasted like the sauce.\n\nBH's foie gras was just as I remembered it at Alexander's - rich, decadent, bursting with fat and extremely fragrant.  It melted on my tongue and it tasted exceptional with the baguette.\n\nThe fish tasting was scallop on a bed of creamy green risotto.  I inhaled this dish - the scallop was so tender and succulent and it paired perfectly with the earthiness of the risotto beneath.\n\nFor my entree, the black cod was a disappointment - the fish was lacking in both texture and flavor (the meat tasted really mushy).  BH's duck confit and leg of lamb was also good but not great.  Though, my friend's boyfriend's skate wing entree was exceptional.  It had a great, firm texture to the fish, but it was still soft and tender. The creamy sauce made the dish extra rich and tasty.\n\nHowever, the desserts redeemed the dinner.  The profiteroles were filled with lush vanilla bean ice cream and the pastry was airy and light.  The lemon tart was . . .well, tart and the crust was flaky and filled with sliced almonds.  Paired with a cup of warm, black French coffee and a delightful dessert, the meal ended perfectly.\n\nEspecially when the chef gave each of us a hug and pressed his cheeks to the ladies' for two soft air kisses.

But now, in all honesty after our dinner on Monday night, Chapeau has gone down the hill. This was my 3rd time visiting it since its move from the old location, and every time it has gotten worse so I feel like I should tell them how they're doing. \n\nThe food of Chapeau is not living up to of its past.  Although still good, it's no longer rich in flavor, the presentation is longer immaculate. For example its apple tart, the crust of the tart was hard and thick when I had it; I'm no professional pastry chef, but I know the crust should be fluffy, soft, and thin, but it was nothing like that. As for the all the other courses we had, the depth of the flavor was just not there, it's just not like what it used to be. \n\nBut its service, was perhaps what I was most disappointed in. It wasn't like they weren't nice to us, they were nice, but the waiter we had was simply not good at what he does. I asked him to recommend us good appetizers and all he did was reading off the menu. I wanted to know what was good that night, what was fresh, what was made well, and what was other people having. He was this french guy with a pretty heavy accent that clearly, was not understanding me well and he screwed up our orders twice; and ironically he tried to make it seem like it was us that was not clear. He was so ineloquent in everything he said which caused so much miscommunication. We always had to ask for more bread, refills on water; our plates were seldom changed, and our table was only cleaned once so we were practically eating with breadcrumbs all over it for most of the night!  \n\nI'm no nitpicker and purpose of this review is not to magnify some insignificant details of Chapeau and turn them into a huge deal. All I'm saying is this: if Chapeau considers itself amongst the elite, and wishes to stay that way, then it MUST turn its attention back to detail. Or else what's separating it and say.. house of prime rib?", "author": "Wes Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-09", "description": "Before having my first experience w/ French Cuisine 2 years ago at Chapeau, I would have avoided French restaurants b/c I was under the impression the food was too rich, stuffy ambiance, and overly expensive. However, Chapeau demystifies all these myths.  \n\n2 years later, I find myself back at Chapeau, this time at their new location; at the old Clementine.\n\nCame here last Thursday w/ reservations and it was PACKED! It seemed like a Saturday night. Although we were late for our reservations, we were promptly seated. \n\nAs we walked to our table, we were warmly greeted by the Executive Chef/Owner. Nice way to begin a good meal!\n\nFOOD:\n*Amuse Bouche of Cauliflower Soup: This was a perfect start to our meal esp when it was very cold out that night. The soup was creamy and smooth. Cauliflower can be very bland, but the soup was well seasoned to bring out the natural flavor of the cauliflower. \n\n*Trio of Salmon: Gravlax, Tartar & Caviar, Fried Capers & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche/Micro Herbs with Lemon Dressing: MmMm! Essentially, it was fresh salmon tartar wrapped in smoked salmon and surrounded by salmon roe. The combination of flavors was amazing--Salmon roe: saltiness and zing, gravlax: smokiness, cr\u00e8me fraiche: creaminess, and tempura bits: crunch. Talk about flavor and texture explosions in your mouth.  \n\n*Bacon wrapped Veal Lion with Truffled Soft Polenta and Spinach: The veal was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. Although we didn't see much bacon (perhaps it fell off), it did it's job by seasoning the veal just enough to bring out it's meaty flavor. The veal was very tender; the texture was pretty similar to what I would expect from a filet mignon but softer. I normally cringe when I hear of polenta, but my GAWD...the truffled polenta was TO DIE FOR. It was creamy, smooth, and rich. My how truffles can do wonders for a dish.\n\n*French Toast w/ Caramel Sauce and Hazelnut Vanilla Ice Cream: I'm normally not a dessert person, but I always like to order desserts when going out to a nice restaurant to see how well-rounded the place is. And, in this case the dessert is the reason why I didn't give Chapeau 5 Stars. It was toasted white bread (didn't taste the egg mixture) soaking in caramel sauce and topped w/ hazelnut vanilla ice cream. I was disappointed... the bread quickly got soggy from sitting in the caramel sauce and the ice cream. The caramel sauce was not what I expected it to be; it was very watery and milky. And, the ice cream had a very faint hazelnut taste. \n\nSERVICE: Impeccable. Our waiter who was the same waiter I has 2 years ago was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. He recommended a great California Pinot to go with our meal which was perfect. It wasn't too dry or too strong which complemented the meat well. Although we stayed there for over 3 hours and they were closing, they never rushed us.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: I actually prefer Chapeau's new location on Clement and 2nd. Upon entering in, there is a new bar area. And, the dining room is larger and the tables aren't so close together; MORE elbow room! It's very simple with hardwood floors, tan tables and chairs and crisp white table clothes. Because the place is always packed, it may be a little difficult to easily hold a conversation.\n\nCROWD: Older crowd with a handful of people in their 20s on dates. \n\nPRICES: I think Chapeau's prices are quite fair for French food. Both times, I did the menu 1 for $38 (which hasn't changed) and includes the app, entr\u00e9e, and dessert. If you opt for the foie gras, it's an additional $6, the veal or filet, an additional $6. \n\nI plan to come back very, very soon for the Prime Rib for 2 served carved table side with Bone Marrow!!! *DROOL*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

For a relatively affordable $40, create your own. You get to choose the app, entree and dessert from the regular menu. It's a win-win! I got the tomato soup (perfect on a cold blustery day), pan seared duck with polenta for my entree, and the apple tart for dessert. My sister got the duck confit salad, baby chicken entree and warm chocolate cake. My mom got the filet mignon, which she wanted medium rare, and it came out PERFECTLY cooked. They also threw in an extra dessert. I have no idea what it was, but it had some peaches and toasted nut topping. Divine. I'd say out of everything, my least favorite dish was my duck. For some reason the pan sear wasn't really there... so instead of a crispy skin it was fatty and soft. But the flavors were still tres magnifique!\n\nAmuse bouche was THE BEST! Creamy savory cauliflower soup with a dash of truffle oil. (Doesn't truffle oil make everything better?!?) And when I raved to the chef about it, he proceeded to, in detail, explain how to make it and wrote down his recipe (After he confirmed I wasn't a chef trying to steal his secrets LOL)\n\nWatch out for the bread. It comes out warm and perfectly crispy flaky crust with warm chewy center. If you're not careful, you'll ruin dinner b/c you can't stop eating it! \n\nCan't wait to go back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-01", "description": "A lovely restaurant, off the beaten path.  The chef and waiters obviously have a lot of pride in what they do. And if you're lucky enough to have Pascal as your waiter, then you'll have an enjoyable exploration of French cuisine, with perfectly timed explanations, yet unobtrusive table service - exactly what a waiter should be. The ambiance is cosy, and unpretentious, lacking art on the walls, for instance.  You may notice Chapeau! is just slightly dated (think 1989, but subtle), but it perfectly illustrates this establishment's gestalt, as being focused on the utmost in cuisine and service, with everything else subservient to that.  As you walk in, you smell the aroma of butter and truffles.\n\nThe wine selection is extensive and accommodating, with a laundry list of bottles from California and France, about 15 selections of 1/2 bottles (including a $40 Chatauxneuf-du-Pape), and 20 varieties of glasses.\n\nThe menu can be overwhelming simply because of the endless options.  The point is to be accommodating.  You can choose from tasting menus that include full portions of 3 or 4 plates, or smaller portions of many plates of the chef's choosing.  However, you can still order single, full-size items, by just picking appetizers and entrees.  \n\nThe amuse bouche was a cup of asparagus cream soup, heavy in salt, but very aromatic and tasty.  I had the trio of salmon as appetizer. It was a very fatty, soft raw salmon, plated with some salmon eggs, crumbled hard boiled eggs and a light dressing of creme fraiche. It was divine.\n\nNext came the entre-act of a single scallop on a bed of green risotto in a brown creamy sauce. Not sure of the ingredients, but it was filling and tasty, though a little heavy on salt.\n\nAnd now I'm tired of writing in so much detail.  Basically, you get the idea... It's great!  :)", "author": "Tina L."}

My friends raved about it and highly recommended I take my BF there for our anniversary this Sunday. \n\nRight when we walked in we were greeted by the Chef with a warm smile and firm hand shake. He was also there to goodbye when we were leaving. Very sweet but here is why I don't believe Chapeau! deserves more than 2 stars:\n\nThe amuse bouche was a tomato gazpacho? Too salty to just drink on its own. I actually started dipping my bread in it. \n\nThe Fish Taste that came with Menu 2 was one seared scallop over risotto with lobster sauce: The scallop was cooked well but the green risotto it sat on was very undercooked. The crunchy uncooked bits of risotto killed the dish for my BF and I. I understand that we were one of the first tables they served for the dinner but if you didn't have time to cook the risotto all the way through... just don't serve it?! My BF couldn't stand the undercooked risotto so all he ate was the scallop.\n\nBoth the BF and I went w the 4 course option (Menu 2):\nI ordered:\nSalmon Trio: Bland in my opinion but it tasted fresh\n\nFilet mignon: I ordered medium rare and it came out perfect. The sauce and potatoes it came with were great, no complaints but nothing to write home about. I wasn't WOW'd or anything. Pretty standard, I guess.\n\nCheese plate: I ordered this for desert and the sliced apples it came with were mushy... like old apples. The grapes were mushy as well.. like they had been sitting in the fridge for a while. The cheeses were tasty but the bread it came with was not appetizing at all. The bread was cold and rubbery. I actually asked if they could bring me a couple slices of the bread they served with butter when we first sat down. There was an extra charge for ordering this because I was doing the 4 course dinner. Not worth it. \n\nThe BF ordered:\nMussels: Cooked perfectly but kinda small. The liquid it was cooked in was rather bland but the fries it came with were delicious. \n \nFilet Mignon: He ordered it Medium but it came out just as rare as mine. He thought the meat was decent and sauce was great but not amazing.\n\nCreme Brulee: Smooth and creamy but not overly sweet. Average.\n\nOverall, Chapeau! wasn't BAD but it really wasn't worth the $175 bill. The tables are way too close together. I was about a foot from the next couple and could everything they were talking about. I understand they want to make more money by having more tables but it was just uncomfortable and noisy.

Also the chef personally comes out going from table to table, shaking every patron's hand and welcoming them to the restaurant.    \n\nAs for the food...absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection!  Seared foie gras is a must try.  It's $18 a la carte or an extra $6 to the pre-fixed menu.  Totally worth it.

On arrival the hostess was very accomodating and we were seated almost immediately.  As I sat down the vibe was relaxed. Ambiance was traditional French with the light wall colors to the dim lighting. Definitely a romantic atmosphere. \n\nStarted my night off with a Woodford Reserve (Bourbon Whiskey) Sour, bread, and butter. My drink was strong and the sour mix consisted of fresh lime and lemon juice with a fresh lime as my garnish. Bread was \"fresh out the oven\" hot. Moist and fluffy with crispy crust. Delicious to say the least. Chapeau has an extensive wine list that will satisfy almost anyone's pallet with various red and whites to choose from.\n\nOnce at Chapeau you have dining options. A prix fixed menu which you would create your own 3 or 4 course menu including choice of appetizer, choice of entree, and choice of dessert, while the 4 course menu includes the \"Tasting Fish of the day\". The Chef's menu from Chef/Owner Philippe Gardelle, or the Vegetarian menu. \n\nWhile opting for the 4 course menu the appetizer I began with was the Creamy Roasted Chestnut Soup (Duck Fat Croutons with Parsley & Garlic, Creme Fraiche, White Truffle Oil). Very good. Nice texture, not too heavy. Tasting Fish Of The Day was the Scallop Risotto in Lobster Sauce. Impressive and delightful. Nice sear on the edges of the scallops were fantastic and made the dish that more memorable. Risotto was prepared and seasoned perfectly. Entree was Cassoulet de Toulouse which consisted of (Canellini Beans, Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder, Duck Leg Confit, and garlic & Toulouse Sausage) prepared almost like a casserole. Fulfilling, tasty, and unique. Authentic French dish. I didn't think the night could get any better then I was introduced to the Basil Napoleon for dessert. (Maui Pineapple, Manila Mango, Banana, Kiwi & Strawberries) cut up into very small bite size pieces served with Champagne-Citrus Pastry Cream, on a Feuille de Bric. Felt like an explosion of fresh fruit and flavor in my mouth. While the Feuille De Bric was a great compliment when eaten together.\n\nChapeau has set the bar high for French restaurants in San Francisco. To think they have only been around since 1996 is incredible for I thought Chapeau has been around for 30+ years. Chapeau will be around for many years to come. My overall experience at Chapeau was outstanding. From beginning to end the hostess, attentive wait staff, informative and well trained Francais serveurs, to the occasional visit from Chef Phillipe Gardelle to ensure all of our dining needs have been met, Chapeau is truly a fine dining French Bistro. \n\nP.S.- With rougly 20-25 tables reservations are encouraged.

I knew I had to go.\n\nWe made reservations about 2 weeks in advance and got the exact day/time that we wanted. I think making a reservation a week earlier should be sufficient but we went in around the holidays so they were pretty booked up for a Saturday. Also, they told us that they had an $18 corkage fee. That's a pretty good deal considering you can take in your  favorite bottle of wine and save some bucks, which we did.\n\nWe both went for the prixi fixe dinner options.The BF got the filet mignon w/ foie gras and I got the seared striped bass.

Friendly attentive service, each dish beautifully served and expertly prepared, a good wine list to compliment all the food even by the glass and totally reasonable prices make this place a winner in all respects. Fixed three courses of your choice for  $ 40.50-. We have been to many other well rated places  and either paid a lot more for less or have been disappointed.\nOften French food is too rich with butters and cream which you feel coursing thru you all night, this was not the case here.\nFirst the cauliflower soup welcome sip gets you into full anticipation mode, then the duck salad and the salmon trio with a glass of sparkling, both  equally tasty  and unique lets you know  you are not in Kansas anymore.

Finished off with the BA and very good apple tart ( my wife is an expert tart maker, hers is honestly better) but no one would be disappointed with this. The baked alaska was amazing decadence in a snowy package. Click those heels and remind your self ,\" there's no place like home\", Dorothy.\nI'd recommend this place to anyone who has not had a great French food experience or who just appreciates well made food and great service. They seem to prefer 2 seating times during the week, 6 or 8, in order to turn the tables twice which makes sense. No lunch service is offered, and I would definitely reserve  ahead on weekends. It's not quite as intimate as some other larger places, can be on the loud side too, but it is a very relaxed atmosphere making the food that much more surprising.", "author": "Aaron Z."}

Sadly, it was not. I think we fell for the hype and expected too much. We wanted to be blown away and we kinda were but for totally the wrong reasons. \n\nWe were seated right away since we had reservations. Our server gave us menus and took our drink order. He gave us the specials and came back with water and bread. We looked over the menu and made our decisions but had to wait a bit for our server to come by. While we were waiting, another couple was seated next to us. Since the tables are so close together, we actually became friendly with them. \n\nWe both ordered the prix fixe menu 1. \nI had:\n- Salade Landaise: Fris\u00e9e, Duck Confit & Smoked Duck Magret, Fingerling Potato Chips, Classic French Vinaigrette\n- Wild Caught Skate Wing in a Brown Butter, Fingerling Potato, Sauce Grenobloise, Mache\n- Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake, Banana Flamb\u00e9e & Rum-Raisin Ice Cream,\nCaramel Sauce \n\nThe hubby had:\n- the special foie gras\n- Cassoulet de Toulouse: Canellini Beans, Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder,\nDuck Leg Confit, Garlic & Toulouse Sausage \n- French Toast, Soft Caramel, Hazelnut Ice Cream \n\nThe server brought a complimentary roasted cauliflower soup which came in a demi tasse. Really good and was great with the warm bread and butter. \n\nThe chef came out to make his rounds and greeted everyone. Nice touch I thought. \n\nOur appetizers arrived and we really enjoyed them. I loved my salad and wished there were more duck in it. The hubby liked his foie gras too.\n\nOur neighbors got mussels and raved about them. \n\nThen we waited a REALLY long time for our entrees to come. Our neighbors got their entrees before we did. We were all a little shocked since we had arrived at least 30 minutes before them. \n\nOur server was no where to be found. \n\nWe not only were hungry since a lot of time had gone by since our appetizers but we just wanted to see how much longer it was going to be. Our neighbors were almost done with their food when we finally got a hold of our server who just came by and said \"I'll go check on your entrees\" and walked off. \n\nWe were actually thinking of leaving but decided against it since it was our anniversary. If we were anywhere else on any other day, we would have just asked for the check for the apps and been out. \n\nCouple of minutes went by and he came back to say \"They are working on them\" and walked off. Then we waited some more. By this time our neighbors were done with their entrees. I was not happy. \n\nWe finally got our entrees and even though I was hungry, my skate wing was just ok. My hubby did not like his dish at all. We thought the food would be amazing and it was just ok. It was very disappointing after waiting that long. \n\nOur neighbors and we started talking and we didn't like that our server was so nonchalant about our wait. A simple \"I'm sorry for the wait\" or any information or some sort of apology would have been nice. Even when he dropped off the entrees, he didn't say a word. If you're in a nice establishment, you expect a certain level of service and we just didn't get it. \n\nOur entrees were cleared and while we were waiting for dessert, the chef came by. I guess he heard about our wait and our conversation because  he apologized for it. He acknowledged that it's not only the food but the service that makes for a memorable dining experience. I really appreciated the apology and wish the server would have done something as well. If it was a mistake in the kitchen like the chef indicated, the server could have said so. \n\nWhen we got our desserts, he included an extra one which was; Nuage de Noix Roasted Pistachios, Almonds & Hazelnuts in a Frozen Chantilly & Italian Meringue. I had a candle on my cake too to celebrate our anniversary. It was a nice touch but maybe a little too late. \n\nBy that time we had been there for over 2 hours. We just wanted to finish eating and go home. \n\nWe just thought it was over hyped and maybe our experience wasn't the norm but it was enough for us to think about not going back which is sad because I should have tried the mussels.", "author": "Margo G."}

I was not disappointed.\n\nWent on a hot date, we got gussied up and were the best-dressed in the crowd, which itself was a mix of young and older, locals and tourists (I assume, as they were armed with cameras and ugly sweaters), Frenchies and not. Pretty good.\n\nAmbiance- low light (not too low, flattering), white tablecloths, close tables. Don't personally like the hat paintings on the walls, but hey. I would have liked a little more warmth or a little more elbow room, but overall not a bad vibe.\n\nService was great. The owner/executive chef did a couple of fly-bys, which is nice. It has been said, correctly, that all the waitstaff is not French. I guess this would have been nice, but the woman who served us was sweet, funny, and really did a good job.\n\nI hear that the early bird menu is the best option for your money, but I can't bring myself to eat before 7pm, so that was out. \n\nI especially recommend:\n\nEscargots- Classic, tasty, frankly difficult to mess up, but some places manage to so it's good to know Chapeau! does the little buggers right. Not too heavy on the butter, which is probably better, as I would have preferred a crustier bread for dipping, but that's just me.\n\nOysters- I love oysters. These ones were served the French way, with a little mignonette of red wine vinegar with scallions and a couple of lemon wedges. Nice quality oysters, super satisfying.\n\n(We chose a bottle of their Sancerre with all this, and it was the right choice. Crisp and well-rounded, and I am not usually a white wine gal.)\n\nBouillabaisse- Wonderful. Less soupy than I am used to. Big pieces of fish and a few mussels and clams, very good \"rouille\" (a French fish soup classic flavorful mayonnaise-y sauce that goes great with crouton toast and shredded emmental). Definite success.\n\nBonus points for having Eau de Vie. A little Mirabelle to help with my digestion always hits the spot. If I remember correctly, they also had pear and kirsch.\n\n\nIt is pricey here, but not out of control unless you do what we did (basically order off menu and have drinks). Our last couple of drinks cost us 38 bucks, which must have been a mistake, so be careful.", "author": "Lucie D."}

The dinner started with a complementary thimble cup of cauliflower soup that was delish!  My first course was a crab avocado appetizer that was very tasty and nicely presented.  Next, I had the scallop with risotto, which was disappointing because it was gritty and somewhat tasteless.  When I explained the grit to the waiter, he immediately went and told the chef, who explained that at certain times of the year, he doesn't like to wash scallops too heavily because they'll loose their flavor.  I appreciated the attention our server gave the matter, though I think not serving the dish would be a better decision on the chef's part.  It was very gritty and the flavor didn't measure up to either the soup or crab.\n\nFor the main course, I had the duck, which was fine but not exceptional (solid B).  I actually thought it was overcooked and a bit dry, but that was significantly offset by the flavors and side it came with.  Also, presentation was appealing.\n\nI had the French toast w/caramel for dessert.  Truly decadent, without being sickening.\n\nOur server recommended the 2009 La Roubinir \"La Grange des Briguieres\", which he did a great job describing and I thought it was a good deal at $42/bottle.\n\nService was excellent.  The portions were the right size (small by American standards), so I was totally satisfied but didn't feel like a stuffed goose.  The ambiance was lively, even at our \"late lunch\" hour of dining (5:00 p.m. -- an no, my hair isn't blue -- this was a late lunch for me, with no dinner that evening).

However, the bench tables were a bit cramped together. \n\nService: \n\nWe had an excellent waiter, complete with a french accent! The waitstaff was very attentive and they catered to all of our (limited) needs. But I am sure if we were needy, there would be no problems at all! We did, however have to move to another table because a bigger party came in suddenly, but the hostess was very apologetic and the rest of the night went without a hitch. \n\nWe had the opportunity to meet and speak with the chef, who was extremely gracious, and he sent out a few tasty extras to us at no charge! It was awesome seeing him interact with customers, sharing wine and etc. \n\nFood (The Important stuff!): \n\nI LOVE French food, so I had high expectations. We both opted for the 3 course Prix Fixe. We started with couple of appetizers, the seared Foie Gras and Veal Sweetbreads. Both were delicious! The best Foie Gras I have had so far in the city. The same went for the sweetbreads. Very savory food! We were given a 3rd appetizer, the salmon chilled stuffed salmon. Honestly, it was good, but nothing spectacular. \n\nFor our entrees, she had the Filet Mignon and I had Sea Bass. The entrees were great, but we both agreed the appetizers more or less made the experience.\n\nFor our desserts, we shared the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake and Nuage de Noix, both of which were excellent! And again, the Chef surprised us with the equally excellent Profiteroles!\n\nOverall: \n\nIt was definitely an excellent dinner, and we will definitely come back. It is not pretentious, and a very relaxed setting for a romantic dinner! I highly recommend coming here.

It's kinda in a residential area of the Richmond district between 2nd and 3rd.  It took about a 20-25 min cab ride out of downtown SF to actually get to this place, but it was well worth it.  We dined here a few days after Christmas... \n\nWe got there for an early reservation right when they opened up for dinner service.  The ambiance is upscale, but casual...clientele was very eclectic, from young & old couples to families.  Some were dressed in jackets while others wore jeans and t-shirts.    \n\nService was charming, friendly and prompt.  All of the waiters had French accents and appeared to be speaking French to one another.  Our waiter gave us his honest opinions of what he personally thought tasted the best that evening.  Food service pace can best be described as European, so this may not be your cup of tea if you're in a rush to get in and out of this place.  We enjoyed the leisurely pace, and never felt rushed although the restaurant was packed to the gills.   \n\nStarted off with the appetizer-sized portion of Porcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms/ Baby Carrots & Turnips/Truffle Sauce/ Fried Leeks/ White Truffle Oil, and my wife had a salad of some sorts with mixed beets.  Light crisp coating surrounding moist and flavorful sweetbreads...\n\nEntree:  Vegetable Napoleon made of Barley & Wheat/ Lentils with Dried Fruits & Toasted Almonds/Curry Cauliflower Mousse/ Artichoke Dome/ Green Curry Sauce.  My wife is a vegetarian and loved this dish...such an usual and creative dish with such artistic presentation that we've never seen before.   \n\nEntree:  Veal Medalion with Chanterelles in a Veal Reduction\nTruffled Soft Polenta/ Spinach Soubise.  Perfectly cooked veal with an outstanding polenta that was chock full of chanterelles in a super-rich veal reduction...what more can you ask for? \n\nDessert:  Tahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  I thought this was just 'okay,' but it probably wasn't the best dessert to top off such a rich dinner. \n\nUnfortunately, they dimmed the lights right before our food was served so none of my cell phone photos came out, but take my word for it, everything except dessert was super-delicious!  The portions were unusually large for French cuisine and the sauces were just spectacular...and they did not skimp on the use of butter.  This food is not for the weight-watchers crowd...but what the hell? Ya gotta live a little sometimes...\n\nThe only downfall, if you need to grab a cab back to downtown SF...make sure you call for a cab from the restaurant.  It took us about 15-20 minutes to hail a cab on the street.  No worries though, Chapeau was definitely worth taking a trip off the beaten path...Great dining experience.", "author": "D C."}

My water glass was kept filled throughout dinner and empty plates never lingered long on the table\n\nAnd the food, oh my goodness it was so good!

The combination of savory and sweet made for a great dish.  For the finale, I order profiteroles.  Although I had to enlist my dinner mate to help finish my entree, I ate ALL of the dessert.  The fried pastry + ice cream + chocolate combination was to die for.\n\nAs a final note, they offer a great wine list where you can order 3 oz or 6 oz pours in addition to full and half bottles.

I ordered the French Onion Soup as an appetizer, and it was absolutely perfect...flavorful, super cheesy, great texture and piping hot. They provided some tasty warm bread and butter before my entree came. The also served me an anchovy puff pastry, compliments of the chef, which was excellent. \n\nFor my entree, I got the mussels with frites, which were also delicious. Although between that, the bread, the pastry puff, and the soup, I had way too too much food in front of me and wasn't able to finish my frites or have room for dessert. \n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars from me is they don't seem to have any commitment to using organic ingredients, which is important to me (especially in my meat consumption, which is why I didn't go for the Filet Mignon instead of the mussels).\n\nNote: Reservations are strongly advised for this place since it's quite popular.", "author": "Melissa M."}

Love.\n\n+ The bread came out toasted and warm so that my butter was a waterfall upon soft lands of carb. We were also provided with complementary cauliflower soups with a drizzle of truffle oil that was delightful. \n\n+  Appetizers: If you're going for healthy, the Mesclun Salad has these delcious fresh grapes that are very complementary to the dish. It comes with 2 slices of their own walnut bread. OH and the fried cheese was amazing! The trio of salmon was light and fresh. I had the tomato soup, which was very comforting for a rainy day.\n\n+ Entrees: Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin cooked to medium rare. The apple- calvados sauce complemented the pork perfectly. Who doesn't like a hint of bacon on their food? I was happy to see it didn't overpower the pork. The gratin dauphinois and spinach was interesting because it was on the sweeter side. \n\n+ Apparently the Skate Wing is a fish. It came with a brown butter sauce and fingerling potatoes, which tasted like a refined....french fry. The skate was great though, if slightly on the salty side. \n\n++ Dessert: my friends, please please get the Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e!!!! I also tried the profiteroles (like an ice cream sandwich) and the Nuage de Noix but the creme brulee is the BEST.\n\nEverything was wonderful, but my experience was slightly tainted by the waitress who refilled our water and gave us the wrong cups.

But as a warning although its a French restaurant their portions are anything but European. The portions for appetizers, dinner, and dessert are somewhat large, I barely caused a dent in my pate appetizer and dessert.\n\nI won't go into details about each and every dish but please please believe me when I say when I was walking out of the place I was already regretting I couldn't finish all of my food, it was beyond divine. The dishes are nothing like you've tasted before, the chef really does an incredible job. We were all smiling and so happy leaving the place, not just from the food but from the service as well.\n\nI went with a fairly large group (my family was visiting from out of town), we had lots of questions about the menu and we stayed for hours talking and drinking, but the restaurant wasn't the type to rush us out.  In fact they were more than accommodating and very warm! That made us feel so comfortable and let us have one of those longs meals that we'll remember for some time :)\n\nThe *only* tiniiii tineee issue I have is with the decor. It is very simple and boring. Plus some areas needed some paint and maybe something to block the view to the kitchen wouldn't hurt?  But maybe boring is the point? To instead focus on the scrumptious food is perhaps what their objective is :)\n\nOther than that it is very romantic restaurant and I think a perfect place for a date.\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Sunny D."}

I asked in advance for a great table, and the manager set us up in a wonderful back corner booth where we could sit next to each other.  \n\nWe started off with 1/2 bottle of French white wine to go along with our 1st and 2nd courses - the escargots and seared scallop.  I then opted for the grilled rack of lamb (the special of the day).  It was the best I've ever had.  I enjoyed a glass of French bordeaux with the rack, which was a perfect pairing.\n\nOddly enough, the couple next to us, who seemed to order everything on the menu, left a terrible tip for our outstanding server.  The guy was really arrogant and told the guy that the tip reflected the food which wasn't 'up to my standards', and that he 'gave the chef a chance to come out and apologize and he didn't, so we're leaving'.  He was such a loser, and it's a shame that he didn't appreciate the outstanding food and service that Chapeau! has to offer - my girlfriend and I personally think he saw how much his check was and was too cheap to give an adequate tip.  \n\nDespite the sideshow at the end, this was a truly incredible experience.

I was expecting to LOVE this place, so when I didn't like my meal very much, I left disappointed. \n\nI came for Dine About Town in January with a friend and ordered:\n\nAppetizer: \n* The Trio of Salmon - Gravlax, Tartar and Salmon Caviar with Egg Mimosa, Creme Fraiche, Caviar, and Capers. I usually love anything with Lox in it, but I found this dish OK. My friend, on the other hand, seemed to really like it.\n* Pesto Escargot. My first time trying escargot and I thought it was pretty good! It didn't taste like much other than the pesto, but the pesto was delicious!\n\nEntree:\n* The Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin served on spinach, mashed potatoes, and pear jus. I really liked the Bacon and Loin part of this dish, but I did NOT like the pear jus. It made the dish too sweet to the point of being a bit sickening for me. My friend had the same reaction, although he wasn't quite as repelled by the sweetness as I was.\n\nDessert:\n* The Profiteroles with Dark Chocolate and Ice Cream. By far the best dish of the night, in my opinion. My friend thought the dark chocolate was too dark and overwhelming, but I loved it.\n\nAs for the atmosphere - It's quite cramped. Beware that you have to concentrate hard to avoid snooping on the conversations around you. However, the chef went around to every table and personally greeted every person there. He even stayed and chatted with a few tables for awhile. It was a nice and unusual touch that I appreciated.\n\nNote to everyone who wants to avoid lice: The bill is served in a cowboy hat (since Chapeau means hat), and 1 or 2 people from every single table in that restaurant put the hat on their head.

Their wine list is good, but wish there is more by-the-glass selection.\n\nThe service was great.

Little ordinary, but nice touch on the microgreen on top of the salmon to make a light crunch.\n\nTasting of Fish with Scallop--The pesto risotto is so inspiring! I want to make some now. The scallop was well cooked, but just wish it's a little more crisp on the outside. \n\nAlaskan Halibut with Mussel Sauce--The sauce was delish! The halibut was cooked perfectly! It's buttery soft (emphasize on buttery soft!) and the pieces just slides off with a touch of the fork. It also very well seasoned. I love it when my fish is not overly salted! \n\nValrhona Chocolate Cake w/ Rum Raisin Ice cream--rich crusty outter and soft gooey melty center. It was definitely a very rich dessert.

The Early Bird Prix Fixe came with an appetizer, entree and dessert for $29.50. \n\nAmuse Bouche. Salmon Tartare Crostini. This was nommy, I liked the addition of the chives and garlic. So delish. \n\nBread and Butter. Their bread was delish, but I wish they'd warmed up the butter to room temperature at least. Super difficult to spread and I was starving!\n\nEscargots de Bourgogne. In Butter, Parsley and Garlic. This was alright, not particularly memorable aside from the fact that it was overly salty. I've definitely had better elsewhere.\n\nSalmon Roulade. Stuffed with Scallops and Petrale Sole, Duelle of Mushroom and Spinach Mousse, Basil Coulis and Pommes Gaufrettes. My friend ordered this but I had a taste of it. Not particularly memorable either, reminded me of a sandwich wrap but with overly salty seafood instead. The spinach and chips were yummy, but how could you go wrong with those?\n\nPrince Edward Island Mussels. Steamed with White Wine, Shallot and Parsley, served with a side of Pommes Frites and Rouille. The toasted garlic bread was nommy. So were the mussels, aside from one that tasted like it had died in its shell (ew). But aside from that one exception, these were pretty good, fresh and tasty. But as far as mussels go, this definitely wasn't anything spectacular or out of the ordinary, since I've had similar at other French restaurants in the city.\n\nPommes Frites Side. These fries were pretty damn good. I wasn't a major fan of the sauce just because of how thick and fatty it was, but I did have some and it was nommy too. Well fried fries indeed. \n\nBacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin. With Parsnip Puree, Braised Swisschard, and Apple-Calvados Sauce. Cooked to Medium. My friend ordered this but I had a taste. The pork was nice and tender. But both my friend and I were not fans of the puree. I couldn't even tell it was parsnip, I actually thought it was something similar to polenta but not. It didn't taste like polenta because it was more green but it had the texture of it. \n\nFrench Toast. With Soft Caramel and Hazelnut Ice Cream. This was yummy, lucky for Chapeau they ended my meal well. It was a little on the watery side, but fortunately for me since I like my french toast on the soft side. It was just the right amount of sweetness and I loved the french toast with the ice cream together. So delish!!\n\nNuage de Noix. With Roasted Pistachios, Almonds and Hazelnuts with a Frozen Chantilly and Italian Meringue in an Orange Soup. My friend ordered this. I loved the orange soup and the Italian meringue, it was super creamy. But I didn't like the nut \"cookie,\" I thought it was too thick to go with such a light dessert. It maybe have worked better if it was reversed on the bottom as a crust rather than a topping because as a topping it was definitely too thick and coarse. \n\nOverall, the food was just okay and their service left something to be desired so I still don't understand why my friends rave about it. Service was really lacking for our table and it was obvious because our server was definitely more attentive to his other tables. And the restaurant wasn't super busy, it was not even half full. I'm guessing it was because my friend and I were the youngest people in the room, but even then that's not an excuse for poor service. If a not-so-great tip is what you're asking for, a not-so-great tip is what you'll get!\n\nWould have given them 3 stars for okay food, but -1 star for bad service.\n\nGave them a second chance and I think I'm done giving them chances.", "author": "Constance C."}

Nice, simple decor with paintings of hats adorning the walls to compliment its namesake. The seating is a little cramped so a crowded night might claustrophobic and we came on a Monday evening so my guess is this place is often crowded. I guess it can be considered cozy but you're close enough to the table next to hear the entirety of conversations so be forewarned if you're looking intimacy be prepared to train your focus or pop an adderall to achieve desired tunnel vision. I even saw some cross table mingling so maybe you'll make some fine dining friends.\n\nFor the first course I ordered the escargot with pesto which was quite good. The pesto balanced the escargot's natural saltiness nicely. My girlfriend enjoyed the Trio of Salmon (gravlax, tartar and salmon caviar with egg mimosa, creme fraiche) garnished with caviar and capers, which was delectable. The caviar married the salmon with a salty refreshing flavor.\n\nFor the main course we both had the bacon wrapped pork-lion that sat on a bed of spinach, mash potatoes, and pear jus. The pork was well prepared albeit a little chewy. The sweetness of pear jus will delicious at the onset became a tad overwhelming as the meal progressed. But the potatoes and spinach were quite tasty.\n\nFor desert we sampled the profiteroles topped with dark chocolate which was good but not suited to my tastes. I thought the overabundance of dark chocolate overwhelmed the profiteroles and ice cream but I'm not huge a dark chocolate fan--to each their own. \n\nMy favorite part of this restaurant was the chef personally greeted everyone and made sure they enjoyed their meals. He is clearly doing what he loves and takes pride in his work. Overall the staff was very friendly and the service was fairly prompt.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-19", "description": "DH and I came to Chapeau! for our anniversary after several wonderful experiences  early in our courtship in the previous location. As it had been a few years, this was the first time we had dined in their new location, previously Clementine (which we had also dined at and enjoyed before). Despite having a reservation, there was a bit of a wait while the hostess scurried around and finally located \"our\" table (keep in mind this was clearly reserved as an anniversary, e.g. special occasion). The table was something that had been set, diagonally, between the bar area and the corridor to the kitchen - obviously an attempt to pack in one more 2-top as it had to be moved in and out for one person to be seated (and knocking into the patron in the next-door diagonally-placed table as well). \n\nThe place was packed and the waitstaff kept brushing against us as they made their way to/from the bar and the kitchen. Not their fault...but there should never have been a table placed in the aisle location. My conjecture is that the owner greedily wanted to increase the number of tables to make up what he lost on the prix-fixe dinner (it was restaurant week, unbeknownst to us. We actually had no intention of ordering the restaurant week or prix fixe menu but wanted to re-create our earlier romantic dinners at the old Chapeau! from our earlier dates).\n\nAfter waiting some time for a waiter, and being hit one too many times by the staff, we asked to be reseated to a different location and mentioned that it was our anniversary and we had enjoyed Chapeau! several times earlier. The waiter was apologetic, noted that the dining room was full but assured us that a table against the opposite wall would be vacating soon and he would place us there as soon as he could. In the meantime, he asked, would we care for a glass of champagne? We were pleased with the response, accepted the champagne with thanks and waited to be relocated to the new table.\n\nFinally, we were reseated to a better location and enjoyed a very nice a la carte meal with our old favorites. Service was somewhat slow, however, simply because of the number of patrons in the dining room (perhaps additional help would have improved that...or the kitchen was too small to accommodate all the orders? What do I know - I am only a patron and cannot guess at what goes on in the back of the house). But from a diner's experience, there were too many missteps, culminating in the fact that, when the check arrived, we were charged for the glasses of champagne that had been offered for our inconvenience. Because it was so hard to flag down any service person for anything during the meal (refills on water and coffee - ordering another bottle of wine) DH just paid the bill, told me to stop eating and we left.\n\nIronically, the owner/chef has so much time that he can greet patrons as they arrive, check on them in the dining room and double-kiss them all on the way out. Perhaps his time would be better spent expediting in the kitchen and rearranging his dining room and menu to focus on quality and not quantity. Very disappointing but certainly an anniversary dinner we will remember.", "author": "Jetlagged S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-08", "description": "My first impression of the place was not that great, the hostess wasn't the most welcoming and we had to wait 20mins extra for a table even though we had reservations. It's a small place so they don't have a waiting area. They do have a bar that we could have waited at but they kept saying oh it's almost ready, 5 mins so we just waited in the front. UMMM you said 5mins...5mins ago?! \nOnce we got seated, everything got better. Service was slow but at least our waiter was really friendly. The chef also came to the table a couple of times and shook our hand and served our dishes, I thought this was a very nice gesture. The place is small and can get pretty loud not uber romantic.  \n\nMe n the bf got Menu 1 (appetizer, entree, dessert for $38) \nFor, appetizer we got corn soup with crab cake which was very rich but smooth and light at the same time. I got the special foie gras which was a few bucks extra on top of the menu price. I LOVE FAT so I ordered the Foie gras which was so unctuous the sweetness of the apple helped break the \"fatty-ness\" but dare it say it... too fatty and greasy for me (note: I LOVE FAT so it was a shock to me)\nFor the entrees, the bf got honey-lavender baby chicken, he wasn't wowed by the dish and neither was I. He stated it was just average and didn't really have any memorable qualities to it, I agreed after having a few bites.I got the filet mignon with oyster mushrooms which was yummy rich with truffle essence, can't go too wrong with a good piece of meat.\nFor the desserts, we got french toast with caramel/hazelnut ice cream so simple but sooo good, the ice cream and french toast definitely was nostalgic.  The boyfriend got the chocolate cake with flambe banana and a rum raisin ice cream, really really rich in chocolate. I prefered the french toast. And a complimentary chocolate nut mousse with orange soup, very interesting it reminded me of the chocolate round orange candy, we weren't too fond of this dessert it didn't mix well to us. \n\nThe food was a toss up for us, some things we loved some was just ehh.The service was also a toss up, at first it was ehh then it was good.\nI plan to come here again for hopefully a better experience.", "author": "Julie B."}

I was feeling some NYE in Paris nostalgia, so we found this highly reviewed French restaurant as a treat for my birthday. The only memorable parts of this meal (and no, not because I had too much to drink before dinner :P), is the fois gras (or as my honey likes to say it, \"foy grass\"). Yes yes, you must have this delectable duck liver, note that it's not on the menu (no need to panic!), they will announce it as one of the specials. Oh, and any of the desserts (the French know their desserts).  \n\nThe chef came out to say hello and later to say good bye - that sort stuff is nice. \n\nThat said, everything else we ate was not as impressive, just okay and in my opinion \"skippable\" - i.e. good, cute place for appetizers and desserts.", "author": "Tutram N."}

We had a relatively late reservation (9pm) and I was super excited. They were packed when we arrived and had no table for us until a whole hour later!! This is WITH reservation. The only redeeming factor is that the boy at the door was shy and somewhat apologetic. Still, they seated a couple who had a later reservation before us because they looked older and had ordered a bottle at the bar. \n\nThe food was decent. I like the option for prix fixed menus. The tasting fish of the day was scallop: very worth while. The french onion soup was relatively unoriginal but good tasting. The trio of salmon was more of a duo of salmon, unless you really count salmon roe. The description was better than the food. The complimentary veggie soup was probably better than any of the dishes. \n\nFor entree, we had the daily special (foie gras) with bone marrow. They had forgotten our bone marrow!! When we reminded them, they obnoxiously said \"o you have to order it.\" We nicely informed them that WE DID ORDER IT. When they FINALLY brought it out, it was obviously microwaved and still cold in parts. At least they took it off the check. \n\nThe place was quite crowded as well, which is typical of french bistros. If you're looking for privacy this isn't the place. But if you love a good convo with a neighbor, Chapeau! definitely offers. \n\nI was very disappointed in this place after all the great reviews and given my love for french bistros. Will not be back and will not recommend this place.", "author": "Yue Z."}

Chapeau! was our immediate choice, no hesitation, no plan B. If the food were the only good part, it would be well worth every dime. But it's not just the food.\n\nOur last visit to Chapeu! did not disappoint. Both the seared foie gras and the Meclun salad were excellent, neither better than the other, which is quite astonishing, when you pit a salad against the best foie gras I've had outside France. For the main course, we had Steak Tartare and a rabbit's leg, both which were pleasant surprises in their own way. The Steak Tartare was seasoned in an original way that added just an extra bite to it. However, if I have a chance to return to SF any time soon, I'll order the rabbit, which was meaty and moist, not stringy and disappointing.\n\nIt's the chef and owner, Philippe Gardelle, who really makes this place exceptional. He's always coming out of the kitchen to greet guests, which is more than just a pro forma \"How are you?\" The second time we visited, he remembered us from the first time, a feat of memory I would not have been able to make. He's a detail man, making sure that every moving and non-moving part of the restaurant is working as it should. And he has such a friendly, relaxed way of doing everything, he makes it look far easier than I know it is.\n\nI'll miss this restaurant.", "author": "Tom G."}

It was a Tuesday night and the place was still buzzing, even at 8:30 pm.  \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the foie gras and the salade landaise.  The foie gras was a generous size and served with thinly sliced pear.  It was rich and buttery.  The salade landaise was very tasty served with a piece of foie gras and deep fried fingerling potatoes.  The dressing was nice and light and the smoked duck had a lot of flavor.  \n\nFor entrees, we ordered the bouillabaisse and the filet.  The bouillabaisse reminded me of a cioppino.  It was like a seafood stew with fish, clams, and mussels.  I think this dish lacked a little flavor compared to all the other dishes.  The filet was cooked perfectly.\n\nFor dessert, we had the basil napoleon and the French toast.  The basil napoleon was definitely interesting and good.  I've never tasted anything like it.  It was like chips and salsa where the salsa consisted of various fruits.  The slice of French toast was served warm with hazelnut ice cream and a caramel sauce.  Yum!\n\nOverall, the food was exceptional and the atmosphere was cozy.  The only downside was that the tables were very close to each other.", "author": "Laina T."}

Luckily I called in and told them we were going to be late, and they said that's fine just come by 6:15. My boyfriend dropped me off, and the host said \"Sorry, the chef told me that we can't serve you because you were supposed to come at 6:13\". \n\nMy heart dropped...but then he smiled and said \"just kidding! I'll show you to your table.\" *Phew. \n\nAnyways, the ambience is very nice, but you don't have to dress formally. It's a dim lit place, so it's hard to take pictures on your phone that doesn't have flash. :( We ordered the pre fixed meal, with the tasting fish. \n\nThey brought out bread and soup first, then we had the trio of salmon. It was delicious! I loved it, especially the caviar. Probably my favorite dish.  Then we had the tasting fish, which was scallop risotto. Scallop was nicely cooked, risotto was a good texture. The entree was Alaskan halibut for my boyfriend, and mine was Filet Mignon. I would say my dish was good, except the potatoes were a bit too salty. Then we had the Baked Alaska for dessert. It was so pretty! The chef also put candles in it because it was our anniversary. :') How sweet.\n\nThe chef is very friendly too, and he greets you when you come in as well as when you leave.

Unfortunately, neither experience has left much to be desired.\n\nThe 'pluses':\nThe food!!! Really REALLY delicious French food. Perfectly seared fois gras, lovely escargot...all my favorites and decadent specials. We ordered from the prix fix menu and it was a good deal. Nothing extraordinary, but much better than we've had at other places in the city.\n\nThe 'minuses': \n-Reservation was made, we sat at our table 40 minutes later\n-To add insult to injury, we were asked to sit at the bar, where the bartender ignored us and faithfully refilled bread baskets while we were trying to catch her attention. Can we at least have a drink while we wait and wait and wait? I nearly snapped (literally) at her to get our Champagne.\n-Too close to neighbors, what is the point of cramming so many tables in?? I couldn't get to my seat without waiting for staff to clear the aisle. I recommend to lose a couple tables so there is more space and the staff can do their jobs. \n-The service seemed disorganized and we had to ask for everything. Bread, wine, etc..just took away from the meal.\n\nOverall I'm giving an average of two stars, the food was a solid 4, the service was a 1.5 I would recommend sitting at the bar, not taking this meal too serious, and expect an amateur/new bistro with excellent food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-04", "description": "First walking into this place it was very pretty and a whole lot smaller than I thought it would be.  The tables are pushed together quite close so any hopes of a private conversation is out of the question.\n\nThe place gets very very packed so near the end of my meal I did begin feeling a bit claustrophobic.  Our server spoke French fluently and was quite nice.  He was very patient with us and with taking our order.  We each ordered the 2nd menu choice with the pallet cleansers.  The cauliflower cream soup came first, and it was actually ok.  This is coming from someone that HATES HATES HATES cauliflower.  Next the mussels and the salad landaise.  Both were really great, but I preferred the  mussels over the salad.  The mussels also came with a side of fries, which were probably one of the best tasting fries I've ever had.\n\nNext we had our 'tasting fish' which was a seared scallop.  YUM!  It was cooked PERFECTLY and was absolutely delicious.  Our pallet cleansers came next and wow.  I had the green apple cleanser and it came in a martini glass partly filled with tequila.  It really complimented my cleanser very very well.  My bff got the ginger-lemon cleanser and his came with vodka.  They were both delicious.\n\nOur entrees came next which were salmon and rack of lamb.  I'm not really a fan of lamb, so it me it was ok.  But he LOVED the lamb and ate the entire plate before I was half way through mine.  The salmon was cooked perfectly (also they ask you how you want your salmon cooked, I had mine done medium rare).  The potatoes that came with the salmon were cooked perfectly.\n\nAfter we finished up our entree, we were given our dessert menus, and from there we waited.  The free bread basket kept us busy for a little bit, but after it was taken away we just waited for someone to take our dessert order.  This was probably the only down-part of the meal, but it sucks having to wait 5+ minutes just staring at everyone that walks by.  It seemed as though there were only 1-2 waiters for all the tables that night ... and mind-you it was a Saturday night.\n\nFinally after waiting close to 10 minutes our waiter returned to take our dessert order.  I ordered the profiterolles which reminded me of a cream puff in a sense.  Two sides of a pastry with ice cream in the center and a chocolate sauce on top.  It was AMAZING!!!  I would love to come back here to have it once more.  The bff ordered the chocolate cake, which was great as well.  It was very warm so you can tell that it was fresh, and the plate was decorated so beautifully.\n\nAlso I had they're house champagne while the bff had a Heineken.  The house champagne was great and much much better then the house champagnes at other places.\n\nThey only have 1 bathroom ladies, so be prepared to wait and wait.  Also the bathroom does not reflect on the restaurants decor at all.  Quite sad really ... I felt like it was really dirty and was scared to touch anything.  And I have been to places with some really nice bathrooms, so I was kinda sad to see that not every aspect of their restaurant was anything else of great.\n\nOur meal ended up to be close to $200 with tip.  So it is not cheap.  The place did move as of August 4th, 2009; and can now be found at 126 Clement Street -- and will be open 7 days a week.  When we were leaving, around 9pm or so, the line was out the door ... so we were very lucky to have reservations (and an early one at that, 6:15pm).\n\nI do hope that this place is a bit more roomy and that they have more than 1-2 servers on a weekend dinner shift. \n\nThis place has truly changed my mind about French cuisine.  It was very very decedent, flavorful, and rich ... which is probably why the portions of each dish are so small.  You get a bunch of different tastes in your mouth with each dish and it was an amazing experience.  I do hope I get to return and visit their new location.", "author": "Pia V."}

I think I had a mini panic attack as I quickly scanned the menu and DID NOT see any foie gras. Thankfully the server came to my rescue and promptly presented the seared foie gras as one of the specials of the night. Whew.\n\nWe wanted to try a good range of dishes without going overboard, so we strategically decided who would order the 3 course prix fixe menu ($40) with seared foie gras as the appetizer, and who would order the 4 course prix fixe menu ($49) with the \"tasting fish\" or \"fish of the night.\" Of couse, most of the dishes required extra $ to be tacked onto the $40 price. But hey, if you wanna eat good, gotta pay for it sometimes. Otherwise, the choices you'd be left with would be like the proscuitto wrapped pork tenderloin, which is delicious in its own right I'm sure.

The half-shell oysters (6) were petite but even my friend, who doesn't eat raw fish and rarely eats seafood, said they were really good and flavorful. \n\nEvery plate, although small, was cooked beautifully in an understated way. I've already made up my mind that this is probably my favorite French restaurant in the city (hence 5 stars), because they certainly make the BEST seared foie gras and bone marrow I've had - yes even better than La Folie or Jardiniere or even Isa! \n\nThe server tempted me to come back all 4 days before the ban \"just to have foie gras and nothing else.\" I love my waistline more though so it really hurt me to cancel my reservation for Chapeau! that I had for the next night...", "author": "Liana L."}

Sadly when asked what my entree would be my response was shut down with - \"We Are Out Of Zee Skatwing\"...I almost felt a tear trickle down, knowing that I would not get to savor any type of brown butter sauce for dinner was just upsetting to this birthday girl!\n\n I opted with the Salmon dish, along with creamy corn soup(with a crab cake), and for dessert the nuage de noix. The appetizer was superb! I never cared for creamy corn soup until this visit to Chapeau! It was beyond delish, and had a melt-in-your-mouth buttery crab cake in the center. I suppose they only add one due to 'not trying to overwhelm the dish'...yet I feel and next time WILL DEMAND MORE of those deliciously crispy on the outside, BUTTA on the inside crabby cakes, made just the way I like them.  ; )..\n\nOnto the Entree:\n\nMy salmon was cooked to perfection. (Again big ups to the chef for knowing how to cook thefish dishes with perfection! Which makes me crave theskatewing even more!! RRRrrr..(must do it for marketing purposes!..like oh sorry were out of that, followed by a chuckle, sneer, and exit of appearance..knowing damn well I'm about to enjoy the following dish, and will return to try that damn skatewing!!...(sigh)...Anyways..other than the fish, everything else on my plate was pretty forgettable. I believe it was some sort of bed with bits of greens, and seasonal fruits..still so-so to me. \n\nThe dessert was a nice sweet cleanser. The flavors were light and the dish was amazingly yummy and complex. I loved it! No candle by choice, but was for sure a great ending to my birthday meal.\n\nAll in all, it was a pretty great experience. My date and I got seated within 5 minutes and the place was packed (mind you it was a Wednesday), so I was happy about the prompt seating. The food was great although the entree wasn't my top choice. I believe I will be venturing back to inner Richmond to visit Chapeau again, if not for the dish I wanted, for drinks for sure!", "author": "Honey B."}

I love the small room atmosphere... and it' so classy for the chef to make rounds greeting guests.  Our server was very nice and patient with our ignorance of French food.  We'll definitely come back when we can afford it!  Spent about $220 with tip for the 4 course and a glass of wine each.  Well worth it.

The food is so unbelievably pleasuring - rich and texture perfect. The escargot was tasty, seasoned well and not chewy. The tasting fish was quite possibly the best course of the 4-course meal. The filet mignon with shiitake mushrooms was so flavorful and tender...the mushrooms and sauce went with it perfectly. \n\nThe service in terms of people working there is great! We entered the front door and were immediately greeted by the owner who ended up kissing us on both cheeks when we left. At one point, a guest was looking for the bathroom and accidentally started walking into the kitchen. The owner caught her, had a big laugh, then turned her right back around and gave her a tour of the kitchen! We had a very nice asian waiter who was hilarious. The table behind us was there for some sort of theme party. They were wearing brightly colored wigs and the waiter who was slightly balding kept cracking jokes about stealing the wig of the only guy at the table who actually wasn't wearing a wig, but just had long dark hair. \n\nQuick tips:\n* Definitely make a reservation for Saturday or Friday night. Call ahead any other time of the week to make sure you get an actual table and not the bar.\n* Come hungry. Both times we were so stuffed from the appetizers and entrees (1st time I did the 4-course prix fix, 2nd time I did the 3-course) that we had to take the chocolate volcano dessert to go.

We did the 3 course meal - my husband ordered the escargot, filet mignon medium, and the baked Alaskan dessert; I ordered the Salmon Trio, Sauteed black cod with oxtail, and the Nuage de Noix dessert.

I was thrilled to finally get a reservation (one week ahead of time) from this highly praised and talked about french restaurant, but was only disappointed to the slow service and decent food. For a three person party and  one week reservation, we were seated in a cramped two person table. And though the food was better than average, it didn't meet the 5 star rating.\n\nI ordered the:\n\nSalade Landaise: 2 stars. The salad and dressing were yummy together but the duck was prepared too salty. \n\nFilet Mignon with bone marrow: 4 stars. The meat was medium rare, tender, and warm except the outer pieces which was cooked past medium and was slightly burnt and crispy.  The sauce, potatoes, and mushrooms complimented well though. The bone marrow was too oily.\n\nBacon wrapped pork tenderloin: 3 stars. Tender and cooked perfectly, but didn't have any distinctive taste to it. It was okay.\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse: 3 stars. It looked like a gumbo stew with a variety of meat thrown in together. It was definitely filling but it didn't look very appetizing. Neither was the taste. \n\nChocolate cake: 2 stars. Worse cake I ever had. It had a bit of bitterness to it and I didn't like the rum raisin ice cream. Vanilla would have been a better choice.\n\nFrench toast: 4 stars. This was the best dish of the night. Although it is literally just toast, the sauce and ice cream complimented it very well. \n\nCreme Brulee: 3 stars. Did not have much taste. It was meh. \n\nOur server was kind and professional but slow in refilling bread and picking up dishes off our table. We were seated at 7:15 and did not leave until 9:00. Maybe that's just the pace of these wine and dine restaurants.\n\nI hate to compare, but I'm going to stick with Isa with a quicker pace and much better food.", "author": "Denise W."}

It's pretty tiny but they were able to accommodate our party of 9. Our dinner went very smoothly and service was great.\n\nWhat's also great about this place is the customizable prix fixe menu! Everything on the menu can be included in the prix fixe with additional add-ons for more expensive items. We all went with the 3-item prix fixe which is a steal for the quality of the food. They started us off with a cauliflower truffle soup which was delicious and a great lead in to an amazing meal. I ordered the trio of salmon, bay scallops and hazelnut french toast. The trio of salmon was amazing! It was really light and tasty with great texture from the waffle chips they put on top. I'm normally not a huge fan of capers but they complimented this dish very well and I didn't mind them at all. The scallops were also delicious! Huge scallops that were cooked perfectly and the risotto and the lobster bisque were a nice balance to it all. If you're a fan of scallops or risotto, you should definitely order this. Last but not least, I had the hazelnut french toast which was....SO GOOD!!! I could eat this for days...my mouth is watering just thinking about it. It wasn't too sweet and the toast was sitting in a pool of hazelnut goodness. Yummmmmm!! \n\nWe all shared a couple bottles of the Le Cigare Volant which was great. This obviously wasn't included in the prix fixe but $38 for all that? It's seriously a great deal.\n\nCan't wait to go back and try all their other stuff!", "author": "Bobbie W."}

The options are a bit more limited - 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, 4 desserts - but if it's your first time, that's more than enough to choose from. \n\nI split appetizers with my cousin so I got to have both the escargot (classic, scrumptious) and the corn chowder with crab cake and truffle oil. The corn chowder was mind-blowingly good. I rarely say that so believe me! I thought the crab cake was mediocre and unnecessary, as the soup shone on its own. \n\nThe bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with Asian pears and maple glaze was also delicious. One of the pieces was quite pink which worried me, but I went in for the kill and it was completely delightful! Win. \n\nHad to get the profiteroles because it was the only dessert with chocolate.

We eat out a lot and my husband will normally write positive reviews and save negatives for our own conversation.  However, I feel that the inconsistencies we experienced at this restaurant needed to be shared because of the type of restaurant and  the prices being charged.\n\nHere is our experience for Mother's Day: (take it with a grain of salt since it is one of the busiest days of the year)\n\nWe walked into Chapeau right in front of another party of 4 (there were 3 in our party) and we all barely fit into their tight curtained off entry. (it was like being piled onto the 38 Geary bus)...  We shuffled into the restaurant to give the other party some room and just stood there in view of the entire restaurant while we waited to be seated.\n\nThe hostess/manager/waitress (she played all 3 during our stay in her tight white jeans and flip flops) showed us to a table that was obviously just an extra stuffed into the others to accommodate the Mother's Day crowd (we watched at least one other party refuse to be seated there until it was finally just removed).  It looked right onto their reservation/billing computer, back room, chipped wall paint,  and several discarded and unused ice buckets.  I indicated that the table wouldn't be suitable (it was mother's day and I wanted mom to feel special) so we were moved to an equally \"stuffed in\" table right in the pathway of the kitchen/bar that we moved back a bit so that I would not be pummeled and bruised with each passing waiter on their way to serve other diners.  At least this table over looked some of the restaurant... or was that a good thing?  Not necessarily...  (the walls were dirty with chipped paint everywhere and absolutely no art work or any kind of decor to be seen) As we were seated (our butts not quite in the chairs) we were immediately asked... \"something to drink\" to which we had to ask for a minute to consult the menu.  After being seated and moving the table, we were promptly told in a very stern voice that we could not move it because the other diners would not have enough room.. We had to compromise by moving the table just a tad so that their wait staff had enough room. (my small purse had been knocked off my chair twice during this process while waiters passed) This earned us an audible groan and eye roll from the hostess/manager/waitress.  I know she was upset  because it then took another half an hour and my husband's request to get someone back to take that original drink order.  During this time, we considered whether or not we should stay, and since it was Mother's Day, stuck it out and we were glad we did... The food was amazing and the service did get better.\n\nWe had the mussels and sweet breads and both were sublime.  My husband had the pork tenderloin that was obviously brined because it was so tender the juices just ran with each cut... just lovely with the slight bitterness of the kale and creamy parsnip puree.  My Mother-in-Law had the Skate, which had a butter/mustard sauce that went perfect with the green/fingerling potato salad.  I had the Cassoulet de Toulouse that was cooked to perfection.  Everything was moist and the beans still had a bit of firmness and no mush... very filling and good for at least one more meal.  For dessert we shared the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake with the rum raisin ice cream..We wanted to lick the plate.\n\nI would say that if you can ignore the less than charming ambience you may expect for $30.00 French entrees, it is worth it for the food.  If you are looking to impress a date, I would say go for something else that offers the whole package with both the staff and the restaurant dressed appropriately and ready to serve with a smile.", "author": "Rachel B."}

This is important if you know what kind of food you will be having and what wine will go well with it.\n\nAppetizer: The escagots were creatively done without the shells and on a rosemary skew, beautiful and very delicious! The different styles of salmon gave you layers of surprises.\n\nMain course: The duck breast was so tender but also very rich that you would rediscover the taste of duck.

Now I don't want to accuse this place because I did eat out during lunch time too, but I'm just not exactly sure what caused this.  \n\nWould I recommend this?  I don't know.

Cruising through Inner Richmond then stumbled upon this neighborhood gem.\n\nFirst Impression: Awkward entrance!

Removed from it's shell and skewed on a rosemary stem over a bed of thinly sliced roasted potatoes, topped with a very creamy butter sauce. \n\nTrio of Salmon: Salmon tartar wrapped with Gravlax salmon, creme fraiche, capers and eggs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-21", "description": "Wonderful food, yet poor waiter/server service is what we got during our first visit (4 stars for food, 2 1/2 to 3 for service.) I was really excited to eat here for our 1 year wedding anniversary, yet the poor service made the experience more frustrating than anything. Ultimately this poor service overshadowed the great food, so much so that I don't think I would ever return to eat here.\n\nThe appetizers we ordered were delicious, Goat Cheese Napoleon, and Escargot (A tasty pesto and just the right amount of butter made this some of the best Escargot I've ever had.) Our entrees were equally as good (Mussels with a glorious white whine sauce and a Scallop dish with thick perfectly cooked scallops in a bed of delicious pesto Risotto with a lobster sauce.) The desert my wife ordered was amazing, basically a piece of perfectly cooked French Toast with gourmet drizzle of cinnamon and other flavors, but my what I would call \"chocolate lava cake\" was just \"ok\" and brought back memories of a Dominos pizza lava cake. \n\nNow let's talk about the service. The service from all employees was excellent and friendly from the moment we entered. Unfortunately the service from the server was not. Now let me preface my statements below about the poor service with some info about the fact that I am in no way one of those patrons that believes we should have a red carpet for our entry, be given constant attention every moment of the meal, and deserve endless groveling/praise/thanks for our patronage. All I ask for from a restaurant is decent service( friendly, attentive, appreciative/I'm glad you're eating here service.), and if the check is in the triple digits that's something I should without a doubt get. Now I was aware that the restaurant was very packed and the server was clearly busy, as well as possibly the only server there, but his basically rude/apathetic service was unacceptable. First we had merely an apathetic quick \"hello\" when being greeted by the server, a stark contrast from the \"Hello, how are you, enjoy your meal.\" from the hostess. His \"hello\" reminded me of something I'd get from some fast food joint teenager. Then we had to wait for far longer than we should have just to order drinks. When ordering our drinks the server gave a rude, almost mocking response when my wife ordered a glass of wine that was not available by the glass. Once our drinks were ordered we literally sat through the entire meal without being asked for another glass of wine/drink. We also waited what seemed like forever to order desert, to get our check and to return the check when we were ready to pay (I had to signal the server just to return the check, and was about to walk it over to him when he finally saw me signally for his attention.) Lastly once paying our check we didn't even get a decent thank you, or some friendly acknowledgement that out patronage was in any way appreciated. \n\nSo in conclusion I would recommend going here unless you are willing to forgive the frustrating garbage service, for the great food. For me such service always makes enjoying my food a very difficult task, therefore I just avoid returning to such restaurants, regardless of the food quality.", "author": "Glenn A."}

We had read the slew of positive reviews and Yelp and decided this would be a great place to celebrate. VERY mixed reviews. \n\nIn general, the food was good. I had the escargot for an appetizer - that was delicious. It was very flavorful and wasn't too dry. For an entree, I had the filet mignon. I was expecting it to be just as good as the appetizer, but I was let down a little. Maybe they screwed up mine, but it definitely was not a \"melt-in-your-mouth\" entree. Others at the table also got the filet, and they enjoyed it, but agreed with me. My mom actually got the sea bass, and she hated it -- way too salty... Quite disappointing for the price!\n\nThe chocolate cake for dessert was delicious, though. Very rich, and a nice way to top off the meal. \n\nBesides the food, the chef was kind - he came over and said hello; however, our waitress was SO RUDE. She repeatedly made comments suggesting that the customer was wrong, she reached over people to get silverware and plates, and honestly, she had a very snarky tone. I understand that people have bad days, but when someone is coming to your restaurant to celebrate an event of a lifetime (not to mention, spending over $500), you should at least give them good service.\n\nWould not come back again, would not recommend.

Make sure you make reservations early and give yourself plenty of time to eat!  I made reservations two days in advance and could only get reservations for 5:30 or 9:30 pm and chose the 9:30 seating.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by the hostess and the owner or manager.  Despite the fully seated dining room, we were brought to our table at almost exactly 9:30. We were given some bread and a crostini with rabbit.  Both of us used to have pet rabbits so we REALLY didn't want to eat it, but we did.  We both ordered the 4 course meal and chose different dishes so that we can try more:\n\nTrio of Salmon- Small pieces of raw salmon with a pretty decoration on the place made with sauces.  Make sure to eat each bite of salmon with every single component on the dish or it may taste bland. 4 stars\nSalade Landaise- The duck had a nice smokey flavor to it and went very well with the salad underneath it. 4 stars\n\nScallops with Lobster Bisque- Scallops were perfectly cooked and the lobster bisque was well seasoned and the flavor of lobster definately stood out.  There was a type of green pesto oil with the bisque which I didn't find that appealing with the rest of the dish. 3 Stars\n\nHalibut- Came with a tomato based sauce that reminded me of spaghetti-o's.  I don't remember much about the dish except that it was EXTREMELY salty.  We didn't finish it. 2 Stars\n\nFillet Mignon and added the bone marrow for an additional cost- Fillet Mignon was cooked perfectly to medium rare and tasted good with the mushrooms that it came with.  4 Stars. Bone marrow wasn't worth the additional cost as the paticular bone we got didn't have much marrow at all. 3 stars\n\nDessert-\nBasil Napolean-cute little dessert with fruits in a basket and a dallop of champagne whipped cream.  We were mainly curious about the champagne cream. It was light and was the perfect ending to a heavy meal. 5 stars.\n\nFrench Toast-Triple D- dengerous, decadent, and delicious.  OH and heavy..  Comes with 2 pieces of toast smothered in caramel sauce and topped with hazelnut ice cream.  It was sinful and delicious but we were so full that we couldn't finish it.\n\nOur waiter was SO sweet.  We asked about the profiteroles and said that since we were ordering the french toast, we should order the profiteroles because they pair nicely together.  My friend ended up getting the basil napolean, but he surprised us with an order of profiteroles on the house.\n\nWould I come here again?  Mneehhh, but it was worth the experience.\n\nTotal bill was I think $160 for two (including glasses of wine) and dinner took almost 3 hours to eat as your next entree is served when you're done with your current entree.", "author": "Cheryl Q."}

However, the second time around, I was utterly disappointed.  While there are still some standout moments, I expected a lot more for the price.  The first time around, everything was delicious, well prepared, and overall a great dining experience.  The reason for the 3 stars is in combination with the second experience, which was mediocre at best.  My biggest complaint is the entree, it lacked flavored and was not a well rounded dish.  And everything else we order was not very good either.  If I remember correctly, I had a halibut in a broth and some seasoned vegetables on the side ( this was the only fish selection of the night) and it was not very good.  Fish was cooked okay but the components all together was meh.  One thing I do enjoy is that the chef does step out of the kitchen to greet the customers but on that night, he greeted us twice and honestly, I thought the second time was him being funny.  We also were seated really late, despite having a reservation but they provided us with a free app that was good (it was a wrapper shrimp, poo was still included).  I do, however love the bread here.  It is always good.  But I can't seem to remember too much about the perks of this restaurant.  I do think it was an off day for the menu so I will try to visit again, in hopes of an experience closer to my first visit.", "author": "Amanda L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-09", "description": "I almost felt bad that we were dressed so casually from a post-museum trip and were just eating for the sake of eating rather than celebrating some romantic occasion.  Whether trying to impress your date or just looking for a non-Asian food option, this place won't disappoint.  Everyone seems to be steered towards the prix fixe options, which can make a long meal, but it's worth it for some old school French charm.\n\nCauliflower Soup: Anything with cream and truffle oil is a win for me.  This also had a really potent cauliflower taste, not mellowed out like many other overly cooked cream soups.  I appreciated that it was a free taste in the espresso cup, but it wasn't pungent enough to be a true palate opener.\n\nCheese Napoleon: There was a lot going on in this dish!  They could have been more heavy on the goat cheese, but I did enjoy all the various tastes and textures.  The eggplant pearls added a good smoky layer, but I wasn't a fan of its typical soggy texture amongst the firm, flaky and pasty layers.\n\nTrio of Salmon: A salmon lover's dream, but too fishy for me.  I enjoy salmon tartare, lox and salmon roe individually when paired against some starch/crunch and possibly cream.  Paired against each other put me in fish overload.  I ended up deconstructing small bites and pairing with the tiny bubbles of scrambled egg.\n\nFoie gras: Appetizer WIN!  Two huge portions of perfectly seared fatty liver oozing with complex flavor.  The bread base was too dense for my liking, almost like a muffin.  Would have preferred a fluffy brioche.  The pear fruit pairing was forgettable, thank goodness the foie gras was a star by itself!\n\nBouillabaisse: The accoutrements impressed me more than the fish soup, which was great anyway.  I received three separate containers from which I could assemble a toasted crostini with a creamy spread and top with grated cheese.  I then lowered the crostini into the soup to soak up the broth and it was magical!  The broth was rich with spices, tomato and the sea but not too fishy.  The shellfish was sparse with only a few clams and mussels while the three types of fish filet were overloaded.  Two of the fish filets were awesome, but the third was kind of rubbery.\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse: How can you go wrong with duck confit, sausage and cannellini beans?  Each item was great individually.  Together they were nice, but I didn't sense that the beans really absorbed the animal fat enough and could have been richer.\n\nScallops Taste:  I'm so glad they cooked their one large scallop properly.  The outsides were seared and crispy while the inside was moist and not too firm.  Cooking large scallops properly really is an art and they succeeded.  The pesto risotto was nice for novelty's sake since I've never had the two together and it tasted great balancing creamy and herbal perfectly.  The tomato chunks on top were firm and rich, like a non-dried version of sun dried tomatoes.\n\nCr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e: Standard.  I've had better, but also had worse.\n\nFloating Island: This looked like a Lady Gaga stage act.  A huge sugary dome that was like playground monkey bars on top of a large marshmallow looking meringue and floating in a moat of sweet cream.  The meringue was unique since it was a lot denser than the fluffier versions I've had on top of pies.  It was pure white, not touched by  a torch.  After the initial presentation shock and first few novel bites, it got a little tedious.  The sugar sculpture got sticky on my teeth and the rest went into sugar/cream/egg white excess.", "author": "Adam B."}

First of all, this restaurant is very small and they cram this tables very closely together. If you're looking for a romantic place to bring your date, this is NOT the place. Our table for 2 was so close to the next table that we could hear their entire conversation. Literally, this annoying guy next to us talked about himself the entire night to his date. And you feel restricted to talk because the people next to you could hear your entire conversation. So on with the food. We ordered the escargot and salmon trio as appetizers. They were both delicious. My date had the filet mignon & bone Marie which was quite good but nothing to rave about. The bone marrow was very oily. I had the duck confeit which comes with beans and 2 pieces of sausages. It tasted like duck over chili and was very salty. It was more Mexican than French to me. I've had French and this was not very authentic. Then comes dessert. We shared a creme brulee. Another disappointment! It tasted like it came out if a box!

It is by far the best deal.\n\nI started with the Deep Fried Black Tiger Prawns (with phylo dough, tomato and onion Marmelade and herbed aioli) and had California Black Cod as my entree (with fennel and leek, bacon flavored potatoes, shallot confit, and saffron emulsion). My boyfriend got the filet mignon, which was slightly better tasting in my opinion. \n\nI was least impressed with the desserts. The vanilla creme brulee was nothing to write home about, and the basil napoleon, while the healthiest on the menu, was definitely hard to eat. The non-fruit portion of this dish was a flaky and unsatisfying thin cookie that was like a sheet.\n\nIt's surprising how noisy this otherwise intimate space is.

The food was good, but the ambiance at the restaurant was only OK. It just so happened that they were participating in restaurant week when we came so I'm not sure if the restaurant is normally like this. The wait staff and host were very friendly, however, I was looking for a more romantic and intimate setting. I did appreciate how the chef walked around and thanked customers for visiting. The tables were all too crowded together, and while the service was not bad, it was not spectacular. Our table was too close to our neighbors so we were forced to endure listening to the guy next to us tell his significant other about how many liters of water he is able to consume in a day. For dessert, they did manage to do something special by sending out our dessert with a candle and wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-11", "description": "Arriving early sunday evening without a reservation, we were seated without wait at the bar. We split a 3-course prix-fixed (~40$) and a early-bird meal (~30$ !!).\n\nFor the prix-fixed, we began with the Salade Landais. It was an excellent, light salad with shredded duck mixed in, and topped with 2 other cuts of duck (one savory and one very tender). And with the early-bird, we selected the Mesclun Salad, a starkly contrasting hearty salad full of dark greens with a nice block of warm breaded camembert cheese. Both were very tasty and satisfying in their own respects.\n\nFor the prix-fixed entree course, we selected the Cassoulet which is a french favorite of mines. Though not a large plate, it had the unusually (for french cuisine) hearty blend of flavors and meats characteristic of this white-bean stew. It was very much worth the long wait. For the early-bird entree, we chose the pan-seared duck. This asian-fusion dish was light and had a nice combination of flavors that mixed on your tongue, though I preferred my cassoulet.\n\nWe were steered towards the Baked Alaska for the prix-fixed dessert. Though small, this treat of coffee ice cream atop cake and covered in meringue drizzled with chocolate and almond slices did not disappoint. For the early-bird, we chose the French Toast which topped with a scope of hazelnut ice cream was rich more like a bread pudding.

One foot in the door and everything about this place Chapeau'd! the pants right off of me. Also...because one of the servers walked by with a bowl of French onion soup and I took a quick whiff as my eyes rolled to the back of my head. Oh my goodness...\n\nGreeted by Chef Philippe himself with open arms and welcoming kisses on the cheek, he personally walked us to our table and explained the specials of the evening.\n\nI thought I had my heart set on the onion soup after being teased at the entrance, but once Chef mentioned \"pan seared foie gras\", I knew I had a dilemma. Was there a way to order both? Sure, why not. However, I don't think I would have been able to stomach that many courses in one sitting. So, foie gras it was, and boy am I glad I stuck with my instincts. Probably one of THE BEST foie gras I've ever had in my life. A little bit of fattened goose liver, a bite of buttery brioche, and an apple slice smothered in caramel cider sauce all on the tip of my fork tasted like heaven. The soft creamy texture of the foie gras balanced well with the crisp apple slices and the sweetness from the sauce depleted the gaminess. I only wish there was a larger cube of brioche so that every bite consisted of the perfect amount of each ingredient on this dish. Highly recommended to anyone who dines here. If you want to venture out to something less organy and more Frenchy, the escargots in garlic butter are divine!\n\nFish taster of the day for our 4-course meal was a pan seared diver scallop atop a bed of pesto risotto swimming in lobster cream sauce. This was the perfect portion to keep us satisfied and craving more in between our appetizer and main course. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto was doused with plenty of flavor. I didn't mind the harder grains of rice in the risotto than what I'm used to, mainly because the creaminess of the lobster sauce was able to smooth it out. \n\nFor my main course, I was torn between the porcini crusted veal sweetbreads and the Maple Farms duck breast with duck leg confit. Since my dearest cousin has never tasted sweetbreads, I went with the alternative so she could have a try. The duck breast was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the skin coated with a sweet citrus glaze. The bok choy was a bit out of place for this dish, but the polenta was a great side. Although the duck was superb, the veal sweetbreads totally won me over. In my next visit, I definitely plan to conquer a plate of sweetbreads on my own. Ended the meal with the French toast and hazelnut ice cream. Breakfast for dessert never tasted so good. The hazelnut ice cream was a delightful complement to the French toast, but pairing it with the rum raisin flavor from my cousin's chocolate cake was a better choice. \n\nThe best part about this meal was that every single dish came out of the kitchen piping hot. I couldn't believe the tab when it arrived in a cute little velvet top-hat. 2 glasses of wine/champagne, 2 4-course meals (including a $6 supplement for the foie gras), tip, & tax and the grand total was only $150!!

BUT I shall give you some tips to make your experience better. \n\n1) Reservations are a must, just do it, people who walk in get low priority and honestly this place was packed on a Wednesday night, expect it to be full up.\n\n2) Expect to be a while, you're getting a 3-4 course meal and expect each section to take about an 30-45 minutes. Come with company who you want to talk to!  The service does take a while but that's just how they operate. \n\nWe got around in 8:30 and we left around 11, about 2.5 hours for our 4 course meal. There was a decent wait between every course and honestly I'm kinda happy it was.\n\n3) Come on an empty stomach but don't fill up on the bread\n\n4) Escargot is fancy, but not that delicious. It tastes more like the flavoring around it than any unique taste to snails. I know, French restaurant, gotta have it? Nah, just skip it! \n\n5) Keep the bread around to soak up broths/gravies/juices, don't eat it with the butter or else you're stomach will fill up.\n\n6) Prepare for post dinner food coma if you order a 3 course meal.", "author": "Rohan D."}

And hearing so many speaking Chinese around me, I'd think it's a Chinese restaurant if I didn't know.  Feels pretty funny :P\n\nWe made reservation for 7:30pm, got there on time, starving, but we waited 30 min to be seated!--Combining crowded, noisy and made me waited for 30 min already made it lost one star. \n\nWhen we finally sat down -- I think we have the best seat of the restaurant, all the way to the end by the corner, where is less noisy and I can watch everybody ^^ -- our waiter brought the menu, without wine list, and I had to ask twice for him to bring me the wine list. This is definitely a minus one star! Maybe there are many Asian people eating there who usually don't order wine, so he pre-assumed that we don't need wine either, but sorry, I'm French, I drink when I eat! \n\nDisaster ended here though.  The food was really nice! Ordered 2 of the 4-course menu, 2005 Bordeaux Red St Emilion Grand Cru, loved the wine and the food.\n\nAppetizer:\n- Escargot de Bourgogne: I missed Escargot a lot!!! They made it easy, got it out of the shell already. Overall it tastes a bit lighter than the escargot from Burgundy, more like Paris type. I liked it tho, and almost \"drank\" all the sauce with bread too, yumm!!!\n- Trio of Salmon: very interesting dish, very fresh salmon, definitely a 5-star!\n\nFish Tasting - Scallop -- I love scallops! Though this tasting only contains 1 piece, but a very good piece that made me want to keep eating, glad that I chose this option.\n\nEntree:\n- Black Cod & beef cheek: Though not a lot, but very tasty! Both fish and beef are very tender, and nicely flavored\n-Cassoulet de Toulouse: Sausages, duck legs and beans...I happened to like them all! The duck leg is tender and easy to eat, with relatively heavy and flavored sauce with beans. I really wanted to finish it, but there are lots of beans, and I was pretty full already after eating too much bread with the escargot sauce :P\n\nDessert:\nPer chef's recommendation, we got Nuage de Noix and Baked Alaska.\nSince I'm not a mint lover, Nuage de Noix didn't interested me that much. But baked alaska is really good. Highly recommended!!!!\n\nThe food definitely added up one star back, and Chef Phillipe was really nice. Talked with him for a bit, and when we left, wanted to say bye, but he was busy with other customers, so we walked out, surprisingly he walked out to say bye to us, and fait un bisou, comme en France. I was really impressed! \n\nReally want to give it 5 stars, but I still feel kinda irritated that I went to a French restaurant and had to ask twice for the wine menu, so I'll keep it 4-stars, but highly recommended the restaurant!!!

I actually now want to go back and rate Chez Papa 4 stars instead of 3 that I originally gave it, because I thought it was definitely better than Chapeau.\n\nFor whatever reason, despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't extremely busy that evening, it took them forever to bring out each course and I was starting to get antsy.\n\nOur group ordered:\n\nEscargot - very good and probably one of the better things we tried on the menu\n\nFoie gras - good, but still does not compare to some of the best foie gras that I've had in other French restaurants\n\nScallop (came with the 4-course prix fix) - Ok, but nothing spectacular\n\nDuck breast with polenta - I expected so much from this dish after reading all the raving reviews. However, I was extremely disappointed. They got it all wrong - it was done way too rare and yet it was still chewy, not at all tender and lacked the nice crust on the outside that a good duck breast should have. It did not taste good at all. My husband ordered the duck as well and shared my opinion of it.\n\nFilet Mignon- my friend ordered this, so I only tried a bite of hers. It tasted much better than my duck, so in retrospect I wish I had ordered the filet for my entree. The portion is a generous size too.\n\nBasil Napoleon - this dessert was my favorite item from the entire dinner. Very unique, delicate and light. I thought it was a clever combination of flavors and spices. My only complaint was the small portion.\n\nFrench Toast with Hazelnut ice cream - I thought it was good, but not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. It has a rich taste and is very filling, so do not get it if you are already nearly full.\n\nCheese plate - even as a huge cheese lover, I did not care so much for the selection of cheeses here. They were all pretty intense. I thought the cheese plate at Bisou was much better.\n\nConclusion: I think you can have a good dining experience here, but have to be careful with what you order.

Thankfully the seats are further apart now, but it is still noisy. The staff is exceptionally friendly and interactive, including several visits by the owner and chef. I had a few minor complaints - one is that after making an online reservation, they called the day before and asked me to call them back to confirm that I'd be there. That seems a bit self-important, and made me question whether the place was too pretentious for my casual dining plan. The other minor complaint was that the (paper print-out) menu does not list many of add-on specials that the server hurriedly recites table-side. Some are quite expensive ((over $100 for a Prime Rib special, for example), so it would be easy to order something impulsively that turns out to be rather pricey.

I know this is a nice French restaurant and it's going to take some times for the whole dinner. However, I feel like we were being ignored was a totally different story. During that half an hour wait time, our waiter had never checked on us once. The service is pretty bad in a pricey restaurant like this.

Definitely a warming place as when we first arrived, the chef came out and hooked me up with quarters from his pocket for the parking meter. He is a really friendly and nice guy who is surprising outdone by his kitchen skills. I thought I never would like caviar, but when they gave us some free ones while waiting for the food to come out, I was so amazed by how great they made it tasted. Words cannot not describe the flavoring on the palette; you just have to try it, but remember to take only small bites at a time to get the real appreciation. My date loved her Fillet Mignon so I snuck some bites :D. I opted for the Cassoulet de Toulouse (Canellini Beans, Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder, Duck Leg Confit, Garlic & Toulouse Sausage). The duck and lamb together was done so right, much better than just duck leg confit at other places.

The good news is that the maitre d' totally rocks and agreed to move the sign in front of the restaurant out of the way so I could park in the best spot possible. Epic win for us, even if it was proceeded by 5-10 minutes worth of grumbling and foul words while scouring the surrounding blocks for a spot! They were also kind enough to hold our table 15 minutes, which is really an exceptional amount of time (given most places will be quite eager to give your seat up. Service was good, if not exactly warm. My experience has generally been that SF restaurants tend to be friendlier, but this definitely had the feel and vibe of an upscale place in Manhattan.\n\nAs for the food - I wavered between 4 and 5 stars because all of it was delicious, but nothing (outside of the dessert) really blew me away or was uniquely special. The amuse bouche was a well-prepared cauliflower soup - not totally plain, but not too salty that the simple nature of the soup was overrun. As others have said, the foie gras (which was a special) was delicious and absolutely delectable; I was also very pleased with the trio of salmon - you definitely got the different types of salmon in the dish, and the sides added nice pockets of flavor to it. The entrees were fairly standard; my fiancee had the lamb chop, which was very good but not exceedingly remarkable, while I had the filet mignon with the bone marrow addition. The filet was cooked just right, although, in true French style, they put a little bit more sauce on it than I would have preferred. The bone marrow was pure fatty heaven, though, and was great on the fresh bread that was served before the meal. The seafood of the day was a pan-seared scallop with risotto and lobster sauce. Not the best risotto I've had, nor the best scallop, but both were done above average. By this point, we were pretty stuffed and decided to pass on some of the more aggressive dessert choices (like the chocolate cake, which read deliciously) and stuck with the trio of sorbets and the French toast. The sorbets were all fresh and a good diverse selection, but the French toast was the highlight for me - it's drizzled with caramel and is paired with a rich hazelnut ice cream. I'm a huge fan of French toast to begin with, but I've had a lot of variants as of late, and I really like what they did with it for dessert.\n\nAll in all, the meal was fantastic. I really liked the appetizers and the desserts, but I think the middle 2 portions of our 4-course meal could have been slightly stronger. That said, for the price - $46 is very fair given the quantity and quality of food - I would definitely come back here for dinner again.

I have frequented this restaurant since it opened in late '96, and was located deeper into the avenues.   However, since moving to Petaluma 3 years ago, it has been several years since I have had the pleasure to eat here.    It's really reassuring to know that some things do actually stay the same in life as the years go by - it was superb!  As if no time at all had passed, Philippe greeted our table and we chatted easily.  Considering the 1,000s of people he has met over the years, it feels very special to know that one is remembered.  Ellen came by shortly to attend to our immediate beverage needs, and the rest of the evening flowed perfectly, both regarding the food and the service.  Their staff is extremely attentive, yet unobtrusive, and there was never an empty water glass or a missed piece of silverware.  \n\nNow for the food...I did a 3 course tasting menu, starting with the rich, but finely textured, roasted chestnut soup.  It was the perfect thing for an autumn evening.  I usually stay away from soup, as it fills me up too quickly, but I just couldn't pass it up.  I followed up the soup with a goat cheese napoleon.  Not only was it a gorgeous presentation, but the goat cheese was delectably smooth, creamy, and on the milder side. \n\nFinally, I went traditional and had mussels, with a side of perfectly crisp, hot, little golden frites.  Heaven...\n\nEvery dessert, which no one really needed, was fabulous.  Although the molten chocolate cake is not an unusual dessert, this one was just a stand out.  The warm chocolate came gushing out of the cake, and though it was a dark, rich chocolate, it was not cloying, nor too sweet. \n\nThe wine list is quite varied, offers great value, and Philippe's suggestions are always spot on.  The restaurant itself has a very warn, welcoming and elegant, yet neighborhood sort of feel to it.  I can't wait to go back and am planning another evening before Christmas!", "author": "Carol O."}

Mussel portion was very generous (we thought the kitchen sent the entree size by mistake) and fresh tasting without sand or grit.  The fries were hot and salted just right; however, they were a little soggy.  Unusual, since they were hot.  Perhaps the chefs  don't \"double dip\" them to crisp them?  I had the pork tenderloin l'orange for my entree.  The orange sauce was great, but the tenderloin was a little dry.  Maybe i should have requested medium rare, but i was afraid to since it's pork.  \n\nI never see baked Alaska on anyone's menu as it's fallen out of fashion with today's diner's.  I just had to try it though!  I was curious to see the chef's take on an old desert.  It was Fantastic!  Extra star just for the baked Alaska!  It was traditionally made, individually sized.  So nothing new, just a great tasting desert.  \n\nThe dining room is being renovated, according to their menu, but I didn't notice any issues.  I did notice a few lonely walls in need of artwork.

It was a good meal, but did not live up to my (admittedly very high) expectations.  \n\nFirst of all, the prices on the website are inaccurate.  It's not a huge difference, but this is a big pet peeve of mine.   They offer an \"early bird\" prix fixe for $31.75 (listed as $28 on the website) from 5-6 pm every day but Friday and Saturday.   You can choose an app, entree, and dessert from some set choices (about 4 options for each course).   They also offer a \"Menu 1\" (any app, entree, dessert) for $40.50 (listed as $38 on the web) and a \"Menu 2\" (Menu 1 + a \"tasting fish\") for $49.50 (listed as $46 on the web).   There is also that SF health insurance charge of roughly $2 per person.  The menu choices are also slightly different in the restaurant than on the web.  I know there is probably some day to day variation based on availability, but I was quite disappointed that both my desired appetizer + entree were not on the menu when we arrived.  This is probably not a big deal to normal people who don't plan their meals in detail days or weeks in advance, but was disappointing to me.\n\nWe started with an amuse bouche of cauliflower bisque, which was nice.  It had some truffle flavor to it.  I did Menu 2, the four courses.  For my appetizer, I had the white corn soup, which was served with a crabcake in the middle of it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#B1kv-rj9kdrjnoSGlMnYdg).   This was very good.  The soup was creamy and had a great corn flavor and the crabcake was excellent.   My fiance did the Early Bird menu and had an appetizer of smoked rainbow trout (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#eqgneuumnQxts9k3C1GC_g), which he really enjoyed.   The tasting fish was a single dayboat scallop served over pesto risotto and lobster bisque (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#isceefwoa_ccByoq_fWpkQ).   Based on Yelp this appears to be the tasting fish quite regularly.   This sounds amazing to me (its a combination of several of my food faves) but unfortunately was only ok, not nearly as good as it sounded.  The pesto \"risotto\" was basically just rice with pesto, not creamy at all, and the scallop was a little overcooked.  It was definitely not worth $9.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the Alaskan halibut (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#cSW86ppNBOiv8TXngWSKiw).  The fish was cooked well and had a good flavor, but I didn't love the surrounding sauces and accompaniments.    I did appreciate that it was not too salty, as lately I have been finding a lot of white fish in restaurants overly salted.  My fiance had a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#a147HoQ_3_-_KcYF5ZERSw), which he really enjoyed.\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate cake, which is a molten lava cake with a \"banana flambe\" in the middle, accompanied by rum raisin ice cream and caramel sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#vOSgv9F4kauxkh17Pre5jQ).   (I'm not going to lie, the pictures of this cake on Yelp were about 2/3rds of the reason for our trip to this restaurant).   The cake was very good (dark, rich, not overly sweet) but did not blow me away quite as much as I expected it to.  It was a pretty standard, albeit quite good, molten lava cake.  My fiance had some kind of French toast dessert dish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L5vSeC_sa3TUQW_lticqyA?select=P0bgvgH1HS94ynEWU2mDyQ#JNQtRLJ82Jk2T0edgyQl0Q), which he liked.\n\nThe worst part of this restaurant is the ambiance.  The tables are crowded much too close together, which detracts from the otherwise upscale ambiance they are going for.   As a result of the tables being smushed togther, the blowhard at the table next to us put quite a damper on our meal.   The service was pretty good, but there was a long time between each course.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good meal, but not worth the 3-hour roundtrip drive into the city and probably not quite worth the price (at least for the regular prix fixe menus, the early bird is a very good deal).  My normal barometer for 4 stars is whether I would go back with my own money, and I'm not sure I would (even assuming I lived in the city and factoring out the distance factor).  But my fiance really liked his food, and I feel like maybe I ordered the wrong entree, so I'll round up.", "author": "A M."}

The meal began with an amuse-bouche, an espresso cup of some magical tomato \"soup\" that tasted like the pure essence of a perfectly ripened tomato, with just a hint of heat.  I have no idea how this wonderful liquid was made, but as soon as I tasted it, I knew we had chosen the right restaurant. For my appetizer, I had the beautiful trio of salmon--gravlax, tartare, and caviar, garnished with microgreens, fried capers, and chopped egg and dressed with a light touch of creme fraiche. The salmon was fresh and cold and sumptuous, and the restrained garnishes added some crunch and interesting flavors to each bite.  The tasting fish was a perfectly cooked scallop served atop a fresh basil risotto that just sang--a lovely summer aria. My entree was a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with kale, parsnip puree, and a calvados sauce. The pork was tender and juicy, the parsnips were creamy, and the calvados sauce added depth to the whole dish, and what better to pair with pork than an apple brandy?  For dessert, the basil napoleon, which was fresh fruits with a citrus-champagne pastry cream layered between light-as-air feuilles--a light, tart, perfect ending to a wonderful meal.  I was happy to see that the wine list included some half-bottles of wine, and that's what we ordered--half a bottle of a nice cote de Rhones.\n\nChef Phillippe Gardelle welcomes you and makes you feel at home as soon as you walk in the door and then sends you on your way with a charming continental double-kiss as you leave.  He promises that his restaurant offers a great deal on French food, and both my dining companion and I agree.  We each had a cocktail before dinner, and the entire bill for both of us was $150, tax included.  Clement Street is off the beaten path but boasts a large number of restaurants.

Located in Inner Richmond, parking availibility is awesome and location is convenient being close to Golden Gate Park. This quaint restaurant providing white table cloth dining exudes an elegant, classy, and sophisticated feel. Chef /owner is French as is the staff. I dined here yesterday and was graced with an older French gentleman, Pascal, as our waiter. He was very pleasant, knowledgeable, and warm-spirited, which topped off my experience dining here. Now moving on to the best part: FOOD.\n\nI ordered a prix fixed 3-course meal. Appetizer: A classic- French onion soup. It was served piping hot, just as a like it. What I really appreciated about this dish was the abundance of natural flavors of onion and cheesy goodness (not just salt). I've had many french onions that were just plain salty. The cheese was melted perfectly on top and went well with the complimentary warm french bread that was provided for the table. Entree: Monkfish served with butternut squash risotto, lobster sauce. I read that in France monkfish was also called the \"poor man's lobster\" which captured my interest as it is uncommon for fish to have a lobster-like texture. Biting into the filet I expected a tougher texture, however I was pleasantly surprised with a buttery tender texture, exploding with the flavors of the lobster sauce underneath. The butternut squash risotto was cooked perfectly which I applaud. Dessert: Vanilla bean creme brulee. Light and refreshing and a perfect ending to an almost flawless execution of classic French cuisine and excellent service!", "author": "Jennifer F."}

My favorite thing I ordered was actually the starter, which was the Mesclun Salad with Cr\u00e8me Dijonnaise, Red Seedless Grapes, Pistachio, Fried Camembert & Walnut Bread. This dish was divine. I loved the light but sweet dressing and the pistachios really added taste and texture to this delightful salad. I enjoyed the grapes also because they were so sweet and mixed really well with the greens.  I finished every morsel off my plate and it left me wanting for more. Highly recommended!\n\nThe entree I ordered was the Atlantic Salmon, which was cooked perfectly. It was moist and the skin was crispy, just the way I liked it. The flavors were also light and fulfilling. \n\nAs for dessert, I went for the French Toast, Soft Caramel, Hazelnut Ice Cream on Jus de Poulet. The hazelnut ice cream was soooo delish! I liked the French toast but I would have preferred it not drenched in the jus it came with. \n\nOverall, the service was excellent. The chef himself greeted us twice with a smile and our cups were never empty with water. I liked the attention and care the servers gave us and I definitely felt welcomed.

I've been to Chapeau before they moved to the new location and the food is consistently good! the only down-fall recently (June 2012) one of the servers, he was not very attentive. Maybe they need to hire an extra server, because they are just getting super busy! And the Chef ,he use to come by to the tables and say Hi as courtesy and this time I felt like he doesn't do that to all his tables...maybe too busy in the kitchen. Regardless, FOOD is TOO GOOD. \n\nI loved loved the seared foie gras it was just AMAZINGLY good. I use to love getting their escargots and oysters for appetizers because they were good, but I went for the foie gras, since they are banning it soon!!\n\nI always get the prince mussels with frites. They are delicious!! One time, I decided to take the offer of scallops over risotto and the scallops was cooked so perfectly I devour it quickly. \n\nThe boy ordered the rabbit+lamb for his entree and he loved it. I am not a big fan of lamb so I didn't try it. \n\nI guess they have a new dessert? This time I had the French toast, and at the end of dinner, I was wondering whereeee this dessert was when I came the other two-three times!!!

We started with warm bread and butter and a complimentary serving of a chilled tomatoe bisque which was very good.\n\nFor appetizers I had the mussels with fries and he had the French onion soup.  Both were delicious.  \n\nThe tasting fish was scallop over a bed of pesto risotto with a lobster bisque around it. I love scallops but this one was a bit flavorless.  Pesto risotto was different.  I would have been perfectly fine if we had skipped this dish.\n\nFor the entree I had the veal sweetbreads and he had the rabbit.  I don't know what is wrong with us but we were not impressed at all with our entrees!   Everyone around us raved how good the sweetbreads and rabbit were to the chef.  I loved the mushrooms and truffle sauce that accompanied the sweetbreads but I just couldn't stomach them!  Its the texture and creaminess of the sweetbreads that I'm not use to.  I tried some rabbit and thought it was sort of dry.  Both entrees were beautifully presented tho!\n\nFor the dessert I had the French toast with hazelnut ice cream.

Someone greeted us at the door, took our coats for us, and the chef came out himself to shake our hands.  You get a family feel with the ambiance of a classy French restaurant.  \n\nFood:  we came here for the early bird prix fixed menu which was so much food for a very reasonable price!\n\n- APPETIZER: we both had the trio of salmon, which was salmon done in three ways.  It was so fresh tasting and very filling (I felt like I was half full after finishing the dish!)  Definitely delicious!\n\n- MAIN: I had the salmon (I know, I know, a lot of salmon that night, but I'm a pescatarian!) which was served over mashed potatoes.  The salmon was just okay...I've had better, but the mashed potatoes were really good.  My friend had pan seared duck breast, which I'm going to assume was good because he finished the whole thing.\n\n- DESSERT:  My friend had the profiteroles - these cream puffs doused with a chocolate sauce.  I had the vanilla bean creme brulee which was good, but served cold, which was a bit of a surprise.   Here comes the best part of the story (which brings me back to the amazing service): my friend and I were catching up for hours...so much so that the waiter came by and asked if we would please move to another table because they had a large party coming in.  We moved and they brought out completely fresh desserts for us even though we were nearly finished with ours.  They then gave us an additional complimentary dessert and coffee and tea.\n\nI feel a little bad that we went for the early bird dinner and didn't leave till about 9...but they were completely gracious and I will definitely come back.

Pretty good deal, eh?    \n\nAnd as for the food.  Did they deliver?  Here's a rundown of all the eats:\n\n+ Bread: warm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. Slathered some butter on it, and it was super yummy!\n+ Pastry sticks with anchovies: Complimentary little bites, one for each of us. I suppose this was the amuse-bouche if I had to call it something, and a fun little beginning to the meal.\n+ Red beet soup: Wow, what a complex soup - so many flavors!  It pleased my senses!  The soup itself was pretty thick in consistency and hearty.  It was slightly tangy, partly savory, and partly creamy.  There was some kind of cream/cheese in the middle of the soup, which was visually pleasing too.  On a cold day, a warm, hearty soup like this was perfect.\n+ Smoked trout: This came with a side of greens, and I thought it was alright.  The trout was quite...smokey, and the anchovy that came along with it was super salty for my taste, but I did like the dish overall.\n+ Duck leg confit and duck breast: We ordered this medium rare, and it came on top of some pretty tasty polenta.  I didn't particularly love the breast pieces and found it somewhat lacking in flavor, but I did enjoy the duck leg.  While I wasn't wowed by it, it was still pretty good.\n+ Pork tenderloin: We ordered this medium rare, and although it came out medium, I really liked it.  There was also a bed of mashed potatoes, some greens, and pears too, which were fun to eat.  Overall, a tasty piece of meat!  I'd order this again! \n+ Basil napoleon: Like!  I was very surprised when this dish came out, as I was expecting a dessert that would look like a standard napoleon.  Instead, it was somewhat of a fruit salad with pineapple, strawberry, kiwi, mango, and banana, with four super thin slices of pastry.  The basil was an AMAZING touch - that basil flavor is genius and it's JUST what this dessert needed!  Not overly sweet at all, so light and refreshing, what a great end to a meal! \n+French toast: This was the other dessert we got; it was the polar opposite of the basil napoleon dessert but at the same time, I think this heavy dessert was a great contrast to the first dessert.  A very rich piece of toast, with a scoop of hazelnut ice cream and hazelnut sauce drizzled all over it.  Sweet, rich, and tasty.  \n\nFor $30/person (before tax/tip), I thought it was a great deal for stellar food.  Service was also good, our bread was constantly refilled, and our waiter was very friendly.\n\nAlso, when we got here around 5:30pm on a Thursday, the place was maybe half-filled, but as we got into our meal the restaurant filled up quickly.  With the dim lighting, cozy booths, and happy patrons with their food and wine, it felt like the perfect place to be on a wet and windy evening.  Very good ambiance, casual, comfy.  \n\nIn sum, it was warm and delicious.  I'll be back!", "author": "Vivian C."}

I was still so excited from it.  We were lucky to get the very last reservations at 9:15, just before they closed up.  But they treated us like we were the first ones there for the day.  Let me start by saying that the service was amazing.  Not only from the server, but the chef personally comes out with some of the dishes himself.  When the heck was the last time you've seen that happen?!  Not only that, but he personally introduced himself to EVERYONE.  I mean EVERYONE.  When he first came over, one of us was not present at the table.  He remembered that and he actually came back 10 minutes later to welcome her to the restaurant.  Dude.\n\nwe all opted for the 4 course and i got the palate cleanser.  So glad I did.  Let me go over the food I remember:\n\nfoie gras with apple and microgreens with a carmel sauce:  I freaking love foie gras and this was no exception.  So amazing.  Perfect sear.  Only complaint was that I prefer it a bit thicker, but it was still so wonderful.  The apple of course pairs well (come on, anything sweet will pair with foie gras) and the microgreens are the trend now.\n\nTasting fish was scallop over pesto risotto with some sort of a fish sauce.  Not the Vietnamese fish sauce but some sort that he made himself.  totally different so dont be confused.  It was ridiculous!  Scallop was a perfect sear.  Not over cooked or anything.  Pesto risotto was surprising and like everything else, technically perfect.  Flavor was amazing as well.  So creamy, I loved it.  That sauce put everything together.\n\nduck confit with duck breast.  very traditional.  Duck breast was perfect.  classic orange pairing with it.  I felt the duck confit was a bit dry.  Somehow...  isn't it supposed to be baked in its oil?  Maybe it was because we had the last batch of the day...? I dunno.  It was still good.\n\nSkate wing.  first time I've had it, definitely won't be my last the way Chef Phillipe Gardelle cooked it.  So amazingly good.  So.  Good.\n\nPalate cleanser.  A must!  Vodka infused with lemon ginger.  The sorbet with it... dude.\n\nDessert... again, dude.  I was so freaking stuffed by the end.  there were 5 of us, we ordered 5 different ones, but since we were the last group of the day, they threw in a 6th dessert for us to try them all.  No complaints about any of them.  None.  We had the basil napoleon, french toast, chocolate cake, nodue de naiz (I totally have no idea how to spell it, it was some frozen creme type of thing), and a puff pastry dessert.  My gf literally finished everything.  I mean literally.  Dude.  So good.\n\nMake reservations.  Now.", "author": "Darren T."}

I've been wanting to go for a while and finally had a reason to, my BF birthday.  Couldn't be a better way to celebrate on a Friday night than with French food in our neighborhood gem. \n\nThis place is small, intimate and unpretentious, it's very simple inside yet the little touches and classic service make it authentically French.   The service was great all around, knowledgeable waiters and attentive staff that really is there to make a great experience.   We wanted to have a long drawn out meal and they knew that without us saying a word.  \n\nWe began with glasses of champagne and began to make our selections, everything looked scrumptious and the only let down was they ran out of the sweetbreads, if they told us as we sat down, it wouldn't have been a big deal, but they told as we were ready to order, that was a oversight on their part.  \n\nBut we settled on salmon tartar three ways, and the steak and lamb for the entrees and red wine of course.  The tartar was the least favorite part of the meal, it was ok but nothing special and it really lacked flavor, in fact it was kinda bland.  The wine was very smooth and the prices very reasonable.   Everything was delicious, the steak and lamb were incredibly cooked, paired beautifully  with eggplant and truffles.  What is it about French food that is just so great.   \n\nThis is the place to truly enjoy your food and considering the quality the bill was really reasonable, I've had more expensive food and not been nearly as satisfied.  \n\nUsually we get coffee but since it was a celebration, we got the warm chocolate cake, which took 15 minutes and well worth the wait.  It was a great ending to a great meal even if it wasn't the best cake I've ever had.

Keep in mind that there is a \"special\" menu which you need to ask for which included the Foie Gras. And I must say, it was probably the BEST Foie Gras I've ever had. Unfortunately, California just passed a law banning Foie Gras so i'm glad I had the last bit of Foie Gras before it's gone forever. :( RIP Foie Gras you will surely be missed. As an entree I ordered the Filet Mignon which was executed very well. The filet was perfectly cooked and it looked fabulous on the plate as well. We cleaned out our plates so we were too full for dessert but as we were leaving the chef greeted us again and thanked us for coming. I will definitely be returning!", "author": "Megan D."}

I tried to reserve a table on open table but the place was fully booked for the night, so my group took a chance to call the restaurant to see if they could squeeze us in at our desired time, and just like that, we were booked with no problems. Upon arrival we were greeted by the restaurant owner who welcomed us in with a firm handshake and seated us at our table, our jackets were taken to be hung and water and bread were brought out to start us off. I started my night with the very creamy chestnut soup that was nicely drizzled in truffle oil, duck fat and garlic. Wow, what a way to start off my night, I was already in heaven. For the entree, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, is there a better way to tenderize pork than to wrap it in bacon, one word delicious. Chapeau! did not stop there as they made me a satisfied customer when they completed the trifecta with their dessert, the \"Nuage De Noix\" made with roasted pistachios, almonds & hazlenuts in a frozen chantilly & Italian meringue, orange soup was simply refreshing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-15", "description": "4 1/2 stars for Chapeau.  Took the boyfriend here for his birthday and we were quite pleased!  We ordered the 4-course prix fixe menu (appetizer, tasting fish, entree, dessert) and also added the palate cleansers (a pre-entree sorbet).  I would highly recommend getting the 4-course since it is a great deal AND the tasting fish is delicious (though you can skip the palate cleansers)!  Here is the breakdown on our feast:\n\nAPPETIZERS: \n- Cauliflower soup - 5/5: They brought us small cups on the house and it was delicious!  Very creamy and flavorful.\n\n- Warm brie appetizer - 5/5: This made my night.  I have had warm brie appetizers before, but never anything like this.  It was the perfect balance of savory and sweet.  I was blown away and would absolutely order it again!\n\n- Nicoise salad - 5/5:  Unlike Nicoise salads I've had in the past, Chapeau used seared ahi, a quail egg, and very fresh ingredients.  This was one of the bf's fav dishes of the evening.\n\nTASTING FISH:\n- Scallop in a lobster bisque with risotto - 5/5:  This dish was heavenly and was the other standout dish of the evening.  The risotto was flavorful and the lobster bisque really tied everything together - absolutely perfect.  This is a MUST order if they have it on the menu.\n\n- Prince Edward Island Mussels - 4/5:  I don't generally like mussels, but these were quite tasty.  The accompanying fries were decent and served with a tasty seasoned mayo.\n\nPALATE CLEANSERS\nWe ordered both the trou normand (green apple sorbet) and the colonel (lemon-ginger sorbet).  I thought the trou normand was decent, though nothing I would ever crave or order again.  I disliked the colonel, but I hate ginger, so don't take my word for it.  \n\nENTREES \n(Note: Take my reviews regarding the entrees with a grain of salt, since we were far from hungry by the time they arrived.)\n\nBlack cod with beef cheeks - 3.5/5:  Decent, but nothing special.  The mashed potatoes were tasty.\n\nSkate wing - 2/5:  We didn't love the skate wing.  The texture was not what we were expecting, and it was kind of sour and salty.  There was little incentive to eat it since we were really full, so we skipped it after a few bites. \n\nDESSERTS\nCreme brulee - 4/5: Delicious.  It is not served warm, but the vanilla bean flavor is terrific.  This is one of the lighter desserts and a good choice if you are fairly full by the time dessert rolls around.\n\nFrench toast - 5/5: French toast for dessert?  Sign me up!  This is a bit on the heavier side, but I really enjoyed the caramel sauce and the hazelnut ice cream.  I would order this again.\n\nSERVICE\nImpeccable.  I accidentally made a reservation for the wrong night, but they still took us and gave us the perfect little corner table.  Our waiter was very attentive throughout the meal and quite friendly without being overbearing.\n\nThough I didn't love the entrees, I loved EVERYTHING else and can't wait to come back to Chapeau!", "author": "Julie S."}

Scallop cooked nicely and pesto flavor sang through the risotto. That mixed with the lobster sauce was a candidate for bread dipping to leave the plate without a trace \n- Bread: warm, crispy, soft and slightly sweet French. It was just heavenly. Had to restrain myself from eating too many slices to save room for my meal\n- Service: one of the best I've had as all of the staff was fully on top of everything. From taking our order, to delivery and takeaway of our plates, to the constant water filling, they were always right there yet not intrusive.\n- French onion soup: loved their version as the onions were so tender and the broth nicely sweet. Hub just would've liked more cheese \n- Chocolate cake: the standard molten version but with banana inside and using Valrhona chocolate for an intense cocoa flavor\n- Blueberry tart: had 2 special tarts that day and the waiter indicated the blueberry one was \"very French.\" I was most impressed by how the blueberries remained fully plump inside the tart. \n- Pork: bacon wrapped tenderloin where the bacon seemed embedded on the outside of the pork. Shredded brussel sprouts and parsnip puree were unique accompaniments.\n- Cassoulet: hugest one I've seen filled with beans, sizable duck leg, full sausage link, and a slice of another sausage. Menu said shredded lamb shoulder and I think that was baked into the main dish which I was fine with since I'm not so into strong lamb flavors.\n- Menu style: picking any appetizer, entree, or dessert at a set price works well. Like the fish tasting option for the 4 course menu as I love variety\n- Cute whimsical theme: taking the french translation of it's name, your bill comes in a hat (yet a cowboy hat which makes it more humorous) \n\nLowlights:\n- Seating: tables close together so hard to have a private conversation or not hear the next table's\n\nHad a lovely and delicious time here and would love to do it again.", "author": "Eve K."}

The smoked trout was delicious!  A little on the salty side, but still no complaints.  I got the Filet Mignon for my main entree and it was so perfect.  I can't remember what sauce it came with, but everything complimented each other so well.  For dessert I had the typical creme brulee.  I thought it was strange at first because it was served cold, but the amazing vanilla taste made up for it. \n\nThe only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star rating was because of the insane amount of time we had to wait in between our appetizer and the main course.

I considered marking them down a star for how close you end up sitting with other people, but everything else was so good, I moved it back to 5, and it's not their fault if you get stuck to a loud talking braggart who wants everyone to hear about his vacation home in Monaco...(but I digress)\n\nI had Foie Gras (you should hear me slaughter that pronounciation) and my wife went with a corn soup with crab meat.  Both were absurdly good and came out of the kitchen quickly.  We then had the prime rib for two with a bottle of Sangiovese.  They had 3 sauces for the prime rib --a burneise, truffle something and something with bleu cheese (I think).  They were all tasty, but as a purist, I went with just the meat and only sampled those sauces (they were great).  My wife asked to take the rest of hers home (she never does that).

It was Friday night, what can you expect?  If you go, pay attention to the little details: the hostess knows exactly where to put you, the bus boys never let your water glass go below 50% and they keep an eye on your bread and butter, other servers will help bring out food when it's ready and they coordinate all of it in a very small working space.

Specific notes regarding the courses we had at our table:\n\n* Trio of Salmon - scrumptious but for the croutons which can get soggy quickly.  I pushed the croutons aside, thinking that the chef might find a better substitute to give the intended texture. Although I'm a fan of this dish still, it's not a trademark since salmon, capers, mash, and sprigs come at a variety of restaurants done similarly well.***\n* Escargot - well flavored and a hit!  I had a lesser experience of escargot before, so I apprehended tasting the snail again, but this was as pleasant as calamari.\n\n* Wild Skate - another dish with capers (yum!) that was well complemented with potato mash and awesome sauce :)\n* Pork Tenderloin - the dish erred on the side of uniform sweetness incorporated by bacon... some may like this, but I felt perhaps the chef could have contrasted the pork and bacon more so with one salty and the latter mapled.  Just my opinion that if you're going to have multiple meats in a dish, you might show the intention or some distinction between objects?***\n\n* Nuage de Noix - MY. FAVORITE.  ...I will come back for you.\n* Creme Brulee - sets a good benchmark for the popular dessert. \n\n***I'm not a chef myself and don't intend this to sound elevated, but soggy croutons and uniflavored, variable meats made me wonder.\n\nAll in all, this is my new French escape of choice.

He suggested that we go in 15 minutes early, in hope for our table to be available to us. IT WAS! My mood started to peak up.\n\nOur waiter was very helpful in explaining the menu to us and the specials they had for the night. The two of us decided to go for the 4 course meal which gives us a choice of an appetizer, tasting fish, an entr\u00e9e & dessert. Wanting to make sure I get to taste a little bit of everything from the menu, I made sure Jimmy ordered different dishes then I did.\n\nFor Appetizers:\n-Pan Seared Foie Gras with fresh sliced Apples \n-Trio of Salmon\n-Traditional Onion Soup \n\nAll was very scrumptious and appetizing. Foie Gras was the most favored, followed by the Trio of Salmon.\n\nFor Tasting Fish:\n-Seared Scallop over a creamy base Risotto\n\nAlthough I don't really care for scallop, I though the shellfish was cooked just right and the flavors were savory. However, the risotto was a bit undercooked. \n\nFor Palate Cleanser:\n-Trou Normand: Green Apple Sorbet, Calvados\n\nThe apple sorbet was refreshing and delightful but the moment I tasted the brandy, I, seriously, wanted to vomit. Not a fan of brandy. Nevertheless, it did do its job, which is cleaning the palate for the entree. \n\nFor Entr\u00e9e:\n-Wild Caught Skate Wing in a Brown Butter w/ Fingerling Potato\n-Filet Mignon w/ King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms\n\nThe skate wing was so yummy! The texture of the fish is soft and stringy (that's the best word I can think of to describe it) something new to me but accepting. Filet Mignon was cooked exactly how I asked for which was rare. All delicious but the sauce was somewhat too salty for me. \n\nFor Dessert:\n-Profiteroles, a puff pastry filled with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled w/ chocolate.\n-French Toast on a soft caramel sauce and topped w/ hazelnut ice cream \n\nThe French Toast dessert was THE BEST dessert I've ever had, hands down, I would go back just to eat that!

I wouldn't really come here on an regular day because some of the dishes can get pretty pricey.  \n\nThey served complimentary slices of bread with butter along with a small tea cup of cauliflower puree.  The tea cup was fairly small; about the size of a shot glass.  It was kind of cute though having its little handle on the side.  The handle can't even fit an average size finger so you have to pick it up with your thumb and index finger. *pinkie finger up* #likeasir lol  We weren't sure if we were supposed to dip the bread in the puree but we did anyway.

My dish arrived in a ceramic plate (I think) containing the lamb and duck within a pool of beans.  I felt like they should have done something more creative than let the lamb and duck just sit in there.  I would rather have a side of veggies or something else of french cuisine.  The dish was really good but there were just SOOO many beans!  I tried a couple of pieces of my friend's filet mignon and I thought it was alright.  It seemed like they could have added more seasoning because it was somewhat bland.  My friend asked if she could get A1 sauce and our server looked pretty insulted LOLL.  I didn't think a restaurant like that would have it.  I really didn't think it was a good idea either but a part of me wanted to see our server's reaction.

Both came off better than average but not as good as for example at Le Central or even the St Francis or the late Old Poodle Dog on Bush.\n\nI sympathize that they are too successful for the small space but it borders on communal tables if there are only 3 inches of space between tables. \nThe long panel of mirrors on the walls gives an illusion of space but it only makes unpleasant eye contact with other diners.\n\nOne one side we had an obnoxious male that talked about himself.

Jesus himself could have asked me to Chapeau, and I'd have declined.  My word is good.  \n \nIt was worth the wait, though, to be treated to such a fantastic dinner in such a beautiful setting w/ a witty and exqiusitely dressed dinner date in a dark pinstriped suit and gorgeous tie, amazing food, and lots of presents, too.  :-)\n \nThere's virtually nothing I can add to the reviews this place already has -  but then again, I can't shut up about the food either, so here goes.\n \nWell, I do kind of have a \"tip\".\nArchie was waiting outside for me and on the phone w/ me trying to convince me to illegally park in front of the restaurant.  It seemed PERFECTLY clear to me that the paint on the ground signified nobody was to park there, but he was insistent, so I was attempting to, when the owner came outside and told me to park where the bus stop was - as from 8 pm - 4 am, he said it was legal parking.  I have no idea if it was true, but I didn't get a ticket and my car was still there, so take that for what it's worth.  (Never let it be said I am not helpful.)\n \nThen the chef greeted us, as friendly and warm as can be.\n \nThere began a wonderful night at Chapeau!\n \nUpon entering - - I am not sure why the big black velvet curtain is there, but once you figure out how that thing opens, and assuming you don't crash right into someone who is coming out - - you're in the middle of the restaurant.  Initially, we were seated at a 2 person table in between two other \"2-person\" tables - - but within a minute, the waiter informed us that they'd be moving us to a corner table.  I'm not sure how this came to be, but we're seated on minute and the next, the waiter is whispering this to Archie.  Interesting.  This corner table, however, was the best seat in the house -  in its own little nook by the window, and everything was very private and intimate, and I don't know about Archie's chair but my little bench had nice cushions, too.  If you make reservations, try and get THAT table!\n \nThe waiter, as well as the owner and his wife, were always smiles and always accomodating.  Every single server who attended to us was so polite and helpful, I don't think we ever asked for one thing.  The wine was corked immediately, and the water was always filled - the food was  timed perfectly, and the options they gave us were perhaps exactly what we would have requested if they didn't offer first.  Everyone always smiled at your if your eyes should meet, and many times, they came to verify that we were enjoying our meal.\n \nBut most importantly - -  the highlight was THE FOOD.\n \nThe amuse bouche of the evening - - cauliflower soup w/ curry:  EXCELLENT.\nThe bread:  SUPERB and warm.  OUTSTANDING.\nThe seared foie gras special of the evening:  HEAVEN MELTING IN YOUR MOUTH.\nThe Trio of Salmon appetizer:  FRESH, DELICATE EXPLOSION OF FLAVORS.\nThe Tasting Fish they offered was SCALLOPS w/ gnocchi on this night:  PERFECT.\nThe Lamb Shoulder w/ beans:  TENDER and FLAVORFUL.\nThe Lamb Shank w/  couscous:  HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, falling off the bone and if I get reborn as meat, I wanna be IT.\nThe Apple Torte thing for dessert w/ ice cream:  OMG.\nBut the Chocolate Cake that EXPLODED at our table with melting chocolate just OOOOZING out w/ rum raisin ice cream..... I mean, COME ON!!!!!  The expressions on our faces when that cake just POPPED open was hilarious.\n \nOne bottle of good wine and a glass each of Macallan 18 on the rocks (that Archie bought for me, and Chapeau allowed us to drink by bringing us wine glasses and ice - they do not serve hard alcohol here, FYI) -  we left, stuffed to the gills, toasty as can be, and off for more adventures in SF.\n \nWhat a romantic, spectacular and outstanding dinner this was... I really couldn't have enjoyed it more.  Everything was PERFECT.\n \nThank you so much for the dinner, and the gifts....  I cracked up at the card again this morning.  \nYou looked very handsome, Sir Starchie!", "author": "Grace K."}

Each wait staff knows the menu inside and out, and the chef and co-owner would make it a point to talk with each patron.  \n\nThe food is simply unforgettable!  It's so tasty it washes away your deepest gloom.  I ordered a pork dish...and honestly, I haven't tasted anything so simple, so pure, yet so delightful.  The pork was great and the presentation was heavenly but the polenta...blows me away!

When we walked in, the place is small and tight. The decor was very plain and basic and the patrons were a good mix of people. I saw a bachelorette party, a birthday party, a family with two small children and a few old couples having a nice meal but it was packed from front to back. Felt like a nice place for comfort food BUT...I would have liked it more if it was fancier? For the amount we paid for the meal, i thought the decor was blah...not very romantic..However, food was good, wait staff was typical french (please take that bottled water off the table or pour it into a glass).

I usually never comment on service, but they were so helpful, polite, and attentive that I had to mention it.  Took my friend here for her bday..we shared a 3 course & 4 course meal.  The only difference between the 3 & 4 course is the \"tasting fish,\" which that night was scallop on risotto over lobster bisque.  (which is very delish, by the way.  I loved the various flavors the dish offered. It was because of this dish that we had one person order the 4 course meal so we could share it...great decision).\n\nAppetizers:\n1) Escargot: very strong garlic flavor.  Since we like garlic, we enjoyed this dish, but you really have to love garlic to like this dish b/c the flavor is so potent.  It was also served drier than I'm used to.  The escargot is soft, but it's not drenched in a puddle of butter like how other places serve it.  Eat this after other appetizers or else the garlic taste will alter the flavor of the other meals (the owner gave us this tip & even brought this out after the other dishes...see?  Great service)\n2) Foie Gras:  ORDER this b4 it's outlawed in CA.  Buttery, rich, dense goodness.  Warm & seared to perfection.  Served w/ toast.\n\nEntree:\n1) Mussels:  FAVORITE of the night.  Must order.  Mussels are juicy & fresh and the broth it sits in is delicious.  It's also served with fries, which taste good dipped in the 2 sauces it comes with or even in the broth (owner recommended that).  \n2) Duck breast: this dish was only ok.  Meat was tender, but I didn't care too much for the flavor...also, the flavor was a bit on the light side & almost bland.\n\nDessert:\n1) Nuage de Noix: Owner recommended this one and it was the favorite of the 2 desserts we tried. The texture is very crunchy & nutty.  The nuts are dispersed in an oval \"ice cream mold.\"  It's not quite ice cream, but it's very similar to it.  If you love nuts, you'll definitely like this dessert.\n2) Baked alaska: It was ok...a bit sweet for me, but I wish they burnt the marshmallow shell more...I like the outside layer to be more crisp & burnt, but this one was more gooey.", "author": "Christine V."}

I would highly recommend Chapeau to anyone who wants great French food at an unbeatable price, along with excellent service, relaxed atmosphere and uplifting ambiance.  \n\nThe early-bird prix fixe special (5-6 pm) is the deal, for $28 per person they serve you a faaabulous dinner composed of large portions of your choice of  appetizers, entrees and desserts prepared by very skilled cooks.  \n\nWhat impressed me most about Chapeau is the large portions of exquisite food they served.  I expected the food to be excellent here due to all the great reviews I read. However, when I've eaten at quality French restaurants in the past, the food was often good but the portions were tiny. Not so with Chapeau - - they don't hold back on the quality or the quantity. I can eat a lot when the food is as good as it is here, and I had trouble finishing the large portions they served.  This is a good thing.\n\nTip:  If you come on a weeknight 5:30ish for the special, you get another good deal: virtually free onstreet parking is unbelievably easy to find right on Clement near Chapeau (everyone is waiting until 6 pm to park so they don't have to feed the parking meters).  Park a few minutes before 6 to outsmart these tightwads, put 50 cents or so in the meter so it lasts a few minutes until 6, then leave it there as long as you want after 6 for free.", "author": "Jack H."}

It's easy - you can judge how good a restaurant is by their bread.  I've found that there is a direct correlation between a restaurant's bread and the rest of their food, and the bread at Chapeau! is GOOD.  \n\nI had the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon, but I also tried the fillet mignon, the salmon, and the baby chicken.  All were delicious!  My only minor complaints were that the place was a little small and crowded, and because of this, the atmosphere was noisy with chatter.  Also, be warned that the service is really good - a little too good.  It was almost a little awkward to have the waiter place the napkin on my lap and the chef came and greeted us all, but after the initial uber friendliness it was just really good service.  But my wife reminded me that all of this is not as important as how good the food tastes, and that's all that matters with Chapeau!

We arrived without reservations with the room at full capacity, but were greeted warmly by the gregarious owner and promptly seated. What this teeny tiny restaurant lacks in space is made up for by its decadent menu items and great service. My date and I decided to each order from Menu 1; I decided on the Warm Brie appetizer and Filet Mignon entree with Warm Chocolate Cake for dessert. \n\nThe melted Brie with crusty potato and leek darphin was presented on a bed of crisp, fresh salad. It was good, but the sauce was too sweet for my personal preference. However, the dish had great flavor and was generously portioned. My date's duck salad tasted wonderful, and he couldn't stop making provocative big-O faces and raving about it. The star of the night, however, was the Filet Mignon - the most tender pillow of beef drowning in a pool of the most amazing sauce. Even the tiny cubes of taters and mushies that accompanied the meat were scrumptious. The Warm Chocolate Cake that I chose to end my excellent meal with was incredibly mouth-watering and rich. It's really too bad that my dinner companion didn't absolutely love his Basil Napoleon as much as I enjoyed my dessert.\n\nAnd who could forget the adorable owner, who chats with all of the patrons and personally thanks everyone, even going as far as chasing you down the street just to say goodbye!\n\nUnfortunately, my date was very badly behaved that night and put a damper on my otherwise heavenly meal.

We stared at the menu and were pretty elated at what they had to offer. We ordered a bottle of wine for $37 and I thought that was a decent price. A bottle of champagne was 60+ and other wines (red and white) were rougly $40-50. \n\nThey started us off with freshly baked bread and it was toooo good. They gave us a sample of their asparagus soup and I wanted like 10 more cups considering the cup they gave it to us was smaller than an expresso cup.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nESCARGOT - Shelled and ready to go! Awesome! It was served ontop of scalloped potatoes and the flavor was just right.\n\nTRIO OF SALMON - Interesting. I didn't find 3 different types of prepared salmon in there but it was pretty good so I didn't complain.\n\nSWEETBREADS - I've never had sweetbreads before but if you think it's bread that's sweet, it's not. Haha. It's the thymus glands of some animal, I forget. The texture of sweetbreads compares to really really really soft chicken. This was paired off with a sauce that was pretty salty and mushrooms. I would order sweetbreads from here again.\n\nDUCK ENTREE - The fattiest duck I've ever had. We ordered it to be cooked at medium and there was so much fat on there I felt like I was going to chew forever. Two duck breasts sat ontop of mashed potatoes (which were good) and topped off with fruits: grapes, figs, pears. \n\nFILET MIGNON ENTREE - NO NO NO. I should have sent this plate back and have them recook it. We had it done medium since that's how I like most of my steaks cooked. In other words, I don't want it bloody. The first half of the filet mignon was pretty good, but the second half was mushy. MUSHY. It mushed around in my mouth and if you were to ask me, It didn't taste like beef. It was slightly disgusting and I was pretty disappointed. The potatoes and mushrooms that it came with on the other hand were delightful. I could go for a big bowl of that, but not the filet mignon. \n\nCREME BRULEE - THEY RAN OUT!!!?!?!??!?!?!?! I was SO sad. But they did have pumpkin creme brulee which we did try and that was interesting. We ended up just eating the sugared part on top, haha\n\nAPPLE CUSTARD TART THING - Served with hazelnut icecream, YUM! This was pretty good.

Mid-way through my 4-course dinner at Chapeau!, I made up my mind that I would give it a 4-star rating because the food was very good, the service was very good and the prices were decent for French food! \n\nAppetizers: \n- Pan-seared foie gras w/ puff pastry = incredibly tasty\n- Cream of corn soup w/ crab cake = creamy, soul-warming goodness\n\nEntrees:\n- Cassoulet de Toulouse w/ beans, sausage, and lamb shoulder = it was a hearty dish, came with lots of beans and was a good portion\n- Pan-seared Maple Leaf Farms duck breast w/ polenta, pears, and grapes = very delish! Again, they gave such a generous portion that I couldn't even finish it\n\nThen, I tasted our 3rd course - scallops with pesto risotto and lobster bisque sauce. IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY TASTY! So I gladly bumped 'em up another 1/2 star. =) \n\nOur final course, dessert, came and to our pleasant surprise, our waiter gave us an extra dessert dish for free! Another 1/2 star for you, Chapeau! So for dessert we tried the pistachio meringue (free), lemon tart, and creme brulee. The pistachio meringue was good, I didn't taste the lemon tart but my boyfriend said it was the most tart thing hes ever eaten, and the creme brulee was just okay. Next time, I have to try the chocolate cake. The table next to us ordered it and I had to stop myself from staring at their order. \n\nSo, 4 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 5, right? They lose a star, b/c I forgot that two of my utensils had stuck on food on them. A normal person probably wouldn't have noticed it, but I ALWAYS examine my food utensils. I'm pretty strict about cleanliness, and I would expect a fine restaurant like this one to have pristine spoons and knives.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-30", "description": "After reading the copious glowing reviews about Chapeau, I was ready to be wowed!  But unfortunately, the few things that were off, were significant.\n\nSo, in sum, for $150, we consumed a manic meal full of ups and downs.  While the \"flaw\" of averages gives this meal a 3 star rating, nothing is average about it.  \n\nMy lady's appetizer was the Salade Landaise with Frisee (fancy word for white colored field \"green?\" I guess it is a field white.  Duck Confit, Smoked duck magret (smoked duck sandwich meat slice), and fingerling potato chips, and french vinaigrette (not balsamic).\nIt was Excellent.  Crisp, fresh, immaculate, and a parcel of my Foie Gras appetizer was placed on top.  Nice touch.\n\nMy foie gras was pan seared, just a touch of crunch on the outside and all that yummy creaminess that foie gras should be on the inside.  Bravo.\n\nThe sweetbread (a.k.a. cow thymus, or other glands.  Neither sweet, nor bread! =P) was again a very solid dish.  My advice, don't get it if you get the foie gras.  Very similar creamy, rich animal organ texture that was already achieved better with the foie gras.  Also, the sauce on the sweetbread is the same as what is on the Filet Mignon.  Our waiter told us in hindsight.  Although excellent, I would have passed on the sweetbread, had I known.\n\nOur bi-polar meal turns for the worst when our two Filet Mignon entrees arrive.  While tender like a newborn, our medium rare medallions were pink on the inside, but BONE DRY.  Our jovial conversation begins to transform into various synonyms for SAW DUST.  The limited sauce on the plate didn't make up for the meat's sandiness.  I look over at a neighboring table's Filet Mignon: the gentleman's plate was just as arid.  Not a drop of juice, blood, sauce, anything, the filet was a sponge.\n\nWith 3 out of 3 steaks being dry, I was convinced that if I complained, nothing would change about the Filet Mignon.  I suspect (though I am not sure) that the meat was over-aged, leaving little blood inside to moisten the meat.\n\nTo quench the drought on my palette, the bordeaux wine I had was adequate.  But at $13 for a meager pour, I was hoping for better.\n\nThe desserts allow Chapeau! to redeem itself.  The thinly sliced french toast had the crust removed and is drizzled in a light, caramelly/mapley sauce that I can't quite identify, and the Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream on top was decadent.  The french toast barely had any egg yolk flavor and you could tell that a lot of care went into making this dessert.  \n\nMy chocolate cake (lava cake style) was very good, but Roy's has perfected that dish and Chapeau fell short of Roy.  But the Rum ice cream paired with it was something special; as rich as it could be, and as full of Rum flavor as ice cream can hold.\n\nLike everyone says, the chef is a wonderful host and kisses my significant other on the cheeks on her way out.\n\nAll in all, bi-polar gastronomy gets the belly full, and gives the emotional centers of our brains a roller coaster ride.", "author": "Gersey C."}

We tried the onion soup, escargot, skate, bouillabaisse, ratatouille and the chocolate cake. All very well done and very authentic French cuisine. The owner is quite a character and greets everyone as they arrive which we thought was a nice touch. The only reason I knocked off a star was because the service upon arrival was not great. I made a 7:45 reservation and still had to wait almost 20min to be seated. There's also not a big space indoors to wait and it was quite chilly outside so I was getting impatient and cold! Once we were seated, it took another 15minutes to get our drinks. I get it, it's busy on a Saturday night but it got a little ridiculous.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-29", "description": "What a great experience Chapeau! was.  On a whim, my lovely girlfriend decided to surprise me with dinner here at a delicious French restaurant located far out from where I'd expect a French restaurant to be in SF.  \n\nMy salmon trio appetizer had very tasty and tender pieces of salmon tartare, smoked salmon, and salmon roe.  I recommend this, as we heard later on that they ran out.  I've had plenty of salmon tartare and smoked salmon before, but there was something about the consistency of Chapeau!'s that made it pretty amazing.\n\nFor my main, that I have to note took unusually long to bring out (45 minutes), I went with the duck that was cooked beautifully, extremely tender, and came with a perfect sauce.  My girlfriend's steak was also cooked perfectly, though the outside was more medium than medium rare.  It made up for it once you hit the center though.\n\nLastly, I went with the sorbet trio and she had the creme brulee.  While it's a typical looking vanilla creme brulee that was obviously refrigerated, it made no difference in the epic taste.  I highly recommend this if you're a fan of vanilla as it's pretty much an explosion of rich vanilla flavor in your mouth.  I definitely had dessert envy as my sorbet of blackberry, tangerine, and key lime were good, but less satisfying.  \n\nChef Philippe had a very nice and personal touch by shaking the hand of every one of his customers during and after dinner.  I can't remember the last time anyone did that at a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\nWhile I'm a huge fan, the 45 minute wait for the main course really is the only thing docking Chapeau! from a 5 star rating.  They kept our (delicious) bread basket full and our cups of water refilled but never really gave an explanation for the slow down when we saw other tables get their main course.  This, as I explained earlier, did not affect the taste of the main course however as the quality overall was excellent.  The only other thing I can dock Chapeau! for is the fact that we sit awfully close to the other patrons such that we could hear their conversations and they could hear ours.", "author": "Jeff N."}

The scallop dish was DELICIOUS though. 3 big scallops on top of some risotto, lobster bisque, and a cheese crisp. I cleaned my plate so fast. It was really, really good. The dessert was good too, but didn't really stand out. Everything on their dessert list is very standard, IMO. Boyfriend got the baked Alaska. Presentation is great, but not a fan of it. \n\nHis mom had the cassoulet. Don't think she really enjoyed it. She said there were too many beans at the bottom. Boyfriend had the filet mignon, medium rare. Was tender but nothing wow. I'm not a steak lover though.  \n\nService is good, literally didn't notice them refilling my water. Environment is pretty loose and loud. They were very helpful when making the reservation. However I did request that a warm chocolate cake be brought out for his birthday but they forgot.

The oyster mushrooms were so good that hub couldn't stop talking about it.  It was our very first time trying bone marrow and the verdict is that neither of us like it.

For $40 I had the half dozen Washington oysters on the half shell (fresh as can be!), the rabbit and duck cassoulet (rich, savory and flavorful but not overly rich...the rabbit was a hare dry -pun intended), and ended with the lemon tart.

Perfect amounts of each dish and outstanding service.  The staff, including the owner, gave you just enough attention and friendly \"hellos\" to be nice but not make you feel like they were kissing your ass.  \n\nThe only reason it got 4 stars is because we were told they were full for reservations but we could do a walk in.

I hadn't been to Chapeau! since it first opened about 10 years ago.  The purpose of my return visit was the cassoulet and the cassoulet alone.  It didn't disappoint.  But in all honesty, the other items that the group ordered easily equalled if not beat the cassoulet's splendor: an appetizer of brie w/ fingerling potato, a goat cheese appetizer, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, and a scallop risotto in lobster bisque.  \n\nSo as a tip, don't try and do the cassoulet alone.  It's a noble battle.  A righteous battle, even.  But not a battle for which you're ever going to look in the mirror the next day and feel good about yourself.  Do yourself a favor and find someone to split it with and share another entree.\n\nTotal tab including tax and tip: $250ish for four with 2 appetizers, 2 desserts, and 2 bottles of wine.

The chef brought the near-finished product to our table to show us the 2+ pounds of deliciousness. Then, he whisked it aside to a cutting table where he cut and plated the dishes in front of us. It was fun to watch but MORE fun to eat. \n\nAs an added touch, they also served the bone marrow (still inside the bone-- you use a special spoon to scoop out the fatty marrow... I admit, this was a little overwhelming for me!). We were surprised (in a pleasant way) by the very bold flavors in the Roquefort sauce. The black truffle/ pepper sauce was more subtle but just as delicious. \n\nThe special comes with the gratin and chard on the side (more than enough for two people). We had a nice, slow meal progressing from the smoked trout amuse-bouche to the trio of salmon appetizer to the cote de beouf to the profiteroles! Perfection!! \n\nUNASSUMING LOCALE: \nChapeau! is a simple yet elegant neighborhood restaurant in the RICHMOND! It is cozy and unpretentious. I mean, it's in the Richmond... not the Mission, not Downtown, but the RICHMOND... just down the street from truly dirt-cheap Chinese diners. The atmosphere was conducive for hubby and me to start chatting up the staff and other diners. I loved it!\n\nAWESOME STAFF: \nThe owner/chef Philippe is hands-on to say the least; he greeted everyone in the house, helped out with diners' drink choices, etc., etc... The super-attentive waiters even learned it was my birthday, informed Philippe, and treated us to complimentary profiteroles! \n\nAt the end of the evening, Philippe sent us off with a handshake/ double cheek-kiss.

The duck was tender and melted into your mouth. However, the trout was a little too salty for me.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the striped bass and scallops.  The striped bass wasn't cooked evenly with parts being perfect and others overlooked. The scallops, on the other hand, was spot on. It was cooked nice and tender, and the risotto complemented it very well.\n\nAs for the dessert, we had a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and a baked Alaskan.  The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is pretty standard and yummy. And the baked Alaskan is a coffee ice cream with a rum cake on the bottom.

I got the salmon trio, the seafood bouillabaisse, and the lemon tart. My friend had the sweet breads, the fish (bass?)/oxtail and french toast for dessert. In short, we thought the food just okay but none of the dishes Wow!'d either one of us. My bouillabaisse was seriously salty and became inedible after a while. The service was friendly but simply put, for the price, there are better French restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant also has the patrons' tables crammed so close together that you can literally reach over to your neighbor's table and hear their conversations. \n\nFor two people, the bill without tax and tip came to about $130.

There were tables throughout the restaurant and then tables along the walls w/ bench seatings (the wall side).  It's not a big restaurant, but I think it's a decent size for San Francisco.  \n\nWe made reservations weeks in advance, and even though we were late, they were still very accommodating.\n\nAs usual, the head chef/owner came out to greet us.  I was able to brush up on some French, so that made my day :)\n\nFood:  We ordered from the pre-fixe menu.  We had an option of getting 3 or 4 courses.  The prices were very reasonable for SF and for a great French restaurant!  I got the salad special (smoked trout, I recall) and it was delicious.  For entree, I ordered the cassoulet.  It was okay (prevented me from giving this restaurant 5/5 stars).  Friends who got the other dishes loved theirs.  For dessert, I got the chocolate cake and it was so rich and delicious!  \n\nWine was reasonable.  There were bottles in the $35 range.  You can bring in your own bottle for a $18/bottle cork fee.\n\nAttire:  We were a little bit more dressed up, but we saw people come dressed in jeans.\n\nI loved the dining experience because it wasn't rushed.

I'll just give it a shot anyhow. Chapeau! (Or is it Clementine? I saw both names used interchangeably) is a cozy little French bistro along the more non-Chinesey section of Clement.\n\nDespite the three dollar signs, the prices for the food are not exorbitantly high, with entrees running in the low to mid $20's, and appetizers and desserts hovering around $10. These three can be had separately for $38 as part of the pre-fixe menu, so as long as you don't splurge on drinks, you can easily come out of here spending as little as the mid $20 to $40 range, perfect for non-alkies such as myself.\n\nChapeau! is somewhat on the smallish side, but about right to size to provide somewhat of an intimate environment. However, the seats do seem a bit too close together, and some may feel uncomfortable conversing at their normal volume at the risk of others being able to hear their every word. The favorite Yelper and I were fortunate enough to score seating right next to the pony wall leading to the kitchen, and even so, the couple next to us was so close, I felt like I was at the movie theatre on opening day. Too bad it was some dude sitting next to me.\n\nThe wait staff is polite and professional, as you would expect. However, not to sound superficial or anything, but many of them do not seem to match the type of restaurant. Our server was a cordial, middle aged Chinese gent, who although is a perfectly fine waiter, doesn't seem to fit in with the environs. I'm all for equal opportunity, but sometimes it is essential to look the part.\n\nThe food is decent, but not very memorable. As a matter of fact, I was only there a few weeks ago, and I have already forgotten what I had ordered. That about sums up my experience at Chapeau!", "author": "Eric W."}

S'il vous plait!]\n* Great value.  Not inexpensive, but a great meal for the price.  \n* Kitchen open 'til 10:30pm - great for after-event dining\n\nLows:\n* Cramped - but good for meeting your neighbors (and staring at their food)\n* Noisy - one table for 2 right inside the entrance looked like it might provide a slightly more intimate setting\n* I know this restaurant has been open for quite some time, but it had that still-working-out-the-kinks feeling. (See above regarding signage, lights).\n* Bathroom needs an upgrade.  Cool artsy mirror on the wall, but it would be more appropriate decor for a tapas restaurant in the Mission than an upscale French restaurant.  And the tinfoil covering the rusty (?) sink pipes?

We were able to incorporate the Ribeye for Two special as part of \"Menu 1\" for a small added cost.

Then it was hand sliced and divided on two plates, served with what looked like two dinosaur bones with marrow inside. The steak came with three different sauces and two servings of potatoes au gratin, one for each of us. I can typically put away plenty of red meat at the dinner table, but could hardly finish half of my portion, so that should tell you how large and in charge this dish was. I thought the ribeye could have been more tender if it were left \"unsliced,\" but it was still tasty. \n\nWe hardly had room for dessert but *sigh* first world problems *cough* since it came with our \"menus\", he ordered the French Toast with salted caramel ice cream and I ordered the lemon tart.

This place has just been named my fave French bistro!  \n\nWe walked into the place with no reservations on a Thursday night for two.  As I looked into the dining room, I noticed it was pretty full and I don't think that I'll be able to try this place tonight.  The lady was very nice and said that there will be a opening in a few minutes...so we waited at the bar for a drink.  Within minutes our table was ready and we were seated promptly.  The decor of the place was nice and felt a bit homey.  The chef came out and greeted us and thanked us for being there.  I was amazed by that yet to have him personally deliver EVERY dish we had...WOW!\n\nFood...\n\nThey started with a complimentary small cup of cauliflower soup with white truffle oil...it was amazing!  It made my palates scream for more!  The foie gras was rich but tasteful...this was probably the highlight of the meal besides the soup.  The scallop with risotto and escargots were also screamingly great.  The palate cleanser we had, the COLONEL, was very good with the infused vodka. The rare filet mignon was cooked to perfection.  The rabbit was mediocre...seemed dry and was not as tasteful as some other rabbit dishes I had tried.\n\n5 Stars for my favorite French bistro.", "author": "Patrick C."}

We decided, heck why not - let's do something fancy shmancy and the whole she-bang and throw ourselves in expensive French food to express our love for each other. What we got was a whole lot of French food and good service, minus the waiter with the thick French accent.\n\nThe hostess was nice enough to open the door for us when we entered, which was something unexpected, but nice. It was if she was waiting for us to come in and it was our cue to enter the restaurant.\n\nThe place is pretty small. The tables are microscopically close to each other, is that a French thing? I'm not sure.\n\nAnywhoo, the chef was nice enough to come out and greet everyone and shake hands before slaving away in the back, which I thought was nice and unique.\n\nWe decided on the prix fix menu which looked pretty good and decent priced.\n\nI ordered the tomato bisque with crab cake, the trio salmon and the tahitian vanille creme brulee.\n\nLet us begin!\n\ntomato bisque with crab cake - yummy bisque with just the right amount saltiness/spiciness and creaminess! the crab cake was delish especially in the middle of the bisque. the two combination was perfection.\n\ntrio salmon - for those of you who watch THE BEST THING I EVER ATE - CRUNCY, and ted allen's segment on the black bass with the crunchy outside and the moist fish inside... TA DAAA! I've found another incarnation of it, but with salmon! And instead of fish sauce/oil, there was some spinach puree, yellow tomatoes and sweet corn!! OMG SWEET CORN!  Perfecto along with the sweet yellow tomatoes. I was shocked when I bit into the salmon, and it was moist inside, and the top and bottom were CRUNCHY.. *crunchnomnomcrunchcrunch* \n\ncreme brulee - twas good! the top tasted like marshmallows, but a bit too sweet, but STILL it was really good!\n\noh and complimentary anchovy sticks! PLUS!\n\nService - Top notch! They kept coming back to refill the water and add more bread. The only thing that bothered me was the old French waiter who had a really thick French accent. Alright, I know... what could be more authentic than a French waiter serving you in a French Restaurant. BUTTTTT he seemed agitated that I and the table next to us couldn't understand what he was saying. As the other table said: \"Language of Love My Ass.\" \n\nAnd when one of the waiters handed us a dessert menu, even though we ordered dessert already, the old French guy looked like he was about to come after him with him an ax and chop his head off and quickly apologized for the menu distribution. Uhm.. CHILLL old French guy! It's just a menu, please don't fire him or punch him out. It was a simple mistake.\n\nBut all in all, minus scary old French man, I'll come back some day!", "author": "Tammy S."}

We went for my SO's birthday and we were lucky enough to get a last minute reservation because we were planning on going to Flour + Water but the wait was 1.5 hrs.\n\nThe ambiance and decor are ok, nothing spectacular however the food and service are superb.  The chef greeted all the tables and made everyone feel so welcome. He really made us feel special and you could see that he took pride in his food and his restaurant.  When we ordered a bottle of wine the chef presented our bottle and told a cute story about the history of the bottle of wine we chose.\n\nThere were 6 in our party so between all of us we ordered the 3-4 course pre fixes, 2-filets, and the cassoulet.  Our appetizers were, the sweet bread, mussels and frites, foie gras, escargo, salmon carpaccio, and the french onion soup - ALL FABULOUS but the foie gras and salmon carpaccio were my favs.\n\nThe 4 course dinner comes with a fish of the day dish, that day the dish happened to be a large sea scallop seared over pesto risotto - OMG it was the most delicious scallop and risotto I've ever had. I wanted more. In fact, I wish I could have swapped my main course for more seared scallops and risotto.\n\nThe steak was done well, the skate was yummy, I love the sauce it was in and the little gnocchis that accompanied it was perfectly done.  I ordered the duck, it was good but not memorable. Next time I go, I'll probably try another main dish.\n\nThe desserts were great but I was so full by the end that I could barely enjoy most of it. I had the chocolate cake, the creme brulee was ordered, as was the french toast and cheese plate.  The desserts were good.\n\nChapeu! has amazing service, the portion sizes are healthy, you won't leave hungry, and best of all it's all decently priced.  Where else can you get such a great 4 course pre fixe for $50!\n\nI enjoyed it very much, I just wish it wasn't all the way out in the Richmond.

Rob got the bacon wrapped pork...whoa. \n\nDessert: Profiteroles. By the time this came, I was so full, but I could NOT refuse this. Rob got a custard with fruit and a thin filo dough looking thing which was awesome too but I think my Profiteroles were heaven.\n\nAs far as price goes, Rob and I always play The Price is Right game.

Right of the bat I was greeted with a friendly handshake at the door, so I was tipped off that this would be unlike any other meal I've had on Clement Street. My Mom and I went there on an early Sunday evening and ultimately decided to go with the Early Bird Prix Fixe. My mom is one of my favorite dining partners as she too like the divide and conquer approach to dining so we can experience as many dishes as possible. We started with the escargot and trio of salmon. I found both to be well executed but neither lacked much flavor punch for me. That was alright though since the next course had plenty of amazing flavors! The skate was superb, served deboned (the last restaurant I went to in NYC made us take out the bones - awkward) with a sauce grenobloise, which I assume means delicious green sauce in French! I ordered the duck break which was also super fantastic, especially with the truffled polenta. \n\n[Ugh, I really wish I had gone to Chapeau for Sunday dinner tonight instead of eating crappy Chinese food. Okay, less whining more Yelping...]\n\nFor me, the favors of the desserts we shared were most memorable. The Nuage de Noix Pretty much blew my mind. It was so sweet, yet refreshing with a nice variety of textures. The experience was so great and new for me that there was zero guilt in eating it (which is how a great dessert should work, IMO)! The French toast was great too, with a hazelnut ice cream that softly melted into a tender French toast. It was a bit sweet for me towards the end but that's because the serving size was pretty generous and I refused to leave any bites behind. I tell you this though, because I think it'd be a shame to have two French toasts at the same table - definitely try as many desserts as you can as I am positive they'd all be amazing.\n\nGo out and treat yourself to a nice dinner at Chapeau!

All the servers are polite, with Philippe's wife acting as the manager. The waiters really do know what they are doing, and while I do not believe they have a designated sommelier, they do have a fine selection of wine. One of the best aspects of dinner here is that Philippe always comes out as customers are eating and goes to every table and greets them. He'll grab a glass and pour himself a glass and toast with you and chat for a bit. This fun, friendly, and warm environment just cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nNow, finally onto the food. I entirely understand why foie gras was banned in the city, but I still lament it somewhat because the foie gras at Chapeau! was outstanding. The other dishes here, and I am fairly sure I have tried nearly all of them over the years, are fantastic. I won't go into detail, but I do recommend that at the end of dinner, you try the trio of sorbet. Distinct, fruity, and crisp, these sorbets are wonderful for clearing and cleansing after a rich dinner.\n\nChapeau! is handsdown my favorite restaurant in the city. I come here usually for special occasions, and every time, I am more than satisfied with the food, the service, and the atmosphere. A truly wonderful gem of a restaurant with an awesome staff.\n\nPS Parking here is far easier than other high end restaurants in the city. It's much more convenient to eat here than Downtown or in PacHeights or anywhere else. So that's always a nice plus.", "author": "Kellie L."}

I've been here twice and I absolutely loved it both times. My first visit was when they were at their old location. It took about a week or so before we were able to get reservations and ended up getting it for 5pm for a party of 4. It was probably because their old location was a lot smaller than their current. I don't remember what we had but I know the experience was great. Chef Phillipe came out and talked to each table, making you feel like a very valued guest and also like a regular! \n\nAfter my first visit, I knew I wanted to come back for a celebratory dinner or something. I drove by their old location and noticed it was closed.... I was so so sooooo sad. Then one day while I was walking on Clement, viola! Chapeau! had simply moved!!! \n\nMy bf and I came here to celebrate my new job a couple months ago.  I believe we had reservations for 8pm. Upon entering, Phillipe was there to greet us and promptly seated us. It didn't take long for our server to come and greet us. We settled for their prix fixed menu (again I don't remember what we had). Our server was attentive, the ambiance was great and everything was just perfect. \n\nWhen it got a little less busy, Phillipe came over to our table for a quick chat. He asked us how our meal was and had a conversation like we have been friends for years. As we continued eating, I watched the other guests leave (I was facing the door) and as they all left, Phillipe said goodbye with a handshake and a European kiss. There was a point in time when he was busy doing something so he wasn't able to say thank you and goodbye to a party that was on their way on so he (are you reading this??) RAN OUTSIDE to look for them to say goodbye and thank you!!! I mean who else does that?? None other than Phillipe himself! \n\nI felt like a regular here and I know I will definitely be back because of that and their great food.", "author": "Eugenia G."}

I wonder if there is a restaurant in France called \"Hat!\"\n\nThe wifey and I hit this pace on a Sunday evening.  We made reservations for 8:30, but got there real early.  Around 7:30 or so.  We asked the hostess if we could be seated early and she accommodated us with no problem.  Outstanding.\n\nThe place was crowded and lively, which is usually a good sign.  We had a nice end table.  It's a little smaller than I thought, but it was cool.  Also, if you were driving down Clement St., you could easily pass by without even noticing it was there.  \n\nOur waiter was very informative and made some thoughtful suggestions.  The wait staff was excellent and our water glasses were filled consistently.\n\nWe opted to buy a bottle of wine with dinner, which was - as always - the best way to a good review.  The wine was the waiter's recommendation.  I was a little concerned as the bottle was a \"twist off.\"  But, then again, I am no sommelier, so it was good.  I did not sniff the cap.\n\nWe both opted for the prix fixe $38 three course meal.  Great value.\n\nFor an app, I chose the duck foie gras and my wife chose the mesclun salad.  Both were excellent.  It was the first time I had foie gras.  Though, not wanting to be viewed as a \"rookie,\" I declared, \"This foie gras is the best I've had!\"  Which, basically was true.  It was the only foie gras I've had.  We both had the pork tenderloin for an entree, which was outstanding.  Very, very good.\n\nNow for dessert.  We selected the Baked Alaska and the Chocolate souffle.  Pure insanity.  Excuse me whilst my mouth unabashedly waters for a moment...or two.  Okay, that was nice.  Thank you.\n\nExcellent food.  Excellent price value.  Great experience.  We would definitely come here again.\n\nOn a side note - We had taken a taxi here from the Wharf.  We had the staff call us a taxi for the ride back.  There was some controversy.  A taxi arrived. Another couple tried to procure said taxi and were rebuffed immediately.  Note - Do not try to \"Taxi Poach.\"", "author": "Alan A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-12-05", "description": "Absolutely my favorite french restaurant in SF. I have been here probably 10 or more times since it was at the smaller location down the street. It has been a lot easier to get a table and overall just a nicer dining experience since they moved. For those that haven't been to the original location, it was about 5 tables crammed next to each other and you can hear the conversation at every other table.\n\nThe food here was also better before the foie gras ban. The Salade Landaise would come with a big chunk of perfectly seared piece on top. The foie gras they used to use was top notch also, it was either better quality or more expertly prepared than other restaurants.\n\nThe free bread here is amazing, as good if not better than any artisan bread you will find in the city. The butter is also good. It is very hard for me to not fill up on bread, but I've come to limit myself to 2 or 3 pieces. If I find myself asking for a extra basket of bread before the appetizer comes out, I've learned to cut myself off at that point.\n\nAs far as appetizers and entrees go, I actually can't go too much into depth on everything on the menu because I've always pretty much gotten the same exact thing: salade landaise (duck salad) and fillet mignon medium rare with bone marrow (the bone marrow is a recent addition to their menu). The salad comes with delicious shredded duck confit with slices of smoked duck on top of what can only be described as a brambly greens with a beautiful light vinaigrette. The filet has the most amazing king trumpet and oyster mushrooms and potatoes covered in a delicious wine and butter sauce. The bone marrow is nothing to write home about as there isn't usually a substantial amount of the marrow matter to spread on bread but if you scoop the hot oil out of the marrow onto the plate, it adds an additional dimension to the sauce. A perfect bite of filet with the sauce followed by a bite of the potato mixed with the mushrooms is divine. After the entree is finished, I am not above soaking up the left over sauce/marrow leftover with that excellent bread until my plate is cleaned.\n\nI've tried most of the items on the desert menu but always go back to the chocolate cake with rum raise ice cream. A little too sweet sometimes but satisfying nonetheless. I would avoid that basil soup however, it doesn't taste that special and left me wishing for molten chocolate goodness. \n\nThe prices here are also very reasonable. If you end up getting the filet, it is $6 dollars in addition to the 3 course menu price of about $40 and the salad is 2 or 3 dollars in addition as well. The marrow will run you another 5. So if you add a couple of glasses of wine to your tab, you can usually get out of the place for about 150 bucks for a party of two, which is amazing considering the qualify of food you are getting. I highly recommend this place for anything from a romantic night out to a casual dinner with friends (the ambiance is good for both, but on the louder side). Chef Phillipe will usually walk around the tables sharing glasses of wine with the customers and if you bring a pretty girl, he will most likely kiss her as you guys are leaving. Hey, for food this good, he can cop a quick feel too for all i care ;-)", "author": "Bin Z."}

Thirty minutes and a two drinks later....we finally get seated.\n\nMy boyfriend and I both decided to try the 4 course menu for $46 which includes an appetizer, flying fish, entree, and dessert. \n\nHere's a quick run through of what we had:\n\nAppetizers:\nFrench Onion Soup - So delicious! It definitely hit the spot and satisfied my French onion soup craving.\n \nSeared Ahi Tuna Nicoise Salad - 3 pieces of seared Ahi Tuna on a bed of salad, potato fingerlings, anchovies, and a quail egg on the side. Very light and refreshing!\n\nFoie gras - This is a special appetizer, but I have a feeling they have this special all the time since so many Yelpers talk about it. The foie gras was my favorite of the night! It was perfectly seared and plated on top of a soft piece of white toast. The Asian pear on the side complemented the foie gras perfectly!\n\nFlying fish: \nThis is a seafood special that changes daily. We had scallop over risotto with sauce. It was good, but nothing amazing. \n\nEntree: \nRosemary Baby Chicken - The chicken was cut into 4 pieces (2 legs and 2 breasts). It was tender and lightly seasoned but nothing spectacular.\n\nSkate Fish (related to the sting ray) - really soft and prepared over a sauce. I don't remember the taste of the fish too much since it was my boyfriend's dish, but he seemed to enjoy it. \n\nDessert:\nBaked Alaska - I usually love this dessert, but it was way too sweet and the flavor of the rum was really strong. \n\nFrench Toast - Can't go wrong with French toast! It was warm and drizzled with buttery cream sauce and had a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  \n\nThe waiters are really nice and my water glass was constantly refilled. The service can be a bit faster...be prepared to spend at least 2.5 hours here! The restaurant is a little stuffy and the tables are placed too close together. I couldn't help listening in on our neighbor's conversations. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the food and was pleased with my experience at Chapeau!

I decided to have a glass of Chardonnay ( don't remember what kind but it was recommended by the bartender ). Once the rest of our party arrived we were quickly seated. As we mulled over the menu not many things popped out at me. We decided to follow the DAT menu that they were offering and for starters I got the Mesculun salad. This salad had just the right amount of greens, fried cheese, pistachios and dressing. the others in my party got the trout salad and  french onion soup. I tasted both and they were also very good. \n\nFor entrees two of us got the rosemary and lavender chicken over a bed of greens and topped with a jumbo prawn. The other person got the Pork loin I believe with mashed potatoes and spinach. Although the serving size was small (it's a french restaurant!) the food was absolutely amazing. I never wanted it to end.\n\nFor dessert two of us had the creme brulee and the other profiteroles. The only complaint we had was that the profiteroles were just too chocolatey ( If thats even possible).\n\nAlso during the meal they brought us out a free appetizer which was almost like an eggplant bruschetta that was extremely tasty.\n\nWe also ordered a half order of their mussels. The broth was good but just not as good as others i have had. This was why I gave the restaurant 4.5 stars instead of 5.\n\nAlready have reservations made to come back again in the next few weeks.

And it was worth it!\n\nThe moment we arrived, we were greeted by who I believe is the owner.  He immediately showed us to our table.  They brought out the waters and as we browsed the menus, our waiter rattled off the specials.  We already had a pretty good idea of what we wanted, so we put in our orders right away.  My boyfriend got the early bird 3-course menu (if you order between 3 and 6 PM I think) consisting of cauliflower soup, bacon-wrapped tenderloin, and the creme brulee.

Our soups came out, which were both delicious!!  His cauliflower soup was light and creamy at the same time, and my onion soup sweet and had generous amounts of cheese and bread.  Our entrees were also amazing.  My filet was cooked exactly medium rare, which is not always the case when eating steak at a restaurant.

It took a while for our appetizer foie gras to come out but i guess it's coz we were there at peak hour on a saturday night. \n\nthey gave us each a small cup of cauliflower soup, which was AMAZING...now i wanna know how to make it!\n\nNot a fan of the foie gras, prolly coz I don't enjoy fatty texture, my bf liked it though. for entree we ordered the pork tenderloin and filet mignon. The tenderloin is amazing...i really liked the pureed parsnip sauce and the mashed potatoes...the mushrooms and whatnot on the filet mignon was good too...\n\nwe had sorbet for dessert and it was decent...usually i'd go for the more indulgent desserts like chocolate or creme brulee but that night i wanted something light.\n\nGood food but I probably won't come back any time soon just because there are so many more good restaurants in the city that I haven't tried!", "author": "Jenny C."}

Please come here!\n\nMy boyfriend and I made this our \"fancy\" dinner when we visited the City (disclaimer:  I am from the City and on a budget).  I used to live near Chapeau! before I moved to AK.  The BF lived in Geneva and is fluent in French food. I am a snobby San Franciscan (at least by Alaska standards).\n\nI gave my BF the hometown grand tour.  Focused on burritos, pumpkin curry, Indian pizza, and noodles.  Decided to do French on our last night without breaking the bank.\n\nIn a nutshell:  We loved Chapeau!  We had reservations at 6:00.  We were late (held hostage on MUNI, of course) and the restaurant gave us a call to ask if we were still coming.  After I uttered, \"We're on MUNI.  Sorry!\", they lady on the phone understood.\n\nWe arrived within 15 minutes of our \"late-bird call\"and were seated immediately.  Honestly, from the moment we stepped in the door, we felt comfortable.  The maitre'd was friendly and professional.  He chatted with us and helped guide our dinner selections.  When he found out we were from AK and that we fished halibut, he mentioned the halibut on the menu, but guided us away from it (yes, we were looking for something different).\n\nThe chef/owner came out and chatted for a bit.  So nice that he was there, passionate about his restaurant, and accessible to his customers.\n\nAll I can say is, I hold Chapeau! in high regards.", "author": "Kate A."}

I was the first to arrive, and honestly I was a bit confused and wasn't sure if i was at the right location. Immediately a waitress approached me to give me some info. My original plan was to walk around and come back later, but that plan was quickly dashed when the owner gave me a warm handshake. Next thing I know, I was sipping wine at the bar!\n\nWe had the prix fixed meal for $38. Quite affordable for a 3-course meal with appetizer, entree and dessert. Our waiter was very friendly and had a very good knowledge about the wine we selected.\n\nI had the Trio of Salmon for appetizer. It was a good blend of texture and taste, but it could have used a little bit more flavor. I dribbled sauce from my friend's oyster, and it made the dish taste better, in my opinion.\n\nFor the entree, I had the Duck Breast. This was very delicious and cooked to perfection. The meat was tender. The pears and grapes that came with the breast added a sweetness to the dish and was quite flavorful.\n\nAnd for dessert, the French Toast with Hazelnut Ice Cream was to die for! Hazelnut has always been one of my favorites, but combine that with warm french toast and soft caramel, it was like a party! After eating half, I was so full and swear my stomach was going to explode, but it was too good to not finish!\n\nWe also had anchovy sticks for free and that was quite delicious as well.

It was a late dinner on a Saturday night, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with how our experience unfolded.\n\nWe were seated at our table and ended up waiting almost 20 minute before our waiter came to us.  He was very nice when he did come to talk to us throughout the night, but it was sporadic, he was definitely frazzled and rushed, and it just made us feel frazzled and rushed too.  He ran around the room frantically and it just made us anxious as well.\n\nWe did the 3 course meal.  I started with the duck salad and the boyfriend got the special appetizer of the day, seared scallops.  The duck salad and the scallops were actually pretty good and we had high hopes for the meal.  We then waited about 20 minutes after we finished our appetizer for our entree to come.  I ordered the duck breast (yes, I love duck) and the boyfriend had the cassoulet.  The duck breast was supposed to be medium rare.  The waiter made a big deal asking me if I would be ok with medium rare and I said \"that's perfect, that's how I like it.\"  My duck came out medium well.  When I tried to get his attention to tell him it was overcooked, he never looked at me, and by then I was hungry and tired so I just ate because I was getting tired of trying to get his attention.  The cassoulet wasn't that great either.  It seemed a bit dry.  The boyfriend and I have gone to a lot of french restaurants in various cities, and this was probably the less appetizing cassoluet we've had.  We were not impressed (insert picture of Mckayla Maroney not impressed).  We ended our meal with the french toast dessert.  By the end of the night it was one of the few desserts left and it was the only thing that seemed interesting.  Regretful.  The french toast was not good.  It tasted like a piece of french bread that was slightly grilled, dropped in caramel sauce and a hazlenut ice cream scoop on top.  The ice cream was icy too, I had chunks of ice in my ice cream.\n\nThe one thing I did appreciate about this place was the 1/2 glass of wine offer instead of the full glass of wine.  It allowed me to do a mini pairing rather than a full pairing.\n\nOverall though, I was really disappointed by this meal.  We had high hopes and had heard great things from others.  Maybe it was an off night, who knows...but I was not impressed.", "author": "Quynh-An P."}

Food and service were nearly flawless.\n\nCons: A little bit cramped and noisy, but to be expected for a popular restaurant at 8pm on a Friday night.\n\nThe Details:\n\nMy girlfriend and I were seated as soon as we arrived for our 7:45pm reservation, our coats were checked, and we were quickly greeted by the waiter offering us water and cocktails.  The wine by the glass selection was a little small, but they do conveniently offer half glasses if you're not much of a drinker.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu, which was pretty reasonable at $40 for 3 courses and $49 if you want to add the tasting fish (my gf did).  Bread was fresh, hot, and crusty, and we received amuse-bouche of cauliflower soup which was creamy, delicious, and an unexpected surprise.  My onion soup appetizer was excellent.  The onions were sweet and soft and the gruyere wasn't an overwhelming obstacle on top of the cup but rather the perfect amount.  My girlfriend's salad nicoise was also very good, the ahi was a little too peppery, but the quail egg and perfectly cooked potatoes made up for it.  The tasting fish came next, which was a large seared scallop served over basil pesto risotto with lobster sauce.  This was the best thing I ate all night, a perfectly cooked scallop, the flavors complimented each other so well, really an outstanding preparation.  For the main course I had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin served on top of whipped parsnip and baked apple slices with shaved brussel sprouts and an apple and brown sugar sauce.  The sweetness of the apple went well with the salty bacon and almost bitter parsnip.  I love pork tenderloin, and the dish did not disappoint.  The cassoulet was very hearty, served with duck confit, lamb shoulder, and pork sausage.  It was good, but with so much food it was a little too heavy, the only thing we didn't finish and wound up taking home.  Finally for desert I had the nuage de noix, some type of pistachio, almond, and hazelnut whipped piece of deliciousness, and my girlfriend had baked alaska.  Both were great, and the fact that even after so much food we were both able to clean our plates speaks volumes.  The service was impeccable throughout the whole night, my water glass was never empty, the busboys were very capable and attentive, and our server timed the courses well.  The head chef even made two rounds through the dining room during our meal, a very nice and appreciated gesture.  When all was said and done the tab came out to $72 each including tip, and in my opinion it was worth every penny.", "author": "Aaron H."}

Came here recently and it's a reminder that Clementine's was *Greater Than* Chapeau...It's an emotional thing :).\n\nAtmosphere\n\nThe place is packed both in the sense of customers and tables.  Standard fare small restaurant.  I was surprised even the bar seating requires a reservation now.  I understand the restaurant's need to pack as many tables as possible to meet demand.  But, how close is too close when you can grope the person next to you and unintentionally start a couple's groping match?\nThe entrance no longer opens on the bar side, but on the table side.  I point this out for frivolous memories (queue 'Memories' from Cats).\n\n\nFood/Drinks\n\nThe food was decent so let me attempt to qualify that.  Mussels were good and I really like the crisp--non-oily fries.  The escargots were too light--not much flavor.  I wanted heavy, old school escargots, with butter & lots of herbs--stuff that'll force 2 hours of cardio in the gym and made you wonder why you ate so much...\nMain dishes were pretty good but I guess I say that with the expectation that I would be having good food.  \n\n\nService\n\nService was impeccable, especially since I was a bit neurotic that night.  I think it's kinda funny how some of the waiters try to talk with a bad french accent, luckily we didn't have a waiter like that.  He was very good & friendly.

Unless we were too noisy, who knows?\n\nService was pretty nice.

The roe I didn't like, but it wasn't to my liking, I typically do not like roe.  Besides that the dish was good, everything edible and couldn't keep my friend from trying to steal my appetizer.\nEntree:  Bacon wrapped Pork Tenderloin - Bacon wrapped most things is delicious.  At the time this was first brought out, the lighting was dim and I could not see the one strip of bacon that wrapped the whole thing.  So I had a slightly crunchy surprise when I bit into it.  needless to say the sauce was very enticing and I kept wanting to dip bread into it to finish the whole plate.\nDessert: Tarte du jour: Lemon tart, just simply good, I wish I could have had the whole pie.

And we were seated in the worst table in the house, literally right outside of the kitchen, with a view of a mess of wires from the speaker system.  \n\nWhile we waited by the door for our table, the owner (chef) kept coming over to say, \"just two more minutes, it's not a long time.\"  We of course believed him.  Had he been honest with us about our expected wait time, we could have done something to pass the time.  This is a classy place and as such I would expect that the restaurant would be more accommodating in this type of situation. While we waited, a table was open in the bar area and seats were open at the bar. A glass of wine and a true apology would have gone a long way in turning the evening around for us. Instead, they threw in an extra dessert on top of the other decadent desserts that we ordered. It was a nice try to salvage the mess, but I will not be patronizing this place again.\n\nIn addition to the long wait time and bad seat, our waiter was way too busy.  So busy that I found myself pouring our own wine several times.  He caught me at the end of a pour a couple of times and asked \"oh you have it?\"  \n\nThis might have been an unusual experience, but I think it reveals a lot about their vision of service. It seems many of the reviews refer to the restaurant being packed full, and I suspect that the restaurant, which is small, is trying to do way too much volume. Perhaps this will be profitable in the short term (we still payed $160.00), but this is not a sustainable business strategy.", "author": "Hugo C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-07", "description": "This restaurant easily deserves 5 stars in my book.\n\nThe moment I entered the restaurant, the front seater (which may have possibly been the chef as well since I heard that he sometimes comes out to personally greet and shake the diner's hand), he shook my hand and welcomed me.  I had a reservation prior to coming so I was seated right away.\n\nIf you come with only 2 people, make sure you get the bar seating area.  It sounds worse than what it really is.  The bar seating is really an area to the side of the bar where the table only seats.  It's actually nicer in my opinion because it's there is more of a private area when in a party of 2.\n\nThe waiter for my table came shortly after I got settled in and got my drink order (water for me!) and came back quickly with water with a slice of lemon along with the menu.  I came early enough for the early bird special (before 6PM ??), it looks like they changed their menu around (like pricing) so I am not too sure on this but you should ask when you make your reservation (and do make a reservation if you plan to dine here).  \n\nThis place has 3 course specials (appetizer, main course, dessert) so I opted for that.  You can choose which appetizer, main course, and dessert so there is a fairly good sized selection to suit your own tastes.  I got the Salmon Trio (salmon tartare surrounded by raw salmon pieces, and then decorated with some salmon eggs) as an appetizer, the seared duck as a main course, and the napoleon for dessert.  The entire time, the waiter kept attending to my table and made sure we fully understood the menu which was very appreciated.  They also have a wine menu if you are interested in that.\n\nSoon after I put in my order, they came by with some french bread and butter.   That may be fairly standard for this type of restaurant, but they one upped others by also giving us a small taster of a random special they are working on.  I heard that some of these taste samplers get put on the menu.   The sampler was delicious!\n\nThe appetizer arrived first and it looked amazing!  You can tell from looking at this dish that the chef put a lot of effort into creating this dish as everything worked so well!  I will go further into this dish since it is easily one of my favorites here.  The salmon tartare tastes like tartare but with some lemon and what I think are chives mixed in.  This is surrounded by raw salmon pieces (like sashimi) to form a circle around the tartare.  Then the tartare is decorated with a light mayo like decoration and salmon eggs and places in various spots around the tartare along the mayo-like decoration.  Fried Capers were placed along the edges and garnished with some chive leaves.  Now I know some may be a big fan of capers, I am fairly indifferent to capers, but deep fried capers! WOW! that stuff is amazing!  Each ingredient in the dish complimented the rest that I cleaned out the dish (figured I'd save the dishwasher some time/effort haha).  But I am sure the other appetizers are great as well  but I highly recommend this one.\n\nThe duck was also exquisitely delicious!  I got the duck medium rare which left the duck crispy on the outside and soft, tender, and so succulent!  It had a good ratio of fat to meat and had a wonderful gravy sauce to go with it. \n\nI was pretty stuffed after the main course, but the dessert came shortly afterwards and even though my taste buds were already on overdrive from all of the great food, the dessert still registered on my taste buds and my taste buds and stomach agreed quite well with the dessert!  it was essentially some chopped fruit on top of banana pudding with a crepe wafer crisp.\n\nthe overall meal was so scrumptious and the experience was extremely pleasant.  I would highly recommend this restaurant!  5/5 stars for obviously reasons if you read this review!", "author": "Mike L."}

He offered us water while we contemplated on a bottle of wine we wanted, finally, we settled for a bottle of Riesling he recommended. At first, I was a little worried since everyone has a different liking when it comes to Riesling, but after my first taste, he was right! It was soo good, it wasnt too sweet either with a hint of dryness and crispiness to it! \n\nMy girlfriend and i looked over the menu, at first we planned on getting the prefix menu,but she wanted the bone marrow which comes with prime rib, a side of steam spinach, and 3 sauces (blue cheese, something, and black truffle). U couldn't have bone marrow with the prefix, so we went with that anyways for entree.\n\nAnchovies puff pastry (complimentary from the chef)-  D E L I C I O U S\n\nHalf dozen oysters - really fresh, but nothing special. Good oyster is good oyster\n\nSeared Foie gras with fuji apple? and brioche - in HEAVEN! :) My girl friend and I actually thought about ordering another order of this! LOL\n\nPrime rib with bone marrow, side of spinanch, and 3 sauces - I never had bone marrow before, and it was delicious. Our waiter actually suggested that we eat our bone marrow with bread and the blue cheese sauce that came with our prime rib! Oh the prime rib was cooked perfectly, a little red in the middle, just how i LIKE it :) i thought their prime rib was better than HOPR, and I LOVE HOPR!\n\nWe had the chocolate cake for dessert, and it was okay, ive had BETTER! \n\nBut other than that, I had a great experience, and am planning on taking my bf here! :)", "author": "linda L."}

It's the best restaurant experience I've had in awhile.\n\nAlthough, it didn't start out that way.....\n\nWhen we were seated we didn't get menus, and no one came over for quite awhile. They asked for our drink order right away, but we hadn't seen the wine list yet.\nWe were beginning to think it might  be European-style service.\nLuckily, we were wrong! I think there was a confusion of who our server was. Once we got one though, it was all good.After our order was taken, things moved along well.\n\nThe food was plated beautifully, and  had amazing flavors. Most of the dishes were outstanding.\n\nTo start ,I had the mussels and frites, (the small order.)\nThey were probably the best mussels and frites I've ever had. The aioli that came with them for dipping was a great addition to the dish too.\nBoth the mussels and frites were cooked perfectly. The flavors complimented each other well, and no one flavor was overwhelming.\n\nMy entree was also pretty good, not as incredible as some of our other dishes, but still very tasty. \nI had the salmon with tomatoes, and mashed potatoes. (It has a fancier name, but that's what it was.)\nOnce again, everything was cooked perfectly. The potatoes weren't overly creamy, which is a plus for me.\n\nFor dessert i had the fruit napoleon. It was good, but in no way was it a napoleon. (The woman next to me commented on this too.One of the servers even said, \"I don't know why he's calling it that.\")\nIt was more accurately, a \"deconstructed napoleon.\"\nIt consisted of: mango, pineapple, banana, strawberries, a little pastry cream, a few paper-thin pieces of  filo (I think) and a basil sauce.\nI wasn't sure what to make of it first, it was very different than anything I've ever had, and not what I was expecting. Although, after a few bites, I was sold. \nIt was the perfect ending to a near-perfect meal. It was light, and very refreshing.\n\nAfter the initial lag, the service was superb. Dishes were whisked away upon completion, and glasses were kept refilled.\n\nThe chef was great too. He came around to all the tables, shook hands, and thanked people for coming in. When we were leaving, he held the door for us, and even kissed my cheek! \nHe owns the place,does the cooking, and still makes time to meet his patrons. Pretty impressive, and not something you see very often.\n\nI loved this place, and will definitely be back. It may become our new restaurant to take visitors to.", "author": "Amanda G."}

It was my wife's birthday and she picked Chapeau as the place to have her Birthday dinner. As usual her choice was spot on for the special occasion. The thing is though, Chapeau is so well priced that it can be visited on a regular basis. \n\nT and I both had prix fixe dinners which at under 40 dollars each is an unbelievable value considering the quality of preparation and food you get. \n\nI had the sweetbreads appy and my better half enjoyed the foie. We switched dishes half way through and we both agreed that they were both scrumptious. I appreciated that the waiter was thoughtful enough to mention that the sauce for my sweetbreads and my main dish, the filet mignon, were similar. It was fine with me because both dishes were still distinct to my untrained taste buds. Did I mention that this was one of the best filet's I have ever enjoyed? I am not even a fan of filets since I always go for a ribeye, but this medium rare filet was so tender and tasty that I almost forgot that ribeyes are my fave. My wifey had the cassoulet which according to her was perfect since it had beans and she \"loves beans\". \n\nDessert was so special that it deserves it's own separate paragraph. The Birthday girl ordered the floating island which came with a sugar laced sculpture. Me, I had the french toast which, even though the name doesn't scream decadence at you, it was everything I ever want in a dessert. Crispy and melt in your mouth soft in the same bite.

Man.. if it wasn't for her and her 23d (and yelp of course) I would have never knew about this place! \n\nParking was the ONLY thing that wasn't perfect about this dining experience... and to be honest.. it wasn't even that bad. Took me 5 minutes! And of course.. me and my friends are never on time... but they called in and they pushed our reservation back half and hour to give us time to all get there... no questions asked!\n\nSo once all 10 of us arrived.. we were promptly seated and a very friendly waiter came to explain and translate everything on the menu. We all ended up getting our own three course meal with an appetizer, entree and dessert.  \n\nI, myself ordered a half dozen oysters for my appetizer, the Cassoulet de Toulouse for my entree, and the French Toast for dessert. We all tried to order different things so that we can sample each other's goodies. After we have all ordered and the server came to pour us our wine, the chef himself, Phillipe, came out to personally greet us! He was very friendly and even joked around with us... making the whole dinner and restaurant feel very warm and hospitable! DEFINITE PLUS!\n\nBefore our appetizers could come out, we were served toasty bread with butter, baked just right with the warm inside and crunchy outside: and it was refilled so often that it was hard to keep our hands off of it! Shortly after the bread, the appetizers came so  we then had a combo of oysters, the trio of salmon, traditional onion soup, and the Salade Landaise. Just to keep the review short.... everything was great, but the trio of salmon..... OMG! simply delicious! \n\nThen, onto the entrees, we recieved the Pan Seared Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast, Filet Mignon, a Salmon dish that I can't remember the name of (menu changes every so often) and my Cassoulet de Toulouse. \nMy favorite was my own dish, the Cassoulet! I'm not usually a fan of lamb, but the reviews raved about it! I just had to try it... and I was definitely not disappointed!!! I also enjoyed my friend's duck dish a lot as well! \n\nFINALLY!... dessert. The guy sitting in the table next to our party was a usual and he highly recommended that we tried the french toast. He did such a great job advertising it as he ate his that our whole table ended up ordering the same dessert! Dear God.... it was orgasmic! The french toast was sweet with a light syrup glazed over the toast... adorned with powdered sugar, accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely perfect! \n\nAfter our meal, our bill came to us in a hat which i though was adorable since \"chapeau\" literally means \"hat\" in french! We stayed to chat after a while with the chef and he even met us outside to take a picture with us, and to wish my friend a happy birthday! So NICE!!!\n\nThis place is definitely a place to check out whether you're in the area or not. It might sound a little bit pricey, but for what you're getting (a quality 3 course meal),  it's obviously worth it! I'll most certainly be back to try all the new things on the next menu.

My \"friend\"  :P took me here for the last Valentine's day and I was pleasantly surprised having never been here before. The only con of the night was that the place was packed so we were sitting extremely close to the couple next to us, felt like a double date. Other than that, the restaurant has a modest French bistro atmosphere with its dim lighting and tasteful decor.\n\nOur Dinner:\n- Duck pate on a crostini : Wonderful and mild pate flavor. It was one crostini so naturally I wanted more!\n- Foie Gras: The portion was generous. It was served on brioche with slices of apples. I prefer mine with a some sort of fruit reduction so their version lacked sauce for me; however, the foie gras was rich and delicious as always. \n-Skate Wing: I chose to stray from my norm and ordered fish ....WOW! BEST FISH I've ever had hands down. It's served in a brown butter sauce but there was a slight lemon taste that complemented the fish perfectly. The flaky, tender fish sat on a bed little bread croutons and potatoes. My favorite green salad, mache , also accompanied it. Ive  never had mache warm before but it worked with the dish/sauce. Decent portion too, not the usual tiny French portions!\n-Cassoulet de Toulouse: My boyfriend also chose to be different and chose this over the Filet Mignon (you can also add bone marrow and foie gras!!) and boy was he disappointed. The Filet Mignon dish accompanied by the bone marrow looked overwhelmingly delicious and huge! Ok, back to his dish.  It tasted and appeared more German than French to me. It was basically a fried duck leg and sausage in a bean stew more or less. The mashed beans had shredded lamb in it. Each component of the dish was extremely flavorful; when eaten together, the dish was a bit salty. Interesting dish , just not to our taste.\n-Duck fat fries: Fries are my weakness especially thing crispy ones! These were fried to perfection and accompanied by an Entrecote and Chipotle aioli I believe (guessing). It came in a cone and there was definitely not enough in mine, it was very hard to share haha!\n- Rum cake Meringue : I let my boyfriend choose (trying to be nice) , I would have personally chose the French toast.  It was meringue atop coffee ice cream atop rum cake in a chocolate sauce. The best part was the ice cream inside. Other than that, the rum cake had more rum than cake and it was very hard to put my fork into. \n\nThank you Chapeau! for a wonderful dinner! I can't wait to come back and try other dishes but I will definitely get that Skate Wing again :)\n\nP.S loved how they wrap our to go box into a foil purse with a sturdy handle!", "author": "Caroline T."}

We came here because of the great reviews on Yelp, and oh man are we glad we did!\n\nFirst, i'd like to say that although Yelp says it's a dressy place, it really isn't.  it's in a slightly shadier place of town and there were people dressed in tshirts and jeans, so feel free to come in whatever you're comfortable in.  I wore a black dress and he had a button down, and i believe that was a little much.  the ambiance is dressy, but the people are super nice and the atmosphere is laid back.\n\nWe made reservations for 5:30 since there is a special \"Early Bird\" menu where you can pick an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert for $28.  I went for the Menu 2 (which included a fish tasting for an extra 10 bucks).  \n\nAppetizer: Foie gras: i don't remember what it came with, but a small salad and some type of perfectly crispy bread.  the foie gras was perfectly seared on the outside and extremely buttery and melty on the inside.  paired with the slightly sweet and tart salad and the crunchy bread--it was ridiculously amazing.  I've never had foie gras before and am so glad i tried it!\n\nEscargot: my boyfriend got this because we've never had this before and it was garlicky--very much so, with lots of butter.  very delicious!  he loved the garlic sauce with the complimentary bread.\n\noh, and they also gave us some complimentary anchovy puff pastry, which was perfectly crunchy but not hard and deliciously salty.  =)\n\nfish tasting: i had scallop and a great risotto .  the scallop was tender but fully cooked--and being asian, i am not a big fan of non-jasmine rice, but this was melt-in-your mouth goodness\n\nEntree: skate fin: like everyone else who had this, i thought it was pretty amazing.  i've never had skate before, and it was really awesome.  it's a fish (for those who don't know) and was light but still meaty.  it wasn't a fish that kept you hungry afterwards, but not heavy like chicken.  it was extremely tender, and the potatoes that came with it was soft and tender.  the salad was tart and everything went very well together.  i thought it was bit salty, but i think everything is salty.  my bf thought it was perfect!\n\npork tenderloin wrapped in bacon: i really loved this!  i don't really love pork since it's often overcooked, but they had it medium rare (didn't know you can do this and still eat pork) and was the most amazing pork!  it was perfectly tender--not chewy or dry--the mashed potatoes were slightly sweet but not in an overpowering way.  \n\ndessert: napoleon: kiwi, strawberry, and mango cubes with these thin wafers, and some custard.  it okay.  it's not what i was expecting from a napoleon, but bf liked it.\n\nfrench toast: so i couldn't decide between the creme brulee and this, i asked the waiter and he told me this was definitely worth it.  he said there would be an 11 minute wait, but it definitely didn't take that long. it was AMAZING!  sweet but not overly so, the hazelnut ice cream was the best part.  a MUST try!\n\noverall, this place is great and i can't believe i found it here on yelp.  we're actually coming again tomorrow night for the appetizers and dessert!  ^ ^'", "author": "thai p."}

We tried here on a whim with a call Saturday night looking for last-minute open seats (usually an impossible task). He offered to save two seats at the bar and once off the phone we cabbed right over. \n\nThe restaurant was small and signage not clear from the street due to a huge tree at the front sidewalk. But the warm yellow tones, glimpse of white tablecloth, dark orange droplights over the bar, and tons of happy faces clustered around tables and engaged in avid conversation made us sure we had found the right place. \n\nThe owner/chef Philippe Gardelle is amazing. I find it incredible that after 10+ years he still maintains an energy and charisma that continues to permeate this place and make it so enchanting. He makes a point to welcome every guest that arrives at the door, but still manages to have a hand on all the dishes and desserts and even the wine that appear on the menu. He walks through the dining room, ensuring everyone has everything they need, and he is extra sure to bid them goodbye and help them call a taxi if they need it before they leave. As things calm down towards the end of service he even wipes down the outside covers of every single menu and makes sure the pages are secured. \n\nOn top of that, the food is divine and affordable for French fare without the stuffiness. You can make your own 3-course dinner for $38 (a little extra if your entree is seafood), 4-courses for $46, with a sorbet between appetizer & entree at $50.50. Come as an early bird and order between 5-6pm (excludes Fri & Sat) and the 3-course is $28. There are also plenty of affordable good wines under $40. \n\nThe \"Trio of Salmon\" was absolutely luxurious with salmon tartar wrapped by a ring of salmon gravlax, surrounded by a circle of creme fraiche and salmon roe, again by an outer ring of crispy fried capers and fluffy little bits of soft-boiled egg, and topped with microgreens and a crispy thin latticed chip. \n\nThe \"tasting fish\" that came only with the four-course selection was diced stewed tomato and sprouts atop a perfectly cooked scallop resting on basil-green risotto and a ring of creamy lobster sauce. It was like living \"Ratatouille\", where each individual component was a little spark of light in my mouth that exploded into fireworks when mixed together. \n\nThe \"bouillabaisse\" was a clean and rich-flavored broth with two fish fillets in the center and four mussels around it. Served with crisp croutons made of french bread and two little side bowls of smoky rich aioli, shredded cheese. The \"Cassoulet de Toulouse\" used dried and reconstituted cannellini beans which gave a great texture, duck leg confit, shredded lamb shoulder, and a little toulouse sausage. It was really rich and comforting for the cold winter night although a little too salty. \n\nThey offer two palate cleansers in the form of sorbet served in a little triangle bowl with a shot of liquor poured in. We tried the \"Colonel\", a lemon-ginger sorbet with a shot of citris vodka that really made the ginger sharpen up. Be careful if you've already committed to wine though because it can effect the taste. \n\nFinally, les desserts. Oh dear god those desserts. Our neighbors had a molten chocolate cake that for everywhere else seemed so passe, but this was a beautiful cake that completely collapsed in the center, looking like a chocolate donut with the most oozy divine chocolate syrup. We also eyed the Creme Brulee with envy. But we chose the \"Profiteroles\" thinking it would be a light end of the meal. Oh no, it's stuffed with ice cream, liberally drizzled with melted chocolate ganache and topped with slivered almonds. The surprising winner was also the \"Basil Napoleon\". Yes, basil and dessert. Who would've thought? The mini-diced mango, maui pineapple, banana and kiwi topped with three delicate cookie circles went so well with the champagne-citris pastry cream and basil. \n\nGot leftovers? They even wrap it up and shape the tinfoil like a basket. Adorable. Tired, stuffed beyond belief and content after such a wonderful night, we wandered home and slept like babies. \n\n5 stars, and definitely one of my new all-time SF favorites.", "author": "ChiYan T."}

Easily one of the best meals we've had, the ambiance is so romantic and perfect for date nights. We were there for almost three hours just savoring and enjoying every bite! They also accommodated our request for a corner table with no problem. We both picked Menu 1 which is a three course meal and a bottle of Husch Pinot Noir to go along with it. For starters, my hubby ordered the mussels, it came with shoestring fries that were to die for while I had the french onion soup. The  soup blew me away! It was so delicious! Even the hubby agrees and he is a french onion soup snub. As for entrees, hubby had the filet mignon with bone marrow. Ah the bone marrow was like butter, amazing! I on the other hand had the veal sweetbreads. I wish I knew what sweetbreads were before I ordered it but hey it's great to try new things. It was very delicious but the sweetbreads were very filling so I didn't finish it. At this time we still had desserts to tackle, hubby picked the sorbet and I had the Alaskan Bake, and since we were celebrating our anniversary they gave us creme brulee on the house. All three were fantastic! \n\nA few things to remember, come here hungry! Portions are huge, they give you a free basket of bread and that night they also gave us each a complimentary crostini with some sort of pate while we were waiting for our starters. And the chef/owner was out greeting everyone and making sure all the guests were happy and enjoying the food. Really a great place to visit, very romantic and the price is unbeatable.

It's a little wedged in and can be extremely loud, but the service is impeccable. There's always someone around noticing you need water, to order, to get the bill, etc. The owner/head chef greets all the guests and strikes up conversation, making this place much more personable and warm. The food is pretty great too! The filet mignon is superb, in a nice thick truffle sauce, the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin is delish, and the hickory smoked salmon light and fresh. My duck leg + breast was in a slightly sweet citrusy sauce, and I don't like mixing sweet tastes with meat, so I wasn't impressed by the duck. The desserts, chocolate cake and creme brulee were wonderful. The creme brulee wasn't as sweet as many other places, and a bit more creamy, which I liked all the better. I would definitely come here again! So good!", "author": "Jing P."}

The name describes the restaurant very well. I had a great expirience.\n\nI dined here with three others. We tried to get a reservation a few days in advance, but the best time was 5:45. I chose the three course prix fixe menu (which is basically choosing an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $41) and the others at my table got the early bird  menu (which is a limited three course prix fixe for $31). Our waiter was very helpful when ordering and he did a great job explaining the menu.\n\nFor the appetizer course, I had the Fourme d'Ambert tart, which came with a pear salad and a balsamic vinaigrette. This was my favorite dish of the night. It had the right amount of cheesiness, and the crunch from the salad and the tartness from the balsamic complemented the dish very well. My brother got the corn soup. It was very creamy and had a ton of corn flavor. Both of the appetizers were exceptional.\n\nI got the filet mignon for my entree. It was ordered medium rare, but it was slightly overcooked. However, it was still very flavorful and I loved the potatoes it came with. I also tried the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. It was tasty and cooked perfectly. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the nuage de noix. It basically was nuts in a frozen meringue. This was my favorite dessert that I tried, it was crunchy from the nuts and fluffy from the meringue. Also tried the french toast. It was rich and creamy, also very good. \n\nBottom line Chapeau! was one of the best dining experiences I had in SF. It's a small, lovely bistro in the Richmond district. Its a little on the pricey side, but the food is high quality.", "author": "Jacob F."}

The staff, however, was very accommodating and seemed to have to qualms about us having the largest group at that time so it didn't bother me. It did get a little stuffy at times, so I'd recommend leaving your jacket in the car.\n\nThis was my first experience at a traditional French restaurant and it was very impressionable. When we walked up to the hostess, she greeted us and the man that led us to our seats spoke to us in French and made sure to shake every one of our hands. The waiter was very patient and knowledgeable, he answered all of our questions regarding the food and wine, and he too had a charming personality. \n\nWe were served an appetizer bread with butter which was tasty and it didn't scratch the roof of my mouth. Next they gave us a complimentary chilled tomato-red soup that was also very good.\n\nWhen it came time to order, I decided to get the 3-course prix-fixed selection ($38). Salade Landaise: frisee, duck confit and they even topped it off with a generous portion of foie gras. It was to die for. For my entree I got the Bacon-wrapped Pork Tenderloin. It was as tender as pork can be, well seasoned and came in a sort of semi-sweet gravy. And best of all, for dessert I got French Toast with Hazelnut Ice Cream. The ice cream was extremely rich, tasted homemade and it was paired with the crispiest on the outside, softest in the middle french toast I have ever had. There was some sweetness to the caramel that topped it but the middle of the toast blunted the syrup and it was just such a good combination of contrasting textures. An experience that cannot be explained with words.\n\nWe had some great wine (forgot which one it was) and just chatted with really good food. Everything I ate was good. In fact, the staff was so friendly they didn't seem to mind that we stayed past closing time. So in short,  if you're looking for a traditional, semi-formal French restaurant full of charm and character and a menu that will soak your palate in the wonderful world of French textures and flavors check this place out.", "author": "Roy M."}

It is quite unassuming, behind an unassuming facade.  It's white cloth and near fine dining with fantastic service.  It's crowded, and our table was located in a less than perfect spot, but they really do a fantastic job servicing you, and it was never a problem for our group of 4.  For a french restaurant on Clement, they went the extra mile... a tasting menu that included sweetbreads as an app, filet with bone marrow, or duck breast, among other choices for the entree, and a wonderful array of desserts... creme brulee, a french toast, as well as a wonderful cheese plate for more than enough for two.  I grabbed a Sauternes as well, at the close of the meal.... so you won't be disappointed for a aperitif to digestif french style coursed dinner.  The wine list is accessible, without too much depth, so you won't be too stymied.  It's should be easy to figure out, but I am sure they will offer assistance.\n\nWell done!", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

Unfortunately, when you read such high reviews, your expectations go up and up. We new that it would be hard to meet such expectations. We would be comparing this restaurant with the best of the best (including Picasso's and LeCirque).\n\nWe had one challenge that this chef has not been challenged with before, Gluten free diner!  My daughter gets a very bad reaction to gluten and we were going for her birthday... so she needed a gluten free dessert. I called ahead and gave the restaurant a \"heads-up\" to the gluten free issue. I was quite surprised to have the chef get on the phone and ask us what we need to know about his restaurant.... very nice!\n\nAnyway, when we arrived on a nasty rainy day at 5:30 (the restaurant was very busy already). we were quickly seated with a very sweet hostess. We noticed that the chef Philippe (I think) walked around and greeted everyone and was very friendly. In fact, all of the servers were very friendly and did NOT rush anyone. It was like sitting in a Eurpean cafe, very relaxing. Hustle and bustle, everyone talking and the waiters were serving and still no rush.\n\nOur orders were for: appetizers: mussels (perfectly cooked) and scallops (also perfect and extremely tender) and finally, I had the foi gras (huge piece served with apple and a tiny toast), marvelous quality! If you like foi gras, this was truly excellent. The salad was good as well.\nfor entrees:  \nskate wing (absolutely the best I've ever had), bass, duck breast.\ndessert was banana pana cota and creme brulee. \nBut the surprise was that the chef went out of his way to make my gluten free daughter a special flourless chocolate cake for her birthday. Such a lovely gift! \n\nAgain, the service was spectacular, even though there was a play-off baseball game on TV and the staff was obviously engrossed with how that was progressing. They never ignored us or rushed us out. We were there for at least 3 hours. \n\nAlthough we got so many courses and drinks, wine and lattes with dessert, our bill was still under $200 for 3 people!! Amazing! In order to get such quality, it usually costs well over $400 for similar meals.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant and will be going much more often.

The first course was a crab tartar and it was quite good with good amount of crab mixed with creamy avocado on the bottom. \n\nSecond course, we got to pick between foir gras and pate, and I hate the foir gras. It was very rich and fatty and oily, but not bad... that's what foir gras are meant to taste like right? \n\nThird course was a fish (from my memory, I think it was snapper), grilled, served with basil sauce. So-so, wish the fish skin was a bit more crispier, and the flesh did not taste so fresh.\n\nFourth course, fillet mignon. I liked the sides of potatoes and mushrooms more than the steak itself, and the sauce was very rich in flavor. But the steak was a little bit tough and dry even though I asked for medium-rare.\n\nFor dessert, I had their crepe with citron sauce, and it was a bit too acidic for my taste. The crepe was too thick and dry, I wish I ordered the chocolate cake instead.\n\nOver-all, the food was not bad, but I expected better for the price we paid. Maybe it's because we just came back from New York where we had amazing French food for very reasonable price.

It went beyond that: the fore grais literally sent me back into time to the days when my grandmother would prepare liver as a side dish to her cooking. If you've ever seen Pixar's Ratatoullie, Anton Ego's time trip after having a bite of Ratatoullie pretty much sums this up.\n\nWhat made it especially pleasing was the service we received. Michael knew the best wine pairing to satisfy our fore grais, file mignon, duck breast, and oyster dishes. Each pairing made the sip of wine feel as if it were fated for the meal we had; that the specific grapes were picked from the wine, crushed, and then aged with the dish we had at the table. Each dish of the five course meal came out exactly at the right time, like going round for round in a boxing match only to get knocked out after the last bite.\n\nFurther, the chef is there to personally greet you as he walks around to thank you for coming and to shake your hand. It is this kind of service that we should expect, and after my recent vacation to Japan, something I realize is sorely missing from the industry in the United States.", "author": "Alfred Y."}

Right down to the perfectly cooked, lightly fried sweetbreads, to the mushrooms, to the black truffle sauce. Maybe could have used morel mushrooms (love those) but other than that, this dish was heavenly.\n\n- Duck Leg: Citrus-y! Moist and slightly sweet from the oranges.

They also bring out amuse-bouche prior to your entree for you to sample. \nThe ambiance is casual (although, I wish the tables were not so close together) and the food is very reasonably priced.", "author": "LatteGir L."}

Nope, This place lived up to the hype.\n\nWent with a friend to take advantage of Dine About Town.  The Dine About Town menu is usually cheaper than any restaurants prefix menu but Chapeau! has a prefix menu that's only $2 more, with much more selection.  We still opted for the Dine About Town menu because it still had a great selection.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the trout salad with a vinaigrette which tasted great.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone.\n\nAs for the entree, we both ordered the branzini, a sea bass.  It came with a savory sauce, mash potatoes, and portabella mushrooms.  The fish was just incredible and it was cooked perfectly.  I mean, it's just indescribable, you have to get it yourself to know what I mean.\n\nFor dessert, we got the Nuage de Noix.  It has roasted pistachios, almonds and hazelnuts in this frozen chantilly and Italian meringue.  It was crunchy and smooth.  A perfect way to end our dinner.\n\nThis place is somewhat small and we had to make reservations a couple of days in advance to get a table, the place was packed for a Tuesday night.  Chapeau! is definitely great for dates.  Service is great, attentive staff.  What made it kinda exciting for us was that the head chef came out to greet everyone and even shook our hands after our appetizers.", "author": "Roxie R."}

Everyone was really sweet and welcoming, even the chef came out and greeted us.\n\nWe all loved our appetizers, I had the salmon trio and it was delcious.  My main complaint is about the entree.  Three of us got bouillabaisse (which was $6 more for the 3 course menu price).  I was excited to see the result of all the fish and the shellfish but the outcome was disappointing.  The fish and shellfish were all braised in bland, unappetizing broth.  I've had monkfish elsewhere and it was deliciously seared but it was very disappointing all smushy in the bouillabaisse.  And because there was so much in one bowl, all cooked the same, the dish was just overkill.  \n\nLuckily, my dessert compensated for one of the worst seafood dishes I've ever had (I didn't even finish it).  My friends later told me the same (bouillabaisse and dessert reviews).  I recommend the chocolate cake.  \n\nThere's something wrong with their bathroom light setting - the light would go off while you're still in there!  Happened to me twice (I have a very active bladder).  \n\nAnother thing, my friend had the duck entree and she had asked to get it boxed but they never brought it out to her.

There were several empty tables. As we waited, I was enjoying the heater near the door that was drying the bottom of my jeans that were damp due to the drizzling rain outside. Dang - I'm from VA - why am I complaining? Darn you San Diego for spoiling me with your awesome weather. \n\nWe were greeted by the cheerful just so delightful chef. We were asked if we had a reservation and when we said no, the chef tried for several minutes to look for a table - mentioning to us that he had just given away his last free table - and even after we told him we can sit at the bar. I was surprised at first with all the empty tables but within 15 minutes of sitting down, the restaurant was full and busy. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the early bird prix fixe menu. \n\nThe bread was delicious. Perfect warm, soft, texture, crisppy crust. The butter was delicious. I ate most of the loaf. \n\nEscargot de Bourgogne in Butter-Parsley & Garlic Sauce - I've never had escargot before. I wasn't sure what to expect. I was scared but adventurous. The escargot was mild and prepared extremely well but the delight was the butter parsley & garlic sauce. It was fantastic! I loved the garlic undertones - it gave it a nice kick. I used the bread to try to finish as much of the sauce as possible. \n\nCassoulet de Toulouse - Canellini Beans/ Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder/Duck Leg Confit/ Garlic & Toulouse Sausage - The duck leg confit is the best I've had so far. Moist, not overly salty, delicious with the crust. The Garlic & Toulouse sausage was amazing too. The beans were a soft compliment to everything. I asked for a box to go. I never take anything to go since I'm traveling all the time but I couldn't let the unfinished entree go to waste. \n\nTahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e - the best Creme Brulee I've had so far. Texturelly perfect, the flavors were perfect and they used real vanilla beans. Perfect!\n\nFrench Toast - It was delicious! Pefectly cooked, rich, but not heavy. I wanted to devour the whole thing but I was stuffed beyond stuffed. \n\nService was thoughtful, amazing, and well, perfect! I dont' think I used the word perfect and delicious so many times in any review. The staff was so attentive. I loved how the chef walked by saying Bon Appetit and asking us how our meal is. \n\nBut the highlight of the evening was when we were leaving, about 15 feet outside the restaurant, our wonderful chef ran outside, in the rain, to say good bye and hoped to see us again.

Each course was in perfect proportions and delicious. As an appetizer, I got the seared foie gras (so rich, it melts in your mouth), for the main course the duck, and for dessert the french toast. All were incredible; however, I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. \n\nOur waiter was French, which of course adds a bit of credibility to the place. In addition, the chef & owner (who is French as well) stopped by our table during our meal to say \"bonsoir,\" and I informed him that it was my boyfriend's birthday. Then later in the evening, right after we left, he ran out of the restaurant after us to wish my boyfriend happy birthday again and tell us \"merci\" for eating at his restaurant. It was quite funny.

Between 3 of us, I was able to taste a pretty good variety from their menu.\n\nAppetizers:  \n-Chestnut soup:  Surprisingly very delicious!  The flavor and texture was amazing.  Definitely worth giving a try, even if you're not into chestnuts.  \n-Mesclun salad:  The dressing was light, and the grapes and pistachios added an excellent punch of flavor and texture.\n\nEntrees:  \n-Branzini (sea bass) with whipped potatoes, portabello mushrooms, and pearl onions:  The sauce was actually my favorite part of this dish.  It complimented the fish very well.  Would have liked a little more potatoes though.\n-Bacon wrapped pork:  Cooked well and very juicy, unlike many pork dishes I've had.\n\nDesserts:  My favorite part of the meal!  \n-Brioche french toast with caramel sauce and hazelnut ice cream:  First of all, how amazing does that sound?  You know a dessert was meant for you when your mouth instantly begins to salivate as soon you read the description.  French toast never tasted better.\n-Vanilla bean creme brulee:  Good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The portion was HUGE though, and was served in a ramekin practically the size of my head!\n-Nauge de noix (roasted pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts with frozen meringue):  Very refreshing and unique way to end a meal.  The combination of nuts was perfect and went well with the light meringue.\n\nThe food was delicious and the service was great.

If you want to be personally greeted and looked after at several points throughout the dinner by the chef himself (who is an amazing funny + charismatic person), then head on over.\n\nThe food was delicious. Some standouts:\n- seared foie gras served with green apple slices and a sweet (balsamic?) sauce. Seriously melt-in-your-mouth good. I'm sorry little geese...I know it's cruel. But man, stop being so dang tasty!\n- chestnut soup. So creamy and nutty. And a little unexpected given that much of the menu is fairly traditional French food.  An awesome little nugget of happiness awaits you in the center (cabbage + croutons) so that there's a little texture to mix with the creaminess.\n- profiteroles. Especially if you like dark, rich chocolate. They definitely don't skimp!\n\nThe main dishes were good (skate wing + lavender chicken), but the apps and dessert are definitely where it's at.\n\nOn our way out, Chef Phillipe came (literally) running over to say goodbye.

We were seated instantly. Ordered a half bottle of Sancerre 22$ great value in my opinion. For apps had french onion soup: great flavor perfect broth with just enough stewed onions topped with cheese, best onion soup I've ever had...honest. Mixed green salad: mescaline greens with grapes and I believe pistachios with a sweet sour grape vinaigrette, again perfect balance very satisfying. Salmon carpaccio : again seemed lightly cured in w salt but not smoked very delicate w mango, nuts, I think some creme fl\u00e8che on top. Great combo. Pork loin: cooked med rare the way it should be wrapped in bacon with potato pur\u00e9e also great. The star of the night was definitely the skate: cooked perfectly with a rich brown butter lemon sauce with capers, potatoes, and crunchy croutons also m\u00e2ch\u00e9 provided perfect texture and flavor. Best fish dish in sf!!! I would drink that sauce if I could. Saw many other great dishes being served around us. The vibe was great and everyone around us seemed happy.

This was a very nice classy place.\n\nThe food was good and the service was superb.  I had the tiger prawns for appetizer and my bf had the salmon trio, for entree we had filet mignon and duck breast and dessert we got creme brulee and chocolate cake.  Appetizer was decent, the tiger prawns were good, but I didn't really care for the thing in the middle of the plate (not sure what it is) since it had bell peppers in it, which I don't like.  The salmon trio good. My bf loved the duck breast.  both the duck breast and the filet mignon was cooked perfectly the way we want it (medium rare). Dessert was great too, but was pretty full when we had to eat it.  for the chocolate cake, it's more of dark chocolate used, which I like but there's a slight bitterness to it. creme brulee was yummy, very creamy and vanilla-y.\n\nThe only problem I have for this area is parking. Parking is very difficult since there's no parking structure or anything, only street parking. So advice come early to give yourself room to find parking, we were about an hr late for our reservations because of parking and traffic.  However, the restaurant was very courteous to save our reservations since we called and told them that we'll be late. The moment we came, they had a table waiting for us and we were seated right away.  Can't beat the customer service here.\n\nPrice was really good for the service and food too if you get the prix fix deal. 3 course of your choice of any appetizer, entree and dessert on the menu for only $38 is a great deal.   \n\nWill definitely come back and totally recommend this place.", "author": "Phuong Q."}

The leisurely (never slow) service allowed us to enjoy a couple loaves in between courses. \n\nAppetizers included the foie gras (foie gras, potato, and apple) and the corn puree (corn puree, dungeness crab).

Both entrees were cooked to our request and complimented well by their sides (I may have even engaged in a couple of furtive glances to the left and right before wiping the plate with my finger). \n\nBy the time dessert rolled around, we were both full, but shared the creme brulee and the warm chocolate cake, a particularly memorable version served with banana ice cream and flambeed bananas. The cap on the perfect meal was the complimentary panna cotta with strawberry garnish, an apology of sorts for the long wait for a table despite our reservation. \n\nBy the time we wheeled ourselves out of the restaurant, we had agreed that our first time at Chapeau! was fantastic, and that it would certainly not be our last.

After reading all these great reviews I think I expected much more from the restaurant. On the plus side, the chef was on the floor greeting and chatting up customers the entire time I was there. It'a nice that he shows great appreciation for his patrons. I did the Dine About Town menu and wasn't entirely impressed. I ordered...\n\n- Appetizer: Mesclun salad with fried Camembert and walnut bread - although seemingly simple, I really enjoyed this salad...maybe because there's fried cheese in it.\n\n- Entree: Duck breast with bok choy and polenta - the duck was cooked well and the polenta was thick, yet creamy. I didn't care for the bok choy because it was over cooked, almost a complete mush. Overall, I thought the dish was ok, just not spectacular.\n\n- Dessert: Tahitian vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e - this was good, very rich and creamy. I liked that it came in a wide, shallow dish because that meant more surface area for the burnt sugar. I started to feel sick from the richness before I could finish this. It's a lot of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nIf I come back again, I would try the cassoulet.", "author": "Nancy F."}

My girlfriend ordered the 3-course menu while I got the 4-course so we could both try the tasting fish.\n\nThe appetizers we selected were the Salmon Trio and the Mussels & Freedom Fries. Salmon was tasty and refreshing, while the mussels were spot-on. Generous portion, delicious mussel juice/sauce (dipping bread into sauce = a must), solid french fries. Mussels looked so good that the woman at the adjacent table asked for some of ours, much to the horror of her dinner companion.\n\nTasting fish was a seared scallop with risotto, can't really go wrong with that.\n\nFor the mains, girlfriend ordered the sweetbreads while I, at the recommendation of our waiter, selected the chicken. While the sweetbreads paired with mushrooms were amazing, the chicken was the reason this review is not a 5-star (a curse on that French waiter with his elegant accent - I couldn't say no! Luckily he was a soccer fan so that redeemed him substantially). The chicken itself was rather bland and dry, while the amount of pepper used in the dish was overwhelming. When I commented on the peppery-ness of the dish, our waiter replied \"Baht of course, ze sauce is a peppercorn sauce!\" So duh on me?\n\nDesserts were fantastic, in particular my girlfriend's french toast with caramel ice cream. I ordered the chocolate cake, which was also lovely.\n\nOverall, Chapeau was excellent and warranted a 5-star review, if only for that peppery chicken (I don't care if ze sauce was supposed to be peppercorn, it was too peppery).", "author": "Julian C."}

The salmon was fresh and flavorful, the dish reminded me of a yummy sushi dish.\n\n--Appetizer- Foie Gras/Apple/Brioche--A generous portion of foie gras sliced thin, seared till nice and brown on the outside. I only had a bite but it was really good.\n\n-- Appetizer- Sweetbreads- simple, delicious.\n\n--Entree- Scallops with Pesto Risotto- 3 HUGE scallops, seared perfectly and tender inside, sitting atop a creamy vibrant green pesto risotto, surrounded by a little lobster broth. So good, perfectly seasoned, portion was large so I took leftovers home.\n\n--Entree- Filet Mignon, foie gras, wild mushrooms - I had a bite of this and I'll definitely order this next time. Filet was perfectly medium rare to rare, seasoned well. Mushrooms were sauteed and delicious, and I think there was truffle oil on this dish wish smelled and tasted amazing. \n\n--Dessert- Trio of Sorbets- House made fresh sorbet in raspberry, mango and lime? Served with a mild apple chutney in a hazelnut \"basket\". The sorbets were yummy and fresh. Chutney was ok, I don't think it really added to the dessert but it didn't hurt it. \n\n-- Dessert- French Toast- This dish is a must order, it is to die for and is the best french toast ever. A thin slice of french toast, buttery and soaking up the sauce surrounding it, and topped with melting hazelnut ice cream. \n\nPortions are pretty large compared to similar restaurants. I usually can finish my plate at finer restaurants like this one but here I had to take leftovers home in a doggy bag. \n\nSERVICE: Super friendly, they make you feel special and appreciated, and even give you a hug when you leave. \n\nAltogether a perfect place for any occasion, excellent service and food, and great value.", "author": "amy k."}

My Mom and I got the Wild Skate Wing, which is a white fish that you really can't find in other restaurants around here. It was sort of sour, which was awesome! My sister got the Petit Poussin, which is baby chicken, and after she said she was going to save half for lunch tomorrow she basically devoured it.\n\nBecause it was my sister's birthday we ended up getting three desserts even though we were all stuffed. The Tahitenne Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee was my favorite, although my sister was bummed that it didn't have any mint on it.

The service was good, and the chef paid us a speedy visit immediately after we were seated, which was nice but came across as a bit insincere.  The hostess and waiter were friendly and knowledgeable, the service was quick.  \n\nThe food was solid, traditional, but predictable, French: the mesclun salad was by far the best thing we tasted that night.  My escargot appetizer was not good: lost in heavy-handed pool of garlic and parsley.

I then realized the very thick accented server were giving us a bazillions of specials which kind of overwhelmed us.  Why won't restaurants just print out one for each of the server to give to us to take a quick look, because not all of us can retain like 10 specials in 3 minutes!\n\nHaha, but anyway, that was kind of disappointing.  \n\nThe place though was nice and small, very warmth with body heat and intimately lit atmosphere.

The staff was very accommodating (I am currently on crutches after ankle surgery), and let me change to a corner table where I could prop my foot up and ice it.\n\nWe started off with the chestnut soup and Meclun salad, which were both DELICIOUS.  The chestnut soup was wonderfully creamy and comforting.  The perfect starter on such a cold day.  The Meclun salad was light, but flavorful.  I loved the dressing.\n\nFor the our entrees we had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and the branzino (sea bass), but were incredibly tasty.

I love how the place is not too pretentious, it was very welcoming and warm. It's definitely a date night setting where tables are mainly for party of 2. The lights are dimmed and 80% of the people there were couples. \n\nWe did the prix fixed option. I ordered the Fris\u00e9e, Duck Confit & Smoked Duck Magret, Fingerling Potato Chips, Classic French Vinaigrette. Two things I love the most, duck and chips. Paired together? Amazing result. The thin crispy potato chips complements really well with the texture of the duck. The crunchiness just makes chewing duck a little less expected. For the main course, I think I got the flounder or some type of special of the day. The fish was really good. They left the skin on the fish and grilled it to a perfect crispy-ness. So each bite you get a thin layer of cripsy skin and buttery, melt-in-your- mouth fish. Lastly, I got the creme brulee. It wasn't a tough decision because I love creme brulee. It was very traditionally and simple - simplicity always rules! \n\nThe pricing was on the higher end. But definitely worth it if you are celebrating an occasion. \n\nMy only criticism is that the tables are way too close to one another.

Instead of ordering off the Prix Fixed menu (neither of us was in the mood for dessert), we decided to share one appetizer, one palate cleanser and two entrees. \n\nAppetizer: Tiger Prawns wrapped in Phylo Dough - pretty good for a bottom feeder.

Love ginger though. \n\nMy entree: Wild Caught Skate Wing - per all the Yelp reviews I decided to order the Chef's masterpiece. It was good, but not crazy delicious. I wouldn't order it again. Kind of plain. I guess I was expecting more. \n\nFiance's entree: Duck special (I think). I was so sad when our dishes came out as my plate was HUGE and my fish was pretty large, but his dish was soooo tiny and his food looked like baby bites.

The food and the staff were great but there could be some minor improvements that could have made the experience a 5-star instead of a 4 star - still a fan! \n\nAnyways, we get to the restaurant and you go through these doors to a big thick curtain. You pass the curtain and you wait for a hostess while your butt gets into the faces of people sitting there and eating. First of all, it took some time before the hostess acknowledged us because they were so busy. Second, very bad waiting area - you are standing in the dining room while people are trying to eat and the waiter would always have to excuse themselves through us to get to the tables which we had to squirm out of the way. It was awkward and uncomfortable. Third, we realized that the thick curtain was there to block the cold from coming through the door as it can gets cold when people enter and exit the restaurant. Suggestion to the restaurant - redo the front of the restaurant!! \n\nSo, we finally get sitted and we were packed like sardines. Pretty tight sitting and definitely can hear all your neighbors conversation, so not a place to really talk about anything too personal. \n\nAlright, so we got comfy and we ordered. For our appetizer, we got the Trout and the Escargot. Both were very tasty - the escargot was actually soft in texture and the Trout tasted like salty fish (for all you Chinese people out there, it tasted like \"hom yue\"). \n\nFor dinner, we got the Salmon and the Duck Breast. I had the Salmon and it was cooked medium rare and it was so tender. It was one of the best Salmon I had - YUMMY! My friend had the Duck Breast and he said it was delicious (I don't eat duck because it the one of the fattest poultry out there). \n\nSo, we were full, but couldn't pass out dessert. My friend had the apple tart and I had the warm chocolate cake which takes 10 minutes to make. My friend liked his dessert, but I was disappointed with mine. It was actually kinda bland to me.

I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection. Crispy on the outside, firm and soft on the inside. Not dry at all. I stole a bite from the BF's plate of chicken. Pretty good as well. For dessert we had the profiteroles which were a heavy helping on its own. \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant. Ambiance is clean, bright, almost like the living room of someone's home in Hayes Valley. The servers are nice and attentive. The chef will personally thank you for coming. Food is excellent. Menu options are a good idea as well.", "author": "Katie Anne N."}

I will skip the food review since there are many others on yelp, but what I ordered was delicious (chestnut soup, glazed chicken, nuage de noix). The service here was exceptional. We were serviced by the chef himself and also thanked on the way out. A lot is to be said about a chef who takes the time to converse with his guests and because of that single factor, Chapeau will forever have a place in my heart.\n\nThe only thing is that the tables are very close together and we shared a table with 2 other guests.

It's nice and seems very fancy smancy, but you don't have to dress that way.  Everyone seemed to be in pretty casual wear.  Dim lights with a romantic ambiance to it.  Perfect place for dates.\n\nThe owner and his wife are super friendly. They walked around greeting their customers and making sure everything was ok. Our waiter= superb. Service was excellent here. I was very satisfied with just that alone.\n\nWe had:\n\nFish and potato taster:\nThis was complimentary from the chef. It was a nice little surprise. I thought the fact that it came out in a little spoon was so cute! Fits perfectly into the mouth. I really enjoyed this little teaser. I really like potatoes and fish so it satisfied my taste buds.\n\nTrio of Salmon:\nGravlax, tartar and caviar/egg mimosa, fried capers and creame friache/ microherbs with lemon dressing\nThis appetizer was delicious. The salmon was full of flavor and was a very refreshing appetizer. It was definitely one of our favorites that night. The checkered chip on top reminded me of potato chips. Loved the presentation as well as the taste of this dish. YUMMY!\n\nPrince Edwards Island Mussels:\nsteamed with white wine, shallot and parsley\nI love mussels. The sauce was awesome and very tasty. I dipped our complimentary bread into the sauce and let it soak into the bread. YUM! I loved the taste of parsley, it made it taste really refreshing!\n\nPommes Frites and Rouille:\nIt reminds me of In and Out's fries. I have nothing to complain about that, I just wouldn't expect it at a fine dining restaurant. Nothing too special, but the sauce was delicious!\n\nCassoulet de Toulouse\nCanelli beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder/ duck leg confit/ garlic and toulouse sausage\nThis dish tasted the way it looked, very unappetizing. I was very dissappointed in not only the presentation of the dish but the taste as well. The excessive amount of beans reminded me of Mexican food. I barely tasted the lamb or the duck, although the sausages were definitely there. I was expecting more from an upscale restaurant like Chapeau!.\n\nFilet Mignon with Foie Gras\nwith oyster and lobster mushrooms and potatoes\nThe waiter recommended us to get this with the foie gras and so we did. I think it was my first time trying foie gras. The waiter was right, the filet mignon tasted really good with the foie gras. I don't think I could have had the whole dish to myself because the foie gras itself is very rich, thus making the dish very rich. When eating the foie gras with the filet mignon, its best to just get a little piece of foie gras to go with the meat, otherwise it's too rich.\n\nBasil Napoleon\nMaui Pineapple, Manilla Mango, Banana, Kiwi & Strawberries/\nChampagne-Citrus Pastry Cream/ Feuille de Bric\nVery refreshing dessert. It's not overwhelming with sweetness. It had natural sweetness from all the fruits. After having such a rich dessert like the french toast, it was perfect. Tasted nice amd healthy. I felt good eating it.\n\nFrench Toast\nBest dessert there!! It's seriously delicious. Who would have ever thought that french toast as a dessert would be so good! I loved how it was warm and there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top drizzled with a little bit of caramel. Heaven in my mouth!!\n\nBanana Panna Cotta\nStrawberry Salad/ Shortbread \nThe strawberries weren't that fresh and a little bit on the sweet side, but the shortbread was delicious. Out of the 3 desserts, this was my least favorite. It was still pretty good, but just my least favorite.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed EVERYTHING except my dish the Cassoulet de Toulouse with canelli beans, shredded braised lamb shoulder/ duck leg confit/ garlic and toulouse sausage", "author": "Sarah F."}

I momentarily forgot I was in public and pondered picking up my plate to lick it clean.  For the entrees, we tried the rack of lamb and the bacon-wrapped pork loin. Both were excellent.  The texture of both the entrees/appetizers was really amazing -- everything felt really easy to eat. The bed of potato underneath the pork loin was especially tasty.\n\nFor dessert, we tried to order two of the french toast, but the waiter stopped us and told us to replace one with the molten chocolate cake.  The cake was basically a chocolate shell with a warm chocolate soup inside and bananas. I would highly recommend either the french toast or the warm chocolate cake.  \n\nThe staff is excellent. It's basically a bunch of french guys who mother you during your meal. They check on you constantly to see if you're enjoying your meal.

I had the tiger prawns to start, and the duck for my main course. The duck (I wished it hadn't been served with an orange sauce) consisted of both leg and breast, and was absolutely perfectly cooked to my liking.  The amount of meat was extremely generous and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The prawns were good, but I particularly enjoyed the tomato and onion marmalade and the herb aioli that accompanied them.\n\nFor dessert H and I shared the delicious Nuage de Noix (Roasted Pistachios, Almonds & Hazelnuts in a Frozen Chantilly & Italian Meringue) and the Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which would have been perfection, if only they had caramalized the sugar on top a bit more.\n\nThe wine menu was decent, and they were happy to let us taste a few wines before deciding on a bottle. \nBonus - corkage is $18 a bottle, but they wave the fee if you also buy a bottle from their menu.\n\nService was warm and friendly and very efficient, and the owner/chef/sommelier Phillipe was a genuinely enthusiastic and gracious host.\n\nI can't wait to come back for more!", "author": "Izzy A."}

The chef sending us into a foggy San Francisco night with kisses for the ladies' cheeks is bound to leave that kind of impression. \n\nSo, why five stars? \n\nFirst, the food is rich and complex, yet accessible. An elegant mixture of semi-exotic delicacies along with old favorites (yes, you can get \"Traditional\" onion soup). Better yet, you can ignore the \u00e0 la carte prices. This bistro's prix-fixe menu is surprisingly affordable, especially given the diversity of tasty appetizers, succulent entr\u00e9es, and decadent desserts (mine was Nuage de Noix: C'est incroyable). Plan well, and each three- or four-course meal combines into an explosion of rich tastes shared plate to plate. \n\nThat's why you'd better get a reservation well before showing up. Locals and out-of-towners already know how good this place is. Yes, Chapeau! is noisy, making it difficult to enjoy a relaxing conversation. But the noise is joyful and the crowd is typical SF: relaxed and welcoming. Plus it's fun to lean over your amuse-bouche to listen to your friend's story. \n\nWait: this is \"French Food.\" Isn't that stuff bewildering? And aren't the servers rude? Maybe elsewhere - or in the movies, but not here. The snoot factor is precisely zero. Everyone in Chapeau! is uniformly pleasant, patient, and flexible with special requests. Go ahead and ask what that strange menu item actually *is*. In terms of quality and vibe, it's all good. \n\nOh, and don't forget to take a walk around the Inner Richmond neighborhood (aka \"New Chinatown\") before or after your meal. Comfy coffee shops, bulging bookstores, and the wafting smells of cr\u00eapes from a nearby bakery offer yet more proof of just how amazing San Francisco can be. \n\nHeading to the City by the Bay?

But, yes, the price is right for food that is pretty good. \n\nI liked the mesclun salad with fried Camembert.  Fresh greens with a somewhat sweet dressing that was well complemented by the somewhat salty cheese.  \n\nAn ample serving of Skate wing was nice although the sauce that accompanied it was a bit too much for the fish, at least to me.\n\nFinally the cheese plate was composed of three nice cheeses, honey, walnuts and walnut bread.

The salad with duck confit was made that much better with a piece of decadent foie gras set on top. The trio of salmon was a great starter - somewhat light for what I knew was going to be a rather rich meal. \n\nThen I had the tasting fish course - I mean what's not to love about a seared scallop with a tomato onion chutney on top that is sitting on a pesto risotto and surrounded by a lobster bisque??? We also had the mussels and fries - I kept dipping everything I could into that broth. \n\nIntermission to cleanse our palate with green apple sorbet in calvado. Fun little kick, too. :)\n\nI had the skate wing special that had a nice tangy flavor with the lemon and the capers. It was delicious. The bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin had a great smokiness from the bacon and the sauce balanced it out with the perfect amount of sweetness. Mmmmm!\n\nThen came dessert - the French toast. I don't even know what to say about this. I mean I have a sweet tooth and I love dessert and I order it quite often. But this dessert will be one of those that remain in my memory for a loooong time and I could definitely see myself having a craving for this in the near future. Yes. It was that good. We also got profiteroles - while we definitely didn't need anymore food, we couldn't actually let them go to waste! They were very good - but paled in comparison to the French toast. \n\nWe were the last people left in the restaurant - when the owner/chef came over to see how our meal was (after receiving the 'bisou bisou' - geez, I LOVE the French!) we even chatted with him longer since he was done for the night and....well...since the 2 of us had a lot of useless things to probably talk to him about after having almost polished off that second bottle of wine. \n\nI can't wait to come back!!!", "author": "Jen N."}

The Pork Tenderloin had a really excellent, savory gravy and was cooked medium rare.

Just thinking about this meal makes my mouth water. \n\nI love this place so much that I get a little defensive when I read others negative reviews. I just can't understand how anyone can dislike it! So to stand up for my favorite restaurant I want to address a couple issues that other reviewers brought up: \n\n1.) The tables are close together. We went early so this wasn't an issue as the seating was spaced out and no one was seated next to us. If you have an issue with being close to others just go early.\n\n2.) Yes, the food is very rich. Hello folks! Shocker, but it's French cuisine.\n\n3.) Yes, almost all the waitstaff does speak with a French accent. I have no idea if the accents are real or not, but I honestly couldn't care one way or another as they communicate effectively and do their job damn well. Who even stops to wonder about this? And yes, the whole meal is on European time. Personally, I love this. However, if you're in a rush this may not be the restaurant for you.\n\nAnd now for something completely different:\n\n1.) We started out with the fois gras appetizer and the Onion Soup. the fois gras was one of the best I've had in my life. It literally melted in the mouth. The pairing of fruit was perfect with the fatty liver. Fantastic! The onion soup was very tasty.\n\n2.) I had a single scallop on a small bed of risotto, for an amuse bouche, which was quite honestly extraordinary. I practically licked the plate clean.\n\n3.) For the main course we had duck and halibut. The duck was stunning with a savory sauce that made your mouth water for more the minute you swallowed. The halibut was so light and delicate I just kept making pleasing guttural noises with every bite. The creamy sauce over a small amount of obviously very fresh pasta was rich while still being delicate and not overwhelming. \n\n4.) Surprisingly, despite everyone raving about the chocolate cake this was in fact our least favorite aspect of the meal. It was a decent cake, but just wasn't up the high standard set by the rest of the meal. Next time I will get the Creme Brulee. \n\n5.) We purchased the wine paring for the entire meal. Although this really upped the price of dinner I can not recommend this highly enough. The wine pairings were balanced beautiful to amplify and draw out the complex flavorings of the meal. \n\nThis is my favorite French restaurant in San Francisco, even better than Fleur de Lys.", "author": "Natasha Anna A."}

All in all, it was a very pleasent, relaxing and enjoyable meal I would not hesitate to recommend. \n\nAfter our meal, I mentioned to the chef that I definately noticed an improvement from the last time I ate there.  He mentioned that he had to make a decision between maintaining two resturants or focusing on the subtle things.  Although it must have been a hard decison to close one of the resturants, this resturant now has the chefs full attention and that makes this place an entirely new resturant.", "author": "david c."}

The waiter had a French accent which we could hardly understand, but it mattered not. The appetizers were delicious. I had the salmon three ways, and my girlfriend had the escargot. She said it was the best escargot she has had outside of Paris. The salmon was exquisite, complimented by egg and fried capers. The wine was great. We eagerly finished the appetizers and began anticipating the main course.\n\nMy Cassoulet de Toulouse was delicious, but the real winner was the lovely lady with the Filet Mignon. My goodness, that was amazing. The desserts were surprisingly average. We had creme brulee and a floating island. Maybe we didn't try their best ones.\n\nI would highly recommend Chapeau to anyone.

This happened every night, if you made it out of the restaurant and he hadn't thanked out he would catch up to you so he could.  After a year of seeing that I had to try the place.\n\nThis isn't the sort of restaurant you can walk in off the street and grab a table; make  a reservation.

Food was outstanding!...though the decor seemed a bit bland. (i.e. plain salmon-colored walls and deep brown carpet.) For a place with a sexy French hat logo, I expected something a bit more... Moulin Rouge, no? hahah ok ok, on with the food.\n\nTomato bisque with crab cake: perfect consistency, warm roasted red pepper notes. (You'll love dipping a fresh baguette slice into it!) \n\nDuck breast: sublime medallions of almost-creamy duck meat, complemented with savory potatoes, off-set with warm sweet pear and bright grapes. Absolutely delicious.\n\nFor dessert, I chose the Profiteroles (cream puffs with ice cream). A generous portion of 3 puffs, but the pastry could have been lighter. Oh, but the ice cream was phenomenal, creamy and strong vanilla bean flavor. :)\n\nBUT WAIT- my friend got the French Toast, which OMG...one bite will have you at its mercy! It's served swimming in a rich caramel maple sauce, and the bread slice is infused with sweet egg...it tasted like a melt-in-your-mouth egg tart.

God forbid....\n\nBut I have to say, I am thrilled that there are many gems tucked away in my hood that I am finally getting to experience or \"put on\".  After The Richmond, Aziza, and B-Star, I am over the moon that Chapeau! exists so close to my home.\n\nChris ordered a few oysters for an app.  I got the lamb and he got the filet mignon with foie gras and truffles.  The lamb dish was bigger than I imagined and cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the side of ratatouille was as good as what I imagined the Pixar movie ratatouille tasted like.  The potato gratin was cheesy but needed a little more seasoning.  But can I tell you?  My man's filet was off the hinges.  Holy moly, that beef melted in my mouth and with the little bit of foie and truffle added an extra dimension of flavor that I kind of never tasted together before.\n\nAnd to top off the night of deliciousness, we ordered the French toast dessert with cups of decaf espresso.  Wow, oh wow!  The dessert was rich and cool and creamy and sweet.  It didn't taste like breakfast but a real dessert.  Oh heaven helped us that night.

My fiance ordered onion soup, poached halibut, and creme brulee. \n\nThe sweetbreads was decadent, light pan fried and perfect in size for an appetizer. The roasted duck came with polenta and a few other fixings, but what made it wildly delicious was the jus! IT was sweet and savory and just pulled the entire dish together, I literally could not put my fork down! The Meyer Lemon Tart was the Tart de jour and who knew you could get such a melt in your mouth buttery, tangy tart.\n\nThe service and waitstaff was great, the only reason I did not give it five stars is because it was very loud and the acoustics were not very good.

I was hoping for brunch food but they were apparently running their regular menu. Oh well, we make due. The interior is very nice and the service was quite good. However, I don't think I've ever had a male french FOH person that hasn't just seemed really creepy. Creepy in the sense that if I had a daughter I wouldn't let her anywhere close to them. Now that is not to say that they're not perfectly adequate at their job. Being in the industry, I know sometimes the creepiest people in real life are the best at their hospitality jobs... (not me of course... being creepy that is). The food overall was great, especially cuz I wasn't paying. I got the 4 course. \n\nApp: Fried tiger prawns with a piperade. Excellent! Prawns perfectly cooked and had a thing stringy batter that made for great texture and didn't overshadow the delicacy and moisture of the prawns. \n\nFish tasting course: (no choice here but I would've picked this anyway) A seared day boat scallop, served on a pesto risotto, with a lobster bisque sauce. Superb! Once again scallop was perfectly cooked, which is much harder than doing the same with the prawns. Risotto still held on to the flavor and moisture necessary for a good risotto. The bisque was excellent as well. The dish balanced perfectly, and I loved how the flavors/elements didn't get in the way of each other. It was wonderful to get a bite of all three, but if you just wanted to taste one you could. \n\nEntree: Veal sweetbreads with mushrooms. Pretty good. Definitely not as good as the first two, but it's hard to go wrong with sweetbreads as far as I'm concerned. The mushrooms, and sauce were great. I think they were king mushrooms, but I don't remember. The sauce and the sweetbreads played off each other quite well, although the sweetbreads were a bit dry. I had do really lather them in the sauce to compensate. But overall a successful dish. \n\nDefinitely very full at this point...(very heavy meal, but no one's fault but my own)\n\nDessert: As a table consensus we went with the profiteroles. They were great, but at that point my palate was pretty overloaded. But the table agreed they were delicious...\n\nThanks for a great meal chapeau. Let me save up a little and I'll be back!\n\nWines: Had Quincy Sauv, and a sancerre (forget which one) But I preferred the sancerre.

It was a salty salad that included bits of duck, prosciutto, and a small piece of foie gras on top\n\nFoie Gras - BOMB. The presentation was very nice and included thinly sliced apple and some greens.\n\nOysters - Ok, kind of small, but luckily we only ordered 2 ($2 each)\n\nFilet Mignon - Very tender and soft. The sauce wasn't exotic or new, but very well executed. It complimented the filet and the cubed potatoes nicely.\n\nBaby Chicken - A hearty dish that included steamed vegetables, grilled shrimp, and a medley of vegetables. Chicken was moist and held the flavor of the sauce very well.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake - Pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing here. The side of banana ice cream was an interesting touch, however, I would have preferred a scoop of vanilla.\n\nFrench Toast - MUST ORDER. It was topped with a hazelnut caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream. I didn't expect it to be so good but am glad I ordered it. \n\nTotal bill including tip was around $120.

Today is our second anniversary eve and I did a lot of research and chose this place. I made reservations and went there. Now to start with, what was extremely disappointing was the fact that the place was extremely crowded and all the tables were put so close together that you have to try and nudge yourself in to the seat. There was absolutely no privacy and I felt even if I moved my hand a bit I was going to hit the person next to me. I swear I am not exaggerating. What should have been a seating place for 2 or maximum 3 tables actually had six tables. Owing to the crowd it was extremely noisy as well.\n\nNow for the food. We are vegetarians and we asked about the soup we were told that the stock was chicken. We were quite disappointed. But anyway we were here for a romantic evening. Since that was not going to happen we were having second thoughts about continuing to eat here. We decided to just have desserts first and go elsewhere to dine.\n\nWe called our waiter and told him that we would like to go for desserts. For some reason the waiter didn't find this idea appealing. He was quite rude and took our orders. \n\nWe ordered Tahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Basil Napoleon. \n\nThe orders arrived and it was amusing to see that Basil Napolean was two or may be just one tablespoon of cut fruits with the topping from the Tahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me (This was the other dessert we ordered).\n\nTahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me was ok. We expected it to be cold. That was probably what we missed in this.

Everything that I had to eat (not to mention everything my boyfriend and parents had, for that matter) was utterly delicious in every way.  \n\nAppetizers: I had the mesclun salad to start (delicious, and quite large--I'd recommend sharing this to make sure you have room for many more courses).  I also tried the bf's salad with duck--possibly even better than the mesclun salad; but really, we're splitting hairs here.  \n\nFish Tasting Course: Next we were given a complimentary fish tasting course (reason to follow).  I had the prawn; and frankly, if a tiny shellfish were ever pure poetry, this one was a Shakespearean sonnet.  I can't even describe the utter perfection of these few bites.  The rest of the table had the scallop (which, since I'm allergic, I'm sad to say I didn't try).  \n\nEntree: I had the filet mignon entree--a perfectly cooked cut of red meat.  That's really all you need to know (because, what beats that?).  I also tried the bf's poussin (aka small chicken) which was maybe the best chicken I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  \n\nDessert: For dessert we had the french toast (delish), warm chocolate cake (likewise), lemon tart (perfect if you like lemon), and banana panna cotta (not my thing, but it was free).\n\nNow, why only 4 stars when the food was such a magnificent experience?  The service perhaps?  No, no, the service was delightful--attentive, not overbearing.  The chef was overly generous and congenial with everyone in the restaurant as well (this + the food is reason enough to go).

We were expecting it to be a bit more stuffy but the ambiance was fairly casual.  The menu is setup for you to make your own multi-course meal with a fixed price making the prices very reasonable for food of this caliber.  The wine list is uninspiring without any great selections and no help from the staff.  \n\nThe food:\nFor starters we had the mesclun salad and Porcini Crusted Sweetbreads.  The salad was served with Fried Camembert and Pistachios and was quite large.  The sweetbreads can be served as either and appetizer or entree and I found it perfect as an appetizer.  It came about crispy yet lite with an excellent mushroom truffle sauce.  I opted for the small fish course which was a scallop served in a fish sauce with bulgur.  The scallop really missed and the bulgur just didn't need to be on the plate.  That being said, the fish sauce was a hit but probably could have worked better as a soup.  For entrees we ordered the Monkfish and Skatefish.  The monkfish was served over a pesto risotto and was perfectly cooked.  The Skate Wing was served in a Grenobloise sauce with fingerling potatoes.  I would recommend either of these fish dishes.  \n\nService:\nAlthough their seemed to be a large waitstaff, they seemed constantly unprepared and lost.  Our waiter didn't know the specials and didn't help very much in our food selections.  He always seemed to be bringing more silverware that didn't make sense.  He would come out with forks and then return a few minutes later with spoons, then knives, all separately.  Someone else ordered a steak to share with they brought out to show the table.  It was meant to be carved on a cart nearby but the cart had no knife.

My brothers and sister came together to surprise our Dad for his birthday this year and I've always heard such great reviews about this place I couldn't resist!  \n\nWe were a group of 8 and had a nice table set up for us in the back.  It's a cozy restaurant. The tables and chairs are pretty close together.  The ambiance is nice, not too loud and not too dark.  \n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and brought two of our own as well.  Our server was very nice and made an effort to accommodate us as much as possible which I appreciated.  \n\nWe each ordered the prefixed menu option 1 and a couple of their specials as appetizers for the table. \n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\nFoie Gras: Delicious!! The sauce was perfect and mixed with the sliced apples added a nice flavor and a better overall texture.  \n\nAhi Tuna Salad: very nice display, the ahi melted in your mouth\n\nMussels: The sauce was tasty!  It comes with this large pesto/garlic covered french bread crouton and they pair it with some pomme frites.  The server recommended that we dip/soak the fries in the muscle broth and my gosh that was a pair made in heaven!  \n\n\nSPECIALS:\nWe ordered a couple entree sized specials for the table - a scallop risotto.  For an entree size, it was still relatively small - it came with 4 scallops on top of a bed of creamy risotto.  Kind of reminded me of cream of mushroom sauce and rice - but of course much better than that :)\n\n\nENTREE:\nFilet Mignon - I had the filet mignon medium rare and a few others at the table ordered the same dish, except they added the bone marrow.  I'm not a fan of bone marrow so I can't give any kind of accurate description of that except that it looked cool, but I still wouldn't eat it.  The meat was perfect - very juicy, not too rare but exactly how a medium rare steak should be.  The filet itself is known to be the nicest cut of the meat, and this was no exception.  I can't even remember what it was paired with but who cares, if it didn't come with anything else I'd still order it.\n\nDESSERT:\nThis is the only reason why I had to take off one star.  When I made this reservation, I read a yelp review that mentioned their souffle and I thought, YES, finally Souffle!! My whole family LOVES LOVES souffle.. in fact, sometimes after eating out we contemplate going to Mortons just to order one of their souffles.  Let's face it - a souffle is not easy to get and not many restaurants have them because you need an on-site pastry chef.  A tip for all you souffle lovers out there: YOU NEED TO CALL AT LEAST 24 HRS PRIOR TO YOUR RESERVATION IF YOU WANT TO ORDER A SOUFFLE AT YOUR DINNER.  Contrary to the normal \"30 minutes advanced notice\" only applies to restaurants with an on-site pastry chef.  Actually, that was the first question I asked when we were seated - \"we're going to order souffle\".  I was seriously crushed when I was told the sad news.  I wish I had known that was an option!  I guess I just figured that an upscale FRENCH restaurant would serve souffle :(  Instead I ordered their chocolate lava cake which was a total mistake haha. Not a fan.. but nothing comes close to what I wanted.\n\nThe creme brulee was good, same taste as it should have - no complaints there.  My sister had the Baked Alaska but wasn't a huge fan.  The rest ordered the sorbet or the chocolate cake - but since I started the rumor that they had souffle the chocolate cake didn't stand a chance.  My mom on the other hand ordered their french toast.  Who would have thought something that sounded so simple could have such a unique and amazing taste!  Actually, her dessert came out after everyone else finished theirs for some reason, which didn't matter much to her because she was full, and so were we... but once we had a taste of that toast, we all chowed down like we hadn't had a meal in days.  \n\nThe chef also came out to shake everyone's hands and introduce himself which I thought was very nice of him to take the time to do that.  He must love what he does and it's nice that he came out to actually see everyone who was dining there.  Very nice touch.  \n\nI had to take down 1 star solely based on my disappointment on their dessert.  I would definitely come back again.  Try it out for yourself and PLEASE - when you make your reservation, pre-order that souffle!", "author": "Melissa G."}

Of course Phillipe, the owner/chef, greeted us (as well as almost everyone who came in). We had a table for six and all enjoyed our meals. The wine list is VERY reasonable with selection that won't drain your wallet. \nBTW, I was here on a very busy pre-Xmas night.

Every dish was simply French, marvelous, well-executed and nice balance of flavors and textures. We each had a 3-course pre-fixe menu, consisting of the best dishes. The skate special was definitely the highlight of my meal. \n\nThe service, however, did not match the cuisine. Service was inattentive and incompetent. My dining companion and I were happily and warmly greeted by the French maitre d'/chef/owner? as we walked in on a bustling Friday evening. Contrastingly, our server listed the day's specials in a robotic, rehearsed soliloquy. After ordering, we waited for nearly an hour before receiving our first course. By that point, we had gone through two baskets of bread and finished our large glasses of wine. Every other table seated in our section, who sat down and ordered after us, were already eating their main courses. We finally had to say something to our busser, who sincerely apologized and brought us an amuse. Meanwhile, our server had clearly forgotten about us and never acknowledged it, continuing to speak and act in a concocted fashion. \n\nWhen we left the restaurant and were already halfway down the block, the French maitre d'/chef/owner? chased us to say goodbye and thank you, which was very touching. While I don't feel as horrible spending money on this dinner at Chapeau since the food was amazing and the French guy was welcoming and sweet, I am turned off by the service and this particular server.", "author": "Kadie C."}

I had the tuna tartar, which is ALWAYS great. My main course was the Cassoulet de Toulouse. It was very hearty and filling....I had a LOT of leftovers (and unfortunately for me, I forgot them on the table!). My friends had the Bouillabaisse (which no one new how to pronounce) but it looked delicious. I wish I had ordered that instead. For dessert, I had the Floating Island. It is basically ice cream with this amazing caramel dome. It was so beautiful I didn't want to eat it. Plus, it's a lot of hardened caramel that isn't so appetizing after the first nibble. Presentation is definitely exquisite. If you come here and order a prixe fixe meal, expect to stay at least 2 hours for a comfortable dinner. \n\nOne thing I wish they had held onto from the last location, was that they would give you your receipt in a hat.

The mister got the Menu 1 ( which contains one appetizer, entree and dessert) . I got the Menu 2 ( which has one appetizer, a tasting fish , entree and dessert) alongwith the Colonel (which is a palette cleanser. \n\nMister's Menu1\nAppetizer - Trio of Salmon\nHe said that this was his least favorite of all the things he had ordered because the salmon did not taste fresh\n\nEntree-  Rack of Lamb \nIt was delish. It was done just right and accompanied by a gorgeous sauce and a potato au gratin\n\nDessert - Fruit plate in a coconut flakes cup\nThe mister said this was the best thing ever. It had a creamy custardy base topped with seasonal fruits in a toasted coconut flakes cup . I was too busy eating my dessert that  I never tried his dessert but judging by the sheer delight on his face :) I could tell it was good\n\nMy Menu2\nAppetizer -Veal Sweetbreads\nPLEASE order this. The first bite into the sweetbread and you  know you are eating high quality stuff and the sauce was to die for.\n\nTasting fish \nThe tasting fish was fixed and it was a scallop surrounded by a bed of pesto risotto. Need I say more. The risotto was cooked to perfection and the scallop was just right , not chewy but felt just right .\n\nPalette Cleanser- Colonel\nThis was a lime sorbet with vodka. It was sharp, cold and set me up for my entree \n\nEntree-  Filet Mignon (medium) with Bone marrow\nI am not a bone marrow fan but the mister is and we ordered the bone marrow (You pay an additional 6$ if you order the bone marrow) . Once again the meat was cooked to order and it came with a great sauce but what struck me most were the cubed potatoes. These were baked and fried I think but they were so delish.\nThe bone marrow however I think is a waste of money. Our bone did not have enough marrow in it \n\nDessert - Profiteroles\nI have a soft corner for Profiteroles ( That's an understatement !) . I love it when I bite into the puff and then I am hit with the cold cream and the chocolate sauce . Never go wrong with it. This was another winner.\n\nThe bill for two was around 175$ which includes additional amounts for  a few glasses of wine as well.\nLoved the ambiance and the price point for the quality of food you get here is great. The executive chef was there to say us goodbye on our way out .\nWill we come back here ? -  I think we will .\n\nPS: I loved the small flower holders on the tables.

For starters, we made sure each item on that Appetizer menu was on our table. I ordered the Mesclun Salad with Creme Dijonnaise.  A combination of greens, pistachios, and grapes in a unique dressing gave it a rich and sweet taste. When eaten with the Fried Camenbert , it tasted even better! I also had the pleasure of tasting the Escargot de Bourgogne in Butter-Parsley & Garlic Sauce, Trio of Salmon, and the Soup of the Day. All of which tasted pretty good.

It's such a cute little spot with simple but pleasant decor. The service was just great and the meal was wonderful. Honestly, it should have been a 4 for me. Here's the rub. We each spent $100, so we expected a superior dining experience in all ways - including respectful diners. Midway through our meal, a group sat down next to us, including an older couple. Immediately upon sitting, they turned on their phone with a loud video of some performance and passed it around for viewing. For a while, music was simply running on the phone. To add to this concert, a larger family then sat down on the other side, including 3 small children under 3 (at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night - oh joy). To keep them occupied, since apparently they felt this was their own dining room, all 3 kids had their own phone or tablet going at full volume. At a look from me, the loudest one was turned down, but all kept going. When I got her attention, I said something to the waitress (also seemed to be a manager or owner) and she acknowledged it. I'm not sure if she did anything, because we gave up and just had to leave. The people seemed local so if this is habitual or acceptable behavior there, I would caution people looking for a quiet, romantic place for dinner. It ended up making it more like a cafe in a train station. I'll give the restaurant a chance to comment on this as I don't want to ding them if this was an isolated incident.

Settled on Chapeau and did not regret it one bit.  \n \nWe were the first there with our early reservations, Wicked was at 8, so we had the restaurant to ourself.  Compact, like most in Frisco, but enough room to be comfortable.  Soft lighting, quaint, and not too loud, great for a nice dinner. Chef greeted us personally, a nice little touch restaurants often overlook.\n\nOkay, on with the food.  Appetizer was foie gras was delicious, served with microgreens, apple crisps, and cider glaze.  Fatty but melt in your mouth delicious.  We cleaned the plate.  The warm bread is lightly toasted before reaching the table, and you can appreciate good bread.   \n\nAlthough a small menu, the quality over quantity.  Do 7 things and do the damn well an old man once said.  I had the filet mignon, and I NEVER order steaks unless at a steakhouse, but the lady swayed me into it.  HANDS DOWN, BEST piece of steak I've had in my life.  Medium rare, cooked to perfection, all the juices locked in.  Served with diced potatoes, perfectly seasoned with a nice bite but not mush in the middle.  Its the little details that enhance the meal so much more.  Dont ever overlook the potatoes.  The accompanying oyster mushrooms and au jous were also perfect.  PERFECT!!!  The steak deserves a page, but i'll stop there.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered Wild Caught Skate Wing in a brown Butter, Fingerling Potato Sauce Grenobloise/ Mache.  Its like fish in a lemon, caper, butter sauce but a great change for the taste buds.  She loved her fish as did I.  It was a great contrast to the steak, and we like to share our food, so it was nice mix.  The skate wing is tender and moist, much like striper meat.  Again, the potatoes were delicious. \n\nFor dessert, we had warm chocolate cake with banana flambe and caramel sauce.  Light and very gooey.  Very good, nothing crazy, but good.  I wouldn't mind trying the napoleon, that sounded good too!\n\nService, trust the yelpers, service is impeccable.  I am a sucker for water, and my water was never empty.  A big plus was we got a refill on bread without asking, that never happens.  Owner is on site, so she makes sure service and food is always on par.  Again, little details make a the dining experience so much better.\n\nOkay, it gets better.  The final damage, with two half glasses of wine, 2 entrees, appetizer, dessert, all under 100.00 dollars.

The restaurant was still packed when we showed up for our 8:30 reservation and we were seated immediately...by the head chef/owners himself!  He then stopped by several times during our meal to be sure we were enjoying everything and he mingled throughout the restaurant, never stopping.  This same level service happened the last time we dined here in September 2008 when the location was still called Clementine's (same owner).  \n\nFabulous service aside, the food was out of this world.  My date and I started with foie gras (I was surprised that it wasn't on their online menu, so I called the restaurant to be sure they had it available...the hostess said, \"but of course!\".  We were sold.)  \n\nWe also tried the goat cheese appetizer and for entrees we drooled over porcini encrusted veal sweetbreads and the filet.  The meat was so so mouth-watering, that my boyfriend and I almost didn't want to talk to each other in fear that we'd miss one of the flavors.  We ended the dinner with the cheese plate (a must!), but I'm sure one of the other 5-6 dessert options (including a creme brule I was eying on the table next to me) would have been just as perfect to end the dinner.  \n\nAfter we paid the bill (which was reasonable), the chef/owner called a cab for us and waited by the door chatting with me until the cab showed up.

If Chapeau will give you anything, it's sincerity and an incredible atmosphere. \n\nNow on to the food: the four of us all ordered the prix fixe menus. The dudes got the 4-course and the ladies went with the 3-course. I personally got the vegetarian prix fixe because you can't lose with veggie food (not a fan of meat). \n\nMy meal was incredible. It started with the warmed brie, which included lots of yummy things under warm melted brie. It was sosososo good. My entree included many grains, veggies, fruits, and a yummy curry sauce. What a beautiful blend of foods. \n\nEveryone else ordered the fish, the duck, and other stuff. My friend ordered the flounder. Her issue was the smelly mussels that came along with them. They smelled rank and she couldn't eat with them on her plate, but they immediately removed them and replated her food. My husband liked his porcini crusted veal sweetbreads, tasting fish (scallop on pesto and lobster sauce), and duck breast. Although all were good, he said none of it was amazing. \n\nDessert was great. I would recommend my husband's choice of the chocolate cake over my french toast choice. The french toast tasted exactly like my homemade version, so I was kinda kicking myself for ordering it. Tasty, yes. Unique, no. The chocolate cake was killer. \n\nPrices were reasonable for a French restaurant, especially with the amount of flexibility you're given with the prix fixe menu. We came out of here with the menus + corkage fee ($18) for about $50 each not including tip. Not bad, considering the quality, selection, and atmosphere. \n\nWhat IS amazing in this place is Phillipe. He lives here, which makes you feel like you are coming into his living room. In fact, he was sitting around with some French friends talking soccer (I think, my French is limited) at the table next to ours. They were eating the same food we were and we felt so at home.

Then they moved locations, while keeping the old one open, and the 3 star review I gave was for a night we went to the old location while Chef Philippe was not there.  Color me shocked that having an amazing chef actually in the kitchen makes a difference.\n\nOn to the new spot.  There is definitely more space, though overall the space is still rather small and the tables are still packed in (get over it people).  The decor is much better and very warm and inviting.\n\nOne of the true joys of the old place was that Chef Philippe would always personally check on how your meal was.  In fact, in one previous trip, we had missed him seeing us after the meal, and were a bit disappointed.  We were a full block down the street to our car, when a screaming French mad-man came running down the street waving and yelling \"wait!\" (I'm not kidding - one of my all time most memorable restaurant experiences).  He caught up to us panting, to thank us and ask how it was.  The dude actually cares that you had a great time.\n\nBack to the new location, he is in the dining room much more than he used to be, which scared me  slightly at first (who's watching my food!).  This fear turned out to be unfounded as the food was fantastic.\n\nWe were supposed to share apps, but consider me a greedy bastard when it came to his preparation of sweetbreads.  Absolutely delicious and a must try.  The escargot were great, the foie gras was delicious, and his french onion soup was stunning.  And that is just the apps!\n\nThe preparation of halibut, with leeks potatoes and a \"mussel sauce\" was outstanding.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  I can't really ask for more.  Someone had the Filet, though it was clearly so good that this greedy person wolfed it all down, so I didn't even get to try it.\n\nThe desserts were great as well.  The chef recommended the \"french toast\".  The lady bit, and I must say I was really blown away.  With a caramel sauce surrounding it, and hazelnut ice cream on top, it was a real show-stopper.\n\nOverall:  Fantastic!  Can't wait to go back, and so glad my faith is restored!", "author": "Andrew M."}

Period. Hands down.\n\nThe colonel was perfectly refreshing.\n\nThe cassoulet was outstanding, with a perfectly cooked wing of duck.

Both my bf and I ordered off the Menu 1 (one appetizer, entree, and dessert for $38... quite the deal). I ordered the Pork Tenderloin, and I have to admit I was a little bit skeptical when our server told me they typically serve it medium rare. I took my first bite and WOW! (Chapeau! haha) - very unexpected but very pleasantly surprising. That's what sums up their food here. It's outstanding.

I ordered the filet minion medium rare. It was overcooked and a little dry! The mushroom was the star of the dish, not the meat....The service was bad! Our waiter did not even greet us and showed an attitude when we didn't order any wine or cocktail, even when we ordered 3-course menu for each of us. He never smiled and left our table full of bread crumbs during dinner. When dining there, we also saw the waitress yelling at elderly customers asking if his food is ready: \"It's coming\" and walked away. We also saw a couple just walked in, and about 10 minutes later, they just left without ordering anything. Then the waiter came over and asked the customers at the table nearby : \"Did you say anything to her (the female customer who just left)?\", which was so inappropriate and unprofessional. It was hard to find parking around the restaurant as well. There's no valet parking. I gave two stars instead of one because the atmosphere and lighting were great. The bread was warm and tasty.

I came here with a couple friends and we shared each of our prix fix menus.  Some of the best Onion soup I have ever had, it was nice and crusty with the crouton and cheese making a mega flavor seal on top.  Duck Breast was done just right to keep it juicy and tender.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-13", "description": "For the price, I've never had a better meal. My wife, her father and I ate here last night and everyone absolutely loved Chapeau! \n\nThe night started wonderfully, as we strolled in without reservations and were immediately seated. We got in at just the right time, around 7:30 PM, as the diners coming in shortly after us did have to wait to be seated.\n\nEverything we had this evening was beautifully presented, and the service (from our waiter Charles - good sense of humor) was excellent. His food recommendations all came through perfectly. \n\nThe owner came and greeted us personally as appears to be his routine, but his charming demeanor felt genuine. He also kindly bid us farewell on the way out, asking if we had enjoyed our meal. \n\nWhile the Yelp entry lists this restaurant as casual, you'll want to wear a nicer outfit, if only to blend in with those who dressed up for the evening.\n\nAs other Yelpers have mentioned, the dining room is attractive, but cramped. You'll be sitting close to other parties, particularly if you're located along the wall in the bench seating.\n\nOn to the meal! Here's what we had:\n\nDiner 1: Menu 1 (Prix Fixe) - appetizer, entree, dessert for $38\n\nAppetizer: Day's special soup (not on menu): A sweet corn soup with Dungeness crab topped with white truffle oil. Delicious! My wife couldn't stop helping herself to spoonfulls of this tasty, creamy soup.\n\nEntree: Bacon Wrapped Natural Pork Tenderloin w/ Parsnip Puree and Braised Green Swiss Chard in an Apple-Calvados Sauce. Yum! The puree was very buttery and sweet, while the pork tenderloins were cooked just as I wanted. The sweet apple-calvados sauce was also on the sweet side, but tasty. \n\nDessert: Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee - Creme Brulee is my favorite dessert and this one didn't disappoint. A good-sized portion, and very tasty. The caramelized top layer was crisp without tasting burnt. Well done. \n\nDiner 2: Vegetarian Fixe Menu $38\n\nAppetizer: Fourme d'Ambert Tart. Frisee Salad, Anjou Pear, Balsamic Reduction. This was a lovely little croissant-like pastry topped with salad. Flaky pastry, delicious.\n\nEntree: Deep Fried Polenta/ Ratatouille \"a ma facon\"\nYellow Corn & Heirloom Tomato Fricassee, Yellow Corn Bisque. Her absolutely clean plate showed that this Ratatouille was a crowd-pleaser. \n\nDessert: Sorbet Trio w/ Hazelnut basket and apple compote. The tart mango-passionfruit sorbet was the tastiest, while the lime and blackberry sorbet were also delicious. The hazelnut basket and its apple-y contents added a pleasant change of texture when broken up and blended into spoonfuls of the cool sorbet.\n\nDiner 3:  \n\nP.E.I. Mussels Soup: Creme Fraiche, Parsley & Garlic Croutons. The tiny little croutons were a hit, while the mussels were perfectly prepared. Lovely.\n\nWild Caught Skate Wing in a brown Butter, Fingerling Potato Sauce Grenobloise, Mache. We've never actually had skate before, but the waiter recommended it as his favorite. He wasn't kidding, this was one of the tastiest fish dishes we'd ever sampled. The skate absolutely melts in your mouth. We agreed that this was the best entree of the evening and would definitely be ordering it again.  \n\nWe were presented with an amuse bouche as well. While I can't exactly recall what it was, I believe it was a spoonful of scallop in an anchovy paste. Very delicate, quite tasty.   \n\nThe Zinfandel we ordered with our meal was very nice and reasonably priced. ($39)\n\nWhile the food wasn't brought out quickly, the wait wasn't unreasonable and our waiter was very attentive. Even the bread scored highly with these diners, as our baskets were refilled by a hot, fresh loaf with regularity, making the wait that much easier.\n\nWe had an excellent meal and will be coming back again soon.", "author": "Gerald V."}

I was so excited; I love French cuisine. More so, I love the Californian infusion of French cuisine. On top of that, I love a good prix fixe menu and a reasonable corkage fee. Needless to say, I was giddy when I got there.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite charming. It's warm, cozy, has a cute bar and the wait staff is unpretentious and attentive. The menu had one vegetarian dish, two fish entr\u00e9es and a fair amount of meat. The appetizer menu was what got me the most excited. I went with the 3-item dinner and picked the Fourme D'Ambert tart as an appetizer, salmon with heirloom tomatoes/sweet corn/basil (albeit out of season?) as my entr\u00e9e and the French Toast dessert with Caramel sauce & Hazelnut ice cream.\n\nThe tart gets 5 out of 5. It was perfectly baked and I loved the frisse salad, it cut the richness of the cheese very well. The entr\u00e9e was okay, I had it prepared medium rare but I was quite disappointed when it came out. It was light pink at best, and I suspect it was farmed and not wild. I'd give my entr\u00e9e a 3. The use of out-of-season vegetables and fish that isn't of the highest quality at this price point is a little disappointing. The dessert was good but too heavy, I'd give it a 3. I felt that overall the dishes were very heavy-handed with the sauce & salt.\n\nThe Chef came out to introduce himself and gave me some wonderful tips on how to pan-roast the perfect piece of fish (the salmon itself WAS perfectly cooked). The owner of the restaurant is on the floor, reading you the specials and being fabulous and friendly in general. I really, really wish that all restaurants had such an attention to customer service because it makes the overall experience so much more personal. I swear after I spoke with the chef, my entr\u00e9e tasted better.\n\nOverall, there are plenty of restaurants in SF that are better, fresher and cheaper. However, the service is unmatched. This would be a great place to take your parent or grandparents from Out Of Town - the crowd is on the mature side and I think the food is designed for the palates of a crowd like that.

They do an excellent job of pairing sweet flavors with salty, and tart with spice. While I was waiting for my appetizer they bought me out a complimentary creamy asparagus soup.  A perfect way to start my meal it was simple, subtle, and delicious.  \n\nI ordered the smoked rainbow trout with anchovies and potatoes, followed by the pan-seared duck over a sage polenta and caramelized pears.  Both were superb; the anchovies were perhaps a tiny bit too strong for the delicate trout, regardless the flavor combination was fabulous.  My duck was delicious; the smooth delicate sage polenta brought out the richness of the meat, which was complimented by the sweet lightly caramelized pears!!!\n\nMy plan was to skip desert since I'd been quite gluttonous the last few days.  However, my heart told my mind to shut up when I caught a glimpse of a hot chocolate souffl\u00e9 floating by my table.   I ordered one of course; it was super rich and deep.  Maybe it wasn't the best souffl\u00e9 I've had in my life, but it was just perfect with the little scoop of banana gelato they serve it with!  IMO Chapeau excels above most other french restaurants by playing creatively with conflicting flavors.  \n\nThe waiters, staff, and manager all did a great of making me feel at home, I felt as if I was at good friends for dinner.\n\nAn unexpectedly terrific meal from start to finish.", "author": "Ben J."}

It was Clementine before!\n\nWe walked in and received a warm welcome and handshake by the chef.  I believe he is the owner also.  We didn't have reservations, so we had to sit at the bar.  Service was nice.  We had the early bird dinner special.  Received some french bread while we were waiting.  For appetizer, we had the escargot (the garlic butter sauce soo good!.. what happened to the shells? lol) and mesclun salad with fried camenbert cheese (the highlight of the salad for me!), creme dijonnaiase, grape, and pistachios with walnut bread (bread was okay).  For our entrees, we had the mussels and cassoulet de toulouse (canellini Beans/ Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder/\nDuck Leg Confit/ Garlic & Toulouse Sausage ).  The mussel had a nice white wine sauce and were extremely fresh, the fries were average.  The cassoulet was okay.  It wasn't my preference, but I didn't know what to expect given that it was the first cassoulet I ever tried.  It was a dish full of beans with a duck leg confit.  It had a baked crisp crust on top, that was addicting good though! For dessert, the vanilla bean creme brulee and profiteroles were amazing!! This was a nice finish to a pleasant dinner! The profiteroles were drenched in a dark chocolate sauce, and were not too sweet! Perfect! As we walked out, we noticed a couple ladies eating the floating island dessert...ill have to try it next time!! It looked like a work of art with a dome shaped sugar like web that you need to break in order to get to the flan like piece in the middle!\n\nWhat makes this place different from many other restaurants is the chef being very hospitable, greeting everyone as they come and go with hugs, french kisses, and handshakes.

To start, the service alone is enough of a reason to give it 5 stars.  Without even knowing that my friend was a dinner guest, the owner saw her struggling to park her car and actually physically parked it for her!  My other guest showed up early & was kindly greeted and seated.  The owner had NO idea that she was going to his restaurant and my friend had no clue he was the owner! Random act of kindness! Honestly, the owner was the sweetest, warmest, and most down to earth person ever. Now to the food, it was AWESOME!  Escargot was yummy--every last drop of butter/parsley was dipped with tableside bread. Filet mignon was perfectly tender. The quail was the most tender I've ever had! All the wines were served were perfect. Even though it's a French restaurant, it still retains that essence of refinement yet it's warm and inviting. Really, I attribute that mostly to the owner/staff!", "author": "Cindy C."}

Butter, cream, garlicky wine sauces, decadent deserts...mmmmm. The chef is a wonderful man. He comes out to greet every single patron and took the time to tell me I should really scrape the marrow out of the bone from my meal. He brought me some herbed bread(mmm!) to spread it on.

We made reservations at 5:30, which got us the \"early bird\" special (Sun through Thurs, 5-6pm, $25.50 for a 3 course meal!!). We were pretty excited, especially since it is walking distance from our apartment. \n\nIt's a cute little French joint; the tables are quite close together but since it was early on a weekday, we didn't have anyone next to us for the entire meal. \n\nIt actually started out a little rocky... we were disappointed to see that, although the website had a \"best value\" type section of their wine list, the actual wine list had no such thing. In looking for a $35-40 bottle, we found a Pinot, and ordered it... well, we tried. Unfortunately, they had just sold the last bottle. She recommended another Pinot that was about $50... too pricey. We took another moment to look at the menu. We chose a $40 bottle of a blend of something with Cab Franc. We ordered it... well, we tried. Unfortunately, they were sold out of this wine as well. This waiter recommended another wine that was almost $60. We tried again, and ended up with a delicious Malbec in our price range. Third time's the charm?\n\nLuckily, things went WAY up from there... and we figured that since this place is 4.5 stars on yelp, our unfortunate wine luck was not common. We ordered, and they brought us out a cauliflower and truffle soup (on the house)... it was AMAZING. I could have just had that for dinner! Then, out came the appetizers... a spinach salad for my fiance, which was your standard spinach salad, and escargot for me. I was nervous--never had escargot... I was NOT disappointed. It was AMAZING! So perfectly cooked, tender, and the flavors of the rosemary and garlic... amazing compliments. I was in awe. \n\nThen, the entrees. The lamb cassoulet  was rich, heavy, and delicious. I was glad my fiance ate it as I'm not sure if I could have finished it, but the flavors were amazing. I got the duck breast... also unbelievably good, and perfectly cooked. I want more now just thinking about it! Eat it with the pears (like, in the same mouthful). I felt like a judge on Top Chef and was totally amazed at how well the flavors complemented one another. I actually neglected my wine while I was eating... that is how you know food is REALLY good... when I forget to drink my wine!!\n\nFinally, dessert... Fiance got the red wine soup... yummy and light. I got the creme brulee. I hope you're ready for dessert if you get that, as the portion is HUGE. It was also amazing and creamy, and yes, I did finish it all.\n\nTo top it off, the service was perfect. Our water glasses (and wine glasses!) were never empty, and we had three people thank us and bid us goodnight as we left. Oh, and BONUS points for giving us the bill in a hat (Chapeau means hat in French). That was so cool. It was a great value, great food, great wine, great service... and I cannot wait to go back.", "author": "Bridgette A."}

We were greeted by a cordial and friendly Asian waiter upon our arrival but it took forever for the menu to arrive until hubby, who was annoyed by the wait, asked again for the menu and informed the Jr. Yelpers that Lesson #1:  the menu is suppose to arrive promptly when you are seated at a restaurant.\n\nThe place was already 2/3 full and buzzing with loud conversations.  We were glad that our table was right by the window, away from the backroom noise but it was too drafty even with a heavily draped door.  I kept bouncing my knees up and down trying to keep warm.\n\nMenu #1, 3 courses for about $38 and addition of $10 for the filet mignon and $6 extra for the rack of lamb.  You can get Menu #2, 4 courses and they'll add an additional apple sorbet somewhere in the 4 courses for $4 charge.  A tiny complimentary demitasse taste of cream of asparagus soup was nice.  I thought the French onion soup was a tad sweet and the cheese melted throughout the soup instead of a large clump on top of the soup.  The French bread was light and crispy, served with unsalted butter.  A bite of Hubby's  foie gras appetizer was delightfully soft and good, accompanied by slices of apples and decorated with carmel sauce on the bottom, it paired well with his glass of Napa Bordeaux. \n\nMy  Black Cod which was moist, cooked just right but didn't taste that good with the green olives and fennel.  Hubby thought the outside of his rack of lamb was not seared enough and stated that he preferred the rack of lamb at Bursa Kebob in West Portal.  \n\nJr. Yelper #1 enjoyed the chopped roasted potatoes with mushroom more than his filet mignon.  Jr. Yelper #2 thought the duck breast was good as well as the polenta and poached pears.  I tried 3 scoops of the apple sorbet instead of their trio of blackberry, lime and passionfruit.  Both desserts were served with apple sauce and a lace cookie holding a dollop of applesauce.  The apple sorbet didn't have as much flavor as the sorbet trio. The creme brulee had a lovely crunchy carmelized topping and was extremely rich and creamy.  Hubby's fruit compote (Basil Napoleon)  was refreshing and light, served with 2 cookie crisps.\n\nPrior to the owners of Chapeau! acquiring Clementine, I preferred the food at Clementine over Chapeau! but will now have to re-visit Clementine to see if the change in ownership has affected the food and service.  Chapeau! is a reasonably priced restaurant but I've had better French food at Epcot in Disney World if you can believe that.  \n\nLesson #2 for Jr. Yelpers - chew with your mouth closed and don't speak while chewing, and masticate the heck out out of your  food so you don't choke because your parents don't want to have to perform CPR in a small restaurant.  \nAnd Lesson #3, always thank your server and bus boy for serving you and refilling your water glasses.  They may not acknowlege it but they do appreciate it.", "author": "Ry T."}

This is now the sole location for Chapeau! The signs have not yet been changed. \n\nThe chef is the same and still comes out to personally greet each guest. The nicest Frenchman I've ever met. \n\nThis is not nouvelle cuisine. The portions are hearty and appropriate, based on the dish, and the ingredients are classically French. \n\nBeing a Thursday, we enjoyed the Early Bird Prix Fixe menu at $28/pp. \nWe ordered: \nRabbit pate with stewed prunes and grain mustard (special) \nEscargot in garlic butter \nMescal salad with breaded brie \n! \nFoie Gras (not part of the Prix Fixe) \n! \nPork Tenderloin \nCassoulet, avec duck leg, white beans, sausage, shredded lamb \n! \nFrench Toast avec Hazelnut gelato and caramel sauce \nCreme brule \nNapoleon avec kiwi, banana, strawberry, mango, basil-infused pastry cream \n! \nDecaf coffee (very good) \nWhite Tea (very good) \n\nThoughts on the food: It was all very good. I am not used to eating very rich food, so it was a lot to take in at once, but being a trained chef, I appreciate the quality, and the skill with which it was prepared. \n\nWe also tried dishes we normally wouldn't eat. I had always wanted to try snails. Not as creepy as I feared. These were not in shells, and sizzled  in lots of butter & garlic. The texture was like a smoked oyster or soft mussel. \n\nThe rabbit pate was a formed serving of shredded rabbit with some seasonings and ?walnuts?. The portion was quite large, and since it's eaten with bread, very filling. I only ate half. \n\nI might have enjoyed the foie gras more had I been able to drink a Sauternes with it, but alas, the migraine would not allow it. \n\nAuntie had the Pork. Mama & I each had a Cassoulet, which were excellent. The duck leg was fantastic - so moist, and the beans were perfect. The portion didn't look huge, but is so hearty that I could eat it 3 times. In fact, on a chilly night, just that and a glass of wine would be more than enough. \n\nI don't usually get dessert, but it was part of the \"deal-i-o\" so... \nThe French toast (why don't they just call it 'toast' here?) was a thick slice of fried brioche sitting in a pool of caramel creme anglaise, with a scoop of hazelnut gelato on top. \n\nThe toast was a bit heavy for me, but the ice cream had a very deeply toasted hazelnut flavor and a dense, velvety texture. I could lock myself in a room with a tub of that stuff, let me tell you. \n\nI had a brief moment of panic when the dessert was brought out avec lit candle, but praise Allah, they did not sing. \n\nThe service was excellent, but in my opinion, a little overzealous. I don't need my water refilled when it's 2/3rd's full. The tables are pretty close together and refills=waiter arms in your face/halted conversation.\n\nThe servers are very polite and patient.

The chef comes out often to check on everybody dining.  \n\nFood- I've had most of the entrees here(although they do change the menu often) and I've like all of them.  The Fish, the pork shoulder, the cheese, tuna tartar, trio of salmon, Duck, chocolate molten cake, and THE OYSTERS are my favorites!  So fresh!  \n\nJust had the Skate Wing on Friday Oct 16....AMAZING!!!  Super flaky and cooked perfectly.

It truly does live up to it's name. \n\nThe fiance and I went here to celebrate our anniversary after having read such great reviews about this place. We were promptly seated and surprised how packed the place was for an early Thursday evening. We decided to go with the tasting menus, which at $38 dollars for three courses is a steal! You get to choose any appetizer, entree and dessert off the menu. Great deal! I ordered the four course ($46?), which includes a tasting fish course, so we could try that.\n\nFirst appetizer was the tiger prawns. This dish was the star of the night. The salsa/remoulad in the middle was amazing. I ordered the pear tart with frisee salad, and it was very good - especially if you are a blue cheese fan!\n\nThe tasting fish that night was a seared scallop on a basil risotto with lobster sauce. The entire dish was superb, but the sauce was the winning element. Fortunately, they keep your bread basket full, so as to allow you to soak up any last trace elements of that sauce.\n\nThe entrees was where I took away a star. I ordered the halibut, and I was surprised by the presentation of it. While it was a great piece of fish, and good overall dish, the entire plate was beige. There wasn't a bit of color, aside from the red-ish sauce on the bread chip. A little addition of micro greens on the top would have given the plate more flair. Aside from that, it was just good. Not great, not memorable - and after the first two courses - a little disappointing. The fiance got the skate dish, which was better and had little bits of crouton for texture, but still not a memorable dish.\n\nFinally, the desserts were fantastic! The warm molten chocolate cake is such a sin, and only gets better when you find the gooey banana in the middle. I didn't really get the rum raisin ice cream with it though -- I'd be happier with just a plain vanilla. We also had the Basil Napoleon -- which was light, fresh and yummy.\n\nOverall, what a great experience! The service was always on point, great atmosphere and wonderful food. However, I didn't see the famed chef and wife that everyone speaks of on here. We'll definitely be back to find them, as this is our new go-to French restaurant.", "author": "Amanda D."}

Who does that?! I'm a firm believer in the subtle touch. If you can manage to greet and say goodbye to all your guests in a trendy hip happenin restaurant, you earn Jon's coveted 5 star rating. \n\nBesides the fact that when I first sat down, in the middle of a bustling Chinatown, I half thought I sat at the wrong restaurant because of the sheer number of Asians in this French restaurant. But sure enough the waiter's thick French accent was the real deal. Don't ask me what he said, I spent two hours trying to figure out what he was talking about. I've been to France and only learned one phrase which was Pardon Miseour... I forgot the rest. something with the check. \n\nAnyways on to the food! The presentation and quality of food served was beyond my expectation. And the dessert was freakin awesome. \n\nThe negatives and there are negatives. Is that my friend and I were running late and I called ahead to reschedule however the hostess was unable to make changes to our reservation. But when I arrived, there were freakin WALK-INS?!?!

Most of us paid close to $60  so I rate this place $$$$.\n\nService:\nMost of them seemed very fake and one of them seemed to be very snobby.  The host was the snobby one.  She didn't smile and threw the towel onto our laps.  The fake ones were the overly happy/trying to suck up to us waiters.  The only real person there was the busboy.  I gave them 1 star for just trying to fix my orders.\n\nFood:\nI'm pretty sure we waited 30 minutes for our food to come.  We were all full by the time our entrees came because we stuffed our faces with bread and butter during that wait time.\nCorn soup came with all our entrees.  Mine and person A's soup was cold/lukewarm.  I kept drinking it thinking that it was supposed to be that way until person D's soup came and it was hot as hell.  I was jealous, so I told our waiter that our soup was cold.  At first he didn't seem to believe me as he touched my bowl to see if I was telling the truth.  He did give us two hot corn soups after, so I'm happy.  I just wondered how can a high class restaurant like this serve cold food.  \nWhen I ordered my Bloody Mary, they told me they didn't have it.  However, the bartender tried to make it anyways.  It tasted very mediocre, but it was very sweet of him to have tried.  I also asked the waiter what color would my lamb be if it was medium rare.  He said, \"BLOODY\".  When it came, it was dry, light pink and overly salted....so I stole some duck breast from Person A :]. (I knew I should've asked for rare like I do at any other 2 star steakhouses. Rare = medium rare for newb chefs.) Their duck breast is pretty good at medium rare.  I really think the chef/owner should go back into the kitchen to help with cooking and serving the food on time instead of kissing customer's cheeks and giving compliments on their way out the door.  I also tried person D's salmon.  She liked it, but i thought it was dry and rough as hell.\n\nI just hope that their food was crappy because it was a busy night and we were just unlucky.\n\nOh well, never coming back again.", "author": "Irene C."}

We'd previously eaten here with friends and had one of the best (albeit most expensive) meals I've had in SF. With that excellent experience in mind, I was excited to see Chapeau on the Dine About Town list. We've been trying to save money of late so this was a bit of a splurge, but I figured it would be worth it to replicate that initial experience. Sadly, this one did not measure up. The cauliflower soup was incredible, but it went downhill from there. The salad had too much dressing and the ingredients didn't blend. My husband was unimpressed with his salmon appetizer. But perhaps the biggest disappointment was the entrees. My pork literally had no flavor. How you can wrap something in bacon without imparting any flavor, I don't know, but it was incredibly bland. My husband said his skatewing had a strange texture and was also lacking in flavor. Both the dishes had excellent sauces but they couldn't quite compensate for the poor quality mains. The profiteroles were excellent, but couldn't redeem the disappointing remainder of the meal. The service was also slow (albeit friendly) and the room was loud and freezing.\n\nWe left very disappointed. I can only assume that they skimp on the quality of the ingredients for DAT, which is unfortunate given that it isn't even *that* cheap.

Early Bird \n-available from 5 to 6pm everyday (except Fri & Sat) \n-only $25.50, that's cheaper than Dine About Town! \n-here's a sample menu since it mentioned \"changes every two weeks\"\nAppetizers: Spinach Salad, Veloute of Parsnip, Grilled Escargots, or Duo of Salmon \nEntrees: Prince Edward Island Mussels, Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon, Duck Breast Medallion, \nor Cassoulet de Toulusse \nDesserts: Red Wine Soup, Creme Brulee, Basil Napoleon, or Profiterolles \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nThis was a steal for the quality of food, the amazing presentation and attentive service. Everything we ate was beautiful AND delicious. Sometimes it's only one or the other but there was no compromise here. I chose:\n\nDuo of Salmon - gravlax wrapped around tartar with egg mimosa, fried capers, creme fraiche and micro herbs with lemon dressing. I LOVE salmon. I love it whether it's raw, cured, or cooked so this was the appetizer for me. The gravlax was perfect. The curing process brought out the flavors of the salmon wonderfully without it getting too salty. Tartar was solid. The dressing was creamy, not acidic which is how I prefer my dressing. The combination with the micro herbs, bits of eggs, and capers was just amazing in my mouth.\n\nDuck Breast Medallion - with sage polenta, pears & grapes and peppered duck sauce. I didn't think the knife they provided was sufficient but I will forgive them since they gave me another fabulous dish! The duck was succulent and came on top of the creamiest & dreamiest polenta I've ever had... The cooked fruit accents were wonderful. The pears had that grainy earthy texture and the flavor of its juices were intensified. The grapes were still firm and sweet as ever. \n\nBasil Napoleon - made with Maui pineapple, Manilla mango, banana, kiwi, strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream and feuille de brique (crisps). I usually don't go crazy over fruit based desserts because they always have the same flavors. But this dessert was on a level of its own! The fruits were finely diced and in perfect harmony with each other. The cream was light, flavorful and just heavenly. It was not overbearing and actually made the fruit taste better. A basil syrup was served with this dessert and even though it sounds strange, it worked! It was refreshingly sweet with only a hint of basil and mint. The crisps added another delicious contrast and completed this dessert. It was simply perfection!\n\nHow did I get all this for $25.50? GO NOW. I'm out of words!", "author": "Julia T."}

Reservations were easy enough to make, service was okay and the food was good for the amount you pay.  \n\nWe all opted for the four course meal (app, tasting fish, entree and dessert) which was a pretty good deal.  My personal favorite was the Deep Fried Black Tiger Prawns with Shredded Phylo Dough.  It was crispy and tender, a perfect starter.  I found the lobster bisque too smokey and the brussel sprout in the middle was very chewy and hard to cut into.\n\nThe tasting fish of the night was a seared scallop, of which I can never pass up.  It wasn't as seared as I had hoped, but good taste, nonetheless.  \n\nI was a bit disappointed with the entrees, as I felt there could've been more taste, being a French restaurant.  The duck was a bit on the tough side, and the flounder was a bit tasteless.  The special of the night, the skate fish, was good, but the flavors were a bit too powerful for the poor white fish.

I had the lamb chops with french lentils, which was excellent.  My husband ordered a fish dish, which was equally delicious and very interesting. The server also gave us great wine pairings for our meals. Chapeau offers prix fixe as well, so it can be relatively affordable for a nice dinner ($38/person).\n\nWe originally went to Chapeau when it used to be further west on Clement.

The area where we sat was being re-painted so it looked a bit raw, but the staff apologized repeatedly for it. Honestly, we didn't care....as long as the food was up to par. It's a casual yet refined space overall. \n\nFOOD: Truly delicious! So much pride in every detail. Totally authentic French. But for once, I didn't feel the need to go for a 5-mile run after gorging myself on buttery French fare, because our meal was NOT heavy nor overwhelmingly buttery. I had the trio of salmon for my appetizer, mussels and frites for entree, and basil napoleon (like an elegant fruit salad with crispy pastry rounds). All 3 were strong, perfect....and since we were there early at 5:30, we were able to have it all for only $28! Their early bird prix fixe! Highly recommended.\n\nOverall: we WILL be back -- again and again. This is truly a neighborhood gem, staffed by genteel and knowledgeable servers, with expertly prepared courses and that casual yet upscale neighborhood ambiance. If I HAD to come up with a complaint, it would be the music, which was turned up very loud. We got there early so it was still quiet, and the old French jazz standards were nice but just turned up too loud for my ears.

Being that we had a yummmmy brunch at 11 (at heavenly Foreign Cinema), a 5:30 pm dinner wasn't too early. So, when we get there, we were famished. \n\nWe started off with the Tomato Basil Bisque and the Mesclun Salad with creme dijonnaise, grapes and FRIED CAMENBERT. Let me repeat that... FRIED CAMENBERT that just melts in your mouth. Then for our 2nd course we had the Flounder and the Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with parsnip puree, braised green swiss chard. The flounder was cooked perfectly and placed on a bed of mashed potatoes, leeks, tomatoes and mussels-saffron sauce. It was RICH in butter and goooodness. The pork dish was moist and tender and the parsnip puree was just unbelievably creamy and sweet. \n\nOn to the 3rd course... Profiterolles and French Toast. Insert droooool here. I was expecting the Profiterolles to be sub-par... but it was sooooo delicious that I devoured the entire thing even though I already felt like I needed to be rolled home. And the French Toast dessert was drenched in a decadent caramel/syrup. They were both just heavenly. \n\nWe paired the dinner with a bottle of Cotes du Rhone wine and walked out paying less than my last pair of jeans. Oh, oh, oh... the cherry on top? The Chef came out throughout the evening to personally shake every patrons hand and thank them for dining at Chapeau! At the end of our meal, he came back to make sure we enjoyed everything and to invite us back.

Everything we had was a dream in your mouth. Salade Landaise with duck and fois gras to start, that was great. Prime rib was to die for; a touch drier than I might like but that's what happens when you braise to get that fantastic flavour. And it even came with the bone and marrow with a little spoon; very nice touch.\n\nThe only thing I wasn't crazy about was the tasting fish; the sauce was too rich and the butter and cream were obscuring the flavours of the scallop. But everything else, I couldn't believe how tasty it was. Even the bread and butter to start were top knotch. You know it's the real deal when they care enough to provide first rate butter at exactly the right firmness (temperature) along with fresh, tasty bread that is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and not too hard or dried out.\n\nService was also fantastic, very friendly and helpful wait staff but not pushy or in your face.

Honestly, better food than Gordon Ramsay in London for so much cheaper.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I spent one night in the city last week and got a recommendation to go here after we tried, and failed, to get a table at Gary Danko. Same day reservations.. got a great table. My boyfriend is in culinary school, so whenever we travel we try the best that city has to offer and San Francisco outshone a lot. Great, intimate atmosphere with very attentive servers.  \n\nHe started with the mussel soup, said it was the best he'd ever had. The broth is to die for.  I started with the Foie, which was very good. Served it with apples which I'd never had before. \n\nWe got the seafood sampler menu so next came the most incredible scallop I could have ever imagined. Lobster bisque base, pesto risotto (what???? AMAZING!!!!), perfectly seared scallop, and some kind of tomato mixture.  PURE HEAVEN.  \n\nFor entree he got duck breast with truffled polenta, which was great, and I ordered the lam shoulder with duck confit and cannelloni  beans. The portion on mine was enormous, like nothing I'd ever seen at a French restaurant, and it was quite delicious. \n\nFinally for dessert he got the chocolate molten cake and I got the creme brulee. The waiter told us the cake would be an extra 15 minutes, but they had made an extra so it came out right away. Awesome!! Best brulee I'd had in a long time.. beautiful consistency, not too burnt, with vanilla bean on the bottom.  \n\nService was great and the owner/ head chef was walking around talking to people. Our server called us a cab at the end of our meal which was great.  For both of us, with tax and tip, it was only $166... $334 cheaper the Gordon Ramsay.", "author": "Laura C."}

The striped bass was very good, but I liked the filet minion better. It is actually personal preference. The striped bass is very tender; not fishy at all, and I would recommend it for those of you who like eating without having to cut anything. The filet minion is also very tender, but costs a bit more. \nThe baked Alaska was very good, but I prefer the chocolate cake more because I have a sweet tooth. For those who don't like sweets very much, I recommend getting the baked Alaska. I haven't yet tried other desserts, so I have to wait to write about the rest. \nThis time that I went to Chapeau, the food was good, but the waiter D. Laurent, was a bit mean maybe because we look young or we are not French. He had a big attitude towards me and my boyfriend, but during the whole time we were there, we tried to be nice(Since it cost so much, we tried to make the best of everything). When we were ready to order, he ignored us for 20 minutes after he saw us raise our hand, and when he finally came to serve us, he seemed mad about something. I gave him a smile and ordered, but he was cold the whole time. The person who brought us our food was a lady, she was very nice, and at least she smiled. \nAfter eating our first course, there were a lot of bread crumbs on the table and when our server came to get our plates, he didn't even look at us. Then he went inside the kitchen and didn't even return to clean our table like the other server did. Then he went to the table next to us and acted very nice to them, he even smiled. This sort of made me mad, and I tried to get my mind off it by cleaning the bread crumbs off the table waiting for the dessert to come. When I was in the middle of putting the crumbs on the napkin, he came ans said \"I bet You got some on the floor\" then he rolled his eyes in front of me and my boyfriend caught it as well, and he walked away. This was probably the worst time I had ever had on a date at this restaurant. The whole time I was thinking what I did wrong, but then I realized he was probably just thinking I look like a kid.

Our waiter was very attentive and he opened the door for me and my date on our way out and shook our hands (I'm not sure if he was going to hug me or what).\n- The Filet Mignon was decent but nothing spectacular. The sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdinewas very good that came with it. Sauces aside, I felt that the meat of the veal medalion was tastier than that of the filet mignon.\n- The Veal Medalion with Chanterelles in a Veal Reduction was very juicy and tender. The sauce was on the lighter side. I wish the veal medallion came with the sauce that was served with the filet mignon. \n\nJUST OK:\n- The Porcini Crusted Veal Sweetbreads were good but like the filet mignon, it was because it came with a really good sauce. The sweetbreads were diced up into small cubes and then battered and fried, which ended up making the sweetbreads too crusty and fried because of the proportion of batter:sweetbread for each piece. \n\nBAD:\n- The parking in this area is TERRIBLE. I know parking sucks in SF but with the concentration of many restaurants in this 2-block radius, there is a huge demand for parking from diners. Give yourself an extra 10-minutes to find parking.\n- The escargot was very blah. It wasn't bad per se (because I love snails) but I definitely wouldn't get it again. It was probably canned snails (came shell-less) and were some of the smallest snails I have ever eaten. The standard butter-garlic sauce was fine but the whole dish seemed very unimpressive and I would have rather gotten a different appetizer that involved more skill and effort.\n\nCONCLUSION: A solid French restaurant with great service and moderate prices.

With soft color tone walls and service that is on key, the meal continued with grace.  \n\nFor the entree, duck meat cooked medium rare is fanned out bathing in a sweet and savory sauce.

What an amazing deal. \nI started off with the trio of salmon, which was mouth-watering. It came with salmon roe, which was a special treat. Robin had the escargot, which he devoured in minutes and sopped up with practically a whole baguettes worth of bread from the plentiful baskets continuously delivered to the table. Our main courses were the mussels which were drenched in a heavenly parsley, butter, and wine laden broth...mmmmmm, accompanied by and the most savory pommes frites and rouille. Also, the seared duck with saffron mashed potatoes. For dessert we had cr\u00e8me burlee, and a very creamy dish with roasted pistachios on top. It was to die for.\nThe service was very attentive, the chef came out to greet us and gave us complimentary cauliflower soup, which was light and fresh. The atmosphere is cozy and tasteful. We will be back for sure to try the foie gras!", "author": "Katie B."}

But it's a non issue unless you're seated next to someone who doesn't know how to use their inside voice.  I think the  size makes for a more intimate setting.  \n\nService is spot on, attentive without being overbearing. And the food, well I was smiling with every bite I took (it really was that good).  Prices are very affordable too, considering it's French food.  They offer a 3 and 4 course menu which is a great value and allows you to sample their menu w/out breaking the bank.  \n\nWe started with the complimentary Aspargus soup - very tasty, and perfectly creamy.  I had the smoked trout w/fingerling potato salad as my first course and this was so good.  All the flavors and textures went together so well.  Next was Mussels & Frites.  Classic pairing and their take on it was delicious.  Mussels were sweet and the broth was savory and seasoned well.  Frites were thin and crisp and I really enjoyed the alioli.   Seared duck w/polenta and pear was my choice of entree and this was quite tasty.  The pear gave the dish that perfect blend of tart against savory.   Dessert  (vanilla bean creme brulee) was a bit lacking (couldn't tase the vanilla bean) but still enjoyable. \n\nOverall a wonderful dining experience. Ideal for 'date night' or an intimate dinner w/your girlfriends. I can't wait to come back or check out their sister restaurant Clementine.", "author": "Dorothy F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-28", "description": "This little French bistro in the Richmond district is almost hidden from the street. I've been here twice and each time with different people and the feedback from my guests was consistent - good price for a 3-course pre-fixed dinner for moderate French cuisine, but the add costs on certain items on the menu and side order of foie gras were not worth it. \n\nI thought the French cuisine at Chapeau was not spectacular. Do they use good quality meat, seafood and vegetables? Yes, they do. Do they service with a smile and make the diners feel welcome and comfortable, they sure did. In fact, the executive chef himself was on the floor roaming from table to table checking on his patrons and occasionally chatting up a few conversations and when we were leaving the restaurant, he bid us farewell at the door and saw us off. On my second visit, we left without the knowledge of the chef, he even ran out of the restaurant to say goodbye to us on the street. Service was great! 5 stars for that. \n\nI'm afraid I couldn't say the same about the food. I could only appoint Chapeau 3 stars. No doubt the ingredients were good, but the execution was nothing to brag about. The $38 pre-fixed 3-course menu consists of an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert that you pick from their regular menu. Depending on which entr\u00e9e you pick, there might be additional costs to it. \n\nOn my first visit, I had the duck leg confit casserole with white beans, my guest has the rack of lamb cooked to medium rare. There was nothing impressive or particular outstanding about the 2 entrees that deserve to write home about. My casserole was very heavy and the flavor was a little bland. It was a dish meant for sharing because after a few bite, your taste buds are bored with the same taste and one texture dish - mushy beans and duck meat that was too overcooked that the meat was too soft. My guest's rack of lamb was fine, although slightly better than my dish. The portion was enough to satisfy our hunger. \n\nI gave Chapeau a second chance and returned the second time to try other things on the menu. On my second visit, I had the appetizer of duck breast with fris\u00e9e salad and surprisingly it was much better than the duck casserole entr\u00e9e. They should have just put that on the entr\u00e9e menu. My guest had the Trio of Salmon appetizer and the filet mignon and she thought both dishes were fine. Foie gras was on the menu, but with additional charge. We ordered one to share. The serving was small and a little undercooked for my taste. The foie gras has a little gelatinous texture to it and it wasn't seared well on the outside. \n\nDesserts were the typical tarts, cr\u00e8me brulee, and sorbet. Boring, boring, boring. \n\nIf you ask me will I go to Chapeau again, I can tell you without hesitant that most likely not. I know I seemed harsh on my review, but I had better French food and the city offers many French restaurants that have better French food, why go all the way out in the Richmond just for that? Your gas expenses and the time spent looking for parking on the busy Clement Street doesn't justify that.", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

This dish was a mess, a couple pieces of lamb, sausage, and duck leg thrown in with some pinto beans? overpowered by salt. The waiter asked if I wanted to take home the rest of my food. I said \"No thanks, this dish was too salty.\" Instead of acknowledging my statement, he says \"Ohhh yes, this dish is very powerful, many, many flavors.\" A few other mishaps and the waiter trying to be funny, but overcompensating for his lack of humor adds to this place being generic.

Good decision as there was just enough for all to avoid an all-out brawl for the scrumptious bites! We had both cocktails and 2 bottles of wine (a Pinot and a Chard) and had a blast! The 2 shortcoming that discouraged 5 stars were that we had to ask for refills of both water and their amazing bread.

French food usually isn't that affordable.  So you think... ok they must use rancid butter, clumpy cream, and they serve faux gras.  No, no!\n\nAnyways, I was really eager to come here after so many great recs.  The waiter told us the specials and the only real thing I chose to hear was \"Blah blah foie gras! bleh foofyblah...\" I didn't hear the part that it was an extra $6 if you wanted to apply it to the prix fixe.  Oh well, who cares, it was foieckin' delicious!  Caramelized, crispy fat basically sums up the texture.  The waiter eagerly came by and recommended a dessert wine that married perfectly with the richness of the foie.  I agreed to a taste.\n\nAfter doing so, my friends were laughing so hard... \"Chris!  Omg, you should totally see your face.  You have THE biggest smile right now.\"  It was entirely involuntary.  Same way a doc taps your knee for a reflex, good food knocks a big grin to my face!\n\nThe waiter continued to encourage me that this was so great and I felt very obliged to have a 2nd helping.  My entree was just as decadent .  I had the king of cuts - Filet Mignon!  Oh wow, a filet on a $38 prix fixe.  Excellent.  It was a tad salty and wasn't quite luscious like my past experiences and would have preferred it moo'ing a little bit more. \n\nThe bill comes... omfg... someone give me a chainsaw, it's gonna cost my left arm!  \n\nLike the foie gras, I failed to read that it is another extra $6 for the filet mignon (only item with that exception).  I should have known!  But with good food, I practically have horse blinders on.  And then... I really felt my teeny sample of the dessert wine was complimentary... like I thought it was just a kind gesture from Chapeau! that good food should be experienced this way.  But no another $6 gets tacked on for that small sample.  And I had a half of a half bottle of wine... $15 (for HALF of a HALF!!!)  So carry the 1, multiply by 2, and add my left arm, I paid about $80 just for me alone.\n\nHad the food been crap and the servers not as darling as they were, I would have protested at least over that sneeky dessert wine.

It starts off with the confirmation phone call made by the owner Philippe's wife, whose excitement about your presence is truly sincere. When you arrive at the quaint little restaurant, don't be confused once you walk through the doors -- yes, you'll be shrouded in darkness by a heavy velvet curtain and wondering where to check in. But like being in a doctor's examining room and not knowing when you'll be seen by him, in a few minutes, the owner flings the curtain open with a huge smile and greets you with hugs and kisses. In his adorable French accent, he asks for your name and assures you that your table is almost ready. \n\nThe restaurant is small, tables are inches apart, and above the elevated chatter of the patrons, you will hear the booming laughter of the animated owner who makes his rounds to each table, making sure everyone is enjoying themselves. He is truly a charming host, you feel like you're dining in his home.\n\nThe pre-fixe menu is an incredible deal, and all of the choices look wonderful, making it hard to decide what to order. I decided to go with the 3-course $35 dinner, having the fried jumbo prawns to start, seared monkfish with risotto in lobster bisque as my main, and the warm chocolate cake for dessert. Fiancee went with the 4-course $42 dinner, having the same prawn appetizer, the tasting fish which was a scallop over an open squash ravioli, filet mignon with potatoes entree, and the trio of sorbets for dessert. The prawns were fantastic, my monkfish was incredibly rich because of the risotto in lobster bisque so I only managed to eat half of it, and the warm chocolate cake was heavenly. I really enjoyed the filet mignon, which was cooked perfectly and the flavors weren't too rich. Each course was a bit slow to come out, so our dinner lasted for 2.5 hours. \n\nAs we left, Philippe was already outside chatting with friends, so when he saw us, he came over with open arms and gave us kisses and hugs goodbye, saying \"See you next time!\" It's always such a pleasure to meet people who genuinely enjoy what they do.

I tirelessly yelped and yelped for days (ok, maybe just like 20 minutes) searching for the right spot. I ruled out any place too sceney, hipstery, trendy or with a Danko-esque price list. \n\nChapeau!'s glowing reviews were the deal breaker. I called two weeks in advance and made a rather early reservation for five people.\n\nNow, I heard this place was small, but I wasn't prepared for the sea of heads I saw as I walked through the velvet curtains into the restaurant. They know how to pack the people in, that's for sure. I was a little bummed that our table was right in front of the door, so we caught every draft every time the door was opened, which was every two minutes being that the chef opens the door and welcomes everyone and opens the door to say goodbye to everyone. And if you thought I was bummed, you should have heard my mother.\n\n\"Brrrrrrr. Close the door! my feet are freezing! vrrrrrrr.\"\nYa, mom's pretty much a huge complainer, and isn't shy with the bossiness. hey, she's a Jewish mommy from Oakland, what do you expect? A mousy, petite woman who crochets and drinks tea? Paaaaaa-lease! I get me potty mouth and road rage from that woman.\n\nThe meal\nChampagne and wine were of course gorgeous, as champagne and wine tend to be\n\n1. cauliflower soup amuse-bouche....strong little treat that was perfect to dip my bread in\n\n2. warm brie over a potato pancake-type thing.....a didn't eat the whole thing because we were doing the \"sharing\" thing, but believe me, if it was my birthday I would have fought with fork prongs and elbows in order to horde that delicious bitch. ooooh, so yummy. I also enjoyed the goat cheese Napoleon.\n\n3. Bouillabaisse. I hate to be finicky, but from a restaurant that receives such high ratings, I was hoping for something more spectacular. The broth was really flavor-full and lovely. The clams and mussels were well cooked and flavorful, but the fish was way too fishy. Everyone who tasted it agreed with me. I really don't like fishy fish, which is why I never get salmon unless it's raw. My mother loved her fish (I think it was sea bass), my sister and brother-in-law got the cassoulet and  sirloin. They both preferred the beef. Dad got the pork wrapped in bacon (heart attack on a plate. He probably had to take the whole bottle of Lipitor that night), and said it was good, but he didn't even taste the bacon.\n\n4. I think the desserts were the hit of the evening. We had the vanilla creme brulee, warm chocolate cake, praline cake and the apple tart. The creme brulee and chocolate cake were drool-worthy good. I'm not a sweets person, but at this particular meal I was the one at the end of the meal with my spoon scrapping the edges of the plates. Licking the plates would have been a little embarrassing for the fam, so I restrained myself.\n\nThe servers were on top of the water, wine, bread, etc. But the service was really slow. Fortunately mom compared the meal to ones she had in France, which was a positive thing. She pointed out that since the food was so filling, it was a treat to be able to enjoy a long, leisurely meal where she wasn't stuffing her face.\n\nIt was also on the Chevy's-level loud side. My dad kept screaming over me to talk to me mom. There was a lot of ear cupping and repeating. \n\nBut the space is darling (the paint job is really cutsie and romantic), the service was delightful, the food was delicious, and the prices didn't force my dad to take a second mortgage out on the house. Not the most impressive meal ever, but I would definitely come back.", "author": "Sammy S."}

The expertise of the wait staff also had this old-world feeling - they were nearly invisible in their service, but impeccable at anticipating and filling our needs.  The place does not actually scream \"French\", which I liked (and honestly, from the name of the place I was scared that it might) - it just has an overall elegant yet very local feeling.\r\n\r\nThe food was perfection in its preparation, presentation, and flavor.  We started with the amuse-bouche of chilled melon soup, and a couple of glasses of yummy Cabernet champagne.\r\n\r\nWe both decided on the $35 menu:  which included an appetizer, main course, and dessert.\r\n\r\nCourse 1:\r\nMe:  Heirloom Tomato Salad - big, ripe slices of heirloom tomatoes in an olive oil and orange vinaigrette with toasted pine nuts.  Fresh and bursting with flavor - with just a hint of orange for complexity.  Delicious.\r\nDenise:  Mixed Green Salad - exceptionally fresh greens in a vinaigrette with Laura Chenel goat cheese both in bites in the salad and in the dressing.  Lovely.\r\n\r\nCourse 2:\r\nMe:  Veal Wrapped in Bacon - beautiful dish - large fillet of veal prepared med-rare, with bacon wrapped around it and topped with a sauteed sweetbread, all atop a portion of creamy garlic mashed potatoes.  The whole thing was surrounded by a wine/brown sauce with mushrooms and cipollini onions - the smell of it as it was set down on the table was so powerful that the diner next to me (and by next to me, I mean practically sitting on my lap!) asked me what the dish was.  It went beautifully with the earthy glass of Bordeaux that I savored.\r\nDenise:  Petit Poussin - tender pieces of poussin served atop julienned vegetables - truthfully, I was so into my dish, I barely remember this one except that I thought it was very good.\r\n\r\nCourse 3:\r\nMe:  Apple Tarte Grand-Mere - again, perfect.  Ultra thin layers of apple atop a custard filling, all in a shortbread crust.  Served with a dollop of hazelnut ice cream.\r\nDenise:  Warm Chocolate Cake - oooooozing dark chocolate, and great quality chocolate at that.  Served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream\r\n\r\nThe chef Philippe Gardelle greeted us at the table soon after we arrived, and then again as we were leaving.  It's nice to feel that you are truly appreciated, and I know we had genuine smiles on our faces after our wonderful dinner.\r\n\r\nGreat place for a date, dinner with the parents, catching up with a friend, or an upscale celebration.  The intimate nature of the restaurant makes it challenging for children.  Portions are ample but not overpowering, which we appreciated.  Definitely a great value considering the high level of service, quality, and overall experience.  This is a smooth operation, and they are experts in the dining experience.  The loyal clientele that had the place constantly full on a Tuesday night is an testament to Chapeau!'s word-of-mouth reputation as a great find in a less obvious neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI can't wait until my next visit - merci, Denise!

By the time we had driven around the block three times, things were starting to look a little dubious.  \"Are you sure there's really a restaurant out here?\"\n\nWe parked and walked, and soon the candlelit glow of Chapeau's windows came into focus.  Lights, camera, action!  My master plan of romance was coming to fruition.\n\nPhillipe, the chef and host, emerged from the kitchen with a warm hug and kiss, took our coats, sat us down and helped us choose our wine.  We poured over the menu devoutly, picking his recommended entrees accented with sweetbreads and foie gras.  By the time the warm chocolate cake arrived hours later, we were in a comatose state of euphoria.\n\nThere is something about French food that awakens the senses and melts the inhibitions.

My experience was like watching the last and final episode of the Soprano's Season 6. I wanted it to be mind-f*c'n great. Then the episode comes and goes leaving you with a cliff hanger and all you can say is WTF? It was good...just not mind-fokin' great like you expected. \n\nWell, that's how I feel about Chapeau! It was good, but it didn't give me that absolutely love this place feeling that would make me want to come back again and again until I'm all frenched out. I really expected to the moon and back good. I think I should have set my expectations low and maybe I wouldn't be complaining like a high class baby.\n\nI had the pre-fixe meal (appetizer, entree, and dessert) which was nicely priced at $39. \nAppetizer-Mesclun Salad: This was probably the best part of my meal. It was very tasty with little pieces of pistachio and grapes. The dressing was divine. Also, was served with two mini slices of walnut bread with a delicious portion of brie. Great starter!\nEntree-Striped Bass: I sat there thinking, I can cook this bass better. It was good, but if I can cook it better...then that's already a problem.\nDessert-Warm Chocolate Cake: Besides the little piece of the banana in the center...it was just as good as the volcano cake that you find in Trader Joe's frozen section.\n\nWhat I disliked the most is how close the tables are to each other. If I were to stretch or lean to the right, I probably smack the kind lady next to me. Also, as the waiters passed behind me or on the side of me, they were usually brushing me because the space was just too tight. Now, I would accept this type of setting at a cafe, but at a French restaurant with a fine dining appearance...I don't think so.\n\nDine here if you want a mediocre dining experience.", "author": "Liz K."}

For the price you get affordable French food. If you want a deal go for the early bird special during the first hour of opening. The restaurant isn't big and depending on where you're seated it's rather cramped. There's a sign asking you to not talk on your cell phone but the conversations people were having were far louder than any conversation one would have on their cell. \n\nWe decided to do the 3 course menu for $39/pp. I started off with the French Onion soup which I also had on the first visit. It didn't have as much cheese compared to the first visit but it was still delicious and one of the best I've ever had. For the main course I had the rack of lamb (+$10 more). To finish off the meal, I had the Napoleon which sounded impressive from the description on the menu but it wasn't that great. Napoleon is typically a layered cake but their version consisted of various fruit covered in sauce with three wafer crisps. At the end of our meal our waiter surprised us with a passion fruit sorbet and apple sorbet with a candle on top.\n\nService was prompt and efficient. Unused utensils and plates were replaced and the bread bowl never stayed empty for long. These days you don't see the chef as often as he's tending to his other restaurant at Clementine but the quality is still there.\n\nOverall, the experience was great and the food was good without breaking the bank.

If you go, try to go early to catch their early bird menu which is not a bad deal.  The tables are cramped (way too close together) and the sound level of the small dining area is loud.  The chef genuinely seemed to care and its funny to see him go out of his way to kiss female patrons upon their departure.  Although I didn't see him during my recent visit, the sommelier there years ago (not sure if he's still there) took it upon himself to drink a sizeable amount from each bottle, way more than is the norm, even for a sommelier.  During a business dinner, my associates were cracking up at how much he was having.  \n\nOne dinner at this restaurant that I will never forget was because of the hostess last year.  I believe she is also the wife of the chef/owner.  She was asian, but had a French accent all night.  Now thats fine, but when some neighboring customers politely complained about their disatisfaction with the location of their table, she was extremely rude and her accent magically went away.  I have to admit, it was pretty hilarious.  Ever see the Flintstones episode where they were in a fancy place and the waiter's fancy French accent went away?  Fred asked him what happened to his accent and the waiter spit out, \"It's resoived (reserved) for paying customers\" :)  \n\nAll joking aside, it was a real turnoff to see that and it ruined the celebratory dinner mood for me.  It was pretty tacky.\n\nIf the hostess had not done that and would come off her high horse a little, I might have given four stars as the food on a good night can be pretty good, especially during my previous visits in the past.", "author": "Roy N."}

Pretty much any restaurant he recommends is going to be really sexy.  \n\nWe got here early and everyone in our party decided to do the prix fixe menu.  This wasn't a skimpy prix fixe menu though, this one was very extensive, more so than the one at Restaurant Clementine.  There were 3-4 choices for each course, all of which sounded amazing.  I had a really hard time deciding what to order.\n\nI ended up choosing to being with the Mesclun Salad, a bed of greens topped with pears and a large hunk of melted brie...(Evan L. is so right, everything is better with melted cheese)...  I also tried all the other appetizers and I especially liked the creamy corn and lobster soup.\n\nAfter appetizers we received a complimentary demitasse soup...I think it was squash...whatever it was though, it was good, and free.\n\nFor my entree I chose the Roasted Pork Loin with French green lentils, caramelized apples, and calvados (I don't know what these are).  This was also amazing, tender and juicy.  \n\nWhen dessert finally came I was already pretty full but also very excited for my Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.

Chapeau! beautifully accommodated a 6-person birthday dinner last night, from the double-kiss greeting at the front door, to the champagne and palette cleanser to the appetizers (I loved the mesculin salad with fried Brie, a friend enjoyed her salmon terrine with grilled capers, and two had the onion soup--no need to call it \"french\" onion soup here!), the wine was perfect, and the entrees were amazing. \n\nA couple of our party shared the 2-person prime rib special that came with four sauces--the Roquefort was incredible), the salmon and halibut were also awesome. The fennel with the halibut was a perfect compliment.  Others had the lamb and the fillet, and all plates were returned completely bare. We all had the choose your own three-item prix-fixe menu ($33), so dessert was included. I think they brought us every single one b/c we had a birthday girl, so I tried the vanilla creme brule (dreamy) and the warm chocolate cake (liquid heaven), and others had the classic french profiteroles that also looked crazy-good.  Note to vegetarians--no need to avoid this place b/c it's french (notorius for serving meat in every course and in every sauce), they have a whole vegetarian portion of the menu! \n\nThe great service extended beyond the personal attention from the proprietor. We had about four wait staff making sure that wine glasses were full and that we were served at the same time--no easy feat for a six-top in in a small restaurant. The atmosphere was quiet enough to hear each other talk, but wasn't stuffy. Parking wasn't even that bad.

Word-of-mouth, somehow making my way to its Yelp review page, and lastly, Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels (don't hate).\n\nAfter watching her show, I knew it was time to wander down to Outer Richmond and have a take at Chapeau!\n\nI made reservations for my boyfriend and I this past Thursday at 5:30 so we could catch the Early Bird Special, $25.50 for a 3-course meal.\n\nWhen we walked in, my first impression was, \"Wow. This place is TINY,\" but at 5:30, they were already bustling with diners.\n\nWe were squeezed between two couples, so I felt the slightest bit uncomfortable, considering I only sit this close to friends and family. I could literally have my arm half-way outstretched and hit either women next to me. Moreover, because of the small space close proximity of the tables, the conversations were loud. I could barely hear my boyfriend half the time, but I remember him saying, \"This would be a great place for a first date...if you didn't want to talk to your date.\"\n\nOk, on to the food. It was delicious! (NOTE: The menu on their website differs from the restaurant menu, which changes periodically. Choices for the early bird special are a little more extensive than the menu online).\nWe both decided on getting the early bird special prixe-fixe dinner.\n\nBefore we received our appetizers, we were served with what seemed like a cauliflower bisque. Not sure what our server said, because he said it too quickly, but it was mighty delicious. It was a bit spicy and had a curry flavor to it, very rich and delicious. I'd go back just for that bisque! In a bigger bowl (it was served to us in small espresso cups)I started with, pretty much ,salmon tartare with dried capers, crumbled hard-boiled egg, and a small salad on top. The flavors were very refreshing. A good way to start my dinner. My boyfriend, on the other hand, had this potato cake sort of dish with a red wine sauce, I believe, but not too sure. It was really good and hearty, a bit too much of a starter course for me, but he absolutely loved it.\n\nFor our main entrees, I had the medium rare pork loin wrapped in bacon on a bed of chestnut puree with a sauteed green leafy vegetable, which I can't remember, now. But, wow, the chestnut puree was amazing! Complemented to pork very well, which was extremely tender, very good. My boyfriend had the salmon served with mashed potatoes (?) and butternut squash, or was it a butternut squash puree? Anyway, he LOVED his and I'm glad we both loved our own dishes or I'd be quite jealous.\n\nFor dessert I had the creme fraiche gelato with fresh berries (raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries), whipped cream and a cookie in a red wine reduction \"soup\" as the menu said. It was very good. The creme fraiche complemented the sweetness of the berries and red wine reduction very well. My boyfriend got something I loved as well, which was sliced bits of mango, kiwi, and strawberries in a basil soup of some sort. The basil was so refreshing, it felt like summer.\n\nAs for the service, it was fantastic. The moment that struck me the most was when the server was placing food down on the table for a guest next to us, and the guest tried to grab the plate, but the waiter said, \"No, let me.\" On another note, the owner also participates on the floor. He kindly retrieved my coat for me, and while doing so, 3 other people asked me if I needed my coat. Fabulous!\n\nMy boyfriend and I loved this place so much that we're taking a few of his family members to try it this Thursday, only a week after we tried it! I can't wait!\n\nI would've docked Chapeau! one star because of the noise level and also the close proximity of the tables, but the food made up for that.\n\n03/11/08 UPDATE: So, my boyfriend's family and I went to Chapeau! last Thursday, and it was exceptional! We had three orders of fois gras (appetizer sizes) which was delicious! I keep thinking about the fois gras ever since I had it and I'm definitely going for it next time, again. It was in a huckleberry sauce on toast. DELICIOUS! I had the kabocha squash soup for my appetizer, which was oh so good. I'd go back there just for that.\n\nFor my entree, I had the mussels and frites, which were pretty good, I wouldn't say the best.\n\nChapeau! has definitely made its way to my top restaurants list!", "author": "Diana Lyn Z."}

I was impressed by the prices, but I have to admit it worried me a bit about the food. I started with the mesclun salad with mixed greens, beets, candies walnuts and goat cheese. It was delicious! The dressing was perfect and the cheese was not too overpowering. All the ingredients were de-constructed on the side of the plate and the mixed greens and cheese were in the middle. Great presentation!\n\nFor my entree I had the petit poussin. The poussin was cut in 4 baby pieces with the bone and it was roasted with lavender and honey. It was so moist and flavorful. It was served over a bed of spatzel and julienned vegetables. The entire dish was fabulous! \n\nFor dessert, I had the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream! The chocolate oozed out and in the middle was a small piece of banana. I LOVED every bite! The perfect molten cake, moist inside and brownie like texture on the outside.\n\nNow, why the missing half star? The place is way too small! We were literally sitting next to the tables nearby!

They were celebrating the Beaujolais Nouveau release while we were there and they had several different to try.\n\nThe food is traditional French but with a light touch -- no heavy sauces.  Everything was very well prepared.\n\nOur meal started out with some fresh, traditional crusty baguette which was served warm but still soft on the inside.  I had the moules frites (mussels) appetizer which was outstanding.  The mussels were perfectly cooked and tender.  The fries were crisp and fresh and perfect with the aioli.  We also shared the onion soup, which was the best I've ever had.  The soup was sweet with the carmelized onions and the toast with the perfect touch of cheese.\n\nFor the entree, I had the vegetarian option -- a roasted squash filled with wild mushrooms and topped with carrots.  This is not usually my kind of dish, but the squash was tender and flavorful and the mushrooms were the good stuff -- no basic button mushrooms here.  I think I saw four types of mushrooms including fresh porcini.  Outstanding.\n\nThe gf had the duck (quack) with soft polenta with wine-poached pears.  She is sitting next to me as a write this and the best she can come with is \"yummy.\"  But it looked excellent and was served with some sliced warm grapes that went perfectly with the rich brown sauce.\n\nFor dessert we had the warm chocolate cake with a molten center.  The dessert list looked so good we wanted to try one of everything.\n\nThis is by far the best French restaurant I've been to in the city and by far the best restaurant in the Richmond District.

You'll have to excuse me, it's almost Friday, and I think half of my brain is still in Mexico and the other half is still at a Memorial Day BBQ.\n\nI will say that the food and service at Chapeau was no joke. We showed up really late for our reservation because Lisa ran out of gas on her way to meet me (take it from one who knows, when you drive a Yaris, it's hard to accept that the car doesn't run on air and fairy dust). While showing up late for a res is a sin punishable by starvation at many restaurants in this city, Chapeau graciously held our table and gave us a warm welcome when we arrived, Lisa smelling of gasoline and me smelling of the glass of cheap white wine I choked down at the Nag's Head while waiting for Lisa to refuel. Our server was quick and professional throughout the meal, attentive without being intrusive, and knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nI heart Chapeau for daring to go where no French restaurant has gone before- a vegetarian prix fixe menu. And the dishes were creative and tasty, especially the vegetable Napoleon entree, a concoction with lentils and veggies and curry that I managed to keep shoveling into my already full stomach. (Portions are not for the faint of heart at Chapeau.) The dessert was vanilla bean creme brulee in what seemed to be a full sized pie pan. I managed to put most of that away, too, with a glass of delicious Muscat. \n\nThe wine list has a lot of good options at fair prices, though I have no idea how much Lisa spent on the amazing Burgundy we had with our entrees. (Dinner was my birthday present, and I am not telling whether I put out afterward or not, you'll just have to be curious.) We kicked off the meal with some perfectly dry, crisp bubbles as well.\n\nAll the prix fixe menus are priced at less than $50, so you can have a leisurely, decadent French bistro experience without completely breaking the bank. \n\nChapeau, I take off my hat to you!

Definitely in the top ten of any place I've eaten. Ever. Between the girlfriend and I, we went through six dishes and two different drinks as a collective. Not a one of them missed, though my duck topped her fillet as far entrees go and I'm pretty sure her salmon appetizer with salmon roe topped my escargot (I can't eat fish, so I cannot confirm this, but I have a suspicion).\n\nThere are two reasons why I can't give this place 5 stars, however.\n\n1. The ambiance. Some would dub it electric. I'd just call it noisy. Tables are set up closer than apartments in the Inner Richmond, and by my count there were 75 people in a room that was about 25' by 35'.There was so much white noise that it was impossible to carry on a conversation, which is sort of the point of taking someone out to dinner. When the crowd thinned out at dessert, it was a much nicer experience.\n\n2. One of the desserts was too good. The warm chocolate cake is literally chocolate cake with bananas flambee wrapped inside of it and a caramel drizzle to the side. My girlfriend, who usually offers a bite of everything, broke into full on Charlie and the Chocolate factory mode and hoarded it. We went last Sunday, and I've heard how awesome this dessert is about 47 times since then.

The restaurant was at 35.64% capacity (yes i counted),  the ambiance and service was spectacular, the presentation of the food was well executed and we left the restaurant so stuffed, soothingly satiated, and smiling (nice alliteration huh?).\n\nMy parents ordered the 4 course meal,  and i stuck with the 3 courser. \n\nFor appetizers we had the oysters of the half shell, trio of salmon, and Montcherve goat cheese. The oysters were incredibly fresh and well portioned, not like the dinky ones you hate to find. The trio of salmon was surprisingly very tasty, commencing with a nice tangy sweetness kick and ending with a salty aftertaste. This means a lot because I am generally not a big fan of caviar and salmon. Montecherve goat chesse was good, though probably not something I would get again. \n\nMoving to the entrees...we had the Muscovy duck leg, fillet mignon, and rack of lamb. Being a huge carnivore myself, I found the meat cuts itself to be a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the sauce was fabulous, but the rack of lamb lacked the natural savory taste of lamb. Perhaps the saucing was too overwhelming and it stole the thunder of the natural taste of the lamb. boo.\n\nThe desserts were perhaps the highlight of the night! We shared a creme brulee, tarte gran-meree, and a basil napoleon. Everything had just the right amount of sweetness, and was very light...the way french desserts should be! The tarte gran-mere was one of the better apple custard tarts i've had in a long while.

Philippe (the owner) obviously loves what he does and you'll find him serving many roles: waiter, wine steward, busboy, maitre d', etc. He'll greet you and give you a personal goodbye when you leave. As mentioned, he'll chase after you if he some how misses you leaving. For us he was busy serving wine one minute, and then was suddenly outside the door when we walked out giving kisses and shaking hands. \n\nWe each got Menu 2 and the amuse busch was a nice mushroom soup. I started with the foie gras, which I had paired with the sauternes. It was lightly seared, very smooth and rich. Microgreens, thinly sliced apples and a sweet sauce accompanied it. Next up was the tasting fish, which was a seared scallop with avocado, beats, and orange. It was cooked perfectly and tasty. For the entree I had the cassoulet and if you are a fan, you likely won't be disappointed. The duck was cripsy and the sausage had good flavor. All of the dishes were a nice size. No American, super sized portions here. Finally I had the profiteroles. Can you say \"Yum\"? I did.\n\nI did sample my guests onion soup, veal and creme brulee also. Each were excellent. I don't think you can go wrong with your selections and I didn't see an unemptied plate in the house.\n\nMy guests and I shared a nice bottle of Bordeaux that Philippe brought out and expertly presented to us.

We don't do it for the laziness of not wanting to cook at home...but more for the enjoyment of the entire dining experience. Unfortunately, every experience we have had has been sub par...just okay..or worse. Until now...\n\nChapeau is now my absolute favorite restaurant. The entire dining experience was just that...an experience..\nWe exited the taxi to find a drab street with a lot of sad buildings. The sign for the restaurant was a bit unbecoming...\"Chapeau\" scribbled in what looked like pencil on a white piece of paper and taped the front window. There was no peeking inside to see if we should run after the taxi and escape before anyone saw...the blinds were shut, and instead of a door...there was an enormous black velvet curtain for our entrance. Oh boy. We took a deep breath, opened the curtain and walked only two steps inside...what we saw was, well, weird. \n\nThere we were, standing in the middle of the dining room. I had read this in other reviews but honestly thought they were exaggerating (sorry fellow yelpers, I shall never doubt you again!). The room was packed! Gussied up servers dashing around with plates of food, bottles of champagne, and desserts that made my mouth water...Tables were intimately close to the next and draped in white with simple and elegant dinnerware. The crowd was alive with conversation and laughter...a smile, I think, on everyone's face.. no pretentiousness detected here. The decor reminded me of the south...dried flower arrangements hanging on the peach painted walls. And the smell made my stomach turn suddenly with immense hunger..There was no hostess stand...no hostess to be found...All of this on a beautiful August Tuesday night...\n\nWe were seated right away, although we were nearly a half an hour early for our 8:30 reservation (the only one left 2 days in advance - message here is to be sure to make a ressie). We were seated so closely to the couple next to us we could hear everything they were saying...she was a flight attendant, he was her passenger...she said she looked like lucy lu (hahaha..more like margaret cho), he told her that Cheesy was Mandarin for Crazy (dork). I digress...\n\nThe menu.Oh the wonderful menu!!! I had the foie gras seared and served on brioche with peach syrup. OH MY GOD. amazing. He had the Goat Cheese Napoleon...polenta, tomatoes, goat cheese with pine nuts and zucchini...went deliciously with our glass of champagne. We chose to have palette cleansers...ya, that's right...for 4 dollars a piece you can choose from lemon ginger sorbet sitting in a citrus vodka served in a sugar rimmed martini glass, or the green apple version. We got one of each. So refreshing. We both chose the Fillet. Holy Cow. Seriously...must have been sent from heaven...I didn't even need a knife...no kidding. so delicate, soft, velvety. Get it. To finish things off, we had the cheese plate to go with our bottle of red we brought ourselves..while we waited for the chocolate molten cake. (I told you, we know how to eat). The bill came in a hat and I didn't gasp at the total for a change...\n\nOkay. Here is the moment I had been waiting for. I had read in previous reviews that the chef would chase you down the street to kiss your cheek but thought he only did that for those special pple, you know? We snuck out...no chef in sight. We stood outside for a minute, contemplating on the best place to catch a taxi...and started to walk...hmm. no chef. Was he mad because we brought our own bottle of wine...\n\nALAS! he came running out of the restaurant, met us in the middle of the street, with no concern for his safety..kissed my cheeks and asked how everything was! I couldn't believe it! What an awesome thing to do. Smart, wonderful Chef from Chapeau...I love you...as only a girl who loves food and attention could. You kissed my boyfriend too!

Our meal began pleasantly with a basket of warm bread and an amuse-bouche (a small cup of cauliflower soup).  For my starter, I ordered the kabocha squash soup which was wonderfully flavorful.  My salmon entree was good but probably not the stand-out of the meal (although I should disclose that I had remarked to my dining companion that I was full a couple of minutes before our entrees arrived).  The vanilla bean creme brulee was delicious and worth all the calories.\n\nI ordered a half glass of the white Bordeaux to start.  It was so good that I had to order another half glass.  The wine smelled like green apples and tasted like sauvignon blanc (although I don't think it was).  My friend ordered a French chardonnay that she really loved (following my example or succumbing to the peer pressure, she also ordered another half glass of her wine).  We both ordered a half glass of the pinot noir to accompany our salmon entrees.  We liked the pinot noir as well, but I think we both enjoyed our whites mores.  We wanted to write down the names of these wines, but we didn't get a chance to look at the wine list again.\n\nThe service was good and attentive (our bread basket and water glasses were regularly refilled, so definitely no complaints there), if a bit too polite (I seem to have this problem with French restaurants in general).  My friend thought our waiter looked like some actor whenever he half-smiled; I liked his French accent but found his mannerisms to be a bit formal.\n\nIn summary, the quality/price ratio at Chapeau is quite high.  In response, I have committed to making the trek out to the Richmond at least every three months to treat myself at Chapeau.", "author": "Grace W."}

Perhaps the owner needs to spend less time kissing cheeks and more time in the kitchen. I love long drawn out meals that unfold to reveal one treasure after another.

Slow as in there was about a half hour spread waiting for our entrees to all come together so we could eat.  Slow as in the first entree showed up fifteen minutes before anyone elses, so it was effectively cold by the time most of the rest arrived.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-26", "description": "I learned a very important lesson while I had my first meal at Chapeau the other night: \"NEVER go there on a first date\"\n\nI say this not because the food was bad - it was very very good, and I'm looking forward to my next visit. I say this because for whatever reason, there were about 3 first dates gone awry, while I was there. Okay, well, I didn't know if they were in fact first dates, but they were certainly a bit awkward in general, and almost certainly in an early stage of the craigslist wooing ritual.\n\ncase 1: the \"couple\" next to me was finishing up their dessert when I sat down. I didn't put my energy into listening to their conversation, but at some point in time, the girl shook the guy's hand... over the middle of the table, and said something like, \"thanks, but no thanks\", followed by a somewhat bewildered \"whoa, I just paid for a 140-dollar dinner and i don't even get a hug?\"-look on his face. So that makes me think that it was a first date gone awry... but seriously, who does that? If you don't like the guy, at the very least, do your awkward thanking outside, and if you have to give up a hug... T.S.\n\nbtw, the chocolate cake the girl was having looked PHENomenal.\n\ncase 2: another couple, this time behind and to the left of me. The guy goes to the bathroom, and as he returns, slyly rubs his date's shoulder as he's sitting down. My dinner companion reported that she more or less looked like she was about to throw up. Again, I doubt it was due to the food. In fact, it would have been a real shame for whatever they were eating to have been regurgitated... However, it seemed like a bit of a awkward first date move, but I missed them as they were walking out of the restaurant, so that one is a little bit more in the air.\n\nI think the point I'm trying to make is sort of like that Clearasil commercial that they have during episodes of blind date or cheaters or other mid-day/late-night trashy TV shows.... the one that says Clearasil gives you confidence. I think Chapeau gives you confidence. The food is really good and just looks damn nice. It's got a really romantic feel, though it's a little too noisy at times, but that might have been cause my table was next to the wall, and therefore catching a lot of reflected sounds. But if you're going on a first date, and you want to impress a gal, it seems like an obvious choice to bring her to a nice place like Chapeau. I know I certainly would have... until the other night.\n\nNow I know, and knowing is half the battle.", "author": "Bernie L."}

It's a blessing that they aren't!\n\nChapeau is tucked away in a very residential part of Clement Street, easily missed driving by. The inside doesn't scream much of anything -- it's clean and comfortable but not memorable. Food, and hospitality, are kings here.\n\nFirst, there's Philippe. The Frenchman owner-chef is truly the heart of this place. You can taste it in his food -- he *loves* to cook. His dishes change every few weeks and each one is creative and flavorful without trying too hard. While it's delicious, his food lacks pretentiousness.\n\nBut Philippe is not just his food. He is an excellent host. At every meal we've eaten there, he's come to our table and talked to us about the food, what he hopes to cook on the next menu, and makes us feel special and welcome. Before we leave, he comes out of the kitchen to shake my hand and kiss my wife's cheeks. Once, we walked out the door before he knew we were leaving, and he literally chased after us to say his goodbyes!\n\nDespite this, it is still an intimate dinner. The service is excellent and present but not invasive. Even when the chef joins us at the table, it's a welcome addition not an intrusion. The lighting is dim and slightly romantic. The space is filled with tables and quite tight, but still it feels as even you have just enough space to be private.\n\nThe prices are not cheap, per se, but extremely reasonable considering the food and there is a 3-course pris fixe menu before 6 (except on Fridays and Saturdays) that's usually around $20. That's blue-hair early for dinner but you'll find the restaurant full anyway. \n\nI honestly can't rave enough about this place. If it were easy to walk to or if it were easier to park in the Richmond, we might eat there so often as to have a seat named after us!

The food, wine list, service, Phillipe's hand shakes, kisses on the cheeks, everything about it was NOT what I had come to know for restaurants in the area.

A Clement street must!!!!!!!!! \nWe enjoyed veal sweetbreads, lamb and duck confit cassoulet, pancetta wrapped pork tenderloin, pan seared day boat scallops with a lobster sauce, profiteroles and half glasses of well selected wines with each course. I was absolutely impressed!!", "author": "Marco Antonio C."}

Along with the Cassoulet de Toulouse with Canellini Beans/ Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder/Duck Leg Confit/ Garlic and Toulouse Sausage.  both dishes were duck, but they tasted very different (in a good way!!).  i don't normally care for duck so i can't give the food proper ratings.  but if i did, i was amazed with how well the dishes came out.  the match of duck breast (BIG juicy slices with just the right amount of skin) with fruit was lovely.  the cassoulet was good and i loved the beans.  very very good.\n\nwe also added a single tasting of the scallop which was to die for.  i love seafood and i loved the bed of rice/ rissoto that it came on.  it was only one scallop but hoyboy... Y-U-M!  presentation was an A+, flavor and texture also an A.  Very pleased with this dish.\n\ndessert:  oh boy~ Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e, Basil Napoleon with Maui Pineapple, Manilla Mango, Banana, Kiwi and Strawberries/\nChampagne-Citrus Pastry Cream/ Feuille de Brique, AND an apple tart with hazelnut gelato and fig? preserve on the side.  DELICIOUS.  I loved the basil syrup~ which was not only a good sweet note but an awesome shade of green.  the tart was just right and not too sweet.  the gelato and especially the fig were to die for.  the brule~ excellent and lots of vanilla bean. :)  they also have excellent coffee. \n\nservice was FANTASTIC.  i mentioned this before in another one of my reviews but excellent service and presentation make any meal feel wonderful.  Our waiter, Charles was so pleasant (he also had a very sexy accent).  The owner/ owner's wife were also seen milling around the restaurant which I think is really rad.  I appreciate places where the owners actually put forth their face and effort alongside their employees.  She even walked us out to the door and bid us farewell.  that's a sign of a good restaurant where the owners actually care about the food and their customers.\n\ni would give this place a 4.5-5 stars.  i would definitely come back again. *edit*  i thought they were closing down but @elsie was kind enough to share the correct info~ \"Chapeau is not closing .... They are moving Chapeau to where clementine is right now ... clementine will become chapeau come August :)\"   Clementine is located on clement and 2nd. definitely go check them out!!!", "author": "Kimmy C."}

The service was super friendly and accommodating to our night. We were greeted by everyone who walked past us as we made our way to the table and of course birthday wishes!\n\nWe had an early reservation so we opted for the early bird menu.\nI ordered the soup, it was a squash soup with duck fat crouton. Very warm and spiced to perfection. That soup was absolutely amazing!\n\nFor our second course we split the foie gras. I always love foie gras so it was no surprise that I loved it! It was served seared on top of toasted brioche and served with sliced apples and mache.\n\nMy entree was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin on top of a bed of swiss chard and a parsnip puree. The bacon was so perfectly wrapped around the pork that i almost forgot it was there until i tasted bacon! Usually when an item is bacon wrapped it looks messy and thus looses its visual appeal, but they definitely succeeded! The parsnip puree had such an amazing creamy texture! This whole dish was a success!!\n\nDessert i choose the vanilla bean creme brule!! This creme brule brought tears to my eyes. It was so creamy and sweet and perfect!!\nMy boyfriend had ordered the french toast and that as well was very very good! Melt in your mouth texture with the warm bread and the melting ice cream!!\n\nI cannot wait to return to Chapeau! in the near future!! Their food is truly amazing!!", "author": "Susanna B."}

I have not eaten at many French restaurants and was excited to try it!  The atmosphere was quiet and intimate.  We had early reservations so the restaurant was only half full which was nice.  They spaced the guests out so we weren't sitting right next to someone, which I liked. Our waiter was very helpful with the menu and quite attentive.  To begin, we ordered the Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic which was a delicious prelude to my entree.  My first experience with escargot and definitely not my last!  For my entree, I selected the Filet Mignon, Pommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms, Sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine and was ultimately treated to one of the best steaks I have ever had.  Not only was it properly prepared at the medium that I requested, it had the right amount of sauce and mushrooms.  Absolutely DELISH!!

Despite it's setbacks,  I like it here.\n\nSure, the decor is French Marshalls discount store: frilly wall murals, bright lighting.   So what!  Sure, the tables are one on top of another.  But hey, that means good eavesdropping AND the fun of shocking your neighbor with inappropriate conversation.   Sure, the space is small, with no waiting area.  So don't arrive early for your reservation: that way you won't have to wait next to the bathrooms like we did.\n\nFood is comforting, predictable-ish Frenchy.   Basically the same menu I remembered from eating here a year ago.  But that can be a good thing.  Even I can get tired or aggressively seasonal, ever-constant menu changes.  Because sometimes I want the same old thing.\n\nSame old thing as of last night was cassoulet.  I remember it being ideal - and because I'm planning on making my own this coming weekend, I needed to be inspired.\n\nTo my disappointment, the cassoulet was not the textbook image of perfection I envisioned.  It was a bit soupy - the beans had not given off that creamy starchiness that binds everything together.  Lamb advertised was undetectable.  Tomato flavors were too pronounced.  And no crusty top layer, with breadcrumbs sprinkled as a seeming afterthought.\n\nBut I sense this was a one-off fall from grace.  Because everything else was delicious: simple salad with sweet-ish dijon-y dressing, amazing melted brie on potato pancake with nicely dressed bitter greens and walnuts; richly savory filet mignon even despite my friend's request to cook it (gasp) medium-well.  Molten chocolate cake was a perfect rendition of this often-bastardized dessert.\n\nAnd how could you not love the owner?  He is charming.  He kisses you on both cheeks.  He has chosen an excellent wine list brimming with reasonable, interesting bottles.  He cares.   And it shows.", "author": "Melissa B."}

For dinner, I had fat juicy scallops.  There were only three, but that was alright (even though the dish cost $26?) because I was stuffed from all the other stuff we got....the brie appetizer was especially good.  My bf got cassoulet, which was a bit salty for our tastes....but I'm not rating his dinner, I'm rating mine!!!\n\nI will definitely go back but probably only for the prie fixe deal Sunday - Thursday because it is so much cheaper.  I guess French food is supposed to be expensive and, whaa, whaa, whaa, so I guess Chapeau is reasonably priced in that regard and is deserving of four stars.

She apparently knew what she was talking about because I was completely blown away by both the food and the service. \n\nI can't remember what I ate, but I remember that the presentation was perfect and beautiful in every way, and the food itself tasted great. I had Menu 1, which allows you to choose an appetizer, main course, and dessert, and all were phenomenal. I also really liked the palate cleanser between courses that was a sorbet with some sort of strong liquor (vodka?). \n\nThe service is also amazing -- every time a family member or I left our table, a member of the wait staff would come by, refold our dinner napkin artfully, and then place it ever so gently on the back of our chair. The food takes a while to come out, but I think that's part of the fine dining experience -- to talk and linger over your food with your loved ones and just enjoy being in good company. The chef-owner also takes the time to come out and shake hands (men) or kiss hands (women) with every single person who eats here every night. That is so sweet!\n\nAn added bonus of the night was toward the end when I was about to leave the place. On my way to the restroom, I tried to sneak a peak of the kitchen since I wanted to see where all the action was. The chef saw me and quickly asked me to come in and have a tour of his kitchen! I was so happy you would not believe! He showed me where he stored his freshly made secret sauces, his herbs/spices, and introduced me to his sous-chef and other kitchen workers. My cousins were wondering what was taking me so long, so they saw me in the kitchen and they got a tour, too! \n\nI LOVE this place, and I love that chef.

Of course, I've yet to visit Gary Danko, so when that day finally comes I might have to move Chapeau! to #2, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.\n\nI could do a play by play of my entire evening, but it would just reiterate what most everyone who has reviewed this places has said.  So I'll just make a few important points:\n1) The nicest and most professional Chef/Owner I've ever come across.  \n2) Order the Goat Cheese starter, no joke! \n3) Make reservations and if possible ask to be sat in one of the window tables... the restaurant is small and these tables are probably the only ones that don't make you feel like you're sitting on top of your neighboring dinners.\n\nGo to Chapeau!

But that feeling disappeared very quickly due to the amazing service. The host and her mom (also a host) very very warm and kind, and didn't look at my 20-something friend and I as weird for being the only non-senior citizens. The amazing service continued with the chef walking around, shaking our hands, wishing us a good experience, complimentary cauliflower soup, flexible menu options, etc. While the menu was a bit intimidating price-wise, I was out the door with a $70 bill (+25% more in tip). I was extremely satisfied. As with most fine french dining, the customer base is a bunch of old geezers.

The Profiteroles had a uff of liquor in the chocolate sauce that I liked. The creme brulee didn't have any taste, where's the vanilla beans?  I guess the only thing that was good was the free appetizer-eggplant/garlic crusted bread.  Nothing on the menu was exciting.  No salmon!  No rack of lamb.  The Napolean wasn't at all Napolean.

My husband and I are both foodies, have eaten several times in Paris, and have eaten at our share of 4 star restaurants in SF.  The reviews for this place led me to think I could not be disappointed - well Yelp, you let me down.\nFrom the moment we entered the door and were whisked to our table.... I had a weird  feeling.  Surely, we could have been offered the opportunity for a drink at the charming bar? Nope, straight to the table where we were handed menus by the waiter and ordered drinks.  That was the last experience with our waiter for 25 minutes.  In the meantime, this waiter seated tables to our right and left- got them drinks and bread.  My husband and I both tried to make eye contact but this went unnoticed.  My husband stood up and asked the waiter if we could be assisted and the waiter went for full stop arrogance.  He walks away and is giving me (the wife) dirty looks and continues to talk about us and looking at us all the way to the bar.  I wanted to leave.  My husband could see all of this in the tacky 1970s mirror they have all around this restaurant and was fit to be tied.  He went up to the bar and asked the waiter what the problem was??  The chef/owner was now at the bar-saw the commotion and offered us a new waiter.  WTF??? We order and new waiter is fine.  Our first waiter is continuing the dirty looks and it was just plain ridiculous and not to mention so unprofessional.  Don't be mistaken- there is zero ambiance in this place.  There are bad lights and mirrors but there is nothing Parisian about this place.  The owner chef comes around and thanks you for coming to his restaurant which I thought was odd but perhaps he is trying to make up for the arrogant waiter.

We had a wonderful suggestion of half a bottle of Bordeaux to share between the two of us to accompany our meal of oysters on a half shell, mussels, and the filet mignon.  Everything was perfect.  Although I did not try the oysters they looked fresh and good.  The mussels went perfectly with the bits of bacon and mushroom in the broth topped off with garlic french bread.  And the filet mignon....oh the filet mignon! Perfection at medium well.  Bf says he will definitely go back to try the rabbit that our neighbors had which looked divine and I would try their halibut and/or salmon for sure.\n\nAnd the best part of the meal.... the dessert!! Bf's praline cake with coffee cream was perfection.  My crisp apple tart with hazelnut ice cream was one of the best desserts I've had.  Dinner was totally worth every penny.

It's creamy, stuffy, and in some cases, just gross.  So when my parents were in town and got all excited about scoring a reservation at Chapeau, I cringed and reluctantly agreed to join them.\n\nBut guess what?  I was wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong wrong.  At least, wrong about Chapeau.\n\nThey start you off with some french bread (but of course!) and some asparagus soup.  I'm not a fan of soups that are that buttery, but in this case was wishing I'd ordered a full out bowl.  \n\nNext it was the smoked trout, and I must say this was the best appetizer I've ever had.  Here I am writing this review 3 weeks later, and I can still taste it.  We also tried the mussels and escargot, both were prepared well and paired nicely.   \n\nFor the main course, I opted for the duck and it was splendid.   Caramelized pears was tangy but not over the top.   The lamb was also a great selection.\n\nEnded with the blueberry custard.  Deeeelish.\n\nThis little dinner deal runs for under $40 a person if I recall.  For the quality of the food and service, that was the score of the week.

It was rich and delicious, but I only wish there was more toast.  The bf got the creamy corn soup with dungeness crab and it was flavorful and really creamy.  He didn't enjoy it as much as me because he thought it was too rich.  Plus, they served complimentary cauliflower soup and I really wish I could have chosen the soup as my appetizer.\n\nFor the entree, I got the Bacon Wrapped Natural Pork Tenderloin with Potato Puree and Spinach.  The meal is as good as it sounds!  The accompanying sauce was delicious and I ate every last bite of my dish even though I was stuffed.  The bf got the Lamb Shank with Eggplant Couscous.  He liked the lamb but didn't enjoy the eggplant couscous bc it was a bit too tangy with him.  I agree, it didn't have such a pleasant taste.\n\nFor dessert, the bf ordered the warm chocolate cake (takes 20 mins. to prepare) and with one bite, you could taste how moist, fluffy, and hot it was!  Proceed with caution.  I chose the Grand Mere Tart ... an apple custard tart with hazelnut ice cream on the side.  I liked the ice cream more.  \n\nOne star off because I don't like how close together the tables are.  I don't like listening to other's conversations and vice versa.

Then again, my idea of 5 star dining is a piece of raw fish wrapped inside rice and a sheet of oceanic vegetation. I guess I just don't have a palette for French food.\n\nAnd you know what else I don't have a palette for? A 3 hour dinner! I mean, we had 3 courses and it took 3 hours. That's 1 course per hour. I suppose that must be part of the fine dining experience, but when you're under the strict \"after 8 gains weight\" rule, that sorta snail's pace totally ruins your night. Not to mention that the dessert, which is the last course, is totally not worth breaking the after 8 rule. We tried basically everything on the menu, and were impressed with not one of the desserts. And as far as the main courses were concerned, my lamb was way salty. And the salmon was bland. \n\nI didn't completely hate my experience. I just didn't think that what they offered warranted the rather high prices that were attached.

Where else can you get a four course tasting menu for $45 and a wine list that averages $60/bottle? \n\nAmbiance is a double edged sword. I think Chapeau got it's table layout from studying a United 747 cabin because you just can't get any more people in one spot without violating fire codes. The noise level isn't trivial either. Just a bit below that of the SFO tarmac.  But, it all kind of works as you have great wait staff and a cozy, cute environment that does remind you of Paris. \n\nThe food is simple and lacks creativity, but you have all the French basics and everything is cooked to perfection. Here are some suggestions:\n\nMussels - great sauce (save your bread) but the mussels were just OK. Small and lacking flavor\n\nFrench onion soup - pretty standard\n\nScallop (the addition on the tasting menu) - get it. The scallop is perfectly cooked and sits on a bed of risotto with a light curry sauce. It's an interesting combination that works well\n\nStriped Bass - the failure of the night. The fish was perfectly cooked and had a nice pepper seasoning, but it was overwhelmed by the mushroom sauce. A BAD combo.\n\nSalmon - this was great. The salmon was (again) cooked perfectly and sat on a bed of mashed sweet potatoes and cabbage.

However, as soon as we entered, we were surprised to see white linen tables with a very professional and attentive wait staff. As soon as we were seated, we immediately felt comfortable in the cozy atmosphere.\n\nThe menu is a three course meal where diners can choose their own combinations of first, second, and desert courses for a fixed price of $38. Some first and second course selections would constitute an additional charge of up to $8, such as the seared fois gras on toasted brioche, paired with an aperitif, a rich and buttery way to start the meal. The spirit chosen to accompany the fois was a perfect pairing.\n\nWhat struck every member of our table was the premier second course - a roasted prime rib for two served with four sauces (including a truffle sauce) and roasted bone marrow. Though this too warranted an extra $16 between two people, the dish did not disappoint. The head chef wheeled a cart with a cutting board to our table and sliced the prime rib for us table side, emulating the big silver carts of a House of Prime Rib. The bone barrow was stuffed with thyme and a bay leaf, however the herbs did not permeate much in the decadent fatty marrow.\n\nWe did not think that any desert would be able to match this deliciously glutenous meal, however, we were surprised again. Mixed diced fruit with small cubes of basil infused jello was surprisingly good and very refreshing.\n\nWith a couple of beers and bottles of wine (not forgetting the added costs of the fois gras and prime rib/bone marrow extravaganza), the total per person hovered around $100.

I had a filet mignon that was excellent and my wife had the veal which was mangifique. The appeteizers were delectable and the deserts fantastique.\n\nCan it be that perfect?  No.  The place is small and a bit cramped and that also makes it quite loud.  If you want a quiet romatic spot this isn't it. Sometimes my wife and I had trouble hearing each other talk.

But the bottom line is I'm there for the food.\n\nWe went for dinner last night and had the prix fixe menu, with asparagus/goat cheese, escargot as appetizers, fish taste was tiger prawn with risotto, filet mignon, lamb loin as entrees and blueberry pastry and apple tart as dessert.\n\nAppetizers were good, but the tiger prawn and risotto dish was oversalted, filet and lamb were decent cuts but not particularly flavorful (we didn't feel inclined to finish either) and the dessert tasted fine, but seemed like they brought them in from some neighborhood pastry shop?\n\nBread was not noteworthy (I'm not sure what previous reviewers were talking about), we had excellent glasses of wine (cote de rhone in particular) and nice champagne (but at $12/glass would appreciate a warning next time).\n\nOverall, the presentation was nice but the flavors not sharp and clear enough.  The ingredients didn't seem fresh, or they compromised on quality for cheaper ingredients. \n\nOur total bill came to $150 before tax, with not nearly enough value delivered for me to return or recommend to friends.  Chapeau! will give you a very pleasant dining experience, but would benefit greatly by transferring some of that excellence in service over to the mediocre food.

All meals included a complimentary couliflower curry soup in an expresso looking cups.  The taste was splendid...you can taste a mild curry with a hint of something sweet...we think it was honey.  \n\nHere's the breakdown of what we had:\n\n1. Foie Gras - amazing...definitely melts in your mouth\n2. Tasting Fish - interesting, the skin is crunchy and not too fishy\n3. Bacon wrapped Pork Tenderloin - very very tender and the sauce is sweet and very good\n4. Lamb Shank - King Arthur size portions, but very tender and rich.  You got to be crazy starving to finish this dish\n\nAll the desserts were great.  The champagne was delicious as well.\n\nGreat service, ambiance, and food.

Latter is assured & confident. \n\nThe food is on a par with the City's good n'great.  Fois Gras could have been served at Fleur de Lys, the Balsamic reduction with the generous Heirloom Tomatoes perfect - one of the few chefs that knows when to hold back.\n\nBouillabaisse & Cassoulet are widely open to interpretation, and we liked this kitchen's rendition of each a great deal.  Neither dish was over-sized but each portion was spot on with first rate ingredients.\n\nWine list had many bargains and credit to the chef owner for taking a couple of pages to highlight quality wines around the $30 price point.  We asked for advice from our waiter regarding a white burgundy and he immediately referred us to the proprietor who gave very reasonable, knowledge based, advice.\n\nNow what really sets this establishment apart is a service issue worth sharing.  The menu has a couple of prix-fixe options and we had originally gone a la carte with our thinking to not indulge in a dessert.  Having decided (thankfully, in retrospect) to ultimately relent and share a profiterole we found out it was subsequently comped.  Classy.\n\nIt is a cramped space, and our enjoyment was no doubt enhanced by having a two-top set somewhat apart from the millieu in the window, but everybody seemed to be having a great time.

The window seats are autonomous island states away from the fray and far more private.\n\nFood? Delicious. Gorgeous. Three courses left me stuffed. I have no idea how authentic it is, if you care about this kind of thing. I'll say this: Chapeau knows what to do with potatoes. Num.\n\nService? Professional, charming and leisurely. Three courses took 2 hours. That's a long time for dinner, folks. But, I really didn't feel like I had to wave down anybody.\n\nYour fellow patrons? The class interplay in the Richmond always fascinates me: Clement St is this DMZ between the well-heeled folks living north of California St and the unwashed masses living south of Geary Blvd, and these groups tend to gravitate toward separate businesses along Clement.

Menu: In French, chapeau means hat. chapeau! means wow. What happens when you have exclaim, \"hat!\" ? \n\nI've been waiting to be chapeau!'d for a long time. I got my parents a gift certificate to the place before I even really knew that the Richmond neighborhood existed a few Christmases ago...in hopes that they would share their dinner with me. Luckily, I was right, and we booked a reservation at 6pm for four last Sunday. We didn't have to worry about the tables-being-to-close issue, as we scored the table by the window, which was separated from the rest of the pack. We brought some red Pinot Noir with us to cork (I think it's around $18 per bottle.)\n\nWe considered trying the prix fix menu (choosing one app, main dish & dessert) but also wanted to share a few things, so our waiter assured us not to worry about figuring out the combinations, which was nice, and didn't put pressure on us to order a la carte or prix fix or both. \n\nMy boy and I started with a few oysters, which were very French (which translates in my mind to rich & creamy). They were excellent (even without champagne) and a lot cheaper than the mediocre oysters at Pier 23. Next, we passed around the brie appetizer, which was placed atop a crispy nest of potatoes--kind of like hash browns, the French onion soup--hearty and flavorful, and mesculan salad which had a simple but tasty dressing and a few grapes. It was a good mix.\n\nRight before the next courses came out, I told the boy that he was very adventurous in ordering the sweetbreads. When he asked why and I confirmed exactly what kind of \"meat\" they were, I think he became a little apprehensive to dive right in and savor every bite. Although at the end of the meal his plate was clean, so I didn't feel too bad for ruining the surprise. I had the Coc au vin, which was very rich. Strong bold flavors. Lovely sauce. Definitely one tasty, tender rooster. I tried my mom's bacon-wrapped pork and my dad's sea bass, but overall I was happy with my choice. \n\nI'm not a big dessert person, although I think this was my favorite part of the meal thanks to the \"classic French profiterolles\" that we ordered. Light and fluffy homemade miniature pastries with decadent rich chocolate sauce flowing atop and creamy vanilla ice cream inside = insanely good. The cr\u00e8me brulee, usually my favorite, was also good. The chocolate cake was just ok. \n\nAfter a good three hours, we received a chapeau with the check, and waited a bit more, then rolled ourselves out.

Super slippery floor that I could only \"slide\" in my expensive heels. I felt like I'm 12 and trying on my mom's heels. \n\nAppetizer: Fois Gras on top of scallop with blueberry sauce. Heaven. I would lick the plate. The other dessert was just amazing. It was an eggplant dish that comes with roasted red pepper (which i just hate normally) but it's SO GOOD that I again, would lick the plate. \n\nThe sorbetto were both really really nice, apple and (....don't remember besides being amazingly good) both come with a hint of liquor. \n\nEntree: striped sea bass was just ok.

But the most important thing on the place, the big package, couscous with jujube, black olives, raisins, cranburries, wrapped with eggplant, zuchini, OMG, one of the most amazing thing i've ever had in my life. I hated couscous, but I loved this package thing. This is the very few time that I would say \"OMG, I hated xyz, but this is SO GOOD!\" This is the 3rd plate that I would lick.\n\nMUST get the cheese platter. There are 5 kinds of cheese, for $8.50. You'll feel extremely sorry to your stomach for not getting it. The blue cheese was AMAZING. This is the 3rd time in one single meal that I said to myself, \"OMG, I hated blue cheese before, but this is SO GOOD!\" It is very very very strong, but it's so smooth that it becomes part of your tongue, at least that's what I felt.

While we had a nice table against the wall, you could see that they maximize space here - tables are set in rows with nary an elbow's reach to the next. Cozy. Our hostess offered us appertifs as we sat down. I tried a glass of kir (white wine w/ creme de cassis aka black currant). It was refreshing, slightly sweet.\n\nFor dinner, we opted for the 4 course meal ($38). Choice of appetizer, a tasting fish, entree, and dessert. Before the meal, we were presented with an amuse bouche of cauliflower puree soup. It was creamy curry in flavor with a sweet finish.\n\nI started with the Salade Landaise, magret du canard (aka duck ) with frisee salad. A slice of foie gras sat prettily on top but honestly, I am not a fan. But I appreciated the thought. The duck salad was delicious though but honestly I was full after this sizeable salad. However, I couldn't resist the tasting fish - which a sea scallop served with risotto in lobster sauce. This was by far my favorite for the whole meal. Perfectly cooked scallop, browned top and bottom, but perfectly tender throughout. Sooo good.\n\nFor my main, I had the Pork Tenderloin served w/ yam puree and shredded brussel sprouts. The meat was tender, skin was crispy, and very lean. \n\nDessert for me was the Warm Chocolate Cake with  a center of banana flambe and a side of rum raisin ice cream. This was so decadent. You cut into the center of the cake and the flambee sauce just oozes out like chocolate lava.\n\nMy friend had the mussels and frites for apps (it's an option for main as well), followed by the Cassoulet of duck, lamb, and sausage. This was really hearty. They serve full portions not tasting sizes, so the cassoulet as course 3 was impressive and daunting. A trio of sorbet (passionfruit, lemon, and raspberry) with a candied hazelnut galette was the finisher.\n\nEverything was delicious. Service was spot on, classy, discreet.

My only gripe other than the difficulty finding it at night was that the lights kept varying in intensity through the meal.\n\nI also want to take special note of the fact that you are greeted by the owner (Philippe?) at the door as you enter, and when you leave, he escorts you out. This is a phenomenal thing -- this earthy, genuine-feeling gesture changed that night from another good meal in the big city to a onewhere we were made to feel special, that our choice and our presence were appreciated.\n\nI'll be coming back, with friends.", "author": "Karsten P."}

The food is great, the price is phenomenal, the service and staff are super nice and loads of fun and I love how the chef comes out and says hello to every single table.  Love the deco,   Blah blah blah.\n\nWhat I haven't read though (and I haven't read every review, sorry) is how freaking kick ass the prime-rib here is.  Gadzooks... it's far better than House of Prime Rib (overrated IMO), it's better than Izzy's... it's some honest to goodness good eating people.  You have to pre-order it when you make reservations, or good luck getting it.  It's juicy  and flavorful; seriously not a bad bite on the whole thing.  FYI, when I ate there, if you order a la carte, it's $35pp and it's for 2 people.  But, if you order with a prix fixe, then it's a $6 supplemental.  \n\nThe whole menu is pretty much can't miss.  Do yourself a favor and try the prime rib.  It's amazing, it really is.  The only, and ONLY problem is that Chapeau is incredibly loud.  It's small, and crowded, and I feel like I'm yelling to be heard.  But given all the positives, it's a minor gripe to be sure.", "author": "Dietrich H."}

He didn't have to wait long-30 seconds later, the host dashed down the street to tell us that someone had cancelled their reservation and they could take us.  Usually, this sort of behavior would turn me off (were you REALLY completely booked?), but we arrived at 5:50 and by 6:30 the place was totally full.\r\n\r\nI haven't noticed half glasses of wine available at any other establishment (that's not to say that they aren't available-just that I hadn't seen them)  The one thing Man Candy recalled from his last visit was that the french onion soup was out of this world, and it did not disappoint.  Tomato bisque?  Outstanding.  My filet mignon?  cooked perfectly, and served over little potato lovelies with a light morel sauce!  Between courses, we were brought a complimentary serving of cream of califlower soup to cleanse the palette-somehting I would have never tried on my own due to my disinterest in vegetables, but it would have been my loss.    Just as requested, Chapeau! got us in and out in 90 minutes, as required by our plans for the evening.  Unfortunatly, this meant foregoing dessert.\r\n\r\nYes, the tables are close together, and as such, it's not going to be a quiet meal. But the romance of the place is undeniable.

You know why? It's so dark and indistinct that you barely notice it if you driving there. The windows are covered up and makes this place feel mysterious.   It's in a local neighborhood area.  \n\nI walked in and immediately there was Chef Phillipe walking toward me and shook my hand asking me If I had reservations and that he will find me a table.  I said great.  Within 10 minutes, he settled us at a table to the side.  The restaurant is small and cramped (your table is really close to other dining patrons).  The hostess asks to take your coat and directs us to the table.  \n\nAccording to the reviews that I have read, this is a home cooking bistro type of provencale French food.  This restaurant was opened in 1996. \n\nAnyways, the menu is simple and tells you what CHAPEAU! means.  \nI selected Menu 1 which is a prix fix of $40 I think.  I got the Striped Seabass,  Montecherve goat cheese (I read this was the most popular) - pinenuts, tomato confit, sage polenta, eggplant caviar, zucchini, bell pepper piperade, olive oil, balsamic vinegar.  the presentation of this dish was amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-05", "description": "My boyfriend Alex surprised me and taken me to Chapeau! last night for my birthday.  I told my waiter after I ate my meal, that it was best birthday dinner I had ever had.\n\nProps to this place being open on a Monday.  My birthday fell on a Monday this year and many fancy restaurants are just not open on Mondays.  And with all the high reviews on Yelp, he knew that he wanted to take me here.\n\nThere is a lady's face in the window etched on the glass but no visible sign saying the name of the restaurant.  So Alex wasn't sure we were at the right spot until I asked him, \"Is it a French bistro?\".  He said yes, I said I'm pretty sure this is it then, and then we walked inside.\n\nNo one acknowledged us until the chef came out to greet me with a hug.  That was quite a shock but felt really nice.  We arrived 15 minutes late for a reservation at 8:30 because Alex had a harder time finding parking than expected.  That did not matter at all, they had a place for us.\n\nThe decor was simple yet classy.  Dimmed lighting, a white rose in a vase on each table, no need for candles.  There was a handful of people there already enjoying dinner when we arrived.  Majority of the waiters and the owner are actually Frenchmen, I understand enough French from high school to tell that they were truly speaking it to one another and not just some person with a fake accent.  Their accents might make it hard to understand them but they are not offended if you ask for clarification.\n\nWe shared a Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic appetizer.  I ordered the Pan Seared Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast, Creamy Truffled Polenta, Salsifies, Pears & Grapes, Green Peppercorn Sauce.  They will ask you how you want the duck done, which threw me off for him asking, so I just said medium.  Alex got the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin.\n\nThe baguette was a nice combination of crispy and soft, accompanied by a warm plate with a slab of butter on it.  More places need to do this, makes the butter so easy to spread.  The escargots were mouthwatering, with plenty of garlic and butter, and very tender.  I always have to get them when I'm dining on French food.  And they were good enough to impress my boyfriend as well (it was his first time eating escargots) that he would be willing to eat them again.  Plus you will have enough sauce after you finish to dip the baguette into.\n\nDinner arrived promptly with an oh so delicate presentation.  The tender pears and grapes on my plate were just arranged so perfectly, yet there was plenty of them to savor.  I have had duck before but never like this, this was exquisite!  The duck was not too fatty or stringy, it was just perfect.  This green peppercorn sauce it was in was one of the most flavorful, indulgent sauces for meat that I have ever had in my life.  I wish I could learn how to recreate it!  Truffled polenta was the right, light and creamy texture with the truffle essence slightly enhancing the grain.  I ate every single bite, not even thinking I could pull of the feat,  because it was THAT delicious!  Alex really like his pork tenderloin, it was stacked so neatly on the mashed potatoes.  I don't eat bacon so I didn't try his meat but he said it was tender and tasty.  He did say to me that I need to try the potatoes: I couldn't place the herbs and spices used there, but it was unique and pleasant.  \n\nAlex asked for the dessert menu.  They told us they were out of the Tarte du Jour which was fine by us.  After much deliberation, I had to go for the cheese plate in lieu of something sugary.  Also, another reason Alex picked this restaurant, he knows I love my cheese!  On the cheese plate was Saint Agur (Monts du Velay, Auvergne, [Cow]), Sainte-Maure (Caprifeuille, Vall\u00e9e de la Loire, [Goat]), Comt\u00e9 (Massif jurassien, [Cow]), Marshall's Farm Orange Blossom Natural Honey, Marshall's Farm Natural Honey, Unfiltered-Raw, Apple & Walnuts.  Alex told them to leave the walnuts off the plate and they had no problem doing that.  The cheese plate arrived and there was a lit candle stuck in the wedge of bleu cheese!  I was astonished, birthday cheese for me!  Alex told them that it was my birthday when making the reservation, they made a note of it!  As I finally decided on a wish, I blew out the candle... it came back to life.  So they pulled the trick candle on me, no worries, just means I got a dozen wishes!  My favorite was the Comte cow cheese, which was a harder cheddar.  There were many complex flavors to this cheese, with a bit of nuttiness.  Alex enjoyed the goat cheese the most, which was very buttery and creamy.  And the bleu cheese was very soft, not too pungent and sharp.  It came with very light and crisp apples thinly sliced and stuck together vertically.  I'm still trying to figure out how they did that.  They also had grapes on the plate (perhaps instead of the walnuts) along with a very delicate honey.  A wonderful way to end the meal.\n\nGo here, eat divine food, feel very welcome :0).", "author": "Lori D."}

This place was absolutely wonderful! I can't tell you enough how cozy this place was. The lighting was dim yet romantic. The Chef was ABSOLUTELY wonderful, he was very personable and made sure his guests were happy, (and happy I was). \nI have been to many restaurants but not one where the Chef comes out to greet you and by the way gave me a kiss on each cheek, which is so French! I loved it! Not only did he greet at the enterance, he checked on our table a couple more times just to make sure we were pleased with his food. \nHis food was beautiful, the presentation was great. Oh and delicious, I picked from the Vegetable Menu, and everything including the desert was great, I am not sure what I ate, but it was ALL GOOD!\n\nI highly recommend this place just even if it is for the ambiance!

Michael is precise and attentive, skilled with wine pairing, and understands the needs of the patrons that frequent this establishment. The proprietors, a Caucasian man, Philip, and Asian woman (a wonderfully married couple), know exactly how to make your night one to remember and keep returning for more every year. \n\nAs you enter Philips graciously greets all of the guests that enter and for any female patrons, would give the classic European double cheek air-kiss.\n\nThe dining room can seat about 40-45 comfortably and there was a good diverse cross section of patrons for the night at 8:30 PM. Caucasian and Asian adult patrons were mostly in attendance.\n\nLast Saturday, they had a splendid menu prepared. The evening started with a cauliflower amuse boush to wet the appetite for the foie gras appetizer paired with warm French bread. The richness of foie gras is not to be missed and my dinner companions thoroughly enjoyed their first time of having foie gras as well as French cuisine.\n\nA flavorful butternut squash puree filled your senses and it was a wonderful compliment to the chilly San Francisco air outside. The soft orange color of the puree was perfect as it reflected the light yellow walls of Chapau! \n\nThe rabbit entre was accompanied by glazed carrots, drizzled with a tangy sauce, and it only had the slight hint of the rabbit meat. This is a perfect dish for adventurous eaters, but do not want to be overwhelmed by unfamiliar senses.\n\nDrinks for the night included still bottled water, chamomile tea, a magnificent orange soup with hazelnut praline and a hint of mint, and a 2000 vintage dessert wine that effervescent in your mouth leaving a dry and satisfying taste behind for you to relish the delights of the night. \n\nFor an enjoyable Saturday evening and a $45-50 meal, Chapeau! should be your first French dinner destination.", "author": "Joseph Y."}

We made reservations for December 30 and looked forward to a meal in what we had been told was one of the outstanding restaurants of San Francisco.\n\nWhen we arrived we were warmly greeted by the hostess and were escorted to our seat in the lively and attractive dining room by the executive chef.  Everything was fine up till then.  We sat at our table for a good 10 minutes before anyone approached us.  \n\nFinally a very imperious waiter with a French accent gave us menus, then immediately left. He retuned a few minutes later with pencil and pad in hand asking if we we're ready to order.  He just stood there waiting for us to order.  I had to ask if there were any specials that evening.  That was a mistake.  He quickly mentioned a couple of specials that were hard to understand, however one was a grilled rib of beef for two which we saw being served at a nearby table.   From a distance it looked good so we ordered it, along with French Onion Soup and the raw salmon appetizer.  Both were quite good.  The beef, however was quite greasy and tough and  very disappointing--especially since when we paid our bill we discovered it was $100.00, which we had not been told.  Since all the other entrees on the menu were in the $20-$35.00 range we had no idea our entree would be $100.00  for two.  Needless to say our gift certificate only covered our entree. So while this restaurant may be well regarded, be sure to ask the prices for the specials.  We feel we got stuck. And I think it was mostly because our waiter wasn't paying attention to us or giving us all the information we deserved.  Our bill (for two) was over $250.00.  Watch out!", "author": "James H."}

I have a hard time reviewing a restaurant I haven't been to in a long time so it's only fair I do it when the experience is fresh. \n\nThe Chapeau menu has several prix fixe line ups, all reasonably priced. There is a 3 course early bird special (from 5pm to 6pm) for around 26 bucks. The course selections are equally weighted between meat and fish. \n\nThe service is rather sloppy and unprofessional, although it is attentive. \n\nMy three courses consisted of a salmon gravlax app, the mussels and fries for a main course and a \"basil\" infused napoleon for desert. \n\nThe gravlax was just ok, way too much salmon in a ring mold on a plate with two small cross cut potato chips. It had a few fried capers and some hard boiled egg around the edge of the plate. I would have like to have seen a bit more attention paid to this plate - which could have been great. Three stars. \n\nThe mussels just got in the way of the excellent wine, butter and garlic sauce at the bottom of the bowl. That stuff alone and some warm crusty bread and I'm in hog heaven. They were good though, all opened nice and clean and easy to remove. Four stars. I'd order this again. The fries were hot and crispy. \n\nThe Basil Napoleon was plated sideways - not at all what I expected from a napoleon. There was a mixture of tropical fruits, a basil infused syrup and something like a zabaglione. There were three micro thin wafers separating the \"layers\" placed vertically in the dish. I didn't like it much, but the basil did work very well with the fruit. Two stars for this guy. \n\nMy wife got the escargots as an appetizer. These were incredible. They were \"grilled\" in rosemary skewers and served with thinly sliced potatoes. I'd never had them this way and would definitely get these next time. Four stars and a real redeemer. \n\nOverall, this is 3 and a half - rounded up to four since the service is what bothered me so much. It wasn't rude, just... sloppy. That's the only way I can put it.", "author": "Randy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-23", "description": "After coming here last Saturday, our (the lady's and my) impression of Chapeau! wasn't too great initially, but that was due to bad luck I suppose. Either that or the waiter was being hasty. The restaurant was pretty crowded too, with little room between our table and the two tables next to us. In any case, the waiter spilled two glasses of water and the vase of flowers on our table while he was setting up, all in the span of 5-7 minutes. Pretty ridiculous to be able to manage that.\n\nChef Philippe, however, made the night a very pleasant one.  His amicable personality just makes you feel right at home! In any case, we were still full from our meal earlier in the day and unfortunately didn't feel hungry enough to eat as much as we would've liked, so we ordered the Fourme d'Ambert Tart appetizer to share, a Cassoulet de Toulouse for her and Maple Leaf Seared Duck for myself.\n\nThe tart was a great start to our dinner, featuring pears and frisee salad, which I believe had bleu cheese in it, and fairly light. It was pretty big, even for the two of us to share, so it might be more filling for an individual having one for him/herself. However, appetizers aren't the entr\u00e9e, so obviously they shouldn't fill you up! The cassoulet de toulouse had a fairly large portion size and is served in a casserole pot. It has lamb, duck, and pork sausages in there which all added up to an exquisite blend of juicy meat. Highly recommended. The duck I had ordered, on the other hand, was pretty lacking. I think it was something like 8-10 small slices of duck, cooked to your liking (I had no idea you could eat duck medium rare! Shows how little I know). Aside from the duck, theres some peeled grapes and pears on the side, but not much else. Again, I repeat: pretty lacking. But the quality of food, as expected, was excellent.\n\nAlthough our experience wasn't poor, it wasn't excellent either. Unfortunately, we weren't able to try the many dishes that Chapeau! has to offer, but someday maybe we will. And.. Chef Philippe's hospitality sure does make you want to come back again!  He gave a cheek kiss goodbye to my girlfriend. I was sad. Maybe next time Chef Philippe will kiss my cheek.\n\nSidenote: Their BREAD is DELICIOUS!", "author": "Hanyong C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-25", "description": "Okay, so we also saw Chapeau reviewed on \"Check Please! Bay Area\"... and that's the major reason my partner and I chose to celebrate my birthday there last night.  I love well prepared French cuisine: nouvelle or old-school, when it''s right, it's heaven.  What I saw on CPBA  convinced me it was worth an excursion. \n\nMore deciding factors in our choice of Chapeau included that escargot and duck breast be on the menu.  Bam!  \"Traditional Escargots de Bourgogne in Butter, Parsley & Garlic\", reads the menu, and that's what you get and then some.  I missed the novelty of the shells and hardware (I love props), but the baked escargot served in their own pools of clarified butter and an abundance of garlic and parsley was wicked... I had to make an effort not to fill myself up on baguette and the remainder of the tasty butter pools which would prevent me from enjoying the rest of the dishes to come.  The duck breast seemed to be made especially for me:  the medium rare was perfection; the duck breast succulent and tender.\n\nThe early bird special is a great choice if you plan on dining between 5 and 6 pm.  We wanted to get bang for our buck so we made reservations for 5:15 pm.  I'd online-researched a good Pinot Noir and picked up a bottle of Shea Vineyards, Oregon 2008 at K&L on 4th Street (fab place - unique wines and great staff knowledge and assistance).  Chapeau has an impressive wine list on its own, but again we were on bang-for-the-buck mode (isn't just about everyone these days) and with  Chapeau's corkage fee being $18, you can buy a mid- to expensive bottle of wine at retail, pay the corkage and avoid a 3-figure wine cost on your dinner bill.  I shared tastings with Philippe the owner and my waiter and they approved my choice.  \n\nOn that same theme, because the early bird / prix fixe menu is so affordable and it was my birthday afterall,  we ordered an additional starter for each of us: pan seared scallop on a little bed of pesto risotto served with a lobster reduction sauce.  It was charming and sublime.  A complete miniature dinner plate on its own, the scallop was hearty yet tender and flavorful; the risotto just the right side of al dente for my preference, and the lobster reduction a nice punctuation. Oh, and before I forget, I am a fussy and impatient diner, so I was disappointed to see the escargot and Philip's chestnut soup (excellent btw!) appear before the additional scallop appetizer we especially ordered.  We were told by our support waiter that the scallop would be served after the escargot which, I realized made much more sense for the sequence.  It was my bad wannabe gourmand party foul... and I appreciate the waiter's attention to detail. Not quite ready to jump into the Pinot Noir  I asked for a suggestion of white to go with the scallops.  The waiter seved me a perfectly paired Sancerre.\n\nAnd before I go on, there was a delightful amuse bouche of filet of anchovy in a bed of baked fio dough that we were served on the house before our meal began. \n\nAs I said, the duck breast was exactly the way I love it.  Philip's pork tenderloin was delectable.  And, as it was still my birthday dinner we again went bang-for-the-buck and each ordered an after dinner mesclun salad with a creme dijonnaise dressing, red seedless grapes, pistachio, fried camembert and toasted walnut bread.  A great way to change it up after your main course and before dessert.\n\nAs I dreaded, I was subjected to the happy birthday singing by the staff when my profiteroles came for dessert.  I'd expected something sinister when I saw Philip chatting with one of the waters at the door.  But the restaurant patrons joined in and sang sincerely and I was humbled and felt like I was really being feted.  \n\nI'm looking forward to my return to Chapeau!  The prix fixe menus starting at $38 for a three-course meal and $46 for four courses of your choice is sill a great bang-for-your-buck for outstanding French cuisine and service. \n\nBravo, Chapeau!

The service was great though, very attentive and informative without being too intrusive.  As many people have noted, the owner made a point of coming by and helping us choose a bottle of wine.  I loved that he made 2 suggestions - one low-end and one high-end in price with compliments for both . We ended up going with the cheaper bottle and were very pleased.\n\nOn to the food - we started with the oysters, foie gras, and sweetbreads.  The oysters were pretty standard, but the foie gras was really yummy.  There were 2 large slabs seared on top of a little piece of cake with raspberry sauce and fresh raspberries on the plate.  The sweetbreads were as good as they could be for me, because the whole idea and texture just creeps me out.  I think my boyfriend enjoyed them though.  \n\nFor dinner, I had the seared duck breast and he had the lamb shank.  Both of them were really awesome.  The duck was cooked just right with lots of flavor and juiciness.  It was served with a risotto that was creamy with healthy additions of pulled duck meat as well.  The lamb shank was huge but slowly cooked so that the meat was tender and just fell off the bone.\n\nWe will definitely think about going back to Chapeau again.

It was bistro style food and it's obvious that the chefs can execute delicious meals; however, its a bit more geared for American audiences. I'm a bit spoiled in that sense, so I'm picky when it comes to french food. But if you do like bistro food don't worry you'll enjoy this place. The service always kept up with us throughout our dinner, but most of the time it seemed somewhat rushed. The restaurant is small so reservations are a must and parking is a bit hard to find so you will want to come earlier if you drive here. We opted for the 3 for $40 each option. The best part of the meal was the sweetbreads that I had ordered as my first course. It was full of flavor and stood our well on its own. The trio of salmon appetizer was just OK we definitely liked the sweetbreads better. The cassoulet had all the right elements of a classic cassoulet. Our only complaints are that the meat needed a little more salt and that the beans were undercooked (as was previously stated in other reviews). I chose the halibut, which worked well as a whole when combined with the broth and the bread. I almost wish I had gotten another slice of bread to continue tasting it all together. As for dessert, the molten lava chocolate cake was great. I ordered the lemon tart and all I can say is that it was overly bitter (not much powdered sugar to balance it) and that the crust was way too dry. It seems as though they cooked the crust of the tart for too long because it was flavorless and crumbling as I tried to eat it. Anyways, Chapeau seems like it attracts people that are in the mood for some bistro dishes, but I don't think I'd want to go back.", "author": "Stephanie P."}

The food was near superlative, the scene was bustling, and the atmosphere was intimate yet casual. The only note that did not quite keep up was the service, which strived for the same greatness, but missed on a number of levels.\n\nWe enjoyed Chapeau! during Dine About Town, which featured a 3-course prix fixe menu for $34.95 - a truly great deal for food of this caliber. Even if you strayed from this menu and stuck to the regular offering (which my husband did), it was only a mere few dollars more. I began with an excellent Mesclun salad with grapes, pistachios, fried camembert and walnut bread. The combination of flavors here was just right - and the walnut bread was the perfect complement. Then I moved on to the bacon wrapped pork loin. Sure, it would probably be difficult for this dish not to taste good - but it was especially so. I finished with a Nuage de Noix, which consisted of roasted pistachios, almonds and hazelnuts in a frozen chantilly and Italian meringue. Yeah, I didn't know what it was either when I ordered it, but I sure am glad I did. Compliments of the chef, we also were offered a Basil Napoleon - not my thing, as I don't typically care for the new age dessert that consists of non-traditional spices and flavors, but interesting.\n\nAll of this was served in close quarters. Be aware that if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, I don't believe there is a spot in this restaurant for you. Tables are very closely packed. At first, I was a little taken aback by this, but it added to the charm of the place for me. Not everyone will agree.\n\nService was just a bit off. I overheard the table to my right complain about a couple of things - first the wine, then the preparation of the fish. Mind you, I think they were kind of...annoying. But the waiter didn't have quite the right response either time. Then he delivered their dinner to us - that certainly didn't help matters. And somehow still in the end, it wasn't sorted out when we each received the others' bill. I overheard the table to my left complain about the slow pace of service - and indeed, it at times seemed to move like a snail. I certainly felt that way when my tea never arrived and I had to ask for it after my husband had gotten his coffee. Other little things, like the wrong fork for salad, just gave the place more of an amateurish feel than it deserves.\n\nStill, this is an excellent value for excellent food. I would return and recommend it, absolutely.", "author": "Kiesha R."}

Amazing, one minute they are in your mouth, the next there is nothing. Simply the best I've ever had.\n-The Palate Cleansers were interesting, one was tart (Colonel) and one was slightly bitter (Trou Normand). I prefer the Colonel.\n\n- The skate wing entree is fabulous on its own, very flavorful and melts in your mouth good, but the sauce that it came in was far too tart for my palate. \n- There was a special prime rib for 2 deal, which they carve at your table and is served with bone marrow. The prime rib was decent, but the bone marrow was delicious (and its good for you!)\n- The Filet Mignon, which I had to convince my father to at least have them cook medium (he always prefers his meat well done), was soft, tender and very juicy. \n\nFinally, the chocolate cake desert is rich, filled with molten chocolate and delicious.

The atmosphere was nice - quiet enough to have a conversation, but not freaky-quiet. I was having a great time throughout my entire dinner, talking about how I wanted to come back once a week. Honestly, this is some of the best food I have had in a while. \n\nBut here's where my experience was basically killed. The check arrives, and we notice that we were charged for 4 glasses of champagne ($12) instead of 4 glasses of kir royale ($7.50). We thought it was a simple mistake, so we told the waiter, who I think may be the owner. \n\nHomeboy says that it was not a mistake. When he served us our kir royales, he informed us that he had run out of the sparkling wine that they normally use for the kirs, so he was using champagne instead. \n\nWe informed him that since he had run out of what we had ordered, and not told us until AFTER he had already brought the half-made kirs to our table, that we had assumed that any upgrade in bubbly quality was on the house. \n\nHe says something along the lines of \"I told you I was going to use champagne\". \n\nI say something along the lines of \"and that was supposed to imply a surcharge?\"/ \n\nHe says \"yes\". \n\nWe stare at him dumbfounded. \n\nHe stares at us. \n\nHe makes no attempt to acknowledge that this was weird, or even to empathize with us for not understanding. \n\nThere is an awkward silence. \n\nWe say, ok, I guess we are paying for it. It is only a few extra dollars per person, after all, and I'm not about to go all postal for something so small. \n\nWe pay the bill. \n\nI am totally bummed because I was loving that place for the first 2 hours that I was there, and then feel like I got seriously shafted in the last 5 minutes. I'm not even pissed about the extra 5 bucks that I had to spend, but just the principle of it. \n\nHe ran out of something and didn't tell us. \nHe gave us something more expensive and didn't make it clear that he was going to charge us extra. \nHe made no attempt to rectify the situation when we made it clear that we felt like there had been a mistake. \n\nI really liked the food, and I will probably go back because it was so delicious, but I feel like I can't trust the people who work there, and I think it will take several really good experiences for me to be able to write this one off. \n\nI am sad.

Three and a half stars, but that's not allowed so I'm going to round up to 4 stars. Mostly because of the entertaining couple sitting next to us though, not because of the restaurant. We shared some laughs with them and it happened to be her birthday as well which made for some added conversation.\n\nWhen we got to Chapeau we were greeted by the Chef and quickly tended to by the other staff.\n\nFor those of you who don't want to read everything I'll give you a quick summary\n\nService: 4.5\nFood: 3\nAmbiance: 2\nOther: Parking: 2\n\n\nI was torn between a few different restaurants initially but ended up going with Chapeau based on reviews. It was our birthday dinner (mine the 10th hers the 12th) so I was looking for something a bit romantic but nothing overboard. The first thing I noticed walking into Chapeau was how loud it was. I don't mind a bit of noise but when I have to lean over the table to have a conversation it becomes a bit tiresome. The tables were too long and narrow putting us even further apart. \n\nWe decided on the \"Menu 1\" choice and ordered/shared the following:\n\nAppetizers:\nFoie Gras\nTrio Salmon\n\nEntrees:\nLavender Chicken\nCassoulet de Toulouse\n\nDessert:\nNuage de Noix\nCremee Brulee\n\nThe Foie Gras was good - my first time having it. It literally melted in my mouth and the apples it was served with were crisp and sweet. A good balance\n\nThe Trio of Salmon was sort of bland. The fried capers had no flavor, the egg mimosa was too strong, and there was almost no salmon on the plate \n\nThe presentation was excellent\n\n\nThe Lavender Chicken with Dijon Honey glaze tasted like a flower bed. All I could taste was the Lavender. The portions were extremely small and had we not gone with the Menu 1 selection (appetizer and desert) it would have been thought of like a bar-snack, not an entree.\n\nCassoulet with the Duck Leg Confit, sausage, and shredded lamb shoulder was actually quite good, but rather simple. The skin on the duck leg was perfectly crisp, the canellini beans excellent, and the portions a bit better than the Lavendar Chicken. The presentation was extremely disappointing though. It was served in a round, brown ceramic baking dish, on a white plate. Everything on the plate was brown which reminded me of a poor experience at Applebees I had four or five years ago.\n\n\nDesert was amazing\n\nThe Nuage de Noix had a wonderfully sweet but strong lemon flavor. It was velvety in texture and the nuts provided a great balance\n\nThe Creme Brulee was hands down the best I've ever had. I'm not a huge dessert person usually but any time I see a Creme Brulee is on the menu I have to order it. It has a delectable crust, easily breakable and amazingly crisp/sweet. The filling was rich and light\n\n\nAn added bonus came when the Chef found out it was our birthdays and had a Caramel Creme Puff sent out. It was airy, cold, and a good way to end the dinner. \n\nWith our Dinner we had ordered a bottle of Malbec, and with dessert a glass of Muscat. Our bill came to $154 before tip.\n\n\nOne of the biggest disappoints for me was the fact that the menu posted online is only about 80% accurate. Many of the entrees and appetizers are different. I expect that at a fine dining restaurant not all menu items may always be available depending on local ingredients, etc., but that wasn't the case for us. It was clear that the website had been neglected. \n\n\nConsidering I spent nearly $200 at the end of the night for average \"fancy\" food, in a loud environment.. I don't know that I'll be going back. The service was great but there are many other restaurants that I'd like to return to, and some that I'd like to experience still.\n\n\n\nP.S - The attire there wasn't really \"dressy\" or \"casual\". Think Jeans a button up.", "author": "A Z."}

Eating there is a whole different story! \n\nMy boyfriend and I went there for his birthday; it was a weekday and we went early (6:30 pm). We ordered the prix fixe four-course dinner (it was prix fixe but a small additional amount if you chose a filet mignon). First they served bread, which was crusty outside and warm inside; super good. There was a tiny cup of a very rich cream of cauliflower soup first. I don't like cauliflower generally, but the soup was delicious! It was so delicious that I can't even say \"I don't like cauliflower\" anymore. Our second course was a perfect large scallop atop a rich, creamy lobster risotto. It was incredible. At some point there was a palate cleansing sorbet; we had a choice of two, and we both chose a lemon-ginger-vodka one. The other option was also a citrus-type thing.\n\nMy boyfriend had sea bass, which had whipped potatoes underneath, and I had the filet mignon, which I asked for medium-well. The server, who was extremely nice, didn't snub me for it. It came out a little more on the well done side, which I think a lot of restaurants do for people who ask for medium well because they figure you're hardly going to complain that it's TOO well-done if you ordered medium-well in the first place. Even well-done, the steak was tender and delicious and pretty amazing. \n\nFor dessert we had a fantastic creme brulee, and a warm chocolate cake which oozed hot chocolately filling when we broke the little cake with a fork. It came with rum raisin ice cream. The warm chocolate cake could probably bring some people to tears, it's that good. \n\nThe service is very nice; the courses are very nicely timed, the place is pretty (decorated with some frilly hats, and your check is brought to you in a hat), but very small, and the tables are super close together. \n\nAs night wears on, they dim the lights more and more inside, which is nice. As people drink, it gets pretty loud, and there was no music, at least on the night we went. When we got our bill, the server put the hat with the bill on the table, rather than shoving it at the man, like a lot of places do, which was nice. \n\nThe clients were what you'd expect; older people early on, with younger people arriving later.", "author": "Dani Y."}

We also had a couple of glasses of wine, slightly overpriced but not terrible.  We weren't set that we were going to be getting the prix fixe menu, and we started with 1 appetizer to split between us, we each had an entree, and then we made the decision to go for a dessert to split. We were both disappointed that they didn't turn one of our meals into the prix fixe price when they did that for the people sitting next to us. We did not argue the point, which we should have, so some of the fault is our's, but I would expect at a good restaurant that it would be automatically done.\n\nAmbiance: It's VERY noisy inside due to the small space (we actually had to move the table so one of us could sit down). We could hear the entire conversation on both sides of us. We're not from SF or a large city, so this may be standard and maybe people from the city are so used to it that it doesn't bother them at all, but we had a hard time with it.\n\nStaff: Our waiter left a lot to be desired. We were uncomfortable on several occasions. There was just a big discrepancy between how we were treated and how some of the other tables were treated.\n\nFood: Delicious.  We had the black tiger prawn appetizer - 3 prawn wrapped in phylo dough (I think it was phylo dough) with tomato and onion was delicious. She had the filet mignon which was perfect.

Chapeau in French means a \"hat\", but as you may know, from the menu or other sources, adding an exclamation mark results in a new meaning of \"wow\". You could say \"c'est chapeau!\", the equivalent of \"bravo\" or \"hats off!\". And vraiment, that is what you will be saying by the time your experience, dining and otherwise, ends here. And your experience starts the minute you walk in the door, with jolly and convivial chef/owner Philippe Gardelle, who halls from Cotignac in Provence and never went to a culinary school, personally greeting you. Philippe and his wife Ellen opened Chapeau! in 1996 but in December 2007 they bought Clementine from owners Didier Labbe and Laurent Legendre, a space that used to house Alain Rondelli, and moved Chapeau! into the larger Clementine space in August 2009, which seats 49 plus 12 at the bar, compared to the old Chapeau!'s 35.  Decor is a bit sparse at the moment, the walls a comfortable yellow but unadorned. Having set the tone, from there the excellent staff take over and continue the outstanding personal service. Chapeau! offers an early bird 3 course prix fixe Sundays through Thursdays for $28 from 5 to 6 PM and which changes every two weeks. They also offer a 3 course prix fixe for $38, a 4 course prix fixe that adds a tasting fish for $46, and palate cleansers for an additional $4.50, the same as their a la carte price. There is also a vegetarian 3 course prix fixe for $38. My friend and I chose the 4 course prix fixe with the palate cleansers. The baguette bread brought to our table was warm and not too hard, two qualities which I was very pleased with. On each table was a little square glass candy dish with heart-shaped corners and peaked sides filled with red and green jingle bells, the kind you might find on a jester's hat, a very nice touch. Our meal began with an amuse bouche of white truffled cream of cauliflour soup, very nice. Initially, i had planned to get the deep-fried black tiger prawns with shredded phylo dough, tomato & onion marmalade, petits legumes, and herbed aioli, $13 a la carte, but upon hearing about the foie gras appetizer special, $18 a la carte, $6 with the prix fixe, I ordered it instead. The foie gras ($19.50) arrived on a square plate, pan-seared lobes arranged on toasted brioche pedestals, the bottom of the plate covered with thin zigzagging lines of apple gastrique. In the center a thinly sliced apple wedge stood straight up; at the bottom corner a manicured pile of peppery greens that cut the richness of the other elements. Stunning plating for an equally blissful dish. My friend had the salade Landaise (a reference to the Landes region in Aquitaine) with frisee, duck confit & smoked duck magret (the breast meat of the Moulard duck, known for its superior quality), fingerling potato chips, and classic French vinaigrette (white wine vinegar, shallots, salt, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and olive oil), $12.50 a la carte. Quite good. Next came the tasting fish: pan-seared dayboat scallop with lobster sauce on pesto risotto with basil pollen and tomato confit. The scallop was quite good, and the risotto especially so, absolutely perfect actually. I loved every bite. Next came the palate cleansers. I had the Trou Normand (French for \"Norman Hole\"), a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the apetite and make room for the next course. In this case it appropriately came with a matching green apple sorbet. My friend had the Colonel: a lemon-ginger sorbet with a citrus-infused vodka. Sorbet Colonel is usually a lemon sorbet drizzled with vodka. They were both very nice. For my entree, I chose the sauteed striped bass with Yukon gold mashed potato, fondue provencale (tomatoes, court-bouillon, kalamata olives), caramelized pearl onions, jus de poulet (chicken), basil oil, and fried leeks, $24 a la carte. Chef Philippe Gardelle came around to check on the food, and was kind enough to explain the ingredients in the fondue provencale. Fondue here means \"blended\" as oppose to \"melted\" or \"molten\". An excellent dish. My friend had the bacon-wrapped natural pork tenderloin with polenta puree, braised green swiss chard, and apple-calvados sauce. An exceptional dish. For dessert, I had the Basil Napoleon, with Maui pineapple, manilla [sic] mango, banana, kiwi, strawberries, champagne-citrus pastry cream, and Feuille de Bric (literally brick sheets, thin sheets of wheat flour, the term bric being etymologically linked to phyllo...), $8.50 a la carte. This was a very deconstructed Napoleon, not in the traditional stack, but just as delicious and easier to eat! My friend had the warm chocolate cake with banana flambee, rum & banana ice cream, and caramel sauce, $8.50 a la carte. He loved it. On our way out, Chef Philippe Gardelle thanked us personally and shook our hands. Chapeau! is the best French bistro in San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-03-06", "description": "Note (March 20/07):  I just noticed that my accenting of French characters vanished!  So I've gone and fixed things, but with the unaccented, plain vanilla English letters.  Everything else is the same. *sigh*  [end note]\n\nWell, I suppose it had to happen one of these days...a 5-star review.  Which can only mean one thing...I had an absolutely amazing meal and experience!  My father, who has \"dined all over the world, including in many Michelin star restaurants\" declared this place to be so amazing that he wrote on the comment card \"tous les saveurs sont magnifiques!  Merci bien pour une experience extraordinaire!\"  (if you'll forgive my butchering of French grammar).  \n\nDespite my dad's tendency for exaggeration and superfluous superlatives, this was truly a meal to remember.  The chef and owner, M. Phillipe Gardelle, quite obviously enjoys his craft and his attention to detail and inventiveness clearly shows through in every plate that leaves the kitchen.  And every time he runs out the door to bid adieu to his guests.  He told us he decided to come to San Francisco from France for 2 years - 15 years ago!  France's loss, our gain.\n\nM. Gardelle has created a fantastic restaurant tucked away in what's almost the middle of nowhere, nestled amongst synagogues, Chinese markets and restaurants, and a lot of houses.  The bistro is small and cramped, but not unpleasantly so.  We were lucky to get in because somebody canceled their reservation.  \n\nOn to the meal!  After going ga-ga over the menu, we were informed of the specials that evening - rib steak for two, served with gratin and marrow bones.  And if that wasn't enough for the third person at the table (who will remain nameless to protect her aura of innocence), they also had foie gras.  So that settled it for her, and decided that marrow bones required ordering that large steak, so she and my dad had that.  He had the moules avec pommes frites (the best damn frites I've ever had, possibly a tie), and I had the warm brie over a potato pancake served with some frisee of sorts.  All were absolutely amazing.  And so was the half glass of Sauternes wine that went with the foie gras.  Wow.\n\nThen we had decided to go for the 4 course menu because the \"fish tasting\" course consisted of a pan seared sea scallop (yum!) served on top of an \"open ravioli\" with butternut squash filling and a citrus honey sauce.  Now I'm not the biggest butternut squash fan in the room, but this was phenomenal.  The scallop was cooked to perfection (as my dad remarked many a time throughout the rest of the night), and the combination of flavours was completely unexpected and awesome.  (I'm going to run out of superlatives soon...)\n\nThe mains arrived, and the steak was sliced and served at the table for the other two diners.  Complete with rib bone and two giant marrow bones.  Even with meat served at the table, they went out of their way to present it impeccably, and I had a taste of the wonderful meat that was garnished with a bit of fleur de sel and served with four amazing sauces - roquefort, bearnaise, peppercorn, and truffle.  I tasted all four, and the roquefort and truffle were the very clear winners to the point of making me want to grab the little dish and just drink the stuff down.\n\nHaving just had a steak the previous night (see my review of Sundance...it's nice when parents visit!), I had opted for the cassoulet, which is apparently a French peasant-ish kind of dish.  Either way, it consisted of white beans (which normally I'm not a big fan of, but decided to go for it anyways), braised lamb, a duck leg, and a small sausage.  The duck meat fell apart in my mouth and the lamb was already largely mixed in with the sauce.  The sausage was incredible.\n\nAnd then as if this kind of gluttony wasn't enough, we couldn't forget the dessert portion of the 4 course menu.  Most of them looked and sounded amazing.  We collectively had the chocolate cake (totally worth the 10 minutes for them to make it from scratch), the profiteroles, and and orange concoction that contained orange sorbet, creme de menthe, and Grand Marnier.  All were excellent.  And we also got a serving of a fourth dessert, the diced fruits in basil cream and with thin cookies.  Heavenly, all of it.\n\nThe wine was also excellent - a Hautes Cotes de Nuits that nicely complemented all of our meals.  And taking a look through the wine list, I was completely impressed with the selection, the prices, and also just how easy it was to find the kind of wine you were looking for.\n\nAll in all, Chapeau! lives up to its name, both for bringing the bill in a chapeau, and for making you go wow! many times during the meal.\n\nSante!", "author": "Adam G."}

Well executed, I remember noting that the white meat was still juicy, an often rare feat in dining. The sauce a bit too sweet for my taste, but not unpalatable or unfitting for the chicken. Yet... I found it so very lackluster, so much so I found myself talking and simply consuming without much thought of what I was eating, much like cafeteria food. I found my mother's cassoulet a bit more appealing, though I have to admit I have a negative bias against cassoulet for being too rich of a dish. Still, the cassoulet matched expectations of what a good, standard cassoulet should be. I didn't get a chance to try my father's flounder but he commented it was just \"normal\" and nothing to get too excited about.\nOverall... the main entrees were:\nNot very pretty, not very flavorful, just simply... not very memorable. The often mentioned creme brulee was barely on par, I was disappointed that the caramelized sugar did not crack, not even a credible dent,. The custard had a very displeasing texture, more like butter than pudding, with a greasy feeling leftover after taking a bite. It had a good note of vanilla but overall it was boring, and not at all worth requesting.\nIt would be harsh to rate Chapeau! with a 2; they do have a well rounded service, delicious pan to begin the meal, a good wine selection, fair pricing, and the food is somewhere between blase and good. At best, I would like to think of it as a 2.5, but will give it a 3 because I think Chapeau! does know it's faults and is working on its improvement.\nBut, would I come back here again?

I clean plate in a matter of minutes every time.\n\nThe mussels & pomme frite were pretty good also, though I'd much prefer my salade landaise.\n\nFor the main course, I had the cassoulet. Though I'm not too big of a fan of beans, the sausage, the duck leg and lamb were cooked just right. The meat fell right off the bones and it was as tender & juicy as it can be. I've also had the sea bass, it's not bad but not too memorable.\n\nDessert...I love the warm chocolate cake! What a perfect way to end a meal. It is so rich and so divine. The chocolate oozes out from the center, all hot and gooey. It also comes with a scoop of ice cream. I'm not too keen on rum raisin, so I had changed mine to a basic Vanilla.\n\nI leave this place with glee every time I visit. And after the bliss has passed, I yearn for yet another Chapeau! meal.

I live in the neighborhood and the reviews seemed great. I am not usually a fan of French cuisine but the food did not disappoint.  I loved the mustard based dressing on the mesclun salad and the fried camembert added a delicious texture to the greens. Although I did  not taste my husbands duck salad he said he enjoyed it. For my entre I ordered the poussin which had bacon in the sauce.  I was concerned it would be greasy but that was certainly not the case. As with the salad I finished every drop!  I am not a dessert person so I cannot comment.\n\nThe dining room is nicely decorated and is very pleasant.

I've heard both great and awful reviews about the place and decided to make a decision myself and did a double date there.  \n\nI remembered that we ordered foie gras and another appetizer (can't remember), duck cassoulet, lamb shank, salmon, and fillet mignon.  The sommelier had also recommended a simple table wine to go with our meal.  When the food showed up, it looks very appealing but taste was so off.  I mean, if it can be under/over-cooked and if it can be over/under-seasoned or salted, it was.  Poor or bad cooking execution.  What good is it for my body when it only feeds my eyes?\n\n I love foie gras and the one I received was kind of burnt and dry.  Foie gras, as we all know, was the fat liver of duck/goose, and if that's dry, it was all over for me.  Because it was overcooked, you have crispy dry piece and the oil from the fat was just oil from the fat.   When cooked right, it melts in your mouth like butter with the liver taste.  So, yeah, off to a bad start with appetizer.  \n\nLamb was good and a little dry, but seriously, they can afford to throw in some greens.  It was good, but then again, not great and could be way better.\n\nFillet mignon was not cooked medium-rear as ordered, but the mushroom on it was good.  Then again the rock star should of been the beef.  \n\nThe duck cassoulet was ok, nothing to brag about, really.\n\nSalmon was dry.  Even looking at the pictures of the fish just now, they looked still kind of dry on the outside.  Check the pictures out yourself.\n\nWe had a four top and the only thing we like was the wine, since that was the case, we just stop by the wine shop instead.\n\nIf the chef had a bad day, it cost him four customers.  Should of took the day off chef.  What can I say?\n\nOne star each for decor, wine, and service.", "author": "Vanna S."}

I was really looking forward to eating here with my valentine, but was disappointed to say the least. \n\nWe had 9:15pm reservations. When we arrived at the restaurant there were 2 couples waiting outside. I was a bit irritated when Chef sat a couple who came AFTER us before seating us and gave them the best table (by the window). We were seated in one of the middle tables in between two couples. The restaurant was extremely crowded. I was so close to the two tables on either side of me that I could have reached over and eaten their food. The crowd and closeness almost reminded me of a cafeteria. I felt claustrophobic and it was a bit hard to have a conversation because of the close proximity of the other patrons. \n\nAnyway, on to food and service. We waited about 10-15min before we were given our wine. This basically set the tone for the whole pace of the meal. Each course took fooooooorever to come out. Two hours later we were only on our third course! The waiters that evening weren't very attentive and we had to refill our own wine. The service wasn't what I was expecting, especially when I compare it to the service I received at Clementine down the street. \n\nThe stand out dish for me was the bacon-wrapped scallop with pasta and a lobster sauce. The scallop was absolutely PERFECT. I only wish it hadn't taken so long to come out. The filet and oxtail dish was really tasty as well. The meat was nice and tender and the flavors reminded me of beef bourguignon. Too bad that by the time they brought out our dish, the sauce had coagulated creating an unappetizing skin.  I think it was about midnight when we were eating this dish so I was ready to crawl under the table and fall asleep. We didn't end up leaving the restaurant until 1:00am!! That's about 4 hours for the meal! Our dinner at French Laundry didn't even take that long and we had twice as many courses there. \n\nOn the plus side, they have a great wine selection and Chef Gardelle is very charming and personable. He came by our table a couple times to see how we were doing. The food overall was good, but the delivery was weak. I would have been such a happy camper had the food come out at a nice pace. Chef's friendliness and the regular menu has peaked my interest enough to return to this restaurant (but not soon). I just hope the service isn't so slow on a regular basis.", "author": "Andrea G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-24", "description": "We went here because of YELP. \n\nMy party and I made reservations through Open Table for two and the restaurant even called to confirm. So we're thinking...this place must and will be amazing!  As fellow Yelpers have attested to, we anticipated a fine dining experience..especially with 881 reviews and 4  1/2 stars, what could go wrong right?  \n\nWell, we arrived and were seated instantly. My coat was checked and hung. Drinks (water and champagne), bread and butter were served right away. Great start. After sitting there for 10 minutes, this man, I'm not sure if he's the owner/manager/head waitress but he gave us the menus and took our order (He also took every table's order thereafter so I'm sure he's the top personnel) . We went with the early bird of $28/person and shared it family style.\n\nFOOD:\n1st Course: \n\nSOUP OF THE DAY (ONION SOUP)-\nTasted like melted cheddar cheese and precooked yet over cooked thick onion broth.  The bread at the bottom of the bowl was too soggy and had been sitting in the soup too long. \n\nTRADITIONAL ESCARGOT DE BOURGOGNE IN BUTTER-PARSLEY & GARLIC SAUCE-\nThe butter-parsley sauce was rich and could very well resemble olive oil.  The escargot was soft to the bite, excellent. \n\n2nd Course:\n\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND MUSSELS STEAMED WITH WHITE WINE, SHALLOT & PARSLEY, POMMES FRITES & ROUILLE-\nGood but not great following the escargot. The sauce was similar to the butter-parsley & garlic sauce used with the escargot only a little more diluted. Good portion.\n\nFARM RAISED CANADIAN SALMON BRAISED FENNEL & LEEK, BACON FLAVORED FINGERLING POTATOES, SHALLOT CONFIT, SAFFRON EMULSION-\nSalmon was medium rare as the guy that took our order had stated, but almost crusted on the top and tasted sweet. I'm a huge fan of salmon and sake but the sweet flavor just threw my taste buds off. \n\n3rd Course: \n\nBASIL NAPOLEON W/ MAUI PINEAPPLE, MANILLA MANGO, BANANA, KIWI & STRAWBERRIES/CHAMPAGNE-CITRUS PASTRY CREAM/ FEUILLE DE BRIQUE-\nDon't let the name and description fool you. It would have been a beautiful and excellent dish if it had not been for the basil flavored sauce. The basil is potent. If you get this dish, make sure you omit the sauce or get it on the side. Personally, this dish was so confusing; it'd be better served as an appetizer than dessert. It really made me wish I had chosen ice cream instead =/.\n\nTAHITIENNE VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRUL\u00c9E, ALMOND TUILE-\nThis made up for the Basil Napolean and reminded me why I was there in the first place...excellent. Great portion.\n\nAMBIENCE:\nObviously I missed the part where it says \"a French Bistro\" under their restaurant name. It's true, they're a bistro with a fine dining price tag. The place is dimly lit and the tables are very close to one another. Let's just say every time I looked up from my plate, I was practically a part of the neighboring parties' table! I had to avoid eye contact so they wouldn't think otherwise.  Also, be prepared for a loud dining experience as the place is small. It's pretty packed and everyone is talking too.  With that said, It's not a date friendly nor romantic place. And it definitely lacked the French ambiance I was looking for, the head personnel were Asian speaking French...which is great...but the atmosphere just wasn't there...and our bus boy/waiter was Latino who didn't understand English.  Just a really differently infused yet diverse place. Truth be told, I was expecting a place more like the quaint Italian restaurants off of Columbus Street in North Beach with Italian servers or fast paced Chinese waiters serving food in Chinatown. This place was just different.\n\nI always like to judge a place by its restroom...if you don't need to go, don't go. Chapeau's women's restroom (single) reeked of urine and d\u00e9cor sincerely lacked for such a high-end bistro.\n\nSTAFF/SERVICE: Very attentive, friendly, and fast. Considering we were seated by the kitchen and along the wall that paralleled the aisle to the kitchen, staff was rushing back and forth every other minute. That was distracting...but they never let my water glass go empty. \n\nPersonally, the 1-3 star yelpers for Chapeau give a more accurate account and perception. Everyone else might have been buzzed. *This place serves wine like no other...every table had wine and the staff is excellent at refilling if you purchased a bottle! Maybe that's what helped them through their dinner and rate the restaurant so high.\n\nWe walked out of there $95 less (gratuity included).", "author": "Miss E."}

This is rare, however, it felt really warming and it was appreciated.\n\nPlace was packed on a Friday evening.  I admit it's louder than your average French restaurant, but that doesn't bother me.\n\nI opted for the 4-course meal.  Started with the Trio of Salmon, which was light and tasty.  The dish was plated nicely and everything on the dish was edible.  I was told by our server that every thing on each plate is there for a reason.  So, go figure!  Second, I had the scallop with risotto dish (this was their fish dish included in the the 4-course option).  The scallop was cooked perfectly and the risotto wasn't too heavy.  Just the right amount and a nice blend of flavors.  I chose the Filet Mignon w/ the Foie Gras.  This was DELICIOUS.  Foie Gras was melt-in-your mouth good.  My filet was cooked perfectly.  The mushrooms that accompanied the dish were great.  The earthy taste of the mushrooms really complimented the creamy foie gras and filet.  Lastly, I had the French Toast w/ Hazelnut Ice Cream.  By far the BEST tasting french toast I've ever had... too bad I was too full to finish the entire course.  \n\nI think this place offers a great value for French food.  The atmosphere does not come off as pretentious at all, which might turn you away from the fine dining experience.  You can come here dressed casually and not feel completely out of place.

She was personable and attentive--the wait staff was amazing but not overbearing.

The spinach salad is a bit less amazing, but definitely a good starter.\n\nWe had the duck breast and cassoulet as entrees.  I loved the tender duck, but I wasn't a fan of the cassoulet (which is really...a piece of lamb soaked in beans and sausages + sauce...kinda like chilli).  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the apple crisp (wow) and sorbet, which came in 2 scoops (passion fruit, pomegranate, and green apple).  The sorbet, once again, looked pretty, but it was average.  The apple crisp on the other hand is a MUST TRY!! \n\nTo top it off, this was all just around 1 bill.  :)  Quite reasonable for a Valentine's dinner, eh?

The young guy who took care of the patrons at the bar also took care of our table.  A nice person but sort of aloof and not attentive. I like to be offered things like coffee or after dinner drinks, etc. and he never did that and actually gave us our bill without clearing the dessert plates. He actually never came by to check how the main courses or desserts were. It may not seem like a big thing, but when you're spending nearly 300 bucks it would be nice to not have the check slammed down like at a diner.  The last time I was there I seem to remember a busser and a waitperson that made sure that waters were refilled, etc., but this time just the one bored waiter.  I hadn't eaten here in about a year, but felt the overall quality of the food seemed to have gone down. Things were pretty salty in general, and the amuse bouche of asparagus soup was incredibly salty. By the way, an espresso cup of mediocre soup seems to incredibly ungenorous and even lazy as far as an amuse bouche goes. The duck breast was cooked medium even though they say it's cooked medium rare. And it's swimming in a sickly sweet sauce. Why so much sweet sauce when you're already serving peaches on the side? It's overkill and not fine at all. The salmon trio app almost tasted like it had been refrigerated and had the  delicacy drained from it.  The nuage de noix for dessert was great.  The bottle of Sancerre was a good value but very unimpressive. Sorry to have to post this but also sorry to spend that much money on salty mediocrity.", "author": "Patrick D."}

The beautiful pink rose that sat between me and my dining partner definitely set the romantic mood. \n\nWe started out with Champagne by the glass (Ruelle-Pertois Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs, a very small winery, which I had never hear of that produces about 40,000 bottles or so annually).  My main course was the Prince Edward Mussels in white wine sauce and pommes frites.  My dining companion chose the Salmon with leeks, potatoes and red wine butter.  The mussels were delectable, but admittedly weren't as good as the mussels that I had enjoyed at a little seaside restaurant last year *sigh*, but, I devoured every single one of them.  My boyfriend's plate was CLEAN.  In fact, he used the wonderful, crusty French baguette to wipe every last trace of sauce from his plate.  For dessert, I enjoyed the profiteroles (very petite and hit the spot) and my boyfriend savored the warm chocolate cake.

A server brought out an amuse bouche to start, a demitasse of a cream of mushroom soup. Excellent. A very promising start to what was to be an exquisite meal.\n\nFor appetizers we shared the mesclun salad, which was deliciously dressed greens, pistachios, grapes and a piece of goat cheese that was fried with a lightly battered and crispy outside and smooth, melting creaminess on the inside. Each bite of salad was flavor heaven. We also shared the french onion soup gratinee. Unbelievable. One of the best onion soups I've ever had. \n\nWe also decided to try the seared foie gras. Not PC but I have been wanting to try this culinary delight for a long time. And delightful it was. It was seared on the outside and very soft and smooth on the inside. Extremely rich, served with a piece of toast soaked in a sweet sauce, a side of microgreens and thinly sliced apples. Sooo good!\n\nFor entrees I ordered the halibut, which was served with a saffron and celery root broth with fennel, fettucine and a piece of crispy toast with smoked salmon paste. My boyfriend ordered the sauteed monkfish, which was served with risotto in a lobster bisque. Both dishes were nothing short of sublime. We have not had fish that perfectly cooked in a long long time, so moist and delicate. Just amazing.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the apple tart with hazelnut ice cream and a dollop of caramel, and the vanilla bean creme brulee. The creme brulee was perfection, and the tart was excellent, especially with the ice cream, which was bursting with hazelnut flavor and so damn good. \n\nThe service was superb, attentive without being overbearing. The restaurant is very cozy with some tables that are very close together. We asked to be moved to a table by the window, which the server obliged, and we enjoyed our meal happily and comfortably. \n\nThe owner/executive chef, Philippe Gardelle, greets everyone when they arrive, and graciously thanks and says goodbye to everyone as they leave with a handshake for the men and a European double kiss for women. What top notch restaurant can you think of that provides that kind of genuine gratitude and service?

Nothing really special here. We got there just a few minutes before 6pm and we could order off of the early bird menu. Which was nice because basically, you get your dessert for free. And I really wanted dessert, too. mmm. Creme brulee. Sweet.\n\nWe started our meal (our third anniversary dinner, mind you... thank you. thank you.) with a small appetizer of kabocha squash soup. It was magnificently tasty and my husband can not stand gourds, so for him to like this soup, well, it must be magnificent. \n\nThen we had yellow corn soup. This was very good but we would have preferred the squash soup in a serving this size instead of espresso size. \n\nFor our main course I had a bowl of mussels (no, nothing else on the menu really appealed to me... but it was the early bird) and my husband had the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon. Doesn't that just sound yummy. Well, it was. But for some reason, hubby was not overly enthusiastic about it. I think the pile of mashed... yams?... with shredded ... cabbage?... threw him off. The mussels were just run of the mill. Nothing really outstanding.\n\nOur desserts were creme brulee (how did you guess?) and hubby had basil napoleon. That's fresh fruits with a basil sauce. That was surprisingly tasty. Creme brulee. YUM. Good thing I didn't have foie gras because I would have had to pass on the creme brulee (that's just too much heavy for one meal). \n\nThe wait staff. Nope. Nothing really special here. Didn't make me feel special or like I was at d'Angleterre in Nice, France again. \n\nNow, for the shocking news. Love love love Clementine. When we received our bill there were business cards en le chapeau with Chapeau! on one side, Clementine on the other. OH NO. What's that about? Chapeau! bought Clementine. So sad. I will miss the old Clementine. Time to find a new French restaurant.", "author": "Valerie V."}

The dinner went well until the waiter spilled the vase on the dinner table with all of its water (and contents) onto me.  The waiter apologized(?) or at least he looked sorry.

It was just business as usual for them.   \n\nI would never go back to this restaurant even though the food was great.

After reading all the rave reviews and waiting forever to get a reservation at a reasonable hour, we were seriously underwhelmed. For apps, our green salad arrived slightly wilted, and the artichoke soup's flavor was nice, but it was far too heavy. My tasting fish (monkfish) was fine but not spectacular. For mains, my scallops were good flavor-wise, but slightly gritty (not what you expect at $26 bucks for three scallops). My husband's pork was probably the best dish we had. Our desserts were disappointing. The chocolate cake tasted scorched and the apple tart was plain awful -- the apples were far too crunchy and the crust flavorless. The tart was served unpleasantly cold. Service was very slow -- we were in the restaurant for nearly 2 1/2 hours.\nThe next time we're craving French we'll go to L'Ardoise.

We had a group of 4 with a reservation at 5:30 pm on Father's Day (which is considered a holiday so no prix fixe menu). Three of us ordered the 3 course meal. It took 2 hours and 45 minutes for them to serve us our dinner, and it would have taken longer if we hadn't gotten fed up after waiting 30 minutes for our dessert and asked for it to be \"rushed\" out. Our water glasses were also refilled very infrequently. I am a very slow drinker of anything, so it is rare for me to be shaking the last few drops of water out of my glass. I understand that the restaurant was filled to capacity, but given that most people make reservations, they should have been properly staffed.\n\nI suppose if you are looking for a true French eating experience that takes an entire evening, then go right ahead and make your reservation for Chapeau.

They gave us tastings of the wines we ordered by the glass. I was unhappy with mine and, with no annoyance, the waiter quickly brought me the wine list again, and suggested a much better wine.\n\nThe filet was a perfect cut of meat, though the chef's idea of medium and medium rare is much rarer than mine. I suggest you order one step more done than you regularly do. The salad was a little sweet, needing some acid to balance it out.\n\nThe creme brulee was perfection. No gimmicky fruity flavors, which chefs often use to hide the low quality of their vanilla. This was perfectly creamy, with the right amount of candied sugar.\n\nWe left full, happy, and wanting to come back again.", "author": "Dave L."}

It is such an interesting combination of flavors - at first try I wasn't sure I liked it... but it really grew on me, and they recommended the perfect dessert wine to complement it, I forget which one.  \n\nPlus there is always Phillipe there to give you a handshake when you arrive and a kiss on the cheek when you leave...

Ok.\nMy friend: No a Grey Goose and tonic.\nWaiter: Grey Goose and extra olives?\nMy friend: No no, no olives.  Grey Goose and TONIC.\n\n15 minutes later and he \"had\" our drink orders.

What I got was an uncooked, chewy piece of meat.  It looked like they had taken a piece of meat, thrown it on the grill for a minute, and then plated it.  Knowing that it would take another hour if I sent it back I simply ate my prime rib sashimi.\n\nNow I know that French food is served a la slow, but this was ridiculous.

Having recently visited Paris, ah Paris!, we needed French cuisine. Our local expert for everything French, recommended that we try out Chapeau! in the Richmond district of San Francisco. As we munched potato-leek pancakes over mizuna, we delighted at the unexpected sweetness of caramelized apple. Each bite invited us to another bite and into a budding love of Chapeau! \n\nA bitter sorbet cleansed our palates--perhaps too bitter to want it to cleanse my plate again. The Cassoulet a la Toulousaine reminded me of the wonderful duck confit my friend Isabelle made for us when we visited her home in France. Mmmm. Warm, comforting country-style food. With a tad too much salt. For dessert, I took the predictably American path and went down the aisle of gushing chocolate cake. Who doesn't love chocolate cake? The rich sauce made me forget all my worries about the bitter sorbet and the tad too salty cassoulet. \n\nWe made our reservations well ahead of time for the very early hour of 5:30 PM. As the room filled with customers excited about their night out on the town, the room also filled with noise. Sitting against the wall in the back of the room caused me to feel as if my head was floating amidst all of the chatter. I had to ask Jill to annunciate a little more clearly as I had a hard time hearing her. Near the end of the meal, she wanted to switch spots so that she could sit on the cushion instead of the wood chair. Doing so freed me from the cacophony but immersed Jill in it. Sitting elsewhere may have improved matters dramatically. \n\nAs we finished the meal, the waiter remembered to call a cab for us without our even having to remind him. Before being whisked away to see Stevie Jay perform at the Yoga Loft, the bill came to us in a really cool hat. A chapeau, that is. The staff at Chapeau! treated us with special care. I'd like to think it was the festive hats we wore that night, but the staff at Chapeau! are probably always that good.", "author": "Joshua W."}

Our waiter Yannick (He was simply awesome!) asked, \"are you very hungry?\" so I gestured and said so-so. Then he recommended the lamb. As he was gathering up the menu, he asked if we wanted the palate cleansing sorbet with calvados before the main course, we hesitated a bit but said why not. He smiled and said \"It's nice. You will thank me later.\" ---he was right. The sorbet was so nice that I asked it to be placed on a trio of sorbet plate for dessert in stead of one of the 3. But Yannick was sweet enough to get it added. I never like sorbet! But all 4 of them were so flavorful and refreshing--perfect before lamb, which was also superb... We also ordered tart grand-mere and banana panna cotta. The tart was sensational!! I cannot possibly write all about our dinner since I don't want the readers to keep on scrolling down endlessly, but believe me, the food and service here is excellent.

The tables are very close together.  So, it's difficult to have a private conversation unless the table next to you is empty, which it was for part of the time we were there.  Service is very attentive and responsive to requests.  My sister and I were sharing cocktails when they started the food service.  I asked the waiter to wait until we finished our cocktails before starting the meal and they complied w/o complaint.\n\nThey offer a very reasonable $28 3-course \"early bird special'(530-6pm) and a couple of do-it-yourself 3-4 course prix fixe offerings.  The menu is not that extensive, so the early bird is really the better deal.  The meal started w/an amuse buse  -- a califlower soup.  My sister and I chose different early bird specials, but shared a very nice faux gras appetizer to statt, which wasn't cheap at $18, but was a very nicely cooked piece of natual foie gras served on a bed of something (not sure what) along w/sliced apples and a maple syrup type sauce.  Very original.  For the early bird, I had the escargot appetizer (prepared traditionally w/garlic, parlsey & butter sauce) and 2 small roasted chickens.  My sister had a mesclun salad and musssels for the entre. We both ate the Basil Napolean for desert - a mixture of finely minced fruit (Maui Pineapple, Manilla Mango, Banana, Kiwi & Strawberries) with a champagne/cream sauce.  Everything was very well prepared and we topped if off w/a bottle of Patz & Hall pinot which was also very good.  I was not familiar w/most of the California and French wines offered.  We tired a sip of the by-the-glass pinot with the thought of buying a bottle for $40, but it was underwhelming.  So, chose the Patz & Hall, which was the only wine I was familiar w/for $70 instead.  It was a good choice. \n\nWe had a very long conversation over dinner and wine and were not rushed out, which made sense since there were many empty tables after around 7pm.  However, people seem attracted by the \"early bird special\" because the place was unusually busy the first hour or so (we arrived at 530) while we were there.  So, if you're planning to take advantage of the \"early bird\" special, you should plan to actually get there early.  My sister and I enjoyed ourselves and I definitely plan to go back soon.", "author": "Martin C."}

We'll probably have to wait another year to come back because we're poor college students.\n\nFood: My boyfriend praised the complimentary fish with potato salad on a spoon, he said he didn't want to swallow it because it tasted so damn good. I don't eat shellfish, so I decided to stay away from seafood in general. I'm like an opposite pescetarian. The waiter asked me why I didn't eat it and I told him, he was very nice and got me a slice of baguette with tomato sauce on it, which was wonderful. On to appetizers, I had the onion soup. It was alright, I guess since I love my mother's onion soup, it's hard to match it. I found it was a bit dull, it had no bang to the initial mouthful. Then my entree was the Cassoulet de Toulouse, it was nice, very filling. The lamb was cooked perfectly. It was still moist and kept it's flavor. But I enjoyed my boyfriend's filet mignon much more, he had it with the Sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine, and it was just indescribably good. Then for dessert I had the Banana Panna Cotta/ Strawberry Salad/ Shortbread. I think that the shortbread could of been either smaller or thinner. This reminded me of strawberry shortcake. It was wonderful none the less. I could taste the strawberry more than the banana panna cotta. Just reviewing it now, reminded me it was banana rather than strawberry panna cotta. \n\nAtmosphere: My boyfriend and I came in semiformal. Sadly there was no dress code, yes, I wished there were a loose dress code. It boosts the atmosphere. Since this seems like a very nice place. There were people coming in, in sweats and t shirts. It was very cramped in the restaurant. You would imagine a place would have quiet conversations where everyone seems to be whispering. But not this place, everyone is so close it turns into a loud hum, just below a Chinese restaurant.\n\nService: The waiter was very nice and very personable. He had quite a thick French accent so when he was telling us the specials it was sort of hard to hear. No problems though, he was nice enough to tell us what we miss with out being irked about it. He also offered to take my coat to the coat room and at the end he held it out for me to put it back on. I'm not use to this service so I felt very awkward. He was really good with recommendations. The chef also came out and greeted everyone, shook everyone's hand and initiated conversations. He reminded me of the chef in a queen latifah movie...Last Holiday. At the end of the meal my boyfriend and I stepped out the door and the chef came out just to say goodbye to us. He shook my hand, kissed each of my cheek then shook my boyfriends hand and said hope to see you soon! For sure it's a place I would like to go back to, just when I have a bit more money.", "author": "Kimberly S."}

What took me so long!\n\nMy family took my mother here for her birthday, and it was just exquisite.  We were lucky to get the window seating, where we had more room and it didn't seem to be as loud.  The food was just as good as what you'd find at your typical Michael Mina kind of a place, without all of the pretension.\n\nThe chef is very adamant about getting to meet his diners, which is quite refreshing really.  It really gives the place a home-town feel.  He's also well versed in wines, which I am most definitely not.

Having experienced many stellar meals at Clementine, we had very high expectations for this important celebration.  The service was superb but we were both quite disappointed in much of the food.  My partner loved the deep fried tiger prawns but I was very disappointed in my porcini encrusted sweetbreads which were very firm, almost hard contrasted to my expected soft and delicate texture.\n\nWe both had the cassoulet and we were both quite disappointed.  The saltiness of the dish was overpowering, the beans much more firm than I expected.  I could hardly taste the lamb nor the sausage because of the overpowering salt.  We both left most of the dish un-eaten.\n\nThe chocolate cake with rum-raisin ice cream was the high point of the eveniing.  My french toast was just that--a little piece of bread in a puddle of non-descript tan sauce with some hazelnut ice cream on top.\n\nWhen we left, no one asked us about the meal. The woman at the door was busy talking with someone but did turn and say \"good night\".\n\nI blame us partially for our disappointment.  The cassoulet was obviously a poor choice.  I would have thought the wait staff would have noted that much of it remained in the dish.\n\nAfter dropping $190.00 and driving home disappointed we passed the informal little Indian cafe called Kasa where we have enjoyed many a meal.  We realized that we would have been much better satisfied had we chosen to return there.", "author": "William A."}

Everything was excellent and it was a real pleasure to meet the Executive Chef.  We went with another couple and everyone ordered something different for the appetizers, entrees and desserts so we could all try something different.  Two of us chose the 3-Course Menu, one chose the 4-Course Menu with the Tasting Fish, and one chose the 4-Course Menu with the Trou Normand (Green Apple Sorbet, which was very refreshing).\n\nWe loved all the appetizers we ordered: foie gras (special of the day), Trio of Salmon (the lemon juice in the dish made it very refreshing), Traditional Escargot de Bourgogne, and Salade Landaise.  The Salade Landaise had half a piece of foie gras on it, too even though it was not included on the list of ingredients!\n\nThe Tasting Fish was the Scallop over Pesto Risotto with a lobster sauce.  I'm allergic to shellfish and crustaceans, so I couldn't try it, but I was assured that it was absolutely delicious and that the scallop was cooked perfectly.\n\nOf the entrees we had (Bouillabaisse, Cassoulet de Toulouse, Lavender Honey & Dijon Glazed Petit Poussin, and the special of the day - Skate), the Skate was the best.  I don't know what they put in the seasonings, but the skate was delicious, moist, and cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nWow, the desserts were delicious!  We had the Trio of Sorbet (a refreshing cranberry, lime, and passion fruit), Tahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and Basil Napoleon, Warm Chocolate Cake.  The Basil Napoleon was a real surprise.  It looked rather plain, but once you started digging in there were lots of different flavors that surprisingly went very well together.  I absolutely recommend it.  The Warm Chocolate Cake had a side of Rum-Raisin Ice Cream that was also yummy.  I think I liked it more than the cake! LOL  With the Trio of Sorbet, the cranberry kind of tasted like grape or raspberry, the lime kind of tasted like grapefruit, and the passion fruit tasted a bit like mango.  We were only able to guess the flavor of the passion fruit correctly, but they all tasted wonderful!\n\nThe service and the atmosphere were excellent.

We received a complimentary starter of cauliflower soup with truffle flavor - very good, clean taste.  For the appetizer, I got the Trio of Salmon (gravlax, tartar, caviar) - interesting, though too salty.  For the price, was surprised that the smoked salmon was chewy vs. tender.  For the entree, I got the day boat scallops in lobster sauce (daily special).  Scallops were underdone so the interior was still cold - I'm sure this was on purpose, but would have preferred a higher degree of doneness; however, lobster sauce was good.  \n\nFor wine, we got a very good 2005 Pinot Grigio, Amethyst, Reserve, Los Carneros for $38.\n\nDessert was shared among the entire group.  Vanilla bean creme brulee was disappointing - cold in the interior like most places without even the saving grace of a crispy top.  Basil Napoleon was an interesting combination, but the flavors didn't quite work together.  Floating Island was a piece of art with a delicate weave of hardened sugar curving over the plate.  At the end of the day, the real winner (surprisingly) was the very honest French Toast - not fancy, but just done well and seared to just the right degree of brownness.\n\nOverall assessment: If you're after combinations of ingredients that aim more for uniqueness than for taste, then this is your place.  Besides the Cauliflower Soup and French Toast, everything else was just ... interesting ... a good thought experiment, but nothing I'd want to have again.\n\nParking is terrible, so come early and be ready to circle.", "author": "Ana L."}

I've lived close to this neighborhood for 17 years and never noticed this place.\n\nThe staff was very attentive right from the moment you pass through the entrance adorned with a heavy black curtain which makes the place feel more exclusive. Inside, the walls are a cute country scene painted in pastels, one can't help but admire this artwork.\n\nI was expecting only to order dessert; however, my friend decided to go for the three course prix fixe dinner instead so I said \"why not\" and did the same. I'm glad I did, because I would have miss out on a spectacular meal.  For the appetizer I had the Jumbo Tiger Prawns which was absolutely delicious, lightly fried with a wasabi sauce. My main course was a huge veal medallion wrapped in beacon with I believe was a lentil puree. Dessert was the hot chocolate cake.

The little tiny cup of cauliflower soup is always a great way to start the meal. The price went up a little, as the prefix menu 1 is now $38 for 3 courses, but still well worth it.\n\nI don't think that the service is slow but the couple at the table next to us were feeling impatient about their food. You can hear everything that the table next to you is saying. The restaurant is small and comfy, although some may be displeased with the crampedness, I think it's kind of interesting. So I guess my advice is, don't come here if you have tickets for something or plans for afterwards. Our dinner took an hour and a half. I didn't even notice, but what do you expect when they have to cook three courses for you?\n\nMy honey-roasted guinea fowl was a bit more filling than I thought it would be, but of course I found room to give to my long-awaited creme brulee. My first course was some sort of asparagus soup thing with...flan. I think. It was good. Not great, I like the little tiny cup-thing of cauliflower soup better but, it was still good.\n\nMy date LOVED his duck salad, I kind of heard about it for the rest of the night. He also loved his pork. It was pretty tasty from the one bite I tried. And of course, he got his very own creme brulee. Sharing creme brulee was out of the question for us.\n\nUnfortunately, no owner chasing us down to give a handshake and a kiss. It was kind of silly but I was looking back as we walked out wondering why I hadn't seen him all night. It turns out that since he bought out Clementine he's been there doing his thing and his wife's been managing Chapeau.

The review only focuses on the negative.  I am sorry she didn't manage to enjoy herself.  I was part of this dinner party and loved it.  It was my birthday party.  They greeted me warmly, gave us an amouz-bouche, gave me free desert and sang.  The food was excellent.  Everyone in the party shared (as you must) and pretty much enjoyed everything.  The Skate Wing is excellent.  Note the food is very rich and can pack a punch if you aren't used to it (sorry \"Emilie B\"). \n\nThey did charge us for an extra capuccino, but gave a $150 dollar gift certificate upon Emilie B complaining.  That is what I call a heck of a refund.\n\nWe showed up with a party of 6 despite a reservation for 4 and they took care of us within 15 minutes after the full party arrived late.  \n\nThe place is small and tables are tight and you do have french speed service.

We were seated promptly and asked for our cocktail order.  Our cocktails came quickly and we were allowed to enjoy them for a while until our menus arrived.  I really appreciated that we weren't rushed!  The waiter gave us good guidance in our food/wine selections.  Normally waiters won't say what they really think, but my husband was thinking of ordering one thing, and he was like, \" No, you should really order this.\" (in a nice way, and I agreed, but I didn't want to be a shrew and tell the hubby what to order, so I was grateful for this!)\n\nI had the sweetbreads - and they were excellent.  They were creamy in the center, succulent and not overcooked (I had my fair share of overdone sweetbreads in Argentina).  The boy had the salmon trio.  I looked at other people's appetizers and it seemed like the two we chose were some of the best on the menu.   The only other thing that looked appealing to me was the warm brie.  Maybe I'll try that next time.\n\nOh yeah - and can I say the bread?  The. BREAD. was. amazing!  The most wonderful thing EVER.  A perfect crust that shattered in my mouth and a wonderful, indescribable flavor.  This is what real French bread must taste like.  I never knew.  \n\nI think I would choose this place over Gary Danko... Still great food, easier to get a reservation, less expensive, and less risk involved (because if you order the wrong thing, you can always come back!)  \n\nFor the entree I had the skate and the hubs had the flounder.  Both were very good.  I think with this restaurant it's more interesting to stay with the less traditional items on the menu.  The filet mignon, cassoulet, foie gras, etc all looked very good, but not very ground breaking. The desserts were good as well.  Again the waiter recommended the French toast over the creme brulee (cb is boring!).  Do this.  Do it, I tell you!\n\nThe only reason I would downgrade this resto a bit is the decor.  The tables are RIGHT next to each other and the decor is bland.  It is very beige in there and it feels like it is missing something.  Also the bathrooms was sloppily done - they chose a tile to match the existing tile, but it didn't match very well.  Makes me wonder a bit what they do in the kitchen...

We were a bit early for our reservation but were seated in minutes. The head chef and owner greets you when you walk in which is pretty nice. Once seated, we shared a nice french wine and our appetizers. We had the foie gras which was delicious and a pair of oysters. It was fun to try this stuff since my friend doesn't usually venture towards these options. For our entrees, she got the chicken, I got the Pork. Both were tasty but the dessert was by far, the best ending we could've asked for. GET THE FRENCH TOAST. You won't be disappointed. When we asked the waiter what to get, the chocolate cake (ordered by the table next to us earlier) or the french toast he said the french toast without any hesitation.

But, I was disappointed by both the layout of the restaurant and the food.  \n\nI wish I had known that the tables are set up to be just a couple of inches apart.  The place was packed on a weeknight, so I guess they just want to jam pack as many people as they can accomodate, but it really killed the ambiance.  At a pricey place like Chapeau, I expect to be able to have a private conversation as I eat my dinner.\n\nThe food, on average, was good but not remarkable.  Here is what I ordered:\n\n- Trio of salmon:  Very good.  Loved the flavor and the presentation.\n\n-  Filet mignon with Pommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms, Sauce \u00e0 la P\u00e9rigourdine :  Excellent.

One thing that impressed me was the busser actually knew about the wines on the wine list, and suggested one for the lady, and it was pretty good. \n\nThe food was very good, although there were a couple misses, the biggest being the escargot, all I could taste was parsley and garlic, very strong flavor, I didn't like starting the meal that way (I wouldn't have ordered it, I figured I should let the broad pick the apps, being her day and all). She ordered, I forget what it was called but it was GOOD, it had chever\u00e9, and a tomato and polenta.\n\nShe went with the 4 course with the tasting fish, for her that was the dish of the evening (almost). It was a scallop and stuff, it was very satisfying, I don't recall the flavors too much, I was too busy watching her enjoy it.\n\nMains:, I got the Pettite Poussin, very good, sauce was great, I had to pick it up and gnaw on the bone a little, until she gave me that look, you know the one. I would have been extremely satisfied with this, then I tried the Bouillabaisse, WOW, just WOW, for me that was the dish of the evening, almost.\n\nDessert, she got the chocolate cake, which was very good, but it paled in comparison to the french toast. THIS was the dish of the evening, a dessert you say. Yes, say I. If you go here, GET IT. Don't share it, get your own. If your date does the whole \"Oh lets just share\" thing, give them a look like they just kicked your little puppy dog across the room and call them cold hearted.

My dinner companion's main course along with my Lamb dish was just ok not earthshatttering as some of the reviews I have read on here have intimated. I even added salt which didn't help (and I rarely ever do that). I am not sure why all the high marks, and there's no way this is even close to Grand Cafe or Gary Denko as someone said in their review. Sorry.

Almost everything about my experience here was perfect, with the exception of one glaring oversight on the part of the server at the beginning of the evening. \n\nWe were seated right away with a Sunday night dinner reservation at 8pm. The owner came by to introduce himself and personally welcome us, which was a nice touch. We were brought water and menus. And then we waited. And waited. And waited some more... We waited approximately 20 minutes for someone to bring bread, take a drink order, or take some sort of notice of our presence at all. Finally, our server came over, and abruptly asked if we were ready to order. \n\nThere was no explanation of the menu, or the specials for the evening. I was particularly looking forward to trying the foie gras, which is not on the menu. Luckily, I had overheard him explain the foie gras to someone at a neighboring table, and asked about it. Still, no explanation of the menu or specials was forthcoming. He briefly explained the preparation to me (seared). He seemed completely rushed, and even somewhat bothered by being asked a question and having to take my order. Luckily, I had spent the prior 20 minutes studying the menu, so I knew exactly what I wanted to order by the time he finally deigned to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAfter the disastrous first 20 minutes, I was fully prepared for the rest of the evening to continue in the same fashion. Instead, I was delightfully surprised. Not only was the food delicious, the service for the rest of the evening was exceptional. Same server, but huge difference in service. I don't know what happened, but after the initial lapse, he did a complete 180 and was very attentive and courteous. \n\nHe had:\nDeep Fried Black Tiger Prawns with Shredded Phylo Dough/Tomate & Onion Marmelade/Petits Legumes/Herbed Aioli - Very good. The prawns were perfectly cooked, and the flavor was nice and light. The phylo dough added nice texture, and the marmelade balanced out the flavors nicely.\nBacon Wrapped Natural Pork Tenderloin/Parsnip Puree/Braised Green Swiss Chard/Apple-Calvados Sauce - You can't go wrong with anything wrapped in bacon, right?\nTahitienne Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - Surprisingly large. Yum. \n\nI had:\nSeared Foie Gras - melt in your mouth deliciousness! I would go back here, repeatedly, just for this dish. Even the friend who dislikes foie gras and is repulsed by the general concept of fatty duck liver enjoyed this immensely.\nRoasted Rack of Lamb/Ratatouille/Potato Gratin -This plate is huge! It was too much food for me to finish, but I definitely enjoyed making the attempt. The lamb was moist and tender, very flavorful, a perfect medium rare. The potato gratin was very nice, as was the ratatouille. \nWarm Chocolate Cake/Banana Flamb\u00e9e/ Rum & Banana Ice Cream/Caramel Sauce - Rich, chocolately, divine. The warm, gooey chocolate center is my favorite part. \n\nAmuse Bouche (Smoked Trout/Potato Salad) -  a tasty snack\nFish Tasting (Seared Scallop/Tomato Confit/Pesto Risotto/Fish & Lobster Reduction) - The scallop was so sweet and delicious, perfect with the fish and lobster reduction, it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.\nPalate Cleanser (Colonel: Lemon-Ginger Sorbet/ Citrus Infused Vodka) - The sorbet is light and refreshing, and the vodka gives an unexpected punch of flavor\n\nWe had a bottle of the wine recommended by our server, a merlot (actually a blend) that complemented the rest of the meal very nicely.\n\nI definitely plan to go back again. The food is an excellent value for the price, and I'm very impressed that they were able to change my impression of the place after the frustrating beginning to the evening.", "author": "Erin Y."}

If the owner, who actually cooks and makes the menu himself, can acknowledge his customers, you can actually feel the passion and his love for cooking when you taste the food. I had the salmon trio for the first course which was absolutely delightful, followed by a pesto risotto in lobster bisque sauce which was probably the best risotto I've tasted (mind you, pesto is one of my favorite things on this planet), then the duck breast cooked to a tee, and then ended it with French toast on soft caramel and hazelnut ice cream. I could not be more ecstatic about my first French restaurant here in SF. Parking was not a problem for us, though it could be if you go at around dinner time.

But the decor is the last thing on your  mind when you taste the decadent cuisine served as this charming bistro. I would say go with the duck, cooked medium rare- definitely the best duck I've ever had, very tender. Not to be repetitive, but the creme brulee is the tastiest I've ever had as well! I like how it's a little cramped and loud, it makes for a lovely, fun atmosphere.  Watch out, this place is so incredible, you will lose track of time.

Can't even tell its there until you go inside the big thick curtain at the front door. Service is very good and the food is EXCEPTIONAL. On top of that there is free parking on nearby streets and its right in my neighborhood in the Richmond district. Hard to find a restaurant like this in the middle of nowhere.\n\nIts right up there with the expensive french restaurants in downtown but minus the size, parking problems, and ambiance. It is cozy and comfortable.\n\nPrices are very reasonable for a restaurant of this class. You can expect about $40-60 per person without wine. I believe they even have a Pri Fixe (excuse my speeling) early bird 3 course for under $30 if you go sometime between 5pm and 6pm (better ask them to be sure).\n\nPhilippe the owner is always warm and welcoming and always greets us when arriving. Sometimes he won't get to you when you are leaving because he is very busy but once we have been chased down the street to thank us for going. A very nice and charming owner that I am happy to give my business to.\n\nCasual clothing is totally OK at any of Philippe's restaurants (including Clementine on ~3rd and Clement). Their only rule is no cell phone use inside the restaurants.\n\nReservations are recommended at least early on in the evening that you plan to go to be sure to get a seat.", "author": "Ken S."}

Chapeau! was the place that inspired me to create an account and write my first review. I came here tonight with my boyfriend to have a nice meal and celebrate an accomplishment at work. From beginning to end, the experience warrants 5 stars. I called from the office to reserve a table. The friendly hostess let me know that they did not have any openings at 5:30 PM (we wanted to check out the Early Bird prix fix menu) but that we could sit at one of the tall bar tables - which she recommended to me as a quiet, nestled placement in the restaurant where you can enjoy your date. 1 star for that! We were seated within seconds of walking in and had the pleasure of being greeted by one of the best waiters/bartenders I have EVER come across in any of my dining experiences. Another star for that! The staff was informative, friendly, on top of every possible detail and the chef came out to introduce himself and shake our hand! I've never felt more welcome in a restaurant. A third star for that! We decided to go with the Early Bird prix fix and started off with the soup with crab cake and salmon appetizer. Next, we devoured the Salmon with corn and arugula and the Chicken with veal, potatoes, garlic, spinach, and onion. For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee and the french toast with hazelnut ice cream (both by far the best desserts i've had, anywhere)! A fourth star for that! We also enjoyed the French Chardonnay (recommended by our bartender, and delicious) and the Pinot Noir. There is no doubt in my mind that we will be returning to Chapeau! for many dates in the future. Thank you for a wonderful evening and for the inspiration to start reviewing on Yelp! Of course, a 5th star for that :)", "author": "Hillary P."}

We chose this resto b/c of the 4.5 star yelp rating. We had an early reservation b/c we thought we were going to take advantage of their Early Bird menu (3 courses for $28), but after hearing their specials (which weren't available on that menu), we opted for the regular menu (which we didn't mind doing). \n\nHighlight: Head chef came out to welcome us and bid us farewell\n\nLowlight: Very fast pace w/delivery of courses, which resulted in slight indigestion Our reservation was at 5:30; we got there at 5:25. We ordered a three course meal and were done with dessert by 6:23. \n\n\nFACTS\n-         Our reservation was at 5:30; we got there at 5:25. We ordered a three course meal and were done with dessert by 6:23. (I said this already, but had to repeat it b/c it was a real turn-off.)\n-         As soon as we finished one course and put our fork down, a waiter would swoop it away. 2-3 minutes later, the next course would come out. \n-         Main waiter presented us with menu, specials, and took or order. He checked in on us once ruing our main course, but didn't see him again until he presented us with the bill, which someone else took care for him. \n-         My husband ordered the escargot, rack of lamb, and cr\u00e8me brulee. \n-         I ordered the foie gras and roasted duck breast\n\nOPINIONS\n-         For a French restaurant that serves multiple course meals, our expectation was that the pacing would be slower, allowing us to digest and enjoy each course. The courses came out so quickly that we really were wondering if the food was pre-made! \n-         The waiter was cordial, but expected that he would have checked on us at least one other time. Also felt that he should have poured more wine when he saw our glasses were empty. (No, we're not high maintenance--this is what we've grown accustomed to at other, comparably-priced restaurants. \n-         The escargot was soaked in butter/herb sauce--this is traditional, but seemed extra rich, for some reason; the rack of lamb was cooked appropriately, but my husband did have to add a dash of salt; and cr\u00e8me brulee was very good. \n-         The foie gras was good and portion size was what you'd expect, but the reduction it came with was a tad to sweet for me--almost like a caramel sauce rather than a reduction; the roasted duck breast, accompanied by polenta and grapes, was good, but the polenta was bland. No real complaints other than wishing the skin was more browned--and aesthetically, it wasn't at all appealing or pretty because there wasn't a lot of color on the plate (no green or red, only browns).\n-         Also agree w/the other Yelper that the resto is very \"old world French;\"  so if that's what you like, then you may enjoy it here.\n\n\nOverall, we walked out disappointed and very perplexed as to why the resto is rated so highly by other Yelpers.", "author": "Ali A."}

I have dined there numerous times and the food is magnificent and the service is friendly and attentive. If the review was based on the quality of the food alone, I would happily give Chapeau! ten stars but it isn't and I can't. Last Thursday evening I took out-of-town guests there; we were a party of four. As always, Chef Philippe greeted us. Our table was not ready (to give them credit, we showed up 20 minutes early) so we sat at the bar. We tried...mind you...TRIED to get cocktails but the bartender apparently felt he had more pressing matters to attend to than waiting on customers. We sat and watched as he washed glasses, had a chat with some folks at the other end of the bar, took an unexplained journey into the kitchen and finally - finally!! - asked what we would like to drink. By then our table was ready and our drinks were sent over. I was glad of this because it spared me having to explain why I was leaving him no tip. If you're reading this, Monsieur Bartender, your attitude needs a distinct stepping-up. There are plenty of people whom I'm quite sure would be more than happy to have your job if you find it such a trial to perform your duties.\n\nOkay. So. Now we're at the table. Nice table and not too close to the other tables as is the case in parts of this restaurant. I cannot say enough as to how good the food was. Each of us ordered something different and we were all delighted with our dinners. We were not, however, pleased in the slightest with our service. Our waiter was haughty and forgetful and we actually did better just bypassing him and asking the busboy for whatever we needed. BTW...my partner and I are sympathetic to people who rely on tips as we have both worked in service-related jobs in the past. Since 20% is now considered the new 15% we always leave at least a 20% tip.  Our waiter received a straight 15% and I frankly feel that was about 10% too generous.\n\nChef Philippe came out during our dinner to do a walk-through of the room and I told him I was not very happy with the sloppy service. He explained that one of the waiters (whom we knew from previous visits and was a very nice man) had recently passed away. I was certainly sorry to hear it but it had been at least a week since the gentleman had passed away and one would certainly think if one is going to charge top dollar for food there should be sufficient staff on hand to enhance the experience.\n\nSorry, Chapeau! - I think Thursday was my last visit. When I shell out nearly 500 bucks for dinner I expect a modicum of service, not slipshod service and attitude.", "author": "Owen H."}

I started with the escargot, had the mussels for my entree, and the creme brulee for dessert. The escargot sauce was delicious, super garlicky just the way I like it. The meat itself was tender and tasted like soft chicken. The mussels were served in huge generous portions and were tasty, but the entree that blew all of ours (duck breast, flounder, and my mussels) out of the water was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. That meat was delectable; the flavor was totally locked in and the cut was so tender.  I wish I had ordered it! For dessert we tried the profiteroles, the creme brulee, and one other one that I can't quite remember right now.

All in all, I had a really great experience here when I came to dine with my father's best friend from out of town.\n\nThough the neighborhood was so-so, it was very nice to find a gem like this in such an inconspicuous location.  Once we beat our way through the heavy black curtain at the door, we didn't quite realize that we had smashed our way into a den of gastronomical excellence.\n\nThe truly beautiful thing about this place is its simplicity.  The decor is elegant, not pretentious.  The servers were polite, knowledgeable, and generally quite receptive to the nonverbal \"vibes\" we went them -- they seemed to just KNOW when my water needed to be refilled, when my wine glass needed replenishing, and they even noticed when my napkin fell to the floor and brought me a new one right away.\n\nThe food was excellent.  My dining partner and I each had the same thing: a beautiful amuse bouche of a cold cucumber and corn soup, perfectly prepared foie gras appetizer, and prime rib \"for two\" carved table-side.  The foie gras was tasty, and the prime rib was flavorful, tender, and well seasoned over all.  My sorbets after dinner were excellent, tart (I had pear, pineapple, and a flavor I can't remember).  The food was even better than I had expected, which says a lot given the hype I have heard via newspapers, zagat, and word of mouth.\n\nNow, there is a reason I didn't give this place a perfect rating.  It was just a little bit slow.  The service was precise, thoughtful and crisp, but the pace of the meal was a just a tad \"French\" to me -- meaning, once we were seated, it took a few minutes for anyone to come take our order for cocktails and a bottle of wine.  Once we made our order for a bottle of wine, we \"muscled\" into ordering something else.\n\nAll in all, this was a great place to eat.  I will certainly return in the near future.

It wasn't anything special, but at least they didn't over cook it. I would have given it 2 stars but the dessert was HORRIBLE i had the chocolate cake which was way overcooked and that in combination with using way too much coffee to \"enhance\" the chocolate resulted in a burnt flavor. The caramel also was very burnt tasting (not good intentional burnt orange or anything either).

This place is so subdued, for lack of a better word, from the outside that I would never have found this place without Yelp and all the positively glowing reviews on it. And here I am, writing one of my own! I had pretty high expectations walking in because of the high rating here, but I was still pleasantly surprised. \n\nAs we walked inside, my first impression of the dining room is that it was neat and unassuming, with colors in soothing neutral tones.  It's not fancy, but it's not supposed to be---it's a bistro! It's a small space, packed fairly tightly with tables. Philippe, the owner / chef, greeted my friend and me as we came in, shaking our hands and welcoming us, which was a pleasant indication of the quality of service, I thought. \n\nHaving arrived just before 6pm, we were able to order from the early bird 3 course.  We were surprised by the number of things to choose from (4 choices each for appetizers, entrees, and desserts) for a \"cheapo\" ($25) early meal.  We were treated to a complimentary chilled melon soup. It was very refreshing... a little minty and had a bit of a gingery kick. For our appetizer, we both ordered the brie thing... it's basically a blob of melted brie on top of a potato hash thing, on top of some apples and greens, and a raspberry(?) sauce. A food writer I will never be, so sorry for my lack of... articulation. Anyway, that thing was FANTASTIC and definitely our favorite course of the evening. Next, I had the duck breast over polenta and my friend had mussels with a side of [very yummy crispy crunchy] fries, which were both very good entrees in their own right, but the brie blobby thing was a tough act to follow! For dessert, I had the creme brulee, which was very good, but I really haven't met a creme brulee I didn't like, and it is hard to mess up. My friend had the basil napolean. I had a small taste and it was a very interesting combination of flavors. Basically, it looked like four very thin wafers arranged on top of a sweet basil sauce with chopped of bits of fruit. There was also a thicker, yellowy-orange colored sauce in the middle but I didn't try any of that.\n\nThe food was excellent and creatively prepared as far as I can tell, though I admit that I am not extremely knowledgable about french food. The service was also excellent: prompt and attentive, with none of the snobbery I expected from a French place. The bill came in a hat, which I thought was weird and admittedly cute, since chapeau also means hat.\n\nAfter the lovely dinner, we made it out the door before Philippe chased us down, called us mademoiselles (heehee), and thanked us for coming!

Anyway, can't say I've been chased down outside of a restaurant by an owner to be thanked before. Such a simple gesture, but it made us feel like a million bucks.\n\nI can't remember the last time I've been so satisfied with a dining experience or treated with such genuine warmth.

I was little confused over the location of the restaurant, and the decor, because I was personally not impressed, but once I tasted the food my tune started to change. When we arrive at Chapeau for dinner, the restaurant was almost completely full, and it was relatively early. We had a reservation, so i was a little disappointed with our extremely small table, and the close proximity of the tables to our left and right. It made the experience feel forced, rushed, and non-special. Unfortunately, this was a rough start to the night, but we told the hostess we'd like to wait for a more secluded table. Once we were sat somewhere more reasonable, I was able to concentrate on my amazing meal. This was the first time I'd ever tried Sweet Breads, and Foie Gras, and both were amazing, and the presentation was excellent. I could see why this place is so popular. It would be nice to feel less crammed for a return visit.", "author": "Melody H."}

The experience was wonderful; elegant without being stuffy, welcoming but not hovering.  Reminiscent of a small french restaurant in Seattle where the chef is similarly interested in giving the impression he is personally having you over for dinner only the food in Chapeau is significantly better.\n\nApparently I started this review 6 months ago and promptly forgot about it.  What I do remember is the filet mignon with foie gras that was meltingly amazing.  Went with the Prix Fixed so it had to add a few dollars for that particular entr\u00e9e, well worth it.  I don't recall the specifics of the rest of the food other than we thoroughly enjoyed the meal, the wine was great and we had a really good time.  Now why didn't I give it a 5, it's a tad crowded.

I'd been wanting to try this place out for two years or more and finally made it on a Saturday for dinner. \n\nFirst let me say the food is a solid four stars. Very good but not mind blowing awesome. Service was good, but you can really  tell who's a regular there because they are much friendlier and pay more attention to their meals. I guess if I was a regular I would love that. But I was not.\n\nTwo of us had the prime rib special which was $80 for two. The meat was melt in your mouth outstanding. It was enough for us, but if you are used to the super large portions at some steak houses you will be disappointed.\n\nThe other main course was the skatewing. It was good, but I have had much better fish dishes at a number of places.\n\nAppetizer was the salmon.Very fresh. Dessert was a hazlenut mousse thing. {I think} It was light and fluffy, but another dish that was just good, not knock your socks off great.\n\nWe had three glasses of wine, two lychee {sp?} martinis, three entrees, one appetizer and one dessert. The total with tax and tip was $240. For my money I want fabulous food for that amount. Oh, also the head waiter/wine guy was a little snotty. I've had friendlier wait staff in Paris.\n\nAll in all if  spending that amount of money was something I did all of the time I would come back...but I don't so I am on to the next must eat at restaurant on my list.", "author": "Nancy C."}

We were both exited to go as we had been to Clementine last year which we enjoyed tremendously, which is apparently owned by the same person as Chapeau.\nAnyhow, the hosts and service staff were very polite and attentive and did their job well.  However, from what I could tell, all of the service staff were either Asian or Latino.  That was the first bummer, we were all set to try out our french and there was no one to converse with.  \n\nThe meal was paced well and we were allowed to take our time and we really appreciated this.  This was starting to feel a little more French.\nA real downer was the staffs lack of knowledge of french wines.   In my opinion French wines are like mysteries that need to be explained to truly appreciate each unique bottle.  We were advised by a very well intentioned Asian gentleman to try a Grand Cru from the  Bordeaux region.  We were told it was very \"smooth\", which I kinda chuckled when I heard that.  Anyhow, I asked what grapes comprised the wine and he was not able to tell me.  When I pressed him on it he said Cabernet.  Any of you wine buffs out there know that French wines are mostly blends, that is part of their craft and pride.  He just didn't know what he was talking about and did not bother to find out for me.   I was thinking, IS THIS REALLY A FRENCH RESTAURANT?  That bummed me out.\n\nNow to the food, I enjoyed the appetizers, the blini with caviar and salmon in pastry was very nice, they both featured the fish very well and did not overpower the intent.  The oyster was good but I would have expected it in a restaurant know for Ceviche more than French food. \nOn to the pancetta wrapped fish on risotto, this was good but not great. \nAfter the fish, they served us a filet mignon with truffle butter, asparagus and mashed parsnip.  This pairing was excellent and in my opinion a perfectly balanced classic french entree, very nicely done.\nDessert must have been uneventful as I cannot recall what we had.\n\nSo this is my take, If your going to ask $350 for a French meal for two, I would expect that all of the elements come together perfectly.  Knowledgeable French staff, excellent French wine with  someone who knows and understands French wine, Slow French Pace to let us enjoy our meal  and of course delicious French Food.  I would have been down to say this meal should have fetched about $150 bones at best.\n\n So I am giving Chapeau 3 stars, wish it were better, but these guys need to bring the \"French\" back into their French Restaurant.", "author": "BRIAN F."}

Both of us had never eaten French food before and we were very happy. First off its a small place with a full bar and nice wine selection. The tables are pretty close together but the service is excellent. Our first course was a tuna tartare. It was really really good. Second course was a beet (yea beet) carppachio with candied walnuts and goat cheese and it was bomb. Third course was roasted quail served over a mizune salad, the quail had nice crispy skin and tender flavorful meat and the salad was light and citrusy. Fourth course was monkfish over a lobter Risotto with a parmesan tweel, I liked the flavors of the fish and Risotto but she didn't care for it much. Fifth course was a beef medallion over scallopped potatoes with a red wine reduction sauce and also on the plate was a big bone with a spoon in it to eat the marrow. This plate was the best so far. About midway through our meal before we were served this course the chef himself came to our table and asked us how we'd like our beef cooked I told him to make it the way he likes it so I got rare and she got Med tame then he even convinced us to get two glasses of wine. The meat was delicious. And the bone marrow was interesting but tasty. Its a bit texterally unpleasant but if that's not a probably for you then you'd. Like it.  Last for dessert we received a pear panna cotta with. A cookie. It was the perfect light cold dessert to end the meal. We look forward to coming back and trying the reg menu which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.

But since the minimum is 1 star, this will be my first 1 star experience. \n\nHere's the reason why. \n\nThis weekend was my brother's 30th birthday. However, I had promised M that I would attend a wedding down in LA. I get an email from my brother's fiancee indicating that there was a birthday party Sunday which I thought was going to work out well. We even decided to go to the airport to try to catch an earlier flight. \n\nDue to less than stellar flight conditions at SFO, we were delayed getting in which we then promptly rushed to San Francisco. Here is gripe #1. Chapeau! is located in a residential neighborhood with VERY BAD lighting to the point which I wasted a lot of time driving up and down the street looking for it (this is important later) as well as for parking. \n\nAfter we found a spot to park, my thoughts were that the drama was over and we could sit down to a nice meal with my brother and his friends. Sadly this was not to be.\n\nTo be clear, my brother and his friends were already seated at the restaurant and had been there for quite a while. We walked into the restaurant at 10:10pm at which point we were informed the kitchen was no longer taking any orders after 10pm. My brother had already mentioned to the waiter that we were coming and at no point was he or anyone else alerted that the kitchen was not taking orders (not closed as the dinner party was still only on their first course). Now, you could say that we were late and we deserved it but this was a mere 10 minutes after their policy and given that it was a party of 10 that was probably going to drop serious coin on dinner, one would think that they would be at least somewhat flexible. \n\nI would point out that they did relent and offer us the choice of ordering only cold dishes (i.e. appetizers and salads), no soup!! I mean seriously, WTF?\n\nI can honestly say that I have never had such a negative dining experience or should I say almost-dining experience. There were no apologies just \"this is what it is, take it or leave it\". \n\nSo I chose to vote with my wallet and left.

Once on a dinner date with my boyfriend and the second time his father, brother and a friend came along. It was our recommendation for dinner. We chose the 4 course meal both times. For the appetizer I ordered Oyster on the Half Shell and I loved it soo much!  I Love the Trou Normand palate cleanser. For my main I had the Cassoulet de Toulouse.  Which was way too much for a girl like me to eat so my boyfriend had the amazing left overs for lunch the next day.  And of course I had room for dessert, the Warm Chocolate Cake Mmmm! .. I can never turn down chocolate. Over all the dining experience was lovely, the staff is so helpful, warm and inviting. The head chef really tops it off, every single person who leaves gets a personal goodbye from him which I think adds so much to the dining experience.

I watched him pick up stray silverware off the ground, run food, and even carve the rib eye for 2 table side- all while never missing a beat when it came to making sure his guests were having a great time.

We had dinner with my parents here recently and the attention to service was nearly perfect. There is a great sense of personality and neighborhood, most likely because of Chapeau's location, but also because of the graciousness and gregariousness of both the owners; they really make it a point to stop by each table and/or greet you at the door. Oh the food? Fantastic, very French. The lamb is terrific, but also keep an eye out on the specials of the night.

This deal really encourages you to try all sorts of different apps/entrees/desserts each time you go with whoever you go with.\n\nI had the pleasure of enjoying this meal with a wonderful companion who enjoyed the meal equally. Of course he gets bonus points for A. making reservations before evening having to discuss where we wanted to go for the \"date\"  B. picking a place he knew I wanted to try C. being able to hold a great conversation through out dinner.  It's always nice to try twice the # of items with a +1. Anyways, we had:\n1. Mensulan (sp?) Salad - loved the baby greens, the pecans, and whatever the heck they put in the dressing.. DELISH\n2. Salmon Three-Ways - YUM. Caviar. Roe. Hard-Boiled Eggs crumbles. etc. etc.\n3. Duck Leg - tender, sweet and succulent...me love duck any way.\n4. Filet Mignon - tender, cooked just right to med-rare.\n5. Creme Brulee - big honkin' dish of it.. tons of vanilla bean\n6. Profiteroles - 3 perfectly baked puffs with freshly scooped vanilla bean ice cream and a generous douse of chhhhhocolate sauce..hellla good.\n\nService is wonderful and far from pretencious - something difficult to find in French restaurants across the city and possibly country. The staff is incredibly genuine, they fill your glasses before you know it, provide honest recommendations, and I enjoyed the fact that they have multiple servers for such a small place. Granted this place is a shoe box, or what we like to call cozy, and doesn't have a bar or over the top brasserie fixtures... I will come back again for the intimate ambiance, the great service, the vast selection of exquisite dishes to choose from and Phillipe's two-cheek kisses of good-bye.

I came here after several recommendations from a friend.  We had a 5:30 reservation and were probably the 5th couple in at that time.  I must admit that having the early bird special is a good way to get people to try out the restaurant.  It's the main reason we went.\n\nWe were first introduced to a small cup of asparagus soup on the house.  It was a very simple soup made of pureed asparagus and some light cream.  So far so good.\n\nWe both ordered the rosemary-skewered escargots as the appetizer.  It was pretty good but nothing to really write home about.  The presentation was a little messy.  \n\nI ordered the duck confit cassoulet.  It tasted very home-styled and not particularly fancy.  It's basically white beans and sausage baked in a clay dish with a confit duck leg.  It's not what I imagined, so I was a little disappointed.\n\nMy wife had the white wine steamed mussels.  They give you a large bowl of mussels and its exactly what I expected.  Simple with a little bit of sweetness.  \n\nFor dessert, they didn't have the red wine soup.  I ordered the creme brulee and my wife had this fruit salad/custard mix.  The creme brulee was good because the dish was shallow and had a solid layer crusty sugar.  The fruit salad/custard was unimpressive.  \n\nThe 3 stars are there because overall, the meal is an excellent deal at $25 per person for a 3-course meal.  It's the main reason we came to this place.  However, it was decided afterwards that we would quickly go back to The House or Chez Panisse in a heartbeat.

A low salary and flexible schedule enabled me to take advantage of the early prix-fixe special.  Years later I still come back for the prime time meals.  \n\nPhillipe and his wife are the driving force behind this restaurant.  I've never been disappointed with the food here.  Their passion for the place is apparent in every bite.  In addition to the classic French dishes, like my deliciously fresh frisee salad with fingerling potato chip bits and duck confit, there's an occasional modern creation, like the wonderful basil napoleon I had for dessert.  Impeccably fresh delicious fruit with crisp thin puff pastry in an intensely green basil infused sauce.  But how to keep the basil sauce green??  The sauce was clearly syrup based, and lacks the oil that keeps pesto bright green.  We had to ask Philipe what the trick was, so when he bade us farewell after the meal, we inquired about the color of the sauce.  Engaging Phillipe in a discussion about cooking techniques opened a floodgate of knowledge and artistic passion.  Phillipe explained the basil leaves must be blanched quickly first and then incorporated into the sauce cold and strained.  Phillipe also revealed many of his other talents from the musical to his role in the design of his restaurant logo.   \n\nChapeau! also  has an excellent wine selection for a relatively small restaurant.  We had a bottle of a 2005 vintage from Gigondas, the year of a visit to the region in Provence and the wine brought back happy memories of the trip for our table.  Finally, they threw in a complementary dessert, a delicious apple tart with carmel and hazelnut ice cream.  \n\nMy dinner here was roughly half the price of a meal at the Dining Room at the Ritz or Coi or any of the other super premiere restaurants, but to me, is equally satisfying or more. Phillipe is an artist, Chapeau! is his studio, and he runs it with the warmth of his heart.  Thanks Phillipe!  Five stars are gladly given for a personal touch and excellent food.\n\nnote:  this bistro is at times a pretty loud, boisterous place - over the years I've noticed more groups that come to Chapeau! for big events.

This place is a lot bigger than the old location. I remembered how wonderful the old place was and hadn't been here since the move. I came in for the early bird special $28 for a 3-course meal. I went online to preview the menu and the one we got that evening was different. I ended up ordering: Trio of Salmon, the grilled sea bass with mashed potato underneath, and the vanilla cr\u00e8me brulee. I liked the trio of salmon very much - the mixture of flavors and textures was unbelievable. The grilled sea bass was nothing special however; I liked how the mash potatoes and sauce mixed together for a delightful side. I liked how there was a wide surface of the hardened shell for the cr\u00e8me brulee. I shared the dessert with a friend and I preferred the warm French toast with hazelnut gelato. \n\nThe service was good. The server we had recommended a light white wine with my entr\u00e9e. He also gave me a tip on how to get the most flavor out of the trio of salmon. Service was a little slow since the restaurant was packed. We got there before 5:45PM and didn't finish until close to 8PM. My friend and I took our merry ole time chatting and eating. We were never rushed and the waiter poured a generous amount of wine for a half glass. \n\nVerdict: I still love this place!

Sat at the bar for 55 minutes while waiting for a table.  The chef came around three times and thanked us for coming to his restaurant.  We were finally seated !  An other couple who arrived about 35 to 40 minutes after we had arrived at Capeau was seated at the same time we were seated.  They received water and an menu when they were seated, as we were left to sit for another 10 minutes before even receiving a menu.  Dinner took 2 hours to be served after being seated.  That's to long to be sitting in one place and be comfortable.  The place was full.  I was wondering why such a long wait, as I looked around at the other tables around us, they were waiting for food and service and looking just as uncomfortable as we were.  I think that the chef/owner would have better served his customers by staying in the kitchen and cooking. \n Well, let's get to the food !!  It's a French restaurant known for sauces,  OK !!\nThe bread and soup were excellent, good start !  The sweetbreads were also very good. Not the best, but very good. Then it fell apart, the serve between the courses was an extended length of time, the entree finally arrived, Halibut for myself and Skate for my wife.  Both of the fish were of excellent quality, after one scraped off the sauce to be able to taste the real fish.  It's not to said that the sauces were bad, they were just over powering. There was a few items in the sauces, like fava beans, which added color, but not anything for the taste.  This seemed to be thought process of the chef, put together unusual combinations that may look and sound good on the menu, thou not necessarily complement each other when tasted.  WHICH IS THE HARD PART !!\nAfter almost three hours of sitting down, we skipped dessert and left a lot of hard earned money for something that was far from satisfying.  \nAn old bus boy from the Arches restaurant in Newport Beach CA", "author": "Ron S."}

We had Menu 2 that comes with an appetizer, fish tasting, entree, and dessert.  Also got the palate cleanser that comes before the entree.\n\nOff all the dishes, the appetizers were the best (there were two of us - thus we tried each others' dishes).  I had the salade landaise (with duck) - the duck was good and the dressing was not overwhelming.  The corn soup was good - not great (Lukas over in Oakland still has one of the best corn chowders).  \n\nThe fish tasting dish was scallops...it was just ok (just a seared scallop with a sauce I can't remember).  The palate cleanser was a sorbet - nice and refreshing to clear out your palate.  The entrees were underwhelming.  I thought my filet mignon was a bit gamey and the bacon on the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin was not crispy.\n\nDesserts...we got the chocolate cake and basil napoleon.

Kokkari (greek) said they could only do 9:30.  Great in either case!  We walked in and half the restaurant was empty.  It was rather quiet as well.  Not sure about the other reviews when they say that it was loud.  I was perturbed by how 3 employees walked past us on there way to doing something...each one aknowledging us but not seating us.  I guess they have no actual \"hostess\".  They have no hostess stand either.  Our server eventually ended up seating us at a 2-top which I thought was odd considering they had sooo many tables open.  Before we got seated, my date even asked if I wanted to leave! (yes, it was that odd).\n\nWe finally got seated and the server asked us if we would like to start with a drink before dinner.  We both knew we wanted wine but no wine list had been provided!  She asked him (but not me) \"sparkling or still\" and then walked away.  The inattentive service stopped there.  When she came back she was very helpful with the wine list and the menu.  We never once had to pour our own wine, each course was staged well, and the employees all worked fluidly as a team to create a wonderful experience. \n\nI had the $38 3-course menu and my date had the $48 4-course menu.  We each ordered a palate cleanser as well.  \nTiny cups of Truffled Squash Flowered Soup :  these were on the house.  I truly got excited when I saw how perfectly the chive garnish had been cut.  This attentin to detail was carried throughout the meal. \nOysters :  great minonette with black peppercorns... worked well and they oysters were nicely shucked.\nSweetbreads : very rich!  Nicely prepared and mild in flavor.  Trumpet mushrooms with a foie gras and truffle reduction butter sauce.  Oh my!  \nPalate cleansers : Apple one was a bit syrupy and the citrus one was realllllyyy strong in the vodka flavor!  I dont think they can serve that one to a minor!\nScallop \"tasting fish\" option:  Absolutely wonderful.  I am not a scallop person but these were perfectly prepared,  Pesto risotto base, seared scallop, tomato compote topping and a sweet bbq-esque sauce round the plate.\nEntrees:\nFilet Mignon : Actually MELTED in your mouth.  Oh wow!  \nRack of Lamb : A bit overdone ( I had asked for medium rare to rare).  But still very yummy!  It came with an eggplant mash, artichoke hearts, roasted cloves of garlic, and baked peppers (a little mushy).  \n\nDessert: Chocolate Lava Cake with banana caramel and banana filling.  The fruit threw us off a bit.\nProfiteroles :  Filled with ice cream that could have had more vanilla flavor. I have had better desserts.  \n\nWhile some things were definitely 5 star (filet and sweetbreads), some things were off (vodka palate cleanser, hostess, hard to navigate wine list, profiteroles)\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Unpretentious french cuisine.", "author": "Shannon S."}

I've heard many great things about Chapeau and they lived up to my expectations.  Food was spectacular.  We started off with the roasted escargot and potatoes, and the foie gras.  They were quite generous with their portion of foie gras.  The foie gras was excellent and I can still taste it in my mouth just thinking about it.  The complementary asparagus soup was a nice touch also.  For our entrees both the Atlantic salmon and filet mignon was cooked just right.  The saffron mashed potatoes added a nice contrast in texture and flavor with the salmon.  While the King Trumpet and Oyster mushrooms were quite a treat in itself with the filet mignon.  We finished the night with the warm chocolate cake and some coffee.  The chocolate cake was to die for.  It just oozed with chocolate the second you put your spoon into it.

It is by far the best food value in San Francisco.  This is a three-course meal, with plenty to choose from, full-size portions for just $24 per person.  Add about $18 for a half bottle of nice French red wine (full bottles can be had for about twice that), and you have a great meal for two with wine,  tax and tip for about $83.\n\nThe food is consistently wonderful and suprising, even when I have the same things again.  The soups are to die for, as are most of the appetizers.  I had the warm brie and potato thingy (can't remember the actual name) while my wife had the chestnut soup, which had a hint of curry.  The salmon is always excellent, and the portion is huge.  I had the pork loin, which was out of this world.  My wife have raved about the mussels.  The only disappointment for me is the cassoulet, which is very rich and gets tiresome after a few bites.\n\nEvery times we've been there, Ellen always brings us a third dessert to try, and of course who can refuse?!

But when it came time to celebrate a special occasion, I wanted something nicer than our usual fare and with the high Yelp ratings, we went to Chapeau.\n\nI must say the ratings are well deserved.  I was a little eh on French cuisine before but if it's like this then I'm converting!  Everything was melt-in-your-mouth-I've-died-and-gone-to-heaven good.  After the first few timid bites, we no longer were asking ourselves what we were eating, we just ate it because it was that good.\n\nWe both ordered from the pre fixe menu and while the portions seemed small at first glance, at the end of the meal we were full and satisfied.\n\nThe tables are a little closer to each other than what I would prefer, but not so close where I feel that I am a part of the conversation at the next table over even though I don't want to be.\n\nThe head chef even came out to greet and talk with all the tables, which was a nice touch.\n\nI went here a second time and while my expectations were higher (since I knew what to expect this time), the food was still very good.  I just wasn't blown away by it as in my first visit.", "author": "E F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-03", "description": "I do not think my expectations were any higher for this place knowing that it is highly rated on Yelp.  Perhaps my first experience was not typical.  The service was not up to par for my expectations for a $60 per person meal.  The food was definitely good, although IMHO the appetizers we had were the best--that was part of the problem.\n\nOne of us had the 3 course prix fixe, and I had the 4 course.  We each had a glass of wine.  That adds up to $110+ before tip.  Sure, I suppose it's still a good deal for what you get, but be warned:  it adds up.  The prices have gone up:  3 course is $40, 4 course $45, and if you get the 4 course with a palette cleanser, it's $49.  \n\nI also was not so pleased to find out after the fact that the glass of wine I ordered(which was a substitute for something they had run out of in the menu) was more expensive than any other wine by the glass on the menu.  \n\nWe were not in a hurry at all, since our reservation was at 6:15 on a Friday.  However, multiple times I found myself looking up to see if a server would attend to us.  I understand that they were busy, but again, I expected better service.  The only time I saw our appointed server was during the order, the filling of the wine, and when he brought the check after 9pm.  They really took their time, and my butt felt it on the wooden chair.  When you find yourself shifting your bottom more than once out of discomfort, it's a sure sign that things are rolling along slowly.\n\nWe didn't leave until after 3 hours later--some of it was definitely due to the slowness in service.  Based on this first experience, I am not sure if I'd be back.  I certainly would be a bit hesitant to give it a second try.\n\nThey're \"merging\" with Clementine about a week from this review and will be in the Inner Richmond from there on.", "author": "Stephen N."}

So I had really high expectations.  To celebrate my birthday, some friends took me here.  The restaurant is small but cozy, and looks like a nice neighborhood place.  We had 8pm reservations and were seated promptly.  The place was packed with people waiting at the bar.  For dinner, I opted for the prix-fixe menu, where you could select an appetizer, entree, and dessert for a pretty decent price.  For appetizer, I ordered the deep fried tiger prawns.  It was good and the batter was light and crispy.  My friend got the onion soup, which I tried and also thought was tasty. The cheese was nicely melted and gooey.  For my entree, I got the special that night, which was the pan seared scallops over risotto. This was good.  I enjoyed it.  Hubby got the duck and that was pretty good too.  My friend got the filet mignon and asked for it medium rare but unfortunately, it came out almost well done, so it was tough and chewy, without a lot of flavor.  Her husband got the pork tenderloin and it was a bit on the bland side, as well.  When the server came over to ask how our entrees were, my friend told him the filet was overcooked.  The server was very nice about it and apologized and offered to take it back, but since they already ate half of it, they didn't want to make a big fuss.  To make it up to us, they gave us 2 desserts on the house, in addition to the ones we already ordered.  That put our total to 7 desserts.  LOL.  It was definitely dessert overload.  I really enjoyed the napoleon, surprisingly.  I didn't think I would like it but I really enjoyed how fresh it was with the all the fruits.  It definitely wasn't like a traditional napoleon.  My other favorite was the profiteroles.  The french toast was interesting since I would typically associate that with breakfast rather than dessert.  It was a bit sweet for me because of the caramel they drizzled on top, but my hubby really liked it.  Overall, the experience at Chapeau was good but not great. I guess I just had really high expectations, given the raves and reviews.  I would come back again to give it another try.", "author": "Kat M."}

I ordered the mussels as an appetizer.  A portion of ten mussels was delivered to me, an appropriate size for an appetizer portion.  Those that were opened were delicious, but three of the mussels were closed.  No kitchen that's paying attention would let that happen.  When I called it to the waiter's attention, he was absolutely rude, and told me the kitchen couldn't be expected to notice something like that!  He very grudgingly agreed to replace the mussels.\n\nI hoped for better on the main course, the cassoulet.  The dish was very tasty, and the beans were piping hot.  The meat was tepid.  I didn't have the energy to deal with the waiter again, so I just ate it and decided to warn others of my experience.  Clearly, the kitchen staff at Chapeau! has the benefit of some lovely recipes.

Ray and i were in the city last weekend and it was the perfect time to go. we made reservations a few weeks in advance through open table, and even then we could only choose 6:00 or 8:30, so we knew it was going to be busy. we opted for the 6:00 reservation, and when we arrived last saturday night, we knew which table was ours, it was the only one open!\n\nit was a lone table in the front window, which was nice because we didnt have to deal with rubbing elbows with the people at the tables next to ours as other people have noted. it was loud, but since i was expecting it after reading reviews here, it didnt bother me. \n\nwe of course went with the prix fixe menu. ray ordered the french onion soup, but they were out so he got the creamy vegetable-type soup (i cant remember the name. oh yes, veloute!) and it was so good! he ordered the bacon wrapped  pork and the chocolate cake for dessert. he liked it all! i cant say anything about his, i liked mine too much to even think about what he was eating!\n\ni had the warm brie on the potato and leek dauphine (it was good, not awesome really, except the purple sauce that was on it, it was VERY good!). for my entree i had the filet mignon and this is the real reason i am giving this place 5 stars. i have NEVER had a steak cooked as perfectly as this one. and it was perfectly seasoned, served with garlic-type mushrooms and something sort of like home-fries, little perfect cubes of perfectly fried potato. oh my god. seriously, i think it may have been the best entree of my 24 years of existence. for dessert, i have the tarte grand mere and again, oh my god! the crust was perfect, the custard was not too thin and not too thick, and the apples were tender but still had their texture, and were not too sweet. i really liked that the scoop of vanilla ice cream served next to the tarte was sprinkled with a little turbinado sugar, it added a good texture. ray said that his rum rasin ice cream had the same sugar, something so simple made a big difference!\n\nwe didnt have anything to drink except water, and we had to be the only people there not drinking wine, just not our thing. but their wine list was very extensive and there seemed to be something for everyone there.\n\nso it was a little over $100 with tip, and it was worth every penny! the only thing was that parking was really hard to find, so we had to walk abotu 5 blocks, but it could have been worse. the atmosphere was very laid back and casual, not stuffy at all. i would definitely come back here!", "author": "jenny s."}

Ordered 2 different wines - both of which are not available any longer.  Apparently, the wine list is not updated at all.  And the first wine I ordered - pinot noir - our waiter who pretends he knows a lot about wine said, \"oh, you want dessert wine?\".   Of course, we were just laughing.  He came back with a more expensive wine (which I know was not good at all) - and said the wine we ordered is not available.\nThen, the 2nd time we ordered wine - medoc - the same waiter said, oohhh... now you want cabernet??  I looked at him, then I said \"I hope you are getting the right wine\".  He came back, of course - with a different wine which is more expensive and said he didn't have the one we ordered.  So, we just settled - since we don't want to keep waiting.  Did I say - this is 1-1/4 hours after our reservation???\n\n3. I told the chef this dinner is for both of my friends' birthday.  He made no attempt to bring candles for them.\n\nThe chef sent us a free appetizer and dessert.  Which I thought is quite nice.  But, given the so unpleasant experience for the first 1-1/2 hours - i think it had just ruined it for me.\n\nWill I come back - absolutely NO!!!  There are better french restaurants out there with a much better service and better food....", "author": "petrus p."}

We both ordered the menus with  salade landaise and moule frites as apps and the cassoulet and filet mignon as entrees.  The salade was our favorite, as the duck was so flavorful, delicate, and tender, but we loved everything we ordered.   The portions were just right, even for my meat and potatoes hubby.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-13", "description": "I have to say that this is one occasion where perhaps I shouldn't have read the yelp reviews of Chapeau! prior to eating there.  Given the nearly unanimously stellar reviews, it was with very high expectations that I dined at this outer Richmond favorite.  Needless to say , I was very much let down. \n\nFirst off, when you first walk into the place you enter a closet sized curtained enclosure where you are expected to wait for your table.  This we did with another couple.  It felt like all four of us were playing seven minutes in heaven except it was more like 10 minutes and there was no making out.  Thats pretty minor for me, I'm not a big complainer...just pointing it out.  As for the service...It was all very much well-intentioned I suppose, but it was all over the place.  Similar to reviewer andy, we literally had about four different waiters, none of whom paid any real attention to us.  \n\nThen there is Phillipe...Highly touted for his signature \"french\" kisses.  Again I agree with Andy in that the whole thing seems kind of gimmicky now.  When we left we were about a block away when I hear running from behind...I swear I thought I was getting rolled on by gangstas.  Sure enough it was Phillipe, as promised, with the kisses.  \n\nThe worst part of the whole evening for me ,though , had to do with the wine service. After laboring to find the perfect Bordeaux for the night, Phillipe comes over and presents the bottle to my date.  \"What's this?\" I ask myself...\"could Phillipe be mistaken about who ordered (and who's paying)?\"  I mean after all I think it was the busboy who took my wine order so its very possible.  Phillipe continues to pour the taster for my date, who at this point is equally baffled, and then pours himself a small glass.  He toasts my date as they both sip the wine and I stare in disbelief.  I cant imagine anyone who doesn't know that the person who ordered always taste first before the guest is served.  And that he poured himself a taste?!?!?.. Don't get me wrong if he had employed the proper serving method I would have gladly poured him a healthy glass.  But it was almost as if he wanted to pull the whole \"smooth french guy hitting on the american dude's chick\"  thing.   That little move really turned me off from the beginning.\n\nThe food...yeah its good, but not nearly as good as the reviews suggest.  I can't claim any expertise on french food, but what we had was enjoyable.  Mussels, brie, cassoulet, filet mignon and creme brulee...All as part of the prix fixe deal, which is quite reasonable.  I would recommend trying Chapeau! if you live in the area, but certainly do not travel far for it.", "author": "Mark B."}

I had the early bird special and chose my appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the Mesclun salad, the Petit Poussin, and the creme brulee. The food came at a pretty decent pace, not too fast where I couldn't have a deep conversation, and not too long where the conversations get a bit awkward and dry. The salad was amazing and I recommend it to everyone. When I was looking at the menu, I was wondering what a poussin was so I looked it up on my phone and it turned out to be a young cornish hen no older than 28 days... I hope wikipedia got that wrong because that is just bad to know in general. The bird was good but wasn't great, maybe it was because of the lavender honey glaze... or the taste of young slaughter, I'm kidding. Last was the creme brulee and that is delicious. It doesn't take much to make a tasty creme brulee and surprisingly it was sweet and fluffy, just how I like it.

While the prix fixe was a good value, the place needed some work. What I loved was that the owner warmly greets you when you arrive and depart. I felt the hospitality of a neighborhood Parisian bistro which was nice. But the service did not deliver to my expectations at all. \n\nWe sat at the bar and unfortunately, the bartender was really unprepared and untrained. She hardly spoke English. We kept trying to get her attention to order a pre dinner drink. It was not even busy yet and the place was mostly empty. She instead asked us what we would like to order for dinner and then busily worked away on rasberry mojitos unskillfully taking longer than that annoying drink should take. We kept trying to get her attention until our first course arrived and we still had not been asked for a drink. Finally, my husband flagged down a waiter though the bartender was standing right in front of us simply flustered and she couldn't understand a word that we said anyway. This waiter was on the ball. We said that we never got a chance to order a cocktail, but at least could we have some wine. He recommended a great bottle and was really fast about making up for the bartender's lack of training and basic language skills. \n\nBut the timing of our meal was really off and it was so disappointing for the most part. We were there for a Saturday night dinner, it doesn't make sense to put an ill trained person who doesn't speak English in a top service position on such a busy night. \n\nI did not really want to do this on yelp, because the owner seems genuinely nice and the other servers are probably better. I tried to email Chapeau! directly, but the email address from the website was invalid. \n\nThe place has much potential, but on the night we visited it was grossly mismanaged from a service perspective.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-22", "description": "Chapeau! has been a favorite of mine almost since they opened -- nearly 15 years ago.\n\nI have never been able to figure out how Philippe and Ellen turn out the quality of food that they do for the exceptional low price.  It is AMAZING.\nI love the desserts -- the chocolate/banana cake!  The white nut-filled dessert!\n\nSo -because I have loved Chapeau! for so many years...it hurts to say this, but  I am going to write it in the hope that Philippe reads it. \n\n First of all, the service has always been spotty. When everyone was thrown in like sardines in the old place, you felt that there was an excuse.  But it's the same in the new locations and, I believe it is getting worse.  Example:  I was in a couple of months ago -- late on a weeknight, and the place was more than half empty, so busy-ness not an excuse.  Brought a friend who had never been in for a glass of wine, dessert, coffee.  He knew that I love the place and the owners and had been coming for years.  I almost had to stand up on the table and shout to even get a glass of wine (Ellen was talking with some patron, the maitre d' and waiters were oblivious).  \n\nAlso, the way the front people dress sets the tone for the restaurant and I think they need to raise the bar a bit.  Being The Richmond doesn't have much in the way of restaurants with any style -- and I think that's an important niche that Chapeau! has filled.  You used to be able to dress up a bit to go to Chapeau. But being greeted by someone who looks like they have been scrubbing floors doesn't really tend to encourage that. \n\n I have only once in my long association with the restaurant taken advantage of the Early Bird Special.  Some friends were coming up from San Jose and made a huge effort to get here in time to make it . We looked at the menu and there were scallops as starters...and we asked if it might be possible to get them as an entree.  The maitre d' smiled and winked and said \"oh, for you, of course I can!\"  NO mention of any extra charge.  when the bill came, there was a significant extra charge that wiped out all the Early Bird savings...and other things were suspicious.  I asked about the charge for the scallops and was told \"oh no, no...had to charge extra.\"  Because we were in a hurry, because I was with friends I rarely see, because I had said it was one of my favorite restaurants,  because Philippe was not there, and because  have been a customer for so many years and think of them as friends, I did not want to get into a further \"discussion\" and let it go.  I have always LOVED Chapeau and sent so many people there, introduced so many people to the restaurant...so to have that happen left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth...and wondering if perhaps \"games\" are played if Philippe is not around. \n\nAlso -- it would help if he would get bartenders who have some personality!  There was a tall guy with glasses in there for awhile who was personable -- but the rest of them add nothing behind the bar. Philippe has all the personality in the world - why doesn't he get a bartender who has some sparkle and social skills?  It could make a huge difference (not, of course, that he's lacking business..!)\n\n\nAgain -- I have loved Chapeau! for many years -- so I hope with all my heart that they will thrive for another 15 years!  I just might as well tell the truth in the hopes that these things are addressed.", "author": "L M."}

Came here for my graduation dinner with family, made reservations about a week in advance. The earliest time they had available was 8, so we went there at 8. Upon arriving, I noticed the restaurant was crowded (and was so glad I made the reservations). \nFood was just amazing! It did take a little longer than I expected but I'll say it was worth the wait! I had the fish, and it was yummy! While we waited, we were able to eat bread and butter, which was really great for me since I absolutely love bread, and they had the European butter, which is just heaven when combining the two. Dessert was just as amazing. We had creme brulee, the orange soup (which was better than I thought it would be) and the sorbet. I really loved the creme brulee even though I felt full I just couldn't help but to savor the dessert. \nThey give your bill in a lovely hat (quite unique and interesting) and upon walking out, they thanked us for coming and gave the French goodbye greeting. I can't rate the price (my parents paid the bill and I don't recall the prices for our meal) but the quality was definitely A plus. Overall an amazing experience for me.", "author": "Yosie G."}

The window blinds are closed in the evening making the name on the glass virtually impossible to see. When we finally found the restaurant, my boyfriend and I were greeted at the door by a man who I would later find out is the head chef.  He was so warm and friendly. We showed up half an hour early for our reservation but they were able to seat us right away.  The restaurant is small, with simple decor, very charming, cheesy wall painted with flowers and doors.\n\nThe staff were okay. I still think the service at Clementine is the best in the city.  We had to ask twice for water and the food was slow. Normally would have been okay if I wasn't starving to death. The Chef gave us an excellent wine recommendation.  We ordered the evening special which was prime rib for 2 served with marrow bone (yum!), several sauces, greens and a potato gratin.  We also ordered the fois gras appetizer, the goat cheese and polenta appetizer, a tasting fish of halibut over gnocci, and the praline pie.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  Barely a word was spoken over dinner because we were too busy salivating over the party in our mouths! However, the meal was ruined by two things. 1) the chairs are sooooo incredibly uncomfortable. After two hours we were barely able to walk because our butts were so sore. 2) I underestimated my weight and bust size and ended up wearing a shirt that kept bursting open with any sudden movement. so as we were leaving and the Chef asked me for kisses on the cheek, I left him with a quick dessert.", "author": "Jade L."}

As good as restaurants that cost much more.  However, it seems that you can't have great food and good service at a reasonable price.  One of the three must suffer, and at Chapeau it is the service.  \n\nWe were seated at a time when there were two other tables occupied.  We had plans to attend a movie 2 hours and 30minutes later.  Things started a little slow, but we were well on track to make the movie when our appetizers were done and entrees brought.  The people at the next table, seated about 20 minutes after us, already had dessert menus in their hands, but we were enjoying the experience and not yet worried.  A half hour after our entree plates were cleared, when we still hadn't seen a dessert menu or our waiter, we were starting to get a little irritated.  After flagging down another staff person to request a dessert menu, our waiter brought the menu.  Had we not ordered the prix fixe menu, we would have skipped dessert, but since we were paying for it we wanted it.  The waiter acknowledged that he thought we had already ordered desert, but did not apologize in any way.  Then, he disappeared for another 15 or 20 minutes, so we couldn't even order.  We requested the check when we finally ordered dessert, and stressed that we were now running late for other plans.  After finishing dessert, we again asked for the check, which was eventually brought to us in a cute little hat.  I immediately put a credit card in the hat and tried to hand it back to the waiter.  He walked away and went to help other people.  I waited about 10 more minutes and went to the bar to pay the check.  Needless to say, we missed our movie.\n\nI find it hard to believe that a restaurant with service this poor can survive in the city.  Of course, the people seated 20 minutes after us left long before we did, so their service experience was probably better.  I realize that mistakes are sometimes made, but the lack of any attempt to apologize was abhorrent.  On the way out, the chef (I am assuming) said that he hoped that our experience was good.  I told him about the experience, he said that he was sorry and hoped that I would return.  Unless they do something to assure that my next experience is not the same, that is doubtful.

I wish that they offered a wine pairing with the menu but they didn't; they do have an ok wine list that is fairly inexpensive. \nThe restaurant was a little cramped. I was seated in the middle of two tables and I had a hard time having a conversation with my friend right across from me. The service was also a little slow and nothing special. Don't expect too much as far as service and don't go there if you are in a rush, it took them over 10 minutes just to get water to the table and give us our menus. \nI think I will go again to give them another chance,", "author": "Marie-Claire R."}

My friend had made reservations for 9PM (for a party of three) and when we first got there, the hostess told us that it'll be a few minutes. It was awkward waiting there since the restaurant is pretty small and they crammed in as many tables as they could. Finally 20 minutes later, we were seated at our table. \nBy this time, I was somewhat irritated since we had to waited (even with reservation)- but I soon was distracted by the interesting menu and great, extensive wine list. The 3 meal tasting menu for $38 is a great deal- I ordered the Salmon trio as the appetizer (slices of fresh salmon, salmon tartare, caviar), Pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon with yam puree, and ended the dinner with the warm chocolate cake. \nI had a 2005 Pinot Noir and it was one of the best wines I've had. \nThe food was excellent- the portions were  pretty good. However, the only downside was that the timing of the food was pretty stretched out- we didn't leave the restaurant u ntil 2.5 hours later! Also, the restaurant was so noisy that my friends and I had to shout to each other in order to be heart. \nOverall, I give this retaurants a 3.5 stars (I rounded up- hence the 4 stars):\n4.5 stars for the food\n2 stars for the noise\n2 stars for the wait & timing of the food\nThe food is great and I will most likely return; it's unfortunate that the other aspects of the visit deter from the real attraction (the food).", "author": "Luce T."}

Their decor just didn't live up to their price. This is a place where the food doesn't match up well with their setting. Now don't get me wrong, they do serve fantastic classic regional French cuisine with a bit of a homemade feel to it but when you're there you don't get that cozy and relaxed setting as you would imagine finding in a small family owned bistro in the south of France while enjoying a hearty cassoulet. The setting's too bland, the seats are uncomfortable and some of the tables are way too close together.

We were seated on time for our reservation and then completely ignored for at least 15 minutes. A table of 3 that was seated after us was enjoying wine and placing their order before we had even been acknowledged or glanced at a menu! I had to ask a busboy for some water, he was extremely apologetic and for the remainder of the evening provided us with great service (he deserves a promotion). Our waiter eventually made his way to our table, ran through the specials took our order and was never to be seen again. He spent time chatting it up with a french speaking table while not even stopping by for a second to see how our meal was or ask if we needed anything. Luckily our busboy took great care of us and I'm regretting that we did not hand him the entire tip on our way out the door.

A favorite dish of mine, Chapeu's baked pork belly took the hat for best I have had. My boyfriend got skate fish which lay in a tangy gravy. Flaky and tender, it was as well cooked as fish can be.

The prices, on the other hand, are a bit above average, in my opinion, for what you get - except for the wine list, which had numerous reasonably priced options. First, starting with the atmosphere - it was too bright and looked somewhat like a wedding reception, rather than a cute, intimate French restaurant. Lowering the side lighting, turning off the overhead track lighting, and putting some candles on the table would do wonders for this place. Second, as others have noted, the tables are very close together. Fine, that's how it is in France. But, they need to do something about the noise. We kept joking that we were going to call each other on our cell phones because we couldn't hear each other talking across the table.\nNow on to the food. The brie - potato starter was tasty, but was a little on the sweet side (there was pear or something in there, too). It would have been very, very good had the main vegetarian course not been sweet, too. While also tasty, the raisins, the carmelized garnish (like you get in the top of an ice cream) made the veggie dish too sweet (with not enough salt), especially after having a starter that bordered on overly sweet. The filet mignon was apparently good (or so I was told), but nothing overly exceptional. The service was ok, although they screwed up one of the starters and forgot to bring a napkin to replace a dropped one after I asked twice.  All in all, an average dinner at above average prices.

Okay, we've been to Paris several times and our brother-in-law is French, so we know French food.  This is exceptional.  In my humble opinion, this is the best French food outside of Paris.  Portions are generous - the scallops and risotto were perfect, the pork tender loin was perfectly cooked and tender.  Our appetizer salads were ample - I hate it when you order a salad and you get three leaves of lettuce and a crouton.  Desserts didn't disappoint either.\n\nThis place is great for a special occasion, but not so pricey that you can't go more often - we'll be going more often, I can guarantee that!!  And, the owner did track us down on the side walk afterward to make sure we were happy.  Nice touch!!  When we told him that we loved it, he said \"you have good taste!\"  \n\nMake a reservation, what are you waiting for?", "author": "Steve J."}

I have been to the restaurant several times now. The first time was with a large birthday party and the service was impeccable. The other times were with smaller groups and as always the service was impeccable. The FOOD.. oh my god.. THE FOOD. AMAZING. There has been nothing that I have ordered there that wasn't fabulous. Can anyone say cauliflower soup? HOLY CRAP! And let's not forget the award winning wine list. The owner Phillipe is also the sommelier and has put together the greatest wine selection. The first time I went there, he had the best saying, \"Wine is made to be consumed, not to just sit on a shelf.\" So, in saying that, he has a wonderful selection of wine under $20 a bottle so you don't feel bad if you order 2. We always just let him bring the bottles for us, it's a lot of fun to see what he will pick!\n\nPhillipe and his wife are so charming and sweet. He greets everyone that comes through the doors and he says good bye to everyone that leaves. True customer service at it's best!!

It tasted as though Phillipe had prepared it at 6am, making it a mushy, salty disaster!\nThe Sea Bass was completely non-descript in flavor, and the Praline cake was without a doubt the worst dessert I have had in ANY restaurant.

I had the duck and for once there was actually more meat than fat!\nThe tables are very close together with no room to move so if you are seated as a couple it can feel like you are on a double date. Worse for me I was seated next to the most obnoxious girl who ordered her date about like he was a pet or a child (and I thought I was bossy) and so I found her constant ordering very distracting and that it hampered the enjoyment of my food. \nFurther, the \"glass\" of wine is hardly what I would consider a glass, although perhaps I can forgive this based on the choice of wines.\nOverall a nice restaurant with good food, middle of the ground prices and adequate service.

We were a little apprehensive  at first, as this was our first time dining at an upscale french restaurant and we weren't quite sure what to expect.  This all disappeared, however, from the moment we walked in the door and were greeted by the effusive chef.  The excellent service continued even after we were seated....our waiter provided several helpful suggestions on meal choices and wine parings.  As for the meal itself, we went with the 3-course price fix option.  For appetizers, we got the tiger prawns and blue cheese tart.  They were both fantastic, but the prawns were the clear favorite.  Afterwards, we were presented a small cup of cauliflower soup that was surprisingly flavorful.  Our main courses consisted of the petit poussin and the bouillabaisse.  The poussin was excellent, but oh man, the bouillabaisse was to die for.  It might be one of the best dishes I've ever had. We finished with the chocolate cake and basil neapolitan for dessert (sweet and refreshing).  Towards the end of our meal, the chef sat down at the table next to us, as his night was finishing.  He made it a point to ask us how our meal was, and wished us well as we left (he even hugged and kissed me goodbye).  In short, Chapeau! is a memorable dining experience....every dish we tried was seasoned to perfection, which is not the case at most other restaurants we've been to.

(the very expression \"chapeau!\" in french sounds about as hip as \"gee-whiz\", by the way). \n\nthe food. my mouth watered all the way there after reading the online menu. but... there was no brandade, there was no chestnut soup, they were out of a few of the dishes. the rest was fine, i mean, it was fine, solid, slightly inventive food that would have done equally well without the inventiveness. \n\nand it's in the middle of nowhere. now if it were on 22 + valencia, i'd say i'd stop by once in a while, but why on earth is someone going to drive across town (regarldess of where you live) to go to clement street to be treated to air-kisses and a check in a hat? oh, man.", "author": "and y."}

The food was wonderful...5+ stars for the chef!\n\nHowever, the service was not what it should have been.  Firstly, I had read on yelp about the waiter who kept saying they were out of the inexpensive ($40/bottle) wines and trying to push the more expensive ones.  I had the same experience and just thought: Either they really are out in which case this is a common problem and they should carry more wine OR they are lying to get people to buy the more expensive bottles which is just unethical.  Either way, they should fix this problem.  \n\nBut what really made me mad is that we were celebrating our 7 year anniversary.  I just stopped working to go to graduate school so the budget is a little tighter than it used to be and going out to a fancy dinner is not an every day thing.  My mom, knowing where I was going for our anniversary and knowing that our budgets are tight right now called ahead and gave them her credit card info and told them to bring a bottle of champagne to our table - her treat.  It was supposed to be a surprise so I didn't know about it.  The next day she asked how the champagne was and I told her of course that we didn't ever receive champagne - a little confused.  She called the restaurant to see what happened and they told her they had forgotten but they looked forward to seeing her/us soon.  Well, let me tell you something, I loved the food here and would have definitely been back if they had made it clear how apologetic they were at this situation, but they didn't seem to care at all.  In the food and bev industry, the way to apologize appropriately for the above situation would probably be to offer a complementary bottle of champagne for when we return...or at the very least maybe a glass or an appetizer??  That would prove their sincerest apologies and guarantee that we'd forgive the mistake and continue going back.  But no, they didn't do anything at all.  Sadly, I probably won't be back again...I'll just have to find another French restaurant to satisfy my foie gras cravings :(", "author": "Julia J."}

You can try the 3 course pre-fixe menu which is a great price or you can go a la carte. They have a lot of daily specials so hard to decide on what to get. The french onion soup was the best I ever had, I sworn off that soup years ago after a bad experience, but this place brought my confidence in the french soup staple back. I also had their pear tarte salad, yum! Poached pear on fresh greens, goat cheese or a crispy buttery flaky tart. Salivating yet? I had their duck for the main course, my husband had their skate, both were delicious, I thought both were just a tad bit salty, and they overdid my pepper. I had their very popular chocolate cake for dessert nothing spectacular, and husband had the classic creme brulee, also nothing special as I've had much better elsewhere.

We made reservations online and wrote that there was a birthday. When I walked in, this Asian lady walked towards me mumbling something and I kind of moved out of the way because I thought she was trying to get out. It turns out that she was the hostess. The reason I thought she was a customer was because she was so poorly dressed. She was wearing this heather gray sweater, a pair of jeans, and black slippers with white socks. The outfit seriously looked like it was purchased at Walmart and I'm honestly not saying this to be funny. She also had no make-up on, her hair was a mess and she didn't even bother smiling. The only way that I can explain how this tore up looking woman is the hostess is that she must be the chef/owner's wife because I seriously doubt anyone else would get away looking like that. Everyone else, including the bus boys, looked a million times better than this woman. Besides the angry homeless looking hostess, the service was pretty good. Our server, who I swear looked like the hostess's brother, was just OK but the bus boys were on top of everything and there was another guy who immediately took our drink orders even though he wasn't our server. The food, on the other hand, really wasn't that good. The presentation was excellent but the taste did not live up to the hype. The food was just mediocre and most definitely not worth the price. Also, I thought it was in really poor taste that no one acknowledged my mother's birthday. I mean, I'm not looking to get anything free, but whenever we make a reservation and we write that it's someone's birthday, the server always mentions it. A \"oh I heard that it's someones birthday...\" would have been nice. If I bothered mentioning it in the reservation, that should be a sign that I would like this fact to be acknowledged.

From reading all the wonderful reviews, I was really excited to try their food. And, of course I was not dissapointed! The service was EXCELLENT! The staff was very attentive and helpful. Our water glass always filled and bread basket always plentiful. They even folded my napkin when I went to the bathroom. Hubby and I both had the prefixed 3 course meal. I had the goat cheese napolean, fillet mignon, and warm chcolate cake. Hubby had the warm brie with potatoe thing, pork tenderloins, and fruit napoleon. We were so stuffed and happy!

I think it is better than ever!\nI remember my dad telling me how impressed he was that Chef Phillipe remembered his name and he had only dined there once before! The service is warm, friendly and spot on. The food Divine! It is  bit loud, but it didn't really matter, everything else was so perfect. I loved seeing, romantic couples, ladies night out and families,rare that a restaurant can appeal to all. Also, to the single, one star review ,you obviously do not understand what an Executive Chef does. If the Chef is doing his job,(and Chef Phillipe is) the line cooks, sous chef ,etc are the stars who execute your meal. The is no reason for the kitchen to fall apart when he isn't in it. I have worked in many restaurants and the other thing that struck me here, is that the staff love their jobs! They are equally as excited as Chef Phillipe about \"their\" restaurant. We have many good French restaurants in San Francisco and Chapeau is one of the best!", "author": "Cy M."}

Every detail of the food is perfection.  There is just an obvious feeling that every effort is made to create the best meal possible.  The owner must be difficult to work for!  And to top it off, the price of the food isn't jaw dropping and I didn't feel any pretension or snobbishness with the staff or the clientele.

But having been to Chapeau about 15 times over the years, I have to say that for the money, Chapeau has, hands down, the best French bistro experience.  Yes, it's out in the foggy sticks of the Richmond, and you'll be surrounded by hefty white haired matrons, but the food, especially the meats, which is Phillipe's forte, is on par with many of the much more expensive establishments downtown.  In French style, Phillipe is hugely gregarious and at first, it might seem a bit offputting.  But after a while, you realize that he's the real deal.  More than once he chased out after us to say goodbye, and he always has an excellent wine suggestion, no matter the price point.  For many it may not be worth the trip to the Richmond, but those that make it are rarely disappointed.  A perfect spot if you're headed back from the GG bridge, it's dark and foggy, and the hunger for a dry French champagne and crisp frites suddenly seems to rise inside of you.  Make a right on Clement and find Phillipe.  He'll welcome you and feed you well.", "author": "ed y."}

I tried sweatbreads appetizer because -why not it's a french place - the truffle sauce was amazing (even this scary 8 year old little girl at the next table was chowing it down)...but halfway through, thinking about what i'm actually eating, I had to pause.  the escargot had a bit too much bite from raw garlic, made it hard to finish.  i am seriously trying to think what my entree was.  our waiter, the french speaking one was rude, maybe part of the ambiance...but the other hostess (asian/manager/owner?) was definitely attentive to her tables.

It's SF, so you should expect wind & rain, followed by warm autumn days, followed by 4 mos. of fog during this time of year. Chapeau itself is a remarkable little place out in the Richmond district that reminds you why you should eat out more often. Remarkable because it's a tiny neighborhood bistro headed by a passionate chef/owner who greets every single one of the diners appreciatively and seems to have a loyal following in an area of the City that changes constantly. The dinner menu is French of course but with a hint of Cali. The basket of warm baguettes was constantly refilled, as were the water glasses. We did the prix fixe menu cuz that's just how we roll & cuz it's a tad cheaper. Appetizers consisted of a slightly sweet corn soup topped with crab meat and a sweetbread surrounded by mushrooms, slathered in its own perfect deep brown sauce. When asked how I wanted my salmon cooked, i hesitated 'cuz i've never been asked that before...pretty unusual, i thought. The pleasantly surprising smoky flavor won me over, but i think the cilantro pesto was unnecessary. I'm still trying to figure out whether the Lady enjoyed her monkfish (she seemed puzzled by the texture), although I'm guessing she did by the near empty plate. Loved the extensive drink menu and how they break it down price-wise for the wine bottles. The desserts (profiterolles and a tarte grand-mere) were the exclamation point to our meals. I can't say enough about the service, nor the food or even the place itself--I'll just have to keep coming back.", "author": "Chris C."}

Luckily we were there early on a Saturday evening, and got a teeny table. The decor in the restaurant is really homey and elegant, and it really makes the small cramped tables seem that much less cramped. The service was impeccable, and table settings spotless. My friend and I felt underdressed, but the waitstaff did not treat us any differently. We ordered an appetizer of sweetbreads and I got a cassoulet and my friend got the duck leg. The amuse bouche and the breads were very good. The sweetbreads were fantastic and I felt the entrees were good, but not mind-blowing. What really made this place shine was the service. We got a friendly and enthusiastic handshake from the chef, our check in a cute little hat, and after we left, halfway down the street, the chef came running after us. We turned around and wondered if we had left something at the table or didn't leave a big enough tip. All he wanted was to properly say goodbye, and gave us both two kisses on the cheeks! Such a wonderful surprise, leaving us smiling for the rest of the evening.", "author": "Joy C."}

With all the great reviews on yelp, I decided to make Chapeau next on the list for a bistro buzz.  Reservations are a must, and we went at 6:15 on a Friday evening.  We were nearly the first customers, and the place was freezing.  We kept our coats, and so did everyone else at the first seating.   The atmosphere is key to me when enjoying the comforts of bistro dining, and this is not what I had in mind.  It was not any one thing, but the combination of all of them - the super close tables, the rushed service, and the freezing temperature - made us want to get out of there as soon as we finished eating.  The food was ok - nothing special, but the main detraction was the service.  This was not the casual take your time kind of bistro service and staff I'm used to, but rather hyper tense rushed get to your table to take the plate before you've finished type.  I'm giving it 3 starts because the food was nothing to complain about either, but for a quiet, relaxing, bistro dinner, I would not recommend this place.  P.S.  The famous Philipe was nowhere to be found.", "author": "Leslie R."}

There are so many mid to upper level restaurants in San Francisco that don't seem to give a hoot about providing the customer with truly professional service. Chapeau is the exception! You feel welcome and taken care of from the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave. The menu is wonderful and I've literally never had a bad meal here. The other thing I noticed that was particularly impressive was that there were a few people eating alone at the bar. For some, especially women, the concept of eating alone in a Restaurant may be daunting, and to see that there were multiple women eating alone comfortably at the bar was impressive. The staff and the owner were considerate and attentive to everyone; their manners are impeccable, and in this day and age, that is something. You should not have to go to an inordinately expensive Restaurant to get professional service and a staff that takes making you happy seriously. If you're looking for a great meal at a reasonable price, served by a staff that is actually interested in your happiness, give Chapeau a try.", "author": "Kate M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-15", "description": "After reading many of the reviews I have been waiting for over a year to eat here.  I was preparing myself to meet and be greeted by Phillipe.  Upon entering the dining room it was very crowded with tables within arms distance of eachother as expected.  Phillipe came charging up to us and greeted us right away looking for a table.  We were seated next to the door and I was literally in front of it.  A dark curtain is placed in front of the door to prevent people from looking at you while eating.  But people would inadvertanly pull the curtain aside to come in and tap me on the shoulder.  They probably thought it was a soft couch pillow but that was my fatty back people.  Since there were 4 of us we decided to order the 3 dish create your own set menu.  For $38 it was a very good deal.  We ended up ordering different dishes so we could sample everything.  The onion soup and warm brie were very good.  I would definitely recommend getting the trio of salmon.  It was excellent.  We also ordered a large bowl of mussels for the table with pomme frittes.  In hind sight we were better off ordering 12 raw oysters.  The mussels weren't that great.  For dinner I had the bouillabaisse which had a really good flavor.  The manatee ended up trading her half eaten monk fish for my 3/4 eaten food.  I wasn't going to complain.  hahaha.  The monk fish was served with a creamy risotto which was on teh creamy side but very good.  The monk fish was overcooked, however.  It was on the chewy side.  But I still devoured it.  My sister and her manatee had the prime rib for 2.  It was served with bone morrow which I tried for the first time.  It was interesting to say the least.  But wasn't worth finishing because I don't need extra cholesterol.  The prime rib was pretty good but I think it was reheated.  It also cooled down fairly quickly.  It wasn't the best i've had in the city (No, I don't think House of Prime rib is good).  For dessert the Vanilla bean creme brulee is the winner here.  It is just as good if not better than Ruth Chris's cremem brulee which is the best I've ever eaten.  I am fat and trust me I have eaten my share of creme brulee.  The apple tart and chocolate cake were also very good.  The napoleon was given a twist served open face with the 3 piece of dough on top of the filling and fruit.  On the bottom of the plate was a basil concoction.  It made a very interesting combination that worked very well.  I was impressed.  Overall I ate alot of food because the manatee said I basically ate everyone's appetizer, entree and dessert.  As I am sitting here writing this review my stomach is currently resting on my lap.  Good food for a very reasonable price is Chapeau!.  I almost gave the place 4 stars because as we left I was waiting for Phillipe to come say bye but there was no sight of him.  Then all of a sudden he comes barging through the curtains and out the door to make out with my manatee and sister.  I wish he would have given me a kiss.

My choices were the corn soup with crab cake and white truffle oil (chef Philippe is a genius with soups!), mussels with fries (standard and broth slightly salty), the sweetbreads (rich and dark), and we as a table shared a bottle of La Follette Pinot Noir 2008 (so goood!!!), kir cocktails, and all the desserts expect for the sorbet trio  (that's 8 desserts for 7 people).

One of my favorite French bistros in all the various cities I've lived and one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.  The prix fixe menus are deals ($35 for 3-course that you pick and choose from the a la carte menu; there's also a 4-course).  Besides the delicious dishes, the personal attention of the proprietors, Philippe and Ellen Gardelle, throughout the meal add to the neighborhood feel of the restaurant.  For example, on a recent weekday night, there were 6 of us for a relatively late (8:30p) dinner (I made reservations a week in advance and only 5:45p or 8:30p or later were available).  The table was ready for us when we arrived and Philippe ushered us to it.  During the meal, one of the appetisers that arrived was not one we had ordered, so the waiter quickly went to correct the order but still left the original and said it was on the house (it was the absolutely delicious grilled tiger prawns and scallops).  Philippe also has the habit of trying the wines with you if you ask him to recommend something.  Talk about standing by your recommendations!  After the meal, Philippe bid us good-bye (yes, faire la bise to the ladies).  While Ron D.'s comment about the many waiters is true, I think it works for Chapeau (there doesn't seem to be confusion) and keeps the mood fluid, with someone always ready to fill a glass or answer questions.\r\nNotes: Definitely make reservations.  And the restaurant space, while bright and cozy, is small, tables are set close to each other, and typically full of people, so don't expect a lot of quiet.", "author": "Tom W."}

I found this restaurant to be below average to say the least for SF standards. First and foremost: Be patient. It took us two hours from arrival to departure. If you are expecting quick service, this is the wrong place for you.Arrival: Hostess had to triple check our reservation, seemed incredibly scattered / not focused. Took over 20minutes to be seated. Waiter: attentive - however - we had the specials on menu read twice by both hostess and waiter. Food: appetizers - we both had mussels. OK. Lots of mussels of miniscule size, however - tasty enough. Entree: I: steak. Her: chicken/sausage dish. My steak was tasty however, one step beyond TINY. No salad or baked potato that came with it. Too expensive for the small sized portion. Her: casserole: Just OK. Too salty, lukewarm and frankly overcooked. Not worth the price. Bottle of Wine: fantastic Desserts: Best part of meal. In particular: french toast and chocolate cake.

We've been dying to eat at Chapeau! and we finally had our chance and it's everything that the reviews say.  I read reviews raving about the food, but didn't look at the pics, so I was pretty amazed with the presentation of the food.  It was something I'd expect in some fancy and snooty joint in downtown somewhere, not in a small joint near where I usually go grocery shopping with other Chinese grandpas and grandmas.  Yeah, the place is small and noisy, but who cares when the food is this good?!  Best of all, the food is very reasonably priced and I'd agree with others, dare I say it?!? I'd actually pay more!!  Service was spot on (our waiter kept re-folding my wife's napkin when she would leave the table, making me feel like a bastard-husband-that-I-am).  And lastly, the owner, Philippe, is ridiculously friendly!!   I'm thinking that once in a while, guests walk outta the place and he must think to himself in French 'Ahh what the hell, I'm busy cooking this duck confit, I don't need to run out of the place one more time to shake their lousy hand'.  But he doesn't!!  We sat near the window and the guy ran after every guest that left his place.

We had eaten here once before about 3 years ago and really liked it.  Called and asked for a reservation and were told we could sit at the bar.  We took it and arrived about 30 minutes later (6:00 p.m. on a Sunday--place was packed).  We were promptly seated (only disappointment was a table for two was open the entire time we were there and it would have been nice to sit at a table).  My wife and I both ordered the 3 course Prix Fixe and a half bottle of a very good Zinfandel.  Before our meal arrived we were given samplers of a Cauliflower soup that was very good--nice touch to what would prove to be a great meal.  For my first course I had the Salade Landais which was a Frisee salad with Duck Confit and smoked duck and little potato chips.  It may have been the best salad I have ever eaten.  I didn't want it to end.  My wife had the Mesclun salad which featured Fried Camembert.  It too was outstanding.  For our main course, I had the Baby Poissin in an a delicious sauce with baby potatoes, onions, and mushrooms. This may have been the best chicken dish I have eaten. Nice portion and delicious.  My wife the Cassoulet with two different kinds of Sausage, Duck Confit, Cannelini beans and loved it.  Also a very good portion.  For dessert my wife had the Lemon Tart which she loved and I had the French Toast with Hazelnut Ice Cream and Caramel sauce.  This takes 15 minutes to prepare but worth the wait.  It was nice to rest a little and it was delicious.  Our waitress was the bartender who was very busy but still managed to pay attention to our needs.  She is an excellent bartender and took very good care of us.  In addition to how good the food was, the presentation of everything was really done well.  I really enjoyed this place three years ago but enjoyed it even more this time.  We will be back sooner than three years from now.", "author": "Wayne E."}

The food is perhaps not the best or the most sophisticated French food you might have in SF (we don't know yet, since we moved to SF not too long ago) but without a doubt it was excellent! The selection of wine is very good (we got an amazing bottle of Cahors) and the service is pretty good too. If you get the chance to chat a little with Chef-owner Philippe Gardelle, you will soon realize that he's really passionate about his work.  You will for sure appreciate that monsieur Gardelle also deeply cares about his customers, greeting everyone coming in, and running after people in the streets to say goodbye. The only 2 things I did not like too much are the so-so interior decoration and the loudness of the room (even if it is relatively small).

Service was great, you are greeted by the owner personally, which has never happened to me at any other restaurant in the city. (the owner even walks you out the door when you leave and kisses the ladies on the cheek for a genuine euro goodbye) Only gripe is the fact that they try to fit 50 tables in the size of an average living room, so yeah, you almost are rubbing shoulders with the other patrons and feel like they can hear everything you are saying.

Philippe greets you as you enter and makes you feel like you are part of the family the whole time.  They do not rush you at all and when we left around 10:30pm, people were still talking amongst themselves, which reminds me so much of restaurants in Europe.  I started with the corn soup, it was amazing, although very creamy so it was a little filling.  We also had the salmon which was very tender, nothing special though.  I had the Salmon as a main dish and my friend had the Halibut.  The Salmon was cooked perfectly but I think the sauce it came with was a little overpowering, but a fine dish overall.  The Halibut was definitely better with the sauce  perfectly matching the delicate flavors of the fish.  We ordered a bottle of Chateneuf-du-Pape from Grenache grapes which he highly recommended (it was around $70) but we wanted to splurge.  It was truly amazing, very balanced and fruity, I definitely recommend it.  For dessert we had the apple tart which was very good and also the Creme Brule which was amazing, highly recommend it.

My friend and I went last week and we thought it was alright. They do maximize the little space they are given which causes the place to be very packly tight and loud. We decided to go for the 3 course $39 package but in retrospect, I would have just paid for each part individually since I ended up having the onion soup (one of the less expensive first course options), then I had the osso buco with noodles, and then the orange soup for dessert. The onion soup was good, I was worried, since it was French, that it would be salty but it was great. Next was the osso buco - it was good, but I have had better. It was very salty, too. My friend had the bouillabaisse and it was very very salty! We almost couldn't eat our main courses due to the salt but since we didn't want to be rude, we plowed onto dessert. The only shining moment for my friend from the meal was when her Profiterolles came. She inhaled them! I decided to go lighter and had the orange soup concoction. It was ok, interesting at best. The orange soup in the martini glass would have been fine but it had some odd green mint jelly at the bottom which ruined the orange for me. It did come with a side of orange souffle of some sort which was good. When we left our meal, knowing we weren't coming back anytime soon and needing to drink a lot of water afterwards to quench our thirsts, the chef/owner came running down the street after us to hug and kiss us goodbye, that was a nice touch.", "author": "Vivian L."}

A woman peeked in, asked for details and told us to wait  in that claustrophobic, dark space. After a few minutes in pitch dark we ventured in and were ordered to go stand in the back of the small room, next to the two bathrooms and the table where uncorking bottles is done. There, everybody going into the kitchen or the bathrooms had the opportunity to bump into us. In the meantime, the rest of our party  had come and finally we were shown to a window table where two could have chairs and two could sit on the window sill with drafty winds and the narrow ledge adding to the discomfort. But you want to know about the food. OK, it's reasonably priced and some of it is good. You can have three and four course menus. The wine list is nice and they have half glasses so you can mix and match. I had a lovely smoked trout salad, a pedestrian black cod and a trio of  sorbets. My table-mates liked their oysters and lamb. The service is sometimes inattentive and sometimes incomprehensible. My dessert wine tasted like it had probably been in an open bottle since its vintage year (2003).\nWhen we were leaving we asked to have a cab called and were told to go down to Geary Street where we could catch a cab.\nTo sum - the good food is dwarfed by the discomfort of seating, the overcrowding  and the uneven service.

The food is just as tasty as Chapeau and that makes sense since the head chef manages both.  The  pluses was that Clementine was less crowded (there was actually space between the tables) resulting in less noise as well as less of a wait for food.  The minus is that it is a bit more costly.  So if you don't mind the noise level and wait, then Chapeau is more bang for your buck but be aware that I heard Chapeau's menu will or has changed so check for the new price.  If you enjoy Chapeaus food and just prefer something less crowded and don't mind paying a little more for it, then Clementine is your choice. Either way, you can't go wrong. Both places serve very delicious French food at a price extremely lower than French Laundry and the staff are very professional and provide great service and the owners are very sweet people.", "author": "Happiness S."}

Tonight I went to Chapeau! looking forward to delicious french food like I normally have had in the past. Instead of enjoying my meal in peace and quiet, my partner and I were confront with a very noisy child with his parents and grandparents next to us. While I think some restaurants are appropriate for kids, this one is certainly not one of them. If I am paying $$$ for a meal, I expect my meal to be delicious, services well attended to and quiet. I do not expect to be entertained by a loud shrill of a child especially at a french restaurant. I complained to the waiter at first but I could tell that he did not take me serious enough so I made my second complaint to the maitre d'. She told me that there was nothing she could do about it. Well actually there is.... she could either ask the parents to do something about their noisy child or as their yelp ad says remind the parents that their restaurant is not appropriate for kids. Sorry to say but it will be awhile before I come back to eat after this experience.", "author": "Jesse N."}

We don't go to Nor Cal very often and decided to get away for a little... This place was a little hard to find, parking wasn't easy as it is on a street that has small little shops in a neighborhood of homes... We ended parking around the corner in front of a house after circling around for a while. Walking up to the restaurant you can only tell it is there if you see all the people sitting and eating... It is a small little bistro. We walked over and the hostess open the door for us... As soon as we stepped in she greeted us as the owner walked over to greet us too... They searched for our reservation but could not find it, I guess the new person said we canceled when we didn't =/ but the owner was so nice to us that we didn't care. We sat next to a older couple celebrating their anniversary... the spacing is a little close between tables but we didn't mind. We ordered the Rib-eye for Two on the BONE...

When my dining companion's onion soup was so hot that he was waiting for it to cool while I nibbled my way through my starter, the waiter checked in to make sure there wasn't something wrong with the soup. Too few waiters take the time to do small things like this, but it creates a memorable dining experience. The chef/owner greets diners on their arrival, and will job down the sidewalk a bit to bid you farewell.

I realize that the space is small and they want to fit as many people in as possible.  But when I go out, it's not only for the food, but also for the ambiance, and this one just didn't cut it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-07-21", "description": "I was sorely disappointed in our dining experience at Chapeau! I picked the restaurant based on several people I knew who loved it, as well as on yelp reviews. The service was abysmal. We must have been waited on by three servers--I have no idea who our actual waitperson was. Of course, no one introduced themselves, so I really had no clue. I usually don't drink a lot of water when I'm at dinner, but I did this night since it was so warm in the restaurant. There were three times I went to grab my glass of water and it was empty. We spent half the time waiting--waiting to hear specials, waiting to get our first glasses of water, waiting to get wine suggestions, waiting to have our order taken, waiting for the check. I think we could have been in and out of there in half the time. My dish was horrible. I ordered what I was hoping was Chapeau's signature dish--the cassoulet. It came out dry as if it had been sitting under a warming lamp for 30 minutes (which would not have surprised me). As we began to eat, I heard no \"oh-my-gosh, this is great!\" comments nor did I hear any \"mmmms\". For dessert, the blueberry pastry with creme anglaise tasted like Yoplait blueberry yogurt. The warm chocolate dessert was well-received by those in the party who ordered it. Actually that was the first food-related \"ooh-aah\" I heard. The best parts of the dinner were the wine that was eventually recommended to us--a Condreau and the decaf cappuccino. The one nice service touch was that one of the waiters went up to Geary to get us a taxi. He would not take a tip and simply asked us to come back again. I wish I could because of his kindness, but that won't be enough for me to return. This was a special occasion since it was the bachelorette party weekend for a good friend of mine. In the end, I was actually embarrassed that I picked this restaurant.", "author": "Sunny R."}

We and another couple have been out trying new, highly touted restaurants--with positive--but not knock-your-socks-off results.  So maybe older is better? Chapeau! is a multi-star gem, and I have already booked a table for the return trip. While the place looks like it could be stuffy, the staff, though formal enough, couldn't be friendlier.  They strike an unusual balance between creating a special atmosphere, while putting you at ease and offering advice and knowledge about the food and wine. Chef Philippe Gardell\nclearly enjoys working the front of the house, from his personal welcome to each guest, to pouring the wine, to his final au revoir at the door. And all of this wonderful ambiance is enhanced by the food. A delicate corn soup with crab, a baked brie, goat cheese galette, heirloom tomatoe salade, were among the flavorful starters. Though the menu is based in classical french cooking, it is lightened and freshened with subtle flavors. The duck breast was moist and tender, the bacon-wrapped pork loin was mouthwatering and the vegeterian terrine sparkling with lively tomatoe, corn, and several other crisp tastes.  Two of us had the 3 course menu ($38)--so that we shared two deserts--which featured the warm chocolate cake with rum raisin ice cream and caramel. That about put us over the top for this rich evening.  Each portion was more than adequate, and we all considered this a great value.  They also have a terrific wine list that highlights good choices under $30.  I can't wait to try it again.", "author": "Valerie T."}

I have eaten at many fancy (and expensive) restaurants in the city but my experience here was truly one to remember. The place was packed at 6:15pm which was a recommendation in itself. The food was absolutely delicious, from the tomato bisque with crab cake as an appetizer to the salmon as my entree. Beautifully prepared and presented and a joy to eat. One could imagine Julia Child, conducting a fine orchestra of chefs from her place in heaven, with a smile on her face. Chef Philippe (and owner?) came out and greeted every guest personally and this was impressive in itself and a nice touch. My dessert of choice was a pistachio (mousse?) which was easy on the palette and not too heavy in consistency. My companions were similarly delighted with their choices and they had a sorbet to finish which I tried. As much as I enjoyed my dessert, I shall definitely select the sorbet on my next visit, for I shall return. It is slightly on the expensive side but worth every dollar. My only grumble is that it is a bit cramped in that the tables are very close together. Perhaps this is the traditional way in French restaurants but it was a squeeze for the waiters and a little cramped for myself and my companions. A small penance to pay for perfection though and Chef Philippe you are to be commended for a truly wonderful culinary experience.", "author": "mary f."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-06-23", "description": "We arrived promptly for a 545 reservation.  Even though I had requested the window table over two weeks in advance, we were not seated in the window table... but not a big deal as it was not yet busy.  We were seated right away by Philippe's wife and provided menus.   Offered an aperitif, we declined but requested a wine list.  I noted the time because I remarked at how quickly we were able to get across town.  At 10 minutes of waiting with no wine list, and no acknowledgement from anyone my wife and I began to discuss where we would go as we were about to walk out.  It was a Saturday evening, so prospects of finding another place to dine were not promising.  We decided to wait it out and pay attention to the rest of the evening.  8 minutes later... a full 18 minutes after being seated, we were handed a wine list.  It might be better to describe as \"thrown\" a wine list because it was shoved in my face as the person providing it did not even stop.  Gone are the days when Philippe would ask a few questions about what I like and point out some of his favorite finds that would suit my taste.  Instead, one has to sift through the puzzle of mostly little known, French offerings.  The wine list was great when it came with a Frenchman who would help decipher it - but its utterly useless without the personal touch.  I found a decent wine nonetheless.  More minutes passed.  Finally - at about 30 minutes after our arrival, a wait person approached us and presented the specials for the evening.  After barely uttering the last word he quickly turned away from the table not even noticing that I had a wine list in my hand.... I had to insist \"excuse me, I'd like to order some wine!\"   The wait person said \"uh.. oh, okay.\" And then took the order and left.  More time passed and we were going on 40 minutes with no wine, no bread, no food order placed.  Thank goodness for the bus staff who regularly filled our water.   At about 45 minutes into the ordeal, our food order was taken.  Once the food order was taken, the bus staff promptly delivered bread.   After the bread,  our wine showed up about 5 minutes later.   It was another 10 minutes for our appetizers to arrive.  The appetizers were excellent - well prepared, well presented and delicious.  We ordered the 4 course menu, so our \"fish course\" which is basically a scallop - was next to arrive.   Our appetizers dishes lingered on the table... hmmm, the bus staff had been good up until now - but they seem to excel at water pouring and bread delivery and fail at dirty dish recovery.   The gap in time from when we finished our appetizers until the scallop arrived was about 15 minutes which feels more like an hour.  My wife and I joked that we felt like we were sitting in Hell's Kitchen during a point where someone got kicked off the fish station.   Once the scallop arrived, it was excellent.   Another big gap before the entrees - perhaps 10-12 minutes from when we finished the scallop before the entrees arrived.  My wife's entree, the Lamb Shank was excellent.  My entree, the Filet Rossini special was ok.  The foie gras was excellent - but far too small to warrant the $15 up charge on the prix fix menu.  The filet was not cooked as ordered.  The waiter asked if \"medium rare was okay?\"  I said, I wanted it more medium - hot and pink vs. warm and red.   It was served rare to medium rare nonetheless.  I couldn't bear waiting the projected amount of time it would take to fix it and no one ever came by to see how the food was, so I ate it was it was served.  Also, the filet has stringy tendon running through one edge.  This is the kind of thing that should have been trimmed out before cooking... very sloppy meat prep.  The rest of the dish was excellent.   Another loooong wait before we were thrown desert menus.   I normally would have ordered desert wine but by now we were approaching 2 1/2+ hours and I couldn't wait to get out of the place - especially since next to us at the extremely close tables were seated a loud nose blower and his overweight, over perfumed wife.   We ordered our desert.  10 minutes to get desert - and then the most maddening was the 10 minutes to get the check.  At this point - 3 hours into the ordeal - I felt an almost panicked need to escape.   My wife and I speculated as to how this place had gone downhill so quickly.  Philippe is now spending his time at Clementine.  I think that he served the role of \"uber-waiter\"... I think he noticed every dirty plate, every gap in service, every empty water glass, every concerned look on a guest's face and then provided the orders to the proper person to take care of the situation.  Without him there, the service is amateurish at best.  The long pauses are inexcusable.  The food is great and in the days of prompt service, the loud, cramped dining room was not such a bother.  But with snail-like service, the confines of the overstuffed dining room unbearable prison that one wants to escape.  We will never go back.", "author": "R Y."}
