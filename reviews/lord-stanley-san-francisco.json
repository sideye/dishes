All 5 of us agreed that it was a pretty disappointing meal. We opted for the tasting menu which was $97 and consisted of 3 appetizers, 2 main dishes and 2 desserts. \n\nThe service was amazing and they were very accommodating but every single dish was pretty much bland or wasn't appealing for all 5 of us. At first I thought it was just me, but after our meal was over, we all admitted we didn't enjoy our meal one bit and were surprised that it has a Michelin Star. Maybe we went on an off day, I hope? But hopefully everyone else has a more enjoyable experience! This review was based on my visit 12/5/17 so their food may have changed for the better!", "author": "Valerie T."}

Overall there were just too many misses for us to be satisfied. \n\nThe place is small - So when we arrived 15min early, they had no place for us to go. We were directed towards the bar, which was just a serving station. Tables were set up adjacent to this station, so we felt like we were definitely intruding on other diners. I definitely would have been annoyed if I were them - it wasn't our fault but it made us uncomfortable. \n\nNow the food:\n\n* Bread and butter. The bread was awesome - we definitely could have had more.\n* Poached Oysters with Red Lettuce: flavor was good, but the birthday boy's serving had a shard of shell. He later told me he didn't complain because it was the first dish and wanted to give them a chance and not be identified as 'that' table. \n* Warm Green Cabbage: the entire table was surprised at how good this was!\n* Confit Foie Gras: the whole table went for the supplement and no one thought it was worth it. The plate had more other stuff than foie gras and the other diners commented that it did not taste like foie enough. Also too sweet, the bread served with it as well as the dish itself was sweet. This was the sweetest thing we ate all night - even more than dessert. \n*  Cured Black Cod: this was a highlight of the meal. Very flavorful, the broth was like a Thai curry - definitely a table favorite. \n* Roasted Black Mission Figs: Absolutely flavorless! I had bites out of both pieces just to make sure. A couple of people did not finish this dish. It was clear the table did not like it and was also the first and only time the wait staff did not ask how we liked it. \n* Barbecued Wagyu Beef: this dish was also a table favorite. The beef was like butter and the sauce was just right. So good that I ate it slower to savor it. \n* White Peach Sorbet with Cappelletti Spritz: mixed bag reactions. Some loved it, but thought it would have been better as a refresher. I thought the combo tasted like cough syrup l, but others loved it. \n* Red Tea and Honey Custard with Plum and Milk Crumb: this was good but ruined by the milk crumb which no one liked. I don't know why milk crumbs are so in right now, but it just tastes like crunchy powdered milk (i.e. like what I imagine old baby formula to taste like). \n\nThe meal ended with some canel\u00e9s and chocolate caramels. The canel\u00e9s were crunchy on he outside and custardy in the middle and the caramels were perfectly delicious! I could have had another plate of this for dessert!\n\nOne thing to note is that we did get the wine pairings and that was also a mixed success/fail rate. The worst was the pairing with the figs, but I can't fault the wine as I don't think anything would have made that dish better except for actually ripe figs. The pairing with the foie showed that you can make a lackluster dish taste better with wine. I would have preferred if we were told why the wines were paired vs just telling us what the wines were.", "author": "Angelito R."}

I didn't feel greasy on my palate at all in whole meal. All dishes met a high standard as a Michelin star restaurant. I love their philosophy of healthy food. Chef Rupert and Carrie deserve their reputation. Definitely I will return to their restaurant when I come to San Francisco next time.

Receptionist (who also served as waiter sometimes) didn't smile or welcome and went straight to business \"what's your reservation?\" Instead of a table, we ended up at the communal table! I was taking my dad out for his birthday, not exactly the best seating arrangement if you want an intimate dinner. It was also very noisy with its high ceiling.\n\nDid the tasting menu, and it was not impressive. Wrong word choice, it was disappointing. Food was never warm enough or flavorful enough. The ingredients were nothing special and I suppose the wagyu beef is what justified the $105 price tag. However, beef was chewy and you really have to use some muscle to slice it. Didn't leave hungry but I also wouldn't mind going down the street to get a couple of tacos. \n\nThe next party at the communal table had the regular menu, and it seems like portion is much more reasonable. \n\nGiven today's experience, I can't say I would even give it another shot to try the regular menu.", "author": "Jennifer T."}

I hope the latter, as Wikipedia tells me \"a man of considerable acumen, and probably the most successful power-broker of his age.\"\n\nSuccess is such an appetite aphrodisiac. I wish we knew the story behind why this minimal, stark, One Michelin star restaurant touted as Bon Appetit's  Top 3 new restaurants in the US is called Lord Stanley and why this is important to the owners/chef. So many lords! Why this one? \n\nOn to the food and ambiance. For me, the struggling calorie conscious body dysmorphic hedonist (don't you want to invite me to your next dinner party? I forgot to mention neurotic and charming) ....the highlight was was the warm green cabbage with house buttermilk and uni bottarga. I know, with all things considered, my favorite plate was a salad? Yes - It was unbelievably savory with a dill sauce and medley of flavor, which theoretically is hard to accomplish without dumping tons of toppings and dressing on the greens. This was ordered a la carte off the tasting menu! I really appreciate the flexibility and ability to customize the meal, which makes this the anti-Michelin experience but one which I hope becomes more of the norm as discretionary income in the Bay area goes waaay down and epicurean hunger goes waaay up. I also really liked the Brooklyn sourced Uncouth Vermouth. \n\nFor my companion, he had a glass of the Bobinet \"Ruben\" 2016, Cabernet Franc and ordered 2 bottles off the internet for his home collection before the check came. He loved it. Part of fine dining is finding exquisite wines and creative cooking so you can replicate at home for a fraction of the cost. His $14 glass of wine came from a $25 bottle. Bon appetit! \n\nOther highlights included: Bread. So chewy. The cod was superior to others in the Bay Area, including the hyped up Saratoga. Service was good and willing to accommodate mixing and matching off the ala carte and tasting menus, as mentioned. Also, there was a steady stream of cute girls walking behind me, which I didn't see, but my companion happily reported and deduced, \"great neighborhood\". \n\nThus, the MOST important effect of the Lord Stanley experience is the hallucinatory superpowers. \n\nFour stars for now, will reserve the five star for the full tasting menu.", "author": "Spartevan V."}

From the ambiance to service and the food itself, it was a wonderful experience. \n\nGiven it was a Wednesday, I decided to pick from the a la Carte menu to try and keep things a bit lighter mid week. Per yelp suggestions we decided to start with the onion petals, and salt cod beignets. Both were outstanding and great small bites before \"diving\" into the scallop. See how I did that? ;) The scallop was easily one of the best I've had and cooked to perfection. Seared in one side, and served in a heavenly sauce. Don't miss that order. My main was the pork ribs which I normally wouldn't select at a one Michelin Star spot but, im glad I did. Tender, fall off the bone and perfectly rendered fat.

The food that is being prepared here is on par with the $400 per person pre-fix restaurants in the Bay Area, served in a casual but stylish setting. The service is 5-star, the menu is relatively small, but covers everything you could ask for, save for maybe something green and leafy. The wine list is maybe the most well procured in the city, it is a short, reasonably priced list with some less common, but amazing bottles to try, no novel of common cabs here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-20", "description": "Unfortunately a disappointment for a birthday dinner with my date.  Ambiance and service was nice, but food was mediocre / small / makes me think it isn't quite to Michelin Star level.  Maybe I'm nit-picking b/c it was a birthday, but I almost felt bad for taking my date here.\n\nVenue / Service: surprised how many people they fit into the space; slightly cramped for me but not the worse I've seen.  Nice minimal decor and romantic lighting.  It did seem to be a bit slow in the kitchen that day since we had to wait 15 min from our reservation time before sitting down and food overall was coming out a bit on the slow side, considering how small the dishes were (see below).  Otherwise, the staff were pretty nice- they remembered I had called asking a birthday question and so our menus had a birthday message for my date!\n\nFood: overall, not terrible but I feel like I've had better quality Michelin Star meals than this.  Also doesn't help that portions were on the smaller side.  \n-- Grilled Trumpet Mushrooms with Miso-Yam Dip ($7) - interesting combo of the miso with yams, perhaps one that I am ok not revisiting.  Mushrooms were a bit on the oily side and were slightly limp when you picked it up with a fork but otherwise tasted good.  In fact, we mainly ate the mushrooms without the dip.\n\n-- Onion Petals and Sherry Vinegar ($5) - people had raved about this dish, but unfortunately was a miss for us.  Texture was slightly off-putting- our petals were a bit on the soft side so overall ate very mushy and heavy on the palette.  We both had one bite and didn't want to eat any more(and my date usually hates leaving food uneaten).  \n\n-- Razor Clams with Vinaigrette (price unknown per clam) - at least this appetizer made up for the onion petals a bit!  Love the refreshing sweet-sour flavors from the sweet razor clams and the vinaigrette, and the slightly chewy / crunchy texture of the clams made the dish even more interesting.  Only wish we could have had more of it!\n\n-- Pan Fried Scallop w/ Candied Parsnip, Beurre Blanc and Vegetable Jus ($18) - we asked to split this, and didn't realize it only included one scallop (so they served each of us half a scallop).  Feel like most places would give 2 scallops for an appetizer at least, so we were slightly disappointed with the portion size.  Scallop itself was nicely cooked, but wasn't a fan of the beurre blanc since it made the dish overall feel a bit heavy and rich.\n\n-- Seared Monkfish w/ Mushroom Broth, Black Trumpets and Cauliflower ($34) - another favorite of the night!  Monkfish was well cooked- not overcooked and not mushy like some places had served before.  The monkfish worked well with the earthy broth and black trumpets!  Again, wish I could have had more.\n\nMy date ordered the Roasted Lamb Chop and Belly with Carrot Tart, Min and Lamb Jus ($36) and they only serve one measly chop.  My date, who loves lamb, felt a little jipped, even though it was tasty (but not mind-blowingly so).  I even thought that we should have ordered a second portion for him to fill him up.\n\nBecause of all of this, we decided to skip dessert and ended up leaving and grabbed fish tacos somewhere else, which made the night so much better.\n\nAll in all, maybe it was a busy night or something, but we both felt the quality / quantity wasn't quite there.  Perhaps we should have ordered more dishes, but unfortunately this Michelin Star was a miss for me... and that's a first.", "author": "Audrey H."}

The best part about this Michelin Star restaurant was the customer service. From the moment we stumbled into Lord Stanley from having one too many drinks, the wait staff was super patient and accommodating, making sure we reached our reserved table without falling on our faces.\n\nWe decided on the tasting menu for dinner, and everything sounded amazing. We were served each dish with much care and without any rush so we could savor every bite. This is what we had for the table:\n\n* Onion petals with sherry vinegar\n* Gouda puffs with piccalilli\n* Salted cod beignets with tartar sauce\n\nMy favorite item was the onion petals! So simple yet so savory. Each shared plate was a little different in terms of texture and flavor. Obviously very well-thought out.\n\nFor my starter, I picked the scallop with leek, beurre blanc, and poultry jus. Delicious! I love the complementary flavors of the dish. For my entree, I couldn't turn down the monkfish with vegetables and red wine jus. The presentation of vegetables in a cabbage roll was unique. Not my favorite, as it dominated the monkfish, but well-prepared nonetheless.\n\nBetween all of us at the table, we tried each dessert on the tasting menu. Originally, I had ordered the banana pudding with dark chocolate sorbet and hazelnut brittle, but they brought the \"mont blanc\" tart to me instead, which I realized a few bites in. They were great about bringing me the correct dessert. In the end, most of the dessert at the table was untouched.\n\nThe shared plates were personally the highlight of the meal for me. And of course the customer service, since we were celebrating a special occasion. It's a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a date or celebration. I wouldn't have pegged Lord Stanley as a Michelin Star restaurant just from having this meal, but I still think it was 4 Yelp stars on my scale regardless.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

Lord Stanley is located on the corner of Polk and Broadway.\n\nI thought the decor would be a little different with a name like Lord Stanley but the ambiance was cozy with dim lighting and tables not too close to each other.  \n\nWe decided on the 8 course tasting menu.They brought out delicious bread that was warm inside with a crunchy crust. \n\nTasting Menu\n\nPoached oyster with dungeness crab, daikon radish, perilla and sesame: This came in a rice wonton like wrapper, it seemed a little bland to me. I didn't taste too much of the dungeness crab but I liked the texture of the daikon radish and perilla herb.\n\nWarm cabbage, house buttermilk and uni bottarga: I enjoyed this. The warm cabbage was crunchy and creamy and the uni bottarga added some savory flavor to it. \n\nHen consomme with confit yolk, black trumpets and barley: This reminded me of a Chinese soup that my Mom used to make. The black trumpets reminded me of the wood ear mushrooms and it was yummy with the confit yolk. This was a definite comfort food dish for me. \n\nSeared halibut with puntarelle, almonds and curry:  Halibut was seared to perfection and the puntarelle and almonds provided a good contrast. Curry was barely detectable but didn't take away from the halibut flavor. \n\nWagyu sirloin with yukon gold, porcini and red wine jus: I wish I could say this was my favorite dish but it wasn't. Temperature wise, the sirloin seemed like it sat under the lamp for a little bit too long and it was not as hot as I would like it. Normally I would have sent this back but we were in a hurry (we had to go home and pack for our trip). The red wine jus was good as any red wine reduction. \n\nPear sorbet with a cider float: This to me was a palate cleanser which was nice with the cider. \n\n\"Mont Blanc\" tart with nutmeg custard, chestnut and madeira ice cream: I really liked this dessert because it was not too sweet. The pureed chestnuts were an accent to the nutmeg custard and had little dollops of whipped cream. \n\nMacarons and chocolate: I put in our reservations that it was our anniversary and they had a candle with this dish. This was an extra dish that was not included in the tasting menu. \n\nService was attentive and unintrusive. I feel that with a Michelin star that maybe our meal would have been a little bit better....maybe I went on an off night?

Our server was super knowledgable about wines, very friendly and attentive. I also was poundinggggg water and the filled it up constantly. \n\nThe other thing that put the service over the top, was that my boyfriend joined us at the end of the meal and they not only let him pull up a chair, (It's a very small space, so not a ton of extra seating) but also included him in the complimentary after-dinner fudge pieces they served us. \n\nThe food however, was really hit or miss. Some dishes were really tasty and innovative and others really felt confused. \n\nAs many of the other reviews have said, the portion sizes are pretty small. We got two snacks, one starter, two entrees, and a dessert between the two of us, and I didn't leave feeling full. \n\nWe ended up ordering: \n\nAged Gouda Puffs (snack)--I *think* they were delicious but there were also smaller than bite-sized. I would skip these and also don't really remember anything about them other than the size.\n\nSalt Cod Beignets with Tartar Sauce (snack)--This is a must-order. Perfectly fried and savory, we also dipped our remaining table bread into the tartar sauce until the bowl was clean. \n\nScallop and White Onion (starter)--This dish was one that seemed confused and also wasn't the best looking dish. (Everything on the plate is dark green, cream, or brown,) We were served four thin scallops on top of an pretty large onion slice, with some brown seaweed on top. (They market this as \"mermaid's hair.\") I thought it was OK, but would not order this again. Overall, our consensus was that the scallops were not that exciting... They were just sort of served as cooked scallops, not seared or anything. \n\nBlack Cod with Green Cabbage and peas (Main)--The mains were the best part of the meal, in my opinion. They were cooked the best, tasted the best, and looked the best. I loved the curry sauce they served the fish in, and the peas were tasty and colorful. \n\nLamb Chop and Belly with Roasted Potatoes--This was by far my favorite thing we ordered. I'd never have lamb belly before, and they did this so, so well. My friend described it as, \"Like pork belly, but wayyyy danker.\" If you come to Lord Stanley, I would go as far to say, this is the one thing you should not miss eating. \n\nRed Berry Eaton Mess with Ice-Cream and Verjus--MAN was this dessert confused and dare I say--was kind of a mess. I'd never eaten a dessert that had more going on and it definitely did not need to. There were berries, there was ice-cream, there were little jello pieces, and to top it all over there were these freeze-dried pieces of pink, fruit slabs... the only way I can describe them is they looked like and had the consistency of styrofoam you would use for home construction. \n\nThe dessert looked really pretty but, whoa, so much going on and did not really taste good. \n\nI really enjoyed my time at Lord Stanley because our server was fun and the service was so good. However, the food was very up and down, and coupled with the Michelin Star price tag, I don't think I would come back.", "author": "Liz S."}

Warm cabbage, house buttermilk and uni bottarga - this was a real stand-out in the meal\n(3).

I really appreciate the ability to elevate a simple ingredient such as a humble cabbage.

I'll break this down one-by-one from the a la carte menu:\n\nOnion Petals, $5: the only item that's been on the menu throughout its 2+ years of existence. These were INCREDIBLE. Everything from the crunchy vs. silky texture juxtaposition, to the freshness of the onions and the tantalizing tang of the sherry cream, it was all mouthwatering. ***Don't miss out on these.***\n\nOlives, $6: really potent smoky flavor - very unique - would recommend if sharing with at least 4 people, as you'll only need a few each.\n\nPan-seared scallop, $18: probably the best scallop I've ever had. This one from was Cape Cod, and it was cooked to perfection.\n\nLocal Halibut (from Monterey), $35: This was the only dish I was very disappointed with. It was definitely overpriced by about $15-20, and despite its really awesome delicate texture, it lacked flavor and the accompaniments did not complement it well.\n\nHeritage Hen, $35: By far the best thing on the menu. Where to begin, wow this was an amazing dish. From the presentation, to the layers and layers of taste, texture, surprises, etc. The hen jus, the small button mushrooms, and the picture-perfect potato galette underneath all contributed to the majesty that is the Lord Stanley Heritage Hen.\n\nHoney-glazed Tomato, $12 (dessert): This was also fantastic. Have you ever had a sweet (but still savory) version of a sun-dried tomato? I hadn't. Oh, but wait, the tomato still oozes out warm juice from the inside upon biting into it! All with a creme fra\u00eeche ice cream and a br\u00fbl\u00e9e of poppyseed to give it a beautiful appearance, this was one of the most unique and satisfying desserts I've had in a long time.\n\nThank you Melanie, Catherine, Chef Rupert, and others for the amazing experience!

While I did enjoy some of the dishes, others were a bit underwhelming. \n\nI shall start with the two main dishes - pork rib and wagyu sirloin. I liked the fact that my pork rib was grilled 20 hours on that piece of Nasturtium leaf, such that it carried a subtle grassy scent; yet it was on the greasy side that I found quite tough to finish. Wagyu sirloin, on the other hand, was overcooked (especially the skin portion) and difficult to cut into pieces. Probably I should have tried something else?\n\nStarters - oyster, cabbage and charred avocado. I did enjoy that warm cabbage, with the help of the light touch of house buttermilk; however the other two failed to deliver. That chilled dashi did not go well with that poached oyster, making the combination weird to the least. Avocado was one of my favorite food, yet I certainly expect more when I'm swallowing it in a well-established Michelin star restaurant, other than having it charred. \n\nDesserts - strawberry sorbet and frozen peach. Like and dislike. That strawberry was the star of the night, floating on the sparkling rose, and carried a refreshing flavor. A nice way to end my courses. Frozen peach with arborio rice underneath, hmm acceptable.\n\nOverall speaking, many of the ingredients used were of high quality; yet the execution seems falling apart. I did not see sophisticated techniques, or thoughts being added to the dish. I was expecting a lot more than what I had observed and tasted. \n\nVery attentive service, that added credit.

I happen to be an \"ehh\" guest.\n\nSo, first off, I was kinda disappointed that I got sat upstairs at a communal table when I had a reservation. I was also seated a bit later than the reservation time since tables were not available. This meant, I stood around at the small bar in a small restaurant scooting here and there to get out of the waiters' way. To be clear, I don't want or expect to sit at a communal table when I have a reservation - so tip for you, make sure to write a note in your reservation if you don't want to be seated at the communal table. \n\nReally quickly, decor can be described as minimalist, maybe chic, but mostly minimalist.\n\nAnyway, service was ridiculously slow. My meal among three friends took over two hours, maybe 2.5 hours and we had a few apps, a couple entrees and a couple desserts. We sat there waiting and waiting for a few dishes to come out - I guess the upstairs communal table gets somewhat neglected. \n\nFood wise, I expected more. \n-The popular onion petals were so ehh, delicate, but ehh.\n-Gouda puffs were yummy. \n-Scallops were yummy. I did not like the side serving of candied parsnip (omg, I was horrified when I tried it). \n-Pork ribs were 80% fat on my piece and nothing special taste wise. \n-The monk fish was so-so according to my friends (I do not eat fish).\n-Strawberries with rice pudding sounds better than it tastes.\n\nI think that Lord Stanley attempts to add uniqueness to ordinary dishes (which most restaurants attempt to do these days), but they don't really do a good job because those unique flavors ruined many dishes for me. I'm far from a food tasting expert and it's possible that I just don't get some Michelin Star restaurants and their superb dishes, but this is my opinion.

Chef Rupert is as charming as his food :)\n\nWe did the special valentines day 8 course vegetarian tasting menu. Started with aged gouda puffs- OMg just lets in your mouth so freaking good. Followed by Kolrabi and citrus salad with creme fraiche. The colors on the plate were beautiful and the coriander and fennel elevated the dish to the next level. Our star of was charred leak with salsify almonds and curry. We tried each component separate and then together. When together, every and every element balanced the dish and played a symphony of beautiful textures and flavors in your mouth. Just wonderful! One of the other dishes we liked was the mushroom brothe with egg yolk. The yolk was the best yolk i have ever had in my life. perfect cook, buttery and perfect textured. Our desserts included apple and fennel sorbet, perfect tartiness and really rich chocolate tart, which was great. We had herbal tea and ended our amazing meal while chatting with the chef.\n\nAlso, remember, restaurant is really intimate and small and seats very few people at one time. They have a few tables and a large communal table at the top. As a result of which, we had to wait a really long time to get to our table despite a reservation and then some longer to get our food. They were sincerely apologetic though, and very very nice, so I guess its ok! No big deal!\n\nFantastic meal over all!", "author": "Megha U."}

It was not worth the price that we paid for that night. \n\nWe chose the tasting menu for USD 130 per person.\n\nAppetizer: \nCrispy Cod Skin, Dungeness Crab and Horseradish (2/5)- The crab was good but the skin was too salty. Way too salty \nButternut Squash Chip (4/5)- Though it was a bit oily, I thought this dish was delicious. \nRoasted Chicken Wings (3/5)- This was okay \n\nPoached Oyster with Osetra Caviar, Daikon Radish, and Sorrel (2/5)- Didn't like to poached oyster. It didn't taste too fresh. \n\nShaved Celery Root with House Buttermilk and uni Bottarga (2/5)- This was also a disappointing dish. Uni was so little. And it was a repetitive flavor, like lime flavor with the previous dish. \n\nPan Fried Scallop with Curry and Almond (3/5)- This was good, however, I had a similar dish in LA that was less than USD $16 and it was way better. More curry flavor and scallop was not overcooked. \n\nHen Consoome with Toasted Grains and Wild Mushrooms (2.5/5) - I dont know why this dish was part of the tasting menu. It was just so off. \n\nWagyu Sirloin with Yukon Gold \"Galette\" and Red Wine Jus (5/5)- This was the only 5 star dish. This was delicious. Wagyu was cooked perfectly. \n\nApple and Perilla Sorbet (3/5)- I really like to combination of apple and sake. It was tasty and very flavorful.\n\nChocolate Tart with Praline and White Truffle Ice Cream (4/5)- First time to try white truffle ice cream and it was really good. This was a good dessert. \n\nOverall, I will not come here again. \n\nIt was really mediocre and not worth it.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

I first encountered the definition of Modern European in Nice, France where I was looking for Nicoise cuisine and I kept on running into modern European which is basically continental European food. Then I realized, upon dining in a Michelin 2 star restaurant in Bonn, Germany, modern European means really inventive cuisine that cannot be tied to one country, one region. So of course when I think about New American food, I think French technique, Californian ingredients, and Asian influence, aka Fusion.\n\nLord Stanley does a good interpretation of Modern European / New American. Smoked olives were delicious. Chicory salad, sweet potato and asparagus with uni were outstanding. The shrimp tempera was very Instagram worthy. Fish, duck and lamb. All very good for entrees.\n\nI am not exactly sure why the prix fixe menu because I think the individual selection gives you a better feel of their range.\n\nI was entirely satisfied.

The set menu did not change much between visits which I was a bit bummed about. The set menu is $97 for 8 courses and the wine pairing was an additional $67. They're great about offering substitutions based on your food restrictions and preferences, and they're really proactive which was great. \n\nI feel like this place tries to be a bit fancier than it can really pull off; I would have preferred fewer courses with a bit more attention to each course. Plus, so many courses made for a 4 hour meal from beginning to end which is a bit unnecessary. One sitting definitely takes up your entire evening plan.\n\nSubstituted the Poached Oyster for a squash soup so I have no comments on this dish.\n\nBread and butter 4.5/5: I love the chewiness of this bread as well as the tough crust. YUM!\n\nCaviar with yukon potato 3/5: super small glop of caviar which was made to look big with the creme fraiche, nothing special.\n\nWarm Cabbage 4.5/5: Super soppy but flavorful buttery cabbage that was so savory, it didn't seem like a vegetable dish. However, you know dinner is only okay if your favorite dish is cabbage. \n\nFoi gras supplement 2.5/5: cold foi gras is really unappealing to me. It's not juicy or tender or oily, but sort of solid and clammy and the presentation looked like canned pet food. Would not have paid extra for this.\n\nWaygu sirloin 5/5: this was super delicious. it was the texture of a pot roast but tasted like a tender steak. best part of the meal, but I was not satisfied with the portion size.\n\nPear sorbet with cider 4/5: super fizzy and refreshing, wish this came earlier as a palette cleanser as opposed to a dessert.\n\nPumpkin pie with nutmeg: 2.5/5: the burned glazed coating atop the pie tasted a bit too charcoal-y and since it was a bit salted, it reminded me of ham or meat flavor on pumpkin pie which was weird. The texture was a bit off from normal pumpkin pie, not really grainy like a real pumpkin pulp.", "author": "Kathy T."}

What I liked about it was the inventiveness of the dishes and the resulting palate pleasing effects.  As an example we started out with an appetizer that was a treatment of Dungeness crab and poached oyster wrapped in a sheet of daikon radish. It was two bites that just popped in the mouth with texture and flavor. The crunch was met with a sweet tangy flavor with just the right acid to make my mouth water and get the gastric juices going. Then as the mastication continued the oyster rolled over the tongue followed by the crab meat. What a treat. \nThis was just the beginning of several hours of indulgence with impeccable service, a wonderful sommelier providing numerous specialty wines from small older vineyards around the world and to there was a good amount of food to leave us very satisfied. \nThe restaurant was very cozy non assuming.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-11-19", "description": "These  are one of those moments where it is so hard to write a review for Michelin restaurants because that darned star comes with such high expectations which in turn can cause strange beliefs on what the outcome is and probably why I feel that yelpers get some slack at moments for being hyper critical. I had hopes for this place without a doubt and I will caveat clearly that I think had this not been a Michelin restaurant and thus equating to a slightly lower price point, the overall experience would have been a 4. I think this is a 3.5 given the price point, the expectations, etc but I encourage all to try and experience for themselves especially given their menu shifts around. \n\nI showed up for a Friday reservation and we were greeted promptly at the door. The service was great throughout the entire meal and certainly checks the box as it relates to Michelin experiences. The restaurant is modern and has tables inside along with a large table upstairs it seems. We were seated at one of the tables as soon as you enter and we opted to go with the tasting menu to give this Michelin star the \"run through\" it deserves. For the meal, we were expecting the following dishes: Poached Oyster with daikon radish, Caviar with Yukon Gold Potato and a fraiche, Cabbage with buttermilk and Uni, the Hen, the wagyu, the grape sorbet, lemon tart, and the final dessert treats. The menu came at a price point of $97 and offered a beverage pairing option as well. The pacing of the food was good as expected with the Star and we were off to the races. The oyster came out first and it was poached ok but the chilled daikon radish and sauce was just a weird combination for me personally. It felt like a strange dish the way it was pulled together and was average at best. The Caviar was good and it was an interesting presentation. The cr\u00e8me fraiche was good and the way the caviar was on top was good. The dish was really good for the first few bites but the cr\u00e8me fraiche ended up being a bit too much for me as we kept eating and seemed a bit too creamy in flavor and texture by the end. The crispy Yukon potato was a nice touch because it offered the texture and the slight fried feeling giving it a bit of grease to compliment the cr\u00e8me fraiche. The warm cabbage was good and it was good but I was hoping for a bit more uni flavor to it given I was excited to see Uni weaved into the dish. It ended up just tasting like a warm cabbage dish with buttermilk. The hen was next and while the meat was cooked well, the trumpets below were just an odd pairing with the hen. The hen was also a bit lukewarm for temperature so I am not sure if that was intentional but it was just not as tasty as I was hoping for. The wagyu was cooked well and the right temperature so a solid dish. At this point we were full but next on the table was the grape sorbet. It was a good attempt at something unique and the sparkling rose was good but the two did not quite complement each other so it seemed a bit forced. The Lemon tart was next and again it was good for the first few bites but just lacked anything special to it afterwards. The flavoring was good but just looking for the next \"extra something.\" The treats were fine and ok but again nothing special.\n\nAgain these are those hard moments where I wish there were \"half stars\" as I think this would be a 3.5 with a potential for easy \"round up\" to a 4 but unfortunately given the price point and expectations, while each dish was good, it was missing something special for me that would kick it up. Certainly hope that people just take this review as a data point and experience and make their own decisions as well.", "author": "Dan M."}

This was our first experience and will most certainly not be our last. Quite honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect. A month ago I set out to find the perfect place for our anniversary dinner. We wanted something new. We have dined at all the well known dining establishments in SF. I generally don't seek out Yelp for reviews for nice restaurants because more often then not the score is inaccurate. However I randomly took a gander and in doing I wondered what the discrepancy might be between the Yelp reviews and let's say the other well know, qualified food reviewers. The restaurant business is a labor of love subjecting it's proprietors to vast vulnerability. What I loved about LS is how obvious that labor of love is. They subtly check the contemporary, conscientious dining experience delivering a start-to-finish masterpiece. So don't pay attention to the negative reviews. We loved every dish served. They presentation was discreetly intricate. The combination of flavors and texture were expertly crafted. Each dish left us wanting more. If we absolutely had to highlight favorites, it would be the hen of mushrooms with cabbage, the cured black cod with curry (otherworldly), and the wagyu beef, as well as the salmon roe. But truthfully each dish was impressive and delicious beyond expectation. In addition to the food, the service was unassuming and unpretentious. The restaurant itself is small but fitting to their cultural approach in the ZeroFoodprint movement which is so very important today. We felt like we fell upon a little community and to top it off we loved that all the staff seem to operate like a family. In fact you can see that the owners purposely weave their family into their food and their food into their family! I can imagine that every member of staff feels valued and part of a bigger picture. There you have it, Lord Stanley SF beautifully executes their craft from plate to palate and beyond.", "author": "Lisa B."}

Not for me. Basically, this was nearly Le Bernardin price without Le Bernardin's creativity, taste or exquisite experience. Yes, Le Bernardin is my benchmark always for 5-star, 5-dollar sign restaurants.\n\nThe cost per person for the tasting menu (and c'mon, if you're at a Michelin restaurant with a tasting menu, you've gotta do it) with a drink pairing was $157. On hindsight, we should have avoided the drink pairing as it became overwhelming. Our mistake. Had we not added the drink pairing, I think it was $100/per person which is a lot more manageable. We also added the special course which was foie gras and that added an additional $30 to each plate. That's nearly $200 per person. That's A LOTTA MONEY. (If that's not a lot of money to you, then please marry or adopt me. Either one works).\n\nThis was a special birthday occasion so we did splurge, hoping it'd be worth it. The food itself was perfectly good. Nothing was spectacular and memorable, and nothing was meh. But again, if you're paying nearly $200 per person, I really feel that at least ONE course should be spectacular, and at least one another very close. This was just \"fine, fine fine fine, fine\" and the dessert dishes were pretty meh. Again, not a ton of creativity to the dishes. Like, we got poached oyster for the first dish. And the foie gras had some crisp apple on top and came with cinnamon bread. And those are really the only two dishes that I can remember, hopefully that gives insight into the lack of creativity. Dessert was a peach sorbet and macaroons. No. \n\nThe decor is bright and nothing special. Luckily, it's not too crowded where you feel like you're on top of one another like many SF restaurants. The upstairs has one long communal table which I would not have wanted to be seated at.\n\nThe wait staff was wonderful - really great, nice, friendly and fun, and they do a good job. We gave them a very nice tip. They ruled. \n\nSo my tip is: Don't get the drink pairing, ask to not be seated at the communal table (unless that's your thing) and tip your waiters well.", "author": "Logan The H."}

We were greeted with wonderful service to take our bags and coat, with the surprise of a \"happy birthday\" greeting on our tasting menu (nice personal touch). Complimentary bread was given with butter, and their bread has got to be my favorite of all restaurants so far; chewy soft texture in the middle - yum! We opted to do the tasting menu with a few substitutions. They were very accommodating for us to switch out certain dishes based on allergies and preferring another dessert. I give them a 3 star based on their service, but the food was not Michelin-worthy in my opinion. The food was very different from most upscale dinners, I've had before. The tasting menu was $97 for 8 courses, and I can't say I have a favorite dish out of all 8. The dishes were definitely different and inventive, but I can't say I liked them all :( \n\n- Poached Oyster with Daikon Radish, Perilla & Sesame: Lacked flavor, bland oyster, but enjoyed the radish. Also, only got one piece of oyster.\n- Osetra Caviar with Yukon Gold Potato, Cured Egg Yolk, and Creme Fraiche: Interesting taste I haven't had before, which paired with fried potato that we would share as a table and break in our \"creme\" and eat like soup. It was interesting, but I wouldn't say I would order it on purpose if it was an option on menus. The potato part felt really oily and over-fried. \n- Warm Cabbage, House Buttermilk and Uni Bottarga: I searched all over for the uni, but it wasn't there :( Even if it was just a flavor of it, i didn't taste it at all in the dish. I felt like I was just eating warm cabbage for that's it. It also lacked flavor and wasn't worth being a part of a $97 tasting menu\n- Hen Consomme with Autumn Vegetables, Black Trumpets and Chestnut: This reminded me of chicken noodle soup, but without the noodles and chicken. The chestnuts were hard, and definitely could have been softer and less dry with the soup. This dish didn't wow me at all.\n- Wagyu Sirloin with Roasted Sunchoke, Black Olive and Red Wine Jus: This was probably the best dish of them all. Wagyu was soft and juicy. \n- Pear Sorbet with a Cider Float: I wasn't a fan of the cider, so I just had the pear sorbet. I like them individually, but together didn't taste right to me.\n- Honey glazed Semi Dried Persimmon, with Creme Fraiche Ice Cream and Chestnut (replaced Pumpkin Pie): I only liked the persimmons in this dessert, but never had cooked persimmon so it was a bit interesting.\n\nEnded with complimentary baby early grey macarons and chewy fruit candy.

The salt bake on the apple decreased the sweetness and acted as a great fence to the natural sweetness of the pork. \n\nDessert\n- Macerated strawberries with rice pudding was not overly sweet. Great complement to the savory dessert we ordered. \n- Shropshire blue with glazed pear and rosemary shortbread was fantastic; balance of flavors with the sharp cheese, sweet pear, and savory \"cookie crumbles\". I'd recommend eating a bite with al three components, brings the dish together.", "author": "Dustin B."}

The optimist inside me hoped that Lord Stanley would be a more satisfying experience. And it was.\n\nWe made same day reservations on a weeknight and brought our own wine ($25 corkage). For starters, we shared the Salt Cod Beignets and Wagyu Tartare. I was happy to see that Lord Stanley described the beignets in a grammatically correct way (don't you hate it when restaurants use an \"s\" at the end of the word and a single item comes out?). The tartar sauce that came with the beignets was great and we were off to a good start. The Wagyu Tartare was surprisingly good. The meat was chunky and the cracker it was served with was smokey and delicate. This was the best course of the evening.\n\nFor our mains, we split the Halibut and Short Rib. You know, both were fine but they didn't stand out. I have such a soft spot for short ribs and I was somewhat disappointed by how dry and tough these came out. There are very few options for main dishes and we didn't want a vegetarian meal and felt that halibut and short rib would be \"safer\" than lamb. If their entrees were only as good as their appetizers, then this would've been a home run.\n\nThe meal was not inexpensive by any means. Even with our own wine, it ended up being over $150 for 2.

Foie gras was a tiny slice for $17 extra (and my mistake for thinking it would be seared, but it is torchon instead) and truffles weren't even shaved table side. Instead it was cooked?! (it arrived wet on the steak) defeating the whole point of being able to smell the wonderful aroma, of which there was none. \n\nWith the exception of the scallop and the wagyu, which were done to perfection, the rest of the meal were either not memorable or not successful (the duck in the weird tea broth was absolutely not successful).\n\nI like chefs that experiment, but I walked away scratching my head at some of the offerings.

Our experience was...odd. \n\nWe came for the first time a couple weeks ago, and tried the 7-course tasting menu with the supplement. We had come a little bit on a whim to try out this Michelin-star restaurant and came in with an open mind, not really knowing what to expect. \n\nI can't necessarily say that we disliked any one dish, but we just found that some of the flavors in a lot of the dishes appeared out of place or an odd choice considering everything else on the plate. Perhaps our palette is not sophisticated enough, but we would find our reaction to many of the courses was \"hmmm...that's different...it's good? I think...\"\n\nFor instance, the seared squid dish with summer squash and cucumber vinaigrette was almost too mild and watered down in flavor. Rather than bringing out the flavor of the squid, I found that against the broth, the squid was quite flavorless. Similarly, our morels dish with sweet corn, almond, and curry, was very interesting texture-wise, but again, a little bit off flavor-wise. Normally, the beef or primary protein course in a tasting menu is a winner, but the wagyu beef actually felt a little tough and tendon-y despite being cooked medium rare. Definitely did not melt in the mouth and required some pretty heavy chewing. \n\nThe highlight was the supplement course, which was foie gras with cherries and a delightful herbed toast. Smooth, salty, sweet, and crunchy, all in one bite.\n\nAgain, I would not say that we did not enjoy the meal, but I think this was the least wow-ed we had been at a Michelin-star restaurant. Small components throughout our meal were just a little strange and there were no real stand-out courses. I don't think we would come back, but if we happened to be in the area, I would skip the tasting menu and try something on the a la carte instead.", "author": "Sarah N."}

Recently voted as the #3 Best New Restaurant in Bon App\u00e9tit magazine, I was intrigued by a menu that had local Californian dishes with Asian and European influences. The space is somewhat small, holding no more than 30 people, but the high ceiling and second level gives it a roomier appearance. \n\nThe menu features an $83 tasting menu (7-8 courses with a supplemental confit foie gras) as well as an a la carte menu. Many restaurants now feature a snacks section; small bites meant to tide one over until starters are served. These hors d'oeuvre have become my favorite part of the meal and is usually the most flavorful. Although I loved them all, my favorite has to be the roasted chicken wings with lemon (a\u00efoli). That one bite of chicken was very tender and juicy and left me wanting more. Coming in at a close second was the onion petals and sherry vinegar. One of the most unique and aesthetically pleasing plates, I think the Bon App\u00e9tit article described it best as \"Cipolline onion petals, filled with a thimble of pur\u00e9ed sherry-vinegar soubise, tasted like the purest distillation of an onion.\" The salt cod beignets with tartar sauce was surprisingly light for a savory beignet. \n\nBecause of the multitude of snack items and house baked bread, we decided to skip the starters and go straight to the entrees. I tried the halibut, short ribs, and the roasted lamb loin and belly. All the meats were cooked to perfection. Of the three, if you're a fan of lamb, it's a must try. The potatoes soaked up all the lemon and the acidity really brightened the dish. \n\nFor desserts, if you're feeling adventurous, try the goats cheese tart; otherwise, stay clear. The tart taste was sharper than I imagined. It had a light crust, which I liked, but the black garlic and lavender combination takes some getting used to. I loved the chocolate pudding, especially the black sesame crisp. The sesame flavor was bold and the entire dish tasted like a deconstructed version of sesame mochi ice cream. \n\nOverall, the service and the food were excellent. The execution on the dishes were spot on.  And the value is great for a Michelin starred restaurant. Parking around Polk was relatively easy since the meters end at 6 pm. Lastly, don't give up on reservations as I rechecked times on Reserve on the day of (in the morning) and found one around a more reasonable dining hour pop up.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

Service was averagely good- attentive maybe even so much I thought they were tryna rush me out. \n\nCame for my birthday on a Friday around 6pm. Parking worked out in our favor because after 6pm you can park on Broadway in the 4-6pm driving lane (just a tip). Sat down quickly and was impressed with the fancy menu papers. It was on this semi translucent paper (almost like a parchment paper) - I liked it. Felt special and different from other menus I've seen. \n\nWe started with the salt cod beignets and trumpet mushrooms. Both tasty. Salt cod beignets were also squid ink on the outside so come out dark and served with tartar sauce on the side. They are super mushy on the inside which was unexpected but really flavorful. Luckily I like mushy things! Salt cod beignets were my favorite the whole night. As for the trumpet mushrooms they were just mushrooms... Already kinda forgot about them. They came with a side sauce that was the texture of hummus but not a big deal. \n\nNext we had wagyu beef tar tar and it was excellent. Not sure what was on it but it was refreshing and tasted kinda citrusy with maybe some chili oil. The tartare came with a side of some wonderfully salted flat breads. This beef was my second favorite dish. After that we had the grilled squid with zucchini and cucumbers in a cold green sauce. While the squid was good, the zucchini tasted kinda plain and just boring. Not as refreshing as I think it wanted to be. \n\nFor mains we shared a lamb belly plate with potatoes ,onions,  and some olives and then shared the halibut with beans and dashi. The lamb belly was delicious and potatoes just right. I was stuffed at this point so not sure if that was clouding my judgement. The halibut was light and nothing special. The dashi was the best part of that dish. \n\nDessert - compressed peach. It sounded like i was just ordering a squished peach but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. A beautiful dish of a side of fresh peach and peach sorbet with a sorrel sauce on top. Very cool and refreshing. The perfect way to end the night and my third favorite dish. \n\nAt the end there was a sweet tomato marshmallow in the shape of a gumdrop. It was something different and interesting but still sweet and familiar.", "author": "Veronica L."}

Hope your experience goes better than ours did.  Two stars, at best.\n\nNeedless to say, reading that didn't inspire much faith in what I had (literally) just ordered.  However, after recalling our differing views on State Bird Provision and Mission Chinese Food, as well as after learning from one of my dining companions that Lord Stanley had received a Michelin star, I still had some hope that my experience would end differently.\n\nTwo and a half hours later...it didn't.\n\nNow, to be fair, nothing I had was terrible, though I question the Michelin star.  The menu changes relatively often, but it definitely tilts towards Modern European (much like the decor's IKEA-esque showroom look).  A tasting menu (~$78) is usually offered alongside the a la carte option, but the four of us passed on it since it didn't include any of the dishes that caught our eye.\n\n-- ONION PETALS with Sherry Vinegar...$5\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lord-stanley-san-francisco?select=ZjTN2JRc529Cg7dS-NNumg)\nWhile the presentation was admittedly nice, I wasn't a fan of their use of wood chips.  As for the petals, I thought the onion's sweetness worked well with the filling.  However, it was hard for me to get past the fact that the overall taste was similar to French onion chip dips.\n\n-- ROASTED CHICKEN WINGS with Orange Sweet & Sour Sauce...$5\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lord-stanley-san-francisco?select=UsGes_em8i0J5s-yyz4qIg)\nWings?  More like bites.  As much as I appreciated the chicken being deboned, this dish left me with mixed feelings.  I liked the chicken itself (the skin was decently crisp and the meat was juicy), but the sauce was a miss (a little too citric and sweet for me).\n\n-- SALT COD BEIGNETS with Tartar Sauce...$7\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lord-stanley-san-francisco?select=lfFIyZgEhdjJlYTjl1hEag)\nIt may have looked weird/unappetizing, but this was my favorite dish (I should've just had a few of these for dinner).  The beignets were slightly crispy on the outside and soft, fluffy, and delicious on the inside.  Plus, I liked how the tartar sauce tasted slightly herbaceous.\n\n-- FOIE GRAS CONFIT with Quince, Walnut, and Warm Brioche...$24\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lord-stanley-san-francisco?select=_ap15ML2BslcO-jcZ4WDNg)\nMy first foie gras dish since the ban ended and it underwhelmed.  The overall taste was no different than any other foie gras confit I've had in the past and the quince could've used more acidity to cut through the dish's richness.  Also, while I liked the brioche itself, another type of bread might have made for a better vessel.\n\n-- BARBECUED PORK SHOULDER with Turnips, Licorice, and Burnt Apple...$27\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lord-stanley-san-francisco?select=z5xGmLzDtajkrEVQowZOpg)\nA Tale of Two Cities?  More like a tale of two porks.  One piece was great (slightly fatty, moist, and tasty) while the other failed (overcooked, dry, and burnt).  Sadly, the rest of the plate didn't help either, as the overly charred turnips and apples only added to the bitterness.\n\n-- LEMON & YUZU TART with Sea Salt Meringue...$11\nOutside: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lord-stanley-san-francisco?select=SpzuAHBESLm7HNW014BFoA)\nInside: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lord-stanley-san-francisco?select=BqDib4mLPehiUFh5hNkxjg)\nAs disappointed as I was with most of what I had, I still had hopes for the dessert.  Thankfully, it was actually pretty decent.  The crust was neither dense nor thick, the lemon added just the right tartness, and I liked the overall contrast of salt and sweet from the meringue.\n\nAlso, for what it's worth, there were a few dishes that my friends ordered which seemed a bit more successful than what I had.  While I didn't try either one, the Roasted Duck and Pan Fried Monkfish went over relatively well with my friends, so they might be worth a shot.  However, we all agreed that the Chocolate Chiboust dessert is a must get (the one bite I had was enough).\n\nAs far as service went, I thought our two main servers were generally friendly, helpful, and prompt with our requests.  However, things got rather awkward when, after having confirmed with a server that tip was already incorporated into their prices, a gentleman (manager?) came up to our table to notify us that their policy changed and that, as such, we didn't tip them.  Obviously, it was just a misunderstanding (we explained what happened), but we all agreed his approach could have used a softer touch (he came across mildly condescending, particularly when he went into detail about why their previously policy was unsustainable).\n\nAll in all, TWO AND A HALF STARS rounded down.

Either way, in coming here last week with some girlfriends for dinner, we enjoyed our entire meal from start to finish.  I know this place doesn't Yelp well, and I know that we may have gotten things that are the \"home runs\" and not the more risky items, but everything I tasted here was delicious.  The four of us tried to cover as much of the menu as we could, but there were a few items on the menu that looked too delicious to not get.  In light of all of that, here's what we had:\n\nSmall bites:\nUni puffs: I didn't get to try this since I'm violently allergic to sea urchin; I didn't see a large reaction to eating these, so I'll presume that they're just OK.\nOnion petals: This I could have, and I wished I had the dish all to myself.  The delicate little onion petals packed a mean punch when it comes to taste! If you plan on sharing this with people, consider this more as an amuse bouche rather than an appetizer.\n\nAppetizers:\nFoie gras confit: I didn't try this, but was told that the wine gel was really fun and that the brioche that comes with this is to die for. The foie gras by itself needs the surrounding sweet factor to offset the richness, but otherwise a delicious dish.\n\nPoached hen in consumme with smoked barley and yolk: I ordered this and ate in absolute silence.  Once the consumme was poured over my hen, I went quiet.  Sure the portion isn't big, but the smoked barley really had some great taste to is, and to soak up all of the fabulous egg yolk is something I hadn't seen before.  Would definitely order again!\n\nCured Black Cod: I didn't try this, but was told that the dish overall was way too creamy for my friend's liking.  She resorted to picking off the foie gras plate instead and found herself wishing that she had ordered this instead.\n\nMains:\nCharred leeks with mushroom broth, horseradish & shiitake mushrooms: This was easily the best dish I had throughout dinner.  As a carnivore, I enjoy a good protein, but there was something about leeks and mushrooms that peaked my interest and I'm so glad I got this.  It's inspired me to look more frequently at the vegetarian options on a menu!\n\nPan Fried Trout with Clams, Seaweed & Dashi: My friend who ordered this said it was pretty good, and really didn't have too much to say about it other than the fish was perfectly and enjoyed the other components.\n\nDessert:\nChocolate ganache with ice cream & chocolate crackers: Eating this solo would be ambitious, but if you like super rich and decadent chocolate, this dessert is for you.  I loved the ice cream that came with it, but I'm certainly glad I shared it rather than taking it on by myself.\n\nLemon yuzu tart with sea salt and meringue: First off, the presentation of bruleed meringue is something that I always marvel at. It's so pretty! The lemon tart was a perfect offset to the overly rich chocolate dessert, and I definitely thought this was the better of the two desserts!\n\nAll in all, I don't think anyone walked away from our dining experience wanting more.  Service was a little on the slow side; and while our server was helpful, he was largely absent for most of dinner.  As always, one of my biggest pet peeves is when service is slow, but they're only too happy to run your credit card through once the bill shows up.

I'm no bible thumper and haven't been to church since the 8th grade so when I speak of THE Lord, I mean THE Lord Disick. I seriously thought Scott Disick was now a SF restaurateur. They sure named their restaurant the way Kimye name their children. Ones is an airline competitor and the other a hospital. Poor babies.\n\nUntil Lord Stanley was recently awarded their first Michelin star this past October, I didn't have much interest in dining there. Only 4 months of being open, they received their star so they must be doing something spectacular! So I thought.  \n\nSadly, my friends and I left THE Lord disappointed and completely baffled as to how they received a star. \n\nThe New American Menu is small with 3 snacks ($5-$7), 4 starters ($15-$24), 5 mains ($24-$78), and 4 desserts ($9-$11). Portions are small so order from each section. A 7-course tasting menu is available for $78. Service is NO longer included in their prices which we awkwardly found out later. \n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\nCollectively, the execution was very uneven and some ingredients were not listed on the menu so those with food allergies beware (they didn't ask if we had any). My friend who is lactose intolerant had to switch her entree with her husband because they presented her dish as being prepared with buttermilk which was not listed on the menu.\n\n*Onion Petals ($5) - 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1mweuXT\nPretty to look at but these tasted like a glorified onion dip. \n\n*Chicken Wings w/ orange sweet & sour sauce (2 for $5) - 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1O3JHfz\nThe boneless wing was crisp and tender but the sauce tasted funky. Call me ratchet but I prefer Panda Express' orange chicken.\n\n*Salt Cod Beignets w/ tartar sauce (2 for $7) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1OhJYqQ\nBest dish of the night! Forget that they look like a pair of turds, the beignet was delicately crisp, fluffy, and filled with minced cod. Fish clouds!\n\n*Foie Gras Confit w/ quince, walnut, warm brioche ($24) - 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1PglHEV\nI order foie gras every time I see it on the menu. The foie gras torchon here was standard. The quince was mute in flavor so there was no tartness or sweetness to cut through all that richness.\n\n*BBQ Pork Shoulder w/ turnips, licorice, burnt apple ($27) - 2 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1IkceNB\nJekyll and Hyde on a plate. One piece of pork was well marbled and nicely tender while the other was so burnt and tough (see pic) that it left streaks of ashes as I sliced it. The supposed burnt apple had no color but the turnip was also burnt. I like char but this was covered in crust of ash. \n\n*Poached Apple w/ vanilla cream, verjus ($9) - 2 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1PjAh0d\nMaybe it was my fault for ordering such a boring dessert but it's hard to mess up something simple like a poached fruit right? The apple wasn't fork tender and had to be cut with a knife (with sawing motion). The poaching liquid infused a very unappetizing flavor into the apple. My friend took a bite and said, it tasted like meat. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nWe had two female servers who were really polite but I felt service was lacking refinement. Our water carafe was empty and 3 different people passed by on several occasions and just looked at it. Once asked, they were quick to refill it though. \n\nDinner ended awkwardly and on a bad note. When settling the bill, we reconfirmed with one of the servers that the service charge was included in the menu prices.

Inside, I was horrified and embarrassed. I don't care how bad the food is, I would never NOT tip because I know servers survive on tips. Now, had he nicely said, \"Hey guys, I'm sorry if there was a misunderstanding but we recently changed our tipping policy...\", we would of been fine. But, he didn't.

It's a small restaurant with 5-6 two tops, 2 four tops, and a communal table in the mezzanine. Even after requesting a table in the notes section in opentable, we were seated in the communal table. This turned out fine as we were the only ones there aside from a couple and it was much quieter upstairs. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nNo valet or nearby parking lot.

My better half took us out to celebrate my new job, and we were not disappointed.  The interior is minimalist and sparse - white walls meet wood surfaces and light enviro decor set the mood allowing the food to be the show.  The table spacing is dense, but we were tucked delightfully in a corner away from the larger tables.  We opted in on the tasting menu, but out on the wine pairing (in retrospect, the wine pairings we witnessed looked well worth the investment as 3-4 whites and 3-4 reds were paired and presented well at the adjacent table).  Flavor profiles for the menu were diverse and intriguing, pushing my pallet successfully (the Hen of the Woods mushrooms were outstanding!).  The service was impeccable - spacing of the courses was perfect and the staffs attention to keeping a clean table was on point.  All in all a fantastic celebratory evening, albeit one that warrants saving for special occasions.", "author": "Tim B."}

I don't have a really high standard when it comes to food but this place isn't worth your money. \n\nI came here to celebrate the new year. Our first restaurant experience at a high end place. We ordered the Tasting Menu because this senior next to us highly recommended it. Do NOT get their Tasting Menu. You pay $83 each person for dishes that are creative but aren't that delicious. We came out of the restaurant thinking we would have been better off just ordering their main menu.\n\nThe only decent dish from the Tasting Menu was the Wagyu Beef. It wasn't fantastic or anything. Just more edible than the other dishes. The cabbage with buttermilk was really weird. I thought I was eating cabbage with a LOT of mayonnaise slathered. \n\nThe most expensive meal we've ever paid.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-31", "description": "I'm a bit late writing this review, but still wanted to get it up. We dined here in November 2016.\nMy husband and I wanted to try Lord Stanley because of all the hype, honestly. Bon Appetit crowned Lord Stanley #3 best new restaurant of 2016 in America, they earned a Michelin Star, and Michael Bauer blessed it with 3.5 stars. Because of these prestigious nods, my rating is harsher than a typical restaurant. I expected to be blown out of the water, and instead I left with \"That was pretty good.\" My expectations were high, and I just didn't feel like LS lived up to what I had built them up to be. Perhaps that is shame on me.\n\nWe had reservations, and they sat us 30 minutes late. To make up for it, they brought us some complimentary snacks once we were sat, which was nice. \nOne of my favorite dishes of the night was the stuffed chicken leg with what I think was a lemon sauce. It was phenomenal. The seasoning was spot on and had many dimensions of flavor. Next up I had the sunchokes done 3 ways, which was my least favorite dish of the night. To be fair, it was my first time having sunchokes and I think they just might not be my thing. But I did not find the dish to be exciting at all. My husband had the wagyu tartar, and it was delicious, but I found the portion to be a bit small. \n\nMy husband ordered the pork chop for his entree... and was served the wagyu beef. We both stared at each other, confused. It's dark in there, so at first we thought they served him a really strange colored pork chop, sliced up. But he took a bite and realized it was the wagyu beef, which was on the tasting menu and not available as an a la carte entree. He loves beef, and I mean, hello, wagyu, so he ate it and didn't say anything, but the fact that they brought him the wrong entree was a bit strange. What would Michael Bauer have thought?!?! lol.\nI ordered the curry monkfish, and really enjoyed it. The curry was unlike any curry I have had before, in a good way. Very flavorful, yet delicate. The fish was cooked perfectly. I did feel that the portion was a tad small, however. \nTo finish, I had the dark chocolate pudding with black sesame and toasted rice. It was one of the best desserts I have ever had. If my entire Lord Stanley experience were based on this dessert, they would have gotten a full 5 stars from me. It was just such a glorious combination of flavors. I loved the creamy pudding with the crunchy bits of sesame and rice. Agh. If that is on the menu, and you love chocolate, you must order that. My husband had a riff on an apple pie and liked it. \n\nThe staff was nice, our server was kind and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere was okay. If Yelp allowed half stars, I think I would have done 3.5 stars, but due to what one might expect from such a high caliber restaurant, I will stick with 3. If a friend asked me for a recommendation for a nice restaurant, I wouldn't say don't go to Lord Stanley, but I would have a sizable list of other fantastic restaurants that I would recommend first.", "author": "Liz M."}

We made a reservation for 6, which meant we could either do a 3 course pre fixe or tasting menu. We went with the pre fixe ($65) and optional supplements ($17). My husband, who made the reservation, said they were very accommodating and helpful throughout the process, so 5 stars for that. \n\nThe food was pretty good for the most part. We had some shared bites for the table and the aged Gouda puffs were my favorite. Appetizers were good - the scallop was cooked perfectly and had good flavors. Supplements were great. The kohlrabi \"ravioli\" was unique and the trout was delicious. Mains were good but nothing spectacular, although the fava bean tart was a solid vegetarian option. Dessert was where all 6 of us agreed things really fell apart. The strawberries and coconut rice pudding had potential but was just...blah. I thought the rhubarb sponge cake was inedible, and I didn't try the third option because it had blue cheese (which I don't like). Overall, everything was creative and presentation was nice, but nothing blew me away. I'd probably rate the food between 3 and 4 stars.\n\nThe reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because of the service, which was attentive and friendly, yet unprofessional. Most slip-ups were forgivable on their own, but made for a less than desirable experience when put together. We ordered a bottle of wine, which was served ice cold. I actually didn't like it at first, but then realized what the issue was and let it warm up for a while before trying it again. One of the plates had some chips in it, which the kitchen staff should have seen while plating the food. The waiter poured a sauce at the table to finish off a dish and dripped a drop on a member of our party, but didn't seem to notice. Again, nothing too horrible, but when you have a Michelin Star these are things you can (and should) control. One diner in our party also found part of a string in her food (probably used to tie up the fish for cooking?). When she mentioned this to the waitress, the waitress was apologetic but didn't really do anything else to \"make up\" for it, which would have been a nice gesture. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't actively discourage people from eating here, but I probably wouldn't go back given all the other options in SF.\n\nAs a side note, another reviewer mentioned being sat at the communal table even after making a reservation. I assumed that this wouldn't happen with a party of 6, but I was wrong. We were sat at the communal table with two other parties, which was odd but not a huge problem in the end (they did leave some space in between groups).

In summary:\n- the food was tasty and very original\n- the wine list is too new and probably worth paying the corkage fee\n- the service was very negatively impacted by their attitude towards bread\n\nThe tasting menu was a total of 8 courses and each was very nicely sized. We particularly enjoyed the warm oyster that had a very elegant curry sauce. Also loved the foies gras with the pear compote. Another great dish was the pork BBQ rib: very tasty with a smokey feel to it. The wagyu sirloin was probably slightly over cooked in our taste (we usually eat meat rare). The sorbet with a rose wine poured over was a great refreshing way to get to the sweets. Overall, we enjoyed the meals and had enough to it.\n\nThe wine list was primarily composed of 2015 or 2014 vintages. In general the reds felt very young and the sommelier did acknowledge that. We should have probably brought a nice older burgundy of our own (or a rhone) and paid the corkage fee.\n\nThe service was good overall but it appears we enjoyed the bread too much and at one point were denied more bread. This is the very first time this has ever happened to us. Yes, we love bread and their bread was great. But never ever have we been denied more bread in a michelin starred restaurant.

I tasted some combinations I've never had or would have thought would work, and it was all very playful and delightful.  The scallop had a nice dark seared crust and medium rare center.  It crushed the scallops I've had at Gary Danko.  \n\nAnother thing to note is how well developed the flavors are - intense yet light at the same time.  They make great use of acid in the dishes and many of the broths had a nice tang to them.  I haven't had a meal this great since I went to Californios nearly 9 months ago.

Being featured in the top 10 best new restaurants list in Bon Appetit magazine was really the first time that I paid attention to this place that I initially thought was serving British cuisine (ha!). As I found out more about this restaurant, though, I sensed something special coming out from the kitchen led by a husband-and-wife duo of Carrie and Rupert Blease. Aside from their shining pedigree (having worked at world renowned restaurants like Blue Hill and Per Se), I was hoping to see how they develop a California-meets-Europe type menu. I've always been a fan of California style cuisine thanks to its emphasis on fresh ingredients and clean flavor that makes you feel healthy and satisfied at the same time. My girlfriend, who later joined me on the California trip, and I had one night in San Francisco to spend before going back to New York City, so we had an opportunity to check out what Lord Stanley has been up to. Overall, I was very pleased with the elegant dinner here. \n\nThe way to go at Lord Stanley is the seven-course tasting menu (at relatively moderate price of $83 per person) to fully explore the culinary vision of the kitchen. The first course was underwhelming; I didn't realize that there was poached oyster beneath the pile of horseradish and red romaine that was a bit bitter. On the other hand, I had a lot to like about cabbage that came next; accompanied by house buttermilk and uni \"bottarga\" for very balanced flavor and texture. The subsequent savory dishes all came out strong. Gently cooked scallop worked wonderfully with curried almond and butternut squash, while I really enjoyed the cured duck leg in celery and apple tea broth for its soothing aroma. The best one, however, was clearly the wagyu beef with supplement of Burgundy truffle. The meat was more or less perfectly cooked, and wasn't overly seasoned to my liking. Add a hint of truffle, and this turned out be one of the best meat dishes I've had this year! Following a light refresher of pear sorbet, the dessert of dark chocolate pudding with black sesame and toasted rice was delightfully sweet. \n\nGetting a reservation at Lord Stanley seems pretty challenging, so I highly recommend advance booking. The dining space has trendy yet welcoming vibe that makes it an ideal place for a date. In addition to the tasting menu, there is also beverage pairing option at $57 per person which we did include in our dining experience. Unfortunately, the wine selection in the pairing seemed a bit more skewed toward natural / organic wines, which neither of us really like in general. I really liked the fact that Lord Stanley's kitchen has this singular focus on bringing sophisticated and well-executed food but achieving that goal without a ton of fanciness. Their approach to food, also derived from the California motto, is something I would love to see evolve more over time in the Bay Area and hopefully in New York City too.", "author": "Ken S."}

Staring at the photos (I'm not much of a snapper but I knew THIS was one to remember,) reminiscing about it like a long-lost lover. Took a friend for his birthday, told him to choose a restaurant, any restaurant. I was surprised at the location, smack dab in the middle of the busy part of Polk. What we experienced that night was near-perfection.\n\nYou know when you spend a pretty penny, and have not a shred of regret because the entire experience just made it worth every single one of those pennies? Well, this was it. From the second we were seated, to when we departed. First of all, can we discuss the service? We had a young Asian gentleman, definitely younger than us...and, wow. I told him it was impressive how him describing the dishes was akin to poetry, to which he laughed yes, he is very well-versed with the menu. We could tell. It certainly says a lot when you can trust that your server really knows what he's talking about. He seemed to run the entire floor himself, with others to support. As our wine glasses depleted, another man brought the wine list in anticipation of our next order. We were constantly checked on. Everything was perfectly coursed. Just...impressive.\n\nWe had 2 of everything in each section of the menu. Salt cod beignets and chicken wings were delectable bites to start a meal that was perfectly coursed. Entrees were hen (served boneless) and halibut which were delicious, with so many nuances to every bite. Even something that seemed like a simple choice, i.e. side of carrots were so unique and enjoyable, each bite a flavor explosion. And can we talk about that \"chocolate chiboust with sourdough ice cream and cocoa crumble.\" I can't even describe what that means, but I've never had anything like it. Wow. That's all.\n\nI only found out afterwards that Lord Stanley recently earned a Michelin star. Rightly so. So impressed, can't wait to be back, this is how a restaurant experience should be like.\n\n(P.S. Service is included in the price.

However, we all felt the short rib could have been more tender, but I would still order this dish again.\n-Strawberry Tart (w/Elderflower Custard, $11, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ltu2MDe8Wd1fySXirTSuzw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): GORGEOUS, and the crust was delicious. The elderflower taste was too flowery for my taste, but the texture of the custard was really good. \n-Chocolate Ganache (Vanilla, Caramelized Whey, $11): Nice and chocolatey, and all the components worked really well together. However, I preferred the freshness of the strawberry tart, but this dessert is recommended for chocolate lovers!\n-Complimentary Pate de Fruit: I don't like pate de fruits and this version was no exception.\n\nService was great here, and they are super attentive and accommodating.

So we ooze ever so slowly down Van Ness, hoping we won't be late for our reservation.  We'd left plenty of time because of the weather, and parking turned out not to be that much of a challenge, even on a Saturday night.  I was a little wary, having seen one of my main Yelpauthorities, Cherylynn's less than stellar review, but we'd been unable to snag a table at Gary D's, my first choice.  The decor was a little underwhelming, with an odd collection of seemingly unrelated decor items, but we received a warm welcome when we came in.  The space is very tiny with a couple of the tables (both of which we were led to, but declined) being situated so anyone over 120 lbs or taller than 5 ft would not be able to evacuate in a timely fashion.\n\nWe promptly decided on the Tasting Menu, and a glass of sparkling wine and let the courses begin:\nPOACHED OYSTER WITH CAVIAR, APPLE AND PARSLEY 3 stars:  Possibly the smallest oyster I've ever seen on a plate.  I think it tasted good, but it was hard to tell, there was so little of it.  The caviar was similarly minuscule.  I liked the parsley jus.\nCABBAGE WITH HOUSE BUTTERMILK AND UNI 'BOTTARGA 3 stars:  This was very awkward to eat, because the cabbage was in rather large pieces and difficult to cut, sliding around on the buttermilk.  The buttermilk had a great flavor.  The uni bottarga, though interesting in concept was again such a tiny amount, it didn't get a chance to have much impact.\nCONFIT FOIE GRAS WITH PINEAPPLE AND VANILLA . . . supplement 17 (i got this, my husband didn't) 3.5 stars:  The foie gras was tasty and well cooked with just enough sear.  The pineapple was in a chunk, though, so i couldn't get the impact of the two together very well.\nWarm Dungeness Crab with Wild Mushrooms and Parsnip Jus 2.5 stars:  Second most disappointing dish of the night.  Sorely lacking in salt, and the crab, although at last an ample portion had very little flavor and an odd mushy texture.  The mushrooms were good if slightly under cooked, which you can't get away with so much with wild ones.\n\nHEN CONSOMME with root vegetables and confit thigh 4 stars:  At this point we had asked for salt, but this, if anything was a little too salty. I loved the flavor of the paprika oil that was floated on top.\n\nGRILLED WAGYU BEEF WITH SALSIFY, CAPERS AND RED WINE JUS 4 stars.  The flavors really came together on this course.  The earthiness of the salsify, briny capers and throaty jus were delicious with the meat.  I haven't had much wagyu and was surprised that it wasn't more tender.  \nApple and Sorrel Sorbet 1 star:  This takes last place.  The sorbet didn't have much flavor, and then they poured sake over it for service.  This made it melt and added an off bitter note.\n\nDARK CHOCOLATE GANACHE WITH TOASTED RICE 4 stars:  Stand out even to a non sweets person like me and the added texture from the toasted rice made it that much better.\n\nOverall service was about a B-  We had just about ever server attend our table at some point.  Some were charming others just adequate.  I never like this helter skelter arrangement.  I like to know who's point person for my service.  Except for the supplemental course, I thought they skimped on the money ingredients.  So would I go again?  I wouldn't say no, but it's not high up on my list.\n\nFood:  31/40\nService:  16/20\nAtm/Intangibles: 15/20\nValue:  15/20\nOverall:  77/100", "author": "Diane B."}

Yes, they greeted us promptly and attended to our every need, but there was a lack of warmth that made me feel like we were lucky to be in their company not the other way around. \n\nWe split the waygu beef for two for $110.  Once you trimmed away the fat, there was very little left.  And what was left tasted somewhat flavorless. \n\nWe ordered the black molasses churros for dessert.  They were essentially flavorless as well.  It was like eating just dough. \n\nThe decor was plain and those thinking about going should know that it does not have a full bar.  \n\nWhile visiting from L.A., we had a number of outstanding meals.

Service was very earnest and nice. Execution on every dish was pretty much flawless, but only a few dishes also stood out for delightfulness and surprise - like the Yukon potato mousse with caviar and lacy crispy potato chips on the side or the hen in a very delicious broth with chestnuts and fresh figs. Those were absolutely wonderful dishes. The other dishes, despite excellent execution were less inventive - ie duck was just duck and lemon tart, although incredibly smooth, was just lemon tart without any additional novelty. I would definitely come back for a solid and tasty meal in a nice ambiance but I wouldn't necessarily come to be surprised by imaginative cooking (imagination is one reason I keep going back to State Bird for example - although some of what they try really falls on its face, the things they think up are just so fun).", "author": "Erin C."}

I knew I'd be in San Francisco for work so I made a reservation about 2 weeks out without any problems which was surprising.\n\nThe decor is very shabby chic and the people eating there were mainly hipsters. We'd come from a reception and it had been a long day for the both of us so we didn't order any drinks. I don't remember seeing any cocktails and they had a very short wine list. \n\nTheir menu is very limited. There were 4 snacks, 4 apps, 4 entrees, and 4 desserts on the menu that night. I was looking forward to having the short rib dish that was listed on their website (and still is) but they did not have it. Instead, I ordered the pork dish and my husband ordered the duck. The table next to us ordered the duck and we could see it was a bit rare for our tastes so he asked for it to be cooked medium. \n\nThe bread and the smoked olives we ordered came out rather quickly and we munched on them for a few minutes before our entrees arrived. The pork dish was okay, but I would not order it again. It lacked flavor and desperately needed salt and pepper. The best thing on that plate was the roasted apple. Despite asking for the duck to be prepared a certain way, it came out rare. I had a small bite and it wasn't memorable.\n\nI will say the customer service is their saving grace because there food is not where they excel. In fact, it left me questioning their Michelin star. The adorable woman at the hostess stand and our waitress were very accommodating and attentive. This meal definitely left much to be desired. Judging by the other recent reviews I am not alone in this assessment.", "author": "RaShonda R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-15", "description": "Lord Stanley was really very disappointing.  Maybe this is more 2.5 than 2 stars, but it definitely didn't fall into the category of A-OK for us.  We came out convinced we had overpaid for a meal we didn't enjoy, and we didn't have any interest in going back to give it another chance.  It's possible that we would have been better off picking from their a la carte options, but we did the tasting menu.  \n\nThe problem was that some of the dishes reminded me of an early experience I had at Fifth Floor circa 2005 where they tried to be creative with the combinations of flavors and textures, but none of them worked, and others were just nothing special.  There was literally no dish where we said - that was awesome! I'd want to order this again!  \n\nDungeness crab with celery and salted green plum.  The crab was fine, as was the hint of celery in the form of shaved ice, but the green plum did not belong. \n\nCabbage with house buttermilk and cured tuna heart - this was okay but fell into the nothing special category.  Cured tuna heart was shaved flakes of what tasted like anchovy.  \n\nPork belly, hen egg and dashi - for me, this was probably the best dish of the bunch.  It was good but not great. \n\nMorels with black olive, almond and curry - on their own the mushrooms and peas were actually fine, but the flavors didn't really mesh, and again nothing special.\n\nGrilled wagyu with golden beets carrot and red wine jus - the wagyu was really quite chewy.  This was fine, just not great. \n\nStrawberries and lillet - this consisted of a combination of some strawberries (the most normal part of this dish), some jelly that tasted bitter and a bit like licorice, and some meringue. I didn't finish it. \n\nDark chocolate pudding with malted bread ice cream - I didn't have this but my boyfriend thought this was probably the best dish of the night. \n\nIn the end, when you're trying to be creative, it probably doesn't always work, but you'd expect at least a few dishes to be exceptional.  The server did describe the tasting menu as whatever the chef felt inspired by that day, which leads me to think that maybe they need to do more testing of the tasting menu first.", "author": "Vivian W."}

For some reason I wasn't very excited about it, but he had been dying to go so we made a reservation. I was absolutely blown away. After living in San Francisco for over 3 years this marks mg favorite meal in the city. We almost never do tasting menus because you can usually get more of exactly what you want for the same price (or less!) and we held true to that here. We ordered the onion petals, \"chicken wings,\" a Dungeness crab burre blanc dish (out of this world), steak tartare, short rib, and a chocolate dessert. \n\nWhen it comes to the food the thing that made it so special for me was that it all tasted rich and indulgent, but was incredibly light. I was full when I left but felt very good which is a refreshing combination. The other thing that made the night was the service and atmosphere. They had at least 20 people working and almost every person helped us at some point wether it was refilling our water, bringing our food, resetting the table between courses, recommending wine, or checking our coats. The service was a well oiled machine and you can tell it's important to them that you have a good experience. All around they made us feel special and served very delicious food that could easily be perceived as pretentious in an approachable way. I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Allie E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-16", "description": "New restaurants in the City used to be a common occurrence.  In the past year, it's been less so and most of them are coming from experienced owners, mostly veteran chefs.  I read somewhere that both chefs (married couple) cooked in NYC prior to putting together their own restaurant here.  The immediate impression without coming here is it must be a fine dining place, but it isn't.  When you walk in, you'll see a small dining area with mostly two or four seat tables with the open kitchen towards the rear.  There is a set of stairs that leads up to a long communal table which is where my friend and I dined.  I'm not big on communal tables as it often leads to the pressure of sharing conversations with other parties and private matters probably best left at home... not THAT kind.  Fortunately, we were at the far end of the table away from the stairs and it was never full.  The menu is brief and simple so you won't need to pore over it too long.  After paring down our choices and asking a few questions, here's what we had:\n\nAppetizers\n1.  Salted cod beignets with tartar sauce (shared) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yA0crYfFPsB09MImEkfLww&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Not particularly visually appealing, the flavors were nice but kind of odd dipping something black (beignet) into something white (sauce).\n\n2.  Pomme puree with hazelnuts and grilled chanterelles (shared) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photo?select=S3lmGYCSU1L8sWGmW-pltw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Tied for my favorite along with my entr\u00e9e, the variety of textures and the richness of the sauce made me enjoy those mushrooms that much more.\n\nEntree\n3.  Roasted duck with orange jus (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4CMKHsqbMLbA5YGq8zW9tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Recommended by our server, this did not disappoint.  This is definitely upscale version of duck l'orange with the duck slices being soft and tender versus the French confit style.  The orange jus was not overwhelming and on the lighter side.\n\nDessert\n4.  Chocolate chibout, sour cream ice cream, and cocoa crumble (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BLY-5NFedhdcGJ876lSiew&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Another surprise flavor wise as the tartness and coolness of the ice cream contrasted well with the heavily flavored cocoa crumble and the light pastry.\n\nPrior to writing this but already having had this meal, I was a bit surprised by Cherylynn N. (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg) and Vicky L. (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M271Ac7UKVaQ9U5AOvc_9A) 's reviews.  All I can say is that I must have hit the right notes in eating here.  Tried a bit of my friend's trout (no really, I think this is salmon!) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pHny9kDUkVy24EfRwdA_7Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) and monkfish which were not bad.\nAt the time, their menu prices were gratuity included, but I read that it's since changed.  My meal concentration was a bit off that night as I stole peeks at my android in looking for that Warriors versus Celtics score, figuring that it'd be finished after dinner.  Well, we streamed the game which went double overtime and the RIGHT team won.  Smiles all the way home, from food to mood!", "author": "Mike C."}

What Lord Stanley delivered was entirely the opposite. The evening started off poorly when we were sat 20 min late for our reservation. The sommelier was perhaps the worst I've encountered. He sold us on a $120 bottle of wine without warning it was beyond funky. I like wine. I like interesting wine. This wine was undrinkable. When we alerted him to the problem, he admitted it was a very odd wine but that he didn't see the need to inform us of that. He took it away then entirely disappeared the remainder of the night. We had to flag someone else down to get us a new bottle which was a 2016 we paid $70 for, but that we could have bought for $15 at Safeway. The food was fine but entirely unremarkable and way overpriced. My lamb chop main dish for $37 literally had 1 lamb chop, 1/2 inch thick. After spending $250, we were still starving (and aren't huge eaters with giant appetites). We left feeling so bummed out we are trying for another birthday celebration tonight (but at another restaurant). Don't waste your time or money on this place.", "author": "Kate K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-14", "description": "Forget what Michael Bauer said; the tasting menu and the wine pairing were absolutely superb. Perhaps with a constantly changing menu, maybe there are some days where things aren't up to that experience, but we definitely enjoyed our meal. The cuisine here reminded us a lot of Commis, which is a 2-Michelin starred restaurant.. maybe just one step under that, but I could see this place getting a second star with just a little more improvement.\n\nSome highlights from our meal included a charred sunchoke with vanilla bread sauce, and a perfectly seared scallop with white beans and lemon preserves. Even the not-as-stellar dishes like the wagyu beef had a lot of things to talk about, such as that perfect, smoky char that lined the outside of the dish. Every dish here had flavors that were perfectly cohesive and balanced, and we enjoyed all of it.\n\nWhat we really can't stop talking about was the dessert -- dark chocolate pudding with malted bread ice cream. It was incredible and mind-blowingly good. Usually, the dessert part of a tasting menu is rarely our main talking point, but wow. This one was sooooooo good that we we wished we could've ordered 5 more of those. I really hope they put that on the a la carte menu at some point so that we can enjoy it without the full financial commitment that is the tasting menu.\n\nWine pairings were on point, with interesting varietals that paired VERY well... Not since Sons & Daughters have we had a wine pairing that worked so well with the dishes. The pairings are daring and sometimes defy convention, such as serving a red (was that the gamay?) with the seared scallop, but it worked REALLY well.\n\nI feel like this place is a bit \"under the radar\" for a Michelin-starred restaurant, and the negative reviews on here are for stupid things related to their change of the tip-inclusive policy (Come on people, if it never says anywhere on the menu that tip is inclusive, why the hell would you assume that it is when you still see a tip line on the receipt? Also, don't blame the restaurant, blame the government for stupid taxation policies). The food here is absolutely fantastic, though, and I will definitely be back.", "author": "Kazu O."}

Arguably, you can receive above-par food at many places, but the perfect customer service (the artful blend of magically appearing before/when the customers needs something and not being present so customers can enjoy one another's company) is quite difficult to achieve - even for many Michelin-star restaurants.\n\nBy no means was my experience at Lord Stanley perfect. We had a reservation at 7:15pm and didn't get seated until 7:45pm. However, how the situation was handled impressed me. Without complaining, my boyfriend and I waited at the bar, kicking off our dinner with some wine. Honestly, we hadn't noticed how long we were waiting, but our hostess apologized for the wait, offered to comp our first round and brought out comped popcorn and olives. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, they apologized again and promptly took our order, providing great recommendations based on our preferences. We shared the Onion Petals and the Sunchokes. My take: (1) Onion Petals - my boyfriend was convinced I wouldn't like this dish. To both of our surprise, I loved it. It's rather unique...the onions tasted a bit pickled but somehow it worked. (2) Sunchokes - my boyfriend was not a fan, but I liked this dish as well. Not sure how to thoroughly describe this appetizer dish, but the texture was interesting and had just enough flavor. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the striped bass with curry and my boyfriend ordered the lamb. For the striped bass, the flavor was amazing and the bass was soft, as it should be. It practically melted in my mouth! Definitely recommend - my chenin blanc went perfectly with the dish.\n\nWe skipped dessert since we're not dessert people, but overall, amazing first experience at Lord Stanley. We didn't realize it was endowed with awards and a Michelin Star so it was a pleasant surprise for us.\n\nThank you for an amazing dining experience!", "author": "Gina T."}

This is almost certainly the best restaurant I've eaten at all year. I went with my partner for his birthday so we splurged and each got the tasting menue. This was expensive ($78) but delivered a lot of food and entertainment. I had the vegetarian menu five small courses and two types of dessert. I say small but by the time the pomme puree arrived I was so full I could barely take a bite of the delicious potatoe mash. We ended up taking some of it home. Another favorite was the celery and apple 'tea', a sort of soup with raddish, grape, chestnut, and mushroom. The celery/apple broth and chestnuts gaaah so good! My partner's favorite was the pear sorbet with apple cider. It was actually in a little shurb glass so the cider was just poured right over the sorbet. My absolute favorite was the chocolate pudding with sesame and rice. Oh boy, there was ground up cookie on top of the gooey chocolate. It was like an extremely grown up version of the chocolate pudding 'dirt' your mom used to make on Earth Day with crushed up oreos and gummy worms. My boyfriend got the wine pairing ($57 additional) and I was glad he did. There would have been too much for me personally but I enjoyed a little sip of each of his. I am happy I got to try a little of everything but if I go back I will just get one or two dishes. e\nEverything was delicious so you can't go wrong but there was just a bit too much food on the tasting menue! \n\nLastly I have to mention that you aren't just paying for a meal. You are buying a whole experience. When I called to confirm our reservation the host asked if there were any dietary restrictions or celebrations. I mentioned it was my partner's birthday and I was a vegatrian. Right away he prepared to have the vegetarian menue ready for me and my boyfriend's dessert arrived with a birthday candle at the end of our meal. We were there two hours and the time just flew by.

My roommates and I got dinner here the week before Christmas as our gifts to each other. It being a Michelin star restaurant we had high expectations.

My roommate found a bone in one of her chicken dishes, and that same dish had halves of chestnuts in it that were nearly inedible. The same roommate found crab shell in the crab dish.

The dishes are both delicious and beautiful. They have an a la carte option or 9 courses for $78. We went with the a la carte option and were pleasantly full (but not too full. Just the right amount of food if you get an appetizer and an entree). I would love to return for the 9  course offering in the future.\n\nThe only thing I disliked was the awkwardness of a couple of things:\n- when you walk in there isn't a clear, intuitive direction on where to stand/go to. Fortunately the staff is very friendly and will directly you to where to go if your table isn't ready\n- there's a \"bar\" area that the staff will whisk folks to. We were fortunate to get seated immediately as we arrived on time for our reservation, but some people who came in a bit early had to linger around awkwardly in the \"bar area\" but this wasn't an official bar - no seats/no actual bartender, etc. \n- the upstairs has one huge communal table. We saw a couple get sandwiched in the middle of the communal table by two larger parties of 3-4 people on each end of the table. Personally, if I'm dropping $75-150/pp on a meal, I wouldn't want to be seated there\n\nStill, I think the food here is unique and has more of a slightly eastern-European flair than most restaurants in the city, which makes Lord Stanley unique  from competing 1-Michelin restaurants.The prices are in line with this neighborhood for this caliber of food and the service is top notch!\n\nGreat for a date night or double date/small group of friends. Anything over 4 people will be harder to accommodate.", "author": "Veronica S."}

My visit was very long overdue.\n\nThe menu is very brief.  Only four options exist for each section of snacks, small plates, mains, and dessert.  We opted for two snacks and two mains for our table for two.  The portions were perfect for us.\n\nThe snacks came out not long after our glasses of wine came out.  The onion petals were little bites of heaven!  (note:  don't attempt to eat the wood chips they are nestled on)  We were also very please with the mushrooms.  I sincerely enjoyed the bread that came during the snacks-- it was doughy, crusty, and perfectly chewy all at once!\n\nMy barbecued pork shoulder with clams was delicious.  The potatoes that came with it were tasty as well, but VERY salty.  Luckily for me, I adore salt, but I'm pretty sure these would be borderline unacceptable to the average Joe.  The taters should've only been lightly salted since they are plated with a salty broth.\n\nWe finished up our meals with the chocolate chiboust with sourdough ice cream because....well, we were just so curious about sourdough ice cream!

It's a beautiful restaurant and I couldn't have had a better experience.\n\nThat said, we didn't have anything we would order again--especially for the price. (The dense, moist, springy bread with cultured butter, that was a highlight! But we didn't pay extra for that.) \n\nWe got the chicken wings and onion petals to start. Out came two little bites of chicken sitting on top of a preserved lemon sauce. Salty/sweet is great! But the chicken wasn't seasoned enough to offset the sweetness of the thick lemon sauce, and the textures were all moist and slimy. The onion petal were super cute! Not sure I would spend $5 on them, though. I was happy to have experienced the creativity of them. \n\nNext, we got the wagyu tartare, which was awesome. It came with what I believe was a browned butter cracker. Delicious! That was the highlight of the meal.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the monkfish with curried almond and green olive, and the slow cooked short rib with red win jus. The short rib was one of the most tender pieces of meat I've ever had. I'd order it again! The red wine jus complemented it nicely. The monkfish, on the other hand, fell really flat. The curry sauce it was paired with was mostly a dull, sour flavor, and the starchy root vegetable that came with it didn't elevate anything. I'm all for new experiences, and I have never experienced flavors like this before! But I wouldn't choose them over much else. \n\nAnd finally, for dessert we got the goat cheese tart with black garlic and lavender. It was definitely a cheese course and not a sweet dessert like you'd normally expect from a dessert menu. It was tasty, but I wanted something sweet. I also felt a little jipped because they don't give you a full tart--they give you half of a tart. It was clearly once whole, but someone else ate the other half... I get the different presentation, but that thing was once whole. Not that I would have wanted to eat the whole thing! It may have been too big... But the idea that we only got half sort of bothers me, especially when the prices are steep. \n\nSorry I'm being all whiny about the price--everything was done really well!

Lord Stanley opened in June of 2015, by husband and wife Rupert and Carrie Blease. They are the owners and co-Chefs with training from working throughout Europe and the US, most notably at Le Manoir aux Quat Saisons, Per Se, Blue Hill, Texture, L' Amphytrion, and locally at Central Kitchen and Commonwealth.\n\nWhat are Chef Rupert and Carrie cooking: Rupert and Carrie aim to bring influences from their travels and experiences to Lord Stanley, resulting in a menu that is simple, yet refined, with British and European influences.  \n\nWhat is the food like: The menu reflects the seasons, highlighting the beauty and simplicity of local produce along with the finest, sustainably sourced ingredients.  The dishes have a natural refinement, with aspects similar to Japanese cooking and influences from Europe and Britain. Everything is made in-house daily, including bread, butter, juices and infusions. In addition to the a la carte menu, there's a frequently changing tasting menu and the option to add a beverage pairing to every dish.  Another interesting thing about the menu is that it includes tip simplifying the dining process for the guests.\n Why Lord Stanley and why am I suggesting you visit? For starters, the space both inside and out is gorgeous. It's hard not to fall in love with the simple yet modern luxurious decor. More importantly, Chef Rupert, Chef Carrie and their team bring a personal touch to the visit. \n\nWhat is the vibe: With the small intimate setting of 40 seats Lord Stanley evokes an intimate setting. So intimate that if you're lucky (as I was) one of the Chef's will deliver your dish to your table. It's little details like this along with the thought, love and attention that goes into each amazing dish which sets apart Lord Stanley. Their food is obviously incredible.\n\nThanks for checking out my post I hope you enjoy dining with The JetSetting Fashionista. Emily", "author": "JetSettingFashionista J."}

I fall into the later category and kept repeating the meal over in my head trying to figure out if there was something I wasn't getting.  I think there are a ton of great ideas coming out of that kitchen and the way they use ingredients is unique.  I.e. sweet potato dish.  However, some components get lost on the various dishes, while others stand out, but the dishes as a whole don't harmonize well.  The presentation of the plates was absolutely beautiful to look at.

My girlfriend and I came here on a random, last minute decision since we live in the neighborhood and have been most everywhere else in the Polk vicinity. We were a bit concerned about the price, that it would be a fistful of cash for tiny portions. It's not cheap, but we both left very satisfied and felt it was worth it.\n\nWe had:\n- Onion petals with sherry vinegar. A little crunchy and almost buttery - delicious.\n- Pickled trumpet mushrooms with almond and garlic. Also delicious, not too vinegar-y as we had worried. \n- Confit trout. Perfect, smokey and practically melted in your mouth. Our favorite dish.\n- Short rib with charred eggplant. Didn't love the eggplant but the short rib was outstanding. Perfectly cooked.\n- Roasted lamb loin and belly. Lamb made exactly how it should be, juicy and great flavor.\n- Summer berry and elderflower desert (\"Eton Mess\"). Very good, perfect to share for two. We weren't even that hungry at this point and we devoured it.\n\nComing out of the dinner, we tried to rate what our favorite dish was (the confit trout won), but agreed everything could have been labelled a \"favorite\" since it was really all that good.\n\nWe also got a bottle of wine, but I can't remember the name exactly. It was similar to beaujolais, and was around $60. The wine list has a lot of reasonably priced options (and some not so reasonable if you're into that). You can definitely find a bottle in the $50 - $70 range no problem.\n\nFinally this leaves the service, which was excellent. Recommendations were forthcoming, the knowledge of the wine list was obvious, and dishes were quickly removed when we were done.\n\nAs an aside, I'm sorry to hear this Michelin star rated restaurant is \"way below\" Sora's standards, but she's flat wrong. A highly rated restaurant isn't just about \"unique\" ingredients, it's about the quality, presentation, and most importantly the TASTE of the food, not to mention the service, etc. It definitely is at least on par with SQPR or Aster (both have one star), both of which I've been to recently.\n\nGlad to have Lord Stanley in the neighborhood!

Another $5 for 6 tiny petals of pearl onions with a creme fraiche type of filling that probably cost them 19 cents to make.  The owners of Lord Stanley are laughing their way to the bank.  The best snack item was the salted cod beignet ($7 for 2).\n\nFourth impression: nowhere was it printed that the pan-fried monkfish came with buttermilk.  When my plate came, I was super surprised and not pleased at all.  This is bad for people with food allergies, especially when dairy is a common allergen - this should be printed on the menu, but instead, they chose to list fumet, celery root, and lemon.  I'm lactose-intolerant but I'll eat a limited amount of a few dairy products like cheese and ice cream (with lots of medicine), but I stay away from products like cream-based soups, etc.  The entire base of this dish was a buttermilk broth, basically.  Luckily my husband gave me his roasted duck (the duck itself was good, the roasted chicory was too bitter) and ended up really enjoying the monkfish.  Sadface.  I wanted the monkfish.\n\nFifth impression: should've started with dessert first.  Chocolate chiboust was amazing - it's basically like a mousse cake with ice cream.  Not too sweet.  Delicious.  Unfortunately my friend's poached apple had an off-putting funky taste, as if they cooked pork in apple juice and then poured the juice back into the bowl, and the apple was still firm and we had to use a knife to cut through it.  Would've preferred it to cut easily with a fork.\n\nLast impression: we'd read on Yelp that the items included tip, so we asked our waitress just to make sure if we had to pay tip.  She said no service charge.  So we just wrote zero for the tip section when the receipt came, and sat there for a few minutes chatting.  A guy came up and told us a bit coldly (though polite) that they recently ended their tip-included practice, and basically we stiffed them on the tip.  SUPES AWKSSSSSS.\n\nOverall: pretty food, inconsistent taste.  If the menu prices had included tip, it would've been a bit more worth it, but unfortunately $360 for 4 (including tip) was not worth the money.", "author": "Tori S."}

But since food is the primary reason to go to an acclaimed restaurant, the overall rating is a 3. \n\nAlthough we didn't order the tasting menu, it felt like we did. We enjoyed the flavors of the Wagyu tartare and roasted sunchokes. The emulsion served with the squid ink churro was bland. We both had the new barbecued lamb entree, and like the combination of flavors, but we finished the dish before we even had the chance to start it. I was dreaming of the beautiful, substantial and a little less expensive Kokkari lamb chops when I finished the last bite. On to dessert: neither the goat cheese tart nor the parfait wowed us. \n\nWe won't come back for the tasting menu. I'd rather splurge a little more for either Commis (Oakland) or Sons and Daughters (SF) and have more elegant flavors and environment.", "author": "Timber E."}

I usually only venture out on this block on weekdays since it's overrun with drunken college grads on the weekends (not my scene).\n\nBut Lord Stanley is bringing some serious class to Polk St. There are some reviews on here complaining of its starkness; are you kidding me? I'm a huge believer in the minimalist movement and the tall ceilings and white walls are so refreshing to me -- especially because they're properly accessorized with fur pelts and industrial pendant lighting.\n\nThe menu apparently rotates on a regular basis but my party of 4 and I shared the following:\n\n1) Basket of complimentary bread = We asked for seconds, 'nuff said.\n\n2) Onion petals = Remarkably unique and scrumptious bites of onion \"petals\" filled with cream (marscapone?) and soaked in sherry vinegar. Must-order for novelty alone.\n\n2) Chicken wings with orange sweet and sour = Tiny serving but we were expecting this since it was categorized under the SNACKS category. So tender and juicy... just wish we didn't have to share it amongst 4 people!\n\n3) Foie gras with figs and warm brioche = Highly recommended -- even the Frenchman at our table gave his approval.\n\n4) Poached leeks with potato, buttermilk and truffle = The sauce was so good, we couldn't stop sopping it up (with all that extra bread we requested).\n\n5) Barbecued pork shoulder with onions, apple and szechuan pepper = This had a vaguely Asian-European fusion flavor to me, probably because of the szechuan peppers. The pork was cooked perfectly.\n\n6) Chocolate mousse smoked tea cream and caramel = We were all blown away by the sophisticated flavors and the thoughtful balance between sweet and bitter. I'm not usually a fan of dessert but this was one worth ordering, and will leave you further in awe of the chef's creativity and talents.\n\nAll in all an incredible culinary experience -- one that left us all full, happy and inspired.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

Its simple Danish Modern decor looks picture-perfect during the day (just check out their website), but even after the night falls, the charming interior doesn't fade. \n\nWait staff is friendly and warm.  We asked for extra bread.  Done.  I asked to bring the left over bread home with my doggie bag.  Done.  No judgment. \n\nThe food is great.  Onion petals were beautiful and what a great way to open up your palate for the evening.  Loved the salt cod beignets --- it's like fish and chips but much more elevated and refined.   Surprisingly, the foie gras dish sort of paled by comparison.\n\nAsparagus and sprouted grains are also notable.  Ever since I had the delicious toasted grains at Atelier Crenn, I have been paying more attention to restaurants that serve grains.  They might sound boring on the menu, but I assure you it's not like a bowl of bland rice you are getting.  It's flavorful, nutty, and has great texture. \n\nMy entr\u00e9e of cod was perfectly cooked.  My friend laughed at my idea of taking it home and reheating it in a microwave the next day as lunch.  But guess what?  It was delicious, even the day after, even after being warmed in a microwave in a sad little Tupperware. \n\nThe desserts were fantastic as well.  Chocolate cake you can't mess up, but the strawberry tart was a pleasant surprise.  It retained the natural fragrance of the fruit and wasn't over-masked by a layer of syrupy gelatin like many fruit tarts do. \n\nOverall, great place, great food.

And the holier-than-thou tone that ridiculed our expectation to dine at a reasonable hour was made only worse by their lackluster choices of beverages to distract us from our wait. As a showing of generosity of the Lord Stanley, we were given scraps of their pickled clams and fennel, though upon consumption, was neither inventive nor impressive. Nor edible. \n\nAfter almost an hour and a half wait - we were allowed to sit, but as expected, we were quite ignored. Upon asking one of the denizens of the kingdom if there might be mayhaps someone to which we could place our order, she \nbriskly said \"I can find our waitress\" and returned not but a long moment later with \"I can help\". \n\nThe food was thoroughly San Francisco - to wit, a bit inventive, but rather unnecessarily complex. The extensively-cooked salmon was delicious, but the potato was placed seemingly with little thought; the foie gras tartine was rich, but the picked strawberries and gelatin was overpowering; the poached cod was buttery and flaky, but the blistered avocado was a garnish at most.  \n\nThus to say, faire traveler, a visit to Lord Stanley is certainly not for the faint of heart, the empty of stomach, or any mere mortal. Perhaps consider other kingdoms or fiefdoms or hovels that know what they are doing.", "author": "J Z."}

Flavors were simple and the botarga was not detectable. \nScallop with avacado, lemon, and black olive - The lemon was overly sweet for the subtle flavors of the scallop.  Additionally, the scallop was overdone. \n\nSolid dishes:\nDark chocolate pudding with malted bread ice cream - the pudding is rich and satisfying\nPoached oyster with almond and perilla - Inventive, but the perilla is almost not present in flavor despite being visible\nWagyu beef - the sous vide then char method creates perfection and flavor retention\nService: 2.5\n\nMy meal started poorly because the hostess (Asian one) was brusque and had intense B face.  The same hostess who later had to serve a course, dropped the plates, named the dish and ran off. To make matters worse, I had ordered the wine, but the sommelier decided to have my male dining partner taste the wine.  Last time I checked, the taster is the one who ordered the wine or you can simply ask who would like to taste.

We very much enjoyed our experience this time and we look forward to returning.\n\nOne issue remains: Although, the restaurant was not as noisy during our second visit (thankfully, no nasty fights broke out this time), it was still fairly loud for an upscale dining establishment.  And no, we do not want to eat in silence, and yes, we enjoy a lively environment, but we do not want to have to shout at each other to have a conversation during dinner.  Something that can help mitigate noise issues is a trick I have seen used at some other restaurants where they put padding under the tables--it does not change their appearance from above, but it does help absorb sound.\n\nWe are glad we took up the offer to return, and we will enjoy dining at Lord Stanley again.", "author": "Christopher B."}

It's obvious the chefs know what they're doing: some of the food was absolutely exquisite, including the signature onion petals, the stuffed chicken wings, and the delicate but flavorful curry that supported the monkfish. The staff was gracious and maintained a nice distance (unlike the assault of service at a Gary Danko) and always seemed to know just when to come to the table, and our main server was obviously knowledgable about the food and beverage offerings. But there were some issues too: it took over 30 minutes after our reservation before we got seated, it was very, very dark in the room, and I'd ordered the pork chop entree off the a la carte menu but somehow they plated and served me a portion of the the Wagyu beef off the tasting menu along with the cabbage and molasses jus from the pork -- the wrong protein just got plated. I didn't say anything, because the Wagyu was gorgeous and I'd have ordered that if it'd been on the regular menu, so whatever, no big deal. Lol. And come time for dessert, the deconstructed apple pie was stunning: but the high-walled bowl it was served in made it nearly impossible to eat without attacking it like a kid with ice cream. My starter, the Wagyu tartar, was about the same: delicious, but plated in a steep-wall bowl that made actually eating it too clumsy. \n\nTheir food and table-side service is outstanding. It really is. But the odd plating, environment, and one big mistake made it feel like there are still some growing pains, and I didn't expect that with the rep and the M star. It's entirely possible you'll go and have the dinner of your life though, so it's still recommended.", "author": "That Was A Good Drum Break .."}

Okay so, British influenced cuisine, you would think it wouldn't be the most innovative thing, right? Wrong.\n\nThis restaurant is a repurposed take-out thai restaurant that has been completely gutted and now is simple but so elegant and, quite frankly, a chic combination of modern-art inspired black and white--my favorite color scheme. \n\nEverything at this restaurant wowed the taste buds, starting with the house made sourdough bread and the house butter, a melty and flavorful explosion of melty butteryness that made the taste buds leap. The smoked salmon appetizer was also really amazing, paired with a delicious lemony cream, it left my friend scraping the plate for every last morsel. The onion petals were also very good--the onions were light but very flavorful and juicy, topped with a dollop of delicious cream that lingers in the mouth. The best appetizer though is by far the heirloom tomatoes. They were so fresh and juicy and topped with some shavings of a yummy mild cheese, but they are also served atop an amazing bread that reminded me of the taste of the breading one finds covering a corndog. Just delicious.\n\nThe main course, some magical lamb creation was probably some of juiciest, most tender lamb I have ever had. Please try this!!\n\nFor dessert I had the Chocolate pouch, some dark chocolate and fruit wrapped in a little crepe-like wrapper and tied together like a pouch with a little gummy string. It looks blatantly bizarre, but mark my words, its like a little birthday present. Take the server's dessert wine recommendation as well, its smoky, dark taste acts as the perfect foil to the richness of the chocolate.\n\nOn the subject of service, everyone was super amicable and very helpful. Offering amazing suggestions on the menu and always one step ahead when we needed our water or wine glasses filled. Better yet, this European-style restaurants includes gratuities in the check so these amazing people actually get paid something like a living wage, go figure.

In particular I liked the cabbage course, the mushroom and the sweet potato course and the dessert. The zucchini course was ok, nothing great. On the whole, I think this was the best dining experience I've had at a 1-star place (among SPQR, La Folie, Chez TJ, Kin Khao, Mourad, State Bird Provisions and The Village Pub) and even better than a couple of 2-star ones (Campton Place). Some simple things to fix - lack of interesting breads and the portion sizes need a little adjustment - the sweet potato course in particular needs to be reduced. While it's very nice to eat, it can quickly start to feel like less dimensional comfort food. And the ambience - we got seated past our reservation time and the dining experience is more casual.

The sourdough had a good texture. \n\nIt's beer and wine only. They had some interesting bottles and we went with a red from France (with a grape called cinsault).\n\nFood: \n- Trumpet mushrooms: grilled, with a slight Asian flavors. The garlic almond puree was great for dipping, and we saved the extra for the bread\n- Dungeness crab with salsify and warm buttermilk: I loved the salsify's texture, and I was happy to get crab, but between the warm buttermilk and butter, it was too rich for me\n- Cured black cod: very tender, served over pureed cauliflower and rye bread; the most prominent part was actually the dill. The dish reminded me of something Scandinavian. I wish the cod had stood or a little more \n- Poached hen: the consomm\u00e9 with the confit egg yolk and toasted barley were really good together. There was a nice smoky meatiness to the dish, but I couldn't finish an entire one by myself \n- Foie gras: I liked the roasted salsify it came with and the citrus custard on the side. The brioche was very appropriate for the foie gras.\n- Pork shoulder with clams: the pork was leaner than I expected, which I like. It was very tender, and one side had a nice grilled flavor, but it wasn't super flavorful.  The standout for me, though, was the broth underneath - it was very rich, and it was great for bread and the confit potato.\n\nThe dishes were all interesting sounding and creative, but nothing blew me away. \n\nPluses: \n- Complimentary house sparkling water with frequent refills \n- I loved the complimentary salted caramel chocolate (ganache based, not too sweet). This was really good, and I don't even usually like caramel. \n- Service was great - they set expectations well, knew the menu, were attentive, and coursed things out nicely for us.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

Our waiter was our main point of contact the entire time.  I say this because often you go to restaurants and you have one person seat you, one take your order, different ones bring you your food, etc.  I liked the intimacy of the one point of contact and it goes with the intimacy of the small space and small but carefully curated menu.\nThe helpful descriptions and recommendations were all winners.  I was convinced to order the halibut rather than the mushroom dish and was extremely pleased with the decision.\n\nAs for the food - all such interesting mixes of flavors and creativity went into every dish and each bite was incredible.  For example the first small plate we had was the fava beans.  Served inside the open pod carefully placed among avocado cream, alongside slices of green olives and a sprinkling of sprouts on top.  These are the kind of combinations of flavors you never expect but pair perfectly.  The presentation is like art and the flavor is extraordinary.\nEvery dish that followed felt the same way.  The other dishes we had between the 2 of us were: Onion petals with sherry vinegar\nChicken wings with lemon\nEnglish peas with fresh curds, mint and pistachio\nWagyu beed tartar with summer truffle and hazelnut\nLocal Halibut with mussels and garlic, lemongrass braissage\nRoasted suckling pig with toasted almond, daikon and radish\nStrawberry and elderflower 'Eton Mess'\nChocolate tart with se salt and fennel pollen\n\nAs you can see we had a great tasting of what Lord Stanley has to offer.

I was looking forward to eating here, I'd heard great things about it and looked in the window while walking by several times and thought how charming it was. However, my experience there was much less than stellar. For starters, my dining companion got there early and they sent him to the \"bar\" (news flash: there is none it's a teeny place). He stood there awkwardly and tried to order a cocktail (there are none only limited wine and pilsners) Our dining experience was average. I ordered the $33 sea bass which was unevenly cooked and barely had a grain of rice as the accompaniment (on the positive side, the butter beans and broth were tasty). My friend's duck was good but was served with some root vegetables and nothing else. Seemed like it was lacking a starch of some sort. Oh and did I mention my seriously anemic wine pour. I did a double take when it arrived. Highlight of our meh meal: complimentary, tasty salted chocolate caramel bites at the end. Bottomline is that for the price this place is not impressive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-11", "description": "Summary: tiny little space with strong minimalist / Scandinavian decor serving decent food and okay wine that doesn't live up to the gorgeous ambiance; BUT REALLY GOOD BREAD!\n\nEvery year, I look forward to where my husband's office will celebrate their end-of-the-year holiday party, since it usually involves a swanky restaurant, superb tasting menu, and tasty beverages. Basically, it's an evening once a year when I get to dress up and pretend like I'm a 1%-er in SF. This year's soiree was held at Lord Stanley, which was exclusively rented out for the evening.\n\nBefore I received my holiday party invitation, I had never heard of this restaurant.  Turns out, it's a teeny tiny place.  Our tasting menu dinner was set-up for all 20 guests to be seated at one long table together, but I can't imagine the entire restaurant being able to host more than... 40?  There's a small upstairs balcony/loft area that we did not use, but overall, this is a very small and intimate restaurant.  The design of the space is modern with crisp lines, mostly bare white walls, and an aesthetic overall that feels minimal and Scandinavian?  I enjoyed the cozy feel, but it felt like the ambiance and design was far better than the food and wine.\n\nFirst, kudos to the staff for incorporating unexpected ingredients and flavors in creative arrangements.  From the hors d'eouvres, the onion petal and chicken wing were both very creative and quite tasty.  Overall, we felt like the flavors in each dish were more subtle and muted than our personal preferences, but the onion petal was very unique with a fresh / sour profile and the chicken had crisp skin with a juicy interior.  The salt cod beignet (squid ink colored the outer dough black) looked cool, but didn't taste like much.  We were served two mixed drinks: one a champagne cocktail and the other a whiskey cocktail.  My sip of the latter was really disappointing... perhaps the drink was made too far in advance of our arrival, because it basically tasted like water. Maybe the ice had melted too much? The champagne cocktail was much better.\n\nWe sat down to begin the dinner service. And then, the bread.  SO GOOD.  A crusty loaf with soft chewy inside and a smoky / toasted outside. Swipe on some cultured butter and BAM: the best part of my night. Seriously. That good (for the bread) and that meh (on the rest of the food).  Mushroom churros were a fun idea, but didn't taste very mushroom-y.  Hen egg ravioli with greens reminded me of a giant dumpling, but have to admit I wasn't a huge fan of the undercooked egg in this dish.  The ravioli's pasta wrapper and greens were excellent however.  Foie gras and brioche highlighted that whoever is making Lord Stanley's bread is a culinary superstar and that apparently, I don't like foie gras cold or room temp.  Scallops with coastal herbs and curry were in my few favorites of the evening. Pork shoulder entree was probably my favorite of the night: execution of the sear and perfect amount of cooking was excellent. Ended the night with an apple sorbet with cidre, followed by a chocolate cake with a chocolate caramel wafer/crisp and sourdough ice cream and what tasted like coffee granules.  The last dessert had way too many textures and ideas going on: warm gooey cake with cold creamy ice cream with crisp caramel wafer AND crackling crunchy coffee crumbs? Just take out the last ingredient, and this could have been really amazing... the sourdough ice cream was a surprising but complementary partner to the chocolate cake. I think I'm forgetting some courses, but it just means they were not memorable.\n\nAlso, the wine. Sigh.  I don't drink a lot of wine, so when I have the opportunity to enjoy wine pairings with a tasting menu, I look forward to trying a variety of varietals and flavors.  The sparkling Riesling was excellent: fruity, sweet but not cloying, bubbly, interesting. The rest of the wine was very forgettable.  I brought home my tasting menu with wine pairings listed, and I'm not very inclined to look back on any of the wines other than the Riesling.  Especially the sherry served with the final dessert. Tasted like wine-flavored syrup. \n\nFinally, this place is LOUD. Yes, we had a group of people enjoying food and wine and having a good time, but if we're one party and can barely hear our neighbors, how does anyone enjoy a dinner date here on a normal evening?  Surely, some sound padding could be discreetly placed throughout the facility.  I think there are many SF restaurants that have this problem as well.  Also, we began dinner service at 7:30 and were served our last course at 10:30. Is this normal?  I think part of this was that it would take 5-10 minutes on every course from when the first person was served their dish until the last member of our group received their dish.  10 minutes * 6+ courses = an hour of just watching servers walk back and forth from our table to the kitchen", "author": "Hannah C."}

Plus, it's reasonably priced given that tax and gratuity are included.", "author": "Kinga L."}

A few misses: a cold butternut squash dish with too many competing flavors, a grilled pork shoulder with grilled onions resulted in a tough piece of meat with a somewhat slimy side.  Halibut was good. Overall disappointing for a cute spot that I was hoping to like.", "author": "SF G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-20", "description": "My wife and I are fans of 1760 and saw a recent review claiming Lord Stanley was better. They aren't, but they aren't bad either. I had the pork shoulder and it was not flavorful and seemed tough. Cheap cut of meat. My wife had the monkfish and at the halfway point we traded and I went from a three star rating to five stars ( hence the average. Four stars). The monkfish was terrific and that's a hard one to get rightService was excellent but slightly impersonal. Surprised me because there is a no tip policy. I like knowing the waiter is pleasant for reasons other than a tip. Wine list was mostly wines I had never heard of,but we were thrilled with our bottle which was inexpensive but fabulous. We started with the onion petals. Do not forget to order these.  Price was reasonable for a pretty good restaurant ( one terrific entree and one so-so). I'll try them again. Maybe I just got unlucky on the pork.", "author": "Peter S."}
