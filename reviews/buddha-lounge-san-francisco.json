This bar is small and cozy and it's the perfect place to come to with 1-2 friends, or even alone! The setting is dark and intimate, and it's pretty quiet in here (the TV plays softly in a corner). Note: this bar is cash only, but there is an ATM in the corner if you really need it. A restroom is available in the basement, but you need a bartenders permission to open the gate to use it. In general, the place is very clean.\n\nI was served by a female bartender who was very friendly! I asked for recommendations for sweet drinks, and I was pleasantly surprised! After a few rounds with my friend, she offered us a couple free shots of \"real\" fireball from Hong Kong, and some warm sake. After she was off her shift, she was replaced by a guy named Mark, who is now the coolest bartender I know. He is an enigma, with lots of interesting stories to tell. I learned to play Liars Dice at this bar with my friend, and Mark is apparently unbeatable. I'd love to come back here again!", "author": "Tammy W."}

There is a garage over on portsmouth square, and some kind of lot down a bit off washington but like a lot of things in the city you are best served by coming here some way that does not involve driving.\n\nThis is a smaller, almost tiny bar. The seating is counter only, which is fine as it offers the best service. They've a tv which is viewable from any spot in the bar, and there are some murals to look at should you want to. No taps but the spirit wall is better then most divey spots nearby. It's cash only but there is a third party atm on premises should you so desire. The house special is of course, buddha beer. Tastes somewhat like Heineken but is a lot cheaper and has a clever buddha shaped bottle. Some folks think it's from Laos, Thailand or China but it actually seems to be brewed in Australia of all places. While all this is fine and good, the bartenders are the owners and they simply rock at what they do. Superior service is the norm here. Bonus points awarded for being ultra clean-not necessarily the most common thing in this area- and for offering the ability to drink low cost beer marketed to Asia brewed in Australia in downtown San Francisco. \n\nFour stars for a solid, unpresuming international bar in ye old chinatown.", "author": "Steven W."}

After walking around mostly aimlessly I looked for a place to sit down and settle in and Buddha Lounge looked like the perfect spot. There were only a few other people in the bar when I walked in, along with the owners. They don't serve any draft beer so I ordered a bottle of Anchor Steam. The bartender lady promptly asked for payment and I thought that was funny and straight to the point. She was making popcorn in the microwave and afterwards handed it out in bowls to the patrons. There were a few regulars that stopped in that she seemed happy to see. They have a jukebox here but unfortunately it can't be controlled by an app and doesn't play unless someone's paying and picking it. This made for some dead air moments until one of the regulars put on a ton of songs which I appreciated. Buddha Lounge was definitely a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of Chinatown and made for an interesting experience that could not have been a better introduction to San Francisco.", "author": "Emily B."}

This is true.  \n\nBuddha Lounge is a beloved little dive bar on Grant Street in Chinatown.  A lot of people have a lot of great things to say about this bar.  I get the sense that they have a good regular crowd.  I tend to drop in just while passing through Chinatown for a variety of reasons.  To me, this is a pretty textbook Chinatown Dive Bar which doesn't have any truly stand out feature but is still solid enough all around to stay relevant.  Personally, I can't get as excited as some people do - but I like it none-the-less.\n\nThree Things:\n\n1.  Chinese Mai Tai.  They have it here too.  You may have heard of another bar in the 'hood that offers this drink.  I tried the Buddha Lounge version and I was quite pleased.\n2.  Get a Buddha Beer.  They only have bottled beer, no drafts.  No good strong beer.  A Buddha Beer makes for a good photo.\n3.  The buzz in bathroom.  It exists.  But, on the bathroom note, this is also a handy last stop before catching an Uber away from Chinatown.\n\nThis is an interesting bar.  I rarely stay long when I come, but I'll keep coming back.", "author": "Adam S."}

It tastes like Heineken in my opinion. The bartender is a funny guy. We played the \"lie or die\" dice game, which I won't even try to explain on here. He explained how to play, but we needed a practice run before we got the game going. It could be complicated if you are in the midst of the night's fun, but it's quick to follow along. The end result of this game is that the loser buys a round of beers for everyone, and it will never be forgotten who lost. It was a fun night overall and there are several other bars in the area to do the Chinatown bar crawl type of thing. Buddha Lounge is on the lists of best dive bars in SF, so I would agree, it is a place you have to try out if you are in the city.", "author": "Jaime F."}

There are three things here that I'd recommend checking out if you happen to be in the neighborhood and don't have any plans.\n\nFirst, the Buddha beer is mildly entertaining. Pretty average beer that comes in a green Buddha shaped bottle. Nothing that will rock your world, but it's the small things in life, right? Second, they have a Chinese herbal liquor that will knock your socks off. Not sure what it's called, but it comes in a bottle that only has Chinese labels on it. Doing a shot is like doing an alcoholic version of the cinnamon challenge.\n\nLastly, you have to try to make some conversation with Mark, the bartender.

Plus he needs to buzz you into the underground restroom, so don't be shy to speak up.\n\nCocktails are pretty good. Wide variety of beers, including the iconic Buddha shaped beer bottle. I was even curious about all the Asian bottles of whiskey strewn across the back counter. But the true prize is getting to play Chinese dice games with Mark.

Bummer\n\nMy friends and I ended owning the jukebox and playing 1-4-24 for about two hours. 1-4-24 is a dice game, in which you roll dice in hopes to get 24, but you also have to have a 1 and a 4 in your dice arsenal... you know what, just Google it. Beyond dice games and three-penis whiskey, it's pretty much a dive bar that look like something out of, \"Full Metal Jacket\", \"Platoon\" or pretty much any psychologically messed war movie of the same vane.   \n\nThe bartender here is also pretty amazing, but be careful, this guy is 1-4-24 champ and he will get at least three of your five dollars.

I lay there stunned when all of a sudden Buddha comes bursting through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man \"OH YEAHHHHH\" and starts rolling towards me (he is really fat so it's hard for him to walk.  I picked myself off and began running back upstairs with Buddha rolling behind me (Like Indiana Jones when he's running from the big rock).  I run back upstairs, narrowly avoiding buddha who dissipated with the cool crisp air and dingy lighting of the bar. \n\nThe Bartender looked at me and pointed to the jukebox....I slowly walked over and hesitantly looked at it.  The only artist on there was Ray Parker Jr.... I pressed play and a bunch of Disco lights came on while the Ghostbusters theme song played on repeat for an hour.  Buddha came up through the floor and danced with my friends and I.  \n\nJust a normal Tuesday night.  Definitely a bar for an adventure.", "author": "Will H."}

If you have a good time or not, it's completely up to you.  You can't blame the bartender.  You can tell from walking in the door, this is not a fancy place.  What gave that away?  Look at the neighborhood that you're in.  You're in Chinatown.  Stop acting so stuck up.  Order a beer or a shot, or both.  Don't ask for fancy cocktails with cut fruit and paper umbrellas.  \n\nGo there at night.  Bring a Chinese translator.  \"Mok\" the bartender likes to speak with a conjured up \"Yan Can Cook\" accent.  We all know that Martin Yan fakes the accent.  So does \"Mok\".  You can call him Mark.  Who knows what his real name is.  Like strippers, I'm sure \"Mok\" is just a stage name.  Although I would feel really weird about tipping a man named \"Jasmine\" or \"CoCo\".  \n\nYeah, Chinese bartenders use stage names.  Just go to one of those clip joints with a bunch of Asian girls hustling drinks, in a bar that really only needs 1 bartender, and all those bar girls will be using stage names.  Now which bars hire a bunch of girls wearing too much make-up and not enough clothing?  Hmmm..........  Surely, places like that don't really exist outside of Vietnamese coffee houses in San Jose.  \"PR\" joints are more of an urban legend, right?  Just like the fable of the old Korean women who bartend because they're too old to work in massage parlors, right?\n\n\"Mok\" will do the same.  The rotten bastard will flirt with you, wink at you, offer back rubs, and anything else that's borderline sleazy for a big tip.  He's not to turn your back on.  Keep one eye on your wallet at all times.  You will wake up the next morning with a bad taste in your mouth, a throbbing head, a soreness likened to prison lovemaking, and no money left over.

As Lex Luthor's father once told him, \"son, stocks will rise and fall, utilities and transportation systems may even collapse, and people are no damn good - but they'll always need land, and for that they'll pay, through the nose.\n\n\"Remember that:  land.\"\n\nAnother guarantee?  A bar is only as good as it has to be.\n\nI mean, most bars are--if there's one thing you can count on in a recession (read: \"depression\"), it's people drinking.  Actually, it's also the one thing you can count on in an economic boom (read: \"bubble\").  The result is a guaranteed customer pool, so why cater to *those* fuckers?  It's a key tenet of capitalism:  charge as much as you can, and provide as little as possible.\n\nNot the Buddha Lounge!\n\nLocated in a very dense urban area, surrounded by hotels and tourist attractions, *any* bar is going to do a brisk business without having to worry about being friendly or having good deals--tourists are one-time customers.  No point in treating them well--fuck 'em.\n\nNot the Buddha Lounge!\n\nI wish I'd gotten the bartender's name, he was simply a great fellow.\n\nJessica L and I, after a bit of aimless wandering through Chinatown, noticed a neon-lit cocktail glass in the distance, the universal symbol of \"drinks be gotten here,\" and we discovered Buddha's strangely ornate, jade exterior bathed in that red, neon glow (green and red! them's Chinese lucky colors!).\n\nOkay, it's got a divey inside, that's for sure.  A shelf (for people standing) on the left, bar + stools on the right.  Brass rails for your feet, but no coat hooks under the bar (sad panda).  Black security gate in the back, presumably leading to the restroom (more on that in a bit).  I like dives, so no problems there.  It was full of touristy types, the sort of fresh-faced, young adults from parts East or South that stream through SF periodically.  They were celebrating something (either that or shots of whiskey are just something they do on Saturday nights--I can get with that, but you know...).\n\nJessica L's a bit of a troublemaker.  It was her idea to get the smoke bombs and Chinese poppers, and she hadn't had a sip of her drink before she was winging the poppers out the door, and by the end of the night, she was aiming at other bar patrons' boots.\n\nBest thing about this place?  The bartender.  He caught us tossing poppers, grabbed some, and threw a few himself.  Then he made us drink some kind of Chinese swill that's 88 proof, and taste like cinnamon gasoline.  He did warn us:  \"some people think it tastes like cinnamon, some people think it tastes like gasoline.\"  You gotta love a bartender who promotes cultural exchange, at the risk of immolating his patrons.\n\nStumbled out with nothing in our pockets, but had walked in with about $30 between us, so whatever he was charging us, it was a good price.\n\nRecommended.", "author": "Martin W."}

(The private birthday party Extra-Action Marching Band performance would not fit inside.)  Most weeknights fall on the quiet side of the spectrum, with unpredictable exceptions.  Fridays and Saturdays can be a little raucous, so if you expect to sit or play dice, come early.  \n\nWHO GOES THERE?\nThe combination of a Chinatown dive bar with proximity to the financial core and north beach makes for an eclectic mix of patrons.  You can expect to see professionals, hipsters, tourists, gamers, lawyers, misanthropes, locals, gamblers, and drunks.  Misfits welcome.  Occasionally some stripy shirts stumble down from North Beach, but it is more rare than it is common.  \n\nWHAT ABOUT THE BARTENDER? \nIf you've heard about the Buddha Bar, you've probably heard about Mark.  Mark is the only evening bartender the Buddha has and he's been working the bar 6 nights a week for almost ten years.  He will serve drinks, tell stories, gamble, shout, flirt with your date, and act as maestro of the madhouse.  Preferred techniques are taking off his pants, shouting, throwing things, et cetera.  To the uninitiated he may seem dangerous or insane.  While these things may actually be the case, getting to know Mark will reveal a different character.  Treat him as a friend and you will learn why so many people come back to the Buddha.  \n\nAlso, to the other reviewers: He isn't from Tibet.  He isn't \"coked out\" either.\n\nWHAT'S THIS ABOUT DICE?\nThe house game is generally Liar's Dice, though there are other games to be played: Three's, one-four-twenty-four, or just drop 1 die.\nIf you feel up to it, Mark will play you for a beer, but only if you seem like you know what you're doing.  (It doesn't do his business any good to leave people feeling hustled.)  Also note that he doesn't owe it to you to play with you, so be polite.  Lastly, Mark will not play you \"just for fun\".  If you want to learn to play, play with your friends first.  You will need the practice.\n\nWHAT IS THAT STUFF IN THE CLAY POT?\nIt is called \"Ng Ka Py\", pronounced \"NG GA PAY\".  It is a Chinese herbal elixir and it is largely there for the tourists.  Given that there is no accounting for taste, I find it to be a vile combination of cough syrup, jaegermeister, and cinnamon mouthwash.", "author": "joe b."}

I nervously walked through this cage door that led downstairs. To my surprise it was more of a storage area, and then up these tiny steps to a door in the corner (right for women, left for men). Then I thought it was a good idea to think of the worst. What if I get stuck down here, or what if a killer is after me, or I get kidnapped & eaten by a monster.
