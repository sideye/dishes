Not swinging for the fences or trying to wow anyone with innovation, just straight-ahead no-b.s. drinks with solid service at a fair price. They also fill in for me as a Red Sox bar when I need one close to home, or you can take in basketball or football or anything else seasonal at the right time.\n\nBeer selection is on point. I'm not a hop-head but they have Lagunitas and Voodoo Ranger, which is enough variety to keep IPA fiends happy. Guiness always, 805 on the regular lately, and Allagash is a good addition for a choice wheat beer option. Add a Jameson or Fernet for $5, and you can be well on your way on the first round. They seem to take pride in spreading Fernet to the masses. Any cocktail you order will do the job and they're not tight with their pours. The prices are good, not dirt cheap, but they never short anyone.\n\nAll in all it's a comfortable place for people who like to drink, well lived-in but divey but never scary. I don't know a better bar that's cheaper or a cheaper bar that's better, so they're a great destination when you're down for a mellow night taking in a game or a conversation in a small group.", "author": "James D."}

It was this past Wednesday, April 6th around 7:30pm.\n\nI was keeping it low key, so I just ordered a Bud light and a shot of Jameson ($9). I believe you can choose Fernet instead of Jameson with this special if you like fernet more. I'm not a huge fan of bud light, but it did the trick in keeping my subtle buzz going. We were here for a good two hours, so I also ordered a beer later. Can't remember the brand, but it was $4. No bad price wise.\n\nI loved the vibe of R Bar. Very laid back. It wasn't very busy when we were here, so it was perfect as our group of five just wanted to hang out and catch up. We grabbed some seats at the bar and just drank and talked the night away.\n\nGreat low key bar.

Because this bar is owned by Oregon alumni (they also own Wreck Room) the bar hosts watch parties where you can usually get a beer koozie with \"go ducks\" on it.  Everyone who works here is friendly and a bit sarcastic, but in a good way.  Draft beers are $5, and there are a few other cheap drink specials.  R Bar doesn't serve food, but they're ok with you bringing something in.  Also, R Bar is dog friendly, and specially on a weeknight you will find a pup or two enjoying the bar too.  As others have mentioned, the bathrooms are nothing special.  I've definitely unclogged the women's toilet before, and apparently, the men's bathroom is bigger than the women's, which kind of makes sense, because R Bar tends to have a more male dominated crowd. \n  \nI was here one year for Santa Con, and a very drunken Santa wouldn't stop bugging me.  He was speaking undecipherable nonsense about how some girl had just broken up with him...or at least that's what I thought he was saying...and he started to slam his fists against the bar.  I got the attention of the bartender closest to me and told him that the guy was bugging me.  At first they made him go to the other end of the bar and finish his drink there.  He slowly kept inching towards me, and after the bartender told him to stop a couple times, the bartender took his drink away and kicked him out.  The bartenders here don't mess around - they're very protective.", "author": "Stephanie V."}

Maybe it was the off time of the day/week that I went but I really enjoyed it here. \nThis is a small venue but the bar itself is large as well as plenty of seating along the rail and a whole open area in the back.

It's not dreadfully crowded on weekends and it's just the right amount of dive, if that ever exists.\n\nHowever, being the contemplative individual I am, I wondered for a long time what the \"R\" in R Bar stands for... here are my suggestions:\n\n- Really good and inexpensive drinks. Some cocktails up on the board are $5. I believe it's the \"cheap booze\" board\n- Ridiculously generous pourings of liquor. We ordered a couple of Glenlivets and the glasses were filled almost to the brim\n- Rad interior with black walls and candle-lit ambiance\n- Rock-ambient music in the background - nothing too flashy but fits right in with the mood here\n- Ravishing ladies who I met that one night... long story\n- Risque paintings on the wall. Seriously check them out; I wish I could have one for my room\n- Ruff! I saw a couple of dogs here once--drunk petting is the best \n- Raucous crowd that is always ready to take on the night on Polk st\n\nDefinitely come here if you're Polk hopping on weekends.\n\n---\n\nDistinguishing factor: A dive bar that is unexpectedly welcoming and artistic.

In addition, it's also a NY Jets bar, Fernet and several other team fan destinations. Affiliations aside, that's where the awesomeness unfortunately ends.\n\nR Bar isn't all that spacious and it becomes very apparent very quickly when the weekend crowds come a cluttering in. It becomes difficult to score a drink at the bar, let alone just trying to scream over the crowd. Maneuvering through them becomes a tricky dance and there isn't much escape from the lack of solid ventilation.\n\nBathrooms are a mess, but this is never a surprise in a dive bar. No one expects a spotless piece of shiny toilet porcelain by any means, but the stench of urine is enough to keep folks from using it entirely. This is only the men's side of course, but I suspect the women's restroom may not fare much better.\n\nThe prices aren't backbreaking, which keeps the drunken spirits alive. Well drinks aplenty and just enough beers to keep most folks happily hydrated. To the bartender's credit, they'll make drinks potent enough to make squeamish faces post sip, but if one can find a suitable drinking hour depends largely on the crowds.

They also have a few side tables (standing room only) but the bar is narrow so you're elbow-to-elbow web other patrons., which is okay because this bar is a good time - not pretentious or snooty.

The old wood is still there, and the art-deco ceiling along with recessed lighting still graces the spot above the bar. Rather than subject it to a top-to-bottom remodel, it's existing decor has been spruced-up with tasteful accents that lend it a modern feel without detracting from it's history.  The result is a cozy spot with a  hip feel, and one that hasn't lost it's old-guard charm.\r\n\r\nI sat down about 20 minutes before the start of the Kentucky derby, at around 3:00PM on an Saturday.  Two separate cultures seemed to peacefully coexist:  Marina kids towards the front of the bar, with a more sedate crowd to the rear.   I sat near the Marina kids...and they were loud.  I hadn't heard the word \"fuck\" so much since my last visit to Terry's Lodge in the Sunset.  Commonly repeated phrases seemed to be \"dude, I was Soooooo drunk\", and \"That's a rad song....turn it up!!!!\".  The crowd at the other end of the bar started looking more interesting, but the music got steadily louder....too loud for a neighborhood pub before 4:00 PM, and too loud for me to talk over.\r\n\r\nBasta. Five minutes after the horse-race, I felt the need to take drastic measures: Hit the bathroom, head out the door, and in doing so leave a half-full beer at the bar.  Nice place....irritating clientele.  If it's this noisy at 3:00PM, the night-scene is probably nothing I'd feel like dealing with.", "author": "Mike W."}

Lots of guys tend to flock here for some reason, but they're not all douchey, sleazy peoples.  I've experienced friendly conversations with no sleazy intentions.

Be warned, they don't serve liquor (except a korean liquor called soju or something, but it's pretty tasty).  They have 1 pool table, which I love, but i could use more.  Definitely a spot worth grabbing a drink at.", "author": "Jerry T."}

It's not that I have any affection for the Marina, but rather because it's just too easy of a target. The lines are clearly drawn in this love/hate relationship, so is there really anything more to debate? However, since the R Bar is hanging down on the edge of the Loin I feel the need to weigh in on the place. I've been to the place a few times over the past two years to watch hockey games (there are not many places in my hood that will show the Sharks). R has the makings of a good dive: stiff drinks, good prices, low level lighting, rock-n-roll juke, and lots of red (for some reason this appeals to me in a dive). However, it's the clientele here that makes this place stand out in a neighborhood full of dives. The fact of the matter is that the folks who frequent this place strike me as more Marina then Tenderloin. Every time I've been there it's felt like a frat scene. Think of R as a Marina dive with a slight edge, and if that's what you're looking for then it's a great joint for you. Want a Tenderloin dive? Hit the Ha-Ra and the large collection of it's brethren.", "author": "Rob S."}
