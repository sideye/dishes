My friends and I were here for St. Patrick's Day and from the moment we walked in, the drunk, slurred speech, wobbly bouncer kept hitting on my friend. He offered to buy her a drink which she turned down. Later he started eavesdropping on the conversation and she told him he was creepy. He blocked me physically from passing by when I had to go to the ladies room. He came to her again while I was gone and tried to touch her. When I came back she was swatting him off and telling him not to touch her. She literally told him he was a creep, she wasn't interested and to go away and he STILL didn't listen. \n\nAt one point he was literally falling asleep against the wall.\n\nThe bartenders didn't seem to care and/or notice.

I parked and was going to hit another spot - but that spot looked so 'cold', like a place where no one talks to each other.

I made a choice to go for friendly over good vino and I'm glad I did. \n\nFawn was the bartender - very cute and cool. Responsive and friendly. it was quiet when I went in there - just a few people at the bar and all of them were friendly. No one was an idiot - not even close but it wasn't late night either. You can walk into almost anywhere late night and you have to look at the place different.

It was a typical Thursday night and my friends and I were out for some drinks, we were bar hopping and trying out different bars. \nWe stumbled across The Buccaneers and decided it might be good to try it out. We went in, even though it was kind of empty, got the pool table, and got some drinks going. Table is a little old, but it was OK to play on. We bought some beers and at least 2 rounds of shots. Drinks were a little over priced, but we paid and tipped appropriately. \nWe're about done with the game and one of the girls decided to buy just 2 more shots. Her boyfriend paid for it. A short while after the bartender came over and asked him \"what? Don't you know how to tip? Did I do a bad job?\" So rude! He was starting trouble for what would have been like $2. Total buzz kill. We had a group of 6 and had been buying drinks AND tipping the whole time we were in there. The comment seemed out of place. One of our group members tipped him $5 and that seemed to be the end of it. \nWe finished our drinks and decided it was time to go. On the way out suddenly the bartender was right behind us calling out the guy who didn't tip! He was trying to pick a fight with us, even though we paid and tipped him through our time there! He spent a few minutes arguing at the door, telling us how rude we were and how we were not welcome back at the bar. He threatened to go to my friends work (BJ's) and not tip him? A little childish. Management needs to reconsider having this guy on staff, he has a business to attend to and instead he's trying to pick fights with customers. Seems like a bad business model.", "author": "Noe M."}

It's a dive, but the prices reflect that. I would normally be happy and comfortable here. As we speak, we've got a game of pool going on, and a pleasant buzz. Here's the kicker. Our group is originally from NY, so the automatic answer from us when asked : \"where are you from?\" Is New York.  Bartender response?\n\"Don't you tip in New York? \" \nReally, buddy, really? \nWe just left another dive bar, and we tipped at least 15 bucks. Seriously, go ask the guy at the 101 bar on Van Ness. Do we really have to lay out three bucks on the bar every round? Apparently so, if we don't want to be insulted. All five of our group has worked in the service industry across 4 states. None of us thought that the bartender's comment was acceptable. Our response to the unacceptable comment was this- \"um, yeah, wow, we tip when we leave.\" Which I think is pretty standard. Maybe I'm wrong, but even so- no excuse for a comment like that. We liked this place about as much as you can like a dive bar with a crappy drink  selection, odd jukebox choices, and a pool table with old, gnarly, shitty ass felt. Don't get the pear cider on draft here either- they don't keep it cold enough and it tasted like vinegar and smelled like those clothes- you know, the ones that never really dried all the way, then you forgot to take them out of the dryer for a week and they got that horrible musty smell to them? Anyhow, none of these reasons would be enough to keep us away from this place, but the bartender (who was working at about 8 pm, 3/18/14, in case you're reading this, Mr. or Mrs. Buccaneer) drove out a crowd of five like a scurvy-infected Captain Hook at a kids party.

I guess for many, the moniker \"Dive\" may be relative to their own experiences, and from the looks of the patrons they probably think of The Buccaneer as a Dive bar.\n\nHowever, \"Dive\" bars will have puke somewhere at almost any given time.  They will have those dudes who are belly-up who seem to have no job and drink all day and all night.  They will have questionable facilities.  And, when I say questionable I actually mean you'll question if you really need to go that bad...god forbid you need to shit.  They will have some shady customers and are dressed appropriately for said shadyness.  They are usually no frills and are mad cheap.\n\nThe Buccaneer is a no frills bar and it is mad cheap.  That is the extent that this can be called a \"Dive\" bar.\n\nThe crowd is relatively well dressed and lively.  The bar has great spots for casual conversations with many around you...very open floor plan.  The bathrooms are barely divebaresque (read pretty clean).  The Buccaneer not only allows dogs but they have water bowls and treats available for them.  There are also two crystal clear TVs that are situated as to be merely something to check on and not dominate the bar area.\n\nLastly, I feel this is worth separating.  They have great beers on tap.  I am in love with anyplace that had Boddington's on tap...for $3.50!  Wow.  Chimay is also on tap too among other quality beers.  Bravo.\n\nIf I lived in this neighborhood this would be my daily, err semi-daily, bar.", "author": "Chris D."}

I, however, was schooled in the Midwestern philosophy that when you are enjoying yourself, the fun must continue as long as possible no matter the cost - i.e. lack of sleep, hangover, liver damage, etc.  Plus, going here as often as I do, I have developed friendships with some of the other random people who patron the Buc, so there's always someone to entertain you.\n\nThe only drawbacks would be the bathrooms - one step up from a portapotty and the jukebox, but only because I am sick of hearing the same songs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-07-24", "description": "Like most Yelpers to review this place, I dug the cheap drinks and friendly bartenders.  Games at the pool table are 50 cents, which is cheap too, I'd say.  The Sunday night crowd I encountered was mellow and polite, and included a four-legged friend that was treated with the reverence of a beloved regular.  The charge of too many frat boys didn't occur to me, but then again, I'm an East Coaster and so may not know what a CA fratty really looks like.  But my friend told me that many SF bars somehow become havens for transplanted sports fans - apparently, The Buccaneer is a fav among former Bostonians, as evidenced by the Patriots poster in the pool room.  As an East Coaster, I could certainly understand that!", "author": "Adam B."}

The people were all great and the bartenders were friendly + speedy.  They have good beers for cheap - like Beck's and Corona's - only 4 bucks.  The Boddington's is a good pour.  And a $3.50 menu exists for the truly budget minded.  The next day as I was digging through my wallet to see what financial damage I had done the night before, I was delighted to see that I only spent $25 at the Buc.  Now that's what I call good bang for my Buc!  The only detractor was a nasty puke in the men's room that was left uncleaned the whole time I was there, but I won't let that spoil my image of the place.  Hey, at least it was in the bathroom, right?  I will be returning here again and again, and soon, everyone \"will know my name\".  [cue piano]", "author": "ardian b."}

The buc is a good place to go and enjoy a couple drinks with the diverse croud and a nice mix of regulars.  If you are a Yankees fan this might not be your place, the buc is dominated by sox fans (and bartenders).  Usually a good ratio (m/f) of good looking people here, good amount of people during the weekdays, but if you don't like being overcrowded you might want to avoid the weekends.", "author": "S T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-24", "description": "I lived a block away for years, Bartender Tony was my roommate, and I dated one of his best friends for a time...so needless to say, I spent many a night at the Buccaneer. I have been hypnotized by a real live magician there, won my first game of pool there, and ended too many bad dates down the street, only to head to the Buc to drown my sorrows before stumbling home. The booze is cheap, the staff is super duper nice and friendly, and the crowd doesn't suck. It's a good alternative to that creepy plant-infested place down the block and it sure as hell beats the crap out of Rouge, just a block away in the opposite direction from PlantLand. There will not be lots of girls in high heels with big hair, there will be no house or trance or breakbeats, there will not be peace and quiet, and there will probably be a rowdy drunk guy or two. But I like rowdy men and I like my bar music loud enough that I can't hear myself drunkenly singing along...", "author": "Autumn K."}
