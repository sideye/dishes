I got the original black tea, which is very bitter but plenty milky. The tea is only lightly sweetened, much less so than other boba I've had. The pearls are firm and chewy, and evenly cooked through. I personally like my tea sweeter and less bitter, but I like that this place has a unique style that they do well. \n\nBut minus two stars because I found a piece of plastic in my drink. It was grey and looked like a piece of a plastic bag. I'm sure someone tore open a packet and a bit fell into my drink-- it wasn't a mystery, and the prep area for the boba is open and looked clean. But it's still an unpleasant experience to feel something odd in your mouth as you're drinking, and fish out a piece of a plastic bag. Kind of put a damper on the whole experience for me.", "author": "Bhiravi R."}

There are definitely better places in Little Saigon, the Avenues and in towns outside of San Francisco (which I never visit).  But this place serves up some tasty Vietnamese (and  not-so-Vietnamese) dishes in a fast casual setting that beats the nearby competition for a good workday lunch bowl of Pho.\n\nBeef Pho: Rare steak, brisket and beef ball is my signature combo.  The rare steak is actually served rare here in a mound that thankfully isn't all stuck together (as seen at other Pho joints).  The portion of steak in the broth is medium and there is a gradient of doneness up to rare at the top.  The brisket comes in large slices and offers a nice well-done and fatty contrast.  The beef balls seem smaller and chewier compared to most pho places, but still decent enough to include in a bowl.  The broth-to-noodle ratio is good; in the past it seems like they had overloaded on noodles and skimped on broth so I'm glad that this has been remedied.  The broth itself is respectable.

I used to frequent Hi-Tea circa 2010 when they were still in business for Pho as it's increasingly difficult to get Vietnamese in FiDi. Anyways I was venturing over to Osha Thai for lunch but the wait was 20+ minutes. I needed to get back to the office so I remembered that I've been meaning to give Hong Kee & Kim a try.\n\nThe restaurant is on the second floor so we made our way up there. It's a pretty big place and has plenty of seating. Order at the counter, take a number, and have a seat. Everything is self-serve (just like cafeteria style). They will bring out your food very quickly. I had the combo beef pho and a mango milk tea with tapioca. Prices are a premium in FiDi and portions are about average at best. Small price to pay for the convenience of not having to walk to Chinatown for a cash-only experience. Plus side they take all types of credit cards here. I'm still kind on the fence about tipping or not tipping. I mean if I have to go up to the counter, grab my own utensils, and refill my own drink does that count as waiter service? Probably not. Tipping in America is too complicated and I get kinda flustered when I have to decide how much. Why can't it be like the rest of the world where they include the entire cost of VAT and service in the price? They have a very good selection of Chinese and Vietnamese items. I don't think you can go wrong and many rave about the soups which are great on a cold day.\n\nI like the location and it's convenient.

I ordered the grilled chicken vermicelli and the potstickers, along with a bottle of water, and found my total to be a whopping $16.03. Granted, the amount of chicken I got was nearly, if not, an entire breast, but the large bowl is padded on the bottom with lettuce underneath what I thought was a generous portion of noodles. The potstickers were very delicious, however, and the spicy chili oil/soy sauce dipping sauce was quite good as well. \n\nI was disappointed to find that my vermicelli tasted exactly like soap. Not that I've ever eaten soap, but it tasted like what laundry detergent or Dove smells like, and that's not what I want to taste when I'm eating rice noodles.

After narrowing my options down based upon cuisine (Vietnamese) and how far I was willing to walk (not a lot), I came upon Hong Kee & Kim.  With a health score of 100 out of 100, I grabbed my purse and headed out.  You see, I realize that I need to balance my relatively sedentary lifestyle with healthy eating and smaller quantities of food.  (Yeah, my doctor would have you know that she does not endorse that previous statement.)\n\nAnyway, I work near Fremont x Market, so it took me less than 5 minutes to get there.  I'll admit that I almost popped into the sandwich shop next door when I spied the stairs, but realizing that it would be good training for the Nike Women's (HALF) Marathon that I'm doing with some friends in October, I made the hike up the perilous steps.\n\nEven though there's construction going on across the street, this place would still be great for a sit-down lunch date.  But then again, the weather has been so wonderful that I chose to order my food to go, and eventually found a spot outside a Starbucks on California x Davis.\n\nMy receipt was timestamped 1:56:43 PM, and my less accurate phone display read 2:02 PM when one of the cashiers handed me my order (#20 - Beef Vermicelli - $7.75 + $0.68 (tax) = $8.43 total).  I know that the dish isn't that complex (it's essentially all about layering noodles, fresh veggies and meat in a container), but still... DAY-UM! \n \nTheir vermicelli dish was pretty solid - the noodles had a great consistency, the sauce was pretty tasty, it had just the right amount of veggies, and the meat was well-seasoned, too.\n\nMy only complaint is that they don't take Discover, just Visa.  I know, I know... #firstworldproblems.", "author": "Iona C."}

The offerings include but are not limited to\n\n*Typical variations of Beef Pho\n*Special Pho which has a broth that contains tomatoes \n*Fresh shrimp spring rolls\n*Fried spring rolls\n*Wonton noodle soup\n*Beef Stew noodle soup\n*Congee -- aka Jook, Porridge\n*Dim Sum such as shrimp dumpling, pork dumpling, sweet rice in lotus leaf\n\nOK, now for my experience.  I originally headed out there for some wonton noodle soup thinking it was still going to be All Seasons restaurant.  As I made my way up the stairs, I notice that they got rid of their hot food bar and the place looked newly remodeled.  I tried to order the wonton noodle soup but they told me that they didn't have the egg noodles that go delightfully with the soup.  So being that it was a Pho place, I ordered some pho & fresh shrimp spring rolls.  \n\nFood --- Substantially mediocre and not quite up to par.  Perhaps they should have waited another day to open so that the pho broth would be more flavorful. This place is ran by Chinese people and seems to lack the flare of authentic Vietnamese Pho.  The broth was lukewarm, bland and the flavors of cloves & star anise were a bit strong.  They probably should have left some fish sauce on the table to help with the blandness.  The only good thing about the pho is that they were very generous with the noodle & beef portion.  It really didn't matter though because it wasn't very good so I only ate a quarter of it. The shrimp spring rolls looked beautiful with a decent amount of shrimp.  They even shredded the lettuce to make it easier to eat however, they also added some shredded cucumber which I found to be strange.  Also, there was no pork in the spring rolls & the sauce was enough to dip only one spring roll.  \n\nService --- Boy O Boy.. they really need to get it together.  I ordered the beef & tripe pho but didn't get any tripe.  Trying to communicate this was extremely difficult.  I just wanted them to bring me a side of tripe but they kept wanting to take all of my noodles back.

Finally, I decided to satisfy the craving by having lunch here since it was down the street from work. I ordered their beef jook, and Boyfriend got their barbecue pork fried rice and I eagerly sat there waiting, excited to soon be putting into my belly what it had been wanting for what felt like FOREVER.\n\nI should've just begged my mom to make some at home instead.\n\nI mean, jook in and of itself is rather tasteless. It's the toppings and added ingredients that give it the flavor (like preserved duck eggs and pork), but the beef didn't really add too much to the jook. Luckily, flavors did become a little more pronounced as I got deeper into the bowl (and after I did a little mixing when the jook wasn't ridiculously piping hot anymore), but I felt like it should've been equally flavorful from start to end.\n\nBoyfriend was also sorely disappointed by his fried rice. He claimed it was \"typical,\" and it was -- nothing that you couldn't grab at a Panda Express or something. He actually ended up grabbing soup instead to eat because he couldn't bring himself to finish the rest of his lunch. I wouldn't say it was flavorless, but there wasn't anything about it that made it spectacular. It was fried rice, with bits of barbecue pork chopped up and thrown into it.\n\nI have to agree with Boyfriend that we did choose probably the two worst dishes to judge them by -- jook and fried rice. I think I'm going to have to come back and try their pho or something before I pass an everlasting judgment on the place, though so far I have to say that I'm not highly impressed by what I've had.", "author": "Anna W."}

I felt super smug ... until I walked up the steps into a line at least as long as the one outside. My first impression was one of organized and efficient bustle. Servers carrying cafeteria style trays clearly calling out numbers as business people lean in with excitement, hoping that it's their turn to receive what they paid for. The line moved quickly up the stairs, giving way to a tidy, almost cozy looking spot to catch up with coworkers as you gulp down your pho. Despite being crazy crowded, the noise level wasn't so bad, which I attribute to the acoustic tile ceiling taking the sharp edges off of neighboring conversations. \n\nGenerally I get take out, so atmosphere doesn't matter to me so much as the little touches like how fast my order arrives and what they include in their to-go packet, and I have to say, it's impressive. The addition of a packet of sri racha sauce with my order of dumplings was very much appreciated! The pho has a nice broth for a base, not quite flavorful on its own but hearty when taken in concert with the sprouts, lime, and assorted meats the complete the dish. The noodles that came with it were surprisingly good: soft without being soggy, flavorful without being salty.\n\nOverall, Hong Kee & Kim is a solid addition to anyone's lunch repertoire.", "author": "Aaron Y."}

Does it deliver?  Yes, if you're not a fan of the nearby competitor, Pho Hoa.\n\nCompared to Pho Hoa, the vietnamese noodles are better prepared and more fragrant, rather than relying on the old MSG and salt trick.  Still, a lot is left to be desired.  The broth, in comparison to many good pho places, is a bit bland and lacks a lot of beefy flavor that makes a good bowl of pho.\n\nThe salt and pepper spareribs were alright too.  A little too soggy once it got to my table, and it could really use another side to cut the fried flavor a bit (pickled cucumbers and white carrots maybe?) .\n\nThe mongolian beef was good too, and it mixed well with the rice.  Just a tad salty.  What Americanized Asian food isn't nowadays though -_-...\n\nService was fine, though it's obvious from observing the service of others that the staff has a lot to learn.  Still, I got my food in a timely manner.\n\nOh, and if the owners/staff are reading this, please, for the love of god, close the front door.

I sat in a corner for 45 minutes observing the workers and they did not clean a single table.  They just picked off the food from the table with tissues, yuck.

I started coming here as soon as they opened....and have been disappointed every time.  I only get take out since when I get released from my job, it's usually between 2pm and 4pm and the whole place has always been completely empty except for the service girls.  The girls are always very sweet.  However, everything I've ever gotten from here has been sub-par, even for Chinese food.  Plus it's always taken them close to 45 mins. to get the food to me, even just a cold salad.  There are other places to eat around this area so I've stopped going here.  Plus there's this stairway you have to climb to get up there, and then you have to climb down it and it's kind of steep; my old knees aren't always happy to do that climb anymore.  If I want Vietnamese, I do the 5-6 block walk to Sai's.  If I want Chinese I'll go the Henry's Hunan, another easy walk.  They could do do much more with this restaurant but they haven't which is so disappointing.\n\nMarch 2015.  So, it's been a while and I'm still going here.  It's not Chinese, it's Vietnamese!  They have some Chinese dishes but it's done Vietnamese style.  It makes a difference to know this.  Ok, I find their pho has a kind of anise taste to it.  Not a bad thing, just different.  They also do a wor won ton.  Their rice dishes are ok.  I still don't understand that with all these Asian vegetables we have available in this city why they have to resort to broccoli--too many Vietnamese eateries do this.  Their dishes would be so much better if they'd use napa or Chinese broccoli at least.  And the keep removing entrees from their blackboard.  The food is good since there isn't another Vietnamese eatery real closeby (the bun mi shop in Embarco 5 sucks! threw out 2 sandwiches from there (I think it's called LIttle Saigon?)).  The other pho place, Soup Junkie, on Market has closed.  Oh me, oh my.  Good thing I have a few good Vietnamese places near home, just wish I could get my fix while at work too.

Just the right amount of spicy.\n\nGrilled pork with vermicelli and egg rolls are super delish as well.\n\nSo glad I found this place, I come here atleast twice a week now.", "author": "Anon Y."}

Had their Spicy Beef Noodle Soup.. they gave a lot of noodles, not so much beef.. the beef was not the rare beef ones you would have with pho, but instead the ones you would have when eating chow-mein..I'm ok with that, but would prefer to have rare beef instead.. also, the soup was really spicy which was great!", "author": "Linda Y."}

I had the spicy chicken noodle soup and it was just what I needed for a cold day.  The broth is delicious and the portions are pretty big.  It is definitely one of my favorite go-to noodle soups for lunch and I plan on coming back again.", "author": "Connie D."}

You probably want to leave your skittish non-Asian friends back at the office though.  Keep aesthetic standards low, but food overall tastes good.", "author": "Jon S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-12-21", "description": "I hate to write such a poor rating for a new Asian fast-food restaurant in the financial district.  I think the concept of a multi-Asian food restaurant, mostly Vietnamese and Chinese food, is great, especially in the finacial district, but the execution was not so good.  I waited for at least 25 minutes to get my take-out order, chicken chow mein, and there were two other people who had ordered the same item waiting before me.  After hearing the person behind the counter say that the wait would be at least 15 minutes for chicken chow mein to another customer, I asked them how much longer my order would take.  You would think that if so many people were ordering the same item, the cook would make a bigger batch to give all the people waiting for that dish.  They finally came out with my order, but the other person who had been waiting before I ordered had been waiting for 35 minutes already, and he was still waiting after I left.  The food was not too good either.  The chicken was tender but the noodles had a very smokey burnt flavor to them.  The other disturbing thing is there was a piece of hair in the bag my food came.  Going forward, if I am in the mood for Asian food, I will just look to Pho Hoa or Stone Korean Kitchen which is fairly fast to take out and tastes good.", "author": "Lisa M."}
