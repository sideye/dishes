The ceilings of the bar and seating areas were adorned with glowing red lights creating a scene Natural Born Killers-esque, yet without the psychotic main characters.

I stay off the road as a favor to those around me. \n\nThe bartender was nice and service was fast, but I think they really need to give the customer more bang for their buck. \n\nThere's an old school arcade game in the back room, all the way in the corner, but don't waste your quarters.

If you're here during drinking hours, it may be hard to find a place to sit down since there aren't that many seats.\n\nI like the big 500 Club sign outside.

I live in the Mission and my best friend lives in the Castro, so I walk home a lot with my dog and end up here halfway home usually for a pee break and a beer. It's super dog friendly, which is great because my dog is almost my constant companion. Tonight I dropped in like usual, around 11 pm, booked it to the ladies room and then headed out with my small leashed dog to order a beer. Now, when you're at a bar with your dog and you see other people at the bar with their dog, especially here in the city you assume the dog is nice, and the dog owners are smart enough to know if their dog can handle this type of social situation. This guy had his bull terrier in a choke chain and when I rounded the bar his dog firmly clamped its massive jaw onto my dogs neck. And held on. We both fell to the ground trying to loosen this dogs grip from my dog for what seemed like five minutes straight. The entire ordeal was stressful and bloody. In the end it was the dog owners blood and he started immediately making excuses. I just wanted his information. I was shaken up and adrenaline rushed and I treated it like a car accident. The guy's friend even had the nerve to step in and berate me for overreacting. The dog owner kept shoving his bloody hand in my face like it was my fault, and look at how he was hurt. He said things like \"my dog would be dead if it wasn't for me. \" Fine! How is that my dog's fault?! My dog is seemingly fine for now, thankfully. Can you believe I left the bar and they stayed and drank more? The bartenders watched me leave, and watched other people with dogs leave because they feared their own dogs safety. The guy with his fucked up aggressive ass dog were not asked to leave? Nope, no one cared and the shitty dog owner with his dog got to stay. It's not the dog's fault. Not the bars fault, but someone should have asked him to leave. Leave your aggressive and dangerous dogs at home to avoid these situations, they are scary and fucking uncomfortable.

The main room of the bar was packed. It was hard to even order my drink, and finding a seat in there was out of the question.\n\nLuckily, there's a second room.

(hugs me) because i love you.  i LOVE you.\"\nfriend ron: \"i'm scared.\"\n\nThis went on for about 45 minutes.  Other people would wander over and chat with us and hot wasted chick would decide whether they were a \"stupid blonde\" or a \"smart brunette\" and if they were blonde (like me), they were only allowed to talk to other \"stupid blondes.\"  Finally, right before they left, hot wasted chick was like, \"So, are you blonde or brunette?\"  And I'm like, \"Ummm, I'm gay.\"  And she perks up, hugs me, grinds her punani into my knee, says good-bye and leaves.

It was very stinky in here, and everyone seemed to have smelled it.  Best way to describe it was what I heard one guy say, \"Dude, what's the smell? Smells like ass.\"  Ha!  I really think it's just beer and other cocktails that spilled on the carpet that was making the whole place smell like a sex club.  I don't like it.  Everyone seem so cliquey and into themselves.  I loved the fireplace, the pool tables, jukebox and cheap bottled PBRs :-)!\n\nI would never go back here again unless I am forced to because there are so many other bars that I like better in the Mission.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the experience of having to try a new bar and spending time with some really cool people.

The bartender was more than willing to give it a shot even though it wasn't a familiar drink.  They mixed a good one, cause our pal Angelo has become a fan.  In case you were wondering, Tikibar is a free podcast that's easy to find and the drink is as follows:\n\n    * 1 1/2 oz Gin\n    * 1/2 Bourbon\n    * 3 oz Gingerale\n    * 1/2 Lime\n    * Sprig of Mint\n\nEnough of that.

I have been told that, Friday, during an impromptu pub crawl involving me, my brother and his wife, and 2 of their friends, I led the group here.  I remember happy hour at Chaya, where I had about 6 drinks and left feeling good.  I remember dinner at Tokyo Go Go, where Wifey, me, my brother and his wife split a bottle of sake.  I remember Wifey leaving us after dinner, because she had to work the next morning.  I remember going to Elixir, and having a few more drinks there, which is when my brother's 2 friends joined us.  I remember going to The Phoenix in search of food, only to be told that their kitchen closes at 11 (admittedly, it was later than 11).  I remember portions of our meal at Taqueria La Cumbre, where I engaged in a burrito-eating contest with my brother (the challenge consisted of eating exactly 1 burrito).  I have been told that, after the burrito challenge concluded in my favor, my brother and I engaged in a college-educated-white-boy battle rap throw down, wherein I apparently performed well enough to achieve Living Legend status in the eyes of my brothers friends.\n\nThese things, I remember (save for the battle rap).  I have no reason to dispute the notion that we also went to the 500 Club.  I remember wanting to go.  I realize that it is located geographically between Elixir and The Phoenix.  I have vague recollections of a bar decked out all in red.  But not...exactly what one would call memories.  I have been told that, shortly after arriving at the 500 Club, my brother and I began loudly calling for Jaeger Bombs, a drink that I actually abhor.  Thankfully, the bartenders knew better than to accede to our demands.  Apparently.  I have been told that my brother and I stood in the middle of the bar, with our arms wrapped around each other, deep in private conversation.  I remember snippets of conversation with my brother, including at least one bit of fascinating information that I remember clear as day.  But I can't say that I wholly remember the 500 Club.  Although, if their bartenders cut my brother and I off, as I'm told they did, then I salute the place.\n\nSome people, maybe even many people, perhaps even most people, would consider this entire episode something to be ashamed of.  But those people still have a healthy dose of self-respect, and I lost my last vestiges of that years ago.  Makes for funnier stories.  And the occasional formal, written apology letter or court summons.\n\nWhile my memory of the 500 Club may be fuzzy, and rounded at the edges, my memories of Saturday morning are sharp and distinct.  And while I may not remember everything I should about the 500 Club, I remember enough to be glad that my discussions with my brother didn't cause me to lead the group to the Elbo Room.  I make a lot of mistakes (midnight burrito with extra-hot sauce???  What was I thinking??), but there's a line between excess and the intentional infliction of injury.

Lured by tales of $3 flavored vodka drinks a few intrepid members of Team CM wandered in on a Monday night, and while the drinks weren't disappointing (not to mention mind-bogglingly cheap), unlike Rudy's the place seemed a bit too aware of its own kitcsch factor to be really welcoming.  I skipped the flavored vodka and went for my usual dirty vodka martini, which got me a brief look of confusion (judgment?) from the bartender.  It was fine.  The real discovery of the night (on my part anyway) was this lovely bi-colored drink called a Snake Bite consisting of Guiness and Pear Cider.  Who knew?", "author": "Sam P."}

Add this to the stiff drinks and the good selection of beers on tap (Trummer Pils, Prohibition) and we've got ourselves a winner.  Did I mention you can get $2 bottled PBRs 24/7 (happy hour is every hour, bitch)?  There's an ATM next to the jukebox, making sure you don't have to go stumbling around the mission looking for one.\nThe pool table is pretty crowded but a fun choice, considering it seems you can get a game in without running into too many pros.  The pinball machine in back is decent, although the big draw there is that the bartenders are pretty polite about giving out quarters even if you don't order a drink.   The photobooth in the back is legendary although lately it seems to have a spotty record when it comes to consistent service.  Head down a few blocks to Mission and you can grab a late burrito at Taqueria Cancun.\n\nThere are a few minor cons, the most obvious being that this place can get ridiculously crowded in a hurry and getting to the bathroom after 11pm can be a task.

I like the fact that the bar is accessible from two sides, which usually means being able to get a drink faster.  They usually have two bartenders on hand, which is also a good thing.   The bar itself has a good selection of midlevel type booze.  The drinks themselves don't stand out for being particularly any outstandingly good or bad quality, but at least they aren't expensive.\n\nSometimes they play good music on the jukebox and the place is dancing to the point where it almost resembles a club.

But come here with friends and it's a great place to hang out.  It's a beer kind of place though.

MORE RIDE CYMBAL! i quit when people started to stare. ahemmm...will be back when it's less crowded (if that's at all possible).", "author": "Oleya P."}
