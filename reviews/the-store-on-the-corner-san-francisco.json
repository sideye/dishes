The store's pretty small and doesn't have much seating - but it's a great spot for a quick lunch! \n\nI ordered their kimbap for $5 and it came with around 9-10 pieces (I forgot how many I ate before taking the picture). One kimbap wasn't filling enough for lunch, but works as a snack. I loved the filling because it balanced each other really well. I especially liked the radish since it was a great texture/taste with every bite. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back and would order their bibimbap next time since that seems like it has a larger portion size.", "author": "Aileen J."}

Since this place was so small and hidden, I assumed that it would taste more authentically homemade. Menu items such as Japchae and rice dishes were a little under $10. Everything is served in plastic to-go boxes. This place is super convenient if you are looking for a quick lunch. \n\n[ Kimbap ] I paid $5 for a roll of about 9 pieces. The rolls were very neatly made, but I thought the flavor of the beef was a little dry. I have definitely had kimbap for much cheaper prices but I was still happy with my experience here!

It comes with veggie japchae, side of bulgogi rice, and side of garden salad. Each section was sweet and savory. But I kinda wish the japchae had a little more substance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-03", "description": "Even though the area around New Montgomery and Mission is canvassed with a wide range of awesome eateries, The Store On The Corner was one of the places I was most excited to try.  I had heard from friends about the random convenience store that sells Korean food and I was immediately intrigued (you know me and Korean food...).  As it turns out, it's only a block from my office!  Too bad the food wasn't as interesting as I had hoped though...\n\nGiven their small size and unassuming appearance, it's easy to pass this place without even realizing it.  However, if you're looking for Korean food in the area, this might be your best bet.  The menu doesn't have a ton of options, but it still offers a decent variety to choose from, whether you're looking for a BBQ rice plate (Bulgogi, Spicy Pork, Chicken Bulgogi), Japchae, Kimbap, Korean tacos, and even Soon Doobu.\n\n-- KIMBAP ROLL - Korean Seaweed Roll with Beef, Rice, and Vegetables...$5\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-store-on-the-corner-san-francisco?select=-Z9QK9606Oqjz23AZ2qi1A)\nI might have upgraded my rating to four stars If it wasn't for this.  While I liked how the kimbap was decently filled (just just all rice) and wasn't at all bland, the latter was also the problem, as the beef was incredibly salty.  Plus, at $5, this was pretty pricey, unlike their lunch plates.\n\n-- JAPCHAE-BAP - Clear Vermicelli Noodles with Rice, Beef, and Salad...$10\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-store-on-the-corner-san-francisco?select=IJQmUnIstHye9nXOv-tj6Q)\nBy no means as good as regular Korean restaurants, but not bad for what it is!  The japchae in particular was pretty solid - well seasoned and well cooked.  As for the beef, there definitely could have been more of it, and some pieces were a little dry, but I liked it for the most part. \n Pretty good!\n\n-- SPICY PORK PLATE - Marinated Spicy Pork with Rice, Kimchee, and Salad...$10\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-store-on-the-corner-san-francisco?select=K-yi9yvPeKBZx82OdK2f5g)\nI thought I would have preferred this one (Spicy Pork is my go-to for Korean BBQ), but I thought the Japchae Bap was better.  Not to say this was bad, just that the marinade didn't pack a ton of heat and the pork wasn't as juicy or tender as I would've liked.  Plus, having some japchae would've been nice to mix the flavors up.\n\nIf I could, I'd go with their THREE AND A HALF STAR average, but I rounded down because of the Kimbap.  It's just so hard to get past how salty it was!  It was even more disappointing since kimbaps are one of my favorite Korean foods to eat.  Still, they do their lunch plates fairly well, they're convenient (to me, at least), and they get you in and out of the door really quickly.  For those reasons, I'd definitely come back with the Korean craving strikes!", "author": "Mike L."}

Nice texture and flavor in the noodles. The bulgogi beef is well-seasoned but maybe a little dry. Folks are really nice and they get you in and out of the store with your food fairly quickly. \n\nLunch averages around $10 and as mentioned before, portions are generous so you have more than enough for lunch but given how satisfying and comforting the food is, don't be surprised if you finish it all.", "author": "Jon L."}

This is one of the many wonderful hidden gems I've come to discover in SF.\n\nI've been making the decently long lunch walk out here for a month or two whenever the Free Food chatroom at work has disappointed. It's a very small shop with your typical convenience store goods ranging from candy to drinks to cigarettes. There are two counter seats by the window but otherwise, there really isn't any place to sit down. Their menu is very simple with items such as Bi Bim Bop, Jap Chae, Kim Bop, and Soondubu.\n\nWhat makes this place special is not from intricate flavors, clever plating, or high quality ingredients, but from the homemade taste of it all. The food here does not taste like restaurant Korean food. It tastes like the food I would get from going to a Korean friend's home for dinner where their mom is consistently saying, \"Eat more! You're still a growing boy!\". There's simply an element of comfort to their food that is very difficult to explain in words.\n\nI typically order the Bi Bim Bop which comes with rice, a bunch of vegetables, your choice of meat, and spicy sauce on the side. It's a well portioned dish that doesn't leave you thirsting for water afterwards as it does at other places. A fried egg can be added on top for a small extra charge. The item to die for here is the Bulgogi Chicken. I usually arrive here around 12:30pm and it is almost always sold out by that time. It's that good. The bulgogi chicken plate comes with salad, kimchi, and rice. The kimchi is definitely homemade as with everything else and has both a nice crisp texture to it and a solid mixture of acidity and spiciness. The bulgogi chicken is very moist and has a unique marinade to it that is just out of this world. It's an excellent pick-me-up lunchtime meal for a long workday. =]", "author": "Joshua M."}

It's like the bunny slopes of Korean cuisine: a rice bowl with lots of veggies, thinly sliced beef, an egg, and hot sauce. Despite it coming from the back of a liquor store, the flavors are great and the ingredients are fresh.

If not for the signboard (and even with the signboard), it's not a place you would normally notice. In fact, it's rather unassuming, and you can walk past it countless times and not even realize it. For the most part, it's all in the name. It's just your average corner store.\n\nBut it's not just a corner store.\n\nThe Store On the Corner is actually a to-go Korean place. They serve your basic Korean fair - bibimbap, rice plates, kimbap. I decided to get a dish near and dear to the heart of the Korean people - tacos.\n\nThe Korean tacos at the Store On the Corner are fantastic in a basic way. It's just a plain tortilla, some beef, straight from the Deep South cole slaw, and kimchi - in that order. For $4, it falls a bit on the pricy side, but $8 for two tacos is pretty darn cheap for what is a relatively light meal in San Francisco that isn't Subway. Unlike their rice plates, they don't charge tax on the tacos (or more likely, it's built in the price - a practice other businesses really should follow).\n\nI've heard good things about their chicken bulgogi (and it allegedly runs out before noon), but I don't eat white rice, so I haven't had a chance to sample their other dishes. Should be worthwhile, however.\n\nThe food is overall decent, and while it may not necessarily be something that's really worth writing home about, the place itself is really a compelling place. It's a corner store that serves Korean food. What more do I have to say? It just has a certain personality that makes it a really unique place that's worth checking out, at least once.\n\nTIP: Heard really good things about their chicken bulgogi, but I imagine any dish is solid.", "author": "Brian L."}

For takeout lunch however, it's a winner. \n\nReviewing a convenience store is simpletons work, so I'll share only that they stock some normcore beers, smokes, and a deece selection of candy goods.\n\nWhat you're really interested in are the nine (count 'em) items up for luncheon grabs. If you're on a budget I can tentatively recommend the kimbap for $5, but otherwise you wanna aim for the big three (in no particular order):\n\n- chicken bulgogi with rice\n- spicy pork with rice\n- bibimbap\n\nEverything on the menu is solid, but these three are my favorite. The spicy pork won't kill you and it's got a bit of kick. The chicken bulgogi is hella tight, and the chicken is juicy.[1] Plus you get about 2 pounds of food for $9, so the value is strong. \n\nKiller spot for work lunch and best of all, the food comes out in a flash.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: KOR-NERing the market on bulgogi.\n\nMenu Readability: Written shittily in chalk above the counter. \n\nNeed to mention: Seems cash only but isn't cash only.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Sometimes I don't want to walk far for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Just over 99% of folks who inaugurate their factoids with \"pro-tip\" are liars because the are NOT professionals.

So heed this Pro-Tip\u2122: you must show up before noon to get the phenomenal chicken bulgogi. \n\nYou will note how this pro-tip differs from the usual hoi polloi cacodoxy coughed up in Yelp reviews. This is crucial, specific, and potentially meal-changing advice, that I have gleaned from bitter experience.

Aside from that the egg was not really fresh fried, merely fried in the morning, and kept warm on a steam plate. Obviously by the time I got to it, the egg had been overcooked. Watered down gochujang for spicy sauce wasn't appealing. The only saving grace was the variety of banchan, albeit topping the mound of rice underneath. \n\nWhile better than the other Korean spot I've had in the fi-di, K-Asian Korean food will not be a spot I frequent.", "author": "Eric A."}

How would you know?...you don't know me. It's the one where Jimmy Stewart plays a Hungarian music shop employee and...oh, you don't care. And it has zilch to do with this modest operation except the name is sorta the same. But this one is actually on the corner, and there are no Russian music boxes being sold here, no quaint characters having secret pen-pal romances like between the cashier here and the sandwich maker next door at Lee's Deli. Actually, how the hell would I know?\n\nAnyway, I had no idea that they have a little Korean kitchen in the back of this liquor store until Jamie W. informed me. It's made up of big rice steamers (the kind my mama would have killed to have) and piping hot pots of homemade Korean fare that the woman just puts together in a plastic container, so you can just pay and go away (see photos). I went for the $6.45 Bi Bim Bop (see photo) - even though they were running a special on spicy pork that day. I had a meeting scheduled right after, so I did not want to risk an extrusion if you should pardon the expression.\n\nIt was no culinary masterpiece, just home cookin' at its most comforting when you're looking for mama-san goodies. What brings it up a notch is the hot sauce that comes with it. It has a smoky barbecue edge to it that really makes the bop bop if you know what I mean. I brought it over to the solarium at 55 Second Street, my favorite free public space in the immediate vicinity, as you eat among the office workers and bike messengers taking a break from their humdrum lives where they don't have the benefit of my bowl of bi bim bop. They can bop to their own food as long as they don't infringe on my bop. A bop is a very personal thing.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...bop 'til you drop from the sauce\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...well, it's a liquor store\nSERVICE - 3 stars...hey, it comes fast...no complaints\nTOTAL - 4 stars...reasonable lunch option where an arm and a leg do not have to be sacrificed...unless they need it to simmer in the bop", "author": "Ed U."}

Most of the food seemed like sub-par versions of what you can get at restaurants.  The one shining item, bulgogi hot dog, is apparently off the menu for good so little remains to warrant the trip.\n\nSoft Tofu Stew: Maybe they called it soft because that's what the package said at Safeway?  I know it was mass-marketed tofu because I saw the spoon resting in the old tofu container.  If the tofu is not silky and soft, almost like scrambled eggs, it's a very bad start to soft tofu stew.  There was one shrimpy shrimp with it's head and all in the stew.  Not only miserly, but the whole small shrimp is bad idea in the messy red broth.  Lots of mushrooms which were nice actually.  The broth was too bland.\n\nKimchi: Definitely homemade since it tasted like it was barely fermented.  Almost raw cabbage with spices is ok, but I prefer the more pickled variety.\n\nBulgogi: Tasted stewed/steamed rather like \"fire meat\" with the crisp edges.  I realize the small space constraints, but still not that great.\n\nBulgogi Hot Dog: This *used* to be my reason to come here until I was informed they no longer serve it ever.  Apparently it took too long... must be laziness over customer service reasons since I've never seen long lines to begin with.  This dog *was* good with decent bulgogi on a big thick frankfurter.

It smells like kim chee.\" Embarrased again, I closed the door to my office and finished my meal in silence.\n\nThe bulgogi was decent, but not great. The kimchi was quite good, though not as potent as it smelled (I think the heat from the rice and the broth from the bulgogi intensified it). The rice was soggy, like it was cooked with too much water and/or it sat in the warmer for a long time, but was far from inedible. Overall, the meal was A-OK given the price. Will I return? Maybe.

What started out with a couple slow cookers in the back behind the register with a makeshift kitchen has taken over much of the space and displaced most of the racks of junkfood and booze.  A literal mom and pop joint, in the heart of SOMA.   They've recently put those nice big walls and high ceilings to use hosting local art.  The menu has slightly expanded sine the old days of just bibimbap, japchaebap and bulgogi, but i still stick to those most of the time.    They have an ATM and still stock a minimum of basic convenience store stuff.  If this place were in Brooklyn or Silverlake or Portland there would probably be a line around the corner and down Minna every day at lunch.", "author": "Scott F."}

It's got just the right combination of crunchy vegetables, savory meat, seaweed, and that delicious red sauce.\n\nCombine that with the fabulous liquor store ambiance and you've got a winner.  What I mean to say is, you definitely feel like you found a hidden gem when you walk into the back of this tobacco store and get a steaming bowl of delicious food handed to you.\n\nThe bulgogi, I must confess, was less exciting.  While it did come with kimchee (the bibimbap is noticeably lacking in kimchee), it just didn't have the combination of flavors and textures that make the bibimbap the star.  That said, this place is just so darn fun to walk into (and out of) that I've gotta give it four stars.", "author": "Alex P."}

There are very few Korean alternatives in the financial district area so if you're craving some Korean food (and don't want to feel like you got robbed - like at some Korean places within a mile of this place) definitely a place to checkout. Just to be clear the three rating is to say that this place is good and worth a checkout.", "author": "H C."}

The beef was well-marinated, but a little overcooked (which is understandable because they need to keep it warm over time.)  The rice was also a little wetter than I prefer.

I first noticed this little convenience store yesterday when me and my coworkers were walking over to Yerba Buena for bowling and I saw a random sign outside of it on the street that said \"Korean Food\", etc. I thought it was interesting so I Yelped it today and decided to try it out for lunch with my Korean food-obsessed bf Derrick D. =P\n\nWe ordered the chicken bulgogi, the bibimbap, and some japchae. We were served by this Korean lady who was really nice.\n\nChicken bulgogi - This came with a side salad and dressing as well as kimchee (but unfortunately she ran out when she got to us). The rice and chicken were both nice and piping hot...the chicken was well flavored and very tender. She added some kind of sauce on top of everything which made the rice kinda soggy though. It was all pretty good and the portion was filling!\n\nBibimbap - This was mainly Derrick's dish but I got to try some of it. It looked like a typical bibimbap dish (minus the egg)...there were the assortment of veggies, beef, and a side of spicy Korean sauce. The only downside was that it was kinda cold so remember to microwave it if you decide to get this...the right spice and flavors were there though.\n\nJapchae - Like the bibimbap, this was also a little colder than I would have liked but it's nothing you can't fix. The portion was large and was really tasty overall with lots of noodles, mushrooms, green onions, and cabbage.\n\nThose 3 items and 2 bottled drinks for $23! Super cheap...will be coming back next time I have a craving! I also love the originality of the store name lol", "author": "Karen Y."}

Though of questionable legality, it might be the only source of Korean food north of the county line where the prices don't double after lunch. A more recent development is the addition of a \"Korean BBQ Hot Dog\" to the menu, which is a foot-long covered in bulgogi. The very concept of a hot dog whose sole condiment is more meat is so brilliant and so obvious that I wonder why it took more than a century of putting sausages in bread for mankind to figure this out.
