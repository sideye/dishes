My go-to spot to take friends visiting for authentic taqueria-style food.\n\nPancho Villa's menu (their vegetarian friendly items) overwhelms me every time I stop by, but I can't help but always pick their nachos, and cheese quesadilla. The flour tortillas are SO good, and the nachos have the perfect bean and cheese distribution. I recommend making it a \"super\" so you get all the key toppings (sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo).\n\nThe line is almost always out the door, but it moves fast, and the people sitting at the table tend to wrap up quickly, so you're never stuck holding your food without a place to sit. It's like this unspoken camaraderie that each patron understands the time it takes to find a table, so you do your part by eating your food, and moving on quickly. \n\nThe only wrench is the amount of smoke that's in the restaurant, but you tend to get over it pretty quickly. That said, if you're there for more than 30 minutes, be prepared for your hair and clothes to smell.\n\nDon't waste your time getting overwhelmed by all the taqueria's in the Mission - just head straight to Pancho Villa.", "author": "Sejal D."}

Unfortunately, their experiences were not similar.\n \nWe came in on a Sunday night. The restaurant was bustling and there was a line, just like last time. My friends got in line and ordered their burritos. A few minutes later, one of my friend's number was called for her chicken burrito. She was going to wait to eat it at home after my friend received his order. Nearly 30 minutes go by before my other friend received his burrito. How is that possible, when they ordered basically the same thing at the same time?\n\nThe disappointment doesn't end there. We noticed on my friend's receipt that the restaurant charged 25 cents for his little to go bag. And my other friend, well, her chicken burrito had no chicken in it! Unfortunately, not much could be done as she didn't discover it until she got home (on the opposite side of town).\n\nOverall, their food is delicious but the service is iffy.

It has an open kitchen so you can have a look for yourself. \n\nI ordered the super burrito with carne asada. When the burrito arrived, the first thing I did was to pat it with my hands because it was hefty and made me excited. It passed the \"can it stand upright on its own?\" test too. The initial bite was great, but was soon met with the slightly soggy crunch of lettuce. NO burrito should EVER have lettuce. It becomes a soggy mess with the heat of the meat. And if it doesn't become soggy it means your burrito is COLD. Throw extra onions and cilantro in there instead if you must add \"filler\". \nFor this reason (the lettuce) and the fact that the meat was a bit dry, I had to knock some stars off. I think if I ordered it with no lettuce I'd have a different experience. Oh, also their Spanish rice has peas in it. \n\nAnyways. If you upgrade something to \"super\" make sure to leave out the lettuce (this includes quesadillas as well). The salsa verde with avocado is great though!! \n\nService here exceeds a typical Mexican joint. At the time of my visit, there was a doorman (who opens the door for you obviously) which was a nice surprise. Plenty of staff, cooks, cashiers, bussers, and food runners.

My first thought was that it was the wrong buritto so I ripped open the foil and yup, I saw a whole wheat wrap. So I took my burrito home and cut it open...\n\nWhat I found was beans, lettuce, cheese, rice, and guac. There was BARELY any carnitas, maybe three pieces. Where I cut the burrito for the cross-section photo there happened to one little piece. This might as well been a rice and beans burrito. For a base price of $10.49, this was a complete rip off. I doubt I will ever come here again. Instead, I'll stick with my normal order at El Farolito. \n\nFYI, they also charge extra 69 cents for whole wheat (which I didn't see listed anywhere) and 25 cents for the paper bag when you get it to go.

Because it was Father's Day and my brother-in-laws favorite meal is Mexican food, I was hoping he would have taken us to a taco truck. But no such luck.  Instead, the last 1-hour, for dinner, before heading to the airport, was spent at his favorite Mexican restaurant, Pancho Villa Taqueria.\n\nPancho's is in the Mission district.  Back in 2002, I had a somewhat of a frightening experience in the Mission.  So I was dreading going into that part of the city.  No matter how much gentrification and rehabilitation this part of town is going through, I the incident is so clear to me that it felt like it just happened a few hours ago.\n\nSunday, wasn't to bad in the city.  Although we had to park 3 short blocks away, we were able to find parking rather quickly.  And I wasn't too fearful walking to the restaurant because my husband was with me.  But he made damn sure that I wore my purse as a crossbody instead of my usual left shoulder.\n\nWe walk into the restaurant and this place is busy.  Most tables were full.  Many families were there enjoying dinner.  Plenty of people waiting for their orders to be completed.  So that means, we are at the tail end of the rush.  \n\nI chose the chicken flautas plate, while my brother-in-law got his usual three tacos with prawns, my husband and sister got the super burrito. So although my husband checked in on Yelp to use the $2 off deal on the super burrito, they didn't apply it.  A negative but not enough to ruin our family time together.  My brother-in-law asked my sister how much his tacos were. I can't remember how much it was, but they charged $1 more for the prawns for each of his tacos.  When we told him the price, he was shocked.  Later he says, during the weekdays, they have \"happy hour\" where those same tacos are cheaper.  \n\nWhat was free you ask? Chips and salsa bar.  The chips were made fresh and was really good.\n\nBecause I did not grow up on Mexican food, I thought it was good, not spectacular, but good.  My husband and sister could only finish half of their super burrito. And because we were flying home, we gave all of our leftovers to the sister, even if she kept trying to push it on me to take it home.\n\nAnd although I don't believe we did anything wrong, one of the cooks was mad dogging our table.  I chalk that up to being a cultural difference thing, but lucky my husband's back was facing towards them and of course I didn't tell him.  It would have been a bad situation and I didn't want to ruin a beautiful day.  Just watch your back if ever you go the Mission.", "author": "Edith S."}

I would come here for fresh, healthier-seeming home-style food on any regular day during the week, but not to satisfy my Mexican craving (if that makes any sense). \n\nWe thought the salsa bar was fun, but there ended up being nothing too amazing from the selection. \n\nOverall this place had decent food but was missing the Mexican flavors that I came here for.

Although the line was long, it was not an extensive wait with just paying after specifying your order and waiting a bit for your number to be called. There's an immense amount of aguas frescas which was awesome. I got my usual horchata which was tasty and thick with rice. I tried my acquaintance's strawberry drink which was extremely sweet. The nachos were nice with flavorful al pastor and it was nice getting salsa from the salsa bar which was large.

Incredible diversity in the choices on the menu, with plenty of different meats and styles of those meats along with tons of veggie options. \n\nTo continue the amount of options, the toppings bar in the back has at least 5 different salsas and all sorts of toppings (lime, onions, greens, etc) so there is never a need to ask the staff for more of a certain type of item. \n\nIn addition, each order gets a side of fresh tortilla chips, which often costs extra at other places or isn't included in to-go orders. I'm super thankful for this because it makes trying all the different salsas much easier!\n\nIt's constantly packed, but the 10+ people on staff handle the long line really well and keep things moving to get to-go orders in and out the door in under 15 minutes. \n\nMy favorite part is the price, since many other places cost upwards of 13 dollars for a super burrito. Here, it's only $10.25. \n\nMost of the time when we go we get a super veggie burrito with refried beans and hot salsa for $8.25 and a  super burrito with carne asada fajitas, black beans, and hot salsa for $10.25.

Meat was tender and fatty, and you can see the pink (BBQ pink, not raw pink haha)  properly situated on the inside of the meat. \n \nUnfortunately, rice and everything else were lacking in flavor.

Having already checked out El Farolito and La Taqueria on previous occasions, I decided to go where the person which I was with at the moment wanted to go to, and this happened to be Pancho Villa.\n\nAs soon as you walk in to Pancho Villa, the first smell that will hit you is that of their carne asada. This, along with the recommendation of the friend I was with, solidified that I would be ordering a carne asada burrito. The line can seem daunting at first, and it can be quite annoying when you are starving in line waiting with what seems to be hundreds of workers in the kitchen yet there you are, still in the same spot fifteen minutes later...\n\nDespite the mess that is their ordering system, I eventually got to the front of the line and ordered for my friend and I- it turned out to be $25 for two carne asada burritos, two horchatas, and tip. Pancho Villa definitely gets one star for free chips and their extensive self-serve salsa bar. Try the orange salsa, you will not be disappointed!\n\nAs my experience with Pancho Villa was mixed up to this point, all depended on the burrito. After only having had one meal all day, I was more than excited to unwrap this burrito and eat it.\n\nHowever, I ended up being largely disappointed when it came to actually eating the burrito. Coming from a small town in which there is an abundance of Mexican food, I was confused when I noticed that the rice in Pancho Villa's burritos includes peas and carrots, ya know those peas and carrots that come with frozen rice? Yeah, doesn't seem very appetizing, right? This caught me off guard and honestly ruined the burrito for me. Pancho Villa's- if the rice in your burrito is going to include peas and carrots, please note so somewhere, anywhere, this is not custom in literally any Mexican establishment that sells food.\n\nI sadly will not be returning due to this.

The staff were courteous and friendly and got my order done quickly. The quesadilla while not the best I've had was certainly more then good enough to satisfy my late night craving. Had the right amount of steak and shrimp and was just cooked right, the right amount of cheese and crispness. Not my go to spot for Mexican eats but wouldn't pass it up if I were nearby and hungry.", "author": "Peter P."}

Located is the slightly sketchier side of the mission, this restaurant was happening!  Hipsters and Mexicans all gather here for lunch so it must be good. \n\nWe ordered the taco combo, which is 8 dollars for three tacos I believe, and a super burrito to share amongst two people. If you check in on yelp, the super burrito is 2 dollars off. What a great deal!  The super burrito came with meat, we got carne asada, choice of beans, we chose black beans, rice, pico de gallo salsa, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. You can choose spicy or mild salsa. We got spicy but honestly we couldn't even really taste it. \n\nFor the tacos we got lengua, al pastor and carnitas. Tacos came with beans and salsa. The tacos are really big and its juicy so it's a little hard to eat. You gotta use both hands and some utensils to manage it. The lengua was really good!  Super tender and moist meat. The al pastor had the best flavor. It was the most flavorful meat compared to the rest including the carne asada. The carnitas was good. Wasn't dry or too fatty, but it was my least favorite meat out of the four. \n\nThe super burrito was great. Loved the Guac and the sour cream combo. Normally I don't like beans too much but I didn't mind it in this burrito. With every meal they give you complimentary chips. There's also a Sala bar with many varieties!   Becareful as some are super super spicy!  I'm not sure of the names because it was labeled but I pretty much got one of each. Taste it first before you douse it onto your food!", "author": "Suzanne W."}

The lettuce and fixins of the super burrito detract from the flavor and there was hardly any meat inside -- it was mostly rice, beans, and lettuce. Really disappointing. This place does have a cool salsa bar, and strangely a large selection of beans (black refried, pinto, plain refried) for your burrito? It's also cleaner than places like El Farolito, but let's be real, we're not here for clean seats. \n\nTL;DR if you're craving Mexican you'll have better luck elsewhere in the Mission.

From burritos, tacos, tamales, nachos, quesadillas, they are all reasonably priced for their big portion sizes. They also have aguas frescas and churros!! For each order, you get a small side of tortilla chips. There's also a salsa bar in the back and you can use their little menu on top to determine what they are and the level of hotness! My favorite is the salsa verde as many other places cannot compare to it!\n\nIt can get quite crowded at night and there's a security guard at the door. Your receipt number is called and it gets pretty hard to hear it due to the noise level. However, tables can also open up pretty fast. \nTake advantage of their offers on Yelp.

I did go to this Pancho Villa Taqueria couple times and I was revisiting it yesterday.  It was terrible hot every time I went to the restaurant 20 yrs ago and I was glad finally they got normal room temperature for the 20 mins I spent inside the restaurant yesterday.  After I got my favorite food meat burrito,it didn't taste as good as what my old memory serves me but it is not the big problem. The big problem is their restaurant staffs are racism. Every one got free chips after order is placed and paid. I got special meat burrito meal that is second most expensive meat burrito meal and they didn't bother to pass me free chips. I ended up the only Asian and Chinese guy in the restaurant and the only guy who didn't get any chips on his dining table. You may ask why don't I simply ask for it? Well it is like you going to a Chinese restaurant,every one got his/her tea without asking and their waitress just ignores you.  You don't want to be treated differently.  Same thing as what happened yesterday. Every one got free chips automatically after order is paid but except me.  All customers were either Mexican or white guys. I was the only asian guy. It was very obviously they didn't want to serve me.

They had burritos with different meats and also with different ingredients. My boyfriend had the super and I had the especial. They were both HUGE! Our tab with the coupon and 2 drinks was $22.

I ordered a super burrito with the green chile chicken (you know, the kind that sits in the deep pan, just chillin all day). While the tortilla was fine, solid rice, guac, etc., the chicken was really dry and I can't fathom why. \n\nThe ambiance reminded me of Mexico. Which I love.

This place had them AND they served them asada! Typically they serve it with pork only. It wasn't that spicy as I like them but it was refreshing to see this on a Mexican restaurant menu which I have NEVER SEEN! Oddly enough I had to travel 600 miles to get one . Minus two stars because the restroom was clogged with toilet paper & looked like the local homeless use it as a shower on the regular and of course the lack of parking.

Ten minutes later I was in hangry territory and decided to ask the cashier if they could just check to see if they had even been started, and if not to simply give me a refund. This kid refused and decided to instead take my order *again* on the back of my receipt that had my original order on it (???) Five minutes later I went to inquire again and urged them to just please give me a refund because at this point I had been waiting 35 minutes for some nachos and no longer even wanted them. This person didn't even say anything and just turned around and walked away...okay then. A few minutes later I finally got my food and got the heck out of there.

Had no idea this place was so popular, a group of seven of us came for a quick dinner before bowling on Friday and we were so lucky to miss the long line!\n\nFOOD- friend raved about the shrimp taco so of course I had to try it! The taco was nicely wrapped (to my surprise!) and filed with coleslaw, the few shrimps inside were crispy and bouncy, flavor was pretty good, but I was not wow'ed. On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised by the fish taco. The large pieces of fish was cooked just right, moist, and delicious with some salsa added on top. I can imagine that both tacos would taste better if I got it 'super' with avocado etc. I liked the fact that your order comes with free chips and you go to retrieve whatever/however much salsa from the back counter. Other friends ordered burritos and shrimp super tacos, which they enjoyed.\n\nSPACE- large brightly-lit space with lots of seating. The small stools make for a casual atmosphere but good luck if you have a large jacket that you took off because it was so hot/stuffy inside and hope for more luck if you also have a purse to carry and did not want to place it on the not so clean floor. :( Bathroom was not that clean and appeared to have flooded all over. We later found out that it was 'just cleaned'. Maybe someone just decided to pour water over everything- the toilet, toilet seat, toilet tank, and floors to 'clean it'. I would avoid using the bathroom if possible.\n\nSERVICE/PRICE- friendly staff and the ordering process was quick and easy. Line may get long, but it moves pretty fast. They take your order, you pay, they they prepare your food per your receipt/order. Shrimp taco was $3.50 and fish taco was $3. They are of decent size, but not quite enough to fill me up. The burrito was pretty large and obviously of more value.\n\nYelp check-in gives you $2 off any super burrito. They also have happy hour prices in the afternoon.

Yes, I've been to La Taqueria many times and know they were voted best burrito in America, but I think Pancho Villa wins on several fronts: price, meat, moistness of burrito, salsa, and they take credit cards. All pluses in my book.\n\nFirst, the burritos are totally reasonably priced. You can even get a baby burrito for $5.50 which is smaller, and then burritos will run $7 to $8.50 depending on if it has guacamole, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. They even have occasional coupons on Yelp for $2 off a Super Burrito (normally $8.50), which is a great deal. The size of the burritos are enormous. I eat a lot and couldn't finish an entire Super burrito. The difference between the burritos here and La Taq are that they have rice inside (which is flavored and has a little bit of veggies inside), and a wider selection of beans black and pinto refried beans, and whole beans. The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias. I also love the salsa bar, with around 10 options of salsa to pick from. They seem to have won a ton of awards on their salsa. La Taq doesn't give you salsas with your food, and it even sucks more when you get takeout there because there are no to-go containers for salsa.\n\nAnd lastly, seating is fairly abundant so you don't have to fight for tables. They also take credit card which is awesome since who carries cash anymore these days?\n\n5 stars all around for Pancho Villa. This one wins best burrito in SF for me!", "author": "Christina L."}

I was there Saturday afternoon, September 12th. It would be awesome if the tacos I had were not the norm. Some things to point out: the tortillas weren't cooked on the griddle, maybe steamed, but the moisture had dried out before I got them. I prefer tortillas warmed up in some kind of fat, personally. The carnitas were dry, the kind of dry that makes chewing through the mouthful feel like a commitment. The interior of the pork was not 'sweet'. The salsa on top was a sparse pico de gallo, that didn't do much to add moisture. The meat was definitely generously portioned, so that was nice.\n\nThe al pastor was similar in the above qualities (dry) but the main disappointment was the lack of flavor. Forgive my audacity, but can you improve your recipe? And perhaps you guys could set up a spit to cut the meat from? That might make them better and provide another reason for Pancho Villa to stand out. I'm definitely not an expert, but I have had enough pleasure derived from tacos to make me yearn for more.

Another word: zoo.\n\nThis place makes a mean guacamole dip and vegan burrito using Garlic Mushrooms.  The place gets CROWDED, so be prepared to have to vulture yourself a table.  Oh, and enjoy the loudness of not only the patrons but the cooks and kitchen equipment.  Enjoy watching the army of organized professional Latin order-takers and cooks in action as they move you from one specialized server along the assembly line to the other, each responsible for some part of your order: the first one does your taco/burrito/quesadilla order, the next one takes your drink order and extras, and the last hombre takes your money, scoops up your nachos, and give you a number.  All payment types accepted.  I love their diverse sugar-fortified juices: tamarind, watermelon, pineapple.... and their assortment of stereotypical Mexican beers. \n\nBut then there is the long wait for your order as you are squeezed between the salsa bar and the litany of other people, other hovering waiting customers and salsa bar dippers you bump into, squeezing-by and excusing yourself for being in the way.  There is really no place to stand which gets very annoying FAST.  The order always takes longer than you initially thought which is why it is a good idea to get your nachos and guacamole early and scavenge a seat away from a tiva-wearing granola hipster so you don't pay attention too much to the glacial order fulfillment pace.  If you sit down, the server will find you by calling your number while walking between tables.  Otherwise you have to endure the standing there in everybody's way routine.\n\nWhenever I walk out of there there is always a sense of relief as I exit back to a calmer world.   The food is great but tiring.  Just getting the server to get the details of the order in that noise is tiring.  Then waiting for the food more so. Is it all worth it - well, yes... every now and again, especially if you have someone in from out-of-town.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-01", "description": "Ah, the Mission District of San Francisco. \n\nThis was once a neighborhood for Latino immigrants and a hub for expressive bohemians. Borrowing from each other's experience and artistry, they created the resounding culture that is the Mission District today.\n\nThe murals are still around, and so are remnants of the sound and music that defined the Mission. But you look around and see that they are sandwiched by $4 lattes, Kale smoothies, and gluten-free breakfast. Holy smokes! Has the Mission gentrified into a new playground for those sweater-wearing, software-programming hipsters?!?\n\nToday I'm sitting down with Holden Caulfield at Pancho Villa Tacqueria. You may remember Holden from your high school literature class as a judgmental teenager upset with the world. Well, he hasn't changed much. Holden handpicked Pancho Villa for our meeting place because he claims it is part of a group of diminishing authentic eateries in the Mission. The appetizing smell of meat that hangs over the air convinces me that this is a good choice regardless.\n\n(So Holden, what makes Pancho Villa authentic? What is authenticity anyway?)\n\nHe pour a healthy dose of green salsa onto his Chicken Quesadilla as he answers.\n\n\"The most superficial, yet undoubtedly reliable indicator of authenticity is the lack of hipsters working in this establishment.\"\n\nI look over to the counter and realize at once that there are no hipsters to be found. Not one fedora. Holden smirks and continues.\n\n\"Authenticity cannot really be replicated, right? Or else it wouldn't be authentic. And I'm sure you've had better Mexican food than that delicious Al Pastor burrito you're holding because the Chef probably went on a Mexico pilgrimage to find out all there is to know about Tacos. I mean he knows exactly the right temperature to cook the meat and the exact amount of toppings to bring out the most flavor. Golly, he knows more about tacos than a majority of Mexicans probably.\"\n\nHe bites into the Quesadilla and lets the string of melted cheese linger from the tip of his mouth as he goes on.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, authenticity to a Mexican person is what grandma makes. Forget all the taco bullet points on the Chef's Macbook Pro because authenticity is whatever grandma decides that day. She might not even know half the stuff the Chef knows. And to me, anyone trying that hard to replicate something is well, kinda phony.\"\n\nAnd there it is, Holden's favorite word. Phony. I can't help but smile.\n\n(Okay Holden, but what's wrong with phony? This authentic burrito from Pancho Villa is unbelievably juicy and amazingly delicious, and so is that \"phony\" pork belly taco I had a couple of weeks ago. What is the problem?)\n\n\"The problem is that phony pork belly taco costs $10 a pop. Look, I am all about borrowing from other cultures and transforming it into something new, and maybe even something better. It's what makes America great.\"\n\nHolden pauses and opens up his receipt to show me his whole Quesadilla only costs $10. He resumes.\n \n\"But people have to realize that the community they are borrowing from do not have a strong presence in the 6-figure Silicon Valley circle. And if you have an ethnic restaurant with prices that are generally economically unrealistic for that particular ethnic group, then what the hell is that? It certainly IS NOT embracing that culture.\" \n\n(It sounds like we are getting into the topic of gentrification. The Mission was a rough place to be at 10 years ago. It is now a thriving and bustling neighborhood, and I'm sure even Pancho Villa is benefiting. Can't we give the hipster some credit?)\n\nHolden shrugs as if forced to agree.\n\n\"Yes, they deserve a lot of credit. And yes, I do love the Rebel Within and I may very well be addicted to Earl Grey ice cream and all, but for Chrissake they're driving out the community that makes the Mission the Mission!\"\n\n(But the increased rent prices is just Supply and Demand.)\n\n\"And I love it when economics come into play. I got axed from more prep schools than you'd like to know but I still remember what Externalities are. The people who are using Supply and Demand to justify evictions are neglecting costs that may not be measured right away. I mean, how the hell can you measure the cost of stripping an entire neighborhood of its essence? How would you measure your sadness if Pancho Villa's deliciousness got gentrified away?\"\n\nHe pauses, letting his argument linger with me like the taste of the fresh guacamole in my burrito. \n\n\"I think it's great that the hipsters are economically revitalizing the Mission and all. But instead of just living IN the community, it'll be great to see them live WITH them community.\"\n\n(And what do you propose they should do to accomplish this?)\n\n\"I don't know. But if these guys can figure out how to preserve all my net activities to data-mine me, they can figure out a way to preserve the culture in their neighborhood.\"\n\nWe laugh in agreement.", "author": "Ringo M."}

I've lived across the street from Pancho Villa for nearly five years, and it's my go-to place. I really do love the food there, and as someone in the neighborhood, it was great to have a quick place to grab a bite to eat. At all but the busiest times, I was able to order and receive my food in about 10 minutes.\n\nA year and a half ago, with the proliferation of food delivery apps, this became impossible. They fill so many orders for apps that it now takes 30 minutes or more to receive your food once you order. So I switched to ordering ahead using an app and picking it up myself. Tonight, that finally failed me: they didn't even start making my food until I asked them about it, well after it was marked in the app as ready for pickup.\n\nPancho Villa is a great taqueria, but they need to either staff up, expand, or take fewer orders from apps. If I can't get quick and reliable food there, I'll take my business elsewhere.", "author": "Bradley P."}

While most people probably gauge a Mission taqueria based on the quality of their carne asada burrito or tacos, I think Pancho Villa does carnitas best and you're better off ordering tacos. There are better places to order a burrito but if you order pork tacos, especially during happy hour, you'll be well satisfied since they're packed with flavor.\n\nIf you wish to change it up, fish/pescado option are available too and also being able to order fresh, non cold pressed juice for less than $10 is now a bargain in SF!\n\nClean restaurant & prep area, although there's such a high volume of customers coming in, the tables could be cleaned off faster.", "author": "Steven C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-25", "description": "I've been coming to Pancho Villa for over ten years.  After my experience there last night, I feel really sorry for the employees here.  Let me explain: There were only three people ahead of me in line.  I ordered ONE baby burrito to-go.  Guess how long it took? FORTY FOUR MINUTES! Yep, 44 minutes for one baby burrito. The employees here are clearly overworked. Had they warned me it would take this long I would have never placed my order.  It made me late for meeting a friend afterward and it was a stressful experience. \nThe owners have obviously decided to put profits ahead of customer service and their employees' well being.  They're accepting WAY too many online orders.  There were bags and bags of orders getting stacked up on the shelves meanwhile in-store customers and stressed out employees were getting the shaft.  \n\n***Edit: One thing I forgot to include in my original review is that when you use online apps to order your food for pick up and choose to leave a tip, that tip doesn't necessarily go to the workers!  I used the Eat24 app to order food from another restaurant.  When I picked up the food I asked the employee if they get the tips and they said NO.   I was really angry when I learned this because I had left so many tips before thinking it would go directly to the employees and not the owners. So, if you do use an online app, always leave your tip in cash in the tip jar onsite or hand it to the employee who hands you your food if there's no tip jar there!***\n\nThere was a huge crowd of customers waiting for food for what seemed like forever.  Right after I finally got my food, another customer starting yelling at the poor guy behind the counter that he wanted his money back because he was tired of waiting so long.  Shame on you owners for being so greedy.  Pancho Villa was so much better in the old days when the person you ordered your food from was the person who prepared it.  This always guaranteed that once you ordered, you'd always have your food within 5 minutes. Things really went downhill when they started their new system of taking orders from just one person and then the army of people behind prepares it.   The online ordering system has made things even worse. I recommend that if they want to keep accepting online orders, they return to their old method of taking in-store orders where the person you order from makes your food. This would prevent problems like last night happening and make me want to keep coming here.", "author": "Mike A."}

Among the closest to my work happen to be Pancho Villa and Los Coyotes. In all honesty, I try and avoid both because I've been disappointed the few times I've visited either taqueria. Nevertheless I'm always open to try them every once in a while to see if they've improved. My most recent visit was this past Monday during the lunch rush.\n\nI was surprised at just how busy Pancho Villa was, but given the assembly line infrastructure in place, you can expect the wait to be minimal. I do wish they would have paper menus near the entrance because the menu board is obstructed from the door giving you little time to decide on your order once its your turn. \n\nI typically always go with tacos but this week I decided on trying their torta. The Mexican sandwich consists of your choice of protein along with cheese, lettuce, tomato and salsa. I added a side order of rice and beans at $1.50 each for a half pint. The total came out to $9 and some change after taxes with no soft drink.\n\n10 minutes later my order number was up and I was handed my order and filled up at their salsa bar. Once back at my desk, I unwrapped the torta and it looked a little sad and beat up. Although it wasn't the most visually appealing torta, it still had a chance. After a few bites, my conclusion was that it was okay but not great. The bread was toasted nicely and had plenty of melted cheese and the pollo asado was surprisingly great. The lettuce and tomato didn't do much, but luckily I had plenty of salsas to try and add flavor.\n\nThe pinto beans and rice were fine and completed the meal. For $9 I was satisfied: a nice sized sandwich, beans and rice and chips and salsa. Pancho Villa isn't at the top of my list when I think of San Francisco's taquerias but when it's 2 blocks from your work and you have no lunch, it'll do just fine. \n\nAmbiance/Decor: 2/5\nFood: 3/5 \nService: 3/5\nPrice: $\nOverall: 3/5\n\nPros:\n+ All the usual staples: appetizers, burritos, tacos, nachos, quesadillas, etc.\n+ Torta sandwich with your choice of meat ($5)\n+ Generous portions and reasonable prices\n+ Great for lunch or late night\n+ Fast and efficient service\n+ Lots of seating\n+ Beer available\n\nCons:\n- Food is average at best", "author": "Alexander E."}

Sometimes I get the baby burrito (but I make it super because I want all of the other extra yummy toppings) and I can barely finish it. If I know I won't have time to cook that night I get a super burrito and that is enough for lunch and dinner. So. much. food. \n\nI also love love love their salsa bar. Many salsas to choose from and they also have lime wedges and radishes!! \n\nThe many different agua frescas from the traditional horchata and hibiscus to tamarind and guava. So delicious! and don't forget to get a churro for dessert (get a stuffed churro if they have any left! you won't regret it). \n\nThe only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because it gets super noisy. Super super noisy. If I'm there with a friend I can't really keep a conversation without walking out with a soar throat because we have practically been yelling at each other. Especially when they are chopping the meat. The guy with two huge butcher knifes chops away and the bang bang bang coming from that area is deafening. It's also really difficult to get a table and, most likely, you will have to clean the table yourself because the people before you were to lazy to clean after themselves.", "author": "Ezekiel G."}

Most places either don't carry them or they come as a full on dinner serving with beans, rice, salad, and costing in the range of $10-12... not something I'm aiming to pay when I'm swinging by for lunch and just want something in the range of a $6 burrito. Pancho Villa, on the other hand, is one of the places that does carry enchiladas a la carte, which comes with a small salad. You get two enchiladads (meat or cheese options) for a reasonable price of $7, which is a good serving size for lunch! I was absolutely over the moon when I was able to order exactly what I wanted and even more happy when it was delicious.\n\nThe restaurant itself was quite busy when we were there but the line moves quick. Ordering is done at the counter, then paid for, and a server will bring your food out to you since it will take some time for the order to be made depending on other orders ahead. There was a really good range of veggie options, including tofu, so vegetarians and vegans could easily find something worth checking out.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

There were a lot of people behind the counter so I thought this would be a quick in-n-out meal...NOT.  Despite there being about (6) women preparing the orders, (2) guys cooking and (2) women tending the register, it took eternity for my food to arrive.  I could tell this wasn't going to be good when a woman standing beside me was waiting for over 30 minutes and still others about the same or longer. I didn't understand why it took so long since there were so many people walking to and from behind the counter. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was ok.  It wasn't super great.  I've tasted better and I've lived in different cities in the Bay Area. I ordered a carnitas super burrito and a small aguas Fresca-cantaloupe. When I finally took my food home there were large chunks of carnitas in my burrito.

It's tough rating burrito in The Mission because the best burrito in America can be found there. It wasn't as good as some of the others I've had in the area but it was still delicious. What really made this location stand out to me was their salsa bar. They had more salsa than I could hope to try in one sitting. I actually want to go back just to try more of the salsa. Next time I'll probably try something else like a quesadilla. Again this burrito wasn't bad, it was very good, I just have a regular spot I go to that I think is better.\n\nDRINK: I didn't order any drinks while at Pancho Villa Taqueria so I can't speak much to what they offer. I'd assume it's the normal drinks you can expect at a taqueria like soft drinks, water, or beer.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Pancho Villa Taqueria had the standard vibe for a taqueria in The Mission. Tables are usually filled with people having conversation and there's music playing in the background. I did takeout so I wasn't around long enough for the atmosphere to really stick.\n\nSTAFF: The staff was friendly when taking my order. Since taqueria's serve in a fast food like style you don't really spend much time talking with the staff.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nIf this taqueria were located anywhere else in the country it would easily get a 5 star review. Unfortunately it has some steep competition being located in The Mission district of San Francisco.

There is a security guard at the entrance, which sets the precedent for the type of area you are in. This guard was actually really nice and did his job superbly, escorting a vagabond heckler out of the restaurant without causing a scene and also helping the staff out by cleaning the tables here and there. Back to the food though. The pricing here is super friendly to your wallet and it helps that the food is super delicious too. We were here for dinner on a Friday night and the place was very busy. Initially we had tried to order delivery through Eat24 and Grubhub, but both of these apps were not allowing us to order from here. We think that Pancho Villa ceases app orders during peak dining hours since they are already too occupied with the crowds. They were sporadically taking direct phone orders, so it can be hit or miss for that. I am glad we came in to dine here though because the smells in the air of the restaurant make the food taste even better. I shared the chicken fajita dinner plate, then we also ordered the vegetarian nachos, and carne asada dinner plate, as well as an XL fresa juice (strawberry juice). I did not try the juice, but heard that it was delicious. Getting the food to the table is a bit tricky since the place is so noisy and the ladies working here don't have loud enough voices to shout the order number over the roar of the diners. Even though there are 15 people working the shift, it is wise to stand near the end of the ordering line and wait for the food. It took about 15 minutes for them to get it ready, and we definitely got skipped over in line by the easier orders. It was all worth it in the end. They did give chips while we waited and the salsa bar they have is pretty legitimate. The green salsa had a kick to it, so be careful if you aren't one for spicy food. The meal itself was very tasty! I really liked the chicken because it was the right texture and seasoning. The Mexican rice was also very tasty and I ended up eating it all. Other stuff that came on the dinner plate was beans and a small salad. All of this ended up being plenty of food for two people. We did have to purchase one extra tortilla to finish up the fajitas though. Overall, an absolutely worth it taqueria to eat at in SF.

Born and raised in the Mission I've come across a lot of Mexican restaurants come and go over the years and Pancho Villa is a place where the food is great, but the service has been declining over the years. If I had to rate the food alone, this place gets a solid 3.5/5. Not to say this is \"authentic home made Mexican food\" but I can't lie and say this place isn't ok. I feel part of this is because the price is right. Nowadays you go to a Taqueria in the Mission, they'll charge you $10ish dollars for a REGULAR burrito while Pancho Villa has you covered for around $7. All these Taquerias became greedy since the Mission is getting gentrified with all these Hippies & Yuppies making good money, that they'll pay anything for some Mexican food. But that's what I appreciate about Pancho Villa, they've been pretty solid with prices, I guess depending on what you get. My go tos are Spicy Shrimp Dinner, Carne Asada Dinner, and Burritos/Quesadillas. They also have a very good Salsa Bar, around 10 or so different types of salsas catering to everyone's taste and heat tolerance. But these past years or so is when I really started to realize how rarely I've been coming back to this place, and here's why. They are literally busy all hours. At this point it doesn't even matter what time you come in for some food, it's always busy. Even when it's not busy, it takes about 15-20 min to get food in your hand AFTER ordering. So you're looking around 20-30 min of waiting for some food as soon as you step inside. That's ridiculous. And the weekends? It's awful. Everyone is here since there's about 15 bars around this area that it makes sense for everyone to gather around and get some food. But the real issue is, is that they started to do the whole order ahead business. Ever since these companies like Caviar, UberEats, etc. They get a ridiculous amount of orders coming in from all these apps, including the huge number of customers that come in person. I've also noticed that they seem to make the delivery orders a priority over the actual customers coming in. Kinda messed up but that's business for you. Shows you what money does, and how sometimes an app that seams like it's doing you a favor as a customer is actually hurting a really good business not in terms of sales, but that used to have great service all around.

It's 10:30 on a dark Thursday night, but mission locals choose this place for a late dinner after work.  The neighborhood could seem a bit sketch at first, but everyone minds their own business.  What matters is: not only do they open until late, they provide free chips, too! The best part is... the food is good!  They provide a variety of authentic Mexican food, sauces (orange, green, salsas), fresh fruit juices (ie. watermelon), and Jarritos.  They even have mini wedding cakes!\n\nI ordered a super quesadilla with pastor (bbq pork).  It was filled with a bunch of substance.  Got my guac, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, melted cheese--more than I imagined to be in a quesdilla.  I'm salivating as I'm describing it.  Not bad at all, especially if you're trying to avoid rice and beans for the night ;)  The rest of my party ordered burritos: meats vary from carne asada, chicken, or even vegetarian (tofu, no meat!).

The reason I came here wasn't reading Yelp reviews, but the Examiner's review that this place served the best prawn tacos. I was hoping they have a TV so I can watch the USA-Mexico game, but they don't have one. Besides the prawn tacos, which I ordered two of them, I also ordered the salmon taco, lengua taco, and the homemade guacamole. I agree with the Examiner's review that the prawn tacos are really good. What makes them special is they butterfly the shrimps which make the shrimp chunkier in the taco. The prawns had a buttery taste to them. The salmon taco is what I also recommend as they are tender and juicy. The other items where ok. If they have lengua as one of the meat choices then they should have tripitas and cabeza.

I opted for the most basic - beans, rice, lettuce, salsa - but next time I'll be more adventurous and order one with mixed vegetables. The beans, rice, and tortilla are solid and overall the food feels filling and fresh without leaving you feeling overly stuffed/greasy. You can tell that fresh ingredients are a priority here.\n\nPossibly one of the best things about Pancho Villa is their salsa bar. There must have been 8 different types of salsa there along with other various toppings. It's a great way to customize your burrito and it's all free! I recommend skipping having salsa on your actual burrito when it's made so that you can add the specific one you want later on. \n\nLastly, food is cheap here. I believe my basic veggie burrito was less than $5. It's great to find a place that prices food accurately - i.e. why would a beef and veggie burrito be priced the same??

So sometimes there's a wait; but I have never had a bad meal there in 25 years. Some Mex places don't have seafood at all, they have salmon, prawns, and snapper; in any combination you can imagine.\n\nAlso, there's the salsa bar - they win the CA state fair salsa competition nearly every year - ribbons on the wall for you to see - and it's all there for you. They must have a dozen different kinds of fantastic salsa plus various vegetable condiments. I always cheat and take some extra stuff home.\n\nAnd then, they have art as well: a constant rotating display of art on their walls, sometimes excellent.\n\nAND, they have a 'happy hour' Taconomics - tacos and beers!

The long one is for food; if you've already called ahead or are only drinking, you can skip it. Otherwise, queue up. The other line is for drinks and payments.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian burrito b - beans (black), rice, cheese and salsa. I opted for hot salsa; from my burrito's innards, that appears to be the hot pico. I also ordered an lime agua fresca. As I waited for my food, I took my little complimentary tray of chips over to the salsa bar. The bar is quite impressive, but I wish there were signs noting what the different salsas were and their heat level. The agua fresca was good too, but I prefer mine more tart.\n\nWhen my burrito came, it was a tight little foil tube; not much bigger than a paper towel tube. I was very excited to sink my teeth into a tasty burrito, but that excitement was extinguished very quickly when I realized how bland my burrito was. The taste of rice and jalapenos was so overwhelming that it's all I could taste. I muscled through most of the burrito, eventually throwing in the towel because it was boring and I was full. Normally, if a burrito is good, I will eat til my stomach hurts and then eat a little more (sad, I know).

For this review, we will concentrate on the gold standard of measuring taquerias, the carne asada burrito. \n\nOf all the top Mission burrito joints, Pancho Villa Taqueria offers the most burrito customization options by far. Diners have choices of meat (carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, al pastor, spicy pollo, pollo chile verde, pork chile verde, tofu ranchero, lengua, steak fajitas, and pollo fajitas), beans (refried pinto, whole pinto, black whole, and black refried), tortilla (flour, whole wheat, red chile, and spinach), and salsa (mild or hot pico, molcajete stone ground, fire roasted arbol chile, and pastor roasted). \n\nA regular burrito ($7.00) sports your choice of meat, rice, beans, and salsa. The deluxe ($7.50) adds cheese. The especial ($8.00) will get you guacamole. The super ($9.00) scores you sour cream, lettuce, and tomato. \n\nWith a steamed tortilla, the carne asada burrito was sizable, but not overwhelming. Ordered spicy, it was quite piquant, but slightly dry, needing some salsa to give it the right consistency. Good sized chunks of steak were plentiful and there was a good mix of ingredients in each bite. \n\nA small portion of chips is complimentary with your burrito, perfect to sample the award-winning selections on the large salsa bar.\n\nPancho Villa Taqueria also offers a myriad of drink choices, including sodas ($1.00), Mexicoke ($2.50), and Aguas frescas ($2.00, $2.50, $3.00, and $3.50) as well as domestic ($3.50) and Mexican ($4.00) beers. \n\nThe line can sometimes be long, but it moves quickly.

No objections here!\n\nThis place also gives you nachos with a very large selection of salsa to chose from in the back. There's more than enough choices for your tacos, your nachos, or if you order a specialty large nachos like us you fight your way to finish such a large monster.\n\nOver all fun place. Not a fancy setup, but that's great if you are looking to just eat and hang out with your friends with the option to frequently order more small bites along the way.", "author": "Jerry K."}

It's pretty hard to go wrong with a tortilla and some yummy meat inside.  Everything here seemed very fresh and delicious.  As we were eating, I constantly saw the chefs cooking the meat on the grill and refilling the meat tubs with fresh meat to make new food with!  I ordered a beef super burrito, which was pretty good, it wasn't really anything to write home about, but it certainly was delicious.  The reason for only four stars is because it was very yummy and hit the spot, but it was also pretty typical.  I wouldn't really say it was completely extraordinary and I did actually get a couple gristly bites, but I can't really blame the restaurant too much for that.  I had to spit out a couple bites because they weren't really chewable, but that could probably happen anywhere.  Their selection of salsas made a really nice addition to my burrito too!  I practically poured a drop of new a different kind of salsa on every bite!  Overall delicious, but honestly it's nothing SUPER incredible.", "author": "Kevin K."}

I eventually found it sitting at the counter when I came back to the register. Besides this food is decent and they are very busy at dinnertime.

Tasted okay but the presentation was not that great imo. Why do I have to pay seperate for things like olives??? I miss the old days when you ordered \"Nachos\",it came complete.

Of the multitude of burritos I've had while visiting SF, Pancho has so far, been the very best burrito I've ever eaten. I'd challenge someone to tell me a better burrito (and share that location, because I'd be running there, as you should be running to Pancho).

Excellent! \n\nThere are a couple of places like this in the Mission. They get an A for the salsa bar. The salsa were fresh as there was a constant line of people getting their burrito on. So many salsas, so few chips but that is ok. I don't want to fill up on chips when I have a shrimp burrito coming my way. \n\nIt was an above average shrimp burrito. I don't know why this always happens to me but I always start on the wrong end of the burrito. \n\nYou say what? There is a right side to start on a burrito? I say yes, the side with the meat (or shrimp) on it of course. I always take my first bite on the end with no meat and always think, am I being ripped off here. But oh my god was I wrong.

In desperate need of an authentic mission burrito, we went to Pancho Villa.  \n\nThe new way to order your food is terrible.  Instead of just telling the server what you want and they make it,, now you tell someone what you want who punches it into a computer and gives you a receipt.  You take your receipt to the person who collects your money.  And then you find a table and wait.  We probably waited 15 minutes.  What was interesting is the place was not very busy for a Saturday night. \n\nOnce we got our burritos they were good and the spicy tastes of carnitas and jalape\u00f1os brought back memories. But this wasn't the fat burrito we remembered. It was no longer three inches in diameter. Now it was maybe an inch and a half wide. \n\nFor all of the choices to find a mission burrito, we will try another next time.", "author": "Ed J."}

I saw everyone ordering burritos, so I figured, OK go for the burrito.  I got a super chicken burrito hoping that it would be delicious since everyone seemed quite content with their burritos in hand.  My friends had told me that pancho villa is \"da bomb\" so I was expecting a lot out of the burrito.  \n\nI got my burrito and went to pay, and the lady at the cash register gave me some chips (like 5 chips).  I'm used to going to burrito places where you can scoop as many chips as you can so I was a little disappointed that they only gave me 5 chips.  Well, that was OK I guess... because the salsa selection made up for it.  They had this pretty good creamy, sun-dried tomato-tasting salsa...it was pretty delicious.\n\nBut, that was as far as what I considered delicious as my burrito was a little disappointing; the burrito's rice was soggy and the chicken was dry.  Perhaps, I ordered the wrong burrito but I figured you can't mess up too much on a chicken burrito.  I'm used to having my chicken being a little more wet, but chicken is easy to overcook.   Similarly, I'm used to having my rice being a little more dry--instead of being wet and soggy.  The textures of the chicken and rice seemed to have been switched.  \n\nAs I ate my burrito, I was wondering what the big hype was about Pancho Villa.

As for beer, they offer pacifico, corona, stella, sierra nevada, etc. Such a good $2 beer selection, don't you think?! \n\nOverall, the food here is good and the portion is just right. If you're not a fan of tacos or just don't feel like eating tacos, don't worry because there are plenty of other dishes here for you to try like quesadillas, burritos, nachos, seafood dishes, and rice plates. \n\nDefinitely need to check this place out during happy hour.

With my garlic prawns I was given a pile of glorious spanish rice, creamy smooth refried beans (they also have refried black beans which I hope to try, but the pinto are so good I don't know if I can stray) chopped fresh tomato, cilantro and mild (prob rinsed) white onions as well as HALF an entire beautifully ripe avocado. The garlic prawns still have their shell, legs and tail which I fancy because I like to eat them whole as well as some delicious garlicy mushrooms. The chips are fresh, always hot, made in small, frequent batches. They have every type of agua fresca, including Jamaica which I love. The watermelon was great, no sugar added. There is nothing not to absolutely love and adore about this spot.\n\nALSO: How can people say that El Farolito or Taqueria Cancun are better than this spot?

My dad used to live next door. I eventually moved across the street from here- and loved it. The food is and always has been perfect. It's sadly becoming infested with the gentrifying hipsters taking over the mission- so standing in line listening to their usually drunken first world problems is no longer an option for me. I usually send my kid in. They make the best salsa verde. I get a  pint a week. Always. And drink that down in two days. Get the Jamaica mixed with lemon lime aguas Fresca- make it an XL or you will be disappointed when you have a small empty cup and are still thirsty. The staff here has been mostly the same for years. And I love them all- always make my burrito how I like it. I miss sitting in there and having the musicians come and sing while we eat- they still do it- I just don't like eating in there anymore. It gets really loud when the dinner crowd comes in. If you come to the city and want some real food from a clean place you can trust- go to Pancho Villas.", "author": "Tracy R."}

I think we came to the right place!\n\nBefore arriving off BART, I did a few Internet searches for Taqueria recommendations. One personal fave is Burrito Eater at:\n\nhttp://burritoeater.com/main.php\n\nThe Reviews also reminded me of the joke about 3 Jews and 4 different opinions. Every post I read about had their own fans and passionate points of view.\n\nI made a list, checked it twice, and I felt pretty good that we would easily find a place that had no naughty and was all nice. However, it was all for naught as my colleague's friend immediately led us over to Pancho Villa.\n\nThe Mission's big-daddy megataqueria comes complete with door-opening security person, big crowds, and strolling musicians that were well worth a modest tip. Later when I was wandering around and looking at the nearby Taqueria La Cumbre, I thought that I've probably been here before. After all, Pancho Villa opened in 1982 and I moved to the Bay Area 2 Years later. Has it really been that long?\n\nI really enjoyed my Super Chile Verde Chicken Burrito, a wide variety of really interesting salsas, fresh chips, and of course watching one of the cooks energetically applying the meat cleaver next to the grill. Yet I wasn't wowed mostly due to the slow speed that the food came out and the fact that the Burrito \"stayed\" with me well into the night. Maybe I'll go a little less spicy the next time.", "author": "Eric B."}

The pork here is very succulent and works well with all the other components. \n\nAt all times of the day, this place is packed! Whether it be in the morning, afternoon or even before this place closes, the one thing you can always expect is a line almost going out the door. Seating is plentiful and workers come around every 2 or so minutes and clear out the tables.\n\nAll in all, this is a great place to grab a snack before walking down Valencia or Mission to do some sight seeing or grabbing a quick lunch/dinner.

We asked the AT&T guys which place had the best burritos in the Mission, and they all vehemently disagreed with each other. It was getting heated. The loudest guy told us to go to Pancho Villa, and his walking instructions made slightly more sense than the others' so we headed there. \n\nSo ... let's just say this review is not a comparative study. We can only evaluate this single experience and we do not have a lifetime of burrito-eating in San Francisco to weigh up the flavours.\n\nAll that being said - we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Pancho Villa. There were musicians in the corner, and a cafeteria style serving line to get our food. It all happens quickly, and there isn't much time to make decisions. As usual, I went for the fish tacos and the bf went for some enormous meaty burrito with everything on it. The ingredients were all very fresh and there is a huge range of sauces and condiments and toppings ... actually that was kind of the best part. \n\nYou get to see the meat being cooked in front of you, and they have coke in glass bottles.

The portions are also gutbusting, which usually ends up being my downfall because I have no restraint. I'd probably enjoy it a lot more if I split the entree with someone else. The nachos were literally a large enough portion for 3 people. Did 3 people eat them? No, I did.\n\nOverall, I think this is a decent place and I would take people here if they wanted to try some of the mission classic food. I think some of the smaller places a few blocks away are just as good or better though.", "author": "Brent W."}

I believe that that fact alone just gives every component of the burrito superior taste & when they all combine together it's like angels sing :O)!\n\nB. Their salsa bar is just perfect.\n I'm a salsaholic....if you catch me in a bad time in a semi private situation I CAN be found drinking salsa....so you can imagine how ecstatic I was to find a FULL salsa bar equipped with QUALITY SALSAS OF ALL KINDS at Pancho Villa! \nYou can find me at my table with about 6-8 salsa containers just for my burrito and you can also find my table after and see that I have finished them all... \n(The orange salsa is DIVINE btw...it's like edible, delicious crack really...not to make that horrendous reference but I can imagine my taste buds having a parade when I eat it...GORSH I just wish I could know how to make some for myself!)\n\nC.

Of the eight fresh salsas I've tried here, I have yet to narrow down my favorites to less than four. The yearly salsa awards from past to the present hanging on the wall pretty much sums it all. I'm convinced the little village of Pancho must be where salsa originates from.\n\nNot many taquerias in the Mission offer prawn tacos, which I discovered I have a particular weakness for thanks to Pancho Villa. Pancho Villa prawns are shrimp-sized, but cooked perfectly on the griddle as ordered and generously stuffed in each taco. Two tacos at $3.50/each will satiate most, but if you prefer a different kind of presentation there's also prawn quesadilla and burrito.\n\nI'm not crazy about their meats. Although they offer a lot of different kinds of meats done in different ways, the quality isn't consistent and often dry. If you have to go the meat route, either choose based on how the meats look when you're there, opt for something simmered in sauce like salsa verde, or go elsewhere.\n\nFrom the street, this brightly-lit taqueria appears like an institution compared to its smaller competitions sprinkled throughout the Mission. It is in fact run like an institution. The line moves quick, the salsa bar is always clean (same with the bathrooms and tables), and there's usually a door man to keep the many questionable people  found hanging around the nearby BART station out. 16th & Mission may be icky, but I feel safe at Pancho Villa eating my prawn tacos, tortilla chips and 4 different salsas at anytime of the day.", "author": "Rina W."}

At the recommendations of some locals I had inquired from, Pancho Villa was tossed out there, in response to the inquiry \"where can I get some ridiculous, baby-sized burritos from?\"\n\nPancho Villa is conveniently located within a easy brisk walk off of the Market/16th BART stop, and even a tourist like myself was able to find it with ease, and not look so much like an obvious tourist doing such.  Upon arrival during a weekday lunch period, PV apparently has its own security guard up front who doubles as a polite and courteous doorman to hold the door open for guests.\n\nThe interior was bright and festive, and whether he worked at the restaurant, or just wandered around the Mission, singing wherever allows him to do such, there was a guy with a guitar trying to croon some Latin tunes.  Ordering is fairly simple, I ordered the biggest burrito I could think of, with steak in it.  Add the horchata, and lunch was  hair over $10 for me.\n\nServers bring the food to you, and my first impression upon seeing my burrito was that it looked too, well, neat.  It was like a perfect tubular shape, and looked perfectly parallel.  And it wasn't as large as I thought it was going to be; my first burrito in the Bay was from La Tapatia in SSF, and it was a big messy delicious monster.  Pancho Villa's burrito, wrapped in its wrinkle-free foil almost looked like a slice of a pipe.\n\nRegardless, burritos are burritos, and I tore into it and began eating.  The flavors were definitely good, and you could tell the ingredients were fairly fresh.  I killed the rest of the burrito in less time than I thought it would take; whether I was just hungry, or it wasn't as large as I thought it would be is really unmemorable.  The chips were nothing special at all, and I opted to not waste any space in the stomach for future tourist eating.\n\nIt's a convenient location, easily accessible by BART, the staff was friendly, and the service was good.  The food itself was good, but I think it was built up to be more than what I had experienced myself.  With about 3-4 other taquerias within a 2-3 block radius from Pancho Villa, it's hard to say that I would go back so soon, if I ever go back out there again, but for what it's worth, it was a positive experience, and a solid business to get some good food from.", "author": "Danny H."}

They had the #2 and I had the #1 which is Chile relleno ,flautist and enchilada , salad and beans and rice. The chili Rihanna was fantastic.

All the other reviewers are right who say it was great before, but the quality dropped years ago.\n\nI think the proximity to BART is getting this place positive reviews that it just doesn't deserve -- neither on quality, ambience, or service (they have easily enough staff to roll your burrito off the line around the time you're ready to pay, like so many other counter-style taquerias, but instead they give you a number and your food takes five minutes longer for no apparent reason other than backup that exists only because they made the poor decision to use a number system).\n\nWalk 3 blocks to better goods and you'll be glad you did.\n\nLet me explain what I really mean just so you don't think I'm being negative for no reason. Pancho Villa puts all the right things in their burritos, it all looks good behind the counter, but when you get down to eating, their cooking just isn't that good after all. If Mission burrito and taco reviews were actually well balanced and not thrown off by BART locations and other factors, Pancho Villa would get two stars. The food is not \"bad\", it's just not worth money either.  You get a full stomach but wish there had been more taste in the experience.", "author": "Eric O."}

Which means -- when it comes to actual Mission-style taquerias (and not intentional vegan replications of Latin American fare), it doesn't get much better than this. From nachos to burritos to tacos and everything in between, it's an omnivore's dilemma trying to choose which tasty vittles to jam down your throat at 5 minutes to midnight, and a welcome site for folks to don't eat meat. \n\nIn addition to the wide array of south-of-the-border offerings on the menu board, they also have one of the most kick ass salsa bars I've ever seen. With more than just your your ho-hum buckets of green and red salsa with the ubiquitous 14-hour old jug of pico de gallo for good measure, in the case of Pancho Villa, it's quite possible to become satiated without ordering a single item and just heading directly to the complimentary goods in the back of the room (but you didn't hear that from me!). There's a litany of different grilled peppers, spicy carrots, and everything else you could ask for when it comes to sideline Mexican staples. It's quite the generous bequeathment of savory food stuffs.\n\nIt can take forever at times to get your food, so I'd avoid the obvious hours when you think drunk hipster kids would be flocking in for some late night, drunken nosh.

Not much of a carne asada mix, but I sure don't mind a ribeye sprinkled with a bit of that spiced powder.  Rare, please.\n\nThere is a salsa bar, a good range of bottled drinks and of course, horchata to tone down the spiciness of any order.

The burritos come in two sizes and the regular size is pretty big as is. They also have a great ratio of ingredients usually and they come wrapped in two layers of foil. There is a three taco deal for 7$ with your choice of meat. The carne asada wasn't too flavorful, but it was moist and meaty. It wasn't chewy or stringy or anything like that at all. Just missing a little kick is all. They come in double layered flour taco shells, which is pretty much soft and drenched by the time you pick it up if you ordered a meat on it. Orders come with a side of chips whether you are dining in or out. If you order for here, then you'll get extra chips. The salsa bar is so, so, so, so good. Be sure to lap up these award-winning salsas. They're not so chunky or thick sometimes, but boy, what flavor. My favorite is this fresh, bright, thick salsa verde that they have. It's really spicy too. It's seriously one of the best salsas I've had. Also, they have like all the flavors of agua frescas in the world it seems like. While some places will l only have a couple per day, this place has at least six or eight flavors every day and in all range of sizes other than small. Well, they have a small, but it is a regular 8oz. cup. The horchata was super sweet and a little powdery, but definitely taste housemade and just really rich. You can even see litlte bits of coursely ground spices in it.\n\nThis is certainly not a hole in the wall. You can't really miss it and the lines can go through the door. And it's right next to the 16th Street Mission BART Station too. There is almost always a crowd, but there is a lot of seating and the turnover is quick, so don't worry. You might have to split up if you are in a big group though. It's also great for those late night cravings or trying to minimize a hangover for the next day.

One should never have to use effort to order food at a place that sells it. I asked several workers where I should order, if they were ready to take my order, or silver other variation of the two. My body language was pretty clear, but nobody bothered to let the order taker know that there were customers. In fact, I asked the girl who eventually took my order for help and she just stared blankly at me. There customers behind me and I were livid. When she finally took the order she had the rudest demeanor I've ever seen, like we were wasting her time. The lady behind me muttered \"I've never been done like this before.\" Damn straight.

Does he keep the hype under control? (Spoiler Alert: No.)\"\n\nGuarding the salsa recipe would certainly be a good idea, as it is totally bitchin' stuff. Red or green, they're both packed with smokey, spicy flavor, a touch of citrus, onions and garlic. I MAY have eschewed chips and just ended up drinking the stuff (alright, you caught me, I totally did).\n\nAlas, absurdly good salsa  a good burrito does not ensure. An ungrilled tortilla, poor ingredient distribution, and little spice to speak of (I know that I'm an ugly white boy, but I can handle it. Promise) led the pack of travesties in my diminutively sized Food-Log \"Especial\" (8.00), problems which were compounded by pockets of cold, flavorless, textureless green stuff (which may have been my promised \"Guacamole\") and the resultant dense clumps of unmelted cheese scattered randomly within. I couldn't complain about the cinnamon touched rice (now with green peas!), although it was far too abundant when compared with the flavorless pintos, leading to massive segregation of the other ingredients and a dry eating experience overall. Although the Carne Asada, expertly chopped by a badass dude with two giant cleavers (that may be my new dream job), showed promise on the grill, it ended up being a bland, gristly, contributor, which would recognizable as protein if it were invited to the yearly convention (Hi! My name is Steak!), but otherwise showed no signs of personality whatsoever. By the end, I threw up my hands, shrugged, and let out great \"Meh\". \n\nOverall: Two stars. Pancho Villa's salsas live up to the maelstrom of love on Yelp, everything else most certainly does not.", "author": "Casey U."}

If you have been looking for reliable, quality, consistent Mexican food (as I was, post-LA-transition), try Pancho Villa.

You're 99% likely to find something you like in flavor and level of spiciness.\n\nOVERALL CONS:\n- Way to pricey for a Mexican spot of this nature (only kinda worth it with our Groupons).\n- A lot of the meat sitting around (there is a really long display where you get to watch them prepare everything) looked really old.\n- Chips were oily and bland. The sauces were their only savior.\n- Everything just had a sheen of oil - not that Mexican food necessarily is the healthiest thing, but it doesn't have to taste this UNhealthy.\n- Chicken asada in the fiesta platter: smothered in oily cheese, not much to brag about. And the beans and rice were soggy and pretty tasteless.\n\nWe got..\n\n* Fiesta Platter (Prawns, nachos, corn quesadilla, asada steak or chicken, grilled onions, and salsa) - We got this with asada chicken. Cheesy, pretty tasty. Overall the chicken was tender but there wasn't much of it - about 80% of the plate was the soggy / tasteless rice & beans and crappy salad.

Actually I lied. One thing I did notice about Pancho Villa that is different from most other Taquerias I've been to is that if you order their burritos with the \"spicy\" salsa, they come with delicious chunks of green bell pepper and warm diced jalapenos, which I thought was a nice addition but not a game-changer in any respect.\n\nBoth times I've come here I had a little trouble understanding the lady who was assembling my burrito; first time when I ordered the carne asada burrito she didn't understand what I was saying when I asked if they had black beans instead of pinto beans; my second time eating here I asked for lengua as my meat of choice and then she looked kinda puzzled for a second and told me if I knew if the lengua \"was used.\" I took this to mean that she was suggesting that I get a different meat so I asked her \"oh so you don't have the lengua?\" and then she said \"the lengua is used, choose another,\" after which I stared her down with a quizzical look for about 15 seconds until some dude from the kitchen brought her a small assortment of lengua and she began to assemble my burrito.\n\nThe chips + salsa here isn't all that impressive either; their \"spicy\" sauce barely tickled my tongue.

With the deluxe, there also should have been tomatoes and guac, both of which were absent. \nThe carne asada had little flavor.

You could choose from a variety of salsas or fresh cilantro, all of which were fresh and great. \nThe burrito was $8 which you could easily split between two people, it is huge, but you may not get everything you paid for in it. \n\nPs there was a homeless man inside screaming, they did escort him out but ehhh", "author": "Jaclyn T."}

I bought the Yelp deal a few months ago ($7 for $10). It clearly stated in the voucher that you could either print out the voucher or present it on your phone in order to redeem the deal. I chose to print it out because my phone was having issues. However, when I tried to use the voucher, the cashier not only refused to honor my printed voucher, but also yelled at me and accused me of trying to cheat him by re-using an old voucher in front of a huge line of waiting customers. It was so embarrassing!! I explained that my reason for using a printed version was because my phone was having problems and was not pulling up the voucher, but he just got angrier and then proceeded to argue loudly with me for another 10 minutes, even after I pointed out the text on the voucher stating that a printed version was one of the options for redemption. He didn't even bother looking up the voucher number to check if it had been redeemed, which would have cleared this issue up in seconds. The cashier was beyond rude, and he treated me like a second class citizen just for trying to use this Yelp deal. In the end, because my phone wouldn't cooperate, I had to have my friend download the Yelp app on his phone, sign into my account, and pull up this deal, just so the cashier could mark the deal as redeemed. \n\nNeedless to say, I am never coming here again. It was a humiliating experience, and I am appalled that they would treat their customers this way. If Pancho Villa is not willing to honor this Yelp deal according to the terms and conditions they agreed to, then they shouldn't even be offering it.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

I only went here b/c I got a KGB deals certificate, it is the same thing as groupon for those who don't know.\n\nFirst of all the prices on their website are completely out of date and not even close to their actual prices, so don't be fooled.\n\nI think a super burrito (all the standard stuff plus sour cream, guac and cheese) is $8.50 not including tax, that is pretty steep for out in the mission or for anywhere for that matter.  The aqua frescas are also amazingly expensive.  That being said they have a great selection, so if price is no object for you, you might really like this place.  They usually have around 10 different aqua frescas.  \n\nThe organization is pretty poor, there is not an assembly line which would make much smoother and faster.  One person makes your order and there is a lot of back and fourth.\n\nAll the items are good and the meat is good, but nothing is spectacular.  All burrito orders come with chips and I think most food orders in general come with chips.\n\nThey have a rather extensive salsa bar with 5-7 choices or so of salsa.  They also have limes and other sides to go with your food.\n\nThey do a good job of quickly cleaning tables and there is always a security guard at the door to keep order and he usually opens and closes the door for people, he seems like a cool dude.\n\nI would not go here without some sort of discount, especially when there are places like El Farolito on Mission and 24th st. which are delicious, huge and much more price friendly.  It is also right next to bart.  For just over $6 at El Farolito you get a super burrito that comes with sour cream and slices of avocado!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They also have a really good green salsa.

I lived in The Mission & went to El Toro before this opened--same food in a much bigger space.

Meat or vegees (even chile rellenos!), beans, rice, avocado (if you always order the especial). The asada is fantastic, though I often get the chile relleno--love those packets of delectable peppers & cheese. I prefer not to get lettuce or tomato--diffuses the flavor too much for me.\n\n2. I don't know what people are complaining about re: the lack of table service. There are plenty of sit-down Mexican places in The Mission. They are fast & you can see everything that will fill that wonderful tortilla.\n\n3. Fantastic salsa bar--both for the food and the free chips they give you with each order (big bonus for me).\n\nSo haters--review the restaurant for what it offers, not for what you wish it were.

Pancho Villa fit the bill, so a bunch of us convened there on a rando Thursday night.\n\nAMBIANCE: Large and spacious (but not many seats for large groups) with a slight clinical warehouse feel.  I was not a fan of their stools (not the most comfortable seating arrangement), or of the mariachi band that made the rounds every hour or so (sooo loud... made conversation incredibly difficult).  As others have mentioned, they have a security guard stationed at the door after dark, which can be reassuring if you are worried about colorful Mission inhabitants.\n\nSERVICE: Factory assembly line for your food.  You order at the register, grab some chips & salsa, and wait for them to bring you your food.  Mix up seem to happen frequently... and since it is a \"dirty Mexican\" resto... beware, as your food may have been delivered to another table first (we were given the wrong item, and it sat at our table for a while before we were able to notify a staff member about the mix up.  Instead of taking it back to the kitchen to be remade, she just called out the number again and delivered it to the correct table).\n\nFOOD: Fine, nothing special.

I felt like getting Mexican food, so I thought I would go to El Farolito on 24th. Then I walked by Pancho Villa. I recognized the name immediately because they have another location in San Mateo, where I ate several times last summer. I already knew the San Mateo Pancho Villa had amazing burritos, so I decided to check out this place.\n\nThe first time I went to the San Mateo location, I ordered a chicken mole super burrito to go. I picked up the burrito and chips after they called something that sounded like my order number. I walked for about 10 minutes to get back to the place where I was staying, and as soon as I bit into the burrito, I realized it contained shrimp, not chicken. Whoops. I really didn't want to walk all the way back to explain the mix-up, and the shrimp burrito actually tasted really good, so I ate it without complaining. I decided to listen more carefully the next time I went back.\n\nAnother time I went to the San Mateo location, I ordered a chicken mole super burrito again. This time, I listened very carefully for my order number. When I bit into the super burrito, it indeed contained chicken with mole sauce! It was densely packed and tasted excellent.\n\nNow, in San Francisco, I ordered a spicy chicken super burrito. Like all the previous times, it was very filling, very nicely packed, and very tasty. I also ordered a mango agua fresca, which was great.\n\nBut of course, there was a mix-up with my order. I was order #336, and the entire thing should have cost about $10. When I paid, they gave me a receipt saying that mine was order #326, and it cost only about $8. I pointed out the discrepancy to them, and the cashier said something along the lines of, \"What? I gave you a burrito...it's not like you ordered a quesadilla, \u00bfverdad?\". Whoops. But I was saving money, so I ate it without complaining (again).\n\n-1 star for mischarging me (and possibly others as well) on two occasions. But the food is so good that I can easily give Pancho Villa the remaining 4 stars.", "author": "Varun N."}

Went in just because of the crowd and the assembly line workers grilling meats and fish, wrapping burritos, dumping salsa and cheese....and the hit of mexican smells when the security guard opened the door (yes... security guard).\n\nWe ordered up fish tacos and a carne asada super burrito with pico de gallo.\n\nThe fish tacos, albeit slow to be served, were cleverly seasoned with a creamy white sauce and rolled into a foil as to prevent it falling apart (nice touch). I would have preferred the fish to be a little bit more crispy - it felt more like a steamed or broiled fish rather than a grilled fish...I'd say fry it and you'd have a perfect dish. Also, would have liked a little more heat, but the salsa bar does a fine job of adding that.\n\nThe burrito, to me, was one of the top burritos in the bay area. The carne asada is mixed with green bell peppers and seasoned to the point where the burrito became a melting pot of ingredients where everything had the succulent flavor of the meat. From the rice to the lettuce to the cheese, the sour cream, the salsa...everything oozed carne asada. I couldn't stop eating it. I dunno what everyone else has a problem with - maybe it was the fact that I hadn't had real mexican food since I left LA two years ago - maybe it was that I was hungry...but the burrito was amazing.\n\nThe salsa bar btw, is one of the best touches.

The glossy menu and huge staff make this feel like a Chipotle wannabe.  There are some highlights (the carnitas and the salsa bar), but a lot of the food is mediocre-to-bad.  I guess averaging the good with the bad, I can only give a solid \"A-OK\" three star.  Maybe there's a reason why the only Mexican people there were the ones behind the counter...\n\nTaco: The basic taco is a corn tortilla from a bag (don't get me started about how freshly griddled tortillas are superior) with your choice of bean (black, refried, pinto) and salsa (if they remember to add it).  Pretty basic and boring so the true success or failure falls solely on the meat filling.\n\nCarnitas: Probably the best thing going at this joint.  There were wisps of pulled pork: some crispy and some succulent.  I devoured this is no time. \n\nPastor: Good seasoning, but the texture was too soft.  I prefer when pastor has really crispy outsides to add a super BBQed experience.\n\nPollo Asado: I ordered the carne asada (which they were preparing fresh), but the tacotress decided to give me chicken instead.  It was way too dry and had no flavor.  Major boo!\n\nCorn Quesadilla: This really sucked.  They used the corn tortillas from a bag and just melted bland white cheese in between.  The tortilla wasn't even brown and the salsa mentioned on the menu was no where to be found.\n\nNachos & Salsa: The nachos were a bit too thick which caused them to house too much oil.  The salsa bar was pretty amazing though.  So many choices, I think I only got through half.  Too many to review individually, but each one tasty and uniquely different from the rest.\n\nJamaica Agua Refresca: Wish they had said this was tea explicitly.  I was expecting a fruit punch.

It had perfect burrito proportions... the cross-section was not too big to stuff into my face, but not so small as to look like an egg roll.  The roll was nice and dense, and made for a good, solid burrito heft.  And to cut to the chase, despite having them put all the wet extras inside, it did not do the burrito full-diaper-dump that often happens to lesser burritos when you bite down too close to the bottom.  This was clearly rolled by a maestro.\nAnd the flavor... it was a perfect mission burrito.  Halfway through I poured the rest of my tomatillo sauce down the bore, and made it richer, spicier and equally awesome.\n\nI thought it was great.  I'll be back, by BART, foot, donkey, or otherwise.", "author": "David S."}

I have been here numerous times and ordered quite a few different things and I have always been more than pleased. I crave this place. \n\nIf you know me, or read my stuff, you know I have a burrito addiction. I'm very picky with my burritos. The burritos here get about 4 1/2 stars from me. Which means they are really damned good. I have only given one burrito 5 stars ever and you'll have to read my La Pinata review for that. \n\nAnyhoo- the food is effing great. You get to watch them make it which is always assuring. The line is always long but moves pretty quick. Because they have such a constant crowd in and out of their doors you know their food is fresh. \n\nThe staff is quick and nice. One night I was there right before they closed and they had ran out of guacamole, which is a MUST on my burrito. A guy who seemed he had some kind of authority apologized and told me to hold on. He grabbed an avocado and sliced it up and put it on a little dish for me. No, it wasn't guacamole but at least it was an avocado and I thought it was REALLY nice of the guy to go out of his way to do that. \n\nThe atmosphere is okay. You order at the counter, pay, and take it with you to a table. Sometimes it's so busy in here you can't find a table. There aren't any booths here. It's a pretty simple set up. Sometimes there a mariachi dude in there playing his guitar and singing. I really like that. I think it's awesome. I'm glad they don't kick him out. When he is there I usually order another Pacifico.", "author": "Liz M."}

I've never gotten the same thing twice, and everything I've personally had was really good.  There is a lot of fat and grease but really I expect that from these places.  In my experience, the ingredients are consistent and quality.  I have had no issues, quite to the contrary in fact.  This is still some of the better tasting Mexican American food I've ever had.  I could care less how long Pancho Villa has been in the neighborhood, if it sucks it sucks.  But PV serves up quality grub, which is even magnitudes better when you're hammered.\n\nThe line is always long, but the workers don't mess around, they work hard and fast (I'm a watcher) to get quality product out as fast as possible.  And they do a good job.  Like most taquerias the food is mostly prepped and cooked right there in front of you.\n\nTheir salsa bar has good selections, in line with most salsa bars in the area.\n\nThe menu is large, and the prices are on the higher end of standard but still pretty reasonable for SF.  And unlike at other taquerias which may charge $.50 less for a taco, I'm not worried about cleanliness or pathogens at PV.  Your thoughts may vary, this is the human experience after all.\n\nCredit cards are accepted here, with no minimum, which is a relief in a city that seems like any day an order will be issued down banning plastic altogether.\n\nThey do serve bottled beer as well, although the interior and style of the restaurant would be considered more \"fast food\" than anything.  There are lots of tables inside, but considering the location no real good place to go outside to eat close by (Dolores Park would be the closest picnic spot).  If you try to eat at a bench at the BART station as I have the homeless and drug dealers may purposefully make you feel uncomfortable.  One lady nearby said to some older dude who came and stood over me, \"Is he actually gonna eat that right there?\" and she scoffed.  Tangent, sorry.\n\nPancho Villa is a great taqueria.  I think it blows El Farolito out of the f-ing water, no question in my mind.  It is the best \"Mexican\" I've had in SF thus far.", "author": "Jon P."}

I was told that the taco bar should make 2-4 tacos per person, so we should have received 30-60 tortillas.  \n\nI've ordered from Pancho Villa through WOW before and this is the first time this has happened.

I've frequented Pancho Villa several times and so had my boyfriend so we felt comfortable knowing what we were going to get.  I got two fish tacos and he got the shrimp burrito.  I thought my tacos were good although my boyfriend was unimpressed.  It was neat how they wrapped the tacos up so it was almost like eating a mini burrito.  My bf got the shrimp burrito with refried beans, which he never does so it was a \"treat\" for him.  I though it was just a carb fest with the beans, rice and just not enough shrimp in the burrito.  I do like their salsa bar but the measly amount of chips they give you doesn't allow you to fully enjoy it.\n\nThe security guard is nice and will open the door for you and will also clear the table after you eat.", "author": "Rosalind S."}

I bought more than I care to admit here. \n\nFun fact: My 92 year-old grandpa told me that the REAL Pancho Villa used to come to all the bars in Jalisco and buy everyone drinks. My grandpa was just a boy at the time, but my great grandpa would bring him along when he went boozing. Now that's what I call responsible parenting!\n\nBut what you REALLY care about is the food, so here goes. I've had almost everything on the menu over the years:\n\n- Fish tacos are surprisingly good. The batter is crisp and well seasoned. They top it with shredded cabbage and their house salsa.\n- They have an awesome deal for tacos: 3 tacos for $6. You must pick three of the same taco, but no matter what meat you choose you can't go wrong\n- The enchiladas aren't great. That's because real enchiladas take a long time to make, so they cut corners here.\n- Their Camarones al Diablo platter is hot as a MOFO \n- They have every kind of agua fresca known to man: horchata (cinnamon rice), agua de jamaica (hibiscus), melon, strawberry, pineapple - you name it. \n-  Their churros are good. They have regular 12-inch churros and 6-inch churros filled with custard. Get both! Go nuts!\n- Sometimes guitar players come in and perform. I don't think they're hired by Pancho Villa,  though. They just come in off the street.\n- Lines can get long in the evenings, but you can usually nab a seat without waiting.\n\n\nBottom line: Don't take your kids to bars.

When you grow up three miles from Tijuana eating Mexican food once sometimes twice a day you can become a picky bitch about your Mexican food.

So when I walked in to Pancho Villa I was hoping for good but expecting mediocre and I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised.  \n\nI decided on one prawn taco, one pollo asado taco with a side of rice and beans.  They kept telling me that wasn't a 'plate' and I had to get a 'plate' I told them I didn't care what it was, that that was what I wanted, make it and charge me what ever so they did.  I win!\n\nTheir salsa bar was great, very fresh and clean and constantly refilled.  The chips were goooood, fresh and salty and yummy.  My food was well magic in my mouth unfortunately it disappeared too quickly for me and I was left with no more tacos when I wanted more.  The prawn taco was my favorite of the two but the rice and beans were a great co-star to them.

The meat on my tacos (lengua, pastor, and spicy chicken) were not as tender and tasty as before.

My friend from the Richmond District liked his carnitas burrito.\n\nThese slight disappointments aside, it was an overall positive experience. The place is busy and festive so we were thoroughly entertained. The guy with the guitar is still there chillin' singing about Guadalajara, and a security guard is still on the premise to open the door for you.

It's a fast-food, counter-order, take your food to a table kind of way, but that should not be a deterrent in any way!  They have it down to a science since so many people want to eat the delicious burritos and tacos and everything else on the menu!\n\nI went with the burrito especial with carnitas, and it was nothing short of amazing.  At about $8, it was very reasonably priced, and the portion was more than I could possibly eat (even though I really wanted to eat every last bite).  The enchiladas and the guac were awesome too.  I had some fresh mango juice to accompany my meal, and it totally hit the spot.

But there was nowhere to sit because EVERY table had plates, food and garbage left over from previous customers.  No effort had been made to clean anything even though the restaurant was almost empty.  \n\nI ordered the carne asada plate.  The meat was pretty tender, spiced well and not tough.  Enjoyable but the side dishes weren't anything special.\n\nVisit 2:  Saturday night - post bar - 2:15 am.  I am totally aware that working the after-bar crowds suck, so I give a lot of leeway to restaurants when writing reviews for this time period.  \n\nBUT, this experience was beyond poor, even for 2:15 am.  There were five of us in our group and all ordered very simple items, nachos and enchiladas.  \n\nEven though we ordered at the same time, our food came out at different times, spread out over the next 25 minutes.  The last person got their food about 45 minutes after ordering.  The food was bad.

My friend had told us to remind them about the special so I am going to tell you as well: REMIND THEM just in case. For example, they might try to charge you $8 instead of the $5 you were expecting to pay. However, the $5 only refers to the most basic of their Quesadilla in which one could only choose which type of meat nd mild or spicy salsa. If one wanted guacamole or etc, they would have to pay extra. Bummer =/. Oh! One could also request a different type of tortilla. \n\nWhen our number came up, a nice lady worker brought us our plates. How nice of her...

The older thirty and fortysomethings like to come here too, but are weary of the crime around here.  It's a very rough and unpredictable neighborhood.  It seems that there's a lot of unnecessary staring contest alpha male behavior and catty beta female behaviour around here.  But still where can you find a better super vegetarian burrito?  The interior's focal point is the Mexican flag and to order you go in a queue of about 10-20 people constantly until it closes at midnight.\n\nThe seating traffic is fast and it feels as if you are in Mexico City.  The parking outside wasn't as bad as expected, but the probability of having your car stolen is very high too.  It's a very seedy part of San Francisco, but an area that you must visit and see.  Just be careful.  People will not yield as you walk towards them.  About 1 of every 3 men walk as if they are just that close to exploding and are vying for a physical confrontation.  Very contentious young people around here.\n\nInside Pancho Villa is like a cultural center.  Yesterday night, there was an exhibit of images by local Bay Area photographer David Klein.  Some interesting portrait shots and long shutter time art.  There was also a sort of Tibetan style duo playing music made popular in the 60s.\n\nThe burritos rule and the energy in this very affordable restaurant/San Francisco Landmark is worth the visit.\n\nThe vibe's grungy and debateably seedy, but there's a strong tradition and culture that has evolved in this establishment surrounded by boiling criminal chaos.\n\nThe free nachos are bland and not very good without salsa.\n\n**Cultural/Anthrological/Cinematographical Tip**\n\nPrior to coming here for a burrito, Netflix or rent the following DVD: \"Romantico.\"  It is an interesting documentary about the harsh life of an illegal alien mexican mariachi guitarist/singer living in San Francisco and supporting his life and his family abroad in Mexico.", "author": "Tony U."}

The carne asada was good, tasty, moist, and pretty freshly cut.  All the meat there was being cut right as we were ordering the tacos, so that's a plus.  The tacos included a good amount of meat too, but it was still a little pricey for me, a little over $3.  Perhaps I'd fare better during happy hour =P\n\nThe nachos were also pretty good, but what was even better was that we had a bunch of left over nacho fixings left on our plate, as most nachos have a low chip to topping ratio.  But the employees at Pancho Villa Taqueria were happy to give us more, and more chips.  I don't see why people are complaining about the little amounts of chips that you get, just ask for more!\n\nAnd as everyone else said, the salsa bar is pretty good.  Don't know how to describe it, but the salsas are thicker and has more substance than what you usually see in salsa bars.

The guy and I sat there for a moment just staring at one another.

I have no complaints about the quality of the food, and for a burrito joint I'd normally give them 4 stars.\n\nProblem is, a few months ago they changed to a different order system. It used to be the standard \"order from the girl who's making you the food\", and thus it was easy to specifiy \"I want this much rice, beans, salsa etc\" as she made it. Now it's \"order from the order-taker who has to enter your order into the computer which prints out the order for the girls to prepare\" and it's NEVER right.\n\nI've eaten there at least 2 dozen times since they've instituted this new system and literally, EVERY single time there is something WRONG with my order, something that never happened before when I interacted with the girl actually preparing my food.\n\nSmall example of how the new system sucks: occasionally I like prawn burritos. Previously, when I ordered one, the girl would tell the cook to start the prawns, and he would, and in the meantime she'd prepare the burrito. She'd always be done before him, so my burrito would be filled with hot and perfectly cooked prawns. Under the new system, I order the same burrito, but it gets queued. The order goes to the cook who starts the prawns, but the girls don't start preparing the burrito until AFTER the prawns are done, but they still sit there on the grille while they prepare the other ingredients. This means the prawns cook for an additional few minutes, and prawns cook so quickly that I now get hard rubbery prawns.\n\nAnother example: I like to go light on the rice and beans so as not to load up on carbs. In person, it's easy to say \"a bit less please\" but it's difficult to convey \"light rice/beans\" to the order taker, because although the computer system might allow it, each girl has their own idea of what \"light\" means, and thus my order ranges from way too much to slightly too much. Never happened under the old system.\n\nUpdate 6-2015: I've been eating off and on at PV since the last review, and that review still stands, but I'm downgrading the rating because the problem I described has just gotten worse and worse. I had a regular burrito the other day, and it was not a complicated order: one regular burrito, grilled chicken, light on the rice and beans.\n\nI got a pencil d**k.\n\nWhoever typed it in or made it, maybe both, whatever they did, I ended up with a burrito with virtually nothing inside it, rice beans, and chicken. It's as if someone misunderstood \"light\" as \"baby\". I ate it anyway, there was no point in complaining because I'm sure the complaint would not have been understood.\n\n\"You ask for little.\"\n\"No, I asked for light rice and beans.\"\n\"That's what this.\"\n\nI left hungry.", "author": "Rob C."}

While the line may seem really long they are able to move people through it fairly easy. Their taco tuesday is a must go to. Even though they are street taco size, they stuff them to the max.

You can watch them cooking the carne asada and chopping the meat in front of you.

Most impressive.\n\nThe prices have gone up over the years and the burritos are not as big as they used to be, but this place is still a bargain.\n\nThe security guard does not bother me, since I am from the hood and sit on top of the predator pyramid.  In East LA, many of the restaurants have security guards.  I can tell who are the locals and who are turistas.  Interesting drug dealers and worn out prostitutes pry their wares around the corner on Mission and 16th.

When I first tried this place in 2007, I didn't recall a security guard/door man; now it has one. Considering the crowd and the neighborhood, it is a terrific idea; plus, it feels extra welcome when the staff opens the door for you. \nAnd now, they even have a computer system that helps the quality of service!\n\nThe price is very decent; you can get a (very, very) big burrito for around $10 with very nice quality of food. It is a open-kitchen style, so you can see how your food is made and cooked. All the staff wears gloves while making food.\n\nAbout how the place changed my experience in Mexican food forever: I didn't like Mexican beans and rice. I never liked them until I tried this place. This might just be personal experience that I never had a decent Mexican food nor beans or rice, however, I would say I tried its burrito and now I dare to order food more than just quesadilla and tacos, furthermore other items on their menu. This I can say about most of Mexican food place on the mission, but I started to like Mexican beans and rice from Pacho Villa Taqueria.  \n\nOnly things I can complain are the type of crowd I have to pass through from BART station to the restaurant and its seats. There are numbers of people seek for help every time I go there, always. About the seats, since the place is good eat and cheap, it is always crowded, and sometimes hard to find a seat. However, the customers know about this and people usually quickly finish their food and empty their tables.

One of these tacos plus the chips fills me up for the night.\n\nIf you're a strict vegetarian though, beware: I think they probably cook meat on the same grill where they fry up the veggies.\n\nOh, and the spicey chicken is great too, added to just about anything.", "author": "G O."}

Do you know what it's like to live in the Bay Area for 7 years and then not have a good burrito for what seems like an eternity...I didn't think so.\n\nBecause of it's location near 16th and Mission BART and late hours, I have always thought of Pancho Villa as being the more \"main stream\" taqueria in the neighborhood. Everyone knows where it is and goes there now and again, but I am pretty positive most folks don't live in the Mission that go there. Ok, Mission local snobbery apparently has not left me. Part of its popularity may be it's larger, more well lit and less \"grimy\" than other taqurias in the area so non-locals are more comfortable. \n\nThat being said, the chile relleno burrito I had last night was AWESOME! The chile relleno itself was perfectly cooked, the cheese melted in my mouth and the rest of the burrito ingredients were top notch (oh, how I love the rice in a mission burrito!). Maybe at the end of my trip after many other burritos I will think differently, but I had a great experience last night. The salsa bar has always been one of the highlights of this place. They have 8-12 different award winning salsas available and the free chips we perfectly crispy. Not only that but I ran into a friend, which generally happens around 10PM at Pancho Villa. It can get busy in there (due to the many bars in the area and post-buzz/mid-drinking session munchies), but it's not as crazy as El Faralito where insane stuff happens around 1 AM. Everyone should check that out once or twice. I heard once that El Toro was owned by the same people as Pancho Villa and is basically the same business, just in a smaller location a couple blocks away, but I'm not sure if that was true. I will be visiting El Buen Sabor (fav), El Faralito (second fav), and even Cancun (hated it for a while but the quesadilla's are great) on this trip so we'll see how I feel when I get back to NYC, but I would recommend Pancho Villa to anyone who wants a solid late night dinner (and doesn't want to take the time to see what else is open).", "author": "Seth H."}

I happened to wander by Pancho Villa Taqueria after exiting BART at 16th/Mission last night and decided to stop by because it was filled with people (but not filled to the point of discomfort).\n\nThe room was about 90% full at 8pm on a Friday night with only 2 or 3 people ahead of me in the ordering line.  I got the three taco plate with Chicken, Beef, and ??? for $7.  I asked the lady making my tacos to pick her three favorite meats so I have no idea what she picked for the third.  When ordered to go, the tacos come in a sturdy plastic box suitable for simultaneous walking and eating.  They also give a small paper bag of chips (didn't even need to ask!) -- perfect for scooping up the fallen taco bits without the need for utensils.\n\nThe tacos themselves were okay.  Certainly not the best I've had (hard to beat Cotixan [http://www.yelp.com/biz/cotixan-mexican-and-seafood-san-diego]), but acceptable for a quick dinner on the go.  I wish the meat had been a bit more juicy; I seemed to have gotten a lot of dry bits.\n\nThe prices are a bit high for what you're getting.  A three taco plate should really only cost about $5.  I suppose there's a premium for being popular.  I'll be back again if I happen to be in the area.  3.5 stars rounded up.", "author": "Andrew C."}

Though it's not part of a global conglomeration that is contributing heftily to American obesity and monopolizing nourishment on an international scale, the product is similarly bland, less-than-extraordinary and yet still wildly popular. Even worse for the San Francisco institution is that it's shockingly overpriced. The meats are average, rice powdery and beans too watery to merit the $9 price tag for a super burrito. Moreover, I'm not entirely comfortable eating my expensive burri in front of an armed security guard.\n\nSo Pancho Villa doesn't compare to the negative impact Chipotle has on our global economy, our stomach, and some would say our underwears, but it's still vastly overrated and just not good enough.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-31", "description": "Live singing and guitar relieve the people in a line six deep, three across at Pancho Villa Taqueria. The procession toward the two registers is fairly efficient and not too laborious for bodies opposed to idle behavior. I enjoy this on-the-spot ordering, paying, and receiving. The self-serve format leaves one to relax with the meal without being doted upon or in anxious waiting for a water refill.\n\nThe menu is extensive and appealing. Salmon, soon to be in someone's seafood burrito, is grilled before my eyes. I usually like to go through the meats first and then expand whence my proposed essentials are covered.\n\nChar-broiled steak, black refried beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, lettuce and bits of radish are piled high on a small doubly layered tortilla foundation to make my carne asada super taco ($4). I was left in a brief state of wonder. How to approach eating this masterpiece with ingredient proportionate mouthfuls and limited spillage? I picked up the super taco and opened my mouth as wide as feasibly possible, seeing this as my only option in a hunger induced immediacy. When ordering I was wondering if one taco would do me justice. Wonder no more, one ingredient packed super taco satisfies. \n\nThe taqueria's salsa bar seems a decisive novelty factor, seeing as how the restaurant was recommended to me something along the lines of, \"the place with the salsa bar\" by several friends who take residence in the Mission. And of course I had to try all five salsas with the complementary chips, for research purposes.\n\nThe chile verde chicken super burrito, isn't particularly super for $8.50. Yes, it has all the components desirable in a burrito yet I can't help but fixate on a noticeable saltiness. I countered this with a flirtatious sprinkling of the fire-roasted pastor and pickled carrots from the salsa bar.\n\nA hawker streamlines his way through the tables offering small bouquets of roses intermixed with other flowers. He also holds a slightly beat up pink teddy bear with an early Valentine's Day premise to be sure. The mother of the family sitting next to us bought her self a rose. Her husband looked on while a broad smile spread across her face. \n\nNow lets talk about what put a smile on my face. I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35). She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive. The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention. The Aguas Frescas are served in Greenware cups. Upon finishing a meal, the most prominent options are to recycle and compost leftovers. I revel in the taqueria's proactive eco attitude, unlike such unnamed businesses who \"urge\" one to recycle but do not even supply a recycling bin on premises.\n\nPerched on the back wall, a statue of Pancho Villa happily surveys the crowd with gun in hand. Speaking of security, a very personal touch is the officer who opens the door for each patron upon entrance. \n\n\n3071 16th St (near Valencia), San Francisco, CA 94103; (415)864-8840\nor http://panchovillasf.com\n\nDaily 10:00am-12:00pm.\n\nCredit cards accepted.", "author": "Sandra S."}

I got the vegetarian nachos and as a nacho connoisseur, I found them okay. The ingredients were definitely fresh, no doubt, as the tortilla chips were piled with a cut-up avocado, some shredded lettuce, loads of black beans, a few slices of tomato, sour cream and shredded cheese.  But when it comes to my nachos, I like them to be either fork optional. This means that you have enough sturdy chips that you don't need a fork for eating the entirety of toppings. The amount of chips was a bit skimpy. Also, I felt that prices were about a $1 more than most places for similar offerings.\n\nAll of this said, the fourth star is for the extras. I noticed that they  had a security guard at the door starting at 5. That definitely makes sure that there's a certain level of safety that you can't always guarantee at other places in the mission.

I loaded up on a carne asada burrito along with a corona and some hot salsa for my side of FREE tortilla chips...

I only got 1 bite in and my burrito was ice cold.  I take it to the counter and they were just going to reheat my food. I told them I wanted a fresh one and altho they complied it seemed like a hassle for them. Once I got the replacement burrito it was 75% vegetables with very little meat. For the price they charge... (almost 10 bucks for my tiny burrito) I can go to Pacifica to gurreros and get a burrito twice the size for just under 8 bucks.  My dad is a faithful fan of PVT but I can't figure out why.

The ingredients are so fresh, the salsa tastes like a fresh garden in your mouth! The chicken was flavorful and tender and juicy....not dry and flavorless like most burritos I've had recently. I couldn't finish it because it was the size of a human baby, but I enjoyed every single bite I could fit in my stomach.\n\nNight #2: Chile Verde Pork Burrito and horchata. The chile verde pork was even better than the chicken...didn't think that was possible. But, it was also tender and juicy and added a nice flavor to the rest of the bursting burrito. This was my first time tasting horchata. My inspiration to try this cinnamony drink was the song on the newest \"Vampire Weekend\" album, which sadly is probably the case for a lot of people. I've got to say...I'm not a fan. Too gritty for my taste, but I was happy to finally taste it.\n\nI will come back to Pancho Villa on many of my San Fran visits to come.

They definitely have things ironed out, as the ordering process is efficient and they get a lot of people coming in and out of their doors.\n\nMy carne asada plate was delicious, but the meat was neither abundant nor especially flavorful. It was worth a couple of dollars less than what I paid, but it was certainly not criminal--a great combo with access to their utopian salsa bar, with several awesome spicy salsas laid out for the taking, along with the usual onions/cilantro and some peppers, among other things.The horchata was satisfying, although it could have been any garden variety brew. My friend opted for a burrito, although I forget which one, and remarked that it did the trick, but was maybe short of inspiring.\n\nOverall, I can't complain (except about my $14 tab), and that defines my experience here. I came hungry and was fed well with a dish that satisfied my expectations but maybe not the yelp-hype, and deftly removed a couple of extra bucks from my pocket.

Sorry fellas, but I was definitely not impressed with my dish yesterday.  I know I was drunk and usually everything tastes so good, but yesterday didn't do it for me.  I came here after the Elite Yelp Event and Monk's Kettle and found myself forcing to feed on some good o drunk food, nachos and tamale.\n\nSo I came over here with Felicia C, Jason W, and Christina L.  I split the combo plate #2 with Tamale, Flauta, and grilled shrimp plus a Nachos with Lengua meat: $20.  Ok, normally I don't spend that much for mexican food, but you know, this combo plate $11 might have some merits.  \nThe tamale wasn't anything to rave about, and the flauta (even though i had Chevy's Flautas in the back of my mind) was what appeared to be just a Taquito covered under beans and rice.  The grilled shrimp was good minus the shell still being on there, but overall, this plate wasn't all that great.  \nThe lengua nachos could have had a little more sour cream, as I think that's what I ordered....for $6, that better be the one I ordered.  Lengua is Beef Tongue meat....its great.  I'm no longer the typical carne asada or carnitas meat orderer anymore!

They have great art up on the walls and you get to sit on these weird cubes at a cute wooden table. Everything I've tried here is fresh and delicious. I think I love PV because you get to walk along the bar and point at various ingredients and they make it to your order right then and there in front of you. I recently discovered you can order the 3 tacos meal and get 3 kinds of meat! \n\nThe downside is I had no idea what kind of meats I was ordering. Maybe I haven't looked at their vast menu thoroughly enough but I'm almost positive they don't list what your meat options are. This plus my fear of being rude and holding up lines plus the server's thick accent lead me to hurriedly point at random tubs of meat. I had no idea what I was ordering. The last time I came here I mistakenly ordered beef tongue. Although quite delicious and tender (as most people have described it), I flipped over a piece of meat and to my horror saw the surface of a real tongue with... like... taste buds. Being an ex-vegetarian all I could think was... Sick! At least my friend had a good drunken laugh over it.\n\nAside from that one incident, I have enjoyed my times and food at PV.

I stopped and thanked him for his generosity and told him how grateful I was that he gave us burritos back then. He was humble and kind and said he was glad to see me. \n\nI think he may be an angel. I say this because not only is he benevolent, he hasn't aged in the past 20 years, while I now look like I could be his mother.

I have been coming here for years and I have never been asked what kind of beans I wanted in my taco, because beans do not belong in tacos. \n\nI am not sure what the deal is, but something has changed.

This is simply the finest taqueria in the Mission.  I've lived in the neighborhood for about six years and generally make a point to try different spots to see how they stack up.  Taqueria Cancun, Farolito, La Cumbre, La Corneta, I've been to all of them.  Pancho Villa is by far the freshest and tastiest of them all.  I usually wind up getting the super carnitas burrito with black beans and mild salsa.  It cannot be beaten.  \n\nThe salsa bar is also to die for.  As a real salsa lover I feast on all of the options they present.  My favorite is the stone ground molcajete.  It's got some good kick, but not too much.  I love it so much that after I have scooped out all of the chunky tomato bits, I slam down the rest of the juice like a shot of tequila.  \n\nThe only downside to Pancho Villa is that not only is it the best taqueria, it is also the most expensive.

Just when you think you've got your order down, you see them cooking up a trout fillet and you think that's an infinitely better choice than the burrito you just painstakingly put together in your mind.

Arriving at 2p.m. on a rainy Saturday afternoon, we noticed a huge line in the restaurant. We looked at one another and thought, \"Wow, this place MUST be good\". I grabbed the seat while my BF did the ordering. We both each had a Pura Carne burrito; which consisted only of meat and choice of spicy or mild salsa. I had the beef tongue (yum =P) while he had the carne asada. They gave free homemade chips and you can get your own condiments at their bar. We both got bottled water and sat down. \n     As I was salivating, I tore away the foil so I could devour my burrito and took a big bite. Uhh.. It was like biting into wet water balloon filled with salt. My BF seemed to like his; the only thing he said was that it was kinda dry which he poured salsa into. I asked him how the they poured the beef tongue and he said it was from one of those steam trays. The good thing was that the chips were crispy and warm and the salsa selection was excellent. \n     The reason for the 3 stars was that it was not memorable. I mean the burritos wer ok, but not worth driving all the way down to the mission for. Also, the price for 2 burritos and two bottled water came out to $18.72. A small bottled water (smaller than half a liter)cost $1.75 each with a Pancho Villa label attached to it. It said something about being \"Green\" and helping the environment.

Super tasty, and well balanced... not as much of a carb overload as the standard burrito, but still ginormous.\n\nAlso, how nice is that security guard who opens the door for everyone? He's been working there as long as I can remember.\n\nTwo things prevent this place from getting 5 stars.\n1. I have on 3 occasions found parts of chicken bone in my burrito. That sounds like a lot, but I've eaten there dozens of times. And it's cheap food, so I just take the bone out my mouth and put on my plate (on the far side, so the burrito obscures my view but my bf can still vomit in his mouth.)\n\n2. WTF is up with that Mariachi band?!? I hate when they show up. The music is so loud that the burrito makers have to wave at customers to get their attention. At that level of ambient noise, \"Excuse me, sir\" - even shouted - goes completely unnoticed. It's difficult to maintain a conversation with someone right next to you. And then when they stop playing and I think  it's finally over, they walk through trolling for tips. And they will put that box right in your face. Go away.\n\nThe band doesn't work for Pancho Villa so I can't get too mad at PV, but I wish they'd ask those guys to leave. If I lived in the Mission, I'd take my food to eat it.

The tacos are perfect in portion while the burritos are pretty big.  Whichever I choose to eat, I top it off with my favorite aguas fresca, the limon (lemon-lime).

My brother got a steak and prawn one.  They were SO GOOD!!  It was like sex.  Ok, no it wasn't, but probably almost as good.  That's sorta sad now that I think about it ...\n\nAnyway, the carnitas had a great flavor as did the rice and beans.  They had a big selection of salsas and chili if you wanted to add a little kick to your food.  My brother had some green chili and he was sweating, but liked it a lot.\n\nI'd come back here again.

What I got at PV was two small steamed tortillas(ya need the oil man!) and a mountain of meat with some pico de gallo salsa on top. Well with the amount of meat they piled on there I would've just had two tacos. I understand that American like a lot of food, thus the obesity rates being on the rise, but I think they should make the tacos the traditional way and if some overweight Americano wants more food, then he can order more tacos. OK, OK, enough soapboxing. Sorry. But this is the food of my peeps and I don't like to see it bastardized.\n\nSo I order 4 tacos: al pastor, lengua, pollo asado, chile verde. The Chicken and al pastor were too dried out, but OMFG the lengua and chile Verde were off the hook! The meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. I even got my non-Mexican friend to try lengua tacos and he loved'em!\n\nI do have to give PV major kudos for their salsas...good selection, tasty and spicy! Another nice touch is the fresh radishes, lemons, grilled jalapenos and chilies del arbol. Now that's authentic Mexican.\n\nI also like the fact that their import beers are only $2.75...that's cheaper than the bars.\n\nLast thing I dig about the place is that they always have local artists works up on the wall.

In fact, my sister who lives in St. Louis, MO has me FedEx a burrito minus the sour cream to her and she is still in love with the place. Now I agree with Alvarito on the best burrito joint and in my opinion that's El Farlito (besides they have one in Oakland---hint, hint Pancho, the Uptown neighborhood so needs a good spot). But Pancho Villa is more than a burritto joint, I almost never come for burritos (why waste such good ingredients), I usually get the Tostada Salad with carne asada and pollo asado with refried black beans topped will garlic grilled mushrooms. I've eating this since 1995 as a sophomore in high school. Their quesadilla suiza's are great, taco dinner, the seafood specialties are all amazing. So while the burritos are good, this taqueria is more about good Mexican flavors (fyi, burrito's are American not Mexican). I prefer to have options and they have great options.

Who gives a shit about whether or not it's \"authentic Mexican\" when you're eating a giant tortilla filled with grilled meats, rice, beans, cheese, salsa, sour cream and guacamole goodness? If you want authentic Mexican, go grab some cow's brain tacos and catch a donkey show. \n\nIn the four years that passed since I moved away to Brooklyn (then Los Angeles), not a week's gone by that I haven't deeply missed the act of stuffing one of these bad boys into my stomach and sorting out the consequences later.

However, it's been a while since I've been back and my most recent experience there was just meh. \n\nI've only ever really eaten burritos there, so my evaluation of the place may be limited, but let me just say that I'm the ultimate burrito whore and have eaten many many burritos throughout my lifetime. And so, I have a strong basis for comparison. I ordered a deluxe chicken burrito the other night and was super excited about the size of it, which I give them credit for. But the chicken was dry and it was overloaded with black beans. Plus, I didn't taste the cheese until the last remaining bites. I also think they should include sour cream in the deluxe option. Maybe that's what my burrito needed to make it all the more appetizing. \n\nI loved the salsa spread though and the complimentary tortilla chips aren't all that bad. They also have a great selection of agua fresca flavors. And I like how they cook the food right in front of you. Right when you get in line, you just see slabs of meat being cooked on the spot.

When my buddy said we were going to Pancho Villa's I wondered if it was connected to the taqueria of the same name in San Mateo. It was quite apparent to me that they were connected as we walked in to the restaurant. Both places are quite similar. The first thing that you notice is the appallingly bright overhead lights. It makes you feel like you're in some cafeteria. Next is the confusing way to order. There is no apparent location for ordering (no, order here sign). You just have to wait for someone behind the counter to notice you. \n\nThe service here wasn't so bad (better than the one in San Mateo). But it still is a bit impersonal. The food was tasty, but my tacos were coldish. \n\nI visited the wash room, as is my habit. As I expected, it was pretty gross.\n\nI wouldn't go back here.

And the second thing you should know is that because of this I have very high snobby holding-all-Mexican-food-in-relation-to-SD opinion. Sorry, but thems the truth. \n\nNow, you understand when I tell you this is the BEST MEXICAN FOOD I'VE EVER HAD NORTH OF SAN DIEGO. \n\nI'm 100% serious. I live in a part of the East Bay where the Mexican is dismal to say the worst, ok at the middle, and bourgie \"healthy\"  crap to say the worst again (Chipotle? Baja Fresh? Cancun?).\n\nOk, but hear me out. Those are some harsh words. But I live in the its-better-if-its-a-hole-in-the-wall philosophy. If you have to fancify your restaurant with schmancy pants \"ambiance\" or a cute little motto \"No Trans Fats. No Can Openers. Blah blah\" - you're TRYING TOO HARD. The food should stand on it's own.\n\nAnd it does. The carne asada is cooked and seasoned amazingly and if I close my eyes maybe I can pretend that a warm breezy beach is only a 10 minute drive away and I can spend all day outside without the need for a jacket. Of course, then the bill comes and I am once again slapped in the face with the realization that I am in San Francisco (geez, I could get nachos for 5 bucks in SD). There's an amazing selection at the Salsa bar. And the desert is amazing! I had alfaros (the cookie things) for the first time ever and wooow that was a good end to an awesome meal.\n\nP.S. It's also amazing because it's really just a quick walk away from the 16th and Mission Bart. I wouldn't try to drive around here for sure.", "author": "Diana H."}

They're a very clean place and very very nice, which is cool.\n\nAs for the food, the tortilla chips were very good, and the choices of salsas were excellent. I got the al pastor burrito especial with sour cream (beans, rice, guacamole, cheese, salsa) for $8.50. It was a decent burrito. Not gross, but not the best I've had. The meat was okay; kinda soft, not much flavor and not enough meat-to-other-ingredients ratio. I don't like burritos with a lot of chopped raw onions, and this burrito ended up having a lot of that...plus green onions from the al pastor. It was a normal-sized burrito too..which means I ate the whole thing, and I wasn't stuffed silly.\n\nI also got to try the ingredients in a carne asada taco especial. The carne asada is quite good (at least this batch); it tastes like that grilled flavor. Yum!\n\nThe horchata was decent too, but not the best I've had.\n\nPrices are a little steep; I've gotten better in the Mission (bigger burritos, cheaper, tastier).", "author": "Angela H."}

I have eaten at Mexican places all over California and this is the best Mexican place EVER. Let me tell you a few things that make them a true, amazing Mexican restaurant:\n1. They not only have whole and refried beans, they have whole black beans AND refried black beans! Do you know how hard that is to find??\n2. Their frescas (fresh fruit drinks) are actually real fresh fruit. I've never been to a restaurant that has that. Their watermelon and canteloupe juice is to die for, with the little chunks of melon in it...mmmmmmm\n3. The churros are made there, not the little kind you see rotating in a box on a cart at the zoo.\n4. Fresh, free chips. I consider this a basic of Mexican food, but I've been coming here all my life so I guess I have high standards, but this is not a must at every establishment.\n5. The shrimp is amazing. They cook it perfectly right there and they are very generous. My surf and turf burrito had like ten shrimp in it.\n\nOnly bad thing I can say is they have raised their prices and decreased the size of their portions in recent years, but I think everyone has made similar changes since the 90's, and honestly that burrito was huge I didn't need anymore. I think it's worth the slight extra cost considering you can go to Chevy's or La Pinata and pay as much or more for food that is...well, lacking.", "author": "Eden S."}

She tells me she's addicted, so I sacrificed a trip to my favorite (Ti Couz) to indulge her.\n\nThis place is fine.  It's clearly incredibly popular, but I'm not quite sure why.  I had a Quesadilla Suiza with Spicy Chicken.  I asked them to make it spicy, and I guess that meant one or two jalapenos stuffed inside - I was complaining to my dining companion that it wasn't spicy like I'd asked when I got a mouthful of fire.\n\nThe salsa bar is certainly a plus, but it would be helpful if there was some signage telling you what the hell everything is.  Maybe there was and I just didn't see it, so dazed was I by the bright lights and diverse crowd.  But I had no idea what I was sampling.\n\nAlso, the quesadilla ended up swimming in its own \"juices,\" for lack of a better word.  When I had half of it the next day, reheated, it was much better because it wasn't all soggy, and the heat from the cooking didn't take away from the flavors.  So my advice would be to get it takeout.\n\nTo sum: takeout, if you like spicy use salsas instead of asking them to do it, and get a veggie burrito, cause my friend swears they're god's gift to man.

Pancho Villa Taqueria is Exhibit 553 in support of this contention.  Allow me to explain.\n\nAs I have previously bitched and moaned about, I've been working hellacious hours lately.  Basically, 10-12 hours days, at least 6 days a week, for two months straight.  But, whatever, it's not like I have a lot of other things going on in my life, so work is a fine way to pass the time.  But, there's a limit on exactly how much of myself I can carve up and give away without repercussions.  On Monday, I woke up, didn't feel all that awesome.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 11 hours.  Little Afrin kept the pipes clean.  Tuesday, woke up, felt kinda bad.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 12 hours.  Little more Afrin kept the pipes sorta clean.  Sneezed on and off all day.  Wednesday, woke up, felt totally like crap.  Really didn't matter, absolutely had to work.  For 11 hours.  Afrin didn't do a damn thing.  Sneezed constantly, used up half a box of Kleenex.  Thursday, woke up, felt like I'd been beaten with a baseball bat.  Didn't matter, had to work.  At 11:00, I turned away from the document I was reading for 2 minutes to read an email, turned back, and couldn't find the place on the page where I stopped reading.  Because none of it was familiar.  Okay, no biggie, started reading from the top.  Halfway through, turned away for another minute to answer another email, turned back, couldn't find my place again.  Realized that my continued presence at work could constitute malpractice, went home.  Where I still worked for another 3 hours, but mostly from the prone position.  Friday, woke up, felt like a bag of smashed assholes, looked even worse than usual (if you can believe it), stayed home.  Took 2 DayQuil and a variety of other stuff.  Worked maybe 4 hours.  Seriously contemplated flushing Blackberry down the toilet so people would stop calling me.\n\nBy supper, I was actually feeling pretty decent.  Not all the way healthy, but better than I had for days.  And my sister-in-law and her fiance were visiting.  So, after a dinner of leftover Chinese food at our place (not my choice, long story), we head out to meet two of sis-in-laws friends.  They also live close to the Mission, so we pick a nearby place I like.  And by place, I mean bar.  And I'm feeling pretty decent, so I drink:\n\n1 mint julep;\n1 Crown & Coke;\n1 12 oz. Watermelon Wheat Beer with a whiskey chaser; and\n1.5 liters of some German beer beloved by the guy in the group from Munich.\n\nNow, just so we're all on the same page, those bottles of Pepsi that sit in your refrigerator door, those are 2 liters.  So I basically drank 75% of one of those, in beer.  Now, at this point, between the massive quantities of pharmaceuticals that are coursing through my veins, and the alcohol, I'm easily not in my right mind.  But I'm not an idiot, and I know that the half-serving of Kang Shao shredded beef I ate 5 hours ago is absolutely not up to the task of fighting off this quantity of alcohol.  Reinforcements are needed.\n\nEnter Pancho Villa Taqueria.  It's basically between the bar and my place, so it's the natural choice.  I split an enchilada dinner with my soon-to-be brother-in-law, wifey and sis split some nachos, and friend and German guy split a burrito.  I also have a watermelon agua fresca, because I think it'll go great with the watermelon wheat beer I had an hour ago.  Plus, I smother the enchiladas with hot sauce and a healthy helping of extra jalapeno slices, because how would that ever come back to haunt me?\n\nFast forward to 5:15 a.m.  I wake up to find that a small army of industrious dwarfs are building a mid-rise, mixed-use building inside my skull.  And it's a problem.  They're violating all sorts of building codes, they don't have the proper permits, and it's not even an approved use for that particular plot of my frontal lobes.  I sit up to have a word with them, and the bed turns 8 or 9 complete circles and dips up and down a few times like a log ride.  I burp 4 or 5 times in rapid succession, and its....watermelon and jalapenos?  Not 2 great tastes that taste great together.  I quickly lay back down and manage to organize a brief union picket that temporarily brings the dwarfs' construction project to a halt.  I am faced with three choices, in descending order of what would actually be a good idea: 1. go to the bathroom and prematurely reintroduce my midnight Mexican meal and accompanying alcoholic pickling juice to the world; 2. go get a drink of water; 3. roll over and go back to sleep and pray things turn out okay.  I try 3, but can't get it to happen, so I compromise on 2.\n\nBottom line: I would probably be in worse shape, but for my trip to Pancho Villa.  That being said, it's now 12 hours later, and I can still taste my meal.  And not in a completely good way.", "author": "Ben P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-10-24", "description": "This is not the best Taqueria on the block. It is actually one of the weakest, if not the actual weakest of the bunch, though they do a couple of things very well.\n\nWhy, then, does it have lines out the door and constant crowds? \n\nLaziness and herd mentality. Think about it:  where is Pancho Villa located? Exactly between BART and the Valencia area bars where it is presently fashionable to get drunk. And people love to rationalize, they won't say \"We're settling for this because it's convenient, and we settle for it every weekend.\" No--- That would be admitting to second best. So they say \"You have to come with us to this exceptional Taqueria we discovered while exploring. It is the best that this edgy new neighborhood we found called 'the Mission' has to offer...\" And there is no reasoning with the intoxicated. \n\nPancho Villa over-salts everything. I feel closer to a stroke every time I eat one of their soggy, inconsistent, assembly-line burritos while sitting on their broken, uncomfortable seats. A lot of salt is one thing. A whole god-damn salt-lick is another. Their dry, stale nachos, though not quite prison food, are lowly. (In the indignant words of the late Matt \"Uncle Matty\" Oreto, \"How do you fuck up nachos!?\")\n\nAs alternatives, Mariachi's has a much wider selection of much better-crafted Burritos for about the same price, with accompanying novelties like mango salsa. And if it's basic Mission-authentic you want, go around the corner to El Castillito, next to the porno store on Mission--- solid, cheap, real.\n\nNow, that said, Pancho Villa makes a very, very good quesadilla. The prawn quesadilla is great, while the juicy garlic-mushroom quesadilla verges on excellent. So it's not like there isn't a reason to go there every now and again. \n\nTheir much-touted salsa bar is pretty damn good, too, though it is inconsistent, and they seem to change salsa recipies at random.\n\nAs a parting shot, though, back about a year and a half ago, when the city's living wage measure passed, Pancho Villa was the first restaurant that I observed in San Francisco to take it out of their customer's hides by jacking their prices.

The jamaica tasted a little more watered down that I would have liked. The shrimp was juicy, but the rest of the quesadilla was extremely, extremely meh. It was quite large, but it was mostly lettuce and some beans, hardly any cheese. I was extremely confused how the laws of supply and demand worked out so that this meal cost me 12 dollars.\n\nToday, as part of my quest to find the best horchata on the Mission, I stopped by here again. I got a burrito especial with lengua, which costs 2 dollars more than a regular meat burrito because it comes with guac. The tongue was juicy, tender, and better seasoned than El Farolito's on 24th. The rest of the burrito was, again, meh. They put too much rice, which itself doesn't have much flavor. The guacamole was runny and I couldn't really taste the avocado at all. Very, very meh. \n\nThe horchata is pretty good,  though it's a little pricey because of their biodegradable cups. 3 dollars for a \"large\" that is more like a medium? I'd rather hop 2 blocks to La Oaxaquena for the same if not better quality but much cheaper. \n\nMy lunch again came out to 12 dollars. The burritos are large, yes, but not that large. Most of all, taste wise it just didn't seem worth it. My quest for the best horchata in the Mission continues, but I won't be making any more stops here.", "author": "Polly F."}

There I would find Pancho Villa. And so I did, and I was happy...for a while. The demise of their quality began about 4 years ago when I bit into a chile relleno burrito I'd ordered there and it was DISGUSTING! The egg batter-fried shell the chile relleno had was hard, crunchy and too greasy (it's supposed to be supple and smooth with the texture of an omelette), the green chile was hard as well, the seeds hadn't been removed, and the cheese in the chile was chunked inside, not fully melted. Ick. Never again. I stopped going there.\n\nThis week I found myself in the Mission trying to grab a late night burrito with my honey only to discover that one of my favorite places, El Toro, on the corner of Valencia and 17th (yes, I know it's owned by the same people who own Pancho Villa but it is WORLDS better) is under construction and closed! The wait was too long at Puerto Allegre, also another favorite of mine and we didn't want to go all the way over to El Farolito on 24th and Mission (my absolute favorite for tacos de carne asada) as it was getting late. So, we decided to give Pancho Villa another try. Big mistake. We shared a carne asada \"especial\" burrito with guacamole, cheese, rice and refried beans. The burrito was soooooooooooo salty. The guacamole tasted like someone had literally dumped a whole shaker of salt in there. The saltiness was so overpowering I couldn't even finish my burrito half. Past that, the carne asada was so completely bland and tasteless. \n\nIn their defense the service is great, fast, the place is clean and they do have a decent little salsa bar, they still fry their own chips (unlike other taquerias in the Mission), the Horchata is okay, and the musicos playing mariachi is always nice, too.  If only it were as good as it looks. Sigh. But, a good burrito is a good burrito, and alas, Pancho Villa does not a good burrito make.", "author": "Dee I."}

I have yet to eat anything that comes close to an authentic burrito that you can find in southern cal.  Two burritos (non-supersized), a XL juice, and a churro was $23.  Why?  Burritos should be cheap.  I just want a $4 carne asada with gaucamole.  No beans, rice, sour cream, dust, or flowers.  Gemme my meat and advocado.  The burritos here can really add up if you decide to make it a super with cheese, lettuce, sour cream and some other random things.  You can also make it wet (*snicker*) for an additional cost.  So if I made my steak and prawn burrito a super wet steak & prawn burrito it would have cost almost $15.  Crazyness if you ask me.  The quality of the meat however is pretty good but on the dry side for my taste.", "author": "Fatty A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-12", "description": "I generally go to Pancho Villa twice a week, 'cause they're the only place open late after the climbing gym closes on a weeknight. It took me a while to learn how to order a burrito at PV, but now that I've learned all the tricks, I find it really hard to top their burritos. Other places may hypothetically have better burritos, but unless you know how to order it, you're likely to make a wrong choice somewhere and end up with something less than the theoretical best.\n\nSo here are my tips for ordering a burrito at Pancho Villa:\n1. For fillings, go for carnitas, chorizo, grilled veggies, or chile relleno. Although the grilled chicken and carne asada are tempting, because that's what you smell cooking on the grill, I think they're too dry.\n2. When they ask if you want \"mild or hot\" salsa, choose option (c) Molcajete [roasted tomato & chile] or (d) chile verde [tomatillo & avocado]. They're way better than the out-of-season pico de gallo-type \"mild\" and \"hot\" salsas.\n3. All the beans are good. Whether you go for whole (black or pinto) or refried (also black or pinto) is a matter of how moist you want your burrito on a given night.\n4. Unless you can really pack it away, go for a baby burrito. It's still too much burrito for all but the most ravenous appetites, and it'll put your total under $5.\n5. Add cilantro and green onions. They don't cost extra, and they add kick.", "author": "Jessica J."}

One heaping very small scoop of meat, ams with the rice and beans. there can't be more than 3 oz. of meat in that whole burrito which cost almost $7 with tax. (Other burritos being made by other staff looked much the same in what was being doled out.)\n\nI asked at the register about that. I pointed out that it was essentially the amount of meat put in a soft taco.

I noticed the prices have gone up and the portions have gone down on at least one of my favorite things (tostada salad). I'm guessing the same has happened across the menu.

My favorite (kids don't try this at home) is the all meat burrito.  I typically get the steak all meat burrito with their medium salsa, and cheese.  I call it the Mexican cheese steak.

They also offer some healthier choices like whole wheat tortillas and tofu. It's a nice touch that they have these choices, but it kind of takes away from the authenticity of the place. One of the best qualities about burrito places is that the service is usually fast. Sadly, the service here was really, really slow. I don't know what the hold-up was.

Anyways, I got hungry and wanted to eat. Mexican food. And only Mexican food. So I started down Valencia and ended up on 16th. I went by I don't know, 3 or 4 places before ending up at Pancho Villa Taqueria (Rhyming makes it that much better). I remember stumbling past this place at 1am the last time I left Delirium. So I got about half way by it and looked in... Jesus Christ there were a lot of people!\n\nThe store front's not that big, but you look in at 12pm and there's about 934 people eating there. No shit. So I figure what the hell, it must be ok. I'm greeted at the door by a security guard who opens the door for me?? Where the hell did I end up? The Ritz Taqueria? There's actually about a 5 minute wait to order... This place is tripping me out. Feel like Johnny Depp in Fear and Loathing. And strangely, there's actually some cool paintings on the wall for sale. Slightly over priced but nice non-the-less.\n\nI will say that the service SUCKED with a capital SUCKED. But it's a Mexican restaurant, I expected nothing less. So no minus points there. The lady that took my order and made my veggie burrito was not what I would call, umm nice. Well, more like unfriendly would be a better description of her attitude. But again, it's Mexican food. After another 5 minute wait to get rung up, I made my way to the salsa bar. What a selection. And by the 10 plus awards on the wall, I gather that   it must be good. I settled on something that has jalapenos (I like to sweat when I eat) and made my way to my seat. The food overall was really good, there were a good amount of people inside which is generally a good thing, and the busser that came around to take my plate called me \"sir\". Works for me. I'll be back.", "author": "Adam S."}

The stupidity inherent in that calculus should be obvious.  The Mission is slowly being ruined by bad taste.  Can't we just set a limit on the number of taco bells allowed?\n\nBurritos are stupid.  You know what the best burrito is?  A taco.  Why spoil delicious meat, lard-fried tortillas, and great salsa with beans and rice?  Please, hipsters, stop ruining Mexican food with your demands for big burritos.  Rice and beans, especially at a taqueria, are virtually guaranteed to be less than stellar.  If you wanted a good beer but also felt like you wanted to fill up your stomach, would you ask for a giant glass of equal parts beer and water?  NO.  You wouldn't.\n\nWalked in here with high expectations as it came recommended from people I respect.  Ordered three tacos al pastor (the proper way to gauge a taqueria's quality), which cost $3 each or $8 for three.  The meat was old and had been reheated so long it had become stewed.  There was a choice (Yay!  A choice!) of beans.  I had to ask for no rice.  \n\nOye! Pancho VIlla:  Tacos do not have beans (or rice FFS!) in them!  Tacos also should never cost $3.  Al pastor meat is BARBECUED not stewed.  Tacos should have grilled, or at least warmed, tortillas.  And Tacos should NEVER be served on a flour tortilla.  \n\nCall this place what it is:  Tex/San Diego-Mex.   Yuck.", "author": "Nick V."}

Ok onto the Pancho Villa Review.  First things to note is the long line even though there are a million mexican places on the block and the fact that you order at the counter and the girl/guy you order from makes your personal item...My personal favorite is the Steak & Prawn Quessadilla Super (lettuce, tomatoes, guac, salsa) with half spicy and half regular salsa.. They skillet the prawns right there and then mix it in with the steak. :) Amazing!  If you look on their wall you can see the awards for their salsa over the years.. It is truly the bomb!  Their Guacamole on the other hand i found to be decent to weak.  The green sauce in the salsa bar is sooo good. I like to add all the cilantro and lime and mix it in.

Try Guadalajara or El Farolito on Mission and Onondaga.  They're across the street from each other but you can't go wrong at either place.
