Pretty long wait during lunch time obviously but it was surprising for me that they didn't have any of the order ahead app meals ready. My order through Ritual and a bunch of Meal Pals orders needed at least a 10-15 min wait for them to make it. Took about 20 mins for my friend's juice to be made too. She had to get up to check on it twice and at one point the waitress had to come over and asked again what was ordered because they couldn't read what was written down.

The two customers who came after me were clearly regulars, and he said \"the usual?\" to both of them. Love a place like that - great customer service.\n\nNext up - the price is great. Smoked salmon bagel sandwich + large iced coffee for under $9. Can't beat that in SF, much less in the financial district.\n\nAnd finally, the food - the bagel was better than many of the bagel-only shops around, the smoked salmon was fresh, and the coffee was strong and delicious.\n\nI will definitely be coming back here for more takeout breakfasts.

Although the Morning Glory is healthy, the ginger and tumeric might have been a bit strong for my personal taste.  Thus, I asked for an avocado smoothie that wasn't on the menu.  Not only did he make one, but gave me another experimental one for free given his desire to optimize his recipe.  \n\nThe music fades into the background in a way that allows you to work and talk.

No, it's still a great place to get a chicken salad sandwich or some pasta for lunch.

The cappuccino is also $3.50 and comes in those huge cups just like you was the King o' France living in Versace ...I mean Versailles. Service is very serviceable here, and I do believe it's the only cafe in the city where the server asks, \"How's the WiFi workin' for ya?\" As you know, most cafes usually have some curt message on the table saying you have a time limit unless you order a succession of meals.

Not the typical deli spear pickles you typically get in a restaurant or deli.  Curiously, the person I was with also ordered a sandwich and not once did the guy offer him a pickle or chips.  So must be a big deep dark secret with this place and they only give it to you if you beg.  I've been giving this place business for over two years.  It's cheap service like this and the attitude you get when you expect more to come with a $9.00 sandwich than a paper napkin, that makes you want to venture out and take your business elsewhere, which I will.

It's a great place to sip your espresso and people-watch from the cushioned benches in the bay windows or enjoy the view from the balcony of the quiet upstairs dining area.  Smooth jazz plays over the PA and the friendly staff will bring your food to your table if you dine in.\n\n  The food is prepared to order, and with a long list of ingredients there are thousands of options.  We ordered the lox and cream cheese bagel, a breakfast sandwich, and a substantial glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Our bacon-and-egg breakfast sandwich was fluffy, flavorful, and served on a massive ciabatta roll, well worth the price.  The orange juice was almost as much orange as juice.   Comparable bagel shops may offer more salmon on their lox, but our bagel arrived quickly, dotted with capers and accompanied with Persian cucumbers.  The food wasn't cheap, but little more expensive and much higher quality than the fast-food options in the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nThose looking for a quick bite to eat may prefer to try their luck elsewhere.  There was still a significant line even after the 9:00 A.M. morning rush.  Although we ordered together, our meals arrived a few minutes apart, but the food was well worth the wait.

One day I felt the need for greens and I gave the 3 salad option a try and OMG! Every single salad was not only palatable, but they were down-right good!

It has a European-style seating area, makes decent sandwiches, and have fairly quick service (a necessity when you're on your way to a meeting and your beemer is double-parked). So they definitely satisfy some essential criteria for lunch in yuppie-land. But then come the parts that weird me out.\n\nFirst, across the little corridor is another cafe or branch of the cafe. Or maybe it's the Bianco annex. Whatever it is I can't figure it out. They seem to have a decent salad bar, although I am far too fond of meat and carbs to eat that shit for lunch. It creeps me out and they should get their shit together and either make it one place, with a coherent decor, or just really make it obvious, and paint one place black or some shit.\n\nSecondly, there is a really angry man with a moustache manning the register. He doesn't seem to really have his shit together, and it takes a long time for him to ring people up, creating a long line. But I can only assume that he owns the place, because not only is he kind of short with customers, but he barks orders and complains to the sandwich staff, even though they seem to be working hard and (almost) never screw up my order, unless moustache man was the one who took it down. Mr. Moustache Man, if you are the owner, let your staff do the work, sit down with an espresso and the \"gazzetto dello sport\", and live of the profits. You're not helping!\n\nLastly, their lasagna sucks! I love lasagna, I eat it and make it all the time. But theirs is honestly weird. the beef is all pale, and there doesn't seem to be any bechamel sauce in it. it is like buying frozen lasagna at safeway and cooking it in the microwave, but it costs you $6 or so, instead of $0.35.\n\nDespite all this, I come all the time. It's literally across the street from my work, so it is too convenient. But stick to the ready-made salami-cheese ciabatta, or the melts. Don't experiment with the pre-made \"Italian\" food.

The crust was soft and not flaky as expected. The texture was odd, not unpleasant but different than any I have ever tried. I will give it snother shot since it is quick and close to work. But, Bianco won't become my go-to spot.", "author": "Mary H."}

Located inside an old office building, it faces out to Sutter Street, but is accessable through this easily missed lobby door that faces out to Market St (right next to GNC and 7-Eleven). There's also a nail salon and alterations shop in the lobby, and you can tell that the owners have been there for a long time. The cafe has a big selection, so if you are feeling up for anything, you'll be able to find something there. There's a big salad bar, where you can make your own salad for $5, a burrito station (I got a small chicken burrito which was quite good and the perfect portion for only $3.50), sandwiches, pastas and soups. Everything is priced around $5, which is great if you're someone like me who eats out practically every day. Very casual and nothing fussy, lots of seating and not too many people.", "author": "Connie C."}

I just walked by it yesterday, and thought again to myself, how happy I am that it is there. (Didn't have time to stop in and eat though.) Their sandwiches are custom made, and they're nice about tweaking things with whatver extras that make you happy. Soups, salads, lasagna... plenty of variety for everybody. They aren't spectacularly creative meals -- but just nice pleasant food, at nice pleasant prices, served by nice pleasant people. Good espresso drinks too. The thing I probably like the most about it is the ambiance. It's quirky there among the office buildings. Huge windows to let in a lot of light, and a somewhat European flavor to the decor.  Lots of little round marble tables to sit at -- and the best kept secret is that there are stairs off to the side and a whole upstairs section with even more seating (still with the window light) for when the place looks full. I really like supporting the little guys, and although there are probably 75 Starbuck's within a block of here, if you feel like sitting down and reading the paper and enjoying a good latte -- this is definitely the better option.", "author": "Zoe H."}

I recommend the Bianco Club on sourdough bread.  The Chicken Caesar is a nice choice too... the staff and owner are friendly...", "author": "Amar M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-17", "description": "I like their sandwiches. Quite a bit. And the price is OK. But again and again, I am put off by how unfriendly the two people behind the cash register are (the man with the moustache and a lady). The sandwich preparers are fine. I am not usually that sensitive to frowns, but those two just make me want to go money elsewhere. As if it's bother to take my money.", "author": "Victoria A."}
