I must say, it a sure win for a first try at this cozy, tasty and inexpensive resturant. On arrival there was an initial wait, but we ended up being seated speedily which was a good sign. The waiter was very sweet and took his time to explain our choices from the menu while giving us great suggestions. \nWe started with a plate of banchan(Korean sides) then worked our appetites to all the rest of these amazing large meals:\n\nKorean short ribs- tasty \nKimchi fried rice\nPotstickers- yummy \nPot of spicy\u00a0tofu with seafood soup(Amazing!!)\nSweet and spicy chicken wings- tasty \nCrystal noodles-tasty- yum\nFire spicy chicken w/ rice cakes \n\nMy fav was the soup, I could stop eating it.\n\nWe were able to share all the plates amongst the four of us. At the end we were all completely stuffed with the yummiest n tastiest foods ever and our bill came out to less than $80 which was nothing in comparison to what we ate and was very impressive.\n\nThe only downside, which is really not much of one, is that there were no non alcoholic beverages except water. \n\nWill definately be going back for great food, ambience, service and awesome price.", "author": "Ivie O."}

I went to bathroom before I signed my credit card.  I checked my bill and saw a 18% gratuity/tip was included. He didn't tell me gratuity is included.  We (2 people) shared 3 dishes. (Fish Cake Soup, Pancake & Somen) It's ashamed that the male server put 5 guests (circle in Blue) so that he can add tips (party 5 or more, gratuity is included). \n\nI checked my credit card voucher tip section left it BLANK.  At the bottom, there were suggested tips which suggested tip amount even more (it's based on the 18% tip + Order Total = amount circle in Red). This is so wrong and sneaky. I do tip when I go out to restaurants & bars since tips for servers & bartenders are part of their income. It's necessary to tip the servers & bartenders. It's upset that they don't even care about how their patrons feel about this scam and they continue doing so. (Hint: I am not the only victim) \n\nMy receipt is attached, I had to write down \"Included\" in the Tip Section for both of the merchant & customer copy to indicate TIP IS INCLUDED in the bill. \n\nDefinitely, I will not return to this restaurant again.", "author": "Neko N."}

All I wanted was some Korean comfort food to end off the weekend; the gloomy weather made it the perfect evening for some soon tofu.\n\nThis restaurant is really dark. The interior is small and cozy, but it honestly gave me the heebie-jeebies due to how unclean everything felt. Probably good that the lights were dim. I can usually grit my teeth through these things if the food is bomb, but that wasn't the case this time.\n\nI ordered what I came for (the soon tofu), and also a kimchi fried rice. I'll break each of these down...\n\nThe soon tofu didn't come with white rice. I suspected from the price point that it probably wouldn't, and I would be willing to pay a bit extra for that. The first thing I noticed was that the soup stopped bubbling almost right after it was set down on my table; I didn't get the hot and spicy sensation that warms you up. It was all sort of... lukewarm. No real flavour, as all I could taste was the spiciness, so it all felt a little flat. Almost tastes like something made from packaged soon tofu mix.\n\nThe kimchi fried rice... was also meh. Was also sort of warm, but not hot, and it definitely didn't taste like it was fried. Maybe cooked over medium heat. \n\nIn general it just felt like these two items weren't  made with any care. At first, I was relatively excited about the low (relative to the rest of SF) menu prices, but after finishing, it feels like maybe the prices are a bit high for the quality and quantity that you get. Perhaps I ordered the wrong things, but this wasn't like ordering seafood at a steakhouse... this is ordering Korean food at a Korean restaurant.", "author": "Calvin Z."}

Not many options, even in SF but I had a craving for Asian\u200b food that night and remembered that Cocobang had open late. Cool! Let's\u200b head there\u200b. And with the new cool Yelp feature of a digital WaitList (VERY COOL GUYS!!!) I would not even have to wait that long this time, cause normally this place is packed anytime.\n\nOk, this time it wasn't\u200b, maybe the reason why I\u200b change my formerly\u200b\u200b good review\u200b to a \"naja\" one. \n\nFirst the good things, Portions are still so good. Even I could\u200b finish everything\u200b.  And it is fast after you order. The Sweet Corn Cheese Plate is still a stable to go for - five stars for this. And also the free appetizers are so good! It is still a dive restaurant more a hole in the wall kind of thing but that is totally ok, it would be a great idea to reprint some of the menus cause they are pretty messed up. But other then that I can live with the surrounding. \u200b\n\nBut then came the chicken, which once was so good and I was sooo disappointed\u200b this time, I was so shocked I totally forgot to tip :( \nSorry to the waiter you did a good job.... will make that up to\u200b you next time!\n\nI had two different types of chicken the fried chicken with green onions. And the chicken in sweet tangy sauce. Both sauces have been good, But when it comes to the chicken it was as we got the bad part of the day. It was gooey (but not in a good way) not crispy (both parts) and with a lot of fat (more like a fat duck than\u200b a lean chicken) it was no pleasure to eat at all! I saw that the patron on the next table hat the same chicken and he had the same look on \u200bhis face and was fighting\u200b with the pieces of chicken as well. He left more on the plate then he had eaten. \nSo did I. \n\nI will come back, cause the first two times I have been here having been\u200b\u200b just great, so I hope this was just a bad chicken day from the delivery farm! I will take the risk cause having a good Asian Grill at night is so important for this late night cravings. Please, guys,\u200b \u200bcheck your best Parts: the chicken.", "author": "Martin W."}

I think it was $15.99. The portion was good on the ribs, but they did not give enough Bulgogi in my opinion. We also ordered the fried chicken wings which came with a side of chopped cabbage with heavy spicy mayo sauce on top. I would recommend them to Ding that sauce into more of a ginger citrus sauce instead but the chicken wings were to die for.

Super simple, but super delicious! And lots of good burnt cheese to munch on. \n- Pan Fried Clear Noodle w/ Vegetable - simple.. clear noodles and veggies, but absolutely yummy! \n- Fried Chicken w/ Hot & Tangy Sauce - super yummy fried chicken.. I definitely wouldn't consider it to be hot, so don't be thrown off by that if you don't like spicy. Be careful when biting in, because some of the wings have bones and some don't. \n- Kimchi Pancake - one big pancake served with a delicious dipping sauce. It's more bread-like than an actual pancake. I'd recommend it as an appetizer to share with the table. \n-OB Pitcher - just what it sounds like! A pitcher of cold beer to wash everything down with. \n\nThey're also open late night, so we went after a concert for a super late dinner and it was perfection. \n\nMinus one star for the poor food safety score..

But most of all, they have a nice wide selection of Korean food and a decent selection of Korean drinks (a couple of beer choices and soju cocktails).\n\nThe cheese corn is really good, as are the potstickers. I've also recently started really enjoying the beef tofu soup - I ordered this as a pickup order and it didn't disappoint. It's also highly recommended to order the fried chicken (my favourite is the one which comes with green onion).\n\nIt can be quite loud inside as they're open late and cater to people who want to primarily drink, primarily eat, or do both. So you might find yourself seated next to a rowdy table or a quiet couple depending on your luck. But overall it's a good time.", "author": "Joe B."}

It was a joke, the amount of noodles in the take out box barely cleared a quarter of the box. I pick up a chopstick full and it was already half the portion. My husband packaged the meal back up (luckily we live close) and went back to the restaurant. They told him the portions were smaller because it was an appetizer. What the fuck?

I've seen this place a lot so I tried to go once on a saturday night, and found the wait way too long because the seating is pretty limited.\n\nSo, on a weekday for dinner, I ordered some hot and tangy fried chicken through Eat24. The estimated time on Eat24 was 45-60 minutes (are you srs) so I called to ask for a better estimate, and they said around 15 minutes! yay! the food arrived in 20-25 minutes, which is pretty good. \n\nDELIVERY: The chicken and side salad, which both had liquidy sauces were in a clear plastic container. And the sauce was all. over. everything. in the plastic bag. Unfortunate. But not surprised because this plastic container was definitely not meant to hold liquid. Also, fried chicken with vegetable right next to it for takeout? no bueno. vegetable gets warm and weird, and the chicken gets super mushy. I ordered the food only about a 5 minute drive away from cocobang and it had cooled down immediately.\n\nNOW FOR THE ACTUAL FOOD: besides two wings, the chicken pieces were nearly the size of my fist. that means wayy too little sauce for each huge chunk of chicken. Also, the water from the salad had washed off some of the sauces of some of the chicken pieces. The taste of the sauce itself was fine, though it was just sweet and sour rather than hot at all. Also, the pickled radish that comes with the chicken side was definitely not ready. It had not been pickled long enough because besides the vinegary sauce that you taste on the surface of the radish, there was no taste inside. \n\n$16 for a whole chicken, $3 delivery, and $2 tax.\n707 has better chicken.", "author": "Grace P."}

The corn cheese, is basically what it sounds like, corn and cheese on a hot skillet, was a nice appetizer. The fried chicken was juicy, but a little bland.

Daebak!! \n\nCocobang's kitchen is a one-woman show. This cute ahjummonie is badass. Regardless of how packed they are with drunken patrons, the food still comes out fast and hot. \nI've been here 3 times so far, and have never waited longer than 10-15 mins each time. \nOr maybe I just didn't notice the wait because there's always cute korean kpop-like waiters running around, lol..\n\nBanchan flavors are spot on and plentiful. The kimchi has just the right amount of sourness and spice to it. http://bit.ly/1LhqTTO\n\nI can't tell you anything about their mixed soju drinks ($12.95), since we only drink Chamisul Soju ($10.95) straight out the bottle. None of that frufru shet.\n\nThe full menu is extensive. They even have dried file fish and cuttlefish as anju (Korean equivalent to the all-American beer nuts).\n\nWarning: Pics may be a bit blurry due to excessive soju drinking. Chee hoo! \n\nFRIED CHICKEN ($9 for 1/1; $15-$17 for whole bird):\n1) Regular/KFC: Thin crust with a distinctive crunch thanks to a coating of corn starch. This was our favorite.\n2) Hot & Tangy/Yangnyeom: Tossed in a sweet vinegary spicy gochujang sauce.\n3) Garlic Sweet Sauce\n4) Green Onion/Padak: Glazed in a sweet soy mustard sauce and covered in a mound of spring onions. \n\nWe got the combination of the regular fried chicken and the spicy yangnyeom one. \nhttp://bit.ly/1STa4Fh\nThe regular KFC was a clear winner of the two. The sauced up chicken was too soggy and the sauce itself just tasted overly sweet.\n\nGALBI ($15.95): \nhttp://bit.ly/1MQQjc2\nThe marinated beef short ribs were tender and flavorful. \n- Price was a bit stiff for just just 2 pieces (which they cut up to make 6 pieces).\n\nKimchi Fried Rice ($10.95): \nhttp://bit.ly/1PK3ErR\nI wasn't a fan of this, as it was too sweet for my taste.

The slices of hot dog in it was also flavorless and overpowered by the sauce. \n\nFRIED MANDOO ($7.95 for 6 pc):  \nhttp://bit.ly/1MwKxgD\nThere's a good amount of pork in their small mandoo, with just the right amount of glass noodles and tofu.

You get a mouthful of ripe kimchi in every bite.\n\nCHICKEN CUTLET ($12.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1ONdniK\nI wasn't impressed with their version of chicken katsu. It was thin and a bit dry. Their sweet \"special sauce\" tasted like it was ketchup-based. \n\nSPICY TOFU SOUP ($10.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1MQQuEo\nChoice of protein- Seafood, beef, pork, kimchi or vegetable.\nChoice of level of spiciness- Mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy.\n- This bubbling earthenware of goodness hits the spot after a long night of partying. \nThe broth could use more depth in flavor, perhaps more kelp and dried anchovies when boiling the broth? But the silken tofu just melts in your mouth. My tummy (and poor liver) were quite happy.\n\nSPICY PORK ($12.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1QGi6C3\nIt's a nice change to find thinly sliced pork butt/shoulder being used instead of the thicker pork belly. What you end up with is just tender bites of lean porky goodness.\n\nBEEF BULGOGI ($14.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1Nz6w6q\nGrilled marinated sliced beef. Simple, delicious and goes well with just a hot bowl of rice. \n- You can combine any 2 sizzling bbq for $16.95.

But pretty good portion sizes for the price so you're getting a good amount of food for what you're paying. The first time I got the deukbeokki with ramen. The ramen noodles were too soggy, would not recommend them. The second time I got a kimchi pancake and part of it was burnt. The parts that weren't burnt tasted okay though.\n\nGood location if you have late night muniches, but wouldn't come here for dinner again.\n\nEdit: Came here again and was met with the most awful customer service. The waiters were extremely rude and condescending.", "author": "Cassie Z."}

We got there right when it opened so there was no wait, but make sure your whole party is with you or they won't seat you.\n\nTo be honest the food here isn't that good but the soju drinks are pretty cheap so I can see myself coming back. For food we ordered all the different flavors of fried chicken, and it was just that, fried chicken dipped in different sauces. To me they seemed over cooked because the inside wasn't juicy and the outer shell was overly crunchy/hard. We also got the kimchi fried rice, cheese corn, and jap chae. The portions for the latter two we're a bit small, as for taste they were all typical.\n\nFor drinks we ordered the apple, mango, yogurt, and peach soju. They all tasted like juice so if that's your thing go for it! Be careful when you pour it though because the fill it with crush ice and you can easily spill. Overall though I wouldn't get a ton of food here but this place is good for soju juices.", "author": "Jacqueline T."}

Walked around late one night and we decided to go w/ this place rather than Philly cheesesteaks. Rob ordered the beef and I ordered the spicy chicken. Each came w/ white rice, kimchi, and other small tapas-style stuff (I don't know much about Korean food). \n\nTwo words that describes the place rightfully: \n\n- small \n- always packed \n\nIt was either hot in the restaurant or was it because we had a sodium overload w/ our donut burgers earlier but I must have taken in at least 6 glasses of water during our wait. Rob kept refilling my glass before we realized I drank hella. The wait was nice because we got a chance to talk about our life... he got to know me and I got to know him, too. He became my initial motivation towards a healthier life. He's my best pal. When I stand next to him, I feel out of shape because he's so cut but since I met him, I went down 9lbs-11lbs and I cannot be happier w/ myself. We have not hung-out since that night but we kept each other in check through random texts from time to time. It's nice meeting people from all walks of life that has the same mindset as you. Thanks for linking us, IG! \n\nAnyway. \n\nI had 1/4 of my sizzling spicy chicken platter and he had more than 1/2 of his. It was very good. Mine had a kick to it. I loved that the chicken was juicy. I did not eat the rice but Rob benefited from it. Service was super friendly. Even the patrons were friendly and fun. We boxed the rest and on our way back, we got hustled out of the to-go box. Oh well... hope the couple that hustled us enjoyed the food as much as we did. \n\nThanks for treating, Rob.", "author": "Tram N."}

To be perfectly blunt, if it wasn't for the Korean eye candy of a waiter with braces who helped us, I probably wouldn't even give it 3 stars. Upon entering nobody greeted us. I get that it was busy considering it is Memorial day weekend but even an \"I'll be right with you\" would've been nice. I walked towards the back (where the register is) and asked an older gentleman how long a wait for 3 would be. He said about 10 minutes, however didn't ask for my name or anything. My family and I waited to be seated near the front door. That's when the tall, cute, friendly waiter/server asked if we'd been helped. I told him we were waiting for a table upon which he said it would be about 5-10 more minutes and handed us menus while we waited. He told us we could even let him know if we were ready to order while we waited.\n\nThe food was alright. I've had better bibimbap elsewhere. Again, I realize it was busy so instead of waiting forever to get the check handled, I walked up to the register to pay (thank goodness that cute Korean server was working the register). He apologized that is was so busy. I told him it was understandable and that it happens. It was nice to see that he was still friendly and apologetic since the other 2 servers seemed a bit more overwhelmed/annoyed. \n\nWould I come back for the food? Probably not. Would I come back to watch kpop videos playing on the wall/to see/talk to that attractive and nice waiter? Yes. Yes I most definitely would.", "author": "Jessica N."}

We had to wait approximately 20mins before we were seated and its just two to us. It was dinner time around 630pm. We noticed two tables of guests where there when we were waiting to be seated and even after we paid the bill, there were still there. It's lovely to hang with friends over good food and drinks, but I can't imagine how the business survive with the limited turnover of their tables.\n\nAnyway, we ordered glass noodles, fried chicken, spicy pork tofu soup and a strawberry soju.\n\nBy the time we were seated we were really hungry, thankfully food came swiftly. They served Korean  appeitizers, not the best and from what I last recalled, the portion is much smaller now. The glass noodle was fantastic and so was the spicy pork tofu. The fried chicken which supposedly was one of their key highlight wasn't that great. The last visit, I tried another version of the flavored chicken and they were good. \n\nLove the strawberry soju. Taste almost like drinking a strawberry soda but highly potent one. With Est to have 20% alcohol content, you find your heart racing and all warmed up if you down them too quickly. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal apart from the disappointing fried chickens.

So my older cousin usually reorders another soju, but he didn't: too weak.\n\nThe fried chicken with hot & tangy sauce was sweet. The pork cutlet with special sauce was sweet, sweeter than the fried chicken. I would get the fried chicken again to share. I really liked the salad that was paired for both of those dishes I just mentioned before: half of the plate was of salad: really good portions. The beef short rib was really good. The girl told us the kimchi fried rice was like one person portion.. we ordered way too much food though. For four people: I would say get 1 only if you must order it and grab 2 if you don't order a lot. But it be safe to just order one and see how it is before and then order another one if wanted. We all agreed that their kimchi fried rice wasn't the best. We pefer 'The Garage''s kimchi fried rice more however.\n\nNow onto the army soup which was a favorite amongst all of us, but I think I would prefer a simple kimchi hotpot or a regular tofu soup over that just because the spam/ham makes the soup a might sweeter. It was really good. And it was something I would have ended up ordering to try if my cousins didn't want it. \n\nI think for me: I would avoid anything tany or anything with the special sauce here and stick to spicy stuff in hopes that it's more savory..\n\nWe ordered the bigger sized portions for where there were two size options.. it was way to much food but great as leftovers. If you choose to order a lot: maybe just do half-portions to try out different things.", "author": "Lilian L."}

They deserve it for the fried chicken, and now more. \n\nYes the fried chicken is still so yummy. Personally, I still prefer mine without the sauce but if you do, there is a garlicky alternative to the standard red hot sauce. A new discovery though - the green onion salad. Totally works as it's a bright salad that goes well with the crispy fried chicken and definitely more flavorful than the standard shredded cabbage slaw. \n\nBut in my numerous return visits, I've samples SO much more and Cocobang does a good job at more than just the fried chicken. Let's explore some of my new favorites here: \n\nCorn cheese - It's exactly like it sounds. Sweet corn and melted cheese in a hot skillet. So addictively and gluttonously satisfying.  \n\nBraised pork feet - Would not typically order the dish but saw a lady next to us enjoying a whole plate of it so I knew I had to get an order of these tender trotters. The meat is flavorful and pairs well with the kimchee.\n\nBoiled pork with spicy daikon - if based on description alone, this dish does not seem appetitizing but it's deceptively good. The pork just works with the spicy pickled daikon, raw garlic, and kimchee. \n\nPan fried clear noodles - I guess this is jap chae and I'm pre-disposed to like it. Cocobang does a decent one. \n\nSteamed Korean sausage - This took a while to get used to texturally. It's not as odd as coagulated blood but there is definitely some element of it. Not for everyone but worth trying if you're curious. \n\nOf course all the other usual favorites like bibimbap and spicy tofu stews are on the menu. I always come back for some Korean fried chicken and Hite beer but have now expanded to new, sometimes odd, parts of the menu. Through the many return visits I've come to know the folks here more and they really are lovely albeit frantic on busy nights. \n\nOne of my favorite places for fried chicken and beer hands down.

Otherwise, a Korean establishment, THAT'S OPEN UNTIL 4AM, which serves bossam, army soup, and pork neck stew, should be venerated in a city with a giant black hole where Korean food should be. This isn't the Sunset or Richmond, where you've got Han il Kwan or Toyose. You're on freaking Taylor Street, and you've found an oasis of actual Korean food. Bow down. Service is quick once you get seated, but be prepared to be rushed. These guys only have two servers, and they're hauling ass to get to all the tables. They're also probably pissed because of all the drunkards coming in and giving them crap or not being able to order properly. So, sit, order two bottles of chamisul fresh, a couple pitchers of hite, their original fried chicken (deliciously double-fried), some bossam (excellent portion size), and kimchi fried rice.

Thus, when I come to SF, I'm drawn to get to my fill of Korean, Filipino, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Burmese, etc. food. Given Cocobang's proximity to my hotel, I fell into its orbit. I anticipated Korean fare reminiscent of my beloved Crisp in Chicago. This was no Crisp.\n\nIt's not my fault to make such a comparison. Cocobang was all, 'my chicken is too good, chile'. You betta eat it!' So, I did. It was ok. It was no Seoul Sassy.* The banchan was ok. The rice was ok. The cabbage with pink sauce was the work of the devil. My overall experience was ok. In a city packed with tremendous depth of quality Asian eats, Cocobang can be missed.

Luckily by the power of Late Night Munchies divinity, we got seated at 3:25PM hallelujah!\n\nOrdered the Kimchi Fried Rice, BBQ Kalbi, and Pan Fried Rice Cake w/Ramen Noodle (topokki).

I've had this dish at almost every Korean restaurant I visit. I even MAKE kimchi fried rice and I can tell you that their sunny-side up egg, sausages, kimchi, and spicy paste all marinate into this plate of heaven. Definitely. Get. This.\n\n.....BBQ Kalbi:: Was decent. It was definitely sweetly marinated (usual guzzling Korean marinade sauce) but there was like only about 8 pieces for $14+...Not worth it! Came out on your standard sizzling plate with onions and we had to ask for white rice. Odd that it does not automatically come with rice??\n\n.....Pan Fried Rice Cake w/Ramen:: This is my friend's fave dish since there are not many Korean restaurants that make this but oh boy... It looks completely spicy and appetizing but when we bit into it, it tasted like the cook accidentally dropped a CUP of sugar into it! I've never had such sweet tasting noodles yikes! The rice cakes were delicious and soft though, and the the hard-boiled egg was mediocre. I would've preferred a soft-boiled egg haha.

I ordered the strawberry soju which was strawberries blended in soju, almost like a daiquiri but not as icy. It was pretty sweet and towards the end, I couldn't drink it anymore because there was too much sugar. \n\nThe bulgogi was really good and I ate it all, very good marinade. Probably one of the best I've had. However, the rice accompanying it was not good, it tasted kind of old. The banchan were not varied and not very good. No kimchi!!!!! What the hell? How can you be a Korean place and not serve kimchi? I almost cried, seriously. \n\nThe ddukbokki was okay. I mostly ate the dduk and left the other stuff. It came in a kimchi type sauce, not gochujang like I'm used to. So it was kind of watery and the veggies in it were not really cooked.

I was staying at a nearby hotel and lo and behold - Cocobang! They're a friendly establishment that seems to be mom and pop ish. I can't confirm this but the place is tiny and the owners were working the restaurant.\n\nI got the kim-chi fried rice along with the half order of the hot and tangy fried chicken. The kim-chi fried rice was decent and had bits of pre-packaged hot dog in it - strange twist but I enjoyed it.  Fried chicken were a mix of boneless meat, wings and a drumstick. I assumed they would all be wings but this kept me on my toes the whole time I was eating. It wasn't as spicy as I would've wanted but I can see how the amount of heat would affect others so I won't knock them for it.", "author": "Quoc N."}

We strolled in on a early Saturday evening and half the tables were filled.\n\nFood:  Pretty solid Korean food, as we tried the Jap Chae, hot & tangy fried chicken and kal bi.  Portions are decent and the food arrived hot.  The chicken is quite good, but note that they are saucier than the ones served at SO or San Tung.  The beef and noodles were good too, but nothing that stood out to me.  The fried chicken is the star.\n\nService:  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our food arrived after a minimal wait and he made sure that our water glasses were filled.  \n\nLocation:   Situated in lower Nob Hill/Tenderloin, this place is easy to find.  Parking might be an issue depending on the date/time of arrival but there are parking garages/lots nearby as well as metered parking\n\nAmbiance:  The restaurant space is somewhat small and dark.  Tables, which are packed together, are for small parties so I would not recommend this for large groups.  This is a great spot for pre or post bar-hopping, or a late night meal or snack.  Patrons were mostly on the young side and I would guess the majority of them were students. \n\nGreat spot for Korean food if you are in the area.", "author": "Melissa L."}

I go here because they are open late, so I don't need to rush over since I work late also. All the favorite Korean cuisine is here, along with all the beer and soju you can possibly have. ;) The staff here is awesome as well.

Because they're usually double fried, creating an extra crispy layer of fried skin.. And helloooo, who doesn't love crispy chicken skin? You won't be seeing me raising my hand anytime soon.\n\nSo what's the verdict with Cocobang's fried chicken? Well, it's pretty darn good. In my opinion, their fried chicken with the hot and tangy sauce is more tasty than their original fried chicken recipe. The original recipe is just too plain jane for me. If I want regular fried chicken, I'll just go to Popeyes and buy myself a bucket. (Not that I have done that yet or anything...) Other notable dishes were: assorted seafood pancake and pan fried rice cakes with ramen.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad place to go to get your Korean food fix on. But man, they are seriously lacking on their variety of ban chan. I adore Korean restaurants BECAUSE of the ban chan. This place only serves 3-4 different kinds of ban chan, which is simply not good enough for me.", "author": "Annie S."}

That is one of the things I would go for everytime. I definitely recommend the Hot and Tangy Chicken. Don't be intimidated by the name, it was not spicy. It was almost like a sweet and sour kind of taste, but with enough punch of flavor to make you have a conversation with your friend for 10 minutes about how delicious it was. I recommend getting the whole order of fried chicken if you aren't planning to get anything else. That is about a good 10-11 big pieces of fried chicken. What's the best part? 8/11 times, your chicken pieces will not have bones. THAT'S JUST FABULOUS! \n\nI usually try not to eat fried chicken, but if I do, it would be from either San Tung or Cocobang. Bigger question, which was better, San Tung or Cocobang? Honestly, I LOVE COCOBANG way more. Flavor profile for both are great, but Cocobang just does it a lot better. \n\nIf you are into the chicken and beer culture, definitely give this place a try. I have seen this place fill up to its ears with people waiting in line. Try to get a reservation or just go early enough so that if you have to be on the list, you'd be near the top. I was at the bottom of the list and I think I have waited an hour only because some groups just gave up and left. What I love about their system is that, you don't write down your name on the list, you write down your phone number so that if there is a table for you, they will call you and wait for you to come back to the restaurant to seat you. That is a great system. So if you know you will be waiting in the hour, instead of waiting in the cold for an hour, you can just walk around Union Square or just that Lower Nob Hill area. They have cute little shops, like this coffee place Joy's Place if you want to warm up. If you want to doll up a bit, you can head down to the nail salon to get your nails done before you go back to the restaurant. \n\nI think the only sad part is that they only open for dinner and not lunch I believe, which is fine, but their chicken should be served during the day because it's that good.", "author": "Cynthia D."}

It does however have great food and excellent speed of service. The staff there are super friendly, and good with K-food novices like my friends. The atmosphere is trendy, young and energetic.

It's the second place I've tried, and it's better than Aria because their chicken actually has skin on it and isn't just dried up lumps of batter.  I got the sweet sauce chicken, it's really more savory with garlic :)\n\nThe salad on the side has way too much dressing!  But otherwise, it's a good pairing.  Some of the banchan, shredded radish tasted a little funny/weak.\n\nThe oden wasn't very good and had a weird taste the next day because they put jalapenos in the broth and it bittered the oden.\n\n10% if you pay Cash!", "author": "Alice S."}

Based on the reviews, I had assumed that the order would take an hour and was surprised when the restaurant informed me it would be ready in 15 minutes (which it was!).  \n\nLoved the ddukbokki with spicy chicken.  The ddukbokki was my favortie part of the meal.  It had the perfect texture and was covered in a sweet, spicy sauce.  The spicy chicken was also good.  I was NOT a fan of the cheese corn however.  Loaded with mozarella, you would think that they couldn't go wrong but the corn was too sweet .  It tasted like canned corn mixed with a lot of sugar with mozarella on top.\n\nLoved the late night hours.  I can't think of a better place to eat at 3 am in the morning after a night out.  Tried it a few times while staying in the area would definitely recommend if you are looking for a late night after-party spot.", "author": "Linda H."}

Their food is actually pretty good, but people usually come here when they are done with going out to the bars or finished clubbing.\n\nHere are some things to try:\n1. Chicken wings. They have really good chicken wings here.\n2. Kimchi fried rice is one of the best i've ever tasted. They make a mean kimchi fried rice.\n3. Soups are always a safe bet although watch out, it can get pretty spicy.\n\nCons:\n1. They will take away your SOJU AT 2AM! DRINK IT ALL BEFORE THEN.\n2. Ask for all your stuff prior because getting their attention again is pretty hard.\n3. The line sucks. Sometimes you wait for over an hour if you are not lucky.

It was a little saucier than I'm used to, but the flavor and spiciness was exactly what I was looking for! It was a generous portion of soft and chewy tteok, ramyun noodles, fishcake, veggies, and a hard-boiled egg. Kalbi is another must order dish whenever I eat Korean food. Their spicy kalbi was very delicious.  A little sweet, a little spicy, and very tender short rib meat. We also ordered the cheese corn. Cheese and sweet corn...mmm.

Will come back to super small at the end.\n\nMenu has a good variety.  But their prep capabilities are fairly small.  The thing about Korean communal eating is the Ban Chan.  This was not that very good or creative.  If you are only going to have 3 items, make the distinctive.  This was mostly soy sauce, sesame seed oil and gochujang.  I actually had to ask for Kimchi and to be honest, it was the very best part of the meal.  If they make their own, that rocked.\n\nBibimbop - they do not do dolsot.  The veggies were really cold over rice that was overcooked and a tiny bit of meat.  The cold veggies and the sunny side up egg, not sure that was exactly a good idea but I did.  The vegetables were a bit nondescript.  Anyhow, it was ok, but really just OK.\n\nBack to the small place, be prepared for everyone to hear your conversation.  I was 2 feet from a table of 3 that were discussing the merits of THC in Marijuana varietals and the positive effects of mushrooms on individuals with personality disorders.

We felt like Korean food out of nowhere and wanted something warm or hot because of the cold weather lately. Hopped on yelp and found this place, so why not try it out!\n\nWalked in and was able to be seated right away. They gave us a giant carafe of water and menus. The carafe was a good touch because we are water drinker extraordinaires. We sat and browsed the menu, but of course referred back to yelp. We ended up ordering the Spicy Tofu with beef, the sweet and spicy fried chicken, and seafood ramen. \n\nThere's a big screen above the cash register area playing K pop videos and the music blaring. We sat closer to the front of the restaurant so the music wasn't too loud. The seating is a little crammed so we were very close to some guys sitting by the window talking business and throwing gigantic numbers out about the new worth of social media companies... that's how close we were. We asked for forks when the waiter brought out our food.\n\nFirst the chicken came out. It was pretty good. For a half order they gave us about 6 big pieces with cabbage and dressing on the side of the plate. The chicken itself was flavored pretty well. The sweet sauce on top was a little too sweet but it was still good. We ate all of it. A MAJOR plus was that only one of the 6 or 7 chickens had bones the rest was boneless. Awesome! After about 10min more our main entrees came out. The spicy beef tofu had a really good flavor and came out in a small hot pot. Loved it. Good flavor and enough to make anyone full. The seafood ramen was just as good. Served in a real pot brought me back to my days of living cheap and eating ramen out of the pot I boiled it in... nostalgic. The seafood ramen had clams and muscles. They tasted good enough that I had to eat each one. There was also shrimp in there as well. The size of the pot was slightly bigger than the pot the tofu came in. \n\nIn the end we LOVED it.

The chicken (according to my sweetie) was excellent, and comes with Korean cole slaw.  I had soondubu with seafood, which made for a full meal and was spicy with a nice mix of shrimp and clams.  The clear noodles were good as well.\n\nIf you're not drinking, it's pretty affordable; was about $17 each for us.  I'd eat here again.

Sometimes, you'll need to wait about 15-20 minutes for your seating, but they are always pretty honest about how long it will take to get you seated.  Also, the waiter takes down your phone number and conveniently calls you 5 minutes before your table is ready.  This gives you plenty of time to waddle over to Owltree (bar next door) to have a few beverages before dinner.\n\nI really like sitting in the booths.  It feels like you have your own table service as you order Chum Churum and OB.  The waiters are all very accommodating.  Plus, this place is open super late in case you are super hungry after a fun night out.  \"It never fails\" as my friend and I say!\n\nThere are 3 main things I like to order here:\n\n1. ARMY SOUP\n\nMy friend introduced this to me.  It's literally like kimchee chigae but with plenty more ingredients like spam, hot dogs, ramen noodles, and assorted veggies!  It's great on a cold night in SF.  Also, don't order much more if you're ordering the Army Soup.  It's huge, especially with the banchan on the side.\n\n2. SPICY PORK\n\nYep, their Spicy Pork is really good.  It tastes pretty standard, but the environment at Cocobang is very fun, which makes eating the food fun.  I've traveled to Korea and this definitely lives up to the Korean BBQ you'd find there.\n\n3. SEAFOOD PANCAKE\n\nWoohoo!  I really enjoy the pancake here.  I like it when they don't put TOO much seafood, or too much dough.  That's why Cocobang does this really well.  The sauce is also very tasty.\n\nOverall, don't expect the food to be the best Korean food you've ever had in the universe, but expect good service, a fun time, and a great environment to hang out.", "author": "Andrew H."}

That probably caught some attention so let me focus back on this review. I have mixed feelings about Cocobang. I do feel it has the best KFC (Korean friend chicken) in the main city area for sure even in comparison to 707. I also think the Budaejjigae (army stew) is pretty delicious here so props to them on both dishes. I think my struggle is that everything else is just OK. There is nothing wrong with that for a Korean Pub as people tend to go to these spots when they are slightly happy off alcohol. I think the biggest part that is challenging for these guys is that they have very limited seating so there has never been a time that I have waited less than 45 to an hour unless you come extremely early. The prices are reasonable I suppose but again just the wait alone for just a few notable dishes has to round this3.5 review to a 3.", "author": "Dan M."}

When you walk in, you'll see a smallish dining area with loud Korean music and dance videos playing on screens on the wall. It's a trendy feeling that somehow doesn't feel alienating. I am not a fan of k-pop by any means, but it's a fun atmosphere for a night out with friends.\n\nThe food is what I would call ethnic fast food--akin to Indian chaat, Chinese dim sum, and Turkish gyros. My go-to items are the bulgogi hotpot, the kimchi fried rice, the Korean sausage with silver noodle, and of course, the fried chicken two ways. That paired with some rice wine and soju makes for a wonderful evening event for me and my friends.\n\nThe service is great and super friendly. Although waiting times can be long, the servers/hosts always come out to acknowledge you and even bring out menus so that you have something to do.

Place was a loud with a couple of Korean people playing drinking games along with the music playing on their projector.   \n\nWaiting for about 10mins then one of the workers said if you don't mind, let me get your number and ill call you when the table is ready. I thought this was a nice jester especially coming from a small restaurant but hey, that's a big plus for customer service right there. So we to hang out at the hotel, \"Clift\" down the street which is a trendy swanky spot.\n\nAbout 45mins later, the restaurant called back and our table was ready. 4 of us was super hungry so we order the cheese corn, Fire spicy chicken with rice noodle, sweet and spicy whole fried chicken, Homemade noodle soup and the kimchi fried rice.\n\nCheese Corn: was ok, buttery with melted American cheese on a skillet.\n\nFire spicy chicken with rice noodle: this bad boy has a pretty good kick and I'm so glad i didn't get the \"Fire Burning\" chicken w/rice noodle.  My mouth can usually handle heat but this one was just right, anything hotter, I'd be crying a river. \n\nHomemade Noodle soup: Literally the noodles tasted homemade which came in a broth with small clams, carrots and zucchini.  The bowl was a very fair size and provided tons of noodles.  I added some of the fire spicy chicken in the noodles to give it a little be more of a flavor.\n\nSweet and Spicy Chicken: The portions were huge and came with shredded raw cabbage with a orange dressing.  This dish was delicious. I couldn't taste the spiciness especially after eating the spicy chicken before.  The chicken was actually all boneless which was to my surprise as i was expecting a actually whole chicken being cut up.  i wanna say it was a mix of chicken thighs/dark meat and 2 chicken wings. I'm more of a boneless guy so it was heaven to me.\n\nKimchi fried rice: this was spicy also but less than the spicy chicken yet more than the fried chicken.  A sunny side up egg was presented on top of the rice with a bed of Kimchi on the bottom.  Dish was good but just a little to greasy as you'll see the orange oil left on the plate and you can taste it.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say this is one of the Best Korean spots I've been too.

So along came I, with Anna D and Kazu O, after making the depressing discovery that we'd missed Katana-ya hours (no one among us seemed to remember that they'd closed an hour before).\n\nAfter a long (20-30 minute) wait in the cold, we finally sit down and order a kimchi fried rice, kalbi & bulgogi combo, and fried chicken (that they soon forgot). Overall, just okay food. Yes, even after drinking. The kalbi and bulgogi were not particularly notable, and hardness of the kimchi fried rice seemed to suggest that it was either undercooked, or really old rice.\n\nWhile there's a good chance that I may come back someday (or rather, be brought back someday) just because they're open late, it certainly won't be my first choice, as long as Katana-ya is still open.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Less than 10 minutes later the lady walks to the door and hands me a plastic bag with not one, but three plastic bins in it. Oh boy. I rush home like a giddy school girl leaving for holiday.\n\nOMG there's so much food and it all looks friggin' delicious! Start eating. Suspicions of food being delicious are confirmed. Unexpected side dishes included: a generous helping of coleslaw, bean sprouts with peanuts, some green stuff and some white chunks (I'd tell you what they are but I'm far too white and far too new to SF to know such things... soon, I promise. I'm getting better at this). Hot & spicy chicken is not hot - it's sweet, but that's okay because it delicious.\n\nAll this for only $9.73 (before tip). I'm totally coming back here for take out!

The service was friendly but we had a little bit of a communication issue - nothing that turned out to be problematic, though. We wanted to try a range of the menu, so we ordered the fried chicken appetizer, spicy chicken, and bibimbop, which we were warned (rightly so) was too much food for 2 people. The appetizer ended up being our favorite item. The main chicken dish seemed bland and nondescript, and the bibimbop depressingly came in a cold dish, making it pretty unexciting. I'm worried that I just ordered the dish incorrectly and missed asking for a hot pot.

Had to stop eating because it was burning my mouth and the water was gone too fast! But soooo gooood, thinking about it just gives my stomach a bit of a turn just anticipating the spiciness.\n\nService was TERRIBLE though. I know the place is tiny and probably can fit only 30 people max, and with 2 korean servers, it was probably really hard to accommodate everyone. But it took us 40 minutes into service to get our kimchi pancake, and he kept forgetting to get us water....\n\nAlsoooo, I know they won't serve you alcohol after 2 AM cus of the law, but not even at 1:45 when we promised we would finish our soju shots ASAP ):\n\nTIP: \n1. Call in before you head out here to see the wait, and reserve your name so you don't have to wait too long!\n2. CALL TO JUST TAKE OUT! Save yourself 1.5 hours here!\n3. Please get a cab back home!

From the 1st time I stepped foot into one, I have been bombarded by the hostess and waitstaff all speaking to me in endless Korean.  When I tell them I don't speak Korean...I have numerous times been scolded \"Shame on you!\" as they walk away shaking their heads. The first few times I was totally shocked and did not know what was up.  But when it happened to me with some of my Korean friends, they graciously explained to me that I look so Korean that the waitresses think I am an American-Born Korean that has grown up completely stripped of language and culture.  Pretty entertaining stuff huh?!\n\nBecause this has been somewhat of a neverending trend for me over the last decade, my love for Korean food has actually forced me to adapt to the situation.  After numerous failed attempts at trying to explain to waitresses that I am simply not Korean...I actually decided to make life easier and learn how to order in Korean.  From Bul-Go-Gi to Kal-Bi to Man-Du to Kim Chee Chi-gay to Kal-Gook-Su...I learned 'em all.\n\nSince then, no more dirty looks from the waitstaff...and endless tastiness for me.  Double bonus.\n\nOne spot that I recently got to practice my ordering skills was Cocobang.  Kinda hole-in-the-wallish but conveniently located a few blocks off Union Square, this place hits the spot if you're craving some Korean fare.  My personal faves are the Duk-Buk-Ki, Chap-Chae, and Bi-Bim-Bop...sooooo good.\n\nCheck it out...Ahn-Young-Hee-Kay-Say-Yo.", "author": "Justin L."}

I'm not a fan of wasting an evening in the avenues or the 'burbs for good Korean food, so Cocobang has a huge advantage on location while still getting the K-Pop blasting in the background.  The fruit juice soju cocktails come in carafe sizes, a real steal for $12.  The food is comforting and the hours are long, perfect for wrapping up a evening bender.\n\nCorn & Cheese: Canned or frozen corn spread on a metal plate as if it were short ribs with a nondescript melted cheese on top.  Neither the corn nor the cheese was exceptional, but I enjoyed the Korean interpretation of corn sides which are actually treated like appetizers.\n\nKimchee Hot Pot: I suspect this is really budae jjigae due to the presence of hot dog and spam pieces.  Comes satisfactorily bubbling hot in a metal pot.  The spiciness cuts the fatty processed meats well.  There was even some noodles in there, though I felt they were a bit redundant given the rice bowl.\n\nFried Chicken w/ Spicy Sauce: Ever since BonChon in Manhattan, I have been drawn to KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).  The skin is not as crispy or complex or delicate here, but the generous dousing of thick red sauce easily helped me overcome that.  Less like wing sauce and more like the sauce in bi bim bap, the spicy and the fried are a perfect pair.  Most pieces are without bone except the wings and drumsticks, so you can eat without worrying about pulling a Mama Cass.", "author": "Adam B."}

All of that said, last night I ordered the BBQ combo with chicken and beef bulgogi... I'll spare you the details, but let's just say I had some pretty bad food poisoning within several hours. I hadn't eaten for 8 hours prior to this, so I'm 99% positive it was Cocobang - something about the beef just tasted off. My guess is that the meat that they use is simply not fresh at all, and perhaps it's been sitting out unrefrigerated the whole day. Whatever it was, I couldn't keep the food down.

(45th and Noriega, in case you were wondering.)\n\nAnd Toyose is *great*, so when I stepped in here on a Saturday night after getting rebuffed at Katana-ya and their long line, I wasn't expecting a worthy substitute. But it was.\n\nIt was just the two of us, so we couldn't try everything, but here's what we got:\n\n- japchae (a \"small plate\")\n- bul dak (fire chicken) with cheese\n- odeng tang (fish cake soup), spicy\n- mango soju cocktail\n\nYeah.. it was way too much. It was all good, except for the bul dak could have been (heat) hotter. It ended up getting all goopy at the end and the cheese congealed way too fast. (try OB Chicken in Oakland Temescal for a better version of this.)\n\nWe ended up stuffed beyond all recognition and we still took some japchae home in a box.\n\nBut considering I don't have to waste 40 minutes of my life on the 71 just to get here - I like it a lot, and I'll be back to try the fried chicken and the budechigae!", "author": "Josh K."}

Debating what to eat last night, I knew this was the place when we drove by again.  After going around a couple times, we found parking less than 2 blocks away.  \n\nThe place is small and dark with music video playing - almost feel like a lounge but not quite, I actually wish it was.  Anyway, we sat at one of the smaller table for 2 (if you plan to order 3 dishes, be aware you will be space challenged) and started checking out the menu.  Many dishes sounded good and we didn't know what some items were.  After much debate, we decided on:\n\nfried chicken wings w/ sweet & spicy sauce - $7.95 - really good fried chicken wings, would be good w/o any sauce.  not oil, very crispy and not a lot of batter.  I like the sauce too and it came with a heaping side of slaw (thinly slice cabbage w/ like a Thousand Island dressing).   \n\nhomemade thick noodle soup - $10.95 - this was ok, we didn't know what to expect but wanted the homemade noodle.  the noodle itself was good but the whole thing wasn't very tasty.  i had asked for it to be spicy and i think he forgot.  the broth was a little thick and cream color - some sliced squash, carrots and potato and about 10 small white clams.  I think the potato may have been the thickening agent for the broth?  \n\npan fried chicken gizzard - $10.95 - delicious!  it was served on a sizzling platter, all gizzards with slices of onion, green onion and many many whole cloves of garlic that were simply melts in the mouth.  I know because I had quite a few and the garlic breath this morning was no joke!  If you love gizzard, this is a must - a perfect dish to munch with ice cold beer while enjoying the music videos.\n\n2 draft - $2.50each - domestic but not sure what it was.  $3 for imported.\n\nOverall, I love the ambience and really enjoyed the music videos.  It is a good mix of American and many Korean with mostly dance like music that was played pretty loud, which I didn't mind a bit!  \n\nWhen my crazy sister visits next time, I'll be sure to bring her here because I know she'll love the place!", "author": "Gloria H."}

Was he preparing a table for us? Were we expected to wait outside in the cold? After a few minutes of confusion, he led us in and we reasoned that maybe the place was too small for us to have waited inside. Still, an explanation would've been nice.\n\nLuckily the food was better than the service. We got the combination bbq (that comes with rice, kimchi, bean sprouts, and fish cake) and chose bulgolgi and spicy pork for the 2 meats. A little lacking in the side dish options, but the tables were so small we couldn't have fit more anyways. We also got the spicy kimchi stew to share. That came with spam, rice cakes, and ramen (judging from sight--my taste buds were on fire so I couldn't have told you the difference). Both the stew and bbq came in very generous portions and were more than enough for 2 guys and me--and I can eat as much as a guy! \n\nAnd the waiter that closed the door in our faces greatly redeemed himself by recommending us the kiwi soju, which isn't on the menu. So yummy, like fruity Starburst candy! Down a few carafes of that and you won't taste a drop of alcohol, but I'm sure you'll feel a buzz going! And the OB beer comes in a GIANT plastic bottle. \n\nWe came here for food to prepare us for the night of drinking ahead, but the flavored sojus and giant beer bottles, coupled with the kpop-blasting, typical Korean bar atmosphere, led us to start the pre-partying here too.", "author": "Yang Q."}

Do NOT eat here if you have a food allergy.\n\nGot in to this place for the first (and last) time on a wednesday night around 9pm, waited 30min for a table, but got to watch a projection of k/jpop music videos up on the wall while waiting, so it wasn't that bad.\n\nWhen we were seated, we were each given a glass of water in small, cheap looking plastic glasses. Normally I wouldn't care, but the water tasted like soap which was pretty gross. \n\nOrdered a tea for me and a beer for my girlfriend, and from there everything went downhill. I have a gluten allergy, it's a serious deal, and I made sure to mention it to the server. I was greeted with a blank stare (untrained staff) so I explained what gluten is and common foods that it's found in (noodles, soy sauce, etc) and at the waiter's recommendation got a soup while the Girlfriend ordered  some BBQ'd beef.\n\nSoup came... filled with Ramen noodles. Flagged down the waiter, explained that noodles are made of wheat (flour) and asked for a new soup without them. He said \"ok\" and 5-10 min later came back with a \"new\" soup. Poked around in the soup to check... there were still a few noodles in there, they just scooped out the ramen and gave it back to me. As I had explained previously, gluten allergy is kind of serious, anyone actually trained to work in a restaurant (which i was at 17, so I know it's not that difficult) has to know that this isn't a great idea. \n\nFlagged down waiter again, explained to him why this wouldn't work and saw some annoyance on his face, which was taxing as I'm was not doing it to be difficult, I really couldn't eat the damn soup. He promised a real new one which arrived 20 minutes later. With...did you guess it yet? Bits of Ramen in it. \n\nWe paid and left, Girlfriend was pretty PO'ed so didn't even touch her food and took it to go. No idea if it was any good. \n\nSo yeah, in sum, this place can kiss my ass.

(And in fact, I have gone back about a half a dozen times since I started this review 6 months ago.)  Perfect post-party place to eat.  Though I'd say get there at 2:00am, versus 2:30am so you don't have to wait.  It's a small venue that can accommodate parties of 5 or more, but pretty tight.  Venue is dark with candles and the blaring Korean pop idol shows (fun!) projected against the back wall providing the only real light.\n\nThe real star dish of the restaurant is the fire chicken!  They are perfectly crispy, tender, and spicy pieces of heaven...I mean, chicken.  It might be the best Asian spicy chicken I've ever had.  Nice that there are wings and boneless pieces, as well.  Oh, and can't forget to mention you can order a half (roughly 8 pieces) or a full order.  The cabbage with the thousand island like dressing is a good accompaniment as it off sets the heat of the chicken.\n\nOther dishes that are done right (as far as the ones I've tried): bi bim bap (though I wished they served the version in a clay pot, too), kalbi, kimchi fried rice, mandu-guk, kimchi pancake, and teokbokki (spicy rice cakes served with some veggies).\n\nCocktial sojus are decent, but very limited in flavors.  Since I almost see them as flourishing at late night eatery, you can get away with never trying their sojus...but that's just my opinion.  \n\nTo wrap up, since this review is literally 6 months in the making...Go for good late night Korean food with relatively quick turnaround, friendly and accomodating staff, and vibrant vibe (patrons included).  Recenly has become my favorite post-party eatery, but loses the final star for the shady stairs that descend to the restrooms.  Ladies in heels, be careful (or maybe I'm just clumsy).

The menu is decent, with a good selection of standard items alongside more nontraditional \"party food.\" While you won't find some of the amenities you'd expect from a Korean restaurant, most notably in-table or portable grills for cooking meat, certain things about this place make it unique and keep me coming back for more:\n\n1) The fried chicken with tangy sauce. Korean fried chicken has been gaining fame stateside due in part to write-ups in major publications like The New York Times and the SF Chronicle. Cocobang's fried chicken comes in a variety of flavors, and a $13 whole order could easily feed two people, though I tend to order one just for myself and bring home the leftovers (half orders are also available). Items like this, while decidedly nontraditional, make Cocobang unique among Korean restaurants in San Francisco, which tend to stick to the old staples, and remind me of trendy food spots in Seoul. If you or your friends are looking to try Korean for the first time, this place has a number of menu items like this that provide an easy introduction to a rather complex flavor palate.\n\n2) The homemade white radish pickles...especially as a compliment to the spicy chicken.\n\n3) The atmosphere. This place, while small, is over-the-top, and is sure to give your friends lots to talk about. Most notably, K-pop music videos are projected onto a large screen at the back of the restaurant while loud music plays. Kind of intense.\n\nI admit that San Francisco has a somewhat dismal selection when it comes to good Korean food, but if you are looking for somewhere fun and a little bit different, definitely give Cocobang a try.", "author": "Brian E."}

It's something I've always suspected but never wanted to admit: I don't think I like Korean food. \n\nBut I swear I'm not racist. One of my friends is Korean!\n\nAnyway. \n\nI came here last night after an evening of free drinks at a mixer in Nob Hill. After hob-nobbing with my roomie and some new friends, we headed down the hill for ramen. Upon seeing the wait at Katana-Ya, we walked around a few blocks until someone recognized Cocobang. Due to our starving bellies and low attention spans, we headed inside and only had to wait a few minutes for a table. \n\nThroughout the course of our meal, we thought we were going to have either 4, 5 or 7 people at the table. As we let our server know of each of our changes, they were extremely accommodating with different set up combinations of tables and chairs. I would have been annoyed by us, but luckily our waiter was not me. Also good since I wouldn't have understood what we ordered and served us fried chicken and hashbrowns.\n\nWe went family-style and ordered a plethora of dishes: the hot pot tofu, spicy chicken with cheese (temporarily thought I was at Chevy's), an assorted seafood pancake, kim chi fried rice and a bowl with many things I didn't recognize. Although I only liked half of the things on the table, the things I did like were well flavored and cooked without feeling greasy. The chicken was the highlight (I sound so white-washed saying this... of course I liked the spicy chicken the most) but I really enjoyed the pancake too. \n\nWould I come back here? Probably not. But that has nothing to do with Cocobang. The food came out really fast, the servers were patient will all our seating and food changing requests, my friends who like Korean food really enjoyed themselves, and it's a cute, cozy place for a cold Friday night.", "author": "Jared S."}

I have definitely leaned more towards the first, hence the 4-stars, which also reveals my state when coming here. At 2AM, when there's a craving for Korean food in a social atmosphere, Cocobang the spot to be. \n\nThe key is having the patience to wait for a table and also the tolerance for obnoxious drunkards which are the only cons to the Bang. Other than that, the food is quite solid and at an affordable price. They have the typical Korean hits like Kimchi fried rice, seafood pancake, Bipbimbop, etc. My favorite is the spicy fried chicken that comes with the a cabbage slaw.

Unfortunately it is only open for dinner so I can't go for lunch during work hours. \n\nSo we finally hit it up last Friday night after a marathon 5 hour happy hour excursion. I was glad to see mostly Koreans inside...must be authentic! Our waiter was super nice & we started with a large OB beer (in a plastic bottle, like a 2 liter coke!) & yogurt soju. It doesn't really explain on the menu but the price for a \"soju cocktail\" is really for a carafe of soju that you can share with your table. Great idea! I liked the yogurt soju & never would have thought to order it if it weren't for Yholl. Kinda reminded me of unfiltered sake. \n\nFor dinner we ordered potstickers, bi bim bap, & fire chicken. I had read all the Yelp raves about the fire chicken so we had to get it. The potstickers were just ok. I liked that they were crispy but the flavor wasn't quite there. The bi bim bap was better, in fact that was my favorite dish. Squeeze some hot sauce on it & you're good to go! The fire chicken was a disappointment. You know how things can be spicy, but not really have much flavor? That's the fire chicken. Plus it had these rice noodle logs mixed in so they looked like chicken but when you bite into them you realize it ain't chicken. I dunno, that was just a weird touch. \n\nAlso, no little plates. I don't know what those things are called but some Korean restaurants give you an assortment of little side dishes to have with your meal. Maybe we didn't order the right dish, maybe they just don't do that here, maybe it was cuz we were a bunch of white girls. \n\nI hate to say but there's a little Korean place by my house in Concord that has way better food.

I stumbled upon Cocobang and decided it had to be the best name for a restaurant since Pho shizzle. \nThe waiter recommended the fried chicken with hot and tangy sauce. Since it was on every table, I figured it was the best bet. The chicken was very moist but how can you go wrong with dark meat. The sauce didn't live up to the promised \"heat\" but was definitely tangy. \n\nWe also got the grilled octopus with somen. I think the octopus was sauteed and a bit tough. There was just too much sauce and threw the dish off balance. \n\nThe pan chan consisted of some turnip pickles, kimchee (good), bean sprouts (eh) and tofu (decent). I would have liked to see some roasted fish, silver noodles, etc. given the price point. \n\nHowever, this place is legit. K-pop videos on a huge wall, cute Korean girls in too tight, too short dresses, and soju everywhere.

Why it's become the de facto place for non-Koreans to Get They Bulgogi On, I'm not sure... maybe it's because it has an English name and they always give you a free plate of their supergross chewy chap chae? Their incredible ability to recommend exactly the same three dishes that all honkeys get when we go for Korean food? Whatever the case... meh. I promise. Next time you're in there, look around. Those Asians aren't Koreans. And if they are, they're there because their non-Korean pals suckered them into playing \"wise-and-all-knowing Korean speaker who can introduce us to your country's wondrous customs and delights\". Hell, I'd play host at Burger King in Pyongyang if I ever get the chance.\n\nAnyway, any consideration of the Best Korean Place always comes with an asterisk at the end of it, because the places are just not very good overall. The quality of the beef is poor, or the soondubu is too oily, or the kodeungeo gui is just not right because no one's ordered it for a week and the guy is just totally out of practice, or the waitress looks afraid to talk to you because you aren't Korean.\n\nTHEN I FOUND MY SWEET SWEET COCOBANG.\n\nThe food is exactly correct, the dudes that work there are in their early 20s, they serve all different kinds of latenight grub alongside requisite beer and soju, they play Korean music videos on a giant screen, they are open until 4am. \n\nI lived in the Hongdae area in Seoul (think Berkeley, in Seoul... or rather as Berkeley as Seoul could get).

Now from the outside it looked like a small bar. Went inside and it definitely could have been a bar, but instead you see tables lined up on each side of the brick walls with few dividers between the tables with pictures of Korean ladies jockin Soju drinks. The lighting is almost as dim as a typical bar/lounge, but enough so that you can actually see what you're eating. So the overall setting suits a nice urban ambiance. Lastly they play both korean and american music videos on a projector screen at the middle end right below the ceiling. It is loud enough that you can still hold a conversation over it, and if you run out of things to say you can always look up and be visually entertained...or not. \n\nNow lets get to the food. This isn't your typical Korean family restaurant. This place is mainly for those who have a quick hunger for some fairly fast korean food that especially cater to the after hour clubber/ barhoppers in the area. Therefore, it is open late.

B/c I know the effects of soju on my state of mind (As I recall my slurred speech and blurred vision from years before), we order food as well. The menu is limited, but definitely filled with original Korean dishes. Since I cannot handle Korean spicy very well, I ordered the Beef Bulgogi for $10.95. My friends originally ordered the spicy chicken, but they ran out of that as well and so they order the spicy tofu. He also asked if we wanted rice and so we ordered 2 small bowls. \n\nThe restaurant is rather dark and you can't really see the people around you. You do almost feel like you are in a K-town bar in LA sans the funky decorations, fluorescent lights, and trendy clothing. THe background music is all Korean which I totally love.... How can you not love Korean pop music or hip-hop? Who cares if you can't understand a word in the song except for the occasional English catch phrase?\n\nThe carafe of Peach-yogurt soju is presented to us with the 3 shot glasses. My friend pours it for us and we all take our shots..... YUMMY!!!!! The drink is a little frothy, but WHOOOOOEEEEE!!!! I loved the taste of it again in my mouth. Though this soju is not as strong as what I had originally in K-town LA, it sufficed and conquered my every tastebud in  my mouth. \n\nOur food arrives and the Beef Bulgogi is presented in a sizzling skillet. The waiter said that the portions were small. This portion was actually pretty good-sized. We couldn't finish it and I also don't eat much rice so that says a lot. Compared to other Korean places, the Bulgogi was perfectly cooked. It was not salty at all. The spicy Tofu was pretty tasty as well. Surprisingly, it was accompanied with beef or pork in the dish (or so we think????). It had a kick to it, but I wasn't going to devour it. \n\nIn the end I was very happy and the bill wan't too much...I am definiely returning to this place because where else can I have original soju...not just cocktails....", "author": "Lorna D."}

To make the start of this late-night meal worse, all we asked for was some hot tea, and our server couldn't provide any. His answer was because there wasn't any more hot water. \n\nUm. You have a kitchen, don't you? Is it THAT impossible to use a pot to boil some water? Our three items + beer + small pitcher of soju came out to $75!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-07-18", "description": "I liked this place, but  It's nothing like the typical Korean bbq's you've been to on Clement St. or in suburban malls.  You need to be a little adventurous if you go here - expect some surprises.\r\n\r\nThe site is the former Le Quiche (and, after that, it was  a tapas place whose name escapes me.)  Most of the patrons when I was there were young, hip and Korean.  My partner and I are none of those things, but we immediately felt welcome.  The vibe is laid back, with dark brick walls and Korean hip-hop and pop tunes played at a reasonable volume.\r\n\r\nA lot of the signage inside the restaurant is Korean, but the menus they gave us were in English.  The menus have little or no descriptions of the dishes - if you don't know what, say, beef bulgogi is, you'll have to ask.  And even if you think you know what you're ordering, you  can't be too sure.\r\n\r\nThe \"fried tofu with kim chee\" turned out to be kim chee with beef, with cold (un-fried) tofu arrayed around the edge of the platter.  Aside from the naming problem, the dish was terrific.  I've never been a fan of kim chee, perhaps because I've only had it served as a condiment.  Here, the kim chee was mixed with the beef for a peppery, garlicky stir fry.  And the cold tofu on the side was a brilliant touch - a cool and subtle contrast to the somewhat fiery kim chee.\r\n\r\nThe beef bulgogi was just what we hoped for, barbecued thinly-sliced beef in a slightly sweet and smoky sauce.  The sweetness made for a nice contrast with the kim chee dish.\r\n\r\nThe barbecuing here is done in the kitchen, not at your table as at many Korean restaurants.  This place also doesn't bring you the customary Korean spread of little dishes of pickles, kim chee, etc.  (It may be on the menu, but I wasn't looking for it.)\r\n\r\nThe only disappointment was the \"sizzling rice soup\", which is nothing like the version you'd get in a Chinese restaurant.  This was a very bland broth with sizzling rice floating in it - period.  No seafood, no vegetables or anything else to add interest.  When I asked, our waiter said this was a typical version of Korean sizzling rice soup; and that it was best eaten by spooning it over the top of your steamed rice (in an individual bowl on the side).  I've eaten a lot of Asian food and I like rice, but I just couldn't see the point of this very bland dish.  I can only assume that there's a better version of it in other Korean restaurants.\r\n\r\nThey have beer - Heineken and something domestic - but the waiter said you can only order it by the pitcher.  [At another table, a group of Korean men was drinking from a giant 2-liter plastic bottle of Korean-brand beer.  How did they get it?  Did they bring it themselves?  This place is full of the unexplained.  Go with it.]  \r\n\r\nThey also have a selection of shoju, a clear whiskey that's one or two steps stiffer than sake.  I rarely see shoju on menus in SF (even though every restaurant in Japan and, I imagine, in Korea would have it), and it's worth a try.  Wine is not available.\r\n\r\nOur tab for two, including a pitcher of beer, came to $42.  Darn reasonable, in this neighborhodd.\r\n\r\nIf you have set expectations about Korean food, this place may disappoint you.  But if you want a hint that Korean cuisine - or any ethnic cuisine, for that matter - is more diverse than what they serve at the \"international\" food court at the shopping malls, you will find this place to be an adventure.", "author": "Bob D."}

I WISH I had tried one of the chicken dishes, as it seems like that gets a lot of good reviews on here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-07", "description": "From what I know, I believe this is the only one Korean bar that you could find near downtown San Francisco and it is probably why there is usually a wait. The first time I went there because my friend who usually goes there wanted to go. He is the one who ordered all the food that night. We had a Chicken, which I highly recommend. It is a must if you come here, pork feet , seafood pancake and a spicy ramen with seafood. (The last one, I'm not sure about the actual name)\nI went again a week later because I fall in love with their chicken. There was one group of 4 people before my group. My friends and I, total of 5, we waited for almost 1.5 hours for a table. It was very strange that we had to wait that long because it wasn't even a weekend, it was on Monday night around 7.45-8.00PM.\n\nOverall experience:\n* I would go back only because of the chicken. \n* Keep in mind that it is not a restaurant restaurant type, it is more like a pub/ bar with a food. \n* It has only about 8 tables. So, may be you need to wait very long time because they won't rush customer who already done to leave like other places which has pro and con.\n\nService:\nIt was ok. I would say 50% that I was there, there was only 1 guy there while other time were 2. So, you might need to wave your hand a lot of if you need something. Plus, they often have a difficulty to understand owing to a loud music and their limitation of English. But it doesn't really matter if you don't need something special. \n\nFood:\n* I really like their Chicken a lot and I would recommend it. Other food is so so, nothing stands out or special.\n* Yogurt soju is ok. I don't think their mixture is consistency. Someday it was nice while the others weren't. There was one time that I got it with all ice was already melted which made it taste a little bid weird.  \n* You also get one free rice per dish. \n\nCost:\n* After about 10 times there, I would say that a price range is between $15-$20 per person if you don't' order alcohol drink. The first time I was there, it was around $30/person (out of4) because we order 4 dishes + a big bottle of OB beer. \n* They accept credit card but they won't separate more than 2 bills per table.", "author": "Alex J."}

Great success! I had been expecting a less authentic, fluorescent-lit atmosphere, but the place was dark, strangely high ceiling, packed, and we remarked upon arrival that I was the only white person on the premises. The bibimbap and japchae: solid. The soju concoctions: decent, a little pricey, but there is $2.50 draft OB beer, so no points are subtracted from the final score. The banchan was somewhat anemic, but then again, at these prices I'm cool with it. Especially since the main event, namely the spicy chicken, was plentiful and really quite excellent. (That cabbage with dressing on it though...what?) Patronage late at night tends towards rowdiness, but that also adds to the flavor of the experience.\n\nSo I'll be honest: if a few friends and yourself are looking to get some drinking on with decent Korean noms, under the everpresent light of projected K-pop visuals (I'd make a joke here about the Bat-Signal but whatever), you'll love this place.", "author": "Peter B."}

My favorite dish was the rice and fish cakes in the signature red sauce. The sides that run so plentiful in LA's K-Town (where I am used to eating my Korean red sauce covered foods) were not so great. \n\nMy vegetarian friend ordered the bibimbap and it wasn't served in those piping hot stone bowls which I think makes bibimbap taste as good as it does. \n\nAnyway, we drank some good beer and had some tasty sake along with these \"street\" foods so it was good overall.

Dark, edgy, crowded little restaurant showing Korean pop music videos on the wall. The servers are super cool; they look like Korean ex-skaterboarders. The food is also definitely pretty solid. The bibimbap rice bowl rocks, as well as the glass noodles appetizer. They also serve you Korean beer (OB?) in 1 liter bottles. This is definitely the scene come Fri -Sat as big crowds of Korean kids chill into the after hours. It's especially hilarious when a clearly lost family from the midwest shows up, or you find yourself next to a passed out businessman in a suit.", "author": "Aaron F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-03-24", "description": "I keep finding more and more late night eateries throughout this city. It's so unlike my home city (Boston) where there is only one or two late night food joints in the whole city. Cocobang! I live down the block from this place and I've always been afraid to walk in. It's intimidating when you walk by and you keep imagining that the 10 Korean guys smoking outside are in the Korean mafia. So to get over my fear (because I had always heard such good things about this place, and that they keep serving past 2) I got my closet Korean buddy to bring me. \nI think it might have been only the second time I've eaten Korean when I came here for the first time. The first thing you notice is the K-pop that is being broadcasted onto a white sheet in front of you and the monstrous ceilings (serious, you can fit a giraffe in there.) The second thing you notice is the small amount of seating in this place. I've never had to wait, but you can pretty much hear every one's conversation (and if you know Korean, you can understand it.) If sit to close to the door, you always get an uncomfortable draft. It might be cold air, it might be cigarette smoke... depends on the night. But if you are lucky enough to get a seat closer in, you will be able to smell the kitchen. Yummmmm. Good dim sum, good fried chicken, good barbecued beef. Some of their dishes are fucking HOT. Like \"ouch ouch ouch I'm dying, help... sweet merciful crap, end my life already\" hot. But you can get almost every dish \"less hot\" or as my friend Mikal says \"no spicy.\"\nOkay, the catch with the Soju: do not buy their flavored soju. It has almost no actual soju in it. A baby couldn't get drunk off it. BUT if you just buy their regular soju (which I think is a dollar less) you can get fucking wrecked. If they don't know what you mean by regular soju, just point to the soju ads (usually the hot chick holding a green bottle) that should be next to you or within 5 feet of where you are sitting.\nMost of the time when I'm dealing with a \"late night\" place o' eat I expect to pay a little more than I would... but this is a bit on the bullshit side. 16 bucks for some of their dishes... 12 bucks for soju? fuck me this is expensive. The service isn't anything to rant about either... or the decor. Very plain. It's cleaner than it is dirty... but I wouldn't call it clean. I guess you could call everything about average... but since the food is good, and it's open really late on the weekend, it gets that 3rd star. I wish I could give it a 3.5, but I can't (or can i?)\n\nOpen Late with some really good flavor. COCOBANG!", "author": "Zane C."}

There is a projector that plays korean music videos on a screen at the front of the restaurant. Even though the waiter was constantly busy, he was very nice and still got everything out in a timely manner. My friends and I ordered, rice cake with ramen which was sweet and spicy. The rice cake was very filling and the sauce was thick. The ramen was just a cube that looks like they got it out of a package and boiled it up and put sauce over it. Fried chicken with tangy sauce was okay. The chicken pieces were pretty big, some had bones in it still; the breading was drenched in sauce which  made it soggy. The chicken itself was juicy and more sweet and tangy than spicy, comes with a side of cabbage that I didn't touch. The food was very heavy, wanted something refreshing and green after it. Thinly sliced pig feet tasted like it was duck with a crunch. It came with three sides, a chili paste to dip, anchovies and kim chi. The anchovies were extremely salty, just a little taste of it would make you feel thirsty. They gave a lot of food and you wouldn't leave here still hungry.", "author": "Lyly T."}

People who can't handle spicy should not try it, because it is fiery, spicy, hot, burn your tongue, need to guzzle beer HOT!  If you need to test your limit, make sure to order clam soup with it.  They go well together.  Their lemon soju is very tasty.   We also had Korean blood sausage and it was little bit soupy but not bad.  I want to see more places like this open in the future.  I myself even thought about opening one!  ;P", "author": "Su Kyeong K."}

The spicy dishes were spicy, the fried dishes fried, and everything seemed pretty authentic.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to check it out, but if you're hard up for a bite, it's not a bad choice.", "author": "Patrick P."}

I realize this is not the reason you go here...more for the drinks and fire chicken, but com'n if you serve something, even though it's not the main point, it should be decent. The Soon-tofu tasted like hot pepper paste....go chu jang and the banchan,.,even at night i could tell they were really old and not fresh.", "author": "Nayeoung K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-06", "description": "i like this place, i thought the food was great. it did wreak havoc on me later on but i was a little prepared for it.  you can't put that much red pepper down your gullet without expecting some kind of chemical reaction.  i will say the beers rock and i drank a lot.  the ambiance was a little weird with all those posters of korean girls kind of staring at you.  definitely could have been a little more creative.", "author": "Anthony Y."}
