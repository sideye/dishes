I would say it is in my top 5 meals, and the first dish (monkfish with amaebi and truffle) was in the top 3 bites I've ever had. The waitress/hostess (who I believe is the head chef's wife) was incredibly friendly and seemed excited by our clear enjoyment of the meal. The frontage of the restaurant is nondescript, tucked away within the mall. But the decor inside is elegant and minimalistic, seating just 14 customers at a time. Despite this smaller setting, I felt like we had plenty of space and didn't feel cramped at all. Each dish was so tasty and nuanced that I could literally write a Yelp review of each. The nigiri, sashimi, miso cod, chawanmushi, strawberry mochi--everything was perfection. \n\nRecommendations: Full Chef Omakase, extra order of uni \n\nPros: Every dish, service, decor, relatively easy to get a reservation \n\nOkays: n/a\n\nCons: n/a", "author": "Perry H."}

BTW, we ordered the chef's omakase for $85/pp...such a steal in the city nowadays.  \n\nFirst things first, the sushi rice was excellent.  The fish was fresh.  We were told where each and every single one came from and they did have a large variety from tsujiki fish market in Japan.  \n\nWe were given a starter with a pre-made spoon of ankimo and amaebi served with a side of albacore with lemon mashed potatoes.  I was a little bummed to see the spoons come out of the fridge and immediately onto the plate.  I was hoping for that finesse that you receive from sushi chefs during any omakase meal.  Just little details...such as the mashed potatoes being violently scooped out of the container and onto the plate.  It just felt like Thanksgiving dinner instead of a semi high quality meal.  It also just drives me nuts when sushi chefs precut your nigiri pieces and let them sit in the fridge in front of you until you've reached that part of your meal.  \n\nOk, now that we've got the negatives out of the way...I had the best chawan mushi ever here at An.  It was delicious and packed with ingredients such as ikura, protein, and mushrooms.  Amazing.  The sesame kale was ok...a nice cold touch in between some of the warmer dishes.  The miso black cod was perfectly made and the flavors were spot on.  \n\nI enjoyed our nigiri pieces. They were mostly served without all the extra stuff that peeps put on them nowadays.  Just fish and sushi rice...which I appreciated.  We were also given a bowl of fish broth and a piece of homemade strawberry, red bean mochi.  Great way to end the meal.\n\nService was fantastic.  Our tea cups were refilled numerous times and our server was friendly.  The sushi chef was pretty quiet in the beginning but he ended up being a little more talkative towards the middle of our meal.  Getting a reservation was easy.  We called 30 minutes prior to opening and had no prob getting a seat at the sushi bar.  \n\n4 stars and super affordable for omakase.", "author": "Jen W."}

I felt like I could get the same at any other omakase restaurant in the city.\n\n[ Service ] Service was excellent! Our waitress came around to refill our hot tea cups every half hour and was super prompt at removing any unused dishes/trash. She was super nice and friendly. \n\n[ Value ] Even though the omakase is cheaper than most of the other places in SF, $80 can get you a way better deal at Sushi Hon, Hinata, Tsubasa, or Robin. I would definitely recommend checking out other spots for the same price point and comparing; $80 is still very expensive for a meal--remember that! \n\nTip: This place can be kind of difficult to find, but it's right next to the upstair's restrooms. There is no sign, just a door.

Would have been perfect with some sauce.  The sesame kale was yummy but standard.\n\nSashimi:  3.5 stars\nMaguro (not my favourite) and Tai (sea bream) was decent, but a bit dry so I didn't think it was very fresh.\n\nSquid Tomato Salad:  3 stars\nThe baby squid tasted a little stale, but went well with the fresh cherry tomatoes.\n\nChawan Mushi (Atsumono 1):  2.5 stars\nServed in a gorgeous artisan clay vessel, but the chawanmushi itself and its ingredients (scallop, mushrooms) were overcooked.  I've made pretty decent chawan mushi at home, so this is not acceptable.\n\nBlack Cod (Atsumono 2):  4.5 stars\nJust, yes.  When in doubt, I always order the black cod.  This one was grilled to perfection, just didn't come with the sweet sticky sauce.\n\nNigiri:  4.5 stars\n1.  Goldeneye Red Snapper (Kinmedai)  Loved this one.  Beautiful colour, with crispy red skin.\n2.  Arctic Char (Iwana).  Salmon-coloured tender deliciousness.  My partner's favourite\n3.  Filefish:  Whitefish topped with its own fried fatty liver.  Yum\n4.  Sardine:  Best sardine I've had in my life\n5.  Bluefin Tuna:  Really yummy, for tuna.  Fatty, tender, melt-in-mouth\n6.  Otoro:  Mmmm toro.\n7.  Hotategai:  Fantastic fresh and soft raw scallop, not tough or chewy\n\nSoup:  4 stars\nI love love love clear soups (aka broth).  So hard to get MSG-free ones in the US.  Fish broth with scrumptious fresh fat-stemmed mushrooms, an airy slice of tofu, sweet fishcake.\n\nDessert:  3.5 stars\nStrawberry sorbet.  Tasted freshly-homemade but I'm much more of an ice-cream person.\n\nVerdict:  4.5 stars\nSkip the cooked dishes but the nigiri is fabulous.

From your typical \"I'm in town let's meet and have dinner\" to \"Will you marry me I have a yacht, let's sail all over the world,\" and anything in between. Some did result in delightful encounters: one prior example was a man who interviewed me and wrote about my experience with Princess cake for a Swedish American magazine, and another, was a retire elite college professor, who goes to Japan on a regular interval but otherwise spends his time in San Francisco. He told me about An, after returning from Tokyo in November. Our correspondences since then have ranged from world travel to world cuisine, and of course in the back of my head I kept on trying to make my way to An. He said that it's as good as Shiro's, and any number of good restaurants in Japan.\n\nHe would be right. Three months since it opened, I finally snagged a reservation.\n\nI understand in 2016, a restaurant named Omakase was awarded a Michelin star in San Francisco. That seemed odd. It's like naming your daughter Meili, which in Chinese means Beautiful, wouldn't it be a bit too declasse and gauche? That said, in a good Japanese restaurant, you should go with the omakase menu, out of respect for the chef, and out of respect for your wallet. The talented chefs often assemble the best they know how, and you'd enjoy it in the sequence that you should be enjoying them at. And you get a good value for the money you are about to spend. Just like they do in Japan.\n\nSuch was the case at An. Get the nigiri omakase if you are into sushi, or for $5 more, get the omakase which gives you more than enough sample of a fine Japanese cuisine, from start to finish, it's the best $80 you'd ever spend.\n\nOn the nigiri omakase menu, you get to have the fried fish bones to go with the aji, so if you don't go for it, try to order it on the side, the fish bone, as my retired globe trotting professor told me, is not to be missed. On both omakase menus, you do get the starter that should immediately signal you that this is about a journey, a food journey that will leave you wanting for more: kale salad with sesame dressing, monk fish liver with sweet shrimp and jelly. Do take advantage of that palette cleanser before you are presented with a bowl of sashimi. Their varies selection of tuna, including toro, are of similar quality as Tsukiji Fish Market's sushi restaurant. No one who has eaten at that market would be disappointed by the quality that is served at An.\n\nThe show continues with steamed egg custard and then the parade of carefully assembled seven piece nigiri. If your neighbor is having the nigiri omakase, he/she will be on the 2nd round of their nigiri plate. \n\nGood rice to fish portion. Excellent quality of rice, not too soft not too firm and just perfect temperature. However, it's their fresh and REAL wasabi that kicked the food up a notch.\n\nFinished the meal with a clear broth fish soup and then sorbet. \n\nI wrote to the professor after, and told him that I thoroughly enjoyed his recommendation. We were speculating the comings and goings of the next possible Michelin star award in 2017. Wako, as it turned out, received a one star in 2016, before he had tried, but after I had dined there, when it just opened. He's afraid, that An would turn into another Wako. I'm not exactly that worried, I think time would tell. Plus, we are convinced its odd location may not attract the non devotees. it's not the Mission or Russian Hill, this is the ghetto burb, straddling between Laurel Heights and Western Addition, and just so ever so closely tied to Inner Richmond aka the Avenues. For food enthusiasts, we know a diamond in the rough when we see one, and for selfish reasons, we'd like it to stay that way. \n\nHe ends his communique by saying that he wishes that it never changes and no (Michelin) star would ever been assigned. I suspect the word is already out, and it may be a tad too late for that. But, if and when that day does come, we could at least say, \"we've been there from the beginning.\"", "author": "Victoria E."}

That's when one of my friends took the initiative and made reservations for the two of us and we went to dinner to enjoy the highly discussed omakase options that start at $50.  I'm inherently skeptical of reasonably priced sushi, especially in San Francisco, but was willing to go out on a leap of faith that An was as good as everyone said it was.  \n\nMy friend decided to go with the 12 piece nigiri Omakase option that was $75 and I went the more economical path of selecting the 7 piece nigiri Omakase option that came with kanpyo maki.  Both omakase options came with soup and an amuse bouche to start.  \n\nTo start off, this place is tiny.  So if you're a loud talker, someone who enjoys a lot of personal space, or coming with a large (5+) group, this place probably isn't for you.  An is definitely an intimate place, so be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors.\n\nEverything we had that night was incredible and the freshness of the fish was definitely the most noteworthy item.  My favorite was the katsuo nigiri I had that came topped with green onion and garlic.  At the end, we decided to blow it up big time by checking out the ala carte menu and got an order of ankimo and the Wagyu nigiri.  I prefer Kusakabe's Wagyu nigiri, but this was absolutely worth the $8 add-on.  I'm not a huge fan of ankimo, but the few bites I had were absolutely delicious.  The entire evening was great where we sat at the sushi bar, got to watch everything get assembled in front of us, and enjoyed hanging out with our chefs.  I will definitely be back here with my husband, the effort of trying to get a seat at An is absolutely worth it!", "author": "Lisa I."}

In this case, another amazing omakase for the books.\n\nShawn C. took me here for our Valentine's Day dinner. :') The struggle was deciding whether we were gonna do the Chef's Omakase at $80 per person, or the 12 Piece Nigiri Omakase at $75 per person. We ended up choosing the Chef's Omakase, since we wanted to try a variety of dishes and upon evaluating the nigiri per piece prices, they were pretty reasonably priced so we could always order more if our hearts desired. \n\nGood choice, because I really enjoyed everything we had! Highlights include:\n\n- Zensai was a baby kale salad and a spoonful of ankimo with amaebi topped with black truffle and ponzu jelly. This was DELICIOUSSSS. \n\n- Chawanmushi was our second warm dish, egg custard with shrimp, scallops and ikura. It was light, yet flavorful. Good news: you can order this by itself off the menu. \n\n- I may have found my new favorite fish, Iwana aka Artic Char. Buttery, melt in your mouth, amazing. \n\n- TORO. No need to say anything else. \n\n- We each ordered 3 additional nigiris after the 7 that were included in the Chef's Omakase: tamago, salmon and akamutsu (small grouper). HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting the akamutsu a-la-carte if it isn't apart of your nigiri omakase. Texture was fatty, buttery, perfect. \n\nWe dined at KUSAKABE recently, and agreed that An seems more traditional, simple, a back to basics type of place. The focus is really on the fish, since most were not pre-seasoned. It's slightly less pricier than KUSAKABE, and you have the option of not ordering any of the omakases and just ordering off their menu, if you wish. \n\nWe really enjoyed our dining experience with Minoru-san and hope to be back soon when it won't make our wallets cry. :)", "author": "Laverne N."}

See you never...\n\nThere's no question that Ino aka the Sushi Nazi made the BEST ankimo (foie gras of the sea)...ever. But dayaaaam, he was hella grumpy...like haven't been laid in 50 years \"grumpy\".  \n\nBefore it was publicly announced that Ino was closing, I wanted to pay him a farewell visit. I tried making reservations three times (he doesn't accept walk-ins) only to get yelled at: \"NOOOOOO, reservations!!!\" and the phone to get slammed at my face...by Ino himself (twice) and then by his wife.\n\nI hope they're now enjoying their retirement and having infinite amounts of happy endings. Lawd knows they need them endorphins!\n\nI was excited to learn that the owners of Koo would be talking over. Koo was one of my fav sushi restaurants in SF that I visited weekly for 3-4 years with an old ex. Man, I miss those Spoonfuls of Happiness! \n\nWhile Koo's new sister restaurant, An has their infamous Spoonfuls of Happiness on the menu, you won't find Godzilla or Dragon rolls here.  It's strictly edomae-style sushi with 3 omakase choices ($50, $75, $80) along and a la carte menu of nigiri, sashimi, and hot & cold dishes. Beer, wine, and sake only. $30 minimum at the sushi bar (this is very easy to do). Reservations highly recommend as (seating for 16).\n\nMy friend and I both ordered the Nigiri Omakase which comes with a zensai (appetizer), 12 pieces of nigiri and soup for $75: http://bit.ly/1PxRi6e.\n\nBefore your meal is served, you will receive an oshibori (hot wet towel) to clean your hands. This way you can eat the nigiri with your hands; my preferred method. I don't want to be THAT girl who drops her nigiri in the soy sauce, only for it to splatter all over herself and her dining companion's white dress shirt.\n\n*Zensai - Ankimo w/ black truffle & ponzu jelly & Go-mae: http://bit.ly/1MSbTTW\n*Kampachi Toro: http://bit.ly/1lg6XvS\n*Iwana: http://bit.ly/1MkkSHP\n*Kinmedai: http://bit.ly/1L6BctO\n*Kamasu: http://bit.ly/1M2cIGj\n*Shima Aji: http://bit.ly/20HeFzA\n*Saba: http://bit.ly/1MSc7KI\n*Akamatsu: http://bit.ly/1lg7yxu\n*Saba, kelp wrapped: http://bit.ly/1L6BpgO\n*Katsuo: http://bit.ly/1kkSRJt\n*Hotategai: http://bit.ly/1PxR8vx\n*Otoro: http://bit.ly/1HCMZ2R\n*Uni w/ ika: http://bit.ly/1Nn0d5K\n*Matsutake Mushroom & Tofu Soup: http://bit.ly/1SDBWgh\n\nFrom start to finish, while every course was solid, I definitely favored the nigiri over the cold and hot dish courses. I loved that the red vinegar flavored shari was bite-sized so you can easily enjoy the nigiri with one mouthful. The shari was very lightly seasoned and held together well. All the fish and seafood selections were undoubtedly fresh with the favs being the kampachi toro, shima aji, saba, hotate, and otoro because of the silky fattiness. This is more of a preference but I would have preferred that Kiyoshi dress each nigiri with soy and his choice accoutrements as one can overdo it when dressing it with soy sauce themselves.  \n\nEven though I was stuffed, I couldn't resist ordered one piece of the Japanese A5 Wagyu Nigiri ($8/piece): http://bit.ly/1PxRhzg. It's lightly torched so some of the oils are released making it one bite filled with beefy butteryness. \n\nIf you've experienced Ino's manstrual banshee moods (he gave zero phucks and would publicly shame customers), rest assured you won't experience it here. The owner, Kiyoshi and his wife, Ayumi are incredibly welcoming, sweet, and attentive. Since they softly opened, we were the only customers at the sushi bar that night so everything was leisurely paced, but not slow. The omakase took about 70 minutes. \n\nThe ambiance and d\u00e9cor hasn't changed much from when it was Ino. It's a place to have an enjoyable and peaceful meal for 2-4 people max. Please save the ratchetness and sake bombs for elsewhere. \n\nBeware if you're parking on the street and don't leave anything visible in your car. My friend parked on Geary and the car in front had their windows smashed...at 6 pmish.\n\nThank you, Kiyoshi and Ayumi for a wonderful omakase experience. Maybe you can convince Ino to give you his ankimo recipe? =D", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It also happened to be the best deal on the menu (in my opinion). \n\nEverything we had ended up being great, even the things that we would never have ordered. The fist was all exceptionally fresh and clearly high quality. While the nigiri was definitely my favorite course (toro, golden snapper, scallops, to name a few highlights), the miso black cod was also a favorite. \n\nThe surprising dish was definitely the egg custard with lobster, salmon roe, mushrooms and fish broth.

But An still delivered in spades.\n\nWe were looking for an omakase under $100, with a traditional/intimate slant.  All the omakase in the city are either extremely expensive, at places geared toward fusion rolls, or painfully boring (let's face it, you don't want just standard maguro/hamachi/ebi/unagi if you're paying for omakase).  An delivered in spades.\n\nWe ordered the $80 PP nigiri omakase.  The fish was fresh, power outage be damned.  The price point reasonable (for sushi, people, for sushi!).  The selections impeccable...we had a phenomenal range of rare and excellent cuts.  Flying fish, barracuda, o-toro (YES!), clam, scallop, aji, hirame...all fantastic.  One nice touch is that they asked us if there was anything we didn't like, and my wife said that she did not like uni, even though her husband (me) loved it.  Instead of serving us both the same course, they served me the best uni I've had in years, and gave my wife a beautiful portion of fresh crab...they really listened and customized the experience for both of us.\n\nI also felt our chef was watching what we LOVED vs liked (because there wasn't a bad dish here) and catered our next round of fish to what resonated with us the best.\n\nIt was so worth the money.  So many interesting choices, so many choices that were on the higher range of the a-la-carte menu, never once did we get the feeling that we were getting anything other than the best fish of the day, specialized for us personally.\n\nWe had a carafe of sauvignon blanc, and on top of the fish, the omakase included a tasty ankimo spoon, pieces of fish (I forget which!) served with a dollop of mashed potato (which sounds awful but was a perfect flavor balance), sesame kale, and a fish broth soup to end.

We had some A5 wagyu and it was so buttery. A whole plate of ankimo is only $10! The tamago is made daily in house and you can really tell how much care goes into this. It's moist, slightly sweet without being overly eggy and has no air pockets.

Don't think this doesn't speak to his sushi skills though - his preparation of the sashimi and nigiri was excellent nonetheless.\n\nThey also have $50/75 nigiri omakases and several sashimi omakase options, if you only want the fish. But I highly advise you to get the whole experience!", "author": "Chris W."}

(That for a long time was my friend's favorite sushi restaurant in SF but in the end he stopped going because of bad experience with the chef's attitude and behavior.)\n\nWe went in and was greeted by a very pleasant (and cute) hostess. We found out from her after we were seated that today is the restaurant's Grand Opening. There was no banner or anything saying so. It's nice they chose to do it with little fanfare.\n\nThis restaurant is pretty much all about sushi. There are some warm appetizers but no cooked dishes.  The menu showed a large variety of nigiri choices, which price shown being per piece.  There's also omakase sashimi on the menu, which was my selection. I chose the 10 piece sashimi with five different types of fish. I liked it very much. Tonight's choice included blue fin tuna, a scallop selection. and three other kind of \"specialty\" fish (this is versus the ordinary, run-of-the-mill selections).  For $37 it would be something I'd definitely come back for. Also very good was the tempura shisamo appetizer both my friend and ordered. For $6 (I think it was) you get two pieces of the smelt and it comes with a bit of wasabi salt on the side.\n\nMy one disappointment (if it can be called that) was their hot sake only comes in the small 150-ml size for $8. Next time I'll likely go for the beer instead which had selections that were fairly priced on the menu.\n\nWe were not the first customer into the restaurant because there were parties already seated at the sushi bar. However, we became the first paying customers since we finished and paid our bill ahead of the others.\n\nWill definitely return and hope the good impression I got this first time continues. Also helps if the cute and nice hostess continues to be there. :)", "author": "H K."}

We became unsure of our spur of the moment choice, but entering the dining room was like stepping into a warm embrace; the husband and wife owners, Kiyoshi and Ayumi, have created a spare yet cozy, thoughtfully appointed space in which to partake of an expertly prepared Japanese meal. It was pure pleasure to meet them and experience their personalities and commitment as manifested in their hospitality and the richness, quality, and presentation of their dishes.\n\nAyumi made us completely at home while explaining her husband's omakase offerings. We both chose the Chef's Omakase and thoroughly enjoyed the journey on which he took us through warm and cold fish and shellfish dishes, a clear fish soup, and sweet desserts.

The chefs were very friendly and the food was impeccable. Our chef was friendly and informative and everything was prepared just right. We both had the Chef's Omakase ($80 per person) and enjoyed everything from the starter (ankimo and amaebi with a small salad on the side) to the dessert (homemade strawberry sorbet) by way of delicious nigiri, black cod in miso sauce, and soup). It hard to single out anything as being better than anything else but the file fish and Hokkaido scallop were truly outstanding!\n\nAlthough we didn't have any this time, they also have an excellent choice of sake - we will definitely try that only next trip! We wants to keep our palates clear for the food but next time we will ask for their recommendation as to a good sake to complement the food. \n\nThis will be our go-to place whenever we are in the City for a show at the Fillmore.

Sit at the bar and talk to him - he's been in the restaurant business his whole life and started wielding a knife at age 5. I didn't know much about him before walking into An but from what I've gathered after a quick Google search, he was one of the first sushi chefs in America and pretty much invented (at least popularized) Americanized sushi - rolls with mayonnaise etc.  Kiyoshi San is *not* serving Americanized sushi at An. He is serving exceptional omakase.  \n\nStandouts for us were the chawanmushi, Arctic char, Japanese grouper, Shima-Aji, the Uni...actually everything was great and unique.

The place wasn't packed until we left but there's also ten seats at tables and around 8 seats at the bar - very small restaurant. Also, looking for the place may be hard because they don't have a logo on the front door, but it is next to the restrooms in the japantown mall where daiso and Ichiban-Kan is. We got seated once we arrived and give warm towels to clean our hands. \n\nWe had the Spoonful of Happiness and the Chef's Omakase all around. The Spoonful of Happiness stood out to me because it was the first time I had it - you're given a sake shot with a spoon of uni and another with ankimo, amaebi, and truffle flavor! You're to drink half your shot and eat one of the spoons and another half after for the next spoon - I guess it acts as a palette cleanser in between the two spoons since each had such a rich and strong flavor. Personally liked the uni here because it didn't taste fishy and was super fresh! The ankimo was a little too thick, but the truffle flavor made me happy! \n\nWe then got started with the Chefs Omakase:\n- gomae spinach wrapped around cucumber and another ankimo spoon: spinach had a very tasty dressing that was light but delicious - the sesame on top added to the flavor perfectly.\n- bluefin tuna (from Spain) & snapper (from Thailand) sashimi: the bluefin and snapper were melt-in-your-mouth fresh with then fresh wasabi they provide you.\n- steamed egg with enoki, mushroom bits, shrimp & scallop: this was placed in the cutest container with a lid, once the kid was opened, the aroma of all the contents came together and smelled as yummy as it tasted! It had lots of surprise goodies inside like enoki, mushrooms, shrimp, and scallop that you don't see until you really dig in - yum! And watch out, it's super hot.\n- seabass: came grilled and crispy with bamboo - yummy as well!\n- vegetable dish: came with mini Brussels sprouts, tomatoes and squid pieces - this was a very sour & tart tasting dish - couldn't decide if I fully liked it but I did like the Brussels sprouts. The squid barely had flavor so it didn't bother me but the sauce or whatever they cooked these in had a different taste that stood out to me.\n- 7 nigiri pieces: didn't think they were very fresh which was the disappointment. Toro is usually my favorite to save for last but it was very sour tasting, which didn't taste food :( \n- soup: surprisingly not your usual miso soup, but it wasn't bad nor was it good. \n- sorbet: this was the dessert for the evening and it was a scoop of citrus sorbet - not usually a fan of sorbet so I didn't really like it. However, my friends did.\n\nWould rate this place as a 3.5 because it had its pros: service, tea refills were on point, aesthetics, and the first few dishes of our dinner. Cons were that the dishes went from yummy to not fresh as it progressed into the night. $158 per person between 3 people (since we treated birthday girl).

I trudged out of my hotel and ubered it over to Japan Town and when I exited the car, the evening greeted me with a blast of cold air. I clutched my lapel and tread onward to find the restaurant. This was no easy feat, not being from this city but also because An is tucked away in the East Plaza and even more, that the front door to the restaurant isn't that clearly marked and whose colors fade into the external wall surrounding it. \n\nHow allegorical that was as it is said that the best things in life are hard to find!! Once found, I entered the restaurant and was warmly greeted by the hostess and immediately seated. There are a total of 16 seats in the whole place, 6 at the bar and so one is the recipient of constant attention by the chefs and the server. And not in an obtrusive way but rather that quiet and space is given you as you wish. \n\nI was very hungry at ordered the Omakase full dinner, knowing that I probably would want more after that. The sak\u00e9 recommendation from the hostess was wonderful. Junmai daigingo very dry and clear in taste with a nose of flowers. Utterly unobtrusive and harmonious with respect to the food. I am used to drinking the sak\u00e9 separately from the sushi, i.e. Not using the sak\u00e9 to wash down the food but did this time, I guess because of the quality of the sak\u00e9. \n\nThe parade of sushi was terrific, each morsel placed in front of my face was quickly downed. There was just the right amount of rice beneath the cool fish. The chef had a thick accent and I had to strain to understand him but this was just as well as it helped with the ambiance and made the experience more authentic. \n\nOne message I caught from the chef was that one of the pieces of sushi had its own sauce and didnt need to be dipped in soy and then I realized that maybe I could better enjoy the food if I wasnt drowning each piece in soy and wasabi. And so I did that. \n\nWell the very next piece was Hokkaido scallops and my not using soy allowed me to taste the subtle flavors which were exceptional. \n\nI finished my Omakase dinner and then asked the chef to prepare whatever he wished. The best of what he then offered me was the salty Japanese eel. It was firm (not mushy as is often the case), with just the right amount of salt, and I would say very slightly crunchy but not more so that would detract from the dish. \n\nTomago completed the meal. So if you want an unpretentious meal that is excellent, well presented and well thought out and is carried out in a quiet simple, authentic atmosphere, An is your place. BTW, add an extra five minutes of the trip to the restaurant in the likely case that you might miss it on first pass!!", "author": "david n."}

The highlight of the meal was the first dish, which they call the \"spoonful of happiness.\" Prior to this, I had never had ankimo (monkfish liver) before and was wary to try it, but the spoon of ankimo drizzled with truffle oil and a little caviar on top. It was a perfectly briny but luxurious bite, with a side of delicious baby kale gomae. Next followed 12 pieces of nigiri served one at a time, each with a description from the chef of its type and origin. The fish was extremely fresh, but the ratio of fish to rice was a little off in my opinion. The meal was finished off with an earthy matsutake miso soup, leaving me perfectly full.  Although I was extremely satisfied with the meal, there was a little something extra that was missing and I would probably prefer other omakases in the city. Regardless, it's another great addition to the Japanese food scene!", "author": "Ashley T."}

I went for the 12 piece omakase plus a chawan mushi (one of the only cooked things on the menu) and of course a piece of tamago to cap it off.    All the fish was fantastic, kinmedai, kanpachi, uni, kamasu, katsuo, blue fin toro, hokkaido scallop are the ones I remember I ate for sure.  Also had the fresh fried smelt, which was like a salty squishy crispy delight.  The tamago was exceptional, the extra care that Kiyoshi and Minoru can put into the preparation really shows.  The sake list is also tops, had 2 delicious glasses of different dry sakes. I left very very sated, felt like I had eaten everything.  I went to Koo 100s of times and am looking forward to racking up just as many delicious experiences at An.", "author": "Asher Y."}

We had the 12 piece nigiri omakase, followed by uni and A5 Waygu. The meal was delicious and reasonably priced. Kusakabe is still the best sushi I've had in SF,  but with An being half as expensive I'll definitely be back here many times.", "author": "Cathy B."}

In fact I'm trying to make my cash flow more robust so I could eat at An every week or so. Turns out the culprits here have actually relocated from beloved Koo sushi in the Inner Sunset. Thankfully they kept the wooden zen-like interior mostly the same, minus some golf photos. An Japanese comes through with some marvelous albeit expensive dishes. The quality is superb and the service is MUCH more friendly than the predecessor. We opted for the pure nigiri omakase, without all the side dishes and hot food and added further nigiris including blue shrimp. Everything was artfully prepared and even with my heightened attention to detail. I was quite impressed with the ankimo amaebi in the spoon, spinach and sesame with the cucumber app, the konteki Daiginjo sake as well as the oze okarakuchi junmai sake. Pair with an Asahi dry, some green tea and you are set. (Please not ice water.) I can't wait for my bonus so I can come and devour this place again.", "author": "Brian J."}

Owner was formally with Sushi Koo.  \"An\" is a small operation located at one of the main buildings in Japan Town (where Daiso is located).  Much cheaper than other high-end Japanese joints in downtown SF such as the likes of Kusakabe.  Make sure you make a reservation.

Fish is fresh, some of them are imported from Japan. Chef is a nice guy, he is very responsive for your questions.\n\nThe sushi rice was below my expectations, maybe only for the night I visited. Sushi rice is not everything, but it's the center of a good sushi. If you happen to see this comment, please check your feeling on their rice.\n\nOverall, it is a restful & friendly place to sit and exhale all the pressures after a long weekdays!", "author": "Kaiqing Y."}

If I lived in San Francisco I likely would not post a review to help keep it a secret, but feel OK sharing since I only travel to San Francisco a few times a year.\n\nFirst I had the nigiri sushi which had 12 pieces of nigiri plus an incredible zensai and soup at the end.  Everything was very tasty and I even ordered an unagi at the end.\n\nThe second night I enjoyed the traditional omakase which did not disappoint.  The cooked dishes were very good, but if I had to choose I would pick the nigiri again.\n\nService was excellent - sitting at the sushi bar is a major advantage to watch the chef's prepare.\n\nHighly recommended!", "author": "David P."}

I would focus on the Japanese fish; they were better sourced.  had toro (spain), kanpachi (japan), hotategai (hokkaido), uni (hokkaido), unagi, tamago (nicely layered), special Akamutsu (grouper this was great), buri (wild yellowtail, should get this), also has miyazaki A5 wagyu torched, very nice.  the king crab handroll was good and the negi-toro was excellent, very fresh with lots of onion.  chawanmushi more seafood-based and saltier from roe, could use more egg custard.  place should do well.", "author": "Rob C."}
