On my first visit a few months ago, my friends and I were hounded by a couple of drunk bros the whole time we were there--which is a bummer, but not necessarily reflective of the bar, so I was willing to give Encore another try. \n\nI was just there again over the weekend, and this time the KJ got defensive and aggro about his rape-y tip jar sign. I said (nicely! friendly! scout's honor) I could help him think of some funnier ideas for a sign, and he said his rape jokes are the only reason he gets tips so I should sit down and not tell him how to do his job.\n\nWELP.

Oh, how I recall so many rambunctious, thrilling, and just plain FUN nights that ended in fun as hell singalongs at Encore. Man, those were the days.  However, after what my group of friends and I experienced this past weekend truly calls for my resignation as a patron.\n\nIt's no lie that the DJ plants members of his entourage to casually dance with regular patrons and to sporadically sing (usually VERY well) their hits. It has been no big deal in the past as they mind their own business and generally keep to themselves. \n\nLately, the hired entourage of \"extras\" has gotten completely out of control! Two male members of the DJ entourage would NOT leave our table of five. One at a time they took turns harassing, interrupting, and annoying us. They didn't encourage us to sing, didn't buy us drinks, and added absolutely no value to our experience. In fact, one guy wouldn't stop touching me even after I asked him not to. He didn't get the message after numerous requests for him to stop. I even got up and sat on the other side of the table. Still, he didn't leave! He admitted that he was paid to be at the bar, wasn't drinking, and was completely aware at how inappropriate his behavior was. After fifteen minutes of us ignoring him, the jerk finally left. He was replaced by another hired \"extra\"! Again, harassment and annoyance ensued. He didn't even finish or beers and got the hell out of there. \n\nMy group of friends have been longtime fans of Encore and it WAS one of my favorite places to take out-of-towners. NO MORE! \n\nEncore. Clean up your act. Hiring \"extras\" to harass loyal patrons is completely ridiculous.", "author": "Andrea H."}

Common sense guides the way, and I am here to help you flesh out the details. Let's take a look at those deets. Good news: all their etiquette and helpful tips are on their website: www.encorekaraokesf.com \n\nFirst off, I just want to let you know that YOU are wanted at a karaoke bar or club. That's right you are wanted. Your skills, your charm, your own personal vibe, it's great! \n\nWhen you purchase drinks, you contribute in a very modest way to keeping that particular bar running. I drank delicious non-alcoholic beverages by the most lovely, most fab, most helpful Stacey and their charming colleague whose name I did not obtain. And while some do require a cover charge, entry to Encore is free!\n\nThe rule is one drink minimum, so have a drink while waiting for songs. Heck, buy another one after that or ask for water and tip the bartender a couple of bucks. It can be alcoholic, or not. I had a cherry lemonade non alcoholic beverage that was very yummy and refreshing, made me sound smooth like Luther Vandross and Selena at the same time! Someone called out \"Beyonc\u00e9!\" at one point which is very generous of them, I'm not sure how that occured since the song was by Thelma Houston, tee hee. Thanks sweeties!\n\nAlso, the KJ makes money with your tips. \"Egads, you don't say!\" you say. Oh I do say. The KJ weaves their magic to make you look and sound spectacular with the right song version, the right key, the right lighting, the right sound balance. A dollar or two is due! It's not too much to ask for the value of making you feel like you have channeled Usher or Whitney Houston or Green Day or Lena Horne for 3.5 minutes. Great KJ'S by the way. We met marvelous Matty who was darned nice and a great facilitator for keeping this feeling like we were part of a show. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself to the evening Saturday KJ who also was really a nice person and just fantastic.\n\nOn the karaoke song request slip, please write: \n*your name\n*your song title\n*the numerical code from the songbook provided\n*if you want the song's key changed you can provide that info, too\n*use the songbooks for the codes instead of the website\n\nKnow that your bartenders, KJ, and bouncer work hard. Encore Karaoke Lounge in particular has a great sound system, super gobo's/lighting, and clean bright bathrooms that look like you're in a nice hotel bathroom! Shucks I felt like I stepped into Embassy Suites when I went to powder my nose. \n\nI see it from the biz point of view, having worked in retail for many moons as a wee babe. Taking control of a biz with inebriated folks is not easy. As a sober observer at many a karaoke stint, I can attest to witnessing drunk or even just buzzed people get mad for almost nothing when it's their own dang fault.\n\nAnd even if you are sober, you may forget to do something and the KJ will assertively tell you what needs to be done, because he knows you need clear simple instructions when you are in a loud place with lots going on. \n\nBy the way, one of us didn't know to write in the code but it was no big deal. He simply wrote the code, and guess what? He then sung songs because our friend was laid back and followed instructions with respect. He made it easy for them to do their jobs.\n\nThey have to make sure everyone follows general protocol so they are able to easily (key word: easily) keep everyone SAFE and HAPPY, so make it easy. If you follow their rules, know your limits, be friendly, introduce yourself to establish rapport and good communication, you'll be fine. And if you mess up somehow be friendly and say you're sorry, do the right thing. As in life my friends, as in life. \n\nWe sang, danced and networked for more singers to join our friendly happy crew. Join us next time!", "author": "Monique M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-04", "description": "All in all, this is a quality bar, that mostly is known for their karaoke. It's a fun spot, but unfortunately their bartenders seem to sing more songs than the customers, which is always a little strange. I get that bartenders should absolutely be having a fun and tipsy time, especially when you're doing karaoke, but the people getting paid to be there shouldn't be getting more stage time than the people paying to be there. Just my opinion.\n\nThe drinks are alright, well-mixed, but the signs are misleading. This bar is risking a false advertising suit, but at least it's small claims right? When they say any mix, they really don't mean any mix. There's a chance you'll be charged extra for a drink than what is advertised, and you'll be too tipsy to notice or care. To be frank I wouldn't have tipped if I hadn't noticed they charged extra for an advertised drink than posted. \n\nThe karaoke selection is better for older songs (80s-90s) but has a decent selection of more recent songs as well.\n\nIf they had done a few things differently this could've been a much better karaoke bar. The customers should be up there more than the bartenders though. I've been to plenty of karaoke bars where they realize this.", "author": "Mike P."}

But FURTHERMORE, this bar does not care about its patrons, please see below.\nNow....I don't think it's a bar's responsibility to watch after us. However, women or those who identify as women are the hardest group to get to go to a bar because we often feel creeped out or unsafe.\n\nI went to this bar on my vacation and ALONE. So just was willing to trust them. Bars in my city  (San Diego) have made sure to make their patrons feel safe.\n\nThis bar could care less.\n\nI arrived and met two new friends. They were quite nice. But they noticed a girl at the bar that night was highly intoxicated and being creepily poached by two guys, one of which kept trying to buy her drinks. Thinking it would be an easy solution, we alert the bartender, who says, \"if she can't drink, she can't be in my bar\". He was way more concerned about making money than making sure his bar was safe and fun. He has security kick her out and then they eventually beat the shit out of the guy who was trying to keep her from being taken advantage of. It. Was. horrifying!!!! I've never heard of a bartender just not giving a shit about a girl who is being taken advantage of in the bar. I felt disgusting and scared and worried and grossed out, none of which I want to feel on vacation  (...unless you're into that).\n\nThen, a group of zealous white people sang a song about nazis. Then the karaoke dj fucked up my song request. Then I sang and got the hell out of there. (It wasn't until this point that I realized the guy who was attempting to help the drunk girl got beat up by security.)\n\nI wish I could say it was misunderstanding but the guy helping was not drunk.

They handed me a scrap of paper with \"$7 well\" written repeatedly, so it was a not so fun guessing game trying to figure out how many drinks everyone bought. It would've been easy with an itemized receipt since we all ordered different drinks, but that must've been too much work for their service staff to handle.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-08-29", "description": "It is with a heavy heart to write this review. I have been referring friends & colleagues to Encore for 10+ years. I was excited to bring karaoke lovers to Encore this past Friday. We got there around 7 to start our night. As we were waiting for our names to be called we were jamming with all the karaoke patrons singing to their great song choices. The mood changed when a man got up and started to sing a ballad. It wasn't until we saw the actual words on the screen when we were looking at each other in disbelief. The song was titled Spring Time For Hitler. After the song ended, another man took the mic and said some words which we couldn't understand. But the attitude was clear. He was making light of this song. Whether he was trying to be funny or grand standing we were just confused. \n\nI tried to shake it off and move on because I didn't want to ruin the night by booing or yelling. But I wanted to vocalize the poor taste of that song. I spoke with the manager behind the bar. I was thinking to myself, why would any karaoke establishment allow someone to sing, which in our eyes/ears, was an anti-Semitic and socially racist song in a place that welcomes/invites all people of race, gender, sex orientation and lifestyle. The manager tells me the owner was here and he would tell him. To my surprise the manager approached the same guy who grabbed the mic praising the controversial song. That is the owner? WOW. The owner came up to the table and instead of calmly explaining why this song was okay to sing, he proceeded to really defend it. Telling us \"that the song was written by a Jew and it was supposed to be satirical. And if you can't understand theater I feel sorry for you... It was an inside thing. We were singing it because we were making fun of our friend, who wasn't here, because HE was the one that was racist\". Whaaat!?!?  I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I may have had a little bit of a sense of humor if there was an actual Jewish guy singing that song and killing it... but it was a blonde hair burly man singing it flat with no hint of humor behind it whatsoever. But regardless what inside joke the owner had with the 2 people at Encore that actual thought it was appropriate, it was still executed in very poor taste. Especially with everything that went down this past weekend, what message are you sending to a crowd of diverse Asians, Latinos, Caucasians, gay and straight individuals that live and work in San Francisco? Even as we tried to explain why were upset the owner pulled the \"well I'm gay and my boyfriend is Asian line\". What the heck does that have to with anything?? I am not a business owner. But if I heard that a group of my customers were offended by a song with lyrics of anti-Semitic and racial undertones, I would immediately try to see what I could to do to calm things down. \n\nBut that didn't happen. The owner became more combative and aggressive. So much that I threw my hands up and said we're leaving. You just lost business and we will write about it. As we proceeded to leave, the owner was still in our face trying to justify the song. The owner kept forcing his way to me as we were leaving. My friends were being the protective type and even other patrons were trying to calm things down. Just when I thought it was over and headed down the stairs, the manager jumped over the bar and physically assaulted a female friend of ours. I witnessed his hands on her throat and shoulders. As you can imagine this was the tipping point. A shoving matched ensued and i felt I was back in college (20 years ago). A moment of exchanges, the physical altercation ended and we all escaped this devastating experience. You would think by completely leaving the premises the harassment would have stopped. The owner was still relentless and even had some choice words to suck his you know what. Really!?? This is the owner of Encore. Wow. Our friend wanted to file charges for battery and cops were called. Because it was a case of a she said he said, our friend, shaken up and traumatized, didn't want to go through the process of the court system. We did insist the cops to make the manager come down and apologize. At least this would send a message that you should NEVER put your hands on a female. No matter how it went down, it is NEVER ok.  She now has bruises on her back. Great job guys. \n\nIt has taken me 4 days to process what happened that Friday night. I am more hurt than angry because what was once my Mecca of karaoke, in one night, the owner and manager had deleted/stained any wonderful moments and fun memories of Encore I cherished over the years. You lost a loyal customer forever. \n\nEncore is failing their customers.  If you are against inappropriate behavior, batterers and abusive owners, please stay away from Encore.", "author": "JA G."}

I much prefer public karaoke over private karaoke, however I feel like the DJ has some scheme that allows people to sing more frequently than others. I've probably been here about eight times total now, and the time between each visit keeps getting greater and greater and here's why...\n\nThe bar is fine. Its not great, not bad. That's fine. The karaoke is what brings people in, but there have been nights where I've waited hours and have effected put in multiple songs and haven't been called up for my songs. I was there recently, and despite being one of the first people to put in a request waited about two hours to do a song, and then waited nearly two more for another song.\n\nI love what this bar is and what it stands for.

So I requested to have a new song and be up next, at which point he said he wouldn't do that, and when my wife came up to complain and he told her to \"go fuck her self.\"  We promised to never come back. Two years later we went back, last night, and after three hours of waiting the DJ had played one of our 5 requests.  He continued saying it would be up soon for the the last hour we were there.  This while he was singing songs.  We got there at 9 when it was slow and saw people singing who had come after us, the same people over and over.  Clearly the DJs friends.  When my brother complained one of the DJs friends said \"Why don't you cry about it.\"\n\nSo, we arrived at 9, by midnight one person in our group of five had had their song played.

(He was sure to make this clear to me) If I could give zero stars, I would.\n\nI stopped by Encore for the first time ever to meet up with some friends on Friday, 8/14 - first and only stop of the night after a long day at work.\n\nI order two beers for myself and my friend, I give the bartender my credit card and I walk away. No issue. Come back to the bar and ask for a Widmer Bros Hefe. Bartender puts his hand up to his ear as if he couldn't hear me twice, so I speak louder and point to the beer behind the bar to make it easier since it was loud in the bar. The bartender takes offense to me speaking louder and rudely says, \"You don't have to yell at me\" and then stares me down... I'm completely confused by this point. Ok, I assume since I couldn't be heard, that the only logical thing to do was to speak louder and help point out what I was asking for. THEN, he proceeds to tell me, \"It's pronounced (heffA) instead of (heff). Last I checked, hefe was short for Hefeweizen, therefore should be pronounced (heff). My mistake if I've been pronouncing it wrong my entire life, but if he knew and heard exactly what I was asking for, was it worth hearing me but making it a point to let me know that I was pronouncing it incorrectly...? My friend pays for this round.\n\nI come back to the bar to order another round. I order something easier to pronounce since I'm clearly incapable of reading, bartender comes back with two beers, tells me the price. I tell him that it's under my tab and off he goes again. He tells me that on Friday's, Encore doesn't \"do\" tabs and that I'm going to have to pay in cash. I tell him that he took my credit card already with the first round and can he just put this round on my credit card that he already has. He tells me, no one took my card, makes sure that he let's me know that he's the owner, so he KNOWS that they don't take tabs on Friday. I open up my wallet and show him the empty slot where my card was and tell him, \"sir, someone took my card and has it behind the bar. Can you find it so that I can close out.\" He tells me he's going to look for it, proceeds to help 3 or 4 more people at the bar, doesn't look for it AT ALL (I'm staring at my credit card in a plastic cup behind the bar, mind you), comes back and says he doesn't have it. I point it out to him behind the bar, he picks it up, says, \"Oh, this is yours?\" to which I reply, \"yes, that's the card that you took\". \n\nHe looks at it, puts it on the counter and says that he was about to get rid of the card. What???? Since when do bars get rid of credit cards, let alone one from 30 minutes prior?? He then tells me that he called me, from stage, three times, and that and that no one came up and claimed it. I 100% disagree with this - who interrupts people singing (three times mind you) on a Friday night to announce a credit card is still at the bar? My group was standing front row on the floor waiting to be called up for a song, you mean to tell me I missed my own, birth given name, three times? I give him the benefit of the doubt and apologize for not hearing him call me. He again, stares me down and tells me again that he was close to throwing the credit card away. I again, apologize and tell him, sorry, I didn't hear you call me any of those times. Typically if a bar isn't going to keep your card, you're told before you walk away that they're giving it right back.\n\nMeanwhile, two wasted girls next to me order a vodka soda and a water, bill comes to $7. The girl hands him $4 in singles and attempts to walk away. Of course, he nicely calls her back and tells her that she didn't give him enough money, almost in a flirtatious manner. So apparently, if you're a cute girl trying to skip out not only on paying for your full tab, but also skimping on a tip, you're golden in this bar.\n\nI will NEVER step foot in this bar again. I have zero clue what I did to make this man so upset, but if mispronouncing a beer's name, not knowing that the bar has a weird \"no tabs on Fridays rule\" on my first time visiting and not \"hearing\" him call me on the microphone is enough to make him treat his customers like trash, I hope no one ever steps foot in here again either. Even with being treated like this, I tipped you appropriately on the beers that I purchased because I firmly don't believe in skimping on a service and product that I've received, no matter how terrible the service.\n\nMr. Owner, whatever it was had you so upset last Friday, I hope all is well for you and that this was just an anomaly - but...reading through the other reviews, this is not the first time you've been extremely rude to your customers. You've lost my, all of my friends' and whoever else I can tell business forever. I'll make sure I spread the word.

Hell no, it is apparent we will be well cared for, and Hazel reported that the drinks will be strong, so lets camp out. \n\nPeople started trickling in, the KJ started up his system, and deftly performed a few songs to warm everyone up.

This is the second time I've been here, and the bartender, a blonde gal, was very friendly both times. \nWe are sitting further away from the bar, and I have a Trader Joes sparking water bottle sitting in plain view on the table, because it did not fit in my backpack with my laptop and rain coat. A gray haired man that none of us had seen before walks up to our table and says \" You need to put that water bottle away NOW\". I was startled and asked why (I also had no idea who this person was).  He says Why?? Because it's against the rules, there are SIGNS, put it away NOW. \nOkay.... I comply, and feel very jolted by this person's harsh delivery. \nI go to buy another round of drinks, and ask our bartender, \"Who is this man, is he the manager or owner? He was just incredibly rude to me\". She looks over at him, keeps her head low and says \"He's not feeling well today I think\".\nIn an effort to try to mend what was a lingering gross feeling about how that short interaction went down, I walked over to his section of the bar and said \"Hi, I just wanted to apologize for having my water out, and this is only my second time to this bar and I like it, but your communication made me feel very unwelcome here.\"\nThis would have been a perfect opportunity for this man to say something along the lines of, Hey, sorry for how it came across, I'm the manager and I just have rules to follow and we cant have outside drinks for legal reasons.\n\nInstead, he laid into me... Can't you read the SIGNS everywhere, what if a COP walked in, \"I was perfectly nice\" (he claims he used manners when he asked me to put it away, my friend as my witness, he did no such thing). \n I said \"Your staff has been kind and welcoming, I didnt even know who you were when you walked up to the table, I've never seen you here before\" to which he gruffly says \"Yeah, well I've never seen YOU here before\". \n\nDude was straight up mean, for absolutely no reason, to a patron whose crime was having a water bottle on her table, and who went up to APOLOGIZE for it. \nI'm not saying he's wrong for having me put it away, I'm saying I'm shocked at how big of a jerk a person can be to stranger straight out the bat, and then continue to be one when given the opportunity to create a better interaction. \nTo the owner, sorry if you were having a bad day or not feeling well, but maybe take a second to re-evaluate how you communicate with others, because that level of negativity is so unnecessary.", "author": "Chelsea V."}

Some want private rooms and ability to drink with friends while others want to do their best American idol audition in front of drunk strangers. Encore is the definitive version of the latter for aspiring sf vocalists. The place is divey and dirty and smells kind of weird but you are okay with that because you are drunk and singing your butt off.\n\nEncore has the look and feel of a dive bar but with the amazing addition of karaoke on the side. It is located on California street near other bars of Polk and is perfect for a night of barhopping in the city. This is the place to grab a few friends and convince them against their will to give karaoke a shot. What better place to make a fool of yourself in front of others than in a place that is dark with about 20 people screaming their lungs out for you. If you pick the right song you can even get some people to come up and be backup singers or dancers for you. It's that kind of bar, people are having a good time and don't care if you are nervous or not you will be at least one person yelling for you. \n\nThe bartenders and staff are excellent and they are also great singers. They will take time from serving you heavy heavy heavy pours to go up a sing a couple songs before settling back behind the bar. The song choice is what you would expect with most of the classics available. It doesn't get to current with not much past 2012 or so but they do add songs to the menu as they go. Your favorites will be there though and that's all that matters. The sound system is great as you belt your way across the decades and the DJ is supportive and will get you on the list to sing with the proper liquid or monetary persuasion as it should be. \n\nBe forewarned there are a lot of Encore locals which can lead to a couple things. The queue to sing can be quite long so you may have to wait up to an hour to get to sing but hopefully you are in it for the long haul. Also some of them take themselves really seriously and are actually very good so don't be intimidated when someone gets up and does a perfect rendition of les miserables. They don't represent the entire crowd. \n\nEncore is just silly drunken singing fun in San Francisco. You feel like you have discovered a place that only you and your friends know about and that's the best part. No overcrowding like the mint and it's not as shut off as Pandora or L2. This is the place to go to get your friends up to sing in front of others while secretly recording them for blackmail from your seat.

I'm a fan of a good dive bar, I can look past a dirty carpet and questionable bathroom.  Most dive bars have an extremely charming staff that more than makes up for cosmetic flaws and funky smells.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE AT ENCORE.  I have literally never been treated so poorly by an establishment as a whole.  \nI think I was the first one of our group to pick out my song, I walk up to the booth and there is someone else waiting to turn in their pick.  Then someone else comes up after me.  As the current song is ending the \"KJ\" finally comes back to the booth from messing around behind the bar, you can tell he has a seriously bad attitude.  He stands there for a second not even wanting to take the slips from us, then he mutters something rude to me about there being a long wait.  Looking back on it now, he was probably waiting for a tip that he didn't deserve.  It is my understanding that most KJ's are paid to do their job, and in all honesty it is a job a monkey could do.  Encore needs a better trained monkey.\nSomeone in our group finally gets to sing, meanwhile it's going on over an hour since my request.  Right before last call, I finally get called up, but for a different song my friend and I put in well after my first request.  So, it's pretty obvious that he is picking songs based on how popular they are.  I have never been to a karaoke bar that filters their song requests, or that allows bribes.  This is ridiculous.\nOnce we realized this was a corrupt system we tried to pay off the KJ to get one song on that was extremely important to my friend, and he refused and told her to fuck off over the mic.  I didn't hear any of this happen, bc you can't hear anything he mumbles into the microphone (apparently he's too lazy to talk clearly, let alone do his job). My friend informs me we're leaving and why, and storms out.  I go to grab my husband to tell him what happened, and that it was time to go.  I still had a basically full drink so I decided to finally give the KJ the tip he actually deserved.  Unfortunately there wasn't any money in it, and he threw the drink at me as I walked away, I had cleared the stage by that point so I'm sure he also doused a handful of innocent bystanders.  I'm not justifying my drunken actions, but throwing a drink into a crowd of CUSTOMERS is totally unacceptable behavior for an employee.  At this point, my husband throws his beer at him, and he proceeds to follow us out with one of the bus boys to try to fight my husband.  The bouncers were more concerned with keeping me away from the fight, than breaking up the grossly unfair fight that was going on.  Fortunately the KJ's laziness resulted in nothing more than a ripped shirt in the scuffle, and we left.\nManagement did absolutely nothing, but apparently this happens more often then not.  They should probably pull their heads out of their butts and hire someone who isn't going to cost them business.", "author": "Nikki D."}

Went here for an after work shin dig. There were a few pluses: It's large. It's relatively empty on a weeknight. And since we had a party of about 14, they hooked us up with a free shot of some variety of liquors (reminded me of turning 21 and having a \"Kamikaze\"). Also, the bartender was pleasant enough - when I ordered an Irish Coffee, he happily brewed up a fresh pot. So props for that.\n\nNow to the bad: It's grungy, the food (free) that was set out was pretty craptacular, and the worst thing ever? The DJ. Prior to putting on the karaoke nightmare that was me singing Cameo's \"Word Up,\" homeboy got down on the 1s and 2s. Well, sort of. First off, I don't think he had actual vinyl. And second... I haven't seen this many train wrecks since Johnny Cash sang, \"The Wreck of the Old 97.\" Seriously, if you can't make the tracks meet up, drop em down and give them a break. \n\nAfter wreck # who could keep track, we kind of jokingly gave him a little, \"boo,\" from our booth.

It was everything my clean-freak self has ever feared: dirty, smelly, frightening denizens, and so grimy, not even the blessed state of complete inebriation could make you forget it.\n\nI tried to be a good sport, really. I sat down on a chair (after finding one that wasn't visibly stained). I took pains to turn the pages of the songbook with a napkin, because they were so sticky, it actually took effort to do so. I tried tipping the bitchy KJ to play my songs only to get an earful of attitude back (point of order: I am not the one, son; read previous reviews to see why). I got into the swing of things by volunteering to entertain my friends/co-workers by singing a song.\n\nAnd, then it happened.\n\nThe microphone touched my lips. THE MICROPHONE OF THIS FILTHY FILTHY PLACE TOUCHED MY LIPS!!! Vapors, auras, cling-clang sounds, vertigo... all happened at once. Rightfully horrified, I froze. My friends screamed out, \"Run to the bathroom and wash your lips!\" In shock, I did so... only to be slapped in the face by a smell so pungent, so unholy, the devil himself would have said, \"Damn, man! Have you heard of Febreeze?\" There's no way that bathroom could have been cleaned... ever. Pure, unadulterated STANK filled my nostrils as tears filled my eyes. But, I had to stay in there. I had to commit soap and water to my lips, lest the fungus of the unwashed find a new home in my sexy Angelina Jolie's.\n\nAfter a vigorous washing, I was still convinced I had a social disease. My lovely co-worker, Laura, bought me a vodka. I think she thought by drinking it, I would get drunk enough to forget my trauma. Seeing that the glass was pure potato-stuff, I decided to soak my lips in it, with the hopes that the grain would kill the space invaders who were attacking me.

(longest run-on sentence of my life)\n\nWell, I have. And you know what? It's what nightmares are made of. \n\nAfter my moment of recovery and a swift (necessary) drink order, I actually had a blast at Encore! And trust me, I had a rocky start as you can see. I'm sure that had more to do with the awesome group of people I was with rather than the actual bar itself. Honestly, the place was dead before we all walked in. Regardless, a great time was had, shame was set aside, and we rocked this joint!\n\nI'm not much of a singer myself, but I heard the line was about an hour long to get your song played. That stinks, but if you tip the DJ he'd bump your pick up a few slots! The bartender was as nice as could be, but the bar was cash only. Good thing I had some on me! My drink was made swiftly and with a heavy-handed pour. I was a tender of the bar in my past life, so I do appreciate a knock-me-on-my-ass cocktail. The cutest part? He had do-it-yourself receipts for your drink order, if needed. Ha!\n\nJust come to this place knowing that it's a dive bar, it's cash only and bringing your own fun is encouraged. If you're thinking Encore is going to be a great time with a bunch of tight-asses who don't enjoy liquid courage- you'll leave disturbed and bored.

Nominate a friend to sing a song and put $(XX) on it. Better yet, pool your money together to make the pot bigger. Pick the most hillarious song you can think of. If said friend decides not to sing it, he matches the pot; half if he changes the song.

So I know a thing or two about what's typical versus what's excellent.\n\nThis place was awful.\n\nLike a good bartender, a good KJ is personable and reads the mood of the customer and crowd, earning tips because he or she has made the night more fun. They tailor the lineup for both maximum fairness and entertainment--each according to their personal system, of course, and one KJ may stringently disagree with another KJ's system.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the location of Encore. It's a bar, it's tacky looking and feeling, it smells musty. The bartenders and the barback were great--friendly and funny and providing excellent service.  \n\nThe KJ the night I went (a tall heavyset man with little hair and a beard) was, however... He couldn't have looked more unhappy to be there. When I went to hand in my song choice he initially did not acknowledge me at all--to the point and for long enough that I was looking around to see if, maybe, there was a different place I was supposed to go, or a bowl I was supposed to drop it into...or something. Nope.\n\nThen, after a few hours, I find out that if you want to sing here, you have to tip. It's not atypical for a KJ to be willing to bump you up in line if you tip; though I've met a number who think it's repugnant behavior. However, that's not what we're talking about, not that night at Encore.\n\nSince the rest of my group had already had turns, although I wasn't in any hurry, I went to ask where I was on the list--figuring, sure, I'd have come up faster if I'd tipped, but surely I must be one the next few singers either way, since hours had passed--and the KJ pointed at a long one, saying, \"The bottom.\"\n\nI much prefer the system where you have to pay to request, because a tip is something you earn for providing better than usual service. Anything else is a bribe, and that's not how we do things in America--which probably sounds hyperbolic, but think about it. There are countries where bribery is typical and necessary to get anything accomplished. It's just not the culture in the US, and for many jobs it's either outright illegal or deeply unethical--you could get fired even over the appearance of it.\n\nNot just in law or big business, either. Imagine if you went to the bar and ordered a beer. The bartender looks at you and says, \"That's $5.\" It's a little weird that you'd have to pay before you get your beer, but...you pull out $5. He glances at it, but doesn't take it, and continues taking drink orders, bringing out drinks to several people. Eventually you ask, \"Um, when can I buy my beer?\" The bartender looks at you like you're a pest and replies, \"When you tip me.\" You'd be unpleasantly surprised by this behavior, wouldn't you?\n\nSo, well, I was surprised the KJ was so extreme with his intention to never have my turn come up. I asked, \"How is that even possible? I've been here for hours? Everyone who came in with me has sung?\" Then he turns on the \"charm\", becoming positively polysyllabic as he says, \"They probably paid to get ahead. If you pay, too, I'll see what I can do.\"\n\nYou can imagine that I was in no mood to pay. What had the KJ done to earn a tip? Paying him was no guarantee, either. What if I didn't tip as much as he wanted? Or someone else tipped him more after me?\n\nI was annoyed, but while I like singing at karaoke, it's not the reason I enjoy it. I had some friends there, and while it wasn't the best crowd I've seen at karaoke (on the best nights, in my opinion, everyone's happy and supportive and participates and strangers come to feel a little like friends) lots of people seemed to be having a good time, and it's nice to be around people having a good time.\n\nI go back, therefore, to the bar to enjoy others' enjoyment and chat with my friends and the bartenders. Another hour passes and the KJ walks by. When he sees me, he mimes shock. He says to me, extremely sarcastically, \"You're still here? Why? YOU'RE not singing.\"\n\nLet's think about this for a moment. I imagine the bar is the more profitable part of the establishment for the owners of Encore. The karaoke is a draw, but not a money maker. Their KJ fully expected his treatment of me to provoke me to leave--possibly with my friends--and had no issue with that at all.\n\nWhen it turned out he hadn't driven me off, and that I was still putting money in the pockets of the people who pay him (just not, directly, in HIS pockets) he had no qualms about taunting me to my face...right in front of his coworkers.\n\nI honestly can't imagine why Encore employs him. In addition to being a jerk who is willing to drive off their customers, he didn't give me the impression of being a good KJ in any way.", "author": "Reese H."}

Tipping is a social contract from which you benefit as a customer. If you can't afford to tip, drink at home. Don't forget your KJ! $1 or more per song is customary; just don't expect to be bumped up in the rotation for a big tip.\n\n2. Put in one song request at a time, even if one of them is a duet. It's confusing/annoying for KJ's when you put in multiple song requests. Wait until you sing to put in your next request. \n\n3. Remember that karaoke bars are not run as non profits. If you want to sing, buy at least two drinks, even if they are non alcoholic. Do not bring in your own booze.\n\n4. Never try to join in on a stranger's song without express permission.\n\n5.

We had some friends in town from Melbourne, Australia and they told us they wanted to Karaoke.  We had a couple of choices, but this place seemed like it would best fit our needs.  It was Friday night and we arrived around 10PM. We easily found a table to park ourselves and begin searching through the huge books with almost everything you could think of singing.  Everyone was so friendly there, within 20 minutes not only did we make new friends, they bought us drinks and we started singing together.  What I loved most about this place is that people chose the best karaoke songs, so the whole bar would erupt in song and dance.  Very rarely did people do the self-indulgent ballads that bore the crap out of you.  I really appreciate that, being a karaoke connoisseur.  The KJ was nice enough, you needed to tip to get your song played but hey it's SF and this place is expensive.  The bar prices were reasonable and the facilities clean.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this place for a night of karaoke!", "author": "Jen B."}

Do they have my f*cking song?\n\nThe good news that is that, for the most part, Encore is pretty good about managing your songs and/or your party (tip accordingly, however), and will most likely have your song as long as you're not looking for the hottest track to come out on the radio this month. The bad news is that if you're a diva, it'd probably serve you best to stay away.\n\nDecor in this place is pretty sparse, but its divey atmosphere lends it some charm that others places I've been to in the city just don't have. The regulars are all great characters and very rarely will you find those pretentious folks you'd expect to show up and make you hate karaoke. All of these people work 9-5 to feel like a rock star for five minutes, so the support everyone gets after songs is pretty amazing. With the stage as big as it is, don't be surprised if people start an impromptu dance crew behind you or decide to be your back-up singers. \n\nAnd if you're here on a Friday or Saturday night? Brace yourselves; bros and \"woo girls\" are coming. \n\nDrink-wise, the bar's pretty good with cheap drinks that aren't watered down, but it being cash-only might disappoint a few folks. However, the people behind the bar, especially folks like Matty and Kenny, are some of the coolest and nicest people to get you drunk on a weekend.\n\nOther quick-hits:\n\n(+): Great atmosphere, not intimidating in the slightest. Good for newcomers. Great selection of songs.\n\n(-): Place has its occasional seedy characters, so always make sure people are watching your bags.

Well they lived up to their name by doing it again.\n\nEncore is not a karaoke lounge, it is a little fiefdom ruled by amateur karaoke jocks. First, be upfront about tipping prior to singing being mandatory. That's cool. Once the KJ said a 50 dollar tip would get a name called immediately. This most recent time we were told that a 20 dollar tip would get a person's name called right away. I felt like we were being extorted. We didn't care about getting called first, just getting called sooner than the three hour wait that it took would have been enough. There were several people who sang over and over. New people were _rarely_ called up. New people were called hours later when the bar was clearing out.\n\nEncore is a nasty dive (the word \"dive\" is too good for this place) with grouchy door security, expensive beer and karaoke singing comes at a huge price.\n\nAvoid Encore and go over to Silver Cloud where karaoke singing is more democratic.

It was our first date and they took my karaoke virginity, I feel so dirty.\n\nIt probably had something to do with the booze or a karaoke version of a roofie, but for the first time I went up to the stage myself instead of just sitting back and listening. For the record, I probably picked the worst first song of all time as it was over six minutes long.... nothing like being hammered and feeling like you've been up there for 35 minutes. But I enjoy the 1979 Sugarhill Gang hit \"Rappers Delight\" so that's what I did. It wasn't the smoothest ride, but thanks to the crowd and the scene I really didn't care. Next time it's gonna be \"Pony\" by Ginuwine, just wait.\n\nThe bartender, bless his heart, was amazing. I was drinking Glenlivet like it was going out of style and my partner in crime for the eve was drinking Belve mixers. She too was a karaoke virgin yet somehow knocked \"Fever\" by Peggy Lee out of the park. Good times.\n\nBut back to the 'tender of the night. I go up for round two, and I hear him  say \"wanna do a shot\". \"What?\" I ask, because generally bartenders don't toss out random shots to non-regulars. He took my question to mean \"Of what?\" and said whatever I want. Pffff, whatever you want homie, if it's free I'm down. So tequila it is.\n\nIt comes time for round four and dejavu, \"wanna do a shot\" from the friendly gent behind the counter. No more questions from me, just a straight forward \"Of course\". \n\nI'm now deep in the world of scotch whiskey and free tequila shots when round five rears it's head. Somehow a Glenlevit on the rocks and a Belve mixer came to $8 total. Anyone who ever buys these two liquid delights knows that is a freakishly low total. In other words thank you bartender, you're my hero.\n\nWay too much fun, I can't wait to go back. Sure, Japantown will have some gems I'm sure, but the pairing of friendly regulars here in combination with the Jesus of bartenders leads me to believe I'll be flexing my new found rapping skills here more often.

I came on a not so busy night, and I can imagine this place is probably a fun place when crowded, and to be honest, it was fun even when not so crowded. That's not my reasoning for the poor review... fun is not what this place lacks.\n\nImmediately when walking into this place it smelled like crap. It took me about half an hour to get used to the old building smell. It smelled like a damp, dirty people cave. The place was dim inside, but not too dim to the point where I couldn't see the terrible carpeting, and dusty decor. Okay, it's a karaoke bar, I know. I wasn't expecting leather couches and shiny hardwood floors. But come on, Silver Cloud is even WAY cleaner than this place. And don't even get me started on the one bathroom they have in the back. Probably the most disgusting bathroom I have ever seen, I'm not even kidding.\n\nTo boot, the DJ was a huge a-hole. \"Remember to pay me,\" and \"Don't forget to tip your DJ\" were regular phrases heard from the microphone. How annoying. It takes you about a millisecond to press the play button. I understand tipping if you go up there a few times, but on a dead night I don't think it's necessary. My friend who was with me said that she went there once and because she didn't give the DJ enough money he wouldn't play her song. Excuse me, dude, they are tips. If you have a problem with your paycheck, speak to your boss, not us. And what was he expecting? A $10 bill? What a jerk-off.\n\nI'll come here if there are a group of friends meeting here, but somehow I highly doubt that will happen.\n\nA plus: they have an amazing song selection (way better than Silver Cloud).

We googled karaoke bars in SF (because I've been to The Mint & Silver Clouds way too many times).  We wanted fresh meat.  We not only had a great time, we said we'd be back.\n\nUpon entering and showing our IDs, I got hit on by a guy shooting pool.  My kinda night.  I ordered two drinks for my friend & I, we chose a semi discreet table and sat down.  We're both a tad shy so we waited to put in our two songs, and guess what?  WE HAD TO WAIT.  DUH.  I wish we didn't wait so long to put them in but at least we both got to sing.  Anyway, I particularly enjoyed getting hit on all night by a guy who was much younger than me (I think he's a regular).  I even got to sing a second song before the bar closed.  (I sang Gin & Juice ... what a crowd pleaser!)\n\nA few \"facts\" that I have read from other reviewers -- that I agree with, adding my opinion:\n1. It's a dive bar. (If you're looking for class, why are you coming to sing karaoke?!)\n2. The furniture looks like it's from the 70's.  (What exactly is your complaint?  Who really cares?  It's a dive!)\n3. You have to wait a long time to get called to sing.  (Put your song in when you arrive.  By the time your song comes up, you have enough liquid courage to belt it out.  Makes it more fun, doesn't it?)\n4. It's dirty (?).  (It's a karaoke dive bar in the TL.  What were you expecting?)\n5. The drinks are cheap.  (Agree.  Also, I don't remember it being hard to get a drink.  In fact, we were treated with respect.)\n\nSo, in summation, this was my first visit to Encore and I will return with friends for fun in a dive karaoke bar.\n\nTIP: Avoid \"Debbie Downer\" songs and sing something fun that gets the crowd on their feet.

Inside - I was met with an incredible rendition of All that Jazz by Jill K. Fong's great vocals with Wicked Games, Peter M with....Grace M with.....the list goes on......What?!!!!\r\n \r\nSeriosuly now. What?!!!!!! I'm used to talentless Karaoke. This was anything but. No slurred words. No off keys. No embarrassing mike twirling. It was a solid line-up of Karaoke experts. Poised rock stars. Shizzle!\r\n\r\n I 'd already bragged to friends that I was going to do some sober singing (after wasted Mint moments)-, and so nervously (still secretly dreaming of the Karaoke star thing) -I submitted Otis Redding's \"Dock of the Bay.\"\r\n\r\n As my song came closer and closer, and my throat hoarser and hoarser from all the sideline cheer-leading; I was tempted to pull an Ashlee Simpson and claim that I'd lost my voice. Instead I would seduce my 'adoring fans' with a couple of messed up jigs. But no true Karaoke-ers don't quit. They sing. And so I went up there (Peter M by my side (reluctantly :) )) and sang Redding on fast forward. I could see the words being lit up, and knew I was supposed to sing each yellow word - when orange, but my adrenalin kicked in. I became A red-headed Otis on Speed. Luckily some kind souls - resuced me on stage, slowed me down, and belted out the rest of the song beside me.\r\n\r\nWhen the embarrassment was finally over, I awkwardly left to greet my two nameless fans. A blond woman who I'd pumped up for her upcoming number and a larger bearded man who actually was far more impressed with my side-kicks. But - whatever. Even when you're nervous and make an idiot out of yourself - be proud.  Because each wrong note,  just further convinces the timid person sitting in the shadows, that YES there are far worse people out there. \r\n \r\n Buuuuuuuuut back to Encore. The moment I stepped inside I felt comfortable and at ease.  It's a large - yet cute space and the staff don't take themselves too seriously. That being said there were some slightly annoying hassles. First - they don't take credit cards and I reluctantly had to use their $2.00 charge ATM.  Secondly, you may be waiting awhile for your song to come up, and even when you ask the DJ when it might be on, he tells you a vague \"between 1 and 10 more songs.\" And thirdly - it is HOT AS BALLS inside! Bring on the fans!\r\n\r\n Despite these hassles and some minor instances of  under-staffing  (the poor DJ guy - bussing glasses back and forth) the staff did a great job of getting everyone their drinks, and did so with smiles.

But, I can't say the DJ was the friendliest guy (perhaps he forgot his Purell that night) but if you throw him a tip or two he'll find a way to get you on stage.

Encore is not my favorite karaoke bar in the city by far, but it will do if you're in that part of town. Much prefer Festa, Bow Bow, Silver Cloud, and am looking forward to trying more.\n\nOverall, divey atmosphere, decor and clientele. Drinks are kinda overpriced since they're a bit weak. Huge song selection, but it can take hours to get the chance to sing. Found the owner and bartender to be welcoming, and most of the patrons were friendly and supportive of those on stage. Bathrooms were pretty icky, though, and the whole place seemed grimy.\n\nA word of advice: remember that this is TenderNob adjacent, and WATCH YOUR PURSES. Mine was stolen from a chair beside me when I wasn't paying close attention, and the police told me it's not the first time it's happened there. I understand why--I've subsequently been back and saw tons of women leave their purses unattended when they go on stage or go to the DJ to put song requests in. After the hell I went through getting locks changed at my home, office and car, it makes me shudder. \n\nImmediately after my purse was stolen, I did a quick look around under chairs and in the bathrooms to see if someone maybe grabbed the wallet and ditched the purse with the rest of the contents (keys, makeup, etc.). A bouncer even helped me look. However, a second bouncer started yelling at me to \"Get the $%!# out\" because it was closing time, despite the fact that I was in the midst of talking with the owner and writing down my contact info in case they found anything. Left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Will only go back when others plan something here, but I'm never going to suggest it again.", "author": "Emma L."}

I didn't do karaoke as frequently then as I do now, but I when I did go out to sing, I really liked Encore. \n\nMy, how the mighty have fallen. I go to Encore probably only about once every two months these days. The bartenders are super nice, and I have to say I have never once had bad service at the bar. Also, the song selection is good.\n\nThat's where the compliments end, however. For one thing, the place appears really unclean, and I don't recall that being the case back in 2007. Between the sticky karaoke books, tables that never seem to be wiped down and downright disgusting bathrooms, it can feel a little icky there.\n\nAlso, the KJ's seem to have a haphazard way of creating rotations for the singers. Sometimes they will rotate new singers in, other times new singers have to wait behind everyone in the queue, no matter how many times the others have sung. Sometimes (and I have personally witnessed this) some new singers will be rotated into the rotation while others are made to wait. Believe me, I understand that KJ's, in general, try to be fair, and by no means is this an \"I had to wait too long for my song\" complaint. I don't mind waiting my turn at all, even if it takes a long time. But please, Encore KJ's, be consistent and treat all your customers the same. And yes, as other reviewers have said, you should be ready to tip your KJ. That really appears not to be appreciated but required at Encore. I believe some of the bartenders also work as KJ's, but they are way better behind the bar.\n\nCrowd control also is practically nonexistent at Encore. Even on nights when it's not really busy, you may have to deal with bad behavior by drunken jerks that the staff either cannot or chooses not to deal with.\n\nI keep going back every so often hoping things will improve at Encore, but over the course of the last year and half, nothing has changed for the better. I'm giving them three stars as an average of the five stars I would have given them in 2007 and the two I feel they should get now.", "author": "Missy C."}

I was just here as the first stop of the night, and the friends I was joining had been waiting a while at the bar already. I joined them to help order. After awhile a girl behind me asked if she could squeeze by to get a drink. I said sure! But mentioned I was hoping to order as well. She was surprised that we were still waiting.  It wasn't very busy.  I watched as everyone around me, and most after we arrived, were helped.  I checked my phone and 10 minutes had passed since I had been waiting at the bar. The girl who had squeezed in next to me was asked what she would like. While he was pouring for her,  I jumped in and said \"excuse me, I've been waiting for a while.\" The bartender looked at me, and said \"Be nice.\" I said sir, \"I'm not sure what you mean because I'm being polite but I wanted to let you know that I've been waiting longer than others being helped and it's strange.\" He just kept saying, \"be nice\" and walked away. He came back and said, \"I'm one of the owners\" as though I should apologize. My friends tried to help explain that we had been waiting quite awhile but he just ignored them as well. This may be the first time I felt that I was truly discriminated against.  The fact that he was one of the owners was even more disappointing. I've served at bars and restaurants and that's just not professional or how the service industry works. So we went somewhere else.

Not to mention, the books have not been updated in years.  \n\nThere are a few bartenders that are okay, but it seems as though when the bouncer moved to KJ, more douchebag bartenders were hired.  \n\nSpeaking of the bar, if you want a decent beer, expect to pay 6$ (bottled Sierra Nevada).  Nothing is on tap.  Well drinks are overpriced and weak.  \n\nBathroom is in horrible shape, even for a men's bathroom.  Floors are dirty and unkempt.  \n\nWatch your purse.  Shit gets stolen here all the time.\n\nBottom line:  take your business somewhere else.  I will never be coming back to Encore unless they get new management.  The Mint, even with its wait times, is now better than Encore(and at least it has draft beer).

If you're going to insist on karaoke, and your going to coerce your non-singing-in-public friends to go along, this is probably the place to do it. Especially if your friend loves dive bars. Encore is the love child of a dirty townie watering hole and a karaoke queen; yielding a stiff-drink, cheap-beer, matted-rug establishment with plenty of room to watch the show without having to be a part of it.\n\nThankfully, I am blessed with hilarious and talented coworkers who sang everything from \"Hey Mickey\" to \"Ice Ice Baby,\" entertaining our crew (who took over the entire bar) and the random strangers who, good sports they were, slipped in a song or two between all of our riotous and ridiculous performances. And by 'our' I of course mean 'my coworkers' because I don't sing karaoke. Really, it's better for everyone that way.\n\nSadly, I cannot say I won't be back.

It plays well to groups, and as such, that's pretty much exactly what you'll often encounter here, from the flock of regulars doing their level standards to the ambling pack of screechers wandering in from the street to belt out momentary lapses in reason. That can make for terrific people watching. \n\nKnow that it's cash only, that while you don't technically *have* to grease the KJ to get him to play something, he tends to inflate (or at least infer that he's inflating) wait times in favor of those who contribute, but in reality, wait times are often much shorter than the \"it's going to be an hour plus\" aside would lead you to believe. There are only a handful of books here, so get your mitts on one early for options. And singalongs seem to be the rule of the day. Typical crowd pleasers prevail, and I've seldom (but occasionally) witnessed a ringer. That said, fussing about some of this stuff is roughly akin to moaning about a two drink minimum at comedy clubs - we all know the culture when we walk in, and you can either opt into that or not. For my part, I love a bit of the joyful trainwreck that karaoke often brings, so I'm sure I'll be back.

It's kind of become routine at this point.\n\nAnd such was the case at Encore. It was a weeknight and my 30+ coworkers and I pretty much took over the space.

The KJ, I believe, has lost the will to live and is taking it out on the world.\n\nThe reality is if you want to sing you have to tip- which is an odd situation since you tip when you receive good service. But the KJ sits and surfs Facebook, looks up at you, and goes back to his Facebook until you can ask if you can please put a song in- then he grudgingly takes it. If you don't tip you don't sing. So you pay so you can sing, but the odd part is he still continues to be the biggest a-hole in the KJ scene (even beating The Mint). It's hard to tip someone for being a prick, but that's the scene here at Encore Karaoke Lounge.\n\nOther options:\nSunday- Pandora, 500 Club, Butter\nWednesday- El Rio\nThursday- Pandora\nFriday- Pissed Off Pete's \n\nThere are heaps of other nice spots to karaoke in SF where the KJ isn't a turd.", "author": "M F."}

The beers seemed pretty cheap, and there was this neat thing where the bartender made some crack about how we could have gotten a free drink if we'd said it was someone's birthday, so my friend blatantly lied (I think she used air quotes!) and said it was hers, and dangit if he didn't give her a free shot. That's service.\n\n2. This couple got up to sing \"Suddenly Seymour\" from Little Shop of Horrors, and they were wonderful. Just so good. Pretty much professional level. Normally I resent people who are too good at karaoke, because I'm small minded like that, but this just warmed the cockles of my small, bitter heart. They were SO GOOD. I may go again, just to see them.\n\n3. It didn't feel like SF in there. And I love SF, I do, but I felt like we were in Fresno or maybe the less-hip areas of Sacramento.

They have a HUGE book of songs to pick from and usually have a few new ones also. \nAnd - for the most part - the people that work there are super nice. One of the KJs even remembers my name when I come in and that makes me feel special. Encore has probably one of the friendliest bar owners I have met and it pains me to write a bad review because I know that he prides himself on how much people have a great time and he loves his bar.\n\nHOWEVER...\nLast night my friend and I were yelled at, talked down to and disrespected by the KJ to the point that I actually thought something was about to go down right in front of me.\n\nWe got to the bar at 1030...there were lots of regulars there and some sprinkling of other people in the bar...it seemed like the perfect night to practice some songs and get in a new one or two. The KJ told us the wait was 1 hour - mmm....okay... I mean, it was 1030...\nAnd sure enough...after one hour we were up! Woot! \n\nAfter we both sang our first song...we gave him another one --- standard procedure that they won't let you put in more than one song at a time...\nHe said it would be another hour....okay...doable. That would put us up and singin' around 1230.\n\nWhen I asked the KJ at 1:15 if we were going to be able to sing that night...he was not only rude, he was borderline hostile about my inquiry. I totally get that he probably gets asked a million times when people are going to get to go - but to get mad, blame me for not paying attention (I'm totally sober at this point and had been waiting patiently with my friend)...it's just not necessary. He told me that both my friend AND I were not going to get to sing because we missed our turn. Umm...wait...what? I didn't give him attitude, but you could feel it coming off of him when he declared he was going to do us a \"favor\" by letting us share a song. \nMeanwhile, all the regulars had gone before us more than once, people who had JUST walked in were blaring their little drunken vocal cords across the room and many others got more than one song in while we waited.\nHe took \"pity\" on me and put me on the list to sing in a few songs.\n\nMy friend also went up to him to talk to him about the mix up. Instead of just plainly telling her what he said to me...he got IN her face and grabbed her arm while he spoke to her. I was sitting wide eyes at our table. Ready to jump in...because it was clear he had crossed the line and broken her bubble. Like a lady, she walked away...what could you do when someone is that upset at a customer?\n\nWe were both livid, and to be honest a little scared (or I was) at this point. My song did come on...and my friend decided to film my last bit.\nWhile filming the KJ came up to her AGAIN!...and said, you're going to get to sing...she asked why he was yelling at her and he said she was rude and disrespectful. I have it all on video...she was sweet and kind to him...and he was jumping down her throat.\n\nI used to love this place but now I really am not sure. I know that the owner wouldn't have been okay with his attitude towards us...and I  know that the other people at the bar are good people...\nBut this guy is scary.

I'm like, WTH, I didn't order the drinks for everyone else!  after a few mins I get a space by the bar.  The bartender knows I'm with ed, and DELIBERATELY ignores me!  Passes over me TWICE.  Even calls out \"any simple orders?  The guy on ed's left said \"jack and coke\" and the bartender, shrugs at me, and then, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, makes the guy's drink without even asking if it was OK by me.  \n\nWhen he finally got back to me, I order my 4 drinks.  At least the guy let me taste the vodka before I bought the martini.  And he made it well (no ice in the glass), with the tiniest shaker I've ever seen.\n\nThe song selection was really good here, but perhaps us yelpers just overwhelmed the bar.  I got to sing Wicked Game, but didn't get to follow it up with any of the other 4 songs I put in... from 7:30 til almost closing, when I bugged the DJ and he finally put another of my songs in.  I know that Marie A tipped the guy $20, and still had to wait like over an hour for her song to come on, and even had to bug the guy til it did!  messed up!\n\nThe saving grace was my taiwanese brutha Paul behind the bar.  He got ice in my martini, but he was the nicest dude, and poured a few jack daniels shots with whoever I was at the bar with :).  chinese style--no wussy shots.  If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have gotten my second song I don't think.  Paul is awesome!\n\nSo final tally.  first bartender/manager 1.5 stars (at least he let me try the vodka first), DJ 1.5 stars (it was a busy night, so I cut him SOME slack), Paul 4 stars.  Average:  3 stars.\n\nI might come back later, when it's a little slower.", "author": "Fong L."}

When ya gonna pony up with the half stars?)\n\nHere's why they gain two and a half stars:\nThe past three times I've been to Encore I've had a great time.  Lemme run them down for you:\n\n1. May 2007 with my brother and sissy-in-law... we were trashed, but headed over there anyhow because I heard that a particular group of friends would be there.  (More like Drue said: \"You better come to dive bar and sing 'Sister Christian' with me!)  So we did... \n\nBeers?  $11  Cab home? $20 Memories made by singing Madonna's \"Like a Prayer\" with your baby brother and sissy-in-law?  Priceless.\n\n2. After the Elite event at Otis.  They had free Finlandia vodka (!!!!) and ice cubes that light up and free t-shirts.  Plus, Drue and I got a standing ovation for 'Sister Christian.'\n\n3. Last night - I did what our lovely mistress Jessica T calls \"Sober Karaoke.\"  Why?  Because, even though I'm on the wagon I had to go celebrate my Dreamgirl Yelper's birthday by taking her a mix cd (I'm poor) and listening to her hawt-azz rock the mike out with some amazing vocal stylings.  In fact, a lot of peeps had amazing vocal stylings last night... Ed (who practiced a song for Gracie,) Berna, Molly  R. & Chris K., Joshua/Mascarawand, Faithy, Eric... Mebee I could appreciate it more because I wasn't slumped in a corner drooling on myself.\n\nThere were also a lot of amazing people who I haven't had much chance to catch up with since coming home out last night.  (Both Gabey-babies, Euge, Jeff, Beez, JT, Beau, Ted, etc.)  It made my heart smile to see them.  Plus, I finally got to meet Lulu and Rye G!  Yay, two of my favorite online people in real life!!!  :)\n\nSober Karaoke has it's advantages - you can leave when you're tired of it with very little effort - AND, you don't have a sore throat and hangover the next morning.\n\nPlus, chair dancing and singing along was fun.\n\nWhy encore loses a star and a half from me:\n1. Remember in my old review when I said drinks are HELLA expensive (I believe the bartender charged me $12 for a Kettle One and cran...)  Yeah, well they are STILL hella expensive.  Ask me how much a bottle of water cost.  Go ahead, ask me.\n\nOkay, I'll tell you:\n\n$2.50\n\nWTF?  I coulda had a beer or well drink elsewhere for that amount of money!!!

We were in the process of separating but had friends in town, and decided to make nice for the evening. The veneer of being a happily married couple came crashing down in the presence of alcohol and songs. \n\nMy ex decided to verbalize our drama in interpretive song. Each performance was preceded by a sarcastic dedication to me, which culminated in a nearly forced duet of \"Don't You Want Me?\"  It was so uncomfortable that two of my friends have been permanently scarred from karaoke. Looking back, I understand it was his way of working out his anger toward me in the way that he could. \n\nAfter a year's reprieve, I decided to give Encore another chance. How time, a beautiful birthday girl and new Yelp friends (some of which have quickly become an extended family to me), can make all the difference in the world. \n\nJoy and Gracie knocked me out with their vocal abilities. Who knew that such robust voices emanated from these tiny women? And Eric W rocked the house with \"Epic.\" Christopher K and Molly's duet brought tears to my eyes. Ed to the M, I live in a sea of regret for missing you rock Christina Aguilera to new heights.

I come to find out it was a gay karaoke bar, I immediately started kicking myself for being such a wuss and not discovering it sooner. There was almost never anyone there and the patrons and owners were always so nice. Less than a year later it was sold and became the current incarnation of Encore Karaoke. \n\n   The owner is fantastic, kind, funny and a great singer. He drinks Bushmills like it was mothers milk, or boys milk as the case may be. The thing about Encore is that it is the friendliest karaoke lounge in the city. NO Karaoke Gastapo like at the Mint, Actually efficient staff unlike Silver Clouds. The Encore consists of one large room, bar on your left, stools, and a single row of tables. To your right, raised up about 18\" from the main floor  has another half dozen tables and a pool table. The ceiling height is low, and the place desperately needs a makeover, but that won't happen any time soon. There are two tiny bathrooms, also in desperate need of a makeover. The stage area is huge, and it is level with the rest of the bar floor. The equipment could use some updating, but their song list is undoubtedly the largest selection in the city. I know I have donated more than a couple songs from my own library. \n\n   Sunday through Wednesday is the time to go. You will get a nice mix of regulars and fun goers of widely varying types and walks. Thursday- Saturday it gets overrun with the Marina scum oozing and sliming their way out of their moist landfilled perfume reeking lair. It gets WAY too crowded and is really NOT fun.

There's a small dance floor area where you sing, and there's a KJ who takes care of all the requests (can also carry a tune himself).

You get some rougher types from the East Bay, Trannys from the gulch, straight, gay, hot, not so hot. \n\nAnd once inside everyone seems to bond on the one common interest that brought us all together... to drink, sing, and make asses out of ourselves in public and be congratulated by our peers.

I stood there ignored for a few minutes reading the KJ rules, one being no more than one song in queue at anytime. I place my request, offer to buy the KJ a drink (he refuses) and go meet back with my friends and the waiting begins. I wait and I wait.... it was a busy night but not THAT busy.

I've had ups and downs, a few times leaving disappointed because of an overcrowded room or a few rare instances where my song request got lost in the shuffle. Thing is, everyone makes mistakes, and I also can't blame the venue for its location, right in the heart of all the bachelorette party and urban golf pub crawl activity. After the many years we've been spending together, Encore and I have reached a routine that works. I come at certain times of the week with friends (sorry, not saying when and sharing my strategy), knowing just when to get there to get a bunch of songs in and what signs to look for as my cue to leave. We take over the bar seat area, Robin pours us drinks with a smile, and Matty gets the songs going. (The only KJ I know with a particular appreciation for Yazoo's \"Only You,\" to the point that he even knows the Spanish version, \"S\u00f3lo en ti\".) And when those big crowds file in, and you find yourself getting frustrated because four tipsy guys and gals are spilling their drinks as they try to plod their way a rambling rendition of \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" just grin and bear it. It's worth it in the long haul. Because if you're one of the nice ones, the ones who actually tip not because you expect preferential treatment but because it's the right thing to do (unlike most people in those groups), the ones that don't swing the mic, the ones who say \"Please\" and \"Thank You\" and applaud for every singer, then you're one of us. And you'll both enjoy yourself more AND find that in the end all that matters is the singing and the drink and the company of like-minded karaoke weirdos like me.", "author": "Tanya F."}

I've been to several upscale karaoke parlors in Japan and everything here just seems to be almost like a Western gone bad.\n\nEncore Karaoke, formerly known as Tango Tango Karaoke, does give off a strange vibe.  It is quite obscure, right next to another Karaoke bar, my favorite tailor shop and some random flower shop.  You climb a flight of stairs and are immediately transported into a pool hall/dive bar type atmosphere.  It had me doing a double take, considering I'm an upscale kind of gal, but what a night! \n\nOur group brought the catered food and the staff made us feel like we were right at home.

It used to be a favorite hangout of my friends and I for years, back when it was run by the old owner. \n\nLately I've discovered an unpleasant trend whenever I go there. For my last birthday, we decided to finish the night at Encore (after a dinner in North Beach). My friends and I all bought drinks and then began to write down our song requests. One of my friends put down a request under my name (\"Busy B. and Friends\"), and I also requested a song under my own name as well. Throughout the night, only one song under my name was called, yet there were certain individuals who had 4 to 5 songs called up. They were the best singers, and there was clearly favoritism at work. And to add insult to injury, the freakin' bartender got up to sing 3 times. As a paying customer, who wants to sing and pays for drinks at your establishment, I really don't think your staff should have more stage time than paying customers. \n\nSo, don't go to Encore unless you have a very good singing voice because you're only gonna get one song the entire night.  Back in the old days, when the stone-faced Asian dude was running the songs, everyone had a fair chance (and it was possible to get more than one song under one request name). Sure there was a lot of off-key singing, but, hey that's the point of karaoke, ain't it? Also, back in the old days, the staff didn't monopolize the stage more than the customers. And the one time I did see an employee sing (out of the many times I'd been there), it was awesome (like watching your high school principal doing a tap dance -- oddly out of character and entertaining).", "author": "Busy B."}

It was a Thursday night and not crowded, but most of the seats were full. We went to the bar and sat down, and were promptly greeted and served by Tim, who we later found out to be the manager. Not only did he make it a point to engage us, but he introduced us to regulars among the stories he told.\n\nThe karaoke: Song selection was top notch. I've karaoke'd in some fairly high profile places (Vegas, Austin, etc), and the selection was the best I've seen. They have a rule where the KJ only takes one song at a time from a singer...I found this to be great, avoiding the classic situation where a regular sings multiple times before you get to sing once. \n\nThe drinks: Being from out of town, I was very pleased with the selection and prices. Very reasonable and tons of liquor to choose from.\n\nThe atmosphere: Amazing. I had great conversations with regulars, and really felt like I wasn't the new guy with his friends in the bar. There were all different kinds of people at the bar, making it an electric atmosphere and a ton of fun.\n\nThe staff: More than accommodating.

I have always loved the ambiance, song selection, and the bartenders. Until their staff/untrained bouncers started a bar brawl that royally f-ed up my friends.\n\nAs Max R. described in his own Yelp review (I'm just waiting for Yelp to delete or \"lose\" these reviews amongst other more positive ones) there was a misunderstanding with the bartender that could have easily been rectified with a calm conversation. I watched Max approach the bar and say, \"Sir, please...\" in trying to talk about what happened. The bartender cut him off and yelled at him to get out, which is when a bouncer approached and pushed him to the ground. Max, and our whole party of 15, was ready to leave at that point. A friend and I grabbed everyone's belongings from the table and started walking to the entrance, where 3 other staff members were blocking the door. I watched as 5 of my friends, in trying to leave, were pinned against the wall by staff's forearms, put in choke holds, and punched in the back of the head. This included 2 women that were not in any way involved (not that these women weren't strong enough to hold their own, but against 4 men? Really?) They yelled at our group to leave but blocked the exit!\n\nWhen we were finally able to pass through, the bouncers yelled inappropriate and unnecessary threats as we walked out. It was the most shocking and unnecessary violent situation I've seen in a bar. \n\nNow believe me when I tell you that I have been taking people here for the entirety of the time I've lived in SF, even building a relationship with the aforementioned bartender. I have no reason to slander Encore--some of my best memories in the city were at this bar. \n\nBut the way their staff acted that night was absolutely inexcusable--and over my friend inquiring about $20 he put on the bar? No one stole or was even accused of stealing anything, we were not disorderly (we're all workers in social service!) and were ready to leave when asked (or commanded to), although we shouldn't have been told to the first place.\n\nEncore, you really messed up.

I'm not necessarily opposed to karaoke but this place is so small that you can't really focus on anything else but the karaoke -- which is a bad thing if there's some screeching wretch on stage.\n\nWhen I ordered a bottled beer it came without a glass (there's no beer whatsoever on tap). I requested a glass and the bartender stared at me blankly for a few seconds before getting it. Then he just set it on the table and I had to pour the beer myself. Hey bro, for $4.75 you could at least pour it into a glass doncha think? Needless to say, I didn't give him a $1 tip for his sub-par performance.\n\nAverage place combined with enormous hassle of Nob Hill parking = 2 stars.

People who didnt know me heard my name. Im not hearing things. This happen for two songs. This guy makes a habit out of it. Its one thing to put names ahead for tips to an extent, its another thing to have the nerve to say the name coming up and then back out of it. Brutal. The crowd has ADD. I am here with my fiance and dont have any other support but i noticed that when people do , it makes no difference. Friends are supportive for the first minute then into their own world.

I was left with my friend from home who now believes the Canadian stereotype of the US as massively unsafe.  Screw you, inappropriate t-shirt wearers!\n\nTo top all of that off, the service both times I was there was extraordinarily slow as the bartenders only serve a tiny portion of the bar and there is a big barrier behind that area restricting flow.\n\nI will never go back here, as there has to be better karaoke places in town that DON'T spray you with water and get you into a fight.

However, there's nothing super fabulous about it: you go to drink and sing karaoke, not sit and enjoy the environment. My only complaint is that it does take a long time for your selections to get played (which can be a good thing, because you can use that time to get significantly drunk and gain the confidence to sing in front of a crowd). I've heard more than once that  the dj welcomes a payment to speed up playing your song - not very cool in my book.

Don't let the sketchy location keep you away -- this is one of the friendliest crowds I've seen in a karaoke bar, welcoming new people, and egging them on when they finally belt out that first chorus. The musical selection is impressive, including hefty sections for pop/rock (with a LOT of 80s), country and showtunes. There are a fair amount of karaoke professionals on the stage, but they do get excited about new blood, and some of the regulars are as bad as you would be. Drinks are cheap, the singing wait not too long, and people watching is priceless. A total blast!!!", "author": "Roman R."}

I was also relieved to see that this is not a bar that takes itself too seriously, and very few people singing appeared to do this on a regular basis. However, I felt like the KJ really put a damper on the mood, as he seemed to totally hate his job. He was surly, irritable, didn't seem to be interested in giving out information or helping out the singers, and if the equipment malfunctioned in some way, he just ignored it. I feel like the KJ really makes or breaks a karaoke bar, so my review rating is largely based on the angry dude with the computer.

He doesn't show any personality or interest in what he is doing, even though he does a good job with sound and organization.  It's not great and it's not terrible. If I was closer I would probably come here more often because there is karaoke here every day.", "author": "Destiny T."}

The wait times are atrocious and the song order seems haphazard.  We put in 4 song names in about a 20 minute period, and about two hours later they pulled our third one.  The other ones never came up though the weird bartender went up and sang twice, which seems inappropriate for the crowded evening.  Also pretty pricey for drinks and cash only.  And once u get inside it's not a hole in the wall where you think to yourself, \"oh what a quaint little place, I see why it's cash only...\" at this place u just feel even more screwed.  I would recommend looking for another Karaoke joint if you actually feel like singing.", "author": "John R."}

A group of us were there for a friends birthday just trying to have good time. The staff (including an apparent part owner) made this impossible and even took it to another level with, assaulting a couple of the guys in the group; even pinning a guy down on the ground and THEN stomping on his chest with his foot.  Bottom line is that there are much better karaoke bars in san francisco with staff who are friendly and accommodating. feel free to see for yourself, but i wouldn't waste your time,", "author": "Danny H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-12-13", "description": "I have never been escorted off of the stage by a bouncer for the sin of helping a friend sing \"Tiny Dancer\" before.  The KJ, \"Brent\", said that because I had a song coming up I could not be onstage.  This was at the same time as a bunch of people who had sung at least 4 times already were crowding my friend and singing along.  They were not escorted off. Why?  Because they had tipped \"Brent\" generously.  He said: \"I take care of people who take care of me.\"  I used to love this place, but it is corrupt and totally violates the spirit of Karaoke.  Do not go here.  This place sucks.", "author": "Ken F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-06-02", "description": "Best karaoke bar in town, bar none. (and for the record, I think I have been to them all!) The song selection is expansive, the drinks are strong, the crowd is out to have a good time and the KJ is better than most. I have had some of my best boozy nights here, I think.", "author": "carolyn m."}

Last night though, Jason was the Karaoke DJ, and I was incredibly disappointed when we he called me up to sing my song but promptly kicked me off the karaoke floor saying that I had been up there too much.  I had been back round dancing and supporting friends and others but I had not sung a song.  I am a tall guy so I am easy to notice, so in a lot of ways I felt discriminated against because I had been backround dancing.  If I was a female, I don't think I would have been kicked off the karaoke floor.  My friends (all of whom come and tip well on a regular basis) were PISSED OFF.  One by one, my friends came up and tried to level with Jason, but he was being a very rigid DJ and would not let me sing.  I had been up there dancing too much for him to let me sing.  Strange.  Lame.  Disappointing.  We will not be coming back on any night that Jason is in charge.", "author": "j. t."}
