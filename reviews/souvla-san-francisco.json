I honestly have to stop myself from grabbing something whenever I walk by, it's that good.\n\nFirstly, you must try the frozen Greek yogurt with olive oil and flaky sea salt.  The yogurt is thick and creamy, but doesn't leave you feeling heavy, as it's yogurt.  It's got a slight tang to it, but not as much as traditional frozen yogurt.  The olive oil and salt beautifully complement the frozen yogurt, and it's a fresh, delightful combination.  What I also appreciate is that they give you enough olive oil and sea salt so that every bite has a bit of each.  I've never tried any of their other flavors of frozen yogurt, but honestly I don't need to as this one is so good.\n\nThe rest of the menu is also delicious!  I always get either the chicken or pork salad.  They're really fresh, wonderfully flavored, and will leave you feeling very satiated because they're full of so many good mix-ins.  If you've got a bigger party, you can also order one of their full rotisserie chickens, which you see roasting at the back of the restaurant and are really juicy.\n\nEven though there's usually a line outside, it goes quickly.  I've never waited more than ~10 minutes to order, and the food usually comes out just as fast.  I've always gotten food to go, so I'm not sure how difficult it is to find seating, as the place isn't too large.  But there's a big plaza right down the block, so you shouldn't have too much of an issue finding a place nearby.  Definitely come to Souvla if you're in the area.  The food is so delicious and fresh and everything's reasonably priced.  Make sure to get the frozen Greek yogurt with olive oil and sea salt!", "author": "Kelsey P."}

Given your choice of protein, the diced meat is served on a bed of delicious kale lightly marinated in olive oil. The bowl is bursting with flavor, from the onions, feta cheese crumbles, and hearty cherry tomatoes. Sometimes, Mediterranean cuisine can be too oily, but Souvla's dishes are light and filling! The meat is actually cooked in front of you in an oven! I could tell that the owners went for the \"contemporary kitchen\" layout, featuring light wood shelving, minimalist d\u00e9cor, and small pots of plants. Overall, there is a clean, modern look to the restaurant, making it a trendy place to eat. \n\nUnfortunately, I would not recommend the iced tea. It comes in a bottle, tastes like artificial tea with preservatives, and is quite pricey. Along with that, the other drawback would be the small, cramped space that leads to competitive seating. It will definitely be tricky to fit a big group here... This is not a comfortable \"sit and dine\" restaurant, since there are basically only bar counter top seating and other high table seats on hard, metallic seats. Even though there are some benches in the park nearby to eat, I think the restaurant could make more efforts incentivizing people to take their time in the restaurant, socialize with friends, and have some drinks over good food. Also, there are not a lot of options on the menu, so Souvla would not be a stop for those cosmopolitan foodies searching for exquisite, complex food.", "author": "Louis Suo L."}

You are consistent and reliable - the constant in the sometimes hectic SF city life.  One of the remarkable places that sway me to say YES to haYES valley meet ups with friends on the weekend - when I'd rather be a couch potato and see what's new on uber eats. \n\nThings I like about Souvla -\n\n(1) Keeping things simple, and in doing so delivering high quality at no sacrifice to efficiency.  I like that the menu is simple.  \n\nFour proteins. Chicken. Lamb. Pork. Veg. \n\nTwo styles. Wrap or salad. \n\nAnd honestly, you can't go wrong with any combination. My favorites? Chicken salad and Veg wrap. \n\n(A) The Chicken Salad: Rarely do I eat salads, but love that this salad does not seem to be a salad, rather a more complex meal. It is not overly drenched in sauce, but a flavor burst of thoughtful ingredients - the herby fennel, with the citrus bust from naval orange, and the tartness of the pickled red onion, which complements the creamy feta cheese - all carefully tossed in \"granch\" dressing. \n\n(B) The Vegetable Wrap: I love the warm pita bread hugging the roasted white sweet potato like a comforting blanket around a most delicate angel skinned white potato baby, drizzled with garlic yogurt, sprinkled with the savory kalamanta olive, with the nutty aroma and crunch from the roasted walnut, on top which the pickled red onion, crisp pea shoots and mizithra cheese sit so delicately. \n\n(C) Juicy Potatoes and Greek Fries: I love the potato sides at Souvla, whether roasted or fried. It always compliments the main dish so well - and is fun to share. The juicy potatoes are so moist and tender - picking up the beautiful juices of the rotisserie drippings and oregano. The Greek fries are cooked to a perfect crisp, with every bite flavored with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley and mizithra cheese. Yum. \n\n(2) But my absolute favorite part? The creamy, rich Greek yogurt soft serve. \n\nI absolutely love the glorious Baklava Crumbles and honey syrup Greek yogurt. It is essentially a deconstructed warm, just out-of-the over baklava sitting on top creamy Greek soft serve yogurt that is rich and buttery to a fault. All drizzled in honey syrup to add that sticky honeyed element. It is hands down my favorite Greek frozen yogurt in the city. \n\nSouvla, I am souvlucky to have you in my life!", "author": "Vivienne K."}

They dress it really well and there are different meat options to choose from. The Chicken is probably my favorite out of the three, but the Pork and Lamb are also really good! They also have a Vegetarian option. \n\nAll the meats are spit-fired and go really nice with the dressings and toppings, but sometimes there are pieces of meat that are dry and over cooked. I don't always get the Greek Fries but they are a great side to share! I recommend getting one of the sauces with the fries, I like the Garlic Sauce. \n\nThe portion sizes here are great but if you have room after your salad or sandwich/wrap, they have great Frozen Greek Yogurt. I've had the one with Baklava Crumbles and Honey and it was really good, not too sweet with just the right amount of tartness!", "author": "Michael L."}

I wish the baklava crumbles had a higher nut to pastry ratio but it was still yummmmmyyyyy!\n\nAll in all, an interesting concept that is pretty well-executed.

I have not had a pita wrap with such a unique, fresh, flavorful chicken filling in it EVER. The citrus pairing with the oils and the chicken is a genius combo so props to the sous chef! The meat is SO moist. It's hard to do a chicken pita wrap well unless you douse it with some creamy sauce. There was a slight drizzle of a yogurt based sauce on the wrap but the natural flavors of all the ingredients in the wrap shone through. The side salad is simple and fresh and great if you're looking for a healthier option but honestly the wrap is a 10/10 health wise if you're not training to be a bikini model. \n\nThe place is worth the lunch line and the hype! Interior is super cute too--white and beach blue themed, just like Santorini. They even serve coffee in Greek cups. Authenticity with a modern twist, just to be adored.

I got here about 45 minutes before closing time and it was surprising still packed. The menu is super simple and opted for the chicken salad and the pork shoulder salad. Note: you can also get these options in a sandwich form too (it's a little cheaper, but the salad is a lot less messier to eat)\n\nBoth salads came out super quick. The chicken salad never disappoints me! The chicken is flavorful and juicy af and goes well with the rest of the salad ingredients. Favorite part is definitely the mandarin oranges! The pork shoulder salad was really good too, although I did find a pork a little on the dry side .. don't think I would get the pork shoulder salad again though. \n\nHighly recommend Souvla if you're in the area and want something light to eat.", "author": "Stacey Y."}

Roasted potatoes in chicken fat were luxurious and well cooked. The lamb souvlaki pita was just ok. Not much flavor, but it was fresh. Wished it was also a bit bigger with more meat.

Came here on a Sunday night with 3 friends at about 8:30pm and it was still poppin'! We were able to snag a table as people were leaving. The food came out fast (~10 minutes) despite there being so many people. \n\nI ordered the veggie salad bowl ($13) that came with sweet potato. In retrospect, I probably should have gotten a meat on it because it felt like it was missing something, but the sweet potato chunks were huge and super tasty. However, the olives on the salad were waaay too salty and overpowered the rest of it. I also wished they added more veggies or filling into the salad such as tomatoes and cucumber. \n\nMy friends all got wraps- one chicken, one pork, one lamb ($12 each). They all agreed that their meat was a bit dry, especially the lamb, but the sauce (yogurt based) helped to moisten it up. They said the pita was soft and the flavor of the sauce was not overwhelming. They put mandarin oranges in the chicken one, which was a great combo (maybe I'll try that one next time!).\n\nWe OF COURSE had to get the fro-yo after our meal. We got the baklava + honey, cretan wild flower honey, and by suggestion of the server- Greek Olive Oil + Sea Salt ($5 each). The baklava one was by far the best, the perfect amount of sweet paired with the sharp tangy-ness of the greek yogurt was perfect. I couldn't taste/see the honey syrup, but I didn't mind because the baklava was already sweet enough. I could honestly just eat the greek yogurt plain! The honey one was also good, but the Olive Oil and Sea Salt was the least favorite. Not sure how to explain it, but it tastes exactly how it sounds. There was just so much oil at the bottom of the cup and the overwhelming salt did not pair well with the greek yogurt for us. Love love love the greek yogurt, but would not recommend the olive oil +sea salt mix. \n\nI will definitely be back again!", "author": "April L."}

The chicken was also good with a different type of dressing, fennel, orange, red onion, pea shoots, and a mizithra cheese. Different flavors but both DELICIOUS. Both were wrapped in delicious pita.

They have runners but no servers. \n\nThey'll bring your food out to you but you'll figure out things like water on your own. \n\nWhich should make it great for delivery and I must go here at least a couple of times a week. \n\nThe food is always really fresh and high quality.

You can tell they put thought into the salad itself because it has such a great combo of ingredients including mandarin oranges, sprouts, crumbly cheese. You're not just tasting chicken and leafs. It's a whole flavor dance on your tongue. \nFries: Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Even cuts (aka no over-fried tiny pieces at the bottom of the cup) and didn't even need a dipping sauce. \nWildflower Honey Greek Froyo: If you like tangy and tart true-froyo like me, this is your jam. There are not many places that do true froyo with the yogurt taste anymore and I will come here just for this. The honey adds a touch of sweetness and doesn't distract too much from the tart flavor. \nBaklava Greek Froyo: Similar to the honey one but with added texture of the bakalva (which is like honey soaked granola) If you like your froyo with more texture, flavor, sweetness, this is your cup. \n\n~Price/Quality/Quantity~  \n$14 Chicken Salad: If you're going to get the salad with sides/desserts, definitely share or you won't have room after the salad! A good tasting and filing portion.\n$5 Fries: Don't let the small cup fool you, there are a lot of fries for one order.\n$5 Greek Froyo: Tasty and worth it. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nThere's not a lot of seating but the space is bright and airy. People tend to filter through the seating pretty quickly. If weather permits, I recommend sitting on the green right across street. The staff was amazing and very accommodating.

They top theirs with some olive oil, lemon juice, and cheese that makes for an extra salty and acidic punch that helps to make it an interesting french fry to snack on. \n\nRoasted White Sweet Potato - this is a great vegetarian dish that has all your classic Mediterranean flavors in a light, refreshing summer-y dish. \n\nThere was a little bit of a wait at this location, mainly because this location doesn't have much seating.

The gyro was great though. I loved that it had fresh sprouts and mandarin oranges in it. I ended up just opening it to eat it with a fork to avoid the heaviness of the pita bread. We also had the garlic fries which were great crispy fries. For dessert we had the Greek yogurt. The yogurt itself was great, but the toppings kinda messed it up. It had A LOT of sea salt on it. Like way too much. And it was topped with olive oil which seemed bizarre. When I first saw it I thought it was honey but nope.. olive oil . My friend and I basically didn't eat any of it soooo yah.

It was super filling, large, and not terribly priced ~$13-15. \n\nThe space, however, was tiny. On a warmer day, I would have opted to eat out in the park or at their standing tables outside but not when it's 40 degrees outside. Expectedly, the place was very crowded when I went and we had to pounce on the first available space after ordering. If you order a yogurt, you can pick it up later as long as you keep your receipt. (They are a pay and take a number type place). \n\nI also got the baklava greek yogurt ($5) and it was delicious. Unsure why the baklava was so jam-like; it felt mostly like hardened honey and was pretty sweet. The yogurt itself was smooth, sweet, and slightly sour which paired well with the drizzled honey (not as much with the baklava which was slightly overpowering).

Not the lightest salad, but it won't weigh you down too much. 3.75/5.\n\nAs an ice cream lover, many people had told me to check out the froyo here. It's light, with a brightness from the yogurt.

There weren't any four-tops available--not a problem as this happens at a lot of places in SF. The communal table had space so I had a seat. By the time our third person finished ordering a four-top opened up and she invited us to move. I grabbed our numbers first since they were the closest thing in my reach and put them on the new table. But then a female customer that was STILL IN LINE steps up to us and said that was her table when there was no evidence it had been saved. Not a purse. Not a coat. No number. NOTHING to indicate it had been taken and I already put our number stands down. \n\nWe didn't want to argue so we let it go and were going back to our spots at the communal table. It wasn't that big of a deal. Sure we were a little miffed that someone could act that way, but you have to pick your battles. Mind you, I've been to Souvla a dozen times and I get how their process works. Order first, sit after. Not everyone abides by that but I always do. That's the fair and right way to do things. \n\nBut then as we were moving back, the cashier (With a very distinct hairstyle. Not to name names.) purposely came over to the communal table to reprimand us in front of everyone at the restaurant. She antagonized us saying that if we were going to sit at the communal table we have to keep our numbers with us and we can't keep them at a separate table. She was completely did not even know the truth of the situation and judged us for what happened, then blasted us in front of all the other diners, especially the other diners at the communal table. Talk about awkward!!! I had to correct her and tell her that we were trying to move tables; it honestly wasn't even an issue as it was solved between us and the other customer.\n\nExcept now some small incident that should've been harmless between some diners has completely soured my experience at the establishment. I felt insulted and looked down upon by the employee and preemptively judged by our race and assuming we were trying to cause problems with the operation when it was sincerely not the case. She didn't even apologize for the miscommunication. During the rest of our meal I felt SO UNCOMFORTABLE around the other communal table diners and the atmosphere was incredibly uninviting. \n\nAt first I thought I was just sensitive to the situation, but talking to my friends afterward, they also felt the same uncomfortable hostility. I work at a 5-star hotel--I know when service is poor and this was it. I definitely regret spending $40 of my hard earned money there and I feel even more sorry to my friend who had never been to Souvla and was excited to try it on her first visit to SF because of my recommendation.

That was my biggest mistake and ended up not liking it. I enjoyed the baklava one because it's much sweeter and easy to eat.", "author": "Chi L."}

The food was fantastic, well presented, and came in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, the service left something to be desired. I heard that someone cancelled their order and a different staff member was swearing right in front of the register, which was a little uncomfortable. I'm not sure if that event effected the mood the cashier, but that's not my problem. The cashier didn't seem like she wanted to answer my questions about the menu, and I felt like I was rushed through the ordering process. I get that it's busy, but it's not like I'm ordering fast food and the amount that I'm paying is (or should have been) reflective of that. The cashier starts unnecessarily explaining to my friends and I that our numbers have to be at the table we're sitting at (even though we were all still standing and haven't settled down yet). Definitely felt like she was acting like we didn't understand simple seating or dining etiquette  (maybe because we're Asian), which is pretty insulting.

I had to see what all the hype was about and see if I too could find that much happiness in a salad. We ordered delivery on a weeknight. I went with the veggie salad- added white sweet potatoes-Greek style. Greek style is when they add French fries on top of your salad  because fries are the new healthy... salad was good but the potatoes and fries made it a little too potatoey and soggy. Mainly my fault for ordering but I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. Also tried out the honey baklava Greek yogurt. Strong flavor but still very good. Overall, I would suggest going to the restaurant to eat your food instead of delivery because it just isn't the same. Hopefully your Souvla experience will be more batheing-worthy than mine bath\n\nTake two: ordered Souvla again and this time I was well prepared for what to order. I went ahead and ordered the veggie salad again which comes with white sweet potatoes. Skipped the onions and olives, with dressing on the side. No Greek style either (fries on top). I added my own blueberries and avocado  + chia seeds. Top notch creation right there. Souvla is growing on me, but it's not quite bathe-worthy yet!", "author": "Kara N."}

The texture, flavor, and sweetness-level is much better than other froyo places (maybe because this is made with Greek yogurt?). They have a variety of toppings and I can't wait to try all of them. I got the sea salt and olive oil, which added a nice flavor to the yogurt. Be sure to spread out the sea salt though!

Anyways we visited a couple of times in the last few months. This last time was after a nearby concert. They're open till 10 on weekdays so it's nice to find someplace open late-ish. The line was out the door but moved quickly. Food came out pretty quickly too. I have tried the chicken wrap during the first visit as well as the lamb wrap this most recent time. I'm not a huge fan of the chicken - it was white meat and a little dry (guess me being Asian, I like the dark meat). I had a bit of my bf's lamb during the first visit and it was good so I got it the second time and the lamb was dry and not as flavorful as I remember. Disappointed again. My bf got the pork shoulder wrap and I liked the bite I had of that. Skeptical to go again bc what if it's a disappointment again. For sides, we have tried the potatoes (concept sounds good but I found out it super oily and gross with not as much flavor as I thought) and the fries. I remember the fries being really good during the first visit but this time they were just ok. Barely any cheese, no parsley and could not taste the olive oil or lemon. \nI really want to like this place but they have not been very consistent.

Tried it for the first time tonight and I already know it's going to become one of my go-to places. It reminds me of the Greek version of Spinnerie, also one of my go-to dinner spots. You order before seating yourself - there's plenty of seating that's first come, first serve. There's a large communal table as well as a lot of bar seating inside. There's both indoor and outdoor seating. Entrees will run you between $10-$14 and sides are $4-$6. Pricing depends on the meat you choose( lamb, pork, chicken, veg) and whether you choose a sandwich (gyro) or salad. \n\nI had the chicken kale salad, which was delicious. Fresh rotisserie style chicken, great mix of lacinato kale and greens, grated cheese, greek dressing and onions. Huge portions. I also ordered a lemon chicken rice soup which was delicious, but definitely not necessary given how large the salad was. \n\nLast but not least, they have an amazing Greek frozen yogurt with different toppings. I tried the cinnamon crumble today but will definitely be back to try the sour cherry!", "author": "Sally C."}

Souvla is a small shop in the city that has a small menu of pita wraps, salads, soups, and yogurt. They focus on a few items, and perfect them. \n\nThe minute you enter the restaurant, your immediate attention is the rotisserie chicken display in the back. Their chicken is roasted fresh each day continuously throughout the day. Their other meats aren't on display but I would assume it's just the same. I always go for the chicken wrap or salad which are both filling. The chicken salad is a dollar more but has more meat and lies on a big bed of kale salad. \n\nThe main attraction though has to be the baklava frozen yogurt. The yogurt comes with a huge amount of baklava on perfectly tart Greek yogurt ice cream. The mixture between the two is perfect with the overall dessert the perfect amount of sweetness. \n\nOverall, Souvla is an amazing place for lunch or dinner even though it's always so packed. \n\nTips - get your wraps and yogurt to go and seat in the benches in the park to eat.", "author": "Brian N."}

I got their frozen greek yogurt with baklava and it's probably one of my top favorite frozen treats I've had yet. The yogurt was more on the rich and creamy side with the perfect amount of sweetness and tartness. The baklava had a nice flaky and buttery texture to it. But what impressed me the most was the baklava's flavor. The combination of spices (it reminded me of cinnamon, cardamom and maybe nutmeg) that they used shocked my tastebuds and was an excellent addition to my frozen greek yogurt.\n\nThe place itself is pretty casual and gets packed real fast.

The restaurant is decorated clean with a modern Mediterranean feel.  It  has a pleasant atmosphere despite the tight seating. I thought I'd be wowed by the food but honestly it was just ok. The gyro sandwiches are wrapped in what seems to be a  home made thick pita bread . That sounds like it should be super good but the bread was too thick and had no flavor to it so it only added bulk and unfortunately added to the  dryness of the sandwich . We got one of each the chicken and the lamb sandwich . Both were super dry, begging for moisture which was not achieved from the scant sauce which was added in the middle of the gyro.  There just wasn't much flavor going on in the chicken gyro so I felt like I had to douse it with salt and pepper. They add orange slices to it which Also doesn't do much . The potatoes and the fries were excellent. It was a bummer we could not find any ketchup for the fries anywhere . There was only hot sauce on the tables which did not  complement anything .  The yogurt dessert was good but did not wow us. Overall it was just ok and pretty pricy -$58 for 2 sandwiches, 1 fry, 1 order potatoes, 2 yogurts, 1 ice tea and 1 bottled water .

Just get them; they will complete your meal.\nAnd of course we had to try the frozen Greek yogurt! I love baklava, so I could've used some more baklava in it, but that's just me being greedy. The yogurt itself was refreshing, tangy like your favorite 2% original Fage yogurt cup, and after having it, you will never wanna go back to that self-serve froyo again. \n\nSouvla is wonderful spot in beautiful Hayes Valley if you want a quick, quality bite!", "author": "M L."}

The vegetarian salad was really good! It comes with roasted sweet potato, garlic yogurt, chopped kalamata olives, toasted walnuts, pickled red onions, pea shoots, and mizithra cheese. The seasoning was fanastic as usual.. And if you're not a salad person, you can have it sandwich style.

They're tasty and have plenty of protein to fill you up. It's just unfortunate that it costs more to be healthy. The salads are $1 more than the wraps, although my friend said the salads have more protein than the wraps so maybe it's justified. Protein options are pork, chicken or lamb, or sweet potato for veggie.\n\n* CHICKEN SALAD ($14) - 4/5\n[\"granch\" dressing, fennel, navel orange, pickled red onion, pea shoots, mizithra cheese]\nDecently sized kale salad with a good portion of moist, pulled chicken. The orange and pickled red onion brightened up the salad, and the granch dressing was creamy and tangy but kind of heavy so I'm glad I got it on the side. \n\n* FRIES ($4) - 3.5/5\n[olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, mizithra cheese]\nEat these while they're fresh and warm! They're crisp on the outside, airy and moist on the inside. I would've liked more lemon juice and parsley though. It's disappointing that you have to pay an extra $1 for dipping sauce, but I suppose you can ask for you salad/wrap dressing on the side and use it for the fries as well.\n\nOverall Souvla serves a pretty good salad but I do feel like the place is overhyped. I probably wouldn't come back very often since $14 is pretty steep for a salad I felt like I could have made at home. I do want to try their popular frozen greek yogurt though.", "author": "Jessie L."}

This was a place I'd wanted to try for a long time and why not let that time be now?  Smart choice, as that line is where you place your order and I learned that it moves quickly.  \n\nSouvla's simple concept is killing it right now.  With 3 SF locations they're on the tip of becoming that thing that yelpers hate, a \"chain'\", but actually they're the type of chain I welcome.  I was quite happy with my salad made with free range chicken, pickled red onions, pea shoots, and more ($13), and their frozen Greek yogurt ($4-$5) with assorted intriguing toppings is a perfect inexpensive dessert.    \n\nThe concept here is straightforward, with chicken, lamb, pork, and vegetables being offered in (lavash) sandwich or salad format, all in the $10-$14 range.  The menu sources the origins of the proteins so you're not just staring down at \"pork\" but rather, \"American Homestead Pork Shoulder\".  It's the sort of virtuous menu which gives the impression you're getting fresh, responsibly sourced products.  The whole place, especially with the crowds it attracts, feels very \"now\".\n\nSouvla's formula is one that several other small, local chains are offering.  Though completely different, the price point and service model call to mind The Grove and Blue Barn Gourmet, both local small chain enterprises.  Of the 3, I liked Souvla the best as result of their style, their menu, and their food.  \n\nDid I like everything?  My dining partner ordered his salad with a protein of Superior Farms Lamb Leg which I tasted and didn't at all care for.  It took him until midway through his meal to reach the same conclusion.  Neither of us would again order the lamb.  \n\nSouvla is a vibrant hive of activity.  I'd happily return for another salad (this time off-menu \"Greek-style\" which translates into \"topped with fries\") and frozen Greek yogurt.", "author": "Tracey A."}

I never had fruit in my salad that I actually liked, but this was different. Orange slices paired with chicken created a nice acidity with some sweetness. The salad comprised of kale, pickles, and feta cheese (I think?). Seating was hard to find, so we ate at a nearby park. A little pricey for a salad though. \n\nThe second time I came with 5 other friends. My boyfriend and I tried the pork shoulder wrap and fries with garlic greek yogurt. The pork wrap was meh as it was wrapped in a really dry pita. Even the veggies and sauce couldn't make up for it :P\n\nThe fries on the other hand were marvelous but the star was that garlic dip! It was so rich and creamy it felt like I was heavy cream + sour cream. Dip your hot fries in it and you won't regret it ;) \n\nI sampled the baklava and honey frozen greek yogurt from friends and it was delicious as well!

Love the contrast of the tart froyo with the super sweet baklava and honey topping- the baklava is rather sweet on its own.  My friend and I shared this after our salads- it might be a bit much to each alone after a meal.\n\nFYI, being a smaller restaurant, most likely you will have to wait for a table and there will be times where you might have to share your table with someone else.

I can't tell you how many times I've walked by and seen people devouring such yummy looking salads, so I figured I'd give it another shot.

It was the perfect meal and I ate all of it.

For me, I know a food is either really good or really bad when I put it in my mouth and squeal. Thank goodness it was the former.

The salad size was reasonable with a variety of vegetables. The downside was the dressing. It was too greasy and unhealthy for us. We preferred that the dressing was not mixed and came aside the salad. The chicken was greasy too and didn't taste good. Overall, the food was not very special and still expensive.", "author": "Niousha V."}

I've been on multiple occassions - on a weekday for lunch, on a weekend for dinner, just dessert - through busy crowds and less busy times, and this place is consistently delicious and filling. \n\nThings I've tried before:\nMAINS:\n- Pork salad ($12) - The pork salad has your traditional greek flavors- the tomato, onion, and feta are rich and flavorful - making this a hearty salad guaranteed to fill you up. 5/5\n- Chicken salad ($13)- The chicken salad is a little bit lighter flavor wise- probably because the dressing and cheese are less intense and the citrus helps cut some of the richness- but still filling for sure! 5/5\n- Lamb salad- I don't even like lamb much, but I've tried it before, and the meat is good quality.\n\nHave yet to try a sandwich here, but heard that they are really delicious and filling.Portions are generous here, and they do not skimp on the meat- the $ you're paying is worth it. Getting it in a to-go box is a good move though salads can get kind of soggy after so don't wait too long to finish it later. \n\n--\nDESSERT: I LOVE THEIR FROYO (and it's so reasonably priced!) \n\nOlive oil +salt ($4) - I had it here the first time I came to Souvla, and it's hard for me to order anything else - it's my absolute favorite. It's a sort of savory sweetness- the salt actually brings out the natural sweetness of the oil and yogurt. 5/5 - would recommend you try it once even if you think it sounds weird. \n\nThe baklava one and sour cherry ones are good too - I actually didn't love the baklava as much as I thought I would - overpowers the yogurt itself a little bit in my opinion. Sour cherry is solid, but not super memorable compared to the Olive oil haha.\n\nAlso if you're getting froyo in addition to your dinner, you can ask them to make it on the spot after so your froyo doesn't melt while you are waiting around.", "author": "Kristie M."}

They do a few things and they do it well. \nYou can choose from pork, chicken, lamb, and veggies and have it as either a wrap or a salad. The salad usually costs a dollar more than the wrap.  My facorite is the chicken salad which comes on a huge bed of kale. It's surprising how large and filling the salad is, especially for the price. I would say the salad is tastier and a better value than what you would find at more salad-specific stores. The chicken wrap is good as well. It is more filling because of the pita, but also a bit greasy. \nThe fries here are AMAZING. Perfectly crunchy and seasoned and there are a lot of them too. For another dollar you can ask for a dipping sauce. Harissa mayo is very good. \nDrink-wise they have a large selection of beer, wine, and nonalcoholic drinks. I wanted something and the cashier told me that the cherry soda is quite sweet so I went with the Greek iced tea which came out of a bottle (they don't brew it themselves). It tasted like an herbal Arnold Palmer kinda. Not bad but nothing to write home about. \nThe only gripe I have about this place is how long the line can get on weekends, but I guess that's a testament to how good this place is.  All in all Silva has great food at a great value in a great location. What more can you ask for?", "author": "Amy X."}

They have a pretty simple menu with lamb, chicken or pork in a sandwich or salad form; they really focus on doing those things well.  Limited seating so hopefully luck is on your side, but at least there is a nearby park to eat at if you must take your food to go.  \n\nLamb Sandwich: In San Francisco, my biggest complaint about a lamb shawarma or gyro sandwich is that the meat isn't properly crisped then thinly sliced when it should be.  The lamb here unabashedly comes in tender chunks without any pretense of trying to be a shawarma/gyro and I'm perfectly fine with that.  It's super tender and bursting with flavor.  Plus the generously creamy harissa yogurt sauce just takes it to the next level.\n\nChicken Salad: I'm really not a salad fan, but this salad could change me.  For one, they let meat, creamy sauce and cheese dominate the salad with veggies just making a guest appearance.  And then the chicken itself is heavenly.  Salty, cheesy, juicy, tender.  And the portion is ginormous.\n\nGreek Fries: Thick cut and crispy all around.  Not as mind-blowing as the mains, but still solid.", "author": "Adam B."}

Both are excellent. I usually order chicken, largely because of the aesthetic window of rotisserie chickens spinning on the back wall (also because it is usually tender and delicious) but the pork and lamb options are also solid. You can't go wrong with any of the meats. I typically order salad so that I can feel healthy enough to follow it with frozen Greek yogurt. The baklava crumble & honey topping is a delightful conglomeration of textures and flavors. I would also recommend the olive oil and sea salt.\n\nBe prepared to wait, or plan to arrive a bit earlier or later than the standard lunch or dinner rush. You order at the cash register and they give you a number, which you can take to a table to wait (if you are lucky enough to find an empty one or stealthy enough to snag a seat as the previous patrons finish).

Doesn't that sound amazing? It tastes as good as it sounds! The lamb meat is made to perfection with tenderness & juiciness. Nothing about it was overwhelming and it was very flavorful. This itself is $13 which is a bit pricey but I felt like it definitely was worth it.

If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a quick dinner, then this is the place! \n\nI met a friend for dinner last night, and I arrived a bit early so I had a glass of ros\u00e8. Their house ros\u00e8 was good, not the best, but still good. It comes with a wine glass and a copper mug, and for about $10 a glass, you certainly get what you pay for in terms of quantity! I had about two full glasses with a single purchase, and it made waiting for my friend all the more bearable. \n\nThis restaurant is self-seating & self-ordering, so I waited in line and snagged a table outside as soon as I could. One of my qualms about this restaurant is that there aren't enough tables. I'd say the restaurant could seat about 40 people comfortably, and after that it would get very cramped. I was lucky enough to get a table when I did, otherwise I dunno what I would've done! \n\nWhen my friend came she and I took turns to stand in line and order, for fear of losing our table. She had the vegetarian salad and I had the pork sandwich with a side of fries that came with garlic yogurt. We dug into our food, and finished most of it. I wasn't too impressed with my sandwich. My friend said her salad was fine, but I think it's hard to judge a restaurants quality of food simply by their salads. The fries along with the garlic yogurt sauce were amazing! We both finished the order, and raved about it afterwards. The fries were slightly greasy and crunchy and hot, and paired with the sauce it was soooo good. \n\nTo sum up, if you're in the neighborhood give this place a try. It's alright, I've had better Greek food over at Bursa in West Portal-best sandwiches ever. However, this place is still good and has a nice vibe. Staff were very nice and accommodating, and the long lines were always nice to see. Takeout seems to be the better option here, as the majority of people I saw in the restaurant would come in and leave with their bags of food.

The salads are a bit on the pricey side, and it's usually around $14 for the chicken, but for the quality and quantity of salad, I find it's worth it. \n\nThe Mary's Free Range chicken salad is one of my top 3 salads in San Francisco (up there with the Plant Organic kale salad and the OMG Omega salad from Sweetgreen). It has their \"Granch\" dressing which is made with Greek yogurt, fennel. pickled red onion, and cheese over a mix of kale & romaine. The chicken is fresh rotisserie chicken so no cold, bland chicken here. The whole salad comes together wonderfully with a lot of textures and flavor and they are pretty generous with the chicken. I normally ask for dressing on the side since a lot of salads tend to be overdressed, but I don't normally find the salads here overdressed.\n\nThe frozen Green Yogurt froyo is also amazing - it's tangy and sweet at the same time and pairs perfect with the toppings. My favorite topping is the baklava crumble and honey syrup. It's worth the $4-5 splurge for this treat.\n\nThe lines around peak lunch and dinner hours can be quite long, and there isn't a ton of seating inside, so be prepared to wait and to also take your food outside to Patricia's Green to eat.

We went at noon so I was afraid of how busy it might get. Parking was a little difficult but that was already expected. It was a nice day so even if we had parked far it was a nice walk to the restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant was small but very warm and welcoming. We sat close to the front with a counter and open window frame. Next time, I'll try going to the back patio. \n\nCleanliness (5/5): The restaurant was busy but everything was clean and ready for customers. Nothing else to comment! \n\nConnection (5/5): I like the simplicity of the menu. Makes reading the menu and ordering very easy. We didn't know what to order because it all sounded good so the cashier helped us navigate the menu. Throughout the meal, employees did ask us if we were okay or if we needed anything. The atmosphere is very casual and the attentive of the employees was excellent. \n\nProduct/Service Provided (4/5): I ordered the \"American Homestyle Pork Shoulder\" as a salad (you can order you dish as a salad or sandwich). The dish was very good and balanced. I usually dislike feta cheese but I wanted to try the dish as is. I think it converted me to eat feta cheese - it wasn't overwhelming and the size and amount of cheese complemented the dish. The only note I would make is there were a couple chucks of pork fat (which I would've been fine with if it were crunchier). Some of the pork was also a little dry - so there was some inconsistency in the various pieces of pork.", "author": "Martin N."}

The frozen yogurt is tart and creamy and literally tastes like my favorite type of thick, creamy, Greek yogurt (think of brands like Fage, Siggi's, etc). The baklava oozed of cinnamon, pistachios, and honey and went perfectly with the slightly tart yogurt.

I was obsessed! I got into froyo toward the end of college and when I moved away I continued to get froyo a couple times a week. I had a seperate budget just for froyo. Ish was real....Then one day I realized that all the froyo (even the original tart) was not the same. It could never be as good as the greek froyo at Berry Berry. I stopped getting froyo and turned to boba to fill the void in my heart (read: stomach). \n\nAfter discovering Souvla I've found love again. Best Greek froyo hands-down! The froyo here blew my mind. I never though that olive oil would go well with sweets! And sea salt?? What's up with that? But, it was recommended, so I had to put my reluctance to the side. I tried the first spoon. AMAZING!! The olive oil was so fresh and the sea salt added a little munch that was much needed. Wowowowow, I will never leave froyo again. The void has now been filled!

Seeing those cups always remind me of New York City, and I can always use a place that serves good Mediterranean food!  \n\nI thought Souvla had some nice aspects to it.  The restaurant has a sleek ambience that works perfectly for a casual dining establishment.  In terms of ordering, you can decide between various protein or vegetarian choices in either a sandwich or salad form; I was torn between the chicken and lamb, but I finally decided on trying a chicken sandwich.\n\nTo their credit, the chicken was juicy, and I liked the contrast between the savory meat, pickeld red onion, and navel orange chunks.  However, the bread was tough, contradicting its seemingly fluffy appearance.  I also tried the greek fries, tempted by the combination of olive oil, lemon juice, and cheese, but I found it surprisingly bland given the stated ingredients.  While my meal may have lacked some spark, I thought the frozen greek yogurt was a wonderful way to end my dinner.  I tried the baklava topping, and while I don't think the texture captured that flaky, filo dough goodness, I enjoyed the combination of honey, nuts, and that chewy/sticky texture that you get with baklava.\n\nI'd probably go back again (at least for the greek yogurt), but this place turned out to be overpriced for what you end up getting.", "author": "Keith H."}

They have a vegetarian option too! \n\nWe ordered a chicken sandwich and a lamb salad, with a side of fries. Both proteins were great, but I LOVED the lamb. It was so tender and flavorful, and looking at the dripping meat in the rotisserie in the back of the restaurant, I can see why. I even liked the salad alone a lot more than I thought I would. It was well dressed with kale, romaine, fennel, pickled onions, and feta cheese, and it didn't taste plain or boring at all. The pita for the sandwich was soft and a good size, and the fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned.\n\nI ended up coming back a few days later to try the frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey, and my boyfriend and I both loved it! I was a little worried that it would be overwhelmingly sweet especially with the addition of the baklava and honey, but it was perfect.

Fortunately, the navel oranges were so sweet and juicy they really brought the chicken to life!

Towards the end of my sandwich, the chicken was sitting in its own juices and luckily made for flavorful last bites. \n\nI then turned to my friend, who had gotten the pork shoulder, and took a bite of his sandwich.

It's casual (order at the counter and find a seat), but the restaurant's decor is modern and the vibe friendly. The location can't be beat too. It's only a few blocks from the Ballet and Symphony, and close to bars, coffee shops, etc! \n\nThe DH (dear husband) and I both ordered the Pork Shoulder Sandwich ($11), and Greek Fries ($4) and the Souvla Side Salad ($5) to share. The pork sandwich had minted yogurt, pickled red onions, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and feta in it. The sandwich was okay (needed a little more spice for me), but it was very hearty. I almost wished I'd ordered the salad instead which costs a dollar more. It would have been a lighter dinner. Careful with that sandwich! The juices from the meat and dressing dripped and almost got on my outfit! \n\nI actually enjoyed the fries and salad more than the sandwich. Even though the fries were not as good as Opa Fries, they're nicely seasoned and they're not too thick. I loved the salad! Loved how refreshing it was. I would definitely order my choice of protein on a salad next time. The sandwich was too heavy for me! \n\nWe didn't order dessert as we had to leave and walk back to the WMOH. They do have Frozen Greek Yogurt that you can choose to top with baklava and other sweet toppings. \n\nSodas, Greek wine and beer complete their menu. We just went with water as I always grab a glass of wine at the Ballet before the performance. \n\nSouvla is a good option before the Ballet, Opera or Symphony if you're wanting something quick and affordable!", "author": "Hazel C."}

Anytime I'm in the area, we eat there because it's so good - if I lived closer, it would become a bad habit. The menu is simple, but there is no such thing as a bad order. \n\nMy favorite item on the menu by far would be the roasted white sweet potato salad. I don't know WHAT's in their dressing but it's super addicting. It's probably the most filling and satisfying salad you'll ever eat. Another great item is the lamb gyro; the meat is beautifully cooked and not super greasy. Greek fries are always a must no matter what entree you're ordering. Dessert is also a must: I highly recommend the frozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey syrup. The sweet and sour flavor profiles are out of this world. In terms of their beverage selection, I've only ever had their Greek beer and it goes really well with the food (it's a refreshing lager). \n\nEverything else about Souvla is a slam dunk: their marketing/branding is on point and memorable; the space is clean and simple; the giant wall of rotisserie chicken is a sight to see; and ordering is quick and easy (unless there's a huge line). The one downside when it's really busy is the seating. It's pretty much communal seating but it does get super tight in the space when all of the seats are occupied. Food comes out super fast and you pick up the dessert separately (once you've finished your meal) so that it doesn't melt. \n\nDefinitely a more casual, quick spot, but the food is high class all the way.", "author": "Regina L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-18", "description": "Yuppified Daphne's. \n \nDon't get me wrong, I enjoy yuppified food and have no problem paying a premium price, if justified.\n\nSouvla's marketing is on point with great buzz words on their menu (e.g. \"American Homestead Pork Shoulder\", \"Superior Farms Lamb Leg\", \"Harissa-Spiked Yogurt\", etc.) and hefty prices to match. If I'm going to pay 2x the price for a chicken gyro wrap, the chicken better be free-range and Mary, herself better be tending to them--am I right?\n\nLet's start with the good. I like that Souvla's menu is very simple. Choose a protein (pork, chicken, lamb, or veggie), then decide whether you want a wrap ($10-$13) or a salad ($11-$14). Make it a combo meal with sides ($4-$6): fries, potatoes, side salad, or soup. Have a sweet tooth? End your meal with Greek froyo ($4-$5). They also have wine and beer so you can get your drank on. \n\nOrder at the counter, get a number, and your food will be delivered to you. The space is tiny, loud, and you will have to hover for seats. Luckily, there's a quick turnover. My co-worker and I found seats in 2 minutes and received our food 2 minutes after. Great for people who are pressed for time.\n\nNow, the not so good. We paid $40 for one wrap, one salad, and one order of fries to share (including tax + tip). Expensive for a casual, \"fast food\" lunch with no waiter service. At these prices, I expected the food to be Greekgasmic.\n\nI appreciate Souvla's use of fresh, high-quality ingredients. Given how simple the menu is, it's unfortunate the food was less than mediocre. \n\nMy Superior Farms Leg Lamb Wrap ($13): https://bitly.com/a/bitlinks was superiorly dry and bland. I enjoyed the warm, thick, and fluffy pita bread but it was filled with flavorless, tough, and chewy cubes of lamb (texture of well done top round). The lamb was devoid of any spices. The yogurt sauce was concentrated at the opening end of the pita so I kept reaching for the bottle of hot sauce on our table to add flavor and moisture to the rest of the wrap. I ended up using half the bottle. \n\nMy co-worker said the chicken in the Mary's Organic Chicken Salad ($14) was dry and bland as well. This seems to be the common complaint among other yelpers with their proteins.\n\nI couldn't help but think one could buy nearly 3 whole rotisserie chicken from Costco for $14. Yikes, I sound like a cheap phuck but at least Costco's rotisserie chicken is well-seasoned and moist. \n\nThe saving grace were the side of Greek Fries ($4). They were piping hot, deliciously crunchy, and fluffy on the inside. The fries are supposed to be topped with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, mizithra cheese but we barely got a smidge of each. You have to pay an extra $1 for a tiny container of dipping sauce--what the heezy?!? If you're going to nickel and dime customers, just charge $5 and include the sauce. It's an inconvenience to later find out that ketchup is not available and have to stand in line again (and that line can get long) just to buy the dipping sauce.\n\nI doubt I would return to Souvla, nor would I recommend it to anyone looking for a legit Greek meal. It's overpriced and the flavors are dumbed down.\n\nMaybe Uncle Jesse will go into the restaurant biz in Fuller House: http://usm.ag/1Mkqe4I? Wouldn't mind a bite of his gyro.

With a line out the door and a small footprint, you gotta be fast.\n\n-Veg Sandwich (4/5): sweet potato is the star here, and I'd eat this any day. The garlic in the yogurt is the strongest flavor; the other ingredients (myzithra, walnuts, pickled onions, kalamata onions, pea shoots) are pretty subtle but together make for a satisfying entree.\n-Fries (3/5): the fries themselves are solid but the lemon is undetectable and the myzithra (which I love) nearly nonexistent. There's an herby flavor from the parsley. Nothing to write home about. Sadly the potato side is not vegetarian.\n-Soulva Greek Red Wine (2/5): I'm not a wine connoisseur but it was pretty disappointing. The 500ml mug makes for two very generous glasses.\n-Baklava Crumbles & Honey Greek Froyo (5/5): THIS IS WHY YOU COME HERE. Mmmmm soo good.

We decided to do the lamb salad and the pork sandwich. This was the best choice to get the best of both worlds. \n- They are known for their frozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and syrup. And olive oil and flaky sea salt, wildflower honey, sour cherry, and other flavors are other options. I didn't get it since I don't like how sticky the baklava gets stuck on my teeth, but friend got it and it was really good - and for the most part, what people wait for as dessert for their meal! Suggestion is to order it while you're already in line or you'll have to go back in line.

My friend and I decided to split a chicken sandwich and an order of fries. The chicken sandwich is supposed to come with \"\"granch\" dressing, fennel, navel orange, pickled red onion, pea shoots, mizithra cheese.\" I did not taste any navel orange or fennel, and there was only the slightest sprinkling of cheese. The sauce was not distributed evenly through the sandwich either. Not to mention, the chicken was dry and salty. The fries are supposed to come with cheese, oregano, and olive oil as well, but again, there was only the slightest sprinkling of cheese with no olive oil or oregano flavor either.

Kale salads can be on the bitter side, but the orange slices and fennel didn't quite balance it in sweetness but stood out on their own. Chicken was pretty good and moist. I'd say it's on par with a Split Bread quality salad.\n\nFrozen greek yogurt (olive oil and sea salt) - Yogurt is a soft serve froyo consistency watery and icy but still rich in flavor.

If you choose to live your life on the edge, by all means, go ham.\n\nLamb Sandwich (13) - Lots of meat so you're definitely getting what you paid for. However, the lamb was a tad dry.

When I first strolled into what was a local Denver spot called Chipotle Mexican Grill years ago in Denver. The second? A dumpling mecca in Shanghai called Din Tai Fung. The third? A revolutionary salad spot in Dallas called Bread Zeppelin, and most recently, a Greek spot in San Francisco called Souvia. This is going to be big. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nIn my mind there's a difference between \"gah look at that line what an inconvenience\" and \"wow look at that line that place must be LEGIT\". With Souvia it's very much the latter, but know that the layout is such that lines can easily pour into the street and even once you're inside you'll have people circling your table like a batch of vultures. \n\nEven so, the service at Souvia is fast and friendly, and that's largely thanks to what is a brilliantly simple menu. Pick your protein and how you want it and BAM. There is is. Dessert? Go for it, and you can expect it all in relatively short order. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nI'll get right to it - my $12.00 chicken sandwich was huge, and I made a huge mistake by ordering some frozen greek yogurt to go with it. Now, $12.00 isn't exactly cheap (we're talking more expensive than a Chipotle burrito with double meat here), but as you can see in the picture this was a quality dish. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nThis was an excellent coming together of ingredients here: chicken, yogurt sauce of some sort, tangerines, clover, onions, and cheese. While I think the menu could be mixed up just a bit more with bowls and other offerings and the like, these sandwiches alone are enough to carry Souvla into franchise or multi-location greatness. Star Granted.  \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nWith a slightly more varied menu this is an easy yes, but even with the existing offerings I'll highly recommend Souvla to anyone who will listen.

A generous (monetary and time wise) friend, picked up meals here for our party of four.  Knowing my palate taste, she ordered the Mary's free range chicken salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Zyk4DtsdIIYqMUteQfBdJw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) for me.  \nDue to traffic conditions and the 6 pm start time, I held off on eating this salad until after the game.  Our kind host and my other friend had the vegetarian salad which one touted as one of the best she's ever had.  Our host's dad enjoyed his healthy chicken salad too.\nWhen I got home, I dug in with raised expectations.  The good news, the salad lived up to the hype.  The greens probably lacked the crunch due to the four hour delay from pre game to returning home but the flavors were still good.  The citrus added a kick to the protein, greens, and the even yet not overly savory dressing; there was something pickled in the salad which made.  \nProbably didn't hurt that the Warriors won game one of the Finals in making that salad that much sweeeeter.  \nWould have this salad again, but not sure whether I'll actually visit the restaurant given the neighborhood parking difficulties.  Nice addition to the neighborhood that's home for two of my favorite restaurants for burgers, French onion soup, and simple meals (Absinthe and Chez Papa).", "author": "Mike C."}

While waiting, I polled my fellow supplicants about my choices: pork, lamb or chicken. Winner, winner was the chicken dinner. Number 2 was a split decision between pork and lamb. I bought all three. You have the choice between sandwich and salad. I got sandwich. The chicken was good, the orange slices were unexpected. Veggies were crisp. Chicken was shwarma-y. Awesome ? More \"just good\". The lamb was tasty. Fat was well rendered, the spicing was good. But frankly ? A little over cooked. I am saving the pork for the morning. I got a side of fries, and they were nice and crispy, with a sprinkle of feta. Good. Not great. I don't get what the fuss is about. The food did not live up to the line.

I don't need eating to be a whole affair all the time. After a couple hours at the MOMA, the bestie and I came here for a delicious but light lunch as we were going to get boba afterwards. We got a chicken salad to share which they split for us! How nice. They gave a good amount of toppings so it didn't feel like it was just salad. I noticed how some reviews said the dressing was too heavy or how the salad is bland. I thought it was really tasty and yes they do drench on the dressing but just ask for it on the side. \n\nWe got a greek yogurt and it was freaking delicious. What I liked was that they gave us the receipt and had us pick up the yogurt after we ate our salad so the yogurt wouldn't melt.  I went through a fro-yo crave and generally got the regular fro-yo. This greek yogurt gave all those pink berry and pink berry wannabes a run for their money. We got the honey one which I would suggest you avoid as the honey doesn't go well with a cold item.

The pork salad is both hearty and yet not overfilling - and the roast chicken one is also quite good. If your heart is set on starches I recommend the fries; the sandwich is decidedly less good than the salad. (Not typically my approach)\n\nAdd a bottle of their $27 Greek rose and a baklava and honey topped frozen yogurt and you've got yourself one hell of a meal.

That said I was pretty excited to try this place but each time I've been here was a less than mediocre experience.\n\nThe toppings for the chicken wrap is a creative combination of flavors. The orange is a nice touch; however, they are pretty conservative with the toppings. And I can't say I'm impressed with the rotisserie chicken. I've had it a few times and it's consistently bland and dry which is really atypical for rotisserie chicken so I don't know what their problem is.\n\nThe fries are a scam. Avoid it. They're $4 and the description paints this picture of these fancy fries with olive oil, lemon juice, cheese, and parsley on it. BUT IT'S A LIE. You don't taste ANY of that because they only put on a microscopic amount (same deal with the wrap). It might as well be plain fries. So I ask a server about sauce and apparently it's an extra dollar. So then you have to wait in a big line again just for some sauce while your food gets cold. Then the $1 sauce is hella tiny, only good for like 3/4 of the fries even if you're a conservative dipper. If you're liberal dipper you'll probably need 3. And no, they don't have ketchup.\n\nAs for portions, they don't work for me. The wrap is too small and the fries are too big. I can't finish both but I'll feel unsatisfied after just the wrap. For $12 \"fast food\" I think that's unacceptable. And I'm definitely not the only yelper who feels the same way.\n\nAnother annoying thing about this place: it seems to always be busy and people are always hella gunner when getting a seat. I always see people sitting down without order numbers and I'm just standing around holding a number in a super congested area like an idiot, servers constantly trying to get around me. Look, if a place is full, you don't get to sit down before ordering. We've ordered. We need a place to eat. Wait your freaking turn.\n\nOn the other hand, the frozen greek yogurt with baklava is really great and that's really all I come here for.", "author": "Andrew D."}

For $5 this fro greyo is the bomb. I had the intent to eat half and save the other half for my boyfriend. Oh how that intention got derailed during my 5 min walk home. It was melting so fast that I had to eat it all... I mean what is a girl suppose to do when you have a delicious melting frozen greek yogurt? Eat it faster right? Needless to say, this was awesome and guilt free so I'll be back for more, next time with the boyfriend in attendance. \n\nOn a Thursday night a few weeks ago, we came and ordered one superior farms lamb leg salad and one Mary's free range salad. I've always loved the vibe and the colorful salad bowls, but when we got ours we were highly disappointed with the meat quality in the salad. Maybe it was late at night and only end meat shaving were left. Also they were short on ingredients, cucumbers were out for the night. Not a bad thing to experience as this shows that ingredients are fresh. However, I would have loved to have a substitution for the missing cucumbers seeing that I removed the cheese as well due to lactose intolerance. So my salad was looking a little sad. \n\nLikely will go back to the Divisadero location for a meal but will continue to come back to Hayes for dessert. \n\nOverall: \nFood/ drinks: 2/5 for salad bowls; 5/5 for greek frozen yogurt \nService: 1/5 - felt rushed through the ordering process and throughout the entire meal as a waiter came to take our bowls away about 3 times during our dine in while there was vivd amounts of food still in the bowls. \nEnvironment:  2/5- great decor, free wifi and self seating, self water service, clean the tables yourself, music is way too loud for conversations", "author": "Janice K."}

The cheese, onions and bell peppers were a good combination, and the sausage was fragrant, just strangely kind of tough to eat.\n\nI've tried their sea salt and olive oil Greek yogurt. The yogurt itself is amazing, the oil is the most fragrant, pleasantly surprising part of this item, but I think the sea salt is pretty overwhelming. If you're looking for something sweet, go for the baklava frozen yogurt. The baklava is rich and delicious, and complements the cool, sweetness of the yogurt well. \n\nI usually, 100% will never order salad, but I make an exception at Souvla. Their pork shoulder salad is delicious, and it will last you 2 meals. The cheese on top is not too strong, and everything is a blend of incredibly healthy kale and other good greens. I have no idea what the dressing consists of, but it's light tasting and really enhances the salad in the right way. I'm willing to come back and try the chicken one (the pork in this salad tastes faintly like pulled pork without BBQ sauce)", "author": "Ke C."}

If I knew anything about my own culture I'd give you a final verdict, but I don't, so you have to figure it out yourself. \n\nMy friends parents, who are the loveliest parentals, treated us to a concert at the Nourse Theater and we wanted to meet up for dinner before.

The one con is really limited seating: about four 4-tops, a community table that seats about 8, and bar style seating. I think there's a 2-top right outside. \n\nI had the Chicken salad and have yet to regret that choice. It comes with a nicely chopped kale/romaine mix, granch dressing, fennel, navel orange chunks, pickled red onions, and feta cheese. Oh man, I'm still salivating thinking about this. Their chicken is the best roasted chicken I've had in SF. The only competitor in my humble opinion is Bell Street Farm in Los Alamos. I believe you can order a whole chicken to go too, but if I'm not mistaken it's $20 and that's overpriced. \n\nWe also tried the Greek fries, and the juicy potatoes. The latter was OMG GET IN MAH BELLY. I might have said this out loud. Drink wise we popped a bottle of Greek Bubbles which was really nice, not too dry and really refreshing.

I lived in Chicago for 6 years: home to a vibrant Greektown, real deal Lebanese shawarma, and more falafel than you can shake an olive stick at. So yeah - I miss it immensely!\n\nAnyway, after much trial and error, I've finally found really, REALLY great spit-fired meats (and being of Croatian heritage, I grew up on backyard spit-roasted lambs and pigs so I know my stuff). Souvla, you are the new 'it' kid in the Mediterranean (Greek to be more specific) category! Yes, it's pricey but I don't mind paying for a menu based on natural, vegetarian-fed meats from animals raised in a sustainable environment. \n\nI had a salad topped with pork that blew my mind... a bed of Romaine and kale topped with a very generous amount of American Homestead pork shoulder, cherry tomatoes, pickled red onion, thinly-sliced cucumber, and feta cheese all tossed with a minted Greek yogurt dressing. The portion was large and could easily serve as two meals if you start with the Avgolemono soup.\n\nAnd this sensational soup deserves its own paragraph: the classic Greek recipe is elevated with white mean chicken, buttery rice, and the perfect egg-lemon broth. This rendition is overwhelmingly crave-worthy... on the small side, but I'll definitely get it again. \n\nSouvla, you really hit it out of the park! I'll look forward to trying the olive oil yogurt next time. And a note to the owner: please open a location in SOMA or the FiDi!", "author": "Jelena Z."}

The salad of tomato, cucumber, and greens inside the sandwich wasn't bad, but definitely needed some seasoning.

The juicy potatoes are cooked in rotisserie drippings, which means you'll probably not want to share.\n\nIt's easily a $20+ meal, or more if you order their frozen Greek yogurt. While I loved the consistency of the fro-yo, I wouldn't order honey as a topping again...it hardened quickly and I was basically scooping chunks of honey into my mouth.

Yes, the wrap is huge and unwieldy and drips all over, but recognize that that grease dripping out of your wrap is melted animal fat, i.e., liquid deliciousness! So I say keep your head down, enjoy that luscious animal fat, and file Souvla away in your head as not a good first date place.\n\nThe wrap wasn't perfect, though. Ours came out slightly warmer than room temp and I can only imagine how much more amazing it would be if it had been hot. Same with the pita - it was on the hard end and lacked fluffiness. Again, the whole wrap would have been elevated with those small details.\n\nStill, all the ingredients were fresh and tasty.

Well, I've now tried Souvla, and I must say I don't really get the hype. It's a shame because I like the bare-bones, In-n-Out concept used - focus on three meats, add a veggie option (sweet potato, not tofu, in this case) and throw in some froyo to get more walk-by traffic.

Since we already secured our bench on Patricia's Green, it was too bad nobody told us to stock up on hot sauce. Mine was marginally disappointing, the $11 American Homestead Pork Shoulder in a Wrap. The fancy meat was rather sparse compared to the breadiness of the pita almost to the point that it tasted near-vegetarian with cherry tomato, cucumber, pickled red onion and feta cheese. The sweetness of the minted Greek yogurt wasn't helping matters much either (photo:  http://bit.ly/1y4XdXA).

Unfortunately, it was so tough to eat that I ended up throwing away all of the lamb. It was so hard and flavorless. Somehow, I'm hoping I had a bad piece, but I couldn't even eat it. Instead, I opened up my pita sandwich and just forked out the radish, cucumbers, onions and cheese to eat. I never felt like I wasted my money so much. On the other hand, the greek yogurt is what kind of saved this place. I loved the touch of sour taste in the greek yogurt paired with their various toppings. Although the baklava was something new for me, it was a great option.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-09", "description": "I've been to Souvla a couple times. The first time was for a mid-day meeting with colleagues. At my initial visit, it wasn't very busy since it was around 4 in the afternoon. We were able to grab a couple seats to enjoy their frozen Greek yogurt which was creamy, rich, and slightly tart. I had one with sour cherry syrup and my colleagues had the more popular one with baklava crumbs. I was impressed and vowed to return for an actual meal.\n\nLast night, I went in for dinner with two friends around 7:30 PM. Fearing this was prime dinner hour on a Friday and that there would be hoards of eager San Francisco yuppies, we were prepared for the worst. Thankfully, the line wasn't too bad and we were able to find seating thanks to a family of three that was on their way out. (Seating is first come, first serve.) Every seat was taken and just like the city itself, all space is valuable real estate in a small space like Souvla! \n\nSo how does Souvla work? You take a quick look at the paper menu at the door, and if you're like me you let your happy hour buzz dictate your ordering. That said, with gentle prodding from my oh-so-convincing buddy, I succumbed to wine temptation by ordering a pretty pricy glass of sparkling Greek wine. It was solid, but for a glass that rang up $12, I was hoping for more memorable vino. It was bright with notes of citrus (I'm being partly serious and partly facetious since I don't have the most sophisticated wine connoisseur palate.), but again, I didn't particularly feel that was a good value. Speaking of things not being of good value: the lamb sandwich ($13). Now, I know we live in San Francisco and with Hayes Valley being one of the hubs of bourgeois taste, I still have sticker shock for food that would otherwise be several bucks less elsewhere. The lamb sandwich comprised of chunks of spit-fired lamb leg, harissa-infused yogurt, red onion, cucumber, radish, and feta cheese tucked inside pita. The lamb was prepared well though it could've used more seasoning and wasn't as tender as you'd expect for its cooking method. The accompanying veggies and especially the feta cheese were nicely toothsome. However, I remember the sandwich served at room temperature which was disappointing when I was hoping for some hot meat in a warm pita to go with the chilled sparkling wine. \n\nThe dining room is rather loud so expect to talk very audibly... or go right ahead and do a little shouting if necessary because it's a packed house if last night is like every other night. Again, seating is tricky here. We were eating for about 20ish minutes and 15 of those minutes, there were people literally standing next to our table peering over to see how fast we could eat and how quickly we could drink -- which made eating, at times, a bit stressful. When you can feel the weight of multiple eyes on your table, one cannot help but feel pressured. \n\nIn all, Souvla serves up terrific frozen Greek yogurt but, for me, dinner and the ambiance were middle-of-the-road at best. Thankfully, with wonderful company and lovely friends with you, you're more forgiving of these things as you dine. Souvla is, in the words of Yelp, a solid \"3-star, A-OK\" joint: good, but not enticing enough for me to return.", "author": "James Z."}

Souvla is one of my favorite new restaurants, and it's partly because of their greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and syrup. The yogurt is the perfect amount of tartness and baklava is just plain delicious so this combination made my tastebuds happy!\n\nMy first time going was a Friday night, and it was obviously pretty busy but my friend and I were able to get seats at the bar. Is it even a bar or just a serving station? Either way we got to see glistening meat rotate and cook only 5 feet away from us, which only made me even hungrier! I got the lamb wrap, and it was very tender and juicy. After eating the yogurt first, I couldn't finish my lamb so I had half to take home, and it still tastes good the next day! \n\nI was creeping a bit and seeing what other people got, and I have to say the salads at Souvla actually looked pretty good too.

I didn't feel like the only vegetarian entree they had - grilled sweet potatoes and some other stuff as a sandwich. I opted for a small side salad and fries. They were both good though I'm probably not the only person who will be glad to see the fad of kale in salads pass. There was regular lettuce too but lots of chopped Dino kale. And I adore it cooked - probably have it twice/week. A guy working there popped by a tiny portion of their yogurt ranch sauce for the fries saying it was left over and he didn't want to waste it. It usually costs $1 extra. It was good, especially as a freebie. \n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the frozen Greek yogurt. The yogurt itself was rich and a bit tart. Very delicious.

But I'm willing to overlook that - that's how they chose to set up shop, and I willingly partook.\n\nWe waited in the long line, then jockeyed for and finally got a table.  Yay!  The food arrived not too long thereafter.  Between the four of us, we got two different wraps and two different salads.  I thought my chicken salad was pretty good - the veggies were fresh, and the chicken was tasty.  My three companions weren't quite as thrilled with their food (lamb wrap, chicken wrap, lamb salad).  The lamb in particular lacked the flavor that we were expecting.\n\nThe saddest part was the wine selection (all Greek wines, I believe).  When I visited Greece a few years ago, I was consistently unimpressed with the local wine, but I assumed I just didn't know what to order.  At Souvla, we tried two of the wines on the menu.  Both were incredibly sweet, even though we'd asked for the least sweet options, and just not good.  The wine also wasn't very cold (in fact, the metal cup that the wine came in was colder than the wine itself).

Guest check for two modest eaters:  $38.07.  Order wisely.  And also, caveat emptor, there is a general sense of upsell pressure from staff there.  \"If you're dining in, why not a glass of greek wine?  Why not a side order of greek dressing for $2 more?\"\n\nAs for what we ordered:\n\nThe chicken bowl comes with kale and delicious greens.  I'd say that is a 4 star item.  My friend loved it, period.  I thought it was a tiny bit small for what I paid ($12) and a tiny bit overdressed with olive oil, but still really was the highlight of our food.\n\nThe lamb sandwich wrap--I love pillowy wrap bread, so I almost always prefer the sandwich over any platter.  The ingredients individually were all very well done and delicious, but they didn't work together as a whole.  And this lack of balance can easily be fixed. Specifically, here are the elements:\n* meaty (a little too much and also not cut in a sandwich friendly way), \n* sour (not enough yogurt sauce, so be prepared to shell out an extra $2)\n* comfy carb (pretty good, pillowy wrap bread), \n* fresh (way not enough vegetables), and \n* unctuous (olive oil literally dripping all over my hand and plate).  \n\nWhat most people may expect from the gyro memories of their past is a mystery loaf of lamb/beef on a spit, thinly sliced to be easy to eat.  This wrap is not that--it's 100% genuine lamb.  Suggested improvements:  I'd actually use about 3 less chunks and shred the lamb a little bit more.  Also, please pick through and remove the excess connective tissues.  On at least three pieces I ate, I was stuck with lamb gum.  I've uploaded a pic to get a sense of the inside of the wrap.\n\nFRIES:  excellent.  I happily ate them all, along with the rest of my $2 granch sauce.\n\nGreek yogurt dessert:  as the restaurant was starting out (day 6), many guests who talked up the owners got the dessert for free.  Alas, we paid for ours.  At $5 it seems pricey, but I would say it was really worth it.  One of the owners went through the trouble to get those once ubiquitous NY coffee cups (a very nice touch).  The yogurt itself had a beautiful sourness and tang and the toppings and sauces were unusual and just worked.  Chopped baklava?  Really worked!  Although it's more expensive than some places, it's one of the two places I will now eat frozen yogurt (the other being Fraiche).\n\nThe people working there were nice and knowledgeable.  But the suggestive sell element was less focused on my personal well being, and more on upping the already hefty guest check I felt.  So that put me in a guarded mood rather than a happy, neighborly one.  If you want me to buy a glass of wine, offer me a little sip at my table perhaps?  If you were expecting a $20 meal for two, this isn't it.  The guest check for the meal (wrap, bowl, fries, extra side of greek ranch, and yogurt) will set you back a whopping $38.07 + any tip you might offer.  And this is for counter service, not table.  Three stars for the sandwich not living up to its potential, quite yet.  If the sandwich improves, I'd give this place four stars. And a definite 4+ stars for the yogurt.", "author": "Philip L."}

The greek yogurt is tasty and the baklava crumbles are the way to go, we found the olive oil + sea salt + honey to be a little odd (mainly because of the olive oil).\n\nI would definitely go back again but would make sure to get there on the earlier end of dinner time because by 7:30PM it was packed with people waiting for a seat!!!!!", "author": "Moneeza P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-24", "description": "Love the concept as greek staples like roasted chicken and lamb, in their traditional Mediterranean preparations, have been been under-represented in the fast casual segment.  Unfortunately, I think the execution at Souvla misses the mark and under-exploits the potential of these foods.  \n\nOn the positive side, the ingredients are high quality, the service is fast (a line extending to the street moved very quickly), and the environment in the restaurant is pleasant.   My wife and collective had the chicken sandwich (essentially, a souvlaki), the \"juicy\" potatoes (prepared under the chicken drippings), and a lamb salad.   The meat was a little dry.  Dry meat and bread is a bad combination in any sandwich.  More critical, I think, was that -- across both the potatoes and the sandwich -- was a missing \"herb-iness\" that is essential to Greek cooking.  The potatoes should have been bursting with oregano and lemon flavor, when in reality it lacked both save for a insubstantial scattering of oregano.  Same with the sandwich.  The chicken should have been rich with a garlicky, lemony, oregano-ized marinade, but it tasted fairly plain.  It's a real lost opportunity as both the meat and potatoes should have been rich in flavor.  Instead, everything was kind of bland.\n\nOverall, the place is a little disappointing and I probably wouldn't return here.", "author": "Andrew F."}

The chef here, Tony, did eight years as chef de cuisine at Kokkari and it shows.\n\nThe chefs here are talented at being both inventive / experimental and delivering high quality, excellent tasting dishes. For example, multiple rotisserie meats, including lamb, pork and chicken hand encrusted with cheese grinds giving the meats a flavorful boost. We had the chicken and actually ended up taking an additional entire rotisserie chicken home with us. Another example is the Frozen GREEK yogurt - my favorite was the baklava flavor, but the olive oil and salt flavor was yummy and new.

Since I was in the area and in need of lunch, I decided today was the day that I give it a try.\n\nThe location here is great, just a few shops down from Patricia's Green and situated among a number of other great restaurants, shops and dessert places. The presentation is great as well, everything from the trendy menu to the plating of the items served to you.\n\nI have a few problems with Souvla though. For one, if I am going to be paying $12 for lamb at a place where you order at the counter, I expect to be getting a good amount of meat. As evidenced by my pictures, this is definitely not the case. This is further troubling as it is obviously intentionally hidden by placing a pile of radish and cucumber on top of everything else. \n\nSecondly, there are basically three options on the entire menu for entrees. You basically get to choose from chicken, lamb or pork and that's it. If you are going to so drastically limit my options, I am going to place a much higher level of expectation on the quality than normal. Although the food was maybe slightly above average, these higher expectations were not met.\n\nLastly, I was rather disappointed with the greek yogurt with baklava crumbles on it. Quite frankly there were no crumbles. As this item was prepared before me, I saw the server literally pour frozen yogurt in a cup and then attempt to smash a piece of baklava on top against the side of the cup. This is simply unacceptable. It would be trivial to actually have crumbled baklava ready to at the very least sprinkle on top, or even better, actually mix it in to the yogurt like the professionals over at loving cup do.\n\nI doubt I will be inclined to give this place a second chance. I think Souvla needs to spend less effort trying to be trendy and more effort into increasing both the quality and quantity of their food.", "author": "Mark O."}

And that's before dessert (which, I can't repeat enough, is their saving grace). Most importantly, the flavors are muted, despite their vibrant, Instagram/Pinterest-worthy colorful presentations. The kale in the salad is tough, the meats are dry and lack flavor, and the portions are oddly small, especially for coming either with a pita or in a massive salad bowl.\n\nThe space is bright, airy, and warm, though, and if you want a sweet treat after your meal, get the yogurt.", "author": "Betty W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-12", "description": "I was really bouncing back between giving this place four stars or three stars. But In the end, I always give my ratings based on whether I would come back. Sadly Soulva doesn't succeed with this form of evaluation.\n\nLet's start with the good: the meats that this place cooks are exceptional. I haven't had such tender lamb or pork in a long time. They have a rotisserie in the back so you can see them roasting their chicken which is just as good. This place is also in the hear of Hayes Valley amongst a lot of restaurants and shops so it's one of the better parts of town.\n\nHowever... if you are going to be a place that has a limited menu (w/ high prices!), you really need to make sure said items are exceptional. I got a sandwich and a salad. I am not a big fan of pita to begin with, so maybe this was the issue, but I seriously felt that pita was the only thing I could taste with each bite. I don't why it was so overpowering. Like I said, the meat is delicious so I actually found myself pulling out the meat to enjoy it rather than sacrifice the taste with the pita. The salad was not that much better. The harissa dressing wasn't bad but it wasn't exceptional either. I think the thing that bothered me was the fact that it wasn't really Greek, it was a kale salad with the dressing and then the meat. Granted, this place is more Greek fusion (first place of its kind that I have tried), but still it wasn't too spectacular. The fries also... It seemed like the only thing different than regular fries was the additional of some grated Greek cheese, I mean come on, really? I also tried the soup, which actually wasn't bad, probably the best part of the meal...\n\nMaybe I am just super picky because I have been to some amazing Greek places (see my past reviews) and also this place is more Greek fusion as I said earlier. Unfortunately, this concept needs to be more refined by Soulva, especially if they intend to keep a limited menu... Part of the reason I docked this review down to three stars is because I am already bored.", "author": "Kunal N."}

When it's your turn you can order your drinks, desserts, and entrees at the counter and then take your number and sit down (hopefully you can find a seat).

It bears little resemblance to other more traditional Greek restaurants -- ornate carpets have been replaced with hardwood floors, clunky wooden furniture with industrial metal stools. \n\n2) THE FOOD: I've had the Greek fries (incredibly crispy and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, oregano and mizithra cheese), avgolemono soup (basically egg-lemon soup with rice and chicken -- one of my favorite soups in the world -- though I will say Kokkari's version is better) and a lamb gyro (complete with yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion and feta). The meat came right off the rotating metal spits on display and was so damn tender and flavorful.

I happen to work for the company who supplies their plates, so I have a special place in my heart for a business that buys local as much as possible. Charles and his team are ultimate professionals, and this little restaurant in the heart of Hayes Valley garners all kinds of (well-deserved) attention from the media. I love the concept, the simple menu, and sticking to the things that you can do better than anyone else around. The flavors here are off the chain, and you cannot go wrong with either the pita or salad. Also, the hype you're reading in all the other reviews about the frozen greek yogurt with olive oil and sea salt? It's not just hype, my friends. You really must save room for this treat when you come here. \n\nAlso, I just want to mention that while Souvla does Greek food extremely well, they don't take themselves too seriously. We came here with some friends for my husband's birthday, April 1, and they had completely transformed it into a taqueria for April Fools. They even hired a Mariachi band.

The two tables outside were open but none of the tables inside had seats available. We grabbed three seats along the wall and ended up moving to a table as soon as some people got up. They have hooks under the wall tables surrounding the place which is a super plus. The communal table in the middle was great. It was roomy enough to share. Steve held down the fort while we ordered. My friend had the  Lamb Sandwich, I had the Chicken Sandwich and Steve had the Pork Salad. We also got the Egg and Lemon soup. The soup was delicious and hot. It had really good seasoning with bits of chicken but none of flavors were overpowering. The Greek sparkling mineral water and beer were both refreshing. You order efficiently and grab a number. The food is brought to you, served in white tin bowls in little trays. We loved our food. The bread they used to wrap the sandwich is chewy and held together well. I almost always have issues eating wrapped food but none of the stuff fell out. The paper and bread held everything together. I loved the pickled veggies and tangerine oranges with the meat. Everything tasted fresh and light. The salad was too hearty for me but my husband loved it. I don't like a mouth workout so the pieces of kale and stuff were too big for my liking. Steve very much enjoyed the salad just the way it was. We ended the night with Baklava Yogurt and French Fries. Both \"desserts\" were great. The Fries were cooked nicely and had yummy lemon seasoning. The Baklava Yogurt had the perfect tanginess and sweetness because the flavors complemented each other. The service was great and the place was clean. Even the restroom was tidy. You can see into the kitchen while you wait for the restroom and the kitchen looked clean and well organized. A HUGE line formed while we were eating and many people had to wait for a table. The line was steady even after we were all done eating. It's a very popular place and worth it.", "author": "Jen L."}

I ordered the pork salad with dressing and cheese on the side. The food was served within ten minutes of us sitting down, and it was so good! Huge chunks of juicy pork mixed with kale, romaine, tomatoes, and pickled onions. The salad portion itself was big enough to satisfy my hunger and to justify the $12 we spent on it. The garlic yogurt dressing was creamy, but acidic enough to cut the fat of the pork. I would recommend getting the dressing on the side, since I used about 1/4 of it and it was definitely enough. \n\nI definitely plan on visiting Souvla again to try the rest of the dishes, especially the lamb and the frozen greek yogurt!", "author": "Abby S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-15", "description": "With a few changes, this could be a spectacular lunch spot. The number one thing that needs improvement is portion size, or something to change the value equation. There are two counters, the one at the front is for yogurt and the one towards the back of the space is for ordering food. \n\n*FOOD:\n\nLamb Sandwich: The meat was cut into uneven cubes, making it unfriendly for sandwich consumption and there were a few sinewy pieces that should have been removed. There was way too much meat and not enough of the pickled veggies or yogurt sauce to balance this sandwich out. If you want more sauce they charge you extra, which just seems unfair. This had mizithra cheese on it, which doesn't really melt and just acts as a conduit for salt. \n\nGreek Fries: Nicely crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. These came with mizithra cheese on top as well.\n\nGranch Yogurt Sauce: A nice take on ranch dressing, but it was $2 for this small portion. I know Chipotle charges the same for a side of guacamole, but unless they're using grass fed milk, it seems too expensive for a side of sauce. \n\nChicken Bowl: This was their rotisserie chicken with sprouts, on a bed of kale with orange segments and yogurt dressing. The portion on this guy was a bit small and I could have used a bit more roughage to round the dish out. Everything tasted great and I didn't think there was too much dressing (something I am sensitive to in general), but again, the portion was a bit measly. \n\nFrozen Yogurt w/ Baklava Crumbles: This was a very yummy way to finish our meal. The yogurt was creamy and fresh and the sweetness of the baklava balanced out the tartness of the yogurt. \n\n\n*VALUE: \n\n$12 for a lamb sandwich seems a bit steep, when all you're getting is the wrap by itself. The quality is great, but unless something changes value-wise, it's unlikely I'll be back. Also, charging $2 for extra yogurt sauce is just too much, especially since they wouldn't give me half portions of 2 different flavors of yogurt sauce to try when I asked. \n\n\n*ATMOSPHERE: \n\nIt was nicer inside than I thought it was going to be. Very minimal with some nice accents of foliage.", "author": "Victoria J."}

The type of bread used reminded me of Manaeesh from back home, which was delicious. Along the wrap, i got side of fries that were really good as well (wish the quantity was more though) and the Greek Sour Cherry yogurt which is the best yogurt i have yet to try.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-03", "description": "Fresh, juicy, tasty and overall fantastic Greek food, people! \n\nFOOD: Everything was cooked just right. I ordered lamb Wrap (also available as a salad, which I'm going to try next time), and my taste buds were truly happy. The meat was very tender, juicy but not fatty, and it had just the right amount of seasoning/flavor. The wrap included thinly sliced cucumbers, radish, and pickled red onions. The bread was also delicious. Though the price of similar items is typically lower in the area, Souvla has all the rights to charge the amount they do, thanks to their food quality. And, the size was also very satisfying for a lunch option (perhaps, a hungry 200+ lbs man would want 2 of these though). \n\nSIDES: Souvla offers all their wraps in a form of a salad as well, plus they have Greek fries, salad, and couple other items on their menu. The Greek fries were wonderful! Lightly seasoned, perfectly cooked, golden and crispy with a touch of cheese. The fries complimented the wrap very nicely.\n\nSWEETS: The menu of this place is a minimalist's dream: everything is organized neatly, and, although there are only several options to choose from, all of them are very decent. As for desserts, Souvla offers their famous frozen yogurt. Of course, I had to go with the Baklava crumbles for the topping. It was great! The yogurt was not really frozen, it was just perfectly chilled, so you could taste the tart, sweet, creamy but light deliciousness under a layer of decadent, honey-crusted baklava! It was such a pleasant finishing touch to my meal. \n\nDESIGN: A very modern and elegant interior with a dash of ethnic beauty.\n\nSERVICE: 5++! Everyone at Souvla was super nice, the person at the front desk was very efficient and, despite the long line during lunch rush, our wait wasn't that long at all! We got our food ready in about 10 minutes. Plus, when we wanted to share 1 frozen yogurt in the end (couldn't go for a full cup after all the good food),  the front desk person served it in 2 cups with no problem at all. That kind of service does deserve 5 + stars!", "author": "Olga G."}

They do offer glasses of Greek wine and exotic desserts but their focus is succulent spit-fired meats like pork shoulder, free range chicken, and lamb leg.  You can get any of those savory fillings in a pita wrap or salad bowl.  It's kind of like a Greek Chipotle.  But Chipotle doesn't have floor to ceiling glass-walled rotisserie cranking in front of you.  \n\nI went with the Lamb Wrap, accompanied with Harissa-Spiked Yogurt, Cucumber, Radish, Pickled Red Onion, & Feta Cheese.  It was pretty good but the only reason this place fell from 4 to 3 stars is there was a giant puddle of oil gathering underneath as I ate.  It was so rich that I could only eat half in fact, I feared a coronary.  My wife, who had the Veggie Wrap with Garlic Yogurt, Chopped Kalamata Olive, Toasted Walnuts, Pickled Red Onion, Pea Shoots, & Mizithra Cheese, really enjoyed hers however.\n\nSouvla is a great concept, I love places like that work with a few key elements and focus on quality and subtle elements to differentiate themselves.

I decided to try the lamb my second time around, and I was surprised that it wasn't served hot/fresh, the way I had expected, but since I got it on a salad bed, it was still just as flavorful. I love how they give you a huge bowl for the salad and don't skimp out, and I left feeling full! The ambiance is also nice, with white tables. There are 4-6 seaters on the left side, and individual \"bar\" like seats around the right side and the back (the back seats you can directly see the meat being cut/cooked - kinda cool).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-14", "description": "Honestly, if I were to rate Souvla based just on their salads, I would've just given 3 stars, but their Greek yogurt really bumped them up to a 4. \n\nThe salads are a reasonable portion, but I still think they're a little pricey. It's like $13-15 for one? I had the chicken and my friend had the pork. They were SOLID, but for that price and the popularity, I kinda expected something that would knock my socks off. I ordered the chicken knowing that it was from their own rotisserie, but it had this dry texture even though it wasn't necessarily dry. Maybe it was the (excessive) dressing that made it seem like it wasn't dry. Aside from it not being anything spectacular, I got quite a few bits of bone in my chicken.. I didn't make any complaints or return it but thought I'd just mention that. Also, the chicken could be shredded in smaller pieces? I know knives are provided but I personally just don't like using knives in a bowl LOL. \nThe pork in my friend's salad was a little on the salty side but I guess the flavor was there. Had that dryishness also. \n\nNow for the greek yogurt! It was the perfect dessert!! It was so delicious, you'll definitely like it if you like greek yogurt. The yogurt itself was super creamy and perfectly tart but still sweet! I had the baklava crumbs on mine and I honestly was worried I would run out of topping befoe I finished my yogurt, but there was the perfect amount to have it dispersed all the way! If you like nuts&cinnamon I definitely recommend this one. My friend got the wildflower honey and that was so aromatic! I recommend that one if you like floral flavors (: \n\nOverall, Souvla is super cool. I love the decor, it's super bright and clean and the workers are nice (they have cool aprons too). I could skip their entree items, but definitely recommend their greek yogurt. It's something worth coming for. Prices may be a little up there for what you get but it's SF so eh. Oh yeah, just a tip, the lunch rush is crazy. Everybody's there LOL. 4 stars.", "author": "Holly P."}

We've been to their Hayes Valley and NOPA locations, and though I'd like to say they were both equally consistent, the latter (NOPA) was better, e.g. the actual wrap was softer and not as rigidly thick as Hayes location. The Avgolemono was fantastic at both, and the salad sparkling. We've had the pork shoulder and lamb, and though we love both, prefer the lamb. I love the mix and match options, e.g. you can get any meat as a wrap or on salad--and their salad isn't just a bed of wimpy greens, it's a true greek salad with plump, juicy tasty bursing with flavor red tomatoes, juicy fresh cucumbers and kalamata olives, with feta, and a dressing with miles and miles of will not quit flavor. Their fries come in a charming cup and are perfectly crunchy with just the right amount of soft give, and excellently salted. But the ultimate is their yogurt, which I love with sea salt and honey (my husband loves their baklava crumble). We sat outside in the patio and had such a phenomenal time . . . no wait and quiet. But the Hayes was deafeningly loud, zero acoustics, a a line forever, zero seats, aghh . . . but the food is as solid as anything, with freshly roasted meats--there's no better and fresh 'quick bite' around :-)", "author": "Ranjan P."}

I was looking forward to it because I had heard good things from a few of my friends.  I was not disappointed...\n\nI loved the look and feel of the place.  It so reminded me of the smaller little restaurants in Greece.  Bare floors...  Greek homey decor...  and not overly lit.  And although the music wasn't Greek, I did like the selection that was somewhat underground and hip.  In Greece, they would be playing music like that if they weren't spinning Greek tunes.  Of course being \"hit\" with the sight and smell of the delicious rotisseried meats was a big plus!\n\nThe food was delicious, and honestly, that was the most \"home cooked\" meal I've had at a restaurant in a long time.  The food is honest...  everything tasted fresh and natural and the choice of seasonings were perfect.  I had a lamb pita sandwich...  the generous portion of lamb was succulent.  It was complimented by a slight twist on tradition, which I believe worked really well.  Usually, Greeks will just throw on some tomato, onion and a big blob of tzatziki, but this sandwich featured cucumber, pickled onion (which I love), and feta, which was all held together by yogurt which was spiked with harissa (red pepper sauce).  The flavors were all complimentary without any one being overpowering...  just the way it should be!  Also, this was served on what appeared to be a homemade pita!\n\nFor my side, I chose the Juicy Potatoes, which were roasted and coated with the meat drippings!  A little herbaceous spices gave the dish even more character.  I thought this was a great alternative to fries, as it reminded me of my yiayia's potatoes, (yes, I am Greek).  However, the fries that I saw looked amazing, and I will try those next time.\n\nI topped that off with a cold Greek beer, which with the food and the atmosphere, brought me back to Greece.\n\nAnd as if I wasn't full enough...  I'm just a glutton for punishment, I had to try the frozen Greek Yogurt...  which I topped with Visino, the Greek cherry syrup...  yep...  my journey back to Greece was complete!  Cold, tangy yogurt topped with that deliciously intense and sweet syrup just completed the experience.\n\nKudos to the staff who are all very friendly and helpful!\n\nOnce again, I will stress the quality of the food here, both of the food and in its preparation.

I'd come back often for the yogurt, but the salad will be an indulgence when I'm too lazy to put my own together. \n\nThe vibe is great at night. It's a dark dining room, kind of a bar vibe.

I told him that I was there to pick up my phone order and he said he didn't know what I was talking about, 5) the cashier then heard Moudi say this and told Moudi about my order, 6) Moudi became very annoyed and irritated that he had to grab my order (which was sitting right on the counter in front of him), 7) Moudi then tossed me my package and slammed a cup of yogurt in front me on the counter.\n\nThis type of service that makes customers feel unwelcome is completely unacceptable.

It's dark and bustling at souvla, with a wall of revolving roasting meats dripping their delicious nectar of melted fats as you watch and wish you were one among them in that rotisserie kingdom. Except alive and not a dead hunk of lamb.\n\nHonestly I thought my lamb wrap was kind of dry. It was large, yes, but lamb was mainly too tough, and the rest were fairly standard Greek ingredients. The supposedly famous potatoes were disappointing. Generally just oily, they lacked both unique seasoning and any sort of desired texture beyond fluffy carbohydrates.\n\nMaybe I'll try the Greek yogurt.

But something just seemed off to me.\n\nMy friend and I both ordered the Lamb Leg Sandwich (Harissa-Spiked Yogurt, Cucumber, Radish, Pickled Red Onion, Feta Cheese), and split an order of the Greek Fries (Olive Oil, Lemon Juice, Oregano, Mizithra Cheese). The sandwich was certainly generous in its portion size. However, it was surprisingly dry and bland. I guess I was expecting a little more burst of exotic flavors and juices (something more along the lines of a shwarma). But all that you could really taste with each bite was the dry lamb and the feta cheese. I kept pouring on the hot sauce just to mix up the flavor pattern. Maybe a few tomatoes and some spicy yogurt sauce would have added to the mix. As for the Greek Fries, they were a bit undercooked and under-seasoned for my taste. Next time, I think I'll order some extra yogurt sauce to dip them in. That being said, for $4 you'd think that they could throw in some sort of dipping sauce at no extra charge. It's like charging a diner for ketchup or aioli. \n\nFor dessert, my friend indulged in the frozen Greek Yogurt (which she loved). \nOver all, the place was fine. The service was friendly, the atmosphere was cozy, the prices are affordable - so I'd definitely give it another shot. Though next time, I think I'll explore the rotisserie chicken and pork shoulder options.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Even though the choice is not huge (four meals and four beverages) everything they do is nicely presented, freshly made and simply delicious.\n\nWe chose the lamb sandwich and the greek toast. \n\nThe lamb wrap comes with scrambled eggs, radish, tomato, onion, avogolemono, garlic yogurt and feta cheese. I looked around in the restaurants - the majority of people ordered this dish and everyone was quite obviously very happy about it. \n\nThe greek toast (pieces of crispy sugar and cinnamon dusted pita bread) is served with sour cherry syrup and frozen Greek yogurt - I promise it is the best! Overall, I saw only empty plates going back to the kitchen - and that is always a good sign!\n\nIn comparison to other brunch places in California, the portions served here are relatively small so you can easily pick two dishes if you are very hungry or share three between two people. Prices rank between $9 and $13 and these are totally reasonable.\n\nAlso great about this place is that we only waited for 5 minutes to order and be seated at Souvla on a Saturday morning at 11am, which is really unique in San Francisco.

Greek cuisine paired with fresh ingredients, unique flavor combinations, and quality meat makes for an amazing meal. I had the chicken sandwich, which is essentially a pita wrap, and it was one of the best Greek wraps I've ever had. The pita was toasted perfectly for a slight crunch on the edges, while still chewy and thick. The chicken was taken right off the rotisserie, and the grill flavor paired really well with the fennel and pickled onions. The mizithra cheese and the navel orange slices really pulled it all together, and it added an unexpected twist to the wrap that brought California flavors to traditional Greek food. Their Greek fries were also great, with a good portion of crispy, fat fries that were seasoned and drizzled with a little cheese.

The ingredients are incredibly fresh, and the standouts are actually the vegetable pairings (pickled onions, tomato, cucumber). The wrap itself was fluffy and seemed to be house-made.\n\n- Frozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava Flakes & Syrup ($5): I haven't had much baklava in my life, but the stuff here is delicious! There was just the right amount of syrup to top it off. The yogurt itself was unremarkable.

I was not expecting that type of ambiance for a Greek restaurant, but I guess it is Hayes Valley after all. The restaurant is small so it's a little difficult to find a table; it's also pretty loud and dimly lit.\n\nI liked that they have a simple menu consisting of 3 different meats (chicken, pork shoulder, lamb) and a veggie option in the form of a \"sandwich\" or salad and sides that include fries with olive oil, lemon juice and cheese, roasted potatoes, and Greek salad. They even have froyo - I really wanted to try the one with baklava crumbles! But I already planned to go to Smitten that night for my ice cream fix haha. I ordered the pork shoulder sandwich, which was delicious! I mean I was STARVING from the gym so that might have been part of the reason I was practically inhaling my food, but I still think it would have been really good. The meat was tender, the sauce was good, it had a perfect amount of cheese, and the bread was so soft. I'd definitely order it again! We also ordered the fries and salad, which were okay.

If you've ever had Greek wine and perhaps been disappointed, now is the time to try again!  The selected rose and white offerings are delicious.\n\nAnd yes, there is a dessert worth trying too:  frozen Greek yogurt.  The crazy thing was all of us each liked a different flavor.

I mean the cuter the animal, the more I want to cook it and serve it in a sandwich. And they do a good lamb shoulder. Tender cuts, deboned and well spiced. All the seasonings are great, nothing over the top (like it's not just covered in mayo or yogurt). I actually enjoyed my meal. Now the part that is sort of my weak spot ... the frozen greek yogurt. So far I have only had the baklava and the olive oil & sea salt. I have to see they are both great combos and depending on the mood decides which I get. Sadly I have been sick so I have been avoiding it. But it's tart and fatty and even though it's cold out I don't give a crap I am gonna have it. I think it's well priced for the area, and it's relatively quick for what it is. \n\nThe people running it are really friendly. Like everyone has a smile on their face and it's like one of those places where you actually see that the people involved actually like working there. Like not just a forced fake smile.\n\nLayout of the place is awesome too. Like the communal table, is a great idea. The outside & inside bar is awesome and nice looking. The only thing that's weird about the layout is ... where to wait to order or for your order. There are two places to order and people walk in and get confused because they are located at the entrance (where the indoor/outdoor bar is) and the other at the other end by the display of rotisserie chickens. I think I know what they are trying to go for, but I think people are not going to figure it out so they all sort of stutter by the entrance trying to figure out what to do.

I drive an hour just to eat here twice a week (and dream about it the other five nights). Yeah - it's not what you would imagine as \"traditional greek food\", but you can get that at a gazillion other places in San Francisco. It's innovative and exciting! I always get the white sweet potato salad, but have tried almost everything on the menu and it's all incredible. The employees are always super duper friendly, and the food generally takes less than 5 mins to prepare (perks of having a simple menu!)

The meat was delicious...succulent and well seasoned, with a mix of crunchy veggies and sauce. The gyro was thick and toasted. A side of the Greek fries and I was hooked.

And given that they pretty much have only three things: a gyro sandwich, a salad, and yogurt, that's saying A LOT!\n\nWith the slightly higher price tag ($10 for salad, $12 for sandwich) that may at first intimidate usual lunch grabbers, the quality of the meat and accessories is totally worth it. For the salad, they give you a HUGE BOWL of lightly dressed kale, lettuce, and assorted fresh vegetables with loads of your choice of meat. I have yet to finish the salad bowl in my past two visits. The sandwich may be on the more moderate side in terms of portion, so if quantity per price is what you are looking for, you could be disappointed.\n\nI was especially pleasantly surprised by their frozen Greek yogurt. Even the most tart frozen yogurt at places like Easy Breezy and Yogurtland are TOO SUGARY for my taste. Not this place! Their frozen yogurt is softer, more watery, much less sugary, and tasted great with my choice topping of sour cherry syrup. \n\nOverall, I am super happy to have discovered Souvla. The salad + yogurt combo is going to have me keep coming back for more!\n\n\nGood:\n--- juicy, high-quality delicious meat (chicken, pork, lamb) and veggie\n--- HUGE and healthy salad bowl portion\n--- good fries\n--- amazing frozen greek yogurt\n\nPossible bad:\n--- slightly higher $$\n--- sandwich portion not big\n--- line can sometimes be long and confusing", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

The restaurant itself is not much to speak of.  The silverware is basic.  The seating is basic.  The napkins are paper, albeit high-end paper.  But the food seems well-sourced.  And whoever puts their plates together knows a thing or two about tastes, textures, and food.  I would dare say that a chef is in house.  \n\nNot knowing the size of their offerings I over ordered.  I started with free range chicken salad that came with fennel, orange segments, pea shoots, and cheese.  First the warm chicken was really good.  Next, the salad was not overdressed and the dressing was good.  A first class salad.\n\nThe leg of lamb wrap came with onion, feta cheese, radish, cucumber and harissa spiked yogurt.  The lamb was the real thing: lamb that tasted like lamb.  Everything else in the wrap was fresh and in balance.  \n\nAll in all a good meal at a good price in a good place.", "author": "David D."}

We had to hover a little to grab some seats at the bar, but it didn't take more than a few minutes. There are several 4-person high tables, a large communal table, and some bar seating throughout the space. I would suggest not coming with a large party unless you go early or are prepared to wait. \n\nThe ambience was dim, with holiday lighting and decorations. It reminded me of a bar in lower East side of NYC. Definitely a nice spot for a date.\n\nOnto the food: The menu is pretty straightforward - your choice of meat (chicken, lamb, pork) or veggie in the form of a bowl or wrap, plus some sides. We opted for two lamb wraps and a veggie wrap, plus a side of the fries with garlic yogurt dipping sauce, for around $15 per person total. I thought the lab wrap was great - lots of big pieces of lamb, some cheese, and some pickled onions and cucumbers. We did notice, though, that the lamb sandwich was very oily on the outside: it's wrapped once in foil and then in paper, but you still end up getting some oil on your hands when you eat it. My dinnermate also noted that the wrap was a little light on the veggies for his preference. We ended up skipping dessert (though the Greek froyo looked amazing) - will try it next time. \n\nOverall, a yummy spot for lunch when you're shopping in Hayes Valley or for a casual dinner date.

Yesterday we struck gold. Nestled between Patxi's Pizza and... some random store, is the clean and refreshing white tiled Souvla. Maybe I missed it because of the small sign right above the door, or the crowd of people waiting to get in that obscured my view, but I am glad we did.\n\nFOOD:\n\nDelicious. The menus is small and focused, you essentially pick your protein (or the veg option) and get it as a wrap or salad. I had the pork shoulder, she had the lamb. We both got salads. They were varied and delicious, just the right amount of dressing. The kale to lettuce ratio was a little high, but that's probably a personal preference. The price is a little high when you think about it as a $12 wrap instead though. It's funny how I imagine salads should cost more than sandwiches, but that's the world we live in I guess. \n\nSERVICE: \n\nPretty minimal, you order at the counter and find a seat. Everyone was polite, young, hip. They had really nice aprons? Not much to say one way or another. \n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThey've only been open a short time, but it's pretty typical Neu SF: Hip, line out the door, tech elite, fancy casual. Not bad, not good, just how it is. We sat in the indoor window seats, which is pretty nice, but the outdoor window seats face directly in towards you (Sort of like.. sitting on the inside of an \"L\" shaped table, and someone is sitting at the bottom side of the \"L\"). It made it feel a little bit like they were watching us eat, because, they were. A little weird when you have tzatziki sauce running down your chin, but not the worst in the world. \n\nGo, try it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-06", "description": "First thing I noticed about Souvla was the very long line extending from their entry way.  On a positive note, the long line means their food is very popular with the locals! This restaurant is really small so be prepared to just grab-n-go rather than dine-in. There is a park right across the street though so you can sit on the benches or tables there and enjoy your meal. I had the pork wrap which was essentially a gyro but was made burrito-style. I thought it was very flavorful and filling but the price was pretty steep, $11 ($13 for the salad version, wtf?!). I also tried the greek frozen yogurt with baklava topping and that was almost life changing. One cup was $3-4 so I had them split one order in half between two cups (for my sister and I). This ended up being a better idea than we had originally thought because they ended up being very generous with the \"half\" they put in each cup! The baklava topping was very tasty and I was surprised that I liked the yogurt part because I am not generally a fan of greek yogurt. So if you're okay with a 3/4 portion and go with a friend ask them to split an order in half ;) Great way to save money and get more than the usual single order. Another tip is for foodies going just for the yogurt. If you don't plan on ordering anything else, ask someone toward the front of the line if they don't mind ordering for you and give them the $3-4 to cover the cost. Unlike the other items on their menu the yogurt is served right away, whereas you get a number placard and have to wait for your hot food items or salad to be brought out. So if you only want yogurt, save yourself some time by avoiding the long line and see if one of the friendly patrons is willing to help you out!

For the lamb sandwich and the roasted potatoes made with the drippings. Also the frozen yoghurt. The sandwich was a pretty decent size and it was heavy. The problem was the lamb in mine was so chalky dry. Like large dried cubes of lamb. Hard to take bites out of cause the meat was tough to chew through. Offered my friend a bite, who has been there a few time, and she said that it was so dry. Disappointed :(. Maybe it was just that day, but it still made me sad. The potatoes were cooked well and a little greasy from the drippings, but that's to be expected and I was good with it. The yoghurt was good. Not a fan of the baklava one. It has this fake cinnamon taste(kinda like hot tamale candy) and turned me off. But the yogurt itself was good! I may not try it again but at least I did.", "author": "mel l."}

I got a a pork sandwich and my mother got a chicken salad. The salad would have been better without the chicken. The chicken was a bit dry and especially shredded up, the texture was not great. The pork sandwich was ok. The pita bread or wrap bread was dry and rather tough to bite off. The pork itself was alright, a bit on the dryer side and towards the end of my sandwich, I found myself picking out bits of meat and only eating the veggies and dry bread.\nNow the fries were great. If I go again, the only thing I would order were the fries. Then I would walk out and eat the main course elsewhere. Anyway. Fries. Amazing. Yes.

That day has finally arrived. For those that don't know, Charles has worked side by side with some of the world's most famous culinary talents, including Thomas Keller himself and he's worked at Bouchon, RN74, Michael Mina and most recently at Kokkari (one of the highest rated restaurants in SF for years). In short, the man is ambitious, knows food and is now bringing it to you in his own concept. \nSouvla is a hip, unpretentious establishment. It's design is simple with a large community table and tables for smaller groups. It is tastefully done and beautiful to look at. It definitely makes you feel like you are in Greece, which is a welcome addition to the many cultural motifs throughout the city. With the exception of Kokkari there aren't many Greek places. As you walk in you'll see the Souvla oven by the front counter. Here is where the magic happens. Chicken, lamb, pork and sweet potatoes make their rounds over an open flame, slowly searing in juices and flavors. All of them are to die for. You get your pick and they are stuffed into a Gyro with amazing sauces and condiments that you won't find anywhere else. \nThe menu is fairly simple but there is beauty in simplicity here. You won't agonize over choices and do not forget to get the Greek fries. They are utterly fantastic.\nSouvla is perfect for the casual diner and even those looking for serious food without the fuss of a more formal restaurant.

I chose the veg as a salad: white sweet potato,  pickled red onion, walnuts, rasins, pea shoots, lacinato kale (as opposed to lettuce? Yes, please!!), Mitizrah cheese and a yogurt dressing. There wasn't anything I would have changed. It was fantastic. Unreal. My husband had the chicken as a gyro,  which I tasted.  The chicken, which is done on a rotisserie,  was moist and tender.

A gyro sandwich or souvlaki is comfort food to me. When I heard about Souvla I said to myself I have to go there. The place is really nice, modern and clean, and the service is great. Except that I wasn't really crazy about the food. Yelpers who give this place 5 Stars owe it to themselves and to Yelp viewers, especially, to go visit a real Greek deli. To be fair, what I found satisfying was the wine list. Love the Greek rose and the white. I'll probably come back to this place if I'm in the neighborhood, nibble on some fries and enjoy some more of their Greek wines.", "author": "Alex B."}

The following day, we were out on a excursion and on the way back to our room he says, \"so we are having dinner at Souvla right?\" Hell yes! The first time, he had the chicken sandwich and I had the roasted vegetable salad and for dessert we had the frozen Greek yogurt and baklava; all absolutely delicious. I tried avgolemono for the first time *sigh* looove!! Oh my, seriously, just thinking about this place makes my mouth happy! Service is fast, and efficient, dining area is clean.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-09", "description": "Got some take out items here today for lunch.  I ordered the lamb salad, vegetarian salad and the Greek fries.  My co-worker, who wanted the vegetarian salad, let me try a bite of this rather unusual dish with sweet potato as the star.  But it works!  Its sweetness is undercut by the Kalamata olives and their juice, creating a distinctive and complex flavor.  The lamb salad contains big cubes of very tender, moist meat.  The yogurt dressing works very well with the whole ensemble.  The salads are made up of more interesting greens, including kale and pea sprouts, than the tired old packaged-style mixed greens one ordinarily gets in a restaurant.  The fries are very crunchy, very likely twice-fried.  At $10, I think the vegetarian salad is overpriced.  Otherwise, I did like what I had and look forward to coming back!", "author": "Yvette F."}

I ordered the vegetable salad with a side of lamb and garlic yoghurt (about $15 inc t&t).  \n\nThe food was pretty tasty.  The salad was generously portioned and had a good mix of kale, romaine lettuce, olives, walnuts and greek hard cheese.  The slices of white sweet potato on top were very nice.  I'm not sure whether this is a 'true vegetarian' option because it would not surprise me if the sweet potato was basted in the rotisserie juices to make it so delicious.  \n\nThe side of lamb was ok - the flavour was fine but as numerous people have commented, the lamb comes in little bites that are quite chewy. I'd prefer shredded lamb shoulder. \n\nOverall - a pretty good, healthy-ish option in the Hayes Valley.  I like the choice between a wrap or a salad.

A few of the chunks of meat were cartilage. Who wants to eat chunks of cartilage? \"Not I,\" said this eater. Overall the souvlaki was okay, but it was definitely not worth $13.

And with only four  choices on the menu, it didn't inspire me to think \"I can't wait to try the chicken next time.\" And with only four choices, there isn't much variation to try next time anyhow.\n\n It doesn't seem to have a clear identity:  On the one hand, you look in, and it looks like a nice restaurant.  But then when you go in, it seems like a takeout place with wine and a nicer seating area.  You order at the check stand, and then go to your seat.  There are only a few tables, and the prices are under $15, so I am guessing that they will not be able to make enough money to last long in that high rent district.\n\nUnless they reconsider and get some more choices I think that I will give it a \"Meh\".", "author": "Janet C."}

I usually always have leftovers at restaurants but I cleaned out my chicken bowl and found myself longing for more food.  I will say the white wine was really good so I didn't mind the $10.  All in all I would maybe go back if they upped their portions.  Other people in my group got the fries which was somewhere around $4 and the portion size was ridiculously small.  If fries are $4 you're thinking its a heaping bowl for a table to share.  Also everything was so a la carte I felt nickeled and dimed.
