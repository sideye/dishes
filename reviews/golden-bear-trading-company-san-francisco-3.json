How? Coffee is $3+baklava $2.50 and candy $6 plus taxes??!!!? Oh and no receipt was given for this transaction. Like a fool I didn't even insist.\nWait, it gets better.\nWhen we went inside around 4 pm the place had one customer/acquaintance sitting there with the owner, chatting. I asked if he has coffee or the place is shut? He mumbled something, got up and got busy behind the counter, I asked him to not brew a strong cup.\nNow when the coffee arrived, it was nothing but frothed milk (when I asked, he claimed that since I asked for light brew, he did light brew). But the so-called coffee was nothing but water with cream in it. I was sadly surprised that the man refused to do anything about it! (He laughed it off!) The baklava was good, but not $6-7 good, which Is what I think I paid extra !\nWhen we were leaving the man still yakking with his friend on top of his voice claimed that he has a lot of money, so much that he doesn't know what to do with it... like hundreds of thousands of dollars! Yup, if you serve people frothed cream with water and charge them $$$, you will make a s**t load of money and not know what to do with it! \nHere's my advice, remove the hyperbole from your walls and learn some manners!", "author": "Divya K."}

Don't expect the coffee you would usually expect. It's something completely different, but for some reason deep down inside, it hit the spot. He customizes and carefully takes care of his beans.

I've been living in SF for almost a year and I've been to my fair share of cafes up here and ALL OF THEM are lightyears better than this place. I have no idea how his guy got his place to have the \"#1 Coffee shop on Yelp.\" Sam is obnoxious and can be really rude. I got a vibe that he favors his older, male customers over his females ones. He walked around to the tables of his cafe, talking with his customers while I was in there and he didn't once stop by my table to say anything. \n\nI gave this place a second chance, and I'm never going back.

He immediately spoke to me as if we were friends, as if I've been coming to his craft coffee, wine-, beer-, and liquor- connoisseur's dream-of-a-place for a long time. Sam asked what happened to me. I don't know man. Did he recognize me from the one or two times I've been here? (The last time being last spring). Or maybe I look like a mess because I've been out and about all day running and working and studying. \n\nAfter this brief exchange as if we were buddies -- which btw, I appreciate it when I can walk into a place and feel right at home -- I ordered a large coffee with cream and sugar. Medium roast: Italian. The man himself ground up the beans, placed them into a pour-over filter, and started to make my coffee. We talked about how cold the weather has been and I mentioned that I felt like I was dying when I went running this morning. He was amazed and said my skin must be made of rubber! Sam finished off my coffee with some nice looking brown sugar and cream -- damn Gina this coffee is delicious! \n\nInside it is beautiful. Clean white walls, white counters and tables to sit at, and limited seating outside when it isn't freezing. The walls are lined with fridges full of some awesome BEERS! They got beers like Ballast Point here! Additionally there is an amazing selection of hard liquors AND A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF WINES THAT ARE PRICED RIGHT. Plus I'm sure Sam won't mind making a recommendation -- he just seems like that kind of guy.\n\n[Just as a side note for all you other folks that enjoy places like Philz -- this coffee is better. Cream and sugar but not too sweet like Philz and not too heavy due to their cream. Obviously this place is better than chains like Starbucks and Peets (don't get me started) and is very accessible to those that go to UCSF at Parnassus for any reason.]\n\nAll in all I will be coming back here. It's kind of out of the way for me but it is worth it. The owner, Sam, made me feel welcome and crafts a mean cup of coffee. He is charming and warm. He makes the Golden Bear feel charming and warm and fun. And he wants you to know. Ya'll are missing out if you haven't come here yet or haven't come back.

Sam is the O.G. of coffee around here.\n\nI'm all about the blended roasts here at the Golden Bear.  Very solid, chocolately flavors, with  no bitterness or acidity. Not sure how he does it, but there's some serious unicorn tears and fairy dust in the secret family recipe that keeps it coming out just right.  THIS is what coffee should taste like, and it's very consistent.  Been enjoying coffee here for years, and it's always roasted right.  \n\nTry the House Blend for a nice combo of medium and dark roasts.  The City Blend is a light/dark roast blend that's also interesting.  Or go for the Turkish for a solid cardamom-infused cup.  If you're into single origin, there are dozen or more available here. I always liked the Mexican, but Sam will tell you what the right one is -- just ask.\n\nOh, and if you want a latte... enjoy the Starbucks down the street.

I decline and say: \"No thank you, but I'm sure it's delicious.\" She persists and tells me it's homemade and delicious. I end up caving because she seemed so proud of it. She gives me a large piece and then I hand her $5. As she's ringing me up she tells me I need $3.15 more. $8.15 for a croissant and a piece of baklava?! Seemed a little pricey to me. \n\nDidn't really like the fact that she insisted that I purchase baklava. I understand that it's something she is very proud of, but I didn't really need it.\n\nThey had Kind bars that were $4, a tiny bag of regular cashews for $4, and the croissant must have been $5 at least and had been sitting out all day.\n\nMaybe there is something else about this place that has people raving.

I don't know if I agree at all.\n\nHere's my review: good coffee. Seems like a good selection of ice cream and wine. Service was ok to good. Clean restaurant. Hard to find parking. Average atmosphere, good prices. Smells clean.\n\nSee how average my review was? There's not really much to write this place. It's average.

Even with all the pomp and circumstance, Golden Bear was nearly empty on a Thursday afternoon for one of my final Yelp visits in my hometown of San Francisco before leaving for the East Coast (again). I'm glad Golden Bear was one of my final visits. \n\nIt was quiet and the space is perfect with all the fridges of craft beers and wines. Then you have your spirits artfully place on bookshelves essentially. The selection could get a little better, but I don't think people really come here as their local liquor store anyways. \n\nWhat they really come for is the coffee and pastries. The ambiance is truly one you look for in a coffee shop. Not one where you have lines everywhere and people bustling to get to their corporate America job. I'm sure the UCSF and local Sunset crowd loves a book and cup of Joe at Golden Bear.\n\nI had the Turkish black and it gave me the bitter kick I love in coffee. It was splendid. My mother had the Italian with some cream and sugar and absolutely loved it.\n\nAnyways, stop with the corporation coffee and the poseur \"local coffee shop now in 25 locations\". They all care about the bottom line in the end. Beans = cash to them.\n\nCome here. Come to Sam (sorry I didn't say hi, but thank you for a great final SF experience). They're just here for the love of the coffee. This is a bit off the beaten path, but this is it. I know it's just coffee and snacks, but it's just that done, oh so well.\n\nI can't say enough. It was all appropriately priced and placed. I'm glad I came here when I did and I'll definitely be back if I'm ever back in SF. Places like this deserve our business. Thank you Sam and Golden Bear.

Part of it is the idiosyncratic preparation: coffee is all ground ultra-fine in Turkish style and then made pour-over style in a repurposed diner rack using a basket coffee filter. Part of it is also the delightful woman who's been behind the counter every time I've been here. Heck, maybe part of it's also the balaclava.

She makes him a hot drink and he says \"Oh I wanted the cold brew mocha, isn't it a cold drink?\" She becomes argumentative and says she asked him if he wanted hot or cold and he told her hot. Now my bf is super polite with strangers but he's not a pushover. He says he didn't say that and said he wanted a COLD brew mocha, pointing at the menu and she ignores the menu and keeps pushing back, saying that he ordered the hot drink. Now that I think about it, perhaps it was supposed to be a hot drink made with their cold brew coffee but in all fairness the name is kind of confusing. However when the bf kept saying he wanted a cold drink, the lady accused him of lying, which is what irked me the most. It's like C'mon lady! Admit that there was a miscommunication and move on!\n\nAnother customer tries to give her the benefit of the doubt and says she's probably making it hot first and then she'll add ice cubes to make it cold. Nope, she grabs a pitcher of pre made stuff from the fridge and pours it out for my bf.... He just takes it because at this point, he just wants to move on and get to work. THEN she tries to get him to try the hot drink she made....We read those reviews of her charging for drinks she offers to customers to \"try\" so we were like No thank you. She offers the failed drink like 5 more times before giving up. Sheesh. \n\nI ordered a iced (I verified it with her) cold brew tea latte and it was pretty much 70% creamer, pre made iced tea from the fridge, and a spoonful of granulated sugar. Bleh.

We were perusing the menu on the wall with indecision for some time, and I asked him how the Cold Brew Mocha tasted. I'm not one to love mocha's to begin with because more often than not, they are much too chocolate-y and / or sweet. Without another word, Sam starts mixing chocolate powder with hot water, throws in a spoonful of turkish spices (I asked him, \"what's that?\" he says, \"just let me do my job\" ... it was cardamom, btw), pours in the cold brew and just a drop of heavy whipping cream. The way he crafted it made it seem like a work of art. It was calculated, careful, perfect. \n\nHe hands it to me and says \"try that.\" I really can't stress how tasty and full bodied this concoction was. You just need to try it for yourself. Very simple. We also got a Tanzanian medium roast drip coffee.

Went in after lunch and, since it was a first-time visit, asked for a recommendation for a dark roast. With zero hesitation Sam casually-yet-expertly made us an excellent cup of Mexican dark roast drip, black. And he wasn't lying either when he said that the coffee will taste even better when it cools down--hours later the coffee was still very much delicious (not merely/barely drinkable like the coffee from the other drip places). The chat was amusing as well, but I can see why his brand of humor might be off-putting for some people that have their undies in a perpetual wad. Sam is definitely a character--he would fit in perfectly as a recurring in Seinfeld episodes. If you can't handle that sort of humor your visit may not be as entertaining as ours was, in which case you might want to stick with the chains or that robot place.

Once again the Yelp app proved to be a esteemed guardian angel, delivering me from the commercial and the mediocre coffee shops to this heavenly perfection of fine roasted brewology.

My only regret is not staying closer to the Golden Bear Trading Co so that every morning could be extraordinary. \n\nWe walked into the shop and were enthusiastically greeted by Sam (the owner). I informed him of my request of the darkest boldest roast of his best Turkish blend to satisfy the toughest of critics. Sam went to work, a scoopful of beans into the grinder, a cup of perfectly heated water and to my amazement hand brewed right in front of my eyes. The presentation alone thrilled our tastebuds! Eagerly Sam & I watched my girlfriend savor the first taste of this masterpiece and without hesitation-perfection rolled off her tongue!!! Nothing makes me happier than satisfying my extremely picky girlfriend so well that she eagerly requested a second cup after devouring the first. A mocha for me and a savory pastry set me up perfectly to enjoy my mornings delight as we sat out front of the shop watching the clouds rush by this beautiful San Francisco landscape. \n\nSam is an amazing business owner and more people should strive to be like him. He is so sure of the quality of his coffee he said \"here try this and if you don't like it, it's free\". We spent that morning and the next morning getting to know Sam.

Once he talked me into buying one of his pastries. The pastry was clearly not fresh, though he of course claimed it was. He warmed it up in the microwave(which made it mushy). As I bit into it, he stood behind the counter and added adlibs to my eating experience: he kept saying \"mmmmm, isn't that good? Mmmmm yes. Best ever right? Mmmmm yeaaaaaaaahhhhhh\".\n\nI just get really bad vibes from him and he's the main reason I'm giving a bad review. I switch sides of the road when I approach his coffee house.

The amount of positive reviews he's gotten, in such a short period of time, is disproportionate for a small, average-quality coffee store, in a residential neighborhood far away from the city center.

I went there a few months ago after reading all the good reviews. The owner is out right creepy! When I asked him if I could use the bathroom, he said \"It's very special, right in my bedroom and will cost you $4000.\" I honestly wanted to run out of there, but politely ignored his comment, ordered a coffee and pastry, and sat down for a bit. He was also rude when I asked him what kind of coffee he had. He said \" I have over 40 different kinds of coffee, what are you talking about?\" He made me look stupid for just asking a simple question. He did tell me that I didn't have to pay if I didn't like the coffee. I think the coffee was ok- not the best I'v ever had, and I still paid. I trust my instincts, and I didn't get a very positive vibe from this guy, hence I didn't use the bathroom. Never again will I set foot here!", "author": "Saziya L."}

I personally am not a fan -- it's just not my style of coffee (I like soft espresso drinks like latte). I am giving a 1-star not because of their coffee. I don't like how the owner pushes people to like their coffee.\n\nWhen I went there the first time to try it out, the owner kept saying they have the best coffee in SF and said I don't have to pay if I didn't like it. I didn't like the coffee, but still paid and said the coffee was alright to the owner bc I didn't want to be rude.\n\nMy second visit was when I went there with a friend who wanted to try it out. I didn't want to order one for myself, because I knew it wasn't my style of coffee. When my friend ordered one and I didn't, the owner gave me an attitude and kept asking why I am not getting one when it's the best coffee in SF. I told him I tried it last time, and I didn't like it. The owner got furious and kept saying I should try it again and said that I don't need to pay if I didn't like it. I felt kinda forced to order one, so I did. I tried their cold brew again, and, as expected, I didn't like it just as my last experience. However, I didn't wanna say \"I'm not gonna pay, because you told me I don't need to pay if I don't like it\" so I still paid!! When I didn't like it and I knew I won't like it!! Anyways, that's my story. You may like the coffee, but I didn't. And I don't like the owner's cockiness and sorta rudeness.", "author": "Erika S."}

With my last final for the year approaching in less than one hour, I needed a strong coffee (and an excuse to leave my desk that I had been studying at for the past __ hours).  \n\nThe owner was chatting with a guest outside, but when he saw that I needed help, he came inside.  I ordered a coffee and he made it quickly.  He asked me if I wanted cream or sugar. I went with just cream.  The pour-over coffee was made very quickly and he had me taste it to make sure it was to my liking.  The coffee is flavorful and does not having any burnt/acidic taste at all.  It definitely gave me the caffeine buzz that I was looking for.  \n\nI asked for his recommendation on baklava and he suggested the pistachio.  It was very full of pistachios and pretty tasty, but a bit sweet overall for me (but I think this is just to be expected.)  It worked fine with the strong coffee.  The total came to $5.49 and the whole trip took less than 5 minutes; not bad at all.", "author": "Samantha L."}

He is clearly passionate about the quality of his offerings--and has good reason to be! \n\nWhile I'm no coffee connoisseur, I thought the iced coffee was good. The real star of the show, though, was the baklava. Golden Bear makes its baklava with whole pistachios, rather than chopped nuts. The pastry dough was light and flaky because it was drizzled--rather than drenched--with honey, which also allowed the flavor of the nuts to come through. \n\nI don't visit the Bay Area often, but I will definitely try to make it back here the next time I am in town.", "author": "Derrick H."}

And, per other reviews, I am not the only one. \n\nThis is not a direct review of the food or items, but a review of the person associated with this market. So here goes:\n\nI went to Sunset for: 1. A long-postponed haircut at Friendly Cuts, and 2. Some delicious pastry from Arizemendi's. As many would know, parking is really difficult in this neighborhood. I found a spacious parking spot in front of this place. \"I am so lucky!\" WRONG!!!\n\nI proceed to back up and park. I just about finish when I notice an old woman with a thick accent come out of her store and say \"let me see if you hit my car.\" WHAT?!!? akhftesdhfue!!! You have to be kidding me. I did not. I nicely smiled and told her that I didn't, because I really hadn't. She would know because her Market has windows spanning the entire place. She sat, literally, less than 15-20 feet away from her car (aka ~3.5 lengths of me, as I am not very tall). If I had hit her car, she should have seen a minor jolt, OR, heard a small sound, OR, BOTH, OR have seen my guilt-ridden sorry face. If she couldn't see a possible tap from that close, then she has got bigger problems. This woman proceeded to keep me there as she examined the previous/old inflicted scratches on her front bumper. Seriously, crazy.\n\n....After my errands, I walked to my car to drive away. I had not even gotten into my car before the old woman (who was again sitting by the window) stood up and purposefully watched me leave. As I left, I looked into my rear-view mirror and saw that another car had snatched a \"nice\" parking spot. I also noted that the old woman was keenly observing the other driver, perhaps ready to pounce on another victim. \n\nSeriously rude and accusative. I don't understand why anyone would come into this place when she is around. Doesn't she have better things to do, such as...run her shop?", "author": "Lily Z."}

And baklava\"\n\nMe: \"Are you out of bread or something?\"\n\nOwner: \"I just don't feel like making a sandwich. You should try the calzone, its home-made by my mother. Believe me, I wouldn't sell it if it wasn't the best\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, i guess I'll try a calzone and a turkish coffee, with cream and sugar please, and a pistachio baklava\"\n\n--A few minutes later, I saw him unwrap a calzone with a label that said \"Enzo's\" and had an ingredient label--\n\nMe: \"If the calzone's are 'fresh', why do they have a label that says Enzo's?\"\n\nOwner: \"You've just gotta believe, I'm gonna give you something that's good\"\n\nMe: \"Alright, I guess I'm pretty hungry\"\n\nThe coffee was ok- it was oily and lacked flavor. Honestly, it was on par with a cup of coffee you'd expect from Dunkin Donuts (I think the police could back me up here- I saw three different police officers stop in for coffee while I was there). \n\nThe food, though, was worse than expected. The pre-packaged calzone wasn't cooked properly- it was soggy, barely warm, and wasn't heated all the way through. The baklava had the dry consistency of cardboard, and about as many pistachios. \n\nTo make matters worse, the cup of coffee, piece of baklava, and calzone cost me almost $12. It was like polite robbery.\n\nI wanted so badly to love this place, and for it to become a regular stop for me, but that will not be case. Oddly, I can excuse the poor quality of the coffee and the food, and I probably would have gone back if that were all that is wrong with Golden Bear.\n\nIronically, my disappointment with Golden Bear is closely related to the very thing that seems to make people love it- the personal relationship. While I can excuse mediocre food and coffee, I can't excuse laziness and dishonesty in the owner. I don't care if he greets me when I walk in or if he sits down and makes small talk while I eat, there is no excuse for being too lazy to make a sandwich at a place that advertises sandwiches, and there is certainly no excuse for lying to a customer's face.", "author": "Zameer A."}

I've lived near UCSF for almost 3 years now and always see it when I walk pass it but never went in...since I'm moving away soon, I decided to give this place a try. I really like Philz coffee so wanted to see how their coffee compare to Philz. \n\nI actually really like their turkish coffee. The guy makes the drip coffee right after you order and asks if you want everything (cream/sugar). I had both cream and sugar and it tasted good, right balance of cream and sugar and not too sweet. The price is $3 dollars a cup, I would say it is pretty reasonable for what it is. I'd come back for more. It's a little bit less greasy and less sweet than Philz, I think I like both about equally. \n\nBefore coming in, I was reading reviews about the store and some people did complain about the service. From what I've read and what I experienced is that the type of service you get really depends on the guy's mood. He was not super friendly or didn't seem to care about me as a customer when I walked in the store (I said \"Hi\" and got no response). He was basically on the phone the whole time and barely paid much attention to me besides making my coffee and selling it to me.

I've once hung out here with a friend and had a good time talking to Sam for an extended period of time. I would totally recommend supporting Golden Bear Market, especially in a time when it seems like small, local businesses are dying out. \n\nThe turkish coffee is made single-cup drip using \"Cup of Love\" beans. You will always be assured that you're getting \"the best cup of coffee in the world\". Sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly drowsy or cloudy, I'm inclined to believe it. I usually take my coffee black, but the added cream and sugar really add a nice dimension to the coffee. It gives it this really pleasant nutty flavor and I would highly recommend it (if you can stifle your gasp at how much brown sugar he actually scoops in). \n\nTry to bring cash if possible.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-11", "description": "When I walked into Golden Bear this Monday morning, I saw the owner standing in the middle of the spotless shop peering out on the bustling, foggy city. As I entered he gently asked how I was today. We exchanged pleasantries as I walked up to the counter, and he behind it. I saw the many cambros of whole beans behind him as we worked together to decide which coffee would align with my tastes. We settled on the Jamaican Blue Mountain, the most expensive of the available varietals at $7 for a medium size. The owner introduced himself as Sam, as he guaranteed me that if the coffee did not meet or exceed my expectations, I would not even have to open my wallet. How could I refuse this honest offer? \n\nAnd so, as Sam went to work, I made my way around the perimeter of the shop, eyeing the impressive and varied selection of wine and high-quality liquors resting on the shelves. Some time later, Sam summoned me back to the counter, again promising me a beautiful experience, having prepared this cup to my specification. He handed me the cup over the protective glass, and as I took the sip he studied my reaction. The coffee rolled around smoothly in the mouth, and as I swallowed I felt as though I indeed experienced something special. Sam asked me to take my time imbibing, because \"when it's gone, it's gone\". And so I did, sitting down in the shop and enjoying the cup over the next hour or so, speaking with Sam about life between his responsibilities to his other customers. Sam even enjoyed a sample of the Jamaican with me, relating that he does not usually drink coffee--preferring tea--but finding occasion today to share an experience with me. \"It's gonna be a beautiful day,\" he said between joyful sips. \n\nPerhaps it was the coffee itself, perhaps if I isolated this cup and was sipping at home or in the park, I would feel the same. But I don't think so. As I see it, Sam is a master director, setting the stage for an amazing drinking experience, but also, more generally, an inspirational touch-down to reality, to the moment. Favorite quote from today was Sam sipping the Jamaican Blue, speaking in the third person: \"He's tasting his own love.\"", "author": "David A."}

So I walked up to the counter, looked at the menu board behind the counter, and after the nice guy behind the counter asked me what I would like, I ordered an egg croissant breakfast sandwich and a coffee.\n\nJust then, who pops out from a back room, chewing on something and wiping his hands? The obnoxious guy that runs the place (described in the paragraph above). And he yells out, \"We're out of croissant. We'll make it for you on a bagel!\" I don't want it on a bagel, so I say, nicely, \"That's ok. Thanks.\" And leave. He yells after me, \"What's wrong with bagel?!\" I didn't feel like debating the merits of croissant vs bagel and having him force a bagel eggwich on me, so I just kept walking.\n\nHere's an idea - you have an eraseable menu board... When you're out of something ERASE IT! I  had really high hopes that this place had changed, not only due to the remodel and change of items for sale, but because of the different staff (new normal guy) I was thinking maybe the owner finally caught a clue that their previous style of dealing with customers wasn't working, and was actually driving customers away. The obnoxious guy should let the nice, sane, normal guy deal with customers. Stay in the back room and continue to eat or whatever. I don't know who actually ENJOYS dealing with obnoxious, pushy, rude, cheap counter people, but I can assure that that doesn't fly in San Francisco. We prefer laid back, non-confrontational customer service. Have a good product, sell it for a reasonable price, and let sane people deal with the customers.\n\nI'd give it the lowest amount of stars, but I never got to taste the food, so here's an extra star just in case the food is so phenomenal, it makes up for all the crazy.\n\nSo I guess I'll keep giving my $10 a day to posh bagel. They are never out of croissants, they never yell weird stuff at me, they are nice, quiet, polite, and non-confrontational.", "author": "Zelda K."}

At first I went to an Indian restaurant but as soon as I opened the door, something told me to turn around. I have to say, it was probably good food at this restaurant because it was crowded but I just felt overwhelmed by all the people and energy. Then I went across the street to Golden Bear Market. I walked in, looked around, sighed and felt much more comfortable, and welcomed. One of the first things I saw were some baklava. I held myself back and said....wait...protein before sweets. \n\nI asked the man at the counter what his best sandwich was. He said, \"I'll make you a chicken sandwich. If you don't like it, don't pay for it.\" I thought....wow, that confident about what you make....I've gotta try it, nothing to lose! I said, \"OK, let's go for it.\" Then he added, \"you sit down and eat with me.\" Heck, sure why not! Best decision I made today. We talked and enjoyed the food.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was delicious. Tender chicken breast, fresh lettuce and the fixins' with some kickin' sauce. BUT I feel the secret ingredient in everything Sam creates is LOVE. (I agree with Ida M.) \n\nAfter the sandwich I had to treat myself. I asked for this \"best coffee ever\" of his and baklava. The coffee was definitely awesome. Usually I'd drown my coffee with cream and sugar, but this one didn't need all of that. You'd just ruin the flavor of the coffee. He crafted the coffee with the right amount of cream and sugar. First sip and I'm a believer. It was truly one of the best coffee I've ever had (and I'm a Peet's coffee-whore!) Then I took a bite of the baklava and it was an explosion of sweet goodness in my mouth. Baklava and coffee = best combo ever!\n\nYou MUST, MUST visit Golden Bear Market at least once if you're in SF.

They also sell wine and have a little convenience store section. I also like that they grind their coffee in front of you and have a wide variety of beans to choose from. HOWEVER, this place does not know how to make a simple cafe latte. I have been there twice and had two different servers, and they both just make a coffee with milk (not even cafe au lait). That is not a latte. A latte is made with 1-3 espresso shots and steamed milk (I like mine with soy milk) and foam on top. What these guys do is brew coffee and fill your cup 3/4 of the way with it and then add cold soy milk from the refrigerator on top. I remarked that I never saw a latte made that way and the guy said, \"we don't use machines here.\" Ok, fair enough, I can dig that...just don't pretend to make me a latte then. PLUS, one of the guys who seemed to be the owner came from outside and went straight to working on my \"latte\" WITHOUT washing his hands beforehand. His hands were all over the rims of the cup...I was kinda grossed out, but my years in the Peace Corps allow me to quickly excuse such offenses-but it was noted! I would give them one star, but they're nice, so they get an extra star for that.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

The owner caught my glimpse, and immediately began telling me how delicious their baklava was-- \"the finest I'd ever eat, home cooked by their family recipe!\". How could I say no to this? I bought their baklava and made my way further to the counter when passing by their \"Brici\"; the greek/turkish coffee maker. A simple glance at the Brici and the owner now began giving me a speech about how their coffee is the best in the world and incomparable to any coffee I'd ever had.  After a short chat with him, I found myself buying a cup of coffee at 9:15pm.  The owner told me I would be a lifetime customer after today, and insisted I tell all of my friends and family about this place. He told me he had done his part, and now it was time for me to do mine. I asked him how long his family had been working there, and he told me they take things \"one year at a time\" which confused me, but whatever! lol\n\nSo, all in all, it was a pretty humorous experience. I read other reviews about people getting convinced to buy more than they walked in for, and kind of laughed since that's what happened to me too. I felt kinda like I was at some Arabic hustlers trading post, and the zeal of him to recruit me as a lifetime customer was amusing as well. \n\nThe good news is that the coffee was EXCELLENT, and the baklava was good as well.  He did not lie, they are truly exceptional products and I will be back for a cup of their Turkish coffee and bring my friends to try it too.

The sign advertised 1800 tequila for sale and we pointed to the sign and she nods, then proceeds to take out the bigger bottle and charge us twice as much.\n3. When we asked her for the discount price and for the smaller sized bottle, she wagged her finger at us, basically insinuating that we were cheap college students and instead told us they were out of 1800 in that size and offered us two bottles of wine for four bucks.

He smiled and waved her off, handing her a clipboard to sign.  \"Thank you.  I love you.  See you next time,\" she called after him, as he jumped into his truck.\n\n\"Hiiiiiiiiii...\"  I'm always eloquent when ordering home made ethnic food of dubious provenance at liquor stores.  \"May I please have a pierogi?  One?\"  She rattled off a selection of fillings; I chose beef, which I think is what the Cadet had... She popped it in the microwave and nuked it for 45 seconds.  \n\nIt was a reasonable facsimile of the fresh out of the oven version from which I'd commandeered several large bites, despite the Cadet's objections.  I snagged a drink from the case, and got ready to pay for my impromptu midday nourishment.  \n\nI had $3, some lint, lip-gloss and a C-note in my pocket.  She leaned in and inspected my large-bill offering, then swept my hand aside and plucked the three dollar bills up in her fingers.  \"You come back next time, pay me - it's okay.  Maybe make it a double.  I love you!\" \n\nShe beamed and nodded, completely confident that I would sooner commit ritual suicide than betray the goodwill and effortless trust of a shop owner whom I'd never met before.  \n\nI ate half of my microwaved meat-filled bread puck, remembered that I had Prilosec in my purse, back at the office... and made a mental note to time it so that I could sample the freshly-made version again... which was soft, piping hot and pillowy.  \n\nI sat outside, shaded by the generosity of a stranger and the welcome half-shadow of the building itself, chewing vigorously and contemplating the odd innuendo of the street sign before me.  \n\nWhen in doubt, SPEED HUMP!!!", "author": "Kim D."}

I made a mental note to myself to check it out, as naturally I was intrigued. \n\nA couple of days later, I went to pick up some wine for a new years eve dinner party (I swear, Im not an alcoholic). When I walked in, the old woman was friendly enough, and didn't bother me while I perused the isles. \n\nWhen I had been standing in front of the wine shelves for several minutes trying to make up my mind, she came over and started harassing me about buying the wine that was on sale. She continued to shove the wine in my face for what felt like an hour, until I finally relented and agreed to purchase the wine. I begrudgingly stepped up to the register where she proceeded to INSIST on me purchasing a second bottle of sale wine at a \"special price\". I flat out refused four times but at the last minute before swiping my ATM card, she added the extra wine on my tab. By this point I was furious and vowed to never EVER again shop at the Golden Bear market.  \n\nDo yourself  a favor and boycott this market until the management figures out that she is driving away all potential business and puts us all out of our misery.", "author": "erin s."}

I used I be a big fan of philz coffee but it was little bit too far to drive.  So I decided to try Sam's cup of luv and I was hooked!  This Turkish coffee is lighter but full of flavors.  I don't know what he puts in there but it sure does taste amaziiiinnng!  Best coffee in sf!  Yelping at golden bear as I'm drinking this amazing cup of luv.", "author": "muti v."}

It's the best f-ing coffee in the world. Come back tomorrow and have some, if you don't believe me, I'll buy you lunch. Even people who don't drink coffee love my coffee.\" Intrigued, I decided I had no choice but to at least come back the following day and see if this was true or not.  I don't even like coffee, and let me tell you, this man was not lying.  His Turkish strong coffee made me a believer, and was just the push I needed to start my Saturday morning not being hungover.  I don't always drink coffee, but when I do, I prefer Golden Bear Market.", "author": "Giorgio L."}

Then, this man who introduced himeslf as Sam came up to me and asked if I could help move a few of the little metal shelves. I of course said, sure! So we moved these heavy ass shelves wiht like hella groceries on them. Then, he asked me to move more. and more. and more. and more. and more. We slowly rearranged the WHOLE FREAKING STORE. Being the submissive asian I am, I was hesitant to say anything because I was just in disbelief that SOMEONE WOULD ACTUALLY CON an innocent customer to do their dirty work. So after moving SEVERAL CASES OF WINE, the ODWALLA MACHINE and more shelves, I said... \"UMM, yeah I need to go now\". In the midst of all of this SAM would tell me \"I LIKE YOU, TIM\" \"YOURE A GOOD MAN, TIM\" and he'd also say some questionable things like \"YOU KNOW TIM, ALL THESE WOMEN DO IS CREATE PROBLEMS\" \"WOMEN ARE USELESS.\" He said this as his wife, the lady that usually runs the market store was standing by.... awkward. \nSo I think what happened was my dad called me and I said OMG HAVE TO GO BYE. SAM let me take something for free so I grabbed the closest thing to me, some big bottle of water and got the hell out of there. \ni didn't even get my milk! \n\nAnyways, another time, a couple friends and i went here to buy some tequila and limes. The sign for the 1800 was mismarked and we thought it was cheap, but then it wasn't and we were sad. and then she tried to sell us these like wrinkly lemons to pass off as limes. wtf. \n\nThe owner lady is interesting... she tries to be friendly but it just makes me uncomfortable. I would come here more often to pick up groceries (not produce...) but I dont want to get con-ed into rearranging the grocery store again. And shit there is expensive.", "author": "Tim B."}

The gentleman that runs the place does not sit there naked however he does take his shirt off and is in his shorts sitting outside the corner.   I work at UCSF and have to cross the corner store to get to the hospital.   I just think it is unprofessional to sit with your shirt off outside the store you work.

These guys and one woman fall into the latter. When i have actually ventured inside (which was a grave mistake) i was almost bullied into buying some way overpriced speakeasy beer and then mocked for thinking i knew where to get it cheaper (anywhere!) so i walked down the street to the also somewhat shady and overpriced liquor store on 8th and Judah. One time i also went in for a sandwich which were about a 6 out of 10 for me and the guy making it didnt use gloves after coming in from moving boxes and produce outside, he tried to ham it up with me when i was ordering to mask the fact that it was taking him way too long to toast the bread. All in all this place sucks and the workers love to harass people in the store and on the street alike, avoid the corner this is on (6th and Judah) at all costs!", "author": "Sean B."}

I came in with my pregnant friend (who had chosen not to find out the sex of her baby) and this woman says \"Is a boy... this my gift to you.\" Oddly enough she turned out to be right- not that my friend had the intention of knowing. And then there's yesterday. Fresh out of a procedure at UCSF hospital all I wanted was a 6 pack of Fat Tire, and Golden Bear is on my way home. When i get to the counter, she proceeds to pack the beer in a crumpled up used bag, and then I try to hand her my ID. She barely looks at it, looks at me and says \"no, i won't sell you the beer.\" On a previous occasion of beer buying she stared at my ID counting on her fingers, and I had to help her do the math to make sense of the fact that I am in fact 21 before overcharging me a ridiculous amount for it. Yesterday seriously irritated me, she flat out refused to sell me beer because she was unable to do simple math to figure out my age, apparently she thought that her powers of age deduction were more accurate then my California Drivers license. Well to avoid the hassle I will walk a couple blocks further out of my way to Roxy... bummer and bad for Golden Bear's business to lose customers because of something so basic and stupid.", "author": "Margot K."}
