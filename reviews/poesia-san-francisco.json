{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-14", "description": "The place is cute and small so reservations are definitely needed.  7:30pm and later, the noise level reaches a fever pitch so conversation is difficult.  The Staff are all friendly and charming, if not in a rush, but understandable since there are 4 of them to cover a packed restaurant.\n\nTheir bread is generic and cold, but the citrus-herb-olive oil dipping sauce is fresh and vibrant, so it makes up for the plain bread, (Helpful Tip: Spoon some of this dipping sauce over the many mounds of arugula you're about to get with your appetizers/meal).  Below is what I recommend:\n\nDefinitely Get:\n-A small Salami & Cheese plate, (Tagliere Salumi e Formaggi).  4 people can share easily or 2 really hungry people.  A good variety of fresh, thinly sliced meats and cheeses.\n\n-Pasta with Pork Tomato Sauce, (Fileji di Renato).  SO Good, and a good portion.  The pasta are these twisted cut ropes that you can tell is homemade and wonderfully chewy.  The pork tomato sauce has a good amount of tender pork pieces and the sauce tasted like it was cooked for a long time, so hearty and comforting.\n\n-Pasta with Lamb Tomato Sauce, (Fettucine al Ragu di Agnello): I don't eat lamb, but I'm sure it must be as good as the pork version.\n\n-Tiramisu:  The Yelp pictures show this in a dainty, shallow glass serving boat, but when we, a party of 4, ordered it, it came out as a larger short brick.  The lady fingers were still distinguishable, (not soggy), the cream was light with a dusting of cocoa/coffee powder & a taste of rum in every spoonful that wasn't overpowering.  I can see why another Yelper said this was the best he ever tasted.\n\n-Wine: For a party of 4, a bottle of red wine, (for less than 4 people, it makes more sense to order by the glass).  For those of us who aren't wine experts, faced with pages of white/red wines can be like playing wine roulette hoping you'd get a light, drinkable wine that won't distract from the food, (meaning not oaky/tanniny).  We lucked out, the waiter recommended a red wine from Sicily and it was perfect.  \n\nMaybe Get-Depends on you're craving/taste:\n-Steak salad, (Tagliata di Filetto di Manzo).  6-8, half inch by 2 1/2 inches of perfectly cooked and seasoned medium-but more rare, steak pieces surrounding a mountain of arugula sprinkled with faro.\n\n-Grilled Squid Salad, (Calamari alla Griglia).  I don't eat squidlies, but if you like just grilled squid, this is for you.  6-8 baby squid grilled surrounding a mountain of arugula.  I could smell the fresh grilled smokiness of my friend who ordered it beside me & it smelled good.\n\n-Whole fish in parchment paper, (Brazino al Cartoccio).  It was the whole fish, (without the head or tail as shown in some Yelp pictures).  Perfectly cooked with amazing cubes of potatoes that were crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside.  Only thing is all of it was bland, (another use of that citrus/herb bread dipping sauce!).\n\nDon't Get:\n-Toasted Bread slices topped with Artichoke hearts, (Crostini di Carciofi).  For $10 its 2 slices of plain, toasted bread with not enough moisture or artichoke hearts to stay on top of the bread.\n\n-Anything with homemade Ravioli, (usually a special).  Although the fact the ravioli is homemade is impressive, they didn't brown the butter sauce enough and there were only 2 small sage leaves buried in the dish somewhere.  They said the ravioli was filled with dark kale and 2 different kinds of cheeses, but you couldn't see or taste the cheeses because the kale conquered all.\n\n-Side of Vegetables, (Verdure al forno).  It was bland, over cooked and was late to our table, (to their credit it was taken off of the bill).\n\nI'll definitely come back, but it's good to know what to order & what to avoid.", "author": "Johnnie N."}

The fresh pasta was great, the complimentary pesto served with bread was great, and the marinated olives were pretty good. However, the ambiance was a little lackluster and they served warm wine. \n\nDrinks:\nUnfortunately my Cabernet was served unusually warm. This was probably due to it being a warm day, but that's no excuse to serve warm wine. My boyfriend got a negroni that was one of the better negronis I've had.\n\nAmbiance:\nIt was very dark, and I couldn't help but wonder if this was to hide the dinginess of the place. I would like to see Poesia throw the curtains open and have a clean and better lit space. If you can get a seat on their balcony, ignore this section.\n\nOlive Marinate:\nThese were pretty good for the small price paid. You can taste the citrus and they have fresh herbs sprinkled on them. \n\nOrecchiette con Purea di Fave e Pomodorini:\nThis dish was very interesting and has a lot of potential. Orecchiette is served over a good amount of pur\u00e9ed fava beans, which gives this vegetarian dish some substance. This is paired with Swiss chard and smoked ricotta - both giving the dish a very unique and earthy taste that was delicious. I think more salt may have been needed when cooking to make the chard pop a little bit more, but overall this was a good dish.\n\nFettuccine al Rag\u00fa di Agnello:\nThis was a great dish.

Unbelievably, among the traffic congestion and double parked cars, we found a legal parking space - directly in front of Poesia. Truly a miracle of Christmas!\n\nThe restaurant is upstairs. I did not see a lift anywhere, yet the single toilet is ADA compliant. This was once a residence. Interior is comfortable, though seating can be cramped. They chose to play a movie (sound off) on one wall. I had my back to it, others in our party did not seem distracted. \n\nService was better than most restaurants. Attire is casual. At 7pm on a Friday night, the place was packed. Wisely, we had a reservation and were seated immediately.\n\nThe ladies loved the Branzino bass. The Dattei dates added to the enjoyment of the meal. The Polenta e Funghi (mushrooms) was average. My Pasta Nera (calamari and shrimp noodles) was tasty, but overly spicy hot for my New England taste buds. The Tiramisu was gigantic while the chocolate mousse leaned towards smallish - both were delightful. Prices are to be expected.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-27", "description": "We enjoyed the food at Poesia.  It's a cute and cozy neighborhood restaurant.  But we had the unfortunate experience of being served by this waitress who was trying to rush us to order our food.  We wanted to take our time in checking out the full menu.  She asked us if we'd like to order drinks, which we did.  At that point, we also ordered our appetizers.  She insisted that we also order our entrees, which we were not quite ready to do.  But she did not have a smile on her face, and she seemed rushed.  Typically, a good wait staff person would let you order drinks and starters, and can come back to take your order for entrees.  But not this one.  She just wanted the whole order taken at the same time.\n\nWe had a $100 gift certificate.  Upon being seated, we asked her if there is to be remaining balance after our meal, would we be able to come back to finish the balance next time.  She told us yes.  But when we were all done, the manager came up and advised us that we did indeed have some balance remaining, and wanted to know if we would like to order more food or desserts - since we would NOT be able to use the remaining balanace at next meal.  Very disappointing.  If she had given us the correct information, we could have ordered accordingly and used up the entire $100.\n\nMy star rating is as follows:  4 star for the food; 2 star for service; so it averages out to a 3 star.", "author": "nardo m."}

Appetizer never came.  Entrees FINALLY arrived, after an exceptionally long wait.  I had the ravioli--ample portion and quite tasty.  Daughter had the gnocchi, and it was a very small portion.  I shared some of my ravioli with her.  Hubby got pork--and it had a bone in it!  Mind you, our appetizer never arrived, but we were charged for it. \n\nWhen we FINALLY received our bill, again after an exceptionally long wait, my husband pointed out the fact that we had never received our appetizer, and it was removed from our bill.  \n\nThere are too many great places to eat in San Francisco to spend so much time and so much $$$$ here.", "author": "Ruth C."}

Soon after we were seated, bread and olive oil were brought to the table. The bread was good but the olive oil was so harsh and bitter that it was completely inedible. Really horrible. We ordered arugula and fennel salad which came way over dressed and covered in what must have been the same olive oil. The salad was also inedible. The staff didn't even say anything or ask any questions when they took the plate away even though we hardly touched the salad. I ordered osso bucco which was served on top of risotto. My first bite was the risotto which was, without question, the saltiest thing I have ever been served in a restaurant. Completely inedible (unless, of course, I wanted to have a stroke right there in the restaurant). The veal tasted off, it had the taste it develops if it sits in the refrigerator too long. I was really looking forward to the bone marrow, but that too tasted off, the way it gets if it turns grey in the refrigerator.  One other gripe while we are at it. I really wish they would ditch that film they project onto one wall, it is really distracting if you are seated near it, which we were.", "author": "Lee D."}

Full of charm esp with the Italian waitstaff who were very friendly. I've been here twice and have to say they do some things great and some things that need improvement. I hope the management reads this as constructive criticism to help them improve, because I think they have potential for being a great restaurant and want them to stay in the neighborhood.\n\nPros\nCaprese Con Burrata - the Burrata was soft and delicious. The whole dish came together with the good quality olive oil, kalamata olives and the heirloom tomatoes. It helps that the heirlooms are in season. \n\nFettuccine al Regu Di Agnello - Delicious, well balanced sauce with fresh pasta.\n\nBranzino Alla Cartoccio - Only Italians and Chinese can appreciate eating a whole fish. Ha. My dining partner didn't like having eyes staring back at him. I thought the presentation was nice and the fish tasty and tender\n\nThe complimentary bread was tasty and warm. Served with olive oil and balsamic.\n\nCons:\nPollo Arrosto - Half roasted chicken served with lemon and thyme sauce and a side of soft polenta. The polenta was creamy and tasty, but the chicken was awful. After reading the description, I was expecting a chicken with crispy skin infused with thyme flavor; instead, I got a ugly dark green chicken that was dry and tough. Seems like they coated the chicken with a wet herbal coating and roasted it... way too long.\n\nWine - The pour here is stingy. A few sips and it was gone.

Damn, so hard to try new places in the Castro when there's just a great place you can always go to. \n\nCame here the first time with a friend and her bf. Got to try the tomato bread soup ( Pappa Al Pomodoro) - wasn't bad, but not great either. Kind of tasted like tomato bisque, but maybe not for everyone. I ended up ordering the pasta with pork ribs sugo (Fileji di Renato). Definitely really delicious. Small plate though so made me a bit sad that I couldn't try any the next day. Most of the time pasta sauce is better after you let it sit for a while. \n\nWe also ordered 2 desserts - they had only heard one of them, so we only got that dessert until we asked about it. No apologies for the mistake - only a little bit of blame on us. Regardless, we got the dark chocolate mousse (spuma di cioccolato) which was good except the sea salt grains were definitely a bit too large for the flavor they were trying to go for. Some of the bites were definitely too salty for a dessert. The other dessert - tiramisu - was delicious though. \n\nCame again on a Friday for happy hour. Happy hour ends at 6:30 rather than at 7 which is what my friend thought it was. They still gave us happy hour pricing - thanks! - since we were like a minute late. I ordered the Seduced and Abandoned - which was yummy! We also ordered the buratta with prosciutto and asparagus (burrata con prosciutto staginato e asparagi). Delicious. I'm glad that they also give us bread because the three together on some bread is so delicious. \n\nThird time here, on a date, Friday night. The dining table was packed We started with the ricotta gnocchi (gnocchi di ricotta con pomodorini). It was light and fluffy with a delicious sauce. Definitely one of those things you should get as an appetizer - super delicious. We ended up ordering the ravioli special and the fettuccine with lamb ragu (fettuccine al ragu' di agnello). Both of which are delicious. The special was definitely good, but I definitely enjoyed the lamb ragu more. \n\nOverall, this location has really good Italian food. Service is pretty decent, but not the best. So come here knowing that. \n\nProtip: get the gnocchi and the tiramisu. Both really good dishes.

Sitting in a window table with an uninterrupted view of the Midnight Sun, providing free entertainment of the comings and goings of the Castro bar dwellers. Mr. Server (with his multitude of bangle bracelets) was good, The food @ Poesia: \n\nBread and olive oil & balsamic vinegar - GOOD freshish Italianesque bread, ok/average olive oil & vinegar\n\nCarpaccio - GREAT: 3 Mini towers of carpaccio wrapped around greens with erect enoki mushrooms spouting out of the top, a culinary construction in deference to the locale ? \n\nDandelion greens - BICKY (see above): overcooked - mushy with less flavor than a boiled stick. Shoulda sent it back but didn't want an Italian retribution appearing in subsequent dishes \n\nFried Calamari: OK: mostly a salad mound with a few (maybe 6) smallish pieces of calamari. This was a surprise since many pic's of this dish show a mound of Calamari.\n\nFilet Mignon - GOOD: Tasty & properly cooked medium rare, sliced with plenty of the omnipresent small greens\n\nLamb shank pasta - OK: Pasta properly cooked, meat was shredded on top. Wondered where the other 80% of the shank was. Tasty but skimpy. Maybe this lamb shank was from a very, very skinny lamb\n\nFish (Branzino?) cooked in parchment - BICKY: Overcooked - mushy, it was obvious that the parchment was more a gimmick than integral to how the fish was cooked. It was deboned which helped with picking the mushy meat. \n\nDesert: GOOD - : Ice cream w/ a shot of espresso, with the serving embellishment of having the espresso poured on the ice cream at our table. \n\nTL;DR:\n\nThe environment is a Victorian or Edwardian house converted to its present restaurant scheme. Its vibe is (as many have) described is homey. While \"homey\", the only resemblance to its architectural heritage is the peaked ceiling. Any other recognizable interior que of the buildings heritage was erased with sheet rock decades ago. Its kind of like the guy who fills in his lawn area with cement and paints it green. A \"chandelier\" near our table, appearing to be a hand moulded creation that looked as if it was made out of reddish playdough by someone with too much contact with lead. Maybe the dough part is meant to carry forward the Poetic culinary theme? It takes more than Italian names for dishes to make them delicious. The cocktail attraction & promotion & deals certainly contribute to the Positive Poesia experience for many of LOCAL Castro fawning fans. Bartenders are a natural FAV in this neighborhood.

We were in the area, and decided to check out the menu.  We had eaten earlier, and weren't hungry.  We just wanted to see what Poesia had to offer.  Little did we know we barely made it for happy hour.  The host was so welcoming, so we decided to stay.\n\nWe ordered the \"rustico\" and the \"pappa al pomodoro.\"  The rustico is a puff pastry filled with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese.  The pappa al pomodoro is tomato bread soup.  The puff pastry was a bit burnt, but so delicious! It was especially good with the soup.  I would order the soup again because the tomatoes were bursting with flavor and the bread went well with the overall texture of the soup.\n\nWe also ordered drinks.  I got the Juliet of the Spirits that had vodka, St. Germain, lavender syrup, and tiny pieces of lavender on top.  My roommate ordered La Dolce Vita which had bourbon (her favorite), Di Saronno, and citrus juice.  Mine was so aromatic and sweet.  I can't say much about hers.  I did try it, but I'm not a bourbon fan.  I will say that she really enjoyed hers.\n\nThe bartender who served us was really friendly.  And the host checked in on us, and again, so welcoming.\n\nThe decor is really romantic, especially with the black and white movies playing against the back wall.  I felt like I was back in Italy again with the good food, friendly staff, and energetic atmosphere.", "author": "Vira P."}

With the black & white Italian movie playing in the background, a fantastically friendly waiter (from reading previous Yelp reviews, seems like they are trying to make up for past experiences), and a $60 three course dinner + wine deal for two from LivingSocial, we had a really nice little date. Not outstanding enough to necessarily come back considering the endless restaurants in SF we haven't tried yet, but nice enough to recommend it for a decently romantic spot.\n\nMUST-HAVE: Fettuccine al Ragu\n\n~~ANTIPASTI~~\n* Gnocchi Silani - 3.5 stars\n(Ricotta Cheese Gnocchi, Citrus Sauce, Pachino Tomatoes. $10)\nVery chew, soft, well made gnocchi. The citrus sauce was a tiny bit strong, and that in combination withe tangy juice from the tomatoes made the dish less savory and more sour. The slices of tomatoes themselves were fantastic, perfectly ripe, almost sweet.\n\n* Tortino di Baccala di Nonna MariaRosa - 3.5 stars\n(Salted Cod cake baked in the oven with potato puree. $11)\nNicely done. The cod had great texture, as did the potato puree. A little bland flavor-wise though.\n\n~~PASTA~~\n* Fettuccine al Ragu d'Agnello - 4 stars\n(Lamb Shank  Ragu', Tomato Sauce. $16)\nThe house made fettuccine was really great. FYI it is thicker (though also variable, so you can tell it's made in house) and on the al dente side. The sauce had a nice tangy flavor that balanced well with the gamey flavor of the lamb. Speaking of the lamb, it was tender and tasty. \n\n* Pollo alla Griglia con Salsa Piccante - 4 stars\n(Free Range Half Chicken, Lemon & Peperoncino Calabrese Sauce, Broccoli di Ciccio, Roasted Potatoes. $19)\nWhile the chicken was a tiny bit on the dry side, it was flavored so well with many spices and herbs that made it smell (and taste) delicious. It had a great crispy skin as well. The potato was really good, also with a nice crisp and well flavored, and the greens were slightly bitter which balanced everything else out really well.\n\n~~DOLCI~~ \n* Zabaione al Marsala con Sbrisolona e Gelato - 2 stars\n(Light Marsala wine custard with Almond short dough and Chocolate Gelato. $8)\nVery disappointing (we should've listened to our waiter who was kind of pushing for the other dessert). The custard had too strong of a coffee flavor, even for my boyfriend the coffee lover. The almond dough were incredibly hard and not fun to chew or try to break apart.\n\n* Spuma di Cioccolata - 3.5 stars\n(Dark Chocolate mousse, Sea Salt, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Chile Powder. $8)\nThe dark chocolate was really nice. You have to balance out each bite to get the right amount of salt, olive oil, and chile to get the flavor right. It's just missing some variation in texture - you really only get the soft texture of the chocolate.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

My Jamie W. ordered the $17 Fettuccine al Ragu', which sounded tempting since it came in a tomato sauce with slow-braised lamb shank (see photo). It was tasty enough but not terribly tantalizing. Mine was better, the $18 Ravioli al Granchio, about five reasonably-sized rounds stuffed with an unlikely mix of crab meat and smoked Pancetta and covered in a brandy sauce (see photo). \n\nOur starter was a simple $9 Insalata di Barbabietol, which combined diced golden and red beets with radish and goat cheese (see photo). Good, sweet and rather predictable. I was worried the place would be cramped since it is in what looks to be the parlor of a converted Victorian. But it wasn't that bad. Relatively low-key considering all the tables were full up. The service was attentive, but I have to admit that inedible baguette at the beginning really haunted my whole meal.

Everyone already left good recommendations so just a few more besides the obvious great tender calamari and pasta dishes, the wines are perfectly hand selected, straight forward, reasonable parameter from wine regions of Italy and most importantly conscientious on their price point to leaving room for perhaps getting bottle or two if you're celebrating with friends. Francesco and team had made an establishment so exquisitely genuine, one will be reminded of being with family.

I'm a vegetarian, and there were plenty of options.  One thing I loved about was that the server directed me with confidence.  When I narrowed down my choices, he did not hesitate to steer me in one direction over another.\n\nI started with the Parmigiana di Melanzane (eggplant parmasean).  This wasn't ordinary eggplant parm, smoothered in cheese and riddled with sauce.  Rather, it was subtle.  There was sauce, and there was cheese but not a lot.  It was incredible.  The sauce was thick and tart, and the crispiness of the eggplant complimented the sauce perfectly.  Outstanding.\n\nFor my entree, I had the Mezzelune di Zaffferano con Taleggio e Funghi, which was a ravioli stuffed with walnuts and Taleggio cheese.  Delicate and delicious.  The saffron sauce was perfectly balanced -- not too heavy or too creamy.  I believe there were only five raviolis with the entree, with which at first, I was disappointed.  That said, I was satisfied by the end of the meal, and with the appetizer and the bread and the glass of Proseco, it was sufficient.  \n\nMy friends ordered meat and seafood dishes.  I'm a strict vegetarian; I don't eat fish or fish stocks (and wouldn't share a gnocchi dish with mussels, for instance).  I'm embarrassed to say that I can't remember what my friends had because I was too busy enraptured with the poetry of my own plates.\n\nThe food was wonderful.  They do accommodate vegans as well and Poesia seemed to strive to make everyone feel comfortable.  A great place to splurge.  A great place to celebrate.  \n\nCozy interior.  It's not big.

It was really good - very bright and fresh flavors.  My wife and I split a Beet Salad.  She had the Filet Mignon Ravioli w/ Lobster Mushroom Sauce.  She loved it!  I had the Oreccheitte Alla Calabrese, coin shaped pasta basked in the oven with 'Nduja Sausage, Porcini Mushrooms and Provolone.  It was superb.

The owner, Francesco, and staff, especially Marney and Alex, are friendly and attentive, and the food is amazing. Ask them what to order, and they will deliver you one of the best dining experiences you have ever had. \n\nI recommend starting with the Swept Away cocktail and getting the Calamari Alla Griglia as an appetizer. Until I came to Poesia, I did not care for calamari, but this is the best I have ever had (My mouth is watering just thinking about it!). It is delicious; you can taste the smokiness of the grilled preparation, along with the tenderness of the calamari. From there, I leave it in the hands of Francesco; whatever he suggests I am ordering. \n\nMy friends and I first dined here on Christmas Eve, and I got the lobster and pasta, and when I was there last month, I got the crab and squid ink fettucine. Both were amazing. I also tried, at Francesco's suggestion, the Spuma di Cioccolato, a chocolate mousse with sea salt flakes so decadent, that I wanted the serving dish to be bottomless. \n\nWhat impresses me most about this restaurant is that no detail goes unnoticed. You do not have to ask for more water, another drink, or for your plates to be cleared. In a small space, a magical orchestra unfolds with each staff member playing their part to perfection. It is impressive, and each time I eat here, I feel like I have been invited to a friend's house.

More substantial and interesting than just with tomatoes and the fig jam gives it a slightly sweet touch that compliments perfectly.\n-- Gnocchi ( In a sauce of orange juice and cherry tomatoes) again, the combo was so great we were using slices of the table bread to lap up the remaining sauce \n\nMain\n-- FILEJI DI RENATO ( tube pasta with pork ragu) really great. If you want comfort food in the form of warm pasta with thick tomatoe sauce topped with Parmesan cheese, this is the dish for you.\n-- TAGLIATA DI FILETTO DI MANZO CON INSALATINA DI RUCOLA E FARRO ( filet mignon with arugula and farro salad) this dish was pleasantly light. If you are looking for a leaner/ paleo- option that will not weigh you down, this is your dish.\n\nSides\n-- CAVOLFIORI AL FORNO (cauliflower ) do yourself a favor and order this dish... Even if you don't like cauliflower!! Best I have ever tasted\n\nDessert\n--  TIRAMISU ( of course!) You will not be disappointed\n--CANNOLO, I am not a huge fan of cannolis but this I liked. I am also not particularly fond of citrus in desserts and it did have an orange flavoring in the filling which I could have done without, but my bf loved it and I found myself going back for more bites than I anticipated\n-- Cappuccino (perfectly balanced and a nice end to the meal). I am a coffee drinker and I enjoyed it\n\nOnly cons: time to receive food and noise level\n\nSummary \nThis is a quaint restaurant in an old Victorian and it can be a really romantic spot especially if you get a table close to the window. The noise level can also get a bit high if there any large groups dining ( on my night there were three). The only real downside to the experience was that the service time was SO SLOW! Our waitress was pleasant and water was refilled timely and dishes removed, but the time it took to get each course was double the time you would expect and the restaurant was not full. Unsure if they were short staffed in the kitchen, but we went through 2 baskets of bread because our food was taking so long and we were starving.

Despite occasional highs, the lows are too frequent and too low to give this overpriced neighborhood joint your hard-earned dining dollars.\n\nThe inconsistent service and cuisine at this restaurant do not support its aggressive pricing, which is amplified by an irritating, European-style cover charge for bread - \"and the tablecloth,\" as the owner subsequently explained - that is not disclosed until you get the final bill. \n\nWhile the so-called \"covert\" fee is only $1 per guest, it is superfluous for a so-so restaurant charging the better part of $20 for tiny servings of nearly inedible pasta (as discussed more fully below) and the better part of $30 for its protein-based secondi.   \n \nThings started off on a high note with the grilled calamari appetizer and a shared plate of beet ravioli that tasted better, and more subtle, than you would think. But things then started to fall apart. \n\nThere was a l-o-n-g, l-o-n-g, uncomfortably l-o-n-g wait for the main courses. When they arrived, they were not up to expectations.  \n\nWhile the baked branzino was workmanlike, the fish was not nearly as moist and flavorful as preparations experienced in numerous other restaurants or even our humble home kitchen. The pal who rapidly gobbled down the creamy crab pasta special reported it to be delicious. \n\nIn our foursome, I drew the losing hand by ordering the squid-ink gnocchi with shrimp. Presented with exactly two (2) shrimp, my first bite of the waterlogged gnocchi was absolutely icy. When I looked around for someone to take the dish back to the kitchen for further attention, no server could be found. Sampling another bite, I found the balance of the pasta warm enough to consume, though it tasted musky and dull. When I finally flagged down a busboy to fetch some salt and pepper to try to fix it up, even additional seasoning could not mask the unpleasant taste.\n\nIf it hadn't taken so long to get dinner and if I had been able to find a server on the floor on a timely basis, I would have sent the dish back as a FAIL. Absent these alternatives, I took one for the team and ate as much of the glop as I could. When I finally had an opportunity to courteously bring these issues to the attention of the owner, he seemed neither interested nor apologetic.   \n\nSo, here's my advice, Mr. Owner: If you are going to be as pretentious and greedy as to impose a cover charge on top of your aggressively priced menu, then the consistency and the quality of the food and service ought to back up your conceit.\n\nMy advice to everyone else is: You can do better than this place.", "author": "Alan M."}

They took note of the message I'd left regarding the birthdays, and although I didn't prompt them, the staff acknowledged both my mother and husband and helped us celebrate. The seating area was perfect as it allowed for some privacy, and we didn't have to shout across the table to hear one another.

The space is very comfortable and welcoming like you are dining in someones living room rather than a full service restaurant just a block off Castro. The service was great because someone always came to check on us even though they were busy, but we never felt hurried to order or leave.\n\nThe Bruschetta di Goffredo appetizer was a bit underwhelming and is probably not something that I would reorder, however, the Calamari Salad was delicious - grilled, fresh and not overdressed so the protein spoke for itself. The ravioli dish I had was the highlight though. This is not something I normally order but I would definitely do so again if I came back to Poesia.\n\nOverall a great dinner experience. It is not the best Italian food that I have ever had but did not disappoint at all, and the overall dining experience was pleasant and memorable.", "author": "Frank J."}

It was 5 years ago that I wrote a review of it, and I'm glad they've made a go of this space.\n\nThe service was the huge problem last night. We had a reservation and had to wait a half hour past the reservation time for our table. I know this isn't always in the control of the restaurant, but simply leaving you in the very small doorway (the bar was too crowded to sit and have a glass of wine) isn't really very pleasant. And half an hour is really inexcusable.\n\nThen it took a long time for the waiter to take our order, and after the plates were cleared away from our starters, it took close to 45 minutes for our main dishes to come out. By that time there was hardly anyone else in the place and we couldn't figure out what was going on. None of our dishes were very complicated, but it apparently takes 45 minutes to cook ravioli and risotto.\n\nThe waiter rarely bothered to check on us, he and his compatriots were too busy setting the other tables up for the next day and ignoring the customers they had at that moment.\n\nFrankly, the so-so food wasn't really the problem. Nothing was terrible but it was all missing something small (heat, salt). The best things was the beet salad, and also the soup with favas, fresh peas and calamari. \n\nBut there's just no excuse for service that terrible. I very much doubt we'll be back here.", "author": "Mike F."}

I would have given them four stars. However, I went back just a few weeks ago and I was pretty disappointed.\n\nThe caprese salad and eggplant parmesan were great appetizers, but it took at least 40 minutes for our food to arrive after that. Our waiter made no effort to acknowledge the long wait by bringing us some bread or just simply apologizing. But, that's not why I'm taking away one star.\nYou would think that being so hungry I would think that any dish would taste good, but I didn't. I ordered the special, which was ravioli stuffed with beets and ricotta. The pasta was thick and rubbery. I also had the chance to try the baked fish, which was so under seasoned that we could hardly eat it. But we didn't skip out on dessert! I had the meringue which just felt like I was eating a block of sugar, topped off with whipped cream. No complaints on the taste but they should make it worth the money or just take it off the menu.", "author": "Natalie P."}

The service from our very attentive and polished waiter, Alex, was outstanding throughout the whole evening.  We skipped the cocktails and went straight to the wine list, which had a lot of interesting, reasonably priced choices.  The bread, spiced with a hint of pepper, was also unique and very good.  For appetizers, we had the eggplant parmesan and beet salad, both of which were well proportioned and delicious.  All in all, a promising start to the evening.\n\nThen came the mains...My friend had the fettuccine with shredded lamb shank, and I had the seafood risotto with scallops and mussels.  Both were beautifully presented, and after a great start to the meal, we could barely wait to dig into our food.  Unfortunately, both of our mains were a total disappointment.  Although both the pasta and rice were cooked perfectly, and both had generous portions of either lamb or mussels and scallops, we found both of our options to be incredibly bland and lacking in any depth and complexity of flavour.  \n\nAlso, the restaurant is small and intimate.  At the start of the meal, it was fine, but after the restaurant filled up, it got incredibly warm, to the point where both of us were sweating profusely by the end of the main course.  We ended up skipping dessert and going elsewhere.  \n\nUnfortunately, by the end of the night, what had potential to be an outstanding meal ended up being a pretty average experience.  Given the endless options in the city, I'll probably pass on a repeat of this place.", "author": "Allan T."}

Hubby concurred.\n\nHubby's grandparents enjoyed the delicious daily special arugula and mascarpone salads as appetizers as well as braised lamb (which hubby's grandpapa found yummy and tender) and another daily special, beet ravioli (which hubby's grandmama found delicious as well, sweet but not too sweet).

One of the staff members, possibly the manager (because he was in a fancy suit) also graced us with a free third dessert, a pear poached in red wine filled with vanilla custard.

The service was great from the moment I walked in alone and remained so, even though the restaurant steadily filled up to capacity. \nMy husband started with the Carpaccio antipasti; I had the roasted duck bruschetta. Oh. My. God. I can't tell you which was better. \nWe then ordered the meals....we were both very happy to see a few choices of either half or full orders. So we both got half orders--I got the lamb shank ragu over fettucini, and my husband ordered the farfalle pasta with fresh sardines. I dislike sardines so didn't really care for his, though I can tell it was good anyway. Plus he said it was good.

Sorry that I don't feel like having wine today, am not super hungry, and am trying to eat healthier by not over-ordering!\n\nThis place is definitely not $$$ if you're just getting pasta (especially half portion) and an appetizer. Entrees start at ~$20 (and ~half that for a half portion of pasta). But I guess it adds up if you get all 4 courses and wine!", "author": "Amy X."}

Overall, the service was HORRIBLE and everything was over-priced for the quality and amount of food. Their main problem is that the owner thinks he can handle everything himself. We stood at the door waiting to be seated for over 15 minutes (we had a reservation) when there were numerous empty tables and a few \"servers\" standing around doing nothing. I put \"servers' in quotes, because the owner barely let either of them touch a plate, check presenter, or seat any customers. They basically filled our water and cleared our plates, but otherwise were not allowed to do anything at the restaurant. Not a single female was employed here, which we also thought was odd. We could tell after standing by the door for 5 minutes that this place runs poorly because the owner tries to act like a big shot and do everything himself. We considered leaving, and I really wish we had.  We literally waited 20 minutes to even order drinks, which came out AFTER our food. No one came by once to ask how our food was or see if we needed anything. We sat there for at least 20 more minutes after we finished eating before anyone cleared our plates... We sat for another 30 minutes before getting our check, which we had to ask for. \nIn general, we felt dismissed by the owner- maybe because we are young-looking, or maybe because we have tattoos. We were dressed very nicely, acted very polite, and did nothing to deserve the owner's smug demeanor. If you're in San Francisco and want homemade italian food, please eat ANYWHERE ELSE!

Probably since from the looks of it, it was converted from a house.  \n\nAs one of our apps, we ordered the filet carpaccio, which came on a bed of and wrapped around arugula salad.  Firstly, it came with very little of the citrusy/vinegary sauce that usually compliments this dish.  Then the filet wasn't cut thinly enough where it felt as tho I was chewing on meat gum.  And I'm sure as many people have, after chewing and chewing and chewing, trying every teeth to grind the sucker down with no luck, I decided to swallow the gristly chunk instead of spitting it out into my napkin.  \n\nThe other app, grilled squid, on a bed of arugula again, was actually quite good.  Probably one of the better grilled squids that I've had.  Perfectly cooked to the point that is neither under-cooked mushy or over-cooked rubbery with a nice smoking grilled flavor rather than burnt bitterness.  The citrusy sauce, which seems similar to the one that came with the carpaccio, complimented it well.  \n\nAs one of our entrees, we ordered the filet, which to our surprise, came on a bed of arugula, again.  I guess we didn't read the menu carefully enough to notice that we had signed up for an arugula colon cleansing.  I don't recall the salad saying specifically that it was arugula.  I could be wrong.  Again, it came with a very similar, if not the same, citrusy sauce as the first two dishes.  Perhaps, if this was the only dish that came with it, then I could tolerate it but given all 3 came on a bed of citrusy arugula, it was hard to bare.  Even though we ordered it medium, it was quite dry and it needed some sort of a reduction sauce.   \n\nThe red snapper ravioli in asparagus sauce dish was quite good but had only 4 pieces.  My friend said that the pasta was under cooked on her first piece.  Mine seemed ok.\n\nThe desserts were good, although the tiramisu didn't quite taste like a real one.  Maybe because it was missing too many of its signature ingredients - coffee/espresso & liquor?  \n\nThe service from our friendly waiter was decent.  \n\nI would give this restaurant a 3 star rating had it not been for what had happened AFTER our dining experience.  We couldn't quite finish the filet and the third course of arugula, so we asked for it to go.  one of the waiters took the dish to the back to, I assume, box & bag it.  Normally I expect the restaurant to bring it to the table.  Because we were focused on our conversation, after the bill had come, we left the restaurant.  After having driven far quite far, we realized that they had not given us the togo box.  \n\nInstead of turning back for our arugula and the filet, I decided to call the restaurant to bring up the matter after getting home. When I did, the attitude that the manager had was basically, 'what do you want me to do about it?  It's just as much your fault as it is ours.  You should not have forgotten.'  I am all about being fair and only raising an issue when I feel that it's due.  Had they brought the box to me and then I had forgotten it on the table, then yes, I accept the fault as my own.  Even if the manager's excuse was true that they do not want to bring the box to the table and would prefer to give it to the customers as they leave, then it should be their duty to remember to do so, not the customers.\n\nRestaurants should remember that they are just as much a service business.

Poesia has a nice website, but the food! Mamma mia (in a bad way)!\n\nI really wanted to like Poesia because it was my best friend's birthday. Unfortunately, I had the squid ink pasta. Imagine something bad masked by something equally bad and you have salt cod in tomato sauce. I like squid ink pasta, salt cod, and tomato sauce individually but together they're an inedible science experiment.\n\nI also ordered the mussels and tried the ricotta gnocchi. The mussels were ok, but I've never had bad mussels. The gnocchi was delicious, especially was its citrus sauce.

This is a well loved restaurant. We made reservations for 7pm and were warmly greeted before being seated. We started with the Calamari alla Griglia and the Antipasto Rustico Calabrese. The calamari was perfection. The flavor integrity of the squid was not compromised by generic beading. It was grilled beautifully, not over done and was tender and delicious. The salad that came with the calamari complimented very well. The antipasto contained a Italian cured ham that melts in your mouth. Dinner standouts were the Fileji di Renato, a house made Calabrese spiral shaped pasta with pork ribs sugo in roasted garlic tomato sauce.

We arrived just past our 8:45pm reservation, and it was clear that had we arrived on time we would not have been seated immediately anyways. So it took about 15 minutes to get our table (why even take a reservation?)\n\nService was pretty slow. From getting water, drinks, bread, taking our order, etc. But whatever, we can over look some of that.\n\nFor apps we ordered the burratta cheese and the gnocci.  I wish I could review the burratta, because about 15 minutes later he came and told me they were out of it. Which is really bad.  I mean as a server you should know what you have and what you dont.  So we ordered the carpaccio instead. About another 15 minutes later it arrived.  The gnocci was pretty fantastic (the only redeeming thing about the night) the carpaccio was good... but not amazing. \n\nFood was not flying out of the kitchen, even though they were pretty busy. It took about 25 minutes or so for our next course. I mean come on... its pasta.. no pasta takes that long to boil.\n\nI got the squid ink ravioli with crab meat and pesto.  It was above average, but VERY small.  4 raviolis does not make a meal. My husband got the seafood spaghetti. This was the goldilocks seafood.  The shrimp were overcooked (way rubbery).  The mussels were under cooked (two of the four were not opened) Thats just BAD to send that out of the kitchen.  The chef should be embarrassed that was sent out, and the clams were good.  The spaghetti was sub-par.\n\nThe waiter never came to check on our first couple of bites (thats just standard service) and we were never offered parma cheese for our pasta, even though every table around us was offered it when their food was dropped off.\n\nAt this point we just wanted out, it was almost an hour and a half of eating very little food, with very poor service.  It was just inattentive. I had my credit card out for like 5 minutes to pay, and he offered to bring the bill, I was like \"no please just run it\".\n\nI NEVER leave a bad tip, but I thought 8% was pretty generous, looking back I wish I could take some of the tip away. And the sad thing is that he probably didn't realize why his tip was so low.  As we left, no good byes from the waiter, manager, hostess, it was just bad.  I would give 0 stars if you could. Over an hour and a half for Italian food?  there is a difference between slow paced service and SLOW service\n\nGreat location, cute decor, but horrible service and mediocre food.", "author": "David P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-18", "description": "This review assesses the diner's ability to stay paleo at Poesia. If you're not doin' the Paleo and not even interested in trying it, you'll get little out of the following.\n\nThough half of Poesia's dishes contain dairy and nightshades and you have to turn down the bread, Francisco does a ton right from the Paleo perspective: first, he doesn't fry many entrees, but what he does fry up he fries up in palm oil. This is almost unheard of in San Francisco--despite the health and food cultures here, most places fry everything in PUFA oils at best, trans-fatty partially hydrogenated vegetable oils at worst. (Rice Bran Oil, hugely inflammatory to the joints, is becoming standard operating procedure thanks to vegan influence.) Not here.\n\nNotes: 'Arancino' (pronounced with a \"chino\") is a ball of rice and provolone, breaded and fried, and Poesia serves it. Oh, and the cod cakes use potato as a thickener--not dairy or gluten. Not even a problem for Paleo 2.0/Archevore. That's pretty much it. Francesco and his staff will mod your meals to exclude what you don't want without complaint, so if you want to stay strict paleo, you can. It's pretty easy because the meals seem to have sort of a healthy-meats-and-fats base already. For instance: Francesco's 'Lemon's House Dressing' is olive oil, lemon juice, red onion and chilis. If you go Primal and do the cheese, nobody can guarantee it's all grass-fed. But it's at least from mostly Italian or Californian sources.\n\nThe assessments I got:\nThe Mugellano cheese (usually made from sheep's milk) is imported from Mugello, Italy, and 3 weeks old. It's at least partially grass-fed.\n\nHis Goat cheese is from Sonoma: could well be grain-fed, it turns out.\n\nHis burrata's from Southern California, so it's either Di Stefano or Gioia, which both disclose nothing about animal-feeding practices. Have to assume grain-fed.\n\nHis Compagna cheese is from Compagna, Italy. Again--taking chances with grain and legume content from the buffalos' diets, but it's likely to be grass-fed.\n\nHis ricotta and parmesan: Unknown. Finally, I'll link you to a guide to Italian cheeses: http://www.italfoodsinc.com/images/cataloguePDF/2011%20Cheese%20Guide.pdf\n\nBut cheese is like that. It's almost impossible to find grass-fed. With Francesco you're at least in better hands than most. And dairy isn't Paleo anyway; this site isn't called PrimalFinder. Point being: if you want to stay Paleo they'll gladly leave the dairy, grains, legumes and nightshades out of anything. It's separable like home cooking.", "author": "Matt L."}

You have to order this dish.  It comes with potatoes and kale as sides.  The chicken skin was crispy and so were the potato skins.  The spices were so well-mixed and flavorful, I wish I was able to finish it all...but I got full fast.\n- His main course: Fileji di Renato (Corkscrew pasta with braised pork ribs, tomato sauce)--I didn't like the texture of the pasta so much because it was a little bit hard to chew, but it went ok with the fall-off-the-bone meat from the ribs.\n- Our desserts: Red Velvet Tiramisu and his Orange Marmalade Cake--mine had too much cream because there were about 3-4 layers of the lady finger red velvet cake and each layer had the cream filling in between.  It was a little too much.  His Orange Marmalade cake was really good--tasted similar to a Tres Leche cake with a zest of tangy orange flavor.\n- I also enjoyed the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant because it's technically a victorian house that they turned into a restaurant.\n\nCons:\n- They should make the desserts less creamy with all the fillings because it's too much to consume at the end when you're already full.\n- Pricey place, but well worth to try at least once...especially if you have a living social or groupon, or one of those deals.\n- Parking is hard to find in the neighborhood, so go on a Sunday if you don't want to worry about constantly leaving the restaurant to go feed the meter since it's meters are free on Sundays (for now at least...).", "author": "Wendy T."}

I would return to Poesia even simply to enjoy that dish again.

Remember when appetizers were meant to stimulate the appetite?  Now they often bludgeon them. Not at Poesia. No over-the-top calories or gimmick here. No over-the-top flavor trumps subtlety and can cover up bad technique and a lack of imagination. I am so glad Poesia offers beautiful food...it is not trying to be like Joel Robuchon or Jean Gorges and such likes or calling for the next incarnation of nouvelle cuisine.

My biggest nightmare would be to have to stand in front of a large group at a flower convention and give a 2 hour lecture on chrysanthemums.\n\nJust like the word Chrysanthemum, I have issues with the Italian language. Spanish, I am pretty good, French? I can sneak by, I have even gone as far as learning a few phrases in Farsi and Russian. But there is something about the birth place of the Latin language that gets my tongue tied. This probably explains my fear of Italian wine. But recently I found an Italian spot that has helped ease my fear.\n\nWe were in search of a dinner spot off the beaten track to host a casual business dinner. One of my coworkers suggested Poesia. So we all hoped in a cab and made our way to the Castro. Even though this was last minute, they were able to accommodate a table of six for an early dinner. We arrived shortly before 6:00 and were seated right away. Our server quickly came over and took drink orders and glasses of Prosecco and Pinot Grigio were quickly brought over. \n\nDrink time helped us study the interesting menu filled with creative dishes. One look and you will say \"yes please\" to everything. We narrowed the table down to four delicious starters, the calamari served with Monterey Bay Fresh Squid and baby arugola was delectable and the Gnocchi Silani was mouthwatering. Both of these dishes stood out and were the favorites. \n\nI saved room for dessert and passed on the second course and went straight for my main entree. I was told the pasta dishes were not to be missed so I concentrated on this portion of the menu. I decided the Orecchiette al Forno was the best choice and even though I completely butchered the pronunciation I was quickly forgiven and given a standing ovation for just attempting to say it. The Orecchiette pasta was perfectly cooked to al dente and it left no doubt in my mind that it was house made fresh that day. The pasta came served with Radicchio, Provolone Compano, and walnuts. This was a perfect combination and the flavor of each ingredient came through like a shining star.\n\nPoesia won me over and if you are looking for something with a neighborhood feel, but still has a classy big city vibe look you need not look any further and make a reservation here.", "author": "V B."}

When I checked in with the host he confirmed my reservations and explained they were a bit behind, but that a bunch of tables would be getting up shortly and we'd be seated.  The restaurant was literally overflowing with people waiting and looking extremely unhappy, with more people piling in every five minutes or so.  \n\nBy 10:10, seven two-person tables had become free.  Since I could see on their computer that I was fourth in line to be seated (after other two person tables) I assumed I was set.  Instead, the tables were combined so two large groups could be seated.  The owner and host (understandably busy on New Years Eve) seemed un-phased when, at 10:25, I asked how much longer the wait would be.  Since I had plans for after dinner (which I assumed would be by 11, with a 9:30 reservation) I had to leave--starving and extremely disgruntled.  \n\nFor a fairly classy restaurant, it's very disappointing to see that they could have such poor service.  They clearly overbooked and were not turning a single arriving party away.  My New Years Eve started off on totally the wrong note because of this, and I'd have at least expected some concern instead of the host seeming relieved that somebody was taking themselves out of the waiting list.", "author": "Danny G."}

If this is your thing then fine; however, if this is your thing and you love to spend a fortune, then you'll love this place.  It's just overpriced for what you get.  Dishes are served in the trendy huge plate with a nugget o' food in the middle.  \n\nGnocchi, good, but people were raving it was the cats meow.  I got some squid ink risotto which actually was really nice...what wasn't nice was the price tag.  Once again, the key take away is the price doesn't match with the quality.\n\nSimply put: there's nothing special about this place.

I called early in the week and had no problem booking a table for 10 although once word gets out I imagine it'll be hard to get any sort of reservation, much less one for a large party.\n\nFirst off - the food ranged from good to fantastic. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and the clear winner was the burrata. Oh burrata, how I love your creamy, cheesy goodness. As for the entrees, everything was fantastic. My fusilli featured a pork ragu that literally melted in my mouth. And the other items that I tried - from the orecchiette to the gnocchi to the cod were all really tasty.\nAnd while I'm trying to lay off desserts (I'm watching my girlish figure)\nthe tiramisu was some of the best I've tried.\n\nSo why only four stars? Service was a bit hit or miss. Our waitress was awesome, joking around with us and quick with recommendations (plus she gave great massages) But in other areas, service was lacking. Our bread was never refilled and we constantly had to ask for more water - actually, I don't remember seeing a busser on the floor. One other note, one of our entrees was undercooked (rare chicken = bad) Our waitress apologized profusely and the chef even came out to apologize. They brought out a new order of chicken and assured us that we wouldn't be charged. Nice touch.\n\nPoesia is so close to five stars that it hurts.

We tried out one of their specials; baked eggplant with cheese and scallops. Great texture, big on flavor, and I really don't think I've ever had this combination of flavor before. And if I was full after those apps, my hunger was conjured back up with the site of the fettuccine with lamb shank ragu. Doesn't that just sound sexy?! Tender, melting, lovely lamb nestled in al dente fettuccine, dressed in a heart pumping red sauce. If Angelina Jolie was a pasta it would be this one, fosho!

My filet was good - well prepared and with a good dish.  \n\nAnd this is where I start having to split hairs - because they are a 4-star restaurant that could be 5.  Poesia is like a lover who rests on technique, because they're bored.  It's fantastic food served well - but without a soul.

The ricotta soufflee was good - the pancetta was nice, meaty and crispy - but the elements of the dish were not completely integrated.

I thought however that the drink pour for a glass of wine was maybe 60% of normal.  more on this later. \n\n I would give the wait staff five stars for friendliness and making you feel welcome.\nour orders were taken and me and my partner ordered another glass of wine.\nwhen the wine came out it was the same tiny pour as before.  it was so small that I decided not to order any more because this was a rip off to get maybe a 4oz pour for $11.00.  if you go to this  dining establishment be sure to bring your own wine and pay the corkage age of $20.00.  I wanted another glass of wine but chose not to because I would have found it upsetting to pay full price for something that was less than one would expect.\n\ntwo of us ordered the salde.Insalata di Rucola  with\nBaby wild arugula, bosc pears, rosemary goat cheese, citrus dressing\nit was a nice salad, fresh, but nothing to write home about.\n\n I ordered Eggplant parmigiana, fresh mozzarella parmigiano reggiano.\nit  arrived cold and I had to send it back to be properly heated. the waiter took the dish and had it heated to the proper temperature graciously.  the the tomato sauce had a lot of flavor and yes the eggplant dish had a lot of flavor. I can recommend it if they can get it right the first time without having to send it back for proper heating.\n\nmy friends had the following  dishes an a main.\n\n1.Spaghetti allo Scoglio \nMediterranean mussels, manila clams, calamari in a light spicy tomato sauce\nvery fresh and tasty. especially the  Mussels. However,  the portion was somewhat small.\n\n2.Fileji di Renato \nCorkscrew pasta with braised pork ribs, tomato sauce\nI did not taste but look very good\n\nPros\n-Friendly and welcoming staff five Stars\n-very warm and romantic environment \n\ncons\n-ripoff wine pours-(bring your own bottle and pay the $20.00 to open. as their wine pours are mini pours.\n\nfood was good not great.

You get one star for being clean and  being that all important step above McDonalds.  This place got that much right.  \n\nThe next star is for service, good service gets a star.  No star here. The service was extremely impersonal, slow--even for a saturday night,--and our server seemed entirely uninterested in our experience. It was apparent that the restaurant had no vision of what the service experience should be like so the waitstaff was left clueless.\n\nThe next star is for the food. I would describe my partner's dishes as disgusting--not a word I have ever used on yelp.  The swordfish pasta was metallic and fishy tasting and smelling with pasta like paste. My dish was okay, but greasy. Nothing remarkable about the menu or the taste combinations. Desert was forgettable, except the moment when my partner's lemon meringue made me gag because it tasted like fish. No star.\n\nNext possible star is for ambiance.  With nice candles, white tablecloths, and a nice neighborhood feel, I expected this place to do fine in this category.  But then they sat a large, loud party next to us and it turned into a bar scene. No star. But on the right night the ambiance here might be quite nice.\n\nLast star is if the place has something special, not this place.", "author": "G F."}

Arrived a few minutes late, get our seat prolly 15 mins later.\nDid not take us long to pick out our food. We were served small pieces of bread, with olive oil. I asked for vingerette, which NEVER came.  We ordered the grilled calamari, which was pretty burned, and dry over salad. I was very disappointed. I thought its the usual calamari. I have to say i actually enjoyed the oily salad more than the squid. Totally bummed. \nThen our entrees came, it was eh, ordered the braised pork (two tiny small piece) with probably 10-15 piece of pasta. it was yummy (braised pork), since it was cooked perfectly. It melted in my mouth. However, the pasta tasted it wasn't cooked to perfection, rather is was luke warm. The other dish ordered was the free range chicken, which was tasty on the top, but rather dry. My overall impression is Eh. I love the setting, and design. But not impress by the food.

The wonderful lasting impression that Italy left in my mind gave me slight concern as my tastebuds might be bias to the local flavor. The experience at Poesia did not disappoint .\n\nWe began with two starters. One was from the specials, a beet salad. The other, heirloom tomatoes and burrata. The freshness and simplicity allowed for mother nature's gifts to shine. I am not saying these were the best appetizers that I ever had... but, they did not stand a chance on the plate.\n\nWe had the Orecchiette with sausage and Lamb Ragu with fettuccine for our main dishes.

Francesco was a gracious host as he seated us though I was surprised he didn't make the rounds of the tables later in the meal.  Ambience was excellent; the Italian movies being broadcast on the wall a la Foreign Cinema were a nice touch.  I'm not an expert on Italian cinema but both films were refreshingly unfamiliar to me.\n\nFirst Courses - Bacala (salt cod) al forno was exceptional; I think even diners who haven't liked the fish before would enjoy this preparation.  The roasted sardines had a satisfying crunch and the golden-and-red beet salad was also very good.\n\nSecond Courses - The risotto nero was perfectly cooked, the squid ink giving it a smokey flavor.  I thought the lobster reduction served with it was a little overwhelmed though.  The half chicken was tasty but slightly overcooked and dry.  The branzino was roasted whole and expertly de-boned at the table; also a satisfying meal.  The crab ravioli were the star of the course though - plentiful sweet crab in perfectly cooked pasta offset with a sauce that had a bit of a kick (unlike previous reviewers, the pasta wasn't swimming in sauce; it appears the chef is paying attention).\n\nCocktails were fun - the specials were a blood orange cosmo and a blueberry Manhattan.  We had a very serviceable Arneis from an interesting wine list.\n\nPlus - the servers waited until all four of us had finished before they cleared the table; this is the way I was trained in restaurant service.  I never liked feeling rushed when I was the only one with a plate still in front of me.\n\nMinus - three of the dishes were plated by a round mold.  It made an attractive presentation but I would've rather seen more creativity.\n\nPrices are on the high side - even with a Groupon - but we would definitely go back for a celebration dinner.", "author": "Cal C."}

It was dreary and raining... we almost missed the restaurant bc it's not street level. Luckily I saw the restaurant's sign. \n\nThe restaurant is very homey and sweet. It is small, but has a fair number of tables. I love the movie projected on the wall, the decor and the lighting make you feel like you've found a hidden gem in the busy busy streets. We got a little table next to the window, and it felt like being a world away from all the people who were running in the rain down below the streets.\n\nThe wait staff was very attentive and helpful with suggestions for wine and food. The homemade bread they serve had a nice crust but still soft and chewy -- not your typical loaf of sourdough or \"italian\" white bread. For an appetizer we ordered the beef carpaccio. It was good quality meat and the dressing went well with the little bed of salad but it was too acidic for the both of us. I looked like Popeye after every bite.\n\nI ordered the much praised squid ink risotto with scallops and lobster reduction. I felt like it was a bit on the salty side but still good. It included two scallops halved on top the risotto for presentation more than taste IMO. The soon-to-be hubby ordered the pork rib pasta w/ roasted garlic and tomato sauce. I was a bit bummed when I didn't see ribs in his pasta dish, more like pulled pork. The meat was tender, but nothing to really to write home about especially for that price. We had ordered dessert bc neither of us was actually full/satisfied yet. We ordered the orange tiramisu.... they should have just left the classic alone -- it did not work for us. all i tasted was the cointreau. The fluffy cream just didn't melt into it like a normal espresso tiramisu would.\n\nAll in all, I don't think there's enough food for what you pay for.

Had they handled it correctly, we would definitely given them 4 or 5 stars. \n\nWe ordered the corkscrew pasta with pork sugo, the filet mignon, and the risotto. We were pretty happy with all the dishes except the filet. Presentation was good, flavor was great. and our bartender was super friendly. \n\nThe filet came out and it tasted like fish. We both confirmed this and we asked the bartender if it was suppose to taste like that. Maybe, it was cooked with some fishy broth? I don't know, but he went to talk with the kitchen. I even said that if they say that was suppose to taste like that, then we'll just box it up and take it to go. He came back and said that it was the broccoli that made it taste that way. The dish came with broccoli but the strange thing is that my boyfriend took a bite of the broccoli first before continuing onto the fishy tasting meat. The broccoli didn't taste like fish. But the bartender (I assume he was repeating the lie that was told him by the kitchen) said the broccoli came in today and had a very strange smell. It was broccoli rabe. I've eaten it many times, and it doesn't have a fishy flavor. Obviously the kitchen cooked with utensils that touched fish and also the meat. \n\nSo, he said they will separate the meat from the broccoli and cook it so that it won't have the fish flavor. \n\nIt came out again on top of the broccoli, but the bartender intercepted it and brought it back to the kitchen. They re-plated it and had the meat on the side. The meat tasted fine, but it was not medium rare anymore. Plus my boyfriend had a fishy flavor in his mouth, which pretty much ruined his appetite. \n\nWe were pretty insulted that they would think we're stupid enough to believe that broccoli tastes like fish, especially when the broccoli on the plate didn't have ANY fish flavor, while the meat did. \n\nThey should have apologized. Admitted that the meat was crossed over with fish due to cooking utensils or the same grill and just remade the entire thing being careful not to mix the two together. \n\nThat really sucks, because we live up the street and we were hopeful to find a good dining place in the Castro.

The staff have a difficult time getting around and if you're of  size at all, it's horrible.\nNow, the food is nothing spectacular.  We ordered the mussels with sausage and the beet salad for apps.  The mussels were old, mealy and very \"fishy\" tasting and there was no sausage in the sauce, at all.  The beet salad was good, but could use more than 4 pin-head size pieces of goat cheese. Our entrees were the lamb ragu and crab ravioli's.  My husband liked the lamb, the sauce was rich and lamby although there was very, very little meat.  The ravioli's were okay. They have pancetta cubes along with the tasteless brandy sauce and the pancetta overwhelmed the delicate crab meat in the pasta.  Bad choice for an ingredient. But the ravioli pasta was well cooked.  We ordered the chocolate mousse dessert and I was expecting a pudding cup or something and out comes a rectangular plate with 2 mounds, no more than a tablespoon each, of mousse surrounded by a drizzle of olive oil and chili powder sprinkled on the plate.  For $14.00  I expected more, not that it was bad, just stingy.\nI have to mention that the meal was okay, but toward the end of our dining, a man came into the tiny, packed restaurant wearing an Aqua Velva/Old Spice cologne which he bathed in, apparently; the air became thick with this smell and it absolutely ruined the meal.  I immediately got a headache and started to wheeze, which is not something I do! We had to exit quickly and I felt like it was clinging to my clothing and like taking a shower, it was that bad.  \nI know the restaurant can't do anything about this, but with all the laws out there about offending peoples sensitivity, can we do something about these smelly louts?\nWe're going to stick with Bar Bambino for excellent Italian food, where it's much easier to get to (no parking nightmare) and the food and staff are top notch.", "author": "Mary D."}

The outside is crispy, the inside is moist, and it's served whole. One of the favorite dishes I've had in my dining out life!\n\nMy most recent visit (last Tuesday) was with my boyfriend's mom. She asked our host (who is also the owner I take it) whether they have a happy hour on cocktails. I had a feeling they wouldn't since it's more of a restaurant then a lounge or bar, but the host said they don't, but would check to be sure. He returns to share the good news that for us it is happy hour and we can have half off the cocktail menu.\n\nTheir cocktails are not the usual, plain mixed drinks, they are along the lines of the Alembic, Beretta, and Orbit Room: elaborate, elegant, and delicious! I had the one with citron and basil (highly recommend). As our server, Devon, returns with our drinks we learn that after some discussion they decided to start a happy hour for first seatings! How awesome! Furthermore, Devon is the mix-master and creates the cocktails from the finer-shelf liquors (no well drinks here!) and any fresh ingredients the chef has, which tells me this list is seasonal, always fresh, and made with care (he even makes his own simple syrup for the drinks). If this isn't a drink made with TLC, I don't know what is. At $8-10 regualr price the price is fair, at $4-5 during happy hour it's insane, in a good way.\n\nI'm proud to be part of this movement and guarantee satisfaction.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-12", "description": "He's not late, he's Italian. \n\nPoesia is in the heart of the Castro, and as such, it could not have been more friendly and attentive to a table of four men. Only one of us was wearing a wedding ring, which made three of us, apparently, fair game. The bartender was particularly amicable, mixing us some strong Negronis, making great wine recommendations (like a Monchiero Carbone, Roero Printi 2004), and even going so far as to give my friend a massage...(that's in the good waiters' handbook somewhere, right?).\n\nThe pastas are all handmade - no self respecting Italian would have it any other way - and so our meal consisted of a fantastic cauliflower orrechietti and the tantalizing burrata and eggplant tortelloni. We also had an off menu risotto that was sublime in texture/taste/consistency.  Some of our other choices were very good, but they didn't match the brilliance of these three dishes. Our pork ribs, rack of lamb and filet mignon were all highly respectable, with the only outcasts being the gnocchi and arancini, which bummed us out given how much we love both these dishes. For dessert, we had the tiramisu and a cannoli - both textbook Italian/Sicilian perfection.\n\nConsider this: there's Italian food, Italian cooking and Italian restaurants (Sbarro be damned). Italian food can be made by anyone that can follow some simple instructions with a few key ingredients; Italian cooking - not to be confused with a cooking Italian - can be achieved through hard work and careful study (personally, I recommend Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking by Marcella Hazan); and Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen, which is why selectivity is essential (and why Yelp.* is god's gift to foodies).\n\nIn the instances when you discover a place that fits all of the above (and throw in a cooking Italian, to boot), you've got yourself a rare find. The size of this place alone is a testament to its authenticity. Restaurants in Italy are generally TINY, and the chefs are their embodiment in personality, style and substance. As such, chefs take great care to see, socialize, listen to, and enjoy their patrons. Francesco d'Ippolito, Poesia's chef, works the dining room and the kitchen, because that is how it is done en Italia.  If your meal takes anything short of two hours, then you've rushed things and probably missed out on something. Instead, expect to come for an evening and lose track of (and interest in) the time.\n\nAll told, think of Poesia not as a restaurant, but as a first rate Italian kitchen. Francesco even cooks with the \"TV\" on, projecting old B&W  Italian films on the wall (boy, did I ever miss the memo on this trend http://www.yelp.com/biz/specchio-san-francisco#hrid:Wz8rbSeL3drmhqk6wm9z3g).\n\nAnd like all good Italian kitchens, no one walks away hungry.", "author": "Nils E."}

We had the chocolate souffle to share and it was well prepared and presented.  \n\nThe service was 2-3 stars at the most. There was about 10 minutes when our plates needed to be cleaned and we wanted another glass of wine and the waiters kept missing us trying to grab their attention and there were only about 5 tables full in the whole place. \n\nWhen we arrived and sat at the bar, we weren't offered an aperitif but rather shown the menu and told the specials and seeing as we were 30 minutes away from ordering at that point, it seemed a bit pointless. I asked where the meat comes from and was told Australia for the lamb and various other countries for different cuts...I don't think there's any excuse for SF restaurants to not buy from sustainable local farms these days...maybe that explains why my pork was a bit stomach churning.\n\nThe interior is cool, it's small but very comfortable but it's too small to warrant the movie dominating one whole wall.

Terrific, authentic Italian cuisine.\n\nStarters: The antipasta misto had a nice selection of cured meats, olives, fried zucchini & goat cheese. The special bruschetta (thank you Jessica, our server, for teaching me the proper pronunciation of this common enough word) topped with local Chantreles in a buttery drizzle of sauce. \n\nDinner: My Dungeness crab raviolis were stuffed and al dente perfect with a sprinkle of mixed greens with baked cherry tomatoes on top. My friend's rack of lamb was juicy and full of flavor, get it rare (it's local too). My boyfriend's Fusselli pasta with braised pork had one of the freshest tomatoes sauces, it almost squeaked.\n\nWines: Start with the Prosecco, light and sparkly, switched to the Pecorino (I thought that was a cheese:) then finished with the Arneis, full flavored but delicate, not smack you in the face dry.\n\nDessert: A must try dessert is the chocolate mousse with chili and olive oil (yes you read correctly). Quite a combination. The tiramisu was a layer of flavors, that thank goodness the chef had the good sense NOT to drown in cocoa powder. Grand Marinier soaked cakes with a creamy, almost zabbione like textured filling. A candied orange peel on top with a mint sprig was a nice touch.\n\nService: From the moment we mounted the steps and the host opened the door and greeted us warmly in Italian, I knew we had found the right spot. Jessica our server was absolutely wonderful, funny and knowledgeable. There when we needed her, but not hovering. The rest of the waitstaff assisted whatever table needed help. This is the kind of service that everybody needs to incorporate in their establishments. Even as the small dining area filled up, the waitstaff just kept going. Clearing tables and setting up for the next guests with ease and grace.\n\nPrice: Yes, the secondi dishes were $19-$29, but the rest of the menu is very reasonable. Wines are at the upper end per glass, but you get to explore true Italian imports with little risk.\n\nCons: only two; the noise level is quite loud (especially with the braying hyenas two tables over - yes you know who you were) so pleasant conversations are out of the question. Also one of the waiters decided to take a break right behind me and cracked his knuckles several times. Perhaps he didn't think I could hear, due to the din of the dining room, but he was only 10\" away from my ear. Not a major issue, since he was cute, but management might want to take note.\n\nAll in all an extremely pleasant evening! We WILL be returning soon.", "author": "Doug W."}

Desserts were pretty and OK, best was lemon with meringue and vanilla ice cream. Areas to improve: better bread (need one of the many excellent SF bakers), cooler room temp (in summer), desserts need a master to match the food. I notice ceramics, liked the porcelain plates, simple white ceramics with double edge feel.. This place has a wonderful wait staff and low pretentious vibe.

I'm also going to note that getting there early makes a difference.  They didn't have enough servers when we were there, and once full, the service seemed to get a bit slow.", "author": "Wes W."}

I celebrated my birthday here with my parents, sisters and husband this week and we had a wonderful experience.  They sat us at an intimate table in the corner near the bar & if felt like we were being served a home cooked-meal, but with out-of-this world service (and no dishes to do afterwards! yipeee!).  The man who booked our reservation over the phone greeted us at the door with a warm smile (and he even said, \"you must be Sara\"!).  So cute.\n\nWe started by sharing the salad w/nectarines; heirloom tomato salad (hold the anchovies); beet salad & amazing tomato soup.  Best tomato soup ever.\n\nThen a bunch of us shared entrees.  My hubby & dad both had the filet with arugula (WHOA!  It was butter melting in your mouth!).  My mom & I shared the eggplant parmigana, which was tasty and light--very good!  My sisters shared the lemon chicken with veggies.\n\nWe left feeling satisfied, but not too full.  This is a great restaurant and I think that they will be successful and hopefully a staple in the Castro for years to come.  Go try it!  Enjoy :)", "author": "Sara W."}

I didn't like it.. much at all. It came with potatoes and veggies which were good. The fish was just... IDK lacking in the flavor department. There was a sauce that was on the side of the fish, but even when I dipped the fish in the sauce it wasn't heaven. It was more like.. IDK I just can't describe how plain it was for me.

The squid ink risotto was good but uninspired.  When I envision my last meal, none of these dishes even make the top 20.  When friends come into town and want Italian, this restaurant barely crosses my mind.  When it's date night and I'm trying to figure out where to take the boyfriend, Poesia isn't even on the radar.

Tiny it really is and the tables are pretty crowded and jammed together.  We arrived a few minutes early and the host greeted us with no smile, but a para military and dismissive attitude, but we didn't really see him again until we left, so he wasn't dampening our dining.  We were given a small two top table along a wall banquet and promptly serve water and our menu's.  A waiter appeared right after with a spot on description of the nights specials, and they all sounded great, damn these choices between great alternatives.  We ordered two different entree's and started with their quite good version of Caesar salad adorned gracefully with fresh Monterrey Bay Sardines.  We then shared a fettucine pasta with braised lamb shank and for entree's I had the sliced filet mignon over an arrugala salad with sliced parmesan, and Dave had pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta.  All the sauces and pasta are hand made slowly, gently and deliciously in the restaurant every day.  The service once past the host was excellent, the ambience perfect for a romantic dinner although a little cramped for hand holding.

Heard about it on KQED's \"Check Please!\" several months ago.  It's located in the heart of the Castro in a walk-up location previously occupied by other restaurants before it.\n\nMy GF had an artichoke \"cake\" and eggplant parmigiana, and I had baccala (salt cod) and pan fried brazzino (seabass).  The artichoke \"cake\" was a fried crust with pureed artichoke in it surrounded by a tomato-based sauce. The baccala was flaky and accompanied by a light cream sauce. Both were excellent.  Eggplant parmigina is not a favorite of mine, but my GF said it was very good.  The brazzino was stuffed w/lemons, garlic and cilanto, which gave the fish a wonderful taste and flavor.  Ended the meal with a strawberry & chocolate cannoli and a complementary glass of Poesia's homemade chocolate liqueur, both of which were excellent. \n\nService was  friendly, courteous & attentive.  Plates weren't wished away before we had finished and noticed that the waiter backed off on his own from taking my empty brazzino plate when he saw that I was still sopping up the sauce with bread. Our water and prosecco glasses were always filled, entrees were delivered by 2 waiters, and we were escorted to the door which was opened for us when we left.   This is the best service I've received for some time -- even better than received recently at much more expensive restaurants.   \n\nA definite find and highly recommended!", "author": "Martin C."}

This is a cozy little place that holds about 25-30 people tops.  It seems like the people that come are mostly regulars.  When we were there, only about 6 other people were dining and at the best point there were about 10-12.  Our group of 5 fit nicely into the central area.\n\nThe place is moderately lit and inviting.  The people that work there actually are Italian, which is a good sign.  Our server, Mattia, was patient and attentive and answered all of our questions.  The menu is small but varied, so we had a lot of questions.  We agreed to order different things so we could try them all out.  Gotta love the Asian family style dinners.\n\nTortino Carciofi, a fried artichoke cake.  Flakey, crispy, and very good.  We cut it into 6 slices and there were 5 of us ... imagine the struggle when we all wanted the 6th slice but are too polite to take the last one. [4/5]\n\nMenabrea, an Italian beer.  I'm no beer expert, but this was good.  Kind of lite Stella Artois but a little punchier and more body. [3/5]\n\nOrecchiette al Forno, very good, probably my favorite dish.  This dish just seemed earthy and hearty.  [4/5]\n\nFish of the day.  Sea bass that was poached and lightly seasoned.  Good, but not quite enough flavor and pretty pricey for the lack of taste and preparation. [3/5]\n\nEggplant Parmigiana. Pretty good, you can tell the eggplant was good quality and not musht.  I actually like this dish a little heartier with more cheese, kinda old school.  Good but not great.  [3/5]\n\nGnocchi silani.  Appetizer of gnocchi with ricotta and heirloom tomato sauce.  This is not nearly as dense as they gnocchi we usually know.  This is partially due to its freshness, gnocchi made fresh can afford to be lighter and less dense. [3/5]\n\nFileji al Ragu.  This is supposed to be their favorite dish, pasta with pork ribs and roasted garlic.  The pasta is very good but I was expecting both a little more pork and a little more flavor from the pork.  It is not bad but for $20 I expect a little more substance.  If you're in a group, definitely try this one but if you had one dish go with the Orecchiette. [3/5]\n\nThis was a good dining experience and we had fun.  Thankfully we got the 2 appetizers because the dishes were average sized but not quite enough for a large appetite. Torn between 3 and 4 stars because the quality doesn't quite justify the cost of $33/person without any alcohol (I had the one beer).", "author": "Dave K."}

It's a cut little place and the staff are all friendly and fairly attentive.\nThe real draw for any restaurant, though, is the food.  \n\nWe began our meal with a Grilled Calamari Salad.  The Calamari itself was tasty, though I will nit-pick and complain that while the mantle was excellent, the tentacles were a bit overdone.

My plus one and I enjoyed the samples at Poesia's table so the restaurant owner, Francesco, offered us free wine tastings and desserts for our first visit.\n\nThe ambiance is delightful and stirred immediate excitement in all of us.  Poesia is a cozy second story restaurant that is ideal for intimate parties.  The ma\u00eetre d' was charming and kind and made good conversation while we waited for our table.  Francesco also made it a point to give us a warm welcome and explanation of the restaurant's history.  The paintings on the wall were dramatic and powerful and I found them even more alluring after learning they were paintings of family friends and that the woman in the main painting was his grandmother.  \n\nFour girls shared 3 appetizers and 2 entrees.  It was the perfect amount of food.  Among the risotto with scallops, gnocchi, and squid salad, the fresh squids from Monterey over a bed of arugula was easily the most tastiest appetizer.

Though the waitstaff didn't have anything to do with my horrible experience here, it was one of the most horrible dining experiences ever.\n\nIt was date night and Eugy picked the place.  We find parking nearby and walk on over.  When we found the restaurant, both of us were surprised. This is someones house that has been turned into a restaurant. Seriously. The living room has been made into the dining room and the bar is in the entry hall along with some stools and low table to sit and wait or have a glass of wine at. Very interesting. I loved it. On the wall is a large projector that has an old black and white italian movie on it. Very nice touch.\n\nThe service was great. All the servers did somewhat of a ballet throughout the night with plating and clearing and pouring. It was nice. \n\nBut the biggest problem for this place seems to be the communication between the kitchen, the servers and the customers. For starters:\n\nOn the menu there is a dish which the menu states:\n- Squiqink risotto with scallops and squid. \n\nWhat actually came out was squidink risotto with scallops, squid, mussels and some unknown white fish. \n\nAs most of you are aware, I'm allergic to fish. Not thinking that this would have fish on it since the menu listed the other items only, I popped a piece of what I thought was scallop into my mouth. And before you go asking me \"You can't tell the difference between fish and scallop?\", in this case, no, I couldn't. It is really dark in the restaurant and this fish was a small piece and looked exactly like the scallop that was right next to it. \n\nSecond form of lack of proper communication between the kitchen and the staff:\n\nWhen our really handsome waiter was telling us about the specials, he mentioned a duck ragu over tagliatelle. SOLD! I ordered that, while Eugy got the rack of lamb. \n\nWhat came out however was halibut over fettuccine. \n\nApparently, the chef didn't erase everything from the day before special and then wrote today's specials and it got mixed up. \n\nOverall, just a bad dining experience for me, mostly because I was sick for the rest of the night and all of the next day, due to a poor communication error. \n\nNOTE TO RESTAURANT: It would be a good idea to list the things that actually come with the dish that is listed on the menu. You don't have to write every single item with sauce and such. But if you are going to list 2 meats served, why not just list all 3?", "author": "Jen D."}

DELICIOUS! I couldn't get enough.  It was the *perfect* temperature and had the perfect amount of spice.  It looked real fancy too with the olive oil on top in a fancy little design.\n\nTwo ordered the spaghetti with shrimp and zucchini, which came with a nice white wine sauce.\n\nI had the fusili pasta that came with spare ribs and a red sauce. Uhmm, amazing! It was definitely the table favorite. The pasta wasn't really fusili. The noodles were long and skinny and had the consistency of gnocchi. The spare ribs were a bit fatty, but still delicious. \n\nThe only male at the table had the special, which was lamb chops.  They were pretty good, but could've used some salt in my opinion.  \n\nThe servers were super awesome and overly friendly! We learned about Rome and how's it not kosher to ask for cheese with a pasta/fish combo.  One of the waiters used to work (he told me he was the owner) at Steps of Rome (pretty sure he licked some tiramisu off my neck there for my b'day a couple years ago).

The appetizer and main courses were delicious.  I ordered the Filet Mignon and it was cooked to perfection.

This place SURPASSED my expectations by far - and in many ways: \n\nFOOD:  It was unbelievably fresh and tasty. We started with the seafood salad which was very good. He had the black squid ink risotto special, and I had the papardelle pasta with duck special; both were flawless. \n\nDESSERT:  We shared the cannoli for dessert because I had spotted a few of them being served, and they looked truly authentic; kinda reminded me of my days in Boston, where I'd CRAVE the mafiosa-made cannolis from the North End... Mmmmm! Apparently a guy from Sicily makes them fresh and delivers them every morning to Poesia... Yum! It was also a nice touch that the owner brought us 2 after-dinner, chamomile-infused liqueurs, to accompany our dessert. \n\nOUR WINE:  The california russian river pinot noir (under $40) was amazingly good and our waiter didn't balk (even for a moment) at the fact that we didn't order italian. Absolutely no attitude there. Love it. \n\nSERVICE:  I wonder if they perhaps read Phil H's review, complaining that the water and bread were never refilled, because I noticed that both our bread basket and water glasses were replenished *regularly* throughout the meal. So we were able to stay hydrated while drinking some fabulous vino. \n\nOWNER/CHEF/SERVERS:  I think we met every single one of them over the course of the evening! All were friendly, fun, professional, and genuinely cared to hear how we were enjoying our experience and food. And yet they left us alone at the right time, allowing us to linger a long time after the meal, not rushing us with a check until we asked for it.  They just left us to enjoy 'til we were ready to go. \n\nI'm PSYCHED this place has opened up, and even moreso that they've opened up just a couple blocks from where I live!

And waited. And waited. Once the cocktails arrived, we waited for bread. We ordered and while the food was fine, it wasn't a lot of food.\n\nThe restaurant was noisy - and I really found the projected Italian movie on the wall a bit much. Sure, you can steal ideas from Foreign Cinema, but at least there they have the space for it. Here it became a big distraction on the wall.\n\nAfter the appetizers, entrees and two bottles of wine, we just wanted out. We asked for the check and were provided with a complimentary dessert for the table. Nice, but um, can we have the check?\n\nThey are trying hard, but after the fact.

It's such a shame how much mediocre food there is in the Castro district in general... I would think that the neighborhood would be perfect for refined dining, but it has been disappointing to dine there in the past.  Now that Poesia is open that problem is solidly solved!  \n\nFirst of all, the space is lovely- on the second floor, it looks like a converted flat.  The staff, including owner, were so plea sent and genuine we felt like we were already regulars.  I even stuck my head in the kitchen at the end of the meal and was rewarded by big smiles from all the line cooks.  Everyone seems really happy to be there, which always makes a meal more pleasurable.  \n\nThe zucchini carpaccio w/ truffles was delightful- I never thought I would enjoy a vegetarian appetizer so much.  The pastas are all house-made and taste it, and the portions are small enough that you can also have an entree.  However, you simply must have dessert- as a bratty ex-pastry chef, I can be very critical on deserts.  The Tiramisu and (get this) chocolate mousse w/ olive oil and sea salt were among the most \"honest\" desserts I've had- I'm so sick of gorgeous desserts that taste like cardboard.  These were divine.\n\nWines were also lovely- we had a Brunello for $90, among the most expensive on the list, but worth it.  Someone earlier wrote that they ordered the \"Iron Horse champagne for $27 and were charged $70\"... if there is a place out there you can get Iron Horse for under $60 I'd love to hear about it.  I think that must have been a misunderstanding of some sort!\n\nOnly open a month (as of yesterday) so some slight inconsistencies barely warrant a mention.  We ate too much, but that's not their fault!  We'll definitely be back in the near future, skipping all the action on Castro and heading straight upstairs-\n\nOnly deducting one star for being quite expensive in the long run... not their fault that we ordered a lot of food and wine, but it still remains true that it averaged $80/ person that night... and with wines only around $45 or so a bottle that seems high.  Still, yummy.", "author": "Jennifer P."}

I'm waiting to go back for Northern Italian recipes, since my family used to summer in Laggo Maggiore and Locarno every year (helps if you're European).\n\nThe wait staff is amazing; probably the best no-frills servers/hosts I've seen in a while.

This time I went with a friend. I called a few days earlier and was able to get a reservation for two at 7:45 on a Friday night. When we got there, Franceso greeted us warmly and escorted us to la prima tavola right in front at the windows overlooking 18th. St. It was great since it was so warm that night and the windows were open. We started with a bottle of prosecco and split a fennel salad. I had the special Venetian-inspired scallops' dish in a sepia risotto.  My friend had the orrechiate which she really enjoyed. She also remarked that the bread was really good which I think is an indicator of a restaurant. If there's great bread, great food usually follows. She also liked the dipping olive oil.\n\nIt's interesting that they-along with just about every Italian restaurant I've been to in America-serve olive oil with the bread because I have never seen that in Italy. The service was incredible. My friend said afterward she couldn't figure out who our waiter was because there were four people taking care of us. My friend didn't care for the zabaglione so after dinner we went to Swenson's for sundaes.\n\nThe place was packed and very lively. I was able to practice my Italian with everyone - which I really enjoyed. The clientele was very mixed with straights and Castro St. area locals whom I have now dubbed i Castrotti.\n\nProsecco, one salad, two entrees, dessert and  tax : $85.00.\n\n********************\nFirst visit: This was my first time. I totally loved it here. When I walked in, the owner recognized me from playing accordion in North Beach.  I sat at the bar so I could do my italian homework and I was able to talk to everyone in Italian which was fun. There were a couple also at the bar and they were talking in Italian.\n\nThe waiter screwed up my order and brought me the wrong thing, but what I had was great and I am so brain dead I didn't even realize it was the wrong dish. The owner bought me a glass of wine for them screwing up the order once I realized it was the wrong thing.\n\nThe entree was not a lot of food so I ended up getting the fennel salad afterward. Both the entree and sald were fabulous. The food is more upscale and gourmet-like than what I usually see at italian restaurants. But, the place is not stuffy and the prices were moderate.

But even then I feel bitterly disappointed.\nCalled a week ahead and told them I have celiac disease and was reassured they understood what gluten was and would make sure I was taken care of. Well...they didn't.\nWe were 15 minutes late for our reservation, but even then we waited for almost half an hour in the bar for our table to be ready.\nDrinks were okay, but nothing special. At $9 and $10 for the cosmo specials, I wasn't impressed.\nI can't comment on the bread, but my dining partners fell in love with the fried dough bits (3stars) that were in the basket. The others they used to sop up the juices from their (and my) plates.\nDinner - I had the beet salad to start and the salted cod for my main. The beet salad (3star) was nice, and plated very well. The salted cod I'm pretty sure had gluten and even if it didn't, it was barely palatable. It was so overcooked! (1star, obviously)\nDining partner #1 and #2 ordered the eggplant souffle to start and enjoyed it. Given what else they ordered, it was enough to share (4 stars). They split two pasta dishes (the gnocci and the braised ribs) and the gnocci (1star) came barely lukewarm even though it was supposed to be \"oven baked\" and the rib dish (3star) was nice enough, and they might order it again, but ask for extra meat.\nThe dessert was a mess. They were out of one, which of course would have been the gluten free option (other than the obvious gelato, but what celiac is going to order that when a restaurant actually has *real* options?) So the dessert came, and it wasn't presented as advertised and dining partner #2 had to call the manager over to ask what the heck it was. Lucky for us, DP #2 speaks fluent Italian so he was able to communicate but we would have been SOL if he wasn't there to help us.\n\nBottom line: I wouldn't go back. Dining partner #1 wouldn't either. DP #2 might. It was a lot to pay even with the groupon, but without it I would have been pissed.\n\n*Not recommended", "author": "Carla S."}

I loved every bit of it.\n\nThe service was spectacular--attentive without being overbearing.  When I had questions about two Italian wines, my server not only offered to let me taste each, but poured me two half-glasses--the lighter-bodied red (a sangiovese) to go with my appetizer and the heartier (primitivo) to accompany the tagliatelli with lamb ragu that was my entree.  Both were perfect pairings.  Dessert was a tiramisu flavored with Grand Marnier, which I paired with a lovely, light moscato.  \n\nTrue, it wasn't cheap, but I think that the prices are completely in line with the ambience, the quality of the food, and the service.

I loved the Victorian architecture and romantic low-lighting.  It would be a perfect date place or perfect for any special occasion-- actually the couple sitting to the right of us were celebrating their anniversary the night we went.  However, I wouldn't come here if you're in any kind of a rush...this is true European style dining, where the waiter requests that you ask for the check, when you're ready to leave.\n\nI was a bit indifferent about the fried artichoke cake appetizer (I've decided that I prefer my artichokes whole, instead of pureed), but I thought the pork ribs and tomato pasta dish was orgasmically good.  The filleted pork, was tender and juicy, the tomato sauce was bubbling with flavor, and the pasta was freshly made.  Even though I was full at the end of my meal, I really could have ordered another pork entree, just to be a glutton.  \n\nThe dishes were beautifully presented,  the cocktails were quite inventive, and I think almost everyone enjoyed their main dishes, but there seemed to be an issue with portion equity.  My friend's roasted chicken dish with potatoes and vegetables was huge!  My pasta dish was medium sized yet  filling, but my friend's chestnut ravioli came with about 7-8 pieces and no side garnishment or vegetables.  I was hungry for her, at the end of the meal.  :~(", "author": "LaSha G."}

Poesia brings Italian regional cooking to the Castro, with dishes from the Calabria region of southern Italy. We tried several dishes, and all were outstanding.  It is clear that this restaurant pays close attention to fresh ingredients, including vegetables and seafood. Two of the dishes that really stood out for us were the pyramid-shaped cheese ravioli with a dynamite pesto sauce (with hints of dill and perhaps mint, in addition to the usual basil), and the fresh Mediterranean sea bass (Branzino). The Italian varietal wines were solid (we had help with the pairing), the servers very attentive, and the prices reasonable. An exceptional dining experience.", "author": "James B."}

After ascending the steep and narrow stairs of this Castro Restaurant, you enter a space that reminds you of what your Italian grandmother's house might have been,  Living room, dining room, and a full bar.  It also is a bit Cinema Paradiso with Italian movies playing on the wall.  The service is superb, from Francesco welcoming handshake at the door, to his frequent visits to the table to see how \"we like\".  I was enticed to this restaurant because of it gluten free options, which is unique of a pasta house.  The gluten free pasta was delicious with a roast pork gravy.  (Gravy is what Italians call sauce).  Although I could not eat the Tomato soup because it is made with Dairy, it is highly recommended for those who can eat dairy.  The branzino was good, just slightly under-seasoned.  This is a neighborhood gem, and a rarity for the Castro to have a good restaurant.

Each dish is impressive all by itself (don't call it \"Italian Food\" unless you've been there; this isn't the Sausage Factory), but is even more of a standout in the Castro. It's about on par with Range in my opinion if you substitute the dutiful service for a homey, warm living room-type atmosphere where they expect you to hang out (this isn't a place that rushes to bring you the bill so they can turn over your table, but they do breeze by to ensure you're making yummy noises).\n\nStill, Poesia scores higher in my book because everything is so full of care. It's not one of those snooty Michelin machines that churns out technical excellence. You can totally taste the love.\n\nMy only criticism of Poesia is probably something it prides itself on: everything about the place is completely understated. Beige signage and stairs leading up make it tough to find, so even Castro residents are all \"What's Poesia?\" (About half the diners are clearly not of Castro origin.) I also know that the restaurant has had some stellar write-ups, but none of them are hanging on the wall. That's not an accident either. My aunt had honey with her tea and freaked out. \"Taste this honey!\" she said. \"It tastes like fresh flowers; I've never had honey like this in my life.\" Sure enough, we found out they get it direct from Italy. How special is that?!\n\nIn short, go to Poesia, but don't tell your friends. Oh, and make sure to get the spicy chocolate \"shots\" (\"Cioccopic\") if you don't get dessert.

If I lived in the city, I'd keep this gem to myself.  ;-)\n\nWe went early-ish (6pm) on Friday night before going around the corner to see the restored \"Metropolis\". Others have mentioned the decor, the 1950s/1960s Italian movies sans sound (that night it was \"Nights of Cabiria (1957)\").\n\nWe each had a glass of wine while looking at the thankfully-limited menu; we had enough trouble deciding what to have as it was. And there were 3 off-menu specials as well.\n\nWe began with grilled sardines (well executed, yummy) and gnocchi in a citrus sauce (deliciously unusual; I almost canceled my entree and got 2 more orders).\n\nFor entrees I had the fileji di renato that has been mentioned in other reviews, and if anything it was better than even my high expectations. But the star was the nightly special branzino that my wife ordered. One of the best fish I have ever tasted, and I grew up near New Orleans with my friends' French grandmothers cooking for me. My wife at everything but the bones and the eyes -- smart girl.\n\nWe washed all this down with a bottle of '04 Antano Sagrantino di Montefalco. Again, yum.\n\nWe finished with double espressos and gelato, including a chocolate one with olive oil and other goodies. The latter nearly got my hand cut off by my wife when I dared to try for a second taste of it from her plate.\n\nThroughout our server, whose name I unfortunately never got, was friendly, courteous, efficient, and all those other good things. He made us feel at home the moment we sat down, and took great care of us.\n\nIf you're coming into the city on BART, exit at 16th Street Mission station, grab the 33 bus right there on Mission, and it'll take you right to Poesia.

I went on the really hot day (you know, the only one we'll have until October) and it was a little stifling, but luckily heat isn't much of a problem here so the lack of a cross breeze shouldn't have much impact on them. The staff is incredibly friendly and stylish and oh-so-Italiano. They let you taste wines at the bar before you order. Big ups. The wine list, as you might expect, has a wide selection of Italian varietals, some at really decent prices given the \"we're imported from a country whose currency regularly beats up your currency\" factor.\n\nThe food was slightly hit or miss, which is the only reason Poesia does not get 5 stars. My dining companion and I split the fennel and orange salad which was really disappointing. The fennel had no flavor at all. It was just texture. Fennel is SO local - their chef could seriously walk up to my hood and pick wild fennel right off the slopes of Twin Peaks if they wanted to. Flavorless fennel is inexcusable, especially as the main ingredient in a salad. \n\nThe pasta dishes, however, were excellent. I ordered the orichette with cauliflower, which was served perfectly al dente, loaded with cheese and straight from the oven. My companion had the gnocchi, which was absolutely divine.

This is Italian. Besides, Chinese restaurants give you bigger portions with bigger bones for that kind of price, or maybe half that price. Nobody serves small little catch with a million little bones, those are considered cheap, unwanted fish. Especially with thick creamy sauce, that's just unheard of. With all of that you can't even find the bones in your bite and you end up swallowing a bunch and having the worst dinner experience ever in a fancy, hyped up, highly rated Italian restaurant in the middle of Castro.\n\nI did tell my waiter about it and he told me that it's expected to have tiny bones in tiny fish... um.... right. But later on he came back and offered to change my order, which made me a little more satisfied. The second order was okay I ordered a simple pasta dish. \n\nI must say, the flavor of their dishes do come out uniquely and is above average.\n\nMy friend though... whatever special she got that day, it was a shrimp pasta. Well, it made her sick. She only ate a little bit of it and stopped. I tried one shrimp and thought something was off with the taste. 20 minutes after we left the restaurant she puked everything up. And she's said she rarely ever throws up food. She felt so weak after we had to call it an early night and take a taxi back to her hotel. That was the end of her visit with me, the first time I'd seen her in four years, thanks to this meal. \n\nI'm sure others have had good experiences with this restaurant. But this is my first time, and it ruined my night with my friend, so it's going to be my only time.", "author": "lilcooptown g."}

Disappointing Food\n\nWith fond memories of other restaurants in this space, over the years, we really wanted to like Poesia.  The location is great.  The atmosphere is upscale, warm, inviting and cozy.  The staff is friendly, polite, attentive, authentically Italian and easy-on-the-eyes.   Service was very good. \n\nThen . . . there is the food.  It was, well . . . SAD.   Not a single dish was right and everything suffered from incredibly poor presentation.\n\nFirst, the Carpaccio was just a few thick slices of low quality beef wrapped around hunks of salad, hidden under even more weeds and then doused with a forgettable dressing.    We had expected the traditional presentation of thinly sliced meat with a few capers . . . not a big pile of salad.   The Tomato Mozzarella Caprese was just as bad . . . huge hunks of mushy, over ripe tomato - served in a BOWL, of all things - with a few lumps of cheese and a tasteless dressing.  We had to ask for salt and pepper, (which was not on the tables), to make it acceptable.\n\nMain courses were equally disappointing.  The roast chicken had great flavor, but was horribly dry and over cooked, as were the accompanying roast potatoes.  The pricey Rack of Lamb looked pretty but presented very small, fatty ribs with an overly acidic sauce and an odd taste.  Desert?  It was somewhat better, but the cake was also overcooked and dry.\n\nIn short, we're glad we tried Poesia but will not come back.  For Italian food at this price range, we'll go just over the hill to Lupa or Ristorante Bacco, in Noe Valley.", "author": "Sebastian T."}

My girl and I made reservations for Saturday at 6. The restaurant was empty couple of people at the bar and 1 or 2 couples dining. We started out with the Antipasti, Antipasto Misto, that was out standing. I ordered the rack of lamb and my girl ordered the corkscrew pasta with braised shredded pork ribs. Let me just say and quote, from the food section in Sundays Chronicle. \n\n\"Lamb--especially rack of lamb--is best when medium rare. A half rack of lamb can weigh from a little less than 1 pound up to 1 3/4 pounds. It almost always has eight bones unless one has accidentally broken off\". \n\nI had the rack of lamb, 2 pieces of lamb each had 2 bones, where is the other half of my lamb? I told my girl that this is not a rack of lamb, a rack has 8 bones. The cut of meat was also trimmed too much. You need fat on meat to give meat flavor, or else you have meat with no flavor. My girl had the corkscrew braised shredded pork ribs, the pasta was NOT corkscrew it was something else very thick and under cooked not al dente, but crunchy raw. Since my lamb was small due to the lack of the other half, my girls pasta was even smaller. \n\nThe service was very good, the drinks were good, the food needs to improve and step up to the plate, especially since they are across from the GREAT EUREKA. This is an Italian restaurant create great Italian food. At that point of the evening we opt to go across the street to... you guessed it,,,The Eureka for dessert and drinks.", "author": "joy e."}

The environment is comfortable, the food frighteningly fresh and inventively seasoned. The prices are reasonable for the quality.  Lastly, the staff is warm and charming.\n\nReview: Is the new center for Italian cuisine in San Francisco moving southwest?  While the Mission is quickly becoming a breeding ground for the best inventive food in the city 18th Street is drawing amazing Italian food.  It all began with Delfina, their Pizzeria next door then Farina down the street and now Poesia up the street near Castro.\n\nPoesia inhabits a cursed location one floor above 18th street between Castro and Hartford.  There have been no less than 6 restaurants in the space in as many years that have ranged from a burger joint to middle eastern and Japanese themed eateries.  Each time the space felt feng-shuei-challenged. Not this time!  Poesia - Osteria Italiana rocks.\n\nSmartly-dressed Francesco greeted us and immediately seated us in their quiet (a first for neighborhood Italian places) dining room.  I ordered a tasty Nero d'Avalo Sicilian red wine and settled in.  \n\nWhen it came time to order I chose the appetizer and pasta specials.  Moreover I enjoyed actually hearing my dining partners voice while we waited for dinner.  My garden fresh salad was a mix of arugula, bright-red cherry tomato and scooped-from-the-sea grilled squid.  It was a perfect way to begin the meal with a fantastic light dressing and the right amount of acid against the tender baby squid.  The pasta was an inspired blend of fettuccini, pan roasted cherry tomatoes, a smooth and silky tart 'n' spicey tomato sauce with coulis of basil and olive oil set against buttery cubes of saut\u00e9ed swordfish finished with fresh romano cheese.   (Writing about my meal made me hungry again!)\n\nWhen they found out that we were neighbors and it was our first time in the restaurant they treated me to a home made chocolate liquor that tasted like a melted, ultra rich milkshake with a boozy bite.  My compatriot had a foodgasm for their extraordinary homemade chocolate mousse with sea salt, olive oil and chili powder.\n\nWow, these guys have really brought a different dining experience to the Mission/Castro.

I had assumed it was a residence -and indeed it once was- but when you walk up the steps into the second-floor restaurant you find a very warm atmosphere.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly hostess and waited just a few moments for our table to be set. They gave us the one right at the front window with a great view of 18th/Castro which really did help set the tone for the evening.\n\nOur meal was very tasty as was the wine which we asked the server to help us select.

He was quite friendly and later sent over some delicious sampler liqueurs. \n\nI think both my girlfriend and I felt like we were getting the royal treatment. You always hope for good service when you go out to dine, but rarely get the type of legendary service we encountered that night. \nI suppose it was due in part to the fact that it was a quieter night of the week, and possibly because we mentioned that we chose the restaurant from Yelp (raising restaurant standards since...?)

We had a cozy round table in the back by the bar. The appetizers were amazing, my pasta was delightful, but my friend's chicken was a bit dry.  That is what she gets for ordering chicken over pasta, but I have to agree there is nothing worse than drik chicken.  We EACH had a starter, a salad, a main course and a dessert so between the five of us, we tried just about everything.  With the exception of the chicken - the rest was great, including the steak.  The service was fantastic too.

And although I've seen a couple of reviews here that are critical of the service, our experience was a very good one.  We were there on a Friday night and the place was very busy.  Despite this, we had excellent service.  It is a little on the pricey side, although we had no regrets dropping some cash here as both the food and service were outstanding.  We could've gotten out a lot cheaper if it weren't for all the wine.  We will definitely go back.", "author": "Kevin H."}

In some neighborhoods it would not stand out but the Castro is a culinary wasteland for the most part. No one goes there (the neighborhood) for its food choices. The best restaurants prefer to locate in the more hip Valencia corridor 1/2 mile east. So Poesia being here serves its local community well.\nThe location is up a stairway above a garage and the dining room is small and intimate. It is very comfortable and well appointed but not hip and ultra chic.\nIt is a quiet and reserved place that is really great for a date.\nI had the Lamb Shank Bolognese pasta. It was so delicious! The wine list is excellent with glasses priced $8-11. Service was refined and attentive. The host is a really nice gentleman (I think he is the owner) and he is there to make sure that you have a good experience at his establishment. My dining partner had the Grass Fed Filet Mignon which I tried a bite...and was also incredible. It melted in my mouth!\nI only drink beer and wine so I cannot comment on the cocktails.\nOverall, it was a really enjoyable dinner that was worth the price.

We waited an hour before even getting bread.  Our appetizers were bland and tasteless, and unforunately, the main course, which we waited another hour for, was the same.

Not much has changed from when this place use to be Ararat.  Of course the paint is new, the corks are gone from above the bar, and the style is more French Country...I thought this was suppose to be an Italian restaurant?\n\nAfter ordering our entrees (both specials for the night), the boyfriend called and said the he and a friend would be joining.  Changing our table from a two top to a four was no problem at all.  The waiter was more than happy to fulfill our request and wouldn't even let me carry my own gym bag to the other table. \n\nI ordered the veal which was very tender but small in portion.  It came with zucchini and potatoes which were quite delicious.  We're still not quite sure what my friend ordered other than we think it was Salt Cod raviolis with a red pepper and shrimp sauce.  He said that it has no taste and that he wasn't sure if the lack of flavor that it did have were mixed well together.\n\nThe BF ordered the gnocchi which was extremely bland and mushy.  He had asked for ground pepper and salt and not even that was able to help save his dish.  Our other friend had ordered the Airline Chicken Breast like Joshua M. did and it was the same as he had reviewed, \"...looked like it came off of a Cornish Hen (TINY), and it was charred.\"  We think this was topped with a lime and cilantro sauce which had a very grit-like texture.  Needless to say, the BF returned his dish and did not order another entree as we were all finished with our meals.\n\nThe dessert was okay.  One friend had ordered the hazelnut ice cream sandwich, but he said the bread it came on was hard.  I believe it was made to come that way, however he would have like it to be a little softer.  I myself ordered the cannoli which I thought was wonderful.  The BF on the other hand spit it out and thought it was disgusting.  His loss!  I ate the whole thing.  Strangely enough, when I asked for the dessert wine list, they looked at me like I had a huge pimple on my forehead.  Finally the waiter came over with a ruby and tawny port.  The tawny port was fantastic!\n\nThe waitstaff is extremely friendly and attentive.\n\nI don't think I'll be heading back to Poesia anytime soon.  Like Joshua M.

The menu was refreshingly brief: selections for antipasti, zuppa/salade, primis and secondis all squeezed onto one page and which included some delicious-sounding plates.  \n\nAs we arrived, the place was abuzz and there was barely room for us to wait on the small chaise by the front door.  Other patrons entered, stepping on our feet, and getting swiped by the busy wait-staff.  Finally, 30 minutes after our reservation, we were seated by the placating host.  We didn't mind the wait, the atmosphere seemed fun and the b&w film showing on the dining wall kept us entertained. \n\nNearly everything was downhill from that point onward:  We had to ask for our bread and oil, our drinking water, a decent wine glass as opposed to the neanderthal-goblet our Montepulciano was initially served in, and the food was...not as good as it sounded.  \n\nFor starters, we ordered an artichoke puff pastry which was completely mediocre, surrounded by a too-tangy citrus sauce, and an over-the-top rich gnocchi which never melted in the mouth and was too grainy inside.  The kitchen did hit it just right with a lentil-fava zuppa flavored with pancetta and topped with grilled calamari.  It was subtle but deeply flavored and the crispy squid were delicious.  Unfortunately, our risotto nero came to the table looking like someone had assembled it in a dark room.  A massive heap of black rice with green-tinted scallops and shrimp around it - very poor presentation.  It tasted passable but we were ready to cruise at that point.

The appetizer then made it on our bill, but in exchange the dessert was free - what's going on here?  We all make mistakes, but why not fix them and move on?\n\nThe food itself was alright - I wouldn't bring people here for the food, but I wouldn't avoid it, either.  I liked the very dense chocolate mousse (but good thing we split it) although the mascarpone near it had to be scraped off the plate camouflaged under chocolate powder dust, and was easy to ignore; the grilled lamb chop appetizer was great.  The breaded, fried fennel worked surprisingly well with pepper, but would have benefited from something to cut the grease.  The dreaded reappearing beet salad appetizer didn't impress me - it had been dressed up in one of those stack-inside-a-metal-ring formats, but the flavor stayed kind of blah - they could have used a little dressing.

We were not sure what to expect when we first walked into the restaurant.  We were early diners, and although the restaurant had reservations for 91 clients that night, we were quickly seated.  The restaurant is very tastefully decorated, with a flair of sophistication reminiscent of an elegant Italian villa.  The seating is very tight, so privacy is limited but intimacy is shared.\n\nWe began our meal with the gnocchi silani.  The gnocchi are house made with a remarkable cream sauce accentuated with a hint of citrus.  The sauce was very well balance without being overwhelming.  The undertone of the lemon married so well with the gnocchi, tomatoes, and basil.  Our taste buds were pleasantly awakened.\n\nFor our entree, we ordered the Filejo do Renato (pork rib, garlic, smoked ricotta.  I had the tagliatelle with beef ragout.  All we can say about them is \"oh my god!\"  The pastas were again fresh home made, and the seasoning of the sauces were perfectly balanced with no overtones of herbs that can ruin a meal. Poesia's chefs are superb!  The pork rib were so tender that the meat fell off the bone.\n\nFor desert, we ordered the tiramitsu with grand marnier - wow!  airy and delicious.  We also ordered the poached pears in a red wine reduction served with a cube of puff pastry with hazelnut gellato.  This was one of the best deserts that we have ever tasted.\n\nOverall, Poesia was quite a surprise, and a definite do again.  The food presentation was perfect, and the owner/GM was in attendance ensuring that everything with our meal was perfect.  Although service was a bit slow at times (busy night) we were quite pleased with our dining experience.\n\nThe menu changes every night, so if our experience was consistent to the dining quality, we are due for wonderful experiences in the near future.

There are lots of good options for vegetarians, but they also serve alot of seafood and the dining area has the aroma you might expect.

The waiter changed it out for me, but by the second cup I realized it was just bad tasting coffee. 2) The olive oil served with the bread was so bitter it was inedible. 3) It was early in the evening and the restaurant had already run out of the fish course.

My dining partner orderd the orrichette with artichokes, walnuts, and provolone. Excellent choice as well.  The dessert is what we talked about all night.  The chocolate mousse!  Small scoops of dense, rich mousse on a smear of marscapone cheese, sprinkled with rock salt, and drizzled with olive oil.  There's a whole chili on the plate and everything is dusted with chili powder.  You take a small scoop of mousse with the cheese, and then just touch your spoon on the chili to break it.  When the combination goes into your mouth, it bounces around on your palette unbelieveably.  What a combination of flavors all at once!

The more I think about the $80 I spent for a total crap meal, the more I feel I need to post this review. While the wait staff was pleasant, the kitchen really doesn't know or care what they are doing. Our appetizer was bland gnocchi with a texture somewhere between wet sand and chewing gum, and drowning in an almost inedible sauce of out-of-season mussels. My friend's fava bean and calamari soup tasted vaguely burnt and was unpleasantly viscous, rather than light and fresh as it should be. My branzino -- a whole fish but really not much of a fish for the $26 it cost -- was chewy and flavorless. It came with \"sauteed vegetables\" that turned out to be oily cherry tomatoes and red peppers that may as well have come from a can. The wine was unremarkable and overpriced. Even the bread was stale. We loved the basil-infused vodka martini, not the least because it cleared our palates of the horrible meal.

After debating with friends for 30 minutes on where to go, we settled on Poesia for a few crucial reasons\n1. I wanted \"down home\" Italian food while one of my friends has more eclectic tastes, and the menu seemed to satisfy both\n2. It was a halfway point for our group, walkable by both parties, thereby preventing both the need to drive AND a sense of equity.\n\nThe food was superb. We shared the heirloom tomato salad (served with some of the tastiest olives I've come across) and I got the gnocchi as my main. The tomato sauce was perfect, the gnocchi itself was both chewy and creamy, and the mushrooms a lovely accent.\n\nHave to rave about the chocolate mousse as well. We actually settled on the grand marnier tiramisu to share. The waiter had heard us debating beforehand and so he brought us out a complimentary serving of the mousse also. The consistency is almost like non-frozen gelato, and the sea salt, olive oil, and chili powder work perfectly. The grand marnier tiramisu was also a delight.

The service was 5 star but the food was unspectacular.  I would have to say that my squid appetizer was excellent, but the pork ribs left something to be desired.  First of all, it was actually the ends of pork ribs with plenty of inedible cartiledge.  My wife said her meal was just ok.  The food was expensive for what you got and quite disappointing.  The dessert we got was supposed to be like a Tiramisu but resembled more of a mouse like dessert.  It was $10.  Instead of having ice water, they served water out of some bottles but left a high ball glass with ice on the table.  Why not have ice in the glasses in the first place?  Anyway, four people, four entrees, one salad, one appetizer, two desserts and one coffee amounted to $150 exclusive of tip.  There was no wine, beer or soda consumed.  My personal recommendation is to skip this one.  I'm going to have to re-evaluate my opinion of Yelped restaurants with 4 star ratings from now on.  I've always been under the impression that 4 stars would be a pretty solid place.  I now know that isn't necessarily so.\n\nAdd to this the fact that two men wearing only g-strings were displaying their bodies just a few doors away.  It sort of ruined my wife's appetite.  I mean, even if it got her in the mood for linguisa, the Poesia doesn't have it on their menu!\n\nI wish restaurants would print their specials on a sheet with the prices.  They always love to tell you about their specials but never tell you the prices which are usually more than the average prices on the menu.", "author": "geoff k."}

We had been to this restaurant many years ago when it was  a great French Style bistro\n\n  This was a most dissapointing dinner i have had in ages.  We were greeted and seated promptly and then the quality went down hill. The ridiculous stingiest bread basket i have ever seen, would make any respectable Italian Trattoria blush. We were looking for a great meal and this restaurant is not the place to find it.\n\n   We found this restaurant through Living Social..A 3 course meal including  two glasses of wine , for two people, When we arrived we were directed to choose only from the HOUSE WINE  Red, White or Rose'..The offering almost like receiving a stingy wine tastig.  We were allowed to select the soup instead of desert which was very nice, since neither of us ate sweets. The soup a Tomato bread soup was nicely presented but poorly executed..tasted terrible...like eating tomato cardboard. for the next course  my partner ordered Mussels...He swears   the sauce accompaniment tasted like tomato paste and after tasting it i totally agree...ugh. My brasoalla was like eating yesterdays roast.   NOW for the secondi or entree OMG  for $26 my partners Filet Mignon could NOT have weighed in more the 3 ounces...give me a break... My so called Sea Bass was tasteless and boring. it was not prepared in Olive Oil as my server had guaranteed.  It was obviolsly cooked in heavy vegetable oil which i am totally opposed to. The kitchen obviously NOT Italian and it really shows.\n\n\n   We ordered a second glass of wine and mysteriously  it became a different offering of different quantity.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-08", "description": "Poesia was a big disappointment.  First the menu is very limited.  At first glance I almost walked out - they offer 5 options and the only meat was a steak.  Though I soon noticed they had 'Specials' so decided to stay.  BTW  \"Specials\" should be interpreted as \"Special Pricing - So Special we will surprise you when the check comes\".\nOn the positive the service is will executed.  Better then many restaurants in SF.  At the bar the bartender allows you to taste the wine before filling your glass.  Nice touch.  But it quickly falls apart from there.\n1) Mixed Greens:  I thought this was a typical mixed greens salad...  Turns out it was a tiny \"salad\" resting on what most people call an Onion Ring.  Same old,  pre-battered,  Pre-frozen  onion ring from Sysico Foods Dist.   Tossed in the deep-fry.  Great on burgers - meanwhile Italians cringe.  I should have sent it back.\n\n2) Rack of Lamb:  Now I make rack of lamb all the time and order it at many restaurants.  Its good stuff.   At Poesia they cover it with some brown creamy stuff.  While it was cooked properly, it was totally un-seasoned!  No salt, no pepper, no rosemary, no mustard, no garlic.  (To those who love lamb..  Simply stick garlic, and rosemary in the meat, smear mustard all over it, salt the fat, and roast.  Never can go wrong).  Poorly executed and waste of good meat.  Special price of $33!!\n\n3) Risotto:  Give me a F-ing break.  I love Risotto, cook it all the time.  Its simple, simple simple,  and cheap. Learn how to make it and impress your friends.  Risotto is the profit centers of any restaurants.  Its hard to spend more then 4$ for the ingredients so charging $13 + is a no brainer.   At Poesia it was $23 and was about  1 cup of cooked rice.   Another \"Special\" apparently.\n\nEnd of the night:  4 glasses of wine (mid-range) 2 salads, 1 Lamb, 1 risotto  (note:  no appetizer nor desert)  Total $122.00.  I left feeling ripped off!  Earlier that week I had dinner at Boulevard with business clients and the check was actually less!

Another had a lamb dish which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I had a pasta dish with Pork (name escapes me) and sadly it was luke warm but they were gracious enough to re-heat it.  It was difficult to eat though because of all the pork bones and gristle, a bit of a turn off. Generous portion.  They did keep the bread coming to soak up the sauces which was nice and the olive oil very fresh.  Dessert was a chocolate mousse plate, tiny dollops of mousse which was tasty but skimpy.

We waited for an hour when we saw another party being led to the table we thought we were waiting for. When asked what happened, the owner told us they had a party of five and this is the only table which would accommodate the number of guests. We continued waiting, hungry and thirsty. We ordered a bottle of wine to have a few sips while waiting. After about an hour an 20 minutes of wait, we were led to a table for four, it was right in front of the entry door. The food was fine, but frankly, nobody in our party enjoyed it after all this time of waiting. Nothing was done as a comp for the wait, or having to sit at the worst table in the restaurant. My husband and I just moved to the neighborhood (three blocks from the restaurant), we brought two friends from out old area in the East Bay and we were all very disappointed with the reception and service.

Filled up even on a Wednesday night. I had to move seats b/c the movie was right at my head and made me dizzy! \nFirst, I'm not a wine drinker, but if i do have some, it has to be white and not dry. Otherwise it gives me a headache and hurts my teeth. I asked for a sweetish, fruity white. Server suggested a pinot grigio. I agreed. he then brought me a Sauvignon Blanc, which I don't like. He said the bartender said it better matched what I was looking for. I tasted it and did not like it at all. I said i didn't like it. Server told me it would be okay with my food and walked off! \nHowever, when he came back, he said I could get something else if I wanted. I got their special- blood orange cosmo. That was bitter but tasty. \nFood: Tomato bread soup, Fettuccine w/lamb, salted cod cake thing, corkscrew pasta with pork. \nThe bread is fantastic. Not crunchy crusted Italian style, but a soft, super- dense bread that I couldn't stop eating. We had 3 baskets. Yep. \nThe soup was good. Very tomatoey. Reminiscent of eating pasta sauce with a spoon. The bread is soaked in the tomato, making it indiscernible from chunks of tomatoes. I liked it, as did my friend, but not for the price. \nMy friend's cod/potato starter was basically a cod cake. I love sardines and other fishy-fish, but this thing was too salty and too fishy for what it was. He liked it. I thought it was like a sardine croquette. \nAll the food was served on oversize dishes. I like ALOT of food, so not a big fan of big dishes that make food look small. \nExcept for the soup. all dishes had lines of pesto or something similar piped around for decorative effect. \nIt was probably a 1/2 hour between starters and when our pasta arrived. Lamb fettuccine: Love the pasta, homemade, chewy, dense. This dish was quite gamey. Some small pieces of lamb. A chunk of fat! REALLY needed salt, which we did not have on the table. It was good. Not great. \nCorkscrew pasta w/ pork: I liked it, but it was my friend's order. And it wasn't corkscrew, it was ziti (tubes). Homemade as well, and very thick and chewy. I like doughy, but this was too much even for me. Friend commented later that he thought the pasta was too thick. There were a couple largish chunks of pork, though one was mostly bone. It was tasty and didn't need salt. Seemed similar to the lamb pasta, but not as gamey. \nAll in all, the food and service was good. Yes, the staff is easy on the eyes, and very friendly. But to me the wait between starter and main course (pasta here) was too long, and the food too small and under seasoned for the price. \nWithout a Groupon would've felt ripped off. For the above with 1 glass of wine and 1 cocktail (they charged me for the cost of the wine, which I suspect is higher than the cocktail special, but I may be mistaken), = $70. We both agreed food as good or better can be found elsewhere for less.", "author": "Allucaneat G."}

After a long and overdue wait, I decided to take my Italian friend there for dinner.  First off, they asked him if he were Italian, after he was already speaking the language.  No offense, but really?  Then, I sat down to order a drink that was a specific drink.  I did not get my cocktail.  Instead, I got a totally different drink, that wasn't bad, just not at all what I ordered.  The service was very good.  Our waiter was really polite and knew the menu in and out.  The space was kind of plain but not messy or dirty, just plain.  My meal came and it was just so, so.  The pasta was heavy and on the harder side.  When we got desert, we ordered the famous tiramisu.  I give them props for trying to put a spin on a classic but again, they fell short.  Have you ever had a cremecicle ice creme bar?  That's what it tasted like.  Basically, it was orange flavored creme.  'Nough said.  I gave it three stars because the staff were great.

I had the dungeness crab ravioli which was cooked perfectly. There were 6 large raviolis on the plate and each one was stuffed w/ crab. My starter was the grass fed beef carppacio.  The portion was quite large...two large pieces of beef rolled w/ salad greens.  I was expecting very thin slices on a plate...quite the opposite.  My husband started w/ the tuscan tomato soup and had the fettuccine w/ lamb ragu.  He was very pleased with his selections and commented on how well the pasta was cooked. The service was a bit slow to take our order and to give us our check but everything else in between was fine (they checked on us, cleared our table, etc).  I think some of the negative reviews from New Year's Eve was due to it being a very busy night but I think on a \"regular\" night, they are probably more  consistent.

Me, I loved it!).  The entrees were slightly disappointing.  I had the special pasta which was paccheri (think wide, fat rigatoni) with scallops and shitaki mushrooms.  The waiter said they drizzle the pasta with truffle oil but i couldn't taste any.  In fact, the pasta was super bland.  Having weaned myself off of excessive salt intake in the last year, I've retrained my palate to like things not so salty but even I had to add salt and pepper to this dish to give it flavor.  It was fine after the additions but, really, it's the job of the chef to properly season my food - especially pasta.  For the most part, my dining companions enjoyed their entrees - most after adding salt and pepper.  We didn't have dessert but I noticed that the desserts passing our tables looked really small (think two bon-bon sized dollops of chocolate mousse).\n\nI'm not going to write Poesia off just yet but I won't hurry back either.

After three meals there over the course of a few months, I can see where many of the other reviewers' comments have merit, but overall I find it one of the better dining experiences in the Castro (although the competition is getting stiffer!) \nWhat do I like? The room is pleasant, with good lighting and nice artwork, and the classic Italian films silently playing on the wall are a nice touch. It's not overly loud, and the tables are decently spaced AND have tablecloths--both becoming a rarity in the new wave of SF restaurants.] \nThe menu choices are limited and a bit peculiar, but everything I've had has been excellent. This isn't standard \"Italian\" fare, it seems to draw more from the regions of Italy that aren't always represented elsewhere. \nService is...interesting. The waiters are all extremely friendly, very Italian, and often quite attractive (like Francesco, the owner/host.) However, they can be a bit ditsy as well. Last evening I ordered the special chicken breast entree, and was served the special pasta entree (lamb and porcini in a wonderful tomato sugo) instead. However, the minute I saw it I knew it was a keeper, and I devoured it all. A happy ending. The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the wine list, their recommendations are always spot-on. \nAs for some of the other comments regarding prices (\"higher than Boulevard!!\") I'm not seeing this myself; methinks they may have run up the bill with cocktails and wine in addition to food. \nAll in all, I like the place, and I'll keep going back until I have a reason not to.", "author": "Tom R."}

Everything about this restaurant is sort of just okay. It's kind of disappointing because Poesia is located in such a lively district. The entrance of the restaurant is cute. It's sort of hidden because you have to walk up some stairs to get to the front entrance. The restaurant + bar is small and was pretty crowded. The decor isn't very fancy... it's just simple. The service was okay. They were attentive and checked back to see if we had any questions about their menu. Prices were standard (check below for a sample).\n\nFor starters, Alexander C., Eric T., and I shared the artichoke cake ($12) and the sardines appetizer ($13). The artichoke cake was bland. I expected it to be crispy but it was soft and mushy. I hoped for chunks of artichoke hearts but it basically had a blended consistency. The sardines were pretty good. They weren't too salty nor too fishy. I had the beet + goat cheese salad ($9) and it was eh, normal. The portion looked tiny because it was arranged in a neat pile in the middle, but there was definitely a lot of golden and red beets. I had some of my boyfriend's squid ink risotto ($23) and I liked it a lot. I love cheeese and it was just the right amount of cheesy.  However, my boyfriend thought it was way too cheesy. I tried some of my other friends' dishes... the pasta special (homemade bowtie pasta + filet mignon) and the rack of lamb. All of these dishes were pretty good, but didn't excite my taste buds enough. We were curious about the chocolate mousse because it was made with rock salt, chili powder, and EVOO, but we were pretty full. I don't think I would have been gutsy enough anyway. \n\nI hoped this was helpful. I wasn't too enthusiastic about Poesia but it is worth a try.

I was really impressed with everything, and it wasn't just because i was hungry, honest, i swear.  Was here for the soft-opening, and will definitely be back.  First, on arriving we passed it up because it's in what looks like an old victorian house with the entry at the top of a tall staircase that takes you above the regular stores.  I guess there was another restaurant here before (from what i heard), but you'd never know, because it is such a warm and cozy and clean dining space that makes you feel like you are at a friends super dining gala event.  The staff are wonderfully friendly and attentive, very laid back in a lively, energetic, competent way.  The food is just great.  Presentation is gorgeous and simple.  It's hard to say what my favorite is, but most memorable is the arancita - risotta and mozzarella balls, deep fried but not gross and greasy at all.  Light and fluffy with a smokey flavor.  The seafood salad was great, came with a dollop of fennel and carrot shaving salad, and perfectly cooked (and flavored) scallops, shrimp and mussels.  The seafood gnocchi with asparagus and saffron was great, but i actually think the plain old spaghetti was even better.  Light sauce but sooooo much flavor!  The chocolate mousse made with olive oil and with sea salt sprinkled on top is a must try because it's just plain great.  All in all, even though this was a last minute splurge of a Thursday night (splurge as in not regarding money but regarding my much more needed and ever diminishing loss of sleep before an intense early Friday workday), It was a well worth it time and fun, with friends and a great new, hardworking and well deserving restaurant peeps.", "author": "Today Y."}

I had the eggplant parm and my boyfriend had the pork ribs pasta dish.  It was so good I almost died.  No joke.  For dessert, the canoli, which they make to order.  It was heaven.  The only bummer is we finally found an amazing Italian restaurant and it's 400 miles from home.  Can't wait to go back!", "author": "D T."}

Recommended for a date night. =)", "author": "J T."}

Every dinner at Poesia has been a delight. It's a great place for friends, family and dates.  The food and wine selections pair beautifully - almost too beautifully! Good thing I live just a few blocks away!", "author": "Tina L."}

Food which was once creative and flavorful is now boring and bland.  Formerly friendly service has been replaced by servers too rushed to care.   I suspect Poesia may hold on for a while, given the relative lack of competition in the Castro, but this diner will not be wasting his money at this mediocre place again.", "author": "James S."}

Keep in mind I live just 2 blocks away...not sure how in love I would be if I had to travel across town.  However the next time I will stick to the pastas only as the entrees.  They make their own pasta and the dishes are very unique...we had the pasta with the duck...one of the better pasta dishes I've ever had.  Be prepared to spend $20+ on their pasta entrees which in my opinion makes the frequent visits to this place harder to stomach.  We also ordered the pork tenderloin which was good but overcooked.  Which is funny because other reviewers have complained about their meat being undercooked, ah well.  Guess you need to specify these things.  The place was packed and buzzing on a Saturday night and they did a great job moving the service along.  Dig the atmosphere...cozy and fancy with a movie projected on the wall to give it a modern feel.  It's nice to go to a spot that isn't trying to be so trendy and modern.  Oh and don't skip the burrata to start...just don't...I'd go back for just that dish alone.", "author": "Piper B."}

The staff are friendly and make you feel at home.  The food is delicious.  I had a cod fish appetizer that was amazing, both the tomato and chick pea soup were delicious, and I loved the Orecchiette al Forno!  And, you have to try the chocolate mousse.  It has rock salt on top and is drizzled with olive oil.  The Castro was in need of a nice sit down restaurant.  Thank you Poesia.", "author": "genea s."}

As a Philadelphian, I find that few here measure up to the ones in South Philly.  Poesia is so super that I have broken this habit and been back multiple times.  The homemade pasta, filet, soups and desserts are fabulous.  Very difficult to find a good canoli or tartuffo here and I found them both at Poesia!!  Waitstaff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  Can't wait to bring my Philly-Italian friends.", "author": "Christina W."}

I spent my entire career in the food industry and my wife and I love to eat out.  Italian is our favorite cuisine.  This place was a sheer delight.  The couple we ate with are very finicky and they loved Poesia as well.  The service was OUTSTANDING.  They take their business seriously, know their food and were delightful.  The Carpaccio Rolatini(sp.?) Appetizer was excellent and quite  a large portion.  The seafood stew was delicious, far better than your pedestrian Cioppino and 3 of us  had a great fresh made- pasta with a pork ragu.  This place is a real keeper.", "author": "Anthony G."}

If you are looking for authentic Italian food in a cozy environment I highly recommend Poesia.  The food is delicious and the service is great.  The appetizers are particularly amazing.  There is one dish with a tuna spread that I have gotten every time I have gone YUMMY. This is not your typical North Beach Italian Restaurant....so much better", "author": "susie a."}
