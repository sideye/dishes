Why, I wonder, would an entrepreneur name their restaurant that, and then allow their staff to contradict the eatery's name at every opportunity they get.\n\nTo begin with, the dining room is a little dank in its appearance. This was encouraging to me, however, because this often indicates that the food is the emphasis rather than the ambience. This wasn't the case here. The food perfectly matched the stale, uninspired momentum that the interior decorator began.\n\nWe were greeted, at this Peruvian restaurant, by a very sweet Chinese waitress. She was very nice to us through the twenty words of English she interchangeably used to say various versions of \"I don't know\" every time we asked her questions about dishes. For one of the people in my party, it was frustrating not knowing what to order when neither the menu nor the staff are telling you what you're eating.\n\nWe were presented with what appeared to be a grocery store baguette accompanied with a (very) lazy susan of condiments that were as boring as the room we sat in.\n\nThe other two members of my party ordered something. I don't remember what it was. I do know, however, that all I saw was some meat and chicken strewn over long grain 25 cents per pound rice. Maybe there was some kind of oil sprinkled over it. Maybe it was seasoned. I do not know. For $15.00 I would have expected there to be some effort at presentation. There was not.\n\nI ordered the tripe apetizer. I'm adventurous like that. It was cooked PERFECTLY. In addition, one of the odd condiments on that lazy susan went better with the tripe than it did with bread. I was happy to have figured that out on my own.\n\nI don't think this restaurant really cares whether you come back or not. Maybe their location guarantees them new victims, barring them from the need to develop customer loyalty. \n\nThe service was good.\n\nMy food was good. I dont think my companions enjoyed theirs.\n\nThe dining room and wares were clean.\n\nThe one extra star they get from me is due to their knowing how to cook tripe that isn't \"offal\" in its odor.", "author": "Chef Ty .."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-26", "description": "Never coming here again and here is why:\n\nComing from a Peruvian background, I can say that this is the worst Peruvian restaurant I have been to in the state of CA. We order a few dishes: antichuco, papa rellena, and lomo salltado. The cows heart beef in the Antichuco was raw. The marinated sauce was watered down and had a hint of vinegar. When I took my first bite of the beef, I chewed and had to spit it out because of how disgusting it tasted and relieved when I looked at it how raw it was. The Papa rellena's mayo had a very strange taste, might have been the reason why I had the runs for two days after eating here. The Lomo Saltado was a disgrace to Peruvian cuisine. The french fries were these enormous cuts, same with the tomatoes. The meat had absolutely no flavor and tough to even chew. Even after adding salt, it was simply horrible. Both my husband and I were shocked at how badly someone can ruin such dishes. There was only two serves that night and one person in the kitchen. The server was also extremely rude and gave us attitude about how \"fresh the food is because its made to order\" and he repeated this about 8 times. A friend of mine came here recently and warned me about it. She had a different meal and wasn't impressed but since I had never tried this Peruvian place, we decided to give it a try to find out whether or not it was bad or good. Her boyfriend had paid the bill and the next day, someone was spending hundreds of dollars all over the city. She warned me about this too and so we paid with cash just to be safe. So I highly do not recomment this place at all. There are a few other Peruvian places in the city that are worth your time and money.", "author": "Nancy M."}

Lunch portions are about half the size of dinner portions.\n\nLUNCH SPECIAL SOUP: super homemade flavor chicken noodle soup.  Incredibly tasty (a little salty) but this is the homemade chicken noodle soup you always want.  They only do this on weekday lunchtime.\n\nLUNCH SPECIAL SALAD: huge salad with lettuce, tomato, avocado with a homemade dressing that is tart, sweet, and salty all at the same time.  I could have eaten 2 of these salads it was so flavorful.  They can make the salad at other times if you request it.  I'm not sure how much it is though.\n\nARROZ CON POLLO: chicken and cilantro rice.  I like this dish a lot because it has tons of flavor and for dinner it's chicken breast.  For lunch I couldn't tell but it seemed like they gave me a fatty piece of chicken thigh (most people might like that but I don't like dark meat).  \n\nPOLLO ALA FINA ESTAMPA: grilled chicken breast with rice and potato/yuca. Pretty good flavor but the chicken could have used more of that \"steak\" sauce.  Also, got this one to go and the portion of rice they gave seemed tiny compared to what you get in the restaurant\n\nPAELLA: lunch special is still a pretty big portion with lots of seafood\n\nSEAFOOD SOUP: pretty good but doesn't come with rice or any starch so it's not that filling\n\nTAMAL: this is some good stuff.  Filled with chicken, egg, and an olive, seems simple, and it is. But it's just super flavorful and I love the onion salad they serve with it.  Only available at dinner.  I could just eat this all the time!\n\nBREAD with HOT SAUCE AND CHIMICHURRI: wow those sauces are so good!  I started using them on everything.\n\nSuper friendly service and casual decor so you can just walk in.\n\nJust a warning the takeout portion of rice seems a LOT smaller than the dine-in.

When we sat down, the waiter explained to us that they weren't allowed to serve us tap water unless we requested-- and when we did-- IT WOULD ONLY BE ONE GLASS. That's it. The mandate is, you're allowed to have as much water as you want, as long as you request it. If you want a refill? You need to request it. They are not going to automatically refill it for you. That being said, they only gave us one glass of water the entire time, and then urged us to buy bottled water if we wanted more.  Um, what? Ok. \n\nOther than that, the food was average, and they ran out of alfajores. I also have crustacean allergies, and they unfortunately use the same deep fryer for everything. It was good they told us this, or else I'd be swimming in hives, but still-- you can't fry your shrimp or other known common allergens separately? Man. That removed like HALF of the menu (if not more) for me. Unfortunately, the lomo saltado wasn't as seasoned as I would have preferred, but it wasn't bad. The meat was at least fresh.

Let me tell ya, in case you're not aware, lomo saltado is a bomb ass combination--beef, tomatoes, onions, fries, and rice. Apparently some places include eggs. Very good flavor. The meal is about $15, well worth it. The location of this place is cool, if you want a happenin' area on a night out. Polk St. is wild. The restaurant is on Bush, though, right around the corner, so you eat in quiet before possibly continuing your adventures. This isn't an elegant date spot, but it's not trashy either.

We weren't disappointed! \n\nThe person who seated us, as well as waited on us, seemed to be the owner of the place, or at least held a command over the people working there. A basket of bread served with an amazing chimichurri spread was amazing. A bottle of sangria was marvelous, and kept me on point until our Conchit A La Parmesana (scallops, parmesan cheese and white wine) ($10.95) and later my Saltado De Pollo (chicken saut\u00e9ed with onions, tomatoes and French fries along with a nice side of rice ($13.95) arrived. The scallops and chicken were super-tender and the accompanying veggies and rice were moist and delicious. More bread was requested so I could sop up more of the \"gravy\" on all the plates. \n\nOne final note is that we appreciated having the host mention to us as we arrived that certain items on the menu were no longer available.

It's a thin steak draped over a piece of fried bread, topped with onions, tomatoes, and a fried egg, served with sweet fried banana, fried potato, and rice. Topped with their sensational chimmichurri, it's explosively flavorful. I've taken a dozen people to Fina over the years and each one has raved about the bisteak. It's hands-down my favorite dish in San Francisco.\n\nI'm so happy they reopened on Bush, after having taken a friend to the Van Ness location a few years ago, only to find the owners in the final moments of moving out. I turned for a moment to commiserate with my disappointed friend, and when I turned back they were gone, the secret to their unmatched chimmichurri lost with them.\n\nI also love Fina's chicharron de pollo, Spanish tortilla, New York steak, and super zesty salad dressing (salads aren't on the menu anymore, but they'll make one if you ask). Everyone who has ordered seafood has been pleased. The only dishes I haven't been crazy about were the arroz con pollo and paella.\n\nI'm so worried that Fina Estampa won't get the attention it deserves.

I had been to the much more cavernous location that Fina Estampa (without the \"La\") had at Van Ness and Geary several times but didn't even notice it had subsequently closed. You could hardly tell a restaurant was there when it was open since it was hidden behind these huge doors with barely any windows. The new place is around the corner on Bush and much more conventional looking despite the Latin American decor. This is not the new-jack Peruvian food you would find at Destino or Piqueo's but the no-frills, home-style food you may find on some madrecita's dinner table in Lima.\n\nIt's run by the children of the original owner, and it's pretty obvious that their priority is maintaining the family recipes. Jamie W. and I met our good friends Jeremy and Nerissa there for a much overdue get-together a couple of Saturdays ago, and it was as still as a tomb on a rainy evening. That didn't stop us from eating muy bueno starting with the $6.50 Anticuchos, a couple of skewers of marinated beef hearts in Aji Panca sauce (see photo). They were more tender than you would expect from internal organs. As his entree, Jamie had the $12.95 Lomo Saltado, their signature dish with beef strips mixed with french fries, onions, tomatoes and special herbs (see photo).\n\nThe dish was classic Peruvian cuisine, really hearty and succulent. For me, I couldn't resist the $15.95 Paella Valenciana, no longer served in a skillet but on a plate with rice and saut\u00e9ed shellfish mixed in a special saffron sauce with chicken and sausage thrown in for good measure (see photo). This was very satisfying and way too much for one sitting even for me. It actually reminds me of my dad's Hawaiian fried rice with a major splooge of Heinz ketchup. Downscale delicious even with all the clams, mussels and jumbo prawns. You will definitely not leave wanting a second meal. Just pay your check and leave with your doggie bag, or as they say in Peru, la bolsita del woof-woof.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...still as good and hearty as the food at the Van Ness location\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...the new place is nice but a bit on the generic side\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...thoughtful but didn't come check on us much once we were eating\nTOTAL - 4 stars...like you have a Peruvian madre", "author": "Ed U."}

I say this because she nothing but energy, spicy charisma and was VERY VERY Latina.  \n\nThe conchas a la parmasana was flavorful, and offered a nice smokey aroma that brought me back to a special place when I first tasted this during my first trip to Lima.\n\nThe sauces are all homemade and excellent; the Salsa Verde de Cilantro was probably my favorite. It offered the right amount of acidity with the shrimp and mussels in my seafood Paella. \u00a1Ay! I will admit that I think maybe they overdid it with the saffron in the rice, as I started to envision the lining of my stomach turning an iridescent golden hue with every successive bite, but overall it was still pretty tasty. I think maybe I just have a strong preference for more subtle flavorings. \n\n\u00a1Buen! Can't wait to try something else next time.", "author": "Ty T."}

I live extremely close to La Fina Estampa and this is one of my go-to dinner date spots for many reasons. You can typically get a table without a res, the food is amazing, sangria is awesome (and cheap), and the owner / waiter Luis is them man as well. The sangria is key for dates at it just keeps flowing and is delicious, so every one gets a little loose by the end of the meal. Perfect. The vibe inside is classy and romantic. It's decor has nice wooden paneling with candles on every table. I was shocked how nice it was inside when I first ate there as the outside of the restaurant is so unassuming. They should put some tables outside for lunch on the weekend!\n\nMy go-to items are as follows:\n\nCeviche Mixto - must have if you like sea food\nArroz Con Pollo - huge piece of chicken on a massive bed of cilantro rice. my fav!\nStuff crab - can't remember the exact name (congrello relleno or something) but crab filled with scallops, ridiculously good.\nSangria - cheap and delicious. \n\nOther notable items:\nbeef heart - good steak like meat and kind of crazy for adventurous eaters\nChicarones - good for sharing, fried chicken with lemon\nsampler platter - good on your first time to taste a lot of dishes\nfree bread with dips - holy crap the green and red sauces are amazing. I wish they sold this stuff by the bottle.  \nPallella - I was expecting a Spanish style pallella with the soupy / saucy rice but this was a different style which was a little more dry. I think this is more Peruvian style. Was really good once I got over that fact.\n\nIt blows my mind this place isn't more popular.

It's not as loud or busy as the popular Fresca, Mi Lindo Peru or Limon, so if you want to enjoy a quiet  peaceful dinner, then this place is for you. The food is delicious food and the service is fantastic. If you love seafood or Peruvian food in general, I would highly recommend this place. My favorite dish is the Cangrejo Relleno (stuffed crab shell with seafood and a buttery sauce) Its definitely underrated!", "author": "Clementine D."}

Nothing to write home about.\n\nWe also had the paella valenciana -- it was very monotone, from the saffron color to the flavor. The shrimp, chicken, sausage, etc did nothing to the flavor and the rice didn't seem to be infused with the flavors of the ingredients...it was almost like a plain rice dish with those ingredients mixed in. \n\nThird dish we had was the beef with fries and rice. Asked for it to be cooked medium (vs well-done, the only two choices) and it arrived well-done. Nothing special about the dish. \n\nService was okay, lighting was a little dark making it hard to read the menu.\n\nAte at the other location on Van Ness years ago and recall it was sort of mediocre back then too.

I should have known when they told us it would be at least an hour and a half wait (and we were the only ones waiting) that it was a bad sign. When we finally were seated, I looked around and noticed that most of the tables that were there when we got there were still waiting for their food..another bad sign. When the waiter finally came to take our order, he handed us a notebook and told us to write down our order...WTH?! There were only 5 of us...not like we had a huge party or anything. After ordering, two of us got our dishes within 15 minutes. After that, another 30 minutes passed before they brought out two more dishes! By then, the first two had already finished eating. Then the worst part: my mother-in-law was the only one left without her food. This, being on Mother's Day, and her being the only mother at the table. We inquired about her food multiple times, and were told the same thing repeatedly: \"it's coming, it's coming\". After about 45 minutes, she was hungry and cranky and asked the waiter once more where her food was. His response: The kitchen was small and the cook could only make one dish at a time. When she finally got her meal, over an hour had passed since they had brought us the last dishes. There is seriously no excuse for that kind of bad service. Another thing I noticed: in between serving our table, I saw them bring out dishes for two other tables (each with 2 people) that arrived way after us, and those people were able to eat and leave before we even got our last dish! WTF?! If the cook can only make one dish at a time, wouldn't it make sense to serve one entire table first? We spent a total of 4 hours at that restaurant, which was WAY too long. We went for lunch and by the time we got out, it was dinnertime. I don't know if it was just the holiday or what, but you'd think they'd step up their game for an occasion like Mother's Day (and make sure mom doesn't get served last!). This restaurant seems to have terrible (or non-existent) management. I saw the waiters arguing in the kitchen with the owner over our table, but no one took responsibility or even made an attempt to apologize to us for the wait. And unlike the previous reviewer who also went on Mother's Day, they didn't offer to comp any part of our meal-not even drinks :(  They also added in 18% tip, and there were only 5 of us. I guess they knew how crappy their service would be in advance. I'm so so sad to see the name Fina Estampa dragged through the mud, especially when the original restaurant had much better food AND much more competent management.", "author": "Michelle M."}

We had someone with a gluten allergy and the waitstaff was not knowledgeable about the food at all. Recommended 2 dishes, when we ordered one it arrived with a breaded piece of chicken. We explained allergic to wheat. Perhaps he doesn't understand flour is made of wheat?! Or perhaps he likes pain like you've been kicked in the stomach repeatedly?! Beyond horrible service and food that was mediocre at best.", "author": "D H."}

It's a modest establishment, seemingly family-owned.  I ordered the arroz con pollo (chicken and cilantro rice).  Would have liked some more veggies to balance it all out, but it was absolutely delicious.  The chicken was incredibly moist, and the rice had so much flavor.  I'd say the atmosphere was mediocre, but the service and food were superb.  Probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but if I'm in the neighborhood, I will definitely consider!", "author": "Alice Y."}

My bf and i stumbled across this place looking for somewhere new to eat and DAMN am i glad we did! first things first, they sit you down in this great ambiance, small but not too small, Peruvian music playing not too loud, and the staff super friendly. We sit down and they bring out this trio of salsas with some bread. I go for the green stuff first and take a bite. I totally SWOOONED! it was so good i couldnt believe it. We then stuffed ourselves with the salsas so we didnt order an appetizer this time. As an entree I got the stuffed crab with scallops prawn and crab in a white wine Parmesan butter sauce. I never wanted it to end it was just so good. It came with white rice that tasted like heaven i dont know WHAT they did to it, accompanied by a deep fried chunk of potato. MY bf got the broiled steak topped with fried banana and egg and grilled onions. It came with this piece of french bread under it to absorb all the flavor and juices. UGHH SOOO YUMMY. We still cant get over it so im pretty sure well be back before the end of the week! They also have a great wine selection with wines from Peru, Argentina, and Spain. IM IN LOVE!!!

They can count on us to keep coming to this spot because there food is magnificent try the Lomo Saltado.", "author": "Ines M."}

We first went to Fina Estampa when it had the small whole in the wall on Mission Street. Then, we went to the location on Geary and S. Van Ness. We were heartbroken when its doors closed a couple of years ago. We've tried several Peruvian restaurants since and none has the family atmosphere or the flavorful food like Fina Estampa. Today, we went to the new Bush location. The food was GREAT as we remembered it. It will be a MUST stop when we are in the city. No doubt about it! Our menu today: Paella Valenciana, Papa a la Huancaina, Anticuchos, Conchitas a la Parmesana, and Ceviche Mixto. Try it out! You can't go wrong!", "author": "Raul R."}

We finally tried it for dinner twice, and loved it twice.  The wine was great.  The service was prompt, helpful, and friendly.  The menu offers a broad selection.  The serving size for all dishes we tried (8-10 different ones) was between average to large.  And the food was TASTY!  All in all, this place is great, I totally recommend it.  You should definitely check it out.", "author": "Ken B."}
