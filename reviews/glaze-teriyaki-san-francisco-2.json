It also comes with a side cucumber salad that's dressed in something heavenly. Also, I bet you didn't know that Glaze makes their teriyaki from scratch...that's why it's so damn delicious. \n\nCheck out either of their two locations because they are consistently delicious across the board.

Maybe I'm just used to expensive salad spots in FiDi (ahem, Mixt), so anything under $15 with meat seems alright.\n\nI tried out the combo with steak and teriyaki. I requested both medium rare-- the steak was definitely on the medium side of things (no pink anywhere) but still chewy and not overcooked. I would've preferred it to be strips instead of little bits and pieces, but whatever works for them. Not terribly strong beef flavor, but it's teriyaki, and their's was good. The salmon was decently flaky and moist too. 3.75/5.\n\nThe tofu and chicken combo I tried were a bit on the dry side. Verdict: stick with the salmon and beef! 3/5.\n\nThe salad leaves really stood out as being fresh (not wilted in the least), and that carrot ginger dressing felt pretty solid and gourmet.\n\nThe brown rice was again, cooked well and nutty (it's a trend with my last couple of eats).

The chicken is antibiotic fee and \"all natural\".  Antibiotics for growth promotion or any regular use (excepting sick animals) have been banned in CA anyhow since 2015.  And what does all natural mean?  They don't claim to be organic, cage free or any other specific metric. \n\n- The food is overpriced.  It comes out to about $15 for a scoop of brown rice (actual cost 50 cents) a scoop of mixed greens (bag available at Trader Joe's for $1.99) and a scoop of questionable chicken.  Teriyaki sauce btw is actually is just soy sauce and sugar or possibly corn syrup.    So they are actually selling about $2 of food for $15.  \n\n-  it's actually not that healthy.  The brown rice and chicken might possibly be, but the sugary teriyaki sauce ruins any potential to call this a healthy meal. \n\n-It takes waaay to long to scoop the three items described above onto a plate and add sauce.  About 20 minutes too long.

My brother just moved around the corner, so this has become a pretty convenient place to stop by. Pretty much everything stands from my review of the Fillmore location regarding the quality of the food and the service.\n\n\"I grew up on Seattle-teriyaki, which is typically made with very poor quality/cheap ingredients.  Glaze has upped the standards, using quality meat, produce and housemade salad dressings.  They also offer more options than a standard Seattle teriyaki restaurant (3 dressings to choose from, various types of gyoza, etc.).  I always order the same thing. Chicken + Gyoza combo, so I really cannot go into depth on the menu. \n\nI've never been let down by Glaze, everything has tasted great, the chicken well cooked and juicy! The gyoza, crispy and delightful! The sauces are also quite a treat!  I rotate between the salad dressings.. they are all equally fantastic, though I do wish that they offered \"Seattle dressing,\" that sweet, delicious and mysterious dressing that you find at every teriyaki restaurant in Seattle. \"\n\nAlso, note that Domenic is still the man! Even if he has moved locations, his friendly demeanor is always appreciated. \n\nBiggest disappointment here is the beverage situation.  I wish the Chestnut location would take note from Fillmore and offer Manny's Ale and Jones Soda on tap.  Those two things alone make it worth the climb up to the Fillmore location. Also.. secret Seattle dressing! This should be an option, or perhaps a secret menu item for those who know... pleaaaase make this happen! \n\nAll in all, I will always support Glaze Teriyaki.", "author": "Alex E."}

I would recommend you to get either the combo rather than the bowls with less portion of the meat cause when i got the combo 1, it can be more filling. I think its more expensive if you dont get the combo since its lesser meat. \nAnyways, the meal that i got was average. It did have some flavors to the meat. You get that carbs from the rice and it does absorb from the sauce of the meat since they place the meat over the rice.\nThey have Sriracha on each table and by the utensils area if you like to have that extra spicy flavor to your dish.

Service is absolutely wonderful and it really makes the meal that much more enjoyable.\n\nI'm still not a big fan of teriyaki, but if I am going to have it, I'd go here and get the beef.

You have to order at a register, fill/re-fill your own water cup, and bus your own table, so it's definitely a fast food type of place despite the cost.\n\nIf I'm craving teriyaki, I'll probably just go to the many other Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood that charge about the same but provide you much more service.", "author": "Ryan E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-14", "description": "A delicious, filling and moderately priced lunch/dinner option in the Marina. For 11-12 bucks (if you don't opt for the absurd amount of meat in the double protein), you get a large amount of the main entree (we were pleasantly surprised by the portions of salmon our first time around), a complimentary large serving of brown or white rice and a smaller salad with your choice of dressing.\n\nThe menu isn't huge, you just get your teriyaki staples, but what more do you need? They give you the option to mix and match rice, your choice from a few dressings (I prefer the sesame) and you can split the entree between proteins for roughly the same price as any of them individually. The food comes out really quickly, and there is plenty of seating inside and out if you plan on sticking around (open air indoor benches on a Chestnut street corner are hard to beat). Everything is self serve (plates and water, utensils, etc) as well. \n\nGiven the more expensive options in the area, this is a solidly-portioned and tasty destination in the neighborhood.", "author": "Taylor C."}
