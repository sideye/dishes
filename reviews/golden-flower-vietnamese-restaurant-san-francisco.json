I mean there is the Golden Flower Vietnamese Restaurant, Golden King Vietnamese Restaurant and the Golden Star Vietnamese Restaurant all close to each other. By sheer chance I happened to try Golden Flower Vietnamese Restaurant first from the lot. It is located on Grant and Jackson so right in the middle of the tourist circuit. At the peak lunch hour on a Saturday it was about 40% full. Like other Vietnamese restaurants it has a trillion variations of Pho, bun and rice plates. I decided to get the Five spice chicken ($8.75) to-go.\n\nAfter ordering I waited for about 10 minutes at one of the open tables and then was off with my order. While paying I was surprised that I could pay by card which is very out of charter in Chinatown. I got a small size container with the Five spice chicken that was almost hidden under the serving of rice and two smaller containers with dipping sauce. The chicken and rice were both pretty good while the dipping sauce was terrific. Overall this was pretty good.\n\nAfter the good experience I came back to try the Five spice chicken noodle soup ($10.75) which is noodle soup plus the five-spice chicken. This time I found the noodles to be a little clumped together but they managed to open up when dipped in the broth. Overall not bad. During my third visit I decided to get the Chicken with lemongrass ($10.25) from the Dinner Special section of the menu. This time it was a disaster a small serving of rock hard pieces of chicken with over steamed rice.\n\nPrice wise it was pretty cheap and in-line with what you would pay at other Golden restaurants in Chinatown. My take is that they have the batch produced items like Pho and five spice chicken locked down but what needs to be cooked to order the kitchen surely falters. Considering the overall package of quality, price, service I feel that this is a 3.5-star type of place so I'm rounding that up to 4.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Or maybe I decided to use the cold as an excuse to get some pho. Either way, I came into the store at night and it was a quiet weekday evening with few customers inside. I was promptly seated and perused the menu, even though I came in determined to get some variation of the beef pho. However, I let my eyes wander and thought wouldn't it be nice to have some pho ga (chicken noodle soup) for a change? I gave in to my curiosity since I haven't had chicken pho in such a long time. \n\nMy pho came out within five minutes of my ordering it. I proceeded to savor the broth and then unceremoniously poured all my veggies into the pho. The pho ga (chicken noodle soup) was very delicious, and flavorful compared to other places. The broth was very clear, and there is a beautiful golden glow glistening as you can see in the picture below. I finished the soup and the noodles and left the meal fully satiated. Now, I'm not saying that I was cured by some chicken pho, but during the meal, I certainly felt a lot better. For ten dollars, this was deeply satisfying and left me feeling very full, which was a good thing since I had to brave the winds as I left the store.

Also, the restaurant features a huge variety of vegetarian meals as well as popular Chinese dishes- it's like a one stop shop for all! \n\nThe longstanding popularity (15 years) of this place is partly thanks to its location: one that is easy to stumble upon in the heart of San Francisco aka Chinatown.

Doesn't have all the meats that usually comes with this type of soup noodle. And to top that all off, they used the WRONG noodles (vermicelli noodles) instead of the thick round noodles normally in this! Couldn't finish it.\n\n-They water down their Hoisin sauce condiment!!

I use to come here so often but I haven't had the chance to until I came here for lunch today with a couple of friends who worked nearby.\n\nAt 12pm on a weekday, the place is pretty much packed. People who worked near by were coming in and out so there was no wait in line.\n\nI like how they offer \"only tendons\" with pho on their menu. Honestly, tendons are my favorite part of the pho and other restaurants don't have this option on their menu unless you request it. We know the food is fresh since our food came out about 15 mins after we ordered. At other pho places, they come within 5 mins when all they had to do is dump noodles and other goodies in a bowl with broth.\n\nI ordered a small for $6.70 which is enough for me for lunch during work hours since I wouldn't want to go back to work all bloated. However, my friends(guys) who ordered a large size says it wasn't enough for them. Each size up is less than a dollar more so don't be afraid to order a bigger size if you are really hungry.The soup was a little watered down I had to add extra herbs to create extra flavor for my liking. For the rest of the day, I had to drink a lot of water to quench my thirst which is probably from the extra MSG in their broth. Although it's not the best broth I had, the rice noodles were good. It was soft and smooth.\n\nThe service is pretty quick. They seat you immediately and take your order within minutes. All the workers were pacing back and forth.\n\nOverall, I would come back to grab a quick sit-down meal. This is a place for casualty, cheap food, and quick service.", "author": "Allie Y."}

Chinatown is a wonderful place, full of hustle, bustle and more intrigue than a John le Carr\u00e9 spy novel.\n\nYou can get whatever you want in Chinatown, so be careful about what you want.\n\nFortunately, all Vesta and I wanted was to find what we heard was the best Vietnamese restaurant this side of Saigon. We know it's Ho Chi Minh City now, but the guy we met at one of the Camera stores on the Wharf, who told us, was getting up there in his years and apparently he hadn't heard about the name change, though they did it an awful long time ago.\n\nAnyway, he told us about this Vietnamese Restaurant on Jackson Street in Chinatown, that was so very good and the way he described it, we just had to go. Unfortunately, he didn't know the name of it, but he said we'd be able to find it.\n\nAfter we found a parking spot and fed the meter, I took a photograph, then we started looking. And the guy was right, it took us about thirty seconds to find it. Actually, if you look at the far right side of my photograph, you can see the Golden Flower's blue sign.\n\nAt first we weren't gonna go in, because we were supposed to meet friends at Eat At Joe's back at the Wharf later for dinner. We just went looking for the restaurant cuz it was in Chinatown and we wanted to go there anyway and cuz it was like a challenge to see if we could find it.\n\nBut we did find it and we were there and maybe I was a tiny bit hungry, so we went in and had pho, a beefy noodle pho, which wasn't all that expensive and very, very tasty. And maybe even more than we should've eaten, considering our dinner plans.\n\nIt was a nice dining experience. The pho was delightful and we'll be back when we can don't have dinner plans for later and we can eat more and more and more.", "author": "Ken D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-21", "description": "Well just like the Koreans taking over Japantown, the Vietnamese are taking over Chinatown, just more slowly. \n\nThis is the third Pho (pronounced Fa-uh) restaurant I have eaten at in Chinatown, and funny, they are all named Golden something. (That would be \"Kim\" something in Vietnamese)\nAnd it is the 113th or 114th Pho Noodles restaurant I have eaten in and reviewed! (I lose count, there are so many!) Call me a Pho King Noodle expert! (\"Low Fan\", or \"outsider\" version though!)\n\nThis one benefits from being on the now busy lower Jackson street corridor in Chinatown. It's busy because Obama once ducked into the Great Eastern for Chinese food, and this has seemed to create a tourist frenzy that has spilled over to nearby establishments, even if they are Vietnamese. The fat tourists don't have to walk up the hills to Grant or Stockton on the verge of a heart attack to get here. And it is closer to FiDi.\n\nIt is narrow and long, with 3 rows of tables, quatres on the sides, community or quatres in the middle. The cashier counter is in the rear. \n\nI ordered Pho Tai Bo Vien, which is rare beef slices (Tai) with beef balls (Bo Vien). No, they weren't balls from cattle, they are little meatballs you can buy at any Ranch 99 market, and popular in Pho. \n\nThe broth was pretty clear, a good sign that flavor was cooked in, not added artificially. Still, i like a little more hint of anise in my broth, and this had a little more sour taste than many. It came out quickly and the condiments were fresh. The noodles were al dente, which was different, because many places over cook them and they become mushy and milky. \n\nThe owner is from Central Vietnam. She lived in Pleiku, Da Nang, Hue, and Nha Trang. Central Vietnam, or the Highlands region, is mountainous, cooler, and the food is spicier. Hue is the ancient capital near the old DMZ. Da Nang is popular with honeymooners due to cooler and pretty scenery. Pleiku was a US Air Base during the Vietnam war. Nha Trang (actually not quite central, more north part of South) is now a top tourist destination with a beautiful beach and a recent world beauty pageant held there. \n\nThe signature noodle dish from Central is Bun Bo Hue, a hearty stew like, spicy noodle soup with just about everything thrown in. Since the owner is from Central, I would suggest trying the Bun Bo Hue if you like that dish.   \n\nThe fact that this and the other Viet places in Chinatown are all called Golden something gives a hint that, although from Vietnam, these people may be part of the large Chinese diaspora that resided in Vietnam. Most Vietnamese Vietnamese places are named after a city (like those mentioned above, or Saigon, Vung Tau, My Tho and many others) or after an important year in history, like Pho 54 (1954, the year a young general named Ho Chi Minh defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu), or after the Vietnamese family, like Vien Huong, Huynh Hiep, and many others. (This would be like Tony Roma's, etc.) \n\nThe Vietnamese restaurants with names like Golden something in English, or Kim something something in Vietnamese (Pho Kim Long), are often Chinese-Vietnamese. They could be diaspora for generations, so it often doesn't show up in the food, and especially to the American or non-Vietnamese. But sometimes it does.\n\nBut perhaps they are called Golden something for the American tourists to remember, and for good luck. Most tourists from the midwest not exposed to Vietnamese food will still come into a restaurant like this looking for Chow Mien and fried rice. At least they can get egg rolls. (Cha Gio, pronounced Cha Yaw) and spring rolls (Goi Cuon, pronounced Goy Koon). \n\nVietnamese, like Chinese, is a Tonal language, so getting the pronunciation is only half the battle. The tone of each word is critical to the meaning. Their are 6 ways to say \"Ba\" in Vietnamese, and depending on the tone, it means 6 different things.  \n\nAlthough big brother to the north (China) has meddled with Vietnam through the ages, the Chinese in Vietnam were discriminated against as a minority, not unlike the other minorities in the region, like the Hmong, Mien, and others. In Saigon (Now Ho Chi Minh City), there was a specific large ghetto in the city called Cho Lon (still there) that is the Chinese district.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

Despite cramped quarters, a good amount of people indicated possible good food. \n  However, bad things happened from the outset. As we got seated, the young waitress/hostess spoke in vietnamese to (I assume) the owner and then said our dog was not allowed in. I responded that he is a service dog as his vest indicated. She wanted to see his certification. I responded there is no such thing and by law she cannot ask me for that. She and the \"owner\" went back and forth in vietnamese. The \"owner\" appeared upset and walked away to the kitchen.\n   Next, the bathroom and pathway to it was dirty, untidy, and in worrisome condition.\n   Finally, it is important to note that our two kids dont eat like adults. So, we ordered 3 large Ph\u00f4 soups to share amongst us. The older lady (owner?) came and said that for 3 orders she wasnt willing to seat 5 ppl at a large table esp. becuz she was expecting possibly a party of 8 at some point. We shared that she could seat us at a table that seats 5 ppl. She didn't want to. I said we are paying customers that had hungry kids. She said she was sorry but she didn't want to serve us. I repeated that she could seat us at an appropriate table. Confused (or perturbed) she walked away saying she had to figure something out.\n   My family and friends shared that they were uncomfortable there and were afraid what the restaurant would do to the food if we stayed. So, we left. Some people around us spoke to each other that it appeared that the real problem seemed to be that the restaurant didn't want a service animal in there restaurant.

Golden Era. Golden Buddha. I'm just waiting for Golden Girls, and in would walk the Vietnamese version of Rose Nylund telling stories about St. Olaf in the far north of the Mekong Delta. But for now, Jamie W. and I settled for Golden Flower, and \"settled\" is the right word since the pho was just not up to snuff...fo' sho. We came here just because down the block, Hunan Homes was packed with tourists off a bus on that particular Sunday evening. Alas, Golden Flower was comparatively with the veteran waitress leaning contently against the counter. \n\nOf course, I went for the signature pho, the extra-large $5.15 bowl of Xe Lua, which was a combination of rare slices of steak, well-done brisket, flank, tendon, and the proverbial beef balls (see photo). With all that going for it, I was expecting more, but the broth was watery and the noodles somewhat limp. Jamie had relatively better luck with the $5.25 Ga Cari Rice Plate, which featured stir-fried chicken mixed with carrots, onions, and bell peppers in a hot curry sauce (see photo). But again, it was a pretty standard dish, suitable for the quick fix we needed at the time. Honestly, the memory of Golden Flower is fading just as I'm writing this review, and with so many Golden choices around, you'll hardly suffer for missing this particular bloom. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...passable pho, just barely worth a pass\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...the standard Chinatown gig \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...served us, left us \nTOTAL - 3 stars...Golden but not golden...know what I mean?", "author": "Ed U."}

I got the extra large veggie pho with beef broth, and I must say, it's pretty flippin good. I came with a party of 9, and they seated us all comfortably. The only issue that is bringing this review down by 1 star is the service. Jesus Christ. The service here genuinely makes me cringe. They got our order right, but without a joke, we asked for water 4 or 5 times. Finally, my brother got up AND GOT THE WATER HIMSELF. That really showed how bad the service was, but the lack of service is made up with the flavor of the food. Quality is a little lacking, but you get what you pay for. I still believe that the best Pho in SF is \"Lovin Hut\" in the Westfield mall, but this place isn't bad either. I'm from LA (where everyone is a health freak) and so this felt a little unhealthy to me. It felt very sodium and MSG filled and was clearly not made with bone marrow, but I think that's what added to the strong, distinct, good flavor of the broth here. So I would give this place a try if you're in the area.", "author": "Eli K."}

Pretty damn good. Go with the medium size pho, it will fill you up like no other. You have to be pretty hungry to finish a large. BEWARE\n\nBun Bo Hue: BIM BO HIPPPPP. I love this stuff. Its this spicy broth with pork blood and rice noodles. If pho was the sweet girl next door, Bun Bo Hue would be the cool, hipster chick that lives across the street. You get it once in a while to get that extra flavor and kick. I prefer to get this noodle soup with the PHO noodles and not rice noodles because this noodle soup is suppose to have a lot of flavor but I think rick noodles don't soak up the flavor as well as the pho noodles; up to you. \n\nVermicelli: If you really feel like a skinny gal tonight, order this. Its basically a bed of lettuce coupled with mints and sprouts with a bundle of dry vermicelli blanketed with sweet, fish Vietnamese sauce. You can order it with spring rolls on top or bbq or shrimp....(list goes on and on...)

Nice hot bowl of pho + deep talks about life = awesome :D \n\nI'm not Vietnamese so I can't comment on whether or not the soup and preparation of the beef and noodles are legit. But I hear (and believe) it is. My first few visits here, I always got a #9 small (with well done flank?) because I'm not a huge fan of tripe or the uncooked beef slices. After awhile, I began to try their rice dishes which are really delicious! The boneless lemongrass chicken rice plate is served with sour & spicy fish sauce which I like to pour all over the chicken AND rice. Although the chicken was sometimes hard/difficult to chew, I still come back and order it again. \n\nTry to avoid rush hour (lunch time around 12-1pm) because during these times, I felt a little rushed to finish what I was eating quickly and leave for new customers to be seated. The owner (the woman behind the counter?) is really sweet, and I can tell she does her best to cater to tourists and new customers by introducing and explaining dishes. I'm a regular here so I don't get that special treatment. \n\nCompared to other pho places in SF (on Irving and down the alley to Golden King?), I think you get a lot more noodles here.", "author": "Winnie H."}

When it comes to food, you and I probably wouldn't think of anything else to eat besides Chinese food in Chinatown, right? Ah, but you see, that is where I am wrong.\n \nThis little gem has a lot to offer to me, to you, and anyone else that doesn't want to eat Chinese food in Chinatown. I was with a friend and I really wanted some noodles, particularly cold vermicelli noodles with meat, chopped up veggies, and the infamous sweet and tangy sauce poured all over it. I remembered looking up on Yelp for a place to eat in Chinatown and I bookmarked this place to give it a try. It was kind of difficult to find this restaurant among a midst of hundreds of restaurants clumped together on busy Chinatown streets, but I couldn't have been happier when I recognized the bright blue banner that read \"Golden Flower Vietnamese Restaurant\".\n\nI ordered what I was craving which was the vermicelli noodles with beef and imperial rolls, while my friend ordered the #1 large bowl of pho. His usual, as always. As we waited for our food to come out, I was fixated on the number of people that came in and out of the restaurant. This place was poppin'. I could tell this place was a popular joint because as one table cleared out, another group quickly came in to fill up the table. It was rather impressive. Before we know it, our food arrived on our table; it didn't take more than ten minutes for the food to come out.\n\nNeedless to say, the food was spot on and delicious. Golden Flower gets a golden star in my book. Or well, yelp account. Heh.", "author": "Annie S."}

I got the smaller pho combo with steak, brisket, tendon and tripe. The portion was pretty good, but my two male friends who (of course) ordered the large noticed that there wasn't too much additional food in their bowls. As another reviewer mentioned on here, a large pho means ridiculously large bowls but not larger portions.\n\nI liked the pho but I wasn't blown away. The meat was just all right, not too flavorful.

My friend and I were trying to get into The Great Eastern dim sum down the street, but the front desk guy was dicking us around so we left frustrated.

I found myself here last night for dinner.\n\nI usually stick with the pho, and this time I went for #1, the \"special combo with rare slices of steak, well-done brisket, flank, tendon, and tripe\".  It's considered the X-Large bowl at $5.50 and there are beef balls in this order too.  My friend had the #3, which according to the menu, was the Large size and it costs the same.  The only difference was that he didn't have beef balls in his.  I don't usually go for the X-Large, usually content with the Regular size more often than not.  I was starving last night and it was damn cold.  Well, it looked like a large too me and I wasn't particularly full when I left.  I guess when the price doesn't reflect an X-Large, then you shouldn't really expect one then, huh?  \n\nOverall, it was pho as you would expect it.  Nothing spectacular about it or bad either.

It was pretty solid. One thing I want to suggest is to have a bit better lighting. It's a bit dim. When it comes to pho, for some reasons I like to have it in bright light.\n\nOne thing I found about takeout and eat in at the 3 places is that the food tends to be more for takeout. But the experience to have it in a giant ceramic bowl with that scented steam broth going through the nose instead of the plastic tall container is simply unbeatable.\n\nI always love to have the pho at the restaurant but get the coffee in a to-go cup because there's no way you can wait for the coffee to drip completely and also drink until the ice is gone within 45 minutes. So it's best to take the coffee with you, to extend the consumption of some very strong chicory coffee.", "author": "T L."}

It is something that is understood by all.\n\nThis is pretty true at all pho restaurants. There is nothing wrong with going to this classic dish (or maybe I should say bowl).

But I am not here to comment on the pho or the spring rolls served at this restaurant.\n\nFor lunch I decided to forgo getting the #1 and instead settled on their Rare Beef Salad (the #30). And to my pleasant surprise this was absolutely delicious. They served thinly sliced pieces of beef dressed in lemon juice (with a side of fish sauce), fresh greens, and a heaping pile of roasted peanuts. It reminded me of a carpaccio dish, but a lot cheaper ($7) and without the snobbery. \n\nMy only knock on this dish is that it is kind of small. I am use to eating things from an XL bowl, so getting just a small plate full of food didn't seem to do it for me. \n\nIs the #30 my new #1?!

Definite good deal for a girl on a budget! \n\nThe bathroom is an adventure in itself- you have to walk downstairs and pass by the old vietnamese ladies cooking, then theres a small area next to the bathroom with a table and a ton of boxes. I always see these men playing cards and like to think they're part of some mafia buisness...\n\nBACK to the Pho.. delicious! And the service is always nice, and fast!

It was 9:10pm and we didn't know if they closed at 9:30pm so we drove quickly and found rockstar parking half a block down the street.  There were still customers inside but when we got to the door, the sign read \"9:00am - 9:00pm\".  We stepped in anyway and the proprieter lady waved us to a table (YAY!)  We'd been here once before and eaten something other than the pho so this time we went straight for the pho:  #7: rare steak and beef balls LARGE for me and Pho Ga - chicken pho for him, also LARGE.\n\nTea was served immediately and about 5 minutes later, 2 giant, steaming, bowls of pho were placed in front of us.  \n\nI don't know how they do it, the beef pho had abotu 6 good-looking pieces of steak, pink in the middle and lots of large beef balls.  The soup was so comforting and really hit the spot.  Of course, I topped it with beansprouts, lemon and peppers and sprinked the Siracha over the soup.\n\nI hate it when meat has dangly bits of fat and tendons and other oddities on it but the meat in both our bowls was nice and clean.  There was a generous amount of shredded chicken in the Pho Ga and some lettuce which would have been really good if there wasn't some brown bits on the edge - we picked that out.\n\nSoon the restaurant started to clear out, the proprieter making conversation with the last trickle of customers.  As they cleaned up, we hurried to finish our piping hot soup - but she called out to us to take our time and even topped up our water glasses (all past closing time!!)\n\nI love this place for having delicious, comforting broth: slightly sweet and really tasty and for being near to home.  I also like that they keep it relatively clean (sweeping the floor and wiping the chili bottles at the end of the day) and there is obviously lots of heart put into the restaurant.\n\nI would come here 3 times a week - if I got home in time. :)  at a previous visit, my husband got the 5 spice chicken which came with a bowl of soup noodles.  The bbq chicken was served on the side and was a fine piece of thigh meat: a never ending supply of relatively lean and clean chicken served on a lettuce leaf.

The cha gio came out after the pho, which wasn't really cool because cha gio is an appetizer, and it ended up being the last thing we ate, cause who wants to eat cold-ass cha gio while you are pounding piping hot pho broth?\n\nHowever, the egg rolls were tasty, fried well, and served with some rice vermicelli, crushed peanuts, and lettuce, which was nice to look at, but lacking since there wasn't enough of the extras to actually wrap each egg roll.\n\nWe all ordered small bowls of pho, and I noticed later that everyone else in the restaurant over the age of 8, ordered large bowls.  Maybe it was the lack of space in the small bowls, but I found my pho visually lacking something.  They did forget to put green onions in my broth, and what I had in front of me looked like a glorified bowl of instant pho that I make at home.  And glorified is actually being kind...it was a dead-ringer for packaged noodles with meat.\n\nBut to my surprise, the pho was actually pretty good.  The broth was aromatic and tasted like good pho broth should.  The noodles were cooked right and not too soft.\n\nHowever, when we get to the meat, my last problem I had with my pho appears, and that was that the rare steak slices were sliced too thick yet still somehow overcooked.  That's actually pretty hard to do.\n\nIf i lived in the neighborhood, I'd give it a few more chances, but I'd be surprised if the problems I experienced here were an anomaly.", "author": "Tony L."}

The cold noodles without soup, with grilled meat and vegetables were good.  \n\nThis place used to have the best pho I'd ever had in my life.  Then the old man got more elderly, and sick, and eventually he and his wife sold it to her cousin.  I recognized the cousin from when I went into Mayflower on Ocean once where there was pho advertised with the American diner food; it was barely pho.  (The cousin's sister now runs Mayflower.)\n\nHow can they be from the same general family?  It seems like she should have been able to learn from him.  Her pho improved from Mayflower, but the restaurant sank.  The business really dropped and then picked up some and maybe dropped.  If I'd never had old man pho, then it would be acceptable, but once you have the best you can't go back.  Still we went back sometimes.\n\nThen...\n\nThe last time we were there the food tasted like mothballs.  Why they are in a restaurant, I don' t know.  The person I was with didn't it notice as much until we asked for a container for the leftovers.  It reeked of mothballs.  \n\nThe worse thing that used to happen was that they forgot the meatballs several times when I got take out.  And there was the mass beef recall a while ago that the pho places couldn't participate in because their raw meat was all served.  But we never got sick there.\n\nWe are so incredibly sad that we'll probably never get that kind of pho again.  It probably died with the old man, if that's what happened.  It's almost hopeless to try.  We've given up expecting to find great pho again, just hoping to find something passable.\n\nAt one point, the old man's son ran Evergreen on Harrison.  I'd like to see what it's like if it's still there, although it's more of fusion of Vietnamese and Thai.  But even on the days the old man wasn't there the pho wasn't  as good, so it might never be the same.\n\nGranted this place has scary looking prep areas and and scary looking bathroom, but it was okay when the food was still great.  \n\nCash only.", "author": "e g."}

I say 99% because one time they either forgot to put suger or just didn't put enough and it was so salty, only ONE time.

Let's just say if you love soup, hot soup, and BIG bowls of soup, this is the place in SF. I learned to eat their Hiu tu tom cua (spelling? - seafood fish ball soup) by watching the native Vietnamese folks in the restaurant. Spoon in one hand, chopsticks in the other. Don't forget to mix in the fresh basil and careful on the fresh jalipeno! If you're in the neighborhood and want a hearty lunch on a cold SF day, definitely drop in. This is one hole-in-the-wall worth visiting!", "author": "Edward W."}

Portions aren't huge like it should be for a #1 extra large combination beef pho.

This city is so wonderful in that sense that you can go on the hunt for a: burrito, dim sum, Vietnamese sandwich and  other ethnic fast foods and practically never run out of places to go. I think Pho is up there too. There are probably hundreds of places to go to for Pho in this city. So seeing that they didn't sandwiches I walked out but before I could leave the door I saw somebody eating some Pho. I said \"damn pho!\" that pho looks good! So I sat down and decided to have a bowl. I did like that you can get a small size and a big size. Having gotten stoned the night before and having gorged myself on everything in my fridge, I decided that the smaller bowl would be best. I have had quite a few pho's in my time, and I have to say that this was some of the best broth I have had. Fantastico! So good. The ambiance is...well...its...Chinatown; what do you expect?! But that's not why you should come here. The pho was great and I would go just for that. I can only assume the other stuff on the menu is good to. Stay tuned...I will be back here.", "author": "Steve H."}

The place we wanted to eat wasn't serving what we wanted right then, so we just walked into this place. I saw the article on the front saying how pho is their best thing here, and I almost got pho... but I'm just sooo not a soup person at all. J does like it sometimes, but he still didn't get pho. He got a seafood combo that comes with rice noodles. His looked pretty good... sauce over the noodles, and a medium sized meal. He said it seemed like there was a lot of junk seafood like imitation crab in there. But it was ok. I had lemongrass pork and I substituted rice noodles for the rice (even though the waiter was SHOCKED and couldn't believe, for some reason, that I wanted this... is it really so weird??). I had almost gotten something with shredded pork, but he told me it was pork skin, rightly assuming I didn't want that. So that was nice of the waiter. My food was SMALL. A tiny bit of meal only taking half of the tiny plate. The other half was the noodles. The noodles were good. The pork was ok. Besides the reccomending that I don't want shredded pork, our service was pretty rude. Not overtly, but just an air of rudeness. Exasperated when we took too long to order. Ignoring us the whole meal. Talking loudly to each other when we wanted our check, instead of coming to bring it to us. Stuff like that. So, not too friendly, just ok food, small portions were all minuses... plusses were that we were seated right away (plenty of empty tables) and the number one plus was the PRICE. It was so cheap - $16 for two people. So, you get what you pay for. We were both very hungry after, so we went home and made cookies. PS cash only", "author": "Merredith L."}
