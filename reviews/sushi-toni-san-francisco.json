I was most offended when, after ordering red snapper nigiri, I bit into what was most certainly TILAPIA, which has that unmistakeable gristly, muddy taste, and is commonly used as red snapper substitute in Chinese speaking countries like Taiwan and Hong Kong where I grew up. I should've known better to order red snapper at cheap places (google it: Red Snapper is the most commonly mislabeled seafood in America, and often tilapia is passed off as \"izumidai\").\n\nSo yea, eating raw mud-grown tilapia - the pigeons of polluted farm waters - made me really gag.\n\nI suppose certain concessions must be made at this price point, but geez.", "author": "Ken H."}

Never fear, the poster in the kitchen says Sushi Toni has an \"A\" for hygiene. I was feeling hungry and ordered the dragon roll as well as the regular spicy tuna roll. I could actually feel the heat in the spicy tuna roll. I not uncommonly inhaled every last crumb of my food, so it was up to par.

The unagi nigiri was brought shortly after. The entrees took about 10 mins to arrive to the table. The portion was a little small for the price but the meat was very fresh and cut nicely. The beef could have been more tender and I would have liked more teriyaki sauce. The shrimp tempura was nice and crispy and not overly breaded. I really enjoyed the fried gyoza and it had a nice texture. My husband said that the unagi was very good. \n\nIn regards to customer service, it was okay. i think our waters were refilled once and we were only checked on once after all the food was brought to the table.

Seriously it makes no sense. \nI have only order a miso soup and a salmon roll then I left without looking back ( after paying off course ).\nMiso soup was absolutely tasteless; how is that even possible? I mean how can you mess up miso soup?? It was basically water with some tofu and maybe 3pieces of seaweed. \nSalmon Roll was also tasteless. Salmon is my absolute favorite food. I happily eat it in anyway but truly this was not so fresh and tasty, perhaps cause there was barely any in my roll! As of that wasn't enough sushi rice was way over cooked, kind of mushy and just Not good! The cheapness of this place is a huge Turn off. Didn't need or want to try anything else, cause if the basics are off, I m out!\nSushi, chef and waiter were kind and attentive, probably underpaid according to the direction given over the quantity/quality of the food served.\nIf you are looking for a good, affordable sushi then you are much much better off at Ono sushi!!! Will soon review it. I order the same thing over there and everything was great and very tasty. Particularly the salmon roll which is even 50cent cheaper the Sushi Toni yet was filling, super fresh and pretty abundant in salmon and the rice off course cooked as supposed to. Ended up ordering another salmon roll indeed , as I was very satisfied with it.\nI feel like mentioning Ono Sushi because as a true sushi lover I like to , at times, have more affordable options available. You know to satisfy that craving even after rent and bills were just paid \nSushi Toni is a scam. Was happy to have sushi right by my hotel but I m actually never coming back. I d rather walk a couple more blocks to Ono Sushi or even explore other sushi spot around me!\nMy warm suggestion is skip this and safe your $ for a much better sushi experience.", "author": "Hosna A."}

We finally settled on Akiko but had problems locating the hidden, nondescript storefront; we made our way inside, only to find that it was packed before 6pm and that reservations one week in advance are recommended o.O You can thus imagine our gratefulness to find the no-frills, authentic-looking Sushi Toni with no wait (there was a wait ~7pm when we left! I have a theory that the crowd always follows us)\n\nIn our post-SF-explorations hunger, we splurged on 2 appetizers and 2 rolls--looking at the extensive menu with pictures of specialty rolls just makes you hungrier.\n\n(+) Hamachi kama $12.50: Quite tender (though I've had better) and decent portion. You have to poke around to find the fleshy parts... I've never understood fish anatomy, especially the kama (collar)\n(+/-) Spinach oshitashi $5.50: Tasty with the tangy sesame sauce, but gone in a few bites. Such elusive oshi.\n(++) Caterpillar roll $11.50: Perfect balance of avocado and eel. The generous avo adds a nice buttery taste and texture.\n(+++) Lion King roll $10.50: Baked mozzarella cheese in a sushi roll sounds strange to me every time, but the Lion King is the comfort food of sushi rolls and Toni's version is flavorful and delightfully savory... like crab mac n cheese in fusion sushi roll form.\n\nService is friendly--we received an extremely sincere apology when there was a bit of the wait for the food. As you would expect, the server was a very nice mama-san, and the place has a family-run vibe.\n\nOverall, the food is good and the restaurant is clean. I would suggest going for sushi/sashimi and passing on appetizers, which are quite pricey and were responsible for racking up the bill to ~$45 for 2. (But then again, when have appetizers ever been a bargain? Why do I never learn)\n\nFun fact: This reminds me of my favorite sushi place in Mountain View, called Sushi Tomi (also no-frills and authentic). I wonder if Toni and Tomi are cousins :3", "author": "Edna C."}

I had to wait in line at the bathroom. There is one bathroom and it is unisex, it was pretty clean. I give kudos to places with clean restaurants. Anyways I came out and they asked if I was ready to order. The green tea there is good, except the service of waiter/wAitress is slow. I don't like places where I have to constantly call them to refill my tea. At any location, on average I can drink 7-8 cups of tea if not more. So at this location I only drank 2 cups and I had to request one time which is kind of disappointing. Anyways, we ordered 3 rolls California, Hannukah, and family affair. The California came wkrh6 pieces, overall it was great. The only thing was that the wasabi was not that strong, it was very under powered and eating a scoop is completely doable. Next came the family affair roll, wow it looked like a master piece of artwork. I really enjoyed taking pictures of it, the taste was unique as the top was spicier than the wasabi. I loved the sprouts on top, I felt like it was very well made. Next, we wanted to try another roll and my bf picked Hannukah it's made of salmon and salmon skin. When it came we were kind of surprised. The salmon skin was inside the roll and the top of the salmon was topped with 2 popping balls. I felt like it was very interesting, but the taste was a bit too strong for me, it was a little too salty. \n\nOverall if you ask me, I suggest iyakaza ninja that is a block away for some better sushi.", "author": "Amy Y."}

The atmosphere and service were less than okay, and the price was less than okay.  Go find somewhere else, as there are literally dozens of other options! \n\nI had a hankering for sushi, and Sushi Toni seemed to be a decent place to try, being close and supposedly cheap. It was really cool that their website had a digital copy of the menu, so I was able to take some extra time to look through and think about what I wanted to eat. \n\nService:\nI got there at around 5:20, as they open at 5pm. There were two other single customers sitting at the bar finishing up their meals, so I took a seat at the bar and waited! I should note that I made it all the way to almost being seated before a staff member addressed me, even though the chefs were behind the bar chopping away. I was helped rather quickly though and my food was prepared quickly, so that was nice! However, it seemed a little odd to be sitting right across the counter with the sushi chefs and never interact with them save for getting my plate handed to me. The staff didn't seem to give off a particularly welcoming attitude, and the sushi chefs were practically silent the entire time I was there!\n\nFood:\nI ordered a bowl of miso soup to start along with a spicy yellowtail roll and a specialty caterpillar roll. The miso soup was pretty good, although the tofu had no solidity at all. I guess that is just a preference though. I think I also bit into a piece of onion in the soup, which was an interesting addition I hadn't come across before. \n\nThe rolls were very interesting, to say the least. Really hit-or-miss. The spicy yellowtail roll came in six pieces and was pretty poorly rolled, unfortunately. Two or three of the pieces had the wrapper visibly cutting into the center of the roll, and fell apart upon picking up. They tasted okay though, but were nothing spectacular. \n\nThe caterpillar roll, on the other hand, was really good! A true sushi experience. In terms of texture, there's sliced avocado on the top that is super creamy and delicious, and the roll itself had a good mix of crunch and fish. In terms of flavor, it was something else. My first bite was unexpectedly sweet, and the remainder of the 7 pieces was similarly sweet and filled with flavor and texture. It was great!\n\nHowever, that bowl of miso soup, a regular roll, and a specialty roll ended up being over $21 for just me, so it definitely wasn't the cheapest sushi I've ever had (which was two starters, miso soup, two regular rolls and three specialty rolls for ~$50 between two people)", "author": "John B."}

The reviews are completely opposite, some are extremely positive and some are even 1 star only. Oh well, I decided to give it a taste and did not regret at all.\nFirst of all, the place is cozy and lovely, unlike others yelped that too small or corky. The sushi chef and most of the staff are Koreans, except for two Mexican sous chef. I guess, they just make the name Japanese;) but knowing they are Koreans, I was relief coz some reviews said they were sick or so after eating.

You probably order a Cali roll, the biggest of them all, but usually, rolls are not supposed to be to big. A even mouth size is fine. I love it! Like many recommendation, Romeo-Ju rolls are the best!!! Must try. Salmons were fresh. Yellowtail fin weren't so much but taste alright.

It is the \"go to\" owned and operated by a wife and husband combination. The fish is always fresh and extremely well prepared. It's not a fancy place but the fresh food overtakes the atmosphere.

One of them suggested \"a pretty solid sushi place with no wait near my apartment\" to which I responded \"There's no wait? That's crazy. Let's go!\" And that's how we ended up at Sushi Toni at 6:30pm on a Wednesday. And he was right, there were plenty of empty tables! How does a place in SF have 4 stars and still plenty of empty tables at dinnertime, I have no idea. I'm actually a little worried that if I write this review and hype it up too much, that might change...\n\nIn any case, Sushi Toni serves pretty decent sushi at pretty decent prices. It's pretty unassuming and a little hard to find, but in a good location near downtown. The atmosphere is quiet, calm, and \"homey.\" Definitely nothing fancy, but I appreciate that (and I think it's reflected in the prices). The sushi is pretty high-quality and fresh, with well-portioned sizes. The rolls have a bit too much flavoring/sauces for my taste, but I could tell the fish was pretty fresh. Probably just means I should order nigiri next time. In any case, I think the food is more along the lines of 3.5 stars, but I'm bumping up to 4 just because of how easy it is to just walk in and get seated.\n\nHead over to Sushi Toni when you want a convenient and quick fix of sushi without busting your wallet.", "author": "Brittany C."}

Your quintessential sushi restaurant, complete with framed anime posters, a good roll selection and kitschy t-shirts.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were looking for sushi close by and as others have said, that's surprisingly difficult in one of the busiest areas of the city. We were desperately hungry, so my expectations were low, but I was pleasantly surprised when we were greeted with excellent customer service and seated right away. The food was good, I had the swamp roll and he had the sushi combo. I am the most heinous person to take an order from because I am gluten free, but our server handled my questions like a champ. He even, unprompted, brought out a bottle of gluten free soy sauce. Gluten free soy sauce!! It's a thing, and as a wheat-averse person, I was almost moved to tears. \n\nI also thought the prices were very fair, maybe even cheap for San Francisco, at least in my experience.

I'll break it out into a few categories. \n\nAtmosphere: 6/10\nThe decor was interesting, weird yellow sponge paint that was a little assaulting to the senses, and an eclectic mix of picture frames filled with images of either animated Japanese schoolgirls, stills from Pokemon, or cuts of fish. The music seemed incongruous as well and featured a mish-mash of late 80's/early 90's one hit wonders. If you like to listen to *slightly too loud for conversation* ABBA, New Radicals and hear \"Come on Eileen\" at least twice in the span of a meal, this is certainly your place. \n\nService: 3/10\nThey seemed genuinely concerned and kept asking how we were and if everything was ok while we were eating our appetizers (miso soup and salad) but that seemed to expire very shortly as it took over 30 minutes for me to receive my SINGULAR roll. My boyfriend however received his Chicken Katsu in about 5 minutes which lead to him picking at it for 25 minutes as it got cold to be polite and wait for me. When I asked the waitress what the deal was, it seemed that she forgot to put the order in, and as soon as she went up to check with the sushi chef it was miraculously ready in seconds. \n\nFood: 8/10\nI was angry eating by the time I received my food, but it was truly very good quality. The sushi rice was nicely spiced and adequately sour, and the crab salad and spicy tuna were of better quality than most comparably priced locations.  \n\nSo if you are an extremely patient ABBA loving sushi connoisseur with a penchant for the color yellow, be sure to hit up this spot. If not ... don't .", "author": "Hailey H."}

After establishing that his mother tongue is Mayan (WOW) I got in an order for some of the most delicious sushi of my life. Do you see me posting any pictures of it? No? Because I inhaled it immediately upon arrival. The best-prepared, most succulent and fresh sushi of my whole life. I've run into chewy sushi before, sometimes accompanied by lukewarm rice (I seriously just shuddered at the memory), and it's made me die a little bit inside. This fish was perfect. \n\nMine was an insanely-priced dinner meal (under $25) for a roll and at least 8 pieces of sashimi. All the while Rogelio entertained me in Spanish, no less. We talked about his training, the insane cost of living in CA, and how to make it in America. The whole thing was a flippin delight.\n\nAre you still reading this? You shouldn't be.

Because it's convenient, the people are friendly, I don't feel rushed, and the food is solid.

No, I can't say honestly that it is. But it's good. And comfortable. And no matter what, I always end up looking forward to dropping in for a bite.

I know spicy tuna roll, how wow could that get? BUT WOW. it wasn't the can tuna. It was actual cuts of good tuna. It melted in your mouth and they just have a way with their fish. Udon portions are large and the soup warmed me right up. It's not the kind of soup where it's just soy sauce and some other spices, it's actual udon soup. \n\nService was great, server asked if he could take the dish with wasabi and ginger.

Another person in my party ordered the 49er roll and it was made with way too much rice. My kids got the California roll and shrimp tempura.

I've been here a handful of times, and each time I have had a pleasant experience. \n\nThe service is lovely - perfectly friendly yet laid back. The kind of place that takes a second to wrap your hot sake bottle in a napkin. The dining area is clean, and has that cozy sushi-humility that I gravitate towards. Two basic requirements. I even sort of like the CD that always seems to be on repeat - nothing like Al Green and the BeeGees to complement your raw fish. \n\nThe food is nice -- it's definitely fresh and tasty, but it hasn't knocked my sushisocks off yet. The nigiris are alright. I find they lack the moisture that exceptional nigiris have in the fish itself and in the texture of the sushi rice. I also miss the detectable yet subtle lick of wasabi. \n\nI usually head for the sushi combos which offer either a smattering of sashimi or nigiri paired with salad and miso soup. It's a little pricey coming in at $15, but you get fresh fish, yummy salad and decent miso. \n\nThe rolls are dependable, and you are offered the basic set of rolls along with a few special ones. In the basic department, you have the Dragon Roll which is decent. It has a little too much artificial crab for my taste, and is a little heavy on the avocado. It also clocks in at around $14. Maybe the price is due to the eel which I hear is quite unsustainable, but that's just a guess. \n\nThe Crunch roll is interesting -- it is wrapped in white soy paper instead of the traditional nori, and it is practically buried in fried flakes. It's definitely tasty, but the combination of the white soy paper and the huge pile of fried toppings kind of throws me off. \n\nI was a fan of the 49er Roll which features salmon garnished with lovely thin slices of lemon. Perfect flavor and not too inundated with extra ingredients. I've been a fan of the seaweed salad -- it's the perfect amount to give you a taste of this delectable Japanese dish. Crunchy, savory, comforting, delicious. You can get some special stuff here -- a friend of mine once had live uni. I am not at that level of food bravery yet, but he swore it was a wonderfully tasty experience. \n\nNot a go-to place in my San Francisco sushi-book just yet, but if I'm with some buddies in the area and we have sushi-sized holes in our tummies, we'll probably head here for a cozy experience with great service and fresh ingredients.", "author": "Chelsea B."}

My girlfriend and I were served water once, and never received a refill throughout dinner. The place was half full, and it was an early dinner - 6pm on a Friday. When you're eating spicy sushi and sampling a vast array of rolls, cleansing the palette is key. After we finished, our waitress glanced at our plates (with napkins on them! hello!) twice after I had to flag her down to get the check. Once I got it, I had to flag down again to get her to take it to the register.

The place was empty except for a large party which probably thought they would be the ones to close Sushi Toni out. They were mistaken; no one is later than I.\n\nThe dining area is divided between the large main section and the bar, which has a few tables situated nearby. My girlfriend and I sat at a table by the bar and promptly ordered:\n- a large Kirin\n- a small carafe of hot sake (I didn't check the name)\n- miso soup\n- nigiri: sake, maguro, hamachi\n- special rolls: Hannukah, Volcano\n\nThe service was speedy and the waitress friendly. The hot sake was piping. Mm.\n\nThe nigiri was fresh, and the cut size larger than average, which is rare for a sushi joint; in my experience, the restaurants serving large pieces of fish are compensating for poor quality. Sushi Toni is the exception and their hamachi nigiri is especially good.\n\nThen came the Hannukah roll, an salmon skin cut roll (\"circumcision roll\"?) topped with smoked salmon and salmon roe. If you like salmon, this is the one for you. Crunchy skin, smokey fish, and that creamy texture of rice and bursting roe.\n\nFinally, the Volcano roll, served on a hot plate. Baked crab, avocado, tobiko, 2 kinds of sauce, and green onion. This one was tasty, and it was good to finish on a hot dish. The crab was plentiful -- definitely the centerpiece of the roll. It was a bit heavy with the sauce, which was sweet, spicy, and thick. Good, though.\n\nI would return to Sushi Toni to test the limits of their fish and to explore some of their special rolls, of which they seem to have many.", "author": "Jackson G."}

The fish here was very fresh. I came here for dinner without reservations and my party got seated at the bar. The chef talked to us and entertained us with random stories. You can tell he really has a passion for creating the rolls. The rolls here were very good. Perfect balance of sauce and fresh fish. I don't like when sushi rolls are drenched in sauce and you can't taste the ingredients. That's not an issue here. \n\nThe Romeo & Juliet roll was very good. I also liked the Lion King roll. The chef was particularly proud of the Lion King Roll and he told us that it's unique in that it has a combination of 5 different cheeses, which are: Brie, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Parmesan (?), and another one I don't remember. He said that they only use good mozzarella, not the crap that most people are accustomed to. The cheese gave the roll a unique flavor. The volcano roll was very good as well. I highly recommend it for those that like a mild spicy kick. The spicy flavor doesn't come out until you're done and it's balanced with the sweet/savory ingredients. Yum! \n\nThe service here is very warm and friendly. The waitress made sure that our cups were always filled with warm green tea. It's a little bit of an uphill trek from Union Square but absolutely worth it. I've tried a lot of sushi places in the surrounding area and this is the best I've tried and the prices are reasonable for the quality, as well as comparable to surrounding sushi restaurants. It's next to a porn theater but the area is perfectly safe. No shady characters and it doesn't smell like pee, which I can't say the same for most of the neighboring streets!", "author": "Nancy C."}

Imitation crab was used. Also ordered two rolls- the Naruto roll $14 and Romeo & Juliet roll $12.50. The R&J roll was salmon, rice and avocado wrapped in soybean paper topped with a large scallop in a light eel sauce. It was really really good! I loved it!

The volcano roll (and I can't believe I'm going to say this) had just too much sauce. I love sauce. I love it all over things (and my face).

I wonder if they give plastic cups because of a poor experience of someone dropping a sake shot straight through glass....\n\nAnyway, their fish is consistently fresh, and their rolls are always constructed well. There's only one bathroom, but the building is small, so it's not usually hard to go when you need to.\n\nI'll admit, it's in a kind of shady area (I remember the building next to it was advertising male strippers, haha) but it's always a good experience.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

(Crab, Avocado, Salmon, with baked Mozzarella Cheese!!!)  It might sound a little weird, but don't be a fool, get it anyway!!!  This is one dish I don't recommend sharing with your table to anyone who didn't get it - if you do, you should expect intense envy or outright/brazen food stealing.

Sadly, my bf and I were so disappointed by our experience at Sushi Toni.  First off, the service was unbelievably slow.  They had 2 waitresses with only 4 tables occupied, and yet we waited over 20 minutes to order.  Both waitresses would brush by and avoid eye contact, ignoring your signals to get their attention.   \n\nAt first the prices seem kind of moderate for sushi, until you see how little food they actually serve you.  I think if you tally it up by the ounce, this may be the most expensive sushi around.  Not nearly the best quality, though. \n\nProbably the worst thing is that the dining area is SWARMING WITH FRUIT FLIES!  Really bad.  We were constantly batting them away from our food, and they swamped the sakki so bad they were all over the bottle and IN the sakki!  When I pointed it out to the waitress, she apologized and brought another bottle, and said the sakki was free.  I thought this a nice gesture...that is until she turned around and charged us for it.  When we pointed this out on our bill, the very same waitress told us it's a charge and we had drank some of the sakki.  I mentioned again it was swarming with fruit flies the whole time.  She offered to 'take care of it' and I thought maybe this time she would.  Instead, she took $2 off the price.  So, that's how much we tipped the bish.  \n\nSeriously, these people need a new attitude.  And an exterminator!", "author": "Leslie F."}

Why, you ask? Lemme tell you why. Not only did the boy and I enjoy some bomb@ss grub, but we did so to the tunes of the aforementioned, as well as Jon B, Shai, H-Town, New Edition and more of the smooth R&B jams I used to bump when I was in my teenage-angst phase.\n\nSo imagine my delight when I walked into this tiny, cozy restaurant right by Union Square and the first thing I hear is, \"Ahhhh, yeah....Give me some good love (some body rockin, knockin da boots)...Some body rockin baby, Give me some good love (some body rockin, knockin da boots)\" Uh-huh. Word. This place is the truth. But five star review for the music aside, this place was a real surprise. I don't expect much in terms of quality or value at any restaurant in the vicinity of Union Square. But Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! (yes, I will refer to this place as such from now on) is both yummy and affordable.\n\nOur meal breakdown:\n\n* Romeo & Juliet Roll- absolutely delicious! This roll is described as salmon & avocado inside with scallops on top. Now I am not a fan of raw scallops, or scallops in general, but this roll was SO good! And for $9.95, there were at least 7 or 8 pieces! The salmon slices were fresh and perfectly complemented the avocado squares. Again, the scallops were delicious. Almost melted in our mouths!\n\n* Chirashi- This is the boy's go-to Japanese order. Always. Anywhere. Anytime. This is his barometer. Chirashi (chef's choice of sashimi-styled sushi atop vinegared rice) at Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! was amazing! Unlike other Japanese restaurants, they served their Chirashi in a longer, but more shallow bowl. Most places serve it in a bowl (kinda like what you would eat udon or cereal out of). Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! gave generous portions, thick (but well-cute sashimi slices) and they put furikake (AKA the salt & pepper of Japan- it's got sesame seeds, spices, and seaweed) atop the vinegared rice. This extra flavoring took this Chirashi plowl (plate + bowl = zinger!) to another level. Definite re-order. MUST TRY THIS, PEOPLE! $18.\n\n*  Nabe Udon- Sadly, $12.50 cannot buy you much these days. Especially for Japanese. That's what- 2 1/3 pieces of sashimi at some uppity joint? Or maybe 7/8 of a specialty roll? Well at Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! , $12.50 bought me all that is good and right in the world.  This dish takes a while to make, so if you are super starved, you may need a starter to tide you over til the real deal. The nabe udon comes out in a hot iron mini-pot. It is hot (I know this because I am lame and touched it even though the waitress said not to). Every bit is filled with something: chicken, calamari, shrimp, mussel...you name it, it's there! Most Japanese places are hella shady about their nabe ingredients. You may get ONE shrimp or ONE clam, but definitely not the infinite portions i received at Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!!! And the broth was simply divine. Not too salty, but perfectly flavored.\n\n*** each entree comes with salad  and soup (tho noodles will not get miso soup since you're eating soup as an entree ***\n\nMiscellaneous Mentionings-\nThere were lots of 20 and 30-somethings in the restaurant when the boy and I went. Many of whom had a little too much Sake. One table went buckwild when \"Rumpshaker\" came on. One dude walked up to a girl at another table and threw his number at her (she didn't take it). All through this, the waitresses and sushi chefs stayed professional and friendly.\n\nSo aside from reliving my junior year of high school by listening to the grooves of the 90s, I got fed and fed WELL. This place is a definite revisit. \"FICKLE ONE\"- APPROVED. Betta recognize! =)", "author": "A A."}

I ordered take out (4 rolls, 2 miso soups and a salad) for my boyfriend and I. The woman on the phone was super nice and said that it'd be a 25 minute wait AND she asked if that was okay. Giving them 2 stars just for that courtesy. \n\nI, of course, said that was alright. The food was ready when I arrived and the woman was super nice and quick. The ambience isn't spectacular - pretty standard, small sushi place - but the food definitely makes it worth going here (or at least ordering from here). \n\nArriving home, we opened up the bag to some of the most delicious-looking sushi we've ever seen. We ordered a Red Dragon roll, a Spicy Tuna roll, a B.T.S. roll and a 49er's roll. The Red Dragon was unbelievably good - a must order.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nI totally forgot to mention how delicious-TASTING the rolls were too. If you're familiar with my Zushi Puzzle review, you'll understand just how good this place is- it's definitely on par with Zushi.", "author": "Cristina P."}

Well 2 stars is not terrible but I felt like I really needed to write this review because the current 4 star rating is so completely misleading that I can not in good conscience let people think that is place is at all 4 star material. \n\nIf you are like me, then you know that 4 stars on yelp means this is great stuff, and generally yelp does not fail me.  I was so disappointed by this restaurant not because in my opinion it is 2 stars but because so many people gave it 4 stars or higher.\n\nI ordered the eel over rice, a dragon roll and two sushi rolls.  You know the distinct feel of when a roll has too much densely packed rice as if the owners are deliberating making the rolls more filling?  Yep this place does that.  OK so fine, a lot of places do that, at worse that would be the sign of an average 3 star place you say?  \n\nHere is where I knock off a star to bring it down to 2 stars.  They had to audacity to give me a salmon roll with literally no sushi in it.  I was literally was about to take my roll to the owner and ask him, to look at it and tell me if it was even possible to have any less fish than that roll did.  I am 28 and have lived in major cities all my life eating at sushi restaurants and have never had a roll presented to me with as little fish as that roll I had there and even that, I wouldn't have cared so much if I didn't see that Sush Toni has an average 4 star rating...either these reviews are full of shills or these people have no idea what good sushi is.  Seriously people, I am by far not a snob, but this 4 star non sense is just so plain ridiculous.\n\nService was friendly.", "author": "dan k."}

The waitress instead suggested the \"49ers\" roll because it also had salmon (not smoked). I accepted her suggestion without reading the description carefully. It included raw, thin slices of lemon including the rind on top, which I didn't particularly care for. There's a reason we don't normally eat lemon rind.\n\nI also ordered the \"Lion King\" roll, which was baked (!) with crab, avocado, salmon, and mozzarella cheese (!!). I'd never had hot sushi before, and it was, well, interesting. When the fish is cooked, the dish is hot, and it is topped with oh-so-Japanese mozzarella cheese, I think sushi stops being sushi and becomes an artfully plated fish entree with rice. Nevertheless, it tasted quite good.", "author": "Adam B."}

The fish was not very fresh and many of the pieces tasted too fishy.  Some of the pieces tasted as if they had been frozen.  We ordered a sashimi combo dinner which included 12 pieces of assorted fish (chefs choice).  There were no special fishes, just the usual tuna, salmon, yellowtail, etc.  Again some of it fishy, some of it has a weird color and texture (as if it was frozen).  We also ordered a couple of specialty rolls.  Word to sushi places, ease up or don't use mayo.  I don't know why this has become a convention in sushi places, but I have found that the good ones don't use much if any mayo at all.  Honestly the texture and the throat feel of mayo makes the sushi taste even more fishy and less fresh.  Good  fish should stand on its own and in my opinion leave you with a fresh and crisp feel after  the meal.  This place used too much mayo in their sauces for the rolls.

The current owner also previously owned Tempura House around the corner, which is now replaced by Mari Sushi. Sit by the sushi bar, and he will make sure you feel right at home. I don't know if that's his personal style, but that's the thing with newly opened businesses: the service is usually extraordinary. He's an avid green tea drinker, so you can strike a conversation with him on that!\n\nI order the saba nigiri, albacore nigiri, Hanakah roll (salmon skin, smoked salmon, Ikura), and Swamp roll (wakame salad and spicy tuna). Everything was excellent. The chef/owner also wanted us to try his special miso soup. They just got their liquor license a few days ago, and sake and soju are on their way.

The food was average-plus. Like a B-. I got what I needed:  a post-happy hour sushi fix. The service was fast and friendly. In addition to the sushi, I ordered a plum wine. Standard price but not a standard size. It was miniature, so boo on that. My husband also said that his Sapporo was overpriced.

May not be the best sushi I've had... but still very good and I will definitely be visiting Toni again.  He's friendly, funny, and knows how to show his customers a good time.  A great first visit. \n\nMe: \"Spicy scallop please!\"\nToni: \"Eh no no. I have fresh scallop today. Even better.\"\n\nAs we finished our miso soup a lovely open shell arrived.. half filled with scallop nigiri..  half filled with dipping sauce.. Then they took the left over scallop trimmings, sliced it with some veggies and turned it into tempura.  \n\nToni: \"Good?\"\nMe: Good. \n\nThe scallops were fresh, although sliced a little too thin for my taste, and I personally do not like lemon slices with my fish but can't deny good craftmanship and quality. \n\nA few more minutes.. down came a platter of salmon sashimi.  I prefer the fatty buttery melt-in-your mouth pieces.  Toni gives you the cleaner slices that have a nice bite to them.  Personal preference. \n\nWhite tuna appetizer platter next. Very nice presentation of colors. My favorite plate of the evening, when I generally don't even care for tuna. Great texture with the fish ever so lighty brushed with a blow torch. Flavor was fab. \n\nToni: \"Good?\"\nMe: \"MMHMMM!\"\n\nLion king and dragon roll followed.  The sashimi portions were so large that my date and I were struggling already.  Dragon roll was standard but lion king had a nice twist using mozeralla cheese instead of just the mayo-based sauce.  \n\nCatching on to my loyalty to rich fatty goodness.. Toni treated us to some black sesame ice cream which was one of the best I've had.  \n\nToni :\"OOH. I don't need to ask.  She likes this one\"\nDate: \"Yea.. it's gone and I've only had one bite.\"\nMe: \"nom nom nom.\"\n\nA shot of saki and $75 bucks later (pre-tip).. we were in a good place.. stuffed and waiting for our tummies to settle so we could devour our leftovers.", "author": "Beatrice T."}

Tuna, white tuna, onions, cucumber, green onions, and tobiko.  All the ingredients seemed very fresh except the tobiko came off as a little stale and hard.  It just felt like i had a bunch of mini-BBs in my mouth.\n\n49'ers Roll:  Salmon, simo, avocado, tobiko, and lemon.  The lemon is sliced meticulously thin and placed on top of each individual piece of sushi.  Great taste as the mixture of the juicy lemon slice combines with the Salmon.\n\nWell there it is, I was in-and-out in a jiffy and wasn't displeased with the price but again, I was still bitter from an upsetting defeat on our home turf and would have given Sushi Toni more stars if it cured my depression of the night.\n\nB - OK", "author": "William F."}

We aren't even talking real crab meat!! The rice was hard and roll was teeeeny. Not worth $5.\n\nThe tempura tasted like the oil they used was 4 years old. The batter wasn't very good and the rice that came with the meal was cold and crunchy. The miso soup they served was bland and tasteless; it needed WAY more miso.

I was given regular tuna & yellowtail which he assumed I wanted after asking me if I liked that - which I said, \"Yea...h I suppose.\"\nOn that note the other \"Family Affair Roll\" I ordered was similar portion-wise, so that tells me that the \"Chef's Special Roll\" DEFINITELY was NOT worth $15.00!\nWorse of all, me & my daughter experienced an dull ache in the stomach afterward as if the food wasn't clean... I know this could be an isolated case, but I wanted to note that anyway.\nWe were polite & didn't say anything - I regret that. This review wouldn't even surface actually if not for the stomach ache we experienced.

If you're in this neighborhood, you should try this place out. Looks very tacky and small but the sushi is worth every $$", "author": "Rishi K."}

We were the only patrons at 8pm\n2. The owner's friends (with their rather loud and annoying 5 year old daughter) were lounging near the bar\n3. The california roll was falling apart\n4. The fish quality was good\n5. The service & price was good\n6. Simon & Garfunkel = fun!\n\nI won't go back; I was disappointed b/c of the good reviews I read on here, but I wish we had gone to the one around the corner.\n\nps. Family Affair was NOT good. Be careful with the special rolls :)", "author": "k t."}

He's funny, interesting, and surely will entertain you.  Sit close to the sushi bar.  We had the baked salmon roll, salmon teriyaki, vegetable tempura, and vegetable udon.", "author": "Zach S."}

Sushi with nacho cheese, all bad", "author": "Elroy M."}

The sushi were small and had very little meat and alot of rice. The price of these rolls weren't cheap also; the most expensive roll we ordered was 13.50 for eel and rice (literally). I guess I'm just spoiled with other sushi restaurants.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

There are a ton of sushi restaurants in this neighborhood but Sushi Toni is the best! I have a friend who lives in the Mission who walks all the way here just to get their avocado rolls. Great food for great value.", "author": "Lindsay D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-26", "description": "The best sushi I have had in SF hands down ( with the exception of Sushi Ran which is actually Marin but just thought I would mention it!!). The fish is fresh and delicious and the cooked foods are amazing as well. I have had the Udon, terriaki, tempura and all are amazing.  I am a bit of a sushi snob and am often surprised that I can find great sushi in this city.  Now I have found my favorite Sushi restaurant in SF!    oh and dont forget to try the Black Sesame Ice Cream! wow.  Delicious!!", "author": "JEFF B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-23", "description": "Sushi Toni is a nice sushi place in the city with a really friendly staff.  The sushi was well prepared.  The place isn't huge but we had no issues getting seating.  The dinner combinations are a pretty good deal, and I thought the salmon and tuna sashimi I got was very tasty.  We also ordered a few rolls including a rainbow roll which was quite good.  The chef came out at the end and even shared a few stories with us, which were quite funny and amusing.  Overall, it wasn't unreasonable - probably you will spend about $20 or so per person.", "author": "Larry C."}
