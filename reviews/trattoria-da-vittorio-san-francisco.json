During this visit we started with the antipasto misto for two and for entrees ordered the squid ink risotto with seafood and the gnocchi with gorgonzola cream sauce. The appetizer was fine, it had 4 pieces of cheese, 4 toasted slices of baguette and 6 pieces of cold cuts draped over arugula. I thought it was overpriced for what we got. \n\nOur entrees came out maybe 25 min after the appetizer was cleared. It was a loooong wait and we saw the waiter specifically ask the cook where our food was. When it finally did arrive without any acknowledgement of the long wait we were underwhelmed. The gnocchi were really heavy vs light and fluffy and the sauce was a little too thick. The risotto was topped with shrimp and scallops. The rice itself tasted good, but not creamy like other risottos. The scallop tasted off like it had a very alkaline taste to it. We thought perhaps because it was an old frozen scallop that perhaps had a lot of preservatives - so it was left on the plate. \n\nWe also came home with a bit of a tummy ache. After this visit, I think we'll stick with our regular Italian spot up the street.  On the plus side, their wine pours are generous and the restaurant itself seems very kid friendly.", "author": "Angelito R."}

I am a bit torn on my review...the food was amazing as was the wine. Our service was amazing when we could get it. I had the mushroom ravioli and the BF had their lasagna and we both absolutely loved our meal. The wine was great for the BF who drank his and mine after the waiter brought me something more to my liking (I asked if they had something with a bit more spice to it and he knew just what to bring - a 2013 Nebbiolo from Piemonte). \nNow, let me say a few things about the service in general; I was on crutches and on my way back from the restroom upon our arrival when a bus boy AND a waitress pushed past me (the waitress actually stepped on my foot as she pushed past me) just to get to the table I was JUST about to pass. After the waitress stepped on my foot, it wasn't until I stopped, hesitating taking a sec to collect myself so I didn't just go off on her, did she turn around realizing what she did and apologized. It was too late by that point. I was hoping this gal wasn't going to be our waitress...she wasn't. We had a very nice, knowledgeable gentleman instead. \nThe other thing was that we had finished our small glasses of waters we were given upon our arrival and we couldn't for the life of us get anyone's attention to refill our glasses. We did catch the eye of the man who was at the brick oven but he never did alert anyone to our needs that we know of. Finally someone did come by, bringing us a carafe of water so that we could pour our own as needed. \nAfter these 2 incidents, everything else was lovely...well except the constant phone ringing behind my head. We were seated at a table right up front near a window which we thought would be nice but didn't realize that a phone with a pretty obnoxious ringer would be in my ear during the whole dinner. That did not make for a pleasant atmosphere. \nWe would go to this place again but with the previous experience in the back of our mind. Don't sit up front by the window, it's not the best place to come if you have are on crutches or can't get up and down their aisle to and from their restroom quickly and ask for the water carafe in the beginning just in case.", "author": "Michelle F."}

This cozy restaurant serves a variety of authentic Italian dishes and offers quite a few vegetarian options. Our server, Niko, was friendly and welcoming, and made us feel right at home. We ordered the Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli, the Eggplant Parmigiana, the Uovo pizza, and the Nutellino. \n\nThe Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli was our favorite dish of the night. The black truffle cream sauce was phenomenal. The truffle flavor was prominent but not overpowering, and the sauce was rich and creamy. The ravioli was chewy, with a delicious mushroom filling, but the sauce was something else. Definitely worth coming back for.\n\nI also enjoyed the Eggplant Parmigiana. The eggplant was tender and flavorful, and went well with the delicious red sauce and savory cheese. All the ingredients melded perfectly.\n\nThe Uovo pizza was a bit disappointing. This pizza is topped with egg, pancetta, wild mushroom, and buffalo mozzarella. We ordered it without the pancetta because my friend is vegetarian, and probably lost a lot of flavor by doing so. The crust was pillowy and airy, but the flavors didn't stand out and the runny egg kept falling off when we tried to eat the pizza. :/ It's probably best not to tamper with the original recipe.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Nutellino, which is a homemade calzone stuffed with Nutella chocolate. The light, fluffy crust was stuffed with rich and gooey Nutella. Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't stop eating because it was so good. Our waiter also gave us a complementary slice of tiramisu. The tiramisu tasted pretty traditional to me, and I liked that it wasn't too sweet.\n\nWe came here on a Saturday around 8 pm. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away. We found a metered spot pretty easily (free because it was late). The ambiance is cozy and lively, and the service is amazing. Our server even asked us for our names at the end of the meal. I wish the portion size of the Mushroom Ravioli and the Eggplant Parmigiana were a bit larger, especially since both were so delicious, but the huge Uovo pizza made up for it. Adding dessert on top of that, we all left stuffed.

Burrata cheese and 24 month aged San Daniele prosciutto (Brusschetta) $11 for 6 pieces \n- One word, AMAZING!! This was WAY better than expected and simply blew my mind. Not sure if it's the cheese or ham, but the overall combination was D E L I C I O U S!!! Loved and would definitely recommend this as an appetizer. \n\n2. Spaghetti Carbonara $18\n- I'm a huge fan of carbonara, but this wasn't what I expected. Yes, it's a good portion, but there was something about the flavor that tasted different. It's definitely unique? I've never seen a carbonara with a sunny side egg on top either. Interesting. \n\n3. Fiocchetti $19\n- I only had one bite, so I couldn't make the best judgment, but my friend said it wasn't salty enough. The bread and bruschetta was pretty filling so we both didn't finish our entrees. \n\nService was excellent. Such friendly staff and a nice gentleman that served us. Water was always checked on and we never had an issue grabbing his attention. He even gave us complimentary dessert at the end!! We were the very last customers, so we totally appreciated that he stayed a little later until we finished. \n\nInterior ambiance was romantic. We didn't think it'd look that fancy!

However, this little spot manages to hold its own, even if it's overmatched. \n\nI came here for lunch since work is close enough to walk. They have a fairly large menu and after some consideration, I went with he two-piece combo chicken Milanese and eggplant parmigiana.  Both were good separately, although I would have preferred some tomato sauce over my chicken. They offered ketchup so that's how I knew my meal wasn't truly Italian. Before the main course, I had stuffed myself full of carbs with a few slices of the variety bruschetta. I highly would recommend this to start your meal as it's quite the treat. Best one? The salmon or original.\n\nFor a party of 10 of us, the wait staff had good memory on who had what and our orders came out at the same time.

We were shortly seated and our waiter was very thorough explaining the menu and patient answering our questions. I was able to try a few dishes: \n\n1. Lasagna: Absolutely delicious. The portion was huge and each bit was extremely cheesy with huge chunks of meat. The noodle was cooked perfectly. One of the best Lasagna I've ever had.\n\n2.  Cioppino: Wasn't on the menu but one of the specials for the day. It was SOOO good. Big piece of lobster claw, crab, clams, fish and shrimp. The sauce was delicious and I kept dipping bread to soak it up. \n\n3. Calamari: Perfectly fried and the squid was fresh. I also liked that they had pieces of fried artichoke. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall this restaurant had a perfect trifecta of exemplary service, perfect ambiance and delicious food. To top it off, it was my cousins birthday so they had a wonderful surprise for her after our dinner. They had someone come out with a trumpet and played happy birthday for her and gave her the most amazing tiramisu. I couldn't have asked for a better dinner. This place is a must try.

The bread they served was very dry and served with a cup of olive oil.  \n\nI had the Fiocchetti  (Homemade Pasta stuffed with 3 Italian cheeses, pear in gorgonzola cream sauce. it was good but didn't really wow me though. Kind of average for the cost.   \nMy brother had the Grilled chicken, buffalo mozzarella, saut\u00e9ed spinach panini, my sister had the Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli with black truffle cream sauce, my dad had the Veal Scaloppine , lemon caper sauce , vegetable and potatoes, my sister in law had the Spaghetti Carbonara eggs, guanciale, onions and parmiggiano cheese, my mom had the Smoked Salmon and Caramelized onions omelette and my niece had the Micky Mouse cheese pizza. \n\nAfter finishing our brunch, my brother, sister, dad and sister in law all agreed that they were expecting their entrees to be better. I also thought my entree to be a little better but wasn't expecting it to be great though. My mom was the only one who loved her omelette and of course my six year old niece had very high praise for her personal pizza. \n\nWe ordered two tiramisu's and one creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake, both very good. The bill for 6 adults and one child was just under $160 before gratuity; with no wine or beer ordered. A few years ago I would have considered that overpriced for quality of food, but everything in San Francisco is so expensive these days, nothing surprises me anymore. \n\nThe restaurant is nice with good atmosphere and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Our waiter; didn't catch his name was a charming and friendly young Italian guy from Salerno. He told us a little about himself and offered to take photos with my brother's phone. \n\nAll in all I thought it was pretty good; probably because I went there with no expectations and it was better than half of the places where we frequently dine. My sister in law was a bit let down because she went on the high reviews on Yelp and then hyped it up to other members of my family who then also expected it to be amazing. It's like being hyped up for a movie that people are raving about and when you see it, it's always a letdown because it didn't quite meet your expectations. I would have added a fourth star if they took reservations. \n\nOn an off note, take my advise and never go out to an Italian restaurant with someone who's \"been to Italy\" You know the type! the pretentious showoff wannabe type who go on and on about their superior knowledge of Italian cuisine who just won't shut up! .. I'm not mentioning names and everyone in my family except for my niece have \"been to Italy\" but I just thought I'd throw that in because those people; a lot of them here on Yelp just annoy me! hahaha", "author": "David A."}

Tough area since it's very old school money driven. But I have to say - it's about time we actually have an authentic restaurant driven by a truly passionate person. It's right down town on Laurel St (just one block off El Camino south of Holly St.) - very easy to get to. \n\nFirst let me say that Vittorio has made sure to cover every aspect of fine dining, great service, great drinks and hospitality that forces you to make another reservation before you leave. You enjoy the moment you walk towards the doors and continue to look back when you leave. He has done himself, with great commitment, providing a true taste of Italy. I have already made arrangements for a party of 16 in the private room and look forward to having a great time. \n\nThe atmosphere grabs you really good. One side fit for Italian family dining. You get the l aromas from kitchen and the buzz of the restaurant just makes you hungry. Other side is set up with a bar, TVs, few more tables, private dining rooms and just classy modern style. \n\nIt's a must go!!!!!! Congrats Vittorio!!!", "author": "Vinnie V."}

We're totally nit picky foodies and never ever have any complaints about the restaurant. The service alone deserves 5 stars. The waiters are fantastic and always seem like they genuinely enjoy their job. Vittorio himself is often there and always greets us as does the rest of the staff. It really has a wonderful, family feel to it. And the food. THE FOOD. I was raised with a grandfather who is a first generation Sicilian American so I am really picky when it comes to Italian food! The food tastes like something that would be handmade. The bread and olive oil they bring is always yummy. The olive oil tastes like the good stuff you'd actually get in Italy. My partner and I always get the bruschetta with burrata and prosciutto and it's always delicious. They don't skimp on the burrata and the prosciutto is very good. We also really love the bruschetta with nduja. Their polpette are wonderful and their caprese has burrata which really makes it better! \n\nOur favorite entree is far and away the fiocchetti. The contrast of the sweet pear with the more pungent Gorgonzola is heavenly. I could eat it everyday of the week. My partner loves spaghetti and meatballs and raves about theirs. We also love their lasagne. They have cioppino on their specials menu sometimes and my partner said it was excellent. Basically, everything we've eaten here is fantastic. \n\nTheir dessert is really yummy and while I usually go for their classic tiramisu, I always have a hard time deciding what to get.

The tomato sauce was hardy, not too tart or sour, but a little watery. Spaghetti noodles were cooked nicely, al dente with a nice bite. Meatballs the size of ping pong balls were gigantic and tasty, but not stellar. And it was a little unsettling that they were still a little pink in the center. The lasagna with meat sauce ($17) had over five layers of lasagna noodles, but I felt like there wasn't enough meat and cheese filling between the noodles. There wasn't enough sauce either. Overall this dish was too heavy on the carbs and very dense. However, the burrata cheese and prosciutto bruschetta appetizer ($9) was probably the best of the night. The toasted sliced baguette was very crispy, a nice base for the rich cheese and salty meat.\n\nOverall, food was decent, but nothing too special or worth going across the city.

I'm one of the people who are surprised at all the high marks being handed out, but opinions, and meals, vary. Perhaps it was a bad night. I ordered the antipasti for one ($14) and received one slice each of the 3 meats they offer and a few very small pieces of parmesan cheese. Ok, not out of the ordinary for a high end Italian restaurant. However, the taste of the meats was unremarkable. No better than you'd get at your grocery store deli. The cheese was good though. I also ordered the veal scaloppini and I've definitely had better. The veal was basically tasteless and a tad over-cooked. Usually this situation can be remedied with a tasty sauce, but the mushroom and marsala sauce was bland as well. I rarely salt food, but I found myself grabbing the salt shaker more than once. For dessert, the cannoli was ok, but unremarkable. I won't go into detail about my wife's meal but she felt the same overall. I kept commenting to my her that I've had better at the Gold Mirror.

The spaghetti carbonara topped with egg didn't really stand out for me; maybe I've tried better so it didn't really made a huge impact on me. The flavor was average..\n\nMy friend got the lasagna and the layers were a bit hard/crusty and the sauce looked premade or old. A very average lasagna if you ask me. (I also tried her lasagna so I'm saying my opinion)\n\nThe waiter was really attentive and refilling the water and making sure everything was ok.

They're usually fairly busy, but I've never had to wait for a table on a weeknight. The service is always very friendly and the waiters have always been able to answer all of our questions about their food and wine.\n\nEverything that I've had has been delicious. The brussels sprouts and the bruschetta with burrata and prosciutto appetizers are fantastic, and are an excellent way to start off a meal, especially with a nice glass of wine.\n\nThe pizzas are pretty good, but not fantastic, but are still definitely the best pizzas in West Portal. The veal scaloppini is also excellent. Most recently, the daily special was baked branzino, which was probably the best branzino I've ever had. It was tender and moist on the inside, yet was lightly crispy on the outside. \n\nTrattoria da Vittorio is an excellent choice for dining in the West Portal area - or even in SF in general.", "author": "Allen T."}

It felt like we had not one, but three waiters, with someone almost always attending to us. Immediately after being seated we were given a plate of bread and olive oil. After taking our orders, all of our food came out in 10 minutes. Even when the restaurant got really busy at 1, we had no issue asking for a dessert  menu and getting the check promptly.\n\nNow for the food; it was simply divine. I had a caprese panini and it was the best caprese panini I've ever had. For one, the panini was made with this delicious pizza bread. For another, the mozzarella was heavenly - so soft and melt-in-your-mouth creamy. But what made this panini stellar is the perfect ratio of bread:cheese:tomato:basil:balsamic vinegar. The panini could not have been more well balanced. \n\nFor dessert, the tiramisu is wonderful! So light, not too sweet, and portion wise, the slice was huge. The only thing that could've made it better is maybe a hint of rum or kalhua. The nutella calzone and caramel gelato with sea salt and olive oil was well received by my table as well. Personally, the calzone seemed a bit heavy and carby after my panini, but if you're looking for a more filling dessert that's the way to go. As for the caramel gelato, I personally thought it was too sweet and the chocolate caramel chunks in it were a bit much, but hey if you have a sweet tooth you can't go wrong with it.\n\nAll in all this is a great Italian restaurant, and I'm so happy I stumbled upon it!", "author": "Umeet S."}

Good service. Decent food. I came into the restaurant really excited to try everything but left underwhelmed. \n\nTried many menu items. Some items were better than others. I've been to Italy and had excellent carbonara there and in America. This one I thought to be just ok. It was served on the cold side which may have been the problem. \n\nHowever, I really loved the calamari and artichoke appetizer. Lightly breaded and fried well. The calamari was perfectly cooked and wasn't chewy. The breading could have been seasoned better but the two dipping sauces made up for it. One sauce was similar to a tartar sauce and other was a light citrus sauce. They worked well together and brought out the distinct flavors of the artichoke and calamari. \n\nI also enjoyed the chicken Milanese with eggplant. That was a winning entree. Would definitely order it again. The eggplant was excellent and complimented the chicken well. Was too full to try any desserts though they looked super yummy.", "author": "Rosalyn W."}

I needed to carb up before the Nike Women's race, and I was glad to start my dinner here with tasty bread and fresh olive oil to dip it in. We ordered the bruschetta caponata (3 stars) and the beet salad (4 stars) to start. The bruschetta lacked cohesiveness - it was tasty but felt too much like two separate components (the bread and the caponata) for me. The salad was very fresh, very light and I adored the house-made vinegarette in just the right amount (JUST enough). I also appreciated that they split the salad for us.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the special pappardelle with wild boar ragu (3 stars). The fresh pasta was tasty and well-cooked and the amount was on-point. However the sauce was a little lacking in flavor. It kind of reminded me of a comfort dish mom might make, but didn't have any specialness to it. We also ordered a pizza - the bella, I believe - with eggplant, artichokes, and burratta (5 stars). Stop the presses, this is my new favorite pizza in SF. The crust is oven-fired PERFECTION and the mozzarella they use actually tastes like mozzarella!  It is enough to make me never want another American pizza again. I'm seriously rejoicing to see take-out and delivery options are available, because I can't wait to try the other za's on the menu.\n\nAfter some debate, we opted not to get dessert and swore we'd order it next time. A couple minutes later, our waiter appeared with tiramisu in hand, laughing to himself, \"next time.\" The tiramisu (5 stars) was clearly authentic - it was so incredibly light, spicy and sweet, soaked with good coffee. The lady fingers literally melted in your mouth. It was a completely different dish than anything else I've had by the same name here in the U.S.\n\nI was also impressed with the hospitality of the staff from the time we walked in. It is clear that everyone there has ownership and pride in their job. The host staff, management, and waitstaff were all very attentive, professional and friendly. I love that many of them seem to be authentically Italian themselves - which shows in their service, as well as on the menu!", "author": "Catie F."}

Now, it's about average, maybe slightly above. But our lunch today was our last - we won't be returning. We had the spaghetti and meatballs, which as stated above was much better a few years ago. We also had the petrale sole piccata, that was good. Why we won't be returning: My wife was given a teacup with a large lipstick stain on the side. This completely spoiled the mood of our lunch. My wife wrote a note on the bill about the lipstick stain, and when our server came to pick up the tab, she pointed it out to him and said please make sure that the manager reads this. Our server said \" I am the manager\", read it, and walked away. He returned in about 20 seconds, and said \" Look, we get about 500 guests in here on a weekend, once in a while a little lipstick on a cup, it's normal\" . That was our cue to bid adieu to Trattoria da Vittorio. Had the manager came back and said \"I'm sorry about that Madame, we will strive to do better next time, and here's a discount coupon to ensure you come back and give us another try\" or something nice, that would have been different.My wife has doubts if he is really the manager as HE DOESN'T KNOW BASIC CUSTOMER SERVICE  - at least apologize first.\nHe even  made us feel that we are at fault  with noticing that half mouth sharp red lipstick-stained cup.

The pasta was fresh and sauce was deliciously creamy and blended well with the non-overpowering pear flavors. \n\nService was friendly. We were seated near the front of the restaurant and they kept a good watch on our table. The owner checked in with us to ensure we were okay. \n\nArrive early if you're planning dinner here. The place was filling up pretty fast and by the time we left a queue had accumulated outside.", "author": "Esther A."}

However, this recent time I felt extremely gypped. I normally get the Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli with the truffle sauce which is incredible. However, I've been trying to lay off the carbs and eat healthier. As our waiter told us the specials for the night and one of them was a lemon sea bass with potatoes and asparagus, which sounded  great. Little did I know, the lemon sea bass was two pan fried filets with a lemon wedge on the side -__-. Not at all what i expected. The sea bass was bland and had no taste to it at all. The asparagus was just cooked with olive oil, no salt or pepper to it. The dish as a whole was just tasteless and I could have probably cooked A better version of it at home. So I asked for extra lemons to squeeze on the fish and some Parmesan cheese and pepper to give it some taste, which helped a lot. However, it was $30 for a tasteless dish! \n\nSo, I definitely recommend to just stick to the pastas and the ravioli in truffle sauce!", "author": "Dianna C."}

We got here around 8:45pm and the wait was about 10-15 minutes which is not bad at all. Parking was easy to find since it's later at night. We ordered a bunch of food and they were all tasty! Service was a bit slow in my opinion. No one came to our table till 10 minutes and we were just wondering when someone would come up to us but they were just standing around. But luckily someone came by and took our order. We started with the calamari and the funghi brushetta. The calamari was delicious and it also came with fried artichoke. The funghi brushetta was yummy too. I think they may have burnt the bread a bit but it was still good! For main dish, I ordered the pizza with the egg, my boyfriend ordered the handmade scialatielli pasta pescatora and my friend ordered the lasagna. Pizza was yummy! Had tons of topping and the egg on there was on point. I tried some of the lasagna and the scialatielli and they were flavorful and tasty. Our total bill was about $95 ish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-31", "description": "Being new to the area, I depend on my few friends up here to introduce me to new areas within San Fran. Last night was West Portal and I loved it there. We had no place in mind for dinner so we decided to walk around the area and see what calls out to us...well, that and my handy yelp app which helped to suade us. The 4.5 average star rating at Trattoria Da Vittorio got my curiosity going so we walked by and loved the ambiance and we all agreed immediately if the wait wasn't long, it was meant to be.\n\nWe were there last night around 8:30pm (Thursday) and got seated at the bar within 10 minutes The wait would have been much longer for a tabletop but we were starving.  The first thing that stood out was that all the workers were Italian. BIG PLUS.  At first the smell of the restaurant bothered me and my friend said it was the yeast for the bread. 2nd BIG PLUS.  I love freshly made food.  \n\nNow what to order?!?  Everything on the menu sounded incredible. With it being October, there were a few pumpkin inspired dishes such as their risotto and soup. But, i wasn't feeling it. I scrolled through the pictures on yelp and their homemade pasta looked good, I decided on the seafood pasta dish (Handmade Scialatielli pasta Pescatora  with fresh mix seafood in a tomato sauce  for $19)                My friends had the Lasagna and the Spaghetti with Meatball.  Though I enjoyed my seafood pasta dish, it was a little too fishy for me but hey, it's what I ordered.  The Lasagna was my favorite, if ever am I craving a Lasagna, I'm heading to this place.  The meatballs that came with the spaghetti ranks up as one of my faves.  \n\n-Seafood Pasta - 4 star\n-Spaghetti with Meatball - 4 star\n-Lasagna - 5 star\n\nOh, I forgot to mention we started with the Calamari which was legitimate. Their mint dipping sauce wasn't my favorite. i preferred the other sauce but wished the regular marinara was provided.\n\nWhen I go to an Italian place with legitimate food, I always order dessert. We were torn on what to get. Of course Tiramisu is always the go-to dish but the Homemade Profiterole (cream puff filled with ice cream instead of whipped cream) looked so interesting. We asked the server about the 2 options but we decided to play it safe and get the Tiramisu.  Well...to our surprise he brought u the Profiterole for us to try (on the house) which brought a smile to all our faces. These guys are 4.5 stars on Yelp for a reason! Nice! Both desserts were excellent, I can't decide which I enjoyed more, they were very different and both will not disappoint. \n\nAt the end of our night, the bill was $100 for 3 people. The portions were super generous so we had 3 boxes of food to go. 1/2 of 2 entrees and 1/3 of the appetizer so I feel their pricing was very good. The food quality is excellent but the standout for this place is the wonderful service. \n\nNote that this is a true Italian establishment where you eat a nice and slow dinner. So service may seen slow but in actuality, this is how it is meant to be. This is not a place to rush a meal, rather this is a great place to catch up with friends and spend a good few hours mingling and enjoying great Italian cuisine/wine.", "author": "Mel D."}

As a mature customer (OK, we're senior citizens), it's not really a place that my wife and I enjoy.  But our son (in his early 40's) loves it.  It's too crowded and noisy for us to enjoy.  There does seem to be a great variety of dishes, and I would think foodies would really enjoy it.  Also younger people in a celebratory mood will probably enjoy the high energy in this restaurant.  The food is interesting and varied.  However I can't say I've had anything that has so much taste that I feel like \"Gee, I want to come back and have that again!\"\n\nI also feel that it's a bit pricey.

We were flattered by his gesture! \n\nPrices range from $15-30 which is on the moderate side but it is so worth it due to authenticity! Prices also go up with 'wine by the glass' selection too.\n\nThe only reason why I took away one star is because you can't make any reservations in advance (esp. if you have a party of 6 or more), so it's hard to say how long you have to wait for a table, and parking on West Portal is challenging, so that you have to go to residential side to secure a parking space.\n\nAlthough there are small inconveniences above, I would definitely come back and proudly recommend this place to anyone!", "author": "Vanessa B."}

The staff was very professional and attentive without becoming annoying by checking in on you every five minutes. \nI ordered a pizza:\nBella ~ burrata, prosciutto, arugula, eggplant, artichoke, zucchini\\\nDelicious! I used to go out of my way to get a great pizza in North Beach (think Tony's New York Style or similar). No more. The presentation was great, the crust was perfect, thin with a good char. The burrata was amazing! I've only had burrata this good at one other place (which also made their own). \n\nMy gf ordered the risotto special with salmon and asparagus. \nExcellent, though not the type of risotto you'd expect from past experience, this dish was a direct contrast to the pizza, light texture, light flavors, not too salty. The rice was not cooked for a long time in the broth like most other risotto's you'd order would be, but instead it seems like they simmered it in the broth for a little while and then served it so that the rice absorbed the flavors but didn't release a lot of starch. Perhaps it's a southern Italian style of risotto, or the type of rice they used, I'm not sure. Just don't expect the same creamy dish that one tends to think of when ordering risotto. \n\nWe finished off with the caramel gelato with salt and olive oil. \nAlso amazing. Yes, it sounds strange, but the olive oil actually plays off and balances the sweetness in a pleasant way, as does the (very light dusting of) salt. So far this is the only gelato I have found in the U.S. that compares with the gelato in Italy. Almost every other place that has what they call gelato serves ice cream.

You can taste the freshness of the pasta on the first bite. I've never had homemade pasta before and this just sets the standards very high for me for the next time I have pasta. Me and my friend shared the seafood pasta and they had it ready for us in two plates, nicely arranged, like if we just ordered it without it being split into two. The calamari was very good as well with four people sharing it. So enough for a group of people to have  as an appetizer. In the end of our meal we got the tiramisu, on the house because it was my friends birthday and it was one of the best tiramisu I've ever had! \n\nFor the service: we got seated in five minutes on a weekend, so that was very fast. The owner of the place was so sweet and attentive. He actually made our order for us since he saw that we were ready to order. They were all very nice. Although one down side was that they accidentally gave our order to the table sitting next to us and we had to wait a little bit more longer, they were all very apologetic and showed that they cared about the customer.  When we were leaving we actually had a talk with the owner asking us how we liked the food. I've never really experienced an owner of a restaurant talking to me so I liked the conversation we had with him a lot. He told us how the restaurant started with his mom cooking in the kitchen so you know their whole menu is authentic Italian. It seemed that all the waiters were Italian because of their accents. And not to mention their waiter skills. Our waiter actually carried 5 plates on his forearm and didn't struggle at all. That was quite impressive.  The owner just told us that their first year just came up and I was quite shocked how recent they opened up this place. \n\n\nI give it five stars in the end because the food was sooo good.

They've recently opened in the last year or so in the old Cafe For All Seasons spot, which is in the middle of West Portal. On a Sunday night, it was pretty busy but we were able to snag a table right away.\n\nTheir menu consists of more southern Italian fare, which is a welcome change since many Italian restaurants specialize in more northern Italian dishes. I ordered the gnocchi with pomodoro sauce and it was pretty good. The gnocchi were light and fluffy, like they should be, and the sauce was amazing. My mom ordered the San Daniele pizza, which comes with prosciutto, arugula, tomatoes and mozzarella. It reminded me of pizza I had in Florence - thin and crispy. My sister had a bowl of their tomato soup and a Caesar salad, which I had a few bites of. If you like traditional Caesar salad, anchovies and all, you'll like this one. We each ordered one of their desserts; I had the apple tart which was just enough for one person. Aside from the tart, it came with some ice cream - definitely a good choice if you want something sweet but isn't huge portions. \n\nService was very attentive and our food came out in a timely manner. They were really busy but still made sure to check in on us and make sure our food was okay. \n\nI think the only reason that would keep me from coming back is the fact that their food is a little pricey.

She kept raving about their stacked high pepperoni pizza but this restaurant was one let down after the other! \n\nOur quoted 35 minute wait turned into 60 minutes while we watched at least 8 tables who arrived after us get seated before us. The hostess kept saying she was waiting for this family to clear out and the table would be ours AND THANK GOD the manager or whoever seated us shortly after because that family never left! We would've been waiting for an additional 35 minutes+ Ridiculous. \n\nThe busboy was on point and even reminded someone when he noticed our appetizers never came. When they finally did, the waiter dropped two of our broccoli rage bruschetta and said he would come back with more. I wish he hadn't since it was fucking disgusting! Literally the worst bruschetta no wait literally one of the worst foods in general I've ever ordered in a restaurant. The bruschetta was a joke. \n\nThe eggplant parmesan was massive and way overpriced. The pizza was good but it was maybe 1/3 of the amount of pepperoni we got the first time we were here (read: inconsistent).

Generally, the parking in this area sucks because \n\n1. Its West Portal.\n2. Everyone eats out or is watching a movie.\n3. Its Sunday. \n\nLuckily, we found someone leaving their parking spot, so we nabbed it. When we came into the restaurant, it was already bustling with people eating dinner and having a good time. We decided it would be best to sit at the counter instead of waiting an hour for a table. SCORE! \n\nWe were seated within the first five minutes next to a column. I think its better to sit at the counter with my sweety, since being at a table divides us farther apart. Who agrees with me?! Being at the counter at Trattoria Da Vittorio is amazing because we could observe how the restaurant functions. This restaurant has an open aired kitchen where people at the counter could observe the kitchen staff working while the wait staff run around delivering piping hot savory meals to our tables. \n\nI ordered the Handmade Scialatielli pasta Pescatora with fresh mix seafood in a tomato sauce.The melding of the spices and sweet tomatoes in the sauce combined with the saltiness from the mollusks created an explosion of flavor in my mouth as I devoured my food. If I added Parmesan cheese to this delicate dish, it would have changed my palate and this review. Taking a sip of wine in between bites helped amplify the flavor of my food and the atmosphere (or, maybe because I may have been getting buzzed too). I didn't know what wine went well with this dish, so I asked the server to recommend one that was smooth, had a good fragrance, and full bodied; I had a Pinot Noir (Meiomi California 2011). I'm glad our server helped me pick a wine, otherwise I may have ordered one which could have destroyed the my appetite! \n\nSweety had the Pappardelle con cinghiale wild boar ragu. Amazingly, she devoured her food in a blink of an eye. Must have been that tasty?! We sampled each others dishes and both were delicious! Pappardelle pasta were like thin ribbons wrapped around my fork which skewered a piece of wild boar. Wild boar was well marinated and cooked thoroughly. It was a bit gamey tasting, but hey, it was to be expected right? \n\nThe evening winded down with dessert. We shared a Tiramisu and a Nutellino (a homemade calzone stuffed with nutella chocolate). Nutellino was really good because of the oozing magma hot nutella chocolate and the light fluffy crust of the calzone. Loved it! However, the Tiramisu was mediocre because it looked like it was hastily made. It fell apart too quickly. Could be the batch or something. Either way, it was tasty and ended up like everything else in my tummy. Seriously, I think I became a fatass in evening. BUT IT WAS ALL WORTH IT! \n\nAh, now the SERVICE. \n\nService was..\n\nwas...\n\nSERVICE WAS AWESOME! \nOur servers were quick with catering to our customerly requests (knowledge of wines, dessert menu, bill). From the kitchen, we had some interaction with the head chef and the general manager too. I sometimes have this clueless look or bored expression on my face when I'm digesting. I guess my expression attracted the owner very quickly. He was directing his chef with something right across from me in the kitchen and upon looking up, he noticed me drifting off into space. Thanks for the service Mr. D'Urzo, much appreciated!\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThis is probably my 5th or 6th time coming here and I always seem to forget to review it until NOW! I highly recommend this place for a small family/friend get together or for a date. The atmosphere is very intimate since the lights in here are often dimmed to provide that cozy romantic setting. The wait staff and kitchen staff speak very fluent Italian and Spanish. You can distinguish the kitchen staff pretty well as the Hispanics are either line cooks or dish washers who wear black, while the sous chef and executive chef wear white. \n\nI think the food is top notch, fresh and very flavorful.

The bus boy came with water and filled up the glass only about a third of the way which left us surprised and laughing. That was a first.\n\nThe waiter finally came and we ordered several items: Bruschetta sampler, caprese salad, seafood risotto, gnocchi, wild boar ragu with pappardelle and Brussels sprouts. The bruschetta sampler came out first and that was actually decent. It just went downhill from there. I also ordered a soda and I had to repeatedly ask for it. \n\nThen all the food came and I mean all of it. The waiter was told that the 4 of us were going to do this family style so when all 5 dishes came at the same time, I was a bit surprised and irritated. Not only was the table small so had issues fitting everything and therefore felt cramped, but you just can't get to everything quick enough so things were getting cold. Also, who the hell brings out a salad with all of the entrees? That shout have come out with the Bruschetta.\n\nThat wasn't even the worst part. The food was terrible! The caprese salad had no olive oil on it nor salt and pepper so it was really bland. The risotto tasted like mush. It's pretty sad that an Italian restaurant doesn't know how to cook risotto properly. The pappardelle and and gnocchi were tasteless as well. The pasta clearly is not fresh. \n\nOverall, we were so disappointed in this meal. Not only was the service bad but the food was even worse. We didn't even stay for dessert.

I randomly decided to come here during lunch with a friend. The restaurant starts of casual in front and starts to become more classier as you move to the back. The staff were real italians with real accents haha and super friendly. \n\nI ordered the homemade spaghetti with seafood and my friend order the pizza with egg. We also ordered meat and cheese bruschetta. The bruschetta was so good, using prosciutto and Barada cheese topped off with olive oil. The cheese was fresh and the bread texture was just right they also had a side of arugula as well\n\nMy pasta was fresh, you can tell by the shape and texture. They used a little bit of a thicker shape a lot like udon but that was cool with me. The sauce was thick and flavorful - there was no watery sauce here.They had large shrimp, clams and fish as protein. One of the best pasta I've had next to Emmys. \n\nI only had a slice of the pizza, but i can tell that it had the same quality as something like Zero Zero, I personally wanted to try a red based sauce because he had a cream base sauce. \n\nOverall i really enjoyed myself here.

Nuzzled right in the West Portal area, this little gem boasts authentic Southern Italian flavors with a warm and cozy atmosphere.  From the moment we walked in, we experienced excellent service that was genuine and inviting.  They really do make you feel like family here.  \n\nI loved that all the servers spoke fluent Italian and recommended some of the yummiest dishes to us.  It just added to the experience with a touch of authenticity.  Our server was Alessandro and he made our dining experience impeccable.  He was quick, accommodating, and really friendly.  He knew we were eyeing the Pappardelle even before we said a word (he probably overheard our conversation ha!).  At the end of our meal, I was debating whether or not to order the tiramisu (my FAVORITE dessert).  I decided against it to be slightly healthier (especially after eating pasta), but they presented us with one anyway.. ON THE HOUSE.  Aww... how can I refuse that?!  Just gotta work out that much harder tomorrow!  Indeed I was a very happy camper :)     \n\nSo in summary, the prices are very decent, the food was very flavorful and authentic, portions are large, and it's in a convenient location.  Parking may be a bit of an issue sometimes, but definitely not as difficult as some of the other neighborhoods in SF.  Again, I cannot stress how amazing the service was.  Often time the host/hostess is the first person you talk to when you get to a restaurant.  That short interaction can either make or break your experience there.  The owner, I believe, was the host/ma\u00eetre d' and he immediately made us feel very welcomed.  I noticed he was constantly walking around to each table to introduce himself and checking in to make sure the guests were accommodated.  And of course, I was very happy with the free tiramisu.  It was perfectly moist and creamy.. oh it was heaven in my mouth.  \n\nAll in all, a very solid restaurant and I would highly recommend it for a casual yet intimate dining experience.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

I get that the restaurant is on the casual side, but I don't particularly like being left confused and ignored especially if I'm a first timer. Service thereafter was okay but you can tell the staff are somewhat distracted because they're really busy. \n\nI started out the night with the salmon bruschetta and was sorely disappointed. It tasted nothing more than butter and smoked salmon (the kinds you can get at Costco). They were two capers and drops of mustard as garnish, but I didn't think the flavors worked well together. Bread was kind of stale. For the main entree, I got the seafood pasta and my friend got the ravioli with truffle cream sauce. The pasta were all \"handmade\" but they didn't taste anything better than homecooked pasta. The pasta and seafood were overcooked, and the sauce left much to be desired, even the truffle ravioli! Really good pasta to me has a slight springiness and ingredients should taste fresh. All things considered, I think $18-20 for a dish here is quite steep.\n\nMy friends and I meant to meet to catch up but because it was so loud we could barely hear one another.

My mom asked which was better the veal or the lobster ravioli...his persuasive Italian self somehow managed to get my mom to switch to the lamb shank with sage butter gnocchi...lol.\n\nPortions are large, but some dishes are very unbalanced. Prime example: my lobster risotto. The lobster was excellent, the meat was sweet but crisp....but no matter how many ways you cut it, there was no way that you could have enough lobster for the obscene amount of risotto there was on the plate!\n\nI would give it 3 stars, but that extra star is reserved strictly for dessert.

It was my first time there so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  A family member recommended and although we visit the West Portal area frequently, I had never noticed this little gem!\n\nWe really enjoyed the food, atmosphere and the service.  Our waiter recommended a few appetizers for our party (11 persons) and we loved them all...we weren't sure we would have room for a regular meal after all the goodies, but somehow we managed.  I had their salmon and it was amazing -- a few had various pasta dishes and cleared their plates and their pizzas also got rave reviews.\n\nWaiters were very attentive and accommodating -- we were there quite a while!  And, I believe everyone in our party agreed that we will all be back soon!", "author": "L. F."}

Just a couple doors down from Shaw's on W. Portal, parking here is fairly difficult to find. The decor is simple but elegant and the lighting is dimmed as well so it's a great place for a date night. \n\nWe were starving so we opted to sit at the bar which allowed us to get seated right away. A feature that I enjoyed at this establishment is that they have an open air kitchen so it allowed us to see the hustle and bustle while we sat and ate. In addition, we were seated right across from the pizza oven so it was nice to watch the items being cooked in it.\n\nOur Order:\nHandmade Scialatielli Pasta Pescatora  with fresh Mix Seafood in a Tomato Sauce ($19)\nPappardelle Con Cinghiale Wild Boar Ragu ($17)\nPinot Noir - Meiomi California 2011 ($12)\nNutellino: ($8) homemade Calzone stuffed with Nutella chocolate\nMama's Tiramisu ($7)\n\nWhile we're waiting they offer complimentary house bread with a side of olive oil. It was great because we were starving though our waiter never brought out the balsamic vinaigrette that I asked for. I had to ask the waitress that brought out our food to brings some. At least the food came out quickly.\n\nPappardelle Con Cinghiale is a wide ribbon pasta dish served with a ragu sauce with tender chunks of wild boar. I loved how tender the boar was and it wasn't very gamey (which would've been fine with me if it was since I grew up on game meat). The boar was probably my favorite thing of the entire dinner (besides the Nutellino).\n\nScialatielli Pasta Pescatora is a dish that reminds me of a cioppino over thick spaghetti-like noodles. I'm always weary about shellfish and how well they are cleaned but they weren't sandy or gritty here (just teeny tiny).\n\nI took a sip of the Pinot Noir and it complimented the meal well (though I'm not much of a wine drinker). It was smooth and not too dry.\n\nI love Tiramisu and was only going to order that until my friend pointed out the Nutellino. Nutella is another sweet that is a weakness of mine. Though they describe it as a calzone, it was more like a thick bread-stick with Nutella in it served on a wooden plank along side whipped cream that was dusted with cocoa powder. It had just come out of the oven as the Nutella was in a glorious melty state and oozed out of the bread as we tore it apart. Even though I love tiramisu, between the two desserts I enjoyed the Nutellino more. The tiramisu was moist but I prefer the ones where it has a bit of rum in it.\n\nNote: Though it's a great place for a date night, they do have a children's menu if you have to bring the little ones along.", "author": "Kitty K."}

Great space and atmosphere, superb service, and as much urban buzz as one gets in West Portal.  This was highly recommended by many Yelpers and a trusted foodie couple I'm friends with.  Overall, some of the blandest Italian food I've ever had.  Pasta was mushy in an undistinguished red sauce beside some rubbery sausage.  The pizza, unless you drowned it in the tasty hot sauce, was not palatable.  Reheating it at home, using a covered, hot pan, revived the crust, but both the sauce and mozzarella were meh. The Caesar had no discernible garlic and an unspectacular dressing.  The flavor profile was just \"off\" on everything, including the asparagus soup that seemed like it could've used something beside the main ingredient;  a dollop of creme fraiche, a little olive oil, seasoning.  As I said, we got amazing service, were comped both wine and dessert, got expert help with picking a perfect wine, and still managed to enjoy ourselves.", "author": "Michael S."}

We both got the lamb shank and gnocchi that was on the specials board. It was really good. We both had leftovers to take back home and I asked to keep my bone because I wanted to eat the bone marrow that was inside. Our waiter, Roberto, was very nice. We planned on getting the nutella calzone and he gave us a complimentary tiramisu. \n\nWe went back again and got the last available table before the rush came in (another Friday night). We loved the Burrata cheese and 24 month aged San Daniele prosciutto bruschetta (Roberto's recommendation). We also had the Bella pizza. Both had burrata cheese and prosciutto and it was very good. Creamy and salty. We finished our meal with the caramel gelato drizzled with olive oil. The olive oil helped the gelato from tasting too sweet, which I liked.\n\nOverall, my cousin and I like coming to this place. Service was very nice to us both times and there's more food here we would like to try. If it is your first time here, you can never go wrong with the lamb shank and gnocchi if they have it that night.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Niccolo was my server each time, and I must say that his hospitality is what keeps me coming in with new people. The staff is excellent, and the chef is beyond talented. This is the type of restaurant where you can take your time, enjoy a meal, enjoy your company, and not feel rushed. They care about your experience more than turning over tables. I'm definitely a loyal customer, and will be returning soon. I can't wait to try new items on the menu! Thank you for the hospitality, Trattoria Da Vittorio!\n\nFor appetizers:\n-I've only had their calamari and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was crispy, and I loved that there were artichoke hearts tossed in. The dipping sauces that accompanied the dish complimented it very well.\n\nFor their entrees, I have tried:\n-Truffle mushroom ravioli, and it was PHENOMENAL. All of the flavors were on point.\n-A bite of their housemade creamy gnocchi. It literally melts in your mouth. \n-Mama's traditional lasagna. Let me tell you, they do not skimp out on anything. The quality of all their dishes are top notch.\n-A bite of their seafood pasta, which had amazing flavors and great use of fresh ingredients which is especially important when it comes to seafood IMO.\n\nFor their dessert\n-Seasalt caramel gelato. This has become one of my favorite and top-rated desserts. You must try it when you come in and dine. \n- Traditional tiramisu. Every time I go to an italian restaurant, I always have to try their tiramisu. The tiramisu here is nothing short of amazing -- one of the best I've had in awhile.

It was really loud and we could barely hear people across the table. Our table was pretty wobbly and we asked two different servers and a man who we think was the manager (since we wouldn't always find ours and we asked him twice) to put down one of those wedges, but no one ever did anything about it.\n\nThe seating was crowded and servers kept running into our table. The force of the kicks was spilling the water out of our glasses. This happened more times than I can count, and the servers almost never apologized. Sometimes the manager was right there and he had to apologize for his servers. I'm not sure if they added a table and they just weren't used to a table being there or if it was so busy they couldn't be bothered to watch where they were going. \n\nI understand a busy Friday night, but it was just too chaotic.

Where to begin; I went with my Nana and Aunt to Trattoria last night, our kitchen is being remodeled and we are in the stage of having absolutely nothing (no sink, fridge, end in sight). So eating out and become a regular, eating out is supposed to be a fun experience but lately it has become just a regular thing, nothing special, just another meal. \n\nThis was different. From the moment we walked in and got seated, I knew this was going to become one of my \"go to\" places. The service is amazing, I cannot begin to express how pleased I was with not only our waiter (who was on point), but the bussers, hostess, and manager/owner who was walking around making sure everything was perfect.\n\nWe did not get any appetizers but from what I saw around me everything looked amazing. The table next to us sat down and gave their order right away, they were regulars and said they come to share the apps and wine all the time. I know I will be seeing them again when my friends are I are doing the same. \n\nThe Dinner- My aunt and I split two of their specials; the Sea Bass which came with homemade mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus and the Homemade Mushroom Raviolis. My Nana got their other special which was a seafood risotto. There came to a point where all of realized no one had spoken in 5-10 minutes; that's how you know a place is making 5 star food- We did not speak one word to each other once our food was in front of us. \n\nWe should have ended our meal there. That would have been the smart thing to do; the entr\u00e9e portions were perfect and filling. But than they HAD to show us the dessert menu. No person in their right mind is going to say no to a Nutella Calzone. My Nana ordered the Carmel Gelato with Sea Salt & Olive Oil. We couldn't stop eating.

The service alone is worth raving about, and the meal was delicious as well.\n\nAs a party of six with two in their eighties (and several dietary requests), we were not a low maintenance group. The owner, manager, and chef went above and beyond to accommodate us from start to finish. True commitment to customer service across the board - always appreciated.\n\nI had the prosciutto and arugula pizza, which was outstanding - and I consider myself a thin-crust Italian-style pizza snob. We didn't try the any of the bruschetta options but after seeing them I will be sure to next time! Menu is a perfect mix of their pizzas and fresh pastas at a very good value. \n\nWe will be back, in hopefully a lower maintenance way!", "author": "Lydia B."}

Tried so far more than 1/2 of their menu: Bruschetta's, Pizza, Organic roasted beet salad, soup, Caprese, Risotto, sole Piccata, short ribs, veal special... and we were debating wild boar ragu pasta - so they were kind enough to get us a sample (it was great for the wild boar, but too gamy for most people at the table). \nAnd... the winner is... so hard to pick! I would go for short rib (on the heavy side) and beat salad (lighter side). \nAnd... drum roll... leave room for nutella calzone! they decorate it in the smiley face style. \nLOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.

JJ and I rolled into the restaurant at about 8 pm on a Friday night and, although it was pretty crowded, we were immediately shown to a table for two. We were immediately served with fresh bread and olive oil (which we inhaled because we were starvin'), and were situated with two lovely glasses of wine (good pours!). \n\nWe couldn't decide what to eat so we both ordered the specials: I had the Branzino (one of my most favorite fishes!) which was pan-seared perfectly and served with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes with some delectable green sauce drizzled around the edge - very pretty; and JJ had the lamb shank which was falling-off-the-bone deliciousness, with the gnocchi (which I kept sneaking off his plate). We both practically licked our plates clean.\n\nThe service was stellar. The owner, Vittorio, came by our table and had a nice chat, which I always think is a lovely touch. \n\nI am definitely coming back here - it's so lovely to have excellent Italian food for a decent price in a nice neighborhood like West Portal (i.e. I don't have to schlep to North Beach).", "author": "Mi M."}

Some other yelpers have commented that the sea bass was bland, but I like that you can just taste the fish and not a bunch of sauce. If you like more sauce on your fish, then order the petrale sole dish. My husband ordered the lasagna. We were both very satisfied with our choices. The sea bass was light and the asparagus had a great taste. The sauce on the lasagna was nice and tomato-y but not too heavy.

I remember when the CVS was a Woolworth's and you could buy hamsters there. So old skool.\n\nFast forward to tonight when three of us WP families decide to finally try Trattoria Da Vittorio. We had been stalling because, like most WP residents, we all thought that the street did not need yet another Italian/Pizza restaurant.  You know Spiazzo sux and if you want good pizza you go to Goat HIll or Paradise. And if you want really good italian food you head to Tomasso's in NB. \n\nWOW. Mind blown. Trattoria Da Vittorio is awesome. The gnocchi are better than I've had anywhere, even in Italy. I have to say that everything we had was solid but the gnocchi were the most amazing little heavenly pillows of light potato fluffiness that I'd pay twice as much for them. And Napoli pizza out of a legit oven. A few in the party had cinghiale  (what our server called a \"man meal\") but it had no resemblance to cinghiale I've had in Tuscany.... but props for trying! Spag and meatballs were HUGE and the lasagne was literally bigger than a brick. I have no idea where the Yelpers complaints about serving size came from because all of our portions were practically too big to finish. But we did. \n\nVery loud room but we were a group of 11 people so maybe we were raising the decibels some -  yet the waitstaff was patient and efficient. I can understand how some Yelpers could think they were pushy but I think they are really trying to please. (Hey, at least they are attentive and not rude like servers in many Italian cities.)\n\nWe had to wait awhile for our table and Vittorio served us a complimentary bottle of prosecco outside while we were waiting.

Although very simple for its price, the salad  was very good. My problem with the meal was the lobster ravioli. At first I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong.. but then realized the filling was flaky? Lobster doesn't flake...what is this filling? Which is when I guessed salmon, and then it all made sense.  You know when a place has specials, its either because its something they want to test a new item OR their supply is going bad an they want to get rid of something. So 3 of their specials are salmon based...hmmm... It tasted more fishy than lobster-y.

I ordered the homemade special ravioli with pears and ricotta. Both dishes were amazing! So full of flavor! \n\nNow here's why I'm giving it 3 stars, the portion size is ridiculously small! I am not a glutinous person, I weigh 115 pounds and my bf is tall and lean himself. When I think authentic Italian, I think of leaving with your belly full! This place has it all ( ambience, great service, and delicious homemade food) but for the price... Not worth it! Each of our dishes were $20-25 each. I got 6 small size ravioli's scattered on my plate. My boyfriends chicken parmesan was the size of a chicken strip with not even a handful of eggplant underneath. We both were still so hungry after our entrees that we had to order an entire margarita pizza to be satisfied. \n\nNow I don't know about you but I love feeling full and satisfied after a good Italian meal. This did not happen here. If you love small Italian portions, give this place a shot. Other than that I enjoyed the service and warm welcoming. We might come back again.

June was knowledgeable, had great recommendations, and made sure we were taken care of throughout the meal.\n\nNow the best part - the food!\n\nWe had the calamari and caprese appetizers.  The calamari was light and tasty, the mozzarella that was part of the caprese with the heirloom tomatoes was as good as any I have had in Italy.  We also sampled the Margherita pizza...crisp, thin crust, fresh toppings, and freshly grated Parmigiano cheese on top - Molto bouno!\n\nAppetizers done, we moved to the pastas.  My spaghetti and house made meatballs was simple but incredibly tasty and done perfectly!  When a restaurant pays as much attention to the simple fare as they do to more complicated dishes, THAT'S a recipe for success.  My wife had one of the special pasta dishes with house made pasta \"purses\" with pear and Gorgonzola in a rich cream sauce...wow!  I only was able to score one from her before she protected her plate from my prying fork!\n\nThe wine we had was a good Chianti that served us well throughout the meal.\n\nLastly, dessert.  We had to try June's top three which were the Tiramisu (a classic done extremely well), the caramel gelato (with sea salt and drizzled with an extra virgin olive oil), and the Nutellino calzone (hazelnut chocolate made from scratch inside a softer, chewier version of the pizza crust)...all I can say is that there is nothing like an abundance of awesome tastiness to finish off the meal and solidify the sugar coma!\n\nAll in all, an excellent experience on all fronts!

I've seen businesses come and go, and Trattoria da Vittorio has some lasting power. \n\nWhen my girlfriend and I walked in we were immediately greeted by multiple members of the wait staff and seated almost right away. Upon sitting we were simultaneously brought waters and a small serving of bread and olive oil to begin the evening.\n\nAfter a few introductions from the wait staff, we placed our order of bruschetta topped with Burrata cheese and prosciutto. She ordered the San Daniele pizza and I ordered the pesto gnocchi with a special request of the usually lunchtime only pesto sauce. \n\nWithin a few minutes the bruschetta had arrived. Before leaving the waitress took our order of a bottle of 2010 Sangiovese. For wine enthusiasts, this place has about the most thorough wine menu you will find besides the small import wine bars in West Portal. \n\nOur waitress promptly returned with a very customary opening of red wine, allowing me to smell and taste the bottle before offering it to the table. Before she could leave, the bruschetta followed. Now I've had your typical diced tomato and olive oil bruschetta, but this took the creativity trophy. Not only was the cheese sweet and complimentary, but the prosciutto was aged to perfection, providing an excellent texture to top off the small bite.\n\nSoon our entrees came. The San Daniele pizza was crisp, light, and very well balanced. Not too heavy on any one of the ingredients, while keeping the marinara sauce just light enough to provide a platform for the rest of the toppings to shine. My pesto gnocchi came out piping hot and literally soft enough to melt in your mouth. While the portion was a bit on the small side, the pesto itself was good enough to warrant asking for a to-go box just for the sauce. \n\nAfter dinner and wine was said and done, we turned our attention to the dessert menu. As a Sicilian myself, I had to try the cannoli. After a full meal, I also ordered a cappuccino, just to see how the wait staff's barista skills were. We were surprised to find that as our cannoli came out, we were also brought out a tiramisu order on the house! Within minutes, my foamy, full cappucino came out and satisfied everything I had looked for after a full meal. Not only that, but the cannoli wasn't overcooked, and wasn't overly sweet as well. However, the tiramisu was really what stole the spotlight at the end of the meal. I can't recommend you try this enough at Trattoria. \n\nOverall, the staff was charming and hospitable (in particular the owner Vittorio, who takes his time to speak with each and every table), the food felt home-made and traditionally prepared, and the environment just what West Portal was lacking. \n\n5 stars! Can't wait to come back and try the Veal and the Pollo Milanese!", "author": "jordan s."}

Unfortunately, Trattoria Da Vittorio was one of the worse!  As I always do when I'm trying a new restaurant, I ordered one of the simplest things on the menu, Calzone.  I thought the likelihood of having a bad Calzone was slim ... about as likely as having bad pizza, right? ... wrong!  Suffice to say, it was awful!  A friend of mine ordered the Italian Sausage Panini, which resembled gyro meat stuck between a loaf of bread, and she hardly finished her meal.\n\nThe service was fine, nothing exception or impressive.  The owner did come by our table to see if everything was ok, but our waitress looked as if she was bored, literally plopped the gigantic water bottle on the table without bothering to open it or fill the glasses.     \n\nI'm always surprised how bad the service is at these restaurants who obviously try to achieve an upscale setting.  They don't seem to understand that being \"upscale\" doesn't mean just having sleek tables and chairs but the quality of the food and the level of service they provide to their patrons.

We would love to visit again after everything settles in.\n\nOur appetizers and main dishes were good to strong.  The short ribs were excellent.  Our kids' entries (butter pasta, cheese pizza, and Italian sausage) also were solid, although the sausage used arguably was not Italian sausage.  The one weak entr\u00e9e was the wild boar paparadelle, which required more meat (the sauce was thin).  \n\nDesserts were mixed.  On the one hand, the salted caramel ice cream and tiramisu were fantastic.  On the other hand, the coffee panna cotta was unsweetened.  This meant that it tasted off if eaten without the whipped cream.  (Those who loved the old Caf\u00e9 for All Seasons panna cotta will be disappointed.)\n\nThe wait staff was super enthusiastic, and the owner personally said hello -- a nice touch.  But there were some service wrinkles that should iron themselves out over time.  E.g., the waiter poured much more than the initial taste from our bottle of wine.  He also took down the wrong order for my son (this was understandable -- the place is quite loud), and the two of our kids' dishes arrived several minutes after our entrees arrived.

Dinner was incredible! We started off with 3 appetizers. We had their caprese with the most amazing cheese I've ever had (I forgot what it was called) but it was defiantly fresh. At first I thought the caprese was odd because it had arugula instead of basil, but when I cut into it I realized the basil was there and the arugula was just a tasty garnish. We had their brussel sprouts in a cream and bacon sauce, it was slightly over-cooked, but had a beautiful display. Our third appetizer was called Funghi-sliced bread with mushrooms and baked cheese served hot! The appetizers were all beautifully displayed and had an abundance of food on each. For our entrees we had a pizza with precuto and arugula and a 3 cheese and pear pasta with a yummy cheese sauce. And last but certainly not least we had their sorbet of the day which was lemon and blood orange, both flavors were captured perfectly and each bit was better then the rest.\n\nThe ambiance was quiet, we sat outside, it was a little chilly but they had a heater they turned on for me. Inside theirs were a few families dinning with small children-a real family place. \n\nOur server Giovanni was attentive without being over baring and at the end he informed us that he was a co-owner and was originally from Rome, Italy.

The first time, it was just she and I. We loved it so much, we took dad back with us when we moved her in. Everything we had on both visits was delicious! The olive oil used for bread is perfect - light but tasty. The calamari was fried to perfection. On the first visit, I got the special of the day, whole wheat ravioli with filling that I think was mushroom - it was good and a generous portion. Daughter got the pear filled pasta with gorgonzola sauce. IT WAS TO DIE FOR! Reminded me of the pasta we had last year in the Chianti region of Italy. We took the leftovers home to dad, who determined he must go and get them himself. So on our 2nd visit, he got them again, and they were just as tasty. I got and loved the eggplant parmesan. We also had the caprese and stuffed ourselves with some dessert. I don't usually like tiramasu, but this one was light and fluffy, very delicate in flavors. \n\nAll in all, the 3 of us agree that this is our favorite Italian restaurant and can't wait to visit again!", "author": "Lisa W."}

We were a large group so we got a selection of appetizers, Pizza, and pastas. We had the Caprese con Burrata & the Organic Beet Salad to start then had the Salsiccia (Italian sausage, mushroom , tomato sauce,buffalo mozzarella cheese) &  Uovo(Pizza with Eggs, pancetta, wild mushrooms, buffalo mozzarella) Pizzas and for the pastas we tried the  Spaghetti Carbonara, Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli and lastly the Spaghetti con Polpette Mamma Francesca's homemade meat balls. Everything tasted BLAND. Had to add salt, pepper to add taste the the food.

The food didn't measure up to true Italian. Pizza from the Napoli oven was very good -- thin, but slightly charred crust. Risotto was just ok. Rigatoni with meat sauce was just ok, but enjoyed by my daughter. Very tasty bread with olive oil was complimentary. Food was 3.5 to 4 stars and a little on the expensive side (although portions were large).\n\nSo why the 5 stars, you ask? Because the owner and staff are trying so hard to make your experience a memorable one. The owner welcomed us and wished us a good meal. When I told him I had just come back from Italy and that I loved the little dry hot peppers in oil they gave to spice things up, he immediately ran to the kitchen and brought back a huge jar of peperoncino intero in olio. He is from Calabria (the \"toe\" of Italy's \"boot\"), known for these spicy peppers. His mother is coming over from there soon. I could sense he was very concerned with getting the restaurant in shape for a mother's approval. Such a nice man. You can't help rooting for him to make this a success.", "author": "Stephen H."}

And then we sampled their amazing gnocchi with three sauces: pesto, marinara and white sauce. It was like a real life Italian Flag. They we sampled an amazing Short Rib dish with a side of potatoes and squash. And then it tasting was their truly unique Eggplant Parmesan topped with a layer of Creamy Polenta. Delish!

Having lived in Italy for many years, including Naples, I can honestly say the brick oven pizzas live up to the Southern Italian benchmark. The waitstaff is very friendly, humble, and hard working, as are the cooks. Vittorio is a sweet man who always speaks Italian with me and makes my friends and I feel right at home. While the pizzas are amazing, I also like the burrata and the homemade raviolis. If you get a chance, order the homemade artichoke ravioli with pesto sauce. Im not a pesto fan but the sauce is so simple, delicate, and rich and fresh that I got past my aversion and succumbed to Vittorio's careful and authentic touch. \nThis restaurant makes me feel lucky I have a house near west portal!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-29", "description": "So, this place looked freekin' awesome... with all these amazing reviews, I was going to be pretty easy to impress.\n\nAnd at first, I was impressed. The burrata caprese and burrata and prosciutto bruschetta were - in a word - incredible. The burrata was just flat delicious. The bread in the bruschetta could have been _a little_ less toasted/crispy, but if that was my only complaint, we were doing pretty good. With these two appetizers delighting our mouths, we were thrilled to get to our main courses.\n\nI ordered the day's special: lobster ravioli with a creamy tomato sauce. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. And our visiting friend ordered the porcini ravioli.\n\nAll sounded screechingly awesome. In all cases, the textures were perfect. But, in all cases, there was just something missing. With an embarrassing amount of salt added, things got \"better,\" but with no help that we were able to provide did they reach \"good.\"\n\nThe lobster ravioli tasted less like lobster and more like the water in which the lobster was cooked. In my experience, lobster is an easy flavor to deliver with a punch. This just somehow failed. Again, the textures were perfect... and I was excited as I first put it in my mouth... it just finished off very anticlimactically. I ate all of it, but was wildly underwhelmed.\n\nMy boyfriend's gnocchi, again, had a wonderful texture. I really wanted to love this, too -- maybe they just screw up the specials, but they nail the hell out of the standard menu items, right? But it tasted less like gorgonzola and more like a basic alfredo sauce. I couldn't eat more than two or three off his plate. He left probably a third or more on his plate..... and, just no. We're fat grrls, ok? We don't leave food. Just sayin.\n\nOur friend's porcini ravioli is the dish I considered getting before I learned about the specials.... and, again, I was excited he let me try some. Again, the textures were great... but, again, the flavors were barely meh. Mushrooms? How? I don't understand.\n\nLike I said, we were able to vaguely salvage things by salting the ever-loving crap out of everything.... but that is neither what I want to do, nor what I should have to do. Also it didn't completely save it.... it took things from meh to ok.\n\nThrough the whole experience, we felt confused. We kept asking each other, \"what is it missing?\" The best answer we could come up with was: \"flavor.\" Everything about the things we ordered SCREAMED flavor, but the deliveries barely whispered it.\n\nOn top of this, the service was pretty weak. For example, it took upwards of 20 minutes after our plates were cleared before we got our check. Normally, this would be fine.... but, given the lackluster meal, the absence of stellar service kinda stood out more than it otherwise would have.", "author": "Rob C."}

There was a 10-15 minute wait for dinner, but the host made a point to show us proper and welcoming attention. From the outset, one could sense two ongoing themes. Firstly, the staff held themselves to a very high standard of service. They were incredibly professional, helpful, and friendly. Secondly, the authenticity of the food was superb. We got several antipastas and main courses and everything was excellent both in taste and presentation. The only critique I will make is that the beer I had, a Sierra Nevada pale ale, tasted a bit funky but perhaps that's what I get for ordering one of the two beers among 100s of wine options.", "author": "Danny A."}

The employees were very friendly, even though they botched our order (apparently didn't place it at all) , they fixed it pretty quickly and were quite pleasant about it.  \n\nThe pizza margherita was nice and thin, with nicely - properly slightly burnt crust.  The sauce was really tasty, the pepperoni which we had added seemed under cooked (still chewy).  There was a bit much cheese for me.  I always see a really good margherita with a few slabs of mozzarella gracing the top, this had lots of cheese, almost like a regular pizza, not a fancy margherita.  Nice fresh basil leaves on top too.  \n\nThe prices are very fair, especially for West Portal, where most things are a ridiculously priced joke.  \n\nThe restaurant is silly loud.  Trying to talk to my date was like trying to hold a conversation at a club.  It may be the acoustics in this building because the Cafe which was here before was also silly loud. \n\nThey remodeled the interior and took away about half of the seating space with a bar seating area.  I should say that the marble bar is really cool, and they have a  bad ass pizza oven behind the bar area, which I'm sure cost them zillions of dollars.  \n\nOverall I like the vibe, the menu, the staff.  I think it's a good additional to my hood.  This first visit was average, but  the place has potential and I shall return to give it another shot, and update my review.", "author": "Bee L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-10-13", "description": "Fiance said, after walking out of this restaurant, \"I think I'd rather go to Olive Garden.\"\n\nMaybe we caught them on an off night?  Or none them have been to Italy?  Or none of them have even been to Tony's and had the Margherita pizza there, which, and I've searched long and hard for this, is the closest thing to the pizza I had in Naples.\n\nOur little group of 3 walked in around 5:15 PM and were seated immediately.  The inside was very warm and welcoming, a true neighborhood joint.  We noticed a larger group a few tables down, with about 5 children between the ages of 6 and 10.  The children were shrieking and laughing and chattering away so loudly that the adults had to raise their voices to speak to one another.  The sheer volume of that table's conversations made it impossible for us to hear each other, even though we were sitting right next to each other.  Finally I shot a glare towards that table, and one of the adults told the children that they needed to quiet down a bit.  Luckily they were almost done, so we only had to endure the noise for a bit longer.  This immediately downgraded my first impression of the restaurant, because whenever you have a LOUD group of children with adults who don't teach them to use their \"inside voices,\" you're basically nothing more than an Applebee's.  Ugh, I sound like a snob, but it's totally true.\n\nSince I'd read great reviews of the Margherita pizza, the pappardelle with wild boar ragu, and the gnocchi, we decided to order all of those, and my aunt added in the pumpkin ravioli.  We were served bread and olive oil (but no balsamic vinegar, which I found odd), and our Margherita pizza came very quickly.  Fiance also ordered the insalata mista, which he said had zero flavor or seasoning, as it was some leafy greens with olive oil and nothing else.\n\nI was so excited because our Margherita looked amazing, until I took my first bite.  There was absolutely no flavor or seasoning.  The sauce was plain, the dough/crust was plain.. I could have basically been eating a handful of flour.  Once I added a pinch of salt onto the pizza, it magically transformed.  But seriously, if you're going to hail yourself as an Italian restaurant, I shouldn't need to shake the salt over the food myself.\n\nMy gnocchi, while very tender and pillowy soft, was also completely flavorless, as was the tomato sauce.  It got me wondering if they had actually opened a can of tomato sauce, because it looked and tasted EXACTLY like a can of generic, unsalted and unseasoned tomato sauce.  The same sauce was used in the wild boar ragu, and the meat was dry and tough.\n\nWe had NO desire to have dessert after the meal; Fiance and I are both big eaters, but neither of us wanted to finish our meals.  I'm sorry, Trattoria da Vittorio, did you run out of seasoning or something last night?  Because nothing I had there made me want to return.  Italian food is supposed to be cooked with love and zest, but nothing about our dishes last night came close.", "author": "Tori S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-24", "description": "Went there yesterday for my kid's 4th birthday. The restaurant is very cute. It was completely full by 6 p.m. - mostly families with kids and retired folks. I really appreciated the fact that this restaurant has a kids menu - so few in San Francisco do!  I am guessing the clientele changes if you go later. The owner - Vittorio - greeted us at the door and came by to check on us a few times. He obviously really cares and seems like a really nice guy. The wait staff was very friendly, attentive, and accommodating. \nSo, 5 stars for service.\n\nThe food was hit-and-miss. The menu is a mix of what seem to be Southern Italian and Tuscan selections. My husband had the calzone and said it was one of the best he'd had outside of Italy. I had the papardelle with wild boar ragu. It was OK - a little underseasoned, and the boar could have used more braising. It did not come close to the pasta I'd had in Tuscany or in the South of Italy. But not bad for a neighborhood Italian restaurant. The kid had the Micky Mouse pizza. It was pretty disappointing. The idea was cute, but the \"ears\" of the mouse were just dough. The actual pizza part of this pizza - i.e. the part with sauce and cheese - had the diameter of a large orange. My son was still kind of hungry after he finished his food because he didn't eat the crust. \n\nThe desserts were great: the grown-ups shared a lemon tartuffo drenched in limoncello (yum!) and the kid had a chocolate tartuffo, which he polished off despite an abundance of nuts.\n\nWine by the glass selection is good.\n\nSo, 3.5 stars for the food. 4 stars overall (food gets slightly heavier weighting than service :-)\n\nRequest for Vittorio: it would be great if the kid's pizza were just a regular 6\" round cheese pizza, preferably with shredded cheese instead of sliced Mozzarella (my kid was a little put off by having to bite through large chunks of cheese). And while we are on the subject of kid-friendly foods, some vanilla and chocolate gelato would be awesome too!\n\nBottom line for us: we'll definitely come back for a nice dinner out with the kid. For Italian food on a date night, we'll probably choose some place that's a little fancier - like Flour + Water or Perbacco.", "author": "Ann P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-15", "description": "Mom took us to dinner at Trattoria da Vittorio for my birthday. She lives in the neighborhood and has eaten there a few times. We arrived early because the restaurant doesn't take reservations and we wanted to get a table. We arrived about 5:30pm and the restaurant was almost full.\n\nIt's very, very loud in there and my mom is elderly, so her hearing and eye-sight isn't great. I had to shout what was on the menu because it was incredibly loud in the restaurant. Please, please put some carpet on the floor to quiet it down in there and perhaps a bench with pillows at the entrance, so the people waiting to east can at least sit down. The waiter arrived and told us the specials. The halibut with prawns sounded great, which Mom and my other half ordered. I noticed gluten-free pasta and asked what kind of pasta and what it comes with, re: fish? chicken? veal? beef? veggies? The waiter didn't know and asked the chef. He subsequently advised that they will prepare a gluten-free penne made of corn with whichever sauce I'd like. I opted for the veal marsala instead, as that was served with potatoes.\n\nMom and I ordered their beet salad with Arugula and my other half started with the fried calamari. Mom had a glass of chardonnay and I asked the waiter to recommend a red. He suggested the Chianti La Maialina and I agreed. My other half ordered a Coke. Sliced baguette was on the table with olive oil, but it needed salt, so I tapped salt into the olive oil, which made a difference. The salads arrived and both were well-covered with red wine vinegar, but there wasn't any noticeable olive oil on the Arugula, which made the salad overly tart. The fresh beets were a good counter to the vinegar on the salad, but it really needed olive oil. The calamari came with an unusual and delicious sauce made of olive oil, basil, and mint. The combination of these ingredients was fabulous, and unusual for fried calamari.\n\nThe sauce for the veal marsala was excellent and a generous portion was served. However, the veal was pounded very, very thin and there was a very small amount of meat on the plate. Instead there was a generous portion of purple cabbage, spinach, and carrots with one or two small red potatoes saut\u00e9ed. The halibut with prawns was very good and the sauce was amazing! Mom also had the brussel sprouts with ricotta cheese. She loved them(!). Unfortunately, when the sprouts were served the waiter neglected to tell us that the container was heated. I picked up the sprouts container to put it on Mom's plate and burned my fingers. THEN the maitre d warned that the container was heated. Gee, thanks.\n\nIt was impossible to have a conversation at the dinner table because the it was so loud in the restaurant, which really takes away from dining out. The staff were all very friendly and mindful of the line of people waiting to sit down to eat. In fact, the moment I finished my last sip of wine, the busboy took my glass from the table. Our plates were also cleared very quickly. It felt like we were being rushed out of there. \n\nBut because it was my birthday, we ordered dessert and coffee. I had the chocolate mousse and Mom got the tiramisu. Both were excellent and we each were served a large portion of each. The whipped cream atop the chocolate mousse was lightly sweetened and incredibly good.\n\nThe bill for dinner was $171 before tip. $200 for three people is a reasonable amount, especially since the food was so good. I would note that if you're hungry, don't order the veal marsala. Even with the vegetables and potatoes, it was not a lot of food. The halibut special offered a more generous portion with the prawns, potatoes, and vegetables.", "author": "SFer O."}

Waiter gets NO STARS, owners get 5, and some points towards a star because I have a heart and cant give a new restaurant 1 star for it might damage their rep on yelp- averaged of 3 stars\n\nI came here last night with my sister and sat outside. The food was good and the owners were nice and checked in on us and other tables; However, our waiter was a complete jerk!\n\nFirst let me just tell you that I'm a sweet young looking girl. I'm 21 but easily mistaken for a 14-16 year old. My family owns a few restaurants, so I am always polite when out  at dinner.\n\nNow, onto my waiter- hes a dude with a tragus peircing and a STRONG italian accent. It began when I asked a question and he started to slur his language out of his mouth as if I were an italian girl and could understand him. I kindly smiled and said \"I'm sorry, I couldn't understand, can you slow down and repeat?\" I meant well and really just wanted to know the answer to my question. He looked at me as if I were some annoying white amrican girl, then turned to asked my sister if she had any questions. He completely just ignored me and moved on. He came back around to our table about 10 min later to take our order. He looks at me and said \"what do you want?\", then turnes to my sister and said \"miss, did you decide?\" Thats when I started to realize he may not like me but I could be over analyzing, so I brushed it off. Clearly, I was not over analyzing. He came and gone to our table but asked ONLY my sister if everything was alright. Honestly, I don't really care if a waiter comes up to me and askes if i'm alright. If im not, im pretty good at being assertive but this did sting my soft heart a bit. Besides, the bus boy was doing an awsome job on asking us if we wanted any more water and if we were good with a welcoming smile. After we finished our main course is when he really started to get on my nerves. I had the nutella and my sister had the cheesecake. I shared mine and my sister had a few bites of hers but really liked the taste of mine, leaving us with an empty nutella plate and a to-go cheesecake. He comes around and again, looks at my sister and asked if she liked her cake and then to my surprise turns to me. Pause here for a moment- when he is turning to me, I automatically thinking, 'wow is he finally going to ask if everything was okay and if i liked my dish?'. WRONG! He says, \"you ate it all?\". His tone of voice was a bit dull. It came off rude. My sister caught that, too. Just to clarify that i'm not some sensitive \"american girl\". She saw my face get more annoyed everytime he opened his mouth, so she nicely asked for the check. He gives the little black booklet with a check of $72. something. I put in a $100 dollar bill and wait for him to pick it up. He comes over pulls out a bunch of cash from his pocket and askes me \"how much do I owe you?\". I looked at him implying 'Please do not do this over here;Take this to the register!'. Right then, I was shocked and even the table on the otherside of the window pointed with a surprised look on how he is handling this check. He slamms 1, $20 bill; 1, $5 bill; and 2, $1 dollar bills on the table. You think he cant get worst than this but he does. After throwing the money down, he just stands there staring at me, expecting me to hand him a tip right then and there. I looked at him like he was an idiot for doing this right here in the first place and to BACK OFF. I asked for 2, $10 bills in exchange for the 20 dollar bill he gave me. There's no way in hell, I was he giving a 20 dollar tip for a $72 bill and with an attitude like that he is on drugs. He came back with a stack of ones saying \"ill exchange my ones for your 20\". Yea, what smart thinking. I'm just going to give you 15 ones right back. Asking for smaller bills after a meal is kind of a known gesture of \"I need change for tip\". He counts out 5 ones and puts it on the table and STOPS as if he deserved the rest for himself. I look at him and said \"umm okay wheres the rest?\". When he finally puts 20 ones down on the table, I put the money that I had in my hand down (a 5 dollar bill and 2, 1 dollar bills), so I could count the ones. When I did this, he grabs the $5 bill instantly and walks away! Are you serious right now!?!?! What kind of watier handles money like that?? I still gave him a 20 percent tip because this guy is aboviously broke and he probably needs the cash more than I do if he has the nerve to be a money grubbing waiter. Plus my family always told me growing up about how waiters pay works, and how I should never tip lower than 20% even if your experience sucked but to alert the manager if your experience wasn't all that great. I'll return because the food was alright but it will be under a last resort option and If I get this waiter again, i'll ask for another.", "author": "Kara S."}

I ordered the roasted beet salad. It literally had ONE beet, ONE strawberry with allot of arugula and TWO pine nuts. The waiter brought us bread and it was 2 little pieces. Despite having like 20 waiters around it took forever to get our food. That part should improve as they get setlled.  The owner is the nicest man. My entree was OK but really expensive. I hope they can work out the kinks, but I fear their bottom line will drive people away. High prices and then they skimp on ingredients. West Portal needs a great family restaurant. Good cheap food and kid friendly. Unfortunately this is not it.", "author": "J J."}

This restaurant also has a patio and is worth the wait if there ever is one. Walking distance from MUNI and a ton of street parking. I usually end up getting their special of the night. A few recent dishes have been a grilled white fish with asparagus, Shrimp with risotto, and I believe a pumpkin ravioli. I have ALWAYS enjoyed every meal. There has never been one complaint from anyone at the table. The staff is so nice and they almost all have an Italian accent. This is REAL ITALIAN!!!!", "author": "Circuit D."}

The lines are long as is the wait to be seated.  I thoroughly enjoy the interior makeover from the old Caf\u00e9 for All Seasons, which was LONGGG in the tooth for change after having fallen into the hands of do nothing proprietors who cared nothing for a well-established clientele and who ran the business into the ground.\n\nI was seated almost immediately as a party of one at the counter.  Frankly, I don't care for the wide screen TV - this is not a sports bar or BJs in Tanforan.  The waiter was cordial and perfunctory.  I was to be surprised by him at the conclusion of the meal when he refilled my wine glass - gratis.  Very nice... hence the second star.\n\nI ordered the gluten free pasta with a meat Bolognese sauce after completing the house \"MIsta\" salad.  The salad was so lacking in dressing, content, and flavor as to be almost 'dry' for want of attention - a pile of greens and nothing more for $8... Geezzz.  Disappointment number one.  \n\nThe gentleman preparing salads was more interested in the TV I suspect as he was standing in front of me preparing the salads and busily conversing in Italian with a fellow employee - equally fixated on a soccer game in Spain as he shoved pizzas into an awaiting oven.\n\nI asked the waiter to bring me a glass of Merlot with the main course.  Instead, it appears while I'm eating my bland and flavorless salad.  The wine was the best event of the evening - one of the best Merlot's I've ever consumed.\n\nAfter finishing the salad, I watched soccer (bored me to tears).  The orders for two different groups of customers on each side of me were botched and improperly prepared.  They were sent back.  The waiter made it right on both accounts, but I was now on high alert.  Both parties looked equally disappointed and stared aimlessly at their companions or the TV for lack of anything else to do.\n\nAbout five minutes later, the Bolognese shows up - steaming but looking a bit strange: it was very dark in color and with little to no hint of meat on first glance.  The plate was sloppily presented with sauce splattered all over it.\n\nIT WAS THE MOST BLAND, TASTELESS AMALGAM OF TOMATO SAUCE and something else - I don't know what - that I've ever had at an Italian restaurant!  Bring on the Olive Garden, folks.\n\nThere were NO hints of garlic, meat, basil, oregano, seasoning - Italian or otherwise!  $17 my friends. A bag of Tinkyada Gluten Free Pasta at Trader Joe's is $2.99...  I could have purchased a can of Basil and Oregano Tomato sauce at Whole Foods up the street and had a better dining experience.\n\nThat was the turning point for me:  No $8 desserts.  I was tired of the noise, the glaring TV screen, and a waiter who was more interested in patronizing me for a tip than asking if I enjoyed the meal (he didn't).  I'll go across the street to the competition...  You might want to do so, too, and avoid the lines.\n\nAll told with a 15% gratuity:  $45...... for at most $15 worth of food.  Sad experience.", "author": "William S."}

On the second time the waiter arrived, he took our order but did not bring the vinegar that I asked for initially, so I asked a second time. ...Seriously, isn't the vinegar bottled?? How hard is it to bring the bottle or a small cup? Then the owner, Vittorio, stopped by our table to see how we were doing. Basically I told him I asked for the vinegar twice and he quickly went and brought it in 10 seconds.\nWe ordered margherita pizza and lasagna. They were delicious but they were not served hot. In fact, the lasagna was more room temp, which is sad, because the meat sauce was tasty. We had also asked for red pepper flakes with our pizza but we it never arrived and we were not going to ask 3x again.\nWe had a talk with the owner, Vittorio, on our way out of the restaurant.

Finally!  \n\nJust got home from our first visit and we can't wait to go back.  This is a warm, homey atmosphere where the pasta is fresh, the tastes are authentic and the waiters\\waitresses are friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nWife had a seafood pasta dish with fresh pasta and some of the most succulent salmon I've tasted with all the shellfish you'd expect. delicious. I went for the braised ribs and polenta. The ribs were so tender they fell apart when i gave them a dirty look. polenta was good, but not mind blowing.   Both dishes were recommended by the waiter, Lorenzo.  good job on that. \n\nWe ordered the Nutella canzone to go. Lorenzo brought us tiramisu on the house while we waited. \n\nyou can get great authentic Italian pizza at gialina, Delphin and several other places now. I may not have any pizza here for a while because of that and the fact that their other dishes look to be on par with the good pizza you can get these days, but is so much more elusive. good Italian that isn't pizza is such a score in this city and we scored with this likely soon to be fave.  \nthis place isn't as good as the best restaurants we ate at in italy, which is why 4 stars and not 5. it's close enough to make grin from ear to ear, though.  gratzie!!", "author": "Brandon G."}

By chance I wandered past the restaurant to find it transformed into one of the most inviting and welcoming restaurants West Portal has seen in years. Many of the locals I know mention how it has revitalized the street and there is little doubt judging by the long line that forms daily around 6pm. \n\nApproaching the Trattoria pretty much guarantees you are met with a warm greeting, hearty handshake and an authentic welcome - every time. I only wish other establishments could learn from this practice. Dining here feels like you are walking into a big inviting Italian family dinner. \n\nI love having a choice of eating on the heated patio (I have a dog), the dining room with guests or the long marble bar when I'm dining solo. \n\nI have a fairly restrictive diet so focus on some favorites including beet salads; antipasto and an amazing brussels sprout special made with bacon and gorgonzola. I could go on and on but trust me and go experience for yourself. \n\nOn a final note the place is always spotless. That's very important to me and I have a keen eye.

Last night was at least my sixth time dining in my new Italian neighborhood restaurant, and it will be my last.  What a shame.  You never know what you will get to eat, or how much they will charge you for your drinks.  We just wanted pizza, and I remembered that when I ordered the Italian sausage pizza a couple of months ago, it came topped with something resembling oscar meyer wieners.  When I mentioned this to the waiter, a vero italiano, he assured me that it was indeed Italian sausage on top of the Pizza.  I just shook my head.  Pizza Hut has better Italian sausage.  So knowing this,  last night I ordered the Margarita pizza, with pepperoni added on for an extra buck.   A pizza with at least one half pound of pepperoni arrived.  So much pepperoni that you couldn't even see what was underneath, and that was a good thing, because it was by no means a margarita, which has white mozzarella cheese, green basil, and red tomato sauce.  This pizza had almost no cheese, a thin suggestion of tomato sauce, and nothing green at all anywhere.  Mostly dough and enough pepperoni to keep me up all night.  \n  But I really won't go back because we ordered Chianti and had two glasses, which was OK because the wine list has a $7 glass, and their glasses are big.   the waiter didn't ask what kind of Chianti we wanted, and when the bill came, there was a $22 charge for the wine.

Sadly, that was the only good part of our lunch. Caprese burratta could have bee good, but the tomatoes were hard, chewy, and tasteless. We decided to try a pasta instead, ordering gnocchi pesto. What a disaster.  Primary taste was salt, followed by cream with a vague taste of pesto. Ugh. The waiter kindly took it back and even tasted it himself and agreed it was salty. Even without too much salt it was horrible.  There are quite a few restaurants in the neighborhood that are far better. We give one star because the waiter tried so hard to make up for the bad food.", "author": "Pacifica Gals B."}

I think that all the old people in the area, reflects in their food. Tired and bland with no flavor at all, it tastes like hospital food. I ordered the pasta pescatora, the tomato sauce was watery and very bland (no salt, pepper, onions, garlic nothing) straight from the can. The seafood had no seasoning at all. There is no way that all of the seafood was fresh either, because the calamaris tasted like rubber. We also ordered the chicken milanese which wasn't seasoned at all and had no flavor the sauce was straight from the can but this time less watery and more paste. Even the pizza sucked, the tomato sauce was lacking some serious seasoning. (Even pizza hut can make a better pizza wtf).\nIn conclusion I think that its safe to say Trattoria Da Vittorio is in need of a new spice rack because the one currently in the kitchen isn't in service.\n\nThe latin cooks were to busy socializing then, tasting the food that was coming out of the kitchen. When the bus boy came and took the food I said that all the food tasted like hospital food, and he chuckled and smiled. The worst part is the place is extremely overpriced for the portion you get.", "author": "philip g."}

We did not think the food was that great. We ordered off the specials menu, lobster spaghetti and lamb chops. Firstly, we were put off by the fact that our plates arrived about 3 minutes after we ordered, that is not an exaggeration. It looked pretty good but the spaghetti was dry and the lamb was small and quite fatty. The gnocchi that accompanied the lamb was super stodgy and the sauce did not taste fresh. We were hungry so we ate the small portions pretty quick. The waiter then brought the desert menus (super quick) and banged on about the Nutella calzone, before we looked at the other deserts he started taking the menus back assuming that was what we wanted. I had to explain that we'd like a few minutes to read the menu first. We chose the chocolate mousse dessert (which was nice) and before we new it we were out the door, a little bit dazed and dismayed.

The food and service that followed did not let us down as the Buratta Tomato appetizer followed by either pasta or fish or the short ribs were all met with high marks around the table. Another note is that the glass of wine you receive is a \"Glass of wine\" and not some smaller sampling that you see in a knockoff Italian restaurant.

It was so good that I brought my husband back 3 days later and he liked it as much as my cousin and I did. Both times I had the sandwich that they serve on pizza dough bread with burrata chese, meatballs and marinara sauce. Since I'm the kind of foodie who likes to eat each ingredient solo, I requested the sandwich to arrive deconstructed. They happily obliged. It came with a nice salad, and they allowed me to substitute beet salad for the regular one. Yum. The burrata cheese was a whole party in my mouth, as were each of the other ingredients. I paired burrata with the plain pizza dough bread and it was a knock out. The meatballs and sauce were a perfect stand-alone. My cousin had the same thing, but the regular way. She loved hers too....and when we returned my husband had the same thing and loved it. This will be a destination to frequent relatively often. I'm so grateful to have found it.

The atmosphere is quite inviting, and had a family feel yet dimly lit giving a very romantic quality to the space.  Our servers and the staff that attended to our needs were very accommodating and respectful to our little one's need to be completely gluten free.  This in and of itself is a very welcome change.  Thank you!  The wine that was recommended was wonderful along with the three wonderful entrees we ordered.  The first entree was something none of us have had the pleasure of having before, It was the Homemade Pasta Fiocchetti, which were almost like a dumpling consisting of three cheeses wrapped in a thin pasta in a creamy sauce with a sweet hint of pear.  They were absolutely amazing. Next we had the Veal Scaloppine which was also just perfect, nice thin slices of veal cooked to perfection in a mushroom marsala sauce that needed absolutely nothing. And for our gluten free entree we had the seafood pasta.  The pasta was wonderful and the mix of seafood in a light red sauce that induced only sounds of contentment could not have been better.  No, no desserts for us.  We were way to full to indulge.  And that my friends is Trattoria Da Vittorio.  Enjoy", "author": "Josh L."}

It was crispy and tender, but was not seasoned, so it was bland.  \n\nI ordered orange juice for my children, which they provided without the lids.  We had to ask another server for the lids.\n\nFor entrees, we had Pappardelle with Ragu, Osso Bucco over risotto (the risotto still had some bite - some might like it that way, but I like mine a little more tender), gnocci in a gorgonzola cream sauce (very tender), veal scaloppini and a kids pasta and tomato sauce.    There were no vegetables with any of the entrees and no sides of vegetables were offered on the menu, otherwise, I would have ordered some vegtables.  The food did come quickly, which was appreciated since we had to wait for about 30 mins for a table.\n\nHalf way through our entrees I noticed that they never brought us bread, though the tables around us were provided bread.\n\nWe ordered tiramisu, the apple tart and the cannoli for dessert.  As the evening went on, the noise level increased, so the waiter did not hear our complete dessert order.  When he provided the check, without the tiramisu and apple tart, we informed him of the error, and he apologized, but I feel he should have made some concession, as they started cleaing the table with us still there, and we had to inform other servers that we were waiting for our dessert.  \n\nThey never provided us the correct number of settings.  There were 6 of us, and when we were seated, there were only 3 settings on a table.  We had to ask for the additional 2 settings, twice.  When we ordered dessert, they only brought 4 forks - we had to ask for another 2 forks.  \n\nOverall this place is OK.  It could be good if they can (1) figure out how to control the noise level (my ears are still ringing), (2) be more consistent with the service, and (3) turn off the TV!

I wish I had been with those above people.  We sat at the bar.  No wine or beer offered and presume permit is pending.  We ordered the caprese burratta, tomato salad with a reduction of balsamic vinegar to share.  We watched him prepare the salad with great intensity.  One roma tomato sliced into the thinnest 6 slices were placed on a plate.  The burratta was in a pastry bag and squeezed onto the tomato, herbs chopped and balsamic vinegar squirted on and two green olives.  If we closed our eyes we would not have known what we were eating.  No flavor to the tomatoes and cut so thin that we could not pick them up.  I even put the tip of my finger into the reduction of vinegar and it was tasteless and watery.  I have better vinegar in my cupboard.  Do not order this meager tasteless appetizer.  We also ordered a bruschetta to share.  The bread was toasted earlier and then placed on the edge of the pizza oven to toast again.  Three small toasts cut in half that were so hard to bite into that we could have broken a tooth.  After spending time in Italy, the bread should be charred and then immediately served with topping - not  left to harden into pucks.  We watched the chaos in the open kitchen and saw a pizza sit for 25 minutes (not under a lamp) and then served to someone and other dishes just sitting and getting cold.  We never received our main course so asked the waitress for our bill, paid for our appetizers and left.

I don't know what to think though, when the pasta (except pizza) is the weakest point of their menu. I was the only one who ordered the pasta (the ravioli) and although it was good, it wasn't great. My brother has come before, and he told me that their lasagna was good too but not great either. BUT their specials, soups, fish dishes, and their other secondi dishes were great. So delicious. My brother got pork chops (special of the day) and everyone loved it. Their soup (lentils) were not too salty and had a great flavor. And their fish dish was great too. Even the pizza (margherita) was very nice (delicious mix of tomato sauce and cheese). Among these amazing dishes, the pasta was a bit of a letdown. I expected since it was an Italian restaurant that they'd have amazing pasta dishes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-19", "description": "We tried out the Trattoria on their second day of business - so I will start by saying that I expected that there would be kinks to work out and I anticipate that we will return to try again. The restaurant was busy and lively, and I could tell the servers and the kitchen were struggling to keep things moving smoothly. The ambiance was warm, however the lights could have been dimmer. The complimentary bread and olive oil was ok - and they seemed to have run out over the course of our meal. Our appetizers were somewhat disappointing. We tried the salted cod bruscetta and the bread was too hard and the cod somewhat tasteless. The other app we had was a ricotta/ brussel sprout appetizer and this I don't think quite worked. It was basically a small pot of creamy and warm ricotta with a few leaves of brussel sprouts. There was a side of 5-6 homemade croutons (?). So when you served yourself, you got 90% warm goopy cheese and a sliver or 2 of brussel sprout leaf. Very weird. I had the wild boar ragu over paperdelle and this was delicious and an ample portion. My husband had the homemade gnocchi with pesto sauce and he felt his portion was humble. In addition, the presentation was such that it was just a small pile of gnocchi on the plate with no garnish. He said it was light and fluffy - delicious - but just not really enough (and we don't eat very large portions). The servers were attentive and working hard to keep people happy, and I think Vittorio may have served us up our meals which is nice. We did not try the pizza, but there were many being ordered. I think we will wait and give this place one more chance as we think we will really like it once the kinks are worked out.", "author": "Anne Y."}

I hesitate to let the world know, to keep it our little secret. On opening night, though extremely busy, the service and food were stellar in every way! The gnocchi was melt-in-your mouth delicate, the best I've had, equal to any I've eaten in Italy. The short ribs were tender and very flavorful. The arancini were light and delicate and the salad dressed just right. The tiramisu was more than enough to share. The servers were friendly and professional, while being attentive. I will return to try the rest of the menu. (The pizzas were flying out of the special oven and looked fantastic.) If I can't go to Italy soon, I can at least go to Vittorio's!", "author": "Sue R."}

But we had a wonderful dinner there one evening and it's a great addition to the neighborhood.Besides the very good and authentic food, the best thing about it is the lively atmosphere it's bringing to the street. Instead of looking deserted and ready to close by 9:30, like most places on the street, there are still folks waiting to be seated and enjoying a glass of wine at the outside tables. It's great to have a place with a buzz around it.", "author": "Elizabeth H."}

It's wonderful to have this neighborhood restaurant open again-- and it is definitely a place we will come back to repeatedly. The interior looks great-- there's a fantastic new bar area, dark wood paneling and a great warm, modern feel to the space. We had the beet salad and Brussels sprouts and shared one of their pizzas. Everything was delicious-- especially the pizza! The wine list has a very good selection of domestic and Italian wines. The service was incredibly friendly and helpful. The tiramisu was some of the best we've ever had. We even got to meet and talk with Vittorio, the owner, and were able to welcome him personally to the neighborhood!  What a delight-- we look forward to trying lunch sometime soon and coming back again for dinner and trying out more of the entrees!", "author": "Monika E."}

We ordered two of \"Mama's Specials,\" the lasagne and eggplant Parmesan.  They were tasty but the centers were cold.  This after being told we had to wait 10 to 15 minutes to prepare these orders. When the dishes did arrive, the waiter argued with my wife about whether she should have grated cheese added to her plate. My Italian Grandmother would have boxed my ears for serving one of her recipes cold.  Don't think we'll return.", "author": "Gregory G."}

My favorite vacation site is northern Italy, and I've eaten Italian food (or renditions of it) in more than a dozen countries. Vittoriio is producing 9 and 10 level food (it is as good as it gets) at 6 to 7 level pricing--in short, very fine food at bargain prices. The service is as excellent as the wonderful food, The venue is a subdued, pleasingly decorated large room with about two dozen tables and the pizza-building station and oven off to the side encircled by about a dozen counter seats. Noise level high, but not unusually so. The house wine is good and also a bargain (certainly so as compred to other S.F. restaurants of this caliber). I travel a 40 mile round trip to get up here from San Mateo: I think that says it all. Vittorio is a charming and accommodating host.", "author": "William G."}

The people working there are very nice and they care about having good Italian food....because they are Italian people.  But my last visit was less than I expected.     I am writing mainly to the restaurant managers and not customers.    One problem is the room itself.....it's way to noisy due to low ceiling and tile floor.    When the room is full, people end up screaming at each other in order to be heard across the tables.     Also, the service seemed a bit frantic with service people running around desperately trying to get dishes to the tables.    The result is the guests sense the problem and can't relax and enjoy their food.  I was also disappointed in a beet salad which had a very bitter lettuce which was also a bit tough.    The pumpkin soup was lovely.   I had a pizza with sausage but I was very disappointed in the sausage....not flavorful and looked as if not well prepared.    It was not ground sausage like in Italian sausage, but was more like a pieces sliced  bologna that  seemed barely cooked.   I basically like this restaurant and want it to succeed.  But they have to address a few problems.    I not sure if they will.", "author": "Charles L."}

We got the insalate mista, arancini and pizza margarita - all were very good. We also got a nice bottle of wine which did take a while to get to us (but as I mentioned before they were very busy). One of the best pizzas I've had in a while - the crust was that perfect thin and blistery but not crackery crust with just the right amount of cheese, sauce and basil and a few drops of olive oil.", "author": "B.J.

We were offered seats at the counter which I would normally turn down, but am glad we accepted.  Such a  great vantage point to witness the flow and excitement of a busy kitchen.  The star of the night was Giovanni. He was our waiter and the restaurant GM.  So pleasant, such attention to detail, bringing more sauce when needed, anticipating additional drinks at just the right moment, a real professional  who made our dining experience all the better.  He cared about the food .  The owner is always wonderful and the west portal community is so happy to have his restaurant  along with the kind hostess, pizza craftsman, fine chefs and waiters.

We first noticed that the owner and many employees are actually Italian, which makes it feel very authentic. We were seated immediately, but not before being welcomed by just about everyone working on the floor.  The server helped us choose, and he did an excellent job. The food was fabulous.  I had chicken milanaise with eggplant parm.  Best parm I have even had!  Melts in your mouth!  My husband had seafood risotto.  He said it was just okay, not anything special.  My sister had noodles with meat sauce; it was homemade and delicious.  Let me warn you, though... they will pour you another glass of wine without your asking for it, nor do they ask.  When the bill comes, you are charged for all of them.  So be careful; they are not pouring to  be generous; they're pouring to make more  money. I think they should ask first.  I want to mention that the owner is a super nice guy, extremely hospitable and attentive.  The service from all the staff was excellent!", "author": "Roberta B."}

I don't drink but my husband wanted a Mimosa and the waiter very kindly advised us on the 'Bottomless' deal so that's what my husband ordered. The waiter delivered a carafe of the stuff along with 2 filled glasses, so I brought it to his attention that this was a single order of the bottomless deal and that I wasn't having any, he said \"he would have brought a 2nd glass anyway\", so we thought how generous of them, they expected us to share the deal. My glass remained untouched and my husband didn't even finish the carafe. When we got home and looked at the bill, they had charged us for a 'Bottomless Deal' of $15.00 plus a single glass of Mimosa at $8.00. So we felt cheated and they pulled a fast one on us. We will be returning there since the food is so good but we'll be more careful to examine the bill before payment.", "author": "Lilian C."}

Greeted warmly at the door, Vittorio offered a big, beautiful glass of '06 Brunello, wonderful! Started with the calamari fritti which was very good. The beet salad was good as well, but could have used some chevre and pistachios with a light olive oil lemon dressing. The meal became sublime with the house-made gnocchi covered with a perfectly balanced gorgonzola sauce...the Brunello was made for this moment. Light and savory, every bite was heaven. The came the desert, a house-made tiramisu with a cup of delicious Caffe Moreno espresso. The only thing missing was the Centerbe...When will San Francisco realize that liquor is not a sin or to be controlled on every block...not soon enough for Trattoria Da Vittorio. And don't forget the server - ask for Roberto from Roma. He loves what he does and makes the meal seem like a trip down the Via Veneto. And tell him Pietro sent you.
