Perfect for a first date, a professional meeting, or just pulling up your laptop and doing some work. I've had so many great conversations here with baristas and guests alike, it kind of feels like home.\n\nAMBIANCE is warm. The lighting is a bit on the darker side, but the brown tones and space makes the spot feel friendly. I like to sit at the front seats facing the window to take in the daylight.\n\nORDERED previously: matcha iced tea fog, matcha latte, earl grey frappe, coffee. \n\nDRINKS are great. They use ceremonial-grade matcha for their matcha drinks, and they have no issues switching regular milk for almond milk when I'm ordering a dairy drink. \n\nOVERALL four stars. A great spot to visit to get some caffeine and conversation.", "author": "Nicholas G."}

Great place to get work done, people watch, or meet a friend.

Ask for a bathroom key. \n\nThis location can't seem to keep the store clean.

The air was nippy and Peet's, which I've never been to, was right across the street from our hotel in the Castro.  So, we popped in to discuss this important issue over a cup of joe. \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nIt's a good sized coffee shop with a few tables and high tops inside and out.  \n\nMENU:\nCoffee, juice, scones, muffins. \n\nBEVERAGE:\nMocha - Being that I'm not usually a hot beverage drinker, I opted for the small size with whipped cream.  It was way too sweet which overpowered any creaminess and coffee flavors that a good cup of mocha brings.  I'm not sure what happened but the whipped cream looked like a child had squirted it on.  I drank 1/4 of it before tossing it.  Thankfully my drink was paid for by a friend's donated coupon of some kind so it was no loss to me.  \n\nSERVICE:\nThe female barista was friendly, and beverage service was fast.  Another female associate was passing out free samples of banana bread which were good. \n\nOVERALL:\nOverly sweet mocha.  Head to Castro Coffee Company for a better cup.", "author": "Vince N."}

The only reason that I even come here is because it's convenient after going to the gym.\n\n The first time I came here, I ordered a COCONUT BLACK TIE WITH LIGHT ICE! The guy goes and makes my drink in front of me filling the entire cup with ice, and then he proceeds to fill up my drink. When he handed it to me, I already felt how heavy it was and after literally 3 sips, my drink was literally half gone with a lot of ice showing. Since I needed my coffee dose, I had to go to another Peet's located on 16th to get me a new drink!\n\nI decided to give this place another chance considering that I don't usually say \"shit\" about any restaurant or anything without giving them a second chance because it might have just been an off day. Oh boy was I wrong. Ordered the same drink coconut black tie with light ice PLEASE! Drink literally was all ice. God dam! Do you not understand what light ice means !???? Whatever.\n\nThen I've got to thinking, maybe I should try to get a drink without ice\n\nSo today, I went and ordered a MEDIUM sugar free vanilla latte with soy milk and a chocolate croissant. Not surprisingly, the lady made me a SMALL sugar free vanilla latte with soy milk. I told her politely that I think I ordered a MEDIUM. She proceeds to get a MEDIUM cup and pours the SMALL into the MEDIUM CUP in front of me and then hands it to me! ARE YOU FORREAL B**ch! I paid for a MEDIUM not a small. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it in front of everyone, so I just left. But that was just the last straw. It's not even about the money that I'm mad about. It's the way she just poured the small into a MEDIUM expecting that to be okay and without even giving two fucks. On top of that, it wasn't even that busy there. So many people making drinks without even a rush or a line. Is it that hard to make me a new one or add a little bit more to my drink. \n\nNever coming to this Peet's location again!

The time before, when I ordered a small cappuccino, I had to leave before it was ready. There was no line. I had what I thought was ample time--10 minutes left on the parking meter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-13", "description": "I reviewed this place in 2010. Nothing has gotten better. This place has been going downhill for a long time. A flithy restroom where often the only toilet paper is rolling around on the floor, crappy wi-fi, long waits to buy beans because management no longer allows an employee to be stationed there, and mediocre hard product. The soap dispenser is a little plastic pump bottle, because they  decided to give up keeping a working soap dispenser attached to the wall. They no longer even stock paper towels, relying instead on an electric dryer, because they found it too inconvenient to stock paper towels. Now you have to grab your shirttail or your sleeve to open the restroom door after your hands are clean.\n\nBut the crowning glory is a new manager who has no ability to speak in anything less than a yell. I went in today and she barked at me to give her my refillable cup. She then barked at the cashier to charge me for something I had not ordered. I lowered my own voice and told her that she didn't have to yell at me, because I was right there, and no, I did not want the nonfat decaf latte with extra foam, or whatever it was. Later, when she had some time on her hands, she complained loudly--again, her only vocal setting--to her employee that she hates it when she tries to be nice and \"people get defensive.\" When I asked her if she was referring to me, she claimed that she was talking about an employee. The notion that talking about anybody that way, especially while standing in a customer service area, was completely unfathomable to her. \n\nI'm a long-term customer of Peet's, but I've had it. I like a lot of the employees, and I know some of them well enough to know they hate the conditions their company makes them work under, and the continuing decline in the level of service they're able to provide. It's important to remember that there are still locally-owned alternatives in the neighborhood, where the management doesn't yell or think you should have to pick up toilet paper off the floor.", "author": "Paul Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-17", "description": "First things first. I love coffee and have an incredibly open mind to what \"good\" coffee is.\n\nPeet's Coffee is just that. It's good coffee. In fact, as I write this, I am enjoying one of the best tasting cappuccinos I've had in quite some time. I have nothing against Peet's coffee. He makes a great espresso drink and a decent cup of brewed coffee.\n\nMy beef is with this particular location's customer service. \n\nHere is what I experienced the last three times I have visited this Peet's over last few months.\n\nWalk to the bar to place my order. No baristas are at either of the particular ordering stations. I hover between the two, receiving no attempts at service. All three times I have had to call out to get their attention, the baristas are too deep into their personal conversation to pay attention to the bar. And for whatever reason, each of these times, they have made a deal out of the fact that I am not at the \"right\" ordering station. There are two registers with no one at them, how is someone supposed to know which one to go to? Stay at your station and it will make things easier.\n\nOne thing I am particular about is my cappuccino. I want it to be a free-poured, light cup of foam with two shots of espresso at the bottom. Too many coffee shops either scoop foam into a cup (this closer to a macchiato than a cappuccino) or they put in the two shots, pour in some steamed milk and then scoop foam on top of that (this is a crappy latte, not a cappuccino).\n\nA proper cappuccino has shots on the bottom topped with fresh steamed milk, made for that particular drink, not leftovers. The foam should be rich and thick, not too wet, not too dry. \n\nSo my first time I asked how they made their cappuccino. They said exactly what I wanted to hear. Yay! I began to remark at how happy I was to hear that and that so many shops don't care enough to make cappuccino the right way.\n\nThen they make my drink by pouring pre-steamed milk into my cup and then scooping foam from another pail of milk. My cappuccino is heavy and the foam on top is cold while the rest of the drink is hot. Gross. But not as bad as the customer service was.\n\nThe second and third time I went, my cappuccino was quite perfect but the customer service was the same or worse. No eye contact, no personalization of service. It reminds me of the kind of service you get at a post office during the Christmas rush.\n\nI feel like the baristas there see themselves as superior to their customers. It's not a good experience. I worked at a coffee shop for six years and prided myself in providing happy, friendly and quick service every time, doing my best to match even the most bizarre orders to spec.\n\nI live a block from this Peet's and yet I still find myself walking all the way to the Mission every morning to Four Barrel Coffee where the service is as great as their coffee.", "author": "Justin S."}

Or ever. And it starts with the bad attitude of ONE employee, spread to two others who were basically standing around doing nothing, and comes to the \"Shift Manger\" who refused to make it right which is when I became, well - let's say quite angry. Very Angry.\n\nIn my experience, (and I have gone periodically to this location since they opened about 20 years ago), some of the people who work there, and SOME OF the shift managers, have always, since the store opened, had a bad attitude, not suited for work in customer service. My experience continues with my general observation of the \ncliquish atmosphere of the place, where, if you are not one of the people who goes in there frequently enough for the staff to know by sight, name or beverage preference, and are rather someone who pops in occasionally for a jolt of coffee, in ever so subtle but actually quite obvious ways, you will be made to feel unwelcome. \n\nWhat I will, in a later review, write about this establishment will be considerably longer that this paragraph, but still constrained by brevity. But it will be scathing which is what the experience, from me, the customer's point of view, calls for.\n\nSuffice to also say that I have, for 23 years lived, slept, worked, ate and played in the very neighborhood where this establishment is located, and lived in the same apartment for the entire time. I live, about, I dunno, less than a half mile from where this Peet's location is? A twenty minute walk. \n\nNow, I know that people tend to be more motivated to write bad reviews of places than register their delight if things have gone swimmingly.

People rarely tip, rarely say thank you and hardly ever acknowledge a polite \"good morning, how are you?\" (the most common answer: LARGE LATTE!!!!). As if the disgusting excuse for humans that is the customer base at this location wasn't enough, this is just a bad company to work for. The benefits are completely not affordable (almost 100 bucks a month for the most bare bones excuse for \"medical care\" complete with a 35 dollar co-pay and deductible). The pay is minimum wage with a potential raise of up to 3% one time per year (that doesn't even match the city-mandated annual minimum wage increase). The corporate overlords are completely uncaring and let it be known that each and every employee is dispensable. \n\nTrash talking this sad excuse for a company, and the sad excuse for humans that are the average customers aside, the quality of drinks is just poor. Milk is supplied by Berkeley Farms (factory farmed garbage, think about that next time you pay four dollars for a latte) and all of the sauces are made with high fructose corn syrup. My suggestion: go somewhere else. Spike's and Philz are excellent alternatives and are conveniently around the corner.", "author": "L M."}

But this week, I've been on a tea-drinking kick at Peet's and I am absolutely amazed at the intense flavor of the teas I've tried. I've never had such bold flavor come from teas before. I would buy a canister to take home for myself but it's just such a great experience to come here in person and find a nice spot to curl up with a good book and a pot of tea. Best experience was when I took forever --- I'm very indecisive --- browsing the tea shelves and when I finally went up to the counter, the (cute) barista said, \"So, where did all that thinking get you?\" Attentive, friendly staff.", "author": "Joseph R."}

It is a wonderful alternative to Starbears on 18th, with a great selection of coffees and teas to take home and cool baked goods to go along with a nice tea. Love the benches outside, though I wish there were more seating inside.", "author": "Eric P."}

Peets does better pastries however.  They've got a lot of great coffee/tea gift items.  I'm a big fan of their bagged tea boxes.  The staff here is very friendly.  My mother once broke the lid on an item she was looking at and they didn't make her pay for it.  In fact they gave it to her for free because she was so embarrassed.  I've made sure to tip generously here ever since then. On the downside there is never any seating and the toilet could be cleaner.", "author": "Michael D."}

They are all super friendly, the manager is SO nice and professional, and they can bust through a long line in a matter of minutes.  I don't have a single negative thing to say about this Peet's, or any other I've been to for that matter.  Compared to the taste of Starbucks coffee and the difference in the \"coffee buzz\" I say Peet's has it hands down.  @ The poster who ordered the \"sugar free nonfat extra vanilla supercalafragalisticexpealadocious latte, all I have to say is, I order a small coffee and you people piss me off sometimes lol.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-29", "description": "Sometimes I think it is silly to rate chain places like Peet's, because the company strives to create a relatively similar experience at all locations so that customers know what they are going to get, from who, etc.  But this Peet's is my favorite of the locations that I often visit (also, West Portal and the Berkeley location on Telegraph and Dwight).  The baristas are always so so sweet, especially the tall guy with the red hair and lovely beard (if you are reading this, heyyyy guy!).  Their cappucino is also really good.  This particular Peet's is generally really crowded, which makes it a challenge to score an outlet, but I am usually lucky enough to sit at the counter that faces Market.  I love watching all the doggies and humans taking strolls, socializing and sniffin' butts (the doggies).  I also really love the crowd.  I am usually the only woman in the place, but I feel so safe and cozy among all those totally perfect, beautiful, buff dudes.", "author": "Christie S."}
