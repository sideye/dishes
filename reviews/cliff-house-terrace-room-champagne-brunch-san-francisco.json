We were greeted right away by the hostess and brought to a table with the most incredible view. Clearly the renovation did not disrupt its beauty! So check and check to service and ambiance. \n\nMoving on, the food was as delicious as a I remember. We ordered the spicy calamari, crab cakes, chicken sandwich, cioppino and a few rounds of mimosas. Our server was super nice too, he wouldn't stop offering us mimosas.. wonder why lol. Anywho, my tummy was a happy, happy camper :) \n\nI docked a star because parking isn't the best. I'm sure parking farther on nicer days wouldn't be too bad given how scenic the beach is.. but it's a diff story when you're walking downhill in heels trying not to eat cement.\n\nBut 5 stars for customer service, ambiance and foodz!", "author": "ashley l."}

The sourdough bread taste wonderful soaked into the clam broth. \n\nFor entrees we ordered The Cliff House Cioppino ($34.00) and Frutti De Mare. ($33.50) The Cioppono is a fish stew served in a tomato based broth. It was very garlicky and the crab was plentiful. The Frutti De Mare was the better of the two dishes. It is served with clams, shrimp, scallops, mussels and crab over a serving of linguini with a butter tomato sauce.

Very touristy, more geared towards an older crowd etc. So I wasn't too enthusiastic to come here for the champagne brunch when a friend invited me. I am not a big buffet fan. Just because I want to taste everything and hardly ever manage and then I'm sad :-/ But I must say, this one was a nice experience. (there were not TOO many dishes, which made it easier for me)\n\nFirst off: the service was stellar. A big thanks to our waiter (darn, I forgot his name) who kept our champagne glasses filled at all times and who was funny and witty and just a delight. \nThe ambiance wasn't too shabby either :-) \nWe had a nice view over the water AND the buffet! \nAnd let's not forget the harp player. That was a really nice touch, she was amazing!\n\nOn to the food... it was good. It wasn't \"oh my god I never had better food in my life\" good, but it was good. Especially the desserts were amazing. I had a lot of shrimp and other kinds of seafood, the pastas were great. Can't say much about the breads (there was a good variety), because: NEVER FILL UP ON BREAD AT A BUFFET lol. \nWas it worth the $60 price tag per person? Hm. It probably was.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-26", "description": "The Cliff house has several different restaurant choices.  But by far the Sunday Buffet is the best bang for your buck.  Yes is is $60 per person...but worth every penny.  \nThe seating is crowded and most likely  you will enjoy a chat with those next to you.  The dress is casual.  But the service is TOP NOTCH.   The servers are so attentive and friendly.  \nTo start the champagne never stops flowing.  You may have to stop you server at some point.  If you are not into champagne... sparkling cider, coffee, tea and juice are all you can consume.   \nThe food runs from fresh fruit, salads, salmon, shrimp, eggs, breakfast meats, french toast, pancakes, bagels and loxs , to steak with mushrooms and scolloped potatoes.  Then there are desserts.  You could never get this much food in any other area of the Cliff house for that price.  \nOkay my favorites.... The miso glazed salmon, roasted kale salad, scolloped potatoes,  roast beef and mushroom gravy, shrimp and shrimp.  The eggs Benedict are perfect.  \nFor dessert you must try the Butterscotch pot de creme in a egg shell.  You might need two.   \nAs well the servers keep your plates cleared at all times.  Always a clean plate and a full glass.   \nThis last visit was a \"holiday\" ... fathers day ... and they had a \"carving station\".  Bone in ham or new york steak carved to order.  It did cost extra on that day ($75 per person) ... still so worth it.  My hubby must have made 4 trips to the carved steak.    \nOver all ... you can dress casual and be treated upscale.  Seatings are at 10 am -12 noon- 2 pm.  I would suggest the 12noon.  Arrive at least  20 mins early.  RESERVATIONS are a must.  But I had a reservation for 2, but the night before I wanted to bring along my niece and to be hubby...  when I called they said \"no problem\".  So glad we took them ... it was a blast.  Go Hungry... enjoy everything.   Oh I forgot about the \"Harpist\" playing.  A treat for eyes - ears - tongue.\nIt is a buffet ... but remember to TIP.

Not a huge spread, but everything the 6 at our table tasted was delicious, not a mediocre filler dish to be had.  Well worth the $59/per person.  Favorites included the beef (tender!) with scalloped potatoes, mac & cheese (might have been there for the kiddies, but it was one of our favorites), lox, salmon, paella(!), several pasta dishes (tortellini, orzo, and more), shrimp cocktail, and faro with corn.  We appreciated the availability of vegetable dishes like cauliflower and mushrooms, asparagus, kale salad, shallots and garlic.  Of course, the fruit was plentiful and delicious, and the famous popovers were constantly replenished.  I've enjoyed the eggs benedict upstairs in the Bistro Cafe many, many times and was delighted to find they were delicious off the buffet table as well.  All this, with endless champagne, coffee, and tea made us a very happy group.  As another reviewer said, the emphasis on quality over quantity of dishes was much appreciated.  Many buffets, including the spectacular Sheraton Palace buffet of old had an endless array of dishes, but so many were just not worth consuming.  That was not the case with the Cliff House Brunch.  We enjoyed just about everything we tried.  My only regret is that in my 30 years in SF, I have not experienced this brunch sooner.  That will be rectified since I plan to come back. \n\nAlthough the dining room is not huge, the brunch table never seemed crowded, and we never felt we had to wait to get access to the buffet.  Our large table was a bit close to other large tables, so it was challenging at times to squeeze in or out of our seats.  Our server was very friendly, but I have to say service could have been better.  Having filled champagne glasses was not a problem, but plates were often not cleared, and we had to ask several times before water and coffee were refilled.  The lack of stellar service, however, did not take away from our enjoyment of a very good brunch.  Also, can I just say how easy this brunch is in terms of access by car and availability of parking as long as the driver does not mind walking a bit uphill?  There is a spacious passenger zone in front.  Also, unless you have a large party, reservations are not that difficult to obtain as long as you book a week or so in advance.", "author": "Susan C."}

We went to dinner in the Terrace area (not the champagne brunch but they don't have section on Yelp for just the regular Terrace area) and before we were seated my husband informed the hostess (downstairs in front of the bar) that it was my mother-in-law's 80th birthday and so if perhaps a candle on dessert... and so she said \"Yes, of course...thank you for telling us\". So we thought it would be taken care of and assumed she told the waiter. Long story short...she did not tell the waiter...we sat through other people having happy birthday sung to them. We didn't expect the waiters to sing happy birthday...we would have done that but only a candle on the dessert. When it was time to order dessert we did and we are not dessert people. So...dessert came and no candle...and since we did not want to make a scene in front of my mother-in-law, we said Happy Birthday and finished our dessert. The point of the matter is: if the hostess would have said...\"oh, I am sorry but we need a head's up in these matters\" or \"I am sorry, but we don't do that here\" then we would have said \"Okay then...then let's  eat dinner then one of us, runs to Safeway for a cake and candles to take home.\"  But she gave no indication that they would not or could not do a thing about the birthday or that they needed 24 hour notice or something. Very disappointed and my husband is still upset 3 days later because of course, you only get have one 80th b'day . I, of course, feel bad because going to the Cliff House was my suggestion. So, Cliff House, if you can't do anything for someone's b'day please inform the customer that you can't do anything about it so they could make other plans.

I was told by 3 different staff members, that my service animal could not drink water there because it was \"illegal for service animals to eat or drink while they are working\".  I told them that I was pretty familiar with all the service dog laws and I had never heard of this.  Their reply was that \"it is probably different since it is located within a National Park\".  I was pretty sure that a National Park would abide by the ADA (American Disabilities Act) which is federally mandated.  \n\nSince my service dog is always working, I guess she would have to die of starvation and thirst?  This really makes no sense.  I later checked into this issue with someone who trains service dogs for a living, and I was told that I was given incorrect information.

(Google it and read......it is out of hand!) Our windows were smashed and our belongings stolen.  We were one of four vehicles in a matter of 2 hours that were victimized!  This was at 11 am in the morning on a Monday.  In fact as I was calling into my insurance company, my buddy a Memphis policeman, noticed a suspicious vehicle \"scoping out\" other vehicles to victimized.  He ran and confronted the suspects and they sped off......the entire time a San Francisco cop sat there and did NOTHING......said he wasn't allowed.  Then he told me to submit a police report on line!  The Cliff House told us it wasn't their  problem and that it happens ALL THE TIME.  No security, cops saying they can't protect us against the bad guys, no support, no compassion.........NO MORE CLIFFHOUSE......or San Francisco for that matter.\n\nGood food, great bloody Mary's, awesome views.......but dangerous/unsafe ......

Otherwise would've been only 3 stars, and here's why. \n\nI've been to many Buffet Style Champagne Sunday Brunches, of all kinds, and for the $55 price tag (soon going up to $59), I expect a bit more than what was offered today. \n\nThey had your typical Eggs Benedict (it was okay), some fresh fruit (underripe and pretty much tasteless), the cliche bow tie pasta salad, along with a couple of the other standard cold salad side dishes, but no Salad salad. \n\nThey also had lochs and mini bagels (tasty), some sort of mediocre thinly sliced seared Asian beef dish (ok at best), and some prawns (which were good). Aside from the Eggs Benedict, the only other \"breakfast\" dishes they had were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and fingerling potatoes. There was a decent selection of desserts, the best of which that we tried was the scotch eggs (butterscotch pudding and whipped cream inside of a hollowed out eggs shell). \n\nSo, that was pretty much it. I kind of wish they'd put the same focus and variety of choices in their brunch dishes as they did on dessert. Oh, and there was a harpist! Yes really, a lady was playing a harp, which actually was quite nice! Like I said, the view was absolutely gorgeous! It was a beautiful day today! The service was impeccable, and they certainly were not stingy on the champagne, which is why they got the 4 stars. \n\nThere were some things missing for me, though. Where was the standing rib roast carving station? Where was the omelette station, or maybe even a waffle station? I also would've liked to have seen more options in the entrees and side dishes, like cheese blintzes (that I love and only get to have when I splurge on a Sunday brunch), or maybe steamed mussels, or oysters on the half shell, or ???....\n\nI don't know, maybe I'm expecting too much. Maybe the $55 price tag was for the view. Like I said, the view was spectacular! But, I would've been happy to pay a bit more to get my slice of rib roast, or a tasty little omelette filled with ingredients of my liking.\n\nWill I be back, you ask? Sure! I'll just show up next time expecting to being dazzled by the bottomless glass of champagne and the beautiful views, rather than the variety of food choices. \n\nCheers!", "author": "D N."}

It's even better with butter and jam. Kinda wish there was a side of cream that came with it or coffee sauce....HAHA, now it's just wishful thinking. The popovers are bottomless and I've seen a few tables take some doggy bags home. The menu also mentioned something about selling the ingredients for you to make them at home. \n\nI really, really enjoyed the crab meat omelette (Johnson omelette?). It's pretty rare to find a place that can make a really fluffy and soft omelette like them. I know it seems simple but go out there and try it and you'll know what I mean. I dig the crab meat and avocado combo. I added some hot sauce to it and it was pretty legit. I could see a possible cajun spin to this but I don't think it'd fit with the restaurant's style...if anyone knows any other places for crab meat omelettes....let me know! HAHA. I would definitely come back just for this omelette, I'd like to try the shrimp and scallop omelette next time. \n\nThe clam chowder was eh. The ingredients were definitely good and legit (clam and shrimp pieces) but it was overall just too thick for me. It wasn't overly salted like some other places though so I did appreciate that.

At both places, the draw is the amazing view.  Unfortunately, we were not seated at a table near a window, so that kinda took a way some of the fun for me.\n\nThe buffet is a little small and the desserts are forgettable - except for the butterscotch egg.  The fresh strawberries were surprisingly sweet.  \n\nFor my first round, I focused on breakfast.  The scrambled eggs were good.  I found the bacon a little too undercooked - I like mine crispier with most of the fat rendered out.  The french toast wasn't drenched in batter so it wasn't too soggy served with your typical fresh cut fruits like honeydew and grapefruit.\n\nThe lunch side included popovers or Yorkshire pudding and these were a highlight with  a great crust on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I ate these with the assorted cheeses offered.  I didn't really like the cold pastas offered, but the Asian beef salad was good.  Gooey Mac n' cheese stuck to my bones.  \n\nLike other reviews have mentioned, there's no carving station, and for the price, should have been expected. \n\nParking can be a bit of a challenge, but after gorging myself it was nice to be able to take a nice walk along the shore.

I originally wanted to go to Foreign Cinema but since that was a no-go, she took me to the Cliff House Terrace Room for brunch. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised (or maybe that was the bottomless champagne talking? ;)). \n\nWe had 12 p.m. reservations with window-seating and though we arrived on time, we didn't have a table with beautiful ocean views (-1 STAR). This ended up not being a problem because we were seated pretty close to all the food (don't judge me) AND there was bottomless champagne ;) who needs an ocean view when you have bottomless champagne? \n\nThere was quite a variety of dishes, both for breakfast and lunch, while we were there and everything tasted amazing. Their brunch is served buffet style so you are able to try a little bit of everything. For my first round, I decided to try all the breakfast dishes. We both tried:\n-the eggs benedict\n-scrambled eggs\n-french toast with cinnamon apple jam\n-bacon\n-sausage\n-fresh fruit\n\nI have to say that the scrambled eggs and french toast stood out. The eggs were fluffy and very fresh and the french toast was so delicious. I easily could have gone back for more of the french toast but I decided to try out their lunch dishes for my second round. \n\nFor the second round, we tried:\n-potatoes au gratin\n-shrimp salad\n-fresh shrimp\n-corn salad\n-tri-tip\n\nMy favorites were the shrimp salad and the tri-tip. While all the dishes were tasty, I have to say that breakfast was my favorite!\n\nEven though I was full, I decided to stuff my face some more with dessert. I tried some of their fresh oatmeal raisin cookies and chocolate covered strawberries which were amazing. The cookies reminded me of homemade cookies - definitely weren't store bought. \n\nThe service was great! Though we didn't get our original table, we ended up having such an amazing brunch and the staff was very attentive. We never worried about our water, coffee, and champagne refills. I also loved that there was a harpist - a really nice touch!

The service was good, but the food was fairly average and overpriced, as others have mentioned.

My husband had a similar comment about the men's room.  \n\nAfter dinner, we returned to our car (parked about a 1/2 block away from the entrance) to find a window was smashed and several of our belongings stolen.  Our rental car (SUV) had out-of-state plates -- the police told us that was a magnet for thieves.  Out of curiosity, we drove back to the area the following evening, and noticed the same thing happened to another SUV with out-of-state plates, parked in nearly the same spot.

Popovers are like their house bread, but to compare these delicious puffs to \"bread\" would almost be sacrilegious. As I pulled each one apart, smeared it with butter and jam, I let out a sigh of contentment. They are SO good. It was a sign of even better food to come.\n\nI opted for the Johnson omelette which had huge chunks of dungenous crab, cheese, green onions and avocado with a side of fruit and house potatoes. Simply amazing. \n\nOur server poked fun at us for staging so many iPhone shots of our food with the ocean in the background - but it was just sooo pretty, we had to capture it. \n\nI look forward to coming back and spoiling myself soon :)", "author": "Mariela D."}

Let me start out by saying that I had no complaints about the service, and the food was restocked regularly. However, when paying $50 per person for breakfast, I'll admit that I expect some level of creativity or absolutely delicious, refined food. \n\nINSTEAD, we got the Cliffhouse. It was like breakfast at a trough, champagne included. Tables packed into a long room right next to the buffet so that you could see everyone going back for thirds and then gorging themselves. Aside from the fruit plate, pretty much everything was coated in cheese, mayonnaise, or butter (although there was an occasional hollandaise sauce thrown in). There was nothing here that made this more than a $29.99 buffet, unless their pay scale is based on how many calories they feed you. \n\nI will also remember indefinitely the girl at the table next to me who was able to Hoover an entire eggs Benedict into her mouth in one bite. If not for this feat of grandeur, brunch would have been a total and utter loss.  Girl in the silver shirt- if you ever happen to read this, BRAVA.

Everyone was very attentive - the bartender, Kevin, was so friendly and made sure that everyone had a fresh drink/refill.  My mom told me that she needed to get things from one of the locked offices (where things like purses were kept) a few times that evening, and that Lauraine and Nicole were quick to help her with that, never rolling their eyes or telling her to wait.  The staff even made sure to save a plate of appetizers for me and the groom, since we were having pictures taken during happy hour - such a nice, thoughtful touch!\n\nCould not have asked for a better wedding/reception, and the work that the folks at Cliff House put into the event did not go unnoticed or unappreciated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-05", "description": "After doing a bit of research for Sunday champagne brunch buffets - I settled on the Cliff House.  Reasons:  the price was mid range ($45/head), it was supposed to have a beautiful view, unlimited champagne, and the food had reasonable reviews.  I called in to make a reservation (they say it's recommended) and I didn't want to get stuck waiting for a table.  \n\nIt's located in the Ocean Beach area - on a nice day, parking can be a bit tricky as Cliff House is right next to the beach.  However, we found a lot (10 minute walk to Cliff House) across from the beach that had a number of spots, and by the time we were leaving, all the spots were taken.  \n\nUpon entering, it's a little confusing as Cliff House is home to several restaurants - the Sunday brunch buffet is located downstairs.  The place is nice and bright with a clean mid-scale/classy feeling.  Large windows allow you to enjoy the outside view of the water.  I requested a window table and was lucky that there was one open.  \n\nThe food is in the center of the room - the variety wasn't huge, but not bad.  Partial food selection:  Smoked salmon, miso glazed salmon (I hate fish, but people seem to rave about it), eggs benedict, scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, something that resembled jambalaya rice, shrimp salad, cocktail shrimp, few kinds of cold pasta, asparagus, cheese/crackers, tri tip, french toast, and cut fruit.  Dessert included:  Chocolate covered strawberries, cookies, mini eclairs, mousse, tarts, pecan pie, and chocolate dipped macaroons.  Overall, the food was OK, but definitely not impressive.    For $45, I'd expect a bit more, but it wasn't to the point where I would complain.\n\nPros:\n-Nice views and a classy venue\n-Unlimited champagne/coffee\n-The Lands End Trail is nearby....it definitely helped to take a walk to burn off the food.  Having brunch and then taking a nature walk is a great way to spend a morning/afternoon.\n-Reasonable food variety\n-Yep, they do have someone playing the harp\n\nCons:\n-Buffet area can get crowded at times\n-Some of their tables are too close together.  Our table was situated less than 5 inches away from the next table.  \n-Our champagne glasses ran dry for 20+ minutes at times.  I can't say that they did a good job of keeping our glasses filled.  I was a little peeved at this - for $45, it better keep flowing.  Plus yours truly likes to drink!!\n-Food quality was OK, the grade could have been a bit better for the price paid.  I would also include fancier dishes - I can always get sausage and bacon from Denny's.\n-Caliber of the service wasn't quite there.  It wasn't terrible, but for $55 a person (after tax/tip), I expect service a notch above Applebee's.  \n\nOverall, Cliff House was OK.  There aren't a whole lot of Sunday brunch buffets (w/ unlimited champagne) to choose from, so I might come here again the next time.", "author": "Laura C."}

Sure, this is Sunday brunch buffet, so maybe quality might slide a little to make way for quantity.  But then there isn't too much to choose from either... I'm certainly not coming back on my own volition; money better spent elsewhere. \n\nOf the available food options, I only found the eggs benedict, miso salmon and paella to be worth having seconds.  Cranberry scone was not bad either, but nobody in their right mind would fill up on scones at a buffet.  The smoked salmon did not taste fresh or properly stored since it was a little mushy and some edges were drying up.  What a disappointment since I wanted to binge on that.  I don't recall seeing any other seafood besides shrimp cocktail.  Salads were pretty interesting and not your normal iceberg lettuce.  Normal array of fruits, can't really mess that up.  The dessert spread was quite disappointing both in taste and selection.  \n\nWhat unlimited champagne?  My table only got refilled once.  Admittedly, I was basically the only one downing it at my table, but the waiters seemed to come by and refill all adjacent tables and skip me.  I can only take comfort in guessing that I look too young.  Coffee refills were frequent to the point of annoying though.  \n\nNot much ocean view unless you're sitting next to a window on the south side.

Great idea, right?  Wrong.   The \"champagne\" they serve is called Wycliff.  Look it up online.  It's $4.99 per bottle.  I am not above cheap champagne, but this stuff tasted horrible.  I couldn't even finish one glass.  And I NEVER don't finish my champagne.  EVER.  I wasn't expecting Dom Perignon, but if I wanted to drink the equivalent of Cook's, I'd go to some $15 bottomless mimosa place in the Marina with a DJ and  a bunch of 22 year olds still drunk from the night before.\n\nFood is average, standard brunch fare.  If you're cool with paying $45 for scrambled eggs and fruit salad, this is your type of place.  But stick to the sparkling cider they have for kids. Otherwise, there are a million other delicious brunch places in the city.\n\nAnd tourists - don't even come here for the view.  It is gorgeous if you happen to be here on one of the 3 days out of the year that the sun actually comes out at Ocean Beach, but the odds are not in your favor.\n\nThe extra star is for the harpist.", "author": "Nicole G."}

It was a very non-germy atmosphere for a buffet and that's just how I like it. I also didn't see many kids around so, it made it that much more sterile and pristine :).\n\nI loved that they had all you could eat Eggs Benedict (I replaced the poached egg with scrambled due to egg yolk ooze & salmonella freakoutedness). I only had 2.. but in hindsight, wish I had grabbed one more.. I want one so bad right now. Damn they were perfect!\n\nI also loved the huge dish of roasted onions and garlic. I can put that stuff on just about anything and it kicks up the tastegasm levels to the 9th power.\n\nThe waitresses were on point with the champagne refills.. left no glass empty on our table. Being the beverage whore that I am, this was greatly appreciated.\n\nI kinda didn't like the way the tables were set up. I almost wish they'd have a designer come in and do a make-over on the whole set up. I hate sitting right next to strangers in restaurants.. but the rows of tables left no other option. So, my friend and I engaged in our normal chit chat and I believe we made one couple leave earlier than they planned with the topics we were discussing. \nHey, if you're going to be nosey and listen to us, we're gonna give your ass an earful!\nThe table set up made it impossible to enjoy the view outside the window, unless you sat at a window seat, of which most were set with a 4-seater table and that sucks for peeps with just 2 folks in their party.\n\nAll in all, it was a deliciously good time. I'll definitely come again and maybe with more folks so we can take advantage of the window seats with the phenomenal view.\n\nI was a little thrown off by the gay mannequin in the lobby (see pic)..but, it kinda made the place seem more down to earth and definitely pro-SF culture :)", "author": "T C."}

Having lived in SF Bay Area for a few years, we've passed this place on our way to Ocean Beach and wondered how scrumptious a fancy restaurant with a KILLER view would only taste like... and my, oh my, was our prediction accurate. \n\nThe Champagne Brunch is usually held weekly on Sundays, with reservations HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The space is relatively small, with a dining area of about less than 1200 sq feet (fits less than 80 people comfortably). I always envisioned that the entire Cliffhouse building was occupied by one restaurant. But unbeknownst to me, it was divided by 2 restaurants: the casual dining Bistro Restaurant and the more formal Sutro's. Although the Terrace Room isn't technically considered a restaurant (coz it only holds the champagne Sunday Brunch), it was located underneath the main floor, downstairs from the entrance. Sutro's had the more enviable view with the dramatic ocean scenery of waves crashing against the rocky coast, but the Terrace Room's expansive view over the horizon of the Pacific Ocean was like looking at a California postcard.\n\nThe Christmas Day Champagne Brunch had an additional treat: lamb roast ($65/person for holidays (because of the lamb) and $45/person for regular Sunday brunch). Aside from that, it serves a buffet of endless smoked salmon, eggs benedict, french toast, pasta carbonara. The desserts were equally as impressive: chocolate-covered strawberries, Pot de Creme (butterscotch-flavored pudding inside an eggshell), and standard NY cheesecake.\n\nWaiters come around tending to patrons by filling drinks, including coffee and champagne. I was surprised that OJ was a premium and that it was an additional charge, however. Nonetheless, As the champagne flowed, so did the trips back and forth to the buffet line. Considering the size of the room, I was happy to see that the average wait time in the line was only a few moments before you can make your selections. Adjacent to the buffet tables was a harpist who would play a few pieces that range from classical to oldies (I remembered \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\"). Definitely added to the elegance to the restaurant.\n\nTwo hours had passed and after consuming nearly three plates each of an assortment of breakfast, lunch and dessert-foods, we decided that it was time to leave. The buffet only runs Sundays from 10am - 330pm. At around 3pm, the crowd thins out and the food is slowly being put away by the staff, but they never make you feel like you are being rushed away. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and after paying $190 (incl tip and tax) for three adults and one child, I was overall satisfied. Top-notch food, warm and inviting ambiance, and spectacular views are reason why I will continue to return to the Terrace Room.\n\nTIP: Remember to make reservations! Also, parking is a chore if you arrive for lunch. People usually park on the side of the road in front of the restaurant, otherwise find parking next to the lot where the Sutro Baths once stood.", "author": "Carloalexi M."}

It was after a very successful birthday celebration night (the world was very fuzzy, Advil hadn't kicked in yet, and the need for greasy food was high) and I was looking forward to the buffet style brunch (be sure to make reservations ahead of time). There are many reasons to come here, great view, beautiful dining room, nice location, but seriously, if you've read my brunch reviews, you know there's one major decider for me: UNLIMITED MIMOSA BRUNCH!!! What better way to nurse a hang-over, then to get drunk again! We had our DD, and our appetite, and we got to it. The buffet has a great assortment of cold and hot dishes. The thin sliced ham was perfectly salty and juicy and the french toast was brought out fresh and hot!\n\nMost importantly is that they kept your table clean of used dishes and NEVER stopped filling my glass. I think I had to wave down our waitress once for a refill and that's only because I chugged my glass after eating something spicy!\n\nIt's a bit pricey for brunch, but the mix of decent and ample food, great costumer service, and yes, booze!

I tried futilely to tell the reservation person that I was making the request because it's my father's 80th Birthday and that he loves ocean views.  Each time, she would interrupt and talk over me.

I just thought it was rude, and if this is how the restaurant deals with people making a reservation for the brunch, how were we going to be treated when we got there?\n\nI decided to go check out the Cliff House to see if the views were worth the trouble.  Turns out, the views at the brunch location isn't that great.  Much better at the Cliff House Bistro or Restaurant.  I wound up opting to go to the Cliff House Bistro instead which had its own set of issues.  See my review of the Bistro for details.\n\nLong story short, if you're paying $50 a head for a brunch, you'd expect to be treated better during the reservation process.

The paella, while very tasty, did not have any mussels in it... only clams. You also won't find any crab, lobster, or rock oysters amongst the items.

My sister started suggesting that we take mom and dad somewhere special and I agree.  They aren't the type that let us make a party for them for even their fiftieth party, so we decided to make the sixtieth something special with a \"surprise\" brunch.\n\nI did due diligence in my job of picking the venue.  I looked at a venue in Capitola (didn't start serving until 5pm), at one in Yosemite (too far, transportation issues), cruise dining (a bit pricey), San Jose (ala carte, my folks would try to go cheap and just order soup, I know them), the revolving restaurant in SF (closed for two years) and about ten other places.  I gathered up my research (I was probably avoiding the research paper for my assessment class) and took it to my sister.  She looked at all the posit notes and the rubric and maybe was a little overwhelmed.  She said, \"You decide!\"  I picked the Cliff House and Bob made the reservations.\n\nWe reserved for twelve, and would you believe it, EVERYONE showed up!  My sister and nieces took mom and dad to a \"museum day\" and then said that they had made reservations at the Cliff House.  My mom fussed that it might be a little expensive, but went along with it.  She was rather confused when they seated her at a table for TWELVE!  Yep, everyone showed up, little by little.  Champagne was poured and coffee was served.  She grew more excited by the minute.  Of course, both my mom and my dad were very pleased to see every one of the children and grandchildren.  My niece made jordan almond keepsake boxes with ribbon and an engagement ring and diamond centered daisies.\n\nThe Cliff House staff were very friendly.  The food was very, very nice, especially their lox (high grade), miso encrusted salmon, sliced fruit, sesame marinated asparagus.  There were excellent scrambled eggs, sausages, scalloped potatoes, homemade mac and cheese, paella, tortellini, more pasta dishes, an onion/garlic fry, and roast beef slices.  Then there were the deserts. OMG!!!  Their chocolate mousse was dark chocolate with a strawberry garnish.... very nice!  There were chocolate dipped strawberries, mixed pastries, a peach melba tart, pecan pie, a huge bowl of strawberries, french toast with apple topping.  I 'm sure I've left something out, but it was a special spread, with very fresh and high-grade ingredients.  I didn't have any champagne, but the coffee was excellent.\n\nWhen we first arrived, there was a lovely harpist.  Then, of course, there was the fantastic view.  There simply isn't a bad table in the room.  The room is decorated in a calming combination of butter yellow and cream in a very orderly Edwardian manner.  The effect is one of warmth and calm.  The dramatic view of the ocean is the icing on this decoration.\n\nWe were treated very well by the Cliff House staff.  They were attentive and professional.  Reviewing the bill, we noted that 18% was added to our bill automatically (because we were a large party?).  We didn't have any argument to that.\n\nAll in all, it was a very refined and lovely event.  We are very grateful for The Cliff House and it's champagne brunch.

It's good but nothing wow.\n\nI agree that this brunch may be no match against some brunch in Vegas at the same price, but it is in San Francisco. It's not very fair to compare, anyway.", "author": "Christy C."}

He kept the included champagne and coffee flowing fairly well, plus got drinks (milk, hot chocolate) for the kids. The food is good and plentiful. It's not gourmet. You'll find things like pasta/grain salads (I particularly liked the corn bulgar one), lox, bagels, pastries, eggs beni, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, salmon, steak salad, cheeses, french toast, shrimp, asparagus, eggplant, cauliflower, scalloped potatoes, etc. Plus copious amounts of desserts -- chocolate torte, cheesecake, mousse, chocolate dipped strawberries, a butterscotch pudding, fruit tart, cookies, cream puffs and much more. \n\nIt's a good spot for groups. I think if I were going on a romantic date...I'd eat in the restaurant so as not to be 2 inches from my neighbor's table. Adults are $45 for the champagne brunch, kids are half that. If you do have kids in your party they might want to check out the giant camera obscura behind the restaurant afterward.", "author": "Linda M."}

We had a party of 9 and attended the Champagne Brunch on 12/26.  Getting to find the actual brunch itself led us to a two-flight staircase which brought us down to a bar and the champagne brunch. Before approaching the actual brunch we decided to grab a couple of drinks. The beverage service was not too great because they only had one bartender at 1:00pm on a Sunday?? Our group waited 35 plus minutes for cocktails which was kind of annoying. Very big disappointment....\n\nAt 1:30 we proceeded to a large banquet room which consisted of multiple round and long shaped tables. In the center of the brunch was where the food was located, and to be honest it was kind of awkward because right next to the food were other peoples tables and most people in our group felt that we might have been getting in the way. The table behind us had about 20 people and they were very quiet. I noticed from the minute we got there that it was very quiet and there was no music being played which made the whole dining experience kind of awkward since my family is pretty loud. I felt like I was dining in an old cafeteria...\n\nMoving on to the food selection and quality. I have to admit I was somewhat impressed in most dishes however the pasta that was served cold was not very good at all. I stuck with the french toast and sausages as well as a croissant. I found the quality of the food to be actually pretty good, however I noticed the temperature of the food being served as not as hot as most would expect it. Overall the food was good to very good.\n\nThe champagne that they service is their own, private label which wasn't the greatest. We instead opted on the Dom Perignon champagne from the Bar which ran $60 a bottle but it was a lot better than what was being served to us.\n\nTotal cost ended up being around $600 for 9 people. I probably will come back but not for the buffet, maybe the restaurant for sure.\n\n P.S. The website indicates that they have valet parking, however that is incorrect. We had to park a half a mile away. Maybe they should update their website?", "author": "Joe K."}

Perhaps it's not worth the expense of entry, but the real value is the location and the exploration of the Cliff House's decks after gorging yourself on the buffet.\n\nIf you've eaten a bit too much, there's a beach that begs for an afternoon stroll right down the hill.", "author": "Eric L."}

That's completely ridiculous, so I told the nice girl I didn't want to do that and she put me on hold to check with her manager.  When she came back she told me they don't really enforce that, but I was unwilling to make the reservation since I had only her verbal assurance and who knows if they would change their mind.  If I go at all I'll take my chances and go as a walk-in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-24", "description": "Five stars for a high-end SF champagne buffet brunch experience with great ambiance, superb views of Ocean Beach, friendly staff, delicious and creative culinary treats and endless bubbly.  \n\nThis is definitely a pricey brunch-- I'd say you'd come out spending at least $90 for two during the champagne buffet brunch.  Here are some quick tips:\n\n1)  Pop-Overs:  DELICIOUS.  The Cliff House is famous for its deliciously dangerous popovers, which are oh-so-soft on the inside and melt in your mouth.  I can seriously eat a dozen popovers.  Be careful though-- you have to eat them ASAP when they're piping hot or else you'll lose the warm, pillowy softness and crisp outside.  If they've been sitting out for too long on the buffet table, they'll taste MEH, so get them when they come out or else you'll probably be more disappointed than impressed.\n\n2)  Upscale champagne brunch-- you'll see lots of people having bridal / baby showers, birthdays, celebrating anniversaries, etc.  Basically, this is the backdrop for a nice luncheon for couples, families (not really for children though), vacationers and those who can afford it.  If you're like me (e.g., young working professional), you'd probably dine here once in a while (e.g., anniversary or birthday).  \n\n3)  The food is really good.  I mean.. for a typical brunch buffet, you'd expect to see items like scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, macaroni salad  or coleslaw, salad bar, lots of desserts, rice, sides of meat, etc.  You'll get that here but with a culinary twist because it will be more delicate, fancy and upscale.  You'll get a salad, but it'll have seared tuna with intricate little vegetables and exotic touches.  Everything has a little twist to it that makes it really good and creative.  This is definitely NOT like a Hometown Buffet / Souplantation-type of restaurant.  You'll get a great sampling of rich food while also satisfying your love for buffets.\n\n4)  The view is fantastic, so come on a sunny or clear day.  It's also great because there's tons to do and see around Ocean Beach.  You can walk to the old bathhouse, which is a landmark, and you can grab your bikes or walking shoes to tour around Ocean Beach.  You can make an afternoon of it:  brunch at the Cliff House, tour the bathhouse, walk/bike around Ocean Beach and enjoy the sites and sounds.  It gets windy, so bring a jacket!\n\n5)  The executive chef walks around to see how people are enjoying the food.  Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with the chef(s).   They're super nice!\n\n6)  Harpist:  Gotta have music during your champagne brunch. :)  You'll hear Broadway melodies and classical music-- great!\n\n7)  Unlimited champagne.

The brunch was a complete and utter disappointment.  When you read the other reviews and they say that they tables are 2\" apart it is not hyperbole, literally, the tables for 2 are set 2\" apart.  Not possible to have a private conversation, the wait staff is literally leaning over your shoulders repeatedly to clear plates or fill glasses.  Totally cramped and claustrophobic.  Nice view but you can't enjoy it unless you happen to be the first table against the window.\n\nNow the food.  Very small selection.  More desert selection than entree or veg.  \n\nOnly one lettuce salad.  The salad was baby lettuce and what I assume were heirloom tomatoes but very overdressed with a nice balsamic dressing.  There was a nice shrimp salad and two pasta salads but no salad bar other lettuce salad option.  No fresh veg.  Nice melon and fruit selection with a brie and one other cheese but still no real selection.\n\nEntree, good eggs Benedict; scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage but how to you miss on these standards.\n\nMac and Cheese - excellent.  Marinated beef that was ho hum...\n\nDeserts, a nice variety but still nothing that you couldn't get elsewhere.\n\nBottom line for me, not worth the money at all.  Mediocre food, terrible ambiance, not enough selection.  If you want to go to the Cliff House for the experience I would recommend one of their other dining rooms.

You may be parking your car away and walk uphill but it is nice walk if it is a sunny day. \n\nFood is not spectacular but decent. Yes, I had better, maybe 50 other places or so. It is not that expensive so I did not have high expectations on food selection or quality. But, there wasn't even a custom omelette station.\n\nWeb page makes you believe that this buffet brunch has nice ocean view. But, you can't see much even if you are at a window table. Web page shows a dramatic ocdean view. I wonder if it is targeted 1-time tourists? The other two restaurants do have better view not brunch.\n\nThey did not give a better table to us even though it was available.\n\nWe are 3 people at 4-person table. It was funny arrangement. One side of the table is pushed against a curtain on the wall. So, I pushed the unused chair a litle away from myself so that I do not eat the curtain instead of my food :-) The chair was not outside the outline of the table, it was 10 inches away from me. One of staff passing by comes and psuhes the chair towards to me. A few seconds later I push it back to same position. Another staff comes then another. I had to tell the third staff pushing the chair towards me to take the chair away.", "author": "K K."}

Every waiter and wait staff was attentive and polite and professional.\n\nOverall, the food is OK, but could quickly and easily be improved (for instance, they could remove the salt and pepper shakers from the table and offer fresh cracked pepper and salt grinders).  While the potatoes were OK, they could have been greatly improved if they would have been turned into tasty home fried style potatoes.

We were very happy with the food, even at the expensive price ($45 pp).   Because we had checked Yelp before we knew not to expect really fancy food (e.g. lobster, crab legs, sushi) and I also knew there were no carving stations, which does seem kind of surprising but is not that big a deal to me.   We were impressed at the selection of food and also at how well it was prepared.  I have been to similarly expensive brunches with really mediocre food and we were pleased that the food here was very tasty.  The selection looks small at first, since it is just one single table area, but when you realize there is no repetition (i.e. both sides of the table have different food), you realize there is actually quite a variety.   \n\nSome of the highlights on the buffet were:\n-6 or so interesting looking pasta/fruit salads (but no \"traditional\" salad)\n-popovers that were good but not the best I've had (try to get them when they bring out a fresh batch, cold popovers are no good)\n-breakfast selections including: french toast, bacon, sausage, GREAT scrambled eggs (not overcooked like normal on a buffet)\n-excellent au gratin potatoes (I had 3 helpings!)\n-miso-glazed salmon\n-a tortellini dish with ham that my bf really liked\n-spicy mac and cheese (was too spicy for me)\n-excellent steak\n-FANTASTIC dessert spread (especially if you like chocolate): great chocolate chip cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, flourless chocolate cake, chocolate & vanilla swirl cheesecake and amazing dark chocolate mousse.  for non-chocoholics, there was a pecan tart, a few mini-fruit tarts, and an assortment of non-chocolate cookies.  There were also mini-blueberry muffins and croissants & rolls.\n\n\nThe view was lovely as well (although we were not able to get a coveted table by the window) and we had a nice time afterwards walking around Point Lobos and Ocean Beach and taking pictures.  There was also live harp music, which was very nice.   It was definitely a fun experience to do once while we live in the bay area and we were impressed by the quality of the food.  I don't know that we would come back, because it is expensive and we like to try new things, but I definitely recommend doing it once!\n\nA few things that would significantly improve this brunch in my opinion:\n--don't charge people for non-alcoholic drinks.  when you're paying $50 for all you can eat and all you can drink champagne it just seems absurd to not have a 50 cent hot chocolate included.   that kind of nickel-and-diming just detracts from the experience they are going for.\n--move apart the tables.  we were sitting so close to the table for 2 next to us that it was basically a table for 4.  it was awkward and we felt like we couldn't really talk to each other freely without them hearing us.  i think they felt the same way since they barely spoke at all.  it was also annoying whenever we had to get up from our table and climb across them, which was often, since it was a buffet.\n--let tables of 2 sit by the window.  others have commented on this as well, but the tables by the windows are all for 4+, which is lame.\n--bring out baskets of hot popovers to each table instead of having them on the buffet: nobody likes cold popovers!", "author": "A M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-01-01", "description": "This is a review of Masoud, the banquet coordinator at the Cliff House.  If you book the Terrace Room for a wedding, he will be your day-of coordinator.  He's rude, he's inflexible, and the answer is \"no\" to most whatever you want. \n\n1)  We arrived on time for our 1pm appointment on December 31st.  Masoud kept us waiting 15 minutes and arrived smelling of cigarette smoke.  I can only think that he was finishing a smoke, despite our appointment.  We were on a very tight schedule, with appointments stacked, and the next one downtown, so this was not only rude, but unprofessional, and raised an interesting question:  Would he hold up the wedding sneaking off for cigarettes?!  He certainly kept us waiting long enough.  \n\n2)  Having read other review of the Terrace Room, I asked up front what the food and beverage minimum was.  He told me it was $8k for the evening, and $7k for the day.  Ok, the only date they had left was the last weekend in October, and I know the sun sets at 6:14pm (that is, disappears entirely).  Since the ceremony has to be on the terrace (included with the Terrace Room), I asked if we could start at 5:30pm instead, and the response was absolutely not, NO EXCEPTIONS.  Ok.  I asked him what we were supposed to do with the terrace after dark, and he said that it was our \"problem\", repeatedly.  Er, ok.  Their website states that you have to be off the terrace after dark, so that cuts your venue space in half, and removes the ceremony space altogether if the sun sets completely by 6:15pm!  After about 5 minutes of negativity, he said that we could rent lights, but the Cliff House would not help us with that.  \n\n3)  Ok, so to start the ceremony earlier Masoud suggests that we book both the day and evening slots for the low low price of ... $14k, which I think is reasonable, if we can get $14k of stuff.  I looked at the sample menus (tops out at $75pp + alcohol) and asked how he could get us to $14k for 80 people (~ $175 pp).  I'm willing to pay the money, but I want something *for* my money.  I suggested a chocolate fountain.  He said no, not even if you bring it in from outside yourself.  Errr...ok.  I asked if there was an open bar option (like $50pp), and he said no, you must pay the tab (and the tab will not be broken down, they're just going to give you a number).  Errr....ok, that screams of space for padding for me (see \"last thought\" below).  \n\n4)  I asked him what restrictions were on the space, since there seemed to be a lot of things that we could not do.  For planning, you see, that is good to know up front.  He said that there the Cliff House was a federal building and there were \"thousands of things that you cannot do\" and he wouldn't tell us what they were.  That was totally unacceptable to me -- particularly since I work in a federal building.  \n\nHe suggested that we would have to pay $14k for the privilege of using the Terrace Room, irrespective of whether we met the food or beverage minimum.  At that point, we left.  He was a total waste of time, had a giant chip on his shoulder, and wasn't that bright (massive understatement).  I would have serious problems if he were my day-of coordinator.  \n\nLast thought:  In general, I would want a contract that spelled out every contingency and offered a flat rate for the goods and services provided.  The variability in the alcohol cost (it depends on how much your guests drink, and the drinks are cheap) and the relatively cheap food menus means that the minimum is a stretch for smaller groups.\n\nI'm looking for a contract with no surprises.  If I have to pay more up front, I'm ok with that, but I don't want my wedding night to be ruined by getting a bill that is much higher than expected, or getting a bill that is padded with \"rent\" to make the room minimum.  \n\nHaving said that, the Cliff House Terrace Room is nice, has a fabulous view, and could be good for September when the daylight lasts longer (summertime is too foggy because Land's End = fog head).  Also, you can probably do 100 people for $10k, even including the variable alcohol costs, so if you're looking for a less expensive venue for a local (no out of town guests who need hotels and transportation to the hotels downtown) wedding, this would fit the bill.  (But you wouldn't know exactly how much the bill was until the end of the night...)", "author": "Olivia L."}

Despite this, I have chosen to go to the pricey Cliff House Terrace Room for its champagne brunch TWICE during the past year.\n\nMost love to impress the out-of-town guests with the spectacular view, but the first time I was there turned out to be one of the foggiest days ever, then the second time I was there turned out to be so sunny that my party decided it best to have the staff let the curtains down to keep us from scorching our retinas.\n\nMy fellow lushes appreciate the fact that they can drink themselves blind whilst still feeling somewhat cultured since there is a harpist playing soothing music in the background.

Where else can you get bacon as well as smoked shrimp with wasabi tobiko and  roasted truffled cauliflower?  Hmm?\n\nMy very favorite part of the Cliff House Terrace Room champagne brunch has got to be  the design of the recently remodeled structure.  I think it is very evident that  much thought went into the new layout.  The Cliff House is one of the most visited landmarks in San Francisco.  There is a large and beautiful restaurant downstairs in addition to the Terrace Room.   There is a large bar upstairs as well as another restaurant.  The place is always teeming with people straight off the 38 Geary or coming from Ocean Beach and plenty of diners from the various restaurants serving plenty of delicious beverages and meals.  \n\nThat's why it's absolutely marvelous that the entire place has five (?  one unisex downstairs and male/female johns upstairs with two stalls each, I believe) toilets.   Clearly, someone had his head up his ass when doing the remodel ...\n\nHINT:  If you're planning to dine at/visit the Cliff House, don't forget to get catheterized first (or wear an astronaut's diaper) or you'll be sorry!!!", "author": "Jenny K."}

You are given a choice of champagne or sparking cider as a non-alcoholic option.\n\nImmediately we jumped to the brunch table in the center of the room.   There was a great spread of breakfast items and lunch items, and some of my favorites were a cheese tortellini, smoked salmon, and au gratin potatoes.  For dessert, I enjoyed the vanilla bean creme puff and a slice of cheesecake.  But there is many more items to enjoy as listed on their website.\n\nWhile enjoying our meals, there was a harp player who played beautifully.

Yes the view is wonderful, but as a native I could care less. Definitley a place to bring out of towners. I felt like we were eating at the country club.

There was a group there when we arrived who were finished eating, but stayed 1 1/2 extra hours to chat and catch up. I could understand they would want their money's worth, but then again move your butts so the rest could get a chance to eat. Seating arrangement can definately be tight if you're along the walls. I sat in the middle so I'm glad not to feel any butt cheeks on the back of my neck from someone trying to get by.\n\nWhile most of the food was rather bland, I did enjoy the salmon! But the bacon (undercooked), sausage (bland), steak (bland), eggs benedict (semi bland), sweet potatoes (gross), scalloped potatoes (ehh bland). Some of the deserts were yummy.

Sadly, the experience started off with a receptionist, Sarah von Snooty-Snoot, telling us that despite our reservation, we would still have to put our names on \"the list\" and wait at least 10 minutes. The 10 minutes became 20, children were starting to fuss, blood sugar was running low, and by the time we got our table, the poached eggs on the chafing dish could have been used for a game of golf. \n\nAlas, service inside didn't improve very much.... maybe it was the fact that we were the last seating of the day, but the staff barely cleared our table (resulting in dirty plates stacked haphazardly on our dining area). Our table was placed by the side of a wall with barely enough space to squeeze in and out of our seats. One interesting side note was the Russian family next to us who was berated by the manager for bringing their own vodka (smuggled in plastic water bottles... genius!) . The Russian response? \"next time, make sure your servers pour us water and then we won't have to bring our own drinks.\" Prost, Comrades!\n\nFor the price of brunch, I was definitely expecting much more than what I got.

Two stars for the view, if you're into this sort of thing.\n\nNot in the mood to get potted early on a Sunday, so opted out of the champagne and asked for coffee instead.  Obviously, coffee is a rare commodity here, as it took a bit of waiting for it to arrive, whereas the other guests were quickly served champagne.\n\nWent to the serving area, as was immedately greeted with an array of salads, breads and pastries, all designed to fill you up early.  Being an old buffet pro, I knew to hold off and cruise the other offerings.\n\nTried the shrimp salad, roast beef, a pasta offering and what appears from reading other reviews, their vaunted Eggs Benedict.  Returned to our table with a full plate, and noticed that my coffee cup, previously drained, was still empty, a portend of things to come.\n\nDug into my selections, and immediately realized that salt was the primary seasoning, as this food had zero flavor!  The beef appeared to be soaked in soy sauce and the shrimp salad was completely devoid of any shrimp taste whatsoever.  And then to add to the insult, the Eggs Benedict was presented on a rock-hard muffin half that took lots of sawing with a sharp knife to penetrate.  As I said, two stars for the view, but zero stars for the food!!  One plate of this was enough for me, and as someone said, \"That looks like about $5 worth,\" it was more than enough for me.\n\nOh yeah, was still waiting for the coffee, so sampled the cheesecake which was OK.  Finally grabbed a server long enough for her to drop her champagne bottle and get me some more coffee, but it was a trial!\n\nWith all the great breakfast places here in the city (Brendas, etc.) I can't understand why anyone would come here unless you're a tourist, which I ain't.

So this year, we really compromised, we held a reservation for Garden Court and Cliff House and after much debate, we finally settled to try a different location since we were going to the very pricey French Laundry for lunch the day before. We settled for Cliff House since we vowed to try a new Easter brunch place every year.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins late past our reservation time but the hostess did not qualm and we were taken to our seats. Unfortunately, all the window seats were taken but there is really no bad seat in the house since we could still see the ocean, the beach and all with the large window views. We perused the buffet table and was somewhat disappointed since it was a rather small selection compared to the abundance of food at Garden Court last year  (the buffet spread was held in a separate ballroom from the dining room!), sigh, I know, I know....we are not supposed to compare. There was even a line at the buffet table at the Cliff House! This was not the case at the banquet hall like setting at Garden Court, there were so many stations, that you can barely taste everything, let alone a line! Never....\n\nWell, we tasted most of the items at Cliff House, the ham and lamb at the carving station was alright, took a bite of each from bf's plate....the starters were some beet salad and beef salad. Next came the usual scrambled egg, sausage and bacon, potato au gratin, pancake and syrup or apple cinnamon, pasta, .....so typical and nothing fanciful.\n\nAlthough I can totally give 5 stars to their popovers! It was the highlight of the meal! Along with their desserts, there were some delicious eclairs, strawberries dipped in chocolate and tiny cakes. The cheesecake was however, just eh....\n\nI really hate to compare but then again, when you already had the best buffet brunches (Garden Court in Palace Hotel and Navio Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay that is), this place really didn't live up to our expectations...sigh oh sigh...", "author": "Yan M."}

Highlights for me would be the butternut squash salad with walnuts and cranberries, the red and yellow beet salad, Thai beef salad, eggs benedict, macaroni and cheese, steak and scalloped potatoes and the very moist chocolate cake.  I enjoyed my four trips to the buffet table so much that I completely forgot to try the french toast and the shrimp.

A two. I know it's a brunch, and I really didn't have THAT high an expectation going into all of this, but really - enough of the warm food wasn't warm. I like my breakfast food warm. Warm french toast, warm eggs benedict, warm potatoes au gratin. Bordering on hot, temperature wise. \n\nTheir food (I know it's buffet, and I know it cannot stay piping hot, ok!?) was just barely bordering on warm, and that just dissipointed me. The syurp for the french toast was the only really warm thing that they had out there - otherwise, once your plate hit the table, your food was cooling, and quickly. \n\nService was sweet, attentive and lovely. If I had wanted to indulge in my \"drunk before noon\" moment, I could have very easily, due to the fact that the ladies pouring champagne were constantly circulating in the room. They are also very very good about making sure that plates are cleared out of the way, though it would have been nice to get fresh silverware from time to time.\n\nLucky for me however, it was for my Aunt's birthday, whom I LOATHE eating out with most of the time (she has some anti-food habits that are just BEYOND. seriously beyond), so I don't feel too bad about eating here.

My now wife and I were looking for a venue for a destination wedding reception in San Francisco. Cliff House was our first choice after doing a lot of internet research. I contacted Cliff House and was informed that our wedding date was still available. I informed Cliff House that we could not put a deposit without first personally visiting the venue and eating at the restaurant. I also informed Cliff House that we would make a trip out to San Francisco in May. The representative told me that Cliff House would place a \"hold\" on our wedding date for us. I checked with Cliff House a couple of weeks later about the \"hold\" and informed them of our upcoming trip to SF to interview vendors. A few days later, I was told that someone else was also  interested on our wedding date, and that Cliff House would no longer \"hold\" the date for us unless we signed a contract and put a deposit within 48 hours. In short, the \"hold\" placed for us was really not a \"hold\" at all. What's the use of a \"hold\" if the \"hold\" only applies when no one else wanted the date!? Yes, Cliff House gave us the right of first refusal. But that has no value when Cliff House clearly was informed of our situation as out-of-towners. We understand that Cliff House is a business, and there was no guarantee that we would have chosen Cliff House as our wedding reception venue. Nevertheless, Cliff House should have then not informed us that they were \"holding\" the date for us. The story does have a happy ending though. My beautiful wife and I got married in San Francisco, and had a great time at Ondine Sausalito. The food was great. The service was great. The views are awesome too.", "author": "Armanius M."}

Many years and many million dollars later,  this place has transformed into something much more than just a tourist stop.\n\nWe started with the roasted chestnut soup.  The flavor of the chestnut was there but subtle, which extended to the consistency as well.  For lunch, I had the bouillabaisse in Thai curry.  Unfortunately, half of the dish was salmon and some sort of white fish.  I'm not a fan of salmon so took everything out and gave them to E.  Luckily, it also came with some dungeness crab, a couple of prawns and scallops, all of which was delicious in the curry sauce which was very heavy on the coconut milk.\n\nI then finished the meal with a cup of tea.

It has been over a decade since I last came here and it has changed so much...\n\n     * Space: The area where the Sunday Brunch was a banquet room on the lower floor holding maybe120 persons.  The tables were evenly spaced, although you were close enough to hear people's conversations. Since it had been pouring there were still a good number of empty tables around us.\n     * Atmosphere:  The place looked and felt fancy all while still being casual.  Everyone in attendance dressed in varying manners (from sneakers and jeans to nice slacks and a coat).The food was displayed in an artistic manner directly in the middle of the room. There was plenty of light coming in through the windows and the harpist added a nice, romantic touch to a stormy day.\n     * Drink: Coffee and bottomless champagne at 10AM ... who couldn't love it?  There was also orange juice and mimosas offered as well.\n     * Eat: Arrive with an empty stomach and walk away with flavors tantalizing your taste buds and the eggs benedicts, shrimp, tender steak, warm bread and popovers (their specialty!), fresh fruit, fine cheeses, and desserts of all tastes and textures stuffed in your belly.\n     * Service:  Accommodating and well organized.  My coffee cup and champagne glass were never left empty.  The finished plates were always tended to and removed promptly.\n\nOverall:  I would say coming to the Cliff House for brunch is more for experience and view rather than taste.  Although the food was yummy it's not extraordinary.  For me, it was the location, historical features and atmosphere that seemed to offer more.  Would I come back?  Sure, why not...but I would like to try other places first.\n\n[Side notes: \n- Since we take pubtranspo everywhere in the city, parking isn't an issue (and it didn't seem to be an issue on the rainy day we went).

I just had a few things that needed to be improved to make it perfect.\nFor a 45 dollar brunch I expect some delectable pork.  Their sausage was meh and their bacon was just okay.  I suppose, though, that I've been spoiled by the Brunch at the Coeur D'Alene resort in which their bacon is glazed with maple syrup.  That bacon haunts my dreams.

I could have gone for a cinnamon roll or a danish or something.\nThose were my only complaints.  All the food was tasty.  I believe I ate my weight in shrimp and I lost count of how many glasses of champagne I drank.

Ocean beach is beautiful, and we were lucky to be seated by the window with a great view of the desserts.\n\nFood: Presentation is beyond spectacular, with beautiful trays of glazed salmon and cocktails. I mostly avoided the salad and stuck with the meats and desserts. The primer rib was okay, salmon was okay too, not very warm which I thought was strange, egg benedict was good.\n\nChampagne: Nothing like bottomless champagne flowing in your glass. I thought it was strange though how we had to ask for orange juice, it should've been a given.\n\nService: HORRIBLE. At first it was going okay. I was in a group of 4 and we are slow eaters. I am positive we neither ate nor drank $50 worth but that is how much we paid for the brunch, each. Around 2 or so hours, we asked for more champagne, since we had already stopped eating for awhile and was rudely ignored by a waitress. We thought it was strange, but didn't want it to ruin our brunch and waited until another waitress was nearby. While waiting, a member in our party got tired and rested his head by the wall (since he was seated by it).  A rude waitress came by and told us \"excuse me, you cannot sleep here!\" I have never been treated like that in a restaurant before, and everyone in our party was shocked. We tried to let it go, and thought we'd have some more champagne. We pretty much had to flag her down, and ask her if we could have more champagne. If you want to avoid her, she is a big, brunette lady with inappropriately pink lipstick. \n\nDialogue:\nMe: \"Can we have more champagne?\"\nWaitress: \"No\"\nUs: \"Why?\"\nWaitress: \"First of all, you (points at my friend) was sleeping, and second of all you've been here for more than 2 hours\"\n\nI couldn't believe it. Sure we had been there for 2 hours, but none of us ate much. In addition, the room still had many empty tables. Furthermore, no restaurant I have ever been to has told us how to act when eating, and when to finish eating. It was simply the worst service ever. Besides the waitress, I thought I would've given this place 4 stars.

The entrees are spendy, as you would expect.  We split an entree and then fed each other desert. The desert was so erotic.  But for me, I go here with someone very special and it is about me and her and the ocean.  Everything/everyone else is secondary.

This past weekend, I saw something so offensive to all health standards, that I will never return.  As my fiance and I were sitting there with his family, we were watching the staff clear the table beside us.  In doing so, they held back several unused coffee cups. Instead of replacing them with fresh cups, they kept them on the table for the next people!  SO GROSS.  There might not have been coffee in them, but that does not mean that they haven't been touched, licked, and god knows what else.  Honestly, the servers should clear cups and glasses that are not going to be used early in the meal and not leave them sitting on the table throughout the whole meal. We were shocked and horrified and what we were seeing.  So, so gross.  I am sorry, but this is not acceptable, especially not at a place that is this expensive.  After seeing this, I purposefully poured something into my otherwise unused champagne glass, which I knew I had picked up from the top and not the stem. \n\nAside from that grossness, the food is fine, but you can definitely do better for your money elsewhere.  The tables depending on which one you are seated at, can be very annoying.  The round tables are really rectangular tables with round toppers.  That means that two people get horrible seats which place them right between two legs of the table and leave them unable to scoot their chair in.  Very annoying.  The service this past weekend was deplorable.  We kept having to ask for more coffee repeatedly and then they would come back and only offer coffee to the one person who asked and not the rest of the table.  It was terrible.

We took family to the Terrace Room Sunday brunch, 'cuz that's where the birthday boy wanted to go . . . The Cliff House has undergone many face-lifts and reconstructions over the years. Of course, nothing can possibly compare to the original 1890's historic beauty. But, over the years they have tried. The ocean views are spectacular on any given day, from the outside deck and the walkway that takes you either around the point to the North, or to the beach to the South. I recommend stopping to enjoy the views. But, you don't have to go to the restaurant for that. \nOn to the Sunday Brunch review - No matter how much you pay, or what the restaurant touts as being a \"MUST DO\", a 'champagne brunch' is a 'champagne brunch' is a 'champagne brunch'. . . and the Terrace Room is no exception or big deal. For $40 uh plus bucks, you get the standards you would expect in food. I do have to say that the butternut squash with pomegranate and caramelized walnuts was exceptional. A dish that we will try to duplicate at home. The food was all fresh and hot or cold (whichever it was supposed to be). So, I don't have any particular complaints or issues with the food. The buffet is set in the middle of the long room, so it is easily accessed from two sides, which reduces the traffic jam of many a buffet. No omelet station, carving station, or Belgium waffle station, all three of which seem to be standards elsewhere. \nBUT. . . here is my issue that drops the score waaaay down. The dining layout truly bites the big one! The photos you will see on the website show open spaces and nice two and four top window tables. What you actually have are those nice window tables with 4-6 two and four tops lined up with them, out from the window. So, you have looooong cafeteria style seating projecting out from each window. Is that their idea of advertising lots of window seating? And, the space between row A and row B is so small that I could barely shimmy down the aisle to my seat (which was AT the window). I have no idea how anyone with any kind of waistline can get down the aisle, if MY 32 inch waist had so much trouble. So much for requesting a window table!!! Getting in and out was such a hassle that I actually ate less. Maybe that is the intention. And, you had better be nice to the table next to you, because they are basically at YOUR table. I guess if San Franciscan's are used to row houses, they can deal with row dining tables.\nMy suggestion would be to opt for Sutro's as opposed to the Terrace Room. Sutros has a far better dining layout, and HUGE windows for viewing the ocean while you dine. I will not be returning to the Terrace Room.", "author": "Greg S."}

From the very beginning of our planning, Virginia, Massoud and Sara were delightful to work with.  No question was too small to warrant a quick response, no amount of meetings was too many, and when I forgot to pay my 75% deposit on time because I was dealing with a sick cat, it was no problem.  My Led Zeppelin cover band was not only welcomed but encouraged to turn it up to 11.  My husband and I had a wonderful day and amazing photos with the sunset.  A few words of advice.  It will be windy, spray that hair!  A few moments' chill made for amazing, dramatic pictures with my veil billowing, well, into my dad's face, but after he moved over it was striking.  The room is rather blandly decorated so as not to distract from the views, so we went with bright centerpieces and it worked well.  The food was fantastic, we went with the crab melts (these need to be on the regular menu), mozzarella kabobs, mini lamb chops and shrimp cocktail as appetizers and the fillet mignon and duck (YUM!!!) as entrees and everyone loved their dinner.  I found myself chasing the crab melt girl around the room between pictures.  Massoud was fantastic at keeping the evening on schedule and making sure my husband and I were allowed to sit back and enjoy the evening.  Not only was it beautiful and the ocean sunset view was a great plus for our many guests from landlocked states, it was one of the most reasonably priced venues we looked at, and we looked at a lot of venues.

Reservations were made online, but when we got there, the manager was so rude to us.  The host said, that the website for the cliff house was misleading and people accidently make the wrong reservation. She was trying to get us seated, when the manager came and told my family that we could not each brunch at all.  I wanted to leave, but my mom really wanted to eat, so we ate at the bar restaurant upstairs.  Half way through i went down to the brunch host area to use the restroom near by.  As i passed, i saw a white family having the same issue.  They made the wrong reservation too.  The manager came out and greeted them, told them to wait and he would figure something out.  Then he quickly escorted the family to brunch!  I gasped and was shocked.  My family is a family color.", "author": "E E."}

Many different things to choose from and new things to try. The food was excellent. Make sure you go hungry because you will eat twice. The desserts are fantastic and original. The service is excellent and the view it spectacular. It really makes for a great way to start the day or to celebrate an occasion. Be sure to make a reservation and also be sure to ask for window seating when you do.", "author": "Adrian M."}

So sad...anyway, my sister was right.  It's exactly the same (as before the remodel).  Like Rick H. said, it's high quality but modest fare - but I really think it's slim pickings...maybe sometimes I do go for quantity over quality (options, people!)?  I dunno...but no shrimp cocktail, no omelette station, no carving station, very few lunch entrees, small dessert section.  The popovers are a treat, though.  It's a pretty intimate setting - the room is quite narrow and long with the single buffet table right down the middle; harpist is in the middle of the room against the wall; can get kind of noisy with all the chit-chat going on.  But alas, it's the Cliff House - so it's just kind of cool to check it out regardless.  Can't remember the price, but I think it's around $40.  Call for reservations.", "author": "Joyce L."}

The rest of the party actually was able to be seated and actually began eating right away. The one thing I didn't like about the was the seating. We sat at a round table with the view. The view was beautiful, but the seats that are up against the window were so close to wall, trying to get out to get more food was really hard. First I had to ask the person next to me to get up, then I had to fight the table leg and when I actually got up, I had the fight with the window curtain. Geez all for another plate of food. I thought what the food I had was average. I would have liked more options, but I suppose for $39, I would not expect caviar and blinis. There was nothing too impressive on the menu. I like the smoked salmon, but how can you go wrong with smoked salmon? There was also different types of noodle salads and a couple of different types of eggs which I tried neither of. I was there was there a brunch and was not about to eat something that I can easily cook at home. The gratinated  potatoes were good and not runny. I would love to have seen a chef cooking omelettes to order. I thought the steak was very tender, but be sure to get it when it comes fresh out if the kitchen, because when it is left on the burner, it just looses it juiciness and just starts to become dry. I would have love to have tried a popover, but the whole time I was there, the pan was empty. I loved the never ending champagne, I didn't even realize that the champagne was never ending, so it was a pleasant surprise. The desserts were good. I liked the chocolate covered strawberries and the chocolate mousse. The marbled cheesecake was also good, not too sweet. The little cakes/fruit tarts were okay. I would have liked to have seen a tiramisu. We never really needed to stand in line to get our food and most of the food came out as soon as it was gone. The service was really good. They made sure the plates were taken right away and our cups were never empty. I would come back here again, but be sure to come here a bit early to look for parking.", "author": "carebear l."}

Food and wine selections has variety, they have my fav. steam mussels in garlic white wine broth with nice warm bread( must ask for a warm bread nex time say hot cuz it was not even warm), and clam chowder soup and cocktail shrimps cheese plates..must give a 5star  but the waiter was not so nice so give it a 4..esp when was rude in suggestions between a pinot noir and a merlot...he sent 2 tasting wine galss but did not give me the merlot but zinfandel..didn't want to bicker about it  but made my  choice to pinot , then for bread, he said conly crackers for clam chowder so i said can i get warm bread for my dish and replied \"it is not in this level but have to go in the lower floor\" what an excuse... other than this..love it !!", "author": "cecille p."}

I think the variety is still not up to par with a lot of places in the city, but you will find something you like.. and the location is just stunning, one of the best views in the city.", "author": "Laura K."}

The service however , leaves something to be desired. One needs to have a sense of humour about the absurd attitude the serving staff might dish out. The kind that needs to be developed for flight attendants , customer reps etc.", "author": "M p."}
