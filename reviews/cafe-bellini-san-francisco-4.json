I saw a waffle that had a tasty set of toppings, so I asked for that set of toppings on my crepe. The staff told me that I had to choose from the preset options of crepes, and after pushing the issue, she asked her supervisor, whom instructed the employee how to ring up the item. After being charged extra for the custom crepe, I was still given a preset menu option different than what I ordered. \n\nThe lack of employees nowadays who know the POS system their using and how to sell the product they carry seems poor in many stores across the board, but this experience stuck out most memorable. \n\nIt seems that denying a customer what they want even if the customer is willing to pay goes against better business practices and creates attrition in return business.", "author": "dAvid s."}

The person who took my order not only touched the cash I gave him, but made my smoothie without changing his gloves. When I saw him touched the banana and avocado with those same gloves it was an internal fight to bitch about it or walk away. I consumed all my energy on shopping earlier in the day so I went with the latter and threw the smoothie away. After that incident, I will not be coming back there.\n\nFor those who come here, please be more aware of who makes your food after you place your order.

When you walk in it's actually much larger. On the left they have their caf\u00e9 - barista station with all of the grab and go pastries and sandwiches, and on the right is the bar. Farther in the back is all of the restaurant seating for the sit down dining. My fianc\u00e9 and I were very hungry after we did a road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco. We knew we were going to have a big dinner so we really didn't care where we went for lunch. We got frustrated from walking around so much so just decided on this for pure convenience. We were able to be seated right away. It was about 1 PM on a Saturday afternoon. It's very close seating so expect to sit close to other tables. We were greeted right away by our server, Carlos. I was between two different Panini's and he told me to get the Bellini special. I was sold. Anytime they put their restaurant name on a sandwich, it better be good! Also, I always take recommendations from the staff. My fianc\u00e9 got an cold, Italian sandwich. We waited for about 20 to 25 minutes before our food arrived. The environment was growing more and more busy. At this point, the place was still not completely packed but for some reason they sat a couple right next to us and it felt like we were sitting with them! I wish they would've spread them out a little bit more. At the end, it didn't really matter because the place was almost completely full. This made me feel like we made a good decision. Our food was delicious, because it got so busy our server didn't come back for a while to bring us our check. We had to track him down. Once we did, we were able to pay and be on our way. This whole process took about an hour. The next morning, we were ready to begin our road trip back and wanted a coffee and some breakfast to go. Since we didn't feel like going on the Internet or walking around, we decided to return to Caf\u00e9 Bellini. This was around 10 AM on Sunday morning. The place was very busy. We were able to get our coffee and a breakfast burrito to go in the course of 20 minutes. Overall, this place will not blow your mind - but it is a great place for some quick breakfast or lunch. My fianc\u00e9's Italian sandwich was better than the Bellini Panini so I definitely recommend that. The California burrito to-go was delicious as well, lots of cheese though.

So I waited in the middle, hoping that I could see if one was being made first. 10 minutes passed - okay, where's my drink? I walk around and see nobody making a drink. I then have to ask one of the workers, \"Where's my drink?\" She then goes and grabs it... So it's been sitting at the counter the entire time without me knowing that it was ready. \n\nOkay, so about the crepe now, I waited literally 20 minutes. When the guy finally passes me my box with my crepe inside, his female coworker grabs it back, without saying excuse me, opens the box and starts examining the crepe with him. What are they talking about? Was there something wrong with my crepe?! She then tells me to wait 5 more minutes and throws my crepe back onto the heater. I guess my chicken crepe was either cold or not cooked all the way? I didn't want to know, so I didn't even ask. I just waited and waited until I got my food. So now, I'm eating...

After a long day of exploring the city, my feet were killing me and it was time for a refreshment to reenergize my holiday spirits.\n\nI decided to ruin my dinner appetite by indulging in a tiny raspberry tart washed down with some XXX Vitamin Water.  My eyes nearly popped out when my bill came out to nearly $10 for the two.  This place is a highway robbery!  The tart itself lacked the sweetness and tartness that I craved and the tiny portion was less than satiating.  While it may be the only reasonable alternative to the fast-food dominated court, the only impression that it left was that I didn't ever want to spend so much on a pastry again.\n\nI can understand how their location and clientele might drive up their prices, but never this much for such a mediocre pastry.  If their pastries really popped, I might consider it a fairly decent deal, but at any cost, I felt that it really wasn't anything more than glorified mall food.\n\nFood: 4/10\n\nService: 6/10\n\nPrice: $\n\nAtmosphere: 6/10", "author": "Joe M."}

I headed over to Nordstrom to see if anything there would strike their fancy and on the way, decided to stop for some caffeine.\n\nCafe Bellini is located on the bottom floor of the Westfield mall made famous by variable floors of circling escalators.  This is away from the frou frou shop additions on the other side near Bloomingdale's.  The counter is nice, with one side for drinks and the other to feature fresh made sandwiches, salads, and pastries.  The sales staff and baristas are also very nice.\n\nUnfortunately, my choices were not reflective of the initial impressive view of this place.  My Ginger Spice latte was lukewarm and whatever syrup that was pumped in left a chemical taste in my mouth.  The Blueberry scone was dry and bitter, which is usually the case when the dough is left out too long.  I ended up picking off the top part spreckled with sugar and dumped the rest.\n\nI really wish my experience was better.  I do, however, appreciate the slight moment to rest my aching old bag back prior to heading back up to Nordstrom.  Hopefully, I will have made a wiser choice, such as a simple cup of the Lavazza coffee and a little yogurt next time.", "author": "Miika M."}

Their cappuccino is extremely good, to the extent that BF felt compelled to ask how they made their coffee... He just got a \"from our machines\" answer LOL. They like to leave a strong coffee flavor and do not masquerade it with lots of steamed milk. Still, milk was poured in and lots of fun foam was present. \n\nThe first time I visited I went for the vegetarian crepe, and it was just heavenly. It had an array of vegetables paired with a fluffy crepe. There was nothing else one could do to improve it; it was perfect. It came with a spring mix salad, which I also enjoyed. BF had the Pan con Pollo, which he found delicious and small.. The small part can only speak volumes to the deliciousness because he enjoyed it so much, he wished he had more. We dined in, and service was optimal.\n\nThe second time I had the Vegetable Delight Omelet, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It came with 4 pieces of 1/2 regular cut slices of toast, if it makes any sense. It also came with delicious potatoes from the griddle. It was really good, and it left me very full actually. Good to keep me going until late afternoon. BF had the Prosciutto Ciabatta, and he considered it to just be okay. Again, we dined in, and service was excellent.\n\nThe third time, regrettably, was our breakfast before we returned back home. I don't know if the establishment read our mind set of \"regrettably\" because the service was not our usual top notch experience. The service was regretful. They were full, and we decided we did not have enough time to dine in and catch our flight. Therefore, we ordered to go. I ordered the Eggplant and Mozzarella Ciabatta, which I found okay. It was good, but it didn't blow me away. BF had the Pan con Pollo again, and he loved it. They took a long time to give us our food and it didn't come with fries, only if you dined in they included it. Also, they had to be reminded we ordered cappuccinos, but at the end they delivered. Additionally, I had ordered a fruit tart. When I got to the hotel, I noticed I had been given actual fruit. I was like \"what?\". I went back and told them I had ordered and paid for a fruit tart. They quickly exchanged the fruit for the right item. The tart wasn't even all that. I guess when they are really busy, the food and service are not the same.", "author": "Stephany R."}

I know that the pastries are fresh baked daily which is why I stopped by. Once paid for and stepping away I pulled off the end of the croissant and got a hard and tough mouth full. I knew that it should be better and returned to the counter to enquire about the freshness of the pastry. I was assured that it was freshly baked and that no pastries from the previous day were in the cafe. I said that the croissant was tough and did not taste fresh. The woman who seemed to be the manager behind the counter repeated herself about the freshness of the item I had purchased. Her attitude came across that there is no problem with what I had purchased. She dismissed my inquiry with a smile that said \"you don't know what your taking about\". She did not even try to test the pastry for being over-baked or dried out. I have no idea why a fresh baked pastry would be tough and chewy, Especially a flakey croissant. The manager was so stead fast that there was no other option - I tossed the white bag containing the rest of the pastry on the counter and said \"It's not worth eating\" and turned and walked away. The customer service by the manager was poor, she was rude in her attitude and she had an attitude that she knew best. She is not someone that I would want representing my business. \nNeedless to say I will never return to this cafe to be treated like that again.  All I wanted was to have a freshly baked croissant that was not over cooked and dry. I headed to La Boulange where I had got a fleshy baked flakey croissant that was so buttery it made me happy that the first one was not good.

If you find yourself standing behind the ropes three feet away from the museum of chocolate, custard, fruit and other diet-sabotaging pastries, you've found it.  Talk about sweet selection.  It took me a few seconds to realize that these people weren't in line and I should be on the other side of the rope to order a Caesar salad.  I did so from a smiling counter person and it was about $7.00.  It wasn't bad.  The lady actually making the salad asked if I wanted the dressing on the side or mix it all in.  That was nice of them to ask.  Yeah, poor it on!  Pretty good.  Even around 2 PM, it was a little difficult to find a table.", "author": "Bernadette M."}

Partially because whatever I get seems to be pretty tasty and also because the staff is so nice. They pretty much know my rotation by now ( caprese salad, quiche lorraine, roast beef sammy) by now and they always make good small talk with me while we wait for my receipt to print. They even give me my mall discount as a default, even when I'm not working.", "author": "Jessica R."}

The staff is friendly and efficient, and to my taste, their espresso drinks are the best to be had in the Union Square area.  Reading some of the other reviews here, I can see that this is a matter of opinion but... I enjoy the place a lot so I wanted to cast my vote.", "author": "John M."}
