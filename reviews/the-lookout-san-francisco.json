Drinks, especially cocktail specials, are reasonably priced, and, overall, it's a simple, no-frills place. My pet peeve is having to pay a cover on weekends even after any special acts have ended for the evening, so if this is a sticking point for you, then beware.\n\nOtherwise, this is quite a pleasant hangout if it's not crowded, primarily for the balcony.", "author": "Vincent L."}

We ended up with choice seats at the corner outdoor lanai. \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe bar takes up the entire second floor of a two level building at the corner of 16th & Market, right where the parade passes.  Plus, they have a cool but skinny outdoor lanai with a railing counter and bar stools that is excellent for people-watching.  The inside has some good square footage but it still can get cramped. \n\nThe crowd was a mix.  We met all walks of life while here, including a gay-friendly drunk straight girl traveling nurse that wanted to take my gay friend and possibly me home.  :-O  Thanks anyway, sister lol. \n\nThey have a full service bar and great music.  My Bud aluminum bottles were a mere $3 regular price, yes!\n\nSERVICE:\nThough I didn't experience it because all of my beers were purchased for me, my friends returned fairly quickly from the bar, so service was fast despite the busyness. \n\nFUN TIP:\nSomething that kept me entertained were the ding dong drivers at the intersection of Market, Noe & 16th.  Some drivers on Noe that were headed north would stop for some reason in the middle of Market, thus blocking traffic headed east on Market.

Music was awesome and drinks were actually good and strong. We were feeling good and enjoying ourselves when this employee comes over to clear our drinks from the table and then decides to make some condescending remarks to us about \"enjoying the show\" and something about how we should order their new \"pumpkin spice drink.\" We couldn't really hear the dude because it was so loud but we all felt the same vibe from him....which was get the fuck out. So we instantly decide to close out our tab and leave. I don't even know or have the words to describe how he made me feel.

From community outreach, to the support of local performers, to fundraisers, to special causes, this bar does it all. There are categorically distinct qualities which engender loyalty to businesses, and one such quality is knowing that the business stands by its clients, maintaining a singular level of support to their brand. While this quality can be seen in the small things, it is in the business's worst moments that they have a chance to show their true colors.\n\nI have always enjoyed The Lookout -- its staff, its view, its atmosphere, and its reinforcement of its local community. Nevertheless, I recently had an experience that tested my care for this fine establishment. The owner and management staff were excellent in their outreach and attentive in resolving my issue, and seemed to truly care about my experience.

We paid $5 cover apiece to get in, and we head to the bar. I see a flyer for a cocktail named \"Hurricane Bianca\": Southern Comfort, pineapple juice, grapefruit juice, and bubbles. My boyfriend sees a flyer for sangria. Both cost $9.\n\nWe order our drinks, and I'm blown away by the Hurricane Bianca. Served in a tall hurricane glass with an orange wedge and a cherry, it tastes great and looks great with its citrus ombre. This beautiful cocktail saves my review from being one star.\n\nMy boyfriend, meanwhile, gets a short glass of an amber colored liquid. He tells me it tastes strongly of cinnamon. I try some, and I'm forced to agree. It tastes remarkably one-note. He goes up to the bar to ask how they make it.\n\nAt this point I should inform you that I've made sangria myself. I used a big glass dispenser where i soaked a couple cups of diced apples and oranges in a bottle of white wine mixed with some club soda and a little bit of apple brandy. It tasted pretty good. People liked it.\n\nMy boyfriend comes back. The bartender told him that the sangria was one half white wine and one half Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey.\n\nNow, Fireball sangria exists, and--though I haven't tried to make it--I don't think it would taste like the awful swill we paid $9 for. This is not a cocktail you or I would knowingly order, and The Lookout should be ashamed to sell us a drink that is clearly not sangria and tell us it is.\n\nWhite wine and Fireball do not make sangria. The Lookout charged us $5 cover and $9 for cocktails. The Hurricane Bianca was a knockout. The sangria was disgusting, fraudulent backwash.", "author": "Robert F."}

Upon my arrival I noticed the bathroom was not only filthy, but each stall was out of toilet paper. I attempted to use the single bathroom, but it was occupied. So I approached the bartender who was just standing there, he was not busy, and let him know there was no toilet paper. He looked as if I was insane, and then casually said \"oh yeah, we're all out\" as if that was an acceptable response. I paused for a moment, surprised by his reaction, and said \"ok, so what are you telling your customers then?\" To which he then said, \"well I don't know, no one has ever asked for toilet paper before!\" Im not kidding, he actually said that. That cavalier response combined with his complete lack of customer service skills were annoying enough, but even more so because I reeeally  had to use the bathroom! I asked him if he was the Manager and when he said no, I asked him to go get them. According to him the Manager was unavailable. Finally, after arguing with him for a few minutes he reluctantly agreed to go find some toilet paper. This entire time I did not see anyone else buying drinks or needing help. And there was a second bartender on duty anyway. \nHe then leaves the bar and is gone for a few minutes, and returns with no toilet paper. Next, he disappears for a few more minutes and eventually returns with a single roll of toilet paper and just sets it on top of the empty dispenser in one stall. Meanwhile the second stall still has none. He says nothing to me and proceeds to just go back to the bar. As he passes, I said \"thank you.\" Even though I would have rather just said a few expletives. \n\nEven if I felt better and relieved, quite literally, that whole encounter left me with a bad impression and I chose to just leave. Why on earth should I spend my money at a place where the bartender thinks that its ok to treat his customers that way. While I'm  sure people that work in a bar have to deal with crazy or drunk people often, that does not entitle them to provide horrible customer service like that.

Outside, there's a balcony where the fire breathing dragons congregate so that they can keep their cancer fumes to themselves.  Even though the balcony was in open air, the smoke somehow lingered in the vicinity and made me start wheezing. I used to be a fire breathing dragon a couple years ago so I was really surprised that their fumes affected me.\n\nBecause I was sober driver for the night, I wasn't able to try their $5 drink special that my buddy Kassidy loved.

I've never had the food or been there on a Sunday (when there's apparently always a fundraiser of some sort going on) but on both Fridays and Saturdays this place is pretty fun. \n\nFridays can be hit or miss as far as the crowd goes (I don't think they have any sort of theme/promotion on this night), but it's never too crowded and for the most part it's friendly. Saturday night is when they have \"Social.\" This entails a $4 cover, better music than on Friday, and for the most part a \"prettier\" crowd. \n\nThe thing I really like about this place is that it's one of those bars where it can be whatever you want it to be. There's a couple areas where they have tables and chairs inside so I if you wanna sit there all night, in a t-shirt and jeans, and be casual it's fine. If you wanna dress up a little more and stay near the dance floor that's fine too! There balcony is always fun for people watching down below and I've had some interesting conversations with random guys out there. \n\nThey have a full bar, standard drink prices, and pretty hot bartenders.

(Bring Your Own Bear) or at least binge-and-purge-worthy because the portions are huge and the carbs are free flowing!  It's far from fine dining, but decent for this culinary-starved neighborhood.  The appetizers tend to have the most unique arrangements but the deep dish pizza is decent.\n\nItalian Nachos: I never never never thought I'd find such a unique and tasty snack at a Castro bar!  Pasta chips kind of taste like pizza dough made into chips.  The asiago cheese and Italian sausage are what really makes the dish because they beat queso blanco and chorizo any day!  The tomatoes, peppers and olives add a nice contrast but were merely wingmen to the aforementioned stars of the party.\n\nCheese Fries: Pretty boring.  After having such a great asiago cheese on the Italian nachos, I expected more.  Both cheeses were bland and melted on... cheez whiz would have even been better.  Definitely avoid as there are much better ways to have your carbs.\n\nChicken Club Deep Dish Pizza: Why put the chicken as the headliner when there is yummy bacon and ham?  My pizza expertise is more in the NY-style realm, so I can't comment too much on the attempted Chicago-style authenticity.  It was tasty, but super filling.

Little did we know, this would become an epic day of booze, boobs, and boos!\n\nIt began with jell-o shots!  There's always room for jell-o and we found this to be our demise!  We just so happened to go on a day where there was a fundraiser for a local gay soccer team.  With one jell-o shot underway, we decided to start off with a drink each. Then we were on our 2nd drink.  This time i bought and let me just say that drinks were not unfairly priced but they weren't super cheap or anything either.  The bartenders we're particularly friendly but they got your drink to you with a quickness.  Not to say they were rude or anything, they just did their job and moved onto the next drink.  As I was buying all our 2nd drinks, David T goes and buys us each a shot of Patron.  So to recap, i've had 2 pints of beer and 2 vodka drinks from 2 previous places, a jell-o shot, a shot of patron, and 2 greyhounds.  \n\nBy this time, i've noticed that this place is pretty crowded.  People were pretty good looking, and everyone was minding their own business.

I see the pizza place and LookOut as totally separate.  It's all about the pizza.  And what a pie it is. \n\nWe arrived at the top of the stairs to find an empty dining room.  Promptly greeted by the owner, Chris, who led us to a window table.  Great table, but the banquette bench on one side is significantly higher than the stool on the other.  We wondered if it's possible to lower the bench side; probably cheaper than replacing tables and stools.  \n\nThe glasses of red that we ordered were great.  The spinach salad was ho-hum, but the Caesar was delicious.  A creamy garlicky dressing evenly covered the evenly chopped romaine.  Note, I appreciate the even chop, while others prefer a rough tear or a classic, whole leaf.  The uniformity of the chop contrasted with the larger, rosemary-scented, focaccia croutons--homemade--and fresh-ground black pepper delivered a nice compliment to the garlic. One suggestion: toss those amazing croutons with the greens as you're dressing them!  Leave no crouton unturned!  \n\nCrouton lovers: run, don't walk. \n\nNow, to the pie. \n\nWe ordered the \"Castro Queen\" pie though we're now calling it the \"Upper Market Bro.\"  I doubt many Castro queens are going to going to delight in the thick, crunchy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside cornmeal crust topped with a layer of perfectly melted cheese and a tomato sauce that rivals any I've had.  Imagine Zachary's in Berkeley, but punch up the seasoning and flavor of each pizza component and you've got Thick 'n' Thin.  The sauce tastes so fresh, and cuts right through the richness of the cheese and denseness of the crust, leaving you wanting to take another bite before you've hardly chewed the one you're enjoying. \n\nI'm heading there with friends on Friday night, so I'll probably try the thin crust option, another Caesar, and I'll note the name and details of the wine I liked.  \n\nHappy eating!", "author": "Jeremy D."}

I've been a deep dish fan since my kiddie days visiting Chicago, and the bar in the Bay Area is set pretty high due to Zachary's and, more recently, Little Star.\n\nWhile pizza is the main focus here, they do serve other items that go well with a place that's much more known for drinking than eating. Having said that, they do make a pretty decent pie. The cornmeal crust is executed quite nicely, giving a good crunch and solid base. Where this place fell short was in the other ingredients. The toppings were a little sparse, and the sauce was truly disappointing. What's always made an excellent deep dish pizza for me is the fresh, chunky tomato sauce that steams on top. What we got on our pie was too tangy, not very chunky, and altogether not that fresh tasting.\n\nHaving said that, if I am at the Lookout and got a serious deep dish craving, I probably wouldn't hesitate to order one.

Easy.  Love it.\n\nThe Cyndi Lauper beverage (vodka, cran, red bull) is also tasty, but REALLY SWEET.", "author": "Evan G."}

Not a lot is changed from when it was Metro but something is different.  \n\nIts amazing how much changing lights, a paint job, moving all the shit off the counters and putting in a lounge corner can do for the ambiance of a place.  My first time visiting The Lookout was in the evening and the darkness outside combined with the warm lighting inside provided a great ambiance and a feeling of class, something we all know is completely missing in the Castro.  The hot bartender provided something to look at behind the bar.\n\nThe place was dead and pretty much always looks dead from the outside and I count this as a plus.  I was able to take over a portion of the lounge seating to wait for my man and crew.  When they arrived we could actually hold a conversation and were able to get the attention of the hotness behind the bar every time we needed refills with no struggle.\n\nI know there must still be some of the old Sunday Funday rowdiness goin on here since I see the guys dangling off the balcony on Sunday afternoons.  Someday I'll wander over and check it out.", "author": "Ian M."}

(according to marketing material and posters I saw online).\n\nHere's how it measured:\n\nFirst, the dj wasn't a girl. Okay, they said all women dj's so I expect nothing less. However, it was a guy. No big deal, but thought I point it out.\n\nSecond, the cover charge was indeed $2 dollars and there was enough space to dance. There weren't a lot of people there (Thursday night on long weekend), but it was still a sizable crowd. For $2 dollars, it's still a good deal to listen to music and dance the night away.\n\nThird, good dance music. I thought the music was pretty good. It's def. more dance, energy type music and less hip hop and R&B which I like anyways. Many Castro joints are similar in terms of music interest.\n\nFourth, I liked how even though it was women's night, they actually had a good blend between lgbt and straight and also men and women. it was nice to see that diversity and also in terms of ethnic background.\n\nFifth, it was very easy to find parking and since it's late at night it was free. I literally parked on sidewalk 1/2 block from it. It is also near residential so it's pretty easy (minus pride weekend) to find parking.\n\nSixth, for what it's worth, the bathroom wasn't that bad. Def. better and cleaner than the Cafe and some of the other clubs I've been to in the city.\n\nSeventh, for smokers, they have a cool outdoor small patio ish area that extends on the trims of the building (2nd floor). It's nice to let the smokers do their thing and to have that separation versus at the Cafe it's a smoker's room, but right in the middle of the dance action.\nA couple things on why I think it can be better:\n\n1. Cheaper drinkers- no drink specials and it was $9 + tip for one. I don't mind, but they should do some specials last night.\n\n2. It would have been nice if they served a little bit of food.\n\n3. Would have been nice with more people.\n\nWill def. go again because of the low entry price and decent music and will def. review it again on yelp.", "author": "Tina C."}

Don't get me wrong, there are some great bartenders at this place. But there are also a decent amount of lackluster bartenders at this place. No energy. So unhappy to be there. If you don't like your job, then why are you still there.\n\nThis one bartender in particular, who I later found out is the \"general manager\" there, is the worse. He sits and talks to friends as if there isn't another soul in bar. And when he finally takes time out of his personal life to take my order he deliberately makes it wrong. On numerous occassions, I've asked him for a Kettle One and Soda, but what does he pour into my glass?? Well vodka!! and still has the nerve to charge me Kettle One price! Who does that? Does he not see me watching him make my drink? or does he just not care? And when I've confronted him in the past, he either pretends as if he did make it with Kettle One, or rolls his eyes before making me the correct drink. You would think the \"general manager\", I think his name is Gregg, would have a stronger work ethic than that.\n\nIt sucks to have numerous Sunday afternoons at Lookout spoiled by a few bad apples within the company.  I've been to numerous places in the Castro and always had pleasant experiences with staff, even when its busy and things can get stressful for bartenders. Take a note or two from Cafe, Trigger, and Q bar. I always have more than pleasant experiences at these places, no matter if there are 3 or 300 people inside.

I'm not trashing Madonna or what they played but please don't false advertise and then play dance music because if I wanted to hear Gaga, I would rather go to Badlands.  The closest it ever come to indie of MGMT, i guess.

All that cranberry makes me bloat. \nAlso, the bar in the center of the space is the most ridiculous waste of space. It needs to be tucked back against the windowless wall at the back so that barbacks can directly access supplies without having to plow through the crowd. One big open space that opens onto the balconies would make this venue much more interesting for drag shows and fundraisers.

They dont serve pitchers and they don't like to joke with the customer in any way, shape or form.  The music was good cuz it was techno, but if I hafto hear another lil wayne or rhianna song again on the radio I'm gonna kill someone. (My ears have feelings too! ESPECIALLY AT WORK WHEN IT'S THE SAME SONG ON AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN...i recently put it on the spanish station because of it...thanks lil wayne..thanks rhianna..for making me learn spanish!)  it's not because it's rap, because I am a huge rap fan..big pun, cuban link, biggie, big l, nas, jay-z's kinda whack now but still better than lil greesy and marijuana-rhianna.  anyway back to the review.  basically this was my second time in the gay district (you can read my review on sparky's diner if you think i hate gays..) and it was the most dry and arrogant surroundings ever.  there were two girls who kissed which was pretty cool.  that doesnt' happen too often.  but look..the definition of a bar is a place to go to let it out and have a good time.  I was not able to let it out and I didn't have a good time.  I'm never going to a gay bar again.  Thanks you homosexuals...you've ruined gay bars for me forever.  For all of you planning to goto this bar, make sure you're not straight and make sure you're dry and arrogant because thats what you'll expect to see here.  this place gets 10 to the 100th power thumbs down.", "author": "Jack N."}

I am SO happy that I decided to try their pizza instead of sticking with my normal bar meal of nachos (I fell back into old habits on another visit and they are also delicious) It was the BEST pizza I've had since leaving Chicago. The only bad part is having to decide between the super yummy thin crust or the equally good thick crust. I would recommend going with a large enough group so you can order both =). All the ingredients taste fresh, especially the tomato sauce, which has a great flavor and has real chunks of tomatoes. The best part is there are so many options - perfect for me, who is notorious for placing difficult orders and customizing everything.", "author": "Julia B."}

Thank goddess, good pizza has made it's way to the Castro!  Enough with greasy slices on paper plates; this is the real thing.  Deep dish (I had the chicken club last night....delicious!) pizza covered in lots of sauce.  The magic is in the sauce for me; I'm one of those \"easy on the cheese--heavy on the sauce\" kind of guys.  Many pizza sauces are too sweet for me, though.  This one is a little spicy and super yummy.  That said, I was surprised to find that the thin crust pizza is even better than the chicago style.  And then there's the s'more pizza...do not attempt to eat it alone.  So they've got the food down pat, but the bar's gin selection is anemic.  Can't a guy get a top-shelf gin in the castro?  Perhaps some of the other neighborhood bars have a better selection; I wouldn't know, I usually make a u-turn about 5 paces past the doorman.  The Lookout is spacious, equipped with a wrap-around smokers balcony, and staffed by a collection of heavy-handed, sexy bartenders.  We were able to gather a group of 12-15 friends comfortably, without stepping on each other's toes all night.", "author": "Major M."}

The thin crust Quatro Formaggio pizza was awesome, our cocktails were super, and it's not too expensive.  Great place to relax and people watch.", "author": "Katherine G."}

After eating the pizza, I can see why.  I love pizza and will definitely be making a return visit, maybe as one of the places on my birthday.   If they start having root beer as one of the sodas, they'll get another star.", "author": "Cornelius M."}

But these guys (who are also awfully cute!) got something worth checking out.  I've now had both the thin crust and the deep dish versions, both delicious.  And watch out for the nachos - chips are made fresh which makes them impossible to pass up.  The Lookout is a great spot to meet up with a crowd of friends for drinks and snacks.  Great location, fantastic balcony.", "author": "D J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-23", "description": "The new pizza restaurant is the best addition to the Lookout bar. Prepared with hearty yeast crust and garden fresh ingredients, pizza is upgraded to casual gourmet without being pretentious. Comes in personal size portions that are still ample enough to share with someone else if you're looking for a tasty tummy-satisfying appetizer. I definitely recommend the 4 cheese pizza where you can actually taste the uniquely fresh flavors of all 4 cheeses. A great blend of subtle salty, sharp and tangy flavors. Would also love to see this particular pizza complemented with a honey wheat crust. Cute and very friendly bartenders make it a nice place to just have some lowkey cocktails with friends and enjoy the food. They've been developing some unique signature drinks which are worth trying too. Hopefully with some warmer redecorating down the road, they'll make the Lookout a cozier and more fun place to spend a social evening or kickback weekend afternoon.", "author": "Tom A."}
