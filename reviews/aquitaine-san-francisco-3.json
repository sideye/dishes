I was disappointed by the small quantity of meat (duck and pastrami) compared to bread: only two thin slices of flavorless beef pastrami with a small layer of duck on this sandwich for $17. It was dressed weakly (probably intentional so you don't lose the duck flavor from the small portions). The buttered bread was great, but what a disappointment overall. I'd skip this if you are a sandwich nut.\n\nHappy hour is decent. Deviled eggs are great and they have yummy leek crunchies on top. Cheese selection seemed ok and was $7 per portion. Glasses of wine start at $9. Staff was generally nice, but overly busy during lunch.", "author": "Billy D."}

With a tiny storefront and a very deep bay. it is east to blow past.  We had found the restaurant on Yelp and had made reservations for lunch, so we were actively seeking it.  Otherwise, I would have missed it.\n\nThe restaurant has a very provencal feel - it is yellow (with yellow lights too that are just terrible for those Instagram shots IMHO) with mostly communal tables that have the classic French bistro look.  While we had reservations and expected to have a low table for just our party, it was more of a reservation at any table that happened to be available (surprising when you have five people).\n\nThe wine list is generous with many choices.  Fortunately, the servers are knowledgeable and forgiving.  The first wine that had was self selected and was absolutely wretched.  Our server asked what I liked and he found me a quick replacement.  The other wines selected by friends were done with guidance and these as well as my replacement were all quite good.  It is fun and different to find French wine in the land of California wine.\n\nThe food was generally very good.  The salmon special was not - the fish was very poor quality and lacking in any flavor.  However, the other dishes, from a classic Croque Monsieur to an inventive Duck Reuben, were excellent.  I had the Ratatouille special, which was an exquisite presentation.  Arranged veggies with a low and slow sauce are oh so expensive, but these were out of this world.  I devoured the ring of grilled veggies (tomatoes, yellow squash, zucchini and eggplant) encircling a roasted peppers and tomato pieperade.  Twas delicious and worth a return trip.  Similarly, the sandwiches used quality ingredients - hearty bread with good meats and cheeses.\n\nOverall, I very much enjoyed my meal.  I felt sorry for DM who had gotten stuck with the poor salmon that was edible but lacking, and I was disappointed by the communal set-up, but I was a fan and would recommend it to others.", "author": "Stephanie B."}

The duck confit they use here is soooo flavorful.\n- Poulet Croustillant - this fried chicken was amazing.

They come in a dutch clog which is of course super fun, but the real fun begins when you dip them in the Sauce Ravigote. I had to look this up after eating here because I was obsessed - turns out its a french sauce filled with capers, herbs, and of course - mayo. YUM!\n\nI must say, the French just know how to serve up amazing eats. Our group thoroughly enjoyed every bite, and sip (because we did get a nice glass of wine to pair with the meal).

We went here this past week for lunch with a group of 6. My colleague had called in advance to setup a reservation, and we were ready to be seated upon our arrival - no waiting at all....score! \n\nWe decided to share a variety of items off of the menu rather than ordering separate dishes per person. It was a great idea, as we were all able to sample a little bit of everything on the menu. We ordered the following items:\n\n1. Charcuterie - Seems pretty basic, and I normally don't like ordering this at restaurants especially since this is the only thing I can probably do at home without messing it up! To my surprise they had some interesting options on the charcuterie board. There was a cheese which seemed like a crossover between feta and brie which was so delicious! \n\n2. Pomme Frites - The fries came in a dutch type of shoe, which was odd, but somehow adorable. Fries are another favorite thing of mine to eat - I couldn't get myself to stop eating these fries! \n\n3. Aquitane Burger - The burger was cooked really well. There was a ton of caramelized onions on the burger, which is a plus in my book! \n\n4. Duck Reuben - I've grown to love duck within the past few years, and was super excited to be trying this. It was delicious!\n\n5. Fried Chicken - Definitely my favorite dish from everything that I had tried on the menu. The chicken was so moist on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside. \n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was great! It almost felt like I was at a cute cafe in Europe, which I just absolutely adore! The waiter was so incredibly great to us throughout the course of our time there.

The reason is because of the excellent service but slightly disappointing food. Some friends were in town, and I was naturally tasked with finding a restaurant for dinner and making reservations. Wanting to try out a new place, I decided on Aquitaine. There's an old, European feel to the place when walking in. Wine bottles line the walls, and the lights are dim. Good way to escape the ghost town of the Financial District on a weekend evening.\n\nOur waiter was fantastic with a wine recommendation, and he was attentive all evening. The chef was wonderful too, providing a complimentary shoe of fries, which we were erring on the side of not ordering. They were good! A little thinner and more cooked than I would have liked, but it was a sweet gesture. Overall there was such a comfy and welcoming feel. \n\nHowever, we were here for good food, and I felt that the duck dish that I ordered could have used a little more flavor on the meat. The vegetables that accompanied were similarly dull. Looking at more photos of the food here, it seems like the duck reuben sandwich is a popular option for a weekday lunch. I would love to try that in the future! It also seems like a low key place to have a few glasses of wine while enjoying a charcuterie platter.\n\nHonestly the branding and colors of the awning have always turned me off to wanting to walk into this restaurant as I pass by, but I must say that I was impressed by the service of all the Aquitaine, and while I'm not interested in dining here for the food again, I would certainly love to stop by for their happy hour menu.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I love the charcuterie plate and pomme frites!\n\nOur waiter got scolded at for not coming around to see if we are ready for the main courses that we ordered up.  It was uncomfortable to see, but I'm guessing it may be the French way of doing things?  We thought we were forgotten and by the time we finished our appetizers, we were too stuffed for the entrees.

I love a good session but let's be honest, it's Thursday, you still have to return to work level headed the next day. After walking away from my 1st choice due to aforementioned, my friend and I looked to Yelp (thank you!) and found this lovely  bistro nestled in the heart of bustling downtown.\n\nStill filled with thirsters, the scene was definitely less boisterous and cramped. Seated at a small table for two near the window we ordered the 3 cheese charcuterie; Blue Cheese, Manchego and Brie. All excellent choices. The brie was one of the better selections I have had in a while! Along with the cheese came crisped bread drizzled with honey, honey covered grapes and some sort of hard nuts. I would have enjoyed some cornichons, but that's alright. The fresh bread was soft and delicious. \n\nWhile my friend enjoyed a glass of red, I opted for the cocktail of the day; Madam Eleanor. She was divine! Kava, Stawberry, Mint and Lillet Blanc. Apparently there are other ingredients but the barman was not at liberty to share.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-27", "description": "Aquitaine is a dimly-lit, friendly and romanticized restaurant in the middle of the financial district. The decor reminded me of Europe. They have a medium sized selection on their food menu but a large selection of wine. The servers were attentive and were willing to answer any questions. I did feel a bit rushed due to multiple waiters hovering over our table. But nonetheless, here is what we had for the evening:\n\n1. Mussels Carbonade ($15) with Bacon, Cream, Pyrenees Cheese, Apples, Tartine\nAmazing! It came in a huge pot that tasted extremely fresh with some bacon and sauce that unfortunately sunk to the bottom. So make sure to stir it up when you order this! They even put the bread inside so when they open up the pot, the bread is steaming and ready to be dipped!\n\n2. Octopus ($15) with Warm Marble Potatoes, Fennel, Arugula, Pimenton Oil\nThe octopus was on the bottom of the plate when it was served to us (as you can see in the picture) But once we dug around, we were able to find the juicy steamed octopus! It was paired really well with the salad that comes along with the dish.\n\n3. Blanquette De Porc ($26) Belly/Shoulder, Pearl Onion, Mushroom, Rice Pilaf\nThis plate came with a large portion of rice in the center with less of a portion of the belly and shoulder around it. But, the meat was very tender and juicy! I was able to slice through the meat like slicing through room temperature butter. \n\n4. Salmon ($26) French Lentils, Braised Leeks, Grapes, Beurre Rouge\nWe asked for the salmon to be cooked medium-rare but it came a little overcooked. The skin itself was crispy and salted well. If I were to come here again I wouldn't order this again though.\n\n5. Tempura Brussel Sprouts ($9) Bacon Lardons, Sherry Vinaigrette\nThis wasn't something we initially wanted to order, but the waiter said that this dish pairs nicely with the belly/shoulder which I hate to disagree with. I think it was his selling point to have us try more on their menu, but I am thankful! The brussel sprouts were quite hard. I wished that it had been steamed a little longer before being put in the deep frier.\n\n6. Red Ale ($8)\nI'm a fan of ale. This one particularly had a chocolatey coffee taste. It was very bold and went well with the dinner. I know Aquitaine specializes in their wine, so I will definitely give it a try in the future. Oh! They do a 30% off bottles of wine if you take it to go!\n\nI feel like this might be one of the best restaurants I've had so far in the financial district. Price-wise, it is about the same as any other in the area. But the belly/shoulder really blew me away. I feel like Aquitaine understands the art of food and seasoning and I appreciated dining there very much.", "author": "Linda K."}

I had reservations for 6:30 p.m. We arrived a little early but were seated immediately. The atmosphere is very pleasant and definitely reminiscent of the bistros in Paris...simple, elegant decor with a sort of je ne sais quoi quality to it.  \n\nOur waiter was very attentive (maybe a little too attentive). We started off with a couple glasses of wine (as if that needed to be mentioned) and a fromage plate with three selections of very French cheeses (you can tell by the slight ammonia aftertaste!). This is certainly not a bad thing if it is not overpowering but it is definitely an acquired taste. However, it seems that they have a wide selections of cheeses so if you prefer something more mild, I'm sure they can accommodate. \n\nFor entrees, my friend had the salmon and I had the diver scallops. While the scallops were cooked and presented beautifully, I had a slight issue with it being presented on a bed of kelp. The smell of the kelp overwhelmed the other flavors in the dish and brought me a little too close to the ocean. I think the idea of the kelp is better in theory than in execution. Perhaps a more neutral-scented/flavored accompaniment might be a little more appropriate. That being said, the inclusion of diced watermelon and melon was certainly a refreshing take.\n\nOverall, this is a great place to bring a date. It is casual but romantic and I will probably be coming back one day to try their duck!", "author": "Joan S."}

Both not only look Parisian but feel Parisian, places you could envision on a side alley on the Left Bank in Montparnasse (photo: http://bit.ly/1SkXiCv). My good friend Carlos was in town and available for lunch on a Thursday, so I suggested it since it was close to my work even though I had never been. It's right near another pricier French restaurant Gaspar, which I'm sure doesn't help matters much for Aquitaine since San Franciscans, especially FiDi workers, are more into their burritos than their cassoulet.\n\nAlas, it holds up pretty well if you want more French country-style fare. We started with their most expensive appetizer, the $22 Charcuterie, a wide-ranging tray of cured meat preparations and duck mousse with cornichons and Pommery mustard (photo: http://bit.ly/1OZCKvf). I rarely order such decidedly Gallic gourmet food, but it was easy for Carlos and me to share and it was quite good and filling, especially the richness of the duck which was complemented nicely by the generous basket of rustic French bread (photo: http://bit.ly/1PO8aIq). Carlos was smart to order the $15 Croque Tartine with Egg (photo: http://bit.ly/1nGxkN1). You can leave out the egg for $2 less.\n\nIt was an open faced ham and cheese sandwich but with French ham and Emmental cheese, a subtle yet savory Swiss cheese. The fried egg was nestled on top, and it was accompanied by a pile of mixed greens lightly dressed in a vinaigrette. For an extra $6, we ordered quite a pile of Pommes Frites, a bit too heavily crisped with aioli served in a wooden Dutch shoe (photo: http://bit.ly/1QAKDb1). I was a bit too ambitious in ordering the $22 Cassoulet, which was a hefty clay bowl of duck confit, Toulouse and garlic sausage, and white beans (photo: http://bit.ly/1UAG81e). It was steaming hot and bubbling over, too much even for me at lunchtime. You can definitely mang\u00e9 until you're stuffed here if that is what you crave, mes amis.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...satisfying French fare, more peasant-oriented than Gaspar\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit crowded and loud but very much Paris in spirit\nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendlier than Paris\nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice to have this option even with Gaspar Brasserie and Cafe Claude close by", "author": "Ed U."}

If you're vegetarian you'll be left largely with just side options. The fries served in a clog shoe are fun but I'm not gonna come back to a place to eat out of a shoe. \n\nOur server was over-the-top with trying to up-sell. I think he was used to tourists who ask, 'what's good?', so he can recommend higher price-point dishes and multiple bottles of wine when they were not necessary. And I get that he wants us to tab up but this was more of a strong-arm situation than taking our order and made all of us uncomfortable enough that his incessant antics became the number one talking point at our table, which is rarely a good sign.\n\nIf I had to come back I'd get the polenta and fries but I don't anticipate returning because the dishes weren't stand outs enough to want to subject myself to what felt like my own server pan-handling at my table.", "author": "Candice G."}

Especially when just reading the profile on Yelp.  \nGiven the crazy SF real estate and business costs, there are more bars than restaurants opening these days.  The demographic changed from local families or professionals to a younger party crowd that parties like it's 1999 every night... guess it should be 2099 now!\nAfter searching on Yelp or a lunch meeting spot convenient from Union Square, Fidi, and Chinatown, this was my choice on a recent weekday.  Turned out, both of my guests dined here before and were familiar.  Reading the Yelp highlight section, I ordered a the deviled eggs to share which coincidentally came in threes.  Everyone enjoyed this as they disappeared in less than a minute as we discussed business.  One diner raved about their duck cassoulet, but they had only one order left.  The other guest had a burger which looked delicious.  Wanting the cassoulet, I deferred to my guest and chose the waiter/owner's (?) special recommendation of the halibut with polenta (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kCxmDJxHpcd5LjxDbIIL-A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  Not being a polenta fan, I was skeptical whether I'd enjoy this.  This fish was deliciously grilled, crispy outside while soft and tender inside.  The big surprise was the polenta cakes which reminded me of crispy tater tots or hash browns that were creamy inside.  My friend's burger looked good, but nothing that really stood out.  The cassoulet portion was generous and that friend took leftovers home.\nI must admit that this place was not what I envisioned.  It is a bit more casual, almost bordering on a cafeteria feel, than expected.  The food was solid and props to the guy who steered me to that halibut.  \nIt's a bit of a walk from my workplace in Chinatown, but would stop in and hopefully get a bite of that cassoulet next time.", "author": "Mike C."}

It was about 7:30pm and all the restaurants in Belden Alley were either packed or looked uninviting. So Aquitane looked about as good as anything in the neighborhood. And best of all, it was open and not too crowded.\n\nOur famished group of 5 was immediately seated at a nice round table (which is perfect for everyone to see and chat with one another). So everything was off to a promising start! But then our server greeted us, and then that's when things started to go down hill. \nBefore we could even look at our menu, he immediately tried to sell us on a bottle of wine. When my co-worker mentioned that she was interested in drinking a red, he replied \"So a bottle then? How many bottles for the table?\" Whoa whoa whoa - slow down there, Speed Racer. No one said anything about bottles. I decided to order a glass of bubbles. Once again, the server asked if I'd like to order a bottle. In fact, it wasn't so much asking as it was automatically assuming. We then all put in our food orders. We were a very simple bunch this night. 4 burgers, an order of frites, and a side of polenta. The waiter didn't really hide his disappointment with our simple order. It was like you could see him calculating in his head how little money he was going to make off our table. When we all finished placing our orders, the guy then said \"So shall I start you off with the cheese platter?\" Again, not really asking, but inferring that this what we should be doing. We politely declined. \"Ok, then how about an order or two of Deviled Eggs?\"\n\nI finally had enough of the hard sell and spoke up. \"Excuse me, could you please just accept our order and stop up-selling us? We just want our burgers and wine. That's it.\"\n\nThe server seemed to get the hint and went off to the kitchen. 20 minutes later, we got our food. It was fine. I've definitely had better hamburgers. There was nothing exciting going on with this burger to warrant the $16 price. Furthermore, the hamburger bun was over-toasted (to the point where it was just crunchy bread). And the fries that accompanied the dish were quite limp. They could've used a few more minutes in the fryer. Though I did enjoy the dipping sauce that came with them.\n\nAll in all, this was a decent meal... but nothing to write home about. And the pushy waiter really tarnished the enjoyment of our dining experience. We came here for dinner, and not to buy a time-share. I guess the best way to sum it up is that they treated us like we were tourists who just didn't know any better.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Honestly, the fries and sauce that came with it are good, and would order again if I happened to be at the restaurant, but nothing that I would make a special trip for. The fries were different sizes - some were much thicker than the rest so some of them nice and thick cut fries that were somewhat crunchy on the outside and definitely soft on the inside. Others were thinner and too crunchy for me. I just wish there was a bit of uniformity. \n\nOverall, I really just had one dish here, so I can't really tell you what else is good or not.

Two different types of sliced salamis and one brie-like cheese and a harder cheese. Big slices of crusty bread. Accoutrements of bruleed grapes, whole grain mustard, and some type of brittle. I thought the brittle was interesting because I've never seen brittle in a charcuterie board before. The brittle wasn't overly sweet and I suspect that balsamic vinegar was used in it's creation.

Friends, this is why I drink beer. \n\nI don't know what this kind of pretension accomplishes. Perhaps Aquitaine is the Abercrombie of wine bars and doesn't want any wine drinkers over a metaphorical Size 6. Or maybe that guy has to deal with people lacking wine knowledge all day long. Maybe his family was killed in a wine vineyard in the South of France. \n\nDespite this pretentious first impression, I have been back a few times since, and I've had a good time. Their menu has vastly improved since it first opened (it was pretty duck-laden at first). I like the small plates-everyone I know likes the deviled eggs, they have a really nice kick of spicy mustard. \n\nI've had a Rose and a few white wines here I've liked.

Have a glass of wine and revel in the thought of taking a jet plane to Paris. If you can't make that happen, Aquitaine is good for a quick respite.\n\nWalking in, I was a bit shocked that I was in SF.* Being so close to the Financial District, I was surprised to discover such a laid back, European vibe. People didn't seem to be in a hurry. Wine was freely flowing at lunch time and I observed people in the act of prolonged conversation, not hurried scarfing of food. I can get down with this. Our waiter came to the table and asked what wine we wanted. Well, don't mind if I do. I can get used to this kind of living. Not wanting to go too rogue (I was on a work trip and had some newer hires with me. Drinking to the point of sobbing might not be a good look), I decided on a negrette rose and I was off the the Euro races.\n\nSince I was going all in to my French experience, I decided to speak in Franglais, mangle my 'ouis' with 'sis' (living in Miami confused my French) and each all things decadent and heavy-ish. I chose a cod salad to start with. It was a pleasant surprise. Big pieces of breaded/fried cod sat atop a mound of lightly-dressed greens, tomatoes, herbs, olives, and artichokes. Not only was it a wonderful way in which to start my meal, I felt quite fancy eating it. Since I was going for 'light-ish', my main was a sandwich (salad and sandwich is a respectable lunch). But because I was enjoying from French decadence, said sandwich was a duck confit reuben. I'm not a fan of the typical reuben but add duck confit to most anything and I'll eat it. The sandwich was no different. It was sinful in its excess. The duck confit melted in my mouth. Topped with remoulade and pickled onions, every bite was an ode to joy. The pastrami and swiss - while stalwarts of the reuben - seemed to get in the way of the awesomeness of the sandwich.

I grew up in the South so this makes me very particular about deviled eggs I guess.\n\nFor entr\u00e9es four of our group ordered the lamb for two (house specialty), two ordered the divers scallops, one the duck confit, and one the steak.  This was after much dithering!  We all ended up tasting all the dishes so I can report my thoughts:\n\n1.  Lamb - totally delicious!  Comes with a polenta with ratatouille that is to die for, and the sauce too.\n\n2.  Ditto for the steak.  The green peppercorn sauce was very \"Peppery.\"  The steak was tender and I ate all the potatoes (well, my brother is supposedly low carb, right?)\n\n3.  Divers scallops - mixed feelings.  My Mom did not really like hers, but she did eat one whole \"shell\" and all 3 scallops.  They come in three large shells that have the scallop on the end and the melon mix in the shell.  It is kind of like a salad.  The whole thing is served on kelp which some of us tried nibbling on.  I liked mine a lot (scallop dish, not the kelp).  Maybe Mom was just stuffed on the mussels . . . .?\n\n4.  Duck confit - two pieces of duck with a delicious sauce and large beans and mushrooms.  I would order this one next time.  My tastes of hubby's dish were very tantalizing.\n\nThe service throughout the meal was very attentive and helpful.\n\nAlthough we were too full for dessert we did order the \u00eele flottant, the chocolate molten cake, and the peach dish.  I tried the first two and they were divine.  Maybe the best one was my husband's cheese plate.  For $8 he got a choice of one cheese, walnut brittle, a thin biscuit with honey, and grapes.  It was really, really good.  The waiter had us try two dessert wines, one a pinkish one that I loved, and another red one that was the general fave.\n\nMerci beaucoup Aquitaine pour un d\u00eener assez merveilleux!  It was a great place for a French-Canadian rendezvous!", "author": "Michele H."}

You can easily get a table for a late dinner...I went about 9pm there were only 2-3 other tables filled.  The food is delicious and they happily made some changes to accommodate my dietary needs. Not only were the wines by the glass unique and well priced but they really wanted to make sure the wines worked with what we were eating; they allowed me to try a few before I made a selection that I was quite happy with.  They also have an interesting space downstairs that you can rent out for small gatherings.  This is a rare place: friendly staff, warm decor, amazing food and great wine.

Very cozy and cute inside - lots of two tops, candles lit on every table. I thought I'd have one glass of wine and an appetizer (they have a charcuterie board and salads or side dishes that look good). Instead I had the flatiron steak and an order of pomme frites. The steak was perfectly cooked to order (I asked for medium and I got medium - yay!) with lots of roasted, tender carrots, parsnips and onions. I'd come back and order that again. Fries were too big in the order for me to eat but they were served hot and crispy in a Dutch wodden shoe. They paired nicely with the steak - maybe next time I'll ask for a half order of fries as I couldn't eat the whole shoe of them on my own. Excellent service - all male and friendly. And the wines by the glass list is long and well-priced. You'll find something you like for under $18 per glass, which doesn't happen often in this neighborhood. Casual, lively, warm and they make you feel like a welcome local. Definitely check this place out if you're feeling French after a long day at work or shopping!", "author": "Sonya S."}

When a table did open up, our other friends told us that they were going to be late. We thought that was an issue, but the waiter/hostess was OK with seating us anyway -- that was a pleasant surprise.\n\nIt was the personality of the waiters was robotic.\n1) The waiters would pour our wine into our glasses and B-line it to the next table even though we had requests or wanted to order things. This was done several times and the waiter even noticed that he had walked away during the middle of my request because he walked back after serving another table. \n2) The waiter took my glass with my extra wine without me noticing. Did he/she take the rest of my wine away or did he/she pour it into my glass? I'll never know.\n\nFOOD---\nThe mussels ($14) were tasty and came with the amount one would expect. It was a wine and tomato based sauce though, so take note. \n\nThe polenta with mushrooms ($16) was delicious, however, I'm not certain I would pay that much for polenta with the way it was cooked and presented.\n\nThe lollipop chicken ($17) was disappointing and a bit gimmicky.

It's as good or a better price than you'll find elsewhere for harder to find French wines.\n\nAnd be sure to stop downstairs and check out \"La Cave\" - if you have a large dinner party or want a place to yourself you can reserve it, and it's a wonderful private atmospheric place.\n\nThe food is just incredible... if you have a friend who likes lamb, get the 2-person lamb shank dinner entree, it's the best lamb I've had in a while. Other favorites are the cassoulet, and some of the best moules frites around.", "author": "Arshad T."}

I made a reservation at another restaurant for dinner on Friday night and then was told by one of my girlfriends on the same day that it's located in a very unsafe area that we need to find something else. And seemed like they want to eat somewhere in Union Square,  so I found here in last minute and successfully made reservation for three. I thought I did a smart move and saved our Friday girls night out. \n\nWhen I got there I saw very few people inside, which was not a good sign. Anyway, the waiter(only one who was working there I think, plus bar tender) looked friendly, so it wasn't too bad. I got the steak and my friend got duck comfit. Appetizer bread was warm and the butter was soft too. It seemed that it's a good start. \nSo I got my steak. I asked for medium rare and i think it's more on the rare side. But that's not a big problem. They sliced the steak, and put it on top of two potato skin with mashed potato ground beef filling. And the steak was bland and relative cold. The worst thing was overall flavor, extremely sour!!!! I was starving, but I still found it's very unpleasant to swallow the food. I haven't had anything like this for a while and was super disappointed. And my friend who got duck comfit, said the same thing the sauce was very sour. It was such a disappointment night that we had to go somewhere else to get desert after the dinner. \n\nI gave it two stars because the service was not super bad and online reservation was quite smooth. And I read other reviews, seems like it's mixed. And some people did get good food there. I don't know whether they changed chef that night, because I couldn't see any positive from my dish.", "author": "Pink M."}

Obviously French varietals but I do want to say there are some Spanish wines too (maybe it's Basque?) and what's on the menu is always available.\n\n- Decor and vibe: Dark woods, darker lighting. A bit of traditional French bistro with some rustic elements for accents. Wine cork lined bar. Music has chill vibes, usually downtempo and/or bossa nova. Of the many times I've been here, I've only seen it packed to the brim once-- during that time, it got a little noisy but hey, I stayed. I usually stay at the bar (well, it's closest to the wine...), but if you have a bigger party, there's always the semi-secret/unknown downstairs which would be a great place if you wanted to pull of a private party/gathering/work meeting.\n\n- Staff: High knowledge of all those interesting wines and willing to share it if you ask. Ability to distinguish and offer wine offerings based on customer preferences. Also friendly, jovial, and attentive (but not overly so like in a stuffy restaurant).\n\n- Food: can't say with much about entrees because I've never stayed for dinner, but there's a roast duck dish that comes out sizzling that I've always wanted to try.  Typically, I go there for happy hour, so the fries and mussels are solid, as is their excellent flash fried eggplant with celery/mint/plum sauce. Consistent.\n\n-Value: For happy hour, they have a good deal for by-the-glass wine (I believe 2$ off), and most of the glasses end up being 5-10$. Quite obviously, even without the happy hour discount-- that is a top-notch deal in the FiDi.", "author": "Arexaurus R."}

The restaurant had only three others at the bar, none of which were eating food. Its not like he was slammed and forgot my bread. I went back. I work in a kitchen myself so I know all too well the ins and outs of a lazy day-shift cook. I waltzed to the end of the bar which is by the kitchen and handed the cook my to-go box with the burnt bread showing.\n\n \"Do you always serve burnt bread?\" I said to him. \nHe responded with, \"Oh shit, I didn't see that! Sorry!\" \n\nOf course you didn't, you just put mayo on that side with your EYES CLOSED.\n\nI sat at the bar and the waitress noticed I was back. I told her I was served burnt bread and that it was all good because the cook was re-making it. She kindly offered me a drink on the house. \n\nAll in all, that burnt bread cost them stars but the replacement and drink comp showed good customer service. I was still disappointed that the cook even allowed that to happen but hopefully I was the last person he served burnt bread because he did not get away with it this time.

I have never been to France and my requirements for wine are \"Does it have alcohol?\" and \"Is it under six bucks?\"\n\nThat being said, I needed to get some work done Christmas Eve, and I was in the area, so I stopped in. They were clearly ready to serve me some fancy wines (of which there are plenty) but I opted for the Konig Pilsner (because I'm on a budget of cheap and hatred) and fries.\n\nWhen I said I wanted \"the fries,\" I got a look like I had just taken off my shoe and began to gnaw on it. Perhaps I should have said \"le fries.\"\n\nFittingly, the fries come in a dutch clog. It's very cute. The fries looked a lot better than they were, but their dipping sauce is delicious. Douse those babies and you got yourself a good time. It's statements like this why I am not considered classy in establishments like Aquitaine. \n\nThe beer was delicious, too. The server came to my table and poured it for me whenever I was getting low. I don't know if he thought I was incapable, but I'm going to pretend that's how they do it in France and he thought a lady like me shouldn't have to pour her own beer. \n\nIt makes sense that my biggest complaint would be about the price of fries. Le fries cost me $8. It was a sizable shoe-full, but eight dollars? A little outrageous for fries served in a clog. It's not like you get to keep the clog or anything.\n\nI should probably go back and try some of their more traditional fare.

Great ambiance. Apparently there's a lower area (downstairs) that is nice but I didn't venture there.\n\nService was slow, but it wasn't a crazy busy night so I'm not sure what was up. Perhaps my waiter was newer. He didn't suggest things I could try, being this was my first visit - just didn't seem to have much of an opinion on the menu. When I tell a waiter it's my first visit, I not so secretly hope that they'll tempt me with everything on the menu that they think rocks. Didn't happen. \n\nDinner menu is divided into lots of small and large plates. Asked my server if what I was ordering (crispy cod) was enough for an entree and he said yes...but also asked if I wanted to start with something like a salad  (which seemed confusing since he implied that my order was sufficient) but when it arrived (quite some time later), it wasn't big enough in the end and I was left feeling like I needed more. I considered a cheese plate but decided to just order a dessert and call it a night. The fish was good, light, crispy, but it didn't strike me as being regional cuisine (and I've been to Aquitaine). Sadly, I'd ordered the plat du jour (polenta with shellfish) but they had run out. That would have probably been closer to regional.\n\nDessert was a pair of Canelle de Bordeaux with some sort of prune compote (?) and a whipped cream infused with yet  more prune. I liked the Canelle, but not the fruit stuff it came with. I think I had a bit of an allergic reaction to something in it so I just scraped off the fruit and focused on the pastry. I know that the region is known for it's prunes, but this was a miss to me. Also, I'm not sure that they should reheat the canelle as they did - they become a bit rubbery when you do this.\n\nI'll definitely be back and give it another try though. I could easily have given this place 5 stars if they ironed out a few things...and would have preferred to have given them 3.5 (rather than 4) but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.", "author": "Linda C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-24", "description": "If you are in a hurry or don't like to read I will sum it up for you - Aquitaine is fantastic, go there!\n\nI had the good fortune to live almost five years in Europe, some of that time living in Paris and traveling throughout France. From this experience I developed an appreciation of French food culture. The French have a fundamental understanding that most of us Americans lack - good food comes from good materials and expert preparation. This is not fast, not easy, and not cheap.  When you consider all the costs and challenges of going into the restaurant business it is remarkable that anyone takes the plunge; especially to bring high quality expertly prepared food to a sometimes unappreciative American audience. Fortunately for all of us Laurent Manrique and Andrew Fidelman have taken that risk and created a wonderful oasis of French cuisine at 175 Sutter Street in San Francisco.\n\nManrique comes from a rural town in the south of France near Toulouse. He is classically trained and a Michelin starred chef. His resume is extensive with projects that span both coasts of the USA. Manrique's partner at Aquitane is Andrew Fidelman, an American, born in Detroit, who became a wine connoisseur and sommelier. Together they form an impressive team.\n\nWhen we arrived at Aquitaine we entered a welcoming bistro style restaurant where the casually dressed diner feels comfortable. This is in keeping with the decor of French country restaurants that serve a local population. We immediately saw the impressive array of wines proudly displayed that gives the impression of having arrived in a great wine cellar. But just wait till you see what comes out of that kitchen. Unbeknownst to us, co-owner Andrew Fidelman would be our waiter.\n\nWe started with the Beet Salad, a sumptuous combination of beets, kale, pear, and walnuts, covered in a thin blanket of smoked duck. For the main course we ordered the Aquitaine signature dish - Braised Lamb Shanks for 2. The meat was so flavorful and fall-off-the-bone tender with an accompanying broth that is its own soup course. Ask for bread. You don't want the broth to go to waste. Andrew Fidelman suggested the Caramelized Eggplant with mint that is a perfect pairing to the lamb. This is French country comfort food at its absolute best. Fidelman selected for us a moderately priced French wine that was a very nice accompaniment to the meal.\n\nEverything was superbly prepared and the portions very ample which unfortunately gave us no room to enjoy the sumptuous selection of deserts. But we didn't mind because we now have a great excuse to go back.\n\nThe bill came to $113 for the two of us, but considering the quality and authenticity of the French cooking is well worth it. Far cheaper than a trip to France, and you still get the real thing!\n\nAnd if you ever happen to be in Paris, visit Le Grappillon restaurant at 32 Rue Tiquetonne in the 3rd arrondissement. That is my other most favorite place in the world for French comfort food.\n\nBut since I won't be going to Paris anytime soon, the Aquitaine absolutely fills my need for that essential taste of France. We are so looking forward to our next visit!", "author": "Christopher H."}

I found it a little strange... maybe they make all their money from food or something. It didn't make me feel super comfortable.\n\nThe wines were good though. I started with an aperitif called Porthos, which was Lillet, white wine, and candied apple slice of some sort. It was very sweet, but also very refreshing. I tried a bit of my friend's white, and was very drinkable and crisp. I later had a Rose called Negrette. It was not very sweet, but had a bit of bite, but was still very, very good.\n\nThey were sometimes slow to respond to us at the bar, and when I was asking for the check.\n\nOverall, decent.", "author": "Michael W."}

But then again it's kind of hard to review the food if they don't serve you at all! We had reservations for 1.15 pm and were seated outside. We were given menus and then left to our own devices. No one appeared so after a good 20 minutes of waiting we walked off.\n\nHave added a star to what should be a 1 star review because in fairness the restaurant called us to apologize and asked us to come back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-26", "description": "Let me start out by saying that I have been here twice, and while the food was good (tapas-style, light dinner, great for sharing) and the ambiance was very nice, I will not come back due to the service.\n\nOn the first occasion, I went with a group of about 6 women for happy hour and dinner.  The only thing that was off during this visit was one of the servers was not very friendly - any time we ordered or asked for anything, he just seemed annoyed.  We had such a good experience the rest of the night, I let that part of the visit go and couldn't wait to return.\n\nAbout a month later, I went back with a group of 4 different friends.  When I got there, the place was pretty empty so I was checking out the different seating options.  I changed my mind twice within the minute the server (the SAME server who seemed rude during visit #1 mind you) was seating me, and I prefaced the second switch with \"sorry to be annoying, but...\" - he replied with \"don't worry, you're like all my customers...\"  GREAT.  When my first friend got there, and ordered the same drink as me (one of the happy hour specials), he rolled his eyes.  The only reason I can think he might have done this is because we were ordering a happy hour special which was less expensive than their other wines; otherwise, I have no idea.\n\nAnother employee at the restaurant, who I recognized to be the manager from my first visit, came to take our food order a while later.  We wanted a cheese plate, and since the menu states \"choose 3 cheeses\" but does not list the options, my friend asks him what the choices are.  He replies, in an incredibly snarky tone, \"you want me to tell you ALL of them?\" and she says \"yes.\"  So he lists them all out quickly, all of them being very french terms which were things most people probably wouldn't know, and didn't even explain what they were.  When we looked at him with blank expressions, he said, \"see, that didn't help did it?\" To which we replied \"no.\"  The result, he picked us out a plate of his choosing.\n\nI'm sad that things didn't turn out that great during my last visit, because I probably would have been a regular at this place.  I just don't like spending my time and money after a hard days' work at a place where I can't be comfortable.  Otherwise, the ambiance is so nice (feels like you're in Paris), and the food/drinks are good.  I just wish the customer service was up to par.", "author": "Gina M."}

I ordered the crispy cod salad - over the top salty.  it has 3 times the dressing it needs and they put a mayo sauce right on the fish on the salad.  The salad became unnecessarily  heavy.  I was not able to finish it.  This should not be categorized as a salad.  The portion of salad was very small to begin with and just drowned in salty sauce.  More greens, less salt and 1/3 the dressing would have saved this dish. Conceptually I appreciated it but taste wise I could not finish it.  The other dishes were over salted as well.  DO NOT OVER SALT, THERE IS NO GOING BACK.  I CAN ALWAYS ADD SALT IF I NEED TO.\n\nThey do not try hard enough.  Comparable restaurants in the vicinity do a much better job in all categories.

I don't know who wrote that list, but it wouldn't make my top 100. Maybe they thought it was novel that it came in a wooden Dutch clog and that clouded their view, but the fries were dry and not very tasty at all. Certainly not worthy of a spot on that list, or any other list for that matter. Hubby and I started with deviled eggs and the beet salad. The deviled eggs are heavy on the mustard and have a bite to them. I kind of liked it, but for some that might not love mustard, that might not sit well. The beet salad was tasty, but drowning in dressing. Hubby got the Bavette steak with Roquefort sauce  and I got the salmon for dinner. My husband said the steak was chewy but he enjoyed his meal overall. I tried one of his smoked potatoes and thought it had a lovely smokiness to it and was one of the tastier things in our meals. My salmon was cooked well but, again, the dish was just swimming in sauce. This time in a butter sauce and I felt like I must have eaten about 1000 calories of butter. After all that butter in my sauce, I couldn't stomach dessert, so we passed on anything else. Overall I would say it was good, but not great.

OH MY GOD!  Best dish I've ever had. We came back the next day for lunch...the onglet steak sandwich and duck confit sandwich...SO GOOD.   This is, sincerely, the best place I've ever eaten.   The chef has a Michelin rating and he is humble and sat next to us to eat.  I can't wait to take my wife there.", "author": "Jesse T."}

I've eaten at a lot of French bistros in the US and in France, and I will not be returning to this one. The food preparation and even the full wine list was disappointing. It would probably be okay if I didn't know how good bistro food tastes. There are so many better options in the area, especially for French bistro food.", "author": "Cathy P."}

Ambience wise it is fabulous and the owner was super friendly when we entered. Having said that, I am disappointed to say (and yes been to france numerous times) that our particular server (blonde lady) was pretty cold/snooty and at one point didn't bring out the wine so another server was kind enough to do that! Not saying we need constant over the top service BUT a smile here and there and warm feeling of wanting to engage with us would be nice. I hope that the  server  warms up  a bit because it really changed my review so I hope the owner does read this! Overall great wines, great foods and a charming piece of france in FIDI. Merci :)", "author": "sue c."}

I enjoy seeking out these types of places that try and bring authentic cuisine to new areas.  Great selection of wines from the southwest of France.  Definately a new experience.  The cassoulette was excellent.", "author": "John S."}

You have to admire any place with roots enough to offer Floc de Gascogne by the glass. Tasty food in a very casual cafe' atmosphere. Good confit and mussels, delicious fresh pea soup and cheesy \"escouton\" (polenta) with roasted tomatoes, extremely addictive seared calamari with lots of parsley, salt and smoked espelette pepper. Fun wine list with lots to discover from Gascogne, Gaillac, Madiran and other parts of SW France.", "author": "C M."}

And off course its never the same stuff again, its always different. Am a caveman ( on the paleo diet wagon ) but I do bing once in a while and when I do it has to be exceptional. So most likely its going to be on 7x7's list. This is what happened recently I felt like french fries and these guys have one of the best I ever tasted. They serve it in a Netherlands's wooden looking shoes , but the best part is the fries , its goooood! But the entree I got did not hot it on the spot. I had high expectations, and off-course it was duck breast because inda place we eating FRENCH! The meat of the duck felt like its reheated ( cooked a week ago ) , very very cold. It wasn't the waiters fault  , because that was the best part of the experience the waiters where very friendly. It was the chef's to have served something like this. I heard they had good duck ruben sandwich , but they serve it only during lunch .Not  if am ever going back to try that.", "author": "Sulaiman B."}
