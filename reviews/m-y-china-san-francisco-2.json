This was the first restaurant we see as soon as we get in to the mall on our way to the movie theater! Some places don't serve XLB did dinner... But this place did.\n\nWarning: if you're new to this whole dumpling thing... Poke it first, let it cool, then slowly eat it... If you don't --it will burn your mouth!! Our juicy dumplings were so hot (temperature wise), I couldn't even lift the handle on the spoon it's resting on. \n\nWe only tried the pork dumplings... It was yummy, but I've had better.\n\nTheir chili sauce had an unusual curry smell/taste to it. It wasn't bad, just a little odd.\n\nAlso.. their dishes are ala carte...

But, everything else (other food and service) was pretty awful.\n\nThe staff / service was pretty awful, took probably 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and the waiter kept asking us what we ordered and barely paid attention to us. The rest of the food was mediocre.\n\nA huge negative was also that the waiter couldn't seem to grasp an understanding of a peanut allergy, and wasn't sure how to check whether there could be or couldn't be cross contamination. I'm shocked that the restaurant doesn't know how to handle orders for allergies - so be wary!\nA slight negative was that after waiting 15 minutes for our drinks, my wine was such a sad, small pour! But, that's how it is sometimes.\n\nOverall, I am being generous in my review solely for the beef noodle soup, which I'd go back for and spend the $17.", "author": "Karen C."}

But I am here to tell you it is good! M Y China is in our Chinese food trio of San Francisco: Yank Sing for Dim Sum; R & G Lounge for Cantonese -- and specifically the Salt & Pepper Crab; and M Y China for the Peking Duck and Scissor Cut Noodles.\n\nWe are not shoppers, but occasionally we need to go to Westfield Mall. Today it was Torneau to get some watch batteries replaced. And what better way to while away an hour than with Martin Yan's perfect Peking Duck. Gloriously lacquered, crispy skin and succulently moist and flavorful meat. We get a half order -- plenty for two. Served with pillowy steamed buns, hoisin, cucumber and julienne of leaks, it is a perfect dish. And we always get the scissor cut wild boar noodles to go with it -- excellent perfectly cooked noddles with a mixture of veg and a nice sauce.\n\nWe can never finish it all, so we order some more buns and garnish and have another meal. M Y China has a very extensive menu, but I don't think we have had anything else. But judging from what we have had, I am sure the rest will be great as well. Always friendly service, never rushed or hovering.", "author": "John C."}

I have always been a fan of this master chef, and have actually met him on two separate occasions. Nice man.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the fourth floor of the upscale Westfield mall. It is a big open air restaurant that is adjacent to the cathedral like dome. It reminded me of the simulated outdoor  restaurants in Vegas. The dining room is large with comfortable seating. There is a full service bar with an ornate iron bell in the center of it.\n\nFor dinner we had the Xiao Long Bao (aka juicy pork and crab dumpling), Salted Egg Yolk Crab, Seven Spice Pork Ribs, and Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles.\n\nI grew up calling Xiao Long Bao \"soup balls\" because of the delicious broth that leaks from the sealed packaging. These were delicious. The noodle wrapper was thin and tender. It didn't distract from the goodness inside.\n\nThe crab dish was the crown jewel of our meal. The market price was north of $50 so it better be good..right? The crab was huge. The crab is dredged in seasoned egg yoke and then fried. This created a spectacular crust. The crab was fantastic although quite messy and an effort to eat.\n\nI thought the Seven Spice Pork Ribs were amazing. The tender ribs had a crispy fried coating. They were seasoned with a dry rub that was spicy and complex. The spices that I recognized were five spice, cumin, curry, hot red pepper, green onion, and cilantro. A bite of the topping alone was an explosion of flavors and a party in my mouth.\n\nThe Wild Boar dish was my least favorite of our choices. The house made noodles were stretched and cut into straw-like pieces. This dish was good, but tasted like a common stir fry that you could find at many Chinese restaurants.\n\nA highlight of our visit was watching one of the chefs carve a squash into an incredible piece of art. You have to see it to believe it.", "author": "Paul C."}

Their happy hour menu offers deals on alcohol (cocktails, wine, and beer) as well as some bites. \n\nI thought the cocktails were a good deal, but both of us were not impressed by the food. I ordered the Spring Rain (rum, lime, blue curacao, cranberry juice) for $8, and liked it so much that I ordered it again. It was such a pretty drink with the cherry garnish and tasted great as well.\n\nFor food, we split the calamari ($7) and the bang bang chicken wings ($7). To be honest, the calamari was the saddest looking calamari I've ever seen. It was incredibly bland and barely crunchy at all. I understand they serve it with side seasonings, but at least add some salt to it! The portion size was tiny as well. The chicken wings were sweet and tasted okay, but I probably wouldn't get it again.\n\nI'd come back here for a chill happy hour when I only want drinks and no food.", "author": "Dianna H."}

They brought out water right away and asked if there was anything else I needed while I waited for my coworker. \n\nBetween the 2 of us, we ordered:\n1. Crispy Organic Tofu (which I loved)\n2.

We both ended up pretty full and didn't have any food left to take home. because it was my coworker's birthday, they gave us sugar egg puffs on the house. Those, were very tasty. I especially like the vanilla cream that was served with it. The food was well seasoned and appeared to be fresh.

I wanted to see if it was any better than my neighborhood joint, which is delicious. I would say this was better because it was more fined in flavor and lighter in batter\n*Peking duck: served lots of skin and fluffy steamed buns. I haven't had great Peking duck out of Asia, this ranks higher than average in the US, but still far from those in Asia\n*Whole Rock Fish: nice fried covered in spicy sauce.

It just lacked flavor! and was really greasy. I have had so many other great noodle dishes here in the past.\n\nAs far as service we sat under the dome and were forgotten at first, though another server stepped in and took care of us and empty water glasses. We really came for the hot and sour soup but questions that we asked about size of bowl and cup were met with shrugs and a hand gesture, so we just ordered cups not wanting two family size portions on the table. Hot and sour soup is not listed or priced on the menu!

If you're a fan of YAN CAN COOK on PBS (my parents used to watch this all the time), I wouldn't set your expectations SUPER high. I feel like this was on par with many other Chinese restaurants I've been to (except the whole time I was there, my friends and I were the only Asian people I saw in the restaurant, everyone else was a white family....) You could probably find food that is just as good at a cheaper Chinese place but the vibes might not be as classy or fusion feeling. I think the mood of the restaurant fit the setting of the celebration I was participating in, but I wouldn't come here for a meal with my family or just casually, because I think I could get a better deal somewhere else. That being said, the food wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't amazing.\n\nLocated in FiDi, it's a really annoying place that a lot of people don't like going to. I recommend taking Bart to Powell and it's a 900 ft walk to get to the mall, then take the escalators up to the 4th floor to find the restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant has a cute outside area that you can get happy hour drinks and small bites if you're waiting for your reservation (or scare your friend if he's sitting with his back away from the restaurant). \n\nWhen a few more people form our huge party came, they sat us in this area in front of the kitchen (where it was very hot actually) while we ordered happy hour drinks. I got the buddha breeze, which was very tasty and probably my favorite thing I consumed that entire night.\n\nOur party of 20+ slit up into a few tables, so I shared the following with 3 other people:\n- wok seared beef (on top of arugula, this was VERY good - probably the only thing I thought was really worth ordering actually)\n- yang zhou fried rice (straightforward, what you think fried rice would look and taste like)\n- Black Pepper Glazed Snapper and Tofu (had eggplant that was decent)\n- HK crispy noodle with chicken\n\nThe food was average to me, but it could be because I had higher expectations. I would come again if my friends absolutely wanted to come, but the trouble it takes to get out here from the East Bay, price, and quality of food, I would only give it 3 stars. Also it's unfortunate that their happy hour drinks don't continue on the dinner menu at a more expensive price, because the buddha breeze was really good but is only on the HH menu.\n\nApologies for no pics, was too caught up in the celebration haha. My friend was saying his dad says that Yan Can Cook's appeal is the aesthetic, but that the food might not be amazing, and that is correct.", "author": "Irena S."}

Sold!\n\nHeaded to the Westfield Mall where they are located and was quickly seated.  The restaurant is very nice and upscale for a Chinese restaurant and I just loved the decor.  The bar area was my favorite -- hanging from the ceiling is a large bell which draws you in and is the focal point of all the wines & spirits.  \n\nI was all by myself and had a view of all the cooks preparing dishes in front of me which provided some entertainment.  I ordered the following dishes:\n\nXiao Long Bao (Pork Juicy Dumplings on the menu) - pork steamed soup dumplings\nShiu Mai - pork, shrimp, & morel mushroom \nHar Gow - jumbo shrimp, served with spicy soy sauce\nSugar Egg Puffs - chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream, & raspberry coulis\n\nYes, I ordered all of this just for me.  Guess what?  I ate freaking at it all. Not even kidding.  It was amaaazing.  The xiao long bao's came out steaming hot.  So hot I actually burnt my tongue because I was so excited to try it.  It was good, but wasn't the best I've had.  The shiu mai & har gow were tasty as well.  My favorite of the night had to be the sugar egg puffs though (duh, I love desserts!).  I've never had a dessert quite like it.  It was really messy to eat, but oh so delicious.  I loved breaking it into little pieces and dipping them into all the different sauces.  My favorite was the raspberry coulis.  The vanilla bean chantilly cream could have had a stronger flavor in my opinion, but was still good, especially when paired with the raspberry coulis.  YUM!  \n\nI definitely recommend coming here, especially for happy hour and if you're too lazy to head over to China Town.  It's definitely more pricey, but the atmosphere makes for it.

It is definitely a destination dining experience if you don't mind eating in a mall.  The food court downstairs is fairly eclectic and attracts a large crowd but upstairs M.Y. China and Tap415 are the only two restaurants with seating.  Other restaurants concepts (steakhouse, thai, and pizza) have all failed leaving the Atrium restaurant experience dead.  M.Y. China like any good Chinese restaurant attracts many Asian diners and will still have a line on busy evenings.\n\nBecause of the cavernous mall, the open air restaurant can be loud, but if you are an antsy person you can walk over to the Bose store or Nordstrom's just yards away.\n\nCame here to see a movie which makes this a great pre-movie destination and to celebrate Chinese New Year.

Located on the top floor of the Center, the restaurant has a bar area on the right with a large bell over the bar that was imported from Asia and dining areas in the center and left areas. There are tables in the patio area for those that would like a Under the Dome dining experience.  We opted for an inside center table near the patio which allowed for a view into the mall and view of the open kitchen area.\n\nWe were here for a Gilt City special menu.  Our friendly server, Daniel, explained the menu to us and described each dish as it was brought out.  \n\nLobster and Papaya with young papaya, tomato, thinly slice jalapeno, red onion, mint, cilantro, citrus juice, and fish sauce. The dish had a lobster claw meat and was nicely plated. Though Daniel stated this only had a mild spice, it was medium.  It was at the max of my spice, but it was too spicy for my dining partner.  Suggested to him that the menu should state that this dish is spicy. \n\nSeared scallops with smoked salmon roe, citrus soy vinaigrette. Perfectly seared scallops that was complemented well by the vinaigrette. \n\nMatsutake Soup with chicken, dried scallop, ham and wolfberry.  A full flavored traditional soup, which reminded me of soup that my Mom made. \n\nSpicy Sichaun lamp chop with forbidden rice, crispy noodle, gai lan, Sichuan bean sauce.  Though listed as spicy, the chop had only a hint of spice. The crispy noodles under the chop seemed out of place with this as it falls out of the plate as you're cutting the chop.  The Gai Lan were plain and needed some oil and soy/oyster sauce. The forbidden rice which consisted of red and brown rice and barley was tasty. \n\nSurf and turf - wagyu beef, jasmine tea smoked seabass, yang zhou fried rice, black pepper sauce. This was delicious dish. The honey glazed seabass was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. The beef was tender and tasty with the black pepper sauce. The scoop of yang zhou rice with bbq pork, egg, mushroom and shrimp was good. \n\nMatcha tiramisu in a caramel sugar cloud.  The sugar cloud is made of spun sugar made for a dramatic presentation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-15", "description": "This restaurant definitely feels like a tourist trap, but a nice place to get Chinese food in an upscale, PF Chang's like dining room. If you are a fan of Martin Yan, who for me was the first cooking show personality I can remember watching on TV, then it is worth a trip here too as you can pick up signed copies of his cookbooks here.\n\nAlthough the food is pricey for Chinese (a few bucks more per dish than you would expect in Chinatown), you are paying for the fancyish ambiance and gorgeous presentation of the dishes. For instance, the xiao long bao soup dumplings come in a pretty package: with each dumpling resting in its own Chinese-style soup spoon of an alternating color. The food is Chinese, with some dishes having more of a PF Chang's fusion feel, while others have a more authentic slant. For authentic, I recommend going for the scissor cut boar noodles or the hand-pulled noodles (which are only available in the niu rou tang mian, or beef noodle soup. \n\nGetting seated at the countertop bar facing the open kitchen is a must, because you can watch chefs transform a ball of dough into hundreds of  noodles within minutes. It is a show, seeing them stretch, pull, and twirl the dough like magic. If you have never witnessed this process, then making the trip here is worth it alone just to see noodle making in person.\n\nTip: the restaurant is located on the upper level of the Westfield mall in the heart of San Francisco Union Square/Downtown.", "author": "Peijean T."}

Honestly, I've passed by here many times, but have never actually tried the food until today. My friends and I stopped by here for dinner around 7 PM (no waiting for a table, thank GOODNESS!) For $61, we got the wok-seared seafood, ribs, and forbidden rice. Portions are very reasonable, and the food is absolutely delicious! The only downsides are that the menu isn't 100% authentic, and the dishes are all on the pricier side. Overall, though, I especially loved the seafood. Not too oily, but still flavorful enough on its own or mixed in with a side of rice. My friends also loved the ribs! They were pretty meaty, and there was just the right amount of kick from the spice.

China - Martin Yan's China - was a nice discovery for us.\n\nMy husband and I came to San Francisco for the 2018 Bay to Breakers last weekend. We had eaten way too many times in Chinatown on previous trips to the city. This time, we wanted to try some place new. The manager at Hotel Zelos recommended M.Y. China. \n\nThe manager's recommendation turned out to be a real treat. M.Y. China is located in the vicinity of our hotel near Union Square. The walk from hotel to restaurant is less than 15 minutes. We came here twice in a span of 3 days.\n\nFirst Visit May 19, 2018\n\nThree of us came shortly after 5:00 on Saturday for dinner. There was no line. We were quickly seated at a table just outside the main entrance. The view from our table was amazing. Yes, we were dining on the 4th floor of the busy Westfield San Francisco Centre, but as we pan our surroundings, we didn't get much of the hectic vibes at all.\n\nWe ordered Wok Seared Beef, Grandma's Gai Lan, Steamed Tofu & Portobello and brown rice. \n\n* Wok Seared Beef - Aromatic arugula enhanced the flavors of the the meat. Loved the slightly chewy, yet tender, beef.  \n* Grandma's Gai Lan - Lightly seasoned. Saut\u00e9ed the way my Mom used to. Loved the Chinese sausage.\n* Steamed Tofu & Portobello - Beautiful presentation. Tofu was silky smooth, very fresh. Loved the scallion-ginger sauce \n* Brown Rice - Perfect accompaniment for the dishes. Loved the texture. \n\nSecond Visit Monday, May 21, 2018\n\nWe were initially concerned about the choice of M.Y. China for our lunch for 5 because one of our guests is a vegetarian. But it turned out that there were quite a few dishes that would work. We ordered 6 dishes to share, including 3 vegetarian ones.\n\n* Wok Seared Beef - Tasted just as delicious as Saturday's, but the beef didn't look as appetizing. Presentation a little off.\n* Grandma's Gai Lan - Every bit as good as Saturday's. Fresh gai lan, lean lap cheong. Loved it.\n* Garlic Pea Shoots - Vegetarian. This was a hit. Fresh and tender. Seasoned just right.\n* Eggplant & Tofu Clay Pot - Vegetarian. Loved the flavor of basil and black pepper sauce.\n* Tempeh Sliders (2 orders) - Vegetarian. Nicely garnished with pickled daikon and cilantro.\n* Roasted Chicken - Excellent. Crispy skin, tender meat. Didn't even need the seasoned dipping salt. Easily our favorite for this lunch.\n* Brown Rice - Very good. Nice to find brown rice in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nOur overall impression:\n\n* Food - Excellent, as expected of the renown Chef Martin Yan.\n* Service - Just okay. Saturday server seemed to rush us when there wasn't a crowd waiting to be seated. Service was better on Monday.\n* Price - Reasonable for a good San Francisco restaurant.\n* Location - Convenient. Accessible by public transportation. No need to drive and fight downtown traffic.\n\nIn summary, all 5 of us enjoyed dining here, although there were comments about the dishes showing up lukewarm, not hot. The gai lan, for example, was served already cold. That was disappointing.\n\nIt's a solid 4-Stars for M.Y. China for both of our visits. We'll be here again on our next trip to San Francisco. This time, we'll inquire about the secret Chinese menu mentioned in one of the Yelp reviews. We'll also try the popular Dim Sum Sampler and the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles.\n\nA final note: I don't know what management can do about screaming kid(s), if anything. On Saturday, there was a grandma, mom and a young kid seated at the table cater-cornered to ours. The kid was screaming repeatedly. At one point, she got on top of the table. She  pulled on a plate, dropped and shattered it on the floor. Her screaming became piercing. It was impossible to carry on a normal conversation. A very noisy kid in this fine dining spot wasn't exactly a blow to its nice ambiance, but it almost ruined a great experience for us.", "author": "Luz L."}

Shiu Mai was very good. \n\nShandong Beef Rolls was OK.\n\nBok Choy saut\u00e9ed in garlic was good.\n\nRice Cake with Wild Board was interesting, but also oily.\n\nPork Juicy Dumpling (Xiao Long Bao) was good and served super hot which we enjoyed.\n\nHand pull noodle with beef, green onion, bean sprout was good in texture but too oily, we didn't want to finish them.\n\nBaby chrysanthemum tea is also very good here.\n\nWe were also offered the special Dungeness Crab menu special offers from six regions/province in China. \n\nGUIYANG PROVINCE  - Chili Pepper Crab, onions, shallots, hot pepper sauce. We chose this and it was very good, almost reminded me of Cajun style for some reason. \n\nCHAOZHOU PROVINCE - Dungeness Crab in Black Bean Sauce, garlic, green onion, black pepper. This was quite nice and flavorful. \n\nThe crabs were pricier because it's not really a crab season now in San Francisco. \n\nIt's a convenient spot to eat if you need a break from shopping, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here. Something about dining at the mall doesn't do it for me. And it's definitely not a place for us to go out of our ways to come for dinner nor celebration, unless we are in the area. \n\nNow that Crystal Jade is closing, I'm sure M.Y. China will surely get more business.", "author": "Manda Bear B."}

China when they when they first opened with Chef Martin Yan overlooking the kitchen.  It wouldn't be until a couple years later that I would finally visit for lunch with my family to celebrate my birthday.  And I'm glad I made that decision because we had a good experience, but unfortunately as I expected, Chef Martin Yan wasn't there.\n\nWith it being my birthday lunch, I went with ordering one of their specialty cocktails to celebrate.\n\nEast Meets West -- http://bit.ly/2itedEA\nchrysanthemum infused Russian standard's vodka, orange blossom honey, lemon juice\nThis was a great cocktail to start my meal with.  Very refreshing!\n\nOn to the food.  I really was just in the mood to have some noodles and so I decided on their Beef Noodle Soup to satisfy that craving.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup -- http://bit.ly/2ithuDX\nslow simmered short rib, baby bok choy\nThis soup was way better than I expected and it was loaded with noodles and a generous portion of short rib that easily broke apart.  The broth was very good too with a lot of flavor but not too salty surprisingly.  I'm glad I ordered this!\n\nWe also shared the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles and Pork Juicy Dumplings for everyone around the table.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles -- http://bit.ly/2itcleY\nbean sprouts, scallions, wood ear mushrooms\nThis is one of M.Y. China's signature menu items.  I liked the imperfection of the noodles and they were cooked perfectly with a good chew and the wild boar and mushrooms gave it a more hearty substance.\n\nPork Juicy Dumplings -- http://bit.ly/2itgi38\nBasically Xiao Long Bao and they were delicious!  A little pricey though compared to other places where you can get XLB.\n\nAnd then for Dessert I finished with the Lychee Panna Cotta.\n\nLychee Panna Cotta -- http://bit.ly/2it3DNR\nchrysanthemum granita, mint essence\nThis dessert was AMAZING!!  I love Panna Cotta and I love lychee so putting the two together made for a very delightful dessert!\n\nOverall, I liked M.Y. China.  It was a lot better than I thought it would be and it's a great spot to  dine for any occasion whether it be for a big party or if you're just stopping by for a quick noodle lunch.  I would definitely return again to try more of their menu items which there were plenty of.  And hopefully maybe next time Chef Martin Yan will be there.", "author": "Rodney H."}

The Wild Boar Scissors Cut Noodles was amazing and the Hong Kong Crispy Noodles with Chicken was also very flavorful but the M.Y. Dim Sum Collection and the Juicy Dumplings weren't as flavorful as they should have been. The worst part was \"the service\" and that's why I decided to leave a review. We had a dreaded waiter that took our order and left some of our order out and when my daughter politely called his attention to it he didn't apologize, when he brought our bill back to us he still had it listed even though she had spoken to him about it minutes before, and again he didn't apologize for his mistake when he took the bill back for corrections. He then took too long bringing it back to us with the corrections and he still did not apologize for his mistake and behaved arrogantly, as if we were a terrible inconvenience. \n\nI have eaten at thousands of restaurants and I know good service. There are tons of restaurants out there which serve equal quality food and their service is excellent and their servers apologize when they get an order wrong or leave something out. He needs to keep that in mind since he represents the restaurant to all those he serves and when he takes orders but forgets to bring something ordered it's all on him to make things right and apologize for the mistakes and put a little hustle in making it back to the table with the correction.

We came on a Wednesday around 12:30ish and it was busy, but we were seated immediately (there were 3 of us). This place is definitely an upscale Chinese place, and the food is kind of expensive for the amount of food and the quality of it, maybe because I'm used to going to cheaper Chinese restaurants   around the city with my family where I get more bang for my buck, but I digress. This place has a mix of dim sum and Chinese dishes, and the wait for our food wasn't long, around 10-15 min. \n\nFood:\n\n- Har gow (3): The har gow comes with some soy sauce (I didn't try the sauce since I don't usually eat har gow with sauce, but the har gow was packed with shrimp inside, and was definitely my favorite out of all the dishes.\n\n- Pork juicy dumplings (5): This is basically xiao long bao, and it was delicious. It comes in little individual spoons and comes with the usual vinegar sauce. There was also a slice of cucumber in between the spoon and dumpling, which was interesting but it didn't enhance the flavor of the dumpling or anything, so maybe it was there for aesthetic purposes or something, but still delicious, nonetheless. \n\n- Kung pao chicken: This is actually the first time I've had kung pao chicken, and it was alright. The dish comes with chicken (which were kind of dry), bell peppers (which were delicious), some chili peppers (which my friends said weren't spicy, but since I'm a weakling with spicy food, it was a bit spicy for me), and peanuts (very delicious!!). This dish had good flavor and spiciness.\n\n- Yang zhou fried rice: The amount of food was kind of small for the price, and it comes with mushrooms, BBQ pork, and shrimp pieces. The rice was good, but a little bland, and it worked well with the other dishes.\n\nThe service was great, and the servers refilled our waters when it was getting low in our glasses.

So you would have to park your car inside the parking structure, otherwise parking street is the other option. I believe the rate per hour on weekend is $2.5 (please correct me if I'm wrong), but it's not mindblowing crazy. \n\nFOOD\n======================================================================\nFor DIMSUM section we ordered;\n1. Beijing dumpling (that's what people here have been recommending): skin is quite thick, you could almost tell that it has too thick when you taste the flour more than the filling). \n2. Har Gaw: nothing special. Other dimsum have better har gaw\n\nFor Noodle we ordered;\n1. Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood (\u6d77\u9c9c\u58a8\u6c41\u6735\u9eba) $18. I asked our server what kind of noodles they were serving with for this dish, turned out the noodle was a point finger size cut. So it was not like regular chinese pulled noodle (which I thought it would be). The meats cooked with the noodle are shrimp, scallops, calamari, with brussels sprouts and bell peppers.\nTruthfully I dislike this dish, what I had in mind, it was going to be similar with Italian squid ink pasta, except they're using chinese noodle. However, what we had was totally different with what I had in mind. The taste itself, wow, underrated. I feel like eating regular chinese noodle in a fancy restaurant with premium price. Lack of flavor, portion is enough for two people, and this dish costs $18 exclude tax and tip.\n\n2. We also ordered Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles (\u91ce\u8c6c\u5200\u526a\u9eba) $16. The dish was originally for my kids. I requested to substitute the mushrooms with chicken. The veggies it has bean sprouts, scallions only. Again, they were serving this dish with a finger cut size noodle. It was easy for the kids to stab it with forks, but again, this second noodle dish lack of flavor. It even almost tasted the same with the first noodle dish we ordered (the squid ink noodle).\n\nFor the drink we ordered milk jasmine tea, it was just okay. \n\nTo sum it up; \nThis would be an American Chinese restaurant that has fancy decoration and located prime inside the Westfield Mall. It may be your dining destination if you are \n1. Never adventure in Chinese cuisine\n2. Going to the mall is your one stop destination where you want to shop and have lunch at the same time.\n3. You hate to eat in the hole in the wall restaurant. \n\nIf you are nowhere close to the 3 lists I mentioned, please save your money and time by not going here. Browse any other restaurants which I bet they are going to be tastier than this one!", "author": "Maureen M."}

China is my go to restaurant at times when I'm looking for something to eat around Union Square. I've been a few times and for the most part, the food has been pretty good and is flavored authentically. \n\nM.Y. China contrasts a lot with other more authentic and traditional Chinese restaurants in that the prices are steep and the attitude of the food is definitely more modernized/fusion. I can see that this restaurant is definitely a place where people come in to order more Americanized and typical Chinese food such as chow mien. \n\nThe menu includes small eats, \"dim sum,\" soups & salads, noodles, roasted, lobster, wok and vegetarian. There's a huge variety of food so it's easy to feel tempted to try everything, especially the dim sum dishes. I do enjoy the fact that they have a vegetarian section, there's definitely something for everyone at this place. Most dishes will run around $20. Portions are pretty filling.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup - Broth is pretty good, but I'm not a fan of the fact that it's cooked with udon noodles instead of the more traditional hand pulled/narrower noodles. \n\nVegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup - Unfortunately didn't get to really finish or enjoy it as there was a hair in it the fish time I got it (yuck!). Could've have been a nice and affordable healthy option though for $12.\n\nBlack Pepper Glazed Snapper - My favorite dish at this place. You can't go wrong with this one. Highly recommend.\n\nI came recently with friends who shared some dishes family style while I tried the Eggplant & Tofu Clay Pot. According to them, and from my observation the noodles aren't that great. \n\nEggplant & Tofu Clay Pot - Really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce and the fried edges of the tofu and eggplant.

I saw a video about the place on INSIDER food, and was really excited to go try the different types of noodles. We ordered a sizzling jian bao, juicy soup dumpling, beijing cut noodle, and da dao cut noodle. I have to say all of the food are presented very well, the taste... not so much. The jian bao was very average, nothing special. The soup dumpling, huh, what a disappointment it was. The dumpling was served in individual spoons and it stuck on the spoon! Both of the noodles were below average. Not necessarily the noodle itself but how they cooked it. It seems as if they were trying to Americanize it and it went horribly wrong.", "author": "Nina Y."}

When I have friends coming from out of states, I will definitely bring them to this restaurant and everyone seems to like it and love it. The duck is really good! The \"Big knife noodles\" used to be my favorite but seems like it has changed. Not too good but still delicious. Maybe they changed chefs?? Overall I love that restaurant and service is good. I will definitely recommend anyone to try it! \n\nAfter tonight dinner, I have to downgrade my rating for this restaurant. Why? \nService was bad. Servers were having mood swing, not knowing how to organize our foods on the table and show her anger on the plates. Loud & her face is showing anger & impatience. Food quality dropped at least 25-30% from the last time I dined in. Huge disappointment but my friends were satisfied with their first try. I will drop 2 stars and hope they can surprise me when I come in next time with better service, quality of foods.

I love that they have an old church bell in the middle of the bar I thought that was interesting. We got seated by a friendly hostess immediately although the place looks packed. For a party of two, they placed us in a table almost like a community table. We were seated very close to other couples which in not my preference because I like my space but the restaurant was packed on New Years Day and I am just starving to try their food. \n\nSo far getting seated was quick, we got greeted by the bus boy and served us water right away but it took a while for the waitress to greet us and take our order. She took our drink orders, I got a hot jasmine flower tea and it was so aromatic. It took another long time before she got our food orders. Once we placed pur order it was not before long that we got our dumpling appetizer. We had the crab roe juicy dumpling and wheat potsticker and it was good but nothing beats the juicy dumpling at Din Tai Fung.\n\nFor the main course we had the salted egg roasted crab. That was pretty epic. The crab meat was sweet and tender but the flavor of the little bits of fried batter you can't stop picking and savor in your mouth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-15", "description": "I'm bummed to update this review because I had such an incredible meal on my first visit but the service, food, and changes in the menu no longer speak to my original 5-star review.\n\nI thought I loved M.Y. China. I'd rave about the crab feast that 3 friends and I got with the scissor cut noodles, numerous sides, and affordable but delicious wine bottles. \n\nMy visit yesterday, granted we didn't do a shared crab dinner, was so disappointing. My dining partner and I ordered the pickle plate as an appetizer when our server first came to the table, along with their Mango Mule beverage - a non-alcoholic drink that sounded fresh and delicious but tasted like a too tart blend of a dash of ginger ale and a powdered drink mix packet. For $5, it was not something I would recommend or order again\n\nWe sat for a bit and then ordered the crispy tofu app, a side of brown rice, and the \"spicy\" portobello mushroom dish from the vegetarian section. We were bummed that the only vegetarian noodle dish they have is a soup and they aren't able to make any of their other noodle dishes into a vegetarian version.\n\nWe were waiting and waiting and waiting and saw tables around us get their food- tables that came in after we'd already ordered get their food. Unfortunately, it was difficult to flag down a server, though there were so many running around a restaurant that was a third empty. A part of me thinks they were short staffed that day, which happens, of course, but it felt like our table in particular was the 'dropped ball'.\n\nAfter a roughly 20-minute wait, our entree comes out. I ask about the pickles that we'd ordered well before everything else with our drinks. The food runner seemed confused but still said it was coming... after 20 minutes? after the entree? after the other hot appetizer that also hasn't come out? Why does a small, cold plate take longer than everything else?\n\nHe ends up taking the entree back with him, so now we're back to having no food. A few more minutes pass, we're confused, were nervous that now they're just going to scrape together the pickle plate and then come back and serve us a cold entree. \n\nWe flag down someone to ask them to just cancel the pickle plate but it seems like he doesn't understand. He sends our server over who now drops off our hot appetizer, the crispy tofu. I ask him to cancel the pickles since they hadn't come and explain about the weird appearance of our entree and then disappearance of it and the server's response was, 'oh you wanted the pickles as an appetizer?\" in an actually pretty snide can't-admit-that-he's-wrong way. As if the blame is on me, the customer, to tell the server that the cold dish listed under their \"small plates\" menu that we ordered with our drinks before any food, that I want it to come before our entrees. \n\nWhy would anyone order a dish first, with their drinks, and expect it to come out after their dinner? As if the cold pickle plate is ordered as a dessert. No. That never happens. You forgot it- someone forgot it. And instead of just admitting it after 25 minutes, or comping the $6 dish, which would have been appropriate, you tried to place the blame on your table and then just say, 'Ok, I'll hold the order so it doesn't get made'. Like, DUDE, it's been 25 minutes. No need to press, 'hold', it's not f*cking coming and I'm not an idiot. At least have enough sense to throw the kitchen under the bus for your mistake and not your customer. \n\nSo we never got the pickles, nor did we get an apology for how they were forgotten. We eventually got our crispy tofu and that was fine. Not stellar and the dipping sauce was super pedestrian. I liked the potpourri of jalapeno bits and spicy stuff on the plate, but for the price this is a completely skippable dish. \n\nOur entree, surprise surprise, came back out shorty after. Lukewarm with the rice being straight up cold. The portion is small, the dish labeled as spicy wasn't spicy in the least, and the texture of the portobellos wasn't appetizing at all. So tough and squeaky and you felt like you were somehow chewing gristle and not mushrooms. The dish was our server's recommendation and I can't second that opinion. It was ok, but not great and if that's the best veg dish they have... well, maybe just don't have vegetarian dishes because its clearly not something you care about. \n\nI'm bummed that M.Y. China doesn't offer the selection or service it once did and that my dinner on Valentine's Day (though not for Valentine's Day) was such a sad experience. I think if you eat meat then you may have a perfectly fine experience here, though I can't speak to those dishes which make up most of the menu. I want to hope that the crab dinners are just as good as I remember but I can't see myself coming back after this experience. We didn't spend a lot of money here, but we did spend some and that's cash I could've used elsewhere for better selection, quality, and service.", "author": "Candice G."}

My wife and I have been here before and were impressed enough to want to share it with friends.\n\nBeing in a mall for some might be a turn off, but for us the location has been ideal.   Coming from the East Bay it is remarkably accessible by BART.  The location can be construed to be a Chinese touristy place and be off putting to us Asian American locals.  So our first timers were in for a pleasant surprise.   \n\nWe were able to come early before our reservation time to have happy hour in the bar and be able to sample the appetizers.  My favorite was the chicken feet with black bean sauce.  Of course, it grossed everyone else out; so I did not have to share!\n\nOur Chinese-Ecuadoran waiter for dinner was excellent by all measures. The 91 year old friend thought he was cute and even wanted a picture with him.

That is a real plus.  Do you \"hear\" me?  \n\nAfterwards the guests raved about the dining experience and our chef friend said, \"I can see now why you like M.Y.

China is chef Martin Yan's concept restaurant and whose classic Chinese recipes have a modern twist. \n\nIt felt especially right to dine here on the eve of Lunar New Year. \n\nInfused with flavor with lots of ginger, daikon radish, salty-savory black bean paste and flavorful meats wok-tossed to perfection, we enjoyed favorites and new dishes: Shanghai soup dumplings (XLB): minced pork in spicy bean paste, knife cut Beijing noodles with refreshing and crunchy julienned cucumber, bean sprouts and carrots; pork belly sliders.\n\nTea-infused pork belly sliders on mu shu pancakes with spicy sauce, daikon radish and cilantro were a miss: the pork was overcooked and stringy and lacked the creamy unctuousness of pork belly. \n\nThe manager came over to apologize and asked if we wanted a replacement dish or if they could remove it from our bill, especially generous since my food incinerator son had already devoured one. \n\nEven kinder was the manager gifting us the delicious sugar egg puffs we ordered. They overheard my son saying his Lego store shopping trip and M.Y.

I found the soup to be on the bland side, but I assume as a starter it was probably meant to be this way. \n\nFortune Platter- a medley of goodies!

Everyone loved them!\n\nGolden Lobster - FAVORITE COURSE! The seasoning and batter of the lobster was drool worthy.

Loved the sauce that came with it. \n\nHappy Opportunity - described as a fried chicken, but this is unique since it wasn't battered.

It came with sticky rice that paired with it nicely. \n\nLong Life - these noodles looked bland, but they were super flavorful! I was pleasantly surprised!

They are downright dangerous to eat. So bad that we sent them back and exchange them for the lettuce wraps, which were quite good. The tacos were also quite good. The Wonton Soup, usually my measure of Chinese food, was terrible. Although the wontons were tasty, there were only a few scallion slivers floating in the broth, nothing else... No other vegetables.

We had a variety of dishes, beef, tofu, BBQ pork, sea bass, veggies, on and on...everything was delicious, rich, yet light and fresh. \n\nThe staff was friendly and efficient, and in no hurry to turn the table.

And of course they tack on the phony \"SF Mandate\" BS and don't mention it beforehand as the law requires. \n\n$25 spent here makes you wish you'd just gone to the Panda Express in the basement, unless you just want to feel like a \"more important\" person. \n\nPerhaps Yan Can Cook, but as for his restaurant.... not so much. Panda Express or any random on Stockton or Grant will do you so much better for so much less. But if wood interiors turn you on, the decorations here are real pretty.", "author": "T J."}

Somehow more like supermarket wings.

I felt like it was more balanced. Each dish hit different notes. It was a bit of an awakening in Chinese food.\n\nThe Ma Po Tofu was a thinner sauce, but I thought it really pushed new boundaries in flavor. I really liked it, but it's a different style all together. Wok seared beef reminded me of 'Shaking Beef' at Slanted Door. It was very good. Xiao long bao (XLB) was delicate, consistent in size, flavor, and broth. I enjoyed it but hard to compare against Shanghai Dumpling King.\n\nNoodles were a bit disappointing.  Maybe I wanted more rustic flavor but I thought the noodles were average. Dan dan mein was cold. Presentation was good, but I wanted stronger flavors, thicker gravy. This was thin and light.

We had 6 people in our party and ordered 6 dishes and shared Family-style.\n\nI'm Chinese and I love noodles. It was perfect timing as I was traveling to SF  for the Half Marathon. I could carb up...a perfect win. I loved the Vegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup and the Hong Kong Style Crispy Noodles (perfect amount of spiciness for my timid taste buds and beautifully presented in a bird nest basket). The Scissor Cut Noodles with Wild Boar was okay. The boar was very tender though I think it's just pork...that's what it tasted like to me. The noodles were thicker and had a more doughy texture that I do not prefer. The Venison Chow Fun was okay. I didn't like the venison (my 6 year old loved it and picked all the meat) and the rice noodles tasted like other rice noodles I've had. The Chairman Mao's Chicken had a great texture. We had the sauce on the side as my kids vary in spice preference. \n\nThe service was great for us. We were waited on quickly and the food came out in a very timely manner. Waitresses were polite and bussed our tables throughout our meal, creating more space.\n\nWould I come back? Not sure...it is a bit on the pricy side when you think of Chinese food.

Look at the photos of food before you order. \n\nWe came on a Monday night and there was a decent amount of people there. We ordered 4 dishes: beef noodle soup ($16), wok stir-fried seafood ($23), mapo tofu ($8), and a half order of Peking duck ($24). \n\nBeef noodle soup was pricey but there was a lot of meat that was cooked well and really tender. The noodles were really smooth so they didn't really absorb the broth flavor but now I'm just being nitpicky haha. I super regret getting the stir-fried seafood. It was just cooked calamari, scallops, shrimp, and a ton of celery for the same price as Peking duck :( Mapo tofu is my boyfriend's comfort food so we ordered it. It was a \"side\" portion but it did taste good and pretty classic. \n\nPeking duck! The star of the meal came with 8 pieces of skin, lots of duck meat underneath, 6 delicious and fluffy steamed buns, hoisin sauce, green onions and cucumbers. It was a very generous portion for each bun and the skins were roasted to perfection.

My dishes are on the expensive side for Chinese food, but the ingredients are definitely more high quality than what you would find at your typical hole in the wall. Martin Yan, the restaurant owner, has some pretty god street cred in the Bay Area. He does a great job with the decor and menu, but the service and taste sometimes offset the overall dining experience. Reservations are not required. \n\n[Dinner]\nMy favorite from the menu is the noodle dishes, the Beef Noodle Soup and Scissor Cut Noodle. You can sometimes see the chef hand-pulling the noodles in the open kitchen, so it's great to see the authenticity behind what you're paying for. The XLB Soup Dumplings are really overpriced for what you get. I really don't like that it's served on cucumber on its red spoon when steamed - it takes away from the overall flavor profile of the soup dumpling. The peking duck is decent. Nothing too special about the dish, but it seems to be a favorite with diners. The one time I ordered hot and sour soup, it came out lukewarm.\n\n[Drinks]\nThey charge you a lot for tea, and the other beverages. Overpriced. \n\n[Service / Decor]\nAwesome bar decor. Also located under the Dome of the Westfield mall, so its pretty look at it if you're in Westfield late. The servers don't really know the menu well enough, and the recommendations they give aren't really highlights or \"traditional\" Chinese dishes.

This place should be rated much higher (some people may penalize it because that they are not used to pay higher prices for Great Chinese food). Good stop when you are shopping in the mall for an afternoon pickup. \n\nMUST HAVE's:\nSweet and sour soup is excellent - order it extra hot (temperature - wise) given that it's served lukewarm sometimes.  Good balance of tofu, egg drop, mushroom, etc. we always order this when we come here. \n\nMu Shi pork tacos - first i was skeptical of anything that has an Americanized name like Mu Shu (bringing me back to greasy bastardized Americanized Chinese fast food from middle school days in CT). This one is a winner. Perfectly seasoned. Innovative, and I love the taco shells too - a bit like Peking Duck wraps but not quite. A prefect dish. \n\nSOLID:\nWild boar scissor cut noodles. Like the texture and shape of the noodles here. Pretty good. \n\nOrder Kung bao chicken with less sugar. Well executed dish. I will never own the wok with industrial stove to cook this dish at high temperature at home. Even though I am in general more weary of Americanized dishes, the breading on the chicken is thin and crispy and the bell peppers is crunchy, with none of the gooey sauce that often covers the ingredients in a fast food Chinese restaurant. \n\nPeking duck - excellent. I like the buns that come with the Peking duck. The skins are just right. Ask for more scallions with this. \n\nIf you come here for happy hour, the red wine with 7 grapes blend is decent and good value. \n\nSKIP:\nSkip the wok-based beef - the meat is a bit too chewy.\n\nCrispy veggie roll is solid but not exceptional. The sauce is a bit too sweet. Ask them for ginger soy sauce (that accompanies seafood dumpling) for the alternative sauce. \n\nSteamed vegetable dumplings - too bland\n\nPork riblet - the first bite tasted good but then you get a bit tired of the meat due to the sweetness and greasiness. Maybe much better with rice.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

However, we took a leap of faith and gave it a go.\nWe ordered various dim sum items as well as the beef noodle soup.  The dim sum items were good, a mix between traditional dim sum and a twist of modern touches, for example, their sticky rice is made with wild grain rice, which was different, a little less sticky, but not bad.  Their beef noodle soup was excellent, had great Taiwanese flavor with chunks of very tender beef.  The noodles did not seem to be hand pulled, but still nice and tender without being soggy.  They don't skimp on the bok choy as some places do for their beef noodle soup.\nThe decor is very classy and could be a 5 star restaurant on its own.  So it does seem a bit out of place inside the mall, but I get it, you can't beat the foot traffic afforded by the Galleria mall patrons.\nThe next time we dined here, we had the dim sum sampler, it was consistent with the first time and their noodle soup was still great.\nPrice is a big high for the food, but consistent with the area.\n\nService was very solid, nice attention to our needs. We never had to flag anyone down.  Martin Yan would be proud.", "author": "Rob L."}

The restaurant is conveniently located within a mall. I disregarded the poor food safety score that pops up on yelp and came in during happy hour- $5 bites. \n\nThey changed the menu, so it differs from the one posted online. I was disappointed that the pork juicy dumplings were no longer on the happy hour menu. I ordered the salt & pepper calamari, shui mai (4) and har gow (3). My favorite was the calamari. I was a bit disappointed with the shui mai and har gow. They are two dishes I always order when I eat dim sum, and I wanted to compare theirs with what I've had. The ones here are maybe a bit bigger and the ingredients are a bit better, but I didn't think they were that much better. I also had the tea infused creme brulee.

China is a collaboration between Martin Yan (television cooking show host, local personality) and Koi Palace (famed restaurant with locations in the Peninsula, East Bay, and South Bay).  It sits atop the Dome of the Westfield San Francisco Centre and reveals a grand plan to not only have top shopping destinations and brands, but also renovated food courts and sit-down offerings (Din Tai Fung at Westfield Valley Faire, M.Y. China at Westfield SF Centre).  \n\nWhile purists will likely find faults with the modern interpretations and execution of Chinese classics, many mall demographic people will be happy with the modern and clean decor, spacious seating, and elevated cuisine compared to either the mall food courts of past or even of the area.  \n\nTourists visiting the area could easily head to the Sunset or Richmond district or even find Thai or Vietnamese fare in the Tenderloin that would both be cheaper and more delicious, but it's not likely it would be as comfortable.  \n\nWe ordered a broad selection of the menu and were happy with our diverse choices and glad at the professional service and their ability to sit a large party on a busy weekend with little notice.  Honestly, I'd say the execution is the low or middle part of the menu and that our misses were at the high end.  Our order:\n\nHot and Sour Soup - $12.  More like hot and very sour soup.  I think the waiter overheard me saying this and brought another complimentary bowl by later, but it was more of the same....very sour and more chili oil so very hot.  Pass.\n\nBeef Pulled Noodle Soup - $15.  Solid.  Tender beef, tasty bok choy and round standard noodles.  The soup broth was flavorful and piping hot.\n\nHong Kong Crispy Noodles with Chicken XO - $16.  Another solid dish.  Nicely crispy fried noodles topped with plentiful sauce and large chunks of tender, but white meat chicken.  Not much XO but I enjoyed it.  \n\nWok Seared Beef - $19.  Tender filets of beef with a touch of sichuan peppercorns.  A bit odd paired with bitter arugula, but the dish had a nice flavor.  \n\nCrispy Whole Rockfish - $32.  Heading into the weaker part of the menu.  I should have read the description carefully, but I expected whole large pieces of rockfish stir fried with sauce.  Instead, it was a deep fried entire rockfish fried to a very crispy finish and topped with a nice sauce.  While the presentation wasn't as expected (it's very similar to a popular Americanized Chef Chu dish in Los Altos ), I was still game.  I soon realized why they deep fried it for so long.  In short, it probably wasn't swimming recently. \n\nSalted Egg Dungeness Crab - $48.  This is a classic dish and I was hoping for a tasty rendition.  The salted egg coating was decent, but again, like the fish, the crab quality, despite dungeness crab season opening late this year, wasn't up to par.  I'm used to going to places with seafood tanks (Koi Palace, Yum's Bistro, etc.) so I should have known.  Disappointing at the price point.  \n\nOverall, we had a solid meal at M.Y. China.  There's much to like with the decor, service, and location, especially if you're a tourist visiting SF or simply doing some shopping in SoMa.  Chinese cuisine in these parts is going to be either expensive (Hakkasan, Crystal Jade) or mediocre or some combination of both.  If you stick to the noodle dishes and small plates, you'll do fine.  Just don't go for the high end banquet items as this place doesn't quite have the ingredients to go the distance. \n\nM.Y.

Finally, quality Chinese food at an establishment that isn't run down or dirty. It was a nice change of pace. Getting to see the cooks do their thing in the kitchen was also a nice addition to the overall experience. Being located on the top floor of the Westfield Mall in SF is great as it avoids all the hustle and bustle from the bottom floors.\n\n[Food]: All the food came out quicker than our server had told us it would, but it was pretty slow so that may have been why. \n* XLB - My favorite thing here in terms of taste. The filling of the XLB were really nice and gingery which I enjoyed, but a majority of the bao's were already broken which was sad. They came in spoons which made the situation better, but still - a bummer!\n* Spicy Seafood Dumplings - Another favorite. The sauce was delicious and pulled everything together. We were using the remaining sauce on all the other dumplings as well.\n* Beijing Knife Cut Noodles - Decent. The shape of the noodles were not very symmetrical, but overall still good.\n* Shiu Mai & Har Gow - Both Dim Sum classics. Not bad, but not great. Overall nothing too special about these. \n* Lychee panna cotta - I'm half Italian and half Chinese, so this sounded interesting - like the best of both worlds! Unfortunately, it was kind of odd. Definitely not panna cotta at all, but more like pudding. Beautiful presentation, but I wouldn't bother getting this again.\n\n[Service]: Every employee we encountered, including the host, buser, runner, and of course server, was professional and kind. Our server checked in on us enough to make sure our water was full and that we doing okay overall, but never in a way that was bothersome or annoying which I appreciated. \n\nAll in all, I appreciate M.Y. China for it's modern dining. Although it's definitely on the pricier side, the prices aren't outrageous all things considered. However, what really disappointed me was our experience afterwards when my entire family started feeling very thirsty and tired - symptoms normally caused after eating MSG. My family and I mostly came here in hopes to avoid MSG, especially since this is a higher end restaurant and we didn't think they'd add any.", "author": "Mars S."}

They don't offer truly authentic Chinese food, so don't come if that's what you're looking for. Instead, they offer their own take on popular dishes from various different regions. Part of this interpretation is the use of high quality, noticeably fresh ingredients that impart a bright texture and flavor to the dishes. \n\nPork juicy dumplings $9- I think these were the most authentic dish we tried. Very comparable to xiaolongbao that I've had in Shanghai. You get five on their own individual ceramic spoons. It doesn't sound like much, but they are on the larger side. Unlike other soup dumplings where soup spills out when you break the skin, these hold their soup inside the meat filling so you get more and more in your spoon with each bite. \n\nWild boar sticky rice cakes $16- These were great! The rice cakes were wonderfully thick and chewy and taste homemade, the veggies fresh and bright.\n\nBeijing knife cut noodles $13- This is a play on zhajiangmein but doesn't taste anything like the real thing. The dish was still delicious in its own way, and I liked that they created a sauce with toppings that really suit the texture and shape of the noodles. \n\nEast meets west $12- Highly recommend! It's like drinking sweet chrysanthemum tea with a hint of lemon. Great for people who don't like the taste of alcohol.\n\nMatcha tiramisu $8- A bit too sweet for my liking.

The chrysanthemum infusion was bold yet muted and honestly, I don't think I've ever tasted such a strong flower essence in a drink that did not overpower the whole thing.

The service is superb, and I'm not sure if I've ever been so pleased with a restaurant that is technically inside a mall. \nSugar egg puff dessert (think big, fluffy sopapillas) is fantastic, especially when paired with choya dessert wine. I don't even really like raspberries, but the raspberry sauce that goes with the sugar egg puffs is GREAT! It doesn't have that sharp bite of most raspberries and is actually sweet. #delectable\n\nThe bar team is super cool and friendly, and it was obvious that they were very well acquainted with some of the regulars who were in here. The staff are very knowledgeable about each dish and are quick to suggest a pairing. They even gave me a quick rundown of which dishes did not contain any seafood-based sauces, which was a great help. \n\nDon't pass on M.Y. China just because it's in Westfield Mall! Truly a gem.", "author": "Willie R."}

I love how modern yet traditional the furnitures look, and overall it just feels very clean. I also think it's interesting how they have the kitchen behind a clear counter, because it is not only fun to watch, but also assures customers of the foods' cleanliness. Also, service was great and was very willing to explain some confusing dishes, which is a plus!\n\nWhen it comes to the food, while it's undeniably good, it's definitely very pricey. I tried the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, which was similar to the taste of beef chow fen. The noodles didn't taste like I expected---it wasn't as chewy as I had hoped it to be. Also, the dish was VERY greasy. The Spicy Seafood Dumplings were good; I really enjoyed the sauce, but it was nothing MIND-BLOWING. The best one in my opinion were the Pork Juicy Dumplings. I loved how they were presented in little red spoons, which made it convenient to consume the soup in the dumplings!", "author": "Diane Z."}

Very nice anterior, patio (although still within Westfield) seating, and friendly staff. \nFood: I tried the beef rolls, squid ink noodles, Peking duck, and lava buns for dessert. \n-Beef rolls were okay, not much meat and pretty thick flour rolls. Good thing was that the beef was more like chunks of steak instead of slices. This came with 4 pieces \n-squid ink noodles: the term \"noodle\" is misleading. I wish the waitress told us that the noodles are knife-cut noodles, so instead of the typical long noodles, they're round and flattened. Stir-fried with bell peppers and shrimp. I wouldn't recommend this, the squid ink was just used to make the noodles a black color, whoop-dee-do.\n-Peking duck (half portion): came with 6 buns and half a portion of duck. Essentially DIY duck tacos. This was great, the skin was crispy, the meat was well cooked and tender, and they did a good job de-boning it for the most part. I wish it came with more cucumber slices and green onions. But I RECOMMEND this the most, from the items I tried ! \n-lava buns: soft buns with a sweet , runny egg-yolk- based center. REALLY sweet.

Reserve a seat? Yes, please! Ta-da! We skipped the line and were seated right away. We kinda giggled as we heard people being told it would be at least a 30 minute wait. You should really yelp!!\n\nTo start, our server was super sweet and attentive and had great recommendations. She and the wait staff were excellent. Our water glasses and tea pot were constantly filled and our table was cleared quickly. We ordered a lot for three people so this was imperative for space saving.\n\nWe ordered some delicious tea to start. Definitely order tea! Then we had the Crab Dumplings which I would probably skip next time. The Salt & Pepper Calamari, yummy but more salty than peppery. The Hot & Sour Soup, so hot so yummy!!!!\n\nAs main and side dishes we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Chairman Mao Chicken which was lightly fried and stole the show. I personally loved the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, they where so yummy!!!!! As was the Yang Zhao Fried Rice, I'm not a big fan of fried rice but this is no regular fried rice. The pork and shrimp are beautifully seasoned and the flavors are just right!\n\nMajor Tip: save room for sweets! The Sugar Egg Puffs and Black Sesame Ice Cream were amazing.

Not worth it.\n\nService was brusque, obviously wanting to keep tables turning unless we were ordering more. Though, they did refill our teapot at no charge, which was a nice bonus.\n\nI will say, the ambiance is definitely nice for a mall restaurant. It's strangely both upscale and family friendly, packed with large groups (definitely make a reservation).

I do not need to feel forced to watch them discuss whatever they are discussing that has absolutely nothing to do with me. I had a reservation, I made it a point to be exactly on time. Seat me first then giggle and talk about whatever you like. Professionalism. \n\nThe space itself feels and looks like you are in an airport. It isn't comfortable or luxurious.The prices do not match the space. I was seated at an end table in the outer perimeter of the restaurant which was nice, but with the tables unnecessarily close together, watching my dishes quickly fill that tiny table was overwhelming. Limited elbow room due to the party at the table beside me made trying to eat comfortably annoying. \n\nIf you want to buy the most overpriced XLB, try it here! 6 pieces for the price of an entree. It was good, but not that good. Now that I think of it, Dragon Beaux has a similarly priced XLB with the same amount of dumplings. I do not recommend, I would not reorder this. \n\nThe overcooked chicken wings were saturated with a sweet and salty sauce that made eating one wing enough for me. \n\nSteamed Fish. This was delicious but overpriced. The long stalks of vegetables were awkward to eat but they were cooked correctly. \n\nThe squid ink snap noodle? OUTSTANDING.  Wonderfully balanced with perfectly cooked seafood alongside toothsome noodles. This was perfection on a plate. If I only ordered this, my review would have a different tone. \n\nMy egg puffs were hollow. I basically poured the random dipping sauces inside of them to eat. Such a shame to not have the lovely tender web-like center to contrast with the crisp sugary outside. I'd be happy to have a properly cooked egg puff without the sauce distraction. \n\nThe highlight of my visit? My server. She was attentive and professional. Polished. The busers were also excellent. They deserve 5 stars. \n\nWhen I consider the price point, the stressful feeling of being crammed into a space, and the weird reception, I would not recommend this restaurant. I could have spent the same money at sibling restaurant Koi Palace for an amazing meal in a comfortable dining space. \n\nIf you are in the mall in jeans and a t-shirt, sure.

I especially love that they are dog-friendly as long as you can get one of the tables closer to the rotunda side. \n\nI had a little incident where I made a reservation for my birthday and specifically asked for one of the round banquet tables because I wanted to bring my two fur babies.  My party of 4 humans and 2 dogs arrived before our reservation time, but they did not have the table ready for us!  After a few times speaking to the front of the house staff and one exchange where I told them how upset I was, they finally got one of the round banquet tables ready for us.  Once we were seated, we had a great time.  The wait person, Yan, was super excellent and attentive!  Knowing that it was my birthday lunch, they gave us  a complementary dessert - the yummy doughnuts!  Nice touch...thank you! \n\nI hope the reservation incident was just a little hiccup.  When one makes a reservation, we don't want to hear excuses about why the table is not ready.

The patio which faces the mall could have been a longer wait.\n\nFull menu available - but they had no ramen, only noodle soups. In such case, I opted for the happy hour menu.\n\nHappy hour until 6 p.m. Monday thru Friday. A tiny assortment (a handful) of Dim Sum dishes at $5 each (which is average for a pricey dim sum place). Food was great; portions seemed small - but this is happy hour, small bites & finger foods.\n\nMixed drinks are very good but not excellent. Had to ask for a well drink to get back to basics. \n\nAfter three dim sum dishes, I was ready to resume shopping. ~ $39 \n\nIn hindsight, a longer wait to sit at the patio or at a table would have been worth it.

I would have given 3.5 stars and rounded up to four, but the prices are really high for Chinese food that was good, but not great. Presentation was good, and I really can't complain about the food itself, but the prices are just too high for what you get.\n\nWe tried the dumplings, which were somewhat bland, but the texture was good. The beef rolls were not what I expected. I had thought it would be lighter and have more flavor. We also tried the kung pao chicken, seven spice pork ribs, and the dan dan noodles. These three dishes were very good. I'm not normally a kung pao chicken fan, but the way they treated the peppers was excellent. Lots of flavor and surprisingly good. The seven spice pork ribs was a pork rib that was basically a version of what you would get for a salt and pepper pork chop at a regular Chinese restaurant. It was good, but overpriced. The dan dan noodles is served chilled with some heat and was also tasty. So, basically, 3-2 when it came down to which dishes were good.\n\nMinus a star for them adding an extra $2 to my tip, which I noticed on my online credit card statement. I had already given an 18% tip, so I was a bit shocked and had to do a double take. I thought about letting it go since it's only $2, but it just didn't sit well with me. This prompted me to place a dispute with my credit card and call the restaurant. They called me back after I left a message and said they would look into it. Shortly after that first call, they called again saying that they needed to have a General Manager, who would not be in until after the weekend, credit the $2 back to my card. Finally, I got a call a few days later saying they would credit my card, and a few days after that it finally showed up on my online statement.

I've been to many of the great restaurants around the world and I gotta tell you, this meal was right up there with the best of them!  \n\nMy friend and I went to the MY China at the Graton Casino - and you can see my review there, it was horrible service and horrible foood. But we were persuaded to try the M.Y. China restaurant in SF as it was supposed to be outstanding. So glad we did! It was beyond great! It was a fantastic experience!\n\nThe online marketing manager, Carol, invited myself and a guest to the SF restaurant for dinner. She suggested the lobster. So we got there and ordered: 2 garlic lobsters (2 lbs EACH and seriously, just one was enough for 3 people), 2 glasses of chardonnay, 2 cocktails (Mai Tai and an East Meets West), 1 order of juicy dumplings, 2 papaya and shrimp salads, a plate of wild boar noodles and for dessert, these delicious giant cream puffs with melted chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce and whipped cream. (We ended up taking home the wild boar noodles which were okay, but not great).  \n\nI'm embarrassed to admit this, but my brother and I seriously killed it. We ate it all! I was afraid that they were going to award us the Trough Award for being the biggest piggies. Ha!  The food was so impressive, we can't wait to go back and try their garlic crab! And the waitress kept recommending the chicken salad, so we will definitely be back for that as well as the Papaya and shrimp salad.\n\nThe lobster is the one dish that I recommend everyone try. It was incredible! (Like an orgasm in my mouth!)  It was cut up into manageable pieces and had fried garlic everywhere. It was outstanding!  An absolute must try.  Another stand out dish was the papaya and shrimp salad. It blew our minds with how good it was. I have never eaten fresher or better tasting shrimp! \n\nThe bar was crowded and for good reason. My brother loved their chardonnay wine and I loved their \"East Meets West\" cocktails.  (Just thinking about my meal is making me swoon.)  If you can force yourself to eat one more thing after eating the lobster, I highly recommend the egg puffs with the two sauces.  \n\n(Pardon me, I've got to go wipe the drool off my keyboard as I write this!)\n\nMy experience in San Francisco was so different from the one I had at M.Y. China at the Graton casino, I find it hard to believe it's the same ownership!  They seriously need to send the SF manager, Daniel Nunoz? to that Casino and whip it into shape!\n\nOkay, bottom line, growing up in the SF area (Hello, Pacifica!) I've enjoyed hundreds of Chinese restaurants, BUT have never, ever, had such a gourmet experience as what we experienced at M.Y. China SF!\n\nThe decor was stunning - we loved looking at the massive, ornate rotunda dome while eating. And the decor and food were not the only things 5 star about this restaurant - the service was superb!  Couldn't have been better. Listen, I know I'm gushing here, but M.Y. China needs to be the place you go to with friends and family to celebrate . . . well, anything! I will definitely be back with my family and friends. I can't wait for them to try the food - especially the LOBSTER!\n\nPS: Location is at the mall on Market St.. Parking was only $1 an hour at the Ellis-O'Farell Parking garage, which is free valet parking and only a block away.  I would post several of the photos I took, but I can't figure out how to do it.  The photos would make you pick up the phone and make a reservation right now!\n\nYou gotta try this place. I was overwhelmingly surprised at how good it was.", "author": "Anne J."}

It's not her usual style to try these kind of restaurants, but who am I to say no. Whatever Mama Fabulous wants, she gets. And plus, we watched Yan Can Cook in the house growing up, so I was curious to try his restaurant.\n\nUpon arrival, I was immediately turned off by the open mall seating. We were seated at a table that was half indoors and half in the mall. It made me feel like I was eating at a food court! The servers were also unhelpful and piled the dishes on our table without giving a care about placement. It felt they were all eager to get the dishes out of their hands ASAP.\n\nOn to the food!\n\nJuicy Dumplings: Our favorite dish of the night. The skin was thin and the filling was soft. Extra points for the crab dumping because we can really taste the crab flavor.\n\nSalt & Pepper Calamari: Not bad, a little on the spicy side. It wasn't anything too special though.\n\nBeef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup: This was good too. Nothing to rave about. Portions were small, especially given the price. \n\nM.Y. Sweet & Sour Pork: Mediocre\n\nJasmine Tea Smoked Sea Bass: The sea bass is pretty flavorful, but I've been spoiled by a similar dish at R&G Lounge that is to die for!\n\nTwin Scallops Fried Rice: Meh.

The flavors in every dish were on point.\n\nThis restaurant is ideal for bigger groups, because trying only 1 or 2 dishes does not do the menu justice. I would imagine that making a reservation here is optimal, though having to wait while in a mall is not the worst scenario imaginable. Would recommend, whether you're a local or visitor!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

Was definitely $4-10 more dollars than what you would have normally paid. \n\n\nFor the mall, this place wasnt that bad. The food was decent as well. It definitely wasnt your standard chinese food. More quality taste to it. \n\nThe honey walnut shrimp was fire. I was wondering what that extra hint of flavor was. They mixed wasabi in with the mayo. It was really good. Their drinks were not that bad either. I got the East meets West. Had a nice old fashioned taste to it. Their pastas were really large sized too. Had lots of seafood. They definitely dont skimp on the ingredients. \n\nTheir eggs puffs though. (CRY) I was expecting to bite into a warm, fluffy egg puff. Instead it was crispy and no flavor at all. Not even the sugar which it was coated in saved it.\n\nThe reason for the star deduction was the service. The food took really long for it to get to us. By the time we got out food. It was slightly cold. So our waiter was saying that the portions were family style. We asked if any of them came with rice. He said nah so we ordered a bunch of sides of rice as well as some fried rice. So when we finally got our food. We basically got double the amount of rice because our honey walnut prawns (which basically everyone ordered). \n\nOverall, the experience was alright.

Honestly, if we had to pay for our food out of pocket, I really do not think it would be worth it. \n\nThe atmosphere is definitely nice. The interior is intimate, warm, and dimly lit. They had a gender-neutral bathroom which is something I thought I would only see at Berkeley (props for the inclusivity even if I think they just did it because they didn't have room for two separate bathrooms). \n\nThe service was nice, no complaints there. \n\nWe ordered the tofu eggplant clay pot, the squid ink noodles, half duck, and bang bang chicken. The bang bang chicken was probably my favorite dish. The sauce was sticky and just the right amount of salty and tangy. However, I know that this place is well known for their duck. Everything else seemed like something that I could either make at home or get at a much cheaper Chinese restaurant. The squid ink noodles were a bit disappointing. I've had squid ink dishes before and I know that squid ink has a very distinct, subtle flavor, a flavor I couldn't taste in their dish. \n\nWhat really threw me off was the size of their chopped vegetables. If I'm paying $15 for a dish, I expect the chefs to care about what they're making. In both the clay pot and in the squid ink noodles, the bell pepper and onions were cut in huge chunks, almost as if they were in a rush to chop them. Maybe I am missing the artistic/flavor purpose played by the roughly chopped veggies but to me, it just seemed a bit too careless. \n\nTldr decent food but definitely not worth the price.", "author": "Sarah Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-16", "description": "Actual rating 3.5.\n\nTo quote Robin Sparkles, \"Let's Go to the Mall!\"\n\nLately the Westfield San Francisco is redefining \"mall food\" because their listings are places I would proudly admit to going. The No1DP had to buy some chocolate at the mall and one of the staff at that place suggested eating \"under the dome\". \n\nCONCEPT: A collaboration between Martin Yan (of Yan Can Cook, a staple resource for rice-cooker owners) and Ronny and Willy Ng, the owners of \"Koi Palace\" in Daly City. \n\nVENUE: One of the more \"formal\" sit-down dining options \"Under the Dome\", SF's premier dining area. There's indoor and \"outdoor\" seating. The No1DP and I chose to sit directly next to a \"open kitchen\" (it's actually partially sealed so less mess) so you can watch the cooking show in front of you.\n\nSERVICE: A little slow on a Friday afternoon, but we managed to get our drinks and entrees in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nNo1DP and I ate here prior to a movie so we primarily went with their happy hour menu.\n- Afternoon Zu (Zubrowka bison grass vodka, ginger liqueur, elderflower). A bit disappointed with this vodka because I had high standards for zubrowka, which is supposed to be high-quality polish vodka. It tasted like there were two conflicting \"herbal\" flavors in the drink.\n- Vesper (Vesper Gin, vodka, Cocchi Americano. Shaken, not stirred). Slightly better than the Afternoon Zu, but the flavoring was still slightly \"off\".\n- Buddha Breeze (Hangar One \"Buddha's hand\" vodka, thai basil & cucumber). Should have gotten this, his drink was mixed perfectly and tasted quite refreshing with a hint of tart.\n\n- Shui Mai (pork, shrimp, morel mushroom), $5. The shu mai is a bit more plump than typically served at dim sum. Each piece was dense with meat.\n- Har Gow (jumbo shrimp, served with spicy soy sauce), $5. Like the shu mai, the piece is more plump than typically served at dim sum. Had a slightly hard time picking it up with plastic chopstick. The skin easily came off from the shrimp. This is one of the pieces that goes well with chili and soy sauce - eating it plain tastes somewhat bland.\n- Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup (slow simmered short rib, baby bok choy), $15. The dish had excellent presentation. Bok choy was slightly firm (just right!) and moist and soft ribs that could be easily sliced with the fork. Although noodle quality is not like Shangdong handmade noodles (my gold standard), it tasted more \"doughey\" and doesn't absorb too much of the broth.\n\nIn retrospect, though the No1DP and I liked our experience here, this restaurant is more suited for real dinner. Should we come back here I'd like to try more of their dinner dishes, especially their famed dungeness crab served in six different styles based on six regional Chinese cooking styles.", "author": "Isabella B."}

While this is by no means \"authentic\", it was an enjoyable meal and the food was definitely of a higher quality than your average takeout joint. The interior is beautiful with some upscale touches and the restaurant boasts ample seating with enough space for a dinner party or intimate seating for couples. The other couple had been here a few times and guided some of our ordering. We ordered:\n\n-Pork Juicy Dumplings ($9): Good soup dumplings, nothing out of this world. I would order these again if I were in the mood.\n\n-Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles ($16): Really good. This was the first split dish to \"go\". The flavors were great and not too greasy. I would order this for myself next time.\n\n-Chairman Mao's Chicken ($18): Not what we expected. The chicken was served with sauce on the side which is fine if an individual dish but to share was just a mess and there wasn't enough sauce. This was definitely the least favorite dish of the 4 of us.\n\n-Wok Seared Beef ($20): Quite good also. I liked the arugula with it as a different flavor.\n\nI will say, the one thing that was odd to me were the noodle chefs coming out in the middle of the dining room swinging noodles to \"Gangam Style\". I get that this is supposed to be fun but ultimately, I just felt bad for the chefs going through what seemed like a humiliating display. I felt somewhat uncomfortable during this, but maybe I am being a wet blanket.\n\nOverall though, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and the portions. The 4 of us could not finish this amount of food even though we are all big eaters. The service was also very attentive.

With that being said, my husband and I ate lunch at M.Y. China a few weekends ago after an afternoon of shopping and running errands. We had talked about checking out the restaurant on multiple occasions but rarely find ourselves at the mall. \n\nThe setting is pretty upscale given that it is in a mall, but it's not certainly a place I would get dressed up for. We started with two cocktails (greatly needed after traipsing through the mall). I had the Ginger Mist, and my husband had the Rum Blossom. Both drinks were well-balanced. For starters, we ordered the Shiu Mai and Pork Juicy Dumplings. They were very tasty, and on par with the dumplings that you can find in Chinatown. We also ordered the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, which was our favorite dish by far. I never had scissor cut noodles before, and I really liked the texture. I'm also a total sucker for anything with wild boar. The Sichuan Green Beans and Kung Pao Chicken dishes were fine, nothing super special. \n\nOverall, there are numerous places in Chinatown that I would prefer to eat at if I was craving any of these dishes, but it's a good option when you are in the downtown area. My only serious complaint would be the pricing. I found most of the dishes to be pretty overpriced, and thusly underwhelming (given the prices).

We were deciding where to eat for dinner.  It was either M.Y. China or Cheesecake Factory.  We decided to go to M.Y. China inside the Westfield Shopping Center on Market St. between 4th and 5th St. under the old Emporium dome on the 4th Floor.  \n\nI love watching Martin Yan's cooking show, Yan Can Cook.  Since this restaurant is Martin Yan's, I very much wanted to try the food for some time now hoping that the food is phenomenal and out of the ordinary.  I guess not because it was just mediocre.  We wanted so much for the food to be great.  \n\nM.Y. China's ambience is modern and trendy.  One can view through the glass of the open kitchen watching the chefs and sous chefs working.  \n\nThe menu is plain and simple and all the items are sad to say, overpriced. \n\nThere's also a SF Employer Mandates surcharge of 5% onto your bill depending on the amount of the food and beverage you ordered.  \n______________________\nFOOD:\nWe ordered three dishes among the two of us to share and were not filling and did I say overpriced already?\n\n - Hong Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken XO \u96de\u7403\u714e\u9eb5 $16.00.  \nIt was good and hot but average tasting.  I've had better in other restaurants which costs half the price.      \n\n - Mixed Greens with Papaya and Grilled Shrimp \u6728\u74dc\u714e \u8766\u6c99\u5f8b $16.00 with mango and birds eye chilies.  \nThere were only six thin slices of mango and six pieces of whole grilled shrimp on a bed of mixed spring greens.  The dressing was oily and no flavor.  Although the mango was soft and sweet, the whole salad was not worth $16.00.  It was a small portion.  We saw another one of the same salad which was a bigger portion so that's why we decided to order it.  When ours came, the portion size was not the same.  Not worth it.  Wonder if it's because it's just the two of us and we ordered three dishes that's why our portions are smaller.  I hope that's not the case. \n\n - Beef Noodle Soup \u725b\u8089\u6e6f \u9eba $16.00.\nIt's slow simmered short rib with baby bok choy.  It's a very small bowl and the ingredients only filled up like 3/4 of the bowl.  The flavor was good but there was not enough ingredients and it wasn't steaming hot.  Had better Beef Noodle Soup elsewhere.  \n_____________________\nSERVICE:\nWe're glad that our server was nice but he was semi attentive.  He did not even refill our bottle of water.   \n_____________________\nRESTROOM:\n - Restroom is Unisex.  It felt weird seeing men in the restroom together with the women.  Luckily, the restroom stall doors are completely tight.  The stall that I went to, the door lock was wet.  Eew!!!!!  Gross!!!!!  I wonder if it's someone's urine.  I definitely hope not because I touched it.  That was disgusting!!!!\n_____________________\n\nI wish I could give M.Y. China 5 stars but just couldn't.

China.\n\nI was back in SF for the American Counseling Association annual conference.  I was staying at the Marriott and wanted to have dinner with a dear friend who doesn't get Chinese food very often.  So, after searching through Yelp and my iPhone, I saw a review for M Y China.  My previous experience was underwhelming, but being a forgiving sort of guy, I thought let's give it another try.  I reviewed the most recent Yelp reviews and noted the items that were mentioned consistently as excellent.  Taking my list and my friend, we went to M Y China on a Sunday night.\n\nThe room has not changed.  Great decor, especially the wall of Buddhas.  I'm a martini drinker and they had a \"genever\" on the menu (a historical precursor to gin). I was impressed.  It was a Netherlands genever (Bols).  Very good start to the evening.\n\nWe ordered the Pork and Crab Roe Soup Dumpling as a beginning.  Wow!  5 ceramic spoons with a cucumber on the bottom (prevents sticking), delectable broth, and hot (temperature) in a bamboo steamer.  So flavorful!\n\nThen we had the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Baby Bok Choy.  Triple Wow!  Each was a unique and distinctive take on a foundational Chinese food.  The noodles were perfection with delicious wild boar, scallions, and mushrooms.  The shrimp dish had a hint of wasabi in it, not in the least bit overwhelming but additive to the flavors of the dish. The bok choy had a touch of fish sauce, a staple in southeast Asian cuisine, and a tremendous complement to the perfectly cooked crunch of the bok choy.\n\nNothing else.  One of the best Chinese meals that I have ever had.  And to top it off, the owner, Martin Yan, was there, going table to table to ask the diners if their meal was good.

There is an ancient bell decorating the bar and the kitchen is all glass and visible to diners. I was also impressed by the all-Chinese (or at least all Asian) kitchen staff, which made me think the food must be somewhat authentic :)\n\nCocktails are potent and beautifully presented - a bit on the expensive side $11-13. Wines by the glass are more reasonably priced. \n\nThe noodle dishes are some of my favs on the menu. The beef noodle soup is delicious and has been my go-to when I have pho cravings (hard to find pho without MSG and other unhealthy ingredients these days). The beef is extremely tender and a bit fatty, the broth is savory with a bit of sweetness, and you get delicious bok choy. \n\nThe total for 2 came to ~$70 for dinner, which is a bit pricey for 2 drinks and 2 entrees, but in my opinion, worth it for the high quality ingredients, amazing drinks and fun fast-paced environment.

She made a reservation for 10 people at 7pm.\n\nGrandma Wu's New Year Dinner ($38 per person for parties of 6 or more):\n*Fortune platter: roast duck, squid, jellyfish, cucumber, barbeque pork\n*Good luck soup: organic chicken, pork shoulder, dry seaweed, lotus root\n*Ocean treasure: oyster, seaweed, lettuce\n*Golden jade road: chicken, cilantro, beech mushroom, pine nut, bean sprouts, lettuce wrap, crispy wonton nest\n*Perfect catch: whole fish of the day, pepper, green onion, chili bean sauce\n*Happy opportunity: organic fried chicken\n*Long life: bbq pork, shrimp, pepper, beech mushroom, egg noodles, xo sauce\n*Child's delight: strawberry and pineapple tapioca pearl, blueberry, mango, pumpkin puree\n\nI'm off red meat for a while, so I wasn't able to taste the soup. But everything else was pretty tasty. (Make sure to ask for hot sauce if you wanna spice up your dishes.) The fortune platter had most things you'd find in a bbq platter on a banquet menu. I adored the roast duck and jellyfish. The ocean treasure is deep fried which I wasn't expecting. But the batter was nice and crispy. I love lettuce wraps, so I liked the chicken and mushroom wraps. The nest added a nice crunchy element. The whole fish was definitely a good size. I'm a fan of steamed fish with soy, green onion and ginger, so this was a little too heavy for me. Too much sauce. The fried chicken isn't the typical American fried chicken. More like a crispy chicken. And you can't have a meal without noodles! By now, I was getting super full, so I barely ate the noodles. They were al dente and had a nice chew. The dessert was something in between a palette cleanser and a shot of boba fruit smoothie. I thought it was a weird dessert.\n\nSelected New Year Wine ($25 per bottle or $8 per glass)\n*Prosecco, Gancia, DOC, Italy: fruity bouquet of golden apple and maple flavor x3\n*Sauvignon blanc, Joel Gott, Napa, California 2014: bright citrus aroma complemented by tropical note x2\n*Pinot noir, De Loach, Russian River Valley 2014: enticing with flavors of cherry, plum and rhubarb preserve x2\n\nAnd what's dinner without drinks?! We decided to take the suggestions from the CNY menu and order all the bottles offered. They paired well and were fairly priced. I do enjoy a crisper sauvignon blanc and a drier bubbly, but these were still pretty good. The pinot was light and fruity which is the opposite of what I look for in a red. But the menu had lighter fare, so it went well with the latter dishes.\n\nBeing located in a mall, I thought the food was going to be way more Americanized. It wasn't as American as I thought it'd be. And the price point was definitely a win. Dinner plus drinks, tax and a very generous tip worked out to $75 each. Not bad for a wine filled CNY dinner.", "author": "Elena N."}

Really wanted to like this place as I followed Yan cooking show as it improved my skills years ago... But it's very Americanized Chinese rendition.\n\nWon ton is small and full of fat, ditto for the shumai and far from excellent for the price.  Just go to millbrae for the real deal.  Kitchen at millbrae is 50% larger, juicy and tasty in contrast.\n\nEven with happy hour prices I don't think it's worth it for foodies.  The wings for example also pales when compared to angel wings in crunch or taste.\n\nOnly win here is the good alcohol drinks not found in Chinese restaurants.\n\nBritish word poser also appropriate in this target rich environment.", "author": "David H."}

MY China gets extremely busy during dinner time so if you plan on a day of shopping and dinner later, may I suggest booking an appointment (online)?  I did it with Open Table.  There was one occasion where we couldn't get in so either it was too late, to capacity, or just under forecasted how many diners there were going to be that night, but what they hey,\n\nAs we approached, there was a long line so I thought we would miss our reservation.  Happily, a greeter came down the line and asked who had reservations.  \"We do, We do!!\"  The hostess whisked us to a table that was waiting for us.  \n\nOur strategy was only to order what we could finish.  The other method is to order lots of things in order to get a taste of more things and take home leftovers.  But you know the old saw - \"You wok it, you eat it.\"  Its not quite the same after you get it home!  \n\nThe fare for the evening was:\nSeafood dumplings:  excellent, served over a sauce.  Good choice\n\nWok seared beef:  delicious;  served on a bed of arugula and IMO I think the dish could stand to be more colorful if they used some colorful garnishing.\n\nScallop fried rice:  an all time favorite\n\nAaaaaaaand.... the piece de resistance:  the honey walnut prawns.  My buddy ordered this and my first thought was \"but you can get this on Clement Street.\"  I'm glad I kept my mouth shut because there is a sublety to it that you can't get elsewhere.  We didn't first know what it was, but the wasabi gave it a kick in the pants.  It was served immediately after it was prepared because the prawns were still delicate and crisp after the sauce was laid on top.\n\nAlthough hectic, the staff was gracious and spot on.\n\nAt their Rohnert Park location (now closed ) I also liked their Kobe Beef Medallions.  At the time it was served in a basket made of deep fried rice noodles.  Love their Spring Rolls.  \n\nI do think a basic type of tea, for example Oolong or Bo Nay should be comped with a meal as with not so elegant restaurants.  The exotic teas are pricey so we opted with water.\n\nWill try other things in the future.\n\nIt IS an authentic Chinese restaurant because there are toothpicks at the front reception podium .\n\nps:  I don't know what's the big deal with Gai Lan.  Having had it all the time growing up, it is still sprouting out my ears.  Wont order that!\n\npps:  Check out the bathroom.  It is very elegant and progressive.  The main area is a long trough sink for all sexes for hand washing and primping.  There are 2 very private floor to ceiling stalls so that cures the 'bathroom conundrum' if there are gender issues.  (oh, I stand corrected: there are 3 stalls)", "author": "Kevin L."}

You will not find a cleaner Chinese restaurant in San Francisco. But I am sorry to say their food is horrendous. The wonton soup is salt water and the wonton had a skimpy filling with a thick wrapper. The Beijing Knife Cut Noodles wasn't very good. We also ordered the honey glazed walnut prawns. It was disgusting. Not crispy but gooey and way too much mayo. I cannot believe they actually serve this crap to people. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this tourist trap.

Yes.. a Native Chinese American person born in San Francisco ate at this Chinese restaurant at the mall............... I know.. I know..\nI hate myself for paying for overpriced Chinese food.. especially because Chinatown is like, a mere 15-20 minute walk away. I KNOW.\n\nBut, I trust my friend's taste. She comes here all the time with her mom when they go shopping. She said it was good! And, to be honest, it was better than I was expecting. Pricey? Yes. But I think it's fair for the quality of food and to be honest, most of these items are, in fact, a step up or slightly different than what you would get at a typical Chinese restaurant, so it's worth the extra.\n\nAND, hello, CLEANLINESS and convenience at the mall? FINE. Not to mention, it's beautiful inside and the service is amazing. AND they have happy hour?! (I need to return for happy hour for one of my shopping days! It's M-F 3-6)\n\nWe got the wild boar scissor cut noodles, dan dan mein, and string beans. They were all delicious and we got fair portions.. and even some leftovers!\n\nI would recommend this restaurant....... (/slightly hides in shame). But, really. This place is pretty darn decent.

China before and had met some of the staff. Chef Tony was kind of enough to prepare a special appetizer for our table that wasn't even on the menu!\n\nThe dishes are very large portions and best served family style. We order a couple of different dishes and shared them. While I am a vegetarian, the others in my party were very happy with their choices. \n\nWe ordered:\n-Forbidden Rice: very unique but delicious, great texture, best as a side dish. \n-Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: my boyfriend and his father raved about this dish. They dubbed this one their favorite of all that we ordered. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the texture was phenomenal.\n-Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood: this was my boyfriend's mother's favorite dish. She talked about it the rest of their trip. Very unique from other dishes but tasted excellent. \n-Mapo Organic Tofu: this was my personal dish. It was amazing. The sauce was spicy but not overwhelming. The tofu was soft and the texture was creamy. I loved it!\n-Kung Pao Chicken: not as special as the other dishes but I think it was just overshadowed by the unique dishes we had. This is probably a dish that would be a safe bet for someone less adventurous or willing to try something considered a traditional Asian dish. \n-Sugar Egg Puffs: yum! This might be one of my favorite dishes. Crispy but airy, this dessert was elegant to say the least. They come with a cream as well as a raspberry and chocolate sauce to put on the top. I still dream of these. A must. \n\nWe had a reservation. It is a popular spot but it seemed like people did not have to wait long to be seated in my opinion, based off the changing people around us. \nThe staff is so kind and we never once felt rushed or hurried through our meal. I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Taylor W."}

China totally won me over! I came here for lunch with a few of my co-workers. We were a pretty big party (7 people) with no reservation but it wasn't too crowded and we were able to get seated immediately. \n\nThese were the dishes I got to try:\n- Milk Oolong Tea: The name of it is slightly misleading. It sounds like a boba drink but it's actually regular tea with the slightest hint of milk in it! I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it.\n- Shiu Mai: Meh. Tasted okay but nothing spectacular. Probably wouldn't get it unless you're a huge shu mai fan.\n- Har Gow: Tasted decent, but again, nothing too special. Although I really liked the sauce they provided with it. Had a little bit of a spicy kick.\n- BBQ Pork Buns: I think the meat was a tiny bit on the dry side but overall I liked the seasoning and the texture of the bao.\n- Egg Custard Bun: This was amazing. A tiny bit on the too sweet side but otherwise I loved it\n- Honey Walnut Shrimp: the portion size on this was a bit disappointing given it's price point but the taste was amazing. A lot of times the shrimp coating is really soggy because of the sauce but they managed to retain the crispyness of the coating this time. Probably the best honey walnut shrimp I had!\n- Wild Boar Noodles: Note, I have no idea what the meat was suppose to taste like so I can't really commentate on that but the noodles (which I believe are hand made) were so good! It was similar to udon noodles but not quite as soft and a little bit thicker, so definitely a must try if you like thick noodles.\n\nOverall, slightly more expensive lunch/dinner location but not too bad for FiDi. Definitely would come back again, especially if I have dimsum cravings and don't want to walk all the way up to Chinatown", "author": "Cassie Z."}

Not too spicy and the sweet chili dipping sauce offers a nice balance to the spices. Second favorite was the shu mai. I loved the soy sauce dip.

Serving staff was also super friendly. \n\nNegatives: Service was slow & the fried tofu was too spicy. Seating was tight-- almost elbow to elbow with the table next to you. It's best to order all at once because the servers hardly come back to place your order. \n\nOverall, I enjoy the happy hour. It's M-F from 3-6pm. There isn't a wide selection of happy hour items.

He was secretly one of my favorite people on TV growing up.  There were not a lot of Asian people on TV period, and I just loved seeing him come on TV!  \"If Yan Can Cook, So can You!!!\"  Then I got a bit older and my Mom mentioned that she had taken a class from him when she was thinking about being a Chef.  ZOMG (before zomg was even a thing...I feel old...)\n\nOk, back to the review. I have been begging the man to take me here and finally we got around to it.  We really wanted to catch happy hour, just in case it was a case of \"not-worth-id-rather-go-to-chinatown-itis\".  The atmosphere is rather nice for being in a mall.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  I found that everything here was of a quality that made it worth a little extra cash.  The portion sizes were generous, and the happy hour prices meant it wasn't even a stretch.  \n\nThe hand pulled beef noodles were probably my favorite dish that we had.  Rich broth, tender (but a bit too much gristle) braised meat, perfectly cooked bok choy.\n\nThe Shanghai Dumpling/Soup Dumpling came way too hot to eat.  I was quite disappointed in these but found them overall satisfying.  They did not hold together if you tried to pick them up.  I think they know that their soup dumplings are not structurally sound because each one is served in a spoon.  I admit, Shanghai dumplings are hard to do right.  The meat and broth inside the dumpling was good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nBang Bang Chicken Wings were my least favorite dish.  The chicken inside was dry.  There was way too much sauce on them.  The sauce was very strong and overpowered any chicken flavor.  If you like really sweet slightly spicy and VERY sticky sauce, you will feel really happy that you can drink it off of a dry piece of chicken.  Like I said, not my favorite.\n\nBBQ pork bun (steamed).  This is a classic dim sum dish for all beginners.  It was really fresh and quite delicious. Fluffy with all the right flavors.  I'll give M.Y. a good grade on these for sure.  The man loved them.  I would love them if I hadn't eaten way too many BBQ pork buns in my years and years and years of eating dim sum--thus being generally biased against BBQ pork buns haha.\n\nThe drinks are more affordable at happy hour, but with the rise of the artisan cocktail movement, the bar (no pun intended) for a good cocktail is high.  I thought my drink was in the middle of the road..\n\nI really would like to give this place 3.5 stars but that isn't an option.  And I had a bit of a hard time going for 4 because I just reviewed Crystal Jade in the same Yelping session.  Now I'm second guessing myself am I even comparing apples to apples?  I hate when people Yelp comparing places that aren't apples to apples...  Ok, enough talking to myself.  \n\n3 stars for Mr. Yan!  It's a billion times better than your fast food chain venture...oh yeah, I remember that (feeling old again...)", "author": "Susan C."}

Location aside (it's in a mall), it seems authentic in some ways yet gives in to Americanization in others. We started with the Beef Rolls which were excellent. We moved on to the steamed tofu and broccoli rabe which was outstanding with unique flavors. It was very fresh and unusual in the Shanghai style. We moved on to the Pea Shoots. Very solid. Then things turned odd. The vegetable fried rice was a bit too greasy. It should have been called parsley fried rice as it lacked real veggies. Arriving at the same time was Chairman Mao chicken which I assumed was their stab at good old American General Tso. Hoping that it was prepared in the Chinese style of flash frying in the wok, we were disappointed to find deep fried white meat cooked to maximum dryness. It came with tasteless sauces on the side. A bigger disappointment was the whole Dungeness Crab which was severely over cooked. It had a very tasty rub but the meat was stringy and dry. Service was excellent however. With all the great Chinese choices in SF, we will pass on this for a return.", "author": "David M."}

Who knew? \n\nHad the pleasure of \"meeting\" Martin Yan a few years ago at a benefit in San Francisco. I say \"meet\" because he was mobbed by adoring fans from his PBS cooking days. Whether or not I knew exactly who he was, it was abundantly clear that he's a big deal.\n\nWhen our reservation for four at R&G Lounge over Thanksgiving was canceled due to overbooking, M.Y. China saved the day! All we wanted was some Dungeness Crab, and I recall someone saying that the offerings at M.Y. China were pretty good.\n\nOn Black Friday, this place was crazy busy! Luckily they honored our reservation and we were seated in the back dining room where it was still bustling but not overstuffed with people. Kudos to the front of house manager who gave us the ten cent tour while we waited for our table to be cleared/re-set.\n\nThe party of four ordered a bottle of vino, garlic crab, chicken noodles with XO sauce, pea pods... plenty for everyone! Once the bill came, I was worried that we'd overdone it, but split four ways it came out to $40-something each, plus tip. Not too bad for a ton of good food!\n\nSure, you're in the middle of a mall, but who cares? Good restaurants can be found in alleyways, strip malls, basements...

I brought him and our friend back for an early dinner on a Saturday and it was still pretty empty so we were seated right away. \n\nLet me start by saying the interior is incredibly surprising for being inside of a mall, and that's what caught my attention in the first place. It's reminiscent of something you would find at the Wynn in LV. When you walk in, you pass the chef's counter where you can watch them pull noodles and prepare your dish which is cool, but the more romantic dim-lit seating is in the back. \n\nWe ordered:\n- Wonton Soup\n- Chairman Mao's Chicken\n- Hong Kong Crispy Noodles w/ Chicken XO\n\nHonestly, the food wasn't bad but it was my least favorite part of this experience (along with the price). Although more innovative than P.F. Chang's, I felt the quality was about the same. The wonton soup was bland and unmemorable. The Hong Kong noodles barely had any sauce, and the XO sauce that was on it was overly fishy for me. The Chairman's chicken was definitely the best dish we had - it was spicy but incredibly flavorful. \n\nThe service was excellent, and not one of our water glasses ever came close to being empty. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other dishes, but if anything this place would be great for grabbing a drink or bringing a date - if they can get past the fact that you're eating in a mall.", "author": "Kate K."}

The restaurant is on the 4th floor of a nice shopping mall. It had the look and feel of an elegant upscale restaurant, and service was very attentive.\n\nAs appetizer, I ordered pork xiao long bao (called Pork Juicy Dumplings on the menu). I had eaten xiao long bao in Shanghai, China, at Din Tai Fung (California, Washington State, and Ontario), Asian Legend (Toronto), and at many lesser Chinese restaurants in New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington DC. Comparing with these, MY China's xiao long bao ranks at the bottom because its dough skin is too thick and there is very little broth inside the bao. After reading rave reviews about MY China's xiao long bao, for me the real thing was a disappointment.\n\nFor main course, I had the black pepper snapper with tofu. This dish was done well. What I found irritating was that rice did not come with this main course, and if I wanted it, it's another $2. No side rice for a $23 main course?

The portions are fine, for what you pay, but I get the impression they're pushing out dishes (and keep in mind it still takes a while to get your food) to hit quantity over quality. Noodles are not always cut in proportion, meat can be too dry, and some of the garnishments just taste off. Conversely, some of the meat is hella good (venison) and the appetizers are more reasonably prices and scrumptious (all the dim sums are winners).\n\nMy recent grievance that inspired this review lies in three factors:\n\n1) Long wait time even with a reservation and they initially forgot my soda (which is not the first time, maybe they just think soda is pedestrian).\n\n2) Crispy roast chicken was just bad, very dry, very bony, and the skin was too thin to carry much flavor. Salt plum seasoning is a curiously nasty move, tasted like cinnamon and cummin got into a death match, but initially it did help the chicken go down. I've had better for half the price.\n\n3) Bathrooms are gorgeous but the highlight of any restaurant should never, ever be taking a piss.\n\nTo end on a good note, the desserts are great.", "author": "First Name L."}

Would recommend making a reservation on OpenTable since they have a lot of available reservations but there was a bit of a wait for walk in.\n\nMy friend and I got: soup dumplings, wild boar noodles, sauteed beef, and the pork buns. Soup dumplings are really interesting here because they're served to you in a spoon, which eliminates the hardest part of eating a soup dumpling -- the part of picking it up. That being said, there was still not a ton of soup and the bottom of my soup dumpling was really moist... which was not pleasant. Not super delicious. The pork buns we had were solid, but like good pork buns anywhere. Sauteed beef and noodles were all decent, but nothing to rave about. \n\nOverall, the quality of the food is good, but these four dishes came out to be about $70-80 dollars which is ridiculous for lunch.

I read through all the Yelp reviews (especially from the Asians, sorry I am unapologetically biased here), and figured it was worth a shot since I didn't want to trek all the way to the Richmond -- my typical go to neighborhood for authentic Chinese eats.\n\nBut surprisingly, M.Y. China is pretty darn good. Like, I would return and even take my parents there good. I read up on what dishes were the favorites, and Yelpers didn't let me down. And I was pleasantly surprised to see a decent number of Asians eating at the restaurant too. But with the fully English-speaking waiter, they definitely are able to cater to the tourist/office/Westernized crowd as well. Let's just say I didn't place any of my orders in Mandarin.\n\nHere's what we chowed down on:\n* Wild boar scissor cut noodles: believe the hype, this noodle dish is legit. the perfect chewiness (QQ) to the noodles, good flavoring. Could it have done with more boar? yes, but that's not the point of this dish. \n* crab and pork soup dumpling: I love me some XLB. I was slightly disappointed by these -- loved the presentation but the skin stuck to the big red soup spoons and the meat filling wasn't as tender as I'm used to. the skin was thin, which was a plus, but I just expected more. \n* seafood dumplings: these come in a garlicky, slightly spicy sauce and were a delicious variation of your typical har gow/shrimp dumpling. I would get these again. \n* Peking duck: a solid dish. Their mantou steamed buns were perfectly light and fluffy and the duck skin nice and crispy. The duck meat was well seasoned and while a tad on the dry side, still well excuted. \n* Sauteed snow peas: dou miao is a go to for me, and this was executed fine. nothing mind blowing but just a standard garlic saute version. \n* Sauteed green beans: again, fine. a bit soggy but flavor was good. \n\nBy the end of the meal, there was nothing left between the three of us.

These ribs were fork tender, so they have been slow cooked, and they had been fried and dusted with a coating of spices and chili.  OMG!  The thai basil is more than a garnish.  It really added more flavor to the pork!  It was a generous serving of 5 large ribs.  \n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles -- Again, another good dish.  Perfect accompaniment to the bold flavors of the Pork Ribs dish.  Noodles were perfectly cooked and was not swimming in sauce.\n\nSugar Egg Puffs with Chantilly Cream, Chocolate Sauce and Raspberry Coulis -- perfect ending to a filling dinner.  The puffs were truly light and eggy!  My only complain is I wanted more Chantilly Cream! \n\nFor beverages, my husband had a glass of a dry Sauvignon Blanc from Charles Krug, and I had a glass of the Under the Bronze Bell cocktail.  St. Germaine and The King's Ginger are two of my favorite liquer, so I had to get this cocktail.  Yum!  We will definitely be back!  Both the service and food were great!", "author": "Hazel C."}

Let me start by saying that the only reason I visit this restaurant is because my husband loves their beef soup. With that said, we have visited this location multiple times and the service has been great. My husband is a veteran who suffers from PTSD and we have a service dog that accompanies him everywhere he goes. On all our previous visits we have never been isolated or discriminated against because of this. We have been sat in the main dining area with all guest of which they have never even noticed a service dog was under the table because she is trained to do a job. On this visit, we were sat in an isolated area with no one around us and midway through our meal, we noticed all the employees were eating in this area as well. 5 minutes into us sitting down, a random person who didn't identify himself (tall Caucasian guy) came over and said the following \"we are a pet friendly restaurant but we like to keep our pets separate from the other guests\". My blood was boiling after hearing his ignorant comment for which I told him, she is not a pet, she is a Service Dog performing a job. He still didn't get it. I would have gotten up and left but being 6 months pregnant  this level of ignorance was not worth my time. Maybe this employee/manager doesn't value the service my husband provided to ensure he had a job and felt safe in this country and maybe training needs to happen to tell the difference between a pet and working service dog. The food was amazing. But because we were in an isolated part of the restaurant service was not the same and we can observe the employees eating while we waited for our food. We even waited 10 mins just to get our check. I will stop my husband from returning to this place at all cost. I refuse to support businesses who don't know the guidelines of the customers they are servicing.", "author": "Cristina P."}

Whenever I have friends or relatives, I always give them a treat on this restaurant. For me, the food is great. But today, I was not happy with the way I was received by the hostess ( latin woman).  I said good morning to  her and she just looked at me and asked how many people in the party. Very cold way of accepting a customer. She seated us in the table for 4 and I asked if we could be seated in a bigger table because I know it will be cramped with the food I am planning to order for my guests. She said there were four of us so we can only seat in a table for four.  Well, our waiter was very nice to us and he was even the one who said that next time I should ask for a bigger table if I'm planning to order a lot of food so that we will be comfortable. To make the long story short, we finished our lunch and was satisfied with the food. I took the bill and paid with a 15% tip. I went to the bathroom and as soon as I got back to the table, our Chinese waiter was complaining to my guest about the tip. I then asked what it was and he said if I am satisfied with his service, I should at least give 18% tip. He was loud and I got embarrassed with the people who heard and to my guests of course. So I just gave what he wanted. It is just fine with  me but the manner of which he told me is what bothered me.  Does MY China require their waiters to do this?

If you don't know him, this guy can pay debone an entire chicken with a meat cleaver in less than 20secs. Tons of cooking shows over the years, one thing that keeps playing in my damn head is that stupid song associated with the make-shift flash mob commercial for Granite Expo (Martin Yan LOVES Granite Expo btw). Anyway, I've been a little reluctant to try this spot (a little bit because of that tv commercial, a little bit because of the location inside the Westfield Shopping center). In addition, I'm spoiled because my better half is Chinese from Taiwan and her mom can bang out the \"super authentic/non-American-ized\" menu. All I can say is.. I've been shortchanging myself. This is not \"upscalemall food! \n\nFOOD: Since it was our first time, we wanted to try a wide scope of the menu. Loved loved loved the \"Bang-Bang Chicken Wings\" (6 for $9) & \"Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders\" (2 for $8); only comment here, & this is my palate mind you, is that I didn't get the smoked flavor. I also wish there was a little more belly since there's only two per order. / Moving onto the Entrees, we ordered the \"Wok Seared Beef\" on arugula ($20). This was super tasty, but lots of arugula. We also ordered the \"Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood\" ($18) which was beyond good, as well as the \"Yang Zhou Fried Rice\" ($11); a little more pork please.. Rounding up the mains were two more: something from the \"specials\" for the night and a house-hold staple. The \"Eggplant Clay Pot with tofu and veggies\" ($12) was good, but the winner for the night was the \"Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp w walnuts, cumbers and wasabi\" ($23); just enough bite from the wasabi to open your nasal passages. Dessert: Sugar Puffs w. chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream, raspberry coulis (5 for $8).. Just the right amount. \n\nSERVICE: It's Monday night @ 7pm and the place is packed due to all the foot traffic from Oracle World down the street. Here I was thinking it would be easy/breezy/quiet to celebrate my wife's bday. Wrong. But here's where the surprises started. I mentioned that we were celebrating a bday in the OpenTable reservation and wanted a low-traffic spot in the restaurant to chow & enjoy each other's company. The hostess gets us in the perfect spot; close to the kitchen, but far enough away from the large group section. (Win). Then the shift manager Daniel comes up and hands us 2 comp glasses of bubbles and a bday card signed by everyone working that night. (Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat? I mean seriously, who does that anymore..). Now that is a testament to a smart manager going \"above and beyond\". Things like our water glasses were always filled when they hit the 1/2 way mark; An informed server that could provide suggestions and tell me why; Our dishes served hot and together, or one right after another. These actions aren't just reserved for dining at Gary Danko or Boulevard, they are the result of actions associated with a true service mentality and phenomenal venue management. (I'm speaking about Daniel). \n\nPRICE: This is San Francisco. Not much I can say that anyone reading this review will be shocked about when it comes to the price point for menu items. One thing to factor is to have an understanding of the \"cost\" per plate for the house -vs- menu price. An indicator is not only the overall portion for the order, but the amount of the premium element (how much beef to amount of arugula / how much seafood to noodles to veggies / how many shrimp to cumbers / how much pork in the rice, etc...). That being said, the price point for each item was affordable, but the main items were all a little light. Probably because of the rent they have to pay, which I'm sure is insane. \n\nAMBIANCE: This is where you're teetering on inside/outside dining that's not actually \"outside\". A few tables along the perimeter of the restaurant which you need to navigate to reach the check-in station. Nice bar along the right side, while a open kitchen layout with counter seating. Nice blend of 2 and 4 tops with very limited number of booths (which I highly recommend if you can get them). There's an overflow room in the back which is great larger groups, but be prepared to talk loud. Well lit, and spaced out so you're not rubbing elbows when you go for your napkin. All in all, a comfortable dining experience where I could have a conversation, sitting in a booth mind you. \n\nIf you haven't guessed, I'm a stickler when it comes to eating out. I cook, so I know.

But my mom really wanted to try this place and one should only rarely no to mom.\n\nSome of my initial fears were put to rest when I saw a healthy mix of young and old Chinese diners along with round-eyed diners as well. At least one waiter is bilingual. And just so I wouldn't feel out of place, some of the elderly Chinese customers were busy cleaning the plates and silverware set on the table. I've never understood this common Chinese practice growing up. I mean think about it, you clean the plates and silverware because you don't trust the restaurant to do it properly, what about the food itself? I guess you can take the person out of Chinatown but not the Chinatown out of the person.\n\nWe ordered the deep fried oysters in black bean sauce and salted egg yolk dungeness crab. \n\nThe deep fried oysters were very large and very fresh. Very clean tasting and the portion size was very generous.\n\nI really liked the batter on the salted egg yolk dungeness crab. A bit messy to eat and some manual labor is required but you will be rewarded with some really tasty bits of crab that is unique to dungeness.", "author": "Glen L."}

China with my former college housemate after sitting in the Metreon for a good hour trying to decide what to have for dinner only to resort to a random number generator. M. Y. China looks to be a fancy and modern Chinese restaurant within the busy SF Westfield mall with an open kitchen and a somewhat sophisticated yet comfortable ambiance.\n\nHaving decided to aim for a budget of ~$15 per person for this meal, we ended up ordering three dishes that hit exactly $30 pre-tax. We were seated at the counter facing the kitchen which was nice since I very much enjoy watching chefs at work, but it also resulted in some space issues when all the dishes to share arrived.\n\nWe started off with the Honey Glazed BBQ Pork which has five spice and sesame listed as ingredients. I found it to be about average as it simply tasted like regular bbq pork on a plate of honey. It's a solid choice if you happen to like bbq pork, but I would otherwise give it a pass. Next came the Mapo Organic Tofu and the Twin Scallops Fried Rice. These dishes were both executed very well and complemented each other to some degree. The tofu was at a nice soft texture with the gravy like black bean sauce which just had the right amount of flavor. The sauce wasn't all that spicy nor all that salty, allowing the tofu to really shine as the star of the dish. The scallop fried rice, though simple in concept, was clearly prepared with a great amount of skill. The egg white was neither too firm nor too watery and same with the rice. The dried scallop was all throughout the rice in thin strands with its subtle seafood flavor. I find that many Chinese restaurants fail to get this recipe done correctly and well, but M. Y. China shows they know what they're doing with this dish.", "author": "Joshua M."}

China is on the fourth floor of the Westfield San Francisco Centre on Market Street in the downtown corridor. It's is so centrally located that if you want to shop or watch a movie or theatre show or have an appointment at a certain time then this could be the option for you! This is the second time I have been to M.Y. China and I can honestly say I always want to go back for more! Now this is one of the higher end and some would say pricier options on the gourmet Chinese scale, but with recent San Francisco high profile additions like Hakkasan and Crystal Jade making waves and Din Tai Fung coming soon, I would have to say that M.Y China is one of the more pleasant surprises in the city.\n\nThe place is not perfect, but I have to admit the location, the overall food, and decent service was more than good enough to make this a must eat destination for any lover of high end Chinese cuisine. Whether you're taking family of friends, M.Y. China is one of the better San Francisco destinations, in a mall of course.\n\nMy friend and I got there at about 6pm on a Tuesday evening with an immediate appointment to see a movie at the AMC Metreon movie theatre across the street, so we knew we had to be out by 6:45pm in order to make our show. After being sat in the lovely open air area underneath the mall's dome, our server Oulu noticed our anxiety about timing and asked if we were in a rush. We said we were and immediately asked for recommendations. My friend really wanted M.Y. China's noteworthy hand pulled noodles but neither of us wanted soup. Oulu our server recommended the Da Dao \"Big Knife\" Fish Noodles which was served with shrimp, scallops, calamari, skitaki, enoki, jalapenos and XO sauce, as that was the only wok fried dish on the menu at M.Y. China that had the pulled noodles that didn't come with an additional charge. We then both wanted to try their Xiao Long Baos, otherwise known as their water dumplings. Oulu recommended we get the Juicy Dumplings in which you get 6 dumplings, (3 each of pork and pork and crab roe).\n\nOur meal came out in no time flat with plenty of time to enjoy the ambiance and the food while under the dome. Out first came the Da Dao \"Big Knife\" Fish Noodles which were tasty and piping hot with plenty of seafood and long long noodles. We had to ask for our traditional Chinese hot chili oil and paste to jazz up our meal. But I found the dish to be quite the delicious surprise, a bit on the greasy side, but that's to be expected with a wok fired dish. The real star was when the 6 Juicy Dumplings came out in a huge bamboo basket. Although they were very hot temperature wise, we had to blow on our customary soup spoon even after we doused the dumplings with red vinegar. The dumplings do stick to the spoon, which I expected with that much steam and warmth, and you had to break them into two pieces as bite into them. We found both found these dumplings filled with flavor and on the better side of the few dumplings I've had in the Bay Area.\n\nM.Y China was a great place for us to come to when you are in a rush and need to get a good meal in a bit of a rush. We finished our meal in under forty minutes! The food was unique and all-around delicious. The prices are not cheap but you do get what you pay for while you are here. (Our bill came about 38 dollars for just those two dishes.) This was my second time coming and now I want to return for a third time to try even more of their numerous noodle dishes and other small bites that M.Y China has to offer, including their Happy Hour! If you are looking for a good place to go to in downtown's Westfield San Francisco Centre, then M.Y. China is a decent, well thought-out option in which you should consider trying.", "author": "Jason F."}

Why not... It looked really nice on the outside.  Using the VERY helpful Yelp reservation App (Saved my bacon a few times in this city) I made my ressie for 7:15 pm and showed up RIGHT on time.  The hostess took my name, and I sat for about 5 minutes before we were shown to our table. \n\nThe place is something else. It is upscale, quite lovely and the decor is just grand.  It isn't what you expect for a mall eatery.  We walked past the open kitchen towards a table near the back and were seated. Our waitress Oulu came and took our drink orders, offering us either sparkling water or flat water.. we opted for the flat, which was served in a decorative glass long necked bottle. \n\nWhen she came back, about 5 minutes later, we knew what we wanted: The husband had a bowl of hot & sour soup and General Miao (?)'s chicken. Me, I ordered the Wonton Soup and the crispy baked chicken.  I was advised that the chicken would take about 20 minutes, if that was ok. It was.  We also ordered a pot of Jasmine pearl tea.\n\nThe soups were delivered separately, his first, mine about 4 minutes later.  The husband really liked his, mine.. it could have used salt or soy, neither of which was on the table. \n\nWhen the mains came out, same thing... separately, as if they were different courses, but I knew to expect that mine would be later.  The husband's food was beautifully presented. The red and green of the peppers contrasted prettily with the golden skin of of the chicken.  It also came with a couple of dipping sauces.  I was worried that it might be too spicy for me, but it wasn't.  It had really good flavour.\n\nWhen mine came out, it had been chopped prettily, a powered plum sauce was in a small dish and there was some chopped ginger off to the side. The chicken had a lovely flavour but it was a tad dry. I ate about 1/2 of what was on the plate, sharing some with my husband. \n\nWe opted for dessert, something we're not want to do often these days, but I couldn't resist the Sugar egg puffs with three dipping sauces: Vanilla bean whipped cream, Dark Chocolate and Raspberry coulis. LORDY! This was the highlight of the meal. They were light and hot, and the sauces, either alone or mixed really brought the whole thing to life. \n\nI might come back, the prices were a bit steep, but the flavours were nice.", "author": "Dianna B."}

That being said, now:\n\nDim sum: They have the best soup dumplings I have tasted in San Francisco city proper.  If you want to haul ass down the peninsula to Santa Clara and the like, yes you're going to find something better.  Here, they serve them steaming hot each in large oversized red ceramic spoons. The dumplings are adhered to the spoon with a piece of sticky flour, so don't try to pick them up, peel them off.  Just poke a hole and enjoy sipping and eating them from the serving spoon. They put a piece of cucumber on the bottom of each spoon that synergizes well with the oily soup.  Their other dim sum is decent, but their soup dumplings are the best over here.\n\nMain Dishes (meats, fish): I've tried and liked the Honey Glazed BBQ pork and  Tea Smoked Sea Bass.  Both dishes are very good, splurge on the sea bass if you're interested in seeing how fish can taste like fatty meat :3\n\nPeking Duck:  pass, go to excelsior's Beijing restaurant.  The duck here is old, dry and the rest is whatever.  Also they serve it with buns, not the pancake.\n\nOthers: Forbidden rice is crack. It's mixed rice (purple, wild, other) that is steamed and then seems to be lightly fried or tossed in sesame oil?  It's very fragrant. Another great thing is the garlic pea shoots (it's a side).  Priciest damn plate of greens ever, but they do pick very good quality greens, crunchy, tender and sweet perfectly stir fried with garlic oil.", "author": "Alice S."}

I ordered carb & pork dumplings, it came out 3 of the carb & pork dumpling and 2 of the juicy pork dumpling when one order supposed to have 5 of the carb & pork dumpling. I ordered shrimp & papaya salad, it came out with mango, not papaya. Seriously? Staff can't even realize what's different between papaya and mango? How about if I allergy for mango? If there is out of papaya, this is yours the responsibility to let customer know. I mean I feel like someone trick on me. I don't like business treats customer on this way.\nWith the comment below, I thought they take serious to read customer's comment.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-29", "description": "4.5 stars! \n\nFor a mall restaurant, this place is surprisingly exceptional. \n\nMy favorites are the spicy seafood dumplings, juicy dumplings and the honey walnut shrimp. The seafood dumplings come in this tangy, spicy sauce that I would put on anything and eat. The juicy dumplings are just really good xiao long baos, lol. An order comes with both pork with crab roe and pork dumplings. Personally, I prefer the pork to the pork and crab roe. Their dumpling wrappers are thin and soft, just perfect to hold all the filling in. Honey walnut shrimp can be found on almost all Chinese restaurant menus, but this place adds wasabi in their honey mayo mix that just takes it to another level, I LOVE it. I've also had the wonton soup, which isn't anything exciting, rather plain, but warm and comforting nonetheless. I can't wait to try other menu items, like the tacos and pork belly baos.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is clean and well decorated. Service is pretty quick and the servers are friendly. Depending on the time and day, there could be a wait, but I don't think it would ever be anything completely ridiculous. Regardless, I recommend making a reservation just to be on the safe side, especially on days the mall is the place to be.", "author": "Katherine L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-11", "description": "\"If Yan can cook, so can you!\"\n\nEver since I was a kid, Martin Yan's signature line has been burned into my brain.  However, being limited to just watching his TV show, Yan could cook it but I could never try it.  That is, until he opened up his restaurant in the Westfield Center.  So, after my friend and I found our original lunch plans thrown for a loop and seeing nary a line outside M.Y. China, we decided to check them out!\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the space was really nice, but I especially liked how our seats at the counter allowed us to watch the kitchen do its thing (I'd recommend it for small parties).  As for the menu, it was pretty cool how there's a mix of both traditional and more modern versions of Chinese dishes.\n\n- WILD BOAR SCISSOR CUT NOODLES with Wood Ear Mushrooms, Scallions and Shaoxing Wine...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#PoUjuaiGxLPP0O-AEjOu9w)\nWhile it wasn't bad, the dish wasn't all that exciting.  I liked the consistency and texture of the noodles, but the flavor could have used more of the boar.\n\n- WILD BOAR JUICY DUMPLINGS (4) with Ginger, Garlic, and M.Y. Seasoned Salt.....$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#td64XEqqhnqR7uy2OPzGqQ)\nThe wild boar was much more successful here than in the noodle dish.  Each dumpling was decently filled and the meat was pretty juicy.  I wish there had been more soup in each one, but the dish was fine otherwise (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#QJuydsrQplssABvejnUB6w).\n\n- M.Y. DIM SUM COLLECTION - Shiu Mai (2), Steamed BBQ Pork Bao (1), Multi Grain Rice (1), Har Gow (2), Seafood Dumpling (2), and Mongolian Beef Bao (1)...$19\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#E0RSyIwF0AnlEHexFCq0oA)\nYes, we knew it was expensive for dim sum, but it allowed us to try several more items in one dish.  Overall, it was underwhelming.  The Shu Mai was actually pretty good and the Har Gow and Multi Grain Rice were okay.  The two baos were pretty \"meh\" though and I didn't care much for the Seafood Dumpling.\n\n- WOK SEARED BEEF FILET with Sichuan Peppercorns on a bed of Arugula...$18\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#M1rnqAkCUOFl_f_VHfPGtg)\nEasily my favorite dish.  I feared the meat would be tough, but each piece was both tender and flavorful.  The beef combined really well with the arugula too.\n\nAs far as the prices go, it's undeniably higher here than at other Chinese restaurants in SF.  However, I'd be reluctant to say M.Y. China is \"overpriced\" since both the quality of the ingredients and the service are much better.  Plus, it's somewhat expected given the name above the door and their location (it is Union Square).\n\nMoney aside, the food itself was the bigger issue for me.  While the beef and dumpling dishes were good, the other two didn't do much for me.  Nothing bad mind you, but nothing amazing.  I wouldn't be opposed to coming back though...especially to try the Beef Noodle Soup (Niu Ro Mien) Erika C. tried!", "author": "Mike L."}

Being Asian myself, I was a bit skeptical about going to a Chinese restaurant for happy hour with coworkers. I thought, \"must be potstickers, small bowls of wonton noodle soups, small plates of fried rice and chow Mein\" Boy was I wrong! I got here in time for their happy hour menu. Ordered every thing on their HH menu which were $5 bites and $7 cocktails. Each plate was served pretty quickly. The waitress was super nice and attentive and came by a few times to refill our glass bottles of water and cups. The foods itself was superb!! My favorites were the octopus calamari, the spicy tofu, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings (huge shrimp portions) and the smackin' semi spicy fried chicken. The batter on the chicken was crisp with every bite. Absolutely loved it with their special sauce. Also ordered the Hong Kong style crispy noodle. This is a must try. The texture and taste satisfied my palates.\n\nDrinks- I had the Lan Kwai Fong drink. Forgot what it was made of but if you like something on the fruity side, give this drink a try. It was a unique flavor that i never had elsewhere. It gave me a really nice buzz. I also had a drink that the bartender name Derrick made. I'll call it \"Derrick's Special\" since that was his name. It was grapefruit and I think honey infused. Yummy!! \n\nThis is by far one of the best Asian fusion Chinese restaurants I've been to.

Sure the dim sum is 2-3x what you would pay compared to a Chinatown restaurant but it's the ambiance and service you pay for right? Well, at least that's what I kept telling myself while nibbling away on my $7 shui mai order. Order the BBQ pork. It's cooked perfectly with a honey glaze. A bed of soy sauce soy beans would complete the dish! The XO rice noodles was also a hit with my party as well. I think everyone voted it as the best dish.\n\nSo the tacos (mooshu?) just didn't hit the spot as the flour tortillas could have been easily replaced with maybe a thinner pancake or bun (like those used for Peking duck). The flavors of the filling were good though. Our party was partial with the pan fried noodles (dressing was a tad salty) and we were somewhat disappointed with the dan dan noodles (noodles were vermicelli-like rice noodles instead of thick noodles). \n\nNonetheless, I give this place 4 stars for offering a good food option beyond the food court. \n\nJust to put it out there.

I explained my food allergies of peppers, cayenne, chili powder and anything \"spicy\" to the waitress and was advised I could eat the fried chicken appetizer, rice and sweet and sour chicken.\n\nThe waitress brought the fried chicken wings and it was immediately obvious that it was covered in cayenne or chili powder with peppers on top of it. All of which I am very allergic to. The waitress apologized and promised that she would make sure it didn't happen again.\n\nShe brought out the order and promised it was fine as she had personally talked to the head chef and he was extra careful. I almost took a bite when my dining companions told me to stop because it had a ton of straight cayenne on it.\n\nI waited for 5 minutes and went to find a manager, I spoke with another waitress who said she was on break and would come see me shortly and took the wings for a second time.\n\nOur waitress came back apologizing again, and I reiterated my food allergies and that this was serious. She promised to make sure there was no more problems. She delivered the wings shortly after and the 3rd time, no spice, just incredibly over cooked.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-23", "description": "\"If Yan can cook, then you pay Yan.\" I assume that must be Martin Yan's hard-earned motto since he was truly one of the pioneer celebrity chefs back in the 1980's. I can barely remember when Yan hasn't been on TV with his congenial gumption and frantic chopping expertise. I have to admit I came to M.Y. China with a great deal of trepidation because as good as his dishes looked on PBS back in the day, I thought he may have passed the point of relevancy when it comes to fine dining in a city with as much food gravitas as San Francisco.\n\nHowever, Yan's elaborate operation on the 4th floor of the Westfield Shopping Centre holds its own in many respects (photo: http://bit.ly/11zPDlJ). It just fell short of what I was hoping it would be. Perhaps my expectations were escalated by the fact that I had experienced two failed attempts to dine here right after it opened - one time due to a private party, the other because they were just full up. I finally made it as a solitary diner and was seated at the end of the long noodle counter. The menu is not very complicated, and I knew from the hype that chef Tony Chu was known for holding the record of pulling 16,000 noodles in two minutes flat. Clearly this uniquely dexterous feat meant you had to try the noodles which I did.\n\nBased on Michael Bauer's recommendation on sfgate.com, I went for the $14 Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, which were definitely the high point of the meal - irregularly cut handmade noodles tossed with shallots and Shaoxing wine (photo: http://bit.ly/12E0Kwm). I liked the rustic quality, and they were flavorful enough with the pieces of pork-like boar. I just wish there were more ingredients tossed in for a greater contrast in texture and flavor. Probably out of curiosity more than anything else, I ordered the $9 pair of Mu Shu Pork Tacos, which were a cheeky take on the standard Mandarin dish that comes with a stack of crepes.\n\nWhat arrived was a pair of tacos held upright in a stand with the mu shu pork stuffed in soft shells that were definitely not tortillas (photo: http://bit.ly/ZLSoh9). The net result was tasty but sloppy as the sesame oil would dribble out of the taco shell and onto my arm despite the proper vertical head turning in eating them. My last dish was the rather ordinary $8 Stir-Fried Green Beans which I ordered to counter the carb overload (photo: http://bit.ly/15Dd8zr). The beans had the right snap, but they were on the saucy side with a slightly oily aftertaste. All in all, I liked the boldness of the dishes even though I found they still need more refinement in their execution to satisfy at least my palate.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...solid handmade noodles but the tacos were more a novelty and the green beans didn't need that much sauce\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...very dramatic, a good use of the space underneath the dome...but it did get lonely being the only one eating at the counter (photo: http://bit.ly/17TXZtf)\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive and helpful, no problems there\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if Yan can cook, then I pay Yan...simple as that", "author": "Ed U."}

Couldn't hear anyone except those to my left and right.\n\nSo the good news first\n\nPLUSES: interior - beautiful, modern Asian\n\nAnd now the bad news \nMINUSES: Service\nI am sure the wait staff are all very nice people, but I think they lack training of any sort. Several ordered dishes never came, our wine came out warm, plates were not cleared out promptly, and there was no attempt to explain our dishes when they were brought out. Even the wait staff appearance was slobby - the uniforms looked rumpled and unstylish. We asked to speak to the manager about our meal, and he arrived at our table looking like he just came from Gold's Gym - dude, put on a jacket, tight tees are so cheesy. The waitstaff and manager behavior are very \"dude\" and do not fit M.Y. China. \n\nMINUSES: FOOD\nBut the biggest problem with M.Y. China was this food... When I read the Yelp reviews I assumed the mediocre reviews were non Chinese folks who were not used to true,, authentic Chinese cuisine. I was wrong....  The poor reviews were because the food just sucks. \n\nMaPo Tofu - This is NOT mapo tofu, not at all spicy, but just soft tofu swimming in over corn-starched brown limp sauce. WTF.  It was a terrible, terrible joke. Grade: F\n\nKung Pao Chicken - WTF...  this was NOT kung pao chicken. Why were there big chunks of chicken breast blandly deep-fried and thrown with other individually fried, tasteless chilis?  A waste of ingested calories. Grade: D\n\nSweet-and-Sour pork - by the middle of the meal, we surrendered and started ordering American Chinese food. But unfortunately big chunks of fried pork with tasteless sweet sauce was yet another disappointment. Panda Express is better. Grade: D\n\nHandmade green dumplings: ick. lukewarm swimming in a rather bland spicy, vinegar sauce.  Not sure what the filling was but the dumpling skin was WAAAY too thick. Grade: D\n\nSkillet lamb: meh...  cut lamb stir-fried with green onions. I have had WAY better. Grade: C\n\nHand-cut noodles: weird.... slightly overcooked - just past al dente, again flavorless Grade: C\n\nFried Tofu appetizer - best dish of the evening. The tofu quality is great - soft and tasty...  This tofu was deep-fried and covered with a red chili powder. We ordered 2 of these as they were the only decent thing on the menu.  Though the tofu was delicious, the powder was not quite right  Grade: B\n\nWasabi Walnut Shrimp - the shrimp itself was plump and fresh. The mayonaise, wasabi sauce - ick. And why throw in the raw cucumbers.  Why?  Grade: C+/B-\n\nI don't have a problem with Americanized-Chinese food - I can appreciate a P.F. Chang's, but M.Y. China was just so wrong. We had such high expectations for this restaurant - hoping it would be a higher-end Chinese restaurant experience. WRONG, the service is just not crisp, kinda \"luan qi ba zao\" (Chinese for lack of structure, \"messy\") and the food is worse than Panda Express.\n\nThe one positive of this restaurant is the ingredients. The quality of the ingredients seem very high - extremely fresh...  But it couldn't compensate for the lack of quality in the cooking and/or recipes.\n\nOne more thing... Martin, no more of the pull noodle chef dancing around the dining table with a chintzy iphone/speakers on his waist playing Gangnam Style. The dancing chef just isn't appropriate to the restaurant or Valentine's Day.", "author": "Madison W."}

We sit down, and then we wait another 10 minutes, just so we can order a drink. We finally order a drink and our food. They bring us a soup, but no bowls or spoon so we can both eat, 5 minutes later we get the acknowledgement from a waiter to bring us some bowls. I am not exaggerating about the time here. We get our check after dessert, and it takes another 10 minutes for the staff to realize that we are ready to pay. We kept seeing everybody get red envelopes when they would get their bills, when we acquired about it, he said oops forgot to give you one. I am so disappointed in this restaurant staff, the food was ok. And I was super excited to try it, being that I grew up seeing Martin Yan cooking shows with my dad.

We were seated immediately, 20 minutes later the server took our drink order, at which point I order 3 items.  When she brought our drinks 15 minutes later (mind you we have been sitting for 35 minutes), we ordered more food.  After ONE hour we had only received the last thing we ordered, when we asked for our food (we asked 3 different employees) we received apologies. Eventually we received all of our food.

China a fourth star......\n\nThe cocktails were fabulous--The Monkey Prince and East Meets West reminded me of cocktails that you might have at Bourbon and Branch--especially the bourbon based Monkey Prince--I had 2 of those!\nIt took a while though to even get recognized or greeted at the bar by the nice barkeep.  It was definitely not intentional but he was just another example of a server who was absent in mind and spirit.  He couldn't even remember what scotch they had at their bar for the guy sitting next to me who inquired about single malts.  Not good. Not good.\n\nWe sat at the bar because we were told to wait there for our table by the pleasant but absent hostess.  She told us to wait there because we were early for our reservation but \"not to worry\" because she would come to the bar to get us when our table was ready.  On my way to the cool. unisex bathrooms, I counted 4 empty two-tops that we could have been seated at immediately.\nWe were on our second cocktail by then and I decided to recheck in with her to see if our table was ready.  When she asked me my name, I knew that she had forgotten us -and sure enough,  we were brought to one of the 4 empty two-tops.  The guy who seated us made sure to tell me that, \"it wasn't intentional--they were so busy tonight.\".  Guess what?  I don't care.  And, we had to settle our bar bill first--they wouldn't transfer it to our table.\n\nOur server was so nice--she recommended that we only order a single serving of rice because of the amount of food that we had already asked for....but...guess what? --she forgot it!   Everything came out except the rice.  I had to walk over to her and ask her for the rice--she forgot to put the order in.\n\nAll of our food came out haphazardly except for the Dim Sum which came out first.\nThat was by far the best dish of the evening--we had the Pork & Crab Juicy Dumplings. \n\nWe ordered two noodle dishes: Hong Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken and Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles.  Both were very good--I wished there was more of the wild boar though in that one dish.\n\nFrom the wok, we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken.  It needed more flavor--the heat was nonexistent.  \n\nWe finished dinner with Sugar Egg Puffs.  They were served with chocolate and raspberry sauces in addition to vanilla flavored whipped cream.  These were a highlight of the meal.  They resembled large beignets coated in sugar that were supposed to be dipped into the sauces and cream.\n\nYes, I would love to go back to M. Y. China.

There was eating too but that part is a bit fuzzy. \n\nThey have a bunch of special cocktails, including ones crafted with sake, soju, or Chinese baijiu. However, the bartender needs to learn to understand Erguotou when I say it. If I just order \"baijiu\" (literally white liquor) as they understood it, it would be like me ordering just \"whiskey\". Which whiskey? Exactly. Which baijiu? Erguotou isn't even a brand; it's to baijiu like rye is to whiskey. \n\nNow that that is out of the way, I must commend them on including the famed Chinese liquor. I recommend trying a shot of it on its own - sip it and taste it. Most people dislike sipping it but then it can be said for some whiskeys.\n\nThe food was pretty good, as I remembered it. They were in nice presentations (for example, the individual spoons the XLB was served in), and I think it will please most people, while not being too pricey considering the atmosphere and the classiness of the restaurant.\n\nIf you're here without a reservation, do consider sitting at the bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-19", "description": "Having passed by Martin Yan's restaurant several times on my way to the movie theater in Westfield Mall, I was always curious about this place. For Chinese New Year my family and I wanted to celebrate at R&G lounge, but unfortunately it was completely booked up the whole night. So we settled on with MY China instead. We made reservations online using OpenTable, and surprisingly it was completely open ended.\n\nArriving at the restaurant 15 minutes early, we were in for a different surprise. The restaurant was packed and there was no available seating inside the restaurant. We asked about our reservation for 7:15. The hostess asked us to please wait a moment. From my quick understanding it seems they were inundated with last minute guests and did not bother to reserve seating for the guests who made reservations. An automatic star downgrade in my book. The hostess made us wait for another 15 minutes. We asked again about our table, and she said oh what is your name? SMH, we've been standing here for 15 minutes and we just talked to you. They in between seated a table of 8 people who had no reservations. They offered to put us at a table out of the way and on the outside, after we complained lightly about getting the 5 minute wait end around.\n\nWith that out of the way, the service was a lot better. Our waitor Bolo, did a great job discussing the menu with us and treated us with great care. The food was all delivered to our table very quickly. Can't fault that table service.\n\nThe food itself was reasonable, but not spectacular or of great value. We had the following dishes:\n\n+ Steamed Seasonal Fish - ***/5 - The portion was a bit too small. We wanted a whole fish with the head and tail in tact specifically for Chinese New Year, but they could not accommodate this because we were not a table of 6.\n+ Wok Seared Beef - ***/5 - Pretty standard wasn't absolutely wowing me.\n+ Whole Crispy Roast Chicken - ****/5 - pretty decently cooked, very moist cuts and everything tasted great, they even provided 5 spice dipping powder on the side.\n+ Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles - **/5 - not a fan of this dish, not enough chunks of the boar meat, and the noodles were a bit odd in texture.\n+ Garlic Pea Shoots (Dau Miu) - ****/5 - pretty simple, nicely done, and at standard.\n\nOn the outside, the restaurant looks very extravagant, modern and upscale. It just did not live up to the expectation that I had in terms of quality for the value. I understand that the place they are in is high rent for the sq/space. But I'm not sure I would come here again, if there were other dinner options for Chinese fare, but this was Chinese New Year. Happy Year of the Ram!", "author": "Michael C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-03", "description": "We were people-watching and window shopping at the Westfield Mall when we happened upon M.Y. China. We just finished a modest lunch at Super Duper Burgers a little over an hour ago so we certainly weren't hungry. However, we decided to go in just for a quick bite of dessert. We ended staying 3 hours. Our only excuse is we had just seen the 3rd Hobbit movie at the Metreon. In the spirit of Bilbo and hobbits everywhere, we ended up having a second lunch. \n\nWe ordered juicy dumplings and half a Peking roast duck. The dumplings were certainly juicy. The skins were very thin and delicate. We enjoyed the all pork filling more than the pork and crab roe combination but both kinds were delicious.\n\nThe duck served was just the breast meat. The fat was properly rendered leaving the meat moist without being greasy. The crackling skin was crispy and a delight to consume. At $20 we first thought it was expensive for just half a duck but because the duck was boneless and very meaty, we were able to consume the whole thing without any waste. It was a very good deal.\n\nFor libations, we ordered a mai tai and a Stella Artois cider. The mai tai was yummy and very well made. The cider was smooth and complemented the duck beautifully.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the sugar puffs or Chinese donuts and the black sesame ice cream. The donuts were warm and came with chocolate sauce, raspberry coulis and sweetened whipped cream. The ice cream was delicious and the flavor was a nice change from the ubiquitous green tea. Both desserts were yummy. We loved the thick, rich chocolate sauce but the best thing was when we stuffed the donut with the ice cream.  \n\nThe food was very good, not transcendent, but very good. What put M.Y. China over the top was the kitchen staff. We were seated at the chef's table. It is a counter facing the wok station of the open kitchen. Now I don't like sitting with my back to a room. I don't know, maybe I was a gangster or gunslinger in another life. My initial wariness quickly gave way to delight as we watched the busy cooks chop, fry and assemble food for the restaurant. \n\nWatching the food being prepared was actually what persuaded us to order more than dessert. We saw a fresh duck being pulled from the fryer. The golden, glistening skin just seduced us. The cook was also good at theater. We really couldn't carry on a conversation because the place is really noisy, but he really made a production of cutting and plating up that duck when he saw us watching him. Well after that private cooking demo, we just had to order that canard.\n\nThat same station prepped our dessert. By this time, we had been there for so long that a second cook had taken over the spot. We established a rapport and jokingly told him that while the donuts were delicious, serving 5 pieces really wasn't any good because it left an odd donut out. How would we divide this dessert fairly? The next thing we know, we were served a single donut stuffed with strawberry ice cream. \n\nGood companionship, great conversation, delicious food and engaging kitchen staff made this an awesome dining experience. The $$$$ bill didn't even phase us. (Well it did, we only realized afterwards that we could have save some bills by ordering from the happy hour menu.) The price will prevent this place from being a regular dining spot. We will be back, though I know it may be difficult, if not impossible to recreate the same conditions for another perfect meal.", "author": "Cece E."}

I wasn't fond of the pungent Chinese mustard in the mayo as it overpowered the delicate sweetness of the shrimp.\n\n*Braised Short Ribs in Clay Pot ($25) - 2.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/YQGvLA\nI love rustic Chinese clay pot short ribs but this was disappointing.  The ribs weren't in chunks but rather sliced like thin cuts of steak and needed to be cooked down more as there wasn't a melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. It was also very bland.\n\n*Forbidden Rice ($8) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/V7QdDE\nLoved this dish. The combo of brown rice, wild rice, corn and goji berries made it a savory and slightly sweet sensation.\n\n*Purple Yam Croquettes w/ Almond Ice Cream ($8) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/10o33nr\nSweet purple potato with a sweet condensed milk center rolled in crunchy slices of almonds served with a nutty, creamy sweet ice cream?

Like, loved it so much we took our out-of-town relatives (my very Chinese cousins who prefer to eat Chinese food whenever they can) here for dinner, and they loved it too.  Sure, some of the items (and prices) are clearly catered towards the more westernized taste, but the wild boar scissor-cut noodles won everyone over, along with their juicy dumplings (xiao long bao).  We even had the pleasure of meeting Martin Yan on one visit and were thoroughly thrilled.\n\nFast forward two years, and we decided to come back here one night after my volunteering shift in Union Square ended.  We ordered the Juicy Dumplings (6 for $16), which yes, is expensive, but whatever, we expected that, the organic crispy tofu, wild boar scissor-cut noodles, and the wild boar rice cakes.  Slightly disappointed that they changed their menu and had gotten rid of some of our favorites, including this appetizer sampler, but we mostly came for the scissor-cut noodles.\n\nOur waiter asked if we wanted the pork dumplings, and we said yes.  He took the rest of our order, and then the tofu came up first.  It wasn't that crispy; in fact, it was bordering on gummy.  Pro tip: don't lick your lips after you eat this, because your lips will be on fire, even though the tofu itself isn't that spicy.\n\nWe then received the noodles (still delicious), and when our dumplings came out, there were only 5.  I flagged down a waiter, who said that they had actually changed their menu and now it was 5 dumplings for $8.  So.. they changed it but didn't update their menu.. ok cool..  He said that our waiter was supposed to explain that to us, but obviously that never happened.\n\nPork juicy dumplings were too sweet, and they put it on a spoon, which the skin stuck to and broke.  At least the broth was contained in the spoon, but still, disappointing.  The rice cakes were also incredibly disappointing - overly sweet.  I took one bite and pushed the plate away.\n\nProbably won't be visiting MY China again.  Sorry not sorry.", "author": "Tori S."}

Having had M.Y. China a few times on a weekday occasion and not been disappointed in the food, I suggested we go there because the Dome is cool and She always wants Chinese.\n\nWe walked right in and were seated right next a few other couples that were obviously recently seated as well, though I recall seeing other tables available.  So the inevitable happened; we were flagging down a very flustered waiter who was paying attention to the 2 large parties but we were flagging down Bussers just to get some water 10 minutes in.  Waiter was slammed (bad Host skills) but he wasn't doing a good job.\n\nI ordered a Nixon's Visit and she had a Perseco and we would split a pot of tea with our meal.  The Tea came out first, then her Perseco immediately thereafter, whereas I had to wait for my cocktail until 5 minutes after our food arrived and She flagged down the Manager.\n\nThe food is good at M.Y. China for the most part in terms of the menu offerings but the execution was off today.  Boar Lettuce cups were way overdone compared to how they've come out in my previous visits. The Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) was really undercooked as was the Chinese Sausage that comes with it.\n\nA different kind of problem we had with the meal was  that the \"Crispy Organic Tofu\" and the \"Salt and Pepper Chicken wings\" are heavily doused with the same exact seasoning, and with no indication from the menu or our waiter. On the Tofu we found it too spicy for the subtle protein (though we like really hot food), and it didn't add anything to the Wings, which were unlike any we have had before with the same title.  And we always get \"The Wings\" when we go out!\n\nThe Fried Rice is good though and was the saving grace of the meal but that's not really a compliment.  The Wok Seared Beef was also good and I liked the Arugula as an addition to the dish.\n\nFor $90 I felt like I'd been played like a Shmuck. I'd come back here in a pinch ( if it was not crowded! ) but it was not the stellar meal spot to kick off an epic day of shopping with the Ms. SO.  #NotMYChina", "author": "Lee S."}

He had his own cooking show on PBS during the weekend's called 'Yan can Cook\" and his motto was \"If Yan can cook, so can you!\"  He was one of the original celebrity chefs back in the days... we just didn't label them with such a status back then...  And though I am Chinese and eat Chinese food and am Chinese 2nd gen, I always thought Martin Yan was cheesy.  But as cheesy as I think he is, I still wanted to eat his food.  With the opening of his restaurant, this was my chance to finally eat what he cooked up on PBS.\n\nI talked my co-worker into going with me to eating dumplings here.  I felt some hestiation from her part but was glad she gave in.  Upon entering the beautiful mahogany modern and chic decor, we instantly noticed that real live Chinese people were staffed in the open kitchen! Yes, that was surprising to us and it gave hope that Martin's restaurant would taste authentic.\n\nHere's what we ordered...\n\nIMPRESSIVE:\nWild boar juicy dumplings (aka.  Xiao long bao) - it was hot, full of good flavor soup inside, good ginger vinegar dressing, great presentation.  But I'm not sure if wild boar tastes better than pigs ?!?  It's probably a marketing thing to name the dish after a boar instead of calling it pork.\n\nOKAY:\nPork belly sliders - the pork melts in your mouth but I wish there was a side dish of hoisin sauce.\n\nNOT IMPRESSED AND TOOOO SPICY:\nBang bang chicken wing - too tangy, too spicy, and definitely not my tastebuds style\nDan Dan noodles - served cold and I think it was missing salt because it just tasted like bitter vinegar.  And it was way too spicy!!  \n\nDISSATISFIED:\nMacau Egg Tarts - it was not hot enough, not sweet and creamy enough, and the crust was kinda soggy.  Macau egg tarts should taste similar to crembrulee in a buttery flakey crust and more importantly, served HOT. This was more like a regular day old Dan tat with an unsuccessful attempt to heat up in a toaster oven.\n\nThe waiter never came back to check on us. If she did, I think I would had sent the Dan Dan noodles back. And though I knew the prices are high and I knew I had to pay these high prices, I was still unprepared for the final bill... for the most part, we paid to sit around beautiful decor only.  Just like the Martin's television show, the food looks good and maybe that's where I should had left it... in TV.", "author": "Jenny T."}

It turned out surprisingly impressive!  Nice ambient with vibrant bar scene.  I like the wide counter with an action hand pull noodles station behind it with the chef in demonstration.\nI even did not expect to see Chef Martin Yang but he was there right when I walked by the counter when he was explaining to the guests by the hand pull noodles maker.  He encouraged everyone to touch the freshly made noodles to feel the fine texture, and he brought out the noodles on a wood stick to give everyone a closer look and photos opportunity.  It was a very nice treat.\nWe ordered the \"Dim Sum\" sampler consisted of varieties of steamed goodies:  4 kinds of dumplings, BBQ pork bun and sticky rice.  Braised beef with hand pulled noodles soup.  The \"Dim Sum\" items were good, the beef noodles soup was delicious, the beef was tender.  \nWhile we were eating, Chef Martin Yang came to meet and greet a few tables by the mall.  We were very delighted to be able to chat with him and snap more photos with him.   When my griend mentioned anput the Dim Sum at Yeung Shing,  another upscale Chinese restaurant in downtown San Francisco, Chef Yang told us this restaurant attracts more Chinese customers than the other one for his menu has more authentic cuisines from different continents in China.  He explained to the table next to us about the beef noodles soup, not only the noodles were hand pulled, also it took 6 hours to slow cook the beef and the broth, that's why it tasts so good and the beef with such melt-in-the-mouth tenderness.  \nWhen we asked him what was his recommendation  of a specialty om the menu, he suggested us to tey the crab meat with pork juicy steamed dumplings (shiao-lone-bao), of course we followed his advice to order one.  They were very delicious and I like each of the dumpling placed in a soup spoon because there was broth inside each dumpling and sure not to waste it.\nOh, you got to have one of the Oolong tea because it was a special blend that has a milky flavor but there was absolutely no milk in it.\nOverall it was a very pleasant dining experience and of course the bonus was to meet Martin Yang. So even the food ws pricy, but it was not that bad considered in the high price location.  I would like to visit again to tey other items on the menu.", "author": "Patricia W."}

China. \nI did my Yelp research beforehand so I knew that:\n\na)  they are located in a mall and\n\nb)  it's a Martin Yan restaurant and \n\nc) the quality of the food was going to far exceed typical mall fare.\n\nNo reservation needed, just strolled in and got seated right away.\nNot great ambiance or decor, at least not evident in the section we sat in.  \n\nAll the food on our table was delicious--except the potstickers.  Big letdown for me, especially given the fact that so many reviewers recommended these.  I spent 15 years living in Japan and as most of you probably know, they have their share of potstickers.  In fact, in Japan you can find restaurants that specialize in potstickers and that's all they serve. So I know potstickers. At M.Y. China, each potsticker comes in it's own oversized soup spoon - you know the white, plastic ones you use to eat your hot and sour soup.  First problem, they potstickers are dried and stuck to the bottom of the spoon.  So when you go to eat it, it rips.  Can you you say \"epic failure\"?  Then, problem number two is the filling.  It's this over-processed mush of a mixture.  The texture was so off-putting, I could only take one bite.  It had the texture of the meat balls that you find in pho - hard and rubbery AND GROSS. :)  Maybe I got a bad order?  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since all the other food on our table was fantastic.  \n\nCALAMARI (5/5)  LOVED their version.  Lots of tentacles.  Batter was perfect.  Could eat 6 baskets of these.\n\nSTEAMED LOBSTER W/FRIED GARLIC (5/5)  Maybe the most delicious lobster dish I've ever had.  That is HUGE for me to declare since I'm an Italian from Boston, born into a lobster-loving family and have been eating lobster my whole life.  If you are a lobster lover--try this dish.  I will return to this restaurant for this dish alone.\n\nSHRIMP AND PAPAYA SALAD (5/5) My wife's order and she loved it. I took a bite and I liked it a lot.\n\nPOTSTICKERS (1/5) Sad, sad details above.  :)\n\nWe asked for hot sauce and they brought out a wonderful chili oil.  So good, that I wish I had the mind to ask if they sell it.  I bet they do.  \n\nM.Y. China met our expectations and I don't think this place is over-hyped.  I've read a few Yelp reviews that go on and on about how it's not authentic Chinese food.  Here's what I think. If it's delicious, who cares about authenticity.  My wife is from India and we love authentic Indian food, but we love the Japanese version of curry rice.  It's completely inauthentic but it's delicious in its own right!  If all food had to be authentic, think of how many tasty, fusion-inspired dishes would be lost!  Instead of thinking of a food as \"inauthentic\", how about taking a chill pill and thinking of the dish as a different version.  \n\nPeople who can't think out of the box are some of the most annoying people I know.\n\nThat officially ends my rant about Yelpers who cry foul over inauthentic food. :)\n\nCompletely and whole-heartedly recommend M.Y. China.  Would like to go there right now in fact!", "author": "Darien R."}

Not to mention that you are also paying for ambiance and location. I should also mention that I am an SF local who grew up both in the sunset district and richmond district and have eaten my fair share of authentic Chinese and asian cuisine so I am judging the place, not based solely on the price but rather how authentic the flavors and styles are. \n\nI have been here a total of 4 times, twice with my hubby, once with a friend and once by myself. I enjoy sitting where you can watch the chefs cooking the food. I should mention that I am familar with Chef Martin Yan, as I did grow up watching his cooking chows on tv and he was probably one of the first celebirty chefs on tv. I have yet to meet him myself but that of course would only be an extra special treat! ;)\n\nSo here are my personal recommendations:\n\n*Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles \u91ce\u8c6c\u5200\u526a\u9762 14-\n Almost reminds me of a chow fun but with smaller, fatter noodles but that nice rich oyster flavor. I do think for the price it could use a bit more noodle and perhaps another vegetable.\n\n*Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup \u725b\u8089\u624b\u62c9\u6e6f\u9762 14-\nAlthough, I have had this soup at a few places already, what really made this one amazing was the tenderness of the beef and how it wasn't chewy or fatty, the noodles were perfectly chewy and the broth was well balanced (although, I wish there were a tad bit more broth than noodles)\n\n*Sichuan Green Beans (v) 8-\nAgain, a common dish, however, I highly recommend this as a vegetable side due to the the green beans being perfectly crisp, not soggy at all and the sauce is delicious. This one is actually a decent portion where two of us were able to get full.\n\n*Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders (2) \u8336\u9999\u8c6c\u8169\u5305 8\nProbably my favorite appetizer ever-perfectly steamed buns with just the right amount of tender pork belly and complimented with pickled daikon and veggies and a  slightly zesty peppercorn oil. I wish there were at least 3 of these included for the price though.\n\n*Honey Glazed BBQ Pork \u8702\u871c\u53c9\u71d2 10\nMy China's version of \"char sui\" and this one isn't the least bit fatty or chewy. It's thinly sliced, honey kissed and just PERFECT if you are into meat (which I rarely am but actually enjoy eating this) \n\n*Twin Scallops Fried Rice \u53cc\u8c9d\u7092\u98ef 10\nI know this is just fried rice but they do it so well in this case and you do taste some of those scallops. It's a great \"filler\" dish if you just want to get full and save money.\nI also highly recommend just pairing this with the \"honey glazed BBQ pork\" for a satisfying meal. \n\nTIP: Come here during lunch on a weekday for better service and no wait! ;)", "author": "Petra S."}

It was not crispy enough, the skin part was way too thick, and the meat was reallyy itty bitty and not very juicy at all\n\nHong Kong Crispy Noodle: They did an okay job of this dish, but it could have been more flavorful. And it tasted a bit on the heavy side, but I guess you can't really expect otherwise with a fried noodle dish. \n\nSpicy Seafood Dumplings: This was the star of the meal for me. The skin was again, too thick for my personal tastes. But, with that being said, the sauce that it came with was really tasty and the inside of each dumpling was fresh and juicy. This dish's spice has that numbing sensation that not everyone is used to, so just be aware. \n\nOverall, it's a decent spot to stop by, especially if you're in the mall already and hungry.

All of our food came out fast and hot. The seafood dumplings were my favorite. They were moist and a bit spicy but I loved the zing they had. Spicy food is just so flavorful and delicious. I also liked my entree--Kung pao chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the chiles were easy to spot so I easily ate around them instead of accidentally eating one and having my mouth be on fire like I've done at other Chinese restaurants. I also enjoy the calamari--it was nice and crisp and golden brown and there weren't too many of the octopus tentacles that I don't eat :). I stick to eating the calamari rings instead. \n\nOverall the experience was great and I will definitely be back to try other things. 2 things to mention though--at our table I kept getting drops of water on me every one in awhile.

Hopefully, you're ready for Americanized Chinese food that is not authentic.  Whether it's dim sum or the hand pulled noodles, it tries to imitate with mediocre results.  The food tastes okay, but it lacks flavor that makes you crave more.  The pork and truffle juicy dumplings were not memorable except for the shreds of ginger on top that is usually left in the sauce to neutralize the pork flavor.  The squid ink pasta has no taste whatsoever.  The peppercorn beef filet is just spicy without the taste of quality meat.  The saving grace of this place is the Forbidden Rice and Toasted Rice ice cream.  \n\nService is friendly and somewhat helpful, but I doubt they understand Chinese food or the signature dishes.

You can tell the noodles are freshmade, and cut. It has a bit of a bite, so it wasn't completely soft. Boar tastes like beef to be honest, but maybe it had a more game-y flavor? Not sure!

My gripe about the food is that the boar noodle soup was lukewarm, the green beans were old (like, chewy, yellowing, sitting around for more than a week old), the dim sum, while I appreciate the sustainable sourcing, was mediocre and falling apart.

Figured Chinese food was the thing todo after watching the early show of the Hobbit.  3 hours of sitting works up an appetite. My friend and I sat at the noodle station...saw them being made.  It's mesmerizing.  Hypnotic.  Like that little kid watching the static TV in Close Encounters.  \n\nSo for eats, crab dumplings, beef noodle soup, and kung pow chicken.  The dumplings were nicely done.  The noodle soup, while the noodles were really good and fresh, was in a very sweet broth - too sweet for my liking.  The kung pow chicken was fantastic.  I really don't know how 'authentic' or 'american' this wok dish is, but this was just great.  I devoured it.  Even to the point of eating the peppers.   \n\nBonus points, Martin Yan was in the shop.

They were feeling some Chinese food so this popped up on my yelp and I thought we should try. Giving this place 2 stars for a few reasons. \n\nI wanna start off by saying in terms of flavor 2/4 things were decent. The sweet and sour pork and fried rice were probably the only two things I would even think about ordering again if I came back. \n\nDan dan noodles weren't that great. Tasted just like a shittier version of Vietnamese vermicelli noodles. \n\nThe wonton soup was so plain and the broth that it was in was basically just water. \n\nOn top of that, the portions were like portions for ANTS! Sure we did family style, but even if we didn't, I honestly think it would have taken at least 2.5 plates to get even close to full. \n\nOh yeah and did I mention our waitress wasn't the friendliest? Apparently, they changed waiters in the middle of our meal and didn't even tell us. When we ordered additional food she said rudely that she'll \"tell kevin.\" Whoever that is. Pretty expensive \"chinese\" food. Not even close to PF Changs if you want to compare. Definitely not coming back here and I think you shouldn't either.", "author": "Tony V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-10", "description": "It was a first night in San Francisco, and one of our family friends invited us for dinner. He asked if we were up for Chinese, and of course like anyone we gladly accepted. I was very surprised at the location. It was located on the fourth floor of the downtown Westfield Mall that were also surrounded by other restaurants. I first stepped in the restaurant  I noticed the decor; it was a more classy type of setting. The restaurant was had a nice and vibrant ambience, to it. It had its Chinese influence on the decor, of course but it still had a nice modern feel to it. It was brightly lit but then it was off set by the darker shades of the tables and the chair. Overall, I do really like the aesthetic of the restaurant because it is very pleasing to see. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. \n\n Spicy Seafood Dumplings (9)\n      This was actually the section of the menu that caught my eye since usually Dim Sum is not served during dinner. One of the menu items that we decided to order were the Spicy Seafood Dumplings. The dumpling wrapper is made out of spinach that stuffed with scallop and shrimp. The sauce was light and it did add more flavor to the dumplings. Although, I would add just a touch of more seasoning on the sauce. The spinach wrapper had a great texture since it still had a little bit of chew to it. On the inside, the scallop and shrimp were very tender and I liked the fact that it wasn't overcooked. The seasoning in the dumpling was perfect. If they did more, I felt that it would overwhelm the dish and destroy the delicacy and daintiness of the dish. I would definitely order this dish again.\n\n Juicy Dumplings w/ Pork or Pork & Crab Roe - (9)\nThe other item that we ordered off the Dim Sum menu was the Juicy Dumplings with Pork or Pork & Crab Roe. You had the choice  of either getting three with pork and three with pork & crab roe. We decided to get three of each. When it arrived, we opened and I really loved the simple but traditional presentation of the Juicy Dumplings. It was my first time trying this type of dumplings that had soup inside, so I was very excited to try this! I only tried one which was the one with pork. I enjoyed the fact that its own spoons so you really could savor the soup and all its deliciousness once when the dumpling breaks.  The pork had a really nice flavor to it. After that I drank the soup, and it had a sweet note to it from the combination of the pork and other seasonings. I really liked the dumpling because of all the savory flavors and the hint of sweetness to it. The whole dish itself was mouth watering!\n\nSeven Spice Pork Rib (18)\n   The first this dish that we ordered from the Wok Section was the Seven Spiced Pork Ribs. The presentation was already stunning, the  medley of colors from the scallions, onions, and herbs. Also, the Seven Spice that was set on top of this meat made it already mouth watering. When I first bit into it, my taste buds were already doing the salsa since the spices were so delicious! If you eat with all of the topping of the spices and the vegetables, it is very flavorful. Although, if you eat the meat itself it is kinda of dry and tough. I wish the rib was cooked down more. That would be the only thing that I would change about it. I would rate this dish a four out of five.\n\n Wok Seared Beef- (19)\n   This dish was actually recommended by a family member that has eaten here numerous times, so therefore I was ecstatic to try it. In the menu, it describes that it is seasoned with Sichuan peppercorns and laid on a bed of arugula. When I first bit into it, the meat was already so tender, that I just had to eat over and over again. The Sichuan peppercorns were just beautifully paired with the meat. It gave an extra something to the dish which I have been looking for while eating here. I loved this dish so much!\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp-(22)\n      One of my favorite dishes is the Honey Walnut shrimp. To see that now it is on the menu, I wanted to order it. It arrived and it looked like your typical honey walnut shrimp. I really enjoyed the glaze since it was sweet, but it had a twist to it. There were hints of wasabi, which provided it be kind of light. Also, it had the some fresh cucumbers with it which provided another dimension to it. I really liked the fact that they added wasabi since it was just something then ordinary.\n\nHong Kong Crispy Noodles w/ Chicken X- (16) \nThis was my favorite dish since it had the right balance of flavors. At first it seemed like your typical crispy noodle dish, but then once it enters your mouth it is excellent. The crunchy part of noodles was just right and it wasn't too hard or too soft. Once you mix it in with the rich, and creamy sauce the noodles start to soften, and it just become delectable. The vegetables were not mushy and they still had a nice crunch to it. Also, the chicken was very moist and juicy. I just kept going back to the dish more and more.", "author": "Aleia P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-05-31", "description": "I have mixed feelings about this place. I came on a Thursday evening about an hour before they closed. the mall was already pretty empty and the restaurant was about half full.\n\nLet's start with the negatives and end on a good note. \n\nWe were shown our to our table but because of the way the long table is set up in the middle, it felt more like a cafeteria table with small gaps in between. It's hard to describe but I didn't feel like I had my \"own\" small table. Not very intimate, is what I'm going for. It's either that or you can sit at the bar or along the glass seeing the chefs prepare the food. \n\nOnce seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for the NON-busy restaurant to come take our drink orders. She asked if we had questions about the menu. I'm a fairly slow reader but I had already read the entire menu 3 times by now and was already feeling ignored (read \"neglected\"). I politely told the waitress that we were ready to order, she responded \"okay\". I begin my order: spicy dumplings, and beef hand-pulled noodles. Before I completed my second word (which was \"dumplings\"), she stops me \"oh, I forgot a pen\"... and then walks away from the table. \n\nService and experience: 2 stars. The ambiance was pretty cool in that you can see that the noodles are definitely fresh. \n\nNow, the food: the spicy dumplings were pretty good, just a small amount of kick to it, but I felt that it had a little too much soy-sauce which just turned the entire dish salty. \n\nNow, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance... overcooked. The noodles were overcooked!!! After all that, the noodles felt mushy. They definitely tasted fresh, but the noodles were not run under cold water as it is traditionally done in traditional Chinese restaurants when dealing with fresh noodles. The cold water stops the noodles from cooking, and the hot broth keeps the noodles warm before eating. These noodles were \"hot\" and fell apart to the touch. Trying to serve two bowls became very difficult as the noodle would break off. \n\nI must admit though, the beef was perfectly stewed and essentially melted in your mouth! The baby bok choy was also very fresh and crisp. \n\nEven so, I'll give the food 4 stars because it is hard to make beef that soft! The noodles, I'm hoping was just a fluke.\n\nI plan to be back to give them another shot, but I'll wait a little while before I pay someone to be ignored. \n\nSo, average 3 stars is all I can muster. Hope your Yelping experience is better than mine!", "author": "Charles K."}

The Peking duck that followed which should have come with slivered green onions and cucumber came instead with coarsely sliced onions and actual chunks of cucumber. The accompanying hoisin sauce was too salty and had a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. The duck was dry too. Deserts were a bit mixed. A lychee panna cotta was so full of gelatin that it was more like a hockey puck than the tremulously wobbly fruit custard it's supposed to be so it was sent back. Our waiter said it would be taken off the bill but it wasn't until we'd asked again for it to be done when the bill eventually arrived. The egg custard buns (described as molten egg custard lava buns) were fine, as they should have been for the price! I'd driven up from Los Angeles to have dinner with my eldest son who was in town for a sudden two day conference. I've been away from San Francisco restaurants for a while and found M.Y.China from an Internet search. Silly me! I'd promised him a really good Chinese dinner which the beautifully envisaged menu and Martin Yan's reputation should have allowed.

Dim Sum is an option, as well as small plates, noodles, and wok dishes. We went for a couple of small plates (salt and pepper calamari and pork belly sliders), the Kung Pao Chicken from the wok menu, and the Beijing Noodles with pork and mushrooms. \n\nNot a miss in the bunch. Calamari was perfectly seasoned and not at all chewy and came with a sweet chili dipping sauce. The pork belly was flavorful and tender, and the two mains were delicious and well seasoned/spiced.

Two of my friends had arrived early and had already checked in at 7:30pm. The rest of us arrived at about 7:55. The host that was working was really misleading and not helping. If I had made reservations weeks in advance aren't you suppose to leave a table open to make sure it's available to accommodate ?? There was a party of 4 that was a walk in and was seated before our party was. We ended up seating at 8:30pm and that's only because one of my friends started complaining to one of the managers. I mean what's the point of having a RVSP option if you don't follow through with it. I understand restaurants are busy and they can't always make people leave, so 10-15mins late I can understand. But I think it might have taken us longer to be seated if my gf hadn't complained about the wait. \n\nIf I can rate this review on the manager that was working at the time I would give it 5 stars. Matthew was extremely accommodating and nice. He was the manager on the clock at time and got us a table set up right after my friend complained. He also threw in the first round of drinks on the house. Not only did he put out the fire, he made sure we were happy campers and he even came around to check in with us a few times.  \n\nOverall service by the waiters would be a 3 .

Because of its location in Westfield Mall in Union Square, I went in with the expectation that I will be getting authentic Chinese cooking with a Western flare.  I was right.  The menu caters to the Western palate as true Chinese cooking doesn't include cold salads.  My friend and I ordered the Peking Duck (a dish of crispy roasted duck skins and meat tha includes 8 housemade buns in a bamboo steamer), Grandma's Gai Lan w/garlic & Chinese sausage, and Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles. Highlight: I know the Chinese side of me was coming out because when the broccoli dish came out, and as much I liked the crunchiness, I really wanted oyster sauce to compliment it; I asked our waiter for some, she looked confused/unsure and had to ask around.  Good thing, though, one of her staff members came through and gave us a small dish of oyster sauce...lol.\nA plus for awesome service, decor, and the food being tasty, but, I personally, may dine here less often as I can order the same food at a different restaurant for a lesser price.

I went with a noodle dish because they are known for making handmade noodles. The noodles were overcooked and flavorless and the seafood was not fresh and overcooked. Avoid this place. You could walk into just about any place in Chinatown and find more interesting food. Would give 0 stars if that was an option.", "author": "Nancy A."}

They hire servers of different ethnicities - but they're all slim and pretty-faced, with a vibe that screams disingenuous. They want a generous tip, that's all. And they're probably used to getting it, being pretty and desirable-looking. \n\nMy server obviously didn't enjoy serving me - I could feel it. He seemed more neutral about the others in my party, though. I ordered an item that sounded interesting. But when it came, I was disappointed - it was something that I really disliked. I asked the server to describe it before I ordered it, but he didn't describe it all that well or accurately, so I didn't know exactly what he was talking about. The menu should describe items more fully. And pictures of all the entrees would help, too. I never send stuff back, but I really disliked my entree, and it was expensive, so I sent it back and ordered something else instead. Unfortunately, that other entree was pretty bad as well. They weren't real noodles, as I was expecting - they were odd, spear or worm-shaped \"noodles.\" Not too appetizing. The overall flavor of the dish was really meh, too. My party also ordered a sweet and sour soup that we shared, and it was very meh as well. \n\nI don't get this restaurant. Is it Asian or Chinese fusion? Chinese with an American, Hong Kong, or international flair? I guess it's like Slanted Door, except more Chinese instead of Vietnamese. The pretentious restroom, which I believe was unisex, definitely reminded me of the Slanted Door's. Same builder/architect? \n\nM.Y. China, like the rest of the mall, is all about a trendy veneer, and lacking in real substance. It was $30 for each of us for a very mediocre meal - worse than a $5 one you can get in Chinatown.

Great combination of flavors, again nice sized portion.  Finally, the shandong beef rolls were incredible, one of the best small dishes I ever had.  It was a lot like Japanese negamaki surrounded by crispy goodness with a nice sauce.

It was not bad but really nothing tasty and I often get better roast pork at strip mall Chinese restaurants (this was probably higher quality meat the taste was not superior).  The biggest disappointment, though, and what almost knocked it down to three stars, was the sizzling pan fried savory pork bao.  I love pork buns but these were almost inedible.

You walk past the open kitchen (pretty warm spot) where you can sit & watch the spectacle of noodle making. We decided to sit in one of the dining areas where a dark toned, fairly sophisticated dining room awaited us. Has a corporate restaurant feel, a little tight on the two seater benches. \n\nService was professional, but not flawless. We did have a lull at one point and we were looking around. \n\nFood was lovely. Noodles and tofu are stand outs here! We ordered the pork tacos (a take on pork mushu) which was a tasty beginning.

It's really frustrating when you have a slower waiter, that just doesn't seem to care.\n\nI asked him for a recommendation when ordering and he just pointed to one thing - the crab, which didn't have a price but was probably the most expensive item on the menu. I wasn't in the mood for crab and he didn't continue. I had to ask.. so what else is good?? \n\nI ended up ordering the duck. It was SO dry.

These two are some of my favorite appetizers, although their won ton soup doesn't stay behind. \n\nI've had the squid ink noodles and their wild boar hand cut noodles. Both are delicious, chewy, and quipped with the right amount of meat and veggies. I would toggle between both but the wild boar noodles are just so fun!\n\nThe rockfish was recommended by one of their waiters the first time I went here and I never did look back. It is probably one of their most awesome dishes, but it is about $30. It's a halibut, I believe, with a crispy/friend skin and doused in their sweet and sour sauce served along a rainbow of peppers. The meat is tender and falls right off the bones. \n\nChairman Mao chicken is good, but nothing spectacular. It's a pretty simple dish with plenty of spices, though certainly not the best chicken I've had. Probably try something else next time.\n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp is more like wasabi glazed shrimp.

For those that don't know, it involves the chef basically taking a load of dough and just slapping it around and pulling it into lots and lots (possibly thousands?) of individual noodle pieces. This was the first time I've seen chefs performing this in America. I've always enjoyed watching them do it in China and I was just as amused and impressed here at M.Y. China. \n\nYou won't get an authentic Chinese experience here so I probably wouldn't bring my parents but it's a great spot to grab a fancy dinner with friends. They've got a list of unique and not-so-unique cocktails - like mai tai's - which help spicen up the evening. Get the drinks flowing, whet your appetite with some soup dumplings, and order up some more dishes (don't forget the noodles!) and you're in for a fun and delicious evening.", "author": "Philip W."}

As a Chinese person who typically eats authentic Chinese food, I didn't have high expectations for Martin Yan's restaurant.  However, because it IS Martin Yan's restaurant, I had to give it a try.\n\nA lot of items off of their menu jumped out at me, including their 2 prix fixe menu's for 2, dumplings, Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup, and Lamb Chops.  But we decided to go with the Juicy Dumpling Trio, Wild Board Scissor Cut Noodles, and Dan Dan Noodle.\n\nI would have to say, if there are items on a menu that are highlighted on the restaurant's Yelp listing, you really can't go wrong with them! While it was nice to try all three flavors of dumplings, call me traditional, but I really enjoyed the wild boar, and pork and crab. But props to the restaurant for serving the dumplings on soup spoons.  This way, you'll never lose the juices! I also really liked the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, which was one of the top highlighted items on the Yelp listing.  Overall, the dish was just very tasty, well seasoned, and it had a good mix of textures between the thick pieces of noodle, meat and vegetables. While I generally like Dan Dan Noodles, I wasn't particularly fond of the flavoring of this. It wasn't bad, but it was just more vinegar based than I had anticipated.\n\nAll in all, it's over priced for what it is, but heck, you're inside the Westfield SF Centre, what would you expect? And..Yan CAN Cook!\n\nWhat would have made my day? A sighting of Martin Yan, but alas, that didn't happen. Maybe next time...", "author": "Audrey C."}

When I think of mall food, i think of food court, and when I think of food court, I think of Panda Express (Don't ask why, I just do)\n\nAt first, this place seemed a little disorganized. They take reservations, but they won't take your name for walk-ins, they just have you stand to the side and they'll get you when there's an open table. I didn't find it efficient, but it seems to work for them.\n\nInterior of this place is nice, dark walls,  dark floors, dim lighting, a very modern rustic feel to it, and oddly, I found their bathrooms to be beautiful. \n\nEnough about the restaurant itself, let's get to the food. \n\nBetween the four of us, we shared the House made Pickles trio (sour daikon, sweet squash, spicy papaya), Salt & Pepper Calamari w/ chili peppers, scallions, and the Hong Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken XO and house made X.O. sauce. Everything was delicious, my only critique for the food was the Crispy Noodles seemed to lack something, a spice of sorts, or maybe a little bit of hot spice, the calamari was good, but i would've preferred more rings to tentacles, but despite this, it was all delicious!\n\nBUT WAIT........ our favorite part of the meal was dessert. Went with the Sugar Egg Puffs w/ chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream and raspberry coulis. I'll be honest, when I think of sugar egg puffs, I think of the little puffs you get at Genki. Not the case here! these suckers were huge! Wish I had taken a photo, but they were gone before I even got a chance. \n\nAll in all, great little place if you're on a date, or just want a quick bite before a movie, or mid shopping lunch, a little pricey, but then again, its in a mall.", "author": "Laurens D."}

Their Bok Choy is a perfect example of a simple well cooked chinese dish: crunchy and has so much flavor after each bite.  Veggies aren't hard to cook, but most Americanized chinese food restaurants will overcook it and make it all mushy.  My favorite dish on the menu is the Seafood Squid Ink Noodle ($18).

We read about this place in the SF Chronicle for places close to Union Square.  We were so happy to try it because it was excellent food, and the setting was very nice for Christmas too.  It's located in the Westfield mall on the fourth floor under the giant dome.  They were even projecting Nutcracker on the inside of the dome and playing the music from Nutcracker too.  So, a pleasant atmosphere for a dinner.  \n\nWe didn't have reservations on a Saturday night and expected to wait, but my wife and I were seated within two minutes of arriving at about 7:00.  They were busy but the hostesses were very gracious and accommodated us without problems.  \n\nOur waitress was friendly and informative.   She confirmed our choices were good and offered some great opinions as well.  \n\nThe food was great.  My wife and i are not big eaters so planned on sharing a few items and we started with scissor cut noodles with wild boar and veggies.  This was pretty spicy which I don't mind, but my wife is more sensitive and it was a little much for her taste.  Despite that we loved this dish, and ate it all.   We ordered fried rice because I always like some rice with Asian food, and they brought this dish out next.  It ended up being the highlight of a really good meal.  I can't say enough about how good the fried rice is.   Balanced flavors and it complemented our last dish so well too.  Our last dish was General's chicken, which was again quite spicy, but I like that....my wife not as much, but again, it was so good that it didn't bother her that much and we just ordered up another beer to cool the heat...\n\nOverall, we loved our meal.

Well, no. Is it Chinese fusion? Yes. Is it delicious? Also yes.\n\nI came here several weeks ago and never remembered to write a review, so allow me to make up for that. I don't remember all of what I ordered though, so bear with me. The SQUID INK NOODLES, are DELICIOUS. Maybe it's expected of me to enjoy this dish the most, because I like squid-inked anything. But I enjoyed the texture of the little noodles, and the seafood was mostly fresh. The shrimp was a little sad, but you can't win at everything. \n\nI believe that we also ordered the Honey Glazed Pork , or something along those lines? Pretty good; flavorful and sweet. Tender for the most part, but the leftovers get chewy the next day, as leftovers do. \n\nSo I obviously don't have a problem with the food. The service was a little subpar; I may be a imagining things, but the waitress that served us seemed to lack a little in respect, especially when compared to the attitude she had when serving another table.

They definitely don't jip you on the meat or buns.  \n\nBeijing noodles: My favorite dish of the night, by far! The noodles are freshly made by hand (you can actually see the chef pulling them apart in the kitchen) and the sauce was amazing. \n\nKungpao Tofu (we had a vegetarian with us): Not bad but not super memorable. \n\nAll in all, it was a good meal and I would come here again when I'm in Westfield mall. Probably wouldn't make a separate trip out to it. \n\nOh and the bathroom is unisex. Just a heads up since I definitely thought I walked into the wrong bathroom!", "author": "Lina H."}

The interior is very sleek and the ornate lanterns hanging from the ceiling were especially impressive. You can even see the chefs hand-pull noodles in the open kitchen and one of them even walked around performing in front of us!\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Crispy veggie spring rolls ($6): toasted taro, wild seasonal mushrooms http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2?select=ZWSY8eRcF_LRJls_iqgFpA#ZWSY8eRcF_LRJls_iqgFpA\n- Vegetarian longevity noodle soup ($12): wild seasonal mushrooms, braised tofu, Sichuan pickled vegetables http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2?select=ZWSY8eRcF_LRJls_iqgFpA#mNctyYFc2JbVW5M6ctlwFg\n- Squid ink snap noodles with seafood ($18): shrimp, scallops, calamari, Shaoxing wine http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2?select=ZWSY8eRcF_LRJls_iqgFpA#YkvIGmI1-WjdauECURYGtg\n\nThere is complimentary still or sparkling water and of course, I opted for sparkling. While the number of vegetarian main dishes is limited, the waitress informed me that some of the noodles could be made vegetarian with tofu instead (I will try this next time!). We started with the spring rolls which were perfectly crispy and delicious! They also came with a red dipping sauce which was nice. \n\nI don't order veggie ramen or soups that often because most of the time, they contain some kind of meat or fish broth, but this was not the case here and the vegetarian longevity noodle soup was amazing! The broth was light yet flavorful due to the fried garlic and green onions, the noodles were thick and chewy, and the silky tofu and plentiful veggies completed the dish. So many different types of mushrooms too! This might just be the best noodle soup I've ever had! The squid ink noodles had quite an interesting appearance (not your typical looking noodles!) and were apparently very tasty also.\n\nOverall, the food quality is great and prices are pretty reasonable for it being a Dome-level restaurant. I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again when I'm around downtown SF!", "author": "Jessica C."}

Loved the wall of buddhas and the cabinet of snuff bottles just outside the unisex toilets.  The toilets were huge and yes its for men and women. Waiters were really warm and friendly all the way.  Nice of the waiter to mention that still and sparkling water were complimentary.  Went there for lunch with a friend who was visiting.  She was still jet lagged, so we ordered pork sliders, $8 for two. Then we had the beef with soup noodles $14 and the cold Dan Dan min $12.  The beef noodles was really flavorful, the meat was tender and the noodles tasted freshly made. The Dan Dan Min was refreshing, a little spicy but good.  The bill came to about $47 with tips. A bit pricey for lunch but on the whole very satisfying.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Spicy pork dumpling:  ok.  Spoons were hot to hold and the sauce inside the dumpling were hot.  We had to wait like 10 minutes before eating.\n\n2.  Wild boar cut noodles:  bad.  I used to love this dish.  Now,  they just drenched it in oil.  The server said it always comes out like that.  \n\n3.  Sweet and Sour Pork:  not worth it.  It is a $17 dish but man they are cheap with the amount of meat.  U get like maybe 10 pieces of meat.  Little bit bellpeppers and sauce.  Again,  NOT WORTH IT.  You can go elsewhere to get more for less.  \n\nNot only food has gone downhill,  the service has plummeted as well.  Our server was okay.  She did catch our seafood allergy so nice job!

He generously invited the family for Chinese New Year's dinner on the Saturday night.  Due to other engagements, our party only consisted of six as we were seated at the restaurant's edge table (between the inside dining room and the mall atrium \"outdoor\" seating area).  After the Hakkasan experience, my expectations were tempered; however, there were some expecttations after reading Genevieve's early review and photos.  Coincidentally, Michael Bauer recently wrote a review which I read earlier that week. Here's what we had:\n\nWealth menu - $88.00 for two people\n\n1) Juicy Dumplings Sampler (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VedCBrcp6hZ32dWUI2PNkA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Two each of Wild boar, pork and crab, and pork with black truffle.  Hard to distinguish the flavors between the three as it was subtle.\n\n2)  Peking Duck (1/2 duck), Two Tastes \n     a) Skin in sliders (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8ntva7sTilssddgpxBjArw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Nicely prepared as the skin were indeed crispy.  Nice having this pre-constructed.\n     b) Stir-fried meat in lettuce cups (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oYwG8RzP__8pHeIZMGMhqA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - One serving per person and, like the sliders, convenient to eat and tasty flavors.\n\n3) Seafood Treasury (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ByUHGWOvOL5XyTGJtHzGHg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Shrimp, scallop, calamari with mixed greens and mushrooms in a \"bird's nest' basket, the flavors were just okay.  The 'bird nest's basket' was my favorite aspect of this dish.\n\n4) Stir-fried Longevity Noodle with Shredded BBQ Pork (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3Rp8jAoGmkh1D0H-f3g5Bg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Good wok breath, but the flavors did not really wow.\n\nDessert\n5) Sugar Puff with sauces (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wowD-sWh0VqChon4tAgeQg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Think Beignets with chocolate and raspberry sauce.\n\nShared - Supplement\n\n1) Roasted chicken, half order (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1TQqleBP3HpcqtgXsHac-g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Mentioned in the newspaper review, this dish caught my cousin's eye and did not disappoint.\n\n2) Scissor cut noodles with Wild boar (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aPOSmbGf1URMz4We6M3Ctw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Better flavors than the Longevity noodle and the uneven cuts of the noodle confirm that they are freshly made.\n\nOverall, the meal was pretty good, as my father complimented the kitchen for its cooking skills on most of the dishes; shortly after this, the noodle person popped up behind him and started pulling noodles.  Our waitress was very accommodating to our needs, starting with our party reduction and the servers announced each dish as they brought them out and quickly cleared the empty dishes from our table.  The atmosphere is very interesting as you can get probably four different vibes dining here, depending where you are seated.  Besides where we sat, there are three other dining rooms, one with a series of communal tables next to the open kitchen with several counter seats, a more secluded, quiet dining to the left with a display wall decorated with various Buddha statues (for those who grew up in Chinatown, this reminds me of the original Imperial Palace, the Grant Avenue restaurant with the doorman), and the bar to the far right, adorned with a large bell.  Our table gave more a mall atmosphere with nearby outer tables and high ceiling atrium feel.  Coming in later that week for lunch, we sat near the open kitchen which gave more of a cafeteria vibe.  \nFor mall food, this is a bit over-the-top, but guess that's consistent with the San Francisco dining scene these days.  Yes, I came back for lunch (beef noodle soup being the last sampling - broth a bit on the sweet side, too much star anise or cinnamon?) and, yes, I will be back again when friends or family have a craving for Chinese food near my office.\nThanks to my brother for welcoming the Year of the Snake!", "author": "Mike C."}

Finally got tired of trying to make eye contact and asked for water and a Bloody Mary.  They don't serve bloody Mary's.. Ok ordered my next go to, vodka tonic with Chopin ( yes I can taste the difference even with tonic).  No Chopin.. Bartender recommend another vodka, it was ok but a weak drink. Next I noticed my plate had food dried on it and had to almost get rude to get attention to have it replaced.  First drink down.. Now we are hungry and trying to order food.  Empty water, empty drink, menus out of the way but nobody is paying any attention.  Once again had to try hard to get attention. This happened the entire 2 hours we were there until we were ready to leave, but now.. they are filling water and asking if we want more drinks.  This was the first time any of us visited MyChina so We were not sure if they were under staffed or what, but I recommend to management to have a dedicated bartender to take care of the patrons at the bar.

After all, I grew up watching him and since he's Cantonese too!  =)  Bf & I finally checked it out this past Saturday night & were lucky enough to get a 6:45 reservation with only an hour notice through Opentable.\n\nWe have both heard mixed reviews on the restaurant and weren't honestly expecting much, but boy were we wrong!  We had to wait about 5 minutes or so pass our reservation time, but at least we got a photo opp with Martin Yan himself while we were waiting by the front.  He definitely knows how to entertain as he was explaining the noodle making process to part of the restaurant.  And he walks around to some tables as well (including ours a couple times).  Gotta love that!  \n\nFor the appetizers we got  pork belly bun sliders ($8) & crab & pork dumplings ($12).  We also ordered: wild boar scissor cut noodles ($14), claypot braised beef short rib ($25), and da mieu (pea sprouts) ($16), one bowl of rice ($2), and for dessert, sugar egg puffs ($8).  \n\nThe pork belly bun sliders were so tasty!  The meat in his was quite a bit fattier than mine however.  I prefer these over Chairman Bao!  For the dumplings we got 4 & like Cherylynn commented, they were served on ceramic spoons in the steamer, which caused the dumplings to stick and most of them were also served punctured already, so we slurped most of the juice from the spoon directly.  Though it was aesthetically pleasing, this presentation makes no sense because the spoons were so hot and because the dumpling sticks to the spoons making it hard to get out.  I tasted the crab, while he said he couldn't.  I guess that was a trade off since he got one dumpling that wasn't punctured!  We loved the wild boar scissor cut noodle because of it's lightness and I'm always a sucker for my noodles.  We just wished that the noodles were a little longer.  The taste of the  boar was light too, which was a plus.  The short rib was tender and plentiful.  I loved the onions and the herbs and sauce, everything tied together so well and had that little bit of heat.  Da Mieu is pretty standard everywhere I've had it, with no complaints here either!  Last but not least, the sugar egg puffs!  We liked how they weren't as covered in sugar as the traditional Chinese places we've had them at does it.  However, they were greasier than what we're used to.  But, a plus here are the dipping sauces!  We loved the raspberry the most, but the chocolate fondue and vanilla chantilly creme are great as well.  \n\nService was pretty good and polite, but the restaurant was so busy that I think refills on water were overlooked for our table and our neighbor's.   The ambiance is eclectic mod Asian.  The bathroom is in the corner and has no door (it's unisex) but with several ceiling to floor stalls for some privacy!  The food portions, minus the appetizers were pretty generous.  We did have leftover claypot.  All in all, $102 for all that food plus one beer isn't bad.  It's a little like PF Chang's, but definitely more authentic, actually tasty & almost the same price!  We definitely will be back.", "author": "Cat C."}

The restaurant is located on the top floor of the westfield downtown mall in SF. There is a bar seating area, and a restaurant dining area and the decor has a modern Chinese style too it. \n\nFOOD:\nWe ordered several appetizers:\nTea Flavored Pork Belly Sliders - Fantastic taste. It comes wrapped in a soft fluffy steamed bun with pickle onions and juicy pork belly inside. Great start to the meal.\n\nJuicy Pork Dumplings - The dumplings came in a giant red spoons. Great idea to hold the soup after taking a bite! Downside is that after a bit the bottom would stick to the spoons so the dumpling would automatically rip apart! The meat was still amazingly delicious.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup - Well balanced flavor to the broth. It is very different from the classic asian restaurants in San Jose as the broth has a rich yet subtle taste. Definitely can tell the soup was quality made as it wasn't heavy and wasn't filled with oil and  flavor enhancers. The meat was also the best beef noodle soup meat I have had. It literally melted in my mouth and was not tough at all.\n\nWok Roasted Lobster - Another must get dish! The lobster was perfect and cracked so it was easy to get all the meat with out much of an effort! It was flavored with the usual Asian herb, and lemon seasoning. The lobster was extremely fresh and cooked the right amount.\n\nSugar Egg Puffs - Pure heaven. I think I could of ate 10 of these even after eating all the appetizers and entrees. The egg puffs are perfectly sugared and not too sweet at all. There is also a milky pudding texture inside, and the egg puffs come with vanilla, chocolate, and raspberry fillings.\n\nOverall the food is excellent quality and I don't think it is Americanized at all and brings out how Chinese food can be well balanced quality food.\n\nAdditionally the plating of the dishes were all brilliantly placed and even the tea we ordered came in small circular bows to drink out of.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe waiters were extremely attentive and came by our tables on several occasions to ask how the meal was.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-29", "description": "I guess seeing M.Y. China on the 2014 Bib Gourmand list gave me the idea to finally stop by here and see what's the buzz all about.\n\nI came here with two others, we decided to just order our own plates and perhaps share some appetizers or dimsum. My biggest expectation was double what you would pay for in Chinatown and half the size of what they serve in Chinatown. It's very tough for me to try westernized Chinese food, just for the fact that there could be so many wrongs coming out of these places. Sometimes either fusion screws up a traditional dish, lacking certain flavors (especially spiciness), but sometimes it works pretty well in terms of food presentation.\n\nSo we ordered beef stew hand pulled noodles, spicy seafood dumplings, and HK style pan fried noodles.  (ERMAGGERD, NOODERS!)  The hand pulled noodles was alright. Portions were pretty good, reminded me of Noodle Asia in Venetian. The hand pulled noodles were okay, but I liked the ones from Imperial Tea Court in Berkeley more for that chewiness in the noodles. The soup base wasn't overly empowered by MSG and salt, one of the few times where I drank the whole thing.  What I enjoyed most was the beef, good quality beef and slow cooked to the right time. You don't have to gnaw on the beef chunks like you are a cow eating grass. It's actually very soft and falls apart inside your mouth.  \n\nI personally hate pan fried noodles because the dish is too indecisive on its texture. It's either too soggy from soaking in the sauce, or too crunchy because the noodles were burnt. I didn't recall seeing burnt noodles. I only tasted the sauce, which was slightly sweetened, as if it used chicken stock for base. The chicken pieces used surprised me a bit; I guess I was too used to eating chicken covered in thick batter before frying, I didn't expect to get to the meat so quickly. \n\nThe spicy dumplings were just okay. I was expected the dumpling skin to be more chewy. It's definitely pretty thin and it doesn't break when it's being picked up. Again, I'm not used to eating a big chunk of shrimp in the dumpling. The sauce was a bit overwhelming in the saltiness and there's no depth in the flavors.  Probably not going to order this next time.\n\nI guess if you want to try this place but got scared by the pricing. Look, you pay for what you get, you pay more for your dimsum, you get a bigger piece of shrimp!  And you do get better service, unless you like to pay for rude services, then Chinatown is not too far away.", "author": "Connie C."}

I hope he crushes it with this current venture, but there's too much \"show\" for my taste since the substance is perfectly fine. \n\nIt's like a \"best hits\" album from the 80s: sweet and sour pork, kung pao chicken, lettuce cups... the good news is that the food is perfectly enjoyable.

So this is a classic example of when reading other Yelpers reviews can help with that experience.  I went in expecting higher than normal price tag for Chinese food and some select \"must tries\" that I may not find at cheaper Chinese restaurants.  \n\nWith 4 of us, we were able to try a variety of different dishes which is a great way to go.  \n\nWe started off with all the dumplings - wild boar, pork and crab, pork and black truffle, and spicy seafood.  The first 3 are made like xiao lung baos served on a spoon to catch the juice that runs out and were very tasty with the wild boar being our favorite.  \n\nCrispy Organic Tofu - Perfectly cooked crispy on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside  \nBang Bang Chicken Wings - This was probably my least favorite as the sauce was a bit too overpowering for my taste - save the $9 for another order of wild boar dumplings\nBeef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup - The menu said it was a slow simmered rib eye but with the preparation, it could've been another cut without a big noticeable difference.  It probably would've been fun to see them pull the noodles for the dish if we sat at the counter though\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles - We really enjoyed the noodles in this dish which were short (about 1 1/2 - 2 in long) that you almost don't realize those were noodles.  But it was flavorful and well prepared.  \n\nOverall, it was a good experience and found the food flavorful and well prepared without MSG proven by not needing a gallon of water to quench our thirst an hour later.

Although both bartenders were friendly enough, they sorely lacked in service and would rather chat up all the servers than wait on their customers. I never did get a place setting or even water from them and had to flag down the bar back for both 45 minutes after sitting down when our food finally started arriving. \n\nThe food came out all at once and really quickly after I was finally able to get an order in. This makes me think that everything is already cooked and plated and just sitting in the back waiting to be dumped at your table. None of the food was very good, just loaded with salt and dripping in grease. \n\nAfter we had had enough with being ignored and unable to order more drinks, we managed to flag the bar back down again so she could get the bartender's attention and bring us our check.

My oh my was the food delicious. I ordered the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup with slow simmered short rib and baby bok choy. The noodles were so perfectly uniform that I questioned if they were actually hand pulled but this skepticism was addressed when the chefs were walking through the restaurants pulling the noodles right in front of the diners. The beef was incredibly tender, the bok choy brought the perfect amount of crunch and the broth was the star of the dish infusing it with so much flavor. And after seeing the dessert menu I knew I couldn't end my meal yet. We, as a group of 4, split two desserts - the Lychee Panna Cotta with chrysanthemum granita and mint essence and the Tea Infused Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with whipped cream and gaufrette.

China five stars for the excellent food and fast & professional (mostly) service. Growing up in SF, and coming from an Asian background, I've been to a lot of Chinese-American restaurants in the Bay Area that either excel or disappoint. M.Y. China definitely excels on most points. The food was as expected, Americanized Chinese food, so my parents and I weren't expecting it to be authentic. We did have good expectations for the quality and flavor--both of which were great.\n\nWe had a meal for three for under $40, which is a great value considering the large portions and rich flavors.\n\nThe decor is sleek, modern and just the right mix of Oriental and Western tones. The setting is intimate. Needless to say, the dining experience was very comfortable.\n\nHowever, I have to agree with reviewer Raj P. about the waiting staff. The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful. On the other hand we felt our waiter was, as Raj P. said, half-hearted, fake and disinterested. He simply didn't show a bit of enthusiasm or care. In short, he had no emotion. Is there a way we can get in contact with management? Because it looks like a lot of people are complaining about the same server.\n\nI would have given a rating of 4, maybe 3, stars were it not for the bussers.

Unfortunately, painting a blank canvas with clear paint doesn't really get you anywhere...it definitely doesn't make you a painter who can open a gallery to sell err...paintings? In an attempt to salvage this round of sustenance, we requested chili sauce to, you know, spruce things up...but that request was tabled so that the waitress could chat with a nearby party, take drink orders, bring said drinks, chat them up some more, then after being reminded again, she said \"I was just about to grab it\".\n\nOverall, it was a lackluster experience quite fitting for the pedestrian mall setting it has complacently nestled itself into.", "author": "Nick W."}

They are so flavorful and have that nice \"wok\" flavor to them. It can be a bit salty to some palates but it goes well with the entrees. The Beijing knife cut noodles are also worth trying. They are cooked well and are a nice vegetarian option. The beef hand pulled noodles are also good. The presentation is very neat and the broth is quite tasty. But I would recommend trying the dry noodles to the noodle soups are you can taste more of the \"wok\" flavor and it's much easier to share. Also, the chefs sometimes put on a show as they pull the noodles right in front of your table. \n\nMy favorite entree has to be the five spice pork ribs. Don't let the word ribs deceive you into the dish being messy and hard to eat because it's quite the opposite. The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone. The pork ribs I presume is slow cooked and then fried a bit on the outside to give it that crispy golden color and taste. It's so delicious that you must try for yourself. The lamb chops are also on the top of my list. It's seasoned with cumin and chili powder and tastes so flavorful and juicy. Also, you can give the Peking duck a try. It's not the best Peking duck but it is still good and satisfies the craving. \n\nFrom the small eats, the tea smoked pork belly sliders are wonderful. They are tender and goes nicely with the bun.

No weird bits and pieces that you'd normally get from the gargantuan, frozen shu mai of most dim sum restaurants. \n\nThe wonton soup, unfortunately, wasn't as nearly exciting. The broth was bland, and while the filling of the wonton had no offending flavors, it was because it was on the opposite spectrum - bland. Nothing to write home about. \n\nThe hand-pulled beef needles were a joy - the noodles were fresh, and had that light chewy texture only freshly pulled noodles can have. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and was a balance of meat and fat. Most restaurants like to cut you short on vegetables, but not in this case; the bowl had a beautiful mix of greenery to offset the salt and starch. Lightly spiced with a deep, dark rich beef broth, this soup was rejuvenating. \n\nOverall, good food and excellent dim sum. I have yet to find a place that served such quality dim sum pieces and will return.", "author": "Chau L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-10-05", "description": "On Saturday, 10/4/14, my girlfriend and I ate at M.Y. China for lunch. Back in March of 2013 was the first time my girlfriend and I ate at M.Y. China. We had a really good experience and thought the food was excellent.  The second time we ate at M.Y. China was in September of 2013. We didn't have a good experience. My Sweet & Sour Pork was horrible. The pork tasted old and was very chewy. The Scissor Cut Boar Noodles weren't good either. The Boar was very fatty and chewy, literally inedible. The noodles were burnt as well. The only dish that was good was the Potato Pancake appetizer. I must say the Manager on duty at the time handled the situation very well. She offered to have the dishes remade or anything else we wanted on the menu. She ended up comping our entire bill and brought out a free dessert. She was very professional and handled the situation perfectly. \n\nMy girlfriend wanted to give M.Y. China another shot. I kept telling her that I have a feeling it's not going to be good. We ended up going anyways and here's how it all went down. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nThe restaurant is very nice. The open floor plan makes the restaurant look even larger than it really is. There's a really nice bar area located to the right once you enter the restaurant. I like the Chinese decor and design throughout the restaurant. The open kitchen is pretty cool because you get to see the chefs prepare dishes along with stretching long noodles. \n\nFood:\n\nI ordered the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup (slow simmered short rib, baby bok choy.) The soup was mediocre at best. The beef short rib tasted like old pot roast. There was a ton of fat on the short rib. The noodles tasted okay. I didn't like the taste of the spices that were in the soup. They were too overpowering. The baby bok choy tasted good and fresh. About half way through my soup I noticed something disgusting! I was using my fork to grab some more noodles and noticed a hair in the broth! The hair ended up on the side of the bowl! It looked like an eye brow hair or eye lash. I was turned off at that point and couldn't eat anymore. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Yang Zhou Fried Rice (barbequed pork) and the Peking Roast Duck (green onions, cucumber, hoisin sauce, house made buns.) We thought the fried was average. It tasted like your regular Chinese fast food restaurant fried rice but with less soy sauce. The pork tasted old to me. My girlfriend thought the duck was good when you add the sauce and put everything into the bun but by itself it lacked flavor. She also thought the duck was a little too dry. \n\nService:\n\nOur waitress Chelsea was very nice. When I showed Chelsea the hair in my soup she immediately apologized and said she will let the manager know right away and the manager will come over to talk to me. Chelsea offered to bring out a new soup. When I declined and told her no thank you Chelsea asked me if I wanted anything else on the menu. I told her no thanks. The manager never came over to our table to address the hair in my soup. I think it's very unprofessional that the manager didn't come over to our table and literally take a few seconds out of their day to address the issue. This is how you lose customers because to me it clearly shows that the manager didn't care or even think it was a huge deal that there was a hair in my soup. Any time there is a complaint or any discrepancy in a restaurant by a customer it is normally standard protocol for a manager to handle the situation accordingly. The manager at M.Y. China failed to do that! Of course the soup was taken off of our bill. \n\nOverall:\n\nAfter having two bad experiences at M.Y. China I can definitely say that my girlfriend and I will never eat there again! M.Y. China must be losing a lot of customers especially if a manager can't take a few seconds out of his or her day to come apologize for a hair being in a customer's soup! M.Y. China has fallen off our go to list of Chinese restaurants. \n\n****ATTENTION!!! Martin Yan, if you're reading this you need to go back to this restaurant and regulate on them! If you don't I guarantee you'll be losing business on a consistent basis. I think you're an awesome chef and I know they're not producing the quality food or service that you represent.", "author": "David R."}

We arrived 30 min before closing and the place was still hopping.\nThe fact that it's in a mall is a little weird but once we were seated it felt like an actual Resturant. The decor was Asian Modern and the tables running down the center were creative in the ways that can be reconfigured. Lots of ways to seat large parties. \nLove the big open kitchen and watching everyone hustling around.\nWe shared our order and there was plenty for leftovers if that's your bag.  Our water glasses were never empty! We started with the Juicy Seafood Dumplings. They came out crazy hot and filled with flavor. The wrapper was a little thick. The Dumpling sauce was spicy and tangy. For dinner, we had the Szechuan Green Beans and the Chairman Maos Chicken. It was excellent. It was spicy and had loads of vegetables. The chicken was in big chunks and really moist on the inside. The exterior was lightly coated and not greasy. It was a great way to enjoy this dish.  \nTo top off this meal we ordered the Sugary Egg Puffs that were served with a bland Chantilly Cream, Chocolate Dipping Sauce and a perfectly complimentary Raspberry Coulis.  These deserts were light and fluffy and the perfect finale. \nWould definitely go back as the experience was great and food properly spiced and arrived hot.", "author": "Marti C."}

Our bill came out to be about $92 after tax and before tip.\n\nWe ordered the Big Knife Noodles, Wild Boar Lettuce Cups, the pickles trio, the wok lamb, hot and sour soup, spicy mango sorbet and the lychee panna cotta.\nThe lamb was ok... I definitely had better tasting lamb at other restaurants. It was also a little salty. \nThe big knife noodles were good, the noodles itself were very good and it had a good amount of shrimp, scallops and mushrooms. The egg in this was salty for some reason. The pickles trio was really good! I enjoyed eating that in between eating other dishes. The wild board lettuce cups were pretty good too! I was sad they only come in 2. For dessert, definitely try the lychee panna cotta! If you're a fan of chrysanthemum... you'll definitely like this! For me, that was my favorite dish. The spicy mango sorbet was just OK... It tastes like mango sherbet from Talenti... the taste is quite similar so I wasn't too impressed there, yet it was still good.\n\nBTW, the bathrooms are bit weird. So it's co-ed... I felt a little weirded out to share a sink with a man but the bathrooms are clean and the towels are so soft.

We sat on patio area under the dome and I love it there.  Now I must say my review is based on the vegetarian options more specifically the mapo tofu.  I got that both times, but the last time I went it was gooey and looked uneatable, but I was hungry so pushed through it.  The tofu was good, but the sauce just did not look right and it was way too salty for me. I think next time I will just get the green beans.  I was also disappointed that they use some chicken powder in the sweet and sour soup grr.  I actually got it last time not knowing that and it was good lol.  However, this time I realized it was not vegetarian so couldn't knowingly get it.  Oh well.  I'm sure I will give this place another go.  Perhaps next time will be better.  I will say that our sever was very attentive and sweet.\n\n\nI've been back a few times after my last review and I will say it has improved so I gave this place one more star.

I liked a few of the dishes, but I think you're better off paying for a cab (or Muni) and going to Inner Sunset for more authentic food.\n\nBeef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup ($14) - A tad bit salty on the broth, there was enough rib eye, but I don't think I would get this again. Just okay.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles ($14) - Again, probably 30% more than what you'd pay at any other Chinese restaurant for the same taste. The noodles themselves were great and chewy - this was my favorite dish. I wasn't sure what wild boar was supposed to taste like, the meat tasted like regular pork to me.\n\nWok Seared Beef Filet ($16) - Honestly, I can't remember what this tasted like, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.

So you get all the appearances of an expensive meal without any of the calm, relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThe food, it should be said, is quite good. We ordered a few different noodle dishes, some heavily-cumined lamb chops, some fresh-tasting pea shoots, and some excellent roast duck with all the trimmings.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-01", "description": "I recently ate at MY China w/my GF prior to a performance at the Golden Gate Theater.  I hesitate to give it only 2 stars but it is really all that it deserves.  Here's why.\n\nI did not expect MY China to prepare \"authentic\" home cooked Chinese food but I did expect them to prepare an elevated version of Chinese dishes that would justify the high prices they charge at this restaurant and IMO they failed to do this.\n\nFirst off, I must say that we had a very pleasant server who accommodated our request for a change in tables but she was not very well trained.  She did not know what a Blue Sapphire Martini was and another server had to come to our table w/her for clarification about the drink.  She also could not answer some questions that we had about the menu. She got the answers for us but had to ask, which I think is an indication of lack of training.  \n\nNot the fault of the server but one of the answers we got was unacceptable for a restaurant that aspires to be a high quality restaurant.  I was interested in the steamed fish and asked what kind of fish it was, how large the fish was and whether it was fresh or frozen.  I was told it was sea bass, that it was only a 6 oz portion and that it was FROZEN.   You can buy a fresh 2 lb sea bass for about $10 at the fish market and, even if MY China doesn't have the room for a fish tank, they can certainly source FRESH fish for a $32 dish.  Obviously, we passed on that.\n\nIn order to get a feel for the type of food MY China offered, we ordered the Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders, the Mu Shu Pork Tacos, the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Abalone in Oyster Essence.  We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, Big Knife Fish Noodles and a side of Sichuan Green Beans.\n\nLet me start by saying the BEST dish that we were served was the Abalone in Oyster \"Sauce.\"  It was the closest thing to REAL Chinese food that we were served and it was EXCELLENT!!!  Well worth the $18 for the roughly 3-4\" long abalone that was served whole.  It was tender and succulent dressed in properly seasoned oyster sauce. \n\nHowever, the rest of the dishes were either uninspiring or totally off-putting.\n\nThe pork sliders and mu shu pork tacos were just ok.  I like bacon and pork belly and was hoping the sliders would be unique. There was nothing particularly WRONG about them, they were just bland and uninteresting.  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork sliders was what you'd expect from MY China -- a modern take on the classic mu shu pork dish.  It came w/mu shu flavored pork pieces in a bun (thicker than you'd get w/a normal mu shu pork dish) but it didn't have the same taste/texture of mu shu pork that is commonly served.  I particularly missed the slivered green onions and hoisin sauce that is typically offered w/mu shu pork.  It may have been in there but I didn't notice it.  An ok dish but again relatively bland and uninteresting.\n\nThe Salt/Pepper Calamari was NOTHING like the salt/pepper calamari you'd get at a typical Chinese restaurant. For one this, it was VERY greasy.  I liked that they included the tentacles, which many Americanized Chinese restaurants leave out because some people can't handle the sight of them (let alone eat them), BUT the  tentacles and other body parts were very large and not bite sized.  The coating on the calamari was also so soaked in oil, it did not have any \"crunch\" which you would normally get w/fried calamari and there were really wasn't much spice in the dish.\n\nKung Pao Chicken is a very common dish served in almost every Chinese restaurant, whether it's Cantonese, Mandarin or actually Szechuan where it originated.  The dish we got had very large deep fried pieces of chicken in it; I prefer it stir fried.  Like the calamari it was VERY greasy and, although it had a lot of dried red chilies in it, it oddly did NOT taste very spicy\n\nThe Big Knife Fish Noodles was basically seafood chow mein, which supposedly included scallops, shrimp and calamari along w/shitaki & enoki mushrooms in XO sauce. Saw the shitaki/enoki mushrooms but didn't see much in the way of scallops or shrimp. This dish was also VERY greasy and, despite the XO sauce, seemed bland and not adequately seasoned.  \n\nLastly, read good reviews about the Sichuan Green Beans on Yelp which we thought would be an appropriate companion w/the chicken and seafood.  However, there was really nothing special about this dish either, except that it was also VERY greasy and lacked spice, which one would expect w/a Sichuan dish.\n\nAll in all a GREAT disappointment given the generally poor quality of the dishes we received and the cost - about $160 including the tax/tip, the martini (which was very good) and a bottle of Prosecco (which was also acceptable although an ice bucket was not available to chill it.\n\nIf I were to eat at MY China again, which is unlikely, I'd sit at the bar and just order from their discounted Happy Hour menu instead.  Unfortunately, I think anyone else eating/drinking there would fair much better doing that as well.", "author": "Martin C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-07", "description": "The one thing I really miss since moving from the Sunset to SOMA is good and inexpensive Chinese food. I had a random craving and was going to have dinner with my sister, so I decided it was the perfect opportunity to try out Martin Yan's new restaurant! I knew it was going to be a bit pricey since it is Martin Yan's restaurant and it's in the mall where a bunch of tourists go shopping, but I was willing to suck it up just to try it at least once.\n\nWalking in, we had no problem getting our table (I made reservations online just in case). Upon being seated, we were asked if we wanted complimentary still or sparkling water. My sister and I both requested sparkling water and a bottle of sparkling water was brought to our table. Since it's nearing Chinese New Year, they had a special menu that started at $68/person. Definitely not what I wanted to spend on a casual dinner, so we opted to order ala carte.\n\nA waitress introduced herself to us, but then for some reason, once we were ready to order, another guy took our order and ended up being our waiter for the rest of the meal. \n\nAnyways, we ordered the whole wheat pot stickers, the walnut shrimp, and the hong kong style crispy noodles with chicken. We asked if they could do the scissor cut noodles with chicken instead of wild boar and they wouldn't do that substitution (fail!).\n\nWe got our pot stickers to start and while they looked pretty, they lacked flavor. Even the dipping sauce that appeared to have chili flakes in it wasn't very spicy or flavorful. When our entrees came out, the walnut shrimp came out first and then about 3-5 minutes later, our hong kong style crispy noodles with chicken dish arrived. The waiter promptly came to our table and apologized a few times, saying that he had no control over when the dishes came out, regardless of how it was written on the ticket. This was both a bit awkward (I honestly didn't care about waiting the few minutes for the second entree, yet he kept apologizing) and telling of the gaps in their service. Regardless, this is where I really got disappointed: the noodles, although nice and crispy, didn't have much flavor from the sauce. Additionally, the chicken's texture was a bit odd to me. I loved that they didn't skimp and that they were bit chunks of chicken breast, but when it was lacking in taste, none of that mattered. I think I picked out the mushrooms and baby bok choy to eat in hopes of using the textural differences to make up for the missing flavor. The walnut shrimp wasn't the walnut shrimp I'm typically used to and was definitely disappointing. Although the quality of the ingredients was known by the size of the shrimp, they almost seemed a bit dry. The sweet, fatty sauce that usually coats the shrimp was nearly obsolete! There was also plenty of sliced cucumbers accompanying the shrimp, but very little of the candied walnuts.\n\nTo be honest, the restaurant design is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Tables that slide together and apart to accommodate parties of various sizes and an open kitchen that allowed you to see the chefs make the noodles from scratch were some of my highlights. Additionally, the staff seemed to be on par with quick, efficient, and professional service. The food, while it was obvious it was prepared with quality ingredients, lacked flavor. For the price, I would expect something much more tasty, wanting me to devour it all, rather than leave half on the plate.", "author": "Leana L."}

Parents decided to celebrate here since they've always have gone here before with no fuss or problem.   My dad arrives early at the bar before our reservation.   We sit at the bar for a good 5 to 10 minutes until the bartender finally takes our order.  He notes it, takes it down (in a hurry mind you) and IMMEDIATELY starts chatting with some customers he was familiar with.   So  this is the part that pissed me off, royally. \n\n1.  We just ordered two drinks, a cocktail, beer and an appetizer- nothing special.  He not only hurries with the order but manages to cheese it up with customers he knew. \n\n2.  10 minutes have passed and we're still wondering where our drinks are.    The bartender has already served his \"favorite\" customers and here we are still wondering where did our measly three orders go.  \n\n3. Finally 15-20 minutes have passed and this bartender was still socializing with customers while NEW customers were coming in and their drinks were also being served with haste.  \n\n4. Fearing that this wait for our order might make us lose our table, we finally we decide to just cancel.  We ask the bartender what happened to the order and all he can say RUDELY and BLUNTLY was \"oh okay i'll just transfer it\".  \n\nNo apologies, nothing.  Like as if he were taking away from his social hour.  \n\nAnd continues to socialize some more.     \n\nThis bartender needs work\nWe were avid fans of this restaurant but now not so much.    \n\n***Although this experience was pretty bad especially for mothers day, your floor manager Christopher and our server, Daniel made an AWESOME  job with the service.  (Gave extra tip)  Much props for these guys.   \n\n\nSo the take away:  the food is good but your bartender needs to work on expediting and customer service/satisfaction (or just let him go, seriously).    He might've not been aware but still, it affects customers greatly.", "author": "Geo D."}

The Mai Tai was really strong.\n\nThe food was pretty good.  The green beans was very flavorful.  The Bang Bang Chicken Wings are the right crisp and and flavor, will definitely go back for this.  The other thing that was pretty good is the Wild Boar Juicy Dumplings.  It came out individually in their own spoon, which was useful and all the juices are definitely there.  \n\nI think I would go back and try the full menu sometimes.

The beef is flavorful, there's a good mix of vegetables, the noodles are a good texture, and the broth is rich and flavorful.  It's not necessarily like other beef noodle soups I've had, but it's one I thoroughly enjoy.\n\nAside from the noodle soup, the restaurant has a rather diverse selection of items to choose from, and they are all a cut above your standard chinese food fare.  The dessert menu is great as well.  Be assured ... if you order the Peking Duck or Crab, you will get a lot of food!\n\nThe weakest item I've had at M.Y. China was the Kung Pao chicken, which is surprisingly bland and dry.  I usually judge restaurants by the Kung Pao chicken, but, in this case, it's the exception and not the rule.\n\nOf course, to top things off, this place is not cheap, but not very expensive either.  There's also a lot of seating so I've found it hasn't been hard to drop in and get seated.  To sum it up, I can always count on a solid meal when I come to M.Y. China.", "author": "Richard K."}

But I can only imagine the disappointment my boyfriend felt having such a terrible experience at a restaurant owned by one of his culinary idols. \n\nWe ordered the bang bang chicken wings, hong kong crispy noodle and wok seared beef. The food was ok, though, the bang bang chicken wings was actually quiet delicious - but the service? HORRIBLE. \n\nIt is one of our pet peeves when our main entrees are served before our appetizers. The seared beef was served before our appetizers, and without the side of rice. We stared at the beef while we waited for our appetizers and the rest of our food. Our cripsy noodle then comes - and we're still waiting on our appetizer. I flag down the waiter to ask where it is.. apparently, \"amber forgot to punch it in\" OK. \n\nThe crispy noodle was good, but the chicken that came with it was BLAND. So we asked for some chili paste, 10 minutes...30 minutes .. no chili paste. Then the waiter comes to refill our water and says \"ohh you guys wanted chili paste right?\" 10 minutes..30 minutes later..\" STILL NO CHILI PASTE. We finished our food, still no chili paste. Then another waiter comes around bearing some chili paste and serves it to  the guests a couple of tables over. Confused,  the customer rejects it. The waiter then YELLS around  \"did anyone order chili paste?!\" When we tried to call him to let him know we asked for it  but we didn't need it anymore (Since we'd already eaten our food), he'd already walked away. \n\nThe entire time, my boyfriend and I just watched as the joke of a service they had in the surrounding tables continues. Food and drinks were continously served at wrong tables. The table across us had a mother andher son impatiently waiting to get attention from a waiter.  The funniest thing was watching a waiter clean a table and as he walked away with the dirty dishes, a chopstick falls on the floor - instead of picking it up, he kicks the chopstick around on the floor. LMFAO, my boyfriend and I couldn't help but laugh. The service was such a joke that at one point, I forgot I was at Martin Yan's restaurant. If it wasn't for the cookbook with his face displayed all over the place, I would have thought I was in some random chinese restaurant, but then those restaurants would probably have better service. \n\nOur waiter comped the bang bang chicken wings and was eventually served once we were done eating. If it wasn't for the those delicious chicken wings, I would have left the restaurant so annoyed. \n\nOur waiter was nice and he offered us comped dessert which we didn't take as we were afraid it would take a long time to be served. I understand they were busy but we expected better trained waiters. \n\nLater that night, I asked my boyfriend if he still considered Martin Yan as one of his culinary idols - he looked at me with such disappointment and with a sigh he says \"After that experience, not anymore\".", "author": "Joey D."}

The pork was not what we were expecting, but very good- sliced BBQ cured pork In a light, sweet honey glaze sauce. Seafood dumpling were steamed, in a spinach noodle wrapper, and delicious. Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli) was a highlight, just crunchy enough, with lots of lightly cooked garlic, and just curling slices of sausage.

(; With such low expectations, I was definitely in for a pleasant surprise (especially after finding out M.Y. stood for Martin Yan)!\n\nThis is not your typical hole-in-the-wall, bad-service Chinese restaurant. In fact, far from it! Upon entering through the front, one of their hosts greeted me by my name when I told him that I was meeting two former colleagues for dinner and then he proceeded to escort me to the table. My immediate thought was: 'Whoa! What just happened here?! What kind of Chinese restaurant is this?!' \n\nAs we walked through the restaurant, the second most striking difference was their d\u00e9cor; it was sleek and modern yet elegant and tactful. Not only was each table covered with white, fancy-looking linens, but each table was also decorated with classy dinnerware. Needless to say, I was impressed by their exceptional customer service and decor, especially since I'm so used to the negligent customer service I receive from most Asian restaurants.\n\nThough the menu is reminiscent of your typical Chinese restaurant, it won't come out looking like your ordinary Chinese food. All of the dishes that we ordered were creatively designed to include many bright-colored food and beautifully arranged on modern plates or bowls. The food presentation was absolutely amazing! It certainly deserves a picture-taking moment.\n\nTheir food tastes just as delicious as they look! We ordered...\n+Spicy Seafood Dumplings: This appetizer includes six dumplings perfectly wrapped in a bright spinach wrap and stuffed with scallops and shrimp. The sauce gives the dumplings a kick of flavor without being overpowered with the spiciness.\n+Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood: The squid ink snap noodles are saut\u00e9ed with vegetables and a variety of seafood, including shrimp, scallops, and calamari in a creamy sauce. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish! It's absolutely delicious.\n\n(Note: When they presented us with this dish we were confused and thought they had given us the wrong dish because we were expecting to see long noodle strands. So, imagine our surprise when we saw short, dark, doughy-looking pieces of something that looked really foreign to us. Yes, those foreign things are in fact the squid ink noodles.)\n\n+Stir Fried Green Beans: These crunchy green beans are saut\u00e9ed in a light, somewhat spicy sauce, and are a wonderful complement to the entr\u00e9e dishes we ordered.\n+Kung Pao Chicken: This dish includes a combination of stir-fried chicken, jalape\u00f1o, peanuts, and crunchy red dried peppers. The crunchy red dried peppers will surprise you!\n+Forbidden Rice: This is a combination of red rice, brown rice, barley, and wolfberries. With so much flavor and texture packed in this rice dish, it certainly didn't taste like my usual, healthy brown rice dish. Definitely a nice addition to the other dishes!\n+Sugar Egg Puffs: Four huge egg puffs filled with a custard cream filling served with three different kinds of sauces, including dark chocolate, vanilla bean Chantilly cr\u00e8me, and raspberry coulis. It tasted delicious with or without the sauce.\n\nI must admit that the portions are much smaller than what I had expected, especially for the price we were charged. But, the phenomenal presentation and delicious food, accompanied with the great customer service and beautiful d\u00e9cor do seem to justify the higher prices. Overall, it's a great place to enjoy great food with great company!

It was not like any 'boar' i have ever tasted. The dish was tasty but not for $14 freakin bucks!! I would order it again if it was $6/7 max (and I'm being generous). We thought that they gave us the wrong dish because the boar was so 'cheap' tasting and you dont even cut the noodles with scissors like the waiter said. Not convinced? See for yourself but dont say that I didn't warn you. \n\nThen -- the squid ink noodles is NOT noodles (see below). It's like square pieces of pasta. My friend and I were really excited to swirl our forks around some noodles. Nay! Didn't happen. Disappointment once again. It's misinterpretion if you ask me.\n\nNOODLES, by definition, is the following as per dictionary.com:\na narrow strip of unleavened egg dough that has been rolled thin and dried, boiled, and served alone or in soups, casseroles, etc.\n\nI mean it was tasty, but not $18 tasty and its not even noodles.\n\nSo basically you get my point.

Our waiters were really friendly and were happy to offer suggestions on the menu. Since we had a large group, we got to try most of the menu. My favorites were:\nSpicy Seafood Dumplings\nHong Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken\nSquid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood\nPurple Yam Croquette\nSugar Egg Puffs\n\nThese were good with minor flaws:\nHar Gow (the dumpling stuck to the bottom of the steamer)\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp (slightly more breading then I would like)\n\nBut these were really tiny faults and they would have gotten 5 stars, except that I ordered Chairman Mao's Chicken that never appeared.

We apologetically explained to her that we loved the dumplings and that we traditionally eat them the Chinese way with a lot of ginger and she defensively told us \"well our thing is the vinegar\". Yes, we understand, that's why we asked for the vinegar WITH the ginger. I didn't know that the policy here was BYOG--bring your own ginger, otherwise I would have brought like 5. What happened to the customer is always right, especially when it's her birthday and we had humbly asked for just ginger and already decided we would pay for it.

Sure, whisper it's not like I would understand you if you screamed.  \n\nAnyway my soup came. Decent flavor, not overly salty, wontons big. \n\nThe dim sum was good, pretty comparable to dim sum in Chinatown. Except the farmers roll or whatever it was called. Terrible flavor. \n\nThe service was really lackluster. The server brought the check with the food.

The hand pulled beef noodle soup and ginger fried crab and xlb soup dumplings were all some of the best I've had. \nI think there is a certain amount of prestige being inside the mall and this restaurant certainly lives up to the standards of class which the neighboring restaurants have set. Everything from the chopsticks to the decor to the soda water to the classy service is well refined and gives off a sense of elegance. As westernized as the facade is, they window off the kitchen for viewing to proudly display the Chinese chefs for a sense of authenticity in the food. The best part is, every once in a while this chef comes by for a little pulled noodle performance, showing you how they... Pull the noodles.

Despite reminding me of P.F. Chang's in certain ways, M.Y. China is an enjoyable eatery that is charmingly similar to Martin Yan.  M.Y. China features authentic and flavorful, yet unpretentious, Chinese food in a sleek and spotless setting that lies somewhere between chic and kitschy.  I enjoyed their refined version of Taiwanese-style beef noodle soup, which features hand pulled noodles and generous cuts of beef short rib (rather than the traditional beef cut that is as challenging as it is chewy and often leaves remnants stuck between one's teeth).  The noodles were a bit too soft, but the rich broth was was beefy and bold with just enough heat.  I also enjoyed the gailan (Chinese broccoli) with traditional Cantonese sausage and slices of sauteed garlic.  Lunch time seems busy, but we were able to sit at the counter without waiting.  \n\nAs an added bonus (some might say), we were treated to a performance of the resident noodlemaker pulling and lassoing noodles, and bopping to \"Gangnam Style,\" which was blasting from speakers attached to his apron.  The momentary show was awkwardly charming.", "author": "Chris T."}

The waitress dropped us a hint that it was probably enough food for 3 vs just the 2 required, so with 4 people we got that and added a few dishes (salt and pepper crab, snow pea sprouts, seafood fried rice, and the chicken wings).  The salt and pepper crab was really tasty (only ~$40 market price), but I still slightly prefer R&Gs or ABC's salted egg yolk crab. \n\nEverything we had was delicious and while done up a bit, still also satisfied my craving for authentic chinese food.

The noodles, however, were our favorite dish at this spot and perhaps my favorite Chinese-style noodles overall.

The food was really good and the decors were very pretty as well. They serve Chinese fusion food.

To be honest, who cares if it is authentic or not, as long as it tastes good, that's all that matters. Everything we tried were pretty damn good but I was most impressed by the Spicy Seafood Dumplings and Lychee Panna Cotta. The Spicy Seafood Dumplings was HELLA BOMB!!!! It was so flavorful and the spiciness was just enough. SO GOOD! The Lychee Panna Cotta was a unique dessert, which has chrysanthemum essence in it.

The other side of this is that any parent who takes young kids to a nice restaurant after 6pm deserves whatever happens to them. Keeping this in mind we went as a family of 4 (with an 18 month old and a 4 year old) to M.Y. China last week because we thought it would be a fun experience for the kids to see noodle pulling while the adults got to eat decent food. \n\nEven though the meal was rushed because our 18 month old loved the restaurant so much he wanted to run around, climb on everything and watch all the action behind the glass in the kitchen, it was a good experience. \n\nIt started off a little weird when the hostess had to go ask someone for special permission to seat us in a corner booth, which seemed like the best choice for  family. But we warned our server right away that we would have to eat quick because our youngest gets restless after about 20 minutes. I really appreciated that they had a good attitude about the kids and they brought out the food incredibly fast. We ordered a lot of different dishes and enjoyed them all even though we were rushed in eating them. The kids both loved the wantons in the soup and the wild boar scissor cut noodles. We tried the 3 different dumpling sampler but couldn't tell the difference between them, which again could be because my wife and I were taking turns taking our youngest out the restaurant to watch the light display on the ceiling. \n\nThe one thing we wanted to see was the noodle pulling. Since it was earlier in the dinner service they weren't going around and doing it in the dining room. I mentioned to the server that the kids would want to see it and he said he would be sure to tell us if they pulled some noodles in the kitchen. A few minutes later someone who I assume was a manager came out and actually made a point to tell us what time they would start and that he would make sure he came back and got us. I was really impressed that they took the time to make sure we had a good experience.\n\nI don't feel that I can give a really detailed analysis of the food because it was a rushed dinner but M.Y. China does deserve recognition for the level of hospitality they extended to us. I would love to go back again as a family, when our youngest is a little older.", "author": "Tim C."}

You can see the cook staff make them while you wait for food.\n\nThings That Were Not So Awesome:\n---Busy!  Well it just opened and it's the holidays.  I can't completely blame M.Y. China for that.\n---Food service.  Apparently it was a 'backwards' food presentation.  Somehow my appetizer (wild boar soup dumplings) came out last and my main order (beef noodle soup) came out first.\n---Beef noodle soup.  Noodles were amazing.  The broth reminded me of something I would eat at a cheaper Chinese restaurant or even King of Thai.  Broth was still good, just not the mind-blowing expectations that I had from a Martin Yan menu.\n\nRandom Note:\nDid someone just line up and say 'Party of 15' on a Friday night in downtown San Francisco with likely no reservations?  Yes, someone did that while I was waiting for my table.\n\nSit at the bar area facing the kitchen.  Watching an army of cooks create dishes is an awesome way to pass the time.", "author": "Christine L."}

Recently, though, I saw M.Y. China featured on Check Please Bay Area; it looked pretty good, so we decided to check it out. \n\nWe have Chinese food quite often so we have a lot to compare this with, and our meal here was really very good. We had the hot and sour soup (as good as any I've had in the city), crispy fried tofu with sweet and sour sauce (too spicy for my husband, but perfect for me); Beijing knife cut noodles with pork, mushrooms and a spicy black bean sauce; and scissor cut noodles with wild boar and julienned raw vegetables. We liked every dish, but the noodles were a special treat, both because they are not the run-of-the-mill noodle dishes you find at every Chinese restaurant and because they were *super* delicious! \n\nOur server, Daniel, was extraordinarily attentive, bringing us tastes of wine and giving us many useful recommendations about the menu. \n\nA number of reviewers have commented about the prices. The check for the two of was about $50 not including drinks. (It would have been higher if we'd had the kobe beef, crab, or lobster.) It's surely true that you can have delicious Chinese food in San Francisco for a lot less (though not in this location). The food here was very good (especially the noodle dishes), and the service was also very good. We felt the prices were in line with the quality of the food and the dining experience, and we will happily return to try a few other dishes.", "author": "David K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-21", "description": "A very wise and experienced Hong Kong food critic said it best.\n\n\"Western folks value decor and service more than food at times, and factor those into the dining experience criteria. But it is the opposite for Chinese people...so long as the food is first and foremost excellent, the rest do not matter.\" Basically a restaurant can splurge several fortunes into making a place look snazzy that would make cougars proud to be partaking in Happy Hour before dragging conquests back home for some happy endings post Happy Hour, but if  the entrees and main courses don't deliver, what is the point of eating there. \n\nLuckily for many of us in the SF Bay Area, MY China in a way has both, but done in a way that it satisfies everyone.\n\nI know what $trait$ Restaurant represents, and their approach I do not agree with.\n\nThis time round, I think I enjoyed the experience just a slight more than prior.\n\nWild boar lettuce cups (Appetizer) - this is a bit of a remix on the tried and true minced squab lettuce cups with hoisin sauce. The addtion of fried bean thread like vermicelli added an extra layer of crispy textures, and with the julienne wild boar that was nicely stir fried and juicy, made this a real winner. Two cups per order, enough to share. Would that be Two Girls One Cup, One Dude Two Cups? Dunno, but these B Cups were awesome. B for Boar, that is. \n\nWild boar scissor cut noodles - we sat near the counter and saw one of the kitchen staff carefully use scissors to cut a ball of dough. He was clearly taking his time, and each piece of noodle looked pretty thin. Thus we were guessing if he was practicing and whether we would get the trial art and craft project stir fried (and he seemed to be taking his time doing so, versus first visit when the scissor cut noodle chef was slicing and dicing the dough at breakneck pace). The decision to request \"less salt, less oil\" was a good one (although somehow it became no salt no oil for some lost in translation reason). This arrived piping hot and very nicely stir fried. It was almost like a properly done moo shoo (luckily not moo shoo poo poo, that's something else entirely like uhm... PF). And this is where it is crucial to kick things up a notch and get some house chili sauce, which definitely elevated this. In retrospect, I should have asked for some XO sauce to try. Definitely the Chinese version of Cinghiale pasta, but stir fried.\n\nHoney glazed BBQ pork (cha siu) - It's $10 a plate, and while you can get half a pound or a takeout box for that much at the run down roasties deli shop, it is always fun to try a plate of this at a high end restaurant. It's a good taste tester for the kitchen, and a very welcoming popular BBQ item (honey glazed BBQ pork, what is there not to like unless you are a meat hating hipster but craves bacon wrapped sausages once in a while?). Generally lean for the most part, yet each bite was tender and juicy all the way through. A very delicate marinade, although the final roasting process probably had a tad too sweet of a molasses splash. The best part? Picking up a random slice (closer to the edges) thinking it's all lean, and when you bite into it, there's a portion of fat that somehow crept in. It melts in your mouth like warm sweet butter and honey, and suddenly you feel like you were shot into the skies. Or akin to eating at your favorite sushi bar, and the chef gives you a run of the mill looking item, and when you eat it you discover there's toro, uni, and wagyu in it. So yeah, this cha siu is great...yet subtly pornographic...like reading a novel called \"50 Shades Of Pork\".   \n\nSo no, ordering BBQ pork appetizer plate at a nicer Cantonese Chinese restaurant during dinner, is not an unusual thing. We don't have restaurants like Tin Lung Heen in Hong Kong that take Spanish Iberico black pig and use premium cuts to make cha siu.l...so places like Koi Palace and even MYC offering something like this that may be above average for expats, and very decent according to \"King Of FOBenese Food\", ain't so bad.\n\nStir fried bok choy with salted fish - when this arrived, it was as if the veggies were quickly clear stir fried with very little to no oil, and was very bland. Turns out our waitress misheard my \"less salt less oil\" and thought we meant \"no salt no oil\", and the kitchen withheld the salted fish (which she said was oily). We had this taken back and what a difference it made afterwards. The salted fish quantity and enhancement was not strong, but did make the dish taste better. Was half the price of large pea sprout with garlic ($16), so if you want your greens on, this is a safe choice.\n\n4 dishes for two, came out to a shade over $50, which is not unreasonable for the location, quality, and to factor in d\u00e9cor and service. Plus you get some free shows of hand pulled noodles every now and then, plus scissor cutting of noodles.\n\nToo bad Martin wasn't in the house. Would have told him his BBQ pork was quite pornographic in the fatty areas.", "author": "Ken K."}

We ordered the hand cut wild boar noodles (a must), sauteed pea shoots (a little too overcooked). I would order the string beans instead. My husband ordered the glazed walnuts and shrimp which was a generous portion and so yummy. My friend ordered onion pancakes. I ordered sichuan peppered beef (very tender and succulent on a bed of arugula and steamed bass which was tasty but expensive for the portion.

I would forego the dim sum because there are so many excellent dim sum houses all over the Bay Area. Yes, this was an expensive lunch but it was for a very special occasion in a modern, comfortable airy setting as we sat towards the outside. M.Y.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-26", "description": "After reading mixed reviews on yelp of this place, I was hesitant to even consider MY China for dinner on a Friday night. It was a toss up between MY China or Hakkasan. But did I really want to spend $$$$ for my two boys?!  Love them, but not really. At least not that night.  I was surprised I was able to book a last minute rez on a Friday night at 8pm for my family of four.  It should have been a sign....\n\nSo after being seated in their \"patio\"-which is just their space outside the restaurant facing the shoppers passing by- we waited, and waited, and waited for other tables to get served and refilled their drinks, and it almost got to the point where I was going to the front of the restaurant and ask for the manager. But I'm glad that point never came. It would not have looked very good.  Our server finally showed up.\n\nNeedless to say, we were ready to order. Considering we ordered appetizers, noodles, fried rice and a salad, the timing of the food was all out of sorts:\n\nThe first entr\u00e9e that came out wasn't our appetizers, it was our wild boar Scissor Cut Noodles. Delicious!  My boys (age 8 and 12) didn't have enough of it!  But was it wild boar? I'm not sure. I've had boar in previous meals before but the meat was so thinly sliced, it could have been beef tongue for all I know!\n\nNext entrees that came out was the fried rice. My little one wanted pork with the fried rice instead of the scallops. Again the meat was so small, you could barely make out the meat. But I was really disappointed with the egg whites in the fried rice. Should have paid better attention to the menu. Anyway, this was by far the worst fried rice I ever had!  I'm still cringing at the thought that I paid $10 for this side dish.  Arghhhh....\n\nOk, moving along.... apparently appetizers of bang bang chicken wings came out boneless. Not sure if we got someone else's order or if their ordering system really translates \"sauce on the side\" to be \"boneless\" like our server stated. But I didn't want to send it back to try and figure out what it would even taste like without the orange chicken like sauce. And my pork belly sliders were on the mediocre side. One of my sliders was actually wet. Hopefully from the steam and not something else.\n\nNext entr\u00e9e that came was Chairman Mao's chicken.  I'm not sure where the sweet and spicy sauce is but there was a lot of red peppers. Like a lot!  For a table that asked for it not to be spicy, I think their ordering system mistranslated my order.... Again!  \n\nAt this point, we're stuffed and guess what comes out last?!  The mixed green salad with papaya and shrimp. At least that was good compared to everything else that came out of the kitchen before it. And looking at the salad, I'm glad their ordering system didn't mistranslate this one!  \n\nOverall, I'm glad I came in to check it out and happy that my boys can say they had wild boar. Loved the ambiance and the antiques.  Aside from that, I don't think I'll return until their ordering system passes an ESL course.", "author": "Mey S."}

It looked like a fancy place ($$) and the bf and I were excited to try it.\n\nI had the wild boar scissor cut noodles and I thought wild boar was going to be such a new and exotic meat. It really wasn't. The texture was a cross between chicken and beef because it was soft and a little chewy. The meat to noodle ratio was really off and I barely had enough scraps of wild boar to even let the bf have a decent taste. The flavors were good though, but the overall dish is not worth the price.

Always crammed, hosts sit customers squeezed in between tables, hosts are reluctant to sit customers where there is some decent, roomy space. Martin Yan adds to the pretentious image by asking us to see how \"skillful\" his cooks are (what a brat!). That REALLY turned me off!! Also, their floor is filthy with food particles and oils that fall on it as busy servers and dish bussers busily run back and forth with their trays. The unclean floor is a major turn-off to me, though, because it does not fit the image that this restaurant tries so hard to portray.\n\nThe waiter brings--or is supposed to bring, if he/she turns out to be one of the distracted ones--water nicely bottled by the house, plus the customer has the option of getting complimentary sparkling water, which, I believe, is a big plus. Their portions are generous--any dish can be shared by two--which makes it, really, a not expensive restaurant. Their service inconsistent: sometimes fast and attentive, sometimes unprofessional--some waiters get distracted, some others are overly casual (remember: overly casual equals unprofessional and may mean something worse). The ambiance is pleasant, not that noisy, since the place has good acoustics--the ambiance noise in the restaurant doesn't get amplified, therefore one can always carry out a conversation, as crowded and busy as it always tends to be. \n\nMy favorite dish is the Forbidden Rice and my favorite cocktail drink is the East Meets West.

I hate to give 4 stars but I will admit I think we did some poor ordering. To start with the FANTASTIC, their shui mai dumplings will literally knock your socks right off right there at the table in the middle of the Westfield Mall. The sauce that comes with these dumplings I literally want to carry it in my bag for emergencies. It's outrageous. The onion pancakes were also incredibly tasty. Anywhere else I've ordered onion pancakes they usually come with some type of sauce and these didn't which I found strange but we used the dumpling sauce and literally just unlocked the gates to flavour town. We ordered pork bao and they were fine but again no sauce and those bao are a little dry without a sauce. Now to things I would do without next time- the wonton soup and kung pao chicken. I ordered the wonton soup because I'd been sick and it really sounded like a good idea at the time but honestly it was just broth and two wontons and some scallions and I just didn't feel strongly about it. I do still  feel strongly about how much I hated the kung pao chicken though. It was so dry and don't come with that sweet and sour glaze and it literally was just like eating sandpaper without it. I literally had one bite and we packed it up to try to give away to a homeless person but I literally couldn't have more than one bite.

The service is friendly and prompt, and very professional.\n\nBut this just set the stage for higher expectations on the food, which for me were unfortunately not met. The avocado and shrimp spring rolls sounded like an exciting combination, but lacked fresh herbs and was in fact mostly rice noodles. Bland. For the price, I would expect something special, and at the very least a little fresh mint. also, it was served with a mustard dipping sauce (I hate mustard). Unless you really believe you're improving nuoc cham, leave well enough alone.\n\nI love handmade noodles, but the scissorcut noodles with wild boar was just so-so. I finally just added sauce from the mapo tofu to give it some much needed flavor and heat. \n\nThe pork belly buns were tasty, but again, for the price, give me two pieces of meat in the bun so I'm not tasting mostly bread.\n\nThe most flavorful thing we ordered probably was that Mapo tofu. It seems to have some real Sichuan peppercorns in it, and it was quite spicy. Kind of skimpy on the tofu though, and I don't know why you couldn't give me a little more since tofu is not really super expensive.\n\nIn summation, this place would be a solid 3.5 stars if the price were about 30 to 50% less than what it is. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying a lot for and meal when the food is unique, flavorful and delicious, but unfortunately the food at MYChina isn't special enough to merit its special prices.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Maybe it was the fact that we came in for new year's eve dinner and perhaps it was an off day for the chefs..\n\nAnyhow we ordered some $68 set menu for two. Lets start with the appetizer 6 dumplings.. what I assume are xiao long bao. This was perhaps one of the better dishes. But the skin was a bit too thick and I really only liked the one stuffed with crab meat.. (definitely pales in comparison to Din Tai Fung's Michelin star but that isn't really fair to compare thr two)\n\n-PEKING DUCK.. this is one of the worst peking ducks I have ever had. I was expecting nice flat crispy pieces that glistened under the light but what we got was something quite different.. in fact the skin looked rough and dry. And oh man was the duck salty... I felt like I ate a tablespoon of salt everytime I took a piece of that god awful duck. \n\n-fried wonton bowl with what I assume is sweet and sour sauce... Meh.. it had chicken, beef, and shrimp. But again I am not sure why it was so dang salty!! \n \nThe forbidden rice was better than I thought it would be. But it doesn't really help balance the other two saltastic dishes. And at this point my expectations were pretty low.\n\nOverall:\nPros: decor (check out the 18 buddhas) and the snuff bottles near the restroom. Presentation of the dishes was ok..\n\nAnd the other things: \n1.chefs probably mistakened that salt shaker for the msg powder..\n2. hey guys (my china waiters) ever wonder why many asian restaurants provide smaller bowls for rice plates?  Cause it is mighty uncomfortable eating rice from a plate using chopsticks!\n3. Where is the toilet paper or seat covers? Hey maybe have someone check the restrooms every so often..\n\nYou can definitely find better food in Chinatown (funny thing here is that I am really no fan of Chinatown.. what can I say I guess I have stayed in Hong Kong for too long) Anyways if you want better service go to Hakkasan. Better food I would recommend R&G Lounge.", "author": "Norm L."}

Almost everything here is very fresh and tasty.  \n\nOnto their service and staff.. I have to say the service was far better when this place first opened.  It's deteriorated since about six months ago.  \n\nHOSTS are the worst.  Most are rude and act like they can't be bothered.  I asked the host on my recent visit as she was walking by our table if we could get our water bottle for the table refilled and instead of takiing the bottle off the table to refill it herself or having someone else take care of the request, she rolled her eyes and said someone would be by our table shortly and we could ask.  Never mind that the only reason why we ended up having to ask the host is because no one had walked by our table for a long while!  \n\nSERVERS are slow moving - not sure if it's a function of each of them having too many tables or if they're just lackluster slow.  It's not unusual if we have to wait 5-10 min after first sitting down to have a server come by.  THen another 10min for the server to come back for drink orders and questions on the menu.  I have it down now where i order drinks as soon as we sit down and the food when they first come to the table.  Then the server normally comes by unsolicited once (sometimes twice or thrice if the server is actually good) during meal service.\n\nINATTENTIVE AND SUBPAR SERVICE OVERALL.   \n\nIf they are trying to pull off the higher end Chinese restaurant image, they are headed in the wrong direction with the caliber of their staff.", "author": "ellelle l."}

When I learned that Martin Yan had this joint hooked up in the mall, I said it was to good to be true... When my noodle partner in crime suggested we make a date of it, I quickly agreed. We had a whole day of pampering and shopping and treating ourselves to yummy lunch planned.\n\nIt's quite spacious inside - I didn't feel like I was inside the mall at all. Ok, minus the giant table of tourists and baby strollers and shopping bags....maybe I could forget I was in the mall. Our server was sweet and attentive. I had a simple pinot grigio since I'm a lady who lunches (and drinks) and we started with the spring rolls and crispy tofu to share. Needless to say, we gobbled them up quickly. The spring rolls were veggie and I'm a sucker for a good sauce - this did not disappoint. The tofu was fried goodness - how can you go wrong?\n\nI settled for the hand pulled wild boar noodles since that I really wanted something to sink my teeth into. I love the consistency of the noodles and the boar was flavorful. We also shared the garlic pea shoots -- which are like crack -- they were so tasty. What do they put in there?! I forget the name of the cocktail my pal ordered, but she loved it. It tasted like a kicked up manhattan. Their drink list is definitely something I want to revisit - especially since they have a drink called Big Trouble in My China. If you know me at all, you know I have a weakness for the movie Big Trouble in Little China...but I digress. I have green eyes.\n\nI docked one start because it was so salty. I don't know if MSG was a culprit, but we seriously walked out of there puffed up, hands swollen, sweaty and with the thirst of someone who feels like they have the tongue of a cat. No joke. That's the only negative I took away from this place. Well, that and it's pretty pricey if you compare it to food court snackage - but this is a restaurant, not a dingy tray/table establishment. You won't be disappointed. There's much more I'd like to sample and the fun noodle pulling show (get your mind out of the gutter) was hilarious to watch.", "author": "Jessica P."}

The menu looked pretty great- though expensive- and I was looking forward to coming here with my husband.\n\nOur dinner was, overall, rather bland and sweet. The mint jasmine Collins was terrific- my favorite thing to the night. Of the pickle trio, only the daikon was good- the daikon were great, actually. The other two pickles were not great. The winter squash was far too uninteresting syrupy sweet and the last pickle had so little flavor I can't recall what it was. The tacos were tasty, but my husband said his had way too much raw onion and mine had very little/none- consistency issues? Dan dan noodles were okay but not made there, which was disappointing with all the other house made noodles- and it was simply not that flavorful. The saddest was that the sugar egg puffs were very disappointing. Real Chinese puffs are eggy, tender, soft inside and crispy crunchy outside, served freshly made and hot. These were just pre-made cream puffs, without the filling, rolled in sugar. As a cream puff, it's great! But I was expecting eggy tenderness, so that was disappointing. It was like asking for a frozen custard and getting a nice frozen yogurt instead. It sorta doesn't matter that it's a nice yogurt, when it's supposed to custard. And it was way too expensive for the quality and taste. \n\nI really like Martin Yan, so I wanted to love it here. Bummed that I don't.", "author": "M B."}

The food came out at weird times (one entree before the appetizer, before the rice which was at the end). But don't knock off stars yet. Because once you taste the excellently cooked meat, perfectly seasoned, and nicely complimented by the vegetables, you will enjoy your meal. My party shared the sweet and sour pork, lamb stir fry, chairman Mao chicken, and we started with the beef rolls. All was excellent. All dishes are recommended, and lead to a resounding answer to this reviewer's founding question: Yan can cook! He can cook very well.

Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with what Martin Yan had to offer there, so when my family decided to try his newer restaurant, I didn't have very high hopes for it.\n\nWe ordered the (1) Juicy Dumpling Trio, which consisted of three different soup-dumplings (wild boar, crab, and black truffle), the (2) Beef Hand-Pulled Noodle Soup, the (3) Chairman Mao's Chicken, the (4) Five-Spice Pork Ribs and the (5) Honey-Glazed Walnut Shrimp.\n\n(1) The Dumplings were tasty, and I like how they're served on individual soup-spoons. The spoons are also colored to indicate which of the dumplings are what (sadly, I can't remember which color pertained to which Dumpling at the moment...).\n\n(2) The beef in this soup is very tender and falls apart in your mouth. The broth is great, yet I felt as if it were missing a spice to round off the dish.\n\n(3) The chicken pieces are bite-sized and are crispy on the outside, but juicy on the inside. It comes with two sauces (a sweet AND a sour sauce, not just sweet and sour, if that makes sense).\n\n(4) The Ribs were by far my favorite entree from the bunch. They're definitely coated in Five-Spice, and the ribs are much like the chicken; crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside.\n\n(5) Normally, I love Honey-Walnut Shrimp, but they serve it with a Wasabi-type glaze, which threw me off the typical sweet Honey-Walnut Prawns I order from other restaurants. I commend them for the different approach, but I firmly believe in the saying, \"Don't mess with a good thing\".\n\nOverall, the dishes here were much tastier than the dishes I had at Yan Can, but they were definitely not worth the price. And although I loved their Five-Spice Ribs, I feel as if my parents could make the same ribs at home for half the cost, and in greater quantity. My final verdict: Good food, but DEFINITELY not worth the price.", "author": "George T."}

B) Don't eat at a Chinese restaurant with white waiters.  \n\nMy fears became more evident, as I sat down and thought to myself... did I just sit down in a more expensive version of PF Chang's?  My fears were further compounded when I noticed black truffles as an ingredient in soup dumplings.  Really?  I know we're trying to be \"creative\" here, but really?  \n\nWhile there was one reasonably bright spot, M.Y. China completely fulfilled my expectations.  The hot and sour soup was a little too aggressively sour (and expensive).  My boss put his bowl down and \"graciously\" offered me more.  The Sichuan green beans (gan bian si ji dou) were not \"gan bian\" at all.  My knife cut noodles, the ONE thing I was looking forward to, did not have the familiar QQ texture-- they were thin and overcooked, leading to soggy and soft noodles.  The noodles that did have the appropriate texture, were the scissor cut noodles... ironically noodles I've never come across in Chinese cuisine.  Those, I would consider coming back for, but the meal in its entirety was a disappointment\n\nWith a final bill that would be more appropriate at a nice French place, it all kind of felt like a sham... though, thankfully... it was not my choice, and the company paid.  Otherwise, I'd be super bummed.  I think this restaurant tries really hard to spruce up Chinese food, but in doing so, messes up on technique and flavors.

Nonetheless, we were seated at a bar just a few inches away from the kitchen. Staring through the glass wall it was apparent the kitchen enjoyed what they were doing. The staff was smiling or laughing and exhibited ease with the tasks at hand.\n\nWe started with Steamed BBQ pork Bao. Now, this is one of (and maybe the) our favorite dishes at Yank Sing. This was better than theirs. The dough was perfect. The center not as sweet but richer. Great start. We followed that with Wild Boar Juicy Dumplings which is their take on Shanghai dumplings, our other favorite dish at Yank Sing. This time it was closer. Call it a tie. Delicious.\n\nFrom Dim Sum we went to entrees. First was the Wild Board Scissor Cut Noodles (with  woodear mushrooms, scallions and Shaoxing wine). Awesome. The noodles were firm and thick and chewy. Terrific preparation. Finally we went traditional with Kung Pao Chicken (with Huang Fei chills, jalape\u00f1o and peanuts). The flavors were terrific, the chicken cooked just right and the Huang Fei chills, something I hadn't had before, were delicious.

The food is a blend of  Cantonese dishes cooked in Northern (spicy) style.  Many of the dishes were very good: Bang Bang Chicken wing, salt and pepper calamari, and noodle with wild boar meat.  The fried oyster, however, has too much batter and is not very fresh. The entertainment is centered on an open kitchen where the noodle chef puts on an acrobatic show/dance.

This was just an awful experience. We were seated quickly but it took 15 mins before a waiter came by to greet us.  I then said something to a staff person and her reply was \"let me check as soon as my shift starts\".  What a joke.  The food was average at best and expensive.  The waiter was a nice guy and offered to comp us for desert but then it took another 30 mins after they cleared our dinner plates to bring desert.  On top of that, another server brought us a second desert by mistake.  Also, when we initially placed our dinner order, our waiter said it would be faster if they brought  our food as soon as it was ready, however, we didn't expect them to just start dropping plates on our table in a haphazard manner.

Crunchy and yummy.\n\n- Pork taco: Nice and light with some added crunch from crispy noodles.\n I think this was my fave.\n\n- Wild boar lettuce cup: Very similar to the pork which isn't that surprising. Substitute \"taco\" with salad, and wild boar instead. Problem with the boar was that since you have a sweet (but nice) sauce, some of the gaminess of the boar got lost.\n\n- Charirman Maos chicken: Nice and crisp deep fried pieces of chicken with peppers and onions. A touch of nice spicy sauce on the veggies. Chicken could perhaps had more taste, but moist and well prepped. The sauces served on the side was nice. Regular \"red roll sauce\" and a darker sweet and spicy sauce.\n\nDidn't have Andy drinks, but the tea was nice (6 dollars though). No complaints on the service, and the place looks very nice. \n\nI just felt that the food could have been more ... spiced up ? Wow-ish ? Idunno...

I'm the first to admit that being Asian, I should've known better going to a place like this. I know better than anyone else I can get some amazing Dim Sum and noodle dishes for $20 on Clement Street and have left overs. Let me preface this review before I continue that I had the WORST food poisoning of my life after eating here. I know that this was it because I hadn't had breakfast and after eating ONE item here i was unable to eat anything all day. I had never felt so ill than after eating here. My cousin who I was also with that day was miserably ill and had to get fluids from being so sick. \n\nAside from the aftermath of it all, we walked in and it seemed interesting and seeing Chinese people in the kitchen was comforting. However when we pulled up a chair at the bar it took us forever to get service. Upon looking at the offensive menu we ordered the least Chinese thing on the menu, the mu shoo pork tacos. When they came to us not only were they completely oversalted, sauced and hard to eat, we found a hair in it. I also am highly suspicious that they use MSG. Regardless it was completely over salted but as someone who's allergic to MSG i experienced reactions to it.\n\nAfter we ordered we were scanning the menu only to find reasonably offensive images. \"We Wok hard for your food\"? Really? The \"We Got Cha\" was clever and the \"Our buns are steaming hot\" are lame and mildly inappropriate but really? And of all people who oversee these operations, Martin Yan thought that this was ok because he's Asian? I'm embarassed for Mr. Yan that he thinks it's funny or cute to perpetuate that stereotype. It's offensive and it's rude. I am never going back and highly reccomend no one goes either, if not for it being disgracefully presented food, for the fact that you will undoubtedly get sick.", "author": "Kristen R."}

The food was alright, but I got FOOD POISONING. Couple of hours after eating here, I was non stop vomiting all that I had ate for dinner. Food wise, strange everything came out lukewarm or cold. Breakdown of what we had:\n1) Five Spice Rib: The fried topping was good, but the rib itself had no flavor. Came out cold.\n2) Beef Noodle: Came out cold. The noodle, which are supposed to be a specialty, were a varying degree of thickness. The chef didn't do a good job of pulling the noodles. Flavor was ok, but on the sweet side.\n3) Forbidden Rice: It came out cold, but I actually liked the flavor of this dish.\n4) Potsticker: A disappointment. The filling had no flavor. While the skin was nice & thin, the top dough portion of the dumpling was raw.\n5) Hong Kong Noodle: The best dish of the night.. The noodle was crispy enough, and the toppings had enough flavor.\n6) Pork Truffle Juicy Dumpling: This was the worst designed dish ever. Why would anybody think that steaming Pork Dumpling like this is a good idea. When the dish came out the skin was already broken, therefore we had to pick up the spoon to eat the dumpling. Bad idea. This was the one dish that came out hot and my friend burned his fingers. Thus started our hilarious attempt to eat the dish. The spoon was too hot to take out with your bare hands, but too large & unwieldy to take out easily with the cloth napkins. The filling was tasty, but the skin was nasty, stuck to the bottom of the spoon. Worst part: The last one I ate, the filling was RAW.

Definitely not delectable food but more of a showman since he's done the most cooking shows (episode wise) I think.  So what would Martin Yan and the team at Koi Palace come up with.  For the longest time, my fiancee and I were thinking over priced Chinese food that caters only to the non Chinese crowd since it is in the mall but we were wrong.\n\nMY China upon walking in had the beautiful aroma of an authentic Chinese restaurant as if you were in Hong Kong.  Maybe it came from the open kitchen but there was a distinctive smell that gave me that feeling.  The restaurant has an old school Chinese feel with modern touches (open kitchen/music).\n\nOnto the food and drinks.  One of my buddies told me the cocktails were good and my fiancee got one and was it delicious.  We ordered beef noodle soup, wild boar noodles, sichaun string beans, baby bak choy, sweet and sour pork, bbq pork, pork belly sliders, and for dessert yam croquette and my china rice bowl.  My only complaint was the bbq pork had too much honey making it too sweet and there wasn't a need for the sesame.  Everything else was very good and authentic I would say and how do I know that?  I've been in the Chinese restaurant biz for over 25 years so I may know a little bit.  Anyway  I would highly recommend everything that we ordered.\n\nWhy am I giving it four stars and not five stars?  Well for starters the cocktail was very small and for $12, I felt it could have been a little bit more.  Second thing is the bbq pork had too much honey.  Both of these are minor details.  The food at the end of the day is pricier than other Chinese restaurants and the portions don't necessarily reflect that (not to mention a limited menu).  However you have to know you're paying for the ambiance, good service (which we got) and a little bit of entertainment in terms of the chef pulling noodles in the open kitchen.

I can't think of many worse places in actuality.\n\nThe HK Crispy noodle was ok, the bang bang chicken lived up to its sweet and spicy billing and the honey walnut shrimp was edible but so many other dishes were not up to par.\n\nThe won ton soup was amazingly bland. I think they forgot to put any seasoning in it and it looked a lot like egg drop soup with some wontons inside.\n\nThe salt and pepper calamari was rubbery and terrible.\n\nThe garlic pea shoots were reasonable but for the price, you hardly got any, almost 1-2 shoots per person which was a bit on the stingy side...$16 for veggies?!\n\nPineapple seafood fried rice, not sure what happened to the rice but it just tasted off to many of us.\n\nAnd last but not least, the worst was the peking roast duck. That was spectacularly terrible. Having had this delight many other places, I was hoping to enjoy this but not a chance.\n\nThe fat needs to be trimmed down almost completely to leave you with the crispy duck skin. This did not happen here, and who wants a pancake with fat and grease and chewy skin? That really was bad.\n\nTo add insult to injury, this place is not cheap and poor value in my opinion.\nI'd avoid, I doubt we could have ordered so many poor dishes by chance.", "author": "Nick L."}

Sorry to diss MY, but I kinda had a gut feeling he's not catering towards the Asian audience and more of a fusion style entrees. \n\nFirst course\nTea Pork Belly Sliders - not bad. Pork was nice and tender. However I didn't get the pickled items that go along with it. It over powered the pork flavor.\n\n2nd Course\nWild Board Juicy Dumplings -  4 pieces per order for $8.  Highway robbery.  Meat was good, juicy and had enough liquids in the dumplings. Skin is a bit thick, but I'd come back out of desperation for a semi decent dumpling. I still think Din Tai Fung makes the best dumplings. \n\n3rd Course\nBang Bang Chicken Wings - so utterly disappointed.  It was just spicy/salty and nothing else. \n\n4th Course \nDan Dan Noodles - Yuck - drowned in chilli oil.  Could not taste the noodles, pork, garlic as stated in the description.\n\nDessert\nMacau Egg Tarts - doesn't taste anything like the original Macau egg tarts I've ever tried.  Since the last 2 course were so sad, this finally brought me back.  I've had wayyyy better at a lesser cost. \n\nAs for the waitress, she never came back to check on us.  Since this isn't your usual Chinese restaurant, I expect better service.  She never came back to check on us during our meals.

I was happily surprised!\n\nHere's what we ordered:\nForbidden Rice - For such a healthy dish, it was fairly tasty. Probably wouldn't get this again though (not sure why so many other reviewers were infatuated with it).\n\n5 Spice Pork Ribs - Uhhhhhhmazing but a bit heavy. The meat just falls off the bone. The veggie shards it came with were well done too.\n\nHand Pulled Beef Noodle Soup - Beef and noodles were perfect. Soup was a bit too soy saucy for me though.\n\nWild Boar Soup Dumplings - Really good and juicy.\n\nPork & Black Truffle Soup Dumplings - My favorite dish of the night. So juicy and you can definitely taste the truffle.\n\nLotus Root Croquette - We were hesitant at ordering dessert at first, but we were glad we did. The texture of the croquette and the pairing of the almond ice cream were perfect.\n\nIn the end, we spent almost $30 a person and were stuffed.

We were seated promptly, the hostas telling us \"You missed the rush\" at probably 8-30 or 9-00.  Our waitress was wonderful & cute; very friendly & knowledgable about the menu & was very fun & talked a little here & there.  She did not check up on us excessively or forget about us.  One of big highlights was meeting Martin Yan, a life long favorite of mine since I was in middle school 25 years ago.  He was going around to every table talking to everyone & he, himself was having dinner with friends.  He3 is the bowl full of energy you see on tv & wonderful to be around; we got a few pics thanks to my mother & one of his employees.  So, onto the food.  The Shanghai juicy buns were wonderful with a thin wrapper & well seasoned ground pork filling; perfect with black vinigre.  The Chareman Mao's chicken is crispy with a lite badder & moist interior with a sweet & spicy sauce served on the side for you to customize how much sauce & how spicy you want it; it is a very good sweet & spicy sauce with the perfect balance of the formentioned tastes.  The wok siered beef is tender wityh onions, peppers, & arugula with a spicy tangy Szechwan peppercorn sauce.  The wild bore hand cut noodles we could not resist ordering again as the noodles are hand made & chewy but not overly so with tender bore & fresh bean sprouts in a lite sauce.  For dessert, the lychee panicota is different with a smooth custard with bits of lychee & other fruit with fresh mint.  Round it off with a Tsing Tao & you will not be disappointed.

The double-walled tea cups are really cool, as are the little individual dim sum platter thingies.\nWe had the Dim Sum sampler, honey walnut shrimp, soup dumplings, pork tacos, and pork belly sliders. Everything was great, I'd put the shrimp at the top but I should have gotten rice with it. Pork belly sliders were good but not my fav. I also had a peach Old Fashioned at the bar that made for a really great lunch cocktail!\nThe interior is pretty stunning; its a multi-area arrangement that totally makes you forget that you're in a mall.

Walking into the restaurant I went: 'Wow!' \n\nJust the d\u00e9cor and set up of the restaurant is a treat to begin the evening. I love the open concept of the kitchen stretching the entire back wall of the premises. The center section is where all the wok cooking action going on with a glass screens dividing the dining area. I stood there for a while just to watch the chef toss the food skillfully in the wok and creating 3 feet high of hot flames! Expanding to the both ends was the long open counter where the major food preparation, plating and quality check were going on. Very impressive! The food better be good, I thought. :D\n\nBetween my husband and I we ordered 3 appetizers to begin the meal. The Shanghai Xiao Long Bao (steam dumplings) was a good start to the evening. It was a great idea that the dumpling was served in individual spoon. As I picked up the dumpling from the top with the chopsticks, the pork fillings and the broth in the dumpling fell off from the bottom of the wrapper onto the spoon! \nIt works perfectly well for me as a low carber to enjoy the dumpling content from the spoon and discard the starch wrappers. The meat filling and the broth were both very tender and flavorful. Wonderful! I could eat a whole basket all by myself!\n\nThe next item was wonton soup. Personally I was not much into this wonton soup. For my low carb eating lifestyle, I prefer an aromatic clear broth rather than a starchy broth that comes with it, also if the wonton could be wrapped with a thinner wrapper. So we shifted our focus to enjoy the super tasty deep fried tofu. It was soft in the center, lightly crisp on the outside sprinkled with a spicy salty spice, topped with bits of red pepper and spring onion. It was delicious!\n\nWith this good treats, we continue to order our main entrees. The wok stirfry lamb with ginger and spring onion was very flavorful! And the steamed Sea Bass slices with Chinese wine, ginger and mushroom reminds me of the steamed fish my parents used to cook for me during the Singapore days.\n\nIt was such a wonderful dinner experience that on the last evening of my food tasting tour, I have to come back to this restaurant again to try the lobster. Needless to say it was good and the photo of the lobster I took impresses all my fans on Facebook.\n\nThis restaurant is certainly in my keeping list!", "author": "Kelly P."}

Food-wise, while a couple of the dishes we ordered were remarkable, the other items were just OK and need improvement in my opinion. I heard Martin Yan was not there for the opening due to filming in Asia, and I would wait to return until after he has had a chance to straighten and smooth things out.\n\nMy favorites: shui mai dumplings, the scissor-cut noodles, squid ink noodles (the seafood was cooked perfectly), and I could do shots of the tasty, garlicky dipping sauce that comes with the dim sum.\n\nOne of my main issues I had was that the dough-to-filling ratio of the beef and pork buns (bao) was too high. Thick dough and a joke of an amount of filling, and the filling was not intensely flavored enough so all I really tasted was dough. The dan dan noodles similarly contained only a tiny amount of pork; otherwise this chilled dish is refreshing and light (but the noodles are not hand-pulled). Lastly, the tea-smoked pork belly sliders were OK but thought the pickled daikon overpowered the delicate pork flavor. The smoking needs to be longer to infuse more flavor into it. (And again, the dough was quite thick and stuck to my teeth)\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive and the decor is very nice and upscale. Grab a seat at the counter to watch the culinary action live. As I mentioned before, I'd try it again in a couple months to see if anything has improved, but if it stays the same, some of the dishes are bland and not worth ordering.\n\nFood right now is 2.5 to 3, and will hopefully improve.", "author": "Patrick H."}

I do usually prefer smaller independent neighborhood gems rather than big sprawling celebrity chef owned restaurants in a huge mall with lots of tourists. Andj this place is definitely that. My partner jokingly compared it to PF Chang.. but that was before we ordered anything. \n\nFirst, this place is quite impressive in looks and design and decor, it's big, and I think perfectly situated on the 4th level of Westfield, right there by the dome. Service was very good and attentive. We ordered only dim sum and small plates because we wanted a light lunch. And of course what lunch is complete without cocktails? I had East Meets West yum. Partner had Monkey King.. beware it's strong! Started off with the Bang Bang chicken wings.. absolutely crunchy deliciousness. Then the wild boar juicy dumplings.. pretty good. Nice presentation 4 dumplings on soup spoons.. not sure it's practical but looks nice. The Baked BBQ chicken bao was probably our favorite, very very good. Salt and Pepper calamari was perfectly cooked so tender and scrumptous.We also ordered Poached Asian Pear salad.. it was good but could have done without. The dishes are supposed to be shared which is fun. I didn't think it was that expensive but then again we went for lunch.\n\nI really did not find anything wrong with this place.

Food, service and decor were all excellent, and I go there often as it is close to home. \nThe past 3 times have been increasingly disappointing. The latest was the worst! Our server was clearly annoyed to be working there, and showed minimum interest in making us happy. We ordered two main dishes, an appetizer and brown rice. The main dishes arrived first, followed 10 minutes later by the appetizer and finally the rice. The brown rice was undercooked and dry. We sent it back and ordered white rice. Our server couldn't have cared less. The white rice came and, yes, hard by clumps. We were surprised, but not wanting to complain too much, kept it. The seared beef! ... In the past, it has been tender, juicy and tasty. This time around, it was more like beef jerky! dry and salty, and we had to use knives to cut it and eat it! In all, our waitress managed one 'sorry about that', but looked more like 'what do you expect, you are only paying ~$20-$25 per dish at this joint'... when we were leaving, a friendly bus-boy tried to apologize... he said about our server '... she's a tough lady...'  ??? \nThe only positive are the noodles, which are always excellent.

The head chef in red was showing an employee how to make the noodles, and it's exactly as other reviewers have stated: twisting and twirling the noodle dough in the air several times and sometimes it look like they were beating the air with it. I wonder how their arms don't get tired from the repeated twirling! Unfortunately, we had already ordered our food so we didn't get to try the noodles, but there's always next time!\n\nSince we wanted a light dinner, the dishes we ordered were:\nChairman Mao's chicken (not spicy at all but still good)\nPork dumplings with black truffle (nice twist though I can't really taste the black truffle, though it's the first time I've had black truffle; decent amount of soup in it!)\nSteamed jasmine rice\nChrysanthemum tea\n...and dessert was M.Y. sundae rice bowl (love the crunchiness and the different ice cream combos with the caramel!)\n\nOverall, I liked how the food was light yet still filling.

Soup dumplings of pork and truffle, wild boar and shrimp and pork.  Served with a side of vinegar and ginger.  The shrimp and pork xiao long bao were the best.  The truffle ones had little to no truffle flavor.  The wild boar were just ok as well.  Overall, one type of soup dumpling with a variety of other dim sum would have been better.  \n\nCourse 2: 1/2 a peking duck divided among two dishes.  First to arrive was the Peking duck, skin, cucumber and scallion on a bao bun (The Korean mini sandwich style).  This was 4 decent flavorful filling white bread sandwiches.  The next dish 2nd of 2 duck to arrive that came along with Courses 3 & 4.  This was the so called remainder of the 1/2 of duck.  It was the stir fried meat in lettuce cups.  Once dowsed in hoisin sauce it was much better.  \n\nCourse 3: Seafood Treasury with shrimp, scallop, calamari, carrots, snow peas and mushrooms in a fried taro nest.  This was a fresh and clean tasting dish and not too heavy.  The shrimp were big and the scallops were big.  The calamari was a little rubbery.  \n\nCourse 4: Stir-fried Longevity Noodlewith Shredded BBQ Pork.  The best dish by far.  With mushrooms, peppers, onions and the delicious bbq pork.  \n\nDessert: Sugar Puff (Custard filled donut thing with sugar sprinkled on it) with vanilla cream sauce, raspberry sauce and chocolate sauce.  \n\nOver all, for the money, it was a great feast.  But the noodles were the most memorable dish.  Watching the noodles being hand pulled while seated at the counter was really cool.

Ignoring the usual challenges restaurants undergo when first opening, I found the place to be open, well-appointed and cranking out huge amounts of scrumptious food.  From the understated clean and modern Asian decor to the smiles on the waitstaff we were treated to some of the delicacies they are planning on serving once open.  \n\nThe pork belly appetizer was crispy but I felt needed some more flavor to the Beijing noodles, which are made fresh as you watch them making it right in front of you, which was a bit on the sweet side, but quite tasty.  We tried their dim sum collection which had 1 piece of some of my favorite dishes, i.e., har gao, shiu mai, sticky rice, egg tart, and a crispy egg roll served in the steamer basket straight out of the steamer.  I got the Honey-glazed lamb chops which while very tasty were in need of a hotter fire to burn off some of the fat and cook the chop just a bit more.  The coconut sorbet was sensational.  All in all, I'm sure with Mr. Yan's exacting standards and all the notes we supplied them with, this place is going to be a go-to place to eat well, very well.  I'd recommend trying them after the hectic shopping season and after they've worked out all the bugs.  \n\nWhat bugs you ask?  Well, while they offer free unlimited sparkling water and still water, the glasses are the same for both, so every 5 minutes someone is coming by to ask if it's still or sparkling.  With different glasses for each, this challenge could be rectified easily.  Also, the soy sauce containers pour soy sauce everywhere but where you want it.  As I said, these are very small details and can be easily fixed. It also seemed to be a very high ratio of staff to diners, wondering if they really need SO MANY people working there.  Lastly, another first, I believe, unisex bathrooms, great idea, forward thinking but alas, no signage and only 3 stalls for over 200 seats.  YIKES, that's going to be interesting.  With all the above though, I predict this is going to be a great success and one that is deserving of a great Bay Area Pioneer Celebrity Chef, like Mr. Yan.  Jao-jen.", "author": "Irv S."}

My only issue was that it came in a short glass, like for an old-fashioned, and the glass was nearly filled with the biggest honkin' ice cube I've ever seen.  I didn't even know ice cubes could be made that big.  The liquid rose up along the sides of the cube so it looked like a full glass, but really wasn't.  when I lifted the cube out of the glass, there was only about an inch of liquid.

They have individual WCs in there, but that was different for sure.\n\nI had heard some reviews about the seating...this was not an issue for us.  We were sat in a low traffic area with a couple of other people, but we weren't that close - but close enough that you could see what others were getting and ask questions on what they were being served as everything looked great.\n\nIt was fun to watch the \"show\" happening in the visible kitchen with the LONG noodles and even the dumpling guy was tossing them in from a long distance, so that can be fun - just stay out of the way of the busy waiters who were hauling food back and forth from that area.\n\nWe started with a couple of fancy cocktails - the M.Y. China Mai Tai was pretty tasty, and had a kick to it...be careful if you order too many of these as they were pretty powerful.\n\nDim Sum - Our waiter recommended the Pork & Crab juicy dumplings - these were really good interesting combination of flavors- - maybe a little pricey, but crab is not cheap.  \n\nWe split the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup - easily enough for two people, but warning - these noodles are really long...and you will look like an episode from I LOVE LUCY where you need scissors to cut the noodles to get into your bowl...they are LONG.  Would have liked a little more zing in the taste and prefer my soup piping hot - so maybe try another one of these next time.\n\nMain course:\nKung Pao Chicken - my favorite of the two we ordered - fresh ingredients and could have had just an order of this and would have been happy.\nWok Seared Beef Filet - in wine and peppercorns, okay - but really didn't send me to the moon - expected something different and it was kind of meh.\nRice - we tried the Forbidden Rice - has a lot of stuff in it - I'd be okay with Steamed rice next time...this was kind of like an Uncle Ben's wild rice - so, not sure I'd go for it again - worth a try, as it is different, but steamed for me next time.\n\nService - really friendly waiter - very helpful in recommendations.

Also, a great place for those who are intimidated by the English-unfriendly restaurants.", "author": "Laurence H."}

Spicy seafood dumplings (the ones that are in green spinach wraps) are also pretty bombalicious. Mushroom egg rolls and pea shoots were pretty tasty, but not anything to write home about. \n\nBest presentation goes to the pork sliders. Even though I'm not eating meat right now, those looked the most appetizing! \n\nLeast liked dish was the chairman Mao chicken. I didn't eat it, and my friends at our table didn't eat it either. Although it was crunchy, the color was weird, reminding me that it might have still been raw. Presentation looked like it was just thrown on a plate. We didn't even bother to take it home; that's how bad it was. One of the sauces was also too sweet for our liking. I kinda liked the savory sauce for it, though. Super tangy!\n\nI think the best thing about this place is where you sit. I really wanted to be facing the kitchen! The best seats in the house might be facing the noodle pulling bar. I totally want to sit there when I come back for the forbidden rice. I'm telling you. It's THAT amazing. \n\nI really wish I had the halibut. Also for next time. \n\nOne big question: can someone tell me why the pea shoots cost twice as much as the forbidden rice?", "author": "Denise H."}

As such, I was looking forward to M.Y. China, partly because of my familiarity with \"Yan Can Cook.\"  In the end, the overall experience was fine but didn't quite live up to my heightened expectations.\n\nFor starters, the pork & black truffle dumplings were on the larger size but 5 for $18 still seemed pricey.  Also, the dumpling skin seemed too thick for a soup dumpling and had to be eaten in several bites, which takes away from the overall experience of eating a soup dumpling.  Also, couldn't even tell there was truffle in the dish.\n\nAlso, going in I knew that handmade noodles were supposedly the highlight here.  Going out, I believe this this reputation was mostly overrated.  Neither the wild boar scissor cut nor the Beijing knife cut noodles impressed me much - both were thick and chewy and in my opinion, just ok.  But I will say the hand-pulled noodle soup with its savory broth and extremely tender beef was excellent.\n\nThe non-noodle dishes also equally hit or miss.  Both the lamb chops and the honey glazed BBQ pork were very good and left everyone was pleasantly surprised.  Our favorite dishes of the night.  But conversely, the mapo tofu was probably the worst I've ever had.  Completely bland and devoid of any flavor whatsoever.  No heat, no salt, no nothing.  The only dish that wasn't finished.\n\nDessert-wise, the sugar egg puffs (basically large profiteroles) with different sauces were nice to share but again just ok.\n\nOverall, the dishes were just too inconsistent for me - either great or really disappointing.", "author": "F.

The restaurant had a crowd outside and in the foyer, but the actual restaurant was 70% empty. I saw 2 available seats at the \"wok bar\" and asked the hostess if they were first come first serve. She said yes, but that it would be 5-10 minutes until we could sit there. I was confused, because there were table settings laid out. So we just sat at the regular bar which had several open seats. It was 10 minutes before we were given menus by the bartender. The other staff behind the bar was friendly and helpful, but the scattered bartender kept calling me \"darling\" and \"sweetie\". Stuff like that doesn't usually get to me, but he was relentless. \n\nWe got around to ordering 2 salads, a glass of sparkling wine, and I ordered a hot tea. The bartender pressed \"nothing to drink darling?\" so I repeated \"Just the hot tea\". I was 6 weeks pregnant at the time, and hadn't told anyone yet.\n\nThe food came out quickly. The green papaya salad was very salty, and had about 3 times too many dried shrimp on it, and about 4 prawns. I was still starving, so I ordered a fresh spring roll, which was good, but average. The bill for 2 salads, 2 beverages (one non alcoholic) and 1 appetizer was nearly $50. \n\nWhile we only had a small sampling of the menu, I was disappointed by the food, which I found to be average tasting and overpriced. The service was poor, especially the front end staff. Hopefully that has been worked out. The decor is beautiful, and it is a good location.

The minute I stopped checking on it, MY China had its grand opening without my knowledge (still bummed about that :-))\n\nAfter all the anticipation I would have planned a more formal first visit, but as it turned out my friend and I were starving after shopping, and just grabbed a quick afternoon snack there. \n\nWe only ordered three items: BBQ pork bun, spicy seafood dumpling, and eggplant. While the buns were fairly standard, the dumpling and eggplant were outstanding!  The ingredients were fresh, the dishes were creative, and very flavorful.  I will need to try more dishes, but I am tentatively going to give four stars. \n\nYes it's pricier than Chinatown, but the food is a lot less greasy, the place is clean and well decorated, and how many holes in the wall in Chinatown come with a full bar?\n\nUpdate January 12, 2013\n\nOk so I went back Friday night with my husband and cousin, and the place was hopping/busy.  I could tell the staff was spread thin and didn't mind the slightly longer delay between check-ins.  Even then they graciously accommodated the fact that were were 30 minutes early, and got the food out at a reasonable pace.\n\nThis time we tried the Hong Kong crispy noodles and squid ink seafood pasta, as well as the five-spice pork ribs; I skipped dessert but the Meyer's lemon tart and toasted rice sundae my hubby and cousin ordered looked pretty good.\n\nHong Kong- Crispy noodle pretty good, generous chunks of chicken and veggies.\nSquid Ink Seafood Pasta- Very creative and pretty, good combination of flavors.\nFive-Spice Pork Ribs- HAVE YOU GONE MAD??!!  Five-spice anything is best BRAISED, especially with pork ribs.  As it was the ribs were lightly fried (a la tempura style) with so little five-spice powder on it that I would not have guessed it was there.  I am far from a die-hard traditional person when it comes to cooking, but this new twist on an oldie is a fail.  However, I will say that the meat itself was juicy, fresh, and not too fatty.\n\nI'll stick with the four stars for now.

The host sat us quickly and the server Ryan came to our table to ask if we wanted anything to drink.  Later the manager Daniel came by to check in on us also.  After Ryan told us some information about the starters.  We tried the Shandong potato and onion pancakes with beef.  Also got to try the scallop sui mai.  Both were great starters.  He was very good about answering questions about the entrees.  My Dad had the Beef noodle soup and my Mom had the Venison chow fun.  I ordered the Guangdong Lobster.   I normally order Lobster E-Fu mein at a Cantonese restaurant so I had to compare it with that.  The lobster was good not over cooked which can make it rubbery.  But it was served over vermicelli which didn't do much for the dish.  It came with a side of the hand cut noodles on the side which were delicious as always.  I guess I was expecting more from the lobster since I'm use to eating it with ginger and onions stir fried.  We shared everything family style and we were stuffed.  At the end of meal they brought us this unique dessert.  tt had three cups of ice cream which they make themselves, I think, in a waffle cup.  And the chef hand spins sugar from a wok that was placed on top of the cups of ice cream. When they presented to us the told us it was like sugar noodle, I called it a Chinese cotton candy,  but it wasn't as fluffy so noodle may be more correct.

The pancake didn't have the chew that I look for and the rolls were small for the price you pay. The beef noodle soup was an even greater disappointment, with probably enough noodles for a couple bites each. The only saving grace for the meal was the seafood scissor noodles, which was generously portioned in terms of seafood. The noodles were nice and chewy, and the portion size was much better.

THe place is beautiful. the bar, the main dining room, the back dining room. the open kitchen. It looks awesome. However instead of getting the hardcore Koi Palace food experience, you're getting a dumbed down shy, pared down version of food for the mall folk. I guess you have to make money at the end of the day right? The peking style duck and the milk oolong tea were excellent. Truffle pork and wild boar dumplings were decent. The dan dan and squid ink snap noodles where underwhelming. We even sat right near the noddle makers which provided for a show. I just couldnt get over how underseasoned the food was.

That was just amazing.  If you even kind of like noodles, this is a must try.  The texture of the cuts as well as this being fresh noodles, was just superb.

We ordered Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles (vegetarian version) and Green Onion Pancakes and have very high hope that we'll be getting a killer made to order Green Onion Pancakes. The Scissors Cut Noodles is fantastic. When the waiter brought the Green Onion Pancakes, everything went south quickly. It is a frozen precooked stuff that you can get it from Chinatown for $1.49. It is clear that the chef doesn't respect his profession. I would feel that I'm insulting my customer if I serve instant noodle in my restaurant. If the chef doesn't know how to make a green onion pancake, go to Ark Chinese Restaurant in Alameda and learn. \n\nServices: Zero Stars\nThe services are terrible. I spilled the soy sauce on the floor. The waiter shows up, grabs my napkin, and mops the floor. Yes, with napkins that customers usually use them to wipe their mouth. Didn't come back with my cleaned napkin. Didn't come back to clean up the floor properly either. Just disappeared.\n\nIn addition to no common sense, they didn't even have basic manners. They don't even bother to present your dishes properly.

Really liked this place.\n\nIts strange that it is in a mall, but get over this. The room is nicely decorated and the wait staff is very professional and do a great job. They have open kitchen and you get a free show watching the cooks pull noodles, cut noodles and making all the dishes. Before any food comes I was a fan of this place.\n\nStill, a nice room and wait staff with bad food is still not a good place in my book, but everything we ordered was very good.\n\nFirst up was a small bowl of hot and sour soup. A pretty boring order, but we wanted this, and they did a nice job with the soup. They had more items in the soup than standard Chinese place giving more depth to the soup and more textural elements. Good job overall on a simple item.\n\nWe then got the wild boar with hand cut noodles. Loved this dish. The texture of the noodles was perfect. The vegetables and meat and the sauce highlighted the noodles, this was a pure winner dish, delicious.\n\nNext up was hand pulled noodles in beef noodle soup. This was an upscale take on the Beef Noodle Soup I get in Taipei. I liked the noodles, the broth was very tasty, the beef was cooked well and had proper amount of fat and they had bok chow with the soup. Not as good as the wild boar and cut noodles, but very good. \n\nWe then had schwain green beans which were cooked perfect, still crispy but not raw at all and in a spicy but not too spicy sauce. As with the other items good size for the price, tasty, a winner.\n\nI was full at this point, but we ordered dessert, when the food is so good I wanted to give them a chance with dessert. Ordered Hong Kong Egg puffs and got a big order of 5 puffs perfectly cooked served with raspberry coulis and hot chocolate and whipped cream. I never order dessert in Chinese place, but did here and really liked the dish.\n\nOverall the food was great and the service and ambiance really nice. I saw a number of dishes on other tables that I want to try. I expected a good place and with Martin Yan's name associated I set my standards high for this place, but have to say they beat all my expectations.

The deep fried spring rolls were greasy. The boar dumplings were OK. The vegetarian Longevity Noodle soup was very garlicky, so much so I couldn't taste much of anything else. Kung Pao chicken was boring and bland without any sauce at all. The Honey Glazed Shrimp were good. The Forbidden rice was really good. \n\nThe service was uneven.

Not his fault at all, but usually someone will jump in to help out in situations like this. \n\nEmpty dishes sat on our table for a long time, piling up as we finished each dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-01", "description": "I have to say, without a doubt, this is the best Chinese/Cantonese cuisine you can have anywhere in the Bay Area.\n\nYou only need one word: Flavours!  M.Y. China delivers on that front in spades.\n\nMy cousin flew in and after nearly a full week of fancy eating (e.g.: Napa Valley right after the 6.0 quake, even) decided that she wanted to try Chinese.  After all San Francisco is a Chinese city too.  \n\nAnyway I thought about where I could take her and honestly, within city limits, there was nothing that excited me.  But I thought to myself that maybe the novelty of that Martin Yan place could ease the painful fact that the Chinese food scene in SF is mostly embarrassingly bad restaurants.  In fact the Martin Yan brand was what prevented me from even trying it out when it first opened -- I thought it was all fancied up fake Chinese food (yeah, I've lived in the East Asia long enough to earn the snob points on food authenticity... so there!).  Heaven forgive me for being so wrong about staying away from M.Y. China for so long.\n\nM.Y. China is not only authentic, it is how real Cantonese food should taste like.  Here is why:\n\nWe started with the Crispy Organic Tofu: beautiful silken texture within a golden crust that \"grabs\" on to the proper amount of seasoning with subtle hints of the jalapeno.\n\nBeef Hand-Pulled Noodles Soup:  full of flavours. I know, another reviewer has found this too sweet but I think it's just by a touch.  The ribs were tender and moist, not jerky-like as in other establishments.  Most importantly the ribs were bursting with flavours.  The use of ribs here is a departure from the traditional cut used for this dish which is shanks -- beef shanks have a layer of silverskin that, if not removed, imparts a \"offally\" taste to the broth and many restaurants don't bother with removing it.  I understand, it's fiddly and labour intensive.  Which is why short ribs are a genius work around.  I, myself, use a chuck cut for this dish.\n\nVenison Chow Fun: I cannot say enough about this one.  The \"wok breath\" shone through like nothing else.  This is a masterful, take-no-prisoner, artistic and technical tour de force.  The Fun retained the proper \"pull\", a texture hard to describe, you just have to try it, with the requisite smokey flavour accompanied by the also smokey crunch of the mung bean sprouts -- the sprouts were \"kissed\" by the very hot wok just enough.  The venison, almost a side note since the chow fun part was so spectacular, was tender and cut into small cubes.  Like the practice of Kung Fu, the wok \"chi\"/breath can only be wielded by a true Shifu (not that red panda in the cartoon but a true master).\n\nGarlic Pea Shoots: the freshness comes through without being overpowered by the garlic (other restaurants doing this dish falls down on this dish in part for the still raw garlic flavour).  One can tell from the texture that it meets the \"shoots\" definition.  Shoots are \"young\", tender greens.  You don't necessarily get this level of tenderness at other restaurants serving this dish.  In addition, unlike many other restaurants that keep over-using the word \"fresh\"  (can't taste it... ) the Shifu/Chef actually let the freshness showcase itself in this dish.  You can actually taste that freshness.\n\nFinally we finished our meal with the Lychee Panna Cotta: again, the flavour of the Lychee shone through both in the panna cotta itself and the granita sprinkled on top.  I don't know how the dessert chef managed to concentrate so much Lychee-ness into the Panna Cotta, it's more than just using chunks of the fruit.  It tastes as if the dish was somehow spritzed with a pure perfume of the Lychee essence.\n\nDrinks: Tanqueray Martini extra dry, I emphasized \"super extra dry\" with a twist -- waitress thought I said Daiquiri Martini (what in the world is that?) is not bad but not chilled or dry enough but overall good enough.  A little stingy with the portion... I think.  I also had a glass of the  Gewrutzstraminer, Lafken 2011 (Chile) a little too sweet for my palate but a fine white to complement the meal anyway.\n\nNote to bartender: try using a perfume spritzer bottle to spritz the vermouth (best to use Noilly Prat) on the outside of the martini glass.  Extra dry in my opinion is for olfactory enjoyment, not quite for gustatory enjoyment.  Also the lemon peel oil need to be squeezed out and rubbed on the rim a bit more.\n\nService: very courteous, just slightly understaffed, I think?  We had to remind a server for some request (I forgot what) once.\n\nM.Y. China is a seriously good restaurant.  I haven't had such spectacular Chinese food (or other types of cuisine) in a long time.  While the dishes we ordered are considered street food in East Asia but they are street food done uncompromisingly properly.  Sometimes I think it's even difficult to find this level of care and technical flair in East Asia anymore.\n\nWell done Martin Yan!  Well done M.Y. China.", "author": "Dave M."}

Living and working in close proximity, the more cool stuff they put in Westfield SF the better.\n\nTons of stars for service, ambiance, decor, location. Where they lose me is cost and taste. Of course being in downtown/Union Square/mall the prices will not be low. But for the cost, I expect \"amazing, inventive, unique!\" Which just wasn't there.\n\nDon't get me wrong, everything tasted good but in San Francisco we are spoiled by the variety and abundance of great Asian/Dim Sum. \n\nFinal thought: it's definitely worth one visit.\n\nP.S. Hi Heather, thank you for your comments regarding my review. As I mentioned, the service, the ambiance etc. all got very good points from me, which is why I gave it 3 stars. I was talking up MY China before it opened as well as during the first few weeks to anyone who'd listen! \n\nWhen I was finally able to go myself, what was missing for me was the food factor. Everything was good. We had no complaints. But as I mentioned, Yank Sing probably has the \"cloth napkins\" dim sum tied up. And Chinatown has everything and anything in the 3-for-$1 category.\n\nBamboo on Polk has Honey Walnut Prawns for $12.95. MY China's dish was $22. Again, as I mentioned, because of the location, I understand things cost more. However, I expect that something extra or unique for the difference in price. The Rotunda at Neiman Marcus surely has the most expensive salads around, but it's exciting to go because they've made each meal a celebration with little baby cups of consomm\u00e9 and popovers with berry butter. It's their point of difference.\n\nWe tried a selection of dim sum, a noodle dish and the prawns. Came in under $100 (no drinks or dessert.) \n\nI talked up the place (ok, I begged for a month) and we're having a business lunch on Sunday 2/17, 2-4.

We asked if we could sit at a booth-like table, and the host said they were expecting some larger parties, and seated us at a smaller table.  Which would be totally fine, except they seated another party of 3 there about 10 minutes later.  Okay.\n\nThe waiter came out and I asked what was gluten free on the menu, and he said \"well this is an asian restaurant, so probably only salads\".  This could have been true, but after making sure the chicken on my salad would not contain soy sauce, my friend (who is not gluten intolerant) got the exact same chicken.  So I don't really know if the salads were actually the only gluten free items on the menu, or if our server just didn't want to go ask about gf items.\nThen my friend ordered kabocha soup, and the server \"corrected\" him, saying kabocha was pronounced like cabbage only KAbocha.  Since my friend lived in Japan for a couple of years, and I also speak Japanese, we tried to withhold our laughter until the waiter was out of earshot.\n\nMy salad was very tasty, but also very simple.  Chopped up lettuce, raisins, vinaigrette, and roasted chicken on top.\n\nThere's better food and service in the mall.", "author": "Liadan R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-28", "description": "The first thought is, really? A great (non-chain) restaurant in a mall? It's true. The energy of the place is incredible with the open faced kitchen where you can see the many chefs preparing everything by hand. Martin Yan was entertaining a group the night we were there, complete with camera crew so we got to see something special. The head chef, Tony, is one of the top chefs from China and he is incredibly warm as well as incredibly talented. We watched him make hand pulled noodles blindfolded. If you've ever seen this done, it's already a feat using your sight.\n\nDrinks:  Tasty and creative. There was a spicy drink called Fire in the Wok that I recommend if you want a little bite or something to fight off a cold. I enjoyed Under the Bronze Bell, a champagne drink mixed with ginger liquor and St. Germain Elderflower (and a touch of grenadine I think), named after the huge bell shipped from China that is now the centerpiece of the bar.\n\nI'm actually giving 4.5 stars. Half star goes away for our server not telling us we'd ordered too much food for our table of 8 even after we specifically asked her to let us know if we ordered too much. For starters, we could have done without duplicates of the dishes. It didn't help that there was some confusion among our group as to what people were ordering. But having said that, our server and the rest of the staff were outstanding.\n\nNow the upside to ordering all the food we had is that I can say there are SO many yummy things on the menu. \n\nDumplings: Wild boar, pork & crab, seafood, all were outstanding. I'm a huge fan of DTF and am waiting for the day one opens in the south bay (please let it be soon). The first two are served in traditional steam baskets and dramatically served in individual soup spoons (careful, they're hot!) and a slice of carrot. Downside is the carrot doesn't cover the whole surface area so the dumplings still tear open. Upside is the spoon catches all the delicous broth from the dumpling so you can enjoy it with the chewy perfection that is the skin.\n\nAvocado shrimp rolls: I could have skipped this one. Fresh ingredients but even with the peanut dipping sauce I was more interested in devouring other things.\n\nMu Shu tacos: Very generous helping for 2 tacos. Can easily feed 4 as an appetizer.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: One of our favorites, highly recommended.\n\nDan Dan Noodles: Cold, so maybe not everyone is a fan, but these thinner noodles have lots of flavor and a little spice.\n\nHK Crispy Noodles: You can't go wrong with crispy noodles. =) Very traditional and one of my childhood favorites, the noodles around the outside are crispy and then soft in the middle under the sauce and toppings.\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp: This is delicious pretty much anywhere you go but these are great. Lightly glazed, not drowning in sauce.\n\nBok Choy: Simple, basic, and a good side that goes with everything.\n\nMapo Tofu: Great if you like silken tofu. Not so great if you prefer the texture of firmer tofu.\n\nForbidden Rice: You want to order it just for the name. But it doesn't disappoint. This was probably the dish that surprised everyone with all the flavor.\n\nTwo of our table had their own soup noodle dishes, the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and the Vegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup. Both were a big hit and happily devoured.\n\nLastly, we received a very cool dessert made by Tony. It was a large plate of very fine noodles fried and covered in sugar, strawberry syrup, and berries. It may sound strange but it was so light and delicious. It was almost like Chinese cotton candy.\n\nIn general, because the menu can be a little confusing portion-wise, the noodle and wok dishes can easily feed a table of 4. Even some of the sides like the bok choy and mapo tofu can feed up to 6 unless you want a generous portion of those items and don't plan on sampling other things.\n\nThis is a little far for me to visit all the time but I will definitely be back!", "author": "Nicole T."}

I was a tad worried because I hadn't made reservations ahead of time, but we were seated within 30 minutes, just as the hostess said! We sat right in front of the kitchen's giant glass window, and head chef Tony (and others) smiled and waved several times at us during the meal. SO much fun!!\n\nWe ordered the \"Wealth\" menu, because it just seemed like such a better deal than the less expensive \"Prosperity\" one. I, for one, am over shiu mais and har gows after eating them at dimsum for 11 years in LA. And the Green pepper ribeye and XO chicken crispy noodle also seemed too common for such an occasion. Anyway, on to the food we did eat!\n\nJuicy Dumplings Sampler - WOW. Absolutely 5 stars for taste, presentation, the whole shebang. I love that each dumpling was served steamed in a color-coordinated spoon so there's no chance of breaking the skin when picking them up with chopsticks, which is often the case with shaolong baos, AND I exactly which one I'm eating!! I can't decide which is my favorite - crab or wild boar. The pork with black truffle was good but too heavy for me, but it was my friend's favorite.\n\nPeking duck in lettuce cups - The meat is supposed to be juicy stir-fried, not dried out and have the texture of crunchy jerky meat. It was like they had a pile that stayed heated (hence dried out) somewhere and just sprinkled them in for each order. The crispy noodle bed was nice, not greasy tasting, but a bit too much padding and made it very difficult to eat neatly. I have never spilled stuff out of a lettuce cup before this one!\n\nSeafood Treasury - Shrimps, scallops, etc. in a bird's nest. It looked great, as bird's nests usually do. The flavors were OK, just nothing too exciting. The server did bring us this awesome chili paste that went really well with the dish. Also, my friend previously hated scallops, but after trying this dish, she has discovered that she really likes them. We think she just had one that was really not fresh...\n\nStir-fried Longevity Noodle w/ Shredded BBQ Pork - By the name, I was expecting the hand-pulled super long noodles that MY China is famous for...or at the very least the \"yi mien\" that are served at Chinese birthday dinner banquets. Imagine my shock when a bowl of UDON came out!! I almost had to ask if we got the right food. Granted, the dish was actually good and really great with the chili. But...what the hell? And the Udon noodles weren't even that long!!!\n\n**Update: Heather responded saying the noodles were indeed hand-pulled (see her reply below), but the server who brought out the dish was the one who called it \"Stir-fry pork udon\". \n\nPeking duck skin in sliders - I wonder if they messed up the order of the food (as listed on the menu it's the 2nd item), or if this was actually intended to come out last. I'm not sure whether I liked the duck already in steamed buns with cucumber and green onions, but they sure looked pretty! The skin wasn't crispy enough, and I think being served in buns was the main reason. It tasted good, no shortage of duck meat. But my friend is sensitive to fattiness, and had to spit out entire chunks of fat while eating. She still really liked them though.\n\nSugar Puff w/ Sauces - The puffs are huge, airy, and full of awesome. We even got an extra thrown in for free! The sauces are raspberry, chocolate fudge, and creme fraiche. Not a huge fan of the first 2, since raspberry anything is usually sour (probably would've loved the strawberry one if they had it) and chocolate too sweet/heavy. But a tiny bit of either/both and a chunk of creme on the puff? MMM!!!\n\nOverall service was great. My friend even said it was the BEST service she ever had at a restaurant, and actually tipped a non-embarrassing amount!! (She's a very stingy tipper.........Yeah, I don't eat with her very often. Sigh.) \n\nThe highlight of the evening was of course meeting Martin Yan, who was extremely friendly and came by our table at least 3 times. When we were getting the check, near closing time, Martin strode into the kitchen. He and Tony put on a giant show waving woks around, making huge fires, and just generally being awesome. We were SO happy we stayed and caught that!!! \n\nAs it turned out, my friend also watched Yan Can Cook shows years ago with her daughter...like I did with my mother while living in Hong Kong! I hadn't told her M.Y. China was owned by Martin, so it was pretty much the best surprise ever (just wish it was her birthday LOL)!! She's telling everyone about the experience, and has her heart set on coming back next time Martin is in the house. I should definitely make reservations this time though ;)", "author": "Genevieve W."}

Rice and beans were our two side dishes.  They were good, but nothing I'd go out of my way to eat again. Chose the Sugar Egg Puffs and Lemon Egg Tart for dessert.  Both were very good.\n\nI would absolutely go back to explore more of the menu, but by no means was the experience anything I was talking about the next day.  My only real gripe was with the service.  Our entrees and sides were all served separately.  The rice fist, about 5 minutes later, the first entree, then another 5 minutes for the beans, and then about 5 minutes later the beef.  This made the dinner very clunky and nothing was the same temperature.  I don't know if this is normal or the server/kitchen screwed up.  All of us were very annoyed with our server.  The place is noisy and he mumbled and was very soft spoken.  It finally got to the point we were so tired of asking him to repeat himself that we just stopped asking anything.", "author": "Jeff M."}

We had:\n\n  Beijing  Knife Cut  Noodles\n  Wok Tossed Shrimp With Ginko Nuts\n  Salt & Pepper Calamari\n  Stir Fried Green Beans\n\nThe food was good and beautifully prepared. The noodles were really good, with a tasty non-bland but non-overpowering hoisin sauce-based broth. The other dishes are ones that are available in most bay-area Chinese restaurants, but the preparation at M.Y. China seems to be better. The fried Calamari was perfectly not greasy and the beans were spicy but not so spicy that you couldn't taste the beans. The Ginko nuts and berries in the shrimp made a great combination.\n\nSo the food was good. Other aspects:\n\nIt was noisy and the tables were really close. It was hard to talk and everyone at the nearby tables were talking really loud to overcome the din. The *very* loud Christmas music from the mall just made the problem worse.\n\nThe portions were not large, but the prices were reasonable. We got out for about $50 plus tip and tax.\n\nRemember, it's a Chinese restaurant in a shopping mall. It might in fact be the best Chinese restaurant in a mall anywhere but there's a limit on how good a mall restaurant can be. It's great food, but not elegant dining.

Let's just say that I usually don't like to go to these bougey Chinese places because I can definitely get great Chinese food for cheaper and without all the extra bells and whistles. But my friend said it was good so I said why not I'm always open to new places. Ordered the Siu Long Bao, har gau, Dan Dan mien and our waitress, who was super friendly, recommended the Mu Shu  pork tacos.\n\nThe things that we picked out were actually really good and on point on the texture and flavors. The har gau was actually pretty exceptional especially because it is such a dim sum staple and you don't expect it to be any better, but it was. The wrap wasn't too thick or rough and the shrimp mixture had the right texture and flavors. The Siu Long Baos were really good. That is something that I love to order when I go to get dim sum. This place can compare to a place I went to in H.K. The Dan Dan Mien was decent, lacking in the peanuty flavor than I love mix with the kick of the spiciness. The Mu Shu tacos did not do it for me, waitress was sweet to recommended but it felt too artificial for me...the sauce was too strong tasted like a lot of msg (?). But my friend liked it, so maybe I got the stronger flavored tasting one. Overall, it was a great experience and the food was good. I mean this place is by Martin Yan and he can cook. :)\n\nWith such an extensive menu, I would be willing to give this place a try if I was back at the mall to shop again and with more time.

We ordered:\n1) Beijing knife cut noodles- my 5yo sums it up well...\"they are too plain\". When a dish consists of noodles and tofu, I want to be able to SEE the tofu, as in bigger chunks. These were smaller than the tiny bits such as in miso soup. The vinegarette needs more punch with such thick noodles. \n2) Braised short rib soup- OK. \n3) Sweet sour pork- loved the sauce, especially since it had fresh pineapple....bonus! Loved the crispiness of the pork chunks. \n4) wok fried green beans- great.\n5) jasmine rice- was the smallest per person portion we have ever been served at a restaurant which serves rice! \n\nHere's the clincher- I couldn't be more annoyed with our server. It was like as soon as he walked up to the table it was a totally scripted acting gig of marketing the restaurant.

Wrappers were thick and the bottom stuck to the spoon. Usually the use of a spoon is so that you don't lose the soup, but the spoons were way too big to fit in ones mouth. The flavor of the wild boar was just so so. It's terrible that they served with the sweet red vinegar instead of the traditional fragrant black vinegar. For an Asian fine dinning establishment, Hakkasan clearly has the much superior soup dumplings and with the service to match.\n\nBeef noodle soup - extremely soggy spongy noodles, beef consists of mostly tendon and the broth was not tasty and sweet.\n\nWhole wheat potstickers - Greasy and not crispy on the bottom at all.\n\nShrimp dumplings and Shiu Mai were average.\n\nDinner:\nPork and Truffle juice dumplings - Could not detect ANY truffle essences at all. $18 an order.\n\nWild boar lettuce cups - Extremely greasy, loaded with deep fried noodles.

This time we were seated in the back of the restaurant, which is just as lovely, though a bit more quiet than the front.  Our waiter was extremely attentive and very knowledgeable.  \n\nThis time we started with the spicy seafood dumpling.  This was by far the best dish of the meal, and we could not stop talking about it when we left.  The wrapper is green (on the menu it is described as a spinach wrapper) and inside are juicy bits of shrimp and scallop.  But the most innovative part was the tasty chili sauce, which was flavorful and caused your tongue to numb in the best way possible.  \n\nWe also had the knife cut noodles which tasted great, but were slightly overcooked.  I'm sure this is just the kitchen working out kinks, since they were slammed on a Saturday afternoon.  The hand pulled noodles in the beef soup were tasty, as were the General Mao chicken bites.  We also had the wok shrimp, and I really appreciated that the shrimp were not overcooked.  The only disappointing thing we ordered was the pork belly sliders.  And this may just be because the versions at Momofuku (in NY), Heaven's Dog, and the Chairman truck are so spectacular.  These were not quite as flavorful and seemed to be missing the luxurious mouth-feel that you would expect from pork belly.  \n\nUltimately M.Y. China is a beautiful restaurant, and the waitstaff was great on this last visit.  It's a solid option during a day of shopping, and its easy to forget that you are in a mall.

Yeah, not in the restaurants control but you should've at least fore warned us.  I'm sure the building gave you a heads up on it.  I had a ladies group luncheon with 10 ladies.  All of us were in disbelief.  That deserves a 1.  Now to the meat.  The food was good but not great.  Our bill was around $330.  Not too bad, but we had some pretty basic dishes.  The har gow was made with large shrimps, the forbidden rice was great, the shaken beef with arugula was sub par, and wild boar scissor cut noodles were no more than par.  Overall food was more like a 3.5.  Is it worth going?  Absolutely, It's no more expensive than other restaurants in the Westfield Shopping Center and it's better than PF Change Chinese.  Go for it.  If you want authentic Chinese, go to R & G Lounge.  Until next time, ciao!", "author": "Dee Dee L."}

We had a reservation but were early and had a drink at the bar.  The drinks were very good, reasonably priced and the bartenders were funny and engaging.\n\nWe chose a table outside in the rotunda and despite having been warned by friends that it could be noisy out there, we found that was not the case.  Noise level was not a problem.  We started with Pork Juicy Dumplings and Crispy Organic Tofu, both of which were very good, with the tofu being excellent.  We had all the dishes family-style and went on to have Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles (very good), Wok Seared Seafood (excellent), Peking Roast Duck (outstanding!) and sides of steamed rice and Sichuan Green Beans.  They were all delicious, fresh and hot.  The Wok Seared Seafood was especially good, with a subtle and interesting flavor, not spicy, not bland.  The Peking Roast Duck was really excellent, the skin being perfectly crisped and the duck meat being perfectly moist, juicy and flavorful.  We did sample two deserts, the Sugar Egg Puffs and the house-made Candied Ginger Ice Cream.  I preferred the ice cream which was full-flavored and refreshing.\n\nThe wine list is eclectic and interesting.\n\nService was provided by Cedric, a true professional waiter.  This being our first visit, he took us through the rather extensive menu and made some suggestions which turned out to be winners.  Service was prompt, efficient and friendly.  Cedric seemed to really take an interest in his work and was not merely going through the motions.  Thank you Cedric!  You added to our enjoyment of the meal.\n\nWe lingered a bit at the table and did not feel rushed at any time.  M. Y. China is a bit more expensive than the average Chinese restaurant, but it is very much worth it.", "author": "John G."}

I think the current 3.5 star average is exactly what I would've given it.\n\nOrdered\nGrandma's Gai Lan (w/ Chinese Sausage)\nPoached Asian Pear Salad\nLobster w/ Scissor Cut Noodles (substituting chow fun for my gluten free date)\nLychee Panna Cotta\n\nWhat's there to say about this?  Well, the food quality/taste of what we ordered was damn good.  Like within range of Chinatown restaurant quality.  More authentic than P.F. Chang's   (since that is technically fusion).  Better quality than Panda Express (ok, that's a low bar to clear).  It was also as expensive as both of those places combined, but that was to be expected.  The serving sizes were plenty generous (we had leftovers of everything except the dessert).  I would've liked more sausage in the Gai Lan, but that's minor (and I really like Chinese Sausage).  The Asian pears - delicious (I didn't have much of the salad).   The lobster, also scrumptious, and cooked/cut in a way that much of the lobster was easy to extract from its carapace.  Finally, the Lychee panna cotta was inspiring, in that I want to make it for myself now (or a variation that has lychee bits in almond jello).  I was tempted to order the Honey Walnut Prawns, but $22 for it seemed excessive.\n\n\n\nSo ..\nFood quality/taste - 4.5/5\nFood portions - 4/5\nPrice - 3/5 (ouch!  Thankfully it's not too often I run up a $100+ bill between two people, especially for Chinese food)\nAmbiance 4/5 - We were seated at the bar and the bartender was extremely friendly.\n\nIf it was at the same pricing as P.F. Chang's, the comparison between the two would be no contest.  As is, the pricing is just enough to push this into a category where I'd eat here once or twice a year.  However, the food is pretty close to legit, as I would expect from a Martin Yan inspired restaurant.  If you're at Westfield and looking for something fancy/posh, this would hit the spot.

Calamari was wayyyyyyyyy too chewy, seasoning you think would taste like salt and pepper right? WRONG! The seasoning had a kick, but a bland taste of nothing. Literally tasted the chili, fried batter, and the squid, but no salt or pepper at all! This was a huge disappointment and needs a major revamp! \n\nWhole Wheat Potstickers 5 for $7\n -These were just weird. I like the idea of a healthier alternative pot-sticker but damn, these SUCK!

A bit too unconventional for me as I was craving traditional Chinese. However I was pleased with the crispy noodle chicken dish.\n\nMy main complaint was the wait time and procedures. We were told 20 minutes but it ended up being one hour. What made it worse was that they have a terrible system in which they make you stand in the doorway, physically waiting in line, as there is no \"wait list\". My family of 4 had to stand there mercilessly watching people eat for way longer than we expected. My kids were practically in tears.

If we'd had room I would have ordered the scissor cut noodles. \n\nWe also shared a bottle of prosecco and skipped dessert or else someone would have had to rollllllllllllll me out of there.

Funny, the waiter gave me a spoon to eat this with.\n\nWhole wheat potstickers (5) - beautiful and even scalloped edges. Tastes like a regular potsticker but the skin has more texture. Accompanied by a spicy soy sauce.\n\nShandong beef rolls (2 and cut into halves)- quite tasty and not dry because of an ample amount of hoisin sauce. The green onion pancake has a pleasing texture that is easy to bite into.\n\nWild boar scissor cut noodles - Nice flavors and textures and you can see the skill in the making of the noodles. \n\nDan dan noodles - this was overly spicy for some reason. May be inconsistent because my friend said it was rather bland the last time she ordered it.  I like that there weren't too many peanuts and no peanut sauce flavor...personal preference. Still had a good flavor profile despite the spiciness.\n\nPork and black truffle juicy dumplings (5)- (otherwise known as xiao long bao XLB) rather disappointing. Sharp presentation with each dumpling resting in a large soup spoon.  Genius because you could just eat it off the spoon, IF it weren't for the fact that the spoon is scalding hot.  There is also a thin slice of carrot underneath the dumpling to separate it from the spoon, but that didn't seem to prevent the skin from sticking to the spoon and tearing upon consumption. In terms of taste, it was just average...  definitely had better xlb with less extravagant ingredients.\n\nAt my table of 4, I had the honor of eating the 5th and last dumpling. After the first bite, I noticed a little something sticking out of the meat. Out of curiosity, I pulled it...and pulled it... and pulled it... and it turns out it was a hair.  Major sad face because why is hair usually found in food AFTER most of it is consumed? Well at least it has been in my experience.  We called a manager over and showed him.  His face immediately turned grim and sullen, he took away the remainder of the dish and left promptly.  We saw him talking to one of the kitchen workers; one of the perks of an open kitchen, we customers can see most of what's going on. He came back to our table and told us he ordered another 3 pork and black truffle dumplings on the house for us.  Very odd arrangement, but we really weren't expecting anything since we ate the majority of the dish already. We didn't really want the extra 3 dumplings either since we were getting full already.  Just glad that he took action and wasn't aloof about it.\n\nTowards the end of our meal, a chef came out dancing around the dining area to perform noodle pulling to the Gangnam Style song.

The pork ribs were a delightful surprise featuring a light, crisp, well seasoned outer crust and very tender meat.  The fried rice was a bit of a disappointment in the context of the other two dishes - okay but nothing special and maybe lacking a little in seasoning.  Next time we would probably just go with the steamed jasmine rice.\n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed the Almond Rice(?) ice cream and the Sugar Egg Puffs.  Both were excellent.

I'm glad I did but I will not order it again if I ever came back.  \n\nThey didn't have scissors to cut up the dim sum dishes when there was an odd amount for our group of 5.

It's always dangerous doing \"upscale\" Chinese food in a town full of people who know what authentic Chinese food tastes like, but all in all, M.Y. China did a good job.  The decor is very nice and classy, especially in contrast to the bleak 70s-era decor of most Chinese restaurants.  The menu is thankfully short with clear English explanations--no \"secret menu\" written in cryptic Chinese and tacked to the walls.  The food was relatively authentic and all of it was pretty good.  My favorite was the braised beef soup with hand-pulled noodles, which was possibly the best version of this dish I've ever had.  The Peking Duck was also good, though I've had much better.  And the cocktail menu is quite nice.  (Their take on a Pimm's Cup is particularly yummy.)\n\nThe service could be improved, but was not so bad that it hurt the meal.  My waiter was a little slow to bring us items we requested.  I had to ask for white rice three times, and our water carafes were empty after 10 minutes and were never refilled.  We also never got our pea shoots order (though I didn't even notice until long after we had left, so I couldn't complain.)  Our waiter wasn't rude, though he was far from charming, and I saw flashes of annoyance in his face whenever I asked for something.  I try very hard to be a courteous diner, so this definitely rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nThe prices are a good 30-50% higher than a comparable Chinese restaurant in the Richmond or Chinatown, so I would never bring my grandparents here (I can already hear my grandma \"aiya\"ing about the $15 bowl of noodles).  Foodies seeking the most authentic steamed fish or xiaolongbao should also probably look elsewhere.  But minor service issues aside, I'd recommend MY China for a clean, upscale, classy environment that's accessible to \"Westerners\", (mostly) authentic Chinese food, and a solid cocktail.", "author": "Matt Y."}

The fact that it is in and open to the mall tells you something about what your meal will be like.  Lots of foot traffic, noise and distractions.  And during the meal you may see Martin Yan walking through the restaurant showing off one of his noodle pullers.  The noodles are twirled around like a lariat and it is fun to see.  Too bad it is hard to hear Mr. Yan describe the spectacle: he needs a microphone.  \n\nTo start, they need to do some work at the reception desk, as there is confusion, clusters of people, and little guidance.  Whatever, you will get to your table. \n\nI started with wild boar scissor cut noodles.  This was an ample plating of tasty, al dente noodles interspersed with meat.  Unfortunately, the spicing in the dish masked the taste of the meat.  Nevertheless, this was a good beginning to my meal.\n\nNext, a half order of Peking duck.  The duck skin was crisp and the meat of the duck was served on the side.  The skin was not quite so crisp as I have had elsewhere and the meat was haphazardly cut with a some stray fat accompanying the duck.  Nevertheless, this was also pretty well done.\n\nA glass of barbera was well-poured, properly priced, and nice save for a bit of cork in the glass.  \n\nService was a bit distracted (they are obviously still learning the ropes) but got the food to the table while it was hot.", "author": "David D."}

We were lucky enough to be able to grab an early reservation, but arrived before the restaurant opened, and therefore had to linger a while.  Each member of the staff was so busy bustling around getting the place ready for service, yet they all had time for a warm smile and/or a friendly greeting.  \n\nOnce seated, we were promptly greeted by our server and offered drinks, which we happily ordered.  My husband ordered an East Meets West...YUM.  I ordered an Under the Bronze Bell...a delightful prosecco cocktail.  Both were brought to the table quickly, along with the sodas my kids ordered.  \n\nWhile we sipped our cocktails and pondered the menu, we were entertained by the restaurants expert noodle pullers (not sure the industry term!) who pulled and snipped long noodles into huge pots of bubbling water in the action packed open kitchen.  Some guys were throwing noodles from a couple of feet away into the pots...it was like acrobatic noodle making.  Very fun to watch.\n\nWhen it was time to order food, our server was very helpful, as we wanted to order every single thing on the menu.  She was able to narrow things down for us...\n\nWe ordered:\n\nTea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders- DELICIOUS.  I would totally order these again.\n\nShandong Beef Rolls- We watched a little video of them being made before we went to the restaurant.  They did NOT disappoint!\n\nMu Shu Pork Tacos- Another delightful dish, highly recommended.\n\nBeef Hand Pulled Noodles\nBraised Beef Short Ribs in a Claypot- This is my only complaint of the entire evening, and it's a petty one....The above noodle dish and claypot dish were both ordered, and they were both delicious, but they are almost exactly the same flavor...the only difference really is that one is served over noodles.  Now I want to make it perfectly clear that both dishes were absolutely worth ordering, but there were so many other yummy looking things on the menu, I only wished we had chosen one of the beef dishes and then got something else.  I feel that the server should have given us a little heads up on the similarities thereby giving us the option to choose something else...\n\nM.Y. Sweet and Sour Pork:  Um....Best I've ever had in my entire San Francisco raised life...\n\nGarlic Pea Shoots- Very tasty but expensive.  Not sure if they are a really rare type of pea shoot or what, but a plate of them was $16 versus stir fried green beans (which we didn't try) at $8.  I'm guessing the price must be justifiable, I just forgot to ask what was special about them.  Next time though, I'd probably go for the green beans.\n\nMapo Organic Tofu- We ordered it extra spicy and it was delicious.  \n\nOverall, our experience was fantastic.

We also got wok seared beef on a bed of baby arugula. The meat was very tender but it super bland. The steamed rice that should come free with the dishes was $2 per tiny container was good. The dessert that we got was the M.Y. China sundae (i think that's what it's called). It came with three table spoon sized ice cream, some toasted rice crumbled under the ice cream and some caramel sauce that's very sweet & feels like gritty sand.The complimentary bottled water came in a fancy bottle but it taste like tap water.\n\nIf you want to experience the real & authentic Chinese food, I suggest that you walk up a few blocks to China Town. It may cost you the same but at least you can say you had some good Chinese food. \n\nOne thing I enjoyed was the noodle making show. I mean, it was entertaining although I've seen the stunt at other places before. They made some type of dessert out of the noodle after which we got along with the dessert that we ordered.

I had to do a lot to find this place I accurately was on Instagram in the explorer section were I saw this picture a girl posted of this AMAZING looking crab . I clicked did some stalking in the comments and she wasn't giving up the name of the restaurant to her followers ... So I hesitated and finally added her , then screen shot the picture and DM her she replied quickly with idk the name but it's the 1st restaurant it's next to the nordstrom cosmetics exit . So I hop in a cab from my hotel and go on the search ! ( I remember thinking omg what if this girl is just sending me on a wild goose chase haha) sure enough there it was ! I'm so pleased with this place & our waitress !!", "author": "Sara L."}

We had  very good service. Not nearly as arrogant as Roy's staff has become. Ambience is contemporary and the tables well spaced. It's in the Westfield Mall, but easy access if you take Muni or BART.

I should have known from the beginning when I asked the waiter for an ice water and he brought me water with NO ice. In a nut shell, this is bland but somehow salty,  \"fancy\" Chinese food that is extremely overpriced. I can't believe I just paid $28 for 5 chunks of bland chicken, over-cooked green beans, and steamed rice. What restaurant charges $2 for a tablespoon of steamed rice? Did I mention this was lunch time? I feel ripped off and will never go back. I hate to say this but Panda Express is better and I would have never thought frozen food would be better than a world class chef.

Ordered three dishes and two drinks between two people, and it was only about ~35 each, so pretty reasonable. We ordered the dumpling sampler, Sichuan green beans, and crispy Hong Kong noodles. The green beans were excellent and very tasty, my only suggestion would be to add some spice to them. The Hong Kong noodles were also good, and the chicken that comes on them was amazing.\n\nThey have the kitchen open and you can see chefs spinning the noodles, which is fun and makes me want to go back to try different noodles there. The restaurant is open to the mall dome, which makes it feel oddly like Vegas or something, but is also nice because it feels spacious and like eating on a climate controlled patio.\n\nOverall recommend it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-10-01", "description": "I don't even know where to begin.\n\nCame in for dinner on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend and another couple.\n\nLet's just say if this place even deserves a star, it's for the decor and ambiance. It really is a pleasant looking restaurant and the aesthetics of the open-ish kitchen are also nice as you walk in. The hostess led us to a less-than-desirable table by the hallway to the bathroom (yes, we did have reservations for 4 through OpenTable), and upon asking to be re-seated at a number of other open tables were told they were all also \"reserved\". Not a big deal but more on this later (you can probably guess what happened). \n\nThe service to start was prompt, and the waitress seemed personable and took our orders. We elected to go with 2 Hot & Sour Soups, 2 Westlake Wonton Soups, the Beijing Beef Cut Noodles, Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, Pork Sliders, Chairman Mao's Chicken, and Wok Seared Beef Filet. The first red flag should have been when our waitress took our order mentally, and then returned a minute later to double-check which entree our friends had ordered (there's a reason why servers write it down)\n\nThe soups came out quickly, litteraly about 2 minutes after the waitress \"confirmed\" our order- I got the Hot & Sour, which I am a huge fan of at 99% of Chinese restaurants. Not this one. At first glance I would tell something was wrong... the soup wasn't of its traditional brown hue but concentrated very heavily with a vibrant red. One taste of the soup told me enough- it tasted like a thick paste mixed with Sriracha. Literally inedible and probably the worst thing I've tasted in a long, long time. I alerted our waitress to send the soup back (either this is the worst recipe on the planet or the chef of the night dumped way too much hot sauce into the soup) and request a bowl of the Westlake instead. She snatched the bowl off the table like I had personally offended her, and stormed off to the kitchen. She then disappeared for no-less than 15 minutes and forced us to ask two other different servers where our soup was (\"Coming right out\"). The replacement bowl of the Wonton soup made it out, followed 30 seconds later by our noodles and entrees. Great. \n\nThe soup itself- bland. Tasted like water, egg whites, and chives with two wontons. Had to dump a whole ramekin of Soy Sauce into the soup to get through it. Not the worst I've had, not even comparable to the Hot-and-Sour atrocity, but yet bland none the less.\n\nAs my party started to eat the entrees as I was still finishing my soup, I got the sense they were underwhelmed with the food. Wow, was that an understatement.\n\nThe Wok Seared Filet ($18) was one of the worst beef dishes I've ever tasted in my life. I don't know whose bright idea it is to take a \"Filet\", pound it out like a Flank Steak, and then serve it essentially deep fried in a tasteless sauce but it's just plain bad. The beef has some spice, but absolutely no flavor whatsoever. After chewing through two pieces (I've had sirloin steaks from Chinese fast food places that's more tender) I was done with this dish. \n\nNext up was the Chairman Mao's Chicken ($16). It's essentially five pieces of chicken deep-fried in a basket with no seasoning or sauce. They give you two ramekins of \"sweet and spicy\" sauce but it's barely enough to cover one piece of the tasteless fried chicken. I wouldn't be surprised if the chefs here (at least that evening) has never seen a salt or pepper shaker. \n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles ($14)- this was the only okay dish on the table. The noodles were tasty, however the Wild Boar wasn't very flavorful (no seasoning, big surprise...) and prepared poorly (so much gristle.. yuck!)\n\nBeijing Knife Cut Noodles ($12) - Probably just as disappointing on par with the Hot and Sour Soup and \"Filet\". The dish looked like a bowl of Top Ramen after the served \"mixed\" it together and had a weird, sweet hint to it. \n\nPork Belly Sliders - Never came, waitress probably \"forgot\" since she took our order in her head.  The rest of the meal and service was so laughable we didn't even ask about it. \n\nOverall- this is probably the worst \"Chinese\" place I've ever encountered in my lifetime. Everyone in our party was displeased and left us wishing we had made the trek out to somewhere such as San Tung instead. The food was so bland it makes airplane cuisine sound appealing. To top it off- the vacant tables that we had requested (\"Sorry those are reserved\") were still sitting empty 2 hours later. \n\nIf you're into foo-foo fancy looking expensive \"Chinese\" food that tastes like cardboard this is the place for you. \n\nMy recommendation- save about $20/head and go to Panda Express downstairs instead if you're really craving Asian food.  They will actually put some thought into seasoning your food and the person serving you probably won't act like they take it personally if you don't like something.", "author": "L B."}

It's clean, spacious so one doesn't feel cramped.  The bathrooms are clean.  The bar is quite extensive. \n\nThe food is nothing special.  In fact, I would say it's very Americanized.  Lots of sweet and sour type dishes.  I didn't try the fish.  I tried the dim sum, mu shoo pork, crispy chicken, bok choi veggie and the wild boar noodle.   Nothing was special.  The noodle, bok choi, dim sum, and mu shoo pork was just average.  The chicken was drier than it should be.  In a bit of irony, the dim sum and the mu shoo pork were very the most creative dish.  Both dishes were made better by creative presentation.  The dim sum was in vinegar and garlic sauce which help hide the poor quality.   The mu shoo pork was served as a taco.  We figured it was because it was too difficult for most people prepare the mu shoo burrito properly by themselves like it's usually done.   \n\nThe service was good.  Everyone was very pleasant. \n\nThe total bill came to mid 90's for two people.  That's to be expected for a location like this with such a nice bar.   \n\nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was about 95% full.  If you believe there is a correlation between good Chinese food and the number of Asian customers, it may be helpful for you to know there were 6 Asians there compared 50ish (guess) non-Asian. \n\nThe conclusion is, I would go there again.  It would be my first choice for a business dinner because of the ambiance, especially with business guest from the Mid West.  If my business guest came from San Francisco, Asia or NYC, I would avoid the restaurant.  I would totally avoid the restaurant with anyone that knows Chinese food. \n\nI must give the restaurant some credit for their confidence to open a restaurant in a city with so much better Chinese Food.

We were seated at the table directly in front of the open kitchen and the time was almost 9 PM.  The restaurant was mostly empty with a handful of tables finishing the remains of their dinners.  \n\nThe food was fine, little on the sweet side and some dishes more authentic than others.  The waiter was attentive.  The food arrived within a reasonable time.  The Whole Wheat Potstickers were fine if less than crispy.  The Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles were well done and had a nice firm chewy texture, the Stir Fried Green Beans were tasty and  nicely crunchy. The Shandong Beef Rolls were less successful, the beef was not marinated in the traditional northern style and with too much sauce.  \n\nBeyond the food, the kitchen staff was irritating with their persistently loud and energetic bantering.  They were shouting, gesturing and taking pictures of each other with their IPhones.  We both knew Cantonese and Taishanese and the loud noise in the open kitchen was getting more tedious as the night wore on.   \n\nAt the end of our meal, we finally mentioned to the manager about the irritating noise from the kitchen and he told us that we could move to another table.  He also went on to explain to us that the kitchen staff needed to be able to communicate with each other about their work.  Fine, is shouting really necessary for the communication?  \n\nWe both knew Caucasian friends that are well versed in Chinese, some with greater eloquence than us.  This manager was obviously clueless about what is being bantered about in the open kitchen or he would not have offered his explanation.  He was also obviously a block head since he got all huffy when I told him he does not know what the hell was talking about.  He then got up within inches of my face and spoke directly into my ear and said in a threatening tone \"you should watch how you speak to me!\"  \n\nWhat?!?  Was this guy going to do me the Tony Soprano or the Al Capone?\n\nWell, that was actually the high point of the dinner.  The guy made me laugh and that is worth something.

At first, I was a little put off by the mediocre ratings, but the food was great, the service was amazing, and I am totally in love with the restaurant decor! Located on the 4th floor of the mall, the restaurant is large, looks super modern, and has an open kitchen!\n\nMy friend and I made reservations at opening (5:30p) on Sunday, and we were seated right away at the Chef's counter! I really recommend requesting these seats if you're here in a small group! You get to see the chefs at work making different noodles and dim sum! Yum! The restaurant got pretty crowded as the night went on, so definitely come early!\n\nThough the food isn't cheap, it's definitely super filling!

It's a little salty/greasy, so for those who might be a little more health conscious, I don't know if this dish is for you. But, I loved the texture of the noodles! They're super soft and thick, so they're nice & chewy!\n**Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders ($8)**\nThis looks almost exactly like The Chariman's steamed baos. I was expecting something more like mini burgers, but they use white steamed buns (similar to those used for peking duck). The flavour was really good, and I liked the addition of daikon! However, I do prefer The Chairman's pork belly bao, as it's a little cheaper and they give you larger pieces of meat. \n**Forbidden Rice ($8)**\nThis reminded me of wild rice; the dish includes different types of rice mixed with wolfberries, corn, and pineapple! My friend really liked the rice, and I think this could be a good vegetarian option.\n**East Meets West Cocktail ($11)**\nI was super intrigued by this drink! It's like vodka with chrysanthemum tea, and surprisingly, this combination works!

The only thing is, is that the only seats for 2 people seemed to be a section that put you real close to others.  This section was a connected area that left about a foot of distance between your section of the table and the tables next to you.  I did not like this little seating arrangements.  The food however, was delicious!  We ordered the Shrimp & Avocado Fresh Spring Rolls, it was ok, but my husband really liked it.  For our meals,  we ordered a small Won Ton Soup that we shared and the Hone Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken.  Both were great, and very tasty.  Needless to say, we cleaned the plate off.  The ambiance is really nice, decor is great.  I would highly recommend trying M.Y. China if you are looking for some Chinese food.", "author": "Paula V."}

Gorgeous interior and a busy show kitchen that's more entertaining than watching chefs on TV. They're really capable here and working like mad pulling noodles, frying in woks, deep frying, assembling, making soup. Everything's been prepped earlier so no cutting on display, just lots of crazy hectic activity.\n\nThe menu is fairly long and varied for a fancy restaurant, but not for a Chinese place. You really don't have many choices. Each particular kind of noodle is served one way so if you want the hong kong fried noodles it's with chicken, the pulled noodles it's wild boar, the dumplings it's shrimp.\n\nA basic dish like pea shoots in garlic was done so well, perfectly cooked, perfect texture, it was for sure the best I'd had. Salt and pepper squid was nice texture, a great (but too thick for me) batter, and a very complex dipping sauce, it would have been better if they would include lemons without asking. Whole wheat potstickers were decent. The wok fried shrimp was the standout, just a really complex, subtle, tasty dish, with an ingredient list that reads like \"things children are not going to like\": ginko nuts, acai berries, thick ginger strips, and cooked cucumber, but the dish was just fantastic. We watched the head chef make it himself, while showing an assistant how it's done. It started with a head-turning giant flame of Chinese liquor so hot that we cringed from behind the protective glass six feet away. Then each ingredient cooked quickly and separately in the wok in its own special liquid, then stored. Shrimp last, cooked for several seconds, all assembled, on the plate, then out to our server. The whole thing took barely over a minute, a real treat to watch then eat.\n\nService was a little unpolished and not sure of the menu. Different people had different tones, manners, and attitudes, it wasn't consistent. But it was only the third day.\n\nIt's a little pricey, two appetizers plus two entrees and tea, a little over sixty dollars including tax and tip for lunch. Tea service was nice, a classy pot with tiny Bodum double-walled glasses.\n\nDefinitely want to come back and try basically everything on the menu. It's such a rare treat in SF to have gourmet quality Chinese food.", "author": "Gil S."}

Turns out I was way off base - every dish I have ordered has been borderline amazing, and I fear I am somewhat addicted to the wok beef (was up to about three times take out last week).  I usually sit at the bar and ask for take-out, and am thoroughly entertained by the friendly bar staff. I did have one strange experience at a table one night -- Martin was there making the rounds and I don't know if the staff was uptight or what, but the rice came way after the meal and then we ordered coffee and dessert, and the coffee took quite some time. I casually asked the server if she could check on the coffee and got a stern, \"I don't believe you understand our coffee is individually brewed.\" I said that was fine, but the dessert was about gone, and I thought it would have been better to hold the dessert till the coffee was ready -- and then mentioned the late rice.  She really bristled up and told me (again) that I didn't understand their service, that it was family style.  Not sure what that has to do with bringing the rice 10 minutes after you finish the meal, but the maitre d' woman stepped in, got the coffee and sincerely apologized for the incident. Even that did not diminish my 5 star review of the food. One caution: the portions are very large, so beware over-ordering on first visit.", "author": "Robert M."}

I tried to make reservations but was told they were completely booked all night.  However, since I was shopping in the mall, I decided to walk in and check for availability (considering the restaurant only looked 1/3 full at best) and was told there was a 45min wait.... so, ok... I give them the benefit of the doubt and perhaps they were not operating at full capacity yet given new restaurant, staff, etc.  So I wait the 45min...\n\nThe Good\n- decor\n- drinks were excellent\n- servers tried really hard \n- convenient location (for me anyhow)\n- har gow was excellent\n\n\nNeed Improvement....\n- all the food came at one time!  they had to pull an empty table to fit all of our food (good thing they weren't at full capacity!)  but my food got cold and dumplings should never be eaten cold or rushed (especially when they are $18!)\n- extremely nervous, inexperience servers - forgot order (had to come back and take order), taking forever to come back, only checks in on us near end of meal\n- dishware is too big for the small tables.  seems petty but if you're gonna bring all my food out at once, which numerous pieces of pretty but impractical tableware, something has got to give and I say nay to the giant, earth ware bowls\n- what's up with the pretty tiny glass teacups from vita leaf paired with the old tea pots from Koi Palace (yes, we know!).\n- dumplings were presented beautifully in individual spoons but they lack in texture and taste versus lower priced Din Tai Fung or comparable Yank Sing\n- rest of the food was ok but over-priced since not of it was memorable or particularly great.  Spring rolls were fine but tasted the same as the ones from Panda Express but 3X more expensive.  I appreciate that overhead is high but I'm just asking for better quality food and service.  My dumplings shouldn't have super thick skin that sticks to the spoon or so much fat content that I can't even taste the meat.  And most certainly not when it cost me $18 and I can't even taste the truffles.\n\nOverall, as someone already said.. overpriced and underwhelmed.  I don't mind paying higher prices for the great decor and excellent location but the food and service is truly lacking.  I am unlikely to head back.

The pork belly sliders were interesting.  The pork belly was well-seasoned and served with what looked like radish slaw.  The boar lettuce wraps were yummy.  The flavor of the boar was really nice against the crisp lettuce.  The roast duck which I guess is their treatment of Peking duck was ok.  The duck skin looked dry and lifeless.  It was crispy and flavorful but not as visually appealing.  The crispy chicken on the other hand was excellent.  Good crispy skin with really moist chicken.   I could've passed on the quail.  With the duck & the chicken, the quail was redundant.  I've had quail all my life and it was a flavor I missed.  Their version was ok but nothing compared to what I've had in the pasts.  I can't comment about the Beef pulled noodles as the kids demolished that dish.  I could only assume that it was not bad.\n\nThe service was good.

When you do order the hand pulled noodles, you do see a cook stretching out the noddles before being dropped in the brothel. It is a great date night with a movie and dinner.

I'm a fan,\" but not for what you might think. It isn't for the food, which is good, not authentic though. It isn't for the atmosphere, which is actually reminiscent of Vegas. Definitely not the price, unless it's happy hour which carry double digits for all a la carte items. It's the people. And that aspect can be sorely missed in any business. In fact, for me a good review is based 50% on the service. I just went to a Leica store to buy cameras that average $4k a piece, and that place made me feel dead inside. Especially since I did buy one and found out I couldn't return it after I bought it, but I digress. The people at M.Y. China are great. I love the young staff, and yeah I'm being biased but I now go here once every 2 weeks. I'm not the best at customer service myself, and it's always been something I've worked on, and if I can't do a good job, or don't feel 100% myself I get someone else to be that shining light, because customers and clients come first and everyone deserves to be treated good. Their there to support you. Why wouldn't you try your best to make them happy? You look at a lot of bad reviews on Yelp. Sometimes it's the food, but more times it's the service. I know I said some not so great things about Martin Yan basically selling out, and I stand by that he can probably do more to spread Authentic food at least to keep American's educated on what Chinese eat, but he has a great team driving his restaurant.

And, the oversized ceramic spoons were impossible to fit in the mouth.  How can you eat this without looking like a piggy?  The beef noodle soup was good and the chunks of beef were huge and fatty.

Because it was our first time there, we decided to get several dishes and share them.  This also I highly recommend; there is just so much on the menu that sounds good.  \n\nTo start off, we got the M.Y. Dim Sum Collection.  I comes with shiu mai, har gow, steamed bbq pork boa, multi grain sticky rice, a crispy spring roll and a Macau egg tart.  The dim sum was high class; the egg tart was so light & flaky - (definitely NOT like the heavy tarts that a person is  usually given at those cheap buffets).  Our next course we ordered the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup.  OMG!!  This was soo good that I wanted to lick the bowl right in front of everyone.  When the waitress tried to take  the very large bowl away, I started to grieve.  The last small eat we had was the Salt & Pepper Calamari.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-02", "description": "I was bummed that it wasn't a mind blowing experience for us. It's what a customer would naturally expect for paying such high prices for Chinese food in a town where we can easily find hundreds of great, authentic, Chinese restaurants (the best in the nation!). The food was prepared fine and tasted OK but it seemed to lack passion and creativity... Not even when it comes to garnishing. The outside looks upscale but effort says otherwise. More importantly it tasted like it lacked \"wok hay\". You'll have to Google that but only experienced chefs can get it right and it's difficult to define (but not difficult to identify when you taste the difference!) It is one of the most important attributes that Cantonese people look for in Chinese food. It's what gives food life and excitement. Merely being palatable is not enough.\n\nWe had Chairman Mao's Chicken, which I expected to be drenched in some kind of sauce but wasn't...just a basket of crispy breaded chicken pieces with dipping sauce. We didn't even get any veggies in ours just a basket of breaded chicken. (Come to think of it nothing we had came with veggies not even for looks). This was listed as an entree item not a side or appetizer so I was already disappointed with our main course. I felt mislead. We were going to have this over our white rice but it just didn't go well together texture wise. It's definitely not like walking into a traditional Chinese restaurant, ordering any main course and being able to co-mingle everything together over rice. More upsetting that I look online at another version of the M.Y. China menu and this item is listed as a \"bar item\" / small bites and not an entree. (And it was $9 not the $16 we paid). This is equivalent to a restaurant adding a few extra chicken wings to their appetizer and changing it to a dinner plate...sorry but whether it's 6 pieces or a dozen, it's still an appetizer.\n\nWe also had whole wheat potstickers which were yum, salt and pepper calamari which was mediocre (edible but had no pizzazz in terms of preparation and presentation), 2 bowls of white rice, Peking duck (very good fresh buns but stingy on the duck skin...which weren't crispy and hot either. All I tasted was bun and no skin), and mu shu pork tacos which I enjoyed because it was different though my husband did not like the combination. \n\nOverall we spent about $80 which easily could have gotten us a family style Chinese dinner for 6 elsewhere. I was really hoping to either find some really great authentic food or something off the wall different but M.Y. China doesn't quite achieve either of them. Though the food will suit American tastes just fine, it might not be the place to take your Chinese parents to but it made for a nice date night for us. Even got to watch the light show under the dome while we ate. My only regret is not trying the noodles as fresh pulled noodles have got to be pretty awesome.\n\nOne last thing worth mentioning was the service. I don't know what happened but it went from excellent service at the beginning of our meal to nosediving at the end. The table next to us had a different server from us...however we finished eating around the same time. Up until that point, we had extremely attentive servers who kept coming to check on us. Then they suddenly disappeared. Not for 10 minutes, but for over 30 minutes. It was so bad, that the table next to us had to get up and wander towards the back of the restaurant looking for their waiter so they could pay the bill. They were visibly upset and so were we. From what we could tell no one was able to help them in the back either (I'm assuming the server had the bill). We had to waive a busboy down to help us...who looked unsure how to help us, even asking if we wanted him to box our food or us to do it ourselves. When our server finally got back to us (we waived him down), he wasn't apologetic and maybe was oblivious to how long we were waiting. He never offered dessert or anything...which I probably would've liked to try.\n\nFinally, the bill....which came clamped inside a giant metal fortune cookie. As cute as it may be, I'm surprised by how no one knew this would be a bad idea..HELLO? a huge bill in a fortune cookie for the incredibly superstitious? 1. It's like handing someone a red envelope with a \"You Owe ME\" in it and  # 2. Can you say Cliche'? Fortune cookies are about as authentic to Chinese food as the Taco Bell chihuahua is to Mexican food. #3. What are you wishing on me as I'm about to leave your establishment?

The food was \"A-OK\" hence the solid three stars. The service was okay. For a Chinese restaurant though, they should really have a few more chinese characters on the nearly all-English menu. If you were a fan of Martin Yan / Yan Can Cook, you should definitely try this place at least once.

There were 5 of us and we ordered:\n\nPork and Crab Juicy Dumplings - the dumplings were good. The only issue I had was that they steamed the spoons with the dumplings so the spoon was so hot, you couldn't pick it up from the steam tray. I get it looks pretty but how do you expect people to eat it without burning their fingers and their lips?!\n\nWild Boar scissor cut noodles - Pretty good. A little on the oily side.\n\nSquid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood - the noodles were cut into tiny bite size pieces..you could barely find any noodles in the dish! Really a bummer because the main ingredient is the squid ink noodles.\n\nHoney glazed walnut shrimp - Shrimps were huge! Very tasty dish.\n\nHoney glazed BBQ pork - nothing special. Just typical BBQ pork you can get at any other Chinese restaurant\n\nHalf Peking Duck - Crispy skins and soft buns. Delicious!\n\nStir Fried Green beans - Has a kick to it but good. \n\nForbidden Rice - We ordered it cuz it's \"forbidden\" =) Not much flavor\n\nChinese Brocolli - same as what you can get at a typical Chinese restaurant except this one cost 10x more.\n\nOverall, the food here is decent, but you can get the same food at much cheaper price elsewhere.

These folks have done something amazing, creating a destination restaurant in a mall with no parking. The food was that good!\n\nI was surprised to see a full crowd at 5:30, wonderful servers, interesting spots to view but most important of all -- the quality. The spring rolls were so simple, such clean taste and absolutely perfect. Clearly attention was taken to get the very best shrimp.\n\nThe tea was incredible. It got better with each cup and I learned that the comes from washing the leaves to bring out a deeper, more profound flavor. I believe I had the People's Tea. Incredible and it seemed so healthy.\n\nThe real feat is great presentation, wonderful Chinese food without the heaviness and additives and in a California style with emphasis on freshness. You can get a single dish and be out for $20 or eat heavily and be out at about $50 and you'll feel like you were eating healthy as well as filling fare that sticks with you.\n\nThe plate I had with the gogi beans (?) and red berries (?) was absolutely delicious and clearly a plate to be shared for two. The multiple kinds of rice with the tiny bits of pineapple was \"to die for\" and yet I couldn't taste any kind of sauce. This was a rice that would be ruined by the addition of Tamari or soy. Absolutely delicious.\n\n\nThe green beans just made me plain envious. I steam all the time but I don't create the kind of simple excitement MY CHINE  did with the beans and again this was plentiful enough to share .\n\n\nDue to some other engagements I missed dessert but looking at the menu the desserts seemed quite exotic and I was told that they too were made fresh or took some time to prepare.\n\n\nThe freshness, clean clear tastes, ambiance, pure fun, make this a delightful experience that can be compounded by shopping before or after dinner. I love the Buddha room and think it would be an ideal place to stage parties.", "author": "ALLEGRA A."}

We sat right at kitchen counter, watching them enjoy their work, while the wait staff pampered us. We chose hot and sour soup - rich, lovely broth. So good. Mu Shu Pork tacos - also mouthwateringly tasty and light. Chicken potstickers were ever so tender, with rich dipping sauce, BBQ sliced pork was good but less eventful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-11", "description": "Overall pretty good for a recently opened restaurant.\n\nThe spectacle is key so opt to sit near the open kitchen! You can watch the cooks cut and pull noodles in interesting manners.\n\nThe food was underseasoned in general, but the place delivers on the traditional flavors.  I would think the timid seasoning was due to simply being cautious in light of an American palate.\n\nThe beef noodle was very flavorful. The broth was very well seasoned, albeit a tad bit sweet. Sliced ribeye was the choice and it does deliver both the flavor and fattiness that suits the dish. Traditionally, it would be something like beef shin, but I think that wouldn't be as accessible to most people.\n\nFive Spice Ribs were basically the salt and pepper pork cutlets you find in chinatown. Ribs were probably chosen because they have fewer bones and are easier to eat. The five spice was barely tastable, but the tempura like batter was very crispy and aggressively salted. This did provide a good contrast.\n\nThe springrolls may have been a tad bit overcooked. They likely should have been fried at a higher temperature, but I noticed that several orders came out at once. This would suggest that the cooks packed too many into a single fryer, resulting in a more mushy filling (overcooked). The crust was still very crisp, but a tad bit palid (also suggesting an lower temperature fryer).\n\nThe pricing is good 10-15$ per entree and the service is very attentive. The kitchen may be a bit slow but I suspect it's due to training and the speed will improve with time. The atmosphere is nice; the tables are a bit tight, but no uncomfortably so.\n\nIf you're from the East Bay, this is everything Noodle Theory should be...", "author": "Charlie H."}

Plus she assured us it was enough for two, but it came in a small bowl with only one spoon.  Blah.  The beef rolls were tasty but, to coin a old cliche \"WHERE'S THE BEEF?\".

Surprisingly, this is a nice restaurant that offers the usual: honey walnut prawn, crispy chicken, five spice pork ribs, steamed dumplings, stir fried green beans.  We ordered a lot of dishes, but I would have to say most of them were not great and were pretty pricey compared to other restaurants where you can order the same thing.  The honey walnut prawn was bland, perhaps, because the cucumbers just didn't go well with this dish.  I'm not sure if they were trying to counter how unhealthy this dish was with something fresh, but the cucumbers just didn't go well with the prawns.  The crispy chicken was good, but nothing to rave about as well.  Lastly, the five spice pork ribs is really something that I've never tasted nor liked.  Perhaps it is the fact that is was fried dish, but the flavoring was just not doing it for me. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small but it does have nice ambiance.  I'm not too sure how I feel about the chef walking around the restaurant demonstrating the pulled noodles like it's a trick.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-09", "description": "Benihana, PF Changs, McDonalds, Panda Express.  I'll stop there, but will try to communicate my point via analogy.\n\nPanda Express -- one of the most successful fast food chains in history, but no one is confusing this place for Chinese food.  It's cheap, consistent American food and I actually don't mind eating there from time to time when I'm in that mood and I don't have to make an effort.\n\nMcDonalds -- even on their best days, quite possibly the worst commercially successful food you'll find.  If you take out price/value, there isn't a single thing on their menu that can compete beyond (maybe) their fries.  But that's not the point.  When you're starving, have no other options, speed maters, and forgot your wallet at home -- you find all of the spare change in your car and head over to their drive through.  They clearly have a place in this world and their business success and growth over time proves this.\n\nBenihana -- yes, started by a Japanese guy, but there's nothing Japanese about this place.  I used to be a little embarrassed going to this sort of place, but certain friends and business parters just can't get enough of it, so I make the trip every now and then.  Unless you actually enjoy the presentations, there's no value here and the food is pretty standard given that it receives so much help being (the equivalent of) pan fried in so much butter and oil.\n\nPF Changs (and similar) -- in these parts, this is where I take business folks or really, really Americanized friends for decent American food with the right ambiance, and no uncomfortable feelings.  No one is going to snicker here if you order some fried rice variant, mu shu pork, or something along the lines of beef broccoli.  It's all good and I'll eat more than my fair share too of \"that\" food.  Compare to other, so-called authentic Chinese places in the city, Cupertino, or Fremont -- there is no intimidation factor with hoards of native speakers, the service, or the menu.   And lest you think I'm being a Chinese food snob, that really isn't the point at all.  I know Chinese and Japanese food reasonably well, but so what?  I'm sure many of the Indian and Pakistani joints I frequent are considered only so-so by many of my more knowledgeable friends.  No one cares. There's clearly a worthy market here and these businesses are in it to make money, not get caught up in what's more authentic vs. Americanized.  Unless that's directly and strongly connected to making more money.\n\n\nM.Y. China is clearly in the same bucket as PF Chang's but I think a notch higher.  Better decor, decent celebrity power with Yan (though I wonder how some of his other ventures are doing), and the guy knows what's out there.  Marketing is top notch and the service was great.  He's not going to be able to compete at all on price relative to almost all other \"traditional\" Chinese venues in the city (very few can), but he's light years ahead of those same venues when it comes to a more American demographic.  And that's definitely intentional.  We're in America, there are a lot of Americans here.\n\n\nThough I must say that the one of the small dishes we tried (and we tried a lot) which really stood out as an absolute waste of time was the Chairman Mao's Chicken \"Small Eats\" basket.  Almost no taste, wasn't exactly light, and I couldn't understand what went wrong.  Even roasted chicken with (only) salt and pepper would be far more tasty than this.  Something must have been off that night. \n\nAnd I think the mu shu pork tacos were below average as well.  Nothing jumped out in terms of flavor, freshness, or a new interpretation on this fusion offering.  Certainly not inedible or bad, but we were all underwhelmed -- two native Chinese, American-born Asians, a World Traveler, and a gentleman from the UK.\n\n(Sure, you can poke fun at anyone who orders a dish with these sorts of names, but that's no excuse.  These guys know how to cook flavorful dishes.)\n\nFinally -- MSG or a lot of sodium in the dishes?  Going through an adjustment period?  We had symptoms.", "author": "Chris E."}

The food was great as much as we always love asian food, but the server who we believe named Ary, shes so professional, and energetic though we heard she just hurt her ankle, she helped us to figure out what we should eat and drink while we had no clue what to get, shes very helpful.

The juicy dumplings were tasty but as other reviewers noted they come on ceramic spoons in the steamer. The spoons are VERY hot and the dumplings stick to the spoon so when cool enough to eat they break open. We prefer our dumplings smaller so you can eat the dumplings in one bite so all the juice can be enjoyed IN your mouth. The Har Gow were also large...I wanted to cut everything but with only a fork and chopsticks this was not easy....in hope they have knives because next time we will ask for them! The steamed pork buns were good but would be improved with more filling...but the dough was one of the best tasting we've had. Our favorite item was the mu shu pork tacos. Service was friendly and attentive. We'd like to try some noodles on our next visit..watching those noodles being stretched and pulled was certainly entertaining.", "author": "Romeo And Lola K."}

For some reason the food service is extremely slow today and we have to ask our waiter to check on our food a couple of times and we are not please about it.  \nHere come the main reason I give MY China only one star:  We have a party of four and every course of our food were way too salty!   The dim sum is average (you can get it at any dim sum restaurant for 1/2 the price and taste just as good); the Hot and sour soup taste like sweet and sour sauce; the Kung Pau Shrimp and the beef filet dish portion is good but they were so salty that we need to drink lots of water to wash it down (if they use less soy and salt, it could be wonderful!).  The Beef noodle soup is tasty and once again,way too salty ( it taste very good on the first bite but after a few you realized the bowl of noodle soup is full of salt and msg).  The only dish is decent is the Hong Kong style fried noodle but I expect a little bit more.\nAfter trying Martin Yan restaurants for a couple of times.  I decided I could do without it and so as my other 3 friends.  Sorry Martin, I am a fan of yours for years and enjoyed watching you on TV.  However, my experiences at your restaurants was a little disappointed.  On the other hand, the space is spacious and comfortable.  It is a nice place to meet up with friends.", "author": "George L."}

Although this visit was better, it wasn't better by much. There are still kinks they need to work out. The main area of concern was the speed of the food. We ordered 4 dishes. The first three were brought out timely. The fourth dish took way to long. In fact it arrived over 20 minutes after the third dish. I was about to cancel the order right when it was finally brought out. The explanation was there were \"kitchen issues.\"\n\nThere must of been a lot of \"kitchen issues\" as the table next to me was brought their dessert when they still had one entree that hadn't come out. The table next to them had to ask the server when the last two of their dishes would be brought out.\n\nOn a different note, I noticed one of the \"suit\" employees spend at lot time by the corner terminal just to the left of the noodle area texting. Business or not, she could have done this not in plain view of the dining area.\n\nThe food is tasty but still a lot of \"issues\" that need to be addressed.

Had the 2 orders of the Prix Fixe Lunch. One for my wife and the other for myself. We would get a better sense of their dishes, We both had various Dumplings (made up of five) ,Soup (Won Ton or Hot and Sour) and Main Entree (Beef and Kung Pao Shrimp). Everything was delicious. We also ordered a couple of glasses of some Sauvignon Wine ($15 per) to go along with lunch. If you get the opportunity to sit by the kitchen, do so. Check Out the show. If you are looking for good Chinese food while shopping and don't blink about price, this might be your place. Overall, I probably paid more for service and ambiance.

We made reservations and had one of the nice round tables \"outside\", which made fun people watching for my teenager. \nI eat a lot of asian styled food, typically more casual. It was nice to try an upscale restaurant. We ordered several orders of dim sum. The shiu mai were nice fat dumplings, larger then normal. The steamed bao dough was fresh and not dry. The whole wheat dumplings didn't have the heavy wheat texture, you could tell the dough was house made. When our juicy dumplings were brought out the servers explained how to eat them and warned of the hot spoons. Of course we ordered the wild boar noodles which were tasty and not heavy with a sauce. We also ordered the sweet and sour pork, this had large pieces of pork which had a thin coating (it's nice to have more meat than batter).\nOur orders were brought one at a time, which made it nice enjoy each dish before moving onto the next. \nThe only reason I subtracted a star is that I had to ask for soy sauce (the dishes come with a chili soy, it was good but not for everyone). If you order the tea be aware, the cups are very small. After two sips you have to pour more. Also, even though I told our waiter we had a person with shellfish alergies, I had to ask which orders of dim sum had the fish in them before eating.\nThe nice ending was our server comped our birthday dessert, the egg puffs.

We sat at the bar.  Ambiance is nice.  There is a limited menu at the bar in between lunch and dinner but it was pretty adequate considering.  The service was a bit spotty; we had to ask for place settings, etc after the food arrived.  The food was really good!  \n\nHowever, observing the bar service was not good.  The bartenders did not appear to be terribly experienced and each time someone ordered a drink the bartender closest to us would look up the ingredients in a book.  (Admittedly, I didn't hear the orders, so they may have been obscure drinks.)  My friend ordered a beer and the bartender got the wrong one out twice and opened it, and then just threw them away when she corrected him.  Seems a tad careless/wasteful of restaurant resources.  Then the worst part: someone had ordered champagne and as the bartender unskillfully poured it into the glass, there was a lot of foam at the top, over the top of the glass.  Instead of just waiting for it to die down to finish pouring it, he actually blew the foam off the top of the glass into the trash...yes, with his mouth.  My GF and I were speechless: I said, \"did i just see that right?\"  She confirmed that I had.  We were glad not to have ordered similarly.  This display made me feel concerned about sanitation in general.  For this reason, I do like that they have a glass walled kitchen, but if the bartenders are so poorly trained they think it's ok to blow into someone's glass, what else is happening behind the scenes?  \n\nWe are hoping it had something to do with the newness of the restaurant, when service can frequently be spotty, but who would hire such a clearly inexperienced bartender?\n\nI will go back again for food during regular service hours and give it another try because the food was very tasty.", "author": "C J."}

China restaurant at the Westfield Mall but it was worthwhile. \n\nOn January 6th 2013 I finally had the pleasure to take my mother who was visiting from Brazil and a friend of mine for his birthday's dinner party. \n\nWe ordered three main course and a side order of Forbidden Rice - b.t.w. very well prepared and the presentation quite interesting.\n\nFor appetizer we had Chairman Mao's Chicken. It was crispy without being greezy -fried perfectly. The chicken was juicy and tender, the jalapeno gave it a kick and together with red bell pepper it balanced the taste. I was savoring my seventh piece when disaster stroke, I bit in a big chunck of cartilage -  it completely ruined  for me. I always have bad luck regarding chicken, if there is a cartilage it will be on my plate. At that point I was worried about, but things turned out better.  \n \nAs always the chinese way of serving family style reminds me of home, so we were able to taste from everything. \n\nMy mother had the Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp. My friend and I usually eat that particular dish at the Sky Dragon in South San Francisco - they do a pretty good job there and we always thought it was the best in the Bay Area although I have to admit Martin Yan took the dish experience to a whole new level. It was glazed to perfection, the flavors well balanced, the cucumber touch added freshness - a detail you don't find at Sky Dragon.\n \nMy friend ordered Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles. The last time I had wild boar was in Parana State in Brazil but we prepare completely different from the Chinese. Nevertheless it was delicious the way they served at M.Y. China, a little salty which I like. The noodles were cooked al dente to my surprise - usually the Chinese overcook the noodles which I find a little hard on the digestion. To me this was the best of all the dishes. \n\nI ordered the Wok Tossed Shrimp with Ginkgo Nuts. Unfortunately I didn't care much about, it was blend, a little gooey, and too safe - it is something you order if you are not adventurous. The best part of the dish it was the ginkgo nuts, never had before - the taste and texture are incomparable to anything. We all agreed the dish was a minus - don't order it you will be disappointed.\n \nThe waiter who served us was very efficient although I would rather have someone less uptight speaking a little slower - she ran her tongue like a speed boat, it was hard to catch up with her.\n \nOverall it was a pleasant experience and I will definitely go back to try other items on the menu. The only strange thing I found it was to seat at a restaurant in a mall and eat well.

And I took them to M.Y China, and I ordered all the good dishes that I had enjoyed the previous day: hand pulled noodles with braised beef, Mushu tacos, wok seared beef, crispy noodle with chicken.. We told the waitress we had shopping to do, so the food came out fast. Another good positive experience.\nThis last Saturday, we brought some other relatives to experience M.Y China. Since I knew the menu already, I gave the waiter the whole order. That was the biggest mistake. The hand pulled noodles with beef were served right away, and the cocktails only arrived after we finished the soup. Then the wok dishes arrived fast and furious: lobster, the awesome wok seared beef, the ginkgo nuts shrimp, the walnut shrimp and the Mushu tacos. Everybody at the table moaned, we thought we would have the dim sum and the Peking duck first!! Those arrived AFTER we finished, and while we were eating the duck, the pork and crab juicy dumplings got cold. Everybody was too stuffed already to really enjoy the dumplings. But I still ordered the airy egg puffs, I love those, I wish I live near by so I can have them every morning with my cappuccino. Oh yeah, why is that Chinese restaurants, no matter how upscale, never have an espresso/ cappuccinos machine? Also, our tea came very late in the meal, there was a problem with stolen teapots...weird.\nLesson learned: I will order the dim sum then will tell the waiter to come back for my next order. The kitchen does not seem to course my meal, it seems the cooks are only happy to send the orders out. Is there a chef to supervise and expedite the orders? Also, it must be the new trend for waiters to memorize the orders and not to write them down, but you guys kept forgetting a few items of my order..\nI understand the place is brand new and need to work out the kinks. We totally enjoyed the food and the experience. \nAnd to the people who say the food is not authentic or over priced, may I ask what is authentic? The greasy joint with the cockroaches all over the place? Overpriced? Have you seen the artwork, the quality of the furnishings? Have you shopped for truffles, quality meat or wild boar? San Francisco is not a cheap town, for rent or for labor. So if you decide to eat out, please enjoy the company, the food and the experience.\nWe totally enjoyed M.Y China and will definitely come back. The one star off was for the sequence of service, hope it will be worked out soon for a smoother flow for a perfect meal.", "author": "lovetoeat a."}

We had an Open Table reservation for 5 at 6:30PM on a Friday night. We got a table as soon as we got to the restaurant. The lady was even kind enough to fulfill our request to seat us in one of  the nice round tables at the front of the restaurant where it's less noisy than inside. \n\nFor dinner we ordered\n1)  Kabocha Squash Soup - comes with fried wonton. Definitely felt that there could have been more wonton (it was so good) but the soup was very good for a starter. 2 orders is more than good for 5 people.\n2) Hong Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken\nSo good! The sauce was excellent - far trumped any crispy noodle experience I had\n3) Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp\nMost expensive dish we ordered - At $22 it was a phenomenal dish. I typically hate honey glazed walnut shrimp, but convinced by my friends, I tried one and I actually think this is the only honey glazed walnut shrimp I ever really liked. The dish tends to be too mayo-ey for my taste, but MYChina had the perfect amount of glaze and perfect texture.\n4) Honey Glazed BBQ Pork \nInstant favorite among us. It's a small portion however. But it is sooo good! Words do not describe!\n5) Forbidden Rice. \nLove love love the forbidden rice - it's red + regular rice together I think - the wolfberries and a bit of egg - the combo is just creative and really good. It has great texture, perfect blend of nuttiness and a bit (subtle) hint of sweet with the wolfberries. Great as a side.\n\nPeople even went around the entire restaurant and did noodle pulling demonstrations. Really funny and cool to see! \n\nThis experience also doesn't hurt the wallet too much- For all five of us, we ended up spending about $80. That's less than $20 per person! For the food - that was totally worth it.\n\nCustomer service was speedy - lots of waiters from my observation - we got our food in a reasonable time.\n\nWould definitely go again! Me and my friends are already planning another outing to this place the next time we're all back in the city from college.\n\nThanks MYChina for the good food and good experience! Met my expectations for Martin Yan.", "author": "Hana S."}

The pork buns were rubbery and the pork filling was sickly sweet. The noodles had a decent consistency and the short rib meat was pretty good, but they dumped whole heads of bok choy in the dish which were tough and difficult to eat.

A bit expensive but you have to spend some dough to eat good Chinese food in SF sometimes. \nOne thing I do find consistent at M.Y. China is the shoddy service. They must hire inexperienced wait staff. Our waiter over pour one ofour waters and left a running pile of water that was quickly heading towards us. he didn't wipe it up nor come back with a towel. He walked away and let us defend ourselves from the overpowered water. That's sloppy. Oh and talking about sloppy, the restaurant itself is dirty. So this dinner would be my third time at MY China and each time I've had bad service. Maybe they expect their clientele to be one time visiting tourists, or sit at the bar date night couples and wannabe garish Chinese business people perhaps service and cleanliness is not important. I saw a lot of fallen napkins and utensils on the floor. If the staff doesnt care it may mean.... 'Add your comment here'.

I was surprised by the number of desserts available on the menu, we tried sugar puffs, it was fantastic.  It was a simple dish that is served in many places, but they added chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce and whipped cream, and made it 10 times better.  The other desserts we had, chocolate cake, and sundae, were fantastic as well, we loved the toasted rice ice cream in particular.\nIf you know your food, you can tell that they pay attention to details, flavors, and freshness.

M.Y. spent some bucks on this establishment from the huge bell over the bar, to the wall of Buddhas, to the huge unisex bathroom.  The food was pretty stellar as well.  I'm no dumpling expert but the pork and crab dumplings and the wild boar dumplings were great.  We split some kung pao chicken and the highly recommended scissor cut wild boar noodles.  Both were amazing and very fresh (not greasy) tasting.  The noodles could have perhaps used some more wild boar, but the noodles were so tasty.  The kung pao chicken had roasted jalapenos that were so crispy and not too spicy.  For dessert we got those steamed buns with pork.  Those were amazing.  I usually find those buns to be too much bun and not enough pork, but these were perfect.  Very sweet and yummy tasting.  Yes, we won't be returning the P. F.

First, a few days ago we had dinner there. Got there for our reservation and seated, then waited a pretty good 10 minutes until our server came to greet us, by this time, we had already looked at the menu back and forth a few times, so when he finally came, we put our drinks and food order in. Food came out, tasted fine, we needed some chili sauce and some refills, but our server was nowhere to be found, we had to flag down some other server to assist us. I don't even think our server came back to check on us once.  Martin Yan, was going around the restaurant greeting guests and even he stopped by our table more than our server.  He actually cleared some plates off our table because our server was so un-attentive. We even tried to order dessert but couldn't get a dessert menu because once again, our server was nowhere to be found. The General Manager of the restaurant had to take our dessert order. \n\nThen comes today at lunch, server was more attentive today, but they somehow lose our credit card. We could see something was wrong when we saw our server looking in drawers and throwing his hands up in the air. He, for whatever reason, could not come tell us that he had lost our credit card, somehow that duty belonged to the hostess, who began to apologize profusely and told us they would look for it when they stop serving at 2 o' clock. We look at the time and its about 2:30 and some people are just beginning to order. A little later while waiting for them to locate the card, our original server comes up and apologizes he's still looking for the card. He goes on to tell us that they actually stop seating people at 2:30, but people will continue to be served. So in other words, the hostess came up to us and told us a lie just to pacify us for the time. \n\nAnd would you believe... that after an HOUR LATER, a Manager (Stan Gee) FINALLY comes up to us to \"clarify\" the situation and apparently took us for idiots claiming that while they were not going to disturb other patrons to look for our credit card (THAT THEY LOST); they would however, do a thorough sweep through the restaurant with all servers once things were \"not busy\".  Whatever.  It was just more damn lies to pacify the already almost 2 HOURS we sat there.  To further add to the pile of bullshit lies we were being fed, Mr. Gee promised to contact us regardless whether they found the card or not following lunch service and during the break hours of the restaurant (~5pm).  Mr. Gee also claimed that this happens at least twice a year with every restaurant. (UNBELIEVABLE)\n\nWell, it is now ~5pm... and go figure, NO CALLS have been received.  On top of that, since it was our only credit card; our vacation came to a screeching halt such that on freakin new year's eve, we had to just sit in the hotel room due to the inexcusable mistake by the restaurant and it's CARELESS staff!!!\n\nConclusion: Food was ok.

We ordered two glasses Red,  the most expensive one on their list, $18/glass, but it was so plain. Simply not worth the price. Then we ordered four dishes( quite a lot for two ladies. We were hungry). The food was okay but overpriced.  What horrifying was soon after we started, the bartenders, two of them, took turns to ask if we were going to order more drinks, but our wine glasses were still half full, then if we needed to get our check or order desserts, but we were only half way in working on our food! What more upsetting was we were the only ones being asked in the whole Bar, and so many times! Was it because we were Asian, middle aged, not dressed to kill, and speaking second language English? I hate to say this place is discriminating, but sadly this is the only conclusion I can draw. Long story short, $ 130.00 dinner bill by the end, but simply a humiliating and upsetting experience!

It wasn't busy and there was no dough stretching or some man in a suit trying to entertain people  with his microphone. Yeah.. that was another time I was restaurant watching. This man in a suit had a microphone and I guess he was trying to entertain people by talking and asking questions while people were eating. No!\n\nUh.. anyways.. back to yesterday when I actually went. We were seated promptly, the table settings were neat, everything was clean, ambiance was nice, service was great and you're offered regular or sparkling water. Ooo fahncy.\n\nFood? Ordered some dim sum (forgot what they were) and were not bad at all! The accompanying sauces actually made it more delicious. The \"Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup\" could have been great - the beef was really tender but the broth was way too salty... like it was pure stock or something and it needed more water. The noodles.. well they said \"long noodles, long life\", but I'm sharing this soup with someone and all of it kept going in my bowl when I tried to get some and I didn't even know where the hell the noodles ended. Nice and chewy but too long. There was this other beef dish we tried. Again.. it could've been good.. but it was tooo salty and it comes in a bed of too much arugula.  Oh, and there was like little crunchy bits in each meat. It felt like when you find egg shells.  I don't know what that was. Ay ya yai. For dessert we ordered the Chocolate Ginger Mousse Chocolate Cake with Tangerine Sorbet. That was probably the best part.  But thennnn there were these weird choclate looking pieces under the sorbet. They looked like cocoa nibs.. sorta, but they tasted like the Flinestones vitamins :( Womp womp. \n\n3 stars. I guess it could've been 2. But 3 stars because it's a nice looking place and the dim sum was good. I'd go back for dim sum.", "author": "Mila B."}

We ordered the lobster for two (58.00) and a side of noodles with pork.. we got our pork noodles and still waited and waited and waited for our Lobster. Our server did not order our lobster. instead we had to wait another 45 minutes to get it.. they cleared our table before anyone told our server that he had made an error.  Nobody came around to ask us anything. when I told  the Very Rude floor manager  Amber Black that the lobster was not served with anything that we could use to crack the shell with, she said. \" You should have told someone about it\" as I would have if anyone would have asked.. she charged us the full price even though we could only it  1/3 of the lobster that we waited  FOREVER for.  and then had the nerve to blame us! she charged us 97.88 for noodles and pork, 2 glasses of wine and Lobster that was not only late, but not served properly.  Amber was not our server. our server was a young black man who was obviously overwhelmed with his new job of understanding  \"lobster for two, and a side of pork noodles\" DUH! when I Told Amber  Black that she was very rude, she said \"thank you\"  service sucked. attitude was over the top.. never going back again...", "author": "Judy B."}

Started with the hostess---playing games with us when there were plenty of tables open.  Then we were seated at a table that was broken.  When we asked to be moved, they gave us the option for a table at the corner.  When we asked if we could sit at a 4 top in the front, they stated it was only for four people--later we saw that they sat other couples there.  They got our drink order wrong twice and gave us some attitude about it.  Food was mediocre and pricey for what it was (ie $16 for a small plate of pea shoots).  When we were low on water, the waitress asked if we wanted more water but never came back with it.  Would not go back.", "author": "H M."}

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I feel like if I am going to shell out $80+ for lunch for two people I want to be blown away.\nThe food was okay, enjoyable but the dim sum seemed very overpriced. I have to admit, I do have a bit of difficulty with upscale dim sum since I have yet to taste any that is drastically better than what I can get for dollars at my favorite take out place. I was excited by the idea of the truffle and pork dumplings but I didn't feel they were worth $18 after tasting them. My favorite dish of the meal was the wild boar scissor cut noodles but I was hunting for the tiny pieces of boar. I know the dish is supposed to be about the noodles (which were yummy) but I would have liked a bit more meat, maybe a bit bigger pieces, I was literally hunting for them on the plate.\nThe service was a bit rough. Our server was incredibly sweet but also incredibly green around the gills. He warned us that he was new right off the bat so we were happy to excuse a little nervousness and a few hiccups. However, it did take 20 + minutes to get our drinks and the poor guy was so nervous it made us a little nervous. I wish I could say it didn't affect our experience, but it did a little. But I want to say again he was very nice and I appreciated his honesty and my date and I both agreed that with a little confidence and experience he would be fine. The intention and potential were there.\nThe ambiance and decor were very nice.", "author": "Kater C."}

The cuisine is creative, inspired and very stimulating to the palate.  However, the service is very spotty at times, and the ambience is somewhat odd and frenetic because the restaurant is located in the Westfield  shopping mall, a temple of materialism and crass commercialization.  The decor is hip and ultra modern, very tasteful an interesting., every bit as good as the rival restaurant, Hakasan.  The menu is diverse.  However, the description of the dishes is cursory, making it difficult to select dishes.  I ordered the Shanghai dumplings, which were delicious but served at scalding temperature.  The sichuan green beens are to die for, served with the perfect amount of oil and red pepper sauce.  The highlight for me is always the Kung Pao Crab. It's absolutely out of this world, served with a lot of garlic peanuts, onions and red bell peppers.  (if you like Crab, however, go to PPQ in the avenues---it's cheaper and much more authentic. Unfortunately, the kitchen staff neglected to remove one of the stickers from a red pepper, making the experience someone \"stickery.\"  The sauce on the beef dished was a bit to sweet for my liking.  The waiter was very enthusiastic, but as others noted, the sequence and timing of the delivery of the dishes was incorrect.  One dish arrived early, and then \"pow,\" seven dishes arrived simultaneously, making it difficult to each everything before the food got cold.   The prices are very, very high.  This is not a restaurant for those \"top ramen\" months when you have to catch your pennies. So, you're eyes, already watery from the spice s in the food, will get even wetter when you see the bill.  Martin Yan has done a wonderful job with this restaurant.  With a few tweaks, an improvement in the service, at a bit more attention to detail, this modern Chinese restaurant will become \"the\" destination for those seeking high-end Chinese food.  ~Daniel", "author": "Daniel F."}

The wontons had almost no stuffing inside, it's like eating flour wrappers, the other 2 dishes were soooooo salty that i could barely swallow.

China, but after my first visit there today I can honestly say that, save the glass of wine, that was the biggest waste of $35 I've had in a long while.  As lovely as the restaurant is, and as nice and friendly as the staff is, the food left far too much to be desired.  For me, the pork-heavy menu was an immediate turn-off, and the non-pork-based dishes were few and far between and not nearly as inspired or inspiring as those including the beloved pig.  Usually I have no trouble finding delicious fare at most restaurants, despite the fact that I don't eat pork or red meat.  After sitting with the menu for several minutes, I settled on the Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) and kung pao chicken bao, and a side of jasmine rice.  At first I was served the BBQ chicken bao erroneously; the dough tasted like it was straight from the freezer.  Of course, when I realized I had the wrong item the server very kindly took them back and I was brought the kung pao boa.  Honestly, those weren't much better--the dough was chalky and flavorless, and I kept biting down into hard bits of who knows what.  The Har Gow was a little better, but the shrimp was a little underdone for my preference.  The rice was boring.  Plain jasmine rice can be an exquisite experience, but this was flat and dull and just not worth it.  For all the hype surrounding the opening of this restaurant, I am terribly disappointed in the food.", "author": "Rhonda N."}

I'll say, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful with enough space between the tables.  The food is in the upper echelon of San Francisco Chinese for sure.  It's unfortunate for a restaurant of this potential caliber to be marked down to an experience I would rather not repeat, due only to it's service (or lack thereof).  We arrived for our lunch and decided to stay because it didn't look too crowded plus there seemed to be one person on staff for every patron in the restaurant which to me means fast service.  It took 25 minutes before anybody came and asked if we would like water, another 10 before our waiter came by to take our order.  Mind you, we're on a lunch break, not tourists, waiting 35 minutes just to place our order is cutting it close on our lunch hour.  The food arrived promptly so the wait there wasn't bad, however, our waiter disappeared for another 35 minutes!  We eventually had to flag down someone cleaning the table next to us and ask for the check.  I wouldn't recommend coming here if you have any time constraints.", "author": "Nate W."}

Planned to go to Straits, but got sucked in by the newness. There was one other table of diners and what appeared to be a staff meeting at a large table. Our server was friendly, helped us choose, etc.  All was well until the mediocre food arrived. The pork belly sliders were served on cold buns and the belly was so tough and crunchy it was difficult to eat. (Perhaps they need a lesson from the Chairman truck!) My 8 year old ordered the calamari but it was so salty he only managed to eat one piece. The pork dumplings were fine, but not at all special. The most disappointing dish was the crispy noodles with chicken. Our server had suggested them, so we had high expectations but the noodles were really oily and the chicken/vegetables were in a salty thick sauce that was pretty unappealing.  I was surprised when our check was delivered about 3/4 of the way through our meal, but the server said there was no rush. While waiting for our food we had exchanged Christmas presents, so when we finished eating my son asked if we could play the card game he received. Other than one table across the room and the staff meeting on the other side of the divider we were the only ones there, so I said sure. We played a 5 minute round or two and were having a nice time when our server came over and asked us to pay. Really?  Not like we were lingering in a crowded place with people waiting for our table. As if the sad food weren't reason enough to not return, this bit of business pushed me over the edge. We paid quickly, took our things and left. The worst part was walking out into the mall and seeing Straits across the way. Honestly the only reason I gave two stars instead of one is because it looks like the manager reads these reviews and is working hard to make things better.", "author": "Bonita H."}

He's cheerful and full of energy like in his shows on TV.  This place reminds me the upscale restaurants I ate when I visited my birth place, Hong Kong.  The Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and the Spicy Seafood Dumplings are my favor.  I found out that I shouldn't order the Wild Boar Juicy Dumplings, and Pork and Crab Juicy Dumplings together.  The soup inside the dumplings was always tasty, but if I ate two different soup dumplings at the same time, I couldn't tell which one was which.  For the Har Gow, well, Hong Kong has the best Har Gow.  The service was a little slow during the busy hours, but I always got a good service.  I didn't have a bad meal and so far I like all dishes I tried on the menu.  I also like the aging Pu-erh tea.  It serves with a white teapot with a tiny glass tea cup that is similar to the Kung-Fu tea cup.  One thing I don't know is whether I can ask for more tea leaves after a couple rounds of refills of water in the teapot.  I eat out a lot because I don't want to cook . I tried out the next doors the Straits and the pizza place, and I still like M.Y.China better.", "author": "Raymond C."}
