I asked for 1/4th less syrup (because I'm high-maintenance) and they got it spot on. Espresso tasted strong and delicious, but not super acidic. \n\nI also ordered the breakfast burrito, and since I couldn't find much info on it ahead of time, it was kind of a \"leap of faith\" situation. If anyone else is wondering about it: there's no potatoes in them, it has scrambled eggs, a little bit of cheese, seasoning, meat of your choice, and some grilled onions inside. Something about the eggs feel processed, and the tortilla is steamed. The salsa is of the \"Pace Chunky\" variety. So why, you ask, is this still a 5-star review? Because it filled me up, tasted pretty good, and cost me $5 bucks. If I'd paid $9.50 for it, then it'd be a different discussion.", "author": "Virginia J."}

Most of the boba was hard, while a few were nice and chewy as it should be in my opinion. What I'm thinking is there was a really bad or old batch in there. Although this is not their fault, I forgot to mention to cut down on the sugar, so mine was a lot sweeter than I'd like.

The 1st time was cool. \nHowever that was not the case when my friend and I stopped by to grab a couple of drinks.  \n\nI ordered a Mexican Hot chocolate (made vegan) . After it had been made I tried a couple sips and it was extremely bitter. My friend had ordered an iced soy latte, which was terrible (according to her, I don't drink coffee so I didn't try it). Bc we were both dissatisfied with our drinks, I went back and asked if they could remake the drinks.  When I shared how bitter the Mexican Hot chocolate was one of their responses was,  \"that's how it's supposed to taste. \"\n\nWTF,  I'm Mexican! I've had hundreds of Mexican hot chocolates,  they are NOT supposed to taste bitter. \n\nSo after they refused to remake our drinks, I asked for a refund, which they denied.  Then I asked for a manager. The same chick that said the drink was supposed to be bitter replied, \"I am the manager and we don't refund nor remake drinks. \"  Like you don't make mistakes? Gtfo. \n\nFuckkkkkkkkkkk both of them (especially the one wearing the USF sweater). Additionally, as I was walking out another customer had mentioned that they made the wrong drink.  The barista made a new drink bc she fucked up! What happened to \"we don't remake drinks?\" \n\nBoth chicks were regarded by many (including ourselves) as pretentious, get over yourselves.

Bust open the Yelp app. When I saw that former Yelp intern and all around bad ass, Rachel S had not only given it 5 enthusiastic stars, but also dropped knowledge on their dairy-free milk choices, I figured I'd give it a go. http://www.yelp.com/biz/cantata-coffee-company-san-francisco?hrid=yxvMdJTCvCL359PPMhqFvA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\n\nBeing in San Francisco, we are spoiled by fantastic roasters. Ritual, Four Barrel, Blue Bottle, Sightglass, all come to mind as high end coffee shops that I would normally choose when in town. I don't often go  for the no name places as they don't always treat their coffee with the most attention to detail. \n\nI could tell from the moment we stepped inside that this tiny coffee shop was something different. The lady at the register that I can only ASSume is the owner? greeted us warmly as the bubbly barista engaged us in conversation. You can tell they have fun doing what they do.\n\nEven if a place has five star service, that doesn't mean the end product will be any good. That's not the case here. Even after going to as many local (and not so local) roasters as I can, this ended up being one of the better lattes that I've EVER tasted. I'm not sure what exactly they do differently other than pulling the perfect shot, and steaming the soymilk to the perfect temp and texture. It was perfection in a cup. Whoever roasts these beans, deserves a ton of praise. Score one for the little guy!\n\nAnd can we talk for a second on how smooth their to-go cup lids are? Sounds like a trivial thing until you realize that your lips are gonna be pressed up against it as you sip away the coffee goodness. Taking good care of my lips is how I keep these PSLs kissably soft. Cantata Coffee respects that.\n\nThey seem to specialize in other drinks such as boba and matcha, that which while odd for a coffee shop, I'll defer to the opinion of Rachel S, as \"the best matcha drinks that I have ever tasted\". High praise for sure and I don't doubt it one bit.\n\nThey also stock the best Vegan prepackaged brownies from The Inspired Cookie Company. They just so happen to be gluten-free but you would never know it. It actually has flavor unlike most GF crap out there. \n\nI noticed a Ritual Coffee being built down the street. Even once that store is completed, I would probably still choose Cantata as my first option. It's that good! Now if only they could do something about that pesky soymilk surcharge...   \n\nNote: Do not attempt to park and wait for somebody at the red painted sidewalk just outside.

And you know you shouldn't be getting boba from a \"place like this\" but your body tells you otherwise? That's what happened here. It looks like a wonderful coffee/tea shop, but this review is strictly boba review.\n\nOrdered a thai iced tea boba. The thin layer of boba at the bottom was not sweet, very chewy, and more of a nuisance than an actual added edible delight. Strike one. The plastic cup was filled to the brim with giant ice chunks. Strike two. In the small cracks left between the giant blocks of ice was milk flavored milk with a hint of tea and colored orange. It didn't taste like Thai iced tea at all. Strike three.\n\nI really wanted to like you, but I think the only way we can make it work is if I don't order boba. The other reviews look good and the pastries and ice cream looked good!", "author": "Eleanor Y."}

The James Joyce, is strong yet sweet with some Irish cream kick to the espresso. The Madonna left me speechless and I think I have not stopped raving since.\nThe couple running the establishment are a charm! The lady made me a latte (Madonna), that was smooth white chocolate and just so amazingly raspberry-ey. I honestly never like latte's but this one, I went as far as telling her that it was the best latte I've had in my life. And I stand by it even hours later. The husband (is the cashier as well) was so happy, he took me behind the counter so that I could tell his wife in person and he gave a FREE cookie, which was super yummy as well. The charm of this little cafe tucked away in haight-ashbury is just so mesmerizing. \n\nI wish I could have you everyday 'Madonna'! Please come to Dallas! \n\nP.S.

The milk tea didn't taste like the normal milk tea I'm used to (maybe that's coming from SoCal, or maybe it's simply not as good). I didn't like the taste of the tea, and the boba was really hard and chewy. Overall, the experience was like consuming gummy bears that had been partially liquified and served over ice. \n\n^^that sounds really terrible, but this boba was not for me. I'd say get your classic boba milk tea elsewhere.\n\n***note: I went back to this place and they made me a smoothie to order with their gelato. It was delicious, and the people were super friendly.

As good as it gets. \n\nMy wonderful hubby took me to San Francisco for my birthday last week. And on our first day there, we made a stop in the Haight-Ashbury district. He wanted to shop at Amoeba Music, and I wanted to take in some site seeing and window shopping. After a while I was getting hungry, and hankered for something light to tide me over until we went to dinner, a few hours later.\n\nI wasn't sure where to go, and not certain what it was I exactly wanted. The decision was made for me as soon as I wandered into the Coffee Cantata, at 1708 Haight Street. (415) 221-5555.\n\nThe place is cozy and inviting, and there are enough major choices for an appetite desiring something sweet or to enjoy a delicious cup of coffee. It's a combination coffee and ice cream shop. \n\nAfter much deliberation and a nice-chat with the friendly help I settled on a generously sized chocolate-chip cookie, and a Strawberry French Macaroon. \nI had the chocolate-chip cookie later that night, and as soon as I walked out the door, I took a bite of the Strawberry macaroon. It stopped me dead in my tracks--oh soooooo good! Sweet yet tart.\n\nI went back inside to compliment them. I ended up buying some more! The owner, Vasken, (a hospitable man) convinced me to get something called a Peruvian Alfajores. A big seller at the Coffee Cantata. So I bought a couple! Mmmmm. I was not afraid of packing on the pounds, with all the hiking up and down the hills we do in The City, I knew we could burn off any calories from this tempting shop very quickly, and eat these treats without guilt! \n\nThe service at Coffee Cantata is Quick, Efficient, and Uber Friendly. I got to chatting with Vasken. He and his wife, Tamar, bought the place 4-years ago and did a major revamping of the place. I'm not sure my photo skills could really do this establishment justice, but I was so enamored of it and the helpful staff I wanted to give it a try.\n\nMy husband and I returned late next morning and before a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge, we stopped in Haight and I got some Pistachio macaroons. Which, gave us plenty of energy to stroll the span of the famous bridge. \n\nI'm glad on this journey to San Francisco, we discovered the Coffee Cantata! We will return again to this delightful city and to the Haight District, to make a cookie and coffee stop here. Or maybe we'll give their Gelatos a try. Hmmm?", "author": "Jamie B."}

So we researched online and figured out it might have been a place called Cantata (which is a style of music composition created by Bach - apparently). When I eventually made my way back to SF and Haight street, I am on a mission to look for Cantata. It is all the way past most of the shops of interest to me and a block after Wasteland...and viola!! At long last!! They serve a vast variety of drinks, including fun lattes that you don't find in other (boring) professional roasters coffee shops, frappes from different European countries and even boba and gelato. I got the Frank Sinatra which is essentially a mocha with blueberry flavour. The flavours are really well balanced and not too sweet. LOVED IT. \n\nThe two young girls who worked there were super friendly and enthusiastic. There was also a man who has what I thought was an Italian accent who was organizing things. I thought Cantata may be an Italian word, so I approached him inquiring if he is the owner.

Why do I want my coffee with an over load of any kind of chili. Barista should warn people or it should be posted?  $5 on spicy coffee. For the record, no Mexican drinks chili pepper with their hot chocolate or mocha. Worst experience on their \"unique\" coffee selection. Where is a abuelas chocolate mix!

Last week was another so-so experience. I walked in and there were two girls working behind the counter. Both friendly and talkative with the regulars that were also in the shop. I ordered a bagel and a tea. I got the tea almost right away, but the bagel took a really long time which was weird since the girl not working the register took my bagel order while I was in line to expedite the process. I'll keep coming in whenever I can't wait to get to one of the coffee shops around, but I wish there was some consistency in service.

I frequent Cantata for a cup of coffee (as I am often in the area) and am greeted each and every time with warmth, friendliness, and kindness. The staff and baristas have a special way of treating all customers with familiarity and make them feel at ease amidst all the craziness of the Haight. The couple who own the cafe are lovely, and genuinely take interest in their customers, making sure their experience is enjoyable and pleasant. They are such kind and gentle people, and create an environment very unique to Cantata.\n\nAlthough I normally order only a cup of coffee, it is difficult for me to even consider sampling any of the other cafes on Haight St. Their coffee is rich and delicious, and always brewed very hot. I often find my cup of coffee to be one of the biggest comforts in my day. I have also sampled their vanilla latte and famous \"Audrey Hepburn\" - both tasty treats that complement the wide variety of pastries sold at the register. I highly recommend any of the muffins, the banana nut bread, and especially the granola cookies.

Just not visit again.  What she did to another customer blew me away.  Another out of towner who was waiting to head down to get her tattoo at one of the shops in the neighborhood had just set her stuff down at the adjoining table.  She even greeted us and before she could do anything else, the young lady came from behind the counter and demanded of us if the other woman was with our group.  Before we could answer she told the other woman that the tables out front were for customers only.  The woman asked her to give her a moment and held up her asthma inhaler.  The barista then went into the store and told her she only had 2 minutes or she would be calling the police.  The poor woman decided to go into the store to purchase something to keep the barista happy.  Our friend had joined us by then and followed her in the store and watched in amazement as the barista refused to serve her and told her too late she had called the police.  Needless to say we were amazed and prepared to defend this poor woman.\n\nNow I understand that yes there are those who loiter and create a scene but this was not the case.

I also wish I could give zero stars.\n\nOur unbelievable story goes like this: We were seduced by Cantata's outdoor tables, not because of their makeshift quality--the furniture is crowded, irregularly-sized and uncomfortably cheap--but because it was just a beautiful day to enjoy the fresh air. I left my colleague outside at an open table (there's only 2), and walked inside to order. Since it took both of the women behind the counter to help the 1 customer ahead of me, and since neither was willing to even acknowledge my presence, I decided to head back outside to check if this place even had the wifi that we needed. After 60 seconds of trying to figure it out (in which I never sat down, and instead stood facing the window so I could spot an available barista), one of the women came outside. INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING FOR THE WAIT and taking our order, she immediately demanded that we leave--no, she actually shooed us off like we were animals, saying that the tables are for customer only. When my colleague explained that we were coming in to order (and even though we were reflexively gathering our belongings to comply with her wish), she actually used her short stout body like a broom to move us as quickly as possible out of the space. And then, get this: SHE FLIPPED US OFF.\n\nSeriously?! Why work in the service industry if you don't like people?!

I wanted that extra 45 seconds to decide what drink to order from Cantata.  Some how in that time span (I'm serious it was not more than one minute--I even used the fast cash option at the atm), the woman behind the counter at Cantata came outside, told him to leave, and placed what I assume is a fake call to the police.  I came back to find him pale as a ghost and saying, \"Ma'am I'm giving you nothing but love right now.  I wish you a peaceful day.\"  She kept her back to us.  \n\nNow, I'm sure she gets bothered a lot by people wanting to sit in those chairs.  But even if she has a problem with loiterers--he was wearing a tie and jacket and I was on my way to a United Way event so I had nice clothes on too.  We were clearly customers.  WTF.  Open your mind to the idea that not everyone is your enemy, lady.  What a horrible, scary place to buy a cup of coffee.", "author": "Meghan C."}

Vaskin, Hanada and everyone that works here make it such an enjoyable experience, they're the friendliest cafe on the block BY FAR, they're a great addition to the wonderful community feel of Haight. In addition to all of those warm fuzzies, their coffee is great. I've tried a ton of stuff over the year and it's all delicious. My favorite are the oat bars (fresher and chewier than most!) and blended green tea. Definitely stop in if you're looking for a place in the neighborhood, and take a seat to people watch through the window or chat up the wonderful staff!!!", "author": "Katy G."}

Halfway through, the ice cream got gooey, like it does when ice cream is old and sits out too long. I went back in to ask for a partial replacement for the gooey ice cream and the woman in there got some serious attitude. She told me she wouldn't replace it so I asked for my money back, so she snatched it from me and gave me my money back. Don't go there: the ice cream was bad and the service was terrible.", "author": "Rachel K."}

I've had the coffee here three times, and the last two just because I was trying to be fair and give it another chance.  The ice cream is ok, though, and I like that they exist.  But they really need to get some better coffee.  If you are down that end of Haight, I think I would go with Rockin Java.  Neither place has good tasting coffee, but at least Rockin Java's coffee is organic and fair trade.  Better yet, get a little exercise and walk down to Coffee to the People -- Organic, fair trade, and delicious.", "author": "John D."}

The barrista (generous) looked like she needed a shot of Prozac lumbered down the ladder from a loft and muttered something that just made me think twice about spending my $ here. So I turned around and walked out. The place looked dirty. So far, I am disappointed in the cuisine and cafes on Haight. Doesn't anybody take pride in their shops? The entire street could use a serious power washing. I guess I'll stick with People's Coffee for now. I am used to the quality of Java Beach across from the Zoo.", "author": "Eileen M."}

My fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, had what he calls, \"the best coffee in the entire WORLD!\" He is a girly-man and loves the sweet stuff--and Cantata delivers. His cappuccino/latte thing-a-ma-jig was very delicious. I'd even order it for myself as a treat, given the right occasion. It was sweet, yummy delicious-ness, but not any more than it needed to be. Plus, the lady behind the counter was nice and completely shocked when fianc\u00e9 offered to restock the cup lids. What can I say? I dig the humble people like myself.", "author": "Katie P."}

Since I drink a lot of it, I end up at Coffee Cantata quite a bit. The ladies that run the place are always nice to socialize with, but the drinks aren't exactly the top quality. A size small is REALLY a small, comparable to a short cup over at Starbucks. Their espresso is pretty fair though. Seating is limited, but is spacious enough to sit and people watch for a while.", "author": "Taylor S."}

They have a few chairs outside and some seats at a window bar, good for people watching on the weekend.  I love the older guy who works here, he's very sweet and makes a mean espresso.

Watery and icy would be more accurate. It's unfortunate, because the ladies are pretty nice compared to the dickweeds at Cafe Cole. I strongly dislike the upper haight for food and beverage. Doesn't anyone realize that all the restaurants and cafes cater to tourists, and therefore don't have to worry about repeat business? That's why everything is sub par. Grrrr.

As of the 1st of February, new management has blessed this coffee shop. The new owners are a nice family and the women on the counter (believe her name is Tamara) is super nice!!! She is very warm, welcoming and made me the best cappuccino. The previous owners destroyed this place (reason for all the other negative reviews) but I am so glad the new owners are picking up the pieces and making this coffee shop a happy place to walk into! I have found my new coffee joint and will continue going there, as long as the owners decide to stay put! I will highly recommend this place for all who need a quick coffee/pastry fix! I do admit, it is the best coffee on Haight street.  Thank you Cantata Coffee and to the new happy owners! :)", "author": "Nadia V."}
