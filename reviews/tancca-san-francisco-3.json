The service was nice but I didn't enjoy the drinks as much as I expected. My friends recommended me to try the place out because they said it's one of the new boba places in San Francisco and they really enjoyed their drinks there.\n\nI am a big fan of Jasmine milk tea so I decided to try out their Jasmine green tea with boba. The Jasmine green tea had a really unique taste but I tasted more matcha than the jasmine. Although the menu stated that their Jasmine milk tea had a hint of matcha flavor, I was still expecting the drink to have more of a jasmine taste.\n\nOn the other hand, my friend I went with who also hasn't tried the place got the lychee black tea with boba. I had a few sips and it wasn't exactly the best drink I have tried overall. The drink tasted a little funny because it was more bitter than sweet. But the boba was sweet and chewy.", "author": "Joey D."}

There's always new shops popping up, and honestly, I can't keep up with them.\n\nMy significant other and I stepped in on the way to a friend's house, and went for unusual orders. For $8, we got the raspberry tonic with black tea, popping yogurt, and basil seeds and the super grapefruit with boba.\n\nBoth were misses, unfortunately.  The tonic, between the ice, popping yogurt, and basil seeds, had too many floating bits inside to feel like a drink. Basil seeds aren't for everyone, and we weren't part of the crew that particularly enjoyed them after this. The super grapefruit is quite bitter. You really have to be a grapefruit lover to enjoy this, because it tastes more bitter than tart. The boba is pretty chewy, but hardens quickly in the slushy drinks. Not sure why those pairings are so popular, but they were pretty eh.\n\nI must've missed the real star of the show, the cheese foam, but I was really in the mood for something fruity and light and thought this place would do well from the other reviews. It's not that great of a place to work and enjoy a normal milk tea at, either, because it's so tiny and very warm inside.\n\nTancca, unfortunately, is not for me. While I believe they make high-quality tea, I think that they really need to work on their flavor pairings before they can earn a glowing review.", "author": "Gwen W."}

I was really impressed by the taste because when I usually order less sugar, it can be either really bland or still really sweet, but it was honestly, just perfect.\n\n If you have a chance, please support Tancca.

Anyway....\n\nAfter getting food coma from ingesting some heavy pizza, I was in search of some caffeine as a pick me up. Found just the spot at Tancca. I got the uji matcha with cream cheese, and had sips of the green apple tonic. Drinks were ready in ~5 minutes, and there are a number of tables to sit at (no games though). Service was friendly and knowledgeable. No line on Saturday at 7:30, but it began to fill up closer to 9pm. Cool mural at the back of the shop.\n\nThe uji matcha was decent on the matcha flavor, and likely used real matcha, but still felt a tad bit powdery. I would probably get it again though. I was torn between the puff cream and cheese cream. The lady at the counter explained that they were similar, except that the cheese cream was a bit more savory. The cheese cream comes with a complementary little shovel to scoop away at the cream. The cream had the density and texture of shaving cream, with the flavor of very light cream cheese with a pretty strong dose of salt. I didn't end up mixing the cream together with my drink, so it was like having two desserts in one cup! Boba was sweetened, but a bit firm for my tastes (though not hard in the middle). The cup size felt larger than average. 30% sweetness was true to sweetness (yay!). 3.75/5\n\nApple tonic was a bit more artificial (because apple drinks are not naturally green durr) but tasty and comparable to apple soda drinks, since this drink has a bit of carbonation. The yogurt popping boba and basil seeds added some good texture and fun to the drink. The intial gradation of green on the drink would be a good photo opp (yes I'm guilty too). 3.5/5", "author": "Nicole H."}

I love boba drinks with the cheese milk foam and this place makes it really good. I think I was eating in either the sunset or richmond area so i stopped by here to grab boba afterward. Tancca is on a main street so if you are coming during a busy time, parking may be hard to find, you may have to park at nearby side streets and walk a few blocks, but that's to be expected in sf right? haha. I came at a not so busy time but still had to park a block away or so. \n\nThe inside is a bit small (like all boba shops, so not really a bad thing), but their interior design is really cute and the workers are also really nice. We sat in there to hang out for a little bit and then off we went. \n\nPLSSS get the cheese milk foam if you have not tried it. Don't be deterred away by the fact that they are calling it cheese ;) It's really more like a cream cheese taste. But they have puff cream and tiramisu foams too, which other boba shops don't have!

They did very well with adjusting sweetness as I asked for 30% and tasted my sister's 70% uji matcha as a reference. The puff cream topping was not bad. It wasn't too heavy and complemented the matcha but tbh, I could probably do without it. It did make the drink look cool though.\n\nThe service was quick and efficient.

I ordered the uji matcha with cheese foam, and it had a strong mozzarella cheese taste. Unlike a lid where you drink at a certain angle at Happy Lemon, they give you a tiny shovel to eat the foam, since the lid is just a normal flat lid. The cheese taste is more prominent and thicker. After trying their drinks, I wouldn't really compare this to Happy Lemon. Tancca is unique, and their drinks are yummy! The cheese complemented the drink very well. It wasn't overly cheesy like a cheese pizza. It was very mild, and addicting. \n\nI will be back to try their tiramisu foam and other drinks!", "author": "Jamila W."}

I definitely had a great experience, but am not sure I would come out of my way to get boba here. I usually eat further down the road, where all the other boba stores are nestled together so it just be a lazy factor. I ordered the Assam milk drink with boba, which had a very strong tea flavor. My boyfriend didn't like it as much, but I thought the place had potential. Geary Blvd is a competitive street to be on, especially since there's definitely no shortage of boba shops. \n\nI think branding's really important and I'm not sure what Tancca is going for. The indoor graffiti art is cool, but there's also scratched graffiti on the glass windows. I looked up Tancca for the meaning, but couldn't find a direct translation. Most boba stores have a huge advantage, either they have a viral product that everyone swarms the store for OR the environment of the store is a place where people hang out and stay.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Tancca makes pivotal adjustments during its first few months.", "author": "Emily F."}

The store was staffed with two front workers that were super helpful in my indecision in picking drinks. \n\nWe ordered a Matcha Latte with cream puff and an Assam black milk tea. Both teas were great at regular sweetness but I wouldn't get the cream puff next time. It costed a $1 extra which was acceptable but it didn't really alter the taste of my drink. All I tasted was my matcha latte so the cream puff really made no difference. I would just go for the cheese foam next time for a $1.25 extra. \n\nAs for the store itself, it was not very instagramable. If you're looking for an aesthetic milk tea shop, this is not it. The tables were dirty and so were the glass. Our table already had straw wrappers on it and the space is pretty small. \n\nOverall, the drinks and the workers were nice.

What sets this place aside is their natural selections of teas, I love their Roasted Oolong Milk Tea & surprisingly, their Milk Foam! It's to my understanding that this trend of adding foam to the top of your milk tea is a new thing? I've seen creama milk teas & cheese milk teas which, I LOVE cheese, but would have never gone out of my way to try it unless someone I knew were to recommend it to me.\n\nWell, I got the Roasted Oolong Milk Tea with the Milk Foam which was described as a mousse texture with Himalayan Sea Salt-- YO. That Milk Tea was SOOO good with the Milk Foam! The foam is definitely really thick & dense & not very foam-y at all, it was creamy & rich & the saltiness of the Himalayan Sea Salt just added to the entire experience. They even give you a little shovel to scrape it all out at the beginning or the end because yes, it is THAT GOOD*\n\nThe lady that works there is super nice & I always get served pretty fast.

It's like whipped cream in your drink and it's really creamy. Not too salty and not too sweet. I recently tried their jasmine green tea which stated it has a little bit of matcha in it, which was true in my experience. It had a strong jasmine tea flavor and just a hint of matcha :)  My bf added the tiramisu milk foam to his uji matcha drink and that was also delicious. Price wise, it's pretty comparable to Happy Lemon and with the add-ons, the drink can get a little pricy, but it's pretty good quality!\nTheir fruity drinks are good too. \nAll in all, I'd come back because it is nearby, closer than Happy Lemon, and the quality is just as good.

With the Richmond getting so competitive with the boba renaissance, I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical about ANOTHER place opening up in the idea. But I still had to try it after grabbing my Lou's sandwich.\n\nFirst of all, the owner is super nice and helpful. I always try to start with the classic bubble milk tea, and she was there to answer all questions, have recommendations, and was super friendly.\n\nSecond of all, the tea is on point. Everything in the shop is fresh, from the tea to the toppings, and if they do use something that is a syrup, they will make it clear. And while sometimes this is just a gimmick to make people think what they're drinking is better, it actually really shows! The teat had flavor! I don't like my boba sweet, making most of them just kind of plain and bland, but this was one that I could get 30% or 0% sweet and be super happy. This is for you tea freaks out there. This place has it.\n\nSo in short, I think this place is worth its place. They've been tried in true from their location in Chinatown, and now in the competitive market of Geary/Clement, they have won my favor. Good job.", "author": "Griffin S."}

And trust me it doesn't actually taste like cream cheese. The jasmine milk tea with the cheese foam is super good especially if you just want a little taste of matcha in it. The uji matcha is their strongest flavor or matcha they have and it's not what you're imagining. A bitter taste that matcha always comes with. No this is the same matcha flavor but more accentuated so it's a stronger taste of matcha. You know where I'm tryna get.", "author": "Kristen Z."}

She's super friendly & super helpful! \n\nMy fave drinks are the Super Lemon Yakult Drink. Super refreshing & perfect for a hot day. (Been hot in SF this past week so it was perfect.) Good balance of tartness & sweetness. Of course, all drinks can be adjusted to your sweetness preference. 75% was just a perfect balance for me. \n\nI also love the jasmine green milk tea + cheese milk foam. I love their jasmine gmt because it has a touch of matcha. Plus the cheese milk foam = bomb. The perfect creamy, sweet and salty combo to add to your drink. \n\nMy friend had the roasted oolong tea and it was great :)\n\nThere's also a few outlets so it looks like a great place to study and get some work done.", "author": "Kathleen A."}

Their boba balls are on the hard side which I personally dont like but their other topping options were great. Namely the yogurt popping boba & basil seeds, which were perfect. The basil seeds are very small and have the texture of a pomegranate or passionfruit seed.\nThe passionfruit & raspberry tonic, which one can get with no tea, were very good although the passionfruit was better. Weirdly mine came without carbonation where as the other passionfruit raspberry did. (Personally I liked it without better). The passionfruit snow was good though on the milky side (maybe it was because it was only 75% sweetness). My friend got the oreo snow which he & I both liked (although it does take talent to screw up oreos)\nAs far as sweetness goes, 100% was pretty sweet, I didn't have a problem with it but the other people who tried it thought 75% was more reasonable", "author": "Boba R."}
