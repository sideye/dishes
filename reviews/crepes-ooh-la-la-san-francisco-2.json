During my visit, I ordered a banana and Nutella crepe with some whipped creme. It was absolutely delicious and packed to the brim. There was so much Nutella I had something akin to peanut butter mouth. You need a good glass of milk with some of these sweet crepes. \n\nThe problem was that while I was waiting, they made so many amazing savory crepes that I almost regretted my choice (at least until I tried it). The smells were amazing and I almost sank the place with how much my mouth was watering AND THIS WAS ALREADY AFTER A DINNER. \n\nI can't speak to which is better, sweet or savory, but I do know that the next time I am here I will need to get two just so that I do not have to decide between them. Well, then I will just have to decide which ones I want from the huge menu...", "author": "Andrew V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-09", "description": "On a rainy night last weekend, we wanted to finish our evening off with something sweet (and close to the apartment), so my friend and I searched Yelp and stumbled on this place. My friend loves crepes and after looking at the pictures and how big it was, we were sold. \n\nWhen you arrive you'll notice a long counter area that takes up most of the joint. There are small tables for pairs to sit at, a viewing station to watch the crepes being made and a bathroom in the back. If you can hold your restroom break, I would suggest it. The bathroom toilet didn't have any water in it and overall seemed really sketchy. The staff was nice; it was just one man who eventually had a couple of friends come and visit him throughout our time there. \n\nFor my crepe, I got the nutella and banana crepe for $5.50. OMG, the size of this crepe! It's huge! They fold it into a flat cone and shove bananas and nutella in it, topped with whipped cream and served with a spoon. It took a while to finish it and sooooo good! This is certainly worth the price and 2 people could easily share this. I love how they took a classic dessert typically served on a plate and made it into a mobile treat. Get a lot of napkins though. You'll need it haha. \n\nOverall, good place to grab an awesome dessert. They also serve savory crepes so I'm sure there's something for everyone. Come in and check them out!", "author": "Rockne H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-21", "description": "Along Polk Street, there are two creperies. One of them is The Crepe House, and a couple blocks down, is this one, Crepes Ooh La La. This place is more of a takeout place since there isn't any place to sit on the inside. Anyways, I came here with a friend for dessert since The Crepe House was closed and when I came in, I was amazed by the wide selection of crepe fillings for both sweet and savory crepes. I'm very partial to orange, so I went for the orange marmalade along with almond powder, coconut, and whipped cream. \n\nFive minutes later, my crepe was served, and at first sight, it looks like a normal crepe with whipped cream on top. The crepe is also a bit flimsy on the top, and that could be due to the fact that I didn't have any solids in my crepe, which probably means I need to add some fruit next time. When I bit into it, I was surprised by the spread of the orange marmalade on the inside, the overwhelming sweetness pervading through my mouth. As I was halfway done with the crepe, I was wondering where the almond powder and the coconut were when I finally made contact with the coconut. I was expecting coconut flakes, not coconut nuts, but at least I found where the coconut was. The almond powder was subtle and was also nested near the bottom. In my opinion, the almond powder and the coconut didn't do much for me, and I could have done without it. In all fairness, the orange marmalade probably just overshadowed the almond powder. \n\nIn my opinion, if I were to order the same thing again here, I would just get one filling and whipped cream, and I think I would have been satisfied with just the orange marmalade and whipped cream. Other positives about Crepes Ooh La La is that it is open past midnight, and the crepes here are reasonably cheap for a dessert on Polk Street. I would come back here for the sweet crepes and am interested in trying out the savory crepes here next time. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a full meal or a dessert on Polk Street, and I'm looking forward to my next visit here.", "author": "Nelson X."}

We came across Crepes Ooh La La and had to go in.  It was open and there wasn't a long line, so naturally it was perfect for us.\n\nI ordered the smoked salmon and cheese crepe, which was very nice.  The price wasn't super expensive so I didn't expect a lot of salmon, but I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into it.  They do do well in that department.  The thing I didn't like a whole lot was the fact that it didn't look like the crepes were made fresh to order.\n\nI noticed that when my crepe was made, it was just picked up off a stack of pre-made ones, which bugged me just a tad.  \n\nAnyway, the crepe experience ended up being a success.

They're not just the best cr\u00eapes in SF, but the best and most authentic I've had in this country.\n\nWhen I lived in Paris, I had a few cr\u00eape stands near my flat, and I'd often order them with just confiture de fraises (strawberry jam). I've tried cr\u00eapes in the U.S., they're still delicious in their own way, but only when you load them with strawberries and Nutella, and even still they're not nearly as good as a simple French cr\u00eape with jam. That is, until I tried this charming little eatery. \n\nI ordered a strawberry and Nutella cr\u00eape, while my boyfriend has the turkey, egg, and cheese. Mine was absolutely INCREDIBLE, and he really enjoyed his as well. The batter was the perfect consistency, cooked to the exact crispness it should be. This is totally the place where I'd feel confident ordering something simple with strawberry jam and know it would turn out delicious. \n\nThe staff was also amazing! We stopped in last night after seeing a movie at the French Alliance, and enjoyed the opportunity to chat a bit in French with the gentleman making the cr\u00eapes and the woman who rung us up. You could just tell they were lovely people, and they made us feel extremely welcome. \n\nIt's a small space, but you can easily enjoy your cr\u00eape at a table, or eat it while walking down the street. It's very clean, the ingredients are fresh, and it's interesting to watch your cr\u00eape get made by an expert.

I has blown away.  I've loved them ever since.  Crepes Ooh La La is really good.  I'm hooked.  This is one of the better neighborhood fixtures of the last two years on Polk Street.\n\nCrepes are France's burrito.  This place hast a great selection of savory and sweet crepes.  I've had a pretty good range.  If you are new to crepes, they can point you in the right direction.  Their crepes are good, and hearty.  Every savory crepe I've had has been good.  For dessert, I'll just say, it's hard to beat strawberry.  (orange marmalade or Nutella are good candidates, though)\n\nOverall - a good experience.  The place is well-staffed.  About $6-7 for a crepe.", "author": "Adam S."}

The girls some how thinks I'm paying for her, thanks me profusely, but I'm a bit drunk here and don't realized what's going on. He hears all this going on is laughing. I get my food, I'm enjoying it, and he gives her the food. she takes it and because she thought I paid goes to leave. He calls her out, and says hey u need to pay.\n\nDuuude!

Honestly, these folks don't know how to handle a crowd. SLOW is the defining characteristics. Why? Because they make a whopping one crepe at a time. ONE! I came with a group of 7 people (not really that many, imo) , and I ordered last. By the time the guy started making my crepe, the first person in my group already finished his and was bored, and the crepe maker was still taking his time to clean the hot plate. This place needs to invest in another crepe hot plate.\n\nAnd the crepe was underwhelming. I ordered pineapple and whipped cream, and they didn't even bother to spread the content slightly, so the last two thirds was an insipid crepe and pineapple. No powdered sugar was offered to make the crepe a touch more savory either, but they did offer powdered chocolate and cinnamon to salvage my experience slightly.\n\nUltimately, this is an ok hole-in-the-wall dessert place for late nights... But there's much to be desired in customer experience. I would return (with one or two other friends at most), only because it is convenient and the crepe isn't completely horrible (but what I ordered was definitely not impressive enough for me to suffer through my experience again).", "author": "Elton C."}

I tried a strawberry with nutella crepe and a King Lias (claimed as the sweetest crepe on the menu and that's absolutely true!). My favorite fruit is strawberries and I was surprised that the crepe contained so much of it! I absolutely loved that they do not skimp out on ingredients. I expected a tiny bit of Nutella but there was so much inside when I got it that it was hard to cut with a plastic knife since it kept oozing everywhere, but I'm not complaining. That's what I love about it! An overfilled crepe is simply amazing. \n\nFor a late night snack, I couldn't finish my crepe since it was so big! I think I negated all the calories I burned at the gym, but it was so worth it! Guess I have to try harder tomorrow. \n\nThe seating inside the place is a bit tiny, only three tables with a limited amount of seats. It gets a bit busy after people go to the clubs and stop for a late-night snack so expect big groups and happy/drunk people chowing down on sweet and savory crepes. \n\nThe crepes are made in the front of the store so you can watch them make your crepe if you like and the smell is just so delicious inside the store. \n\nThis place accepts credit cards so it's a plus!", "author": "Maybo L."}

However, we were both disappointed and unsatisfied with our crepes. I ordered the nutella & strawberry crepe and it wasn't anything special. My biggest issue with the crepe was how hard and crunchy it was. I prefer my crepes to be balanced with crunchiness and softness, but this one was overly crunchy, which I didn't enjoy. My friend said she watched them make the crepe, and saw that they have the crepes already pre-made and they just reheat them with every order, which may have caused their over-crunchiness; so they are not fresh! On top of that, the strawberries in my crepe were pretty sour and not really sweet at all and the whole crepe is wrapped with a paper towel, which makes the place seem cheap. Other than the crepes, the staff was very nice and friendly, but I don't think I'll ever return even if I was in the area.

When you ask for it to-go or for walking, it usually stays pretty warm and not soggy since they wrap it in foil instead of a cardboard box (at least with the savory crepes). \n\n* In terms of late night or on-the-go, you can't beat this place, especially for the price.\n\n* One annoyance is that it seems like the time they stop taking orders is arbitrarily decided by the mood person behind the cash register even though hours are posted outside. This uncertainty is disappointing when you've trekked over here with 20 mins to closing and the crepe chefs are still around, especially since it's not in the best of places to be walking around freely at that hour.", "author": "Tasmin S."}

It is a small space, when you walk in, it doesn't look very tidy and clean but my expectations were low. They have an extensive menu with different kinds of crepes to choose from from sweet to savory crepes depending on what you feel like ordering. \nThe service was fast. And the crepes that I ordered were delicious. The place was casual,  with a welcoming atmosphere. You could see the cook right in front of the restaurant making crepes among other things. I ordered a strawberry nutella ans my usual favorite banana nutella. The cook put very generous portions of banana and strawberry.

The guy who works seems like he is there everyday 24 hours a day because I don't think I've been there yet without him being there making my crepe. They are open Til about 2:30-3am on the weekends so if you ever get a craving for something sweet or savory for that matter late night def give this place a try.", "author": "Dmitriy G."}

And here we are, at one of the few locations, yet prime locations where drunkards are a plenty.  \n\nAnd the best part is, you \"think\" you ate a healthier choice as opposed to those bacon wrapped heart, but when you (and by you, I mean I) start venturing away from the simple spinach and mushroom to the turkey, avocado, cheese, and mushroom, that's when it gets serious.  At this point, there is no point of return except finish that 2 pound load to quench that drunken munchies.  \n\nAnd before you pass out with a heavy stomach and enter a deep deep snore, you think to yourself what a great idea it was to get crepes, cause I tell ya, it was mighty delicious.  Even if they have premade crepe sheets ready for reheating and the turkey is just chopped up turkey slices from the deli, that ultimate combo cannot be broken and taken lightly for.  \n\nTherefore, I am a fan.", "author": "Vincent K."}

I think that maybe the night we were there was an aberration, but also it sounds like the main cook/owner wasn't there, so perhaps that made the difference. \nThe main reason for giving a one star review was that as soon as I opened the crepe, I found a hair in it. Yes, it matched the short black hair the cook had, and he admitted as much. The reason I was tearing the crepe apart was because I asked for mushrooms in mine, and instead of the regular chopped fresh or sauteed button mushrooms he stuffed it with cold, slimy, canned oyster mushrooms, that totally didn't fit in with all the other fresh ingredients. So I guess it was a good thing the crepe was full of nasty mushrooms, because otherwise I may have eaten the hair. The crepe itself was undercooked and gluey in the middle. \nSo, if it was just the hair, I maybe would consider having him remake it and hope for the best, but this was 3 strikes for me. To his credit, the guy refunded our money in full. We'll still go back to the Berkeley location, where over many years we've never had any problems...", "author": "Sushi M."}
