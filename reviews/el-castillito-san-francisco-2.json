This was one of THE best taquerias in the city for a while.\n\nThe good line cooks are long gone, left with the most unfriendly, stingy men on the front lines. The dude who looks like Mario from Mario Bros. is a dick, plain and simple. He treats almost everyone disrespectfully like you're inconveniencing him by placing an order. It's not even to me, I watch him act this way to everyone. \n\nEven with this, I continued patronizing the restaurant, meanwhile the size of the burritos dwindling by the week it seemed. Not only that, but the quality dropped. Things weren't as fresh, their health score started plummeting. \n\nWhat is up with the short haired cashier woman who always tries to upsell you like you've ordered a super when you didn't? I see her do this to every single person and most people don't actually understand her and nod yes and end up paying $12.00 for a burrito that should only be about $9.00 and only costed $6.00 18 months ago. I don't get how the price goes up and the quality goes down, or how this woman could go to sleep at night knowing she's a conniving piece of trash.\n\nIn the last two weeks I found a penny in my nachos (they smiled and offered to remake the nachos) and got food poisoning in two separate trips. I've never had food poisoning. I didn't know what it meant to have it come out both sides until my last experience here. I also noticed they are no longer posting their health score. For the first time ever, it was missing, coincidentally my last visit.\n\nLet me just end by saying they've lost ANOTHER loyal neighborhood customer.", "author": "William L."}

Although I can't say this is my favorite burrito in SF (I'm looking at you, El Farolito!), it's a very solid option for Mission-style burritos in the Castro/Duboce Triangle area. \n\nFor one, the portion sizes are enormous (I've never been able to finish a burrito in one sitting and I'm not a light eater) and the prices are quite reasonable for food and drinks (beers and sodas are both very cheap!). Your burrito is also assembled in front of you and they ask for your input along the way, to make sure they only include what you want. As a person who hates sour cream, for example (I know! Blasphemy!), knowing I can omit it easily here is a game changer - I can actually enjoy a super burrito! I've only tried the chicken as far as meats go, which is always tender and flavorful. \n\nThe ambience is super low frills with limited seating, but it works. The line can be long at times, but I've never had to wait too long to eat or had trouble finding a place to sit. The servers are pleasant and help you catch on to the \"rules\" of how to order if you aren't familiar, which is appreciated. They offer free chips and a salsa bar with some good options. \n\nCash only so make sure you stop at an ATM first!", "author": "Christine G."}

Got that hole-in-the-wall authentic feel.  The big mound of al pastor looked amazing, but was a tad disappointing.  Everything else was fine though, hence the A-OK (i.e. 3-stars).\n\nQuesadilla Suizas w/ Al Pastor: Well this isn't the type of half moon shaped quesadilla you'd get at a chain restaurant.  It's burrito shaped, but filled with just meat, cheese and sauce.  None of that unnecessary rice or beans or vegetables.  And there's a ton of cheese, I saw them cover the whole tortilla surface area with slices.  I was really looking forward to the al pastor, because I saw the huge spit of pork roasting in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, my al pastor wasn't sliced off fresh but rather came from a pre-chopped bin.  It got reheated on the griddle.  None of it was particularly crispy unfortunately.  Also, tasted a bit gristly like it was cooked too fast instead of slowly turning on that spit all day.  I liked the general format of the quesadilla, but perhaps another meat choice would have been better.\n\nCantaloupe Agua Fresco: This was huge!  Almost like Big Gulp territory.  There was a lot of sugar water, but still enough cantaloupe to be legit.  Very refreshing.", "author": "Adam B."}

I will overlook the absence of the guacamole that is supposed to come with the super burrito. In this case, unlike so many Chipotle burritos before it, guac was not a necessity. The gratuitous chips that came with the burrito were also welcome, warm and crisp, and the selection of condiments for your burrito and chips were also a huge plus. \n\nIf there's one reason to persuade me to move from the East Coast to San Francisco it's a Mission burrito, and my El Castillito burrito was all the convincing I needed.", "author": "Arthur C."}

Then I went to the gym on empty, so that by the time I ended my day at around 10, I was actually ready to throw up I was so hungry.  I was on Ashbury and Frederick when I pulled over, threw on the emergency lights (it was a food emergency, the most serious of them all, actually), and searched yelp for burrito, filter \"open now,\" filter \"nearby.\" Indeed.\n\nMy search brought up El Castillito, and so I drove like a bat out of hell to Duboce Triangle. I walked in and there was a line of sk8ers (their boards were propped against the wall), which I took as a good sign. EC is a bit of a dump, which is also a good sign with respect to Mexican food. The inside is small, a little messy, and disorganized. There's a huge window where you can watch the cooks put your order together. There's a big spindle of meat next to the grill. All good. \n\nI shouted my order over a bunch of guys waiting for their orders. I was all business, given that I was almost going to die of hunger, and ordered a pretty safe burrito: super chicken burrito, light pinto beans, light guacamole. They called my order lightening quick - and I paid lightening quick too (CASH ONLY - but note there's an ATM in the burger joint next door). Then I flew home so I could eat the hell out of my burrito in private. \n\nOh my goodness, that burrito hit the spot. It was huge - I could only eat half - but it was 7 shades of delicious. The quality ingredients were combined in perfect proportion to one another, such that every bite was yummy. I appreciate assembly when it comes to burritos. I usually don't get guac on a burrito because it always takes me 2 days to eat it and I don't particularly like brown guac - but the guac stayed perfectly green the next day.  The burrito also tasted delicious cold. \n\nThe only criticism I have of EC is that their salsa bar is not the greatest. But the burrito is so good, you don't really need salsa. Skip it. \n\nCheap, open late, and tasty. Recommend.", "author": "Sunny S."}

The al pastor was on the sweet side for me and so I probably wouldn't order it a second time unless I'm really craving it. If you've had Chinese BBQ pork (cha siu), it tastes like the Mexican version of that. However, I did enjoy the carnitas. \n\nThere are regular burritos and super burritos--the main difference is that the super has sour cream, cheese, and guac. \n\nTheir salsa/condiments bar is pretty great. They have spicy pico and regular pico de gallo, however their pico tastes more herby than the traditional ones I'm used to--as if there were Italian spices mixed in...? They had this green sauce which was absolutely AMAZING. I was totally in love with this one. There was also a fire roasted tomato salsa and some spicer orange-colored sauce.

We didn't plan on what to eat (so out of character of me I know) so we walked a few stores from clarion alley to find ourselves in front of this little taqueria. It looks smaller on the outside. It goes in pretty deep and has a lot of seating. The bathroom here didn't need a key and I mean, hey how many places do you ever see now (esp in SF) that'll let you use a bathroom without requiring you buy something!? I was kind of surprised. \n\nThe plan was to get \"something small to share.\" So a quesadilla is usually a safe bet for something small, right? Compared to a burrito that'll be too big for our appetite at the time, a quesadilla sounded perfect!\n\nBoy were we wrong. But it wasn't a bad thing. There was nothing small about that quesadilla. It was basically a burrito. We actually had to ask if the order was ours because if you see in photos, it looks like a burrito!! It was just so STUFFFED with all the goodness that it ended up having a round-ish shape like it's loved cousin the burrito. The difference is that instead of the soft, almost falling apart because it's so soft, texture a burrito has, this tortilla was soft but crispy on the outside-like a quesadilla should be. It's definitely worth the money for what you get. Although size stood out, the taste of the quesadilla wasn't the most memorable. Flavors weren't all there and the thing that distinguishes a quesadilla from a burrito is that one of them should have way more cheese.. At least that's how I've always known and what I look forward to in a quesadilla! There was so much other stuff in there that cheese seemed to be little to almost none.

After sharing this \"find\" with friends, at least a couple were like, \"Oh, yeah, I go there all the time. It's my favorite.\" \n\nThis is the quintessential hole-in-the-wall taqueria. It looks a little grimy - 85 out of 100 on health inspection, but I can live with that. There is always a line after work, but they're super efficient in getting you through.\n\nI am a creature of habit, so I have only sampled the steak-n-shrimp super burrito and the shrimp quesadilla. Both are near perfection for a neighborhood taqueria - tender steak and clearly fresh shrimp. They're not skimpy with accompaniments, so expect a fat burrito - usually two meals for me. After reading a few of the reviews on here, I see I need to up my game and try the pork carnitas or al pastor - perhaps in tacos. Next time!\n\nGreat selection of salsas and sides.

Sure, I'd heard that I'd be equally impressed with the state's \"Baja Mexican\" style of cuisine vs. the Lone Star State's \"Tex-Mex\" fare, but it was hard to tell if it those comments were based on mouth-watering facts, or simply Bay Area civic pride. Well, needless to say that spots like El Castillito are making sure that it's the former, and not the latter.\n\nI found myself at El Castillito because the Warriors had just won their first championship in 40 years, because it was late, and because dammit, I needed a burrito! Yes, a late-night victory burrito was in order.\n\nTo date, this is the best burrito I've had in San Francisco. I did my research going in, and quickly selected the Al Pastor Super Burrito, hearing that was the go-to on the menu. This succulent pork burrito was definitely the way to go, but it was the little things that set it apart. First, none of the other extra fixin's were overpowering the others, a common issue across most burritos. In addition to the heavenly meat itself, the onions, guac, black bean, rice, sour cream, and mild sauce were all in perfect harmony, in the perfect amounts, and staying within the confines of the tortilla. \n\nSpeaking of the tortilla, while the meat is being prepared on the grill, so is the tortilla! This gives the burritos floury shell a subtle but noticeable \"crunch,\" a trait seriously lacking in most burritos. In addition to the tortilla prep, three slices of cheese are laid across the surface while it heats up on the grill, providing a perfect distribution of cheesy goodness across the soon-to-be burrito.\n\nWhile Duboce Triangle may not be The Mission, it's close enough, and I'd put El Castillito toe-to-toe with some of the biggest names in the SF burrito scene. As one of the busiest crossroads in the city, it's a relief to know that there's a delicious burrito right nearby.", "author": "Chris L."}

All their ingredients were on point, the tortilla was juuuusssstttt the right amount of crunchy (I'm a texture whore, sue me!) and it actually impressed me how well bro working the grill kept his station clean even as he was working and filling multiple orders... I always assume when I go to grab a burrito that its going to touch SOMETHING unsanitary, and accepted that was just a hazard that comes with the territory so it was reassuring to see somebody taking care of their work space well.\n\nI tried to save the other half of the burrito for later... it didn't make it home :-P\nI'm also afraid that all the other taquerias I frequent on the peninsula will all be disappointing in comparison from now on", "author": "Stephen L."}

I am definitely coming back the next time someone suggests getting burritos when I'm in this area.\n\nThis massive burrito was everything I could have asked for, and it was prepared quickly and right in front of me, and they even let me substitute salsa for red sauce. I don't even know what red sauce is. All I know is that I love it and require it in all things within a tortilla, and I am grateful to them for letting me substitute for it...though I will say it was quite spicy. In a good way.\n\nNext time, I want to get a quesadilla, because it looked massive and all kinds of amazing. This place is cash only, and you get a lot of burrito for your money. I was full by about 1/4 of the burrito, but pride egged me on to go at least to half the burrito. By then I'm sure I was already lost in a food coma.

The service was not friendly but I was like okay that's not not so bad. Despite the hurried and annoyed employees, it seemed right up my alley. But upon entering, prices were way higher than expected. And upon trying the food, i quickly figured out this shit was way overpriced. In my opinion El Farolito has the highest quality ingredients as for taste, and their prices aren't has high and they're way more popular. It wasn't even just the prices, the food was bad. The al pastor tacos were all fat. The carne asada tasted like shitty meat. The carnitas were okay at best. I could have gotten better ones almost anywhere. \n\nAND THE WORST PART, the fucking refried beans. Imagine taking a can of uncooked Goya pinto beans, put them in a blender, then sloppily spoon it into a to go plate. Those are their beans. Salt was nowhere in the picture. Even if was, the beans couldn't be saved. I tried putting some of their salsas in the beans, and the salsas were sub par too. Not fresh or that tasty.\n \nIf you're around these parts in SF, I guess Castillito is an okay choice.

There's nothing particularly unique about the menu (they have your typical tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, and fajita/seafood plates), but the quality of the food is really good.\n\nAll of the meat is grilled after you order it and you have the choice of mild or spicy salsa and refried or black beans. I highly recommend the super wet burrito. No, it's not super wet, it's a super burrito (add avocado and sour cream) that's smothered in avocado tomatillo or red chile sauce. They then melt cheese over this and pile on some more salsa for good measure. Definitely the most bang for your buck on the menu. \n\nWhich reminds me... just about everything on their menu is below $10!", "author": "Bryce A."}

It didn't seem like any of the locks worked so I was focusing on keeping the door from opening. This distraction kept me from noticing employee that was watching me pee from outside the window above the sink. I didn't notice until after I was in the process of pulling up my pants.  I stared at him in disbelief of what was happening, and he paused and then slowly creeped out of view.  Couldn't see his face because it was dark, but I could easily recognize the uniform that all of the cooks were wearing.  Basically he saw me go in and then headed around for the free (non-consensual) show.

Plus the \"people on yelp love us\" sign (though faded) doesnt lie. Although my interest has been sparked, I never found a reason to pop in until recently after a fun-filled day of laughter, coffee and Dolores park with Mrs. Angie N./L.\n\nImagine this: sitting in Dolores park, slightly hungover... stomach rumbling. You know el farolito is a few blocks down but el castillito's bright yellow sexy self keeps popping up in your head as an alternative. Seeing as it's on the way back to the train, we opted for something exciting and new and trekked on over en-route home. \n\nComing in, youll strut down a few steps and down a runway to Mexican goodness. Menu is similar to its counterparts in the neighborhood: tacos, dinner plates, burritos, quesadillas, nachos. Simple, just the way we like it.\n\nI opted for the quesadilla castillito: any meat, cheese, avocado, sour cream, tomatoes & jalapenos. I went with carnitas but I do applaud that they offer a bbq pork option as well (which is what i shouldve gotten). The meat was seasoned well, large portion, not stingy on the sour cream nor guac and dripping with grease; just the way the mexican food gods intended. \n\nAngie N went the safe(r) route with the enchilada plate: two enchiladas with your choice of meat, cheese, and sour cream. Like her food idol & hero (me), she went with the carnitas as well. When it comes to taste/quality, see above. The saving grace was the portion: enough to feel her, the Army of the Czech Republic (Arm\u00e1da \u010cesk\u00e9 Republiky for those historians) with enough to take home and eat the next day (as I ate microwavable peasant Safeway). Tis life my friends, tis life.\n\nWhat it comes down to is El Castillito is solid mexican food, healthy servings at a low price point while in the area. Do I beg you to go out of your way leaving you singing its praises from the rooftops? Nah. but the fact that we spent +/- $17 for a food coma and leftovers speaks volumes.\n\nStay faithful to your wife (insert: taqueria of your choice) but definitely get a taste of El Castillito (that cute little receptionist after a drunken happy hour) while in the neighborhood.

It's hard to compare to the renowned taquerias in the Mission since I haven't really gone to enough to provide an accurate assessment, but looking at chains such as Chipotle and other small burrito shops around SOMA and North Beach, I'd have to say that this place is tops!\n\nWe ordered a chicken burrito and a veggie quesadilla. I was concerned when I saw a burrito shaped wrap on the grill, thinking they'd confused my order and I was getting a burrito instead, but apparently their definition of quesadilla is \"burrito cooked on the grill, without tinfoil\". Except to use a fork and knife to eat this thing, it's pretty much impossible to pick up.\n\nWhen thinking of other quesadillas I've had, there's one place that stands above what I had at El Castillito, but in fairness, this was so vastly different from the mushroom quesadilla I've had elsewhere, I can't say one was better than the other.

Across their salsa bar, I've only found a couple really nice salsas, and they too don't always seem very fresh. Consistency is also a slight concern - I've found based on time of day, chef, and level of 'busyness,' quality can vary.

Never trust a sour cream lovin Midwesterner to do the job of a born n' bred Southwesterner is all I'm saying. \n\nI tried El Farolito first. Pretty tasty, but not really any better than most places back home. It seemed like my assumptions of the false superiority of SF burritos were confirmed...that is until a friend also visiting SF at the time for a conference turned me on to El Castillito. He and his wife had gone there the day before and both swore by it. This got me excited, so I checked their hours. 30 minutes till closing time and I'm in downtown. Guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow. \n\n...But I couldn't take the wait. I ran out, hailed a cab, and explained to the bewildered driver that yes, I need to get this burrito before they close in a half hour, so step on it! The confused driver dropped me off well before the correct location telling me this is where I needed to be. I didn't argue. I had business. Dressed to the nines I old lady power-walked it up the road. \n\nThe joint was just what it was supposed to be: small, non-pretentious, and straight ahead. After getting eye ball interrogated by the too-cool-for-school kiddies I made my way to the front. One pork al pastor taco for here, and a regular carne asada burrito to-go, please. \n\nDown to business. I inhaled the taco in record time. A large portion of perfectly seasoned pork al pastor with ample onions and cilantro on top, nice soft, fresh corn tortilla, and excellent tomatillo salsa, pico de gallo, and spicy red salsa. Should have order two, dang-it. \n\nIn an exercise of supreme self control I somehow, someway, saved most of the burrito till the next day. Round two was just as good as the first. This was what I was looking for in a burrito. Expert balance of flavors and pro burrito rolling. \n\nI hated to admit it at first, but this was one fine burrito. I clearly stood corrected...but only to a degree! It was not significantly better than its AZ counterpart (and yes, this is a valid comparison as AZ and CA Mexican food is, by-and-large, not an apple/orange comparison); however, this was one superbly done burrito that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone.", "author": "Eric B."}

Not only are you asked to feel bad about yourself (which, if you've been raised Jewish, isn't that hard), but you're also supposed to abstain from food and drink for 25 hours. That truly sucks. \n\nIf you've been raised right, you know that having to fast means that you can eat copious amounts of whatever the hell you want beforehand (gotta get those calories in somehow!), and if you've lived in San Francisco you know the proper choice is the Super Burrito: a foodstuff that is virtually a categorical imperative in any situation. The super burrito is the a priori choice for the mad hacker (fingers flying on keyboard to \"stimulate the economy\"), the homeless man with seven bucks and change in his pocket, the graduate student, the drunkard, the Jewish boy preparing for a fast (Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses). Google, Twitter and Facebook be damned, the Super Burrito is San Francisco's gift to the world. \n\nAfter a run of bad burritos in some of the Mission District's most vaunted slab-houses, I decided to return home to El Castillito, which has been producing consistent badassery in the form of Super Burritos for as long as I've been in The City. The al Pastor remains some of the best in the city: tender, well-spiced, saucy, with enough onions to provide a toothsome bite and a hint of sweetness. Thats not to say that I wouldn't say no to their cinnamon-touched chicken, or their tender steak, but to deny the brilliance of their Pastor is grounds for a Torquemada style inquisition, a 5150 hold, and/or immediate deportation to Nebraska. The day that Castillito's Pastor disappoints is the day the world ends: meteors will fall from the sky upon the Mountain View campuses, Larry Ellison will apologize for being a massive dick, I will go on a successful date (Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies! Rivers and seas boiling! Forty years of darkness! Earthquakes, volcanoes! The dead rising from the grave! Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!).\n\nAt the best, the burritos here are earth-shattering, defined by marvelously griddled to flakey tortillas, totally melted cheese, fantastic guacamole, delicious rice and beans. The ingredient mix is often spotty, with a little too much sour cream, rice segregated at the bottom, etc. and I could ALWAYS use a little more spice, but the liberal application of some of their hell-raising chiles torreados usually fixes that right up. These are damn good burritos, comically sized, and easily able to take on their Mission District brethren in both flavor and value. \n\nThanks to El Castillito, I made it through my 25 hour fast with nary a pang of hunger (Alright, thats a goddamned lie, it sucked. It always sucks. Its supposed to suck). \n\nOverall: 4.5 Stars, rounded up because of their succulent al Pastor.\n\nExtras: \n\nWhile eating at the street-facing bar, take a moment to admire the totally awesome folk art on the ceilings (look for the aztec warrior done in the style of Da Vinci with a step pyramid covering up his junk).\n\nChips suck, salsas are marvelous.

It's not the normal folded tortilla filled with cheese and cut in triangles, it's more like a flattened burrito. It's hefty and cumbersome and just so delicious.

I decided to give Castillito another go and this time decided to splurge on the super burrito and on a whim, selected Al Pastor as my meat.  It made all the difference.  The juiciness from the marinated meat along with the cheese and guacamole made the burrito a perfect flavor bomb.  It's essentially the best burrito I have had in my history of burritos.  The only chink in their armor are their chips.  Really mediocre.  That said, they probably have the best tomatillo salsa in the city. It's thick with the perfect heat.  If I had the will power to only eat half a burrito and save the rest for later, then I would come here more often.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

Whether I get al pastor or chicken, it is always tasty, one of my favorite burritos in the city. I should note that their al pastor is awesome. \n\nWhile the super burrito is one of my favorites, I don't consider El Castillito to be a five-star Mexican joint because their tortas and super sauzas are just at par, certainly not bad items though. \n\nI also like this place because it gets hole in the wall status in my book. You walk down a few steps as you enter and there is nothing but four or five tables, counter eating space and a good salsa bar in the fairly small establishment - plus the register and kitchen in the back. The staff is cool too. \n\nClosing words: Get the super burrito and you'll be happy. It is immense and very tasty.", "author": "Mark B."}

Living in between the Lower Haight and the Castro, it was definitely convenient and much closer than all of the more popular Mission burrito spots. It's right outside the subway tunnel/track switch, across the street from Safeway, so it's also easy to get to via Muni, if you don't feel like hassling with parking.\n\nThat said, it's not as though El Castillito was just a cheap substitute. Fat, just on the verge of exploding burritos is what they slang here. \n\nIt was cheap to eat here 11+ years ago. And when I recently returned, I was pleased that although adjusted for the time, the burritos are still very affordable. And given the aforementioned size, a single burrito can easily feed two. \n\nIt's cash-only here, so make sure to get cash back at the Safeway before you head in. No fountain drinks either (just canned sodas) if that's your thing too.\n\nI can only dream of burritos such as these when I'm foraging for Mexican food where I am now.", "author": "Cee A."}

The burritos are large, available in standard flour, tomato, wheat or spinach tortillas. Pinto beans or black beans, tons of fresh veg, and oodles of gooey queso are standard. The salsa is also excellent, with a special shout out given to the avocado salsa (which most reviewers are referring to as salsa vere).\n\nBut hey there, Georgie Girl, there's more to EC than just burritos (even though they are consistently rated amongst the best in the City on BurritoEater.com - and I don't care what anyone says, they are BETTER than Papalote). The tortas are out of this world, the quesadillas are basically extra cheesy burritos sans beans (unless you go vegetarian) and the chillaquilles are top notch.

They supposedly serve veggie burritos (I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't really like meat...I know, I know, what's the point of a burrito?) \nB. they seemed a little bit healthier than some of the alternatives. \n\nI was quite happy with the outcome. I went with the super veggie burrito. Although, I have to say I was slightly disappointed because other reviews on here say they had all sorts of grilled veggies in their burrito. Mine was simply beans, rice, sour cream, guac, avocado (I asked for it, I'm a huge avocado fan), lettuce, tomato, onion, and spices. Now, I'm not complaining about this at all because in the end, my burrito was the size of a small baby for around $5, AND it was delicious, but I was expecting some sort of veggie in the burrito. Oh well, I guess that's what I get for not eating meat. \n\nOther pros, the service. SO FRIENDLY. The guy even drew a little face on my burrito foil. I know, it's small, but it makes a difference.\n\nAlso, the salsa bar. I'm from the east coast so this is totally uncommon to me. But OMG the salsa bar is probably what sold me on this place. The pico de gallo is AMAZINGLY fresh. (Get the one with fresh jalapenos in it, yum!). And the green salsa. OMG. So fresh, you can TASTE the avocados. And I got to fill up as many little containers as I wanted! I think I took an average of 6 altogether. AND free chips. Everything was fast, friendly, and yummy. I'd certainly go back.", "author": "Chantal G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-31", "description": "I like good cut, well-cooked meat in my burrito, so the first thing I look for is how good the meat looks in the steam table. EC was below average, the beef and chicken looked like it had been parboiled (no char, bland color), but then they finish it off on the grill for a bit of char. Not the same taste as real open flame grilled meat. The Al Pastor is a bit better, it's real spit-roasted, but what they give you is not freshly cut off the spit like other places, but has been sitting in broth for awhile. Presumably they cut fresh pork whenever they start to run out, but it could be hours of un-freshness. The cut of pork they use is also fatty and had gristly bits I had to spit out.\n\nThey give you a lot of meat for the money, but it's cheap cut and not well cooked, so that tradeoff you'll have to decide for yourself. The rest of the burrito was standard fare, OK but nothing special.\n\nAlso, as a side note about spinach tortillas. I suspect they are green because they have tons of food coloring in them, not because they have spinach. If you've ever made cream of spinach soup, it's mainly a white soup with flecks of green in it. Should be the same thing with tortillas. Recently I've been looking at the spinach tortillas I get and I've noticed some coloring inconsistencies, like areas of intense kelly green, obviously where some dye spilled and didn't get incorporated into the dough. Gross. This has nothing to do with El Castillito.", "author": "Rob C."}

I never deviated from my regiment because sometimes, routine is all a man has.  However, starving in the Castro, awaiting a friend to come for dinner from the East Bay, I needed a tidbit to sustain myself 'till then.  There were two Mexican places a block apart, however, my girlfriend I chose this because it looked more grimy.  Walking in, I could easily imagine this place on Haight Street.  It is small yet  bursting with character.  There is a jukebox in the corner where you can drop in a quarter and complement your dining experience with a personal soundtrack.  There are a couple tables and a bar that overlooks the streets so you can gawk and people watch.  Because we were eating Japanese in a couple hours, we decided to split.  In addition, due to lent, my girlfriend was going 40+ days without meat...I had to take this into consideration.  I did something I thought I would never do...I ordered a vegetarian quasidilla so we could share.  It would be a lie if I said I was not ashamed when I ordered it.  Simply put, men don't order Mexican food without meat.  However, the burrito maker did not scrutinize nor patronize me, just went about his business.  We got a quasidilla with extra sour cream and no beans and it was very big.  Taking my first bite, the quasidilla is literally a burrito except a little smaller with the tortilla placed on the grill for a couple minutes to toast it.  To be quite honest, it's taste was reminiscent of Gordos and i deduced that it was because of the salsa.  It tasted exactly the same.  I recommend the Gordos quasidilla if you want an unique spin...they fry the tortilla.  \n\nThe quasidilla was good however I cannot give a complete review until I have tried it with meat.

Ah well, lesson learned.\n\nGot the super burrito al pastor.  The meat was greasy and the rice and guacamole were not very good.  They also use cheese slices instead of shredded cheese - wtf?  Everything was just way too salty.  No acidity at all, not even in any of the salsas.  Just salt and more salt.\n\nAlso kind of expensive at over $8 for a burrito.  I'll stick to going to the taquerias in the Mission from now on.", "author": "Leslie L."}

So when my friend called me up, saying she was going to see some of her friends there and wanted to drag me along, I rolled my eyes. She didn't see it because it was over the phone, but I think she knew I was rolling my eyes anyway. Long story short, I told her that with her boyfriend, I'd at least go drop her off and hang out with her for a while before her friends showed up... and I figured I could update my Mint review with even more funny rantings.\n\nSo we walked by The Mint. It looked all ready packed with drunk-as-fuck thirty-somethings who can't carry a tune, trying to relive their youth through a horrible rendition of Madonna's \"Celebrate\" while driving around in a huge stretch Hummer limo with the words \"I'm getting married. Buy me a shot\" spraypainted on the side. All ready, my friend looked at me and her boyfriend and said, \"Let's not go in yet... let's get something to eat.\" And I couldn't agree with her more.\n\nWe were thinking about going to the Japanese place next door, but their sushi was over priced. We remembered there was a Burgermeister a couple of blocks away near Safeway. So we trek up that way, going through the empty, yet shady alley way behind Safeway. We noticed El Castillito and were like... maybe we should get burritos instead. We looked inside Burgermeister and noticed it was pretty packed... of course there was one dude taking up three seats but I won't go any further into that guy. So, burritos it was.\n\nI got the super chicken burrito, my friend the... I actually forgot what he got... whatever. Anyways, the wait in line wasn't bad... about three to five minutes. The people taking the order and making the food were cool... and quick making the burrito as well. I got some chips and some free water... the water was cool, the chips were a little stale, but totally edible. And the burrito... great. I've had better burritos (living in the Mission for almost twenty years makes it understandable) but not as of late. So I definitely appreciated the burrito I had. It might be better than La Fonda by a level... maybe.\n\nThe place looks like a hole-in-the-wall. It's not super fancy with in-style decor and furniture. And that's how I LIKE my burrito places. It was pretty cheap and pretty good, and that's all any one should ask for. Sure, there was a couple of douchebags with their $1200 fixee bicycles chained to a tree outside, but they're spreading like bacteria, and that area (along with the Mission) is the petrie dish, promoting the growth of such bact... I mean hipsters. I digress.\n\nLong story short (too late,) my friend decided not to go. Mainly because they were still getting ready (they're the stereotypical girls that take two hours to get ready to go to a crappy karaoke bar) and because she just didn't want to go to The Mint. So, leaving the Sunset for a night plus great burritos plus not having to go to The Mint minus dirty neighborhood equals 4.4 stars... rounded down to four. The math is right... I always double check my proof ;D", "author": "Chris S."}

I go straight to the back to place my order:  carne asada taco (which I thought was still a bit pricey at $2.29)... then I wanted to try something new, and the tall cook told me the different meats they had: pollo, carnitas, chorizo, and barbecue pork.  \"Barbecue pork?\" I wondered... so I said, yeah give me one of those too.\n\nI couldn't believe the amount of meat he scooped out and placed on the grill to reheat.  HELLA MEAT.  That's all that was in my mind.  HELLA MEAT.  The $2.29 pricetag per taco became unbelievably cheap for the amount of meat they give you.  I asked to eat in.  The tacos are 2 taco tortillas (I believe they were corn tortillas, which I love) plus the meats, then topped with onions (which I did not have), cilantro, and salsa (you have a choice of spicy and mild-aka-pico-de-gallo, but I asked for a little bit of both). \n\nI was extremely surprised that they have HORCHATA, so i ordered a small.  My meal came out to be $6.33.  Then the cashier asked, \"Do you want chips?\"  I said, \"Is it free?\".  He nodded.  \"SURE!\".  He scooped up corn tortilla chips and placed it on ANOTHER plastic tray lined with paper.  To the left of the cashier is a wonderful assortment of salsas, one resembling the kind they put in the taco.  There are 5 different types, and a bowl of sliced jalapenos.  It was a nice small salsa bar.\n\nI got settled to my table.... then I took a bite outta the MEATY carne asada taco.  I was speechless, but I had to say it after I finished masticating the first bite:  OH MY GOD, THIS IS SOOO GOOD.  BETTER THAN TACO TRUCKS.  \n\nI was thoroughly happy with the carne asada taco... I sipped on my Horchata and it was damn good too.  \n\nThere was this chick who ordered a special vegetarian burrito to go.

My mind is helpless as my stomach directs my mouth to order a super burrito full of that delicious marinated pork.\n\nTonight was no exception. Only this night is different than all other nights.* Until tonight I thought I knew a good al pastor burrito but El Castillito has raised the bar. The al pastor is spicy and slightly sour; this is GOOD. I had to stop mid burrito and just savor it for a minute or two. It also came with chips & various salsa options, and apparently fresh squeezed juice is available as well. And I was in and out in minutes! I really can't ask for more.\n\n* Is this appropriate in a review about pork? It seems disrespectful.", "author": "matthew r."}

Now, personally, I can't finish a whole burrito anymore, but these guys can sorely tempt you sometimes.  When me and Kat and Nick used to have Horror movie Sundays, this was our jam 110% cause its sooo good and pretty close.  Also their chips are not bad and their green salsa is pretty delicious. \n\n\nEverybody says you have to go to the Mission, but screw those people, cause its like when people tell you you gotta go to the Southern California.

First of all, there is NO REASON to go to Casa Mexicana, located a few doors down.  When I first moved to the neighborhood, I tried that place first, and the burritos there are a joke compared to the masterpieces turned out by Castillito.  I still regret the fact that I could have had one more Castillito burrito had I just avoided Casa Mexicana.   Why visit a mere casa when you can instead dine at a castle?   \n\nAnyhow,  if need be, park your car in the rear lot of Blockbuster if you want to immerse yourself into a Castillito burrito and don't want to waste time hunting for a spot.  No one ever parks in the ridiculously huge and under-utilized-suburban-anachhronistic Blockbuster lot, so take advantage.   \n\nCastillito burrito tortillas are always freshly grilled (not steamed) and the meat is also grilled, right in front of your own two eyes.  The tortillas are massive, and bear the brunt of the huge selection of toppings. The guacamole is of superior quality, as are the salsas.  The two late evening shift burrito makers, (including the always funny backwards hat and glasses guy), are basically the Simon and Garfunkel of burritomaking.

It lacks the balanced \"tang\" that still lets the sweet pork flavor come through, such as with the al pastor at Taq. Cancun or Taq. SF.\n\n2) Call me cray cray, but I don't enjoy magic-8-ball-level variability in the size of my burritos.  The quantity of meat (and other ingredients) in burritos varies substantially from visit-to-visit.  Yesterday, the burritos were gi-fucking-normous.  But two weeks ago, they were only average-sized.  \n\n3)  Rice always has a Minute-Rice (tm) flavor and texture -- it's bland and stands out in all the wrong ways. \n\n4) The great self-serve salsas lack a great sneeze-guard.  \n\n5)  Food safety-wise, there was a counter full of raw chicken parts that was a) sitting at room temp for the duration of my visit and b) seemed a little too close to the cooked food prep area.\n\nBut these concerns aside, Castillito is worth trying if you like your burritos with well-grilled tortillas and lots of melted cheese.", "author": "Steve K."}

Plus, they pretty much gave us whatever we wanted on our food (salsa, guacamole, sour cream - whatever you wanted to add).\n\nThe next thing was paying for the food. It was less than 10.00 for two quesadillas (little ones), a veggie taco (huge!) and a bean & cheese burrito (huger!). Wow, nice to eat this cheap in San Francisco once in a while! I was impressed by the price.\n\nFinally, the food actually tasted great! This is according to our slightly inebriated palates, of course. But, you know, I think I would go back and try it again!\n\nOverall, this is a very friendly, tasty and affordable place to eat. If you don't mind being a little less classy for a meal (because this is anything but glamorous dining) and you generally like taqueria food - go for it, I say! Just don't slip on that pile of rice and beans in the middle of the floor...", "author": "Jason B."}

It's worth going a little bit out of my way for a burrito from El Castillito instead of opting for the easier but ultimately less satisfying Pancho Villa fare.  There are many reasons El Castillito kicks ass.  Let me tell you a few:\n\n1. Their tortilla chips are awesome.  Some of the awesomest tortilla chips I've ever had.  Crispy but not too hard, a good amount of corn mealy-ness, and just the right touch of salt.  Even the next day, when I woke up starving and ended up eating them for breakfast, they were delicious, if a little stale.\n\n2.  They put real avocado on your burrito!  And a lot of it, too.  You can get guacamole too, but I love me some fresh avocado.\n\n3.  Perfectly soft tortilla.  Perhaps this doesn't seem to merit its own mention, but a hard or overly floury tortilla can totally ruin any burrito experience.  No worries here.\n\n4.  Fresh cilantro!  As a kid, I hated cilantro.  Whenever my mom bought salsa with cilantro, I would instate the silent treatment until she went out and bought some sans cilantro salsa.  No longer.  Now I can't get enough of the stuff.  And El Castillito is generous with this herbaceous goodness, bringing their burritos to the next level.\n\nThe carne asada was pretty good, but I'm excited to try to carnitas and pastor next time I come.

I knew something must be wrong, as who was I to question the will of the masses?\n\nSo, today, I again found myself at the corner of Church & Duboce, so I figured I'd give the place another try. This time, I eschewed the chicken in favor of a carne asada super burrito. It was a good choice, as this was an awesome burrito. It was big, and stuffed with meat, rice, beans, cheese, and all other things that one would expect in a burrito (a super burrito, nonetheless). I don't know if I just had bad luck the last time, or if the beef is just better than the chicken, but this time around, the meat was great. I donno what the guy that says the beef is really bad chicken is talking about - this was definitely beef. The fact that they grill the tortilla for longer than most other taquerias was really nice, too. Also, the burritos are cheap, especially considering the amount of stuff you get in them.\n\nMy only complaint is that the guacamole could be thicker.\n\np.s. their salsa verde is pretty good. get it.", "author": "Edward C."}

Pick a meat.  After you've fired off your order, right in front of your face the nice gentleman (and they are all very nice) grabs two spatulas full of the meat you've ordered and plops the pile on the grill.  After taking care of salsa, cheese, beans, sour cream and guacamole, the meat is then ceremoniously put on top of your open burrito, a dazzling crown, if you will, to make you drool for a few seconds until your burrito is carefully rolled and then handed to you.  For a little more than $7, which beats the prices of a few places in the mission, you get a depth charge of meat cheese and beans with all the extras without paying extra.  If you can finish the whole thing, you likely won't need another meal until night.  It isn't any wonder why I've started coming here twice a week... (I was hungry).", "author": "Steven R."}

I agree with the other reviewers that you need to know what you want already when you put in your order and that it is nice to see your meal being prepared in a clean kitchen in your presence.  Big downfall for me: paper takeout containers.  Not that I'm not for the environment, but paper containers are not conducive for transporting wet, hot mexican food.  My nachos were double-containered last night and it still leaked through both containers.  Yuck!  I know, I'm a pig.  I did eat both the fish taco meal and the nachos.

We opted for the traditional super veg burrito with black beans. I asked for avocado instead of guacamole but never got either :/. The burrito was big and perfect for sharing but there was entirely too much rice and the burrito was super bland. Maybe the rice or beans were under salted or something. The bites with cheese were tasty but the burrito overall was not well mixed, my bf had all the sour cream and I had none. I bet that avocado would have helped.

Carne asada is my usual default for a first order at a new mexican place, and I've noticed it can vary considerably from place to place, more than other types of meat.  I find it a good indicator of any given establishment's burrito methodology.\n\nThese guys do it right so it's flavorfill and satisfying, but doesn't dominate the cumulative burrito experience.  Sliced into small pieces (so it plays well with the other ingredients) and it doesnt taste too cow-ey.  They also put MELTED cheese on the tortilla, which I thinks should be SOP at any self respecting mexican joint.\n\nI also highly recommend the Al Pastor  (try it on a totra w/ refried beans, they spread it on the bread like mexican mayo - so money) and the salsa bar is solid as well.\n\nTacos were too overfilled to eat without looking like barbarian IMO.

Their chip salsas like most taquerias aren't that great, but they are always willing to dump extra jalapenos on my food and as long as you are not an ass about it are willing to take suggestions for burritos (more cilantro, no onions, fancy tomato tortilla).\n\nThis is my favorite Mexican place in the entire Bay Area ... a bold statement from someone who grew up in the Bay, but I stand by it.", "author": "Justin T."}

Making Mexican a staple in my diet was an easy task as this seemingly unique Nor-Cal cuisine transforms the tired bean and cheese into a rich concoction of Southwestern flavors leaving the usual search for \"authentic\" behind for the \"reinvented\". When it comes to San Francisco this search is brought to a new level as my rough estimates put the number of Mexican establishments at 500. Adventure also makes it's presence into this search, as anyone who has tracked the Holy Burrito knows some of these places can be seedy (like Indiana Jones putting his hand in that hole with all bugs seedy) but don't let appearances deceive you as even these visual temples of doom can yield tortilla wrapped gold. Now, this city wide search has brought me, time and time again, back to El Castillito. Let me run down my reasoning.\n\n- Terribly good service. Efficient, clean, and friendly. They even indulge my poor Spanish skills when I build up the courage to try. \n\n- Good atmosphere. Plenty of sunshine beeming through the glass storefront won't drive you to get your burrito to go. \n\n- Lastly the quality of the burrito is awfully high. A melding of the authentic (of which I base on the occasional odd vegatable, such as a carrot or radish, emerging from the burrito innards) and the reinvented (perfect amounts of guac and sour cream, choice of beans, and the occasional colored tortilla). \n\nBased on these highlights Castillito has become my neighborhood Mexican haunt (Lower Height!!!) and will continue to be a mainstay as long as I remain in the area.

I've lived in the Mission for over 5 years where there is plenty of great Mexican places but when I want absolute fulfillment, the Carnitas Regular Burrito is where I go.\r\nFirst, they GRILL the tortilla (rather than steam) so that it is not soggy. Second they grill up the carnitas with a little oil until they are golden brown. The little bits of crunchy meat are absolute perfection! I have seen other reviews that complain about occasional chunks of pork fat in the mix. Yup, that happens occasionally. This is Mexican food, not the Boulevard. Finally, they throw in chips at no charge and the salsa bar is the tops! If you like it mild, go for the diced tomato and onion, every other selection is spicy!!\r\nAt this point I've had at least 20 burritos here as well as a smattering of the other dishes. I've never been unhappy. Fair warning: don't expect to have your hand held when it comes time to order. Know what you want before you walk up and bark it out clearly!

It was better than good.  It was better than great!  It was like all my wants and needs in life were consolidated into one thing: This holy grail of burritos!  My one concern is that we don't have more Castillitos in the world.  I would argue that if the West Bank, Baghdad, or the Kashmir region of India/Pakistan had Castillitos, they would be a much safer and happier place.  BTW, don't go to the Lions Pub in Pac Heights!

Walked into an empty restaurant around 10:30.  Proceeded to counter-register to place my order.  The cooks, cashier & manager were all looking and ignoring me before the cashier lady finally told me to just order with the cooks.  Bespectacled cashier lady then proceeds to passionately argue with me for what seemed about 5 minutes over the coupon, claiming that it wasn't valid for my breakfast order of huevos rancheros.   Owner-manager finally assured her that the coupon was valid for the order.  Damn, is the dollar coming out of your own pocket lady?  I took the order to go and set it aside for awhile.  When I got to it, it was a congealed mess of a plate, but still edible I guessed.  I've had much better huevos before.  I didn't care for their refried beans, which were off-color, watery and generally milky in taste & texture.  Reasoning that serving breakfast isn't their specialty.

Even now, when I don't live in the Lower Haight, I'll still ride my bike over here, grab a burrito and sit and watch the dogs play in Duboce Park.\n   It should be said that I only get one thing here (since they do it so well I rarely change my order). A Carnitas (just a little crispy) burrito on a tomato tortilla, with cilantro, salsa, and enchilada sauce.  I'd been going to this spot for over 2 years with roughly the same handful of guys making my burrito, when they finally admitted to me that it was a good combination.  \n  It's a small place and you order from two guys who are making everything right there in a little-ass window, but they crank out superb food day after day, and believe me it's totally worth it.  \n  One thing to be mentioned is they raised their prices recently from $5 to $6 something for a burrito.  Now I know some of you don't like change and this was a great spot for a $5 burrito, but seriously, $6 ain't that much.

The last few times I ate there I had this horrible taste in my mouth after that I had to somehow mask with gum/chocolate/whatever so I wouldn't throw up. 3 stars cuz they used to be good, and I'll probably go there again at some point but only during dinner times when the grills are hot and the ingredients are more fresh.", "author": "Dave R."}

One day, successful young professional commuting downtown to the Financial District, the next...a broken-down homeless man, destitute and broke, having blown all savings on Super carne asada burritos, now reduced to begging for Castillito scraps and spare chips...the place is just that good.\nI dig everything about this establishment.  The gentlemen you order from at the grill are hilarious, come here late night for an entertaining show.  When they're dishing up the finishing touches on your burrito they like to mix it up:\n\"Onions?...Guacamole?...Salsa?...Fresh mar-e-juana? (cilantro)...\"\nThat's usually after one of the cooks performs his deadpan angry alley-cat hiss that always turns heads.\nThey grill all your meat right there in front of you so that your burrito is piping hot and the meat is juicy and delicious.  Their burrito construction is impeccable and quick and the ingredients are always evenly dispersed. \nA super carne asada burrito with tax runs $7.04, chips and fresh salsa from the salsa bar are on the house.\nMy only complaint is that they have a breakfast burrito and it has absolutely NO redeeming qualities.  It contains 3 things: tortilla, eggs and chorizo.  No cheese?  No NADA?! I was not pleased, because I love breakfast burritos...\nThe staff is very friendly and funny, I come here by myself and am always entertained while I eat by their banter with each other/customers/street vendors/homeless people.  \nCastillito makes me wish I hadn't given up on Spanish class so I could join in on their conversations with customers and each other...if you don't want to make the trip to the Mission, or if you live in the triangle like me, come here and get your fix!

Call me picky, but I can reheat my own food at home for a lot less money.\nThe wet burrito was a total disappointment, in fact, calling it a soaking wet burrito would have been more appropriate.  This beast was dripping with sauce, salsa and mushy guacamole that dominated any other flavors.\nWhile I thought the carne asada in my BF's all-meat burrito was infinitely tastier than the chicken I had, it still wasn't superb.  All their meat is pre-chopped and then reheated on the grill.  So much for freshness.  I did appreciate the way the tortilla was crisped up on his burrito, but that was the only thing that really stood out to me.\nOverall, I would be hard pressed to go to El Castillito again, with the abundance of taquerias in the city I'm pretty sure I can get more bang for my buck somewhere else.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

Now I'm not so sure seeing as how my last experience there was in '02.  But I have very fond memories of choosing between eating out or buying groceries from the Safeway across the street.  Castillito's awesome prices could be said to have tipped the scales in its favor in those moments of uncertainty.  Well, that and my stomach growling at my standing at the J stop.  Be forewarned: I recall their veggie burritos being on the massive side.", "author": "Quilty K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-23", "description": "There is no better better burrito in the city than El Castillito's Pastor Super Burrito. I grew up in San Diego where the carne asada reigns king, here in San Francsico I have yet to find anything even remotely close... I'm sorry, but a burrito should not have beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, five girls dancing to the sound of la cucaracha, and a bucket of sour creme inside.  A burrito should be meat.  And well marinated delicious meat at that... but this is San Francisco and I realize that things are done a bit differently here... At least the Super Al Pastor allows me to forget for a while what it is that I am missing.  The guys who make the burritos are hillarious and always down for a little banter back and forth.  The tortas are good, as are the tacos and quesadillas but go for the super al pastor and get the fresh avacado instead of the guacamole.  Oh, and ask for extra mota (cillantro, hillarious)....", "author": "Darren R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-06", "description": "On a rainy Sunday (which could basically be any Sunday in '08) a friend and I were craving a mean burrito. This city has a plethora of culinary options but being from SoCal if there is one thing I miss it is easily accessible quality Mexican food. Sure, I have followed the tractor beam to the mission and plowed through La Taqueria and El Farolito but I prefer my burrito runs sans stabbings. Sorry, maybe that was a punch after the bell towards the Mish, I do have love for the Mish but getting there to eat is always a struggle. Unfortunately the Mexican joints close to where I live and work think authentic means turning up Richie Valens greatest hits on the jukebox. After searching through the yelp annals I came upon El Castillo. Still infant enough in it's reviews that I didn't feel like I was reading War in Peace and everyone across the board seemed to enjoy their burritos . . .perfect. Someone described the neighborhood as the loin but I would say more Castro. With Safeway parking across the street and street parking I was already in a good mood. The moment I glanced at the menu I knew the Supper Burrito was where it was at. If there is a better designed entre than the burrito please let me know because this foil wrapped flavor bomb gets incrementally better with each bite. With gravity on its side all the flavor has a mosh pit at the bottom of your burrito, nothing but taste overload can result from this.", "author": "Chad B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2005-07-08", "description": "\"MMM, mmm, good.\"  Is really all I can say about this worthy of the mission mexican joint.  They serve their stuff up kind of subway style -\"cilantro, onion, sour cream, avocado, hot salsa?\" so you can pick and choose your ingredients.  They have spinach and whole wheat tortillas (+ regular kind).  I have only tried the burritos because they make me so happy but I would bet the rest of the menu is delicious.  Furthermore - there is one chef that illustrates the contents of your burrito on the tin foil wrapping (I got a little chicken) - nice touch!", "author": "Lauren S."}

Now I'm a big guy and I couldn't finish it - was wishing I could tho it was so good.  I've been going back since.  I used to head to that neck of the woods to stop by Burgermeister and although I love Burgermeister for half the price I get a killer burrito or quesadilla at El Castillito.
