Candle lit and cozy- perfect for a date. He said the kale salad was the best around. I was pretty hesitant because your girl LOVES kale salad and I can make a pretty mean one. The kale salad arrived and it was... the best kale salad around. It was so good, so fresh, and so crisp! Enough dressing on it to tax out that kale bitterness but also not swimming in dressing- the perfect balance that's hard to achieve.

I was drinking champagne and my boyfriend was drinking a specialty cocktail with milk in it, which was wild and delicious and our bill was hefty. Hefty my friends. Anyways, this joint really has no outlets I just have to make note of. We were relying on Uber and Yelp to get us from place to place as we had never been in this city before and had absolutely no idea how to get from place to place so when my phone died I would just plug it in to whatever bar or restaurant we were at in the moment but literally nothing. So, the super awesome bartender was more than happy to take my phone for me and plug it in behind the bar, which I thought was awesome. They had an upstairs loft type area and there happened to be a private party going on up there so we didn't explore but I could tell from below that it was cool. They share a bathroom with the business next door and while the place was super busy, the bartenders were pretty attentive and working their butts off back there. This was the day of the Folsom Street Fair (don't even know if I'm saying that right, first timers remembers) and so the place was packed out. They let you bring your dogs in here! I mean, Trick Dog, right? But I was perfectly content petting this dog and drinking my Champagne. If you're into craft cocktails with a super cool lounge vibe, come here!", "author": "Samantha S."}

Trick Dog really amped up my standards as to what a bar should really be.\n\nThe first time I came to Trick Dog, I was a bit weary of it. Came here on a whim based on a recommendation of the person I was with at the time, and let me just tell you- do not let the weird-ish location stray you away from going here!\n\nTrick Dog is located in a quite strange location, somewhere in between Potrero Hill and the Mission. Finding Trick Dog can be extremely confusing as well since there is no signage whatsoever as to where it is, but once you are inside, be ready for your world to be elevated!\n\nOf the three times that I've gone here, two have been on a Friday, and the other day has been on a Saturday, service, drinks, and food have always been impeccable. If you are only looking to get drinks, I would strongly advise you to arrive early as these past times that I have gone, it has been near impossible to be able to find a place to sit, and it gets pretty crowded to even stand as the night progresses. Do note that if you wish to eat, there is an upstairs section where you can sit, and which rarely has a wait :)\n\nThe allure of Trick Dog for me not only lies in how inventive they are when it comes to their drinks, but also how well executed their drinks are. The first and second times that I went, they had a \"Trick Dog Airways\" cocktail menu, which included drinks which were inspired from all over the world! I had a chance to try the GDL, the YQG, and the SYD. The most recent time that I went, Trick Dog had a \"Joy of Cooking\" menu, and I ordered the Liloliho Yacht Club. Each of the drinks that I have tried at Trick Dog have been so diverse, but so amazing in their own way! Although drinks can get a bit pricy here (average $15 per cocktail), it is clearly worth it once you take the first sip of your drink. \n\nI have also had the pleasure of eating at Trick Dog with one of my close friends, and we ordered their kale salad, their Baja fish tacos, and their French fries. Let me just tell you, their kale salad is what dreams are made of! I did not have a chance to try the Baja fish tacos or the French fries, but my friend was highly satisfied.\n\nPSA- I'm not sure if Trick Dog always does this, but for their \"Joy of Cooking\" cocktail menu, they partnered with La Cocina SF (a non-profit in the Mission District whose mission is to cultivate low income food entrepreneurs), and are helping them raise funds. I truly love all that Trick Dog is about!", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

They change their drinks every 6 months or so and each iteration has cool and novel ingredients. Think peanut butter, peppercorn, green pepper, and malted milk. The magic is that they somehow layer the taste profile in such a way that you taste the flavor of the hard liquor in the cocktail but instead of the bite of alcohol later on, you get the flavor one of the ingredients. You can say that is the art of cocktail mixing, yet, Trick Dog does this at a very high level. Just watch the bartenders to appreciate this. \n\nThen, there are the cocktail menus. They change their menus with their drinks and each menu has a theme. It was alien sightings a few years ago (each cocktail was named after aliens), then it was presidential campaign pins, then San Francisco murals. The amount of thinking that goes into the naming of drinks and menus is impressive. \n\nThe venue is spacious but minimally decorated.

Not the case here. We dealt with three different bartenders that were incredibly friendly, and happy to talk with us. \n\nI decided on the Frantic Frog since it had my liquor of choice... whiskey.

For some reason I was expecting it to be bigger with more seating, but it was a fairly small space with limited seating along one side of the wall. The crowd also meant it was hard to hear ourselves unless we shouted to each other, which made conversation difficult. There is a small area upstairs with tables, but when my friends and I tried to head up to order some small plates to share, we were told that you had to order more substantial food in order to sit up there. The upstairs was super empty except for one group that had just gotten seated, so that seemed like a bit of a waste to me.\n\nIt took a while, but finally we were able to grab a menu from the bar and peruse it. Right now their menu looks like a children's book which made it fun to flip through and look at the illustrations. There were a couple options that sounded promising, but I ended up going with the Broomstick Backlog, which is Tanqueray gin, Suze, apricot, white miso, lime, and Kimino yuzu soda. All cocktails are $14.\n\nEverything in the drink sounded absolutely delicious except for the Suze which I had never heard of, so I was surprised and disappointed when the cocktail turned out to be much more bitter than I had expected. I'm slowly coming to realize that my taste buds are more attuned to bitter tastes in food than the average person, so the bitter flavors in this drink drowned out the sweetness of the other delicious sounding ingredients.

Thus, the wait for a refill was always minimal. \n\nAfter perusing the awesome children's book style drink menu, I started the evening with a slew of mixed drinks. I typically don't order too many mixed drinks but the cocktails looked mightily appealing and the bartenders appeared to be the mixologist type. The Frantic Frog, Bolshevik Blog and the Jurassic Fog were the drinks I opted for and they were all very tasty. My fave would be the Frantic Frog since I prefer whiskeys but nothing to take away from my second fave of the three, the very refreshing Jurassic Fog. All drinks weren't overly sweet nor overly spirit-forward. Just perfectly balanced. \n\nAs hunger started to trickle in, I was already at the bar so there was no need to get a table upstairs. I tried the Manimal-style fries, Chicken Tricknuggets and the Kale Salad. Hands down they were all exceedingly tasty. As the food came out I switched up my drinks to whiskey neat (unfortunately, not on the highest floor of the Bowery). They have a great selection of spirits and especially whiskeys so I was very pleased. \n\nTrick Dog is located in the outer Mission area so it embodies that local feel.

Their cocktails are exquisite with a balanced blend of flavors and the right amount of alcohol.  Their cocktail menu themes are brilliant!  The latest two themes (Election and the Mural Project) displayed modern creativity with a sense of amusement and community.  Trick Dog is masterful in keeping their customers interested with unique and inspired concoctions.  Some of my favorites were Drill Baby Drill (Wild Turkey rye with a kick and a nice large ice cube), and another Election themed drink...Didn't Inhale (a bittersweet Japanese whiskey blend).  More recently, the Vogue has caught my tongue for a refreshing starter, and I usually end the evening with their strong Strider.     \n\nTwo.  \nBar food for any mood.  Whether you're drunk, almost drunk, or just plain hungry ...any of their \"upscale bar snacks\" on their food menu can satisfy any kind of drinker, or non-drinker. \n With a crunchiness that's second to none, their thrice-cooked fries are a must here!  Plain or loaded Manimal style (cheese, scallions & sauce), these fries are perfect for any day ...not just FRYdays!  Another dish that's great for sharing would be their Kale salad.  This refreshing dish is piled high, very high with just the right amount of flavor throughout.  Their Trick Dog and Chicken Tricknuggets aren't your ordinary hot dog and chicken nuggets.  The quality of these \"tricked out\" dishes is obvious in every bite.  \nQuick tip: They don't serve food when they open at 3 pm.  The food menu is available after 5 pm.\n\nThree.\nThe music.  Love that old school 70s-80s vibe!  And some early 90s R&B too!\n\nFour.  \nBaby and dog-friendly. On some of my daytime visits (4-6 pm), I've noticed a few pups chillin under the tables and around corners.  I've also noticed a few toddlers lounging around, with their parents of course.  The music and semi-loud atmosphere can sometimes be calming ...for everyone! \n\nFive.  \nService with a smile.  Never had complaints about service here.  Staff is extremely nice and very efficient, even on busy nights.  Not only are drinks perfectly executed behind the bar, but the delivery is flawless.  \n\n\nThere you have it.  Five stars for one of my favorite bars!", "author": "Bobby L."}

The bouncer's gorgeous husky greeting patrons outside the door didn't hurt either. \n\nAll cocktails were priced at $13 (a little pricey but I think the quality justifies it). I tried the Mel Waters (Bulleit rye, blueberry bitter aperitivo, madeira, black pepper, rose hip) and my partner tried the Jeremy Fish (rum, chai liqueur, dry vermouth, Luxardo Bianco bitter, acid phosphate, mango bitters). Both were very complex and well-though-out drinks, and I'll probably never encounter a similar cocktail at any other bar.

The drink menu is adorable. It's like a children's storybook with descriptions of the drinks accompanied by illustrations. One of my biggest struggles with \"craft cocktail\" bars is that I either don't know what's in the drink or what the final flavors will be based on the ingredients. Honestly, I can't always predict what the concoctions will taste like.

Thanks, but your menu-cum-children's book just ain't my thing.\" Well, I was goddamn wrong. Trick Dog is a very well-executed drinking and eating experience from the moment you walk in to your last slug of booze.\n\nWe arrived around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday night. The place was packed with beautiful, well-dressed young people who seemed much more Financial District or tech bro than I expected. But the riff-raff cleared out pretty quickly, and by 7:30 pm there were more seats at the bar, and the population density was very manageable.\n\nThe bartenders were all perfect 10 professionals: Super-attentive, engaging, and blessed with bionic hearing. Our first orders were taken by a bartender who was already working on a long row of drinks. But he made eye contact almost instantly from six feet away, handed us the children's book menu, and then somehow heard our orders over the 6:30 pm din. Trick Dog's acoustics may be misleading. It does indeed seem loud, but I never had trouble hearing direct conversation.\n\nSo, the drinks. We started with Lunatic Bog (rye, Cynar, oloroso sherry, milk chocolate and green peppercorn, served up) and Hick Dialogue (bourbon, ginger-pinot noir vermouth, Luxardo liqueur, and a \"peanut butter & jelly sandwich\" garnish, served up). \n\nThe ingredients: WTF?! The results: sublime. Someone put some crazy F'ing attention into these recipes, and the results validate Trick Dog's stellar reputation. That PB&J garnish was an amazing addition: You could smell the peanut butter when you put glass to mouth, adding an extra dimension to the sip of cocktail. Really, super F'ing impressed.\n\nSecond order: Frantic Frog (a bourbon drink with Fernet Branca, some mint jelly and green strawberry, served with a jumbo ice cube) and Broomstick Backlog (gin, with Suze, apricot, white miso, lime, and yuzu soda, served long). These two were a bit less \"showy\" in terms of taste profile, but once again: very good, very deliberate, very special. \n\nI basically wanted to drink the entire menu. \n\nFor food we had Chicken Tricknuggets, Kale Salad and the Trick Dog -- a hamburger served on a hot dog bun. The salad was ridiculously large, the nuggets were tasty, and the Trick Dog was really, really F'ing good. \n\nBottom line: I'm a jaded, judgey, misanthropic San Franciscan. Didn't want to love Trick Dog as much as I did. But, damn, the cocktail creativity and super-friendly bartenders really deserve special kudos.", "author": "Jon P."}

These guys that time to build each drink and the fun part of a cocktail for me is the different balance of flavors in your drink. Of course most cocktails tend to sneak up on you so space your drink with food/water unless you are looking for the other side. I ended up trying the rum based Octavia. I really like the balance and the touch of basil and pepper. Trick Dog was actually not packed nor did it have a line on Sundays so if you're just looking to try some of their cocktails Sunday is a decent option.

The only vegan-friendly options were Brussels sprouts and some pretentiously named Frito-containing-chili (without cheese). I am on a pseudo-elimination diet and (TMI) didn't want to deal with gas after sprout or beans, so I asked for a side of avocado and a side of bread. Both ingredients are on the menu, just not together. I was informed the chefs don't make off menu items, so I asked for plain kale (since their salad has no other vegan friendly ingredients). When our server came back to the table, she said I could do salad with the animal-ingredient-laden dressing, but couldn't have plain kale. What kind of place doesn't allow for someone to order salad without dressing? It's 2018, and food preferences and allergies have never been more prominent. I let our server know I was no longer hungry... The other vegan at our table ordered the pretentiously named Frito-chili. Ten minutes later, arrived to the table in a Frito bag. I would expect the same plating from a food truck.\n\nService: Super awkward. I walked upstairs and sat down at the table as my friends made their way through the bar and climbed up the staircase. The server who was MIA during my venture upstairs reappeared about a minute after I sat down at a table to ask me if I was expecting 4 other people, since I was alone at the largest table.

This was the best of the three. \n\n2. The second was something Mezcal based, served neat with Cocchi Americano and several other wines or liqueurs. These ingredients didn't really compliment each other, it tasted like a cocktail made from picking five bottles from the bar at random. It was mildly unpleasant but not offensively bad. \n\n3. The final drink was bourbon based with some mint jelly, served over a large ice cube. This is the drink that earned Trick Dog it's one star review. It tasted like someone dumped an entire bottle of generic brand creme de menthe syrup into my cup. I would rather get drunk off winter-mint mouthwash. There was apparently some strawberry flavored something in the drink as well, but I couldn't taste that or even the bourbon, because the terrible mint flavor overpowered everything.

It helped that we got there before 5pm and was a smaller group. \n\nWe opted to share the Pina Colada that is served in a pineapple! It is a very well balanced drink, not too sweet, good boozy kick, mellowed out by the green tea and pineapple juice. Also was able to try the Moon Landing and Reptilian Elite drink. The Mood Landing drink looked like the moon and reminded me of a modern interpretation of a martini. As for the reptilian, it was a very refreshing drink. \n\nThe novelty of the rotating menu themes is compelling and truly a unique presentation that I can see why it keeps people coming back.\n\nI would like to come back to have dinner in their upstairs area.\n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nI would return back to Trick Dog but I would not be willing to wait hours to do so", "author": "Eddie W."}

I live conveniently 3 blocks from here aka drunk walking home distance. So shhhh keep it on the DL I like it on the emptier side ;) \n\nBut in all seriousness this is a great joint and def check it out! I know most of the bartenders by name - they hired a few new females which is great - but my favorite guy by far is MARK! \n\nMark is THE MAN. He makes quite possibly the best drinks in all of SF (I also like Chambers and Bourbon & Branch) and I always start with the Greg Galinsky. It's my all time favorite drink in SF and I've probably ordered 10 of them at least because it's just that good! Gin, herbally, citrusy, and not to sweet or tart. It's my kinda first cocktail of the night. (Erm and sometimes all my cocktails for the night especially if Mark is making them!!)\n\nMark can make you anything your heart desires, be you man or woman or any [person]man, as in he can customize any of the drinks or he can even do a bartender's choice kinda cocktail. He's also very sweet and pours generously ;) I feel a little bad but when Mark's behind the bar I wait for Mark and only tip Mark...sorry I'm a loyal drinker. \n\nFinally, their drink menu changes quarterly (I think) and they partner with local nonprofits. SO RAD. Right now they're partnering with Precita Eyes (down the street on 24th) and the Mission Mural Project so all their drinks are inspired by new, local murals! Their menu is always a nice, bound book and makes a great coffee table book. It's a part of my rotation of coffee table books about alcohol (another one of the books in that rotation is a scratch n sniff book on learning how to drink wine). \n\nAnyways...tldr go to this bar and drink lots!!

It's actually quite large with a second floor where mostly people were dining. Downstairs we crowded around the bar. \nThe drink menu goes great with the theme and a super plus for those conspiracy theorists. It was a bit crowded for a Wednesday night, but service did not falter. After taking a while to decide on drinks, we placed our orders and chatted with the bar tender. We were asking about the name and the crazy characters and our bartender actually went and grabbed one of the coin banks to show us how the bar got its name. The dog actually does tricks to shoot the coin into the bank!\nOur drinks were made in front of us and it was such a masterpiece. Carefully concocted with great attention to detail.

The new menus are calendars you can actually buy and the proceeds go to Muttville Senior Dog Rescue and Northern California Family Dog Rescue.  Kudos to Trick Dog for being both creative and charitable.  I stopped by a couple of times to try out the new menu items and few old classic food items as well.\n\n2016 Calendar Menu -- http://bit.ly/1HuVQSI\n\nAs usual, the drinks are truly the star attractions.  While they were all pretty good, the most ambitious one I tried was the JULY cocktail.  Mainly because it came garnished with sharp cheddar cheese.  It was a pretty strong drink, but it wasn't until I took a bite of the sharp cheddar that it countered the bitterness of the drink and made it actually pretty enjoyable.  Very clever.  One more drink to note which unfortunately I don't have a pic of is their Scoobysnack shot.  It's a very safe and fruity shot to drink because it's like you're shooting down a liquified Jolly Rancher.\n\nJULY and JUNE cocktails -- http://bit.ly/1Iq98no\nJUNE -- Junipero Gin, Trick Dog Cup (apple, cucumber, tea, hibiscus, fig), Dolin rouge vermouth, Bitter Lemon soda \nJULY -- Fighting Cock bourbon, Amaro Lucano, blackberry, Shiraz, Dale's Pale Ale, chipotle, lemon, sharp cheddar\n\nLike before, their drink menu also includes some refreshing mocktails if you don't want to get buzzed.\n\nSummer School  -- http://bit.ly/1T9OTx6\n(without proof) papaya, honey, rice, iced tea, key lime\n\nSki Week -- http://bit.ly/1IRGm0p\n(without proof) Trick Dog Cup (apple, cucumber, tea, hibiscus, fig), bitter lemon soda, lemon\n\nThe food menu has been changed up again with returning favorites like their famous Trick Dog Burger, Chicken TrickNuggets, Manimal Fries, and Kale Salad, but also a bunch a new items like their Citrus Braised Pork Tacos and Manhattan Sausage.\n\nUpdated Food Menu in Calendar -- http://bit.ly/1DuyxxJ\n\nKale Salad -- http://bit.ly/1EcLOpk\navocado, parmesan, pepitos, slow-cooked egg yolk dressing\n\nCitrus Braised Pork Tacos -- http://bit.ly/1Pa3tEC\npickeled pineapple pico de gallo, radishes, epazote, cumin\n\nManhattan Sausage -- http://bit.ly/1eWU5H4\nPork belly, cherry mostarda, Old Grand Dad bourbon, johnnycake\n\nThis was my first time trying their Kale Salad and it was a little overwhelming when they brought it to our table.  A huge mountain of kale!  It made for a good side dish to split or for a great veggie meal if you're dining solo.  I'd say out of the new menu items that I've tried, the one to get is the Manhattan Sausage.  It's so good and goes well with the provided johnnycakes.  Some might not care for the cherrry mostarda as they might not like the sweet and savory mashup, but for me it works great.  The Tacos were good too, but personally I'd rather have another Trick Dog instead.  I had another Trick Dog recently and it's still a very tasty burger to go well with their cocktails.\n\nTrick Dog still amazes me with their creative menus, crafty cocktails, and delicious food.  What will they come up with next?  Well whatever they will come up with, you'll know I'll be back again to let you guys know since it's one of my favorite bars in SF.", "author": "Rodney H."}

I am so happy a friend of mine introduced me to this local bar/restaurant!\n\nWell known for their delicious drinks this place can get crowded! When I first walked up, first thing I heard was the loud noise coming from the bar. Walking in, I was surprised to see so many people. We walked up to the bar and asked for a cocktail menu. The cocktail menu is a uniquely created as an election themed menu where the menu has all the specialty cocktails listed on buttons that is pinned to a big board. What a great creative idea! The buttons also are detailed on not only the name of the drink but also what's in the drink. My friend and I both ordered 2 separate drinks equally 4 different drinks in total and all of them were deliciously good! OMG! Yes, I have to admit the drinks were pricey ($13.00), you do the math. I have to say though, it was totally worth it!\n\nDRINKS: We ordered:\n-I Am Not a Crook\n-Romanism & Rebellion\n-I like Ike\n-Morning in America\n\nOnce I noticed that there was a upstairs dining area I immediately told my friend we should make our way upstairs. Once we did so, we noticed that the upstairs was a small dining area of no more then 9-10 tables. And it was pretty empty when we arrived at around 7PM. Dinner menu is located on the tables under the plate. It's a small food option but they have great food!!\n\nFor food we ordered:\n\n-Chicken Tricknuggets (10/10) I love that it comes with 3 different sauces making it more interesting and not boring eating the same sauce as we ordered 13 pieces. \n-Manimal Style Fries-(7/10) Very unique and tasted really good. Next time I would order it without the Charred Scallions, after a while the taste was too much for me.\nShrimp Roll- (6/10) Way different from how I imagined it was going to come out. Overall it was good but wouldn't be something I go out of my way to order again. \n\nSERVICE: The service once we made our way to the top of the dining area was good. We had the honor of having the bartender Johvanna. She was good although it took a while for her to crack a smile for us. She came around frequently to check up on our table and what really impressed me was when I had ordered my drinks at the beginning and told her I wanted my 2nd drink about 10 minutes after. 10 minutes came around and my 1st glass was empty. I was starting to get worried that she forgot about me and once I started thinking the worse, she came up to the table with my cocktail! She totally impressed me, especially since she had all the other tables to maintain. There was another server who had such a great personality and positive attitude! His name was Clause. He came around and delivered our food from time to time and I also heard him apologize to other tables for the long wait of food. What great hospitality!\n\nOverall, Trick dog totally earns 4 stars! Not only are their drinks great and unique but the food was good as well and it's such a great hang out spot next to the mission! I would have never heard about this place if it wasn't for my good foodie friend but I am happy I was introduced!\n\nUntil next time Trick Dog!\n\nREVIEW 122/196", "author": "Porsche C."}

She always has the lowdown on the cool new bars serving up great drinks, bringing the a-game with the atmosphere, and Trick Dog didn't disappoint.\n\nPulling up to the bar, I felt like we were headed to a house party. Trick Dog is situated on a picture perfect SF suburban street lined with multi story townhomes, and the bar itself is inside one of them. Long and narrow, the main bar area feels like a grate room with extremely high ceilings and a bar that runs the length of the space. Upstairs there are tables and seating for the dining crowd too. The only drawback to the design is it can get a little loud when it's full of people enjoying their drinks. But the crowning design achievement of this bar is the bar shelving itself! Shelves housing a large spirit selection slide hiding some and revealing more! It's fun to watch the staff work and see what they uncover!\n\nAs for the drinks, let's start with the menu. They have a simple menu of single spirit drinks. like Gin and Dry Cucumber Soda, but what you want to find are the cute doggie calendars sitting around! Yes, they are actually calendars but they're also menus with a drink named for each month that you can order by name!  Be prepared, these drinks are super crafty, and made with lots of ingredients I have never seen, which just means a great opportunity to learn! I ordered the November, a bourbon drink I know I enjoyed but seriously and sadly cannot describe! Oh yeah, apparently sherry is in these days too, and their menu offers a lot of it, both by the glass and in drinks. But no matter what your preference, their staff is helpful and happy to guide you to the right selection.\n\nCheck em out and let me know which month is your favorite!", "author": "Michael T."}

I was so impressed by the creativity.\n\nWe ordered from all over the drink menu, and the bartender was a machine, cranking out these really complex drinks with all kinds of little tinctures and herbs and edible spray paint and the like in them...I got a \"Reptilian Elite,\" a citrusy gin drink, which was pretty good, though probably not the best $13 cocktail I've ever had.\n\nOne of my pals, who had been there before and knew the deal, ordered a pina colada, which took some poor bastard about 20 minutes to make, and probably not because he was being lazy but rather because the thing is huge and served inside a pineapple. It cost $30, I think; my friend graciously let each of us have a little sip, and holy mackerel, it was perfect. (If you like pina coladas. And getting caught in the rain. And blah blah blah.)\n\nOn the whole, it was good to dip my toe in here, but I don't suppose I'll return for a swim. Sure I gave it 4 stars, but I'm getting too old and boring for crowded, expensive, ultra-hip places like this. I'm pretty sure my drink was far cooler and more interesting than I'll ever be. It's weird to look down at your drink and get the feeling that you're cramping its style. \"You'd rather be with someone else,\" you mumble. \"Don't say that,\" it replies, even as it eyes a 20-something game designer who makes seven figures and wears pajama bottoms to work.

I guess God really did have mercy on me.\n\nThe Bon Vivants group live up to the definition of their name: persons who are sociable and enjoy a luxurious lifestyle. While the bar itself is casual and not the least bit luxurious as their group name suggests, you come to Trick Dog to socialize, eat, drink and be merry. The bar area has that friendly feel where you can easily strike up a conversation with your bartender. Or the person next to you who's been eyeing your Thrice cooked french fries. (guard it with your life if you ordered it manimal style!)\n\nBeing a mighty competitor in the James Beard awards, Trick Dog constantly strives to become better each year. The cocktail menu gets a complete overhaul every 6 months and they're known for having a theme each time they make a switch. We went in here for the 2016 calendar cocktails (and if you bought the calendar, part of the proceeds go to SF SPCA) These guys are absolutely talented and wholly creative. Who would've thought to put ingredients like sunflower seeds, sandalwood and sharp cheddar in cocktails? It sounds weird, but it works at Trick Dog. I love the spicy-fruity contrasts of the March cocktail: Diplomatico white rum, Ancho chile liqueur, strawberry, lime and Campari.  My guy friends tend to go more for the brown sugar so November is perfect for them. It had Old Forrester Bourbon, pear & pecan vermouth and Mandarin Napoleon. For those who love chocolate and booze, the August cocktail has a malted milk ball garnish. Interestingly enough, this cocktail is made with Tequila Ocho Reposado which plays well with Amaro and Fino sherry. It's a boozy cocktail so don't be fooled by the small goblet. \n\nThe bar centric food served in their upstairs restaurant is really, really good. I can't believe I'm raving about something non-fried and non-fattening, but the mountainous kale salad with slow cooked egg yolk parmesan dressing is absolutely delicious! After all, we do need to get our greens in ;-) Follow that with their meaty housemade sausage with pancakes, chicken trick nuggets and of course, MORE fries.\n\nYou've won me over the moment I sat down at that bar stool.

It can get crowded though so beware of that.\n\nWhat makes this place stand out though is their innovative cocktails. They offer artisan cocktails that have been unparalleled in their peculiarity and also great taste.

I still remember the beginning very vividly: two fantastic drinks from their ever-changing themed menu, amazingly delicious Manimal style fries, and tasty chicken \"trick\"nuggets with equally tasty dipping sauces, including one very nasal-clearing Chinese mustard, all amidst an incredibly loud and packed bar.\n\nThe rest of the night? A little fuzzier. Apparently two additional drinks were imbibed, some women were talked to, and more food was had, as the three of us ended up spending about $70 each. Oh... snap.\n\nAs for the venue itself - aside from it being insanely packed - it also had two separate levels, with the lower/main level being the one with the bar, and, well, most of the people.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - So, this is a tough one. If the place wasn't busy, then it'd be rather spacious, but as is usually the case (on a Friday night at least), according to the bartenders, the place is super packed, so getting around is definitely not an easy feat. There's a lower wheelchair accessible part of the bar near the front entrance though, and the bouncer was kind enough to clear people out of the way for us. After that, movement was avoided as much as possible.\n\nBathroom - These are all the way in the very back, which would normally pose a problem, given the crowds, but they happen to be shared with Central Kitchen, so you only have to fight through a FEW people, back through the front entrance, and go around through the restaurant into the restrooms, which I believe were completely accessible.", "author": "Johnny W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-03-07", "description": "I hate to give this place a low rating, because I really did like the food there, and the kale salad is probably going to be my go-to method of preparing kale from now, on but a combination of an extremely hot room, horrible service, and high prices make me have to give this place a two star rating.\n\nParking: The parking at this location is actually not as bad as you would think it would be. It's located on the less crowded side of the mission distract, so ti's pretty possible to find parking spots on the street side.\n\nAtmosphere/restaurant: the actual restaurant/bar itself is kind of weird. I don't think there actually was a sign for the establishment out front, but that gave it kind of a \"speakeasy\" feel to it. That being said, it was super confusing, and we catually had to resort to asking a patron near the entrance of the bar if it was the right place. I get the whole theme, but when it ends up being an inconvenience, I definltey think something different should be done. Also, the loft on the second floor that is used for a dining area was extremely stuffy and crowded. I get that it might a cocktail bar before a restaurant, but the least you can do is turn on some kind of AC for the 20+ people stuck up there. The tables were way too close together and it was burning hot, it was also extremely dark.\n\nFood: The food itself was overall very good. They had a very limited menu(which we found out was changed every 6 months actually).  Some definite recommendations I have are probably the kale salad and the thrice-fried fries. The fries were very crispy, and although I usually hate thicker fries, I really  did love them. \n\nSome things I would definitely say to stay away from are some of their weirder drinks. I got the Trick Dog Root beer and really was pretty  much surprised by how bad it could be. I didn't epect anything super amazing, but it just tasted so weird, it was hard to believe it was an $8 drink.\n\nService: Probably the worst part, and one of the biggest part of eating at restaurants for me  was the service here.  Not only did our server take forever to get anything done, I feel like we ended up sitting down for 2 hours and some change although the meal was only for 4. She also seemed like she was really angry/pissed to have to deal with the very basic things that we  were asking.", "author": "Andrew T."}

There isn't a bar out there quite like Trick Dog's! \n\nEvery couple months they come out with a new theme/idea/concept. Previous concepts have included vinyl records, Zodiac signs, a San Francisco tourist map and finally a Chinese takeout menu.Their food offerings are usually pretty much the same, but their drinks change/rotate accordingly.\n\n\nI came here with Suany W. and we had so much fun. We came here last year during their \"Chinese takeout\" menu. I had the #1 Boduilige Shuang (Don Q anejo rum, brandy, lime) and the #2 Qincai he Boluo (Plymouth Gin, Pineapplee, Lime, Gardenia) - each drink is $13.\n\nWe also ordered the Thrice cooked fries.. and these were amazing. So crispy on the outside but with a substantial amount of soft and yummy potatoeness inside.\n\nOverall - Trick Dog is a fun bar in the Mission that's great to go with friends or bring and impress your out-of-towners to.

It seemed like everyone we talked to was crowing about \"the hottest spot in SF\" or something like that. We were a little skeptical, which I think is an LA thing... But really: weird name, kinda out of the way, how great could it be?\nWe showed up on Thursday night and it seemed like most of SF was inside. Luckily we were able to wedge our way through the toe-to-toe bar area and get a table upstairs -- PRO TIP: if you're eating dinner you can claim sanctuary on this upstairs island and be served almost immediately, plus you won't have to have some tech kid's Allbirds scuffing up your nice kicks.\nHere's where it gets good -- our server was a probably 6'6\" tall SF cool-kid with a man-bun -- picture an LA hipster, except actually cool. As good as everything else was -- and it was... This guy made our night (His name was possibly misremembered as Shawn?). When you talk about good service -- casual attitude, welcoming vibe, inclusive style -- this guy was the gold standard. We felt cooler just having him associate with us.\nANYWAY -- the food menu was unreal -- amazingly varied and exciting, and probably the most UNDER-PRICED food we saw on our trip. Now, I'm as much a philistine as the next guy, and I'm not trying to blow up any spots, but for real -- in the land of the $20 burger (yes, SF, that's you) -- this place had a blue-chip menu w/ nothing above ~$14. We took down pretty much the whole menu between the group, and legit-EVERYTHING was a 5/5.\nNow for the cocktails -- the menu was a McSweeney's non-profit-benefiting, Dr. Seuss-esque, hardcover, rhyming, illustrated children's book. There's no other way to describe it. It was unreal. When we asked Shawn(?) about it he told us they actually SWITCH menu styles every 6 months and the previous was something like a secret agent dossier thing. Hot damn. Talk about above-and-beyond.\nTried just about all the drinks, which is why I will have trouble telling you which to order... But one came w/ ham and cheese on a toothpick as an \"appetizer\"... One had a miniature p&j sando as a garnish... There's a tiki-style one that has ancho chili that was a huge hit.\nBasically, in an oversaturated, overpriced city -- this place made a HUGE impression. So much so that we came back TWO NIGHTS LATER. And guess who was working the door? Badass man-bun Shawn(?), except now he had his hair down and looked even more chill. As if that were even possible. To cap the whole experience, he actually recognized us right away and made us feel like we were regulars at Cheers. Damn. Trick Dog, you do it right. Never change.", "author": "K F."}

The drinks are spot on. Amazing quality, creativity and craft. \n4. The menu concepts here are awesome. Currently they have a dogs n donuts calendar as the menu. I love that. \n5. The lack of pretense is real. Friendly, welcoming, and non-judgmental. There are a certain few craft cocktail bars in SF that could learn a lot from this. \n\nI haven't had the food here, but I look forward to dining some day.

It's a bit too small of a place for me but otherwise a great bar to start off a great evening. I recommend starting off here for a drink or two then moving on to the next. The main lobby is for drinks and social gatherings while the top floor is for sit-downs and food. I personally don't like how tight spaced this bar can get; elbow to elbow type atmosphere which isn't pleasing. It can get hot and too packed inside. The drinks are on point as well as their bartenders! They're efficient, quick, but take their time at the same time in order for their cocktails to be at it's highest grade. I suggest ordering an original type cocktail such as an old-fashioned then maybe ordering a cocktail off their menu.", "author": "Allister D."}

Confusing enough is that I was told a complaint was made.  On further review it was likely interaction with the female staff.  Perhaps I presented a threat. Nice but there is much to be desired.  They had me leave for a reason I feel is malicious. I don't write reviews but this signals to me that I should speak up and tell others to avoid this business.

Can't really go wrong at this spot if you love craft cocktails, and the clientele was looking good when I arrived.  Occupancy signs say they can fit 49 peeps but you can tell that there are times when this place is packed way beyond that, but if you can score a seat at the bar (or the low seats near the window on the right side when facing the main bar), you'll be doing just as fine as I was on my visit.  The burger was good, but a little small; fries were loaded, nice crisp on the potatoes with the plate.  (Apparently they are triple cooked.  I don't think that's necessary, but I'll play along like it might be.)\n\nTried the March, June, July and December drinks, and would recommend them to anyone.\n\nJust because I see the word \"hipster\" in other reviews, and America has fallen in love with saying \"hipster\" every time they see someone with a mustache, some art, a shaker in their hands and a smile, I'll play along.

Check it out here: http://www.alcademics.com/2015/07/trick-dogs-new-best-in-show-doggie-calendar-cocktail-menu.html\n\nI was here with Brad G's party and he pretty much wrote a novel detailing all 12 drinks so I'll just share my thoughts on select cocktails :)\n\nJuly (Comet): Definitely the best drink on the new menu because it is most complex.  I normally prefer spirit forward drinks served up and do not like highballs but this one is actually worth drinking.  (Although my fried who prefers less alcoholic tasting drinks would disagree.)  The bourbon presence is very strong, as well as the blackberry.  The lemon is not overpowering.  The amaro, wine, and beer add complexity in a way that I cannot pinpoint, I just know I like it.  The aged cheddar is presented on a toothpick laid on top of the glass (not submerged in the drink) and you therefore get it only in the nose and it totally works.  Lastly I'll admit, another reason I enjoy this cocktail is because drinking gives me the munchies for salty food so the cheese is a pleasant snack :)\n\nSeptember (Juno): The bartender put it best - tastes like scotch apple juice.  It was a good summery scotch drink but I was disappointed that it tasted more like apple than the advertised stone fruit.  I was also disappointed I couldn't taste the dill even though they put in a good sized sprig - maybe it would have helped if they spanked it first to release some of the oils?\n\nDecember (Charlie): Solid but basically a rye old fashioned.  I can't comment much on the sandalwood (what does that taste like??), but the coconut was subtle and the coffee was undetectable, which was disappointing because that flavor combination has so much potential!\n\nAugust (Mo): My second favorite drink because of how it develops on your palate.  You taste the tequila up front, then peanut butter (I swear it's true!), then finishes with a lighter sherry note.  And who doesn't enjoy a spirit-soaked Whopper once they finish their drink?", "author": "Beatrice W."}

When that happens, it always helps to weigh the pros and cons in order to give a balanced review.\n\nCON: \nIts cultural appropriation of \"the Chinese restaurant,\" the theme shaping the food/drink menus and decor here for the past 5 months.\nPRO:\nThe play on \"the Chinese restaurant,\" while definitely annoying to me as an Asian American, doesn't turn me off so bad that I ignore the merits of the RIDICULOUSLY delicious Trick Dog burger and other well-done dishes I've had here. In general, I've found the food consistently tasty, somewhat original, and not too crazily priced. The cocktails, which I consider more expensive than the food, are equally well-crafted.\n\nCON: \nIts always loud, occasionally douchey, and by-and-large invasive clientele (with regards to relationship to the neighborhood), who pack themselves like sardines on the main floor nightly... even during the week.\nPRO:\nAs much as I try not to be loud and douchey, I myself am an invasive species to the Mission. Yes, I own it. Though this doesn't change the fact that I still hate how crowded it gets downstairs at night or how some of the people here are simply obnoxious (but, maybe no more than at any other bar in SF).\n\nCON:\nIts failure to take reservations for dinner upstairs, as well as its refusal to seat people upstairs unless you are sitting down for a proper meal.\nPRO:\nBesides the time I couldn't make reservations here for my birthday, the dining room rules don't bother me much. It's pretty easy to score a table for two on most evenings. And on most visits, I do come for the food anyway, not just the drinks.\n\nCON:\nThe hype. Oh, the hype.\nPRO: \nMaybe it kind of/sort of lives up to its hype?

We got there a bit after 3:00, right after they opened.  We were very disappointed to learn that food isn't served until 5:00, but that on is on me because I didn't do research ahead of time.  So we proceeded to do a little day drinking.\n\nI had the #9 cocktail which was mixed with bourbon, kumquat cordial and walnut-infused Fernet Branca.  My son had a drink from the menu that resembled a Manhattan.  We were over the moon with our drinks.\n\nBeing a middle aged guy, I'm always a little sensitive about going into places that some people categorize as hipster joints.  It wasn't an issue here as the two bartenders that served us were fabulous.  They were prompt and were patient with our questions about the drinks.  \n\nOne other thing about Trick Dog: They change the entire theme of the establishment ever six months, from the d\u00e9cor to the drinks to the food.  I really liked the cheap Chinese restaurant theme, but I understand the next iteration is going to happen in the next few weeks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-30", "description": "First, let me say that... being a real Chinese that is fresh off the boat... the Chinese menu is pretty funny and not that offensive. It paints a vivid picture of American Chinese to me -- an era of ignorance that spawned many Chinese restaurants who still serve fortune cookies till this day.\n\nHumour is bound to offend someone though. It's a bold move, but I think that sets the tone for this restaurant/bar.\n\nOn to the edibles. The drinks are meticulously crafted, with interesting ingredients, and very delicious. I can just keep trying all their different cocktails all night long. The drinks all have funny names -- the Chinese words are more like nonsense. Translated back to English, you get gems like \"Tastes like biscuits\", \"Smells like grandma\", or \"Nut for you\".\n\nWe ordered quite a few finger foods to share as well. There's the trick dog (their own ground hot dogs in a bun), the homemade chicken nuggets, the animal style fries. It seems like they decided not to pound all their minced meats to a paste to retain texture -- because both the hot dog and the chicken nuggets tasted as such. The sauces were the highlight on all the items, as was the presentation -- chinese dipping bowls, etc... brings it closer to the theme.\n\nThis is a fun bar to be at, and a delicious one too. The only downside is that it gets really, really crowded. Maybe I should try to actually dine there upstairs some time to get away from the crowds -- but then the crowds will occasionally stare at you. Would it be too creepy?", "author": "Alice C."}

Knowing me, I will go lengths to experience something new, something yet not discovered by the masses, something unique that will draw you back for more, and something where I can attempt to replicate in my own kitchen.  Their concepts and creativity makes me like this place even more. The drink menu was a book of records and each record was a drink. Good vibe, good music, good crowd, good food. I've been \"domesticated\" every Wednesday for the past 1.4 years, my friends have said I've been liberated from a deadbeat loser with no future going for himself.\n\nHEFFER STATUS.\n\nLINDA RONSTADT HEAT WAVE ($10) - Hanger one, lillet rose, melleti, galliano, watermelon, and lime. SO YUMMY. Very delicate in taste and has a light herbal and fruit taste. It was was a creeper, hit me like a ton of bricks. Their drinks here are off the chains.\n\nCRACKLINGS ($6) - Pork belly, brown sugar, spice blend. Uhm SPICY. When I choose to eat some kind of meat, it will have to be pork. It was their version of chicharron, it was good but kind of spicy. I liked how it was freshly fried and didn't carry that old grease taste. After about 3-4 crackins, I was over it as the spice just got spicier. Good to share with another person.\n\nKALE SALAD ($9) - Avocado, parmesan, pepitos, slow-cooked egg yolk dressing. This was one of the best kale salads I've ever had in my life. You can trust my opinion on that. It was lightly creamy because of the egg yolk and avocado, easily to take down, and just a healthy kind deliciousness I can't really explain. I can't believe I'm speaking so highly of a kale salad but it was just a great dish. Good to share between 2-3 people.\n\nSCOTCH EGG ($10) - Soft-boiled egg, brandade, beet confit, salmon roe, cr\u00e8me fraiche. WTHeezie.... pretty damn delicious. I will have to say that it kinda is a bit salty, but if you take each bite with a bit of the beet confit (purple stuff) it really balanced everything out and make the dish ten times tastier. I don't think everything on the plate meshed well but the scotch egg with the beet confit go hand and hand. We ordered one for each of us. Oh my, it's a must.\n\nOur bill totaled around $66+. Not bad at all, our bellies left happy.\n\nWill I be back? We want to come back on Wednesdays but we have decided to not get stuck at once great places and keep hunting for more.\n\nJABA APPROVED.

I woke up to my bachelorette friend and a trio of security guys hovering over me shaking their heads. Damn you, Mr. Tequila.\n\nOnce Mr. Tequila left my life, I've done some growing up and have been semi-behaved. That's until I saw him featured in the Patone-colored menu at one of the hottest new bars in SF.\n\nFrom the people who brought you Flour + Water, Salumeria, and Central Kitchen (next door) comes Trick Dog, an industrial vintage bar in Potrero Hill/Mission serving creative artisanal cocktails ($8-$12) by cute bartenders along with tantalizing bar food eats. 60's and 70s Motown favorites from The Supremes, Marvin Gaye, and Jackson 5 playing in the background added to that old-time feel.\n\nTrick Dog is cracking and even on a Wednesday at 5:30 pm, all the bar seats were taken (hipster and yuppie crowd). Come early as it's a small bar and there's only 12-14 stools. They do have an upper level with tables but all the action is downstairs. Parking is all residential and it may take several rounds to find a spot.\n\nThere were over 20 artisanal cocktails on the menu and against my better judgment, I ordered the Baby Turtle: tequila, campari, grapefruit & lime topped w/ a creamy egg froth ($12). It was wonderfully refreshing with a luscious creamy and fragrant finish from the cinnamon sprinkled egg white froth: http://bit.ly/ZFrt6I. I'm usually not a cocktail girl but this one was cocktastic; cocktail-wise that is. I expected nothing less from the Bon Vivants/Owners who consulted on the menu for 15 Romolo among other bars known for their stellar cocktails.\n\nHappy hour is never complete without something to nosh on. Perusing the menu of cracklins, mushroom hummus, sweetbreads, the burger, and other delectable eats, we decided to exercise some self-control and order one item, the $10 Scotch Egg. One for each of us because I never share my yolk. Fernet lovers: there's even Fernet ice cream on the menu which I regrettably forgot to order. The kitchen closes at 1:30 am. \n\nIt's a good thing we ordered two Scotch eggs because it was incredibly delicious: http://bit.ly/13Xsdem. Perfectly fried to a golden brown, the salt cod (tastes exactly like dungeness crab) encased egg was crunchy on the outside with an yolk that oozed out like lava upon cutting into: http://bit.ly/13XsfTF. The beet confit, creme fraiche and salmon roe made it that much more decadent.\n\nTrick Dog is a great neighborhood bar to distress and drown yourself in one of their yummy cocktails but beware of their not very \"happy\" hour prices (no hh specials).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-14", "description": "For some reason, when I entered the front door of Trick Dog, I felt like I was walking onto the set of a reality TV show where a lot of twenty-somethings were trying to get as drunk as possible just to irritate the hell out of me. I had heard about the bar scene here, so it was with trepidation that I greeted my colleague Robbie's suggestion that a group of us come here for a late night dinner. It shares the same warehouse-style building that houses Central Kitchen, which I felt was a marginally disappointing dining destination when Jamie W. and I went there a couple of years ago. So it was onward and upward as the four of us squeezed through the hipsterati (photo: http://bit.ly/1uGdqhj).\n\nWe finally made our way to the comparatively becalming upstairs section where people actually dine (photo: http://bit.ly/1zQ8Xhr). Even though the noise level was still pretty high, at least the space gave us a reprieve from all the shoulder jostling that could have occurred down below. The menu turned out to be a nice selection of interesting plates (photo: http://bit.ly/16lhQoJ), but first I needed some libation. The $10 Low Proof section of the menu was good enough for me, so I ordered the Necklace of Lights, a nice tall one with Manzanilla sherry, aquavit, peach, lemon and soda (photo: http://bit.ly/1BKkeST). Refreshing for 11PM and it relaxed me from the stress brought on by the crowds. We shared plates since I was among colleagues who are friends as well.\n\nThere was a predictable start with the $7 Guacamole mixed with sweet corn and accompanied by a pile of Mission tortilla chips that needed to be replenished (photo: http://bit.ly/1w5KC6z). No complaints from me as the fresh avocado just whet our appetites for more. Then came two orders of their Thrice-Cooked Fries, which were Kennebec potatoes that were boiled and fried twice - one naked ($5 - photo: http://bit.ly/1BKldlW) and the other Manimal style with chow chow sauce and ketchup ($7 - photo: http://bit.ly/1BB8DTf). Very satisfying for fries. More adventurous choices came next first with the $11 Crispy Duck Egg, tasty and savory as it came deep-fried atop cranberry beans, chorizo, Cojita cheese and epazote salsa verde (photo: http://bit.ly/1wuYjKU). I have to say the evening's winning dish came in the form of the $9 Kale Salad.\n\nIt was piled high on a plate with chopped greens with a creamy egg-based dressing, chunks of avocado, toasted pumpkin seeds and Parmesan cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/1spLxik). The $11 Tomato Salad was overshadowed even though the Early Girl and Sungold tomatoes lent a welcome freshness complemented by the burrata, basil seeds and bread crumbs (photo: http://bit.ly/1A7vN2D). The most anticipated plate came next, the $10 namesake Trick Dog, a tender burger shaped like a frank to fit into a sesame seed hot dog bun and ladled with lettuce, onion, pickles, cheddar cheese and their house sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/12M4CiA). It was tasty but relatively inconsequential compared to the other plates. We finally ended our meal with something sweet, the $10 Fig Tartine, which mixed Kabdota figs, their own housemade ricotta cheese, peanut brittle, ver jus and a lime vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/1uGemT0). \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...better than expected food really chows creative flair and solid flavors\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...quite loud though cordoning off the upstairs for their dining clientele was a smart move\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very attentive and informed\nTOTAL - 4 stars...the Bon Vivants deliver the goods in this space even if the bar noise dilutes the dining experience", "author": "Ed U."}

Let's start with the dramatic cocktail menus. What used to be Pantone strips now is in the form of a book of records. Took me a minute to realize each record actually has the name of a cocktail on it, themed to suit the song name (\"Ain't No Sunshine,\" \"Eye of the Tiger\")...I had just flipped to the Spirits insert towards the back, and settled on a gin and lilikoi (so hip we can't call it \"passion fruit\") soda, which was surprisingly tasty.\n\nThen there are the handsome bartenders, with their hip aprons and the spectacle of watching one of them shake up not 2, but 3 drinks at one time. This place is so cool I once waited for 15 minutes around 8pm on a Thursday to get in. It's so cool it draws quite the eclectic crowd (veers to older), from lumberjack beard man to Marina girls night out, and you can get your thrice-cooked fries \"manimal style\" if you so desire.\n\nSure it's a pain to push your way to the bar, cringe that you're always up in the personal space of those seated as you call out your order, and feel like you're watching paint dry as you wait for your drink, but once you have it in hand, you realize it's a pretty tasty concoction that has fancy garnishes like lemon slices (not wedges!) and...you feel immediately cooler.

We settled on the chicken nuggets, Trick Dog sandwich and the manimal fries. The fries were very thick and dry. It was happily topped high with a sauce which was good, but didn't leave me wanting more. The chicken nuggets had an odd texture to them and needed their dipping sauces. \n\nI can say that the Trick Dog sandwich was really good! It had a great flavor and perfect texture.

Ah hah! The upstairs area is much more fitting for food. Nice little tables, cool lighting fixtures, neat windows.\n\nThe menu was a tad sparse with vegetarian food, but it was getting late, and I wasn't so hungry, so I went for the kale salad.\nShortly after, as we were enjoying cocktails (they were okay. The ones I had were not as amazing as Pl\u00e4j's), we watched a neighboring tale get their kale salad. It was a huge mountain of a salad! Like, half a 4\" tall pile of salad. As I panicked about how much food I had ordered for a late-night snack, I thought it had to be multiple orders.

I really liked everything, but there were a few real standouts. My hands down favorite thing was the Kale salad, and by the sheer volume of them flowing out of the kitchen, a lot of folks out there agree. Part of its' wonderfulness is its' simplicity. This one has  avocado, parmesan, pepitos, and a slow-cooked egg yolk dressing. Yum Their version of a Scotch egg was pretty fabulous too. It came with the requisite soft-boiled egg, but instead of the typical sausage wrapping, they chose to go with a brandade (an emulsion of salt cod and olive oil) wrapping. The fish tasted like fish sticks (in a good way) and made me think of breakfasts as a kid. If I HAD been at home, that would have mean it would be paired with a warm Winchell's jelly doughnut, but I was at Trick Dog, so I had to make due with purple potato salad and romesco sauce. My third favorite was the Fig Tartine. It had Kadota figs, housemade ricotta, and pinenut brittle (!!!) with a verjus and lime vinaigrette. It was delicate and super fresh. We didn't try the burger or fish tacos, both of which looked intriguing. I think they may be on the docket for a future visit. \n\nAll the cocktails are interesting. I could only have one, so I opted to go the rye route and have a Fugazi Bank. It's not for the faint of heart, but it's a nicely balanced tipple. My friend's Cliff House was lovely, even though I was wishing for more chocolate. The atmosphere is no frills, but there is a chance for some good people watching. Service was fine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-11", "description": "So I was on a recent trip to SF and Trick Dog was a definite must on my list. It was recently names one of the best bars in the world along with another SF bar. I had tried to go to the other bar on the list, Smugglers Cove, the night before and didn't even get in because of the pretentious and angry man working the door who had an attitude problem. I had almost lost hope that I would get to try one of SF's best bars but then I went to Trick Dog.\n\nTrick Dog doesn't have a sign out front so when we first arrived we were confused if we had gotten the address correct. We stopped to try and look around and immediately a friendly man approached us and said \"Looking for Trick Dog?\" and he lead us right into the bar. I immediately felt welcomed! The bar had an upstairs with sit down tables and the downstairs was the actual bar. We were able to get a seat right away and were instantly handed a drink menu. The menu itself was literally a map with each drink named after a neighborhood/attraction in SF which was pretty cool.\n\nWe tried a total of four drinks; Lombard Street, Alcatraz, Mission Dolores and Fugazi Bank. My favorite was the Mission Dolores which was a sweet drink of four rums, followed by the Lomard Street drink. Overall, all of the drinks were fantastic and it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartenders work their magic. \n\nThe staff was really friendly and I am so glad I finally got to visit this place. The service, drinks and atmosphere were top notch and I can't wait to return!", "author": "Courtney D."}

There's no signage outside other than two Chinese characters in red that translate to \"trick dog\". Good thing there's a bouncer standing out there watching for confused patrons and asking us \"are you looking for trick dog?\".\n\nThe space is long and skinny, two floors. Kinda like Rickhouse downtown. But not nearly as crowded. Service could possibly be worse though.\n\nThe entire menu is in Chinese with pinyin translations of the names. Luckily the descriptions are in English and each item has a number to order from.\n\nChoose quickly then peruse as you stand around trying to get the bar's attention. Literally there were 5 people behind the bar and only one person making drinks. Took me 20 minutes to get my order in and at least another 15 before it showed up. After that though it wasn't as bad. Not sure if things were going smoother behind the bar or if we as a group were able to get their attention better when we needed it, or maybe we were just being efficient and when one person wanted to order everyone else would rush in with their requests.\n\nDrinks themselves are very very good. I tried the #2 (cranberry), #3 (tropical gin), #9 (herbal bourbon). I like how they pair up the flavors. But I like strong drinks and herbal flavors.", "author": "Jean K."}

There are plenty of great spots in this city and the last thing I am going to do is run up a tab at a bar where the owner and management have so little regard for the customer experience. \n\nWhen we got to the bar there was one girl waiting at the door. She had three friends inside sitting 10 feet away yet the doorman could not let her in. She had been waiting for 20 minutes when we got there and she waited for another 20. The bar inside was far from packed, it was actually very sparse inside. While we were waiting at least 20 people walked out yet they still didn't let anyone in.  We were told that the owners were around and they would prefer it not to be crowded.  After waiting for 45minutes, the girl waved good-bye to her friends and left. They were still saving a chair for her... \n\nMessage to the management and owners - this isn't Las Vegas and you're running a bar, not a nightclub.  Manufacturing a line outside so you can feel good about yourself is a total joke. \n\nThe bar inside was pretty unimpressive and there is a long list of bars with a cool vibe that can make a good drink.  Lots of people stopped by while we were waiting and quickly moved on.  We only waited because our friend was on the way.  You can be sure those visitors will never be back. \n\nHowever, if you feel like standing in line with a bunch of bearded, cigarette smoking hipsters...

I live in san jose and make trips up to the city as often as i can and this has been one of my favorite spots to revisit.  I am yet to have an experience short of stellar. \n\nThe bar staff - friendly and professional.  Extremely helpful, and you can tell they enjoy being there (which is a great job by management & ownership).  Often I find that San Francisco bars struggle with hospitality skills.  The great city is a titan for the cocktail scene, and very much so deserving.  However all too often I get served by far from humble individuals.  But the folks behind the stick at trick dog give off no pretentious vibes.  \n\nThe beverage program is a work of art.  And not only what goes into the glass.  The menus are innovating & unique.  Last round I experienced was a Dog Calendar, where all drink options were attached to a different month.  The current menu looks like a confidential packet from a criminal investigation.  The contents of the libations too are innovative.  These guys are pushing boundaries with delicious execution.  Rarely do I go to a bar where I am excited to drink the entire menu. \n\nThe decor and environment was well drawn out as well.  One of my favorite parts about the space is the back bar.  The bottle shelves are like no other shelves you've seen.

I have wanted to come to Trick Dog for years as it is one of the best bars in the nation, and I was very impressed. Tucked in an obscure smaller area of the Mission next to Sightglass and some other restaurants, the pink building has no sign. You hear the music, see the people, and assume that's the one. \n\nThe casual ambience was charming and inviting with tables along one wall and stools along the bar. Trick Dog also has an upstairs dining area, but most people came for the bar. Seats are first come first serve, so you just have to be quick about grabbing a table or seats. Even though it is a free for all, people were respectful and nice; there was no shoving, pushing, shouting, or an unorganized feel. \n\nNow, getting to the drinks. With 12 drinks, one for each month, the selection is unique and delicious. Since I was born in May, I had to get the May drink as my first. It had blanco tequila, tempus fugit kina l'avion d'Or, sunflower seed, and sweet lime. I also enjoyed the April drink, with vodka, vermouth, Suze, green grapes, taragon, and lime. Both are sweeter drinks, and the April one even came in a special glass. Even though the menu is dog themed now, in a few months, it will be something else unique again because Trick Dog changes its menu from time to time, so that customers always stay fascinated and can taste unique drinks. I will definitely be coming back soon to try more month drinks!", "author": "Annie C."}

But why do they come in a mug shaped like a face with a Fu Manchu mustache on it? Racial caricatures aren't funny in any form. Can you imagine what kind of lawsuits you'd get if you served with a mug shaped like a \"little black sambo\" or a big-nosed Jewish caricature? It's really the same thing. \n\nAnd if you bother to give every drink a Chinese name, why can't I order with the name you put on the menu?

I loved all of the flavors, and I'm happy I took the bartenders recommendation for this one instead of going with #5 which was my first choice. The #12 was good as well - especially with the housemade marshmellow. Bartenders know their stuff here.", "author": "Teresa C."}

I always recommended them as a great place for cocktails and socializing. I even had a great experience hanging out and chatting with the bar tenders on several occasions. \n\nSo why the ONE star review? \n\nWell, I met up with a few friends last week and we sat by the bar and were figuring out the order, it was a busy Tuesday night a little loud and crowded, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Anyway, a few people gave their orders to the bartender (who's name was JIM i believe), and a couple other were still deciding and decided not to order right then. So Jim made the drinks and handed them to the group. Everyone who ordered grabbed their drinks and there was one left - we asked around to see who's it was and no one had ordered it. So we told Jim. Jim then proceeded to throw a FIT, that would make a pmsing 18 year old look girl look like a pleasure.  \n\nKeep in mind this was a Tuesday, no one was hammered or even close to drunk, this was our 1st drink of the evening. To avoid argument and conflict after a bit of back and forth, one of the guys in the group stepped up and bought the drink, also mentioned that  we'd probably end up buying more round anyway - so no big deal! Even though in my experience, if a mistake has been made, bar tenders generally tend to offer to take the drink back. \n\nThe group finished their drinks and the guy who bought the extra cocktail, decides to order another round for everyone. Here is when it gets really funny... Jim tells him that he will allow him to buy a drink but if he purchases any other drinks and gives them to anyone else in the group he will kick him and the rest of the group out of the bar. \n\nThe group tried to talk to jim the bartender, even to jims coworker, but there was no reasoning with jim and the coworker stood by his colleague which is to be expected. After some insults and back and forth, and very unnecessary childish drama for a Tuesday night it's needless to say we decided to cut our night short and leave. \n\nOnce we walked out - we heard tht the bouncer was told not to let the group back in. I have never been so insulted in my life. No one in the group did anything to deserve that treatment. It was over the top, blown insanely out of proportion and just bizarre erratic behavior by the Trick Dog staff member.\n\nI will NOT be going back - and will definitely not be recommending trick dog to any friends from here forward. it's truly a shame - BC it is nice spot and i'm sure the owners and other people involved with the bar are just fine. \n\nJim need to check his attitude and his insecurities at the door... no, at the city line.

Luckily, my partner had arrived a little early to snag some seats, which were being eyed lustily for the other patrons when I finally arrived.  Ordered the #9 cocktail, which was an infusion of bourbon, kumquat liqueur and some other equally unlikely ingredients.... which managed to send this jaded lush into fits of gushy praise.\n\nOrdered some food also -- the menu is an ironic take on your dime-a-dozen greasy Chinese Restaurant... but so much better than that.

We got there early around 4 so it was pretty empty, which allowed us to pretty much take it over for a friends b-day.\n\nFirst, it was day drinking and it was a hot day, so I allowed myself to drink \"girly\" drinks cause, well, they are refreshing!  The drinks menu is in the form of small vinyl records book.  Each record represents a different drink!  The used to have a book of paint samples as the menu.  Very Hipster indeed.  Drinks were good.  They have a fully stocked bar for off menu ordering.  They also have a non-alcoholic section!  \n\nHowever, this day was anything but hipster for Trick Dog as we took it over.  The staff was really nice and helpful and the bartenders were friendly and attentive as well.  We also ordered food and buy was this the best part.  The Scotch Egg was amazing, with an outside layer that was done so well, it tasted like crab cakes.  The Trick Dog itself was actually a burger and not a hot dog, tasty!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-18", "description": "On a lazy Saturday afternoon my sis and I rolled into Trick Dog soon after they opened at 3:00pm. We stayed for a good 3 hours and had 5 drinks. One thing you must know about my sister and I is that we are picky eaters, and perhaps even pickier drinkers. The mere fact that we were interested enough to try half the cocktail menu  at Trick Dog warrants 5 stars off the bat.\n\nWhat Trick Dog has going for it is their candidly bizarre drinks. There are combinations I've never heard or thought of before. A carrot drink? A chocolate-covered olive? How about a homemade marshmallow in your scotch? For foodies like us it was like being a kid in a candy store: too many interesting things to try and not enough space for all of it (or perhaps more realistically, not enough alcohol tolerance...).\n\nThat's not to say I absolutely adored every drink I had. Lighter, citrus-y drinks are not my favorite so I found that I didn't particularly enjoy the #4 (notable for coconut infused rum, harissa, and green tea) or #9 (tequila and carrot (!!) drink with absinthe). Despite my personal preferences, I still appreciated the drinks for their unique flavors, like the intriguing savory quality of the harissa, and that bizarre carrot-y sweetness in that carrot drink! The #12 (nice touch of smokiness from the scotch and that boozy marshmallow was great) and #9 (intense walnut flavor was fantastic) were really solid, tasty drinks that I would easily order again. But perhaps the best part was that when we asked about a drink on the previous Zodiac menu, the bartenders were accommodating enough to look up the previous drink and mix us up a something that fit to the best of their ability (the drink was fantastic, btw). They did not have to do that; it was awesome service on their end.\n\nI also want to tip my hat to the concept of Trick Dog. A rotating menu and theme every 6 months is a brilliant way to keep things new and interesting for customers (next time I'm in the Bay Area I know I'll want to come back!). That's what I love so much about the crazy concoctions at Trick Dog - I saw combinations I never imagined; I tasted flavors I'd never tasted before. It's places like this that keep my inner foodie going.", "author": "Clarice W."}

This is more like someone's loft with Start-up looking crowds who wear fashion sneakers and checker shirts than business shirts with leather shoes. It portrays a casual, fun, very friendly and Mission atmosphere.\n\nThe bartenders here know how to make a solid drink. Not a big fan of fizzy drink but theirs were a good starter. Their stronger drinks definitely are way more solid and delicious. The 2 of us had 7 drinks out of the fun paint book so that shows how much we liked them (from smooth to fizzy):\n\nAlligator Alley\nVintage Photo\nLion Heart\nPaper Moon\nStraw Hat\nBaby Turtle\nPantone 7621\n\nWe came here on a Tuesday and it was quite busy. Drinks did take about 10 to 15 minutes to arrive early on around 8pm (most drinks do take time to create and the place was more than 75% packed) but got better after 9ish.\n\nThe great thing about this place is that you can enjoy a fantastic drink in the well lacquered but keeps rustic feel in the dim light (most standing room except by the bar with seats if you want to eat downstairs.) It's not too loud (not sure about the weekend since it's not that big of a place. Think of a smaller loft.)\n\nPerfect timing as we got hungry after a drink and went upstairs where there's table service with menu. \n\nIn between the beams, here comes the light.\n\nThere were about 9 to 10 tables and most seat for 2 with a few that fit 4. There's good space between the tables and it actually feels more like a bistro. You left the lively crowd and great background music, and stepped into coziness. The seats were plush comfortable!\n\nFood was decent and the dishes were lounge dish size. We had 6 dishes:\n\n* Raw radish with dehydrated Campari butter dip and house-smoked Moldon sea salt - the trick was the butter.\n\n* Cracklins (pork belly) - the fatty part was good but meat was too dense for my taste\n\n* Beer nuts - turned out I really love beer nuts!\n\n* Scotch egg - smart and artsy looking and was a soft-boiled egg wrapped in brandade served with shaved beet with a side of salmon roe and creme fraiche. The egg was very good but they can totally skip the beets that was too overwhelming. Everything else looked more like garnish than a side.\n\n* TrickDog - the trick was the sirloin, chuck and brisket, and that aioli with stronger mustard and really good pickles. This felt right home in the Mission style - greased up and absorbing all the alcohol that made you so hungry in the previous 2 hours.\n\n* Brussels sprouts were not the totally crispy style but softer. This actually was my preferred style.\n\nTrick Dog is right next to Central Kitchen and they even share the bathroom. No sign and you will literally pass right by and thought it was part of Central Kitchen. Do like the fact that it's not on Valencia side and it gives this place a more neighborhood feel.", "author": "T L."}

I went to Trick Dog with 5 friends on the second day that it was open, and as imagined, it wasn't a slow night. It was packed, but I'm guessing if you give it a few weeks, it'll die down on the weekdays since it's a little off the beaten path (Valencia). I'd been hitting up the Hideout behind Dalva for craft cocktails, but am really glad that Trick Dog is another available option, as it lives up to the hype, and bonus points, is much closer to my apartment. The location is great. A major ease of going to Trick Dog as opposed to the Hideout will be not having to wonder if my bike will still be there when I leave.\n\nOne might think that their Pantone-themed drinks, and even further, menus could be compensating for weak service or cocktails, but that wasn't the case for us. All six of us got a different drink, and they were all AMAZING. Service was backed up for the night, but it was the second night they were open, so you gotta give 'em a break. \n\nI ordered the Pantone 7621, which contains a few of my fave ingredients: beet, ginger, and lemon, combined with Kummel, Combier, and Four Roses Bourbon.

A good 30 min wait for a table but decent standing room downstairs (a plus for the hooks under the table top to hang your coats and purse, us bag ladies truly appreciate you *cue Erykah Badu music*).\n\nA nod for the Pantone inspired drink menu, HELLA artsy fartsy. First glance I was confused at what I was reading.... Words next to the familiar \"rum/brandy/bitters\" had no meaning to me. So I ordered based on pantone color and drink name... It was a yellow-orange tone by the name of Lion Heart (familiar words like mango was on the list, totally in the mood for something fruity). Overall, it was pretty good. Cute little wine glass (I'm not a glass connoisseur obviously) with a strawberry varnish. I ordered 2, not drunk but I was definitely talking more.\n\nAs for the food... Ordered the rice plate (pork, with fried sticky rice, mushrooms with fish sauce). It was good, wish the rice cake was bigger because after it was gone, the dish was too salty for my liking. Also ordered brussel sprouts, very good as a side to another item, but not as a standalone dish... then this is where the Asian side of me hurt a bit... I didn' finish my food, figured I'd take the rest to go but the waitress took the plates and they were gone, forever...

The Radio Flyer.  Wild Turkey, dried cranberry infused Cocchi Americano, Tomahawk Bitters and a pickled cranberry garnish.    I was impressed.  With that in mind, I had high expectations for Trick Dog and they did not disappoint.   \n\nWe went to see Eddie Izzard (woo!)  at Z-Space around the corner and stopped in for a pre-show cocktail.  The line was about 6 people long at 8:30pm which wasn't too bad.  It moved quickly and the doorman was friendly ...  giving us updates on how much longer it might be and thanking us sincerely for being so patient.   Waitstaff and bartenders were equally friendly and service was quick. \n\nUpon entering and finding a spot to squeeze in we were acknowledged immediately and given a drink menu to peruse.  The Panettone card style menu is a little large and therefore a bit unwieldy to flip through but on the other hand it is creative and definitely convenient.   You can just pick what you want and hand it back to the bartender rather than try to shout over the din.   \n\nWe tried the Gypsy Tan and Pennies From Heaven.  Both were complex and delicious.  If we didn't have a show to attend we would have gone back for another round and tried the food but we'll have to wait until next time.  Sadly, the line was way too long (30 people or so) after the show ended (around midnight) so when we return it'll have to be early.  YMMV.  \n\nLoved the decor and people watching.  Since the space is pretty small it gets warm inside, especially upstairs ...so be prepared.   Street parking in the area is not too bad.  Restrooms are shared with the restaurant next door but weren't crowded at all and were practically spotless.\n\nIs the crowd pretentious or hipster?  Eh...  I dunno...    I didn't get that vibe but then I'm a little older than most of the folks who were there so I also didn't particularly care.  I'm not trying to compete with or impress anyone.  I'm just interested in good food, good drink and good atmosphere and Trick Dog delivers.    \n\nWe'll be back.  Saving a star for the food until then.", "author": "Shanna K."}

Drink names by artists such as Elvis Presley, The Kingsmen and The Clash adorn each record. \n\nI guess Pantone has made way for records. \n\nThe cocktails were tasty, but the real treat was venturing upstairs into the loft-like second floor dining area and wondering through the choices of small plates. Nothing cost over $12 and everything, and I mean everything, sounded appealing. That doesn't happen very often. \n\nThe small plates are ideal for sharing and you could make a meal out of three or four of them. We were intending on being there for a pre-dinner drink, which turned into pre-dinner appetizers because everything sounded intriguing.

From the moment I walked in to Trick Dog and spotted the mix master mixologist's working their craft, I knew I was going to like this place.  It's like going into a secret drink lab where the menu is a list of complicated schematics and the tools of the trade... beakers of all sorts and sizes.  I believe my bartender's name was Chad (whichever one is from Boston).  His service was top notch and i was actually fascinated watching him make my drinks.\n\nMy first drink was a bartenders choice that a friend of mine got and I had to try.  The only instructions were bourbon and citrus and the rest was on Chad.  He did an amazing job and I wish I could remember what it was called because I would definitely try to get a replication back home.\n\nNext up was the Pennies From Heaven (Templeton Rye, Meletti, Leopold sour apple liqueur, sherry, and Gold Rush bitters).  I Thoroughly enjoyed this one even with the added sweetness.  Until I tried the Witch Wood.  I'm not downing on the Pennies From Heaven, but the Witchwood (Torres ten-year brandy, Pampero Aniversario rum, Manzilla sherry, Pedro Ximenez sherry, Ron Miel honey rum, and Alhambra bitters Served up) was wonderfully wicked.\n\nI can't wait to go back.\n\nPS. - I heard people are stealing those sweet ass bar menus that look like paint swatches.

Maybe not to those who also have an air of dickishness about them, but to most people who pay attention to culture and politics, it does. It's hard to want the place to succeed after that ridiculous video made by the owners on how to spend $1000 in the Mission. Just so incredibly tone-deaf and sadly emblematic of the wave of gentrification surging through the Mission, to name but one neighborhood.\n\nSo yeah, on one hand, this place is a bar that has good drinks and a fun, bar-ish atmosphere.

The place is small but there is this simple yet classy vibe about it. The decor is enchanted with funky brassy lamp holders, candles and pictures which just work. The staff is attentive and sweet and if there is something not on the drink menu  which is funky in itself because the drinks are in a book made out if old small vinyl records and the baby turtle was not available but I was offered something similar that the mixologist was willing to make it for me which u declined,  I asked for them to use Polish vodka which I was super surprised that they had - luksusowa, mint and asked for the drink to be little sweet and they made a yummy drink which was bubbly....A for effort for sure, very small drink that Polish myself would need to order many of. \nLets get to the yummy stuff...food! The shrimp cocktail which included 4 shrimp total for $12 so you do the math was incredible, each of these shrimp was cooked to perfection and the horseradish sauce was such a nice compliment. The three slices of green fried tomatoes for $6 were bland and needed some seasoning on them, they were presented with a source but slobs they were just too plain.

My friend who lives in the city told me that the themes of the menus change all the time. I can't wait to come back and see what drinks they're serving next time!", "author": "Liz D."}

I counted three bartenders working--one bearded hipster boy, one adult man in suspenders, one siren in tights. They moved like manatees or filibustering congressmen. Meanwhile, thirsty customers stormed the bar like it was D-day, their bodies piling up in rows as they were repelled. Despite my determination and relative lack of courtesy to others, it still took 30 minutes to place an order, and the realization of that order recapitulated the first moratorium on intoxication.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-06", "description": "This is certainly a good bar with a creative cocktail program. But man - it could use an attitude adjustment.\n\nMy friend and I arrived here around 5pm to catch up over a drink. I was excited to check it out because their libation program was created by the Bon Vivants (one of SF's top mixology teams). It's located in a funky yet burgeoning part of the Mission (20th St. @ Florida), next to Central Kitchen, Salumeria, and Flour + Water. Be warned: parking in this hood ain't easy. \n\nWe saddled up at the bar and perused the menu. The menu is actually pretty clever - it's a rotating circular thingy (like something out of a board game), and you move it around to find your zodiac sign, and then it recommends a drink for you. I'm a Libra, and the corresponding drink was an interesting concoction of tequila, tangerine, dill, lime, and egg white, and maccha. All of those ingredients sounded appealing to me except the egg white. In fact, all the zodiac inspired drinks looked tasty at first, but then it would have one or two ingredients that didn't match my palate. I finally asked the hipster bartender if I could just order a regular cocktail like a martini or manhatten. This is the part that kind of cracked me up. She looked at me all snooty and replied, \"Yeah. Why wouldn't you?\" And then rolled her eyes. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"I just didn't see any other drinks listed on the menu. Can I just have a manhatten on the rocks?\" She kind of nodded at me as if unimpressed by my drink order. My friend decided to stick with the zodiac cocktail program and order the Libra/Tequila drink. \"Would it be possible to order this drink without the egg white?\" my friend sheepishly inquired. The bartender just sort of stared blankly at her for a few seconds and replied, \"Why? Do you have some sort of aversion to egg white or something?\" This response definitely caught the both of us off guard. \"Um, no. we just don't like it.\" The bartender sighed and went off to make our drinks. \n\nAfter we got our drinks, we tried to find somewhere to sit. All the bar stools were more or less taken, and the rest of the bar area is comprised of tables and counters where you just sort of lean and drink. We decided to go upstairs to see if we could grab a table and chat. It looked more like an empty dining room with tables and silverware. But before we could grab a seat, an employee told us that this section was closed off until 5pm for dinner service. I looked at my watch and we were about 5 minutes early. So cocktails in hand and tails between our legs, we returned to the downstairs bar area and perched our drinks at one of the lean in counters.\n\nOver all, the cocktails were very tasty. My friend loved her egg white-less tequila beverage. And my manhatten was perfectly balanced. Instead of serving it on the rocks, they gave me the largest ice cube I have ever seen (this thing was a boulder). In fact, it made drinking it by hand a little tricky (maybe that's why they call it Trick Dog). So I had to grab a straw to stick in my glass. I made sure to do it while the bartender wasn't looking, lest she roll her eyes again and judge me.\n\nLong story short - this place makes good drinks and attracts a lively crowd. This isn't my normal go-to neighborhood, so it was nice to get out of my comfort zone and explore some place new. I would definitely return for a tasty cocktail, and I'd like to try some of their menu items. I'm just hoping that when I return, the servers drop the 'tude and make the customers feel more welcome. In my opinion, that's the difference between a good bar and a great bar.", "author": "Kevin B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-11", "description": "As a fan of well-constructed and innovative cocktails, the rollout of the new Trick Dog menu every six months is a heavily anticipated event. The four star rating here is related to the latest drink menu, as I would definitely give the bar five stars overall for being able to consistently construct tasty and creative drinks (with delicious bar food to boot)\n\nI was accompanied by several friends on the most recent visit, so we were able to sample our way through the entirety of the latest Dog Calendar-themed menu. As always, the menu design manages to be fun (the dogs are very cute!) without being too cumbersome. I also really like that this menu can be purchased with the money going to a few dog rescues.\n\nIn general, I found that the individual components within many of the drinks on the latest menu tended to get lost compared to some drinks from previous menus (the Aries and Libra from the Zodiac menu, the #'s 8 and 9 drinks from the Chinese restaurant menu for example). While many would argue that ingredients like bonito or tomolive should not stand out within a cocktail, I do feel that being able to taste the different layers in a drink (bitter notes from Campari, depth from chocolate mole bitters or aged rum, etc) elevates my enjoyment of the cocktail. Having said that, all of the drinks do taste good. It's just that there were fewer standouts for me than the previous menu (or the delicious Zodiac menu).\n\nA synopsis of each drink (with the caveat that the bulk of these judgments are based on a sip or two from the drink from one of my friends. My liver and wallet are certainly not strong enough to handle all of these drinks alone!):\n\nJanuary: A pretty tasty spin on a Sour style of cocktail. I liked how the Irish Whiskey worked with the orange citrus and bitter notes from the Gran Classico and the vanilla. Some friends found the drink a tad on the sweet side, but this was not the case for me personally\n\nFebruary: A fun play on a Tiki-style drink with a split tequila and rum base. The key lime is quite prominent and reminded me of a liquefied slice of key lime pie. Depending on your point of view, this could be good or bad (mark my vote in the good column!) \n\nMarch: Refreshing, but I only noticed the citrus and strawberry. Did not pick up any of the spice or bitterness from the Ancho Reyes or Campari\n\nApril: Another refreshing drink that mostly tasted like a (fresh) grape soda, though hints of bitterness from the Suze did peak through\n\nMay: Tasted like a nice margarita (certainly not a bad thing)\n\nJune: A nice spin on the Pimm's Cup, but the bar seemed to be out of mint and cucumber. I think the aromatic note from the mint would have bumped my enjoyment of this drink up a bit higher\n\nJuly: Definitely the cocktail on the new menu with the most disparate list of ingredients. However, everything came together to make a wonderfully complex and enjoyable drink. This was the consensus favorite amongst our group. The bourbon is initially present, before the citrus, blackberry, and wine notes come forward. The drink finishes with the spice and herbal notes from the bourbon and amaro. For those worried about the sharp cheddar, it is a garnish (but does contribute to the aroma; not as bad as it sounds, trust me!)\n\nAugust: Another favorite of mine. The baking spices from the barrel aged reposado and the nuttiness of the sherry worked very well together (though some friends commented that they gave a bit of a peanut-buttery flavor)\n\nSeptember: Mostly came away with scotch and stone fruit (maybe plum) notes from the drink, with the other ingredients getting a bit lost. Good, but did not pick up on the aroma or flavor from the dill, grapiness of the cognac, etc\n\nOctober: A savory spin on a martini, though I would give a slight nod to the martini-variant from the previous menu (#6)\n\nNovember: On paper, this drink had the greatest pull for me. However, I was only able to pick up on the bourbon with a note of orange. I was curious to see how the pear/pecan vermouth would contribute to the flavor, but they were not noticeable. Not a bad drink at all, but did not stand out too much from other Manhattan variants available in the city.\n\nDecember: Another drink that sounded good on paper, but mostly tasted like a rye old fashioned (again, not bad, but also not on the level of some of their other drinks). The other ingredients did not really stand out upon my tasting.\n\nIn summation, it was another fun trip to Trick Dog for me and my group of friends. However, the bar has set a very high...what's the word?...bar for itself and I feel like less drinks had the same wow factor on this menu versus some prior versions. I still would happily return to have more of the July, August, or February and definitely look forward to menu #7!", "author": "Brad G."}

This is my favorite bar in San Francisco for many reasons. First of all, the drinks are always well made and are always original. You can order your usual or look at their ever changing menu for inspiration. Secondly, they don't ever let it get out of control crowded so there usually isn't a problem with personal space or ordering a drink. Lastly, their food is AWESOME.  I don't need to go grab food anywhere else when I can sit down and eat some of the best food in the city after I'm 4 drinks into my Friday night. The only minus I'll say is that the upstairs can get super loud but that's such a minor issue when you can just hurry up and eat and head back downstairs for one more drink before heading home.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-14", "description": "Staff at bar/restaurant were polite and helpful and kale salad looked epic. However, this review is aimed at the crowd, drinks and ambience on a Friday night around 11.\n\nEntire upstairs is a dining area and not much room to move around downstairs, better for an after work place if it were empty-20 people.  Whole venue space is typical small, crowded bar. Drink menus in a fake old timey record folder. Hard to read and I don't wear glasses. Other customers equally deterred by tiny print and lack of ease in locating a drink menu (only 2, nothing posted on wall). Novel idea, bad execution. (again would be fine if you were seated and the place was empty and you had the luxury of going through it at a leisurely pace). Each record is a drink and mixed in with the original record title, Black Uhuru and other  artists' real tracks designed to elicit ooOoooos and aaAahs re: musical knowledge and general pretentiousness.\n\nThe crowd gave off a similar vibe. I felt like I was in the Marina, Polk  or any urban enclave of corporate hipsters. Had I really left the city for so long,? The Mission went from 25% to a strong 50% to a clean 98% nonconformist-conformist transplant gentrification? No, but this particular venue-Absolutely. There are two overpriced and difficult to book places with \"tasting menus\" within spitting distance:  Central Kitchen (connected to bar) and flour+water, as well as a beerstein and \"Shotwells\" a local pub serving beer and wine only..... so it makes sense. I remember growing up, a friend lived on Lexington and 19th and as much as things had been changing for the last 20 years, there was nothing like this. I felt like an alien in my own hometown. To top it off, was so crowded--as it gets in these kinds of situations some people are respectful and some people are careless and become pushy, step on you, spill drinks, (first and last occured). Either way, no one here was interacting outside their little clumps, no congeniality  or sense of community here, folks. Love small business thriving but this feels like a whole different animal. Anyhoo, that was the vibe there.  \n\nThe drinks themselves were elaborate (took 5 minutes to make), involved any combination of tiny bottles of syrups and extractions, fresh citrus peels and fresh bitters shavings, and tasted good, vodka-based and mezcal-based refreshers that did not taste overly sweet at the time. No disgusting artisanal bourbon concoctions to go with the wave of folk music/Mumford and Sons revival music in the background, (I've been tricked before by a bourbon drink sounding delicious.) \n\nHowever, I had a banging headache this morning and I can usually handle my alcohol. Also drinks were not strong nor did they give me a good buzz. And even if sweet, two drinks should not give you a massive headache the next day (after drinking lots of water.)\n\nI would never want to go back here. Again, the staff was super nice, impressively so for popular spots in the Mission, who more often then not have the apathetic to downright rude service to go with the obnoxious \"city\" vibe, it was just the crowd and the overall vibe of the place I couldn't stand. (On the service account it seemed as though the staff here were one of those exceptional city locations with all the trappings of edgy urbanites, but the humble and utterly conscientious service to make it tolerable, shout-out to Southpaw up the street-they were awesome.) \n\nUltimately this bar has been more fun to write about then to visit. As soon as we gave the place  a good try and ordered two different drinks we downed them and took off.", "author": "Lily G."}

Too bad I was unable to try the drinks, but the sheer number of people downstairs having a good time is proof enough that their drinks must be solid.\n\nWe went here mostly for the food, which was delicious! Started off with the chips and guac, which was a whoppin' price of $7.00. I definitely do not recommend this as neither the chips, nor the guac were worth that price, in my opinion. The highlight of the meal was the beef \"tartare,\" which was made with sous vide sirloin and had a raw egg yolk on top. The idea of doing a sous vide tartare is absolutely genius and would appeal to those who are a bit scared of trying fully raw meat.\n\nOther highlights include the trick dog, which is cooked to a nice medium rare. We also go the rice plate, which was good, but nothing too memorable. The best part on that plate was the rice cake! We tried out the thrice cooked fries- manimal style of course- and that was good and quite filling. Lastly, we ordered some fish tacos (which came out to be around $4 a taco), which were perfectly crisp and flavorful.\n\nOverall, the food is quite good and the atmosphere is nice.

Keep in mind that if you're arriving after 9pm, you may have to wait in line outside for awhile.\n\nDrinks are worth the wait, though. (I recommend the \"Ain't No Sunshine\" for those with a penchant for sour tequila cocktails, and the \"Bad Girl\" for lovers of bubbles and gin.) The bartenders are troopers for being able to serve so many people at once. I was literally shoulder-to-shoulder with other patrons; one annoying man kept pushing into me, tilting my stool halfway off the ground. (I wouldn't have fallen because there were 5 other people holding me up from the other direction. Yes, it's that crowded.)\n\nMy friends and I arrived at 8pm and asked if they could make room in the eating area upstairs for a table of 6. (Sadly, they don't take reservations for dinner.) They said we'd have to wait around an hour; we ended up waiting for 2. One pleasant surprise after we were seated, though: the food, once ordered, arrives lightning-fast. And it was perhaps the best \"bar food\" I've ever had. We all shared the kale salad (decent flavors), the trick dog (shamefully indulgent burger-dog with creamy sauce and cheese), beef tartare (SO SO SO SO SO GOOD, my favorite thing on the menu), cracklins (crispy pork belly, rich and delicious -- may induce heart attacks if eaten too often), and thrice-cooked manimal-style fries (OMG salivating at the thought of eating these again). \n\nOverall had a great time. Would recommend heading over at 8pm at the latest, earlier if you want to eat. Also probably not ideal for big parties. Did I mention how much I LOVE the industrial decor? The drink menus, not so much. I heard they used to have amazing Pantone menus, but they've been redesigned as \"record albums\" -- not the easiest to read.

It was pretty crowded, which is to be expected on a Saturday evening at the new \"it\" cocktail joint.  Once I managed to slip and slide my way up to the bar so I could order a Baby Turtle, I was pretty much ignored by the \"mixologist\".  Waited about 10 more minutes and then hit the road through the back hallway and sat on the fountain with a nice beer at Central Kitchen.  I chalked this one up to being slammed on a Saturday night and everyone else south of Chestnut Street wanting to be there.\n\nWhich brings me to last night (03/27/2013) a Wednesday at 6:30.  We had reservations at flour + water at 7:15 so I though we'd give this place another shot, I'm always a sucker for a well crafted cocktail.  The place, as expected was bustling for a Wednesday but far less crowded then the previous Saturday night cocktail attempt failure.  We looked at the Pan-tone cocktail menu, decided on a Paper Moon and again a Baby Turtle...and just like the past visit started to wait and wait and wait.  And just like the past bailed after 10 minutes of watching the bartender methodically mix his creations. 0 for 2.\n\nI accept the fact that a lot of work goes into each drink, but take the 1 second to look up and notice the ever impatient, thirsty, soon to be ex-patrons and at least make eye contact.  This would inspire hope that you're at going to get to us soon.  \n\nI had a great deal of expectations for this place but 2 failed attempts at getting just one cocktail have brought me to a couple of conclusions:\n1. This place needs to staff up to the level to handle the crowd.\n2. Jay 'n Bee never disappoints.\n3. The fact that this place is associated with Central Kitchen and flour + water raise the expectations, it's time to live up to them.", "author": "Martin E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-24", "description": "Trick Dog is a good bar. You should go if it's not too far out of your way. I'm just only calling it A-OK out of some neurotic personal preferences of my own. This won't be my most \"objective\" review. Dispite being a good bar on all technical grounds, I don't think I'm a \"fan\", a guide for 4 stars I tend to take very literally. I tend to hate things that seem counter cultural in a forced way so...\n\nYou need to fix up the outside of your bar and hang a damn sign with your name on it. This is not Brooklyn circa whenever people cared about Brooklyn, and we are in the Yelp era. There are no hidden \"it\" spots for people \"in the know.\" The person who is \"in the know\" is anyone. And nestled into one hella gentrified block of the mission, your run down store front looks douchey (and hella 90s). You serve $11 cocktails, and your insulting your clientele by pretending that you are trying to get to something \"deeper\" than people who buy $11 cocktails. But that's just my read.  \n\nAbout the cocktails. I had a large carnivore theme for the night and ordered the Lion Heart and the Polar Bear.\n\nI really liked the Lion Heart. Mango paired with Scotch was both a new flavor for me and a cool play on the classic wisdom that whiskeys pair with stone fruits. It was balanced and drinkable, without lacking so much structure that you'd want to knock it back in one go. Almost a perfect cocktail.  \n\nThe Polar Bear didn't win me over as well. I think it's super clever and I'll go in on a super clever cocktail. Unfortunately it didn't taste all that great. I thought the mixture of cool mint and warm mezcal would be interesting (I'm also on a mezcal kick in general), and interesting it was...plus the minty white \"Polar Bear\" is cute. It just didn't taste very good. \n\nFurther note; bad door experience: The adage \"always keep a line\" should be amended to \"never keep a line of only two.\" I can respect a bar that doesn't want to be too crowded, but if you literally keep only two people waiting outside, you're pissing two people off and not really doing anything for the people inside. Cocktail culture shouldn't mix with technocrats.

It was just well-chopped, well topped and well-dressed from beginning to end. A great chew even for kale.\n- Manimal Style Fries: It started out great - ultra crisp potato job with good stuff on top, but I soon discovered the ratio was a little off and then it became a salty bowl of fries, possibly because we paired it with...\n- Crispy Duck Egg: A wonderful deep-fried egg surrounded by a sea of... oversalted beans. Maybe its the beans or maybe its the chorizo, but something about it made it unbearable for my salt sensors. It just made for an unsettling appetizer in my book. It's a shame because that egg had so much potential.\n\nWould I come here again? Yes, because I think I'll forgive salty beans one day and try other things on the menu.

Why? Because almost any bar/lounge/restaurant you will ever find yourself will carry the ingredients to make said cocktail. And though, decisively simple in nature, if you can mix up a sour that stands out from the crowd - bonus points & a tip of the hat to you. But if you hand me a sour without the egg white... well... i've already decided on the kind of place i've landed in.\n\nPlus, from many MANY test drives on this first impression theory, i've found that with the whiskey sour, a great bartender will always have a twist on it which gets the personality of service staff across pretty darn quick.  For example: \"Do you want a whiskey sour? Or would you like a vanilla bean, camomile & Jamesons sour? I call it The Unicorn.\" ... excuse me while I climb over the bar to bear hug you...\n\nSo did Trick Dog pass the test? They were ROCKIN busy the night we went in (well done for a Wednesday) and though there were no fun twists on the original, the sour I started off with came out in beautiful glassware and balanced just perfectly. One of those sours that you can down FAR too quickly and yet, are sorry when it's over. I kept having to remind myself I was with co-workers and not to get carried away. (pppffttt)\n\nThe bar list was obviously well thought out and the \"research related\" sips I stole from my cocktail buddies proved that the minds behind these mixes know what they're doing. Everything was pleasantly boozy, without being too harsh. A nice balance and throw back to my well loved classics.\n\nThe ambiance is nice - though I wish I had the sense to check out the space upstairs. But I would have much preferred it on a slower evening where I could curl into the bar. Getting bumped into every 3 seconds whilst holding a $12 doesn't really jive well with me.\n\nHowever, I could curl into those bar seats just about any day. And though we were only in for a quickie, I peeked Yamazaki behind the bar, which happens to be my new favourite whiskey and a pain in the butt to get in Vancouver, so I wager I could have spent a grand deal of time here if scheduling served.\n\nThe post-manager in me is screaming to make note of the menus - which were printed as Pantone swatches.

The cocktails tended towards the strong and heavy pour, but there were some lighter choices for the ladies. \n\nSome notable tastes of the night:\n\nFernet ice cream with cocoa nibs, wow\nMcNuggets with amazing spices\nWitchwood - Honey rum, sherry, etc. Strong(!) but with the aftertaste of maple. This was a favorite with the guys.\nBaby Turtle - Cinnamon-scented frothy egg whites\nNight Moves (my favorite) - Spiked coffee with cream and the surprising kick of curry. This one will keep you up all night.\n\nTIP: If there's a line, you can get in through the back by going through the restaurant next door... ;) Just find the path to the restrooms to the left of the restaurant's entrance.", "author": "Fawn B."}

The cocktails are great, the food, while being just small plates are worth the price, and if you want that nice, dark \"don't want to know what time it is outside\" feel, this place might just pull it off.

It's a little off the beaten path, but easily accessible from the Mission.  We arrived around 9 PM on a Thursday night and there was a good crowd!  Not so crowded I wanted to run away but enough people to feel like I had found the cool spot to be :P.  My friend told me that they are know for their great cocktails and I would have to agree!  With an adorable paint color- type menu, Pantone colors assigned to each drink and unique, fresh ingredients - you can't go wrong.  \n\nFirst, I tried \"Grandma's Sweater,\" which I loved!  It was sweet but decently strong and the fresh mint really added to the drink.  I also had a \"Baby Turtle\" which wins for most adorable name.

There are many strange and interesting combinations of flavors going on.  The bartenders are mixologists here mixing together beakers of this and that with eyedroppers of that and the other thing.  Basically drinks here will set you back around a minimum of $10 each.  This is a place that I might enjoy going to once in a while if I lived in this town and neighborhood, but certainly wouldn't be my go to place for drinks out on the town.\n\nI had the St. Elmo's Fire (I'm a fan of the movie) which was a combination of Denizen White Rum, Amaro Averna (an Italian liqueur), pineapple, coconut, allspice and lime.  It was a really refreshing drink, but before the woman finished the drink with a ton of ice there was maybe enough for 2 shots at the bottom. \n\nHopefully this doesn't sound like I'm trashing the place.  I did have a good time, but a place like this on a daily basis might be a bit out of my price range.

First off we had to wait a minimum of 20 minutes for the waitress to seat us, the entire 20 minutes we were staring at the 3 open tables waiting for us. Next, it took another 20 min for someone to ask us if we'd like a drink. Then once the drinks arrived and the food - it was just Meh - nothing to right home about. The drinks were tasty but unbelievably small - especially after what was now about an hour wait if you include, the table wait, the order wait, then the wait for the beverages themselves. \n\nHonestly - I won't be returning to Trick Dog - there are too many decent bars within a few blocks of it.

While the cocktail menu looked pretty interesting, and the drink menu in general was cool how it was in binder of 45's (records), I'm a beer guy so I wanted to sample some California brews. First I had a Mission Shipwrecked IPA, which is actually from San Diego. It was a solid IPA but at 9+%, I wasn't going to have too many of those. I switched to a Biere de Chocolat by SF's own Almanac Brewery. Those were pretty sweet and tasty. I was expecting to pay $8-$10 per beer being in SF, but they were actually only $6-$7 apiece.\n\nWe also sampled some appetizers: the pork cracklins ($6) were deliciously crispy and not too greasy. Also had some fries and the pickle board, which was good even though I don't really like pickles so it must be good. They seem to have a nice restaurant upstairs, the decor is pretty cool and bartenders were friendly. I'd go back if in the Mission District of the city again.", "author": "Jeremy B."}

Not only is it a clever touch, but a great way to remember what the hell you actually ordered.\n\nI'm sure this bar will be disparaged as pretentious.

Yet in San Francisco there are already many places where drinks of such high quality are served.\n\nThe nibbles I had were just fine: the charcuterie plate was nice, but its \"twist\" was dill pickle gel\u00e9e. That's a fancy way of saying dill pickle jelly. It tasted like dill pickle jelly. But that aside, it was a standard issue charcuterie plate. The fried brussels sprouts are fine, but I've had that same execution (with crispy sunchokes and bacon) elsewhere. \n\nAs far as decor, Trick Dog features most of the standard modern design cues: Edison bulbs, cement floors, as well as exposed wood and structural elements. But I do like how it has mezzanine seating.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of hype surrounding this place, at least early on, as all the seats were full at 8:30pm on a Sunday.\n\nIndeed, a trick dog.

I know that its opening has been a long time coming and, for me, well worth the wait. \n\nI met Josh Harris, one of three partners at Trick Dog, at The Hideout in the Mission while he was bar tending about 3 years ago. I had always admired Josh's skills behind the bar and had heard him speak about his concept for a bar that he wanted to open in the lower Mission with his friends/partners Jason Henton and Scott Baird (aka The Bon Vivants). \n\nThe interior is rustic and warm with a great mix of hand made light fixtures and furnishings. It also offers a bit of the industrial touch with its high ceilings and exposed beams. The vibe is very welcoming with a good sized bar on the lower level and tables on the loft level upstairs which are designated for eating. A very attractive and clever use of space was made part of their bar by having sliding walls that hold a great selection of spirits within them. The food menu offers some great comfort foods and a selection of healthier options like their kale salad which I love.\n\nThe service here is great and I'm always a huge fan of places that have the \"personal touch'.

If I had written this review after my first visit, this would probably be a 4 star review. However, after my 2nd visit for a friend's birthday party, I'm feeling a little less generous and going to round down to 3 stars.\n\nThe drinks are certainly the strong point of this establishment. The bartenders take their time to make them properly, and they've got some unique ones on the menu. However, I've definitely had hits and misses with them. Yes, drinks are largely a personal preference thing, but bottom line is that I'm still not happy if I'm paying $10+ for a drink I feel is \"meh.\" \n\nThere's also a small dining area upstairs, but if you don't get in during the first round, expect to wait a long time to get a table, or don't expect to get one at all. Plus side is that you can order your food downstairs and they'll bring it out to you. However, I feel a large portion of the food falls into the meh category as well. The Trick Dog especially so. I like how their signature namesake dish is unique in that it's a hamburger shaped to fit in a hot dog bun, but I honestly don't think I understand the practical purpose or benefit to this. The flavors and textures reminded of a fancy big mac. Not a bad thing in itself, but I'd rather pay big mac prices instead of Trick Dog prices then! :P A friend ordered the scotch egg, and after I tried a bite I agreed with their once again \"meh\" consensus. Thrice-cooked manimal style fries weren't bad, but not stand out either. Cracklins were definitely my favorite out of all the food I tried, which unfortunately isn't saying that much.\n\nLuckily the few times I've been here I haven't had to wait in line, but the line here can get long, and this small space gets pretty crowded.

My friends and I arrived about 4:00 and it was already steady. We found a nook at the bar and were immediately acknowledged by our bartender. Having drooled over the drink menu online for the past 5 days I knew where I wanted to start. \n\nFirst up:\n\n-Baby Turtle\n-Gypsy Tan\n-Pennies from Heaven\n\nAll of which were delicious, however the gold was claimed by the Gypsy Tan.  \n\nSecond:\n\n-Polar Bear\n-Night Moves\n-Pantone\n\nAll three of these will blow you away.  The way the Bon Vivants have figured out balance of flavor is astounding to me.  They have one of the best grasps on the subject. Not one of the six drinks was \"too\" anything (sweet, bitter, strong, etc).  Every one of these cocktails was balanced perfectly.  And very thoughtful in every aspect (smell, taste, color, presentation).  \n\nThe food:\n\nThe Burger: Perfection.  Nothing else to say about it other than make sure you order one. Perfect size, perfectly cooked, perfect secret sauce. Just perfect. \n\nCracklins: Little delicious crispy bites of pork belly amazing. \n\nBrussels Sprouts: These were cooked just the way I love them.  Not oily, not dry, not hard, not soggy.  The sunchoke chips and bacon round this dish out.  So tasty!\n\nFernet Ice Cream:  I'll admit I was a bit stand offish about this dessert choice thinking it was going to be some bitter tasting novelty. ORDER THIS.  The flavor of this ice cream is beyond and it is so silky smooth.  Hands down this is the best scoop of ice cream I have ever had.\n\nRight along with the Bon Vivants cocktails their food is the same: Balanced.  Pleasing to all the senses.\n\nThe overall experience was extremely pleasing.  Thank you so much to every member of the staff of Trick Dog for making that happen.

I like to call them the Baristas of the bar business. They put their heart and soul into every drink you order. Actually, they're NOT even drinks, they're MASTERPIECES. I like the fact that they put a lot of pride into every drink and they dont skim on anything either. It's quality out here!\n\nThere was a small line on a friday night and I wasn't complaining at all. It maybe gets 10 deep at most? Also, keep in mind this place has NO SIGN. So make sure you yelp it and google map it or else you'll pass it just like i did! \n\nBouncer at the door is not your usual bouncer. This guy is super chill. Well of course, dont mess around like a dumb drunk and you'll be fine\n\nWhat's also great is that they don't over pack it and there's no cover. The reason is that the drinks are such a master piece that it does take a bit of time to make so they want to make sure the place is not over-crowded and that theres breathing room for the guys making the drinks one by one. \n\nThey also serve food! some nice starts / appetizers. I was able to try the pork belly and it was pretty good. Deep fried and seasoned along w/ some nice buffalo / crystal hot sauce for dipping. It was so good but so bad for you though. Kale salad was a nice light snack especially because those shots of Makers Mark from yelper Winnie H. and Braden K. got. \n\nThis is a GREAT spot to chill and mingle on any given night. DONT expect this to be a bar to go binge drink and take shots til you black out and cant remember a thing and leaves you grasping for water at 6am in bed next to someone you dont even know. There is barely any music in here, so if you're looking to get smashed and chocolate-henny wasted while getting ratchet to some 2 Chainz, go hit up polk.", "author": "Kenny L."}

It was pretty crowded in the bar area, but having heard about how great the food was, we headed upstairs to for an early dinner. We ordered:\n\nFood:\nThe Scotch Egg- I liked the idea, but I think many people are fooled by the plating. Plus, the egg has a very fishy tasting layer between the egg and the breading. Nothing should every be fishy tasting. Even fish. Yuck. \nThe Trick Dog-A pretty solid burger, but it wasn't good enough to make me want to return here just for this one dish.\nCracklins- very good, but fried fat is not so hard to get wrong. \n\nDrinks:\nPennies from Heaven- interesting, but I only had one sip because it was too alcohol-tasting for me, but I am really not a big drinker, so I always feel very biased whenever I give a drink review.\nGrandma's Sweater- This was pretty good and balanced with the right amount of sweet, sour, and alcohol flavor. It didn't have the alcohol taste as much, but it was still a very strong drink! I drank about half and had to stop. \n\nOur food came out before the drinks, which no one ever likes, but I know the bar was busy downstairs. The service was okay, not really much to discuss there. Although, the waitress did apologize for the drinks coming out slowly. Overall, I thought this meal was disappointing and overpriced for what we had. I think if I had out of town guests who were more into scene and ambiance, I would bring them here, but this wouldn't be a place for me to return any time soon.", "author": "Victoria J."}

After walking about a mile, we realized we had actually walked right by the place... Of course, just like any good little hipster bar, there is no sign to indicate it's presence.\n\nAfter our somewhat long jaunt, we ordered a few drinks and were led upstairs to cozy into a table (we were also given no fuss for transferring our bar tab to our table +cool points to the staff!). We started with the Lion Heart cocktail... which was delicious, but a tad sweet for our liking.\n\nThen moved on to the Polar Bear and the Pantone (both of which we liked much more than the Lion Heart). Herby, refreshing, complex... Who would have thunk Beet Juice and Ginger would taste so good with Bourbon? (I'm hereby making some excitingly alcoholic revisions to my summer juice cleanse...)\n\nWith our second round of drinks, we also ordered the cheese spread and a Scottish egg. The cheese spread wasn't great and the veggies didn't look particularly fresh, however, the Scottish Egg was pretty tasty and was served quickly.\n\nAll in all, I think the atmosphere is nice, the wait staff was great, the drinks rocked...but the food can be easily beat in that neighborhood.\n\nWith 4 drinks and 2 appetizers, our bill came to $60.", "author": "Julia T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-06", "description": "Trick Dog, to me, is what I think of if I had to describe a type of bar you might not see outside of SF.  From the outside, it looks like a dilapidated building without any signs or indications there's a bar inside ... except for the sounds of the raucous crowd inside at 5pm.\n\nPeople have clearly discovered this place and yet it still it feels like a discovery.  The clever pantone drink menu is varied and populated with specialty cocktails.\n\nOur favorities:\n- Pennies from Heaven (Templeton Rye with sour apple liqueur and sherry) - complex and crisp.  \n- Pantone - (Four Roses Bourbon, Combier, Kummel, beet, ginger and lemon) - looks like a smoothie but also pleasantly complex with a taste of pepper that travels from your tongue to your throat.\n\nGood but a notch below:\n- Gypsy Tan (Rittenhouse rye with fernet, ginger and Erdinger Weissbier) - light and clean taste with some carbonation)\n- Baby Turtle (Tequila Ocho resposado tequila with grapefruit, cinnamon and egg white) - also nice but a little too sweet for my personal preference\n\nSkip:\n- Alligator Alley (Olive oil-infused bourbon) - way overpowering.  Felt like I was drinking diluted olive oil\n- Vintage Photo (Flor de Cana rum with banana liqueur) - tasted like medicine\n\nAfter a few hours, we actually decided to eat dinner upstairs, where there is waiter service and a few tables.\n\nStandouts in terms of food were the cracklins (fried pork belly pieces), the thrice-cooked fries and the Brawn tacos (with crispy headcheese which added a nice creamy and buttery texture).  The tartare was also good (not really raw but cooked sous-vide).\n\nThings that sounded better than they tasted were the kale salad (I love kale in general but thought it could have been more seasoned here or made in to kale chips instead), the scotch eggs (also love these in general but the version here was somewhat bland) and the trick dog (just ok).\n\nEven though it gets packed, I thought the service here was pretty friendly and attentive.", "author": "F.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-17", "description": "This review is for the restaurant upstairs. Downstairs bar area was very full, so we decided to eat and drink upstairs. First of all, it was freezing. The large windows behind our table were open, and even though I put my winter jacket on I was very cold. We asked to change our table, and noticed that many other patrons were complaining about the low temperatures (and some changed their seats as well). Secondly, our waitress. I do not want to smile more than the wait stuff in an attempt to get some warmness, when I spend tons of money to eat outside. Come on! You may have a hard day, but smile a little. Thirdly, The rose I ordered was served in a tiny glass, and it was less than 4 oz. for sure. Maybe they want to sell hard alcohol mainly; but, when you pay 14$ for a glass of wine, you are expecting a decent amount of wine. On the other hand, food was good. Kale salad was huge, tomatoes were delicious. Fish tacos were yummy. If you are planning to visit, bring your ski jackets, and order cocktails :)", "author": "Kristin S."}

I just have no tolerance for the line in the street.\" One minute later: We have to wait in line to enter Trick Dog. On the street, in the freezing cold. I try to convince my friend to go elsewhere but he really pushes to stay the course.\n\nWe were rewarded with a better-than-expected experience once inside the loud and overpacked place.\n\nThis is absolutely in my top 2 favorite places to drink right now, and they couldn't have nailed it better with these amazing, creative, well-thought-out cocktails. The small accompanying bar menu is impressive and perfect if you are not vegetarian. If you are vegetarian you probably crave another option or two. I personally covet that kale salad and hope it stays. I did venture to taste my friend's brussels sprouts (with bacon and sunchoke chips) and they were freaking amazing. Crispy and flavorful. A bacon-free option would be great to see. Thoroughly unimpressed with the mushroom hummus.\n\nBut oh, back to the cocktails! Worked through these, listed in descending order of preference: St. Elmo's Fire, Gypsy Tan, Straw Hat, Pennies from Heaven, Witchwood. ALL were well-balanced and delicious. I haven't tried the popular Baby Turtle yet. The green chartreuse/chocolate soda hiball is something...to experience. Kind of creepy, yet also delicious...like that weird ex you stayed with too long.\n\nSo why not 5 stars? See above. Street line. Often. Also the music is too loud. I feel sorry for the neighbors. And the service is a wee lacking, in that it can take multiple requests for water or a check before it shows. But it's friendly. They'll be seeing a lot of me.", "author": "Stephanie P."}

I found Trick Dog on Yelp, and it might be one of my new favorites. The atmosphere was perfect for us. The building is industrial, which is normal for the neighborhood, and I couldn't really see the sign if there was one but it appeared to be the only bar on that block.\n\nWe went on a weekday, so it's hard to tell how packed it gets on weekends. It was busy for a Thursday night, and there was plenty of room to stand, walk around, and even sit (always a plus).\n\nThe fact that the menus change in a creative manner was awesome. When we went, the menu was a map with drinks named after places around SF. I recommend the Painted Ladies. Deliciously sweet and refreshing like a mint moquito but less minty. I also had the Golden Fire Hydrant, which was good but not as unique in flavors.\n\nFor food, we had the fish tacos and fries (manimal style). Considering how dark it was, we could not figure out what the \"manimal\" was. Either way, both dishes were awesome. \n\nI knocked off a star based on service. We rarely saw the waitress before we were seated and while we were eating. Our drink order got lost at some point, and she didn't own up to it so that was a little weird. I'm lenient when it comes to service, and it's a bar/restaurant so I would lower my standards anyway. Getting a drink downstairs wasn't terribly difficult, and that's more important :)\n\nAlso, the person that made the menu on their mobile site needs to sell his/her services to every restaurant!

The kale salad is big enough to feed a small army. The trick dog is a must have. I didn't think I'd like the shrimp noodles since I'm not a shrimp fan, but was really glad I got them. Very reminiscent of chubby noodle in north beach and the marina. The flavor of the noodles was phenomenal with just the right amount of spice. The chicken nuggets are ehhhhhhh at best.

It never ceases to amaze me. I remember when they first ditched the famous Pantone styled menu and I thought \"well that was a bad idea\" How wrong have I been. Every change has been a feast for the eyes and the palette. I look forward to each time the season changes as it brings a new menu design along with a cocktail menu to pair with the time of year. Needless to say every time they make a change it's perfect every time. The thing that impressed me on my last trip is the bartenders.  Not that they never impressed me before but I've never really watched them dealing with customers. I'm pretty easy myself so it went unnoticed but this time I was at the end where I just happened to notice the back and forth between bartender and customer. It's amazing how well they all. (and I mean all of them) deal with the chaos of the bar along with mixing each drink with care and passion. It's an amazing to watch. The food has been spot on as usual during my trips and a number of the staff surprisingly remember me every time I'm there. \n\nI can't say enough amazing things about Trick Dog it simp.... wait I don't want to have to wait for drinks or deal with a line.

Anyways, we didn't mind the wait so we went back downstairs and my friend ordered drinks while we waited to be called. Some time goes by (I didn't bother to check the time but it didn't feel like 40 minutes) and we were called for our table and we follow our server upstairs.\n\nWe ordered the Trick Dog and split Manimal style fries. The Trick Dog is pretty good but I think I've had better burgers. The closest thing I can liken it to is a superior version of the Big Mac; better meat, better cooked, better bun, better sauce but the flavor profile is more or less the same as a Big Mac. I don't mean it as an insult by any means but it's the closest thing that comes to mind.\n\nThe Manimal style fries were really good, it had a mayo-based sauce that seems to have paprika and chili powder mixed in for a slight kick but not enough for it to be a significant with an added either lobster or crab flavor in there somehow. Whatever the case may be, they were really good, I definitely recommend them.\n\nI ordered a root beer as well and it was underwhelming. Maybe I was expecting something with more spice or a kick to it but this one just fell flat; it left a very bland aftertaste. It was definitely drinkable but I was expecting something more than a generic root beer taste.\n\nOver all, I enjoyed my experience here but perhaps my expectation was more than it should have been leaving me with wanting more.", "author": "Richard C."}

Dropped in on opening night and immediately felt like I'd been here all my life. The ambiance of the place is reminiscent of times past where welcoming one with gracious warmth and hospitality was the standard. The lighting was perfect and the funk they were playing was catchy and smooth. It's obvious these boys did their homework and knew exactly what they wanted you to feel.\nThe place was filling up fast so my friend and I stepped over to the bar and took a look at the drink menu. Now when I first saw the menu on the bar I though for sure it was a paint matching deck that one of the painters had absentmindedly left behind. And when I commented to my friend as such she said, no I believe that's the drink menu. Upon further inspection I realized that indeed it was the drink menu. Wow, the Bon Vivants really went outside the box with this one. But I shouldn't expect less from these guys. The menu was great being made to be a Pantone swatch book with one cocktail per page. Being a lover of the agave I opted for the \"Baby Turtle\" first with is Tequila Ocho (one of my faves), Campari, grapefruit, cinnamon and lime. My friend had the Paper Moon made with Hangar 1 Vodka (another fave) some house made concoction and lime. We watched the bartender craft each cocktail in these really cool looking industrial beakers. He seemed to know exactly what he was doing and although very busy was acknowledging everyone with a smile and a greeting. It seemed there were a few \"industry folks\" in there despite the early hour. Maybe it's a Monday thing and the pros are off work. Anyways he served us our cocktails in some very cool looking glassware and lo and behold the drinks were delicious. The Bay Turtle was balanced with equal bitterness and that fruity agave taste that I crave. My friend was equally blown away with the Paper Moon. We switched cocktails and both agreed they were delicious. I could have finished hers but I wanted my agave back.\nWe decided to get a bite since neither of us were going to be leaving for a while so after perusing the menu (seems like a good selection of bar food that would not be out of place in any high end restaurant). I spied the Scotch Egg and the Sweetie McNuggets and knew I had to try them both. Oh My god I wasn't disappointed. Now I haven't seen a Scotch Egg on a menu in a very long time and I've probably only had one once in my life and if you don't know what it is, Google it. The way Trick Dog does it is a semi hard boiled egg (yolk is still slightly runny) wrapped in Brandade and fried. SERIOUSLY NOW. Amazing. I want to get two with some bread and make the mother of all sandwiches. But that's just me. And the Sweetie McNuggets are deep fried breaded sweetbreads. Once again BLOWN AWAY. Since we were doing so much fried food and the diet had completely gone out the door we decided to go healthy and ordered the Kale salad to balance it out. That too was delicious with bits of avocado and grated cheese and just perfectly dressed. I could've had two of everything.\nAt this point things were starting to get very busy and we were getting buzzed having also tried Grandma's Sweater and a Polar Bear. Both of which were stellar gin and mescal cocktails respectively also expertly made. After having a few shots of tequila things started to get fuzzy so we paid our bill, thanked our bartender and started to head towards the door. At least 4 members of the staff said good bye and thanked us on our way out once again showing that warmth and hospitality feeling I had spoken about earlier. What a breath of fresh air this place is. I went back on Thursday and had a similar experience. I'll be back again soon to try out some of the other dishes and cocktails. I'll keep you posted. Thank you Trick Dog.", "author": "Bill H."}

The service has always been very attentive and friendly, even when we went in looking kinda scrubby and not-so-trendy-hipster. It's also in a very cool area of the Mission - surrounded by some down and out areas, it's a bit of a diamond in the rough. Clean and trendy with a hint of SoMa modernism. Trick Dog is right next to flour+water, so it's an ideal spot to have a pre-dinner cocktail. \n\nThe only downsides to Trick Dog would be the seating. They've got bar seating up against the bar (obviously), as well as bar seating against the adjacent wall. The rest is just standing room. I really wish the upstairs seating section was for bar patrons, and not just for people ordering some small fare after 5 pm. I generally don't like to stand for an extended period of time with a little fancy glass filled with nectar of the gods. After my first drink, I'd like to take a seat with my second one and spend some quality time instagramming it, not to mention being able to give the dogs a bit of a rest.", "author": "Matt S."}

The vibe in the small industrial-warehouse-turned-bar was good but not great. I actually found the music odd (country). There are is also very little seating, which I assume makes sense when the place is more busy. Finally, every drink is at least $12, and in most cases have less tha 8 oz of liquid.\n\nWith all that griping out of the way, I will say that the drinks are pretty darn awesome. I had the Evil Woman, which is probably the most interesting drink of my life. I never would have thought Chile Liqueur would work in a drink, but it was great. My wife's drink also really good.\n\nAll in all, I'll probably go back here if invited by a friend, but can't imagine myself suggesting it to friends for a night out drinking.

It might be a fine bar if you get there at opening time and snag a bar stool. Otherwise there is no way to get the attention of the staff. Like one of the other reviewers here, we waited a good half hour, talked to various people, tried jumping up and down ... nothing worked. It was clearly hopeless: once people are sitting at the bar, there's no way they're going to leave until they're through with dinner and several drinks. Ideas for the management: either get rid of the bar stools so people will move around and customers can get up to the bar to order eventually, or add table seating and servers.", "author": "Susan G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-09", "description": "Happened into this bar while waiting on a table at Central Kitchen. I had no idea of the name at the time. No sign which is weird and silly. Good drinks (even the egg white one) and a fantastic atmosphere. I love the industrial design. At some point we went out to smoke, and had a lovely chat with the doorman. Despite other reviews, he was very nice and did not give us any issues coming in and out. The bar area is small and was crowded as expected on a Saturday night, but we still enjoyed it.\nDownside of this place is they are cool and they know it. The bartender was excellent at preparing our drinks, but was visibly annoyed when we did not order them according to their \"album name.\" Now about those albums..... Apparently Trick Dog is known for their creative ways of presenting the menu and we were there during the time that the menu was a book of 45's. This seriously sucked for a couple of reasons. It's pretty dark in there. Very hard to read the labels on a 45 in the dark. Song titles on a 45 are small, now make them a title plus recipe. Impossible. Then the albums kept falling out when you tried to turn the page. Very glad to hear they have since come up with a new menu design.\nOverall, Trick Dog has good drinks (although pricey) and great ambiance which is what one looks for in a bar. However, I must remove a star for pretentiousness. Being a cool bar does not mean you should give the customers attitude and a difficult menu. Get over yourself and just be great.", "author": "Rachel D."}

I waited for about 15 minutes till I got the drink.  The wait's party due to the large number of people there but mostly because some drinks take forever to make.  I was looking to get a Baby Turtle but it apparently takes about 5-10 minutes to make so I settled for a lime concoction. Luckily, the crowd is great and pretty good at striking random conversations.\n\nCome here if you want to try something different--not all the time, but for some special, spontaneous occasion.

The verdict: HOLY YUM! In order of favorites, the cauliflower was the winner - that brown butter puree ladled on top is simply sinly - but the kale salad was a seriously close second (what with the unique egg yolk dressing, ample avocado and pepitos, and good-quality parmesan, it ain't no ordinary salad, that's for sure). We were too full for dessert, unfortunately, but I suppose that could also be a good sign that there food is fabulous. Oh, hold on, I can't forget to mention the rice plate: This dish was actually a nice sunrise; I was expecting your run-of-the-mill fried rice, but this rice was super special.. It came in the shape of a small brick, and it was super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I like a good yin-yang like that ;-) On top of the good food, I recommend Trick Dog for it's ambiance: the loft-style windows in the upstairs dining area are awesome, and they play legit music. \n\nSide note: If you go to Trick Dog before 7pm, pop into the Salumeria deli and larder next door: they have some fabulous, upscale food to buy, and my adorable friend, Maddie, works there, so shoot her a smile!.", "author": "Hannah C."}

Despite having 4 condiments, they all worked together, or separately as I toured my plate.\nThe Manimal Style Thrice-Cooked Fries had me worried with their pallid color, but they were crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and of course, covered in nouveau Thousand Island and some sort of dark and mysterious stand in for caramelized onions that I thought were seaweed, and my boyfriend thought were, well, caramelized green onions.  I concede that he's probably right.  Despite losing that bet (anyone feel free to back me up) this was the best thing I ate that night...and the week before.\nThe Shrimp Cocktail was a bit scant--4 shrimp in a wee dish with a spoonful of horseradish and a spoonful of their smoothly ketchup-like bloody mary mix.  While not for lovers of chunky, iced, old school Shrimp Cocktail, this dish is for lovers of raw shrimp--sweet, mild and tender.\nI would never have ordered the rice plate, but for chicken-lovers and traditionalists, this little dinner of a deep fried rice block and tender chicken thighs is for you.\nLast was the Trick Dog.  If you want an amazing, artery-clogging burger and fries, come to Trick Dog and get a Trick Dog and Thrice-Cooked Fries. While it is it's own tomato-less (and virtually lettuce-less) beast of high percentage meats, cheese and creamy sauce, when combined with the perfect fries, this could be the best burger dinner in town.  Just add a cocktail.\nThe cocktails veered a little farther from their ancestors...and were a little less palatable.  All pretty and creative, each tended to be overwhelmed by a token flavor.  The Mr. Big Stuff tasted like sunscreen (coconut).  The Evil Woman had the dark spice of dried chiles, and little else.  The Ain't No Sunshine was overpowered by the coffee liquor, there was one that tasted like burning rubber (mezcal), and there was even one that just tasted like lemon juice.*\nI'm not a whiskey drinker, but the Bankrobber was my favorite of the night.

I can't even tell you how delicious this is! Go and try it!  My friends also had two delicious and colorful concoctions.

The wait time at the bar is LONG... Still, we were having a good time, up until the \"unfortunate incident\"... Daytime on Sunday, 6 people in our group. We ordered a bunch of food and we each had our drink (after already finishing a couple before). We were downstairs, in the \"open\" area. The place was starting to get crowded. We had our space on the counter, where our group was hanging out. We stepped outside to smoke (bad habit!) and left our half-finished food and drinks. We returned to find it all gone, and they gave the space to another group. WTF?! Naturally, we complained. One guy said he'll go talk to someone. So we wait... And wait... Finally, I go up to one of the bartenders who looks like she might be \"in charge\". She gives me attitude, like she has no idea what I'm talking about. The guy who we originally spoke with happens to be passing by. I grab him, and he hesitantly confirms our story. She goes to talk to another bartender. They call over the waiter who cleaned our space. The three of them deliberate for a while. We are still waiting, feeling pretty stupid at this point. Finally, she returns and, acting like they are doing us a HUGE favor, says that they will replace our drinks. OK, great! Except, when they bring them, they're like 20% full... Their excuse: your drinks weren't full when we took them! REALLY?! You effed up, and now you are going to add insult to injury?! And we weren't even asking for our food back! I have NEVER been treated like that, anywhere! I don't care how \"hip\" your place is, that's called being rude! Had they apologized and brought us a full round on the house, like any decent place would have, we would've stayed and kept ordering. We weren't ready to leave yet. But, needless to say, we did. We quickly finished their \"drinks\" and closed our tabs. Each of us left ZERO tip. Some chose to write a few choice words on their bill. I will never go back here.

It may not be as frustrating to people if it was at a lounge where you can really just sit down and enjoy the ambiance and the company of others.\n\nCons--Horrible customer service from the 2 male servers, especially the hipster with a pony tail and fake black rim glasses. He was extremely rude...we saw him physically pushing people out of the way and screamed something along the lines of \"coming through\" as he squeezed his way through. My friend was taking a picture of me + my pineapple drink (it's the one inside a pineapple cup!) and he walked right through it and mumbled something...probably something rude. It's loud and crowded, we understand that. You are just doing your job. We know. But, if you hate your job, don't take it out on your customers.

Maybe try, \"Unfortunately, due to the limited amount of space, we only seat parties for full dinner\". \n\nThere are a lot of bars in the neighborhood and customer service really makes or breaks it for most San Franciscans.

Between my friend and I we tried the Trick Dog, the Scotch Egg, and a pickle board. I would recommend getting the pickles to munch on throughout the night as it is a decent portion. The Trick Dog is basically a hot dog-shaped burger. SO DELICIOUS. I wouldn't recommend sharing this unless you are prepared to fight for the last bite.

The bartenders are knowledgable and they serve tasty and pleasantly priced food late which I appreciate.  Whether you just want a quality shot and a beer for a well made cocktail this is a great bar.", "author": "Colin G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-22", "description": "they have a scotch egg on the menu. my husband is english, and while this isn't the first time we've run across scotch eggs around here, it's still a pretty exciting discovery!\n\n...except it's soft-boiled.  this, i gather, is a bit like finding out that someone's put bleu cheese creme inside the twinkie you're just about to eat, or you bought a slim jim and discovered as you bit into it that it's actually grape soda flavored - ultimately maybe that shit's tasty but dude! wrong!\n\nanyway this menu discovery sparked spirited debate amongst my husband and his pals. discussion of northern vs. southern scotch egg styles and concepts like nonciness were thrown around, but ultimately an uneasy consensus was reached in slight favor of soft-boiled scotch eggs, since, after all, the folks running trick dog can choose to push boundaries however they like. \n\nfive stars because we didn't actually order the scotch egg or discover the soft-boiled aspect of it until we reviewed the menu online later. had he ordered it and had it come as a nasty shock to british sensibilities, who knows what our rating would've been.", "author": "m l."}

Make your way around the color wheel in a vibrant and comfortable local atmosphere. I'm sold on the drinks, need to find up if the kitchen is at the same level.", "author": "Irwin K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-24", "description": "Awesome, all around. Really friendly staff, very well-balanced creative cocktails (I make cocktails for a living) and don't overlook the food. The trick dog is the best burger I've had in a long time, and the fried green tomatoes were perfect. Good job Trick Dog. I'll be back.", "author": "jeff w."}

They were delicious!  Even my highly discriminating whiskey swilling companion was impressed.  Glad there is a good cocktail place in this neighborhood.  Haven't tried the food, but I want to!", "author": "Kelly H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-11-27", "description": "Between 3 and 4 stars, depending on what you value more.  The atmosphere was good and the overall bar experience was fun.  That's the 4 star side of things.  The food and drink was the 3 star.  3 star doesn't mean bad - it just means it was not as good as other places nearby and I wouldn't go back specifically for that.  The trick dog was okay, but not as good as the slider we'd had at Asiento about 30 minutes before.  The beef tartare he liked, but I didn't because it was so heavily herbed/spiced that I could barely even tell there was beef in there - the herbs were overwhelming the flavor.  First time I've ever not eaten all of my share of a beef tartare.  Scotch egg was interesting.  Tasted fine, but didn't really seem to go together all that well.  I'm glad I tried it once, but I don't need to have it again.  Drinks were fine.  Creative, but not always as well-balanced as you might expect.", "author": "L C."}
