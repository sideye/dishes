It was still early in the evening and the place hadn't really picked up yet, but we loved the mood and the unbeatable views overlooking Union Square. \n\nWe got to talking to the host, Robert, who is awesome and a huge reason this lounge is getting five stars. He was warm, friendly and encouraged us to come back the next night a little later in the evening when the DJ would be in. \n\nWe returned the next night about 9:45 and the atmosphere was definitely more lively. This lounge seems to cater to a diverse range of people. It isn't just a \"hip, young\" establishment; we saw plenty of patrons well over 30 years old there. It has a bit of a more classy, cabaret sort of feel with the large, red velvet booths and lighting. The DJ was fine, most people stayed on the floor and the selection of music was good and the atmosphere maintained without much lull. \n\nOne thing I will say that counted against this spot is the staffing. The night we came they seemed VERY understaffed and the waiters were running around like headless chickens trying to get to all their guests. There was a wait for a table and after we were seated my partner and I waited a bit to be seen. Fortunately, the host, Robert, went above and beyond bringing us waters and my partner's drink orders, checking in on us, and making sure we were taken care of. We ended up having a wonderful night and will absolutely return when back in San Francisco.", "author": "Kate H."}

We walked in Thursday, June 28th around 11:30pm. I believe it was close to closing, so we easily found a small table by a window.\n\nWe were here for less than an hour, so just grabbed one round of drinks. We got a Bud Light, I believe a Jameson & Ginger, and a bottle of Acqua Panna. (I didn't get the round, so not sure of pricing.) The views are nice. I believe it's on the 21st floor, so you have a nice view of the city. The vibe here is very old school and throwback. Even the booths feel like they are from a different decade. I think they normally have live music, but since they were closing soon, it was rather quiet. I didn't mind since I just wanted to enjoy the view.\n\nA good quick stop. I haven't been here in close to a decade, so it was fun revisiting an old spot.", "author": "Elena N."}

We were staying at the hotel and took advantage of the \"free cover\" before 8. \n\nWe initially walked up to grab a drink and check out the dance area. I ordered a gin and tonic which was average, to say the least (kinda watered down) and a wine. \n\nWe also ordered some chips with a french dip (kinda tasted funky) and some sweet potato fries (delish). \n\nThe views are spectacular. Almost a 360 view of the city with glimpses of fireworks from the distance on certain days.\n\nThis was a mixed crowd with a mixed vibe. Some people were having dinner, others just drinks, and other others here for the dancing part...that was interesting. They have a dance floor and a dj I believe, it just seemed like a random combo. \n\nI'm not from the area and many locals recommended this place so worth checking out if staying near Union Square.", "author": "Adelina M."}

The show itself was great, so this review is about the billing experience.\n\nWe went online and checked out availability for the show on October 21. Tickets were available, so I purchased them. But when I got the confirmation, it said the tickets were for October 28. I immediately called the Starlight Room, repeatedly. I finally spoke to a human being, who said this was the responsibility of the vendor, CrowdTorch (Vendini). I called them and learned that they wouldn't open until the following Monday. So I went back online, used a different credit card to avoid confusion, and successfully purchased two tickets for Sunday the 21st.\n\nWhen I finally heard back from Vendi, they told me the opposite of what Starlight had said, and told me to contact the Starlight Room directly. So I called back yet again. I was told that the manager would reverse the charge for the tickets, and I was forwarded to her extension. I got her voicemail, left her a detailed message, and that was it. I never heard back.\n\nBecause it was evident that the Starlight Room was more than happy to have me pay double for the show, I disputed the charge with my credit card company before the 28th. I thought that might get the Starlight Room's attention, and it would also open up some more tickets for them to sell legitimately. Nope.\n\nThis means we paid nearly $350 for a drag brunch, before alcohol and tips. The unprofessionalism with which we were treated was inexcusable, and unless there's new management, we won't be back.", "author": "Brian B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-03", "description": "This review is specifically for \"Sunday's a Drag,\" a Sunday brunch buffet located in the top floor of The Starlight Room near Union Square. The decor is about as tacky as they come, but it certainly fits with the vibe of the performers and the show. \n\n\"Sunday's a Drag\" is an opportunity for you to be graced by the presence of some fabulous, vibrant, and colorful drag queens. I could not recommend this experience more. The cost of $60 per person is well worth it for the food accompanied by an unforgettable show. The main hostess, Donna, will have you laughing with her corny drag jokes, her sultry singing voice, and details of her colorful personal history. The other drag queens will strut their stuff and sing and dance and interact with the audience and have you laughing your butt off.\n\nNow, if you are a stiff, I am not sure why you would even be reading my review of Sunday's a Drag. Just stay home. But if you are comfortable with the possibility of some drag queen intimacy, then wake up and show up to Sunday brunch. If you want the \"full\" experience, make sure you grab a seat right around the stage. But even if you don't, you are not safe! The drag queens definitely make their way around the whole seating area to make sure everyone gets their own personal interaction. ;-)\n\nMy husband was in the hottest seat of them all, being the only man seated around the stage, and also being directly next to the steps from the stage to the seating floor. He got many drag queen tits in his face, a kiss on the lips, a lap dance, and more. My glasses managed to have drag queen lipstick all over them. We were laughing the whole time. Highly recommended for something different or if you are just into drag. It's a great, intimate show. An unforgettable experience! Do it.\n\nThat said, the food isn't that good. But you're not there for the food. For reference, I am a true foodie and still recommend this brunch. If I were providing a star rating based on food alone, I would provide 2 stars. The experience is a 5 though. So overall, a 4.", "author": "Chelsea S."}

The bride had pre-paid for all of us to gain entrance, and we were all given wrist bands. Apparently the people who sold the wrist bands had not communicated with the incompetent \"bouncer\" manning the entry on September 20, 2014. \n\nAs guests of the wedding poured out of the elevators, all wearing wristbands, this \"bouncer\" proceeded to swear at us, using incredibly rude and foul language, and humiliate us. There is never a reason to swear at a customer.\n\nHey dude, did you ever think to speak nicely to guests or ask management what was going on? Guess not. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later we were finally let in, turns out the wristbands were pre-paid! Oops! They made a mistake, no apology was offered. \n\nWe proceed to go in and sit down and unmarked tables, ready to order drinks. We saw other tables marked reserved, so obviously didn't sit at those. Another incredibly rude staff member stomps over, treats us like 10 year old children, yelling at us to get up and move. The flippen BRIDE on her WEDDING NIGHT was sitting there, but still yelled at and made to move, no reason given. (?)\n\nAfter that, I chose to leave. No place that treats me like that is going to get any of my $. I just feel bad for my friend, the bride, who had a gorgeous and amazing wedding prior to the Starlight Room. She shouldn't have to put up with that kind of crap on her wedding night, especially when she had previously pre-paid for her wedding guests to gain entry. \n\nI would rather have my eyeballs gouged out with a hot metal spoon than return here.", "author": "Melissa J."}

I also tried the chicken and waffle, a veggie omelet, a truffled deviled egg, some roasted red potatoes, a scone with sweet butter & jelly, maybe a lil chocolate & dark chocolate cake and some chocolate covered strawberries DON'T JUDGE! It was my birthday damnit and I was starving haha. \n\nTo drink, had water, coffee and a Bellini, the Bellini was perfect, went well with brunch. \n\nThe show was great, I enjoyed it, there were 4 acts all together, and everyone did a great job. I loved the outfits; saw a few that I should flaunt haha. Just a great show for a Sunday afternoon.

Although I'm pretty done with the city view, I thought the effort he put into this evening was admirable. I went along.\n\nPARKING\nGood luck. San Francisco parking is horrid.\n\nLOCATION\nStarlight lounge is located inside at the very top of Sir Francis Drake hotel. No sign or markings outside of that Sir Francis Drake hotel unless you had been there before or the physical address is in hand. \n\nOnce inside there are signs to direct you to the Starlight Lounge. It can be easily missed if you don't tend to read signs with small fonts or simply just too intoxicated to bother.\n\nINTERIOR\nClassy. The decor, deep red/black/grey, dimmed lighting creates an intimate ambiance. It's a small and long lounge where with about 70 people you can easily fill the place up.\n\nCover charge (not sure it's the same every night) is $20 per person. The only reason I know this is because my date paid for us and it was the first time I actually worried about the entry fee (perks of being an club photographer at places where you know the owners)\n\nUpon your entry, you face a long and most busy bar. On your right (and of the bar) you have the restrooms. Once you walk down the long lounge you will find seatings/dining tables on your left and right. There is a small corridor on the left hand side that leads you to the dance floor near the DJ booth (which I have to mention trained wrecked last night 8/15/15).\n\nIf you decide to continue straight rather than take the corridor lounge/booth area, you will eventually hit the dance floor anyways. From there, you can already see the view of San Francisco city. \n\nI was informed that the bar next to the dance floor is a new addition (since last year).\n\nWhat I first notice when I walked in was how warm it was. I knew instantly that the lounge had no ventilation and perspiring before I hit the dance floor was a guarantee. Make a mental note: great time to wear less clothing if possible.\n\nSERVICE\nI did not encounter the staff very much, but the security and bartenders all seem pretty professional, fast and warm. No complaints there.\n\nMUSIC\nI was too preoccupied with my date, but I can definitely remember how horrible the DJ was. I sure hope he's not a resident there, otherwise I'd be sure to avoid this spot at all cost.\n*Smooth Transitioning did not exist in this DJs skills.\n*song selection would've been okay if he didn't kept playing the remixes/bootlegs rather than keeping to the originals (wouldn't hurt to play the originals rather than all remixes)\n*I wonder if they know anything about bpm?\n*and if I remembered correctly, there was both opener and closer (what are the chances to bomb with both DJs; I'm not sure if the DJs that spun on this night was selected by a promoter or a Director of Marketing, but let's try to invest a little more $$ for a more talented DJ and I know there are plenty in the bay will accommodate to your budget. Expand your horizons yo!)\n\n(Luckily, I don't base my ratings on the DJ- otherwise I would give this place a 1 star)\n\nVERDICT\nIt was an fun night. The company I was with made it fun. I wish i could've danced more, unfortunately the music transitions made by the DJ(s) was so off beat (and often sounds like it was thrown in randomly) that I couldn't dance for no more than 30 seconds that I spent most of the night standing and talking and sitting down and talking.", "author": "Cathy N."}

It was surreal having a glass of champagne, and dancing high above a beautiful and foggy San Francisco below. I made a post on facebook about our experience, and to my surprise, the social media person for Starlight Room commented on my post, congratulating our production, and invited me to reach out next time, saying that I would be added to the guest list. \n\nWell, backstage, the night before our last performance, I asked my fellow cast members if we'd like to go again after our last show, to celebrate our successful 11 show run, and all were enthusiastic! \n\nI sent a message via facebook, this was very, very late in the wee hours of Friday night/Sat morning, and again to my surprise, I received a very kind and enthusiastic reply right away, welcoming our group and inviting me to email Linh Pham, director of food and beverage for Sir Francis Drake Hotel to work out details for my group. I requested a table, and a few bottles of champagne for our group, and sent a list of our guests, Linh's reply was so kind, I just had to include it below:\n\n\"Good evening Katherine,\n\nThank you so much for reaching out and contacting me about joining us on what sounds like such a momentous occasion.  First of all congratulations on such a successful run we are honored you have thought of us to celebrate again.  We look forward to hosting you and your guests.  We will absolutely extend our deepest curtesy and have express entry to all of your guests.  I personally will reserve a table for your arrival. I am on site tomorrow and will handle your reservation personally.  If for any reason you need any additional assistance or request please do not hesitate to reach out to me on my cell.  Again congrats on a great run, break a leg on the closing and get ready to have an amazing night. \"\n\nLinh made me feel like a dear friend in every communication, I was touched that he went so far as making his cell phone available to me, and made me feel in every communication, that I felt completely welcome, valued, and that our group would be cared for at every turn! \n\nThat night, I put on my favorite little black satin dress, my favorite dancing heels, our group walked from the theatre to Union Square, and as we looked up, we could see a glimmering star atop the Hotel, and that is the disco ball of the Starlight Room! \n\nI had been given a bouquet of roses earlier that evening, so as we walked, we handed out some to strangers on the street. \n\nWe took the elevator up, I was greeted by name at the door, \"Oh! Yes, you're Katherine from the show!\" on Saturday nights there is a coat check, so as we checked our coats and bags, our table was already prepared, the size of our group had changed from the original plan, but the staff rolled so smoothly with the change that it was as if we had originally planned that number of people. We were escorted past the beautiful bar and large black grand piano to a gorgeous table with tall velvet seats the deep romantic red color of rose petals, and much to my surprise, my jaw dropped to the floor, because the talented pastry chef at Sir Francis Drake had prepared a huge, gorgeous cake, complete with the lettering \"Congrats on a Great Run!\" \n\nI will try to post photos here, and you can see more on my instagram: @unhasoo. \n\nMy fellow cast member turned to me, and said something along the lines of, \"I feel like we're with George Clooney!\"\n\nThe beautiful and delicious cake was a generous and unexpected gesture that was so appreciated by us. We were in total shock and awe at the hospitality shown to us. \n\nOur waitress and every staff member was attentive, lovely, all handsome, beautiful, sweet people. \n\nWe sipped champagne, danced, Linh introduced himself to me, and I had the opportunity to thank him and the staff for making our night so memorable, and he told me about their upcoming direction for amazing performance experiences and exciting programming, which I anticipate will be magnificent too see come to life. \n\nThe view on the dance floor is breathtaking. We met nice people in town from all over the world, people of all ages. \n\nI had a few roses left in my bouquet, so I gave one to our waitress, one to another manager, the woman at coat check, and to a few other guests at Starlight Room. \n\nI cannot think of a more romantic place in all of San Francisco to smile, and celebrate with the people I love most. \n\nThank you, Linh and every one at Starlight Room!", "author": "Katherine P."}

One has expectations of wonderful service and classic, well made cocktails.\n\nNot what we experienced at all.\n\nWe went up the The Starlight Room after seeing Wicked on Saturday night. First there was a $10 cover charge to get into the bar, which we paid, since we weren't ready for our night to be over. They took away our half empty bottles of water and said we couldn't bring them in. Ok, ok - they don't want anyone sneaking in booze let alone water that they can overcharge for.\n\nThe place was hopping. There were a couple different parties going on along with loud dance music. The music was great. It was turned up just one notch too high, though. And the DJ never even played a full song - 15 to 30 seconds of each song. Too sporadic.\n\nI ordered drinks from the bar for 4 of us. $50 (pre tip) later, we went off to find a table, which we found. Hurrah!\n\nHalfway through our cocktails, my husband puts his hand close to the candle and asks, \"what's this?\" Considering how dark it was, it took us a minute to realize it was a dirty (bloody) band-aid that he had pulled out of his cocktail.\n\nAfter we all gagged for a moment, we got up to leave. We couldn't get anyone's attention to discuss, so we walked back up to the door to discuss with gentleman taking everyone's cover charge. We left our cocktails on the table as we weren't touching them again.\n\nWe showed him the bloody band-aid and told him what happened. All he asked was, \"where's the drink?\" When we told him they were on the table, he shrugged and just did not give a crap.\n\nWe walked out after paying $100 for what? A horrible, disgusting experience and truly poor customer service. But I guess if you are The Starlight Room on the 21st Floor of the Sir Francis Drake, you don't have to give a damn because people will still show up.\n\nWe went across the street to our hotel bar, where we had a great time without disgusting band-aids in our drinks and staff who seemed genuinely interested in all of us having a good time.\n\nAnd no, I will not be returning to The Starlight Room.

Great service (Colette was wonderful), great drinks, excellent music and dancing to truly spectacular views are the perfect elements to add up to a great time! The dance floor was very hot (as in steamy, as in there was actually evaporating water collecting on the glass windows) but it was roomy enough to accommodate the crowd comfortably and offered lots of energy. \n\nSomething we noticed and truly appreciated was the eclectic mix of groups enjoying themselves here. The club brought together a veritable plethora of different races, ethnicities, ages, socio-economic status, body shapes and sizes, orientations and I'll bet there were even some vegetarians there! Seriously, from the very well dressed sexy people (of many races) to the break dancing older Korean gentleman at the next table to the group of large women in tight dresses to the couple that looked like they wandered off a farm, it took all types and all types were having a blast at this modern day speakeasy!\n\nVery reasonably priced by comparison and well worth it, if you have a special night to celebrate, this is a highly recommended place to do it. The staff was perfectly dressed, styled and tempered to give the feel that among their ranks were Greta Garbo, Jessica Rabbit, all band members of the Big Bad Voo Doo Daddies, a young Jack Nicholson and every cool guy and girl you knew in high school.

I figured, if nothing else, it is on the 21st floor and should have some great views. \n\nBeing a Saturday night, they had a DJ and a cover. Be prepared to pay 10 bucks or 5 if you show your room key. This is certainly a place for a slightly older crowd looking for a fun club experience. I'd say most people were like me and over 30. You could tell they recognize this by the extensive bar selection that had plenty of quality liquor. While tempted by one of the 5 varieties of Macallan, I stuck with simple Hendricks and tonics. I got the same bartender each time and he gave great service and was practically pouring my drink by the time I'd reach him on each trip. Prices were typical of a hotel at $9.\n\nOverall, this place has an old school lounge feel with plenty of felt booths, but I spent most of my time on the medium sized dance floor with an energetic crowd and DJ. The views are great, but not worth doing if they have a cover. If I'm looking for a place to dance the next time I'm in SF, I'd certainly come back, but would look to some place like Bourbon and Branch if all I was seeking was a cocktail lounge.", "author": "Zach C."}

Of course, it all comes at a higher price but with the scenic view and fun music it's a great once in awhile splurge and great spot to hang with friends. \n\nThe food there is actually quite good. I tasted their fried Mac n cheese and their chocolate dessert and liked both. Portions are small so don't come with an appetite! As for the drinks I wasn't quite sure what to get so our waitress made a pretty good recommendation for me based on my likes. I forgot what it was but I enjoyed it :) FYI the menu on their website isn't always up to date and one time they did not have the ice cream on their menu that I wanted to try so you could be in for a bit of a disappointment.\n\nThe crowd is definitely older but the parties thrown by outside promoters bring in younger people so you'll get a good mixed crowd on those nights. It could get really packed and when it does good luck flagging down your waitress! We were ready to pay our bill and head out but she never came by. In the end we went to go find someone ourselves to take care of it for us. \n\nThe times I went both with and without a reservation, weekday and weekend, I lucked out and got a table by the window.

My husband has been wanting to take me to the Starlight Room for years, he grew up in SF.  We belong to the middle aged crowd, along with most of the crowd that was there.  The entrance fee was $10.00 each, ok fine, not really a big deal.  The coat check was $5.00 per coat....are you kidding me!  The music was gawd awful, people were shaking their heads and walking off.  The dj wasn't even looking at the crowd.  Its too bad, this could be a great place to spend an evening dancing, but the management is more worried about getting money for a coat than hiring a decent dj and playing age appropriate music.  30 minutes later, we couldn't take it anymore.", "author": "Heather V."}

Sometimes you feel like your lounging in the 1920's and 1930's and maybe you would run into a Don Draper lookalike. lol\n\nI'm use to go going to the bars and lounges in Las Vegas so I'm use to chic and trendy. This would be nothing but a yawn to me but the 180 view of the city was breathtaking.\n\nThey have 3 different areas in the lounge:\n\n1. Bar area: It's a bit small and it gets packed during the weekends because of the live bands and DJ. Bartenders are friendly but they have a limited selection, I tried to order an AMF but they were short on 2 liquors. Boo!! So I ended up order a Jack and Coke and sorry to say that was watered down! I can taste more coke then Jack, I ordered 2 more Jack and coke and sprite and I still felt no buzz. I was pissed but I didn't want to complain, so I just stuck with beer. I asked the bartender what kind of beer they have and he said, Coors Light, Budlight and Heinkein. \n\nReally? Just three different kinds of beers. \n\nPsssh!!\n\n**WARNING** DON'T PAY WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD OR YOU'LL BE CHARGED $50, EVEN IF YOU BOUGHT ONE OR TWO DRINKS AND PAID LESS THEN $20. YOU'LL STILL BE CHARGED $50!! TOTAL BS!!\n\n\nPAY CASH OR PREGAME BECAUSE THE DRINKS ARE WATERED DOWN!! \n\n2. Dance Floor: The size of the floor was meh and the DJ was lame playing music from 70's, 80's, 90's and some top hits. I was hoping he'd play some house or trance music but you can always get everything. Lots of tourist and Francisco locals here at the Denton Lounge. \n\n3. Table Area: One side of the lounge has an area to sit down and just relax with friends, spouse, bf, gf and etc... \n\nGreat to have a conversation while having some fine wine or beer and admiring the Downtown Skyline, Union Square, Bay Bridge and from a distance you can see SFO.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back for the lounge and looking at the city view. The cover can be expensive at $10 for what you get here but hotels guests get in free if you show your room key.", "author": "Paul B."}

Maybe that's just me. The service was very courteous and attentive, but the price is really expensive just for drinks, but we determined it was worth it for the views.

Everyone that worked here were all dressed very classy and had great customer service skills, checking back often to see if we needed anything. \n\nThe starlight room has a great view of downtown. It looked beautiful as all the buildings outside were lit up against the dark foggy sky. I'm sure it's equally as beautiful around dinner time here. There are plenty of tables and seating that are reserved for bottle service. The dance floor is a little small so I'd definitely recommend getting a table with a group of friends. Otherwise you'll be stuck on the dance floor the whole night where it started to get really hot and cramped. Around 11 it was so hot the windows were fogging up and you could no longer see outside. \n\nI've read that there's generally an older crowd here but on this night there was a good mix of younger and older.  It was a lively crowd and the music was good. The DJ played top 40 and that's what I like!", "author": "Cassandra C."}

The cast is small, just 4 people, but since there are a lot of costume changes it seems like 20.  The MC and performer, Donna Sashay, was hilarious.  She quickly engaged the audience and had us laughing from the git go.  We were a bus load of folks from Petaluma, some 50 in all, and she made great sport of that pretending to have never heard of our town.  The show lasts about an hour, but was a lot of fun.  They are trying to establish the show as a San Francisco experience, and they depend a lot on word of mouth recommendations to advertise the show.\n\nReview of the brunch.  \nThe buffet, preceding the show, was first rate.  It was a full on brunch, including a omelet station featuring custom made to order omelets.  Plus prime rib cut to order. There was salads, desserts, and coffee.  Included was a cocktail of our choice, and my Bloody Mary was too strong but that was my fault for not choosing the mimosa or other choices.  \n\nOverall, the fixed price of $45 for everything.  It was a good value, including food, show, tax, tip, and alcohol.  The entertainers sat at the door after the show to chat with the crowd and pose for pictures.

He went completely MIA despite follow-up phone calls and messages. I'm now contesting this charge with my credit card company, the results of which are as yet to be determined.

We mainly wanted to see the view and have drinks - so this review doesn't include food.  On first impression, the place looks fancy, but after you settle in and begin to look around, you actually see that the place is old and needs refreshing.  There's a delicate balance of elegance and tacky-drag queen-cheapness about the decor.  The place is more or less clean, but I did notice dust on the vents on the ceiling.\n\nWe ordered drinks from the bar and the staff were courteous and professional.  I bought a glass of champagne and paid with my credit card and noticed they do a $50 authorization every time the card is swiped.  Keep that in mind because if you order 3 drinks, your account will temporarily have a debit of $150 until the actual fee of say... $30.. posts to your account on the following business day.  That's a big deal if you have checks coming through or are on a budget.\n\nAnyhow, it feels like the place is more of a tourist trap than anything.  The venue doesn't really command the price of the drinks.  It's nice to go there for the view and have a drink or two, but that's about all it's worth.", "author": "Shaun W."}

That usually happens in SOMA or the HAIGHT.  However, when work events (Conventions: GAG) or even holiday soirees in downtown San Francisco end early, it's often fun to be able to just traipse through the Union Square Hood and head to the Starlight Room (even better if there was an early evening of Ice Skating mixed into an early night, and now it's refreshment time!)\n\nSETUP\n\nThe Starlight Room is located on the 21st Floor of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel, and it is a TOTAL TRIP back in time to a more swanky, quasi-speakeasy feel.  I love it.\n\nThe music is usually cranking a wonderful mix of oldies, disco and some retro, along with the mainstay of pop and R&B.  [Note:  if you are looking for a rave, house or really young clientele, this is NOT your place.]\n\nWORK CREW\n\nThere is something here that a very diverse group of coworkers will enjoy here:  music, plush surroundings, comfortable seats, private alcoves, sparkly dance floor, astounding drinks, pleasant eye candy of all ages, genders, and denominations. ;)\n\nHOURS\n\nUnless you are part of a private event, you are pretty much out of luck getting in on a Monday Night.  [sometimes I wish I could since I would like to start here in the early evening, and then I just end up at DNA Lounge for Death Guild which goes late.]  But this is why it's important to check the calendar ahead of time so you won't be disappointed.  \n\nSPECIAL EVENTS\n\nThey have a very cool Drag Brunch on Sundays, and most nights you can enjoy the mixing stylings of DJ Dave Gillis.  So it's hard to go wrong if you are looking for something that everyone will find a piece of that they really like at different times of the week.  \n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nI really do love the Starlight Room, brought to you by Harry Denton.  :D", "author": "Michelangelo S."}

The views are amazing. We enjoyed the panoramic view of the sunset through some SF fog. After sundown the lights from Union Square shine brightly from the mirrored ceiling above the dance-floor. \n\nLet's get to my particular interest though - how were the cocktails?\n\n1) Barkeeps Whimsy #1. 3.5 out of 5. At the time of visit The Starlight Room was celebrating bourbons and ryes. With a mind toward seeing what our barkeep for the evening could do I put my fate in their hands and challenged them to produce something with a rye. What arrived at our table was essentially a dressed-up old-fashioned. Good, but not inspired. I'll admit the bar was set pretty high here. \n\n2) Smokey Local. 4 out of 5. Excellent drink, although I have a taste for smokey peaty Islay whiskey's. Ardbeg is a personal favorite. The Sherry and maraschino flavors smooth out the smokeyness of the whiskey and makes for a solid drink. This one might not be for everyone, one of those in our party did not care for the smokey flavor.  \n\n3) Barkeeps whimsy challenge #2. 2 out of 5. Inspired by the Hell Fire on the menu, requested something spicy. Received essentially a moscow mule with some jalepeno tequila thrown in. Flavor wise this was lacking for me. Would have liked to see more creativity. Could have use more fire from the drink. \n\n4) Sazarac. 3.5 out of 5. Not on the menu, after the last foray simply felt like moving back toward whisky based drinks. Sazarac was what I would expect.  \n\n5) Derby's Delight. 5 out of 5. Wild Turkey, Blackberry, Mint, Lemon, Simple Syrup. This is the one I'd come back for. Loved the way the individual flavors come together to compliment the wild turkey. Added flavor without becoming overly sweet.", "author": "David G."}

I ordered mojitos and the husband ordered chocolate martinis. The food runner and the busboy were both wonderful, although I didnt get their names. Each of the small bites were delicious and great cocktail bites. \n\nWe were there to celebrate post nuptials with friends of ours. They arrived about 930, so we closed out our dinner tab to the tune of about $150 including tip. Kendra and staff of the first shift made that worth every penny.\n\nWe secured keeping our same table for the dancing part of the evening by handing over our credit card for the tab and were passed along to the second shift, which I will call the dj shift.\n\n Alessandra was our server for the second shift.  Although the uniform is the same, the service level did come down a notch. There were no smiles, and the elegant service converted to a cocktail service. We did not feel the same treatment, but more the standard 'are we ok here?' Type of attitude. We were with a bride and groom and it would have been nice to have some sort of acknowledgment of that, with a smile and a personalized feel, but I digress. For the prices we are paying, we just expect more. I can go to a bar and be served anywhere, but the. Starlight is classy and patrons want that...\n\n There were two Dj's I think. The vibe changed from romance to party time. The crowd was an interesting mix of 30 somethings to 50 somethings. The music was 90s to top 40, and Im not a big dancer by any means, but they got me out on the floor a LOT! We ordered two cocktails each, average of 12 bucks or so each. Our bride and groom sat at an adjacent table with a couple of their friends. I am not sure what they ordered. \n\nAs mentioned, The second shift server was not at all nearly as attentive. My husband even had to go to the bar to get a drink for the bride and groom as we waited quite some time for her to serve us... After a lot of fun dancing had by all we were ready to head out. Around midnight or so we asked to close our tab. Alessandra asked if we wanted to combine our tab with our friends table. Um, no, we have separate tabs as secured by our card. No smiles, no thank you, just heres your tab and see ya type of attitude. A TOTAL turn off considering we dropped 200 dollars here tonight! What a disappointment!\n\n The brides shawl, which had been in the back of her chair the entire evening went missing. While the wonderful manager and door staff sought to find it for her, Alessandra seemingly hounded the bride and groom, by going back over to their table grabbing the tab and putting it in the grooms hands to get them to settle it. Um, how rude! They arent going anywhere darling, they are working to try and find her cover up since she IS in a wedding dress and it would be nice to take home the accompanying cover up for her dress on her wedding night. Just sayin!\n\nAll in all the experience, minus Alessandra, was wonderful. She loses a star for you. We will definitely be back, we just will request not to be seated in her section.", "author": "Kelly H."}

After having an amazing dinner at Farallon my friend and I walked over to The Starlight Room because we had heard good things. After being greeted kindly on the lower floor we found our way to the elevator at up to The Starlight Room. Immediately we were greeted by the bouncer who checked IDs and reprimanded me about my pants. Apparently wearing dress pants here is frowned upon. He went on to call them sweatpants (again, 400$ DRESS pants from Neimans) and told me he'd give me a pass this time but to not wear them in the future. Like I'd be returning after that. Regardless we walked into the area where we were not greeted or shown to a table. We walked around the empty room for a minute before selecting one with a view. The waitress approached us shortly after and we placed our drink order. 15 minutes passed and we still didn't have our drinks. And in that time a couple came and sat down near us and no one had even come to serve them and they were getting angry as well. Finally the lady came back with our drinks. Mine was okay. Subpar. No one approached us again for another 20 minutes so we decided to put the money for the drinks on the table and leave. Safe to say I will never be returning. Should have taken a cab to one of other other locations suggested to us. Lesson learned.", "author": "Brooke H."}

I used to come in frequently after work for drinks with colleagues and recently decided to revisit The Starlight Room... A lot has changed. New staff for the most part though I recognized a familiar face behind the bar. Micheal Pagan was running the show when I was a frequent guest here and was disappointed to find that he had no longer been with the buisness.  The drink menu has changed from what I remember  bringing in new cocktails and removing a couple of my favorites. Can't beat the view from the dance area, however, not amazed with the lack of professionalism when you see the new floor manager Chris slinging back shot after shot with the DJ that evening. I thought I was walking into a buisness that prides themselves on a world class view, apperance and staff. Not anymore.

If there's young people, most likely a lot of the younger crowds go in, but if there's an older crowd, then older crowd go in. Also, cover is based on how packed the room was. We went there at 9 ish and it was pretty dead ($5 for cover). People were still having dinner. I was starving so we went out for food hoping that it gets happening at 12 ish. \n\nOn the way back we saw three girls walk by ready for the fun night out but to realize that they were just leaving...and my friend and I was like if they're leaving, upstairs must really suck. And yes, it did! but we made the best of it.\n\nI mean at some points it was good towards 1 o'clock. The crowd was very mixed. There was even a wedding and there was bunch of cliques (meaning more than 4 people) and not couples. Probably partying it up after work (since it was a Friday). \n\nThe music was mostly 90s.

The staff was super friendly and attentive. I was with a date and we both enjoyed the view, decor and ambiance. This place reminds me of an old skool place where mobsters, gangsters and back room politicians would plan and connive during the Roaring 20s. Red velvet curtains, high ceiling windows, crystal hanging from the ceiling, recessed lighting, skyline views and piano! I felt like lighting a cigar and sipping some $800.00 cognac. But I don't smoke cigars and drink my money.   \n\nOur drinks were basic: Amaretto de Saranno and Stella beer. We also had raw Tuna Dip with chips. The chips were bland and reminded me of the Holy Wafers provided at communion. They were flavorless and the Tuna Dip could have used some added flavor.

I also had to take into account the company holiday party I organized here 3 years ago, hence the 4 Stars.\n\n***N I G H T L I F E***\nSince we had Veterans Day off, my friends and I wanted to party the night before. I remember hearing about Wed (Indulgence) Hip Hop Nights hosted by Sebastien Entertainment, so we decided to give it a shot.\n\nLINE:\nWe got there at 10:30 PM and the wait was less than 2 mins.\n\nCOVER: \nFree before 11 PM, if you're on the GL; otherwise it's $10.\n\nDRESS CODE:\nAlthough no dress code was stated on the FB invite, SR is not a place to come rocking your newest kicks. It's a very classy venue, so dress to impress!\n\nCROWD:\nSUGAR DADDY AND COUGAR CENTRAL! The average age was about 50--I kid you NOT! There was probably a 3:1 ratio of men to women and the majority were tourists. It wasn't our scene, so we left to Infusion. I think the crowd is a result of the event being under promoted. \n\nMUSIC:\nTop 40s, Hip Hop and Pop. Guest DJ Primetyme was awesome; good mixes and smooth transitions. The music was so good; we even contemplated coming back here after leaving to Infusion. \n\nBAR:\nThere's a main bar upon entering SR and a make-shift one near the dance floor. They have an extensive array of liquor including many rare and expensive ones. \n\nDRINKS:\n$11 for top shelf liquor which is reasonable considering it's an upscale venue in a historic downtown hotel. Generous shots were served in cups. \n\nBottle service was available for $150/ bottle for Absolut and $200/bottle for Goose which probably needs to be booked ahead of time from the promoters to lock in this price. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nSR is very classy and reminiscent of the 1930s with deep red velvet booths and draping, diamond chandeliers and staff decked out in a white tux and black bow tie. There are about 6-8 booths reserved for bottle service. The dance floor is pretty tiny and probably the size of 4 cubicles. There's PLENTY of dancing room as most of the crowd wasn't the dancing type. \n\nThe main attraction is the GORGEOUS 360-degree view of San Francisco. It's truly breathtaking to see a bird eye's view of SF's landmarks and the city lights on a crisp night. SR is definitely a great place to bring out-of-towners or a date for drinks.\n\nPARKING:\nStreet parking is difficult but not impossible at night. I got parking 1.5 blocks away after circling just once. Otherwise, there's valet parking. \n\n***P R I V A T E  E V E N T***\nSince I organized a company holiday party 3 years ago, my review is very dated and lacks precise detail. However, the customer service was excellent and I didn't have a panic attack, so it's very noteworthy. (Do note that SR is open to the public at 9:30 PM.) \n\nJaime, the Events Manager at the time was very easy to work with. She was very friendly, professional and responsive. She always responded to my calls and/or e-mails within 24 hours. \n\nI told Jaime our company budget and she gave us several options on how we can maximize our budget. She helped us work out a plan so that we can offer unlimited red and white wine. And, as a surprise she even had the bartender make a specialty cocktail with our company color which we handed out drink tickets for. \n\nWe ordered 2 stations: North Beach Station (antipasti and various pastas) and Chinatown Station (dim sum dishes). Although the stations were suppose to be more like hors d'oeuvres, the food portions were very generous so everyone was well fed. I did have some doubts about the lack of authenticity of the Chinatown Station, but was told that they have Chefs that specialize in each region of cuisine. And, from what I remember, the har gow, sui mai, and char siu bao tasted similar to what you get in Chinatown, Sunset, or Richmond.\n\nDJ Dave Gillis is SR's in-house DJ, so we didn't have to bother looking for one. DJ Gillis was very easy to work with as well. He sent me playlists to look through beforehand and played songs that suited our employees. Most of our workforce was engineers, so needless to say, there was no Flo Rida's \"Get Low\" or Kelis' \"Milkshake\". \n\nAs far as the event went, it went off without a hitch. My former colleagues aren't party animals, but everyone enjoyed the food and getting to mingle with each other outside of work. I got commendation for days about how well the event went, but I have to thank the staff at SR for helping to organize a successful event that was virtually stress-free. \n\nAll in all, although the nightlife crowd was not my cup of tea, I would come back to SR for the music and venue not without good company of course...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It was kind of gross, but this was my fault for choosing something with Falernum alcohol.  I'd avoid it unless you like your drink tasting like grass & herbs haha.  I drank it regardless, but I'd probably never get it again!   My boyfriend's drink was good.  There was nothing crazy in there and he liked it so it was a win.  \n\nWe also ordered their chicken nuggets with honey mustard sauce.  They were delicious!

There was seating and tables.\n\nThe live band that night was not my favorite, but they did have a DJ later on.  They do have a piano too, but they did not play on it that night. The dance floor had a mirrored ceiling, which reflected the little white lights on the dance floor.  (The ceiling looked like stars).  We loved the gorgeous views of all of Union Square and even the freeway lights.   It is a twenty one floor elevator ride up to the top, and it is in the Sir Francis Drake Hotel.

Here are my findings:\n\n$10 cover/person. Right off the bat, they charged me. \n\nOrdered two drinks from the bar, vodka tonic and rum and coke (well drinks at that). $19. Ouch. After the $10 cover?? I'm from Los Angeles and I still found that outrageous...\n\nMusic, straight out of the nineties, if not earlier. Only one song was played from this decade and that was Macklemore's \"Thrift Shop\". If you're looking for a hot spot to dance in, this is not it. Dance floor was filled with older folks who are probably staying at the hotel. Want to see 50 year olds jitterbug to Prince? This is your place! Plus the DJ clearly did not know what he was doing, as he would play one upbeat song, and then immediately play three songs that all you could do was step to. \n\nAfter all that dancing, I figured it would be nice to sit. NOPE. All the tables were reserved, which really takes away from the ambiance, when you can't sit in their pretty red booths (part of what drew me there in the first place).\n\nAll in all, a DISAPPOINTING experience. If you've never been there, I wouldn't go expecting much. I'm sure the drag brunch is great, but seeing as I already spent $40+ to be disappointed, I'll not spend the extra $90 to see if their drag queens are as good as ours.", "author": "Ashley M."}

Once we arrived, we were taken to a table immediately.  However, it was located directly by the kitchen.  Which was very busy.  It was Very uncomfortable and had the feel of as if we were apart of the staff. With that being said we turned the table down and asked to be seated at something more inviting.  They ended up moving us to a table on the left side of the restaurant 3 table from the kitchen.  Without complaining we decided to take that table and enjoy the view.  Within minutes our awesome waitress Monica, asked for our drink order and gave some great suggestions.  The birthday girl had a rum punch, her husband Belvi on ice with lime, I had a tipsy rabbit and our other friend had an easy sippin!!!  All I can say is yummy!!!.  With lots of people celebrating Christmas parties, the section to the right of us was being reserved for a wedding.  As the staff had been trying to keep others from wondering over to the area we thought we would help out and suggested that they bring a velvet rope there to show its was a VIP reserved area which they did finally. Chris, the security on site took over the area and from time to time had to walk away.  So again we suggested to Chis that WE would help monitor the area, Since we were sitting right there, so he could handle other area's of the lounge. He was AWSOME!!! Now the mood changes when we get this so called host named Robert.  He comes over to the velvet rope and says to us, \"We're gonna move you all. This is the worst table in the house.\"  When actually he wanted to give our table to another customer and place us back by the kitchen again!!!.  So of course we refused and as he looked down upon us as if we didn't belong in this establishment, we asked Monica to send over the manager. When the manager came to our table not only was he personable but he was so friendly!!! It was if we knew him for years.  His name is Derick Opela!!!! He, Monica and Chris 5 Diamond for this spot.  However that Robert, this place could really do without.\nDerick took exceptional care of us and sent us all a round of birthday drinks and treated us as if we were royalty.

There is a lot to love about Harry Denton's starlight room-- It's almost like a historical landmark of San Francisco.. with an awesome view of the city and Union Square. The lounge is draped with red curtains, that appear to be straight outta the 70s and there are typically plenty of places to sit, as well as tons of space on the dance floor to move around. Either there has been a dj playing music or a live band playing music every time-- this last dj on Wednesday night was okay.

I'm not sure what it is about Drag Queens, but I love them. Maybe it's all the work the girls put in to looking SO beautiful, the sheer showmanship of it all, or the fact that they just seem to LOVE to celebrate. And well, let's be honest, I WAS celebrating my last fling before that ring goes on for good!\n\nThe peach Bellinis flowed almost as well as the gowns, and the food was decadent. Fresh made omelets, juicy prime-rib, some of the best lox I've ever tasted, and brioche French toast to top it all off. \n\nBut you should know, I was sad to have missed you at this performance. I know you enjoy a visit on most Sunday's. I hope you don't mind, though, when a woman sitting near me asked if her mate would recognize you had you been there, I chimed in with, \"Oh, Mr. Denton is hard to miss. A fairly short and some-what stocky man with a great laugh, you'd know if he had been here...\" And I ended with a heavy sigh, because I did miss you.\n\nI hope to see you soon, Harry!\n\nWith love and admiration,\n\nLady Lauren", "author": "Lauren S."}

The great thing is that it works. Everybody's got a place in the Starlight Room.

Everything from Chicken and Waffles, \nFrench Toast, an Omelette Station, Prime Rib Carving Station, all kinds of yummy things....  Good desserts, and a selection of juices..... They encourage you to go back multiple times.  Extra points for the guy who busses the empty plates!  He does not let dirty dishes linger!  Then.... it is Showtime.  I've seen Donna Sachet around for years.... but.... I had no idea how talented she really is.  She is the Star of the show, and the MC.  She sings in her own voice..... and is completely hysterical when she is talking with the audience.  She goes by every table, and makes everyone feel so welcome..... like she is doing the show just for them.  She looks every person in the eye as she makes her rounds.

There are great views from up here and it's a cool little place to vibe on a weekday right in the midst of Union Square.  The music wasn't too bad either.  The drink menu is extensive and expensive, if you can even read it in the dim lighting.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of a snobby crowd going on here as girls are dressed as if they are going to be on the red carpet.  (There was a cat-fight that broke out in the ladies' room over a spilled drink!)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a cool place, on a Wednesday night.  The crowd was young - late 20s and 30s.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-13", "description": "Every Sunday Harry Denton's Starlight Room serves a buffet style brunch and then has a drag show. There are two shows/seatings each time and usually 3 or 4 performers.\n\nHarry Denton's itself:\nWell, the space is designed a bit oddly. Like the bar area...they built a bar right where there should be a window, so they've obstructed the view. I hope they have attractive bartenders to make up for it. For brunch the whole \"we're on the 21st floor of the Sir Francis Drake\" is wasted because they hide some more windows with a stage backdrop and put the brunch buffet right in front of what appears to be the largest set of windows. The people making your omelets would have a fabulous view if they turned around.\n\nFor the drag show brunch they put a few tables where there probably shouldn't be any for traffic flow reasons, and the first time I went there people (especially one server) were bumping into my chair over and over again. Other seats have a partially obstructed view of the stage.\n\nThe food:\nSorry, but the brunch is pretty horrible. I'm not a big fan of buffets and cafeteria style dining anyway, I really want people to come to my table and bring me food to order and not stand in a line for some old, cold, limp mass-produced crap. At least with Harry Denton's the service didn't suffer from the fact that it was a buffet...so many times it means the servers and other staff just treat you like cattle, but at Harry D's the servers are still friendly and eager to get you a cocktail and plates are cleared away quickly but not too quickly.\n\nDid I mention the food was horrible? If I ever have brunch there again (like, if my dad and stepmother were visiting, I might take them) I think I will just have an omelet and then some dessert. Don't eat anything from the warming pans! Seriously awful food. At the end the chef came out and everyone was supposed to applaud her and I was applauding because this was her last day before she went off to have a baby. Please-oh-please let the new \"chef\" serve something better...or better yet, couldn't they do away with the buffet, charge a cover charge for the show, and just make a normal brunch menu? Gak. Please?\n\nThe cocktails are somewhat outrageously priced, but tasty. I think you're paying for the view, but on Sundays there really isn't one.\n\nThe show:\nI'm happy I found this show...it's too bad they were closed on Easter when my mom was in town. Really, this is a great place to take visiting family (especially if they like generic brunch buffets) with a drag show that isn't too intimidating and is really fun. They have a nice variety of performers, and although most of them are lip-syncing there are a few (including the MC, Donna) who sing. Actually, Donna is pretty good. My bf says it's because s/he chooses songs wisely and knows her range. Whatever, she's a great MC.\n\nOther highlights of the show are Cassandra Cass, who is very beautiful with a lot of energy and great costumes. I hear she is also at Asia SF, so for that reason alone I want to go check that place out. And...I can't remember her name (or maybe I never quite caught what it was in the first place) but there is another performer who did Reba McIntyre the first time we were there and did Lucille Ball the second time, and she was really amazing. Her vitameatavegamin skit had everyone practically rolling in the aisles laughing, which was quite a feat considering she lip-synced the whole thing and had to act it all out at the same time.\n\nWe were there on the one year anniversary of the show and Donna did this really great number that included two shirtless guys with bowties and even ended with Harry Denton himself on the stage doing some chorus-line kicks...they should do that every time.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're looking for a place to take your out-of-town visitors on a Sunday, to give them a slightly titillating San Francisco experience in a harmless environment, and they wouldn't know good food if it hit them over the head, or if you just REALLY LOVE drag shows, then I recommend Harry Denton's Starlight Room Sunday's a Drag show.

Definitely not for the younger crowd. And they didn't start playing the good music until after my friends and I left. In the beginning the music was old school like 90s and 80s and some early 2000s.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-16", "description": "This review is for the Sunday's a Drag Brunch only. First of all, I want to say that we like this room. It is old school and very San Francisco. The Sir Francis Drake is a charming old hotel and as far as we've ever known, it has had a good reputation. That is why we thought we would have a good experience at the brunch. As it turned out, we had such a bad experience that we couldn't believe it.  It was clear from the beginning the staff didn't have their act together. It started out with bad service and then the afternoon only went from bad to worse. It took forever and a day for the wait staff to take our drink order and then forever to get our drinks. BTW, a pitcher of Mimosas (a carafe, mind you) is priced at $60. Yes, you heard me...sixty dollars.  Cocktails are priced at $13. Only New York has worse cocktail prices but that's the Big Apple for you. Anyway, the tables are small and barely big enough to eat a meal comfortably on. Halfway into the brunch, there was little food left on the buffet tables. We could not believe it. While I will spare you the other gory details, I will tell you I would not recommend this brunch. That it is ridiculously over-priced at $60 a pop (not including cocktails and tip) has got to mean they cater to the tourists. That others have raved about it is surprising considering the unfortunate experience we had. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed with what we thought would be a fun afternoon. What a shame. We actually were looking forward to this experience but it certainly didn't work out the way we thought it would. Definitely would not recommend it.", "author": "Rabbit B."}

If you like to chum with 40 + year old people when you are in your 20s, looking to hang out at a cool trendy place with people about your age and NOT wanting to get down to KC and the Sunshine band, not a good place for you to go. If it weren't for being with my silly and fun sister, I would have been bored shitless because it was too old for me. I had to drink quite a bit to have a good time. After about 7 cocktails, I got my ass on the dance floor and hustled my heart out to the Bee Gees, but I won't be going back until I am closer to 40. By then, they'll be playing \"Old school Justin Timberlake\" tunes. \n\nBasically, if you do decide that you must go just to see the panoramic view of San Francisco or if you are staying at the hotel, then expect the place to be shoulder to shoulder packed and lacking service due to all the hustle and bustle. The poor servers have to wear black formal gown in heals all night because that's there uniform, so that sets the tone.

No lines and it helped that we were hotel guests... as guests we only paid $5 cover as opposed to $10. I think $10 is a little ridiculous for this \"club\" to charge. The dance floor is teeny tiny and despite them playing Top 40, it's not very hip -- their live band ran us off the dance floor a few times -- but I suppose the view is worth it.  Bonus? We all hit the sack at different times so it was really convenient to just take the elevator down to our rooms.

I'm so glad I did. We arrived on a Friday night around 9pm and they didn't charge us a cover.  We parked for free on Bush and Powell, right by the Stockton garage (which was only $8 for the night).\n\nAlmost all the tables were reserved but somehow we managed to get a great booth near the dance floor and band. It's a really cool atmosphere with comfortable seating and really great music. My mom is 60, her friend is 50, and I'm 35 (all women), and the variety of ages in the club was perfect for us. Ages ranged from 21 to 70, with most people in their 30s and 40s, I'm guessing.  The ethnic makeup was a nice variety of white, asian, black and hispanic. The crowd was okay looking, not bad, though if I was single I might have been disappointed.  The music was really impressive - the live band played a lot of great 70s music, nice variety (of 70s plus other decades, including the recent \"Crazy\") with lots of energy for dancing.  The singer was awesome - he sounded like Stevie Wonder,  great range, style and tone. He was also great with the audience, moving around occasionally, made lots of eye contact, plus he's hot.  The guitarist and tenor saxophone player both played lots of incredible solos (effective melodic builds and structure, great music references, tons of energy), and both were also great supporting players. The keyboardist and drummer really kept the music moving well, and the keyboardist has a nice voice for backups and lead vocals.  The DJ spun great tunes for dancing (the live band and DJ traded off). \n\nThe dance floor is a great size, at times filled and sometimes empty, but never made me feel crowded or self-conscious (a few people sitting can see the dance floor, but if you don't want to be watched, no problem finding a spot). Some men asked all of us to dance at various points in the evening (we stayed past midnight), but none of them became persistent, so that added to the experience.  I wouldn't go here to meet someone as a single person, but it's perfect for couple and those who just want to have a great time out, drinking and dancing (and if someone in your party doesn't want to dance, there's no pressure with the way it's set up - my mom sat in the booth for much of the night).\n\nThe host, Robert, and our waitress were both very attentive, friendly and efficient. We had drinks when we wanted them, and were not pressured to buy more when we were finished. We also felt safe to leave our belongings at the booth unattended, but I also brought my purse to the dance floor because their is a shelf on the edge where you can place drinks and belongings - perfect. The view is incredible, most of the night I felt like I was dancing with San Francisco.  The bathrooms are also nice and I never had to wait. The live music was piped in, too, which I appreciated.\n\nThe drinks were tasty. I ordered a Devilish (very light and refreshing, nice girly drink) and a Napa Crush (tasted more like alcohol, still sweet and delicious). My mom ordered a martini (thumbs up) and a Brambo (I think that was the name, it was really good with sweet and sour flavors). Her friend ordered two Cherry Bombs, which she obviously liked (less sweet than my drinks, good for both men and women).  All drinks were $10 each, except the martini ($10.50).", "author": "Rebecca D."}

We were in town for the night for business and Harry Denton's was recommended by the concierge at our hotel. \n\nWhen we came in the host did not give us a friendly welcome whatsoever. I was trying to ask him if an area near the bar we were interested in sitting was open for self-seating, but he basically cut me off and said he would seat us in another area. So, I had to ask him again and he finally told us that we couldn't sit there. All the while, no smile and very unwelcoming as if we were annoying him with our presence. \n\nWe asked him if food was still being served and he said yes. \n\nWe were seated and given one menu for three people. \n\nThe waitress, however, was a breath of fresh air--friendly and welcoming. \n\nShe took our drink orders while we were looked over the menu. It took us a couple minutes to figure out what we wanted because nothing especially popped out. \n\nFinally, we made a decision and got the waitress's attention and let her know we wanted to order food. She told us the kitchen was closed!! Of course, we were quite surprised because we had been told otherwise by the grumpy host. We asked if there was anything we could be served--bread and butter so we wouldn't be drinking on an empty stomach??? After all, the kitchen would had to have just closed in the 10 minutes or so from when we came in to when we tried to order. \n\nShe said she would go an check and let us know. \n\nA while later she happened to come by our table and we had to remind her that she was supposed to be checking with the kitchen for us and she confirmed that there was nothing they could serve us and said that she would bring us the check and hurried off. \n\nMy colleagues and I looked at each other a bit confused, because we never indicated that we wanted the check, but we were like, whatever--we're not having another round anyway. \n\nWhen guests are seated right before the kitchen closes, any good server would ask them if they wanted to put in an order before the kitchen closes. I don't know why she didn't bother asking us. \n\nMeanwhile, the waitress was back and forth and never brought us the check. Finally, we asked her about it and she brought it to us. I was thinking perhaps she realized the she had prematurely offered the check to us and changed her mind about bringing it--then again, she could have just forgotten about it. \n\nI must admit, she was overextended--she seemed to be taking care of the entire lounge until another waitress came on not long before we left. So, she had about 7 tables. \n\nThe drink was good, so no complaints there. \n\nThe decor was hideous. The upholstery desperately needs to be redone. It is worn and tattered. \n\nThe crowd was a random mix. \n\nThe DJ was great! Hip hop and top 40s. \n\nThe view is really nice. \n\nOnly because of the view, I would say that it isn't terrible if you just want a drink and a great view and you know what you're getting yourself into.", "author": "Oli A."}

The interior is very pretty and has huge windows that give you an amazing view of the city. This is definitely not your \"ultra lounge\" or club with thumping bass and lasers, but there is a nice dance floor.  On the night I was there, they alternated between a DJ playing pop/hip-hop and a live band doing mostly cover songs.  \n\nWhile my girlfriend and I did not take advantage of them, there is a large area of tables and private seating areas that would be great for a small group and give it more of that VIP feeling.  \n\nOne of the craziest aspects of this place is the huge age range of the people there, all the way from 21, up to 50s and 60s.  This is not necessarily a bad thing and makes for a more interesting and diverse crowd. \n\nWhile this is probably not a place I would want to go every week, I definitely feel like this is a great place for special occasions.

You know, a little hee-haw for my mee-maw.\r\n\r\nSo all I remember about the day that I first wound up at the Starlight Lounge is that my friend Jessica and I did something INCREDIBLY trashy that day, 'cept I can't remember what.  Something that's the emotional equivalent to smearing the diseased diarrhea of lepers across our lips.  But for some reason we were dressed relatively appropriate to hit up some bars in SF.  We first went to the Tonga Room, but warrn't no fake tropical storm blowing through that mess at the time (we didn't hit the right half-hour), and the drinks were too much and the karaoke singer was way too far out in the square lagoon, so we left.\r\n\r\nI think we hit up the Starlight at about 7 pm, and all the greeters were in cray-cray slingy black cocktail dresses.  This statuesque girl that I swear is the runny nosed girl from The Blair Witch Project seated us, and we ordered some kinda citrus sunset drink, a mojito, and a pizzetta.  Apparently, we had to get outta there by 8 pm, when the actual \"preferred clientele\" would arrive.\r\n\r\nThat's the thing -- I read the other reviews on this place, and I think everyone's going at the wrong time.  Y'all gotta go hella EARLY, so you can witness the trashy out-of-towners and listen to the amusement park funk band at a CALM pace.\r\n\r\nWe promised ourselves we'd have a kind of classy-trashy night out like that once a month.  So the next month, we saw a Craigslist ad that said Manhunt auditions were being held at the ole' Starlight.  I was in my looking-for-male-modeling-gigs-on-Craigslist phase without actually going to any calls, and of course I immediately thought, \"Oh god, they ain't gonna take me.  They don't want no pock-marked, 5'10\", skinny ass, hella big-toothed foo' like me on their show.  Or maybe they do!\"\r\n\r\nSo we decided I would apply and I'd just go there to hella insult all the braindead fratboys applying.  Besides, I've got the cheek bones and the scary 28\" waist, so maybe they WOULD take the freaky-gaunt big-mouthed look.\r\n\r\nThen one night last year I wanted to get the hell out of my office and called up another loudmouthed friend, so we got dessert then went for drinks at the Starlight.  There was no one there but white-afro ladies with fanny packs and their husbands with transition lens gold rimmed glasses.  The singer of the band had hella Soul Glo dripping down on the hardwood stage, and Jocelyn and I got up and danced to some Supremes, Stevie Wonder, and Jackson 5, then we hightailed it outta there.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to last night.  Don't ask me why, but for some reason I was in an elevator coming down from the Starlight Lounge with about 8 other drunken tourists trying to look like Marina guys -- except they had big ole' guts and lots of moles with their vertically striped collar shirts and hair spiking glue.  \r\n\r\nI'm at the front of the elevator, looking down at my crotch because that's all I have room to do.\r\n\r\nFatty farm guy next to me in a Southern accent:  \"There wuz nuthin' but a bunch of fat girls.  Just a whole bunch of muthafuckin' fat girls.  CHINESE fat girls.  Why is there so many CHINESE FAT GIRLS in that bar?\"\r\n\r\nOther guys:  \"Heh heh, heh heh.\"\r\n\r\nHim:  \"Man, I'd fuck a CHINESE FAT GIRL.  I'd fuckin' fuck a muthafuckin' CHINESE FAT GIRL.\"  (Starts to gyrate and pump, and his white fabric belt is undone under his periwinkle XXL butterfly collar dress shirt.)  \"I'd (pump) FUCK (pump pump) a CHINESE (bump) FAT GIRL.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I'm a split second too late in turning to him with my stone cold eyes and saying, \"I'm a Chinese fat girl.  Are you going to fuck me, mutha fucka?\"", "author": "Haaay East Bay l."}

(Thank you for the free drinks and hilariously \"...unique\" experience!)\n\nLet's start with the most offensive first, so the rest of the complaints don't sound so bad... My god, the music -- 80's hip hop and funk alternatingly played by a DJ and a cover band -- is *SO* bad, you wished they played it louder. That way, you'd go deaf and not have to prolong the pain.\n\nThinking about the crowd at Harry Denton's, I've finally figured it out. It's not bridge and tunnel. It's Lost. It's an an island populated by random freaks. There's the table from Big Hair, Idaho, clad in USDA Prime sized blue jeans. Next to them, a table of players who were cool 30 years ago. They're far too old to interest the table of 400-year old Chinese eggs, searching for fountains of youths to suck dry. The only youth inside is the vapid wait staff. Add to this very special episode my large party of smarmy technogeek all-stars, hell-bent on partying medium. Everyone hangs back in their lounge chairs, waiting to see what freaky thing the island will do next.\n\nOur waitress either has just gotten dumped by her sugar daddy, or gets off on the idea that she serves abuse, not booze -- the girl's in a stinky pissy mood. Getting drinks from her is like trying to squeeze bloody mary's from a stone. Thankfully there's catered food, and it's actually not bad.\n\nThe cuts of roast beef are delish. The crab cakes are  surprisingly good -- spicy, with lots of real crab meat, crispy and not too greasy. The only bad appetizer is the not-so-fresh foie gras. Tonight's star of the Starlight Room: bacon-wrapped prawns. Ultimately, wrapped in bacon almost forgives anything.\n\nIt's a good thing the food and drinks were flowing freely, or I would have gone all Lord of the Flies on the island and started sacrificing people Piggy style -- starting with the Worst DJ Evar. \n\nDon't go. The view isn't all that -- dirty windows half-obstructed by neighboring buildings. On a weeknight, there's no cover, but you would do better off skipping out on this live-action Lost and curling up with a slightly rancid tub of butter.

If you're of the female persuasion, there's a chance there is no cover.\n\nThe first time I walked in here, I was intimidated by the place and the prices, I didn't know what to order.  So I went with a standard cosmo.  I tasted it - not too much alcohol, not too sweet - PERFECTION.  So good, I was sucking them down one after the other.\n\nUsually when I come in, I grab a drink then head over the dance floor where the view is.  The view is alright but I love that I can see outside.  And their windows really should be cleaned more often.  Inevitably, some old guy is getting down on the dance floor which is always a source of amusement, as long as there's only one of them, and no more than one.\n\nMusic is pretty good.  Top 40 dance music.  The first time we tried to request a song, the DJ's security guy (they have those?) said they didn't do requests.  But if two cute girls approach you, are you really gonna deny them?  So DJ took our request and we danced the night away to Chris Brown's \"Forever.\"\n\nHighlight of our first time: Sean Penn was there.\n\nHighlight of our second night: Our friend snagged an open table and a bottom of Dom.\n\nCall me a snob but I like bougy loungey places.  And I prefer a cocktail over a beer any day.  But minus 2 stars because theyre so absurdly expensive and because they don't clean their windows for a place with a view.

Where else are you going to be able to dance between a guy who just turned 21 sometime this past week and the leader of AARP?  I mean, there was a guy who almost needed a walker to move around .... and around him were people who could be his great grandchildren as well.\n\nThis is a really nice establishment located on the top floor of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel.  Views all around, and great setup for socializing as well as a rather smallish dancefloor at one end of the club for dancing fools.  The bar is on the opposite end, and has quite a line on their usually packed Wednesdays, called \"Indulgence\".  \n\nJust standing in line, I knew this would be a bizarre night.  What a mixed bag of patrons, but it is supposed to be the \"thing to do\" on Wednesday nights in SF, and apparently, all age groups are privy to this fact.  The line was very slow-moving, though - as they loaded  a single elevator to capacity and waited for the next one to come back, etc.  I almost left because based on what I was  seeing, this was not going to be my scene, but then the guy in front of us gave us VIP tickets.  OK, so no cover - - I guess a new place is worth checking out if we won't have to pay to get in.\n\nOn your walk to the restroom or to the bar, a girl anywhere under 40 is likely to get hit on at least 10 times  - - each way.   Harmless, but it does make you want to roll your eyes.  \"You could be my father, buddy.  Stop staring.\"  If you are above 40 yourself, or like older men - this might be the venue of your choice.  I have nothing against older folks - I just tend to expect more composed behavior from them, that's all.\n\nThe bartenders were really nice - but definitely something was amiss. Apparently, when I go to the bar to buy drinks, they whip out the big, tall glasses to fill my order, and each drink is about half the price with one thrown in for free.  When my guy friends bought drinks, they used the small glasses and I kid you not - charged double.  I guess it pays to be a girl, but still!\n\nThe music was all over the place.  In a good way, one can say that there was a little something for everyone from age 15 to 65.  I didn't mind the contrast so much - but for someone lookin for JUST hip hop, or JUST 80's, or JUST one kind of anything -  Starlight Room is not for you.  There was one man, perhaps in his late 40's, who was breakdancing to an oldie, slippin' and slidin' to hip hop, doing the wave on his own (you could tell he'd worked hard on it, too, in front of his mirror at home) and sometimes danced like he was having some sort of seizure.  Good, he was not.  Entertaining -  definitely.\n\nThere's a pretty good time to be had here if you go with good friends and just want to mingle and meet new people, and don't much care what kind of new people you meet.  I think it'd be interesting, at least.  \n\nSeating is a bit weird - - plenty of booths and table/chairs to sit at, except all are empty and not occupied, but have a \"RESERVED\" sign placed on the table, preventing you from using it.  Some remained reserved and unoccupied through the whole night, so I don't quite understand the concept.\n\nI give it 3-stars because the club's look and layout is nice - and drinks are good - but this is definitely not an elite party club, or it's most definitely not the hippest place to be in your 20s or 30s.  In my 40's I think I would enjoy this place a lot more, and will return then to change my rating as I see fit.\n\nUntil then - -- if you want to be around a lot of people on a particular Wednesday night - head to Starlight Room.  That, you will get.  If it's a weekend night, there are lots of better clubs out there with better music, dancing, and crowds.  \n\nWould I go again?\nUm.... I wouldn't be totally against going, but I would try to make a case for doing something else.\n\nTheir brunch, however, is enticing.

I LOVE to people watch and this was a very fun place to do it.\n\nMEANWHILE the BF and I also worked on keeping our own spark alive here, its nice to be able to dress up and go somewhere fancy once in a while.

Nothing could kill my high.  \n\nThere I was in the Harry Denton Starlight Room, owned by Kimpton group, with my girlfriend and a group of drunk mexicans, and Jon, whose jewish.  We showed up at about one thirty five and ordered a woodford reserve manhattan and a glass of Nicolas Feuilatte Rose Champagne, which costs us somewhere near forty dollars.  The bartender was nice,  italian, and our drinks were superb.\n\nThen the lights went on.  Then some ass came around and told us that we had to finish our drinks.  Legally, we thought, we could stay until two o'clock right?  I didn't go to Hastings, but I thought that was pretty much correct.  I said, \"How about five minutes.\"  He replied, \"I'll give you one minute.\"  Then he came back very soon.  I don't know if it was a minute, I was kinda drunk on the red worm.  He told us we had to finish our drinks.  I said something to the lines of harassment and my gal gave him the uptown attitude and talked about bar time.\n\nThen this goober actually took our drinks out of our hands.  On buddha's belly, I swear to god it was only one fifty.  Our drinks were still full.  Sacrilege!  CarrieAnn was pissed and asked for his name, and the gent spelled it out for us loudly and insultingly, like he knew he wasn't going to get in trouble.  She told him mockingly that he was very good at his job, in which he replied, \"For your information, I'm a mortgage broker!\"  wtf?\n\n\"So you must be making millions!\"  She said.  I replied, \"For your information-,\"   And then I said something kinda bad.  He got right up in my face and replied.  \"You know, little boy, if we were out on the street I would give you a full body massage.\"  \n\nSo I headed into the elevator and I was actually excited.  I never get to swear at anyone.  What a jerk!  Baby was livid.  We went to the front desk of the Francis Drake and asked to speak to a manager, followed by this drunk french guy who was behind us being french saying, \"fehqing sheeet, dat guy wez sech ah ezhol!\"\n\nWe got an escort back upstairs.  I think I even did a little jig in front of my coworkers who were chilling in the lounge.\n\nThe manager was in his stree clothes and all the bartenders had taken off their tuxeo jackets.  One dress shirt was even de-sleeved.  I thought that classy.  Two little girls were sitting in a booth with glasses of over oaked California red thinking, \"Oh my gawd, why are they, like, interrupting our after party?\"\n\nThe manager reimbursed us with money from his own wallet.  Doorass was gone.  We went home and baby wrote three different high ups within the specific hotel, restaurant and bar faction we were insulted in about our unpleasant experience.  They failed to resolve the issue appropriately and we weren't invited back.  We thought about going last night.  I kinda want to go and drop a multi hundred on a nice varietal champagne and a couple glasses of Louis, and then test their bar time quota.\n\nFour stars for the italian bartender.  Negative twenty seven stars for the doorman and one star for Harry Denton's Starlight room.", "author": "Ashby U."}

As we were getting them out, we asked if there was a cover.  He looked over at the girl behind the desk, and asked \"is there a cover?\"  She looked at us, looked down at her book or whatever, then said yes, $20.  No smile from anyone, no nothing.  Wow - so this bouncer didn't know there was a cover, and the cover appears to be subjective.  I've been here before, twice, and the cover was $10.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-10-22", "description": "I recently visited this establishment while on my first trip to the city. I had made reservations two weeks in advance because it has an amazing view (located on the 21st floor, right next to Union Square). I made them for 8pm because we weren't planning on staying long, and we figured we would get in and out . \n\nWhen the three of us arrived we had to stand next to the elevators because we were 10 minutes early for our reservations. As more customers entered they also stood in the tight area with us, constantly moving as the elevator doors opened. Despite the fact that we were the first ones to arrive and the fact that we had reservations, we somehow were pushed to the back as others entered . None the less, we got to the rude host. \n\nAn out of town visitor that was looking for a great view of the city, I was also unaware that this was more of a bar than a restaurant. Unfortunately one of the girls with us ( I say girl because we are 24 and the rest of the crowd were men and women 50 and older, mind you on a Saturday night) left her ID in the car. The man at the front was angry because I was unaware that we needed to prove we were 21 to get in. We offered to get the ID and come back, but after insulting us and the fact the we were from Southern California, he told us that we could still enter. For some reason he didn't feel the need to check the IDs of the two of us that had them. She should have had her ID, and we take full responsibility for that, hence the fact that we told him that we would go and get it.\n\nShocked that he was so demeaning, we proceeded into the bar to be greeted once again with a name request. After giving my name, they seemed to have a problem locating my reservation (even though I had received a call the previous day confirming that reservation). What a shock for the man that there were two pages of reservations! Seemed a little strange that he couldn't figure that out, but he finally found us.\n\nOn to our seats.  We sat, placed an order for drinks and appetizers (of course the friend without the ID ordered water) and were disturbed that the man at the door wouldn't stop staring at us. After our orders were delivered service was nonexistent from that point on. I waited about 10 minutes to get a fork so that I could eat, and we had to ask our waitress if we could have our empty waters refilled (it was strange that we had to say \"excuse me \"serveral times as she walked by before she actually looked our way, even though onme of the waitresses actually bumped my foot while passing our tabe because the area was so tight).\n\nAfter we had finished we were definitely ready to leave. When the waitress approached our table, my friends explained how we felt neglected because of the way that we were treated at the door, in addition to being ignored because of what we could see, was probably our age. She didn't seem to care, and we later found out, that she told the man at the door what we had said.\n\nAs we were signing our checks, the man from the door approached us and told us that we needed to leave as soon as we were finished signing our checks. Then he escorted us to the door where he opened the elevators for us so that he could get us out faster.\n\nObviously unhappy with the way that we were treated, we described our incident to an attendant downstairs who called the manager down for us. The manager also wasn't too concerned  about our story and accused us of having fake IDs (despite the fact that the man upstairs didn't even look at them), and then said that we had given our side of the story but he would check with his staff. He had no intentions of taking us seriously. We got his manager's name, and that manager's name as well. Don't think it will make any difference though. \n\nSo basically, as we felt, we were discriminated against because we were young and it was assumed that we didn't have money to be there or tip well. Coincidently, we were talking about our experience in a parking garage and a woman overheard us and asked if we had just been at the Starlight Room! We couldn't believe that she knew where we had just been! She explained that she had worked there and that it was regular policy to treat younger customers disrespectfully. Apparently the staff equates youth to poor and unimportant. \n\nIt's really unfortunate that this experience took place because the hotel (Sir Francis Drake) and the Starlight Room was amazingly beautiful. It has a breathtaking view and classiness reminiscent of the 1930s. I only gave one star because of the view and the decor, and also because I had to in order to submit my review. My first trip to San Francisco was ruined because of the appalling behavior of the staff of the Starlight Room.", "author": "Leeann M."}

When you walk into a club and no one else is wearing a blazer, don't despair, even though your hair is starting to fall out. You could at least try taking off your blazer. Then you won't look as old. It only takes a second. And don't be a sketchy guy or run into people on the dance floor. This isn't the trading floor.\r\n\r\nOh, and if you live in, like Vallejo or San Jose, why do you bother driving so far just for a Wedneday night? Do you have a job?\r\n\r\nHere's one other tip: If you meet someone, and you notice something unusual about them, like maybe their race or hair color or height or profession, don't say, \"Hey, I have a ____ fetish.\" It's not a turn-on. I haven't been, but I hear lines like that may be okay at the Power Exchange. Maybe save the line for there? Thanks.\r\n\r\nBut the view at Starlight is really nice.", "author": "Ellie P."}

The view from the place is spectacular.  It's breath taking to experience the sunset from this spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-02", "description": "Sunday's A Drag is now 5 years old, which is a long run for any performance production in this always percolating entertainment mecca called San Francisco.  When you take two of the most respected, vital, dedicated local legends with a great idea and let them do their thing, you sometimes get the Gold Ring, and Donna Sachet along with Harry Denton have done that with this sassy, classy brunch show in one of the most magnificent top floor Hotel showrooms with a view, in the charming Sir Francis Drake Hotel that graces the urbane top end retail scene surrounding Union Square.  \n\nMy partner and I decided on the Noon show, made a reservation and arrived at 11:30.  We were greeted by a young stud turned out in a tuxedo with contemporary flair who seated us in a beautiful red booth where we had a great view of the bar. the stage and quick access to the lavish buffet and fresh cooking stations which offered an abundant, gorgeous array of fresh fruits, juices, pastries, bagels, french toast, bacon, sausage, vegetables and potatoes, plus the cook to order omelet station and carving station that served up the slice of prime rib you ask for.  With all this came fixings of every possible size, shape, taste and preference, talk about abundant and lavish and those words capture the bounty and impeccable quality of this brunch.\n\nAt Noon the first show started with a terrific light show of spots and colors along with some great, upbeat music.  Donna Sachet, the first lady of San Francisco, entered the showroom singing and took immediate and loving command of a show that had us crying from laughing and applauding wildly for some of the best classic drag I've ever seen.  Donna doesn't lip sync which is almost never the case in any drag show, and she is GOOD!  The songs she selected were just perfect and her sharp, spontaneous humor made the show fly by almost too quickly.  There were three additional performers at this particular show and each was sensational and a show stopper in her own right.  Holotta Tymes is sensational, a show stopper in her own right with a number combining Lady Gaga and Baby Jane in the infamous telephone routine, and then a hilarious and sexy Mae West type song.  She's really a terrific actress and knows her craft well.  Also in the cast was Cassandra Cass, also a towering inferno of talent and a television star to boot.  Rounding out the the cast was Lady Tia, another star in her own right.\n\nThe show is supposedly based on the Looonnnnngggggg running shows at Finocchio's which was the most legendary drag show in America for at least a half a century.  But this is a different type of event, and as fun as any live show in San Francisco, loaded with talent thanks to the Grand Dame of this City Donna Sachet and the amazing Mr. San Francisco, Harry Denton.  This is an only in San Francisco event that I hope runs forever, and you get an excellent brunch, great cocktails and champers, fabulous service and a great mix of folks from all over the world.

Five pieces of shrimp if you want seafood, and all these plates are $15-20 each.  The dessert chocolate mousse was delicious though.  Definitely have dinner beforehand.  Drinks are overly-priced as well.  For two people, you're bound to spend over $100 just sipping cocktails, plus additional cover charge for an evening of live band and DJ.

Once for the night club and once for the Brunch/Sunday's a Drag Show.\n\nAs a club I would give it 4 stars.  The interior is lovely with fabric walls and decor that makes me think of old Hollywood ... but I shouldn't be surprised, because from what I hear that is very Harry (Denton).  Everything is clean, and the bathrooms are enormous (at least the girls is), I think this is the one SF club where I have not had to stand in line.  And from the 30 story height you get some killer views of the City.  Despite all that I felt a little out of place.  The DJ was OK, but he wouldn't play our song request ... I guess because it wasn't a top 40, or Michael Jackson circa 1984 (not that there is anything wrong with that).\n\nDefinite 5 stars for the Sunday Brunch show.  The buffet was super good ... they has this smoked salmon dish ... I can't even explain what it was but it was good.  And truffle deviled eggs!  There was so much good stuff to choose from ... even for those who have to eat gluten free, you won't be sad that you have to bypass the fresh croissants and chocolate french toast (well OK ... that one does hurt a little).  But you can console yourself with a Bellini (oh, my kingdom for a good Bellini).\n\nJust be sure to make and early enough reservation because you can't get up during the show to get seconds, or thirds.  You should probably be sure to finish eating before the show starts anyway, because eating and laughing at the same time usually result in choking.  This show is so San Francisco and should be seen at least once by locals and tourists alike.", "author": "Karly L."}

I was only half-right.\n\nThe cover charge was $20, and I felt like I was standing in line at a Vegas strip club, which is something that no self-respecting gay man should ever have to do. Once inside, there was a Sly and the Family Stone cover band blocking the nice part of the view facing Union Square, so my $20 didn't even get me a nice view.\n\nWhile I stepped away to get my drink, Harry Denton himself came over to say hello to my group and took a picture with them. \n\n\"Did he at least buy you a round?\" I asked when I returned.\n\nNot a chance.\n\nMy $10 vodka gimlet was fine, but disastrously overpriced. It was made from Absolut (you know, the vodka/lighter fluid that you can use to make a cheap cosmo or light your barbecue?) and served to me by a bartender in a white jacket.\n\nThe highlight of the trip was watching a couple begin to have \"relations\" in the window of the hotel across the way. \n\nI think we stayed there all of 20 minutes, meaning that I basically paid $1 per minute for my trip to Harry Denton's Starlight Room. I could have called Miss Cleo and had a very enlightening conversation for that price.\n\nThe one highlight -- those famous elderly twins, Marian and Vivian Brown, were in the lobby of the hotel on our way out. I asked my friend why he didn't stop to get his picture taken with them, and he chalked it up to being \"creeped out\" by the experience.\n\nWe wandered down Geary to Polk and had fantastic cocktails at Lush.

This is perfect place to go if you want to relax after a long day of work and sit back with a cocktail. Upon entering the Starlight Room I was greeted by a friendly staff. I sat at the bar to order drinks and the bartenders Jay and Kenny took care of me. I told them I wanted something sweet and they came up with a special concoction that didn't even have a name. The drink they made me contained a lot of alcohol but I couldn't taste it because it was masked by fruit flavors (orange/passion fruit/pineapple). But I highly recommend the orange flavored mojito, the Cable Car, and the Lemon Drop. The bartenders are really creative with mixing different drinks to suit your needs. The drinks are a little bit more expensive but well worth it. \n\nOn Wednesday nights they have a promoter (Indulgence) that draws in a younger crowd (20's and 30's). It gets packed on Wednesday nights because the DJ's spin some wild mixes. On the other nights, they have a live band that plays jazz. But overall, it's a great view and a good drink. What more can you ask for? \n\nThe dcor is nice with a chandelier at the entrance near the bar area. Everything is covered in scarlet red (Harry Denton's favorite color). I prefer reserving a booth as it is more comfortable. But the side seating by the windows are also good if you want a view and to be away from the crowd.

It's a very \"glamorous\" place (in my opinion, the glamour of it all is deteriorating with the ghetto debauchery flowing into the city to shake it's booty on a nightly basis). I have been there on a Wednesday night (their big night) and all the B&T swims over from 111 Mina. If you want to go big on Wednesday, it's not a bad place but just prepare yourself for the crowd. Their food is okay and they serve late so if you have downed too many cocktails you still have ways of saving your self from your drunk self.\n\nIt's MUCH better for organized events. I have been there on a couple of occasions for prearranged parties and the class of the starlight room was definitely better preserved.", "author": "Rada I."}

I have enough trouble as it is trying to meet a girl around my age in SF. But I guess if I was older, I could potentially see myself in a place like this.\n\nThe interior is nice, the views are pretty tight, and there's lots of booths. However, the drinks and cover are too expensive, the dance floor is small in relation to the rest of the club, which probably has something to do with the older crowd, and the bouncers can get annoying.\n\nMaybe I'll give Starlight Room another chance in about 20 years.

The elevator took twenty years (where we rambled on and on about how Harry Denton is known to run around with his pants off on Sundays), and once we go up there, it reminded me of an old movie theater. Red and luscious with a tacky feel to it. We didn't have too much trouble getting an intimate booth and the view is definitely spectacular. I tried to follow along with the ingredients on the cocktail menu, but I had no idea what half of them were. I didn't know if I was a country bumpkin or had failed at being a worldly alcoholic. After looking up \"creme de mure\" in Wikipedia on my iphone, I ordered a \"Starry Night,\" and found it to be quite the bubbly treat. We all shared a salumi plate and gushed about how much we love prosciutto. One day when I have some money to blow, I'll come here again. Until then, this place is a little overrated in my book.\n\nOh, and I guess I got so impatient with elevator on the way down, that I suffered through 21 flights of stairs.", "author": "Natasha P."}

I think the decor is fine and the vintage jazz playing when I entered was charming...that's all subjective.  The fact that the hostess proceeded to place me and every other single woman who entered after me into a netherworld without view or service is a fact. I couldn't see the band through the barricade that I was seated behind, though I could hear them warming up in cacophonous attempts to match the piped in music. (That was painful.) \n\nI couldn't enjoy the reputed view, despite the fact that there were small tables with views available.  I was able to enjoy the view of all of the couples enjoying the view. So much for something to pleasant to ponder while I enjoyed my drink... the one I ordered in an attempt to make the best of it.  \n\nI should have known better --  that drink arrived ten minutes later despite the fact that the bar wasn't busy.  I also had a good view of my server drinking her bottled water and chatting up the bar tender, before she leisurely sauntered over to my table with my drink, plopped it on the table and then remembered that she ought to put a bar napkin under it. (When it's not called common sense, it's called \"training.\" Harry Denton's could use both.) When the server asked me if I wanted something from the menu and I told her I didn't think I could order, because I  couldn't read the menu in the dark, she made a lame attempt to explain the menu to me, which only convinced me that it was more boring than it was abbreviated. (Apparently Harry Denton's is just a place to get drunk, which may explain why there is no need to be attentive to service.) By then, I knew then I was in the wrong place.  \n\nI bolted my drink and tossed my credit card on the table.  Time ticked by, which I passed by watching the effusive host escorting couples to their tables with views and by trying to ignore the racket the band was making. Finally, my \"server\" decided to check on me and when she saw my credit card she said \"Oh, are you done?\" (This lack of common sense is a kind of stupid that defies training.) \n\nI have left restaurants in a hurry to leave the bad memory behind, but in this case, I signed the receipt and  literally ran from the establishment. I mean really ran and so fast, I nearly knocked over my chair and the look on the host's face said he was wondering if I was a dine and dash. (Ha! Dining would have required a legible menu and service.) I will never, ever go back.  Subjectively, I am pretty sure this may be a portal to hell. Objectively, it was an excruciatingly long experience in inconsideration.", "author": "Sheila S."}

First of all about what it means to truly be a socialite, and secondly, to know that a drag show is just that, lip syncing.\n\nSo, Harry Denton, what a doll, couldn't hurt a living thing (that's where him and I differ the most), but truly, truly the most charming and hospitable host. \n\nHere is a little food for thought for those who can't appreciate the 1930's posh elegance of the lounge. If every club, bar, and lounge in the city looked the same, life would be boring!!! And 2, when you have your own lounge, you can decorate it the way you want, and see if someone doesn't like your taste. \n\nOn to the food. If you have ever eaten at one of those brunches done by the corporate hotels, you know which ones they are, you spent the night at one on your senior ball. You would know that the brunch menu isnt that much more decadent than going to Denny's. The brunch at Harry's is varied and cooked very well, however its really hard to appreciate it when you arrive late (second act of the show) and wait until your 5th mimosa to enjoy it.\n\nThe queens. I have seen a lot of drag shows in my time, and it is true, there aren't many good ones left. Come to think of it, there aren't many of the great drag queens left, bless their souls. But if I were to suggest, which I am, a show where you get a great blend of drag talent, old & new, elegant & sassy alike, then this is the show for you. You can bring your boss and his wife here, you can bring your folks here (explain to dad first), or just come with your friends and enjoy a great breakfast and some cocktails on Sunday morning, like a true socialite does. \n\nThe last show I attended was with my best friend, well bf at the time, and his sister visiting from Florida. I believe it was the normal cast including Cassandra and a queen I have never seen before but loved her performance of \"Here Comes the Rain Again\" by the Eurythmics. And the Lucile Ball Veggie Vitamin performance by Holotta Tymes was incredible, makes me tinkly myself just a little every time. But if you havent seen her work, her wicked wicked way, Lady Tia. Just when I thought I had heard enough of Jennifer Hudson and \"How much I am going to Love her\", Lady Tia done turned her out one more time in a vocally and physically perfect sync of the song. Had chills, no doubt, I had chills. Our guest videotaped the entire performance and still calls us from Florida to tell us she showed it to someone else who is visiting SF in the near future.\n\nSo from a real socialite, Thank You Harry, and Thank You Ladies!", "author": "Michael M."}

This place was not conducive to a DJ at all. It's a small venue with a tiny dance floor, cramped hallway with an overcrowded bar. It couldn't pull off a club vibe and the music was too loud to lounge, which by my definition is hanging out, talking, and chilling with friends, but it it was to noisy to have a conversation. It's too bad, because most of the space is taken up by tables that would be perfect to lounge at. Clubs can be loud, because you spend most of your time dancing. The crowd was a weird mix and mostly middle aged, I'm guessing, hotel guests. To boot the service was awful, with a horrible bartender that took forever to serve us. I can't believe we paid cover. There are sooo many better places that don't charge you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-04", "description": "Update: 1 day after I phoned the Starlight Room to make a complaint, the company's general cashier telephoned me and resolved the issue. In the spirit of good customer relations, he stated that he would credit $21 to my credit card account, which amount is equal to the $10 cover charge and the $11 refreshment cost. Despite this resolution, I added only 1 star to my original review because at the time of my visit no employee told me that the Starlight Room would place a hold on my credit card for an amount equal to 125 percent of the cover charge cost and a $50 hold for the cost of one drink ($9 plus $2 tip) despite the fact that I did not start a bar tab and paid for the drink by signing and closing my credit card authorization ticket in the amount of $11 when the bartender served it. The general cashier told me that within approximately 2-3 days after the original transaction date an $11.00 charge would have replaced automatically on my credit card statement the $50 hold charge for the drink. He said that he does not understand why it happens, but frequently the Starlight Room bar automatically places a $50 hold on one's credit card for approximately 2-3 days. Furthermore, before using my credit card at the bar, I used it at the door to pay the $10 cover charge by signing and closing the credit card authorization ticket in the amount of $10. The general cashier told me that the Starlight Room automatically placed a hold on my credit card equal to 125 percent of the $10.00 cover charge because such is a frequent practice of the business. He told me that within approximately 2-3 days after the original credit card transaction, a $10 charge would have replaced the $12.50 hold on my credit card statement. When I visited the Starlight Room, no employee informed me that the business would place a hold on my credit card for an amount equal to 125% of the cover charge cost and a hold for $50 for the cost of the drink. This worrisome, time-wasting experience has taught me one thing: in the future I will refrain from using a credit or debit card to pay for entertainment or drinks if I am not familiar already with the establishment's business practices. Instead, I will pay cash.\n\nOriginal review, February 5, 2012: Do not use a credit card or a debit card to pay for anything in Harry Denton's Starlight Room, 450 Powell Street, San Francisco, Ca. Do not risk using your credit card, and carefully review your bill to see if it has overcharges before you pay cash for anything at Harry Denton's Starlight Room. If you must go to either Harry Denton's Starlight Room or the Sir Francisco Drake Hotel, which are both in the same building and appear to be part of the same company, I recommend that you not risk overcharges on your credit card by paying with your credit card for anything in either establishment. Pay cash only. I was a guest in the Harry Denton's Starlight Room on a night in February 2012 when there was a $10.00 cover charge. A live band was playing that night. The band did not impress me. I thought the band was mediocre at best. Harry Denton's Starlight Room charged $50.00 to my credit card (not a debit card) for the $10.00 cover charge. I signed a credit card authorization ticket for the $10.00 cover charge and have a copy of it. I had one drink at the Starlight Room. The bartender gave me a credit card authorization ticket to sign for the $9.00 price of the drink - Bacardi light rum and orange juice. I think the drink was overpriced, and the drink tasted bad. I think I added a $2.00 tip to the credit card authorization ticket when I bought the drink and before I tasted it, but I am not sure because I do not remember exactly the amount of the tip, the bartender did not offer to give me a copy of the ticket, and I forgot to ask for a copy. The total of the charges to my credit card should have included $10.00 for the cover charge, plus $9.00 for the drink, plus what I remember was a $2.00 tip, which should have been a grand total amount of $21.00 charged to my credit card. Instead Harry Denton's Starlight Room charged my credit card $62.50, which is a $41.50 overcharge. When I telephoned Harry Denton's Starlight Room the following day to arrange to receive a refund for the overcharge, the person with whom I spoke was not very helpful. He acted like I was to blame for the overcharges. He had very poor customer skills and was very insulting. He said I would need to telephone the Sir Francis Drake Hotel General Cashier if I wanted to speak to someone about receiving a refund for the overcharge on my credit card. Harry Denton's Starlight Room is on the 21st Floor of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel. This gives me the impression that Harry Denton's Starlight Room and the Sir Francis Drake Hotel are both part of the same company. I live in San Francisco, but I will never go to the Starlight Room again, nor will I ever go to the Sir Francis Drake Hotel.", "author": "Jack T."}

No sooner had I landed in SF (well, Oakland --- Yay Jet Blue!) than was I whisked away to the Saint Francis Drake Hotel for the  \"Sundays are a Drag\" brunch buffet at the Starlight Room for a friend of a friend's birthday.  \n\nNow, I have always been a friend to the female impersonator, (just ask Sweetie, Shaquedia, Sherry Vine, Peppermynt Gummi-Bear or Edie in NYC) but sadly, as became painfully clear in my hour and a half romp through more Cher, sequins and polyester than you could shake a stick at, the heyday of the drag show is far behind us.  Shows like this are meant for straight girls, their giggling friends, and their uncomfortable boyfriends.  Sadly that means playing up every clich known to, ahem, man.  I Will Survive (the Diana Ross version, no less)?  Check.  If I could Turn Back Time?  Check.  Celine Dion? Oh hell yeah.  Madonna?  You bet.  I was impressed with the fact that host Donna Sachet actually sang her own stuff (and wasn't half bad!)  And there were moments of brilliance including a hysterical version of Tea For Two - But overall this proved to me was that there's clearly no market for innovative drag shows in SF.  As Pryor says in Angels in America, \"you know you've hit rock bottom when even drag is a drag.\"  This isn't rock bottom, but it's certainly scraping the bottom of the barrel.\n\nOh, and the food was pretty mediocre with the exception of the chocolate covered strawberries.

A lot of very friendly tourists in town, had a lot of fun meeting people from around the world.  There was a good mix of ages, I think the youngest person I met was 26 all the way up to a 75+ year old guy.  On average, age is 30's-40's.  \n\nIt was way better by the end of the night when the dj started playing.  There was jazz-type band that played, they were good, but I prefer dancing to watching slow jams.\n\nThe staff there is super super friendly and really went out of their way for us.  The only slightly annoying pretentious people were a couple of bouncers, but hey, at least they are cute!  The bartenders were pretty awesome as well.  \n\nSome key points that stand out for me:\n*Remember to reserve a table if you want to hang out and chat with friends before the evening heats up!  \n*Dress code - you can go in jeans and a nice top, all the way up to a nice evening dress, it all fits in here\n*The food and drinks are pricey, but it is a hotel bar, and you do get a magnificent view, nothing like dancing next to huge windows overlooking SF!  totally amazing\n*Very very small wine list, no beer on tap, but plenty of premium spirits\n*Food selection is so so, would be nice if they gave reserved tables some light snack, esp considering we ordered food/drinks and our tab was well over $300.  Some pretzels maybe??\n*Not a place I would go to ALL the time, but definitely a fun place to go with friends for a special occasion\n*We did not pay a cover charge - not sure if that was just because it was a Friday night or because we got there fairly early (around 7:30)\n\nGo with good people, a good time is what you make it!

I remember good ol college days we used to hit up the starlight to dance our booties off with the tranny hookers, it was hillarious watching the lame guys falling for them. The place is newly remodeled and it looked nice, best part is of course the view! I was kinda bummed tonight, I was hoping on trying something there but all we got our hands on was alcohol. The pisco drink that tasted like apple pie was yummy and the pineapple tasting one was good too. I was nice and tipsy leaving. It was kind of disapointing they didn't plan very well with the food. The crowd wasn't that huge compared to other yelp parties and they just didn't serve enough. People were literally hovering and running toward the kitchen grabbing food as soon as it left the kitchen. I saw some balls that I overheard someone say was chicken nuggets and I saw something served on spoons. Bummer!

Reservations are required so plan ahead but you don't pay until after the show. It costs $44pp which includes a 45 minute show and brunch, totally worth it. Drinks are pricey at $10 but not bad for the venue just don't over do it if you want to keep the cost down. We went to the first show, 11am seating. Stop by the omelet bar first or like me you will run out of room on your plate and have to top your other goodies with the omelet. The omelet was the best and overall brunch wasn't bad, my only suggestion is they need to label a couple of the dishes (the egg muffins and the sausage topped biscuit). Every performer was great, fabulous time, \"Tina Turner\" was energetic and had the moves going on, Cassandra Cass, a blond bombshell, you won't believe your eyes, the host Donna Sachet sang her own songs and was a wonderful host.

Nothing else about what was going on around us last night( it was a Sat night mind you), was glamorous or chic. We get to the floor and before the elevator doors even open we hear blasting disco music! Disco and a 1930's themed restaurant don't mesh! You have a theme and the music needs to match or else what's the point? Jazz, big band, swing, Latin jazz all would had been ideal choices, but disco!? So, we get a couple drinks and then try to look for a seat...NONE to speak of! We ask someone where we can sit and he tells us every single table and chair are reserved till after 12:30am. It was about 10. We went and stood in the only place available knowing that if this stays as is we won't be there long & we had just paid $15 each to get in! Finally some live music started and it was live versions of the exact same songs we had just heard! Made no sense and he totally butchered the originals. We lingered & people watched and I swear to GOD! I have not seen so many creepy, sleazy men in one setting in all my life. So many men whose names coulda been or were Guido were there lurking in the most perverse and disturbing fashion! We didn't feel comfortable making eye contact cuz men were just on the prowl. Was not an option to just chill out. More leopard print on middle aged Miami blond types then I have ever seen in real life! We left after an hour as it was getting far to cramped to to even be able to stand. I guess the main issues was nothing about the crowd nor music matched the elegance of the venue....NOTHING!

I was saying this is the place everyone goes to on wednesdays explaining why we were here since it was not that crowded. All of a sudden the place is hopping, hired sexy girls are dancing on the state. My date and friend were debating which two dancing girls were sexier.. The verdict brunette was a much better dancer, but my guy friend and I would rather have the blonde. I would have rather had the waitress, they wear the dresses with the long slit on their leg not sure if there is a name for that, but it's so sexy.\n\nSo, my date and I she did the same thing as every other  date we had, she dances like a freak then I have to have her home by 2 am since she has kids.

The decor was alright, and the booth we were sitting in all the way up front was a bit too cold since the AC was blowing right above us, so we were moved two tables back. I think the view is what made the evening the most enjoyable and the fact that the person performing that night actually stopped to have a conversation with us which was really nice. Overall, it is pricey, but if you go there on a weekday and stick to one drink it's pretty enjoyable and the view is well worth it. Also the service was very attentive and all the waitresses and staff were very polite and not at all snobby as you;d expect in these upscale places from our experience that night of course. My friend and I have already made reservations to come back this Saturday since I wanted my hubby to enjoy it and some of her friends. So even if you don't want to spend, please come and check out the lovely view at least.", "author": "Petra S."}

This stylish hotspot in the heart of san francisco definitely sees its share of locals as well as tourists. I have been there so many times, but it never seems to get redundant. This place definitely would have gotten an extra 2stars had it not been for the reservation been put down for an hour early. My friend and  her friends got here only to find out that our table had been already taken. But wait thats not the end of it, it was her birthday and I requested a cake, sure enough the cake was as ordered, but one minor flaw, they had one candle too many. That did seem to upset her a little, but after a few tokyo iced teas that seemed to be a thing of the past. The dj however was real cool, and decided to dedicate a whole half hour to her playing her favorite tunes one after the other. Maybe thats a way for the staff there to show \"oops we screwed up, so what can we do to better it\". Anyways all said and done she is not opposed to going there again which is a miracle cause she is very opinionated lol. As for me I have had a good time almost always I have gone there, so I will continue to go there.", "author": "Raj K."}

Our table was literally attached to the stage, which made me nervous, but did turn out to be a great view of the show. $40 for the buffet and show, all you can eat. The food was ok... the french toast was WAY too sweet, but the roast with gravy was really good. My friend did feel self conscious eating once the show began, so didnt eat as much as he could have, but that's his own fault. we took another friend's mom here for her visit from out of town. she enjoyed it a lot... the show was well done, and classy. it was the first i've seen in SF, but i've seen tons elsewhere. The performers were very talented, and well-costumed, and also not mean. They didn't pick on any of the audience. They helped the audience participate, but in a fun, nice way. The only reason i leave off a star, is for the food. I know it's not really about the food... but it could be a bit better for the price. Otherwise, great show, and something to take a visiting guest to, or go see yourself.", "author": "Merredith L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-03-31", "description": "I had a lot of fun here but i believe that was mostly based on the fact that I was with a very fun group of people, one of whom was turning 21, and we had all been drinking our way through the day.  As far as the room, they were charging a $5 cover (that was fortunately waived after I made nice with one of the hotel staff members on the elevator ride), which seemed unnecessary last night since the place was far from crowded.  The drinks were good, a bit pricey (as was expected), the staff was very friendly and the view was beautiful.  However, I don't see myself going back here unless my mom and some of her friends are in town because that is definitely the draw.  Between the selection of music and the moves on the dance floor I felt like I was at a wedding, which can be fun unless some weird distant \"uncle\" tries to start dancing with you.  I would recommend it after a fancy dinner with your visiting older relatives who aren't ready to go back to their hotel and sleep at 10.  They would love to bust a move to \"It's Raining Men\" any day of the week.", "author": "Carrie B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-11-27", "description": "I've been here three times on Wed night so I have a good idea of what this place is like. First, I have to give it to them for the view and for being one of the only good parties on Wed night. And it's also hella diverse. But after a recent experience I have to thrown down on them for their door policy. I realize lots of wanna be trendy clubs give big time preference to girls over dudes. I understand. But what Starlight does on popular nights is pretty wacked. Most everyone waits in the normal line. Instead of letting in a stream of people from this line, the fat bouncer periodically goes down the line and picks out groups with girls. He then brings them to the front of the line and lets them in. It doesn't even matter if the girls are a bunch of 250 pound ho's from Oakland with 4 children each. He only lets guys in from the main line maybe once every 15 minutes. So basically it blows azz. He could at least let in a dude or two once in a while. It's lame as hell. If you want to have strict BS crowd control things just be total dicks like Slide and say you only can get in with girls. Starlight blows ass.", "author": "Hmmm W."}
