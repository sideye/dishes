I'm not actually a lover of pizza because I don't like bread - I enjoy pizza once in a while or when I drink, but I love other foods more. But wow, the pizza here is amazing where I'd crave it sober. The dough is so soft but in the best way... most crusts I've had on pizzas are usually dry or hard or empty/airy inside but the crust on these is soft and yummy.\n\nHad the sausage pizza which was a little too salty. Also had the bianca pizza which was phenomenal. I'd totally come back and recommend this place. Service was friendly and ambiance is nice for a group dinner or for a date. Prices are slightly pricey but also typical SF prices. Reservations can be made on Resy.", "author": "Sophia L."}

I made a reservation through Resy about two weeks prior for Thursday, October 4th at 6pm. I arrived about 15 mins early, so they seated so me at counter. Though I believe my reservation assigned me the counter since that's what is stated in my email confirmation.\n\n*LITTLE GEM SALAD: summer squash, olive, pecorino toscano re nero & meyer lemon ($14)\n*MOZZARELLA DI BUFALA: heirloom tomatoes, pine nut pesto, crushed basil & crouton ($15) \n*SALAMI PICANTE PIZZA: crushed tomato, mozzarella, peppers & onion ($18), add Mushrooms (+$4)\n*CHENIN BLANC: Breze, \"Cremant de Loire\", France, 'NV ($12 glass)\n*CABERNET FRANC: Saint Just, Saumur-Champigny, France, '16 ($56 bottle)\n\nI adored the pizza. A nice thin bubbly crust. And just the right amount of toppings. My favorite pizza is a pepperoni and mushroom, so this hit the spot. The mozzarella was tasty. I adored that pesto sauce. I liked it so much, I could have licked the plate clean. The salad was nice and fresh, but for me, the olives made it too salty. They only offer two bubbles by the glass, so I picked the non rose one. The cabernet franc paired nicely with our meal. And decently priced.\n\nSitting at the counter was a bit uncomfortable, so I recommend trying to get a table if possible. The heat from the pizza oven made it a little too toasty. If you get red while drinking, this would definitely take it up a notch. Service was great. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. Restaurant filled up fast after I got here, so I would definitely recommend making a reservation.\n\nGlad I finally visited their brick and mortar. I tried their truck ages ago.

It all starts with the terrific layout of the restaurant, where the large wood fired stove is center stage, and a majestic wall stocking wood for future use. Around this, there's a bar for individuals or couples to sit and watch the pizza chefs do their thing.\n\nThis is definitely a pizza restaurant, and boy are their pizzas amazing. Crust and dough is perfect, but I could see them being not firm enough for some people (if you hold a slice by the crust it is droopy). \nThe small plates are a perfect complement to their pizza choices. The theme of modern Italian cuisine runs true through the menu. It's not your everyday Italian restaurant as it's taken the classic receptors and brought them to the next level, without being pretentious or pompous. It's simple, but elegant.\n\nMy favourite was the potato pizza. Potato pizza!? Yes, you heard it. They put very thinly cut slices of potato on the pizza, just enough to get the fantastic taste of roasted potato, without it being a carb overload. Really unique way of using potatoes without the meal being about them. \n\nMake reservations ahead of time as this is another one of those somewhat difficult to get restaurants in SF.

Since that gave us a good hour to drink wine and eat pizza, we went with the dining table. I would've liked to sit at the counter area and watch them take pizzas out of their cool-looking oven, but I'll save that for a time I come alone. \n\nWe ordered the Asparagus and Margherita pizzas, since we were not in a salad-eating mood and the small plate part of the menu comprised mostly of salads. I also had a glass of red Lustentia, which was this nice dark red with a slight fizz. \n\nThere have been a lot of people critiquing the pizzas here, and I think it depends what kind of texture you like for your pizza. There are a lot of ways to bake and make a pizza, and this may be one that most people aren't used to, with the slight sourness to the crust, the doughiness, and the burnt bubbles. I enjoyed the pizzas, especially the asparagus. The lemony taste from the Meyer lemon was like an extra little surprise after each bite. The margherita is nicely flavored and doesn't overdo it on either the sauce or the cheese. \n\nThe pizzas also came super fast, probably within 5 minutes of us ordering. They weren't piping hot, which was a bit disappointing, but the timeliness was appreciated considering our limited time-frame and our hunger levels.

The place was pretty packed when I arrived around 8 pm-- every table taken. To place a take-out order, I was instructed to go stand by the server station.\n\nThere were several other people waiting for their orders/to place their order. The server who took my order was super friendly (in general, it seems like all the staff are), and I was able to quickly order. However, there isn't much space in that corner and several times, I had to move to allow waiters to pass or get to items. It was uncomfortable for me and I felt bad for the wait staff-- it would be great if there was a way to make sure customers didn't get in the way of staff.\n\nThe wait from order to pizza was pretty fast, and I quickly took the pizza back to my hotel (2 blocks away). As I was walking, I could smell the pizza, which is always a good sign. However, when I finally sat down to devour the Bianca pizza with mushrooms, I was disappointed.\n\nThe ingredients were definitely quality-- the toppings mixed together beautifully. However, the dough of the pizza was a miss. It was soft and doughy, but not in a good way. The pizza was almost limp in its form. It was obvious the pizza was cooked-- the crust was charred. But it was like the pizza refused to be fully cooked and ended in a state of charred, not crispy.\n\nI really hope it was because I got it to-go, because if this is what they serve in the restaurant I have no idea how these rave reviews exist. If only because the toppings were top-notch, perhaps when I return to the city I can give this place another chance. But with the abundance of good eateries in the bay, its hard to justify a retry of mediocrity versus a chance at a stellar experience.", "author": "Angela C."}

I've eaten at Del Popolo a couple of times and enjoyed the food, but after this meal would not return.\n\nWe ordered the beets and burrata as a starter. The texture of the burrata was off and the dish was over-salted. The broccolini pizza we ordered was also extremely over-salted. As someone who loves salty foods, this is not a complaint I often have. The kale salad with dates and prosciutto was fine but not noteworthy.\n\nAs for drinks, I ordered a glass of sauvignon blanc that was undrinkable. After sending it back, the waitress apologetically said that they often had this problem - apparently the restaurant focuses on serving natural wines and diners are often displeased. The menu doesn't make the emphasis on natural wine clear, but since the wine can have a more unfiltered feel, it seems like something the staff might flag, or that could be mentioned on the menu. I've had some good natural wines, but this wasn't one of them. I traded it for a mediocre chenin blanc.\n\nOverall, not great.", "author": "Lauren G."}

I could eat the crust with nothing on it for every meal and be happy. It's that good.\n\nI've known about Del Popolo forever but was too lazy to go find the truck before there was a brick & mortar location, and then just too lazy overall. But I finally happened to be relatively nearby at the right time of day and got to experience the wonders of the Del Popolo pizza. It was a magnificent experience.\n\nMy friend and I shared both a Margherita pizza and the brussels sprouts pizza. I always like to try the classic Margherita on my first visit to any pizza joint, and the one at Del Popolo did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful and it had just the right amount of fresh mozzarella. The brussels sprouts pizza was fantastic - I loved the crunch that the shaved sprouts gave each bite, and the flavor worked really well with the pesto. Both had a fantastic and wonderfully fluffy crust that was out of this world. Seriously, I want it all the time.

The menu presents very simple but what they do with the food here is just phenomenal. The price is also another amazing aspect because this place is truly in that $$ range which is shocking because of the location and how elevated the food was.The restaurant is small but gives off a community vibe with the long tables in the middle and open seating around the pizza oven.\n\nWhen you taste the food, it kind of tricks you into forgetting you came in to nonchalantly share a pie. Our first dish was an appetizer carrot dish. The menu didn't say much else but it turned out to be barbecued rainbow carrots with a buttermilk dressing and pistachios. The dish was served cold which I was not expecting but really tasty. It was pretty much a grown up version of carrot sticks and dip. We followed this up with the crab toast that was layered with a really smooth sweet potato puree and tiny wild mushrooms. The last dish we got was the bianca pizza. The crust is a thin, soft and easy to pull apart crust. If you had to ask me it feels like it's more on the dough side of the spectrum than what you'd think of when I say crust...very simple and my new favorite style of pizza crust.

The space is unpretentious but pretty (especially with the skylight over the kitchen area).  It wasn't the most comfortable (small, high stools close to each other, with heat coming off the oven).  I'd recommend reserving a table or eating at the communal table instead.  \n\nMany of the servers were SF hipster types.  They were kind / friendly with helpful recommendations, and service was quick.   Given that it's popular and a small space, I would avoid during peak hours.  I could see how it could get loud and chaotic when busy.\n\nI had one of their seasonal sides to start. the BBQ'd stone fruit with bufala farm cheese and corn.  I love all of the ingredients separately, but there was something in it (maybe a sauce or glaze) that was overly tart, so it wasn't my favorite thing.  \n\nI tried the salami picante pizza (salami, tomato, mozzarella, peppers, red onion, chili) and added green olives.  The dough was good (crispy but not burnt on the outside, pleasantly chewy on the inside).  The combinations of toppings worked really well together.  I prefer my thin crust pizzas a little more crispy so, I'll probably ask them to cook it a little more next time.\n\nOverall I think it's a solid dinner option.  The food and service merit the price ($45 for 1 app and 1 pizza), but the atmosphere (casual, loud, not super comfortable) really doesn't.

Their pizzas are a little different from what you would usually get a pizza joint - it's lighter, a little more chewy, and super tasty and simple. And I also love how their menu changes every now and then, bringing in new delicious dishes to try every time I visit.\n\nMy favorite pizzas are the Margherita di Bufala and their House Made Sausage. I just love the buffalo mozzarella, both its taste and creamy texture. The chewy consistency of the pizza just enhances the flavor of the cheese. On the other hand, the House Made Sausage(s) are a little spicy; the heat works well with the other fresh ingredients on the pizza (tomatoes, peppers, red onions, and chili). I would also recommend trying any of their appetizing appetizers!\n\nThe place is usually packed! With pizzas that good, of course there's going to be a little wait. Service is reasonably good, for a busy place. If you feel ignored, just remind your server what you're waiting for or what you need. They will happily oblige. Lastly, they do take reservations for groups up to 6 via Resy and 6+ via email, so I would recommend doing that if you plan on visiting this establishment.

The char is more than required. The tomato sauce in the Marinara was too sour that it was overpowering. The Bianca (white pizza) was thus a better choice. The good part is that they were happy to customise (add toppings) on half a pizza. And it is hot when it reaches you. \n\nAlso their Chilli Oil is spicy, so pour accordingly.\n\nInsider tip: You can add broccoli to the pizza, even though it is not mentioned in the extra toppings list on the menu. \n\nThere are so many pizza spots out there.

I arrived at Union Square early to see Drag Queens on Ice (!) and swung by Del Popolo to get my name on the list hoping the timing would coincide with the end of the show. A table was actually expected to be ready earlier than would work for me, but the host was able to work things out to text me around the time I wanted, score.\n\nWhen you enter, it's hard to miss the mammoth wood burning oven and wall of logs behind it. The smell and warmth instantly lure you to settle on in. While we waited for our table to get ready we were able to order drinks. I chose the cider (served in a wine glass), but it was too sour for me. If you want some extended time to watch the chefs in action or just admire the oven, get a seat at the chef's table.\n\nThe delicata squash was the best I've ever had (and I've had some great fancy schmancy  squash). The spices were warm and comforting, the green curry provided a nice tangy balance to the sweetness of the squash, the restrained cheese shavings offered just a little fatty oomph, and the sunflower seeds finished each bite with a delightful crunch. I could eat that every day. Really, every day.\n\nService was great, down to the little touches of asking if we had any food allergies, swapping out our plates and silverware in between courses without asking, and discretely wiping up our mess.\n\nAnyone who knows me well knows that I'm a sucker for a potato pizza. Years ago it was a strange concept to me, and now I wonder how anyone could live without it. And so while I normally choose the Margherita as the benchmark to evaluate pizza prowess, the potato was a no brainer for me. The one miss of the night is that the potatoes were way over salted, but given the rest of the pizza (sauteed leeks, slightly indulgent fontina cheese, chewy crust but with a slight crunch from the lightly scorched top) was perfection, it was easy to overlook.

Service was alright, we were left waiting at the front for a little before someone came up there but that's not a big deal.

Thought we could catch up and enjoy each other's company, but this place is too popular to allow for lingering.  We were the annoying \"too busy catching up to immediately look at the menu\" people, and then the annoying \"I don't like any of these wines\" people, and then the annoying \"enjoying our meal and each other's company people\" and it was pretty clear throughout, that the one constant was that we were a pain in the butt to the staff.  Our server rolled with it fairly well, and it's not as if our service suffered - it was just clear that we were a burden.  I was baffled as to why the hostess was doing the old tried and true Touch Everything on the Table, Multiple Times technique until I saw the line of people waiting, not by the front door where I had been looking, but along the back wall.  We then sheepishly made our exit and found another place to linger over more drinks.  \nAs for the food - the carrots were outstanding.  The salads hit or miss (the kale one was much yummier than the little gem/farro one, in my opinion) and the broccolini pie was yummy and spicy.  I usually like a little more crisp to my crust, but this soft, blistered version was still very tasty.\nI'd definitely return - but if it's with friends that I know I want to spend time catching up with, earlier or later in the evening when I can take my time.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

On our walk over we called and were told there wasn't a wait for a table for two. We got there about 10 minutes later and the wait was 30 min.\n\nFortunately, they have a place to wait inside the restaurant and you can order drinks. It's not at the \"bar\" which is a semi circle place to sit and eat around the oven, but off to the side a bit. I ordered their red wine on tap and the beau got their cane sugar soda. Both were good and it actually took only about 10 min for a table to open up.\n\nThe menu is pretty short so we knew what we were going to order when we sat down: grilled peaches with goat cheese and the sausage pizza. The pizzas are four slices and personal size but we got one to share and it was definitely enough food with the app. \n\nOn the night we went, the sausage was the only meat option and the rest were veggie. I've been to their pizza truck and they offered a really good pepperoni and I was missing that here. The pies are not cheap (a dollar or two too expensive considering they are personal pizzas) so I was hoping for more variety in toppings.\n\nThe grilled peaches app was my favorite bite of the night. Really fresh and nice char from the oven. Definitely something I'd like to recreate at home! The pizza was just OK. Again, it was kind of expensive for the size and quality. The middle was a bit soggy as well. Wish the crust had a bit more salt. Beau and I agreed that we had had better.\n\nWe looked at the dessert menu out of curiosity and it was very limited. One type of ice cream (Mr and Mrs), one type of sorbet and a pot de creme. We passed and went to Shakedown instead. \n\nService was great! No complaints in that Dept at all. The restaurant had a steady stream of patrons while we were there and lots of families/tourists. I was actually surprised how many children/teens were dining there. Space is open and airy--dark blue, high ceilings, random paintings of people on the wall. \n\nI can't say we'll return.

Unfortunately, it was sooooo salty, and the bottom of the pizza was mostly burnt and it was impossible to ignore bitter char.\n- SAUSAGE PIZZA - 4 STARS: This was just as delicious as the winter-squash, it was meaty, satisfying and very spicy.

The menu says the toppings have 'bitter greens', but it was actually chard and not that bitter, so don't be turned off by it! The pizza was also quite small for the price, and would probably only serve one not-starving person. I had expected more ingredients, but the ratio of crust to center was actually quite large.

I can appreciate hunky beefcakes but am I the only that finds this hella awkward? Sometimes a girl just wants to get down and get her meat sweats on--those ladies were proper AF. You know if it was in the U.S., those dudes would have been torn to shreds on top of the bbq grill. Thirsty American females. Ok, maybe I should speak for myself. =X\n\nMy friend said that our cute waiter at Del Popolo looks like one of her associates. He ended up posing for the camera and unbutton his shirt a little, all in good fun of course. If you want to be entertained, our server was really fun and a sweetheart--too bad we didn't get his name. \n\nMy friends and I came to Del Popolo (owners formerly worked at Flour + Water) on their 6th night of the grand opening of their brick and mortar. They accept limited reservations for parties 4 or more. Unless you have reservations, I wouldn't come with a party more than 4 as the space isn't large. On Sunday night, we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. They will text you when your table is ready. There's no bar at Del Popolo but there's a bunch nearby (Hopwater is across the street and Stookey's is on the same block). Beware: street parking is a beeeyeeetch so better allot an extra 15-20 minutes for finding parking. \n\nDel Popolo has a small menu: 7 small plates ($10-$13), 7 Neapolitan-style pizzas ($12-$18), and 2 desserts ($8). Beer and wine only. \n\nWe started with Medjool Dates w/ housemade sausage, roasted tomato, bacon ($13): http://bit.ly/1jk4jnb. These savory sweet morsels with the fiery tomato sauce went great with our beer. However, the bits of bacon were really hard and difficult to chew. We also shared the Charred Cauliflower w/ roasted new onions, pickled lime, poached farm egg ($11): http://bit.ly/1Nto4qB. This would have been fantastic had the cauliflower been actually charred as the name indicated on the menu. My friend said, it tasted like citrusy coleslaw. He was right, it tasted raw.  \n\nWe shared 2 pizzas for 3 people are were full but not stuffed (each pizza has 4 slices). We ordered the Anchovy Pizza w/ crushed tomato, red onion, caper ($18): http://bit.ly/1Tfdy4U and the Bianca Pizza w/ mozzarella, ricotta, basil, garlic ($15 + $4 housemade sausage): http://bit.ly/1Ndj9rT. \n\nI've never tried pizza from Del Popolo's food truck but I have tried Flour + Water's pizzas and I wasn't a fan so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like Del Popolo's pizza. The pizzas were cooked in a wood-burning oven which produced a poufy, leopard spotted rim that was lightly crisp and fluffy. The bottom had a nice char with a soft, \"libretto\" center as they should for a true Neapolitan pizza. If you're a purist, then go for the anchovy pizza as there's no cheese and the tomato sauce had a good depth of tomatoe-y flavor. I love oooey goooey cheese so I favored the Bianca pizza which had both mozzarella and ricotta. Do add the housemade sausage for a meaty bite; I liked that it wasn't overly oily and overly salty. \n\nService was a bit on the slower side but since they're so new I'm sure things will ramp up once they've adjusted into their new digs. As I've said, our waiter was really fun and attentive when need be, and the other staff we encountered were cool. \n\nThe space is smallish medium size with a handful of two tops on each side of the restaurant, two small communal tables, and counter seats in front of the wood-burning pizza oven.

We went there on a very rainy and cold day. The interior was cozy yet has a very cool/hipster feeling. I liked the restaurant immediately after settling in. We were seated at the individual tables, which was comfortable, while the communal tables in the center of the restaurant looked cooler. Service was very friendly. \n\nWe ordered:\n\n- cauliflower - The cauliflower is amazing! It was well seasoned with a vinegary sauce, and the cauliflower itself was charred to perfection. The only pity was it was served cold. We would have appreciated something a bit warmer. But it was delicious nonetheless. \n\n- squid - This squid with celery root puree was outstanding as well. Mixing it with celery root gave it a very fresh taste. The squid was bite size which is perfect. \n\n- margherita pizza - I was mildly disappointed at this. First, the sauce was too watery, so picking it up with my hand would make the sauce drip too much onto my plate, I ended up eating with fork and knife. Second, the tomato sauce was slightly too acidic, which could be advantageous for a pasta, but for this small pizza it didn't balance that well. Third, the pizza dough was too charred, making it a bit bitter. \n\n- pot de cr\u00e8me - got this for dessert, it was mediocre, a bit too much salt on the top, could use a little bit of fruit like berries to make it more interesting. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal, but felt the pizza was not as good as we thought. I guess once you go from a truck to a restaurant, it becomes a more serious race. I hope they can pick up the game and I look forward to going back again.", "author": "Wendy K."}

I can eat an entire dinner and walk by a pizza joint and ogle the slices on someones plate. You can never have enough pizza and SF has some mighty fine options. I've missed eating here on a few previous trips, so tonight was the night! \nThe restaurant is fairly typical of many casual upscale restaurants in SF and I guess in general. The lighting it nice, a lot of hard surfaces so pretty loud when it's full. The service was exceptional. Here's the run down on what we had.\n\n -Fried Green Tomatoes, were delish,not too breaded, not too oily. Very flavorful. Great Olive    oil. \n-Crispy Broccoli was a standout, so good and ,well, crispy. The flavors were really interesting,mint,tumaric,cashew and had that indescribable charred flavor that's just so dang good. \n-Meatballs in sauce were extremely tender and tasty, the sauce was nicely balanced.\n-Pizza,Margherita De Bufala was really good, not outstanding. Sorry. I don't know if we just picked a meh pizza? and I will say this style of pie is not MY personal favorite, but everyone else seemed to really like it. The the charred crust was awesome,however, slightly salty, nice. \n\nI don't know what possessed us but we had dessert!\n   Rice pudding, rich but not too sweet, and chocolate Pot de Creme, which was super rich like eating fudge, all you need is a spoonful.\n\nThe highlight,absolute best was the bottle of wine my daughter recommended;  BROC cellars Cab Franc COUCOU. OMG SO good, I ran right to their website to find out were i can buy it. Actually a great price on the bottle.\n\nThe price over all was what I would expect for the quality and service (outstanding), but not inexpensive.

I've had The Pizza Shop on 24th which is amazing, but it is more casual. Del Popolo's (formerly a food truck) is the apparent answer to what we've all been looking for. Modern, dim lit, great for a fancy preparty and of course, a restaurant made for dates. With all these initial positives, I can't say that I'm impressed with the pizza.

Not my first choice and not terribly comfortable but they really have no small tables except outside and it was too cold for that. I did get a good view of the pizza being made. \n\nThey were accommodating enough to offer a half-sized salad (the kale salad). Reflected on changing fashion in food. There was a time, a few years ago, when kale was overboiled smelly greens that no one would order in a restaurant. Anne Frank in her diary wrote with despair over having to eat \"that muck\". Now of course raw kale salads and variations on sauteed kale are everywhere. Perhaps the vegetable has been improved over the years!\n\nBack to business. A lot of choices looked good, got the broccoli/sausage. The sausage was crumbled & mixed with a sauce, not slices. The pizza looked big but I easily ate it all. I think the thin crust makes a difference, with thick crust the bread fills people up. Also, it was REALLY good. The crust, topping, added just a few red pepper flakes. Server recommended a white wine I am not familiar with but liked. \n\nDessert was ice cream or panna cotta. I'd had ice cream at lunch so got the panna cotta and it was good. A nice light cool counterpoint to hot spicy pizza.\n\nNot sure, though, about returning. Maybe if I have dinner with someone who likes pizza.

It has cashew, current, turmeric, and mint. This dish was WAY too salty. I couldn't finish my portion ( shared with a friend). The positive thing I can say was the mint gave a nice flavor in a few bites I took. The currents helped to balance the saltiness. I had to search the plate for them! We then had the Charred Savoy Cabbage- braised pork, horseradish and pickled mustard. This dish was fair. The horseradish and mustard along with the cabbage are a nice combination. They go well together! My friend ordered the Wild Nettles pizza, but they were out of it so he went with a mushroom pizza (shiitake) and Fontina cheese. This pizza was very interesting. I wouldn't order it again, but you can always try something once. I ordered the salami picante with added sausage. It was a good pizza. It had some sweet peppers and a spiciness to it. I enjoy spice so I enjoyed it. The pizza dough in this place seemed to have a sour dough taste to me. We also preferred wine. This list was not extensive and their selection was not that great. This place may just be too unique for me and my pizza taste- I prefer the good ol' Chicago, New York, or pizza off the streets of Rome type of pizza! Dessert - I almost forgot!

My friend and I ordered a pizza and a salad for take-out.  I understand why the pizza took a while, given that they can only cook so many at a time in their oven.  However, I was dismayed to spend $40 on this meal, particularly since the entire pizza was 4 slices.  Moreover, the crust had little flavor aside from being burnt and it was mostly sauce with sparse specks of mozzarella and one miniature torn piece of basil.  The salad was flavorless (despite having a \"charred onion dressing).  Most infuriating, however, is that upon closer review of my receipt, I was assessed a \"to-go gratuity,\" which appears to have been approximately 10% of the total.  I have never heard of this before and actually wonder if it's legal.  Gratuity anywhere is optional, aside from the places that state up front that it is included in the final bill.

I've been there twice: once with a large group, and once for date night. The space is beautiful, with the pizza oven as the focal point of the dining room. The decor is minimal but clean, and they have fun artwork on the wall. \n\nThe first time we went, there were about 8 of us, and were told the wait was going to be about an hour. We went across the street and had a few beers while we waited. When we got sat we were told about an all-you-can-eat option; everyone at the table pays a set amount and you get a certain number of appetizers and then all-you-can-eat pizza (you get to choose three different pizzas, I believe). I'm not sure if this still exists, as I didn't see it on the menu the last time I was there, BUT it was a total crowd pleaser. We love the family style aspect of it, and that we didn't have to fight over slices; the pizza just kept coming! We tried the margherita (classically simple and tasty), the butterball potato (surprisingly full of flavor), and the anchovy (loved the ricotta + anchovy flavors). \n\nThe last time I ate at Del Popolo, it was just me and my husband. We didn't have a reservation, so we showed up right when they opened and hoped for the best. Thankfully, there was a table available and we were sat immediately. They have a well-curated beer and wine list, and the servers are more than happy to give recommendations. We ordered the cauliflower au poivre with roasted winter greens, and the manila clams with braised fennel, caper butter & croutons. These two dishes blew me away! The cauliflower's creamy cheese sauce was extra decadent and the veggies were perfectly cooked. The mussel broth was so flavorful, I could have drank it straight from the bowl. Our server recommended we save some of the broth so that we could dip the pizza crust into it, which was a fantastic idea. The mussels were super fresh (not a single bad one!). Honestly, I would come back just to eat these two dishes. We also ordered the margherita di bufala and house made sausage pizzas. The dough/crust is fluffy and chewy (my favorite pizza texture) and isn't super floppy. The sausage pizza definitely had a good kick of flavor, but the margherita pizza was a bit flat. I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to blackened crust, and would have preferred the pizza to be less burnt. \n\nWe decided to treat ourselves and ordered the pot de creme and two glasses of port. The dessert was complete chocolate decadence and a great way to end the evening. I'm so happy this spot is in the neighborhood and I plan on spending many futures evening wining and dining people at Del Popolo.", "author": "Regina L."}

Placed a resy on resy for 5ppl at 5:30 when they opened and there were already 4 parties in front of us as we got to the door. Looking at the menu it is one page, short and sweet. you have different pies to choose from and appetizers. We started with the trumpet mushroom, new potatoes, and burrata w/ grilled grapes. All were amazing and we ordered another round of the trumpet mushrooms. I need that recipe, or find out how to make it at home I am craving it now. It had some sort of eggplant? puree under the seared mushrooms and a garlicky green sauce (maybe chimichurri?) anyways I would go back for mushroom on everything. As for the pizzas we got the bianca, sausage, & cherry tomatoes. My favorites were the cherry tomatoe with pancetta and the bianca.

The leeks didn't have a chance to shine through, and it just felt kind of boring.\nOverall- the pizza crust is chewy, kind of like naan, but the toppings were really limited, so I felt like it was mostly cheese and crust.\n\nStandard portions would be a pizza per person plus 2-3 small plates to share, which adds up pretty quickly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-25", "description": "Not Sure Why I Had Not Discovered This Gem Before\n\nSince a group of six of my friends were attending a performance at The Masonic Auditorium on Nob Hill, we were looking for something close by that was reasonably priced and not a hotel restaurant. I came upon Del Popolo, which is on Bush Street, near Taylor Street, in San Francisco. What a find! \n\nWe arrived a few minutes early for our 6pm reservation, and we were graciously greeted by the friendly staff, who seated us promptly. The atmosphere is \"industrial chic\" with modern touches and an open kitchen, where diners could watch the experts flip and stretch the pizza dough, readying it for the wood-fried oven.\n\nWith six of us, we were able to try a couple of appetizers, three different pizzas, and three desserts. One member of our group wanted to have the roasted cauliflower as one of our starters, which sounded \"just OK\" on the menu, but turned out to be mouth-wateringly flavorful. There was a smoky flavor to the cauliflower itself, and the sauce was delicious. We also shared a couple of orders of the special appetizer of the evening, pork-and-veal meatballs (if I'm remembering the ingredients correctly) with a smoky, slightly spicy tomato sauce. The chef had elevated the flavor from ordinary meatball to a taste extravaganza, to the point that one of our group jokingly threatened to lick the bowl, just to get all the sauce (for the record, he used a tablespoon).\n\nWe had three pizzas: margherita di bufala (crushed tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala, and basil); butterball potato (thinly sliced potatoes, leeks, fontina cheese, and a dash of chili flakes); and house-made sausage (sausage, crushed tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, peppers, and onion). The chef had sliced the pizzas into six portions, so that each of us got to enjoy two slices of all three pizzas. First of all, the pizza crust, is soft and chewy, but still with just the right amount of crunch. All three pizzas were amazing, but I really enjoyed the potato one, personally.\n\nFor dessert, the server (who was professional, friendly, and knowledgeable, by the way) suggested the house-made panattone. Deducing that we all were thinking about those horribly dry, boxed panattone cakes sold in grocery stores, she said something to the extent of, \"Our panattone is nothing like the ones that have been on the store shelves for ages. It's moist and filled with fruit.\" She, the server, that is, had not led us wrong the whole evening, so we ordered a full panettone loaf for the table, as well as two portions of chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me with sea salt and an order of butter-pecan ice cream. \n\nWe had started the evening with a Cabernet Franc (from the Sebastien David Winery), which was much lighter and more acidic than we had expected. A second server then came by to inquire on what flavor profiles we most liked in red wines, and he offered two suggestions, but freely quotes the prices ... and he was not pushing for the more expensive wine, which we appreciated. \n\nAll six of us were nothing short of delighted with the food, service, and atmosphere of Del Popolo. We will definitely be going back there frequently.", "author": "Rich W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-12", "description": "It was great walking into Del Popolo.  Surrounded by a horseshoe bar is the restaurant's centerpiece:  a large, wood-fired and free-standing pizza oven.  And behind the oven is a floor-to-ceiling stack of wood, used to fire it.  The service was great, with a warm, intimate atmosphere.\n\nI wanted to mention two things, however, that make this place not like most other pizza restaurants.\n\nOne is that it's pretty expensive.  I'm not saying it's not worth it, because the ingredients and toppings are high in quality, and very fresh and very flavorful.  But if you get two individual pizzas, share an appetizer, and have one or two glasses of wine, your pre-tip total can easily reach $70 for two people.  If you regard pizza as an affordable, casual meal, this may not be your place.\n\nThe other thing is Del Popolo's crust, which is quite different.  Due to the lower heat of a wood-fired oven, and the very quick baking times used, our crusts were very soft, chewy, and even somewhat wet inside - while at the same time being slightly charred on the outside.  This seems to be DP's style, and it's intentional.  If your tastes tend towards a crisper, drier, less chewy crust (as do mine), this style crust may not be for you, either.", "author": "Richard A."}

We were both starving, but, eager to check off Del Popolo, we decided to grab a snack elsewhere and endure the wait. Luckily, the wait time wasn't that long due to a cancellation.\n\nMost of the seating is at communal tables but we got a spot at the bar and a close up view of the food being prepared. I immediately took note of the wood stack that serves as backdrop for the oven. I also quickly became keenly aware of the lack of space at the counter (and in the dining area in general). It doesn't really take away from the dining experience but the staff often had to squeeze by each other while moving around. \n\nSpeaking of the staff, our server was extremely kind, helpful and enthusiastic.

One of the people trying to get a table was super rude and insulting to the hostess, but she took it with stride and was immediately very pleasant when helping us. Also - we needed to change our reservation time last minute due to traffic, and she was super helpful with this.\n\nWines: actually much cheaper by the bottle than by the glass.\n  - N2 wines Barbera blend: smooth, easy to drink\n  - Fausse piste Oregon syrah: not as full bodied as your usual syrah, but it was good with pizza\n\nStarters: \n1. Winter chicory salad: I liked the thinly sliced persimmon. The honey and the Jersey milk ricotta helped cut the bitterness of the greens\n2. Barbecue carrots: very interesting - good smokiness and a bit of char, along with pistachios and buttermilk at the bottom (I was fine without the buttermilk)\n3. Rye battered broccoli di ciccio: this was too fried for me - there was more batter than there was broccolini, and when I took a bite of a leaf, I could feel the oil from the dish\n4. Seared Mount Lassen trout: with a soft cooked egg, lentils, and smoked potatoes; I liked the garnish at the bottom a lot\n\nPizzas: we got 4 for 4 of us to share (no leftovers)\n1. Margherita di bufala: could have used a bit more salt in my opinion, but the crust texture was amazing \n2. Eggplant: the eggplant ended up being a little too oily, but the early girl tomato and marjoram made it interesting \n3. House made sausage: great flavor, gypsy peppers, mozzarella - more like a traditional comfort food pizza \n4. Anchovy: if you like anchovies, you would like this. It's not overly fishy unless you eat a piece of anchovy. It's definitely the most savory and salty of the pizzas. I thought the mix of bitter greens and calabrian chilis was interesting \n\nI like that the tables are big enough to fit all the pizzas, and they were really nice about helping us course them out, since the pizzas really are best in the first 3-5 min after coming out of the oven.

The hostess was so friendly and accommodating and even took our soaking wet jackets to hang by the door.  Within minutes we had a cool seat at the pizza bar where we watched the chefs do their thing as the pizza went in and out of the amazing stone oven. \n\nOrdered the Brussel sprout salad, winter squash pizza, and spicy sausage pizza. The salad was one of those small fancy plated things that sometimes irks you you've paid double digits for, but it was still delicious so I can't complain! But the pizza was the highlight for me. The outer crust was crispy on the outside with a doughy soft inner. The spicy homemade sausage was so good I don't think I can eat any other sausage for a while just knowing it won't taste as good. Then for the butternut squash pizza.....wow. The flavors were unexpected and crazy good. I highly recommend this pizza as you won't find anything like it elsewhere. \n\n5 instead of 4 stars because I would've liked a crispier crust on the pizza's bottom center --other than that, amazing and I will be back.", "author": "Rachael B."}

We were the only ones there at the time. We started off with the Cream Ale and the Peach appetizer with an order of the Homemade Sausage Pizza as the entree. Let me tell you about the Peach Appetizer. The table next to us against the wall ordered this as well. The waitress brings it to their table and sets it down. The table eventually waves her down and lets her know that they didn't want it since they didn't know it had nuts in it. She then takes it off their table and brings it over to our table AFTER they didn't want it! You do not do this, especially in any dining establishment. You can keep your $13 peach nonsense. \n\nSo two separate parties sit down at the community table with us and she takes their orders. After about 20 minutes she brings out their orders of pizza. Ok, we had a good 10 minutes on them. What gives? She then comes over and says that our pizza will be out soon. We didn't cause a scene or anything, we kept quiet throughout the dining experience. We finally get our pizza and honestly it was very bland, slimy and basic. Whether you want NY style pizza or artisan style, there are at least 20 better options in the city. Good food is always worth the wait, this wasn't worth it.\n\nThink of it this way, they take food off of another table and gave it to us in front of everyone. Imagine what they do when nobody is looking...\n\nSo not only was the service awful, the food was beyond subpar. I do not recommend coming here. Don't be fooled by the line at the door, which would usually give the illusion that the place is in high demand, the people just haven't had the chance to be disappointed yet.", "author": "Kevin J."}

Our family tried both the House Made Sausage and the Margherita (adding pepperoni) pies, and each one was delicious. These are not your buy-for-the-masses, buffet worthy Dominos / Little Caesars type of pizzas--nope, Del Popolo serves only individually crafted, artisan, wood fired pies.  The sausage pie was unexpectedly spicy, but it was a welcome surprise.  One of the nicest surprises, however, were the prices--only about $15.00 to $18.00 per pie, which for San Fran I thought we found a bargain.  The service was delightfully quick, and pleasant too.  Oh, and though we had no intention of getting dessert, we splurged and had the chocolate chip cake and some kind of chocolate creme something or other.  Just so you know, I am not a fan of any kind of pudding-like creme dessert, so I did not even try the later (but I am told it was both rich and delicious).  The chocolate chip cake, however, was in my personal opinion quite simply amazing.  I'd go back just for the cake!

A lot to like, some things to improve.\n\nFirst off...the pork rillette is was something of a wonder kid. Pork shaved, perfectly salty and with persimmons and fresh herb including mint and tarragon.\n\nAnd let's not forget the soft brownie that was sprinkled in crispy perfect toffee crunch bar brittle. It needed more brittle because let's face it I'm a toffee truffle pig.\n\nAnd Simon...he was great. He beared with us through something rather challenging wine dilemmas. \n\nI say challenging because the red wine list needs some real work. Heads up that it's either \"all natural\" or organic wine. Every single red was entirely too sour and too fruity and very few wines date before 2013.\n\nNo one should be served a wine made before 2013 at this point in time. We've had some rough years globally and 2013 is not ready yet. The Californian wine, the Italian, The French...it felt like I was drinking sour beer. The Chianti was close, the bottle we ended up ordering blind after Googling the vintner trying to get some sense of what his wines were like, but still too sour after the first glass. The problem with organic wines is they tend to be more tart to being with - whoever the wine sommelier is he must have a tart or super fruity palette going on. Simon did his best to make our selection go smoothly, but rarely have I had to taste more than 5 wines to make a selection in a restaurant.\n\nAs for pizza...ours was charred too much on the bottom on one side. We also only got 2.5  pieces of basil for our 4 slices. I'd suggest not getting here first thing as the pizza oven is not ready. Our Magherita needed slower cook time - came out way too fast compared to our dessert - and not to be blackened on the bottom.\n\nWill be back, that I am certain.

If you're someone like me and my boyfriend, you'll probably want to order one pizza per person in order to be properly full. Sure, you can split one, but you'll just be somewhat satisfied and wishing you had more pizza.\n\nFor a size reference, I think one Del Popolo pizza is about equivalent to 1.25 slices of a Costco pizza (the kind you can get from the window when you order a single huge slice). The crust is super delicious. The Margherita is where it's at, and the potato pizza thing is really weirdly good.

The Winter Squash was savory, and the Yellow Fin Potato was subtly sweet (the honey is a great touch!) and they balanced each other out well. The crust was slightly sour which went especially well with the sweetness of the Yellow Fin Potato pizza. Overall, the pizzas we ordered deserve a 5/5.

When we first sat down, our waiter didn't bring us water or acknowledge us for the first 10-15 minutes which I thought was too long.

But when an individual table opened up next to us, and we asked to move there, the waiter said that the next party had reserved, which I kind of didn't believe because if it had been reserved, I think the table would have been left vacant for a longer time prior to the \"reservation\". Then, the opposite end of our communal table opened up, so the table of 3 in the middle moved to the opposite end so both our party and theirs would have space/privacy. The waiters wouldn't allow them to move seats for some reason, and they argued for quiiite a long time about it and finally forced the party to move back next to us. The waiter said that the next group coming had been waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes, which didn't make sense as a reason because 1) the new party is not waiting for those exact seats at the end of the table... in fact they would probably have preferred an individual table to a communal table and 2) after the new party arrived, they said they had actually only waited for 10 minutes, so the waiter flat out lied.\n\nOverall, I think the wait staff needs to try harder to accommodate customer preferences - I felt that they were unreasonable about the seating situation. Yes, they have great pizza and are always busy, but they should still treat every customer with respect.", "author": "Jeffrey Z."}

For us, it was good, but didn't live up to the hype. They have a WONDERFUL dough....If they would just stop overstretching and manipulating it, then burning it by air-finishing it in the oven. We got the impression that Del Popolo is more about the \"show\" (like a Japanese Hibachi restaurant), and less about the finesse of the dough and the simplicity that makes Neapolitan pizza so special. That said, we have to say his flavors are on-point and, if you prefer your pies to be a little less on the charred side, with a more lightly leoparded appearance, just ask.

We watched with anticipation as this new place opened up near us and aimed to get there as soon as they launched. That day eventually arrived and we visited towards the end of November for a birthday dinner. While the place was busy and we were walk-ins, it wasn't difficult to get seated right away.\n\nFair warning: if you're a walk-in, you will get seated in the centre area which tends to be large communal tables with these strange swivel type stools that are a bit difficult to balance on. Out of the entire evening, I would say that this was one of the only negative features. Future visits here will definitely be done with a reservation to get seated at a personal table with proper chairs instead of these weird stools.\n\nWhile there were several options on the menu, we were there for the pizza! We ordered two different pies as one is a tad too much for one person but is definitely not enough to share between two. We also each ordered a glass of wine since it was a celebration... and wine+pizza just goes together!\n\nDespite the crowded seating, there was decent enough room for the two pizzas, plates and glasses. Our food came out within a decent amount of time given the number of people that were there at the time and we dove in, both of us having several pieces of the margherita and the bianca. We ate until we were full and still wound up taking some of the pieces home for later. \n\nThe pizzas were delicious and definitely a contender for being one of the higher-end and better quality options in the city. The crust is some sort of sourdough mix though so it wasn't as crispy as I would have expected given the thinness. Still though, delicious and awesome pizza was had by all and we left very happy with our birthday dinner choice.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

It wasn't crazy expensive, and tasted great - even the next day. Their gluten free dough is good too. Their atmosphere is cool. Accent walls, big wooden tables, good music playing.

The squid and persimmon appetizers were both more \"really nice restaurant\" than \"pizza joint\" - intricate balance of flavors and textures, but on the dainty side.  The two pizzas we got were fantastic.  The sausage pizza's sauce had the perfect combination of sweetness and acidity which, along with the nice gluteny dough and the right amount of cheese, made for a delicious slice.

The broccoli is as good as other reviewers say, sauces with the well-crafted hushpuppies were delightful, and the winter citrus salad is a refreshing way to kick things off. \n\nIf you have room for dessert, know they are all great.

Our server was nice until he messed up. He seemed to understand we wanted two sides and a pizza. He said we couldn't have a half and half pizza so we agreed on the Margherita Pizza with the addition of House Made Sausage topping for a few dollars, which he had recommended as a pizza selection to the table next to us. But when the manager brought our pizzas out, there were TWO, a Margherita AND a House Made Sausage pizza. After we said that's not what we ordered, he offered us two pizzas for the price of one or he'd make us what we wanted. We ended up keeping both and our server never checked on us. He didn't come by to apologize or say anything but he did glance over when the manager was talking to us. He didn't even see if we needed refills later in the evening. The service really sucked. For the great reviews out there, one would have expected spetacular pizza with at least average service. I won't be back.", "author": "Jen L."}

The hostess quickly came over to tell us we needed to move back because a party of 2 needed that space. We were uncomfortable and asked to keep the space but the manager said there was a wait of an hour and forty five minutes and the waiting party would not be comfortable in the space. We tried to explain we had waited but again were brushed off and told we could wait for a larger table even though we had already placed our dinner order. When the party next to us was sat, we asked how long they waited, and they said 10 minutes. Because of the managements reaction, we asked for the check, and in fact we asked to speak again but the manager said \"we're not having this conversation\" so we opted to be done at that point.

First off, I've been eating these awesome pizzas from the truck for years so naturally I was excited (no thrilled) to hear that a brick and mortar restaurant was opening close to where I live. \n\nThe reason for my review. I think our order was forgotten because our pizzas took a long time to come, and tables that sat after us got their pizzas before us. This was fine, I was enjoying the place. When the pizzas did come, the sausage one was underdone. Not only was the crust gummy and underdone, but the sausage was raw on top. Scary considering I took a big bite before realizing it. It seemed like they were trying to get our pizza out asap and took it out of the oven too soon. The waiter agreed that the sausage was raw then quickly took the pizza away and said he'd order another one, although really we didn't want another one. He walked away before we could say anything. The manager did come over to ask if we were ok. The waiter didn't really seem at all concerned. After he dropped off the 2nd sausage pizza not once did he check back in with us to see how things were. Not jumping at the opportunity to go again soon, but I will say the margarita is delicious.", "author": "Jessica B."}

A simple but inviting design with a large pizza oven as the focal point of the restaurant. We did not have a reservation but they were able to seat us at one of their communal tables. Note, they have these \"swinging\" backless seats that can get a bit distracting to sit on. Had their house cured bresalao which seemed good but the zatar was a bit overpowering. We then ordered a sausage pizza. The crushed tomato sauce was quite watery and light without much of a bold tomato flavor. The sausage could have been a bit more flavorful too. We also ordered a bianca pizza with salami picante (authentic Italian pepperoni). The ricotta was too subtle to taste like a good east coast white slice. Overall, the major drawback of both pizzas was the dough. While the crust had some decent chew and burnt bubbles, the majority of the dough, particularly that under the toppings was soggy and extremely chewy without any crunch whatsoever. The pizza tasted like something heated up in a pan. It was not at all what we were hoping for. My partner who cooks a lot indicated that it appeared to lack sufficient time to ferment as no hint of yeast flavor was present. The wine we ordered the Frank ... was an unfiltered wine and it was young and a bit steeply priced at $60 for what it was. It was also served a bit cold.
