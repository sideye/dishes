I got in the line while my gf and her daughter saved us a place to sit. \n\nMy gf had the avocado toast w/ poached egg, which was great; the dish was fresh and tasty. I had the Belgian waffle w/ poached eggs, which was a delicious mix of sweet and savory. My gf's had the Belgian waffle w/ bacon, which was also very tasty. We also had some warm and fresh coffees and hot chocolate. \n\nThe service was good and the ambiance nice. I don't usually go to coffee shops back home, but SF really knows how to do them. Also, much like everything else worth having here in SF, you will have to wait, so bring your patience. Other than that, I would recommend this place and look forward to returning.", "author": "Renzo I."}

You have to turn right off of market street and turn left to get inside. You'll see the blue bottle logos in the window. It's not a great place to spend time or work, given that it has very few places to sit and isn't the best area. \n\nI'd recommend leaving ~10 min for your drink to be prepared.

Located in Mint Plaza, it is a relatively small cafe compared to their other sites. The volume of customers in a narrow space also makes it a cacophonous experience; if you are looking for a quiet place to chat or work, this place is NOT it. \n\nHowever, I've never been disappointed by the coffee quality, and the service is generally friendly and welcoming despite the long lines. If you are ordering an espresso-based drink, be prepared to wait for a bit if you are visiting during peak times. You can also sit in the nearby plaza if the cafe's tables are occupied. If shopping at the Westfield Mall has you feeling sleepy, this Blue Bottle is great for a pick-me-up or a small snack.", "author": "Keith H."}

Across the street, there's a huge parking structure you can pay for. Many types of public transport also converge around this part of downtown. \n\nIt's very, very hip! Tall ceilings, bar seating, and a couple cute tables line the exterior. Their drip coffee is made to order, using a single funnel. It's on the smaller side, so I wouldn't come here to do work with a group. I'm pretty sure I made myself a WiFi hot spot too. \n\nEvery single one of their pastries is DELICIOUS and pair beautifully with the bitter coffee. Their coffee is extremely caffeinated, the way it should be. I came in during this afternoon this time and ordered an affogato for the first time, along with some baked goods because I couldn't resist. The ice cream was walnut cream and surrendered nicely to the espresso notes. Will definitely return for coffee if I have an early morning in this area!", "author": "Navila H."}

I will mention that I am not a connoisseur of coffee. I look at other coffee shops as different experiences and do not compare them purely on coffee quality - because to be honest, every one has different preferences and varietals of coffee tastes. \n\nI was in need of coffee, per usual, and there was a Blue Bottle on Mint street nearby the parking garage (across Westfield Shopping Center) where I was heading towards. It was a quick 3-5 minute walk from the shopping center. It was a beautiful day in the financial district so I didn't mind the walk. The only caveat is the level of homelessness; and I don't mind the actual homeless population. But, the entire walk had lingering urine smell in the air, which was very unpleasant. Once we got to Blue Bottle the aroma of coffee was worth the walk. \n\nThe store is very nice and the two large siphons are beautiful! This location was quite spacious and industrial looking. There is a good amount of seating. There are also two restrooms, which requires customers ask baristas for the code (that is also stated on the front doors).  \n\nCleanliness (5/5): The retail wall is very organized. The menu boards very clear and not confusing for customers. There was a team member cleaning the lobby and condiment bar when we were waiting for our coffee so the store was very clean. The restrooms were also clean-let's be honest, sometimes restrooms are disgusting! \n\nCustomer Experience (5/5): I will admit, the cashier was not enthusiastic or overly perky. But, to the point of it he answered my question about the three types of cold brews offered, and they were responses I actually understood! Thank You! The transaction was easy enough. My cold brew was made first and we waited about 3 minutes for the second cold brew. I asked the barista if there was another cold brew being made. He quickly apologized and made the cold brew. He was friendly and didn't roll his eyes or was annoyed by my concern. Another THANK YOU! \n\nService/Product Quality (5/5): We ordered the Three Africas and the Goji (Japanese) cold brews. The cashier described the Goji as being made with old coffee beans - you can definitely taste it! I'm used to drinking Starbucks' cold brew and these were quite different from Starbucks ... again, I'm not saying one is better than the other - they are very different experiences of cold brew. I didn't try the Three Africas but the cashier said it was the lighter roasts and my friend told me it was very light in flavor. The Goji had a tangy taste to it. It is also only served in 3oz (which the cashier did tell me) so it's a little on the pricer side.", "author": "Martin N."}

Artfully crafted on a brioche bun this bad boy is filled with a fluffy egg frittata, thick cut heritage bacon, and arugula. It's soooo fluffy I could cry. The prefect bacon, egg, and bread ratio.

I had their breakfast sandwich with added avocado, and that was delicious! The bacon was perfectly crispy and the frittata eggs were on point. I snagged a bite from Brett N's poached eggs on toast and the bread tasted like a sweet cloud of pillows - fluffy and yummy. I'll have to get that with added avocado (of course) next time. \n\nThe place itself is set up with simple and minimalistic decor -- white walls, high tops communal tables, plants, with a water and coffee topping station. We came in at the perfect time right before a line started forming out the door. This place can get pretty busy and packed quickly since it's fairly small. My suggestion? Sit at one of their communal spots (you don't really have another choice), make a friend, and talk about how good their food and coffee is. Or if you're with a group, come early and squeeze in to one of the few high-tops. \n\nI can see why so many locals and tourists love Blue Bottle. I'll most definitely be back when I'm in SF next.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-13", "description": "If it were at all possible to have a fountain of Blue Bottle Coffee's affogato installed in my front lawn, I would love it.  Their affogato was not only the cure to a little dehydration after travelling, but it was also some of the best affogato that I have ever had.  Even after the ice cream melted, turning it into more of a milkshake of sorts, the affogato was stuff of dreams.  I think I would be in trouble if I actually lived in San Francisco because I'd be making that my morning coffee every morning.\n\nI didn't order anything else but my affogato, but everything that came floating from the kitchen smelled and looked absolutely amazing.  I'd have been tempted to double back and order some food except that it was unbelievably hot in the cafe...I was hard-pressed to wait for my affogato to be made - I could hardly stand sitting in and eating in the hot, hot heat.  Quite frankly, I'm surprised the workers weren't fatigued from the heat (or maybe they were and were just good at hiding it).  \n\nBut to get back to the workers - They were all very gracious and friendly people, pleasantly making conversation with us Chicagoans.  I have to say though, that the workers here were so friendly (which I'm totally not docking - it's always better be friendly) that they were making conversation with everyone and that caused for a great deal of congestion around the counter where there is already little standing room.  So yes, it is super crowded in this location of Blue Bottle Coffee (which is also why it's so hot probably) and I don't do well with super crowded spaces. \n\nThe last point I want to touch on is something that I'm not docking the cafe for, but something that should be addressed: my fiance and I both work as substance use counselors and we noticed instantaneously a new girl being trained who was very evidently high on some sort of amphetamines.  It was obvious to us, and so too would be to an untrained eye - it looked like she was about to crawl out of her skin and she was visibly unable to concentrate.  That's not safe for her, the other employees or customere.  I hope this is resolved so she can get some help, and so that everyone who frequents the cafe is in good hands.", "author": "Lauren K."}

And went there and ordered their $10 nel drip. I had to wait at least 15 minutes to get my order (mind you, this was an incredibly slow day), and you'd think they would be able to make a decent cup with that much time (total brewing time using a nel drip should be around 3m20s) but the cup was so sour it was undrinkable. \n\nIt seems like the only training Blue Bottle Coffee gives to their baristas is to discard the brewing methods they have on their site, and to just rush everything no matter how under-extracted their brews end up being. \n\nPro tip to anyone who wants a good cup of coffee: Go spend your money on better coffee establishments around SF, where baristas actually take their time to brew a good cup. Buy yourself a nel drip setup from Amazon (cheaper than the \"kit\" Blue Bottle has on their site) and brew a cup yourself, instead of wasting money on overpriced,  undrinkable sour coffee from Blue Bottle establishments.\n\nAdvice to this establishment: Train your baristas better, make them taste their brews so they'll realize how bad they are at making $10~ cups of coffee.", "author": "D A."}

I wouldn't mind if it wasn't for the fact that something was off with my drink. I think it tasted burnt? I can't quite put my finger on what was wrong, but it tasted different from what I usually get at other Blue Bottle locations.  The taste wasn't worth $6.\n\nI don't know why it's hard for Blue Bottle to get wifi in their locations. There are other \"hip\" cafes in SF that don't have wifi either, but at least their lattes are better than what I got here. Service was great, but I just didn't like my drink. I think I would rather go to Starbucks if I need coffee in this area again. Blasphemy, I know....", "author": "Karen R."}

I consider myself a pretty strong woman but the number of homeless crack heads hanging out here and in the alley can make anyone feel uncomfortable. They will literally come inside the coffee shop touch your food, phones and be in your personal space. Aside from the crazies I ran into the coffee was decent. My mocha was was too chocolatey and I LOVE chocolate. I couldn't even taste the coffee flavor. Skip this and order a latte. I ordered the cute shaped avocado toast like I saw in the pictures here and got a plain cut bread. Truly disappointing for someone who likes to instagram her food. Even the latte art was a fail :/ The avocado toast had way too much lemon in it and the red pepper stuff they put on top should be on the side. The one item that was ridiculously delicious was their waffle! You don't even need butter or syrup as it seems to be cooked inside! Would definitely order this again.

No, this is not from experience. No, really. I'm being honest.\n\nBasically, I'm saying Blue Bottle is bae.\n\nTo pop my Blue Bottle cherry, I visited with a few amigos before the rush hour (late 7AMish), and we luckily avoided a painstakingly long line that later formed out the door. When my turn came to order, I coffee slutted it up and asked for both the cappuccino and cold brew (Three Africas Beans).\n*****\nI. COFFEE\nThe baristas crafted me a solid *cappuccino with perfect parts milk and coffee. The beans produced a really bold, subtly earthy and chocolaty taste. I want to drink this everyday of my life. How can we make this happen?\n\nBut, while cappuccinos are fantastic, I do love me some *cold brew. And I most certainly indulged in a caffeinated concoction that SERIOUSLY HAD STRONG NOTES OF BLUEBERRIES. I couldn't believe what I tasted, and I didn't care for the high-for-cold-brew acidity level. Blueberries? Come on. What village did Blue Bottle have to burn down to get this sourced coffee to taste like this. This was the best cold brew of my life, yo. \n\nII. SERVICE\nRegarding their service, the baristas worked as diligently as they could without comprising the quality of their work. Also, I didn't see any eye-rolling when I asked questions. No problems there.\n\nIII. AMBIENCE & DECOR\nIt's a step above minimalist aka clean, bright, and airy. I would like to decorate my home like this, if I were a baller. \n\nIV. PRICES\nPay the premiums! They care for their beans, and they should satisfy any serious coffee lover's cravings.\n\nV. OVERALL\nThe next time I return to San Francisco, I'm definitely making another trip there. Blue Bottle is the real deal, and I'm having a hard time trying to find a reason to look elsewhere. Fuggit.

I came here twice during my four days in San Francisco.\n\nMy first visit was around 8 am on a weekday and I ordered a latte and avocado toast. The avocado toast comes seasoned with sesame seeds, a few spices, and PICKLED RADISH. The bread was also super tasty making the whole dining experience pretty magical. My latte was also perfect. The meal came out to $15. You order at the counter and then take your number for food to a spot in the room but you pick up your own coffee at the counter. On a weekday, it was busy but manageable. \n\nMy second visit was on a Saturday morning at around 8:30 am and the place was packed to the brim, there was a line outside! I ordered a latte, avocado toast because it was so good the first time, and overnight chilled oats because I wanted to be really full. This meal came out to $21. \n\nThe coffee and toast was perfect like last time. The chilled oats really blew me away. It was super hearty and came with candied FRUITS which made it incredibly tasty.\n\nIf I have to come back to SF, I plan to dine here everyday.", "author": "Eileen C."}

Somehow they are able to create art in every single cup. The hot cocoa was amazing as well! Kids may not like it because it has a dark chocolate taste to it, but I loved it!

I guess the city is filled with avocado toasts, but still...this one was pretty good.  The accompanying aioli and pickled something-or-other accompanied the creamy avocado well.\n- Waffle w/syrup and butter.  Simple, good outer crisp...which in my opinion is the major determining factor of a good waffle.  They pour a good amount of syrup on it before serving, so it was on the sweeter side; if you're not into sweet, ask for syrup on the side.  Probably not anything to fawn over if you're not a waffle fan, but if you are, it gets the job done real good.\n- Moroccan Baked Eggs.  GET THIS!!  2 poached eggs swimming in a pool of red sauce deliciousness.  The spices, the chunks of tomato, the side of acme bread for dipping....I'm drooling as I relive this.\n\nVenue\nHigh ceilings and lots of natural light (perfect for you food instagramers out there).

A blue bottle on the outside. We'd arrived. \n\nThe line up was long, not because there were a lot of people waiting, but because they take so much time, care, attention..... TIME, to make their coffee. Seriously, I don't know how y'all in SF do coffee but I'm about to slap someone when my morning java takes that long.

It's sort of off the beaten path in a corner of an alley with other businesses and food trucks - so if you get distracted, you might pass it by. The confusing part was that they have a satellite station with a pop-up tent to help alleviate all the traffic going into the retail space - they serve the same stuff inside, but they don't have any iced drinks and it's a much more abbreviated menu.\n\nThe girl working the booth noticed stunned expressions when everything that was being offered on the Yelp app was nowhere to be found, and told us that we probably wanted to turn around and head to the REAL shop. She was right!\n\nI loved the indoor/outdoor coffee shop. Since it was a nice day, you could sit inside while looking out without having the windows in your way. You got some fresh air without having to be hit with the sun. The aroma of the cafe was quite strong as it's not a huge place, but when a lot of people are inside, it gets quite warm with body heat real fast. I'm sure the dual reasoning for no windows was to allow for a cross breeze to come in through the cafe to make sure it didn't become an oven.\n\nThey have the standard lattes, mochas, coffees and such, but they have some cool cold brew selections as well as concoctions that look like they're being crafted in a science laboratory. The more complex and crazy you get - the more expense your cup of Joe becomes. As a creature of habit, I went with an Iced Americano and it did not disappoint. They pull their own shots here so my drink was nice and strong.\n\nThe pastries and desserts looked fantastic, but since I had just had breakfast, I was not in the mood. If you love their coffee, they sell it by the package in both whole beans and ground, which is a nice touch if you're just visiting and want to experience they great options in the comfort of whatever city you are in.\n\nService was friendly and I really enjoyed my drink.

I wish I had asked how it worked, but I was mesmerized by the black gold slowly dropping and collecting at the bottom and forget to ask.\n\nI'm all about new experiences and I never really thought a coffee shop would deliver one. But Blue Bottle proved it ain't your typical coffee shop from the minute we walked in. I enjoyed my Oji to the last drop, and wish there was a place to get some in Reno. Until then, I'm looking forward to trying the espresso roast I picked up!", "author": "Michael T."}

I waited a good 30 minutes in the cold just for a latte. \n\nThe area this coffee shop is in looks a bit sketchy but the coffee itself is definitely worth getting at least once. I usually get the iced new orleans coffee (one of their most popular drinks). However, it was really cold this weekend in SF & I was pretty desperate for some kind of caffeine fix (I was up since 5am T-T), so I grabbed a latte. \n\nIt warmed me right up & gave me enough caffeine to last through the day. They also sell some baked goods near the cash register & the snickerdoodle cookies looked so yummy. That's definitely something I need to try next time.", "author": "Josephine Y."}

The NOLA iced coffee with almond milk (although a whopping $5) is 100% worth it.  My boyfriend and I were not sure what to expect when we came here, but were completely blown away.  I was so in love with it that I had to stop myself from drinking the whole thing in a few minutes!  My boyfriend was the opposite and made sure to savor every last drop.\n\nWe were able to find a spot at the table to relax that had a light breeze.  The area for the line is very short, so it seems to always be out the door.  But don't let this fool you - many people are getting to-go drinks and don't sit down to enjoy them.  It's a very small location, but suits the branding perfectly.  There's a lot of light wood and white, open, airy space.  I wouldn't plan on sitting here for very long, but you can easily hang out for 10-20 minutes.\n\nWould come out of my way to go here again, even though it's in a bit of a random alleyway.

It is surprisingly very expensive for coffee and breakfast and I was not particularly impressed with the coffee. My server apologized after dropping my brioche bun on the countertop. A $12 breakfast sandwich and just plopped the brioche right in front of me. I accepted his apology and ate the sandwich despite this oversight. My assessment was that it was not as substantial nor flavorful than any other breakfast sandwich. The cafe latte was pretty middle of the road for coffee and not rich and flavorful nor full bodied. Seems like most of the patrons lived nearby and were a hipster type crowd. Paying exorbitant prices for average is not a priority in my life.", "author": "Alex C."}

It reminds me of a warm hug.\" - Barista statements upon delivery of my siphon brew. It was truly like a warm hug. I've never had better coffee. Ever. I felt like I was tasting the first few sips like a fine wine.\n\nI'm glad I took the time to stop here before heading out of town. I got to sit and relax with the warm sun reflecting through the windows and take 30 minutes for myself. Totally worth it.\n\nThey had the menu set out on a stand listing the options available. I felt like I had to try the siphon. So I opted for the Honduran roast - Santa Elena ($7). I may have also nabbed a bag of their single origin beans ($14) - impulse counter purchase. It smelled amazing. I went for the Honduras on a hunch. I typically prefer South American beans. I did not go wrong. The barista also told me this is her favorite right now so I was glad I did the right thing.\n\nThings to note:\n- There will most definitely be a line so be patient. It's worth it.\n- Go for the siphon coffee or the funky Japanese approach. Lots of crazy contraptions for brewing. It's super cool.\n- The space is small so be prepared to stand while waiting for a spot to open up or take your drink to go.\n- They do have food. I didn't try anything though. Solely there for the coffee experience.\n- This apparently is the best one so go here.", "author": "Breanna B."}

That said, this location does get pretty crowded, especially at noon. Expect a line through the door and maybe even around the shop. Given its popularity, the cafe doesn't seem like the best place to get some work done, but seats do turn over quickly even during the busiest of hours. \n\nLast time I visited I had the latte. At a bit over $4.50 this is one of the pricier lattes I've had, and it wasn't the best latte I've ever had, but it was definitely in the top 25%. That said, my friend ordered the mocha for just 50 cents more, and it was amazing. Not too sweet, but not bitter at all. The chocolate complimented the espresso so well. It was definitely the best mocha I have ever tried. On a warmer day you can't go wrong with the New Orleans Iced Coffee. This blue bottle also offers a handful of foods in case you get hungry (vegetarian options available!). \n\nIn sum, a great place to get away from the tourists and grab a cup of jo with a friend or two.", "author": "Umeet S."}

Served iced, it was a great, refreshing summer drink.\n\nThe atmosphere of the coffee shop was great too - huge, open windows that let in a lot of light.

No WiFi and the music is louder than necessary.  Wood bar stools and narrow passages.\n\nTake your hometown friends from out of town.

The place is actually pretty hard to find--it's tucked away in a corner off of main mission st, so you really have to know where you're going to find it.\n\nWas there ever any doubt that this was a hipster coffee place? Just walk in and look at the clientele and it should be obvious! But! this isn't one of those snobby hipster coffee places--in fact, the waitstaff and the clientele there seems to be pretty nice, randomly apologizing etc. The decor inside looks clean, modern, and a black-and-white kind of feel, and yet still feels friendly.\n\nThe coffee quality was great, as expected. I got the latte, which had a really good latte art on top, and tasted very frothy, and warm.

We came at 4pm on a weekday and waited 15+ minutes for our drinks. \n\nThis is clearly a popular place to meet- for business interactions or a friendly catch up. The staff is very friendly. There's limited seating inside (1 long table and side window sill seats), yet there are some outside tables. Also, this location is near a business centre square with plenty of tables and seats. I like how this location is a bit off the main bustling areas (i.e. Market Street), sorta in a not-so-hidden nook. There's a strong weed smell in the hood, though that's not to the fault of Blue Bottle.\n\nI'm not a coffee drinker, so I got their genmaichi green tea for $3.

When I took my first sip I had to add a bit of sweetener since i'm not the \"I like my coffee black\" type of person.

They do have an outside coffee station set up at times which can help move the line along. *Hint: if you get the cold brews, they just came out at the register for you so your wait time for your actual drink is pretty non-existent.

I know this is a first world issue but I am not going to pay that much when I know the cost of almond milk.

Certainly, but nothing incremental over that in my opinion. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nAgain, the atmosphere at Blue Bottle is brilliant, and there's a good reason why it's been branded all across the city and the state. The high ceilings in this historic building are gorgeous, and the white theme with the classy accents makes you feel important - as if you could actually afford to live in this part of town! Service is fast and friendly, and even when there's a line they can burn through it pretty quickly.

Am I about to spend a small fortune on an iced coffee? \"$4\". \"$4? As in, less than $5?\" Be still my heart. This was affordable folks (all things considered), and while my New Orleans Style Iced Coffee was pretty small portion wise, this really wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's all about expectation I suppose. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nMy New Orleans Style iced coffee was good, but I was in the unique position of having just had a similar iced coffee from nearby Philz (http://www.yelp.com/biz/philz-coffee-san-francisco-4), which was, admittedly, better in terms of flavor, temperature, and size. The New Orleans style iced coffee here at Blue Bottle was a bit on the bitter side, and while I like that, it's not what I'm used to when someone mentions new orleans style iced coffee that's traditionally sweetened with a bit of cane sugar and cinnamon. Again, this was good, but not the best I've had. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nI get why Blue Bottle has become such an establishment here in SFO, and I get why this location in particular gets so much attention, but at the end of the day, I've had better coffee here in the city.

Sunday morning looking for an early coffee and I wanted to go here last time I was in SF but didn't get the chance. Showed up around 8am on Sunday and it was decently full, but no line for the register. We ordered the yogurt and granola, a breakfast sandwich, and a latte as well as one of the siphons (that I can't remember the name of, and they change every so often as well). The siphon was $7 for a small, but she said a small was definitely enough for two, so I ended up having a latte and a little less than half of the siphon.\n\nWe found a place by the siphons and the Oji drip machine and were just in awe of everything going on. It's a lot of fun to watch them make the siphon coffee if you haven't seen it before. The yogurt and granola as well as the breakfast sandwich were also incredible. The sandwich had very fluffy bread and a delicious frittata along with bacon and arugula, which was solid and unique from the breakfast sandwiches I'm used to. It was definitely on the pricey side ($12), but it was really good. The yogurt and granola was a generous portion and was also quite delicious. The latte I had (not a huge coffee drinker) was very well done, not too milky at all and definitely not burnt.\n\nNow onto the siphon, which was incredible. As I said, I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but watching them make this was intriguing and the product was delicious. I usually drink coffee for the caffeine and dislike straight coffee, but this had interesting aromas and flavors in it. The flavors were butterscotch, orange citrus, and tobacco aftertaste, and I could actually taste them all which is crazy because I don't have a very developed sense of taste when it comes to coffee.\n\nThey accidentally missed our ticket at first (adding like 3 minutes to a 5 minute process) but we didn't even notice because were were so engrossed just watching and enjoying the food. They came over and offered us a free pastry which we politely declined but they were very kind about a small screw up which was a huge plus for me.\n\nAfter one visit this is one of my favorite coffee shops and I will definitely go back.", "author": "Matt B."}

Look at my photo or on google haha.\nMy bf and I was walking towards a vietnamese restaurant when we passed by this BBC location. I wanted to take him to Philz but it was far from our current location and destination. On our way back from lunch, we decided to stumble in for a fix of caffeine. We're not coffee experts by any means. I told him I've tried their drip coffees in the Oakland location before and didn't really like it. We gave the siphon coffee a try. Ordered the small (10oz?) for $7 dollars or so. We got our number, sat down right in front of the barista that was making the siphon coffees. It's such a cool experience. Nothing that I've seen before. The coffee was okay, didn't love it. I still think it's on the pricy side for something I don't find delicious.", "author": "Winnie T."}

She knows me by name and drink! \n\nBut let's face it, being a regular isn't the only thing that brings me back week after week. It's the amazing coffee and pastries. Yes, let's talk about the more important things here. \n\nThis Blue Bottle location uses their 17ft Ceiling espresso blend, and from time to time for an extra $1 you can choose to use one of their other espresso blends, like Hayes Valley or Opascope. My go-to is always the cappuccino! Yummy.\n\nAnd as your eyes are drawn into their glass box full of pastries and as the line gets closer to the cash register, the decision just gets tougher and tougher. But no worries, get the pretzel knot. It is probably one of the best pastry pretzels I've had! It's perfect texture of chewiness and softness makes the perfect snack with your drink!\n\nAnd of course, if you aren't already familiar with Blue Bottle coffee, their NOLA is a must try!", "author": "Winnie I."}

Especially in downtown San Francisco when there are coffee cafes in like every 20 steps.\n\nAs I was saying, the coffee was good, and this came from an avid self-confessed black coffee drinker like me. The way they brew the coffee is interesting. They use siphon glass bulb which looks a lot like the thing you use in the chemistry lab. If you sit by the coffee counter, you can see how they create the magic. It's fascinating. They sure put a lot of effort just to get you that delicious cuppa.  \n\nI also noted they use the Oji machine that is known as the best machine for brewing large batches of cold coffee. I made a mental note to try the cold coffee next time I am there.\n\nOh they serve food too!

There is always a long line that extends past the door, even in the middle of a downpour.  Their lattes are on point.  The steamed milk has the perfect consistency which allows it to hold a beautiful latte art design and the espresso is smooth.  Definitely for the purist, as there are no fancy schmancy syrups or flavored lattes.  But, seriously, this latte doesn't need any sugar.\n\nI have also had their famous iced New Orleans coffee which I thought was okay...sweetened and chicory-filled...but it sort of paled in comparison to their espresso drinks.  I was also really intrigued that this Blue Bottle also offered siphon coffee brewing on a few of their single origin coffees.  The siphon method of brewing offers a much fuller and usually lighter flavor profile.  It is unique in the temperature stability which also produces some flavor notes that other brewing methods do not provide.  The siphon coffee barista or sommelier (as my brother referred to him) was dedicated to just siphon brewing and was very exact in his procedure.  He often used the thermometer and he also hand-delivered each brew with an explanation to the consumer.  Nice touch of service!  I was able to sample two of their coffees brewed this way and I was impressed with the level of attention/care given to each.  The coffees were still a little on the bright side for my liking, but still enjoyable.  Also you get super cute tall glass mugs to drink your siphon brew out of.  A small siphon will serve about 2 cups.  I do want to try their Oji brewed coffee though--the contraption used to brew this coffee definitely looked like something out of a chem lab.\n\nOne thing that surprised me was that they serve real food too at this location (not sure if they do this at other locations, too).  But, on Saturday they offered some breakfast/brunch options.  I ordered the sunny side eggs & cauliflower dish which was surprisingly delicious, albeit a bit pricey.  The other food options looked delicious, too and I would return to try some of their other food (if I am up for waiting in line!)\n\nReally, I can't complain about anything here except that my wallet can't afford to try every single thing on the menu (even though I want to!).

I would like to think that I know something about coffee.  Take a moment and realize the seriousness of the statement I am about to make.  Best coffee I have ever had.  There I said it!  My future visits, I bounced back and forth between the iced coffee and a Gibraltar (Known as a cortado elsewhere).  The espresso pulls boasted of perfect crema and the drinks were topped with velvety micro-foam, showcasing swirls of beautiful artwork.\n\nLeaving San Francisco was hard, but leaving my newly found and mindly obsessive relationship with Blue Bottle was even harder.  This place is legit.  It's what coffee dreams are made from.", "author": "Erika S."}

The book definitely piqued my interest in the various styles of coffee and the brewing methods. And, as a Seattleite, I am always on the lookout for good coffee & cafe vibe. \n\nAnyways, we were staying at The Westin St. Francis and I decided to bypass all the Starbucks in the area to find this location. It was quite the mission. This store is tucked inside an alley and I missed it and walked past to... gasp, the outskirts of The Tenderloins. I hastily turned back and found Blue Bottles in the corner of the alley. \n\nIt was 9am on MLK Day and it was quite packed inside already. The cafe itself is small and had several long tables that people don't mind sharing. I took a glance at the menu and decided on the New Orleans Ice Coffee. I am so glad that I did. It was the perfect blend of coffee & milk with a hint of sweetness. If I live in SF, this would be my go to drink every morning. \n\nThey offer an array of other drinks as well as food. The only thing lacking is wifi... I'm the type who loves to sit at cafes for hours plugged in. Otherwise, this is a must!", "author": "Wendy L."}

It's drip coffee here and they treat their customers with more care here also. I love their Vietnamese Iced Coffee and New Orleans Iced Coffee with their rich bold flavor with that small kick of being sweet. Their hot chocolate is made with the local San Francisco chocolate, TCHO. I work at the hotel across the street and always recommend guests go here instead of Starbucks and they always come back glad they did. They have a small selection of pastries also, but be warned it is quite often they have a line out the door. What's neat is that on their website they have a webcam to show you what the line looks like in case you're working nearby and would like to plan a trip accordingly instead of walking there and deciding to turn back because of the line.\n\nI also decided on a recent trip to try their Affogato. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Vanilla bean ice cream with a shot of espresso poured on top. The ice cream was delicious, and by the time you get to the bottom of the cup, you get a milkshake-like substance where you can just drink the espresso shot with melted ice cream to get that caffeine high into your system. A great refreshing treat if you're craving something sweet and need some energy. Makes me wish they sold some kind of Blue Bottle Coffee brand ice cream in stores.", "author": "Cris-ann L."}

If you time it right, you can avoid the plethora of people turning Mint Plaza into a sea of Blue Bottle feigns surely thinking the same thing as you.  With every cup made to order, it offers a wonderful sense of individual attention, and catering, providing a pleasant experience time and time again.\n\nThis location also provides  a certain historical value with its ages machines on display, looking like half laboratory brewery, and half modern age coffee bar.  The lines are clean, deliberate, and styled for fashion, yet as you stand waiting for your cup, you smell the fresh roast, take a deep breath, and plunge in to the overwhelming aroma of cappuccino, soy latte, hot chocolate, coffee goodness (or whatever the order may be), you're taken to a world full of mouth fulfilling satisfaction.  And pay special attention to the intricate details as they turn your cup of coffee into a drinkable work of art just before your very eyes as you're getting ready to pay.\n\nAnd don't forget to compliment your liquid treat with a sweet treat from the food display.  There are plenty of delectable pastries, cookies, and finger food snacks to accompany your cup of gold.  I'm pretty partial to the ginger molasses cookie, it's rich and deep and smoky in molasses, like it had been churning for weeks before added to the batch, the slivers of ginger add just the perfect amount of added texture to the thick, tongue grabbing molasses, and the natural sweetness it blends to the dough itself makes it a well rounded accoutrement.  \n\nDon't just stand there, get in line, no matter how long, no matter how you have to brave the elements, get a cup and find out what you've been missing.

The decor was super cute in a part of the neighborhood that made this feel like a real neighborhood joint.  The food looked spectacular and I wished I had the appetite to get something.  The latte was pretty solid but nothing necessarily exceptional about it.  \n\nI would come back for the ambience.  It's a bit of a hipster oasis in a tucked away alley.  Tip: this isn't your typical sit-with-your-laptop type of place.  It's designed more for 1 or 2 people to sit and chat and can get crowded because of this.  I'd love to come back and try some of the more unique parts of their menu - perhaps a latte simply wasn't the right thing to get to really enjoy the place.\n\nUpdate: Came back for a second take.  Got a siphon from El Salvador.  I saw how artfully they were making it.   As a quick tutorial (because I honestly didn't know what I was ordering), a siphon utilizes water vapor and a vacuum to brew coffee.  The water is boiled with a heating light which vaporizes it and moves the water up through a filter into a top container.  Then coffee is stirred in slowly to that top chamber.  After careful timing (which the guy making this was watching closely), it is taken off the heating lamp and the coffee filters back down to the bottom chamber.  Pretty cool.  What came out was a very delicate coffee but it wasn't worthy of $7 in my opinion.  It was entertaining and educational, but the coffee was an exceptional $4 cup of coffee.

The first thing I noticed was that (1) there was a line out the door, and (2) a pigeon was engaged in targeted arial bombing of the patrons in line. I was just remarking on the threat posed by the San Francisco Pigeon Air Force to the lady standing in front of us when a man came and joined her in line. I made a joke about cutters in line being prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and we had a pleasant exchange. He seemed like a nice enough bloke, plus he & his companion knew their way around ordering, and following their lead I ordered a Cappuchino along with the steel cut oats, both of which turned out to be fantastic.\n\nIt took a few minutes to find a spot to seat at the communal tables, but we ended up seated next to the same couple. By this time, my wife was discovering that the Kyoto iced coffee is not a good choice for someone who does not like the taste of coffee (I know, I know...). Our new friends asked how we liked our food & coffee, and when my wife said, while she loved the Eggs Benedict, she wished she had ordered a different drink, he graciously volunteered to switch it out for us, explaining that he worked at Blue Bottle. By this point, I had noticed that he seemed to be on a first-name basis with all of the staff, but I did not make any connection until we had parted company and had gotten into our Uber ride where a quick Google search made me realize we had just played part in a real-life episode of Undercover Boss.\n\nThe next time we are in San Francisco, we will definitely stop by to try some of the other menu items (everything looks so good).", "author": "Jonathan G."}

Lucky for us it was just a few blocks away from our hotel, so what turned into a single visit turned into our morning coffee for every day we were in the city! \n\nAs other Yelpers have mentioned, location is in an alley. Not a typical city dweller, I found this a little sketchy... Just a liiitttle. Lines are long, but they do move steadily. On average the wait is like, 10 minutes? Not particuarly a deal breaker, but I probably wouldn't come here if I needed to be someplace.\n\nThe BF is a huge coffee addict. Me? Not so much. I couldn't tell you the difference between \"good\" coffee versues a 99 cent cup at the gas station because I dump so much cream and sugar into it. The coffee from Blue Bottle though, is a definite game changer. On vacation mind, I decided to forgo my regular order of drip coffee piled with sugar and decided to order something a little more uppity. As a result, I lost my cappucino virginity here, and I loved every sip of it! The coffee here smooth, rich, and flavorful. For the first time, I actually enjoyed the simple taste of the coffee without any added sugar. While I didn't stray from my cappucino for the next three days, the BF deviated and tried multiple types and approved of them all.\n\nThe only downside is that the people working here can be pretentious, with a capital P! The BF wanted to get an order of Cafe au Lait. But for the life of him, he couldn't get the pronounciation down. \"Just order a coffee with milk\", I told him. \"It's essentially the same thing.\" \n\nIn the world of Blue Bottle, this is so not true. \n\n\"You mean 'Cafe au Lait'\", says the barista. \n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"It's called Cafe au Lait\". \n\nBlank stare.\n\nFab coffee.

I asked for vanilla but they don't have any syrups of any kind - is this a coffee snobbery thing?  So, I took my latte plain.  The latte wasn't bad but as of this writing I really don't remember what it tasted like enough to comment on it.  \n\nTheir hot mochas are decent but they definitely are not as sweet as most mochas. If you like non sweet mochas, this is the place for you.\n\nI do remember that a customer wanted a drink to go and the barista told him that he could not get that drink to go - it had to be consumed in house.  What.\n\nI also tried the Belgian waffle.  It was pretty tasty but quite expensive.  $8 or so.  And it takes awhile for them to prepare food since there are so many orders.\n\nYou can pay via Square here.\n\nThe seating here is super awkward and cramped.

I'm a huge coffee snob (like huge), and I was expecting most of the coffee in San Francisco to be subpar to the places I go in London (which weirdly has an amazing coffee scene these days).\n\nMy real test for coffee is how well they do filter coffee. So I ordered one. It's twelve ounces for $3, so I was expecting heaven in a cup given the ridiculous pricing. And honestly, while maybe slightly better than your average cup of coffee in the city, it was nothing special. The coffee had no complexity, just a bit of bitterness. Which made me sad. I was yearning for my London coffee. Or even my Santa Cruz coffee which I fell in love with while living there.\n\nI can't recommend this place given the lackluster coffee. Apparently they do \"amazing syphon coffee\". Whatever. If you can't make a decent pour over coffee, you haven't won me over.", "author": "Grant T."}

I ordered a short Cappuccino, Kyoto Ice Coffee and New Orleans Style Ice Coffee.  The Cappuccino was great - the espresso had a bold flavor but was not overly bitter & the Clover's Organic Whole Milk made amazing micro foam that had a nice natural sweetness to it.  The Combination of New Orleans Ice Coffee + a healthy portion of milk was like sipping on velvet and honey - Simply amazing!  The Kyoto (black) was Strong & Bold but lack any trace of bitterness - it's clear taste with the absence of acidity highlighted the chocolate and whiskey notes of this sensual slow drip coffee.", "author": "Leonard L."}

The egg yolk just melts into the corn bread and the saltiness and sweetness just blend together. The sausage just adds a nice kick to the breakfast, and the small mixed green salad on the side is amazing as well. The grill cheese is amazing as always and goes perfect with the dijon mustard.

I am no longer satisfied by mediocre coffee chains. I am weary of holiday-themed gingerbread or peppermint lattes. Good coffee doesn't need to be dressed up in artificial flavors. I just want good, simple, coffee. And this is why I love Blue Bottle so much. Freshly roasted coffee at its finest with the best ingredients. \n\nThe espresso here is heavenly. The mocha is well-prepared with TCHO chocolate (serious dark chocolate enthusiasts). It's the perfect balance of chocolate and coffee without being too sweet. The latte is just as good. A look around the Mint Plaza location shows that they're serious about their coffee, from the drip coffee sets to the perfectly-made latte art. This location is also a nice getaway from the bustling streets of downtown.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

They are passionate about coffee, and letting you taste coffee the way it should be, not with pumpkin spice, white mocha, raspberry, eggnog etc. The last time I was there I also picked up a bag of beans to take home to Idaho, which have been delicious to have in a French press in the mornings.

The coffee quality is amazing here and they have very good little goodies (my personal favorite is the pretzel knot). So onto why I gave this location the 2 star review....\n\nI commute from Sacramento via Amtrak at least 5 times a week...thanks to a friend's party, I stayed up way too late and decided that I needed a cup of coffee. Since I was dropped off about 35 minutes early into San Francisco, I decided that I would treat myself to a latte. \n\nI always check to see how long the line is and today (probably because of the holiday), the line was shorter than normal. Typically, I wait in line for about 10 minutes on a busy day....today, it took 15 minutes and the line was half as long as usual. I got to the front of the line, and the girl behind the register said that she would be right with me. I said ok and waited while she refilled this granola bar display that had products that no one was buying (AKA it was pretty full). The cashier, a barista, and another worker then started having a conversation about something (I sure hope it was a work related topic, but didn't seem like it). They finished their conversation and then she came back to the register. \n\nSo I thought it would be my turn, but the barista then told the cashier to ring up this person who had not been standing in line (and at this point I was waiting for over 10 minutes while watching everything taking place). She finally took my order (a latte, a pretzel knot, and some other pastry) with no apology for delay.\n\nSo at this point it was about 7:45ish (give or take a few minutes) and I began waiting for my latte...considering that the baristas work in a place full of caffeine, they sure do work at a snail's pace (I swear, my grandmother that has to use a walker is faster than these baristas). At 7:56A, I am still waiting for my latte and ask the baristas if my order is coming up (I had work at 8AM). They said mine was next. At 7:58A, I got my latte...\n\nI do get that quality product takes time...I love their coffee and will happily pay the extra money and wait a few minutes longer for a much better product. However, I feel they need to recognize that their customers do include people that have to get to work and don't necessarily have the luxury of waiting over 30 minutes for a cup of coffee. I don't know if I will go to this location anymore, as there is a small cafe near Macy's that also sells Blue Bottle and are faster in service...if the cafe understands that this, I don't understand why this Blue Bottle Location can't.", "author": "Lynelle M."}

I found it pretty overpriced for what they served, my toast had two poached eggs on top that were hard boiled, I saw other ppl with the same order except the yolk was runny and looked awesome.. Mine and my bfs came out really dry.. Maybe you have to ask specifically for eggs to not be hard boiled?? Not only that but they only gave my bf one egg and forgot the bacon..

But the quality of this coffee is insane, worth the price. \n\n2. Mocha Latte: Love this drink! It had a nice chocolaty taste to it but it wasn't overpowering, you could still taste the coffee.

The Ned drip did caught my attention, but with 30 mins of brewing time, it was no Buenos. However, I could imagine how yummy the coffee could be.  Nonetheless, with my siphon coffee ordered, I was cautioned not to add any cream.  The caramel colored coffee was a kin to a dark steep tea.

I ended up alone while others who arrived after me were served with a familiar smile and greeting. After about 10 minutes I was served my $4.00 cup of coffee with nary a \"thanks\". The demographic is what one would expect of the area, take it or leave it. I think I'll stick to Peets, Philz, and even SB given the level of pretentious service, over-priced over-filtered bean, and central casting gentrification set piece.

It was the best coffee convenient to work, so that was a plus and while it wasn't amazing, it was consistently good. \n\nThe cafe itself is confusing. So much space for people to sit and drink, yet the majority of clientele are there for takeaways and are crammed into one area (in the way of all amenities and lids arc), forced out the door. The people making the coffee also take orders by just asking up the line. Someone else eventually takes your money and I felt like an awkward tourist every time, like they were speaking some kind of language and queue process that I just didn't understand.  I thought maybe the trick was to order and enjoy at the cafe. Only I ended up taking a seat and having to go back and collect my order...which was in a take away cup.

Los Angeles has great indie coffee such as G&B, Intelligentsia and the such, I was interested in Blue Bottle Coffee up here in Frisco...ooopps! So sorry! I can feel the tension! I meant San Fran!\nBlue Bottle is a great little place right behind the old US Mint building. Known to have invented the Gibraltar ( a drink that is taller than a macchiato, but shorter than a latte, the Gibraltar was named for the four-ounce glass in which it's served) I was excited to try this place eventhough there are Yelpers who have thumbed it down!\nI arrived at about 7:45 am and didn't have to wait in line too long. I ordered a latte and a peanut crumb cake, both delicious! The latte rivaled that of both G&B and Intelligentsia. I was in coffee heaven! The barista was so awesome as I ordered one to go for my wifey who stayed back at the hotel, I also wanted to bring back some whole beans to Roland L and she recommended their Giant Steps.\nWent back the next day and told my wife that we needed to be there before 8 am otherwise there would be a ginormous line. Ordered a Gibraltar with a Snickerdoodle cookie, again, both were amazing! You can always measure the quality of both the coffee and barista by the espresso and let me tell you, it is FABULOSO! By 8am, they start serving breakfast and because I was in line earlier, the barista told me to hop in front and order! Ordered the waffle for the wife, it was so moist, crunchy and tasty! Also, the line went out the door by this time, so if you are in a rush, please make it before 8 am!\nShould I return to SF, I am definitely coming back!

If you go to coffee shops to order drinks that are not coffee or want something flavored like toffee, Blue Bottle may not be for you. However, they still have novelty items on their drink menu like New Orleans style iced coffee with chicory, artisan mochas, and a special Kyoto style espresso shot that runs itself through a system that comes straight out of Willy Wonka's factory. They have a simple pastry selection, which includes made-to-order $3 waffles.\n\nI pulled up a recent Travel & Leisure \"Best coffee in America\" list and was surprised to see that Seattle  was not on the list, while San Francisco/Oakland was.

Walking up to the location, I knew I was in for a treat because there was a lite of about 10 people waiting just for coffee! I noticed that they also serve brunch so the next day, I knew I had to stop by once again. I had their new orleans ice coffee both days and my cousin had the soy latte on the first day and the syphon coffee the second. She loved the soy latte but felt that the syphon was a little too strong for her liking. For brunch, we ordered their famous belgian waffles. They were so light and fluffy! Their egg dishes also looked scrumptious but we were so full. As a non-coffee drinker, I can say that I am so obsessed with Blue bottle coffee, their decor, their baristas, their new orleans ice coffee and their waffles that I cannot wait to come back to SF and add this to my morning routine. Everyone is so friendly here and I cannot say enough good things about this coffee shop.", "author": "Marvel Z."}

This place belongs in a different category. \n\nI am a coffee connoisseur. This is shade grown, organic, single origin, well sorted, evenly roasted coffee. Excellent beans. The brewing process is unique as it is entertaining. It brings the full body, intense yet smooth flavor of coffee without the acidity. Your are tasting the true essence of the coffee bean. \n\nThe food is pretty good as well, and seems to be changing constantly. \n\nStill, I respect people have different tastes. If you are craving a triple mocha vanilla crapuchino with whipped cream then Starbucks will probably be best for you.

It's your typical coffee shop size I guess. Definitely bigger than what I assume was their main headquarters in Oakland. We went there a couple of days after. It was a small section for ordering and a tiny bar seating area inside. About 3 or 4 outdoor tables. The other half of the inside was a bunch of coffee laid out on long tables where the workers were tasting them.\nI had such high expectations of this place coz of what I heard of it.

Read a lot of good reviews and saw the fancy Siphon pictures. So, we decided to try it out. We had the New Orleans iced coffee and a small Siphon of the African coffee. The iced coffee is ok. The coffee in the Siphon is watery. Disappointing. $7, right? Thought it's super special, but it's not worth it. Also had the Popeye Eggs. Disappointed that one of the eggs was super overcooked. The staff delivering the order was nice. He explained the coffee and Siphon since he asked if it's our first time there. Of course, we said yes :) For the cashier, she didn't even say a word after I tipped her 15% on Square. I could have chosen 'No Tip.' $25 breakfast order (+tip), yo.

There is also plenty of seating, just as long as you're open to cozying up to people, saying hello and enjoying a solid cup of coffee.\n\nAgain, the coffee here is probably my favorite. I don't think that I've had a bad cup here, and the baristas are always up to listen to my feelings for the day before making some recommendations. \n\nThat's probably the best part of this place.

Then as it was pulled away from the heat, the coffee was filtered back down to its flask. Eh don't know if that was a good description, but I guess you can search YouTube for a video of the process. (Kinda like a reverse French Press? ) Very unique and handsomely served I think it is well worth the price in taste and quality. Each order is individually made! \n\nFun to watch, beauty in it's simplicity. Well filtered there is no sediment in the bottom of the flask, so smooth for coffee.

Excellent as hell.\n\nAs a Minneapolitan, I feel lucky to be well-versed in \"third wave\" coffee shops. The kind that never burn the beans or the brews.

The kind that make you into a coffee snob. \n\nBlue Bottle is an SF chain that feels nothing like a Starbucks. It feels third wave.\n\nI actually tried to come here on a Sunday afternoon, the line was around the block so I turned right around. However, come Friday I was glad that Misti Y and I had some time before our flights to grab lunch and coffee here. We lucked out and there was no line!\n\nI went with an absolutely smooth and strong Kyoto cold press and the mixed green salad (baby greens, blood oranges, carrots, turnips, artichokes and a sherry vinegar dressing). I wanted to add some protein to the salad, so I asked if they could make some bacon to put on it too. They were a little hesitant about this for some reason and had to \"check with the chef\" who was standing just three feet away so the whole thing just felt kind of awkward. They charged me a bunch of extra dollars for the bacon and it wasn't all that great... so joke on me I guess. The salad itself was terrific though. Blood oranges make everything amazing.\n\nIt's not a sit-and-get-work-done-and-siphon-free-WiFi cafe, so don't bring your laptop.

I ate here around 10am on a Saturday.  It's sort of tucked away in an alley, which I liked, because you did not have to deal with the hustle and bustle of Market Street.\n\nThe line was out the door, but moved fairly quickly.  I ordered the Poached Eggs on Cornbread with sausage (A MUST TRY!!) along with a mocha and bread with jam.  I think the total was around $25?  The eggs were absolutely delicious.  I never thought of having eggs with cornbread: great concept!  Also, make sure you try the toast with jam.  I mean, it may sound silly, but it was the best toast with jam I've ever had.\n\nThe only downside was the wait FOR the food.  After ordering, I had to wait almost 30 minutes before being served.  I noticed that the kitchen is very tiny, and it appeared there were only 2 burners on a stove?  I kind of felt bad for the cooks/preparers, because there is no room to cook.  It reminded me of trying to cook in a kitchenette.\n\nThis was definitely the best meal I had while in San Francisco.  If you have an hour or so for breakfast/brunch and are staying near Union Square, I would recommend trying Blue Bottle.

Although our food took a little while, my friend's grilled cheese was delicious and buttery, and my belgian waffle was fluffy and topped with sweet strawberries.

I was also happily surprised with the 'poached egg' dish, because when it came to the table it wasn't the most presentable meal. However, once we started eating it the flavors worked so well together and as a combination it was very satisfying. \n\nI am happy that their latte is delicious. I am happy that their breakfast/brunch is delicious. Mmmmmm....I'm just happy with anything related to Blue Bottle.", "author": "Stephanie K."}

My boyfriend and I came here around 3:00 p.m. and there were about 5 other people there.  We didn't know what to order so we asked the employees about some of the drinks we had heard/read about on Yelp.  The employee explained to us some of the different drinks and why each one was special, in terms of how they brew the coffee and for how long.  It was interesting, but I just chose the one that he said was the sweetest.  We ended up picking the New Orleans Iced Coffee and a Latte ($3.75 each)\n\nOur drinks were made within minutes and we went to sit down next to the Kyoto-Style Iced-Coffee apparatus.  Blue Bottle Coffee has two of these $20,000 machines!  \n\nThe latte was really smooth and the foam art was pretty.  A solid latte and fairly priced.  \n\nThe New Orleans Iced Coffee was really good.  They first fill about half the glass with ice/milk and then top it off with the coffee.  In the initial description, I believe the employee said it was \"hazelnut-ty.\"  Whatever it was, it tasted good.  The drink was fairly sweet and full flavored.  It was a nice change from the usual coffee.  \n\nLooking at the menu online now, http://www.bluebottlecoffee.net/locations/mint-cafe/coffee-menu/\nI definitely want to go back and try their Affogato.

Time will tell...I wonder how many of those orange plastic chairs will be there a year from now.\n\nThe inside of Blue Bottle is nice and pristine clean with a tall ceiling, a wrap-around counter and a community-style table in the center. I went full gonzo and went for the monumentally priced $4.50 Mocha with, get this, Recchiuti chocolate.

(BLAH!)\n\n(AM Review)\n\nI drove the rest of the Fantstic-4 members to work and school respectively to get our \"pick us up\" fuel to warm us up on this current frigid day. Finding the newest Blue-Bottle Cafe is no cake-walk. Just like the Hayes Valley location, this is coffee shop resides in a revamped alley behind the Old Mint. Don't' worry, the neighborhood is slowly becoming a safe and less jagged atmosphere. \n\nWe managed to park our van at a red-zone on Jessie St. (Not recommended). At the early morning, Wife and I got the $2.00 coffee drip to start our day. The coffee was brewed fresh in a 12 oz. cup and was very strong just like the Hayes Valley location. The coffee was powerful enough to get us dancing to any music played on KOIT. There have actually seating at the newest location, unlike the Hayes Valley sister-location.\n\nWhen I told the kids that there is a new Blue-Bottle Coffee place opening up, they were very excited about the great news. And yes, it did pay off. They each ordered a cup of Hot Chocolate. The $3.50 Michael Rechueti drink was very rich and chocolatey. Even with the heart-shape on their foamy drinks made the gloomy and chilly day into a bright and warm day for the happy kids. A smile on their faces is proven evidence.\n\nThe four of us are very delighted that the local Blue-Bottle Coffee franchise is growing. And the Fantastic-4 is very happy and alive to experience a great tasting coffee place. I hope this coffee shop is a great indication of a positive facelift to a better atmosphere from a once serrated neighborhood. And yes, we're definitely coming back here to get our coffee, considering that there are many coffee places in the Downtown area.\n\n(PM Review):\n\nLater in the evening, I came back after work to buy a half pound of the beans to take home. There are so many different kind of beans to choose from and I bought the \"17 ft. Ceiling\" Blend, in which seems like a practical chose for me. That half-pound bagged whole beans costs $7.60.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-31", "description": "Mint Plaza is kinda Blue Bottle's flagship shop and one of the originals, although they seem to be opening up new ones at a brisk pace.\n\nThere are three things that put this shop at the top of the list for me:\n\n1. The coffee is excellent.  Although it doesn't always suit my tastes (often BB's roasts are just a hair too dark for me), they put a tremendous amount of effort into the coffee both roasting and behind the bar.  The espresso drinks are fantastic - the shop has its own signature espresso blend designed for that location, which I like significantly more than their Hayes Valley blend which is more common around the city.  The milk quality is top-notch and the pours are often epic.  \n\nWhile I've had some of the best coffee of my life at the siphon bar for the most part I feel Blue Bottle's siphon technique doesn't always get the results I like.  Maybe it involves too much stirring - some of the other siphon shops I've been to stir less and I like the results more.  Anyway, it produces a cup that's very astringent and boozy tasting - sometimes kinda, I dunno, musty?  Every now and then they'll be serving a coffee for which that treatment is perfect but in general I am a little disappointed by the siphon bar.  I'm going to chalk that up to me having different preferences because I know they have planned their methods very carefully.  If you do get the siphon coffee let your coffee cool a good bit before making conclusions - it comes out very hot.\n\nThe iced coffee is outstanding and will definitely crack you out.  There's not much better than one of those on a hot day.\n\n2. Killer food.  You have to come here for brunch.  Their waffles, soups, and compotes are really wonderful with high-quality ingredients.  It's on the pricy side for what you get but it's generally well worth it.\n\n3. Professionalism.  You just get a much more professional treatment from Blue Bottle as compared to places like Ritual and Four Barrel.  I mean, that's not the end-all-be-all of coffee service - sometimes the casual grit of the Mission shops is fun; I like to think of Blue Bottle as the shop that does everything Starbucks says they do but in reality fails miserably at.  If that sounds up your alley you'll love this place.\n\nMint is third-wave coffee at its best with a certain Japanese-inspired minimalism and a bourgeoisie attention to detail.  I should also note that Blue Bottle benefits from a tight integration with the SF foodie scene that some of the other shops don't have.\n\nMy criteria for a five-star review is: if someone were visiting the city for only one day would I send them there?  If the person loves coffee then yes for Mint Plaza.", "author": "Dan C."}

It make the place looks like a fun lab for coffee--- like Willy Wonka's Coffee factory. Generally I don't order siphons unless I have someone with me, it's best for two! The flavor is much more floral and light, it's brewed more delicately and has a tealike consistency. I've never had a siphon I didn't like here, they take their time to make it and test the flavor as they brew like an obsessive French chef that's making an important sauce.\n\nIt's really impressive the care they take into making a cup of anything in this store. I've tried all of their drinks and I'm the big fan of their pour-overs when I'm feeling serious, their cappuccinos if it's lazy weekend morning, and of course, their siphons if I'm sitting down for a long conversation with a friend.\n\nTheir New Orleans Style Iced Coffee is just pure indulgence, even people who don't like to drink coffee will love this ice cold sunshine. The bright fruit flavors of the coffee will delight you as much as the cream will sate you.

We got to Mint Plaza and faced quite the caffeine-seeking line, and by the time we were ready to order we wanted it all.\n\nThe place is small and very cool, with a white and blonde wood color scheme and laboratorical chrome and glass coffee contraptions making up the decor.  The staff is friendly and talkative, and the place actually offers a coffee shop experience you're unlikely to find elsewhere.\n\nWe ordered a cup of the daily drip and a pot of siphon coffee, along with an affogato and an olive oil shortbread cookie.  We also bought a couple bags of beans as souvenirs - it ended up being quite the spendy coffee stop.  Thankfully, everything we tried was top notch.\n\nWe attended to the affogato first.  We weren't planning on consuming too many calories when we walked in, but as soon as we saw that Blue Bottle made an affogato with Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast, we had to try it.  This bourbon and cornflakes ice cream blew our minds the day before, and it was fantastic with a strong pour of espresso.  I've never had a better affogato.\n\nWith dessert out of the way, we turned to our brews.  The daily drip was the Bella Donovan.  I'm not a coffee expert, but I do know that I usually like my joe loaded with cream and sugar.  Not so this one - it was tasty black, smooth and light.\n\nThe main event, though, was the siphon coffee - it was what drew us to this location of Blue Bottle to begin with.  The Mint Plaza location has a seriously expensive and seriously impressive siphon machine that churns out individual pots of coffee through a complicated process that involves glass globes and bamboo paddles.  The resulting coffee - we chose the Honduras Marcala - was worthy of the posturing.  It looked different from regular coffee, almost watery in its clarity.  There was nothing watery about its flavor, though.  It was delicious black, with a silky, almost chocolatey richness.  I was pretty moved by this stuff, so I'd say it's a must for anyone who's passionate about coffee.\n\nWe munched on the olive oil shortbread with our coffees, and it was a great accompaniment, with a nice buttery crumb and a pervasive note of rosemary.\n\nAnyway, there you have it.  I just wrote an essay on my visit to this wonderful coffee shop.  I'm not even a coffee person, and I was bowled over by Blue Bottle.  Between the affogato and the siphon coffee, I'd say it's worth a pilgrimage.", "author": "Steph C."}

I was actually surprised to see that they give you the bottom part of the siphon, which I thought was nice. The glass was thicker than I expected, so I didn't have to fear breaking it. So I had the Columbian and he had the Sulawesi(sp?). Both coffees were blander than expected. We could tell that the Columbian was milder in the acidity (that seems to be the case with most Columbian coffees I've had), but other than that, the two weren't all that different, and we couldn't distinguish anything special about the two coffees, even as the cup cooled over the course of an hour.\n\nAnyways, I figured I'd buy a bag of coffee and try it out with my Aeropress at home.

If you're cruising down Cyril Magnin (which turns into 5th Street) after crossing Market Street, look for a small alley, Mint Plaza. It's not even made for cars, so you can easily miss it if you're looking for a street. There are two other ways you can approach the coffee shop as well by using Jessie or Mission Street.\n\nThe store is located in the middle of tall buildings in a 3-way alley. The area is dead as hell during the weekend in the daylight. When you finally reach the place, you might notice that there are no \"Blue Bottle Coffee Co.\" signs. All I saw was a 66 Mint sign but it became obvious that you were in the right place after you see coffee goers coming out of the joint.\n\nOnce inside the place, you feel like you've been transported to NYC. Everyone is hustling their way through to grab a quick cup of joe except those exec types that can afford to have long lunches and chill out with the morning paper or bluetooth to their ear. Modernize, glass, lightly colored decor.  A seemingly mirage of open space.\n\nWe ordered the Kyoto Iced Coffee which was recommended served black. If you're sleepy and/or in love the rich & bold coffee taste then this would be your drink. I dumped a kilo of brown sugar to compensate.\n\nThe winner between the two drinks I ordered this day was the New Orleans Iced Coffee (w/ soy). This NOLA bad boy hit the spot. It'll make you wish they served it in a venti size. Not too strong, not too light. Quite refreshing. Both drinks were about $3 something.\n\nI also grabbed a Snickerdoodle for $1.50 on my way out.

VERY filling and healthy...real oatmeal...the $7 was worth it for a filling breakfast.  I ordered a Machiatto as I wanted to really taste the coffee and not milk.  The Machiatto, which is in a small espresso cup, was strong and very flavorful; I could really tell the quality in the flavor.  As I was leaving I decided to try their Drip coffee which was Three Africans and I ordered it Au Lait...it was excellent and the flavors were just as it said on their board (fruity, creamy).  I also got two Espresso-Chocolate Macaroons for $2 each to go (one for my wife!)  Fabulous!  I saw someone eating a breakfast sandwich which looked great...next time!\nOverall, excellent coffee and food.  A bit pricey but in this case you get what you pay for.

I love a good iced coffee, and I made a resolution to visit this place while I was in town.\n\nThis shop is not easy to find. It's down an alley and tucked behind a corner. But your diligence will be rewarded with a brief line to take a seat in a cozy yet modern shop.  The store itself is a bit small, but the super tall ceilings, minimalist decor and giant windows make it feel much larger. \n\nAfter a brief wait, the time came to place my order. My husband got a latte and watching it being made was far more fulfilling than actually drinking it. The artistry that went into illustrating the top of the brew was fascinating, but I've had better lattes.\n\nThe iced coffee, however, was unparalleled. The flavors were complex and subtle, and the texture of the coffee was entirely different from any other. It was thicker, more viscous and fragrant, imparting hints of vanilla and caramel.

Read on!\n\nWith all that was happening this week in SF, the long line at BBCC was to be expected. This morning, it was a 20 minute wait in line. When I got my cappuccino to go, it had the nice latte art as usual but flavor-wise, somewhat blah. Still superior to anything from Starbucks for sure but nothing special either. What happened to the richness and complexity? 20 minutes in line for this? Disappointment was setting in. Was BBCC getting too complacent and losing their quality?\n\nFortunately, my answer came in a second trip in the afternoon. BBCC redeemed themselves big time. This time, I went with the single origin expresso from Tanzania...whoa. Single origin is served between 9-11 and 1-3pm daily if memory serves me right and made on a different espresso machine by a different barista. This guy is the God of baristas. He must've weighed the coffee 3 times on the scale to get the right amount of coffee and the attention to detail in making it is phenomenal. The machine is some Italian monster that requires hand press for the pressure. I ask the barista God if this machine makes better espresso than the plebeian version and he says it's just more temperamental and the shots can be less consistent. Hmm. kinda reminds me of an Italian Supermodel. Some days they treat you well, others, they're uber high maintenance with tons of drama. No offense to Italians or Supermodels.\n\nWith the Blue Angels thundering overhead, I down the espresso and my mouth is filled with chocolaty flavors and other wondrous and complex flavors.

Going back, there was a one-hour delay. It was all worth it. \n\n***\n\nBlue Bottle is still the modern model of coffee. Here's why: the baristas and the business. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause every good cafe has the right machines and grinders. Every good cafe has the right beans--sure, we could debate whether Ritual or Stumptown has more earthy espressos, or if Intelligentsia pulls sharper, lemony shots, or if Barismo has more balance--but we can't say they're better. You or I may like one flavor over the other, but that's really a matter of taste. And we can even certainly say that the best cafes have great baristas. \n\nBut Blue Bottle has at its core a fundamental business philosophy that lets these baristas really practice at perfection. I've seen them toss shot after shot if it's not pulling right. I've seen them stare into the grind of the beans to see how they're getting churned out. I've seen them level the tamper elegantly like a slow-dance partner getting dipped at the end of a choreography. I've seen them deal with the impatience (and wave away the excitement) of the inevitable line. Nothing disturbs these guys in their habits. \n\nI've never seen a place so clean of an errant ground. I've never seen a place so methodically wiped down and re-calibrated after every shot is pulled. \n\nBlue Bottle is the king in a wave of new attitudes that treat coffee as a fruit rather than a bean (which it is). But it's really because their business model puts the baristas ahead of even their beans. They train and develop their baristas and then really let them conduct the business of brewing. It's why I can pull awesome shots at home with a semi-professional setup but why these guys pull God shot after God shot, even in the radically changing weather and humidity of San Francisco. \n\nIt's why Blue Bottle remains the model the rest of us are trying to follow.", "author": "Z S."}

I'm not really a coffee person, so I judge coffee places a lot based on their atmosphere. A lot of people on here say that it's \"cute\" or welcoming, but I feel like it can't really be cute when there are so many people in a small space. I would say it's more hectic.\n\nThis place is a bit hard to find, given that the entrance is located behind a corner in an alley. The two giveaways were people walking down the street with blue bottle coffees and the customers sitting at two awkwardly positioned tables outside.\n\nThe chairs in this coffee place are all high chairs and made me feel dwarfed when I entered (I'm already short to begin with). The line was very long, but it did move pretty quickly. The baristas work fast, and seemed to encourage you to take your drink to go, but it made me feel rushed as they were working to get you through instead of providing friendly service. The place was pretty crowded (3 in the afternoon) and there were a lot of people trying to get passed other people, yet customers still asked to get their coffee \"for here\". I guess they like drinking their coffee in a crowd(?)\n\nWe took our drinks to go. The place was too crowded and somewhat loud. My sister likes dark coffee, and I like sweet drinks, but we were both just neutral about our choices (New Orleans Iced Coffee and Caffe Mocha). I suppose if you like acidic-tasting coffee, you would enjoy it because it was unique and good quality coffee. The price was decent, a bit on the higher side ($8.50 for two small drinks).", "author": "Angela W."}

This shot's crema was pale with no mottling whatsoever, and it was SO bitter. I tried my boyfriend's mocha, which looked beautiful but tasted like there was about a teaspoon of chocolate in it.

Blue Bottle on the other hand makes an iced coffee in its truest form.\n\nThis particular location has two types.  The Kyoto style and the New Orleans style.  I had the Kyoto back in June, and it was decent.  However, the star of the show is the New Orleans Style Iced Coffee.  Smoother than the Kyoto, you get a complex roast flavor with a hint of what can only be brown sugar.  Just enough sweetness to activate the sweet pallette of your tounge, but not overpower it.  The organic whole milk used completes the iced coffee!\n\nThe place is nice.  An old style downtown bulidling in an alley.  You almost feel as if you accidently found this place.

A tart jam, some brown sugar, and a wee bit of cream were all served on the side so I got to choose my own adventure bite by bite. Service was super friendly, and a sweet little busgirl scooted around and around and around the place like a super fast smurf cleaning up behind folks and smiling at anyone who made eye contact. They should make a breakfast quiche in her honor and call it QT Pie. \n\nExtra shout-out to SF yelpers who made the decision easy once I found Blue Bottle reviews on the iPhone. Great coffee. Great place. Y'all were right on!", "author": "emily r."}

Then I asked for a cookie.  I hesitatantly asked which one she recommended--the chocolate or the ginger.  Another eye roll--the barista explained that the chocolate one tastes like chocolate and the ginger one tastes like ginger.  Um Thanks, I can read.

He slowly boiled the coffee up to temperature and then allowed the drip to slowly happen. When he gave me the coffee he described it like a wine...\"Hints of blackberries...\" I was skeptical but, he was right and that coffee was mustard. My wife's latte was also top notch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-13", "description": "Blog Post - http://dabblewith.com/2013/05/15/top-shelf-cup-a-joe/\n\nSo I recently discovered Blue Bottle Coffee is not just your average cup of joe. Blue Bottle Coffee, is a native california micro-roaster that introduced Japanese-style siphon bar to San Francisco. They only carry three blends of coffee however each is hand roasted in their own roastery. James Freeman (founder) took the creation of coffee to a new level by controlling where the coffee is imported from as well as the equipment that is used to make the coffee. Freeman imported coffee and equipment from Japanese beverage giant UCC. UCC sold Freeman a $20,000 halogen-powered siphon machine that sits in the Mint Plaza caf\u00e9. Mr. Freeman is still tremendously involved with the brewing of the coffee and he meets with his staff each day in the company's production facility for their \"cupping\" ritual--a blind tasting of all the coffee roasted the previous day, as well as coffee made from beans they are considering buying.  Some things that set Blue Bottle Coffee apart is after roasting, coffee beans exhale carbon dioxide for several hours. Instead of keeping the Blue Bottle beans in bins, they are mixed in blends and bagged within four hours to harness carbon dioxide and keep oxygen (and oxidation) out of the bags. Blue Bottle never pre-blends their coffees, thus assuring the ideal roast profile for each bean.\n\nblue_bottle_kyoto_dripperYou may also wonder why is there a coffee siphon sitting on the counter from Japan? Well Mr. Freeman has been influenced by his many trips to Japan, which has a long tradition of hand-brewing coffee with scrupulous care. He makes pilgrimages to a cafe near Shibuya Station in Tokyo called Chatei Hatou, which brews individual cups of coffee for $15 apiece. Mr. Freeman describes them as \"life-changing perfection.\" He studied the Japanese manual coffee-making techniques and has switched to more Japanese equipment over the past five years. Moving more deeply into the culture, he has begun studying the Japanese language, toting his flashcards around and meeting with a tutor about twice a month.\n\nBlue Bottle Coffee's Timeline: \n\nIn 2001, James Freeman (burned out musician) Founded of Blue Bottle Coffee in a 186 square foot potting shed adjacent to Freeman's Oakland apartment.\nFreeman would roast coffee beans in his shed, then load the beans and a drip coffee contraption into his Peugeot station wagon and drive to farmers' markets in Berkeley, Oakland, and eventually the Ferry Plaza in San Francisco. Quickly expanded to semi permanent carts and kiosks.\nIn 2008,  Freeman took an investment ($5 Million) from Kohlberg Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based VC firm that has backed several high-end food companies (ex:  Scharffen Berger chocolate).\nBuilt a larger coffee roastery and commercial baking kitchen in Oakland. Caitlin Freeman headed the pastry program.\nOpened three cafes in San Francisco: Mint Plaza, Ferry Building and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. \nIn 2009, Freeman expanded to New York City. Opening a roastery and Cafe in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Used is traditional kiosk method and expanded High Line\nAnnual profits of Blue Bottle for 2011 were $15 to $20 million. With a growth rate of 70% annually. \nIn 2012, Blue Bottle Coffee Inc. got a new President and CEO Bryan Meehan who headed the group of investors to purchased the controlling stake in Blue Bottle Coffee for $19.6 million.\nExpanded to 10 locations between San Francisco and New York.\nNow, James Freeman is the President and CEO of Blue Bottle Coffee Inc. while Bryan Meehan is now Executive Chairman.\nHistory of Blue Bottle Coffee: \n\nIn 1683, The Turkish army arrived in Vienna after having swept across much of europe.  The Viennese choose Franz George Kolshitsky as their emissary.  He passed through Turkish lines to get a message to the nearby Polish troops. The Polish Troops brought Vienna to victory and the Turks fled the city leaving everything behind. One of the items left behind was, strange bags of beans that were thought at the time to be camel feed. Kolshitsky recognized them as bags of coffee because he spent time in the Arab world. He then opened the first Central European coffee house (The Blue Bottle) and served the 'Turks' coffee.\n\nBlue Bottle James RoastingWhen did it come to the Bay Area?\n\nMr. Freeman was a freelance musician who converted a potting shed into a coffee roastery. Using this six-pound batch roaster, he decided he would only sell  coffee less than 48 hours out of the roaster to his customers.

Their coffee and Iced coffee is the best I've had, both the new orleans and the kyoto iced coffees are amazing. Blue Bottle has the only Halogen Siphon system in the country and barristas that know how to use it.\n\nThe Mint plaza location is the only location that does Kyoto style iced coffee, it is also the only location that does single origin siphon pots so I suggest going here if it is your first time to Blue Bottle.\n\nEvery location does espresso right, and if you are used to espresso from Starbucks, Petes etc... it is a completely different animal. The espresso at blue bottle is extremely clean tasting with no bitterness or burnt taste, you can actually enjoy this espresso without any milk or sugar added.\n\nI also want to say you shouldn't hate on Blue Bottle because their lines are too long, there is nothing they can do about that and it takes time to do things right.

Then, a new chef took over.  Most of the menu has devolved within a month to just short of bad.  For instance, the thick-cut acme toast has been replaced with \"Firebrand thick-cut toast\", which is basically an inflated piece of Zwieback milk toast, rough and tasteless, with a useless stain of butter in a circle in the center of the one piece of bread.  The toast used to come with a pot of butter, so you could actually spread some to the crusts.  Oh, and you got two pieces before.  But that's okay, because no thanks on two pieces of that dry cardboard.  Who would have thought you could mess up TOAST?  If you get it with the poached eggs, they basically melt the bread into a sort of polenta-y mush.  It only gets \"better\" from there.  The other delicious poached egg dishes are all gone, replaced by a breakfast sandwich with a weird, spongy egg center and some \"fancy\" greens to make it hipster.  I ordered the steel cut oats this morning, and had to give it back to the kitchen because it was honestly truly awful.  It was soupy and literally slimy, completely tasteless no matter how much sugar and jam I threw at it.  It used to be a crunchy, textured oatmeal.  I can't even believe they are calling it \"steel cut oats\".  It is more like a blended slug.\n\nThe coffee is still great, still love the New Orleans iced coffee and the lattes are perfect.  But I would seriously avoid wasting your money on the hype if you need to eat as well.  I do notice the lines are really going down (wonder why), so if you just need a cup that's a bonus for you!

So I decided to see what all the fuss was about.

I suppose because street signage isn't obvious, I passed it by several times without realizing the deliciously tasty coffee treasures that lay within. I decided to try the New Orleans iced coffee - partially because of the great reviews and partially because I haven't tasted anything \"New Orleans-inspired\" that I haven't liked.\n\nMy iced coffee was served in a nameless white paper cup with no lid, no straw. With coffee cups becoming somewhat of a fashion statement nowadays (i.e. Starbucks), I was expecting a trendy, self-promoting logo or something of the sort. How unpresumptous of you, Blue Bottle. \n\nThey asked if I wanted my receipt, to which I said \"no\". I then realized how much paper the other coffee shops must waste by printing thousands of receipts that people throw away five seconds later. How smart of you to look out for the environment. I'm liking you more already :)\n\nMy iced coffee was a rich, mildly sweet piece of sunshine. It's stuff like this that makes me realize what coffee is supposed to taste like.

I'm going to focus on the beans and the brewed espresso I have had in the caf\u00e9.  \n\n-=[The Beans]=-\nI have tried various roasters in the city (ritual, graffeo, roastery, etc.) and have found none to be as consistently high quality as blue bottle. It is priced around 7 for a half pound depending on the blend, which is about the same as other high-end roasters.  Just finding out when most other beans were roasted can be an issue that is why I love that blue bottle prints it right on the bag and will not sell beans that are more than 48 hours old.  I enjoy the Hayes Valley roast most often.  \n\nI brew most of my coffee as espresso as I have a low-volume commercial plumbed-in machine in my kitchen (i'm nuts). It gives me control of the brewing temp within 1 degree, so on a long shot I emailed them to see what temp to brew their beans at.  This is what they said: \n\n\"Hi,\nWe usually set our machines to 200-203 depending on the day of roast and the weather.\nThe roman usually likes a lower temp but that is the only one that I would recommend at around 198-199.\"\n\nThey tune parameters of the espresso making process based on the weather. \n\n-=[Espresso]=-\nI have only had espresso in the caf\u00e9, but I can say that it was tasty and prepared with such care as to elevate it to an art.  I like that it is served with a glass of water. \n\nThe espresso itself had a thick dark reddish-brown crema, was prepared ristretto style (shorter/smaller/stronger shot) with a slight bit of speckling in the crema. \n\nIt is presented in thick walled Italian made Nuova Point cups which are used for great espresso all over the world.   Coincidentally if you like the cups, Caf\u00e9 Trieste in north beach sells them.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 was busy with a mix of business people on lunch break and tourists.  Everyone was friendly and the service was prompt.  \n\nMy only complaint is that one time I was trying to go to the caf\u00e9 I ran in to a rather confrontational crack head while trying to park. I can't blame blue bottle for that though.", "author": "Jeff F."}

Once you have that figured out, you should stop hassling them at your restroom door! \n\nThis place makes amazing coffees and the baristas are all fantastic.  I am giving it a 3 because of my restroom experience.  I met a friend here today for coffee. I came in, sat down, got a latte, used the restroom, typed a bunch of emails and realized they don't have free internet.  Since my friend wasn't due until 30 mins after, I went over to the Westfield mall, used their free internet and sent all my emails.\n\nI came back into the store literally 15 mins later and wanted to use the restroom again.  I wanted to wash my face before my friend showed up. The security guard stops me and says to me \"Are you sitting here.\" I reply  \"Yes, I am siting here. I was here a few min ago and now I am back again\". He says \"This restroom is only for paying customers\". I got really irritated by this comment of his.  He had allowed me to use the restroom barely 20 mins ago and had seen me buy my latte and sit down.\nI kept calm and told him that my friend was coming now and we were gonna sit down and get something again. He didn't seem to be convinced but handed me the key nevertheless.  On my way out, I told him I understood he was doing his job but he could have been nicer to me.\n\nAgreed this is San Francisco.  You have weirdos who can show up and bathe in your toilet sink.  But hey, look at me! I am your 20 something office-goer, neatly dressed, polished shoes, laptop, iPhone.

All I knew was that my friend serves Blue Bottle coffee in his restaurant.\n\nSo....\n\nOn the way to lunch today as we were transitioning from the land of teenage mallrats to crack hotels, we walked by the new mint plaza.  Someone mentioned the supposed $20,000 coffee machine in Blue Bottle Cafe (someone more informed than me will have to confirm this).  Curious about anything so outrageously expensive that does something so simple, we knew had to come back and check it out for keep-you-awake-at-the-office-after-a-good-lunch coffee.\n\nThe coffee makers here is a science delight!  I could sit in here all day and watch them make it.  If chemistry was this cool when I was school I might actually be practicing my degree still.  The coffee makers look like a combination of high tech and hand made lab equipment.  I have no idea how they work (yeah, I didn't get that good grades in chemistry but can admit it has something to do with heat and vacuums) but they are fun to watch.  In my defense, we weren't the only ones in there taking pictures (you'll have to ask Angie R why she walks around with a real camera - not camera phone - in her purse).\n\nI did not try the coffee myself but hubby reported good but super caffeinated.  I did try the chocolate pudding, served in a beaker of course(!) , and thought it was delish.\n\nDecor is also nice.  Different than most other coffeehouses in going for the opposite effect of small and cozy.  Instead, tall ceilings, lots of windows and light.  Pale wood.

While my husband was in the shower, I concocted a plan for the day, and we stumbled down the street in a hung over haze in search of breakfast at Blue Bottle's Mint Plaza shopfront. Little did we know that we were about to encounter a coffee dreamworld.\n\nA $20,000 syphon brewing system, where water heated by a halogen lamp rises up through the grounds to make a perfectly smooth cup of coffee.  An iced coffee system that redefines slow brewing: water passes through the grounds one drip at a time over the course of eight hours. Eight hours!  Perfect pour-over coffee and espresso drinks made with care - and a limited but delicious breakfast menu besides.\n\nAnd what a breakfast it was: a grilled ham and gruyere sandwich for me and a fabulous frittata with goat cheese, sweet corn, and red pepper puree for Shane. I coveted that frittata. I dream of that frittata. Fortunately he shared a few bites, and we shared two syphon pots of Amaro Gayo and Guatemalan Guya'b, enjoying the former much more than the latter. As we were sitting in the front window enjoying our breakfast, we spotted the owner of one of our favorite Ann Arbor coffee spots standing in line for his own breakfast. What are the chances?!\n\nSo great was our enjoyment of that greasy breakfast that we went back for more the next day, sharing the dreamy frittata and thick slabs of ACME toast, along with two beautiful cappuccinos - my husband's first!  His tastes in espresso drinks previously leaned in the vanilla latte direction, so this was a revelation, and the beginning of a beautiful obsession.\n\nIf you're in the Financial District and in need of breakfast, I can think of no reason to go elsewhere - unless you're easily deterred by lines or don't like good things.", "author": "Elizabeth E."}

They were not working and talking or anything like that.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and quick about both bringing us our orders and answering questions. The space has a fairly industrial feel and the acoustics aren't great, so it's certainly not a lounging type of coffee shop; however, it was still a comfortable place to have breakfast. \n\nThe poached eggs on toast were perfect, delicious, and attractive. (see photo) Even the butter that came on the side was sweet and tasty...not that I know anyone who would just eat butter straight! The fancy Siphon bar is only available from 10-5:30, so we were limited to the standard espresso bar fare. My mocha was tasty, but even more so it was beautiful: a thick layer of foam on top was finished with a fern design of cocoa powder. (Again, see photo) The coffee drinks are all made with organic whole milk (Clover-brand), which lends a slightly tangier-than-normal flavor that, while nice, took a bit of adjusting.\n\nPrices were reasonable and entirely in-line with other coffee shops. The mocha was $4.50, the eggs/toast was $6. I would absolutely go back.\n\nLOCATION WARNING: Finding this shop is a little tricky because it has no frontage on the main streets and no prominent signage sticking out from the exterior walls. Don't bother looking for \"Mint Street\" as it has no sign and isn't really a street, not even an alley; it's more of a parking lot.

I'm also a huge fan but the competition in the SF Bay Area is quite stiff and I like to think of Blue Bottle as being one (very important) component of the Third Wave Coffee movement along with other greats like Ritual, Barefoot, Four Barrel, Sightglass etc.\n\nFirst let me tackle the technical details:\n\n- Locally roasted, fresh coffee beans: \n Check. Blue Bottle is one of the most well known local SF Bay Area roasters.\n- Baristas with proper training on pulling espresso & steaming milk: \n Check \n- High quality Milk: \n Check. Clover Organic.\n- Latte Art:\n Check\n\nThe quality of drinks produced by Blue Bottle is very high. I'm very impressed by how they maintain a very consistant drink quality throughout their multiple locations and many different Baristas. They must have a very rigorous Barista training program.", "author": "Fouzi H."}

I also appreciated being treated with respect as a customer - not being \"upsold\" and most importantly receiving the finest cup of cappuccino I have ever had.

I'm sadly allergic to coffee (which I love the taste of), but I do sneak sips of my friends' mochas and New Orleans iced coffees, and Blue Bottle coffee is bangin'. I had a hot chocolate once, too, and it was bomb. I've also tried the gingerbread and biscotti, and seriously, also bomb. When I tried their ginger tea, I was a little overwhelmed with how strong it was, but if you like super intense spicy ginger - definitely try it. \n\nThe menu is very simple and authentic, so don't go there if you need to have your fancy fraps or overly sweet drinks. \n\nHowever, I would give the service 2 stars. Don't get me wrong - I frankly could do without the perky barista shit that you get at mainstream places and like to get in, get out, and be done with a few pleasantries here and there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-15", "description": "This is a Blue Bottle Coffee shop located in Mint Plaza between 5th and 6th St. I've sampled a good portion of their coffee menu: latte, cappuccino, drip coffee, New Orleans style iced coffee, Kyoto style iced coffee, siphon bar coffee, and affogato. My favorites are their single origin drip coffee and siphon bar coffee. Although Blue Bottle makes excellent espresso-based drinks, they're not the best I've ever had when compared to Sightglass Coffee or Four Barrel Coffee. However, I have to say the drip coffee here is extremely strong and full-bodied. You can instantly taste the superior quality beans used and afterwards I am noticeably energized from the caffeine jolt. One of these days I will finally buy some of their coffee beans for my French Press at home. I've tried both of their iced coffees (New Orleans and Kyoto), but I'm torn between which one I like better. To be honest, I probably just alternate randomly between the two depending on my mood. Either way, both are perfect for those occasional sunny 70+ degree days here in SF. Unless you're already in the general area or it's your first time here, I suggest trying the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee from Philz Coffee as a point of reference. There's also the halogen-powered siphon bar coffee! The machine apparently cost more than $20,000 to import from Japan. Sure at the end of the day, the concept is nothing new: siphon coffee, the difference being in how it's heated. But hey there's a reason the World Siphonist Championship originated from Japan right? The secret is in the stirring...watch the baristas use bamboo paddles to create the captivating whirlpool! Trust me, this unique brewing method really does produce a unique cup of coffee so try it at least once. I would describe it as a lighter, sweeter, more aromatic form of your normal brewed coffee, but with very complex flavors due to the level of extraction. Be careful since it's extremely hot! Each cup has different characteristics due to the different origins so just ask the baristas for advice. Also, each siphon coffee order is enough for at least two cups of coffee in case you wanted to share. Finally, there's the affogato: Humphry Slocombe ice cream with a shot of espresso. Wow this must be heaven! Just be aware there is no Wi-Fi here and seating is pretty limited (maybe 20-25 max?). All in all, there is always a line here, but seeing how legendary Blue Bottle is here in the Bay Area, any Blue Bottle location is a must visit!", "author": "Andy C."}

Alas, I had the chance to sip a cup of their latte and it surely did not disappoint!  Rich in flavor and oh so soothing to the soul!  Loved every sip of it! \n\nI LOVED the clean modern/industrial decor with the bar communal type tables.  The crowd is a mixed bag, but primarily the artsy types.\n\nNot much personality on the staff part....kind of snobby barista/cashier person, but the coffee made up for it.  I opt for Intelligentsia baristas...much friendlier staff....sorry, Blue Bottle!!  \n\nThe location of this coffee shop is hidden in a little alleyway, towered by tall loft/office buildings and restaurants.  Parking was a beast with nothing but street parking, but how can you get away from that when you're in SF?  There was a parking lot charging $9, but drive around and you'll find parking!  Stand clear of the homeless lingering around at the end of the block.  I was afraid that they were going to come after me after I refused to give them change.  Be careful!  Aside from that mayhem, once you step into Blue Bottle, you escape to a different world!  \n\nDEFINITELY coming back during my next visit to Blue Bottle.  DELICIOUS lattes and great vibe!!!", "author": "Emily A."}

Suffice it to say we go out of our way numerous times to get it.\n\nThat this is our favorite stop to pick up lattes in the mornings/midday - as it's SO much easier to find parking - they have that 15 minute spot that usually available, and a few available spots around the area.. Also, the service is always consistent.\n\nMy only complaint: Blue Bottle stopped serving those AMAZING Bayon Gruyere Brioches.. We did, however, find out where they came from - Firebrand Artisan Breads in Oakland. I guess that gives us an excuse to explore Oakland at some point....", "author": "Asha S."}

I know Blue Bottle Coffee is served at the top floor of the MOMA but I really wanted to see the actual place so I walked the two blocks over to Mint Plaza. \n\nThe line was out the door but the people didn't resemble the hostile \"I need my coffee or I'm going to choke someone!\" crowd that are usually found at coffee establishments. Here, it seemed that people actually relaxed with their drinks. They were there for conversations, the nice late afternoon break with friends, and just to slow down a bit. I ordered a mocha and three cookies: Recchiuti Double Chocolate, Lavender Pinenut Shortbread and a Snickerdoodle. Yup, I love my sweets! \n\nNow I can't remember the last time I drank a mocha from an actual cup. It was always in a to-go tumbler or paper cup. I guess I needed to slow down too and I'm so glad I did here. The cookies were extraordinary. They were soft and crunchy in all the right places and the different flavors were unique and satisfying. \n\nOf course, Blue Bottle delivered on their coffee. I'm not a strong coffee drinker and even a little embarrassed to admit I usually opt for those syrupy coffee concoctions. The Blue Bottle mocha is made with Recchiuti chocolate but is far from sweet. But it's so flavorful that I didn't miss the sugar at all. Even the aroma was like drinking in the actual work of art. Five perfect stars for the end of a perfect day.", "author": "Julia T."}

Remember that \"Blue Bottle coffee\" isn't a single blend - they do have a moderately sized selection of beans, so that what you drink at one Blue Bottle may not be the same type at another!\n\nThe Venue: A pretty small, but chic cafe quite literally in an alley just off of Market. The quickest way by foot is through \"Mint Plaza\" (zoom in on the Yelp-provided map), and I suppose if you wanted to, you could drive right through on Jessie St. but a security guard will most likely tell you not to park there and move along. The cafe itself is adorned with coffee siphons (I suggest YouTubing a video on how these work), Blue Bottle swag, an island table with chairs, and some window seating. Certainly not a study cafe, and probably not a good coffee-date spot, either (the entire cafe will hear your conversation). I think it's a great place to take your break and enjoy a delightful cup of coffee. Their expresso-based drinks are also very good and as you can see from the photos, aesthetically pleasing, too.\n\nOverall: I am a fan of Blue Bottle, adorned alleys, and a nice place to just take a break. Drop in on your 15-minute break, bring the paper, converse with a random stranger, and enjoy the product of a company that has a genuine passion for what they do. More seating would be nice, but they do well with what they've got.", "author": "Gun-Ik P."}

You can't go wrong with a simple latte at Blue Bottle, but if you want something unique then go ahead and try the secret Gibraltar that is not on the menu.

The line is usually manageable but, as of late, has become out of control. I've since boycotted blue bottle until today.\n\nI walked 2 blocks out of my way to pick up a 1/2 lb. and, while I was there, a decaf (it was 3PM) americano since decaf drip is not available at this location. I watched no less than 10 people, who placed their orders after me, get their drinks before me. \n\nI waited over 10 minutes before I finally said something to the guy at the counter. He was very nice and explained that this particular barrista has his own style of pouring drinks. It just so happens that my drink, and me, got the shit end of the stick. \n\nI asked very politely to just give me my money back as I really had to go and, frankly, waiting over 10 minutes for an americano, no matter how good it is, is just ridiculous. He offered me a free cookie instead. I thanked him but told him I wasn't hungry and I really just wanted my coffee, or my money back so I could get back to work. Seriously. Instead he offered me a regular drip coffee which he would make for me personally but warned me it had caffeine in it. Thanks.\n\nFive more minutes go by and I'm seriously considering just leaving and not getting my coffee, or my money back. At long last, the barrista produces my americano and apologizes for the delay. I take the coffee and bolt out the door, half running back to work. Somehow, the coffee doesn't taste as good as it would to have those 15 minutes back in my life.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n1. If you're going to take 15 minutes to make my drink just tell me and I won't order one. This is how you keep customers.\n\n2. Put up a sign that says, \"good coffee takes time\", or some other hogwash. At least set the expectation.\n\n3. If someone nicely asks for their money back because you can't produce coffee in a reasonable amount of time, give it to them, not a cookie, and hope that one day they'll come back again.\n\nI'm done with blue bottle. The coffee is good but seriously I've had better. Anything off the shelf in Central America blows this crap away. Any freshly roasted coffee just about anywhere, really, tastes as good. \n\nThe business model will work fine in SF and probably New York where people trip all over themselves to wait in line for whatever is hyped-up at the time but like all fads in big cities this too will fade. \n\nFair well blue bottle, you have one less customer as of today.", "author": "Bryan M."}

But when it comes to my every day coffee, I like it simple (okay, maybe with some half&half)--and it doesn't get any simpler than Blue Bottle drip coffee.\n\nLove at first taste.  You don't have to be afraid anymore--you can drink it black.  Without cream.  Without sugar.  And still without the acidic aftertaste or that bitterness that makes the corners of your mouth turn up ever so slightly.\n\nThere's no turning back now.", "author": "Brianna H."}

Happy to announce I had the best bowl of oatmeal ever.  \n\nI am somewhat of an oatmeal junkie, Quaker Oats old-fashioned is my go-to choice at home but I try to sample the wares on the road.  Blue Bottle served a perfectly formed (firm) bowl of steel-cut oatmeal, alongside a small dish of coarse-grained brown sugar and another of creamy butter.  The sides were rich and colorful and blended in perfectly.  \n\nI didn't fully appreciate, until now, how much upside there could be in the perfect bowl of oatmeal.

I don't even notice the wreckage of litter and leering construction workers because I'm almost too excited for my cup of coffee. Usually, any sweetener or creamer or flavor shot you add overpowers the flavor of the coffee itself. But not this stuff. For the first time, I can drink my coffee with creamer and STILL taste the coffee. I must have been drinking some really cheap shit before. I think all that Starbucks I poisoned my taste buds with led me to believe your coffee had to taste like sugary milk. But no, not this time. I've grown up, I've graduated! I have seen the light and it is at the bottom of a blue bottle! When I first walked in, I was like what kind of frou frou ass coffee shop is this?? All hidden in the cut with no signage. Looking like a mad scientists lab with beakers and strange coffee machines everywhere. With its lofty high ceilings and employees who look like models for urban outfitters.

Last week my friend and I went to blue bottle cafe and suffered through a 30 minute line to place the order for the famed New orleans ice coffee and sg-20.  We would have ordered breakfast except I had ran out cash.  This is a cash only establishment!\n\nWe were both very disappointed with our coffee.  We both have ordered similar drinks at different blue bottle location and had been turned on to blue bottle because of those experiences.   We were in dismay at our cup of coffee.  We couldn't understand the long line and the glowing reviews for this location.  \n\nThe New Orlean ice coffee tasted  like a diluted Vietnamese drip coffee. The sg-20, the fraternal brother to the gilbraltar, was very different.   This was someone else's step brother. The gibraltar (Oakland location)  tasted rich, smooth and balanced....Mint plaza drink was watery.  It tasted like flat non-fat milk in coffee.  What's irritating, when told the drink did not taste right, the barista said the espresso at each blue store is different and will change the flavor of the drink.  I haven't even commented on the flavor yet....just the texture of the drink.  He didn't offer to make another drink. \n\nI wasn't going to bother writing this review initially written eight months ago...  At that time I was going to chalk this experience as my learning curve until i randomly had a conversation with a coffee connoisseur who happened to over hear my discussion about mint plaza blue bottle.  He said he never received a good drink at the mint plaza location.  He recommend going to Sightglass because there is less people and more consistently good drinks if I couldn't get to the Hayes blue bottle location. I am finally posting this review because I still remember how terrible that cup of coffee was and HOW LONG the anticipated wait for this cup, only to discover I needed another cup!!!!  \n\nTime is valuable. There is nothing wrong waiting for what you want. This place doesn't promise a satiating cup of coffee. I haven't been back and no need to redeem this place.", "author": "Quynh P."}

It was a Friday morning around 11am and there were about 2 or 3 people ahead of us in line.... 15 minutes later we make it to the counter. How slow could they possibly be. There were 4 people behind the counter. I place my order and the woman wanders off... I am left standing there like a moron, holding my money in my hand waiting to  pay. There are 2 other staff stood there by the checkout not doing anything, see me holding the cash, and help the next customer. \n\nThe girl comes back, takes my cash, then goes off to make my drip coffee. She bring the cup over  plops it down on the counter. So there I am staring at my cup off coffee. Remember, this is my first time there. I scan around the room looking for a station that has milk,cream etc. I don't see anything. I see 2 cartons of milk to the right of me on the counter, which the barrista appears to be using to make her drinks. I'm thinking, well maybe they are there for us to use too, however there is now a customer between me and my milk. I reach around (not in that way, pervert) and  grab the milk, add it to my coffee, and head out. Right now I feel like the crazy guy who stole the barrista's milk. As im leaving, I notice a tiny little place hidden right behind the door, behind the long line of people waiting that had developed. \n\nSo, long story short, Blue Bottle, you get 1 star because your staff were slow, unorganized, unfriendly, unmotivated, and unhelpful. Maybe that's how you achieve a cult following, but not how you receive my repeat business. \n\nOh... and the coffee wasn't that great either.", "author": "Mathew J."}

Unfortunately, I am not a fan of Blue Bottle Coffee and this is a shame, because it's fun to roll out of bed on a weekend morning and stand in line at their \"garage door\" location in Hayes Valley with other sleepy San Franciscans for your first hit of the day.\n\nI'm not sure if it's a matter of personal preference or if \"the emperor has no clothes\" I  I suspect that the coffee is either over-extracted or is flash roasted/ some other shorter roasting process and a licorice/chicory combination is added to disguise this fact. Not only was the licorice/chicory taste jarring to my taste buds in this combination, I got a seriously bad buzz from this coffee at all locations. I suspect that they cut corners in the roasting process despite the universal enthusiasm for their coffee in San Francisco. \n\nAt the risk of sounding like a coffee \"addict\" a longer slower roast tends to give a nice steady buzz (the longer coffee is roasted, the lower the caffeine content so the darker and bolder the roast the less caffeine, indeed counter-intuitive) while a lighter or faster roasting process tends to give me that horrible jittery feeling as does coffee that is over-extracted. I feel strung out post-blue bottle coffee. While they have beautiful and creative store designs, there is too much good (and locally roasted) coffee in San Francisco to drink here.

I've seen all types of latte art from rosettas to hearts to weird squigglies, and Chris is the type of dude able to replicate all kinds of crazy shit. And on occasion, he'll whip me up an extra crispy, vanilla waffle. \n\nI owe Christopher this review for quite some time now... and this shitty review is a shout out to everyone at the Mint location.

Ritual is overrated, Epicenter is a close second and rising, and 4 Barrel is always disappointing, but BB is the most consistently great cup of coffee I've had anywhere. If you're a coffee connoisseur, or want to be, or just appreciate it now and again, you're doing yourself a disservice for not checking the place out. Go right now... I'll wait.\n\nThat said BB has it's downsides. The spaces are all limited, even Mint Plaza, are small and limited. Makes it tough to enjoy your coffee when 40 people are jammed around one table and some wall space. It's difficult to even feel comfortable to take along a book or a paper, and downright ludicrous to think of taking a laptop and getting any work done. Food selections are equally limited. Combined this makes Blue Bottle what I'd assume the owners wanted, a place to get coffee, maybe drink it, and leave, but leave me wanting. It's for these reasons that Blue Bottle is a rarity for me, but a nice one.\n\nYou can't go wrong with a regular capp or gibraltar, but if you've got the time and the desire go for the siphon at the Mint plaza location. Always good, sometimes amazing, once in awhile transcendent, this has been, on occasion, the best cup of brewed coffee I've ever had.", "author": "Scott R."}

You were funky, honing your craft inside an old converted garage. You liked to go to farmers markets and all the cool little cafes. Sometimes, when I felt like it, I would invite you over to my house and you were kind to my little coffee pot. Your friends were witty, wore funky t-shirts and listened to cool music. \n\nI know that your community is a large one, but ever since you got that new job across from the SF Chronicle, I am not sure who you are. How come all your friends always wear the same black shirts every day? I mean I like black and all, and perhaps wear too much of it, but now I have a hard time telling your friends apart. Frankly they don't seem as happy as your pals at the markets or at the garage. \n\nAnd all those strangers coming in to have business meetings. Who are they? OK I get it; they all read the New York Times in which you were featured. Why must they all pose uncomfortably at those awkwardly tall tables? San Francisco is not New York and shouldn't try to be. And don't have your new friends attack me. This is a testament to how great it is in the bay. New York can't compete with its charms, its sunny nature. Leave the cold to the east coast.  Even my pal Grumpy* doesn't put on airs like this.  \n\nBlue, what happened? I like your new toy but maybe your architect should have built a more well suited space for it. Or maybe you need to meet some artists who could add some character to the place. I feel like I am going to the doctor's office and he is too busy adjusting his lab coat to make my appointment. \n\nI visited you yesterday on my break from work, but I think you didn't spot me there. A gaggle of high heeled ladies were blocking your view. I had to rush in and rush out. I didn't feel comfortable. I'll see you at the farmers market on Sunday. You seem more like yourself there. \n\nNo hard feelings. As I write this I am sipping a cup of your coffee, remembering the good old days when things were just lovely, simple and sweet. \n\nFaithfully Yours, \n\nOle* Coffee Eyes\n\n*http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=HNV4GQwjPZRkbSxtwicQ_g&q=blue+bottle\n\n*http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-grumpy-new-york\n\n*lazy way of saying old, not a reference to bullfighting.", "author": "Tina E."}

I figured, why the hell not, we could eat here, try out this amazing coffee, and take a half pound of espresso beans to go.  I decided to go for the \"waffle set\" -- a waffle and a pot of siphoned coffee.  Of course, I had to try the coffee.\n\nThe pop eye toast came first, two crunchy slices of brioche, each with a perfect circle cut through them, the hole replaced with a fried egg, served on a small square plate.  The presentation was fantastic.  But the actual dining experience wasn't; the plate was small, the toast was hard to cut through, and since it was carrying an egg in the middle, it wasn't exactly finger food.\n\nIn a way that pop eye toast represents what Blue Bottle Cafe felt like.  A little cramped, presented with flair, but not at all comfortable with being taken too seriously.\n\nOf course the star of the show was the siphoned coffee.  As you watch it brewing, a miracle of physics as water in the pot bubbles, stirs, and ascends into the beaker filled with ground beans above it. The barista casually stirs the beans, churning a thick, earthy foam, and removes it from the heat, allowing the coffee to swirl back into the pot.  Inside, a hot, perfectly translucent brew.  And it tastes just like...black coffee.\n\nI do have an espresso machine at home, have tried a variety of beans between Peet's Coffee and Whole Foods and occasionally pick up a canister of Illy's.  I also had a latte at Vivace Roasteria in Seattle, which I thought was amazing.  I also had the New Orleans iced coffee at the Blue Bottle Kiosk in Hayes Valley, which I also enjoyed.  I think I'm just starting to grasp the ins'n outs of coffee.  And but the coffee at the cafe just didn't cut it.\n\nA lot of people looked like they were here just because it was the \"cool\" place to be.  Some of them even taking pictures it was so cool, like part of some live exhibit.  But the whole thing was just a little silly.  The food was pretty plain.  Didn't come with any preserves, no breakfast sausages, not even a garnish.  And the beans I brought home, a half pound of Retrofit Espresso, was alright, but I was less than amazed.\n\nIf you come to Blue Bottle Cafe, come here to watch the siphon show, but skip the brunch.  And if you're seriously looking for a cozy coffee shop to relax in, you may be better off looking elsewhere.", "author": "Tony L."}

I've also tried some of their food, which has always been on a sunday, so I don't know if they serve it the rest of the week, but the tomato soup souffle thingie and the the toast with jam is really good!

My friend loves this place.  She had been raving about Blue Bottle since June, and I couldn't wait to try it.  I finally did, on the last day of 2008.\n\nIt's a good thing we showed up around 10 am; we walked in and the cashier took our order right away.  15 minutes later, the place was literally overflowing with people waiting to pay good money for coffee made from the \"finest organic, pesticide-free, shade-grown beans.\" I ordered a prosciutto and poached egg on toast and a cup of regular coffee.  My friend had french toast and a Cafe Au Lait.  Total bill for the two of us - $21.54.  Not bad at all.\n\nWe noticed two seats at the counter and sat down. These were actually the best seats in the house, because your only seating choices included a long, wide table in the middle, a long narrow counter along the wall or the counter by the cashier.  Our counter was separated from the \"kitchen\" by a thick pane of glass, which allowed us to enjoy the view.  \n\nThe view was very unique: it's hard to describe it, but if I had to, I'd say it was a cross between Jesse Duke's barn where he made his famous moonshine and a good, old-fashioned meth lab.  Water boiling in beakers on tiny burners, copper wires, siphoning . . .  We were sitting there wondering what the hell was going on. \n\nThen the coffee and the food came.  My coffee was extremely strong with a bold, unmistakable aroma.  If I hadn't had six cup of coffee the day before, I would have still been bouncing off the walls.  My breakfast was OK, but not spectacular.  The prosciutto seemed a little overcooked, although the poached egg was perfect.  It was an interesting take on Eggs Benedict: prosciutto and poached egg served on thick white toast.\n\nI admit it, the coffee was 5 stars, the food was about 3.5, but the ambiance . . . maybe 2.  Overall, an \"A-OK\" experience.\n\nWhat happened to the whole idea of coffee houses where you can sit down and relax?  If I wanted to sit on a bar stool and pretend not to notice people hovering over my seat hoping I'd leave, I'll go to some place inside the Oakland Airport.  If this place wants to be hip, they need to add some comfortable seating.  If not, just get rid of the seating area and serve your coffee to go.  Oh, and what's with the \"one-size-fits-all\" idea?  It's America, we need choices.  How about a big gulp size 44-oz coffee cup or a kids' size 6-oz coffee cup?\n\nIf I do come back here, I am skipping the food and taking my coffee to go!", "author": "Yan G."}

As for the drip, as usual, it's delicious (for the same grounds and drip, check out Velo Rouge around USF).  As for the fancy, whatchamacallit machine coffee: it's expensive.  At 11 bucks for a bowl (yes, it comes in an odd bowl with a handle) it may be a bit over priced -- but perhaps we're paying for the cost of the machine.  The taste of the fancy stuff is one word: weird.  It's like coffee but missing an acid tone.  While I thought it was endlessly drinkable, I'd prefer to just stick to the plain drip: and if you drink it here, it's delicious.  I imagine this fancy stuff would go over well with somebody just becoming acquainted to coffee.\n\nThe service was great.  The waitress/busser/whatever was amazingly friendly, full of tips, and like a hawk to clean up cups and dishes.  \n\nThe inside of this place is kind of dull -- I could tell they were trying to move from the traditional coffee shop \"three person table\" to the more space effective bar set up -- and it's alright, but this type of organization often leads to people milling about when it gets crowded.  This is precisely what happened when 6 O'Clock rolled around and 90% of the financial district streamed in for a taste of the Blue Bottle.\n\nIf you can, go in an off peak hour, and try the fancy stuff if you're usually a bit of a coffee wuss.  \n\nAlso: did not see any wireless -- but that might be because I was checking with my iPhone.", "author": "jack p."}

There was no line, I thought to myself, this is going to be easy-peasy.\n\nSo I walk in and order a decaf coffee. The tall-skinny fembot behind the counter mutters, NO DECAF. Wha?? Okay, maybe I'm asking for too much so I ask if they have herb tea. Fembot says NO. Green tea is my only choice. So I think about it for a minute, knowing I'm not really supposed to have caffeine (I'm extremely sensitive) but not wanting to walk out empty handed I agree to the green tea.\n\nFast forward 10 minutes. I'm still waiting for my tea. People who ordered a lot later than me are getting their fancy barista espresso drinks. I try to make eye contact with Fembot. She won't look in my direction. I feel like yelling. I contain myself. I walk up to the counter and look for my tea. I can't see it. Did she forget? No, I thought I saw her pouring the hot water and dropping the tea bag inside. But where is it? I start pacing nervously. I come back to the counter and lean on it. No one makes eye contact with me. I start fidgeting. FINALLY, a different barista hands me my green tea with a smile. I grab it and leave wondering what I did to deserve such horrible treatment.\n\nI realize that I may have gotten this treatment because I didn't dump money into the tip jar at the time I placed my order. But STUPID FEMBOTS need to realize that people tip AFTER service NOT BEFORE. So if you didn't get a tip it's because no one should have to wait 12+ minutes for a stinking glass of green tea. You could have just given me the hot water and tea bag and I could have accomplished the task in 2 seconds. Easy-peasy.", "author": "L. L."}

All I can say is 'Wow!' because that coffee was caffeinated to the nth degree.  It was a little too strong for me, but it did wake me up and keep me going for most of the day.  The coffee, though strong, was not bitter and did not leave that nasty coffee after-taste- instead, there was a very distinct after-taste of dark, unsweetened chocolate.\n\nIt was a little intimidating ordering coffee here just because the whole operation looks like a mad scientist's lab and everyone seems really serious about their coffee.  Someone is stirring a pot of dark brew in the corner (I think I heard that it was chicory), while there's a chemistry set of boiling water in another corner.  There are some nifty-looking individual glass containers of coffee that people are drinking from that I want to order if only I could figure out what they are.\n\nIn any case, this Blue Bottle Cafe offers Sunday brunch, so you could order items like Croque Madame, Acme toast with butter and jam, white bean cassoulet, and Belgian waffle with fruit compote.  Because of this, the line is pretty long on Sundays as everyone is trying to find a place to sit, dine, chat, enjoy their coffee and read the paper.   \n\nI'd be back to try more of their other drinks, like the Cafe Mocha and the hot chocolate made from Recchiuti chocolate.  Be aware that they only offer organic half and half and sugar- you'll have to bring your own if you use artificial sweeteners.  The only other thing that I would add to their menu is some pastries because I was dying for a scone to go with the coffee.", "author": "Angela H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-18", "description": "For those of you who \"just want a cup of coffee\", you can go to any place that serves coffee since you probably won't be able to tell what good coffee is. This is not to poke fun, but some real advice. Blue Bottle charges more than average for \"just a cup\", why pay more if you can't tell the difference?\n\nThe siphon bar coffee is very good, however sometimes it is hit or miss. The coffee tends to come out with a slightly greater than average burnt note, but it isn't unpleasant. I have had some of the best tasting coffee from the bar, and I have also had some pretty good, but expensive coffee. I would say it is a mix between drip or pour over clean-ness, with a little more body and depth of flavor.\n\nTheir espresso drinks are consistently great. Their espresso and milk have been consistently excellent, and that is all I care about in this review. If a cafe has done its espresso and milk correctly, that cafe is better than 99.9% of all cafes out there.\n\nI believe there are only four places in San Francisco that do so: Blue Bottle, Four Barrel, Ritual, and Haus, and three of those are in the Mission. Keep in mind, that they do not serve espresso or macchaitos to go, as well they shouldn't.\n\nTheir breakfast is very good, but also very expensive. If you are at all conscious about staying on a budget, you should not eat the food here. I usually get the toast with jam and butter ($4), which comes with two huge pieces of fresh toast, fresh jam and whipped butter. It is the best toast I have ever had, and I certainly paid for it. Breakfast and the siphon bar start at 8am.\n\nSome people have complained about the speed of service. You must be used to the vacuum thermoses at Starbucks and Peets and every other cafe, not ground-to-order and dripped/siphoned-to-order coffee. If you got espresso, you would have noticed that they ground, leveled, and tamped their portafilters pretty quickly. They are clearly highly skilled and experienced baristas. The reason Starbucks can churn out the espresso is because their employees press a button and out comes the espresso. I think some Peets use Swift grinders, which tamp for them. I have no problem with the service, it's friendly and very fast for what you get.\n\nI don't visit for the atmosphere or location, I visit because it's the only place downtown that does coffee right.", "author": "Kelly M."}

For me, good coffee at a coffee shop gets 5 stars, so I'll use this review to tell a funny story.\n\nMe and my friend were sitting at Blue Bottle fantasizing about stealing their coffee beans.  At first, we were joking about puncturing the bags on the wall cartoon style, and storing the falling beans in our pockets.\n\nThen, one of the employees walks by with 4 five-pound bags of espresso roast.  He drops one of the bags, but it doesn't sound like it breaks.  I say to my friend, \"Man, I wish that bag had broken, I'd bust out my bean vacuum and suck those beans up!\"\n\nWe're leaving, and as we walk out, I realize the bag *has* broken, there are beans spilling out., the hole in the bag is face down, so it's hard to tell what the damage is.  I look at the employee and say, \"Can I have this bag?\" He says, \"You want it!?\" \n\nI pick up the bag carefully, and probably 4/5 of the beans are still in the bag, and never touched the ground.  He says, \"All right, take it, get out of here\"  (in a fun way:)  \n\n4 lbs. of Blue Bottle Espresso roast for free!", "author": "Stephen L."}

I know many of you will disagree with me, and I'm starting to question whether my opinion is due to lack of palate maturity to distinguish high quality coffees or a personal bias resulting from frequenting Starbucks nearly every day for the past 6 years.\n\nAnyway, I had read many good reviews about Blue Bottle and people have told me how great their coffee is.  We came downtown on Saturday to try Sultan Indian Buffet and watch the Final Four games.  We had some time between lunch and the basketball games, so we decided to check out Blue Bottle caf.  I was impressed with the location, a trendy little joint on Mint Street just south of Market.  The caf was very clean and well lit; a nice spot to converse with some buddies over some coffee, getting ready to get your day started.  \n\nThe one negative is that I didn't feel the price was justified by the coffee.   I paid 9 dollars for a drip, an espresso, and a caf au lait.  I'm not cheap, however if I pay premium price, I expect a premium experience.  The ambiance, crowd, and feel are all there, however the taste lacks.  The coffee didn't stand out to me and was disappointing.  I had my drip black so I could really taste the coffee, but there was nothing outstanding about it.  Tasted like a plain cup of coffee I could have bought anywhere else.  I'll probably go to Blue Bottle again; most likely the next time I'm downtown just trying to kill time... However I'll continue to favor Starbucks for my morning routine.", "author": "Timothy C."}

They opened one week and the next week were featured in a New York Times article, nuff said.\n\nI've got a major coffee habit and after seeing the reverence that scads of Yelpers drop the Blue Bottle name with in reviews for the Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market I was borderline ecstatic to hear they were opening their first cafe around the corner from my apartment.\n\nThey're tucked away around a corner in Mint Plaza and one of the best features of this hard-to-see location is that the clientele have a decidedly more City feel then most of the tourist traps that populate the surrounding vicinity. It seems to be a roughly equal mix of yuppies and hipsters, but good vibes all around.\n\nSo far I've had the opportunity to sample the following offerings::\n\nSiphon Coffee: This is the main event. The magic machine imported from Japan, and AFAIK, the only one of its kind here in the States. The coffee it brews is rich, sublime, and obscenely priced. Bring at least one other friend to share the experience (and more importantly the bill) since depending on your bean selection a small pot costs $10-$13.\n\nEspresso: Rich flavor, dark thick crema, yummy.\n\nCappuccino: Dense foam and steamed milk expertly layered (sweet designs!) on top of aforementioned espresso. Ridiculously smooth.\n\nKyoto Iced Coffee: Brewed extremely slowly overnight in the tall lab equipment next to the siphon machine. Has a strong whiskey taste, which was explained (by the barista) as a by-product of the extremely long extraction times. I'm not a whiskey fan, so not for me.\n\nVarious Food: They do not serve your typical coffee-shop fare here i.e. a shelf of pastries. Rather the small kitchen produces a small menu more inline with the \"New American\" style restaurants you'll find in The City. They use really high quality ingredients and the portions are sized to satisfy without stuffing you.", "author": "Joseph R."}

I had coffee here, oh, about 4 different times in the last several months.  It's true, the coffee is delicious, but the staff can be hit and miss.

Then, my friend was also served with hot chocolate as cold as mine.  No matter what price you charge or how busy it is, quality control should be in place.  \n\nWhen I brought my hot chocolate back after two sips, the employee who made the hot chocolate threw it out grunting how he had to make it all over again.  His tone, volume, agitated behaviour said it loud and clear - retribution for complaining.  The worst part of it was that the replaced hot chocolates, both of them, were even colder.\n\nNext time I'm in that neighborhood, I may or may not go back.  You know how it is.

It's a local company of \"artisanal microroasters\" of organic coffee and espresso from countries like Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Mexico.  \n\nFast forward to the morning after my arrival in San Francisco.  I was standing in the kitchen of my friends' apartment waiting for the coffee to perk, relishing the wonderful aromas wafting through the air.  The wheels in my brain started to turn and I was prompted to ask if my friend had heard of Blue Bottle, but I interrupted myself to exclaim, \"This coffee is freaking delicious!\"\n\n\"Honey, that's Blue Bottle,\" she hollered from the other room.  Needless to say, I am now a huge fan.  I've had a few delicious cups of their coffee since arriving, but today I visited the caf\u00e9 on Mint Street and enjoyed the best cappuccino I have had since living in France.\n\nA few side notes:\n1 Restaurateur extraordinaire, Danny Meyer, apparently fell in love with Blue Bottle on a recent trip to San Francisco and will now serve the coffee exclusively at Gramercy Tavern in New York City. \n2 I recently discovered the beauty of replacing organic cow's milk for soymilk in my coffee, which imparts a sweet, nutty taste and froths as well or better than \"real\" milk.", "author": "T.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-07-12", "description": "I researched a few coffee places to visit each morning I was in town to see my brother.  I read some reviews on Yelp for each, and I was led to Blue Bottle because the organization brews each cup individually, which I always can appreciate.\n\nI visited the Mint Street location.  The environment is nice; not the preferred shabby chic so many coffee houses prefer (see Philz review), but more downtown loft with high ceilings, plenty of tall windows, communal tables.\n\nThe coffee was good, not great.  A couple of points which make a difference for me and my experience.\n- The business does not offer any sugar alternatives.  No Splenda, no Equal, no nothing.  Not everyone wants sugar.  Talk about lack of coffee diversity.  I might have seen sugar syrup; I wasn't sure because nothing was labeled, which leads me into complaint number 2\n- Nothing was labeled.  They only had one milk bottle.  Well, which is it?  Milk?  Cream?  Half and half?  Soy?  Fat free?  Not really sure.  Why can't they have more alternatives, and label all of them.  Do they believe everyone partakes in the same beverage to mix in their coffee?\n- Should I really wait 8 minutes for drip coffee?  I appreciate that it can take time, but that's slightly ridiculous for a cup of decent, but not superior, quality.  On a positive, the barista was friendly and she apologized for the wait.\n- Why only one size?  Is there a rational reason for it?  If so, I'd like to know.\n- Only one blend?  I assume that was the case because the barista didn't even ask me for a choice of bean.  Very disappointing because at least the other two I visited this weekend (Ritual and Philz) offered numerous coffee bean choices.\n- Finally, like the other three, it was overpriced at $2.53 though I'm sure they're trying to pay rent in such a nice building.\n\nI wouldn't come back here unless I was in the neighborhood and craving a cup of coffee  (and yet my cravings would need to withstand the painstakingly slow process of receiving said cup of coffee).", "author": "Brendan Jude L."}

All my life, I've never had a cup of coffee that's too strong in a cafe except for Blue Bottle.

However, they don't sell beans ground (yes, whole beans is fresher, but I am willing to make that trade off in the morning as I don't want to grind coffee at 7 AM).

I tried the New Orleans style iced coffee. For once, I didn't even need to add sugar! The coffee was smooth, flavorful, and not too bitter, just the way I like it. There were no lines and the cafe, which is tastefully furnished, was not too busy. I can see why this place is popular! I'll definitely be back to try some of their other drinks. The only downside is that at $3.83, I'm not sure if I'll be frequenting this place very much. While I concur that their coffee is good, it might not be worth the extra cash I'm shelling out.

After all, I have been a coffee-anista since my early teens. I know good coffee. I have had coffee in Italy, Spain, Germany, France. In London, New York and Seattle. You get the picture. I am not a novice in this field.\n\nSo, the first time I went here I noticed the long lines, dirth of seating and stand-offish service, but no matter. The coffee was smooth, and gave a long lasting, deeply pleasureable caffeine high.\n\nSo, the following week i went 7 blocks out of my way to have another cup. I needed to work on a paper for school and figured I would combine coffee with a little word processing. I arrived and lo! it wasn't that busy. Then i noticed they seemed to have no outlets to plug in my Mac. Yeah, I'm a student, the battery is shot, i can't afford a new one right now.\n\nI then make a cardinal mistake. I ask the short, unsmiling hipster barista, (yeah you, with the dark hair, looking like you're in Interpol or something), 'do you have any outlets in here?' He musters all his venom and snidely responds, \"yes, we have THAT one\" and points to an outlet 20 feet in the air by the ceiling. I say, 'that's not very helpful.' He responds, very pointedly, 'we're about the COFFEE in here.' I am dumbfounded and enraged, which I imagine was his intention. So I can't be there for the coffee AND want to use my laptop?\n\nWell done. You just lost your boss a customer and earned this review, you supercilious little sh*t.\n\nSo, you are about the COFFEE, but not about being a CAFE, not about serving the needs of your CUSTOMERS and not about CUSTOMER SERVICE?\n\nOh, and $4 for a latte? I'll go to Philz next time. Coffee's good there, too.", "author": "Alison S."}

The single origin espressos are usually pulled on a hand pull machine, but they explained that wasn't available today. Oh well. Then after ordering a couple of other drinks I ordered a 2nd single origin espresso and the same person started to explain the same thing. Didn't you just tell me that and I said OK?\n\nWe ogled the well lit glass coffee making items just like everyone else. It is a nice distraction while you wait. And wait. And wait.\n\nWhile we waited we watched the FIVE people seemingly on staff at 4pm on a week day. Really? Five? Two people were on staff at Ritual and they took less time to take our order and serve us our drinks than these guys took just taking our order and we were down to 5 drinks by this time. One person took orders. Two people were on the espresso machine. One was washing dishes. The other walked back and forth a lot and we never figured out what she was doing. She had her jacket on so we thought at first she wasn't on shift, but she kept being behind the bar and kept walking back and forth, so who knows.\n\nFinally, they called out my name. Two of the five drinks were made. They were a latte and a cappuccino and they were gorgeous. The cappuccino had not even 1/8th an inch of foam on top. There was no gradation of coffee/milk/foam as I would expect. It looked great, but wasn't what I expected.\n\nThen we waited and waited and waited. Slowly the 3 espressos came out. This time the same guy called out \"single origin espresso\" even though I was standing right there and had just picked up drinks from the same order sheet so he knew my name. Every time he would call out a drink someone else would start to stand up to get the drink so I had to stay and hover to get what were clearly still my drinks from my order. I even asked the barista to sure and so the other people would know I wasn't taking their drinks. If you know my name and you can see that a ton of people are waiting and starting to grab the same drink, you call out the person's name if you know it.\n\nAll the while, there are two people at the espresso machine. What on earth is the second person doing? Cleaning? I can't quite tell. But she isn't pulling shots and while the guy pulling my shots is fantastic to look at and he has a great voice, he is the slowest barista we've seen today.\n\nAnyway, once we all FINALLY got our drinks they were excellent. The single origin espresso was fantastic. Truly. Wow. Did I say wow? Wow. Totally worth $3 for an espresso.\n\nThe standard espresso was surprisingly similar to our usual haunt in the East Bay, Zocalo Coffeehouse.\n\nI would have rated this a 5 star based solely on the drinks this time around, but the shockingly slow service and the fact that the drinks were only so-so last time I was here brings it down to a 4 star. I might have even gone down to a 3 star, but the single origin espresso was just so good I can't do it.", "author": "Mitch H."}

The like queues out the door, but there's a bit space on the other side of the coffee bar...and a GIANT table for family-style seating while you munch on your lunch.

If you want your cup taken seriously then this is the place to go. The options are wide, varied and affordable. This makes it a great place to frequent regularly. Although the place is known for its astounding coffee, Blue Bottle boasts a menu filled with simple flavor combinations that provide a gastronomic adventure to all.\n\nThe menu is extremely important to every coffee shop review because it says a lot about the type and range of services the establishment can offer. The breakfast, dinner and lunch menu changes throughout the year depending on what fresh produce or catch is locally abundant or available. It's a great way to learn about the area's local market. The ingredients are fresh and organically produced to guarantee safety from chemicals.\n\nThe interior design is crisp and simple and provides a sense of space and airiness. The lighting is strategically placed to cast a warm glow over the premises for a cozy and intimate feeling. Ambiance is considered for coffee shop reviews because it dictates how the customer feels as they walk inside the restaurant. The Blue Bottle projects an image of sophistication and elegance without being stiff or fussy.\n\nYou can opt for full table service or you can just get something to go. Either way, the staff will always be polite and helpful. Staff service can make or break a coffee shop review because everyone wants to be treated well. Customers who have experienced rude service are unlikely to come back even if the food and drinks are exceptionally good. A place's reputation and following depends on the quality of service almost as much as the quality of food being served.\n\nCoffee is the heart and soul of Blue Bottle and it is what has given them much acclaim in numerous coffee shop reviews. Blue Bottle serves what is arguably the best coffee in the world. Some clarify that they serve the best coffee outside of Europe but almost every critic agrees that the coffee is astounding. Many coffee lovers deal with overpriced, over caramelized drinks that are more sugar than coffee. Blue Bottle respects the taste and subtle nuances of real coffee and complements the flavors with their own serving style. The beans they use are roasted locally or on site for maximum flavor and freshness. Connoisseurs will delight in exotic and regional choices of bean that reflect their origin and offer different flavor bouquets.\n\nCombine great coffee with amazingly tasty pastries and you get the perfect hangout spot for people who want a brief respite from the business of their lives. This makes it ideal for a quick get-together, brunch with friends or a place to rest after a hectic bout of shopping. The combination of food choices, drink options, ambiance, cleanliness and service makes Blue Bottle the subject of resoundingly positive coffee shop reviews. Each aspect has been given special care and attention to ensure only the best for each customer.\n\n Augustus Smith.

I could fall from my bike into a puddle of sewage on the way to their Hayes St. kiosk - but I'd soldier on - and by the time I took my last sip of Gibraltar I'd be thinking about how the sight of brown slime drying on my battered organic jeans is beautiful, as is everything in this fair city.\n\nTherefore, it kinda hurts me to say that I think the cafe is missing something.  Nice windows, plenty of light, but sterile-feeling.  Plus stonefaced staff and pricey food.  \n\nI met my sis there yesterday morning before she barted out of town, and we walked in just before 8.  No line!  Window seats aplenty!  But service was lukewarm to indifferent, and we each paid $9 for our coffees plus little breakfast buns that appeared to be the only food items on offer.  \n\nCoffee was pristine as usual, and the brioche buns still-warm and buttery, but just as we started sipping and I told my sister that I thought they had an actual breakfast menu, a copy of the food list was plunked next to the register.  I'd have liked to know when ordering that steel-cut oats and eggs and toast were also options.  \n\nMaybe they're aiming for a different downtown crowd with this buttoned down, more-formal package, but for now I prefer to stand in a dripping alley and shout out my order.", "author": "Erin K."}

I love, love, love the coffee, so it really pains me to have to hate this new cafe. Yes, the space is beautiful, but in a supermodel kind of way - tall, icy and unapproachable. The place is seriously lacking in warmth - from the glass separating the masses from the coffee-making chemistry set to the matching uniforms that have turned the cool funky staff into some sort of barista-bots.  You will find me washing away the pretension over at the kiosk Hayes Valley.....\n\nUpdate: Since everyone is bitching about the no wireless I just want to say that I for one appreciate when a cafe just says no to people camped out for hours on their laptops.

I was really hoping that I wouldn't like it that much, since it costs $10-12 a pop, and seems generally kinda snooty to specially import a crazy $20,000 machine. \n\nUnfortunately, the fancy-schmancy siphon coffee was delicious. And since the portion serves two people nicely, the $10-12 price tag is not quite as bad. Still pretty ridiculous, but sort of justifiable if I try really hard. \n\nAlso, I really like the simple food that they serve. Blue bottle knows that if you take fresh bread, toast it and slather a crapload of butter on it, it's gonna be delicious. Who am I to argue? I left carbo-loaded and highly caffeinated, both of which had me buzzing a bit. Granted, the total cost per person was about $17, but you're gonna shell out at least $10 for a greasy-ass pile of eggs at any other place, so I wasn't really too peeved about it. \n\nI would give 5 stars for the food & coffee, but ended up giving just 4 because the prices really are high, and it's pretty crowded on the weekends to the point where I feel like I have to hurry up so that other people can get a chance to sit.", "author": "Julie J."}

And since it is off the beaten track, not too many touristy looking people.  \n\nCoffee - I've had the siphon coffee and french press coffee.  Both are excellent.  The siphon coffee is extremely rich and flavorful.  I prefer ordering the darkest roast, as the coffee has more body.  While some might balk at the price ($10-$13, depending on the roast), one is essentially getting the equivalent of 4 espressos (don't get this if you want to sleep anytime soon!).  Additionally, the siphon coffee comes with some toffee or caramel, which enhances the flavors of the coffee.\n\nFood - DELICIOUS.  I've eaten here for brunch twice.  Both times I've ordered the Artichoke Shepard's Pie.  Huge chunks of artichokes and caper berries in a tomato base, topped with potato puree.  Last time, I split with my sister, so I could have part of her Belgian waffle.  She said it was the best Belgian waffle she's ever had.  Its served with maple syrup and butter.  The consistency is light, crunch on the outside and moist on the inside.  My husband has had the Popeye Eggs (toast with a hole cutout and an egg inside) and the Croque Madame.  Again, both delicious.  \n\nThe minus one star is for their seating.  It can get crowded and some people tend to linger, so if you are with a couple friends, getting seats at the long table in the middle can be difficult.", "author": "Jory R."}

When I heard the cafe was opening, I almost DIED.  Then when I saw the mad scientist siphon machine pics on Flickr...I died again.\n\nSo my first time, I obviously had to get the siphon coffee.  $10-12 seemed like a little much, even for this coffee snob...but it's the kind of thing you have to at least try once.   I went with the Costa Rican Micro Mill selection for that day.  Smooth and flavorful, rich but not as in-your-face as the traditional pour-over drip method that is popular at the markets.  It was exciting to watch the brewing process and to drink from the suspended globe on your table, but I'll save it for when I bring out of town friends here.\n\nNext time I went with my tried-and-true macchiato.  Business was a little slower and they had a trainee make mine.  Probably the worst macchiato I've had from Blue Bottle, but still light years beyond what they try and pass off (if they even know what you're talking about) at most other places.\n\nAll in all, the cafe is a fun stop when you're downtown, but it's not the kind of place you can lounge all afternoon.  I'll bring friends and out-of-towners here for the novelty, or stop by for a high-quality fix or to pick up some beans when I'm in the neighborhood.

My oh my let  me just say after having a cup of just their drip coffee my life has been changed!  I love a good, strong cup of coffee and this was better than I ever expected.  The aromas are first to hit your nostrils, then the warm rich texture  rolls down your tongue followed by the taste!! Started off slow but ended with quite a punch - to the taste buds!  The staff was nice and got the long line of people in and out quite quickly.  The clientele left some to be desired - it still amazes me how entitled some people are but that's a whole different story and I didn't go to Blue Bottle to make friends or meet people who actually have manners - GASP! - I went for a damn good cup of coffee and by golly that's what I got!  Now to just keep hoping and praying Blue Bottle decides to open up a location (or two or ten) in Colorado - We do love our coffee here and I honestly think Starbucks would have some real competition if they did!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-14", "description": "I was finding it difficult to find a good cup of coffee in SFO until I found the Blue Bottle. Once I discovered it, I was back everyday during my stay in SFO. I tried lattes, espressos, macchiatos, New Orleans Ice coffee and some siphon cups. The various blends are nice to sample. I was never disappointed with the coffee.\nSo why the 4star rating? Well, to be honest, because 3 was too low.\nSeriously there are a few things that make this less than a fantastic coffee experience\n(1) the baristas are not very knowledgeable. Whether you want to have a discussion about brewing coffee or about the blends (they have as much knowledge as the 50 word descriptions on the labels), you are in the wrong place. Now for the Starbucks crowd, you will not notice a difference. On the other hand, if you've been to Intelligencia or Stumptown or even Coffeehouse NW, there is a significant difference in the people making your coffee\n(2) Along with Starbuck's style baristas, this particular BB is designed like a Starbucks - for not lingering about with your coffee. It is more comfortable than the stand-up coffee bars of Brazil, but if you want to sit and enjoy your brew and friends - this is not your spot. Needless to say, if you are an urban nomad looking for an oasis with good coffee, comfy sitting and WiFi, this is not it.\n(3) Call me old fashion, but my preference is not to drink out of paper cups. If you go to great lengths to craft a good brew, why drink it out a paper flavoring cup?! Paper seems to be the default serving mode, so don't forget to ask if you do not want it this way.\nBut at the end of the day, if you are going to stand in line for coffee in SFO, better here than Starbucks!\nAnd if it is summer, be sure to try the New Orleans Iced Coffee!\nEnjoy", "author": "ken a."}

Remember to buy some beans while you are there to brew wonderful coffee at home or if you forget just order it online. They make it so convenient for their customers. I also love that their website provides info/video on how to drip coffee at home (they sell the porcelain dripper for about $22 or $24 but I am perfectly happy with my Melitta dripper for only $2.99).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-21", "description": "so, i'm a local regular at the mint plaza blue bottle location. yes, the coffee is really excellent. but, in a city with many options for excellent coffee, i think there has to be something more to a coffee shop in sf beyond great coffee. this is especially true when one often has to contend with a line of (mostly) tourists at the mint plaza.\n\ni really enjoy the space itself. it's airy and receives amazing light through huge windows. it can get loud, but i personally really enjoy the space. the bathrooms are generally kept clean. there is always an amazing fresh floral arrangement on the counter. they have added additional security staff to maintain some sanity surrounding the store (which has a large homeless, mentally ill population nearby). the coffee is well reviewed elsewhere, and it stands up to its reputation.\n\nlately, however, i find myself coming back less often. somehow, this location has recently lost some of its specialness. it's not exactly one thing but there has been a series of recent changes that have somewhat genericized the store, especially taken in context of the high caliber sf coffee scene.\n\nfirst, the iconic kyoto iced coffee was reduced from the standard iced coffee size to a much smaller pour mostly because supposedly they couldn't make enough to keep up with demand. still, it was a disappointing move. then, a change in their house made pastry selection removed some of the most unique offerings, including my absolute favorite: a fennel-parmesean shortbread that was just amazing--a perfect combination of sweet and savory that couldn't be found anywhere else. i used to crave this shortbread, and i would visit especially to get the shortbread (and then coffee). the store used to bring in the new york times--it's gone now. the store recently remodeled its counter space. not only does it look shoddily done in areas (gaps in joints along the counters and wall space), but the under-counter coat hooks are now gone (the message seems, don't get too comfortable and stay too long). the store had recently been using an unhomogenized organic milk from strauss dairy. it was special and delicious with tiny pieces of cream in the cold milk--it made the new orleans ice coffee even more special. (now, the new orleans can be bought in cartons, just like starbucks sells its prebottled stuff, so you don't even have to bother yourself to come into the store.) i'm sure some of these changes increased profits because not a lot of people read the new york times or bought the parmesean shortbread or even knew there were coat hooks under the counters. but, i think sometimes you have to invest in the details and special things to make yourself matter to those who care the most.\n\nanyway, some of this might seem nit-picky, but in a city that takes its coffee houses seriously, this location, in my opinion, has less specialness left to justify a visit from an sf local with many (now superior) options for great coffee and a better experience.", "author": "D J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-07-17", "description": "I've been to the Blue Bottle in Hayes Valley (5 stars), but this was my first time at the Mint Street location.  I will start by saying that I have been in the coffee business for many years, as a roaster, barista and cafe manager/owner going back 20 years and covering California, Oregon and Washington, so I know coffee better than most.  And I want to be clear that Blue Bottle has excellent coffee, no question.  When I went to this location, it was a Sunday afternoon and there were no lines, so I was helped immediately.  No attitude, but no overt friendliness either.  The cappuccino itself would get 5 stars, but I also tried the Kyoto iced coffee and found the flavor unpleasant - very acidic, and not in a good way.  It was also stale, but there is no getting around that; coffee grounds will begin to stale within minutes of grinding the beans, and this style of iced coffee allows the grounds to sit out for many hours, so it will never taste fresh.  Not very pleasant.  I drank about a quarter of it and gave the rest away. And the siphon bar was closed for some reason at 3:30 in the afternoon - too bad, I really wanted to try it.  So for all of those factors, I would give this Blue Bottle a total 4 star rating.  But the neighborhood dropped the score two stars.  It is the most vile, filthy place in the City, and I was born in San Francisco.  In the short walk back to my car, I passed two men pissing on the street, multiple piles of human excrement, at least a half dozen meth heads and the foulest of odors.  I will NEVER go back to that location, and I am stunned that anyone would ever go there more than once.  Yes, the coffee is great, but that is not enough to overcome the location.", "author": "LeftCoast R."}

It was fairly complex, yet perfectly balanced--no harsh roastiness or acidity.  The drip coffee was excellent too.  I think they use the same beans as I tried at their Linden Street outpost.  Not sure what they are, but they yield an elegant blueberry-cream flavor that reminds me of the Ethiopian Sidamo coffee at LA Mill in Los Angeles.  Also superb was the rosemary pine-nut shortbread--bursts of sea salt and pine nut flavor and texture amidst a rosemary-butter backdrop.  Mmmm.", "author": "Anonymous P."}

Their acme toast is also amazing. It almost looks like fake cartoon toast because it is so large. It is soft and is paired with a yummy jam. Perfect for a morning snack.

For all the New Yorkers out there, it reminds me of a much more upscale Caf Grumpy - they have a similar way of organizing their coffees (by region) and it seems the menu rotates quite a bit.  I enjoyed the science lab feel of the place - pots of coffee are served in these Bunsen burner cum beaker contraptions and the dcor is that sort of severe, industrial-sterile.  That's not a bad thing, necessarily.  I enjoyed my latte that I took to go, but it didn't knock my socks off the way many a blend from Grumpy has.

Turned out it was opening that very day. Turned out that the very next day, I would convince my friend to drive up to San Francisco (160 miles, roundtrip, due to our going to school in Santa Cruz) to get just a cup of coffee.\n\nWasn't just a cup. I went and stuttered at the price, hesitantly handing over a dollar bill. The barista looked at me. I looked at him. \"This is only a dollar.\" I nodded. I looked at her and handed the $10 over, cursing myself. We'd already gotten this far, though, and I certainly was not going to wimp out, even though it meant $11 less to buy food later. It was raining pretty hard that day, so when we walked in, everyone was enjoying hot coffee along with a lot of food. I was cold. I was wet. I was tired. I got my coffee.\n\nJesus. To this day, I don't know where it knocked my socks off to, cause I'm missing socks now. It was love at first sip. So I sipped again, and again, and again, till that whole damned $11 beaker was gone. Then the beaker was gone too. The barista cleared it. Huh. good service. \n\nFive stars for Blue bottle. Five stars for the coffee. 50 stars for the iced coffees- New Orleans of Kyoto- I'm happy to hand over $3.50. Five stars for their food- I've only had toast but everything else looks good. Five stars for presentation, five stars for its uniqueness. Four stars for its hidden location, but hell, that's a good and bad thing. \n\nIf the two Blue Bottle Coffees were a pair akin to knives, this would be the big bad 10\" chef's knife compared to the paring knife of the Hayes Valley kiosk; it's not better simply because it's bigger, but one or the other is better in the sense that it would be more apt for certain..tasks, per se. The kiosk is a small, quirky place, and it charters to more of the go-getters- the people who live their lives waiting in line only to jet off with a paper cup in hand, newspaper in the other, most likely getting to the MUNI stop just as the bus is pulling away. The cafe, however, is larger, but more languid. Here, people will come and sit for thirty minutes. The customers, for the most part, stick around. Many will enjoy a piece of toast (their toast is otherwordly, with the jam, WOW) or just some steel-cut oats with their New York Times. The ambiance is relaxed, and so is everyone else. These people will walk out, thumbs hitched in their pockets, reading the Arts section, and hell, the bus just left. Only a few more minutes till the next.", "author": "Shelby C."}

It looked awesome and pure maple syrup is what I expect, but everything else was less so. First of all it took twice as long to get the french toast as it did to get the latte, so probably about 15 minutes. It was one slice of toast cut in two. For $9 it should have been amazing.

They ran out of toast, so out of an already limited menu of eight or so items, two items remained.  I don't understand how you run out of toast for a place that serves brunch.  I ended up having the belgian waffle which is tasty, but very light for a waffle.  Definitely not worth the $9 I paid for it considering there wasn't even fruit or whipped cream, just butter and syrup.  My friend had the salad (the other available menu item), which I must admit the dressing was very tasty and the soft boiled egg that came with it was yummy.

Much like the explanation of a fine wine, my eyes simply glazed over (I like figuring out flavors for myself) and after the waiter left, I just tried the beverage without any cream or sugar. I must say it was good. In terms of taste, somewhere between a regular cuppa joe and an espresso. Would I pay $6 again for this SOMA delight? Not likely.

No, not an exaggeration. My group's food was good but a little mild. I guess you could say a little mild but good, since the coffee's the point and really flavorful food would probably distract from that.\n\nThe cafe was offering three different coffees on siphon -- two Ethiopian, one Nicaraguan. My wife and I shared one of the Ethiopians (\"Idido Valley\" or something similar), and it was very good. We were given a taste of the Nicaraguan by somebody nearby at our very crowded table, though, and that was even better.\n\nAre you wondering whether it can be worth spending $10 for a pot of coffee? It you think it sounds ridiculous, it's probably not for you. It is for me if the coffee's this good.\n\nWent back on Thursday for a \"Kyoto style\" iced coffee, and I am trying to tamp down on my bias here, but I think it's the best iced coffee I've ever exchanged money for.\n\nOn coffee, even coffee for the prices they charge, I'd give this place five stars, but they're gonna have to prove the hour wait was a one time thing before I'm comfortable with that.

It was surprisingly empty and we walked up to the counter immediately, which was great.  The siphon coffee was tasty and fascinating, but when my friend asked the guy who delivered it to explain the system he sighed heavily and begrudgingly spat it out.  While he was talking she tasted her coffee and then reached for the cream, at which point he stopped his spiel and told her that  a true connoisseur would never put cream in this coffee.  So, in all, the coffee was good, the service was elitist, and the creamy polenta tasted like soft cardboard.", "author": "Gwen S."}

Only thing worse than cold coffee is cold service. The girl who \"greeted\" me, barely whispered a hello and then when I ordered a coffee with a shot of espresso to go, I was told \"we don't do that\". Oh, OK! Stupid me! Being flexible, I said I would just have an espresso to-go. Again, I got the response \"we don't do that either. Our espresso is so good, we don't serve it in to-go cups\". Again, trying to go with the flow, I said I would be fine then to drink my espresso in the Cafe.I have to say, it was the worst shot of espresso I have ever had (and all this before 730am! Bummer!) Anyhow, decided to give it another go the next day and ordered just a coffee to-go, to avoid the disaster from the day before. I got my coffee, minus any friendliness once again, and walked across the street to my office, took a sip, only to find it was barely hot. I really, really, really want to love Blue Bottle Cafe, so decided that perhaps the 3rd time would be a charm. Barely hot coffee again and this time, I was literally brushed aside as the staff that morning were swarming around getting ready for the TV crew that was there to film.  So here's the deal. I dig Blue Bottle coffee, but now only order it at other places like Bittersweet or Pizzaiolo. They serve it the way I like it and with a smile. Is that too much to ask for? So disappointed with my experience and being in public relations for the largest business on the block, they've missed a huge opportunity with me promoting their business. They should consider a new name... Blue Balls Cafe, it suits them perfectly.", "author": "Corinne S."}

I wasn't blown away by the coffee, but I have different preferences.  The atmosphere was crisp & clean; I tend to lean towards the cozy & gritty.  But the people watching was fantastic!  During just one cappuccino, I saw a French couple with 2 small children enjoying the finer things in life, a drag queen posse getting their caffeine fix after a long night, the cutest geeky guy reading his hardcover novel who was a sweetheart and offered us the extra stool next to him, and a woman in a tutu with black fishnets.  Well, it was the morning of the Pride Festival, so it probably wasn't the most normal of Sundays, but I loved it!  But I'm getting off topic... the coffee was all about preparation.  The one thing that separates them from all the other coffee shops out there is the siphoned coffee, which was very popular.  My friend tried to order it, but the Siphoner was on break until 1pm.  They actually have a person whose only job is to siphon the coffee!!  Tripped me out.  But I'm cool with drip... I don't need my coffee to be \"cleaner tasting.\"  It tasted clean enough to me prepared the regular way.  The food did look delicious... I was staring down everyone that had ordered the waffles, but I couldn't bring myself to spend $9 on one... even though it was covered with berries and looked positively scrumptious.  It does get pretty crowded in the place, but since it's at the end of a dead-end street, there is a small plaza just outside where you can sit on block type structures and enjoy the fresh air and sunshine... if you get that lucky!", "author": "Trina S."}

Normally my visit is early in the morning (before 8 am, if possible) so I have not experienced the weekend madhouse feeding frenzy that takes over this otherwise small and unassuming coffee joint. At 3 pm on Sunday, this place was PACKED. Packed to the brim, so crowded that you could not sit down, even if you wanted to. The line was nearly out the door, and once we ordered, it took about 20 minutes to get the coffee. Yes, 20 minutes to get the coffee. In the meantime, we devoured a small and airy hazelnut filled brioche while standing at the counter, packed in like a can of sardines with the rest of the coffee craving masses. So why you may ask, do I keep coming back to this place if the waitstaff has attitude and the crowds are horrendous?

As somebody else here noted, you're never going to get out of Blue Bottle quickly because they hand-craft each exquisite little beverage. That's ok if you know the deal and go there for a beverage--you want mass production, go to Starbucks--but James (the owner) needs an experienced expeditor/dedicated cashier so that if you just want to buy a half-pound of beans you don't have to wait through all that hand-crafting. Instead, all transactions are handled in real time and first-come-first-served and the cashier performs double duty making drip coffees as well as ringing sales and when dripping coffee, won't acknowledge you. In fact, it's not at all uncommon to approach the counter and have six people back there not acknowledge you in any way because that's apparently not in their respective job descriptions. That's crappy service and can ruin what should be a great experience. Don't assume putting money in the tip jar will be acknowledged either. It might be, depending on who's on duty, but it just as well might not. Same goes for getting a \"you're welcome\" out of some of the baristas--who admittedly have a high-pressure job I wouldn't want--when you thank them. James: If you're reading, please designate a manager for each shift and put him/her in a different uniform so your customers will know they have someone accountable to speak with, and take the necessary, simple steps to expedite the traffic flow. You've got a 90% beautiful thing going but it has structural flaws that anybody in the food and beverage business can spot.", "author": "David R."}

The iced coffee also TASTED quite yummy, so don't worry there. They also have another version, name is escaping me, that is made from a Wonka-esque contraption - we were told a batch takes something like a twenty-four hour period - wow. And they don't always have it - but it costs the same as the apparently low-brow New Orleans ($3.50).

(doesnt that apply to like all food establishments in the city)  but what really caught my attention was the siphon bar. the star was a $20K piece of over-engineered japanese caffeine junky machinery  (featured in NYT today) that is allegedly the only such machine in existence in the US. they apparently ask you to sip it black first and each serving comes with a piece of candy. \n\nunfortunately, we already had the best most creamy fragrant (clover milk) and smoky (the great beans) lattes in our hand... but hey, gives me an excuse to hang out with kaitlin again and stalk the cute chef...\n\nthe poached eggs on thick toast that everyone had looked really delicious too.\n\nGREAT lattes, cool space, siphon bar, great staff..\ngreat addition to the 'hood!!", "author": "v d."}

I just added a full review on my manseekingcoffee blog so check it out there, but you should definitely make a detour to check this place out. Just keep in mind it's really a kind of high end coffee restaurant and not a study cafe.", "author": "Man Seeking C."}

I  first fell in love with there smooth and creamy lattes about 2 years ago and when i found out that they were going to be just a few steps away from salon 801, i  was so excited to have  another amazing business join us in Mint plaza.  Thanks for all the great lattes and eye candy you bring to the plaza.   Cheers!", "author": "Lisa M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-23", "description": "Great coffee (best in city). Place has a nice buzz to it (social buzz, as opposed to caffeine type). The buzz can be a good or bad thing, depending on what you're looking for. The space has a very social vibe in its design (standing height and community-length tables, loud acoustics with large glass windows and cement floors, communal sugar/creamers at tables). As a result the volume can get quite loud. So, if this is your thing, you'll love it. If you're looking for a quite coffee-house spot to chill, this is not it. Because this is the best coffee in town and has gotten so much media buzz (there goes that word again...), the prices are high (25-30% premium above the overpriced coffee chains in town), the lines are long, and the wait to get a simple drip coffee is crazy. All that said, if you're in the mood and have the time, it's well worth the it. Enjoy! Oh yeah, forgot to mention that despite the somewhat chaotic atmosphere, the staff is super-chilled and friendly.", "author": "Joe C."}

But to no avail!  I have gone three times --once after calling to see if they were open (answer:\"Yup.\"  in truth: \"Closing in 5 minutes.\")  So by the time I arrived, of course, the drive was for naught.  Then, I came at 8:30 AM on a Sunday (opening time: 8:00 AM) and they said, \"Ummm...yeah, we're not making that coffee right now, 'cause the cooks are prepping for brunch and we can't get to the machine.  Maybe...like in  in ten or twenty minutes.\"  So I went and did some grocery shopping, came back in an hour, and they were all, \"Ummm...yeah...we're not making that 'coffee till like maybe ten, 'cause the cooks are prepping for brunch and we can't get to the machine...\" Argh!  So, if you are hot and bothered to get that coffee, call ahead, make sure they're not closing in 5 minutes and make sure the cooks aren't blocking the machine.  And bring your twelve bucks!", "author": "Sally C."}

Parking is near impossible given the proximity to the Westfield shopping plaza and the location is a bit hard to find (google maps failed me yet again).  Ordered the New Orleans iced coffee (served with half and half) and the Kyoto iced coffee (served black)... as I do not have a refined enough palate, I was unable to differentiate the different brew methods.  At $3.50 each, the price seemed steep but not outrageous given the pleasant, airy ambiance, and the care given to the roasting and brewing process.  I am not a black coffee drinker by any means, so me being able to drink the Kyoto black is a testament to how smooth and unbitter their coffee really is.  It has none of the burnt aftertaste of other coffeehouses, and it definitely will kick you into gear and maybe even into the jitters as it did to my companion.  Will definitely go back to try the siphon pot which I hear comes with delightful little caramels.", "author": "joyce h."}
