The food, *sigh*, not great. I got the Ramen of the day, which is a spicy duck confit ramen. Tastes like any ramen noodle bowl. My crew has duck chow Mei, fried chicken with fried rice and something else. The bill comes out with $25/each, not incl tips.

I heard about it before visiting the Bay and definitely had to try it at one point. However, I could never find it! I only realized later that the sign of the location said \"Lung Shan Restaurant\" and that Mission Chinese was actually located inside...\n\nThe vibe there really stood out to me as more Chinese-American as opposed to a traditional Chinese restaurant with cut outs of a Mickey Mouse and Michael Jordon and also some random Christmas lights hanging around. \n\nWe ended up ordering the lamb dumplings, the famous chongqing chicken wings, and a salt cod rice for the each of us. The lamb dumplings were delicious, but considering the size of each dumpling and the amount of them (5) for $9, it wasn't really worth the price point.  I could literally smell how spicy the chicken wings were and each of my friends was even afraid to eat it. However, trying it, it was a good amount of spice. I expected the wings to be a lot more oily considering it was a Chinese restaurant, but the chicken was cooked very evenly with the dry spice rub.\n\nThe salt cod rice was probably the best bang for your buck here. For $13, the amount was pretty wild. There was so MUCH RICE. I actually expected pieces of salt cod in the fried rice, but I feel they mixed it in when cooking the rice so the rice had a salt cod taste to it otherwise it was just eggs and Chinese sausage. Nonetheless, I left a satisfied customer. All the items I had was very good, but the price points for most of them isn't really worth it.", "author": "Timothy D."}

Outside, the marquee says \"Lung Shan Restaurant,\" but inside, the heart and soul of the restaurant is the famous Mission Chinese Food. The decor also looks nothing like a typical, drab Chinese-American restaurant--instead, there are colorful dragons dancing along the ceiling, along with a cutout of Michael Jordan, Mickey Mouse, and strings of Christmas lights. What??\n\nAnd then there's the menu. Some of the items may have a Chinese food-sounding names, but the descriptions are anything but! We started with the spicy sichuan Kimchi in spicy macadamia oil and the amazing fried Westlake lamb dumplings served with tzatziki sauce and spicy chili oil! The lamb dumplings were a standout for me--the flavor of the lamb somehow went so well with the creamy tzatziki sauce, and the chili oil gave everything a spicy-numbing tinge.\n\nNext, we had the cabbage cooked with pistachio milk, which was a nicely seasoned vegetable dish, as well as the Mongolian longbeans, a huge platter of fried beans with horseradish and Sichuan peppercorns. The matcha meyer lemon noodles were just as interesting as the name sounds--the noodles sat in a matcha-infused broth and were dressed with cucumber, radish, and herbs. But the definite favorite dish of our group was the lamb and squid ink pappardale. The thick strands of black pasta were perfectly al dente and had the most amazing texture, and they were complemented with tender pieces of lamb shoulder, along with harissa yogurt, fennel, onion, and watercress. The flavors of the dish were reminiscent of a Chinese stir-fry (\"wok-hay\"), but the dish also had a distinctly Mediterranean/Italian feel--fascinating!\n\nIndeed, Mission Chinese was a cool, memorable experience.

The peppercorns are quite generous here so if you like the numbness of traditional Szechuan dishes this one is for you. 4/5\n- Sour chili chicken: This was so salty I feel like the Chef must have done something wrong. I wouldn't recommend this order. 0/5\n- Cumin lab ribs: This is alright. It came out screaming hot on a cast iron mini server and smoked up the whole table. Pretty entertaining to watch but definitely overkill (thanks for the carcinogens?). Also didn't really taste the cumin here. 3/5\n- Steamed market greens: This was actually my favorite, and had a nice light broth and cooked in peanut oil I think. Probably was the most authentic dish we ordered. 5/5\n- Chinese Giardiniera: Cloud ears are wood ears: that brown, floppy mushroom that is popular in China. This tastes like something my ma would make. 5/5\n\nOther comments:\n- We were a party of 4 who came here ~6 pm and left at 8:20. So the wait time/service was fine. \n- I'm 5'9 and I sat next to someone who's 6'2.

You're so hip that the sign outside says \"Lung Shan\" and if you look really hard behind the bars in front of the window, you'll find a one-foot square sign that actually says Mission Chinese Food. http://bit.ly/2n2WqoK\n\nThis place is so hip, the small restaurant was crazy crowded at 6:30pm on a Saturday night. We added our name to the waiting list and got a table roughly 20 minutes later. This place is so hip that it has a large dragon hanging from the ceiling, extending the length of the restaurant with club lights flashing to the loud rap music. The Meateater BF has a theory about the loud rap music, which wasn't even good rap, is that it's a tactic to turn tables more quickly. I think he has a point.

Very gingery and refreshing. I like the use of macadamia nuts. This was the perfect palate cleanser.\n\nMongolian Long Beans, while they were good, sort of fell below our expectations. The menu sold us on the idea of fresh horseradish which we could absolutely see sprinkled on top but could not taste it at all. Also, this dish was a bit on the salty side.\n\nMy favorites were definitely the Stir Fried Pumpkin and the Rice Cakes. I wasn't expecting the pumpkin to be thin-shaved pieces nor was I expecting it to be a bit on the al dente side which made me super into this dish! The Rice Cakes had this tasty black bean sauce and sweet tofu skin. Yum! ...except for the bitter melon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-21", "description": "I think I missed the boat on Mission Chinese Food's hey-day because, having just eaten there for the first time yesterday, I had a somewhat lackluster experience. This is definitely a destination restaurant because the neighborhood itself has zero charm. (But this is coming from someone who has not spent much time in SF.) In 2010, it would've been novel to eat at a hipster restaurant hidden inside an old Chinese hole-in-the-wall storefront. Today, it feels a little tired, like the restaurant itself hadn't evolved. But I'm probably missing the point--\"if it ain't broke why fix it\". I'm also eight years older now and fall into a completely different age bracket.\n\nThat being said, the menu is indeed filled with inventive Chinese-fusion dishes, though, we veered toward the more familiar ones. The Sichuan Kimchi and Tiger Salad were a light refreshing start. I actually really loved the Tiger Salad, which appeared as large bundles of dressed mizuna greens and herbs wrapped in wide, supple rice noodles and topped with a stack of shredded nori and sesame seeds. Next, we had their popular Chongquin chicken wings. To me, these were just OK. The wings were crispy and coated with a dry spice mix and tossed with dried whole chili peppers. I expected them to be spicier but they were pretty tame. I think this recipe is in their cookbook with the inclusion of fried tripe. I think this dish really needed that kind of outr\u00e9 element to make it pop. As our entree, we shared the Pork Mapo Tofu with a side order of steamed jasmine rice. It was delicious, like what you would probably find at a traditional Chinese hole-in-the-wall (and I mean that in the best way).\n\nThe good thing for us was that we came here for a late lunch and didn't have to wait in line. I really wanted to love this place but it felt a little bit neglected and as though it lost its verve. Maybe the vibe is different at nightfall. (Come to think of it, I don't think I'd feel safe coming to that neighborhood at night.) Unfortunately, I can't see myself going out of my way and returning to dine here. All in all, I think Mission Chinese Food could use a 2018 reboot. It has so much potential and I could definitely see that it began with a wellspring of creativity and lots of energy.

I'm not sure why people wait in lines outside when ressies are very easy to make. Anyways, we got there about 10 min late, the store sign shows Lung Shan Restaurant so don't be fooled. \n\nWe were quickly seated though initially, we were asked whether we would be ok taking a seat at the end of a communal table. When I asked how long it would be for a wait for a private table, we were still able to be seated immediately (I guess I can't blame him for trying though later on, I saw the 2 seats at the end of a communal table and there definitely wasn't enough room for 2). \n\nLove love the ambiance - there's a huge dragon, great energy, lots of hip hop music in the background, but they still maintain remnants of Chinese restaurants (those plastic cups). \n\nWas disappointed to see only 1 cocktail on the menu (Chinese mule) when I heard the location in NYC has a lot more interesting options. Even more disappointed to see our server pour it from a premade pitcher :( Guess this isn't the place to get a nice cocktail.\n\nWe settled on sharing a few things - thrice cooked bacon and rice cakes, country fried hamachi collar and tiger salad. The bacon rice cakes were good - definitely very glutinous and heavy but good flavors. Tiger salad was actually wrapped in rice paper similar to rolls you'd see at a Vietnamese restaurant. They were just ok. My favorite was the hamachi collar which was the most interesting and authentically represented; however the portion size is pretty small for $18. \n\nService was just ok. Our server who initially took our orders was really awesome but halfway through the meal, we were handed a check even though one of our dishes hadn't come out yet. It was strange that she didn't even ask us anything but just handed us the check. I guess they're going for the authentic hole in a wall Chinese restaurant experience? haha\n\nOverall, there's some interesting food that's worth checking (and the ambiance is great) out but unlikely to return. $70+ bill for 3 dishes and 2 drinks - very anti-Chinese :) I also didn't think the food was that spicy and it was pretty telling that most of the clientele were non-Asian.", "author": "Yin H."}

The thrice booked bacon dish contained three small pieces of bacon (see attached). Not a hint of all the other vegetables and things they're supposed to have in there. It was more a thrice cooked rice cake dish with a dash of bacon. Sad, but true.\n\nWith $17 for what's essentially a stir fried rice cake dish, and $12 for a small container of rice with no chicken and not enough flavor - if I wanted a $30 rice dish, I'd go to Nobu you know? - I'm confident in my assessment that the things that once made this one  of the most interesting and delicious restaurants in the city are no more. \n\nCallous customer service, a detached cooking process that optimizes a bottom line vs being true to a dish, and exorbitant prices for dishes that barely live up to their names are more than enough for me to recommend steering clear of mission chinese.", "author": "Viksit G."}

Because of the long lines, we decided to make an early reservation on a Tuesday and it was a greta choice. By the time we were seated you can see the crowd starting to show up.\n\nWhen we first arrived we expected some authentic Chinese food, especially because the sign on the outside is nothing like the environment in the inside which I though was kind of cool. The inside is decorated with dragons and various ornaments hanging from the ceiling and there was this cool red lighting. The place was also very dicey and trendy in the sense that they play hip, up-to-date hip hop music!\n\nAnyways, the menu is definitely more fusion and not your typical dishes for a Chinese restaurant. There were five of us and we are a family that can eat. I would probably suggest EVERYTHING that we ordered.\n\n1. Smashed Cucumbers\n2. Golden Mountain Spring Roll (Crispy)\n3. Broccoli beef brisket\n4. Beef Chow mein\n5. Mongolian Long beans\n6. West Lake Rice Porridge \n7.

It's 80% in the styling of an early nineties Chinese joint that I grew up with - down to the menu and wooden tables - and 20% owner's personality. Dragon and lights hanging from the ceiling were a sight as well as the mostly hip-hop soundtrack. You can't sleep on the art in the restaurant as well - personally admired the one with the Chinese men on horses. I also respect how they advertised the Asian Art Museum.\n\nFor the food, the rice cakes with (vegan option) bacon was unexpectedly sweet. It was less spicy than what I remembered it to be but still flavorful. It was also a bit tangier (in a very good way) than my next dish. The Sour Chili Chicken had a nice surprise with the potatoes. Garlic Fried Rice went well with the Nori. Mint and Oolong tea to wash it down; it was the perfect closer.\n\nOne note though: I can't give the W to this over my hometown team. Simple reason: I really like the pizza at the LES location. It's odd that I find it to be one of my favorite pizzas in NY but that's just me (it's subjective, deal with it)!\n\nEither way, it's a great restaurant and worth the wait.

Both dishes are a little oily with only the cumin lamb having a slight spicy taste to it. \n\nI have two complaints. First the menu says cumin lamb rib however our dish was 90% vegetable and about 10% lamb. The lamb just came in small chunks. Not what I imagine for lab rib, but the food still tasted good. My second complaint was the service. Our waiter was rude and seemed like she just didn't care about customer service. When we asked for more water or a to go box she wouldn't respond which was confusing because I had no idea if she heard us. Then she would come to our table, bring whatever we asked and then leave without saying a word.

Sometimes the food is an exercise in peppercorn tolerance rather than taste but for the most part I appreciate their flavorful and unique takes on traditional Chinese dishes.\n\nFirst off, I love the interior of this place. It's divey, dark and moody instead of ultra brightly lit like many Chinese places, and if you're like me this makes a big impact on whether or not your truly enjoy sitting down for a meal. Yes, a standard like Z&Y is really good and perhaps more authentic but I don't really want to hang out in that dump for more than the time required to order and eat. This said, even though the space is more enjoyable at Mission Chinese you're likely going to feel some pressure to get out because it's often pretty busy (especially during the weekends!)\n\nI've enjoyed most of what I've had on the menu. There are a few things that sound better than they are: the Kung Pao pastrami is so salty you'll think they brined it for a month out in the Pacific Ocean, and the Salt Cod Fried Rice was a little too subtle for my tastes to warrant an order in the future. But man, the Mapo Tofu is worth every drop of sweat you'll produce wolfing down what is perhaps one of the best, most flavorful versions of the classic Szechuan dish. Speaking of over-the-top numbing, the Thrice Cooked Bacon & Rice cakes can occasionally be a bit painful and no amount of the delicious, sugary cakes will counter balance the effect - but it's worth it.\n\nThis is also some of the best takeout in the city as they offer their own delivery to most of the city and the prices are pretty cheap (2-4 bucks for most places), especially if you consider the same delivery would cost you 4x from Postmates.\n\nSome of your friends are going to roll their eyes at you when you say you want to eat here.

My party arrived around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, and there was surprisingly no line. In fact, there were only two other groups in the restaurant, so our meal arrived quickly.\n\nWhen it comes to authenticity, I'd say the food here falls right in between authentic Chinese food and Americanized versions like Panda Express. The mapo tofu we ordered tasted pretty similar to the real thing you'd find in China, but the kung pao pastrami, on the other hand, was a unique dish with true Asian flavors but foreign ingredients. Many items on the menu are labeled spicy, but the spice levels were not at all bad. As someone with a relatively low tolerance, I was still able to enjoy every dish. I also tried the salted cod fried rice, which was good, but very similar to something I could just make at home myself. The few pieces of cod were delicious, but it definitely takes some digging to find them. For me, the star of the show was the pork belly. While paying $15 for two chunks of meat isn't what I normally consider to be a great deal, it was well worth it. The adorable tiki-fashioned dish tastes as good as it looks-- the meat is juicy, tender, and bursting with flavor!\n\nAltogether, the meal was enjoyable and I had a lot of fun trying these creative fusion dishes.

But, overall, I would definitely recommend coming here. One aspect of this place I did not like was how cramped it was. There really was not much space in the restaurant and some people had to even sit at a communal table. The restaurant was also very loud which may not be so annoying to you but was to me. Additionally, the neighborhood isn't exactly pretty if that is important to the enjoyment or relaxation of your meal. But despite these non ideal aspects to Lung Shan Restaurant, I still give it 5 stars . This is because of the incredibly delicious food it serves. The chow mein I ordered was the best plate of Chinese food I had ever had. The flavors released by the chemical bonds of the splendid chow mein noodles were pure and righteous.

If you are looking for that authentic grunge of an old Chinese restaurant you'll love the peeling paint, chipped tables, efficient if not friendly service, and waking through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. The food is inventive and interesting. Some of the portions (like the long beans) are gigantic while others (like the lamb dumplings and the wine) are pretty small. Everything is pretty greasy.

Had my expectations lowered since it opened years ago and the hype seemed to have died, also bc the chef is over at the new restaurant in NYC now. \n\nWalked in and it's like I walked into a Chinese American Horror movie set. The dragon hanging overhead was cool, but the red orange dimly lit setting made it a big dingy and scary. You could see the age of the place as the lanterns and dragon was covered in dust and colors were faded.\n\nFood- between the four of us: KUNG pao pastrami- super salty and dry, flavors are all over the place, too heavy on peppercorns, least of my favorite dish today. MATCHA ginger scallion noodles- favorite dish today, noodles are squid ink and cooked al dente, with nice balanced flavors of ginger, scallions, and a tiniest bit sweet. CHINESE bento with mapo tofu- mapo tofu was okay, the mala (numbing spiciness) was at a good level. CHONGQING chicken wings- pretty good, fried crispy and the meat was moist, spicy and numbing. \n\nService/Staff- very good service from our waiter who took our orders correctly and was attentive. Brought us two pitchers of water and didn't rush us to pay the bill. There was an older female staff whom he called 'grandma' who helped set the tables and didn't smile at all, sat behind us and blasted her iPad with mandarin soap opera. Interesting. \n\nI would not wait more than 20 minutes for food here. I was pleasantly impressed by the noodles, so may come back to try other noodles. Price is not cheap, noodles were $14 and the Kung pao pastrami was $16, which I wouldn't pay $5 for (we left half the plate uneaten). Be prepared for high sodium and loads of msg. Restroom is in the way way back. As I walked to it, I passed by the kitchen and several staff who were working. Interesting mixture of staff. It was an interesting experience.", "author": "Iris H."}

We wanted to make it an epic night, and boy, was it! We had put our names on a list at another restaurant, and were walking around to possibly find something sooner. My friend asked me, \"Have you ever been to Mission Chinese?\" I told her that I hadn't, and have always wanted to, but I JUST had Chinese food yesterday. \"This isn't Chinese food,\" she said. I decided to take her word for it, and now I know exactly what she meant. Mission Chinese is an experience that everyone should have, more than once. The seating is mostly communal, the ceilings house flying dragons, and the music and light combination create a legit yay area vibe, yadidamean?\nWe ordered some beers and Tiger Salad to start. The food here is an art, crafted for your eyes and mouth to water. The Tiger Salad reminded me of some sea creatures that would dance along with Ariel underwater. Tasty, fresh, simply phenomenal.  Also, we ordered the Garlic Rice, Vegetarian Thrice Cooked Bacon, and Eggplant. Party in my mouth good! \nWe were also graced with a complimentary bottle of sake from some generous sake angel. Our waitress, Stephanie, was super sweet and knew how to throw down some dance moves as she moved between tables.  \nMy first experience here was definitely a wild ride that I'll be ridding again.", "author": "Alicia F."}

The restaurant atmosphere is extremely laid back and non-fussy, making it a go-to after a long day at Dolores Park when you don't feel like getting dressed up to go out. The prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes in San Francisco. The staff was quick and accurate, but definitely did lack in politeness. The host initially refused our request for one of many slightly larger tables, which we asked because my friend is very tall and couldn't fit at the tiny one they gave us, but he then sat well-dressed couple at the table we had asked for.

When I first saw the place, I was confused as to why the sign doesn't say \"Mission Chinese Food\" but \"Lung Shan Restaurant.\" And then I saw the sticker with the Mission Chinese Food rickshaw on the window of the restaurant and felt that it was oddly familiar...\n\nOkay, so this place's twin sister in New York was featured in Anthony Bourdain's show \"The Layover.\" I immediately got excited because I adore Anthony Bourdain and have so far loved everything he recommended. This place is... very different. There is a huge Chinese paper dragon that hangs on the ceiling throughout the place while EDM-y music blasts away. The place was mostly dark with a lot of red-ish LEDs and green laser lights, so if your concealer isn't working to cover up your pimple, don't worry, because nobody will see it in this place.

Or so I thought...\n\nOur party ordered Chongqing Chicken Wings, Kung Pao Pastrami, Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice cakes, and Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito with Cod Fried Rice and Fries (if I'm not mistaken). The portion sizes were not that big for the price - definitely not family-size. Each of the plates are individual-sized and rice is not included in the price. Since the prices were already pretty expensive, we didn't order any sides and only ordered water for drinks. Now for individual dishes...\n\nLet me start with the Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito with Cod Fried Rice and Fries. Yeah, so I thought each of those things would come seaparately - like it's 1 Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito, an 1 Cod Fried Rice, and a bowl of fries. At around ~$13, I thought it was a steal! Nope. EVERYTHING is in ONE burrito. The burrito was okay. I went there 2 weeks ago and already forgot, so not that memorable, but I remember it being okay.\n\nMoving on to the Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice Cakes. Very greasy. Very salty. But tasty. Worth the price? At $16, I don't think so. The rice cakes are cut into little disks and the bacon cut into little squares. The bacon was very flavorful while the rice cakes were almost devoid of flavor except for the outside, so it balances the aggressiveness of the bacon flavor. But I felt that something was missing - the rice cakes were too bland. Like eerily bland on the inside. Other than that, it's an okay dish.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami. $16. Very Salty. It's also pretty good, but bite after bite, the saltiness will overthrow the balance of the taste.\n\nNow moving on to a diamond in the rough for this restaurant and the redeemer of my whole visit. Now, I like spicy food, but anything that will inflame body parts other than my tongue, I'm opposed to. The Chongqing Chicken Wings changed my mind. In the first bite, it was okay. Slightly spicy to the tip of the tongue. But a true feature of an excellent spicy savory food is the build of the spice. Yes, what I meant is that it will get spicier with every bite. This chicken does just that. The salt levels were on point, the sweetness is there, the spice builds to the point where I didn't realize that my mouth was going slightly numb. And the numbing feeling is surprisingly very fitting to the whole experience. It truly is sublime.\n\nAm I glad I went here? Yes. Would I go back here again? Probably not. As good as the chicken wings were, it was a once-in-a-blue-moon experience that is better savored when it's not often repeated. Everything else was meh and talking over the music is hard. I would go somewhere quieter for a hangout next time.", "author": "Jessica P."}

The restaurant wasn't packed even an hour later at 6pm.  This place has been majorly hyped and it met my expectations.  I've had Sichuan food quite a bit and I'm not a fan of the constant numbing sensation or the Sichuan pepper taste, but I loved the food here!  Everything tasted interesting and not annoyingly fusion.\n\nTea-smoked eel rolls: Enjoyed the texture of the crispy eel against the supple rice noodles.  A little on the salty side though and I had no idea there was braised pork in it.\n\nMapo tofu: I never order this dish when I go out but I knew I had to get it here.  It was chunky and saucy.  Even the version without pork was delicious.\n\nThrice cooked bacon and rice cakes:  My second favorite dish of the night!  It has the same flavor profile as the mapo tofu (spicy, greasy, peppery) but the bittermelon offsets the intenseness.\n\nMongolian long beans: Even if you're craving vegetables, I would skip this dish.  It won't feel healthier because it's covered in quite a bit of grease and the flavor is intense.\n\nStir fried squid ink noodles: My FAVORITE dish of the night.  The squid ink noodles pairs perfectly with the lamb chunks.  I don't know how but it just does.  The lamb is so good even on its own.  This dish is a nice balance to the other very spicy and grease-laden dishes.  I overheard other tables say this was their favorite dish as well.\n\nEven though I really enjoyed the food, it's a bit heavy for me.  I feel like I've tried the most popular dishes but if there is a new, must-try dish, I'd consider coming back.  It's a nice place to take out-of-towners because it's likely that they've never had something like this before.", "author": "Shannon L."}

I'm currently enjoying my month-long Chinese immersion and how better to do so than a repeat visit to Mission Chinese Food?  \n\nNot many restaurants could serve as litmus tests for the range of human personalities but I'm convinced that if any could, it'd be Mission Chinese.  I'm not certain that I'd like everyone who fell into the camp of \"MCF fanatic\" but I do think scientists studying the brains of those in that camp would find many similarities.

Perhaps he's not one of the tribe but I'm all in.  Call it greasy, oily, overpriced for Chinese food, overly-hyped, whatever; I'm just calling it all - every last bit of it - delicious.

This food ages well.  \n\nPrices have risen by $2-$4/item since my previous visit (dinner for 3, pre-tip, ran about $90).  They've added outposts in NYC and LA.  Cookbooks have been issued.

The lights are dim, the music is loud, the bass is thumping, the lines are long (though reservations are now accepted), servers practically throw the food on your table as they pass by, and the place is somewhat of a dump but everything - every last thing here - is still working. \n\nAs you read this your dopamine receptors either lit up or stayed flat.

However, if you wanted to try the salted cod fried rice... well, that's plenty salted too.\n\nI still like the food.

Anyway, even though it was suppose to be the flavor of the fried rice, I couldn't taste any salted fish. There were not enough Chinese sausages either. If I combined all the slices of meat on that place, it wouldn't even make up one WHOLE sausage. I go through a Kam Yen Jan pack a week, I'd know. \n\nConclusion: The overall fried rice was dry, lacking flavor. Taste like how fried rice would taste if a teenager was trying to make fried rice for the first time and forgot to turn on the stove burner. \n\nWestlake Lamb Dumplings: Pretty good. The dumplings were deep-fried so the lamb meat was dry and tough. Probably not the ideal meat to put in a fried dumpling, in my opinion. The ranch sauce it sat in made up for it.\n\nChongQing Chicken Wings: On the menu, it said it was numbingly spicy. Spoiler: It wasn't. These wings was the dry rub kind.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-09", "description": "This review really saddens me, as I have been to the restaurant once as well as ordering delivery probably over two dozen times. Those past experiences were everything other people have said; their food was delicious and innovative. There's a reason they are internationally famous at this point. Unfortunately, as a foodie, a home chef, and someone who has worked in the restaurant industry, I have to now give them a one star review.\n\nI ordered delivery again tonight, and the food, for the first time ever, was awful. I ordered the sour chili chicken, the market greens and an order of rice. I've ordered these dishes many times and they have always been impeccable. This time, the rice had literally no stickiness whatsoever. The greens were tough like they had barely been cooked, and under-seasoned. The chicken was cold and flavorless. And, about halfway through my bowl I found a long hair in my food. Mission Chinese has always been very consistent. Consistency, I feel, is one of the most important aspects of running a restaurant. It establishes trust with the customer and the integrity of your brand. I can understand one or two minor mistakes; but to go from internationally famous cuisine to awful, overpriced delivery in an instant is unforgivable.\n\nFortunately, as I said, I'm a very proficient home chef, and I just purchased their cook book, so I will probably be able to produce better results at home compared even to the restaurant's original awesomeness, simply because well-cooked home food is always going to be better than what you can get in even the most high-end restaurants. I purchased all of the ingredients for the thrice-cooked bacon a couple of days ago, and I can't wait to eat it over freshly cooked donabe rice.\n\nThe unfortunate side is that I no longer have a solid, amazing and convenient Chinese food delivery option. And I will probably not visit the restaurant again now. It's especially sad because they really were one of the best Chinese food restaurants in the city. There are many other restaurants that for some reason have had much longer staying power in terms of consistent quality, delivering the same excellent product for years or even decades. Sadly, some restaurants just don't have that kind of stamina, and the quality eventually falls. I'm especially saddened that Mission Chinese is one of these restaurants as opposed to the former. \n\nThank you Mission Chinese for the excellent food in the past, opening my mind to the possibilities of Asian fusion, and the excellent cook book that will yield countless unforgettable meals for myself, my spouse and my friends; so long.", "author": "Steve S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-15", "description": "Heard so many good things about Mission Chinese Food and finally gave it a try to be let down. I have had my fair share of restaurants, but MSF has let me down to a new level.\n\nFirst off, I came here around 8:30pm on a weekday and was seated after a short wait. I sat by the entrance and could not ignore the horrible stench coming from the street that smelled like trash and other unnamed odors. Atmosphere was definitely off putting on the smell alone, but the rest of the restaurant wasn't so great either. The whole establishment is dark and lit by lanterns with a giant dragon hanging overhead, which seemed over the top and tacky. Tables were also so close to each other that you can overhear other peoples' conversations and getting by around the restaurant was a hassle, along with probably being a fire hazard.\n\nThe worst part was probably the food. I used Yelp as a guideline on what to order and ended up getting the pork mapo tofu, broccoli beef brisket, and salt cod fried rice. Before anything else, THIS FOOD IS SALTY. The rice and brisket came almost immediately upon ordering which was surprising since the restaurant was busy and the tofu came about ten minutes after. The waiter and waitress who attended us were also pushy when we were deicing to order and asked if we knew what we wanted before we even sat down. \n\nThe pork mapo tofu was probably the most disappointing dish I have ever had, and I have had plenty of mapo tofu in my life. Upon first taste, the soft tofu with spice is delicious, but then the worst after taste comes immediately after. My boyfriend also thought the same about the dish; the tofu was nicely cooked but the sauce was unpleasant. It was spicy, but had a tangy aftertaste that burned the tongue in a strange way I had never experienced before. \n\nThe broccoli beef brisket was interesting, but had much too salt to actually enjoy it. The dish was mainly broccoli stalks with a skimpy portion of cubed brisket. There was a sauce that overpowered the entire dish to the point where the broccoli didn't taste like a vegetable and the beef tasted like a sauce sponge instead of meat. The idea of this dish is great, but poorly executed in a way where the flavors did not agree and work together. Less sauce and salt would have definitely done this dish some justice.\n\nThe salt cod fried rice was just ok. It reminded me of homemade friend rice, so it was nothing outstanding or great despite the multiple raves for this dish. Typically, salt cod fried rice lives up to its name of being salty rice dish, but with the tofu and brisket dish being so over flavored with salt and sauce, the rice tasted lacking. Salt does not equal \"flavor.\"\n\nOverall, this place is a complete miss. Parking was also a hassle on a weeknight so we had to park over 1.5 miles away, so definitely consider walking or taking public transit. I feel that the hype for this place gave me expectations that could have been met, but Mission Chinese Food dropped the ball. The food was also priced for the portions and quality, with most dishes being over $10 with messy presentation. Overly salted food, lack of service, and disgusting environment and atmosphere makes MCF a no-go for me.", "author": "Cindy L."}

The menu definitely has some eye-catching dishes (tomato beef tartare, and Westlake Lamb Dumplings) - and a few head-scratching ones as well (Kung Pao Pastrami??). Our group decided to order a bunch of dishes to share, while our vegetarian friends did their own thing. The carnivore side of the table opted for the Kung Pao Pastrami, the Beef Chow Mein, the Sour Chili Chicken, and the Ginger Scallion Chicken Fat Fried Rice. It was all fine for the most part. Though truthfully, nothing really stood out for me. I'm thinking maybe we should have tried a few other things like the Mongolian String Beans or the Chicken Wings. The famous \"Kung Pao Pastrami\" really didn't work for me. I think it's one of those dishes that sounds more interesting than it actually is. If you're thirsty for an adult beverage, they have s small selection of beers and wine. But if you're looking for cocktails, I'd recommend going to Cha Cha Cha across the street, or Blondie's a few blocks away.\n\nIt's clear that Mission Chinese is in the business of moving tables. They don't want you staying too long, because they've got plenty of hipsters outside waiting to take your seat. Now I would never normally complain about fast service, but I was a bit surprised by how quickly our dishes came out of the kitchen (we're talking 5-10 minutes after ordering), especially in a restaurant that's so busy. It did make me wonder if perhaps we received another table's order, or if they just have a bunch of pre-made dishes that they just warm up and serve. \n\nAll in all, it was a 3-star dining experience (good, just not great).

The spicy ma po tofu was spicy, but not in a way where you can feel the heat. I think it literally burns your taste buds and leaves your mouth tingling-- that kind of spicy. After I stopped eating it, and went for a cup of water, the mouth tingled even more. Breathing in air through my mouth even tingled. I don't know what that means but the tofu was bomb af either way. The spicy beef chow mein was definitely the kind of spicy where you can feel the heat and the sweat forming on your face.

But another lady was really helpful and service was great from her so overall, 4/5 stars.\n\nLocation: I arrived around 5:30PM, when the sun was still up, and there wasn't a wait (but as we were leaving, people were putting down reservations and the wait list was 4+ parties already). The area is kinda sketchy. We parked .4 miles away from the actual restaurant and passed by a couple of people that catcalled my friend on the way back. We also passed by people holding syringes and people selling stolen clothes. So, note: walk in groups if you feel unsafe after it gets dark.", "author": "Jasmine L."}

When it came to Mission Chinese Food, I'm glad I did.\n\nOne night I was busy working (from home, but still working nonetheless) and didn't want to go out and pick anything up for dinner.  In a moment of desperation and starvation, I decided to order Mission Chinese Food for delivery.  It would be an hour and a half wait, but I still had work to do, so fine.\n\nI was craving the salt cod fried rice, which is why I actually ordered MCF because I'd read good things about that dish.  Since there was a delivery minimum, I decided to make two meals out of it and order what I had almost 4 years ago - the thrice cooked bacon with rice cakes.\n\nMy order was actually 17 minutes late (I only know this exact number because when I looked up at the clock, it was 7:18 and I checked the email to see when the food was promised, and it said 7:01).  Just as I was about to call them, the doorbell rang, and I was able to shove all the food in my face.\n\nThrice cooked bacon - they definitely updated this.  No onions, but there were lots of rice cakes, tofu skin, and some pieces of bacon.  There were also hot peppers and bitter melon slices, which I could've done without.  Overall a bit too spicy for my liking - I don't remember that it used to be this spicy, actually.  Better than last time though, because there was actually substance.\n\nSalt cod fried rice - I liked this a lot.  It didn't feel super traditional as if I was eating it at a Chinese banquet restaurant, but I couldn't place my finger on what was missing.  I liked the addition of the sausage - lapcheong - and the flavors were good.\n\nA bit too expensive for delivery for just one person, but it beats some of the other Chinese options in the Marina for delivery.  Would I try them again?  If I had a larger delivery order, or if I went into the actual restaurant (without a wait), yes.

Overall, I'm really torn about my rating of Mission Chinese Food because they're highly inconsistent, but I really like the restaurant concept. I've ordered the same exact dishes during two different times, and the quality of the food I received varied greatly. For example, the Porky ribs. The first time I ordered them, they were juicy, with great flavor and plenty of sauce. The second time, it was dry, tasted just okay, with very little sauce. So disappointing! I also would not recommend the Eel Rolls appetizer that everyone seems to like. I thought it was really boring, bland, and not very interesting. They were also cut so large that it was almost unappetizing because you have to either break it apart or try to stuff it all in your mouth.\n\nThat being said, I've been here a couple of times because even though on the surface it seems like hipster Chinese food, a lot of flavors are actually super authentic and nostalgic to what I'm used to (I'm Chinese). For example, the Mapo Tofu is NOT the Americanized version. It's full of chili, tons of spice, delicious and also very spicy. \n\nMy favorite dishes are: the porky ribs (when consistent), the mapo tofu (again this is spicy so be prepared), salt cod fried rice (highly recommend) and Westlake Porridge (however, on the salty side).", "author": "Claudia C."}

It wasnt really pickly like kimchi or Chinese pickles.\n\nSmashed cucumbers: my mom makes something like this so I was surprised when the flavors were more oily than cool and salty.

Yummy but nothing special, felt like something I would make at home out of lazy desperate-ness haha\n\nMapo tofu: Sichuan food is one of my favorites so this was something I wanted to try here. It wasn't anything unique or different, I was kind of confused since it was like a less interesting version of normal mapo tofu... I love spice but this tasted just like heavy peppercorn.\n\nThrice cooked bacon: BEST THING, came with tteok rice cakes and super yummy bacon. The bacon fat was soaked by the rice cakes.

We went on a Saturday afternoon half expecting it to be packed because of the reputation, but our large party was able to be seated fairly easily. YMMV on this front. \n\nBack to that limited menu--the thought is that your table will order several items and just share them family style. Our group was a bunch of couples and chose to just split items amongst ourselves. My wife and I ordered the pork belly, the salt cod fried rice and the chicken wings. All delivered\n\nThe standout for me was the chicken wings. Not sure what kind of voodoo flavor this was--it was spicy but not overwhelming, richly flavorful and for eleven bucks, plenty. Highly recommend these.\n\nThe pork belly was a favorite among the others in my party and it was really quite good--pork belly is always good because it is pork belly. Definitely wouldn't be put off by some of the fusion elements of the menu. The flavors work and you are unlikely to be disappointed. The staff is super-friendly and engaging and will make sure you know what you should order.\n\nLastly, the music? Yes, yes, yes!

Maybe I was too late to jump on the bandwagon and try you. But boy did you disappoint! I understand why Michael Bauer's review said you're missing the mark.\n\nOn a lazy day back in early April when I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat, I decided to cough up the $6 and pay for delivery from Mission Chinese. With the cost and time of getting to the Mission, finding parking and waiting for a table, I thought $6 wasn't a bad tradeoff. Now I'm wishing I didn't waste the money. Delivery time wasn't too bad. Too bad I couldn't say that about the food!\n\nMongolian long beans ($11) - Xinjiang spices, horseradish, chili oil. The only dish I actually like! At first they tasted kind of sweet. But I realized that was due to a burnt dish I had prior to taking a bite of this. After a few bites, I could taste the subtle spiciness of the long beans. Yum!\n\nWestlake rice porridge ($12) - Chopped beef, dungeness crab, sawtooth herb, egg. So oily! And the egg just seemed so misplaced. It was like a soft boiled egg that you bumped into halfway through the dish. It just made the dish that much heavier since the porridge had much oil in it.\n\nSalt cod fried rice ($12) - Mackerel confit, chinese sausage, lettuce and egg. I don't get it! Why was this on the 7x7 list?! It was completely tasteless! I wanted the salty savory goodness I was expecting from the description. Instead I got bland fried rice! \n\nSpicy beef chow mein ($15) - Seared hanger steak, Shanghai noodles, spicy miso, bell pepper, pickled mustard green, mung bean sprouts, fried shallot. From the description, I thought I'd like this the most. That's why I was willing to shell out $15 for beef chow mein! Instead I got burnt meat and noodles. Since only the meat had a strong burnt taste, I thought maybe eating just the noodles would be ok. Nope! The burnt flavor permeated through the whole dish! Such a bummer! \n\nTea smoked eel ($9.50) - Fresh rice noodle, chinese celery, salted plum hoisin, braised pork, cognac soy. The flavors in this dish did not come together at all! The eel was dry. The celery overpowered the taste of the eel and pork. The hoisin sauce and the cognac sauce did not blend well together. I felt like all the ingredients were fighting each other in a taste test instead of working together to made one nice dish.\n\nTo sum it up, I'm glad I finally checked Mission Chinese off my list. And I didn't have to go all the way to the Mission to do it. But what a waste of money! If Mission Chinese really was as great as I've read in past reviews, it really is just a shadow of it's former self.", "author": "Elena N."}

There's no proper name on the outside, just the old signage in Chinese characters of what the previous restaurant used to be. The inside is plain, with classic Chinese wall decor - men on horseback prancing in a uniform line, faces painted flat and facing forward like cats detecting a thump.

I rounded up 8 close friends who are as down to devour whatever lands in front of them as I am, and we set off on our \"Mission\" to the Mission to try out this spot.\n\nWe arrived to find a line outside the red glowing doorway, and we could just barely make out the sounds of the EDM/Dance/Trance soundtrack playing inside. The smells coming from inside were so ta filling, and my excitement grew with each sweep of the breeze that carried new aromas right to my nostrils. I couldn't wait for our new to be called, and just as I started to wonder when we'd get in, our table was called! \n\nId finally made it and I felt like I was entering hallowed ground as I passed through the doorway into the warm, dark and humid dining room, illuminated by glowing red lights and guarded by a giant golden Chinese dragon overhead. At first I was bothered by the temperature, wondering if id be able to enjoy my meal, but that quickly faded as I began to peruse the menu. The dishes here are like nothing you've seen before, bringing together traditional Chinese ingredients in some very inspired and non-traditional ways. \n\nAs a crew that likes to eat and drink, we had about 12-14 dishes on the table for the 9 diners, and by the end of it all, the carnage was something to behold. We ordered the Mongolian Long beans, stir fried with dried Asian chiles, Serrano chiles and chile paste, the Tiki Pork Belly exterior crisped to perfection and complimented by the unctuous and meaty interior and sweet sauce, 3X Bacon with Rice Cakes and Bitter Melon, Tiger Salad, Squid Ink Noodles, Cod Fried Rice, Sour Chili Chicken, Explosively spicy wings and more!\n\nMy favorite bit was the 3X Bacon, thin slices of lightly smoked pork belly served with chewy Chinese rice cakes and thinly sliced bitter melon, was an incredible bite of food. The bacon was thin but meaty with a light charcoal/hardwood smoked flavor that played really well with the bitterness of the bitter melon and spicy/savory/salty sauce and the rice cake added the perfect texture. I couldn't stop eating this combo throughout the meal. \n\nThe surprise of the night was the Tiger Salad. Described as simple and light by our server, this dish arrived and had us all confused. On a long plate stood three bundles of lightly dressed fresh herbs, ties together by wide pieces of chow fun rice noodles. They were roughly 3-4\" tall! The freshness of the salad was the perfect contrast to the rich and spicy dishes on the table, and I would suggest this as something anyone who comes should order.\n\nThe star of the night was the squid ink noodles, which are served with cumin spiced and charred lamb, harissa, a few fresh greens and a tangy yogurt sauce. As with a lot of Asian food, texture is important and the noodles added that beautifully. The ground lamb was delicate and delicious, providing a warm spice from the cumin, which combined nicely with a light heat from the Harissa. The surprise ingredient was the yogurt sauce, which rounded out and carried all of the flavors across your palate, bringing you back for more.  These are clearly freshly made noodles, and taking this to go would ruin their perfectly chewy texture, which is why it's only available dine in, and well worth waiting for!\n\nBite after bite of this spicy fare had me mopping my brow and downing glass after glass of reasonably priced, moderately cold, sake, which in turn had me focused on the next bite and forgetting about the warmth in the room. We passed dishes for what seemed like an enjoyable eternity, and when we examined our efforts, we all sat back satiated and smiling knowing Mission Chinese has left us much more to explore in a future visit. Tingly lamb face noodle soup, Kung Pao Pastrami, and so much more!\n\nOn a scale of one to hype, this place is all that and a bag of fried wontons! I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Michael T."}

It was wonderful. \n\nWalked over to the restaurant and almost walked past because of the signage, or lack thereof. My eagle-eyed wife found it, and I was a little hesitant to go inside since it looked like a run-down Chinese-American restaurant. There are times for that, but I was in the mood for something different. I was knocked off my seat, but scrambled back up to continue eating. \n\nThe servers were friendly and quick, so me, my wife and daughter were seated pretty quickly. As a line quickly grew outside, I can see how they stay organized: if they aren't, they are deep in the weeds. \n\nWe ordered the ginger/mint tea, green beans, spring rolls, pork belly and chow mein. Usually I'd say that the pork belly would be the best thing, since, you know, pork belly is amazing. While good, it was first blown away by the spring rolls. They were a wonderful concoction of crunchy and soft. Then the green beans came out and were pleasantly spicy, crunchy andy heavily fought over. If my wife and I renew vows, that is going in there.

There's always a line around dinner time, but thankfully, it moves pretty quickly.  Once inside, your senses will become intoxicated with piquant white pepper and hot chili aromas, as your eyes adjust to the dim lighting from a sinuous paper dragon overhead, dotted with red and purple orbs on its side.\n\nAs you sit down, you grab some menus and peruse the options.  Oh, cool, this menu has more items than what was listed on the door!  At your side, your friend pouts, \"Why does my spoon have food in it?\"  Well, that doesn't bode well.  Our waitress casually replies, \"Oh, your spoon has food in it? Heh. Heh,\" as she whisked the spoon away to replace it with a fresh one.  That was easy.  \n\nWe ordered the Westlake porridge, squid ink noodles, thrice cooked bacon and rice cakes, and grandma's pork dumplings.  All dishes were tasty, although not in the traditional sense.  Hipster Chinese food is nothing but traditional, after all!  Our winning dishes were probably the porridge and the squid ink noodles.  The former because of the savory scallion, Dungeness crab, and flavor of home-cooked porridge consistency, and the squid ink noodles for its unique black and chewy noodles with greens on top.\n\nWhile tasty, we came away feeling unsatisfied that we didn't have THE dish that carried the flavor that matched the lovely piquant aroma that greeted us when we first walked through the door.  Where art thou, l'eau de M.C.?  Our best guess was that we should have ordered that salted cod fried rice dish...but we're not certain.\n\nAll in all, a great place for a quick bite to eat, but none of the dishes we had really stood out.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I'd be curious to try the salted cod fried rice if some friends wanted to try it out :)", "author": "Brittany N."}

The four of us went in on a few dishes family style, which is probably the way to go. Vegan Dan Dan Noodles, Vegan Ma Po Tofu, Szechuan Long Beans. and Garlic Fried Chicken would have definitely been enough for the mix of our vegan / omnivore posse.\n\nHowever, our server never brought us rice after we asked for some or checked on us until after we had already finished, which made eating the ma po tofu very difficult, as it has a very assertive flavor (a lot of star anise going on). While the vibe of the place is interesting, the service was poor (did not bring us rice after they asked us for some), and the food didn't make up for it. All of it was very salty and it felt like an unbalanced meal, overall. \n\nI would skip it.", "author": "Nathan T."}

We decided to walk around and we stumbled upon this restaurant. Seeing that the wait list was short, i wrote my name on the clipboard outside and waited approximately 5 minutes. I'm grateful that they allowed my small pet inside (unless they didn't see him as he's quite small).\n\nWe were seated in a communal table which means that we were seated in a long table with other strangers.\n\nThe bathroom was awkward to get to because you have to go through the kitchen while the workers were working.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small. I would estimate that it's about 60 feet long and 25 feet wide with about 16 tables. The lighting was dark, mostly red which hurt my eyes. The music playing was loud also which made it harder for me and my friend to communicate. The table I was seated at didn't have the basic condiments of salt and pepper along with soy sauce.\n\nFOOD:\nMost of their entrees were more than $10-15. The menu was small for a Chinese restaurant and depending on what you get, rice doesn't come with your entree. I ordered the sour chicken and it was amazing! If you love chicken I highly recommend it. For $13, the food I got didn't fill me up which is unusual for a Chinese restaurant. Also their servings are small.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nThey seemed busy and weren't given drinks for about 15 minutes. The water came in warm along with a jar of water and it seemed like they had jars of water just waiting to be given at tables. Not once did the waiter come and see if we were doing okay. \n\nWill I come back? Most likely not but I'm intrigued to try some more of their food!

We made a reservation for 7:45, which meant someone put our name on the list for us. This saved us a lot of time, even though we still waited till about 8 pm for a table. \n\nWe definitely ordered too much food! We looked at the prices and figured that since they were so reasonable they must be small portions. So wrong! We ordered four dishes - the 3x cooked bacon, the pastrami, the cherry cola ribs, and the squid ink noodles. All were really good! The pastrami was probably my least favorite of the bunch. It was good, but the others were so remarkable that the pastrami just didn't hold up next to them. The ribs were so tender and the sauce was sticky and sweet - perfect! As everyone says, the 3x bacon is not to be missed, but its not because of the bacon, its because of the rice dumplings/patties that accompany it. They are chewy pillows of heaven. Sort of like gnocchi? I also really enjoyed the squid ink noodles with lamb, which had more of a middle eastern flavor set. \n\nSo, ordering four dishes between two people gave us enough leftovers for dinners the next two nights.

You hold a dear place in my heart, especially because I had you for the first time after my first half marathon. I was tired, hungry and you saved my starved body. \n\nSince then, I've come back 4-5x. Reason? They're probably the most decent place to get real Sichuan food in SF, as far as I know. The restaurant is clean, food is quality (although sometimes greasy and salty), service is good and the beer selection pairs well with Sichuan food. A lot of the food, however, are too greasy and salty for me sometimes. They use a lot of Sichuan peppercorns and chili flakes and chili oil, sometimes to a point where it is overbearing and makes everything tastes the same. That being said, it becomes important that you know what to order to have a well balanced meal and experience here.\n\nMy suggestion is to order 2 spicy dishes and 2 mild dishes. By mild, I mean that it won't kill your taste buds. My favorite spicier dishes are the Mapo tofu, Mouth Watering (Chong ching) Chicken, Thrice cooked bacon, string beans. My favorite mild dishes are: Egg Egg Noodle (Dan dan noodles with poached egg), Cumin Lamb Ribs (definitely flavorful but not spicy), Salt Cod Fried Rice. \n\nKeep your meal balanced and pair it with a nice white, crisp beer/wine, you'll survive, and leave happy. That being said, this place doesn't not joke around with their sichuan food. It's going to be numbing, but delicious, if you know what I mean.

Again, I just don't get it.\n\nWe started with salad wrapped in rice noodle and it was a nice light, refreshing way to start the meal. The herbs had good flavor and the ginger sauce was a nice touch too. Then we moved onto the thrice cooked bacon which is just oily pork slices stir fried with rice cakes and a ton of spices. Yeah...it sounds good in theory but I really couldn't get any subtlety of flavor when my tastes buds are blown out with spice, oil and fat. Really hard to pick out an intricacies of the dish. We finished with the spicy beef chow mein which again, is just oily chow mein. The mustard greens on top were a nice touch but not enough to deem this anything more than another bowl of chow mein.\n\nI'll end this review with some insight.

Based on her recommendations, we all shared the pork belly, long beans, salt cod fried rice (combining two of my favorite Portuguese foods -- shout out to southern Massachusetts!), chow mein, and pickles. A couple of us in the group were fairly picky eaters and despite that, the food was gone faster than a sorority girl from my bed when her mom unexpectedly shows up on campus early Saturday morning (that happens, right?)\n\nThe best dish by FAR was the Westlake Rice Porridge.

But if you show up with an open mind and tummy, prepare to be impressed.\n\nTwo people with normal appetites could easily split an entree or two, but since we were on vacay and don't often eat gourmet food such as this, we opted for three plates of food: Salted cod fried rice, egg egg noodles as well as spicy Mongolian long beans. Surprisingly, my favorite dish was by far the beans. They were pretty damn spicy, but not a \"oh shit, I'm going to have indigestion later\", more of a \"my mouth is slightly numb from the burn, but I can't stop eating\" feeling. I liked it. Second favorite was the noodle dish, minus the pile of jalape\u00f1os on top - an easy fix. Rice was also excellent (kudos to that butter flavor!), would order any of these again in a heartbeat. \n\nSince it was Friday, after 12 pm, and we were not at work, beer and sake were definitely in order. Helped to cool our burning tongues. And of course we couldn't eat everything, so it was boxed up and properly handed off to a homeless person down the street.

As surely everybody knows by now, Mission Chinese is in a completely unassuming storefront that looks like a crap Chinese takeout joint, but is in fact an awesome, casual, incredibly creative restaurant that should not be missed!  \n\nWe had no problems getting a table for Friday lunch, and between four of us shared the Chongqing chicken wings, the Mongolian Long Beans, Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice Cakes, and Broccoli Beef Brisket, with some steamed rice.  I am drooling just remembering this meal.\n\nOkay first up - chicken wings. We were warned that Szechuan spice is different than spicy food we may be used to - it sort of numbs your mouth more than overtly burns it.  This is totally true, and these chicken wings will definitely do that to you.  They were dry-fried, which my husband loved, as he is a chicken wing aficionado and sometimes gets tired of the ones soaking in sauce.  Crispy, piping hot, and numbingly spicy as previously mentioned, these were a hit for my husband, and I liked them, but not as much as he did.  I loved the texture, maybe the numbing was too much for me?  I don't know.  They're worth a try, though.\n\nEverything else, however, was perfection.  The broccoli beef brisket isn't spicy at all, and isn't in the same league as any \"beef with broccoli\" you've had at a Chinese restaurant.  The brisket tasted right out of a Jewish grandmother's kitchen, and the dish was full of leafy, rich-green Chinese broccoli, not regular broccoli.  Smoky, hearty, with tender meat and yet somehow seeming healthy-ish from the abundance of veg, it was a great dish.  The bacon and rice cakes may have been my favorite - this unusual dish features chewy Chinese rice cakes, sort of shaped like UFOs.  They are addictive, glutinous little discs of yumminess, and they were drenched in savory sauce and surrounded by crispy, hearty pieces of thick bacon.  YUM.  The long beans were perfectly cooked, boldly flavored with chili oil and horseradish, and a great companion to the rest of the meal.\n\nWe talked about the meal the rest of the day, my husband saying it was the best Chinese food he's ever had, and I think I must agree.  I'm only sad we didn't have room to try the other dishes, because everything on the menu sounded truly delicious!  And $58 for 4 people to be completely full of delicious food ain't bad at all!", "author": "Meredith A."}

Yes, it has some of the elements of what we know as Chinese food - but for the most part it's way different. Almost an experimental Chinese - and I love that! \n\nWhen you walk in, it's one of those hipster places that doesn't really have a sign. This reminds me of Ludo's place in LA - they both have the same thing going on with the old sign of the previous business above the door. The Mission district definitely reminds me of DTLA. A bit grungy and up and coming and definitely a bit hipster. \n\nThe inside is pretty dark. There is a gigantic paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dragon above all the tables by the ceiling and the tables aren't much. There isn't salt on the tables - just a shaker of MSG. Hipster. I kinda want to say this place looks a little dirty - but it could just be dark.\n\nNow for the food:\n\nTea Smoked Eel Rolls - I'm not a huge eel fan but I can tell this was cooked well - and I actually picked the eel meat out of the roll - my only gripe was the skin was a little flabby for my taste. The eel here was way better than the eel I had at Jose Andres' Bazaar in LA and you could really taste the tea. Not a bad dish at all! And definitely the best tasting eel that I've had.  \n\nSour Chili Chicken - Oh my god! I do not have words for how much I loved this dish! This dish almost seems to have a basis in the more traditional black bean chicken dish - as those beans were still in the dish but there were so many other flavors. I LOVE romanesco! And this was cooked to perfection! It was so good - I was literally picking them out of the dish - and I'm not the type of girl who's typically picking veggies out of my plate and gobbling them up - but they were amazing! I also loved that pickled Serrano chili pieces. The mixture of the pickled taste and the heat - absolutely amazing! Loved Loved Loved! \n\nCumin Lamb Ribs - this was Pump's dish and he said he liked it but they needed a little salt but they were definitely very cumin-y! They looked a little on the dry side and I think they needed a little sauce but they were nice and fatty according to him.\n\nWestlake Rice Porridge- this was my first time having anything like this. I liked it - although I wasn't as obsessed with it as I was with my chili chicken dish! It was what it sounds like - a thick rice porridge - with bits of crab and bbq slow cooked pork. That to me, was a little off putting and I could have done without the smokey pork flavor - but Pumpkie liked it - so to each its own. You'll have to try it for yourself to see how you feel about it! \n\nOverall, it was an amazing meal. That sour chili chicken is to die for! And... Bi-Rite is around the corner so you can go get some ice cream after your meal!", "author": "Sam L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-08-03", "description": "This has been on my list for the longest time, even before they turned into Lung Shan full time. So imagine the disappointment that consumed me after my first bite. This place is over-hyped and EXTREMELY OVER PRICED. My points of reference/comparison: I grew up eating home-cooked chinese food, dined in many of the chinese restaurants in SF Chinatown, Richmond, Sunset, and have resided in, and traveled throughout, China during college. \n\nThe ambiance/atmosphere. Imagine a hodgepodge of stereotypical Chinese decor (the dragon, the communist-era poster, the paintings of horses), dim/non-existent lighting except for a single eerie red bulb along with a string of Christmas icicle lights, in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant-esque Chinese restaurant, with 90s club/psychedelic music bumping in the background, staffed by hipster wait staff who speak perfect English. Oh and by the way, if you are unfortunate enough to be seated in one of the middle tables, be prepared to rub elbows and eavesdrop on your fellow diners. In summation, the environment was repulsive and offensive. \n\nThe food:\n\n1) pork belly (aka: hong shao rou): i don't understand why there was chinese new year coconut shaving on top of the two fatty piece of pork. and I really dont understand why there was a half slice of pineapple and a cocktail umbrella. The pork was extremely fatty, even for the belly cut, and it was overpoweringly salty. \n\n2) salt cod fried rice: if you are gonna advertise it as salt cod, please actually have salt cod. aside from that, I have no other complaints about this dish, it was done a-okay, but I have had way better chinese sausage/egg fried rice for a fraction of the price.  \n\n3) thrice cooked bacon with rice cake: let me re-name the dish for you, it should actually be called \"rice cake with a few small piece of bacon.\" This dish unnecessarily spicy, why? The \"bacon\" (aka lap yook) is a cantonese (southern) dish, and you will rarely (if ever) fine spicy food in canton. The entire dish consisted of stir fried rice cake (which is a Northern Chinese dish), interspersed here and there with a few small piece of \"bacon.\" There is a reason why there are both Northern and Southern Chinese cuisine...because the two should not mingle together! This is served with a side of exorbitant price.   \n\n4) the tea-eel wrap: this one gets points for creativity in concept, but it gets negative points for execution. The rice paper and the eel, fine. But who's idea was it to stuff it with celery leafs (the parts that you typically throw out!), which gives it a) a weird texture, and b) a nasty herb-y taste. \n\nTotal bill for 2 people with tips: 50 dollars. \n\nFYI: you can find the same (if not better caliper food) at almost any Chinese restaurant. just because you do not see fancy schamcy english names like \"thrice cooked bacon\" and \"salt cod fried rice\" does not mean they dont have it. Do yourself a favor, bring a friend who speaks/reads the language and have them order, you will realize that Chinese restaurants that charge a fair/cheap price serve more than coconut shrimp and kung pao chicken.", "author": "Long C."}

Oh great, either have I! *high five* Well, if you ever want to experience it, this is probably the only place I can think of. \n\nOnce you walk in, you won't be greeted by their waiters. Instead, you'll be greeted by deafeningly loud retro hip hop and R&B music, a barely lit room (so watch your steps), and close quarters that are small enough to induce claustrophobia (if you don't have it already). And on top of that, if you're planning to enjoy your dinner with some privacy, you can throw that out the door if you're visiting on a weekend. You're more likely to be seated at a 'co-op' table (unless you're willing to endure the long wait).\n\nYou may be thinking...what the eff is a 'co-op' table?! Great question! It's one big, rectangular table where a bunch of random people are seated next to each other. Sounds like fun, right? Oh, but watch out...some neighbors can get pretty friendly. One of our neighbors had no qualms about chiming into our conversation and another neighbor used a generous amount of our hand sanitizer before proceeding to share that amongst his group of friends. I suppose it's one step better than having frisky neighbors, but not by much.\n\nOn top of that, there was a dissonance between their 'hip' Asian decor and their ambiance. If you can see in this dark room, you'll notice that among the Chinese paintings displaying on the walls, there are also dimly lit, red-glowing lanterns hanging from one side of the room to another. All the while loud and fast beating music is blasting in the background. I guess it's a plus if you wanted to take a picture for your IG using a red lantern filter. Go ahead and use that #nofilter shamelessly! You know you want to! (;\n\nWithout further ado, the main course(s)...\n\n+Forbidden Fried Rice: When using the word 'forbidden' to describe a dish it better be so darn good that it's a sin to take one bite out of it. Sadly, this lackluster dish wasn't it...far from it. Not only did it lack the typical nutty flavor (in fact, it probably lacked all flavors), but it also lacked the chewy texture. Though it complemented our entr\u00e9es, it definitely was not mouthwatering foodgasmic.\n\n+Dan Dan Noodles (aka Egg Noodles): I had such high hopes for this dish, but, alas, it just didn't hit the spot. Don't let the vibrant colors and the delicious smell of these noodles deceive you. Once you begin mixing the noodles, you'll uncover the fresh smell of ginger. But, be careful when taking a bite out of those noodles because...little did you know, these saucy noodles are jam-packed with ginger flavors! So much so that the first bite felt like a punch in my throat...it BURNED so badly! Definitely took some getting used to. But, even then, it just wasn't my cup of tea. The ginger taste was so overwhelming that I couldn't taste anything else. If you really like ginger, this just might be for you! Otherwise, it'll just seem like they drenched these noodles in a jar filled with ginger sauce.\n\nBefore we even finished our meals, our waiter began circling around us, indicating it was time to go. The food left such a bad aftertaste in my mouth (literally!) that we didn't mind. Definitely not worth the price...over-priced and over-hyped. This place isn't to die for, but it also wasn't the worst thing ever. Just don't come with high hopes and expectations.

Born in Korea, then adopted by a family in Oklahoma, Bowien was already an adult living in San Francisco when he decided to learn how to cook Szechuanese fare, known for its bold, pungent, spicy flavors.\n\nBurned out from working in fine dining establishments, Bowien considered applying to work in a Szechuanese restaurant as a line cook. But since he couldn't speak Chinese, he realized he would have a hard time. Plus, many of the restaurant owners he approached viewed him with suspicion. \"They thought I was crazy,\" Bowien tells Fresh Air's Sam Briger. \"They thought I was trying to steal recipes.\"\n\nUltimately, Bowien wound up teaching himself how to cook Chinese food. Later, he opened the first Mission Chinese Food -- a pop-up restaurant with a punk rock, DIY attitude. Located inside an existing Chinese restaurant in San Francisco's Mission District, it was a hole-in-the-wall takeout joint that drew long lines and rave reviews: Both Bon Appetit and GQ magazines named it one of the best new restaurants of 2001.\n\nLooking back at his efforts to master his own brand of Chinese cooking, Bowien says, \"It [was] audacious, but at the same time, the whole feeling behind what we were doing just felt very organic, and for me there was no risk.\"\n\nBowien took that audacious attitude with him when he opened the first Mission Chinese in New York City in a tiny space in the Lower East Side. It, too, earned accolades -- one reviewer said Bowien did to Chinese food what Led Zeppelin had done to the blues.\n\nBut it broke too many rules: In 2013, the New York restaurant was shut down for various violations. Bowien describes it as a devastating blow. But, he recovered. Indeed, later that same year, the James Beard Foundation bestowed Bowien with its prestigious Rising Star Chef award. And last year, Bowien re-opened Mission Chinese Food in a new New York location.\n\nBowien is now the co-author, with Chris Ying, of The Mission Chinese Food Cookbook. Highlights from his Fresh Air interview are below.\n\n\n\nOn how the original Mission Chinese Food started in San Francisco \n\nIt was just a pop-up inside of Lung Shan, and then it slowly took over, over time. You could order off two menus -- I loved that about it -- but the problem was that we'd be running our menu alongside their menu, and their chef was responsible for cooking 154 dishes off their takeout menu, just one guy on this little station. If they got really busy for delivery, which they would, and someone ordered something from their menu, I didn't know how to make their food. ...\n\nThen eventually, I think they saw Mission Chinese Food, which was becoming very popular, and we were running out of storage space for two full-sized menus. So they actually were the ones that said, \"Look, we're just going to change it and you guys just do everything, and our chef will work for you and we'll make your food. Just show them how to do it.\"\n\nOn opening a Mission Chinese Food in New York that closed - despite its many accolades - because of structural issues and a sanitary violation \n\nIn retrospect, should we have [had] a structural engineer go through the building with us and everything else? Yeah, probably. We just let our emotions get the best of us. We felt an energy in that space when we walked through it. ... It wasn't legally supposed to even be a restaurant. ... The basement wasn't even legally zoned to be used for any sort of kitchen prep or preparation at all, it was supposed to be a cellar. We opened the restaurant three months after we moved here. ... We didn't do any major construction, nothing structural, we just opened. ...", "author": "Didi F."}

We ordered the sliced peanut noodles, rolls, a bean dish and a zillion other options that my food coma'd mind can't recall. The amount of water that accompanied this meal speaks for the sinus clearing experience that it was. The Thrice Cooked Bacon entree was definitely my favorite by far with rice cakes, tofu skin and chili oil. \n\nThe food wasn't the only thing that made this place five stars in my book - the atmosphere - red lighting, semi dirty strip club-esque feel with a giant paper dragon spanned across the ceiling. In some spots there was barely enough room for the waiters to wedge between tables. But the cherry on top as far as atmosphere goes, is definitely the bathroom setup. You walk through the kitchen and into the overflow space that is used for recycling, storage and is open to the outdoors. This would probably gross out most folks, but for me it adds an extra layer of charm.", "author": "Brittany S."}

I was hoping to leave my first 5 star review. This is not the case. I have to preface this review with the fact that I have been a fan of Danny Bowien for the last few years, cooking many of his recipes from the Mission Chinese Food Cookbook at home, so I was  super eager to try this place. Maybe it was a case of building something up too much in my head, but I was underwhelmed. We ordered the vinegar peanuts, lamb dumplings, chicken wings, pork belly, kung pao pastrami and the mapo tofu. The peanuts were a nice snack, the lamb dumplings mostly forgettable. The chicken wings were tasty, though not as spicy as I had hoped. The tiki pork belly was good, but the portion seemed a little small.  I enjoyed the kung pao as well as the mapo, but it was on par with what I have cooked at home from the cookbook.\n    All in all, it was good for what it was. I would eat here again. I would recommend it. I just had it built up so much in my mind, there was no way it could hold up. I guess this is how Guy Fieri's fans feel after eating at one of his establishments.

I first heard about the restaurant while reading an article in GQ by Alan Richman (I got a free subscription, ok?). Then, I read an online article about them in the NY Times. I also saw that Jessica Alba dined here via her Instagram photos. \n\nI tried going one other time, but the wait time was over an hour. No matter how long the wait, I was determined to eat here this time. Luckily, there were seats available. The food came out quickly. The two dishes smelled great. I barely ate all day, but I didn't realize how hungry I was until I scarfed everything down. That and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. \n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice- mackerel confit, Chinese sausage, lettuce, egg \nI can't live without rice and now I can't live without their fried rice. I'm exaggerating, but I don't remember the last time I was this satisfied eating fried rice.\n\nStir-Fried Pork Jowl (cheeks) and Radishes- fermented black bean, mint, red perilla (mint family)\nThe radishes were quartered and served with their green leaves attached. I never had them like this. They were firm with a bit of a bite to them. The pork jowls were fat and tender.\n\nIt's a hole in the wall, so don't expect much of the surroundings. Don't even expect your chopsticks to match- my friend had two different length chopsticks. Something that bothered me were the fake flowers that were sitting at our table and had a layer of dust on them. Might as well get rid of them if they're not going to be dusted. The other thing is you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. At least you walk through the dishwashing side and not the cooking side.\n\nI rarely bookmark Chinese restaurants, but this was an exception. Mission accomplished!", "author": "Helen H."}

Even though there was a line, we took a leap of faith and put our name on the list. We went down the street to Boba Guys, came back, waited a bit more and got seated. We weren't in a rush, so we didn't mind the wait.\n\nAMBIANCE/SERVICE:\nAt night, it's dimly lit with red lights. All the food was hued in that red and if you asked me what my food looked like, I probably couldn't tell you. HAHA. It's a very hipster vibe with a hipster/yupster clientele. Our server was not as pleasant as we would hope, but the food service was quick.\n\nFOOD:\nDefinitely came into this with some hesitations since I have this idea of what \"chinese food\" is. But you really just have to come into this with an open mind and know that it's a different, modern take. I can see the less traditional, fusion elements and the influences from other cuisines melded in. Which created some confusion for my palette, but was still weirdly interesting. We got the following:\n\n*Tiki Pork Belly: SOLID! Two hearty portions that were tender and THAT SAUCE. I loved it, sweet and complimentary to the saltiness of the pork. I wanted to slather it on the pork and rice. \n\n*Cherry Glazed Porky Ribs: For me, wasn't a highlight of the meal, but a very big portion for just two people to share. \n\n*Squid Ink Noodles: This was one of the memorable dishes for me. I love noodles so this was a cool take, taste wise and visually. There's this yogurt sauce that feels very mediterranean and then the meat tasted reminiscent of chorizo, so it felt Spanish. Weird combination, but tasted well together. \n\nWeirdly intrigued and curious about the other dishes, so I'm inclined for another visit. All in all, a solid experience. But in true hipster style, I'll just shrug my shoulders and say, \"it's aight.\" Haha.", "author": "Vincent L."}

It's also important to note that MCF is kind of a stickler on reservations - they don't seat you unless your entire party is there, which is a pain.\n\nOnto the food:\n1) Salt Cod Fried Rice\nMeh dish. It didn't taste bad, but you could literally have this dish at any Chinese restaurant. It wasn't bad, but it was just really pedestrian. \n\n2) Tea Soaked Eel Roll\nI actually really enjoyed this dish. The eel had a smoky flavor and was well complemented by the vegetable and the soft texture of the rice roll. It definitely was not Chinese, but was yummy all the same.\n\n3) Tiger Salad\nAn interesting take on the tiger salad - they wrapped the salad up in a rice roll which made it a little tricky to eat. Still, it was flavorful, but definitely not a must get dish.\n\n4) Sizzling Cumin Lamb\nThis was really not good at all. I would not recommend it. The lamb was overcooked and had a gamey taste and not much flavor at all. The vegetables that came with it were soggy and really salty. \n\n5) Lamb Faced Noodles (?)\nI was so disappointed when I got this dish because I was under the impression that this was a \"biang biang mian\" dish, but it wasn't. Although the noodles were underwhelming - soggy and soft - the soup base was really quite delicious. The numbing spices sent tingles down my tongue and was actually really addictive. The lamb was a little overcooked though, so it was an interesting dish, but definitely not a must have.\n\nOverall, the food at MCF was enjoyable, but very forgettable.

But seriously, I've never seen more non-Asians eating at a Chinese place than here at Mission Chinese Food. It was so unexpected that my friend and I (both Chinese) felt strangely out of place. Haha.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty run-down. The decor is dated. The tables and chairs have seen better days. Not only that, the restaurant is so small! We got seated at the awkward nook by the front window. The space was so tight that I had to climb onto my chair to sit down.\n\nAs for the food itself, it was definitely a twist on traditional Chinese. I would describe the food selection as standard Chinese dishes with the incorporation of non-traditional ingredients. \n\n2012: 7x7 #1\nSalt Cod Fried Rice. $10. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sW7WYYrHEvR8yEYxautAgQ?select=BWPN1e3Cg3W1Mpm6VXsnwA#BWPN1e3Cg3W1Mpm6VXsnwA): As someone who grew up eating salted fish fried rice, the one at MCF was underwhelming. The amount of scallion was ridiculous but barely any salt cod and Chinese sausage. The dish was greatly missing the salt cod flavor. At least it was filling. \n\nThrice Cooked Bacon. $11. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sW7WYYrHEvR8yEYxautAgQ?select=BWPN1e3Cg3W1Mpm6VXsnwA#9Mnk_4oEuFA21sfAyO_eLg): My friend and I imagined the thrice cooked bacon to be the traditional thick pieces of pork slow cooked and then stir-fried with rice cake. When the dish came out, we saw that it was literally bacon. How and why would you need to cook thin slices of bacon three times? The bacon just added some salt and grease and nothing else. \n\nWe also ordered this dish based on its use of bitter melon, which we both enjoy. There was one piece in the entire dish. We told our server, who then made a comment about people not usually liking bitter melon. Hmmm okay. Well, we like them. The chef ended up cooking us some bitter melon, except they were simply stir-fried in oil. For those who are unfamiliar with cooking bitter melon, seasoning and a soften texture are needed to reduce the bitterness. Our extra bitter melon was al-dente and extremely bitter.      \n\nFusionness aside, I just don't care for a restaurant that skimps on ingredients. Prices are high. The wait is long.

The three inch square chunks of pork are crispy on top with a melting layer of fat that melds into a middle layer of firm meat.

A large egg yolk resides atop and in the middle of the heap of noodles to be enjoyed as it cooks itself into the broth. A healthy dose of hoisin sauce is poured to the side to provide a base for all of these ingredients to come together. Simply outstanding. \n\nThe Sichuan pickles ($4) are a variation of kimchi and offer a fiery but palate cleansing dish throughout the meal. Served with giant roasted peanuts and pepper flakes, an unusual variation of an Asian staple. \n\nThe Kung pao pastrami ($12) is a classic stir fry dish in that it is a pile of pastrami and vegetables on a plate. However, the thick pieces of salty pastrami easily extract the sweet celery and red pepper from the pile. Peanuts sprinkled atop provide a little crunch. \n\nThe combination fried rice ($15) is light on oil, heavy on fresh vegetables - cilantro, onion, red pepper, scallions - light pork and a size able dollop of crab meat atop.

An innovative and creative menu makes this place an exemplar of successful experimentation with old and new ingredients. \n\n\nMission Chinese Food, why must you confuse a longing pilgrim, (at the end of a longish drive from Marin) by putting up \"Lung Shan Restaurant\" on your store-front?  This attempt at subterfuge will simply not work! It was at best only  a fleeting and temporary annoyance, like a pebble in my shoe. I burst forth into the temple and (after waiting a minute for the hipster waiter outside to finish his smoke break) was whisked away (rather languidly) to my table. I kept thinking \"faster damn you!\" and \"can we fast forward through the formalities and get down to business?\" But alas, social constructs (civility, courtesy) have a powerful hold on us and so I had to endure the ritual of waiting for my beverage to arrive before placing an order.\nBut when the opportunity came I pounced- a baby dragon bursting forth from its crib with flames and froth emanating from the sides of its mouth.\n\nAfter feigning uncertainty (I had of course studied the menu to the point that I could see it with my eyes closed as I lay in bed the previous night), I ordered the following:\n\nTea-smoked eel rolls and Grandma's pork dumplings to further wet an already drenched appetite.\n\nSour chili chicken, because I was feeling silly and I really like shishito peppers. Yeah, anyway.\n\nReflections and Musings:\n\nThe Tea-smoked eel rolls were like a pagoda but instead of roof over roof there was layer upon layer of texture and taste. I had to go back to the menu to decipher what it was that had perplexed my taste buds. I have to conclude that it was the salted plum hoisin sauce and cognac soy that had colluded to slay the picky beast that lurks in my palate. I was conquered without a shot. All it took was one bite.  \n\nGrandma's pork dumplings were served in a bowl with ham broth. The dumplings weren't floating so much as just soaking a little, the way you would dangle your feet into a swimming pool while keeping the rest of your body out of the water. These little jewels had been steamed to perfection. Each bite was preceded by a rapidly learned behavior similar to Pavlov's dogs. You could say I was merely drooling. So much so that Pavlov would lean over and say \"keep it together man\" (through a translator of course).\n\nThe sour chili chicken took the chicken tenders of my youth and replaced that memory with something mightier and more delicious.  The malange of shishito pepper, chicken tender and little marble potatoes was a well-constructed fusion of smells and textures. The soft crunch of the aromatic peppers and the crisp exterior of bite sized potatoes that sealed a perfectly cooked interior was completed by bites of soy & chili seasoned chicken. Not too spicy but definitely flavorful. You won't start sweating or hiccupping from chili intoxication despite the little flame by the menu entry. You might giggle with joy at how good this dish tastes. \n\nMy one request (a sure sign of the looming demise of good health) is to dial down the sodium if at all possible. I know, I know, that's like asking for grandma to stop squeezing your cheeks in front of your friends. Possible but not probable.\n\nAnd a side of steamed white rice has to be ordered separately. Just so you know. Please don't whine and cause a mini scene when you get there. \n\nFood:     5\nService: 4\nFacility:  4. It's got an interesting very old world vibe.

First of all, the young lady from Haiti who helped us was incredible (wish I asked her for her name). She was very attentive and super sweet. Even spoke a little bit of Spanish for my parents. She helped guide us through the menu and the 5-6 dishes we ordered were great. The food was really tasty and we had a nice balance of meat and veggies- which is what we wanted. The environment was really cool and hip, I was a fan of the techno lights. Will def come again and recommend it. Note: this isn't your typical Chinese food, it's Def fusion, but if you're open minded to new flavors and dishes, this is a great place.", "author": "Rico H."}

Unfortunately, the quality is not there...nor is the service. \nWe had the pastrami, spicy wings, spring rolls and  nori rice. The spring rolls were very good but the pastrami was so oversalted it was almost inedible. The rice was cold and must have been left over from the prior day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-11", "description": "I hadn't planned on reviewing this place, but apparently my dining companions really wanted me to.\n\nThe six of us (my brother and his wife, my step-sister and her fiance, and my girlfriend and I - I've always been the slow one . . . ) stopped in on Saturday evening.  We were visiting from Reno, while everyone else lives in the city.  They were surprised that we were able to get in with only a five minute wait or so at 6:30 on a Saturday evening (maybe everyone was at Outside Lands?).  \n\nIn any case, for non-city folk, the space is small, and you're packed in like sardines.  There's barely walking space between the tables and seats, and you definitely need to do a little bit of weaving and dancing to navigate.  Our party of size was sat at the end of three or four tables in a line, so people were seated next to us as well.  To reach the single, co-ed bathroom, you need to go through the kitchen and out the back door to get there.\n\nThe six of us ate family style, ordering lots of items: vinegar peanuts, fresh rice noodle, cucumbers in garlic sauce, thrice cooked rice cakes, sour chili chicken, rice porridge, ribs, egg egg noodle, and probably a dish or two I missed.  The damage for our group was around $130. \n\nThe reason I was reluctant to write this review was that this was one of those meals were you have little bites and tastes, but don't really get to explore a dish.  I really liked what I was having, but many times was thinking \"man, I should have taken more of that\", but was already moving on to the next bite.  While I love sampling and grazing, I also like having a whole entree to myself to really explore and enjoy. So, take all my food thoughts with a grain of salt . . . \n\nFirst things first, I was surprised how spicy the rice cakes were - very tasty, but surprisingly spicy for a one flame item (for a menu that goes up to two flames).  If the food was served in a fancier venue than this divey space, I feel like it'd be called fusion, as the dishes feel more Chinese inspired than Chinese.  The egg, egg noodle was delicious, but I think most anything with yolk is amazing.  \n\nOn food alone, this would likely be a 3.5 star experience with the limited tastes I had.  There were tons of dishes with potential, but so hard to tell with only a bite or two.  The last star is because I love that a place like this exists - it's got character, people love it or hate it, and a group of six of us can go out and have a rad meal together, with good company and solid food.", "author": "Ernie C."}

At one point I got the genius idea that getting it to-go would make me forgo the long waits here! So my friend and I just got it and ate it at the tennis courts in dp. It was pure genius if I didn't say so myself lollll. \n\n   The food in general is not bad and does pack quite a punch especially with their spicy dishes. I'm happy to say that their spicy is reminiscent of the traditional Sichuan spice (of course still not quite as spicy). Their wings and mapo tofu were especially bomb and had that numbing spicy Taste I  loved! The Chinese call that spicy a numbing spicy because you can't really feel your tongue after! (But don't quote me on that since I'm southern Chinese lol) \n\n   I also had their green beans and westlake rice congee. I loved the green beans but the westlake rice congee was mediocre. They added too much water and the congee wasn't the right consistency that I liked. But they had some expensive stuff in there like Dungeness crab meat which was super awesome! But there should be for $14-$15 an order! If you sold it at that price in Asia no real Asians would buy it.

The hallowed Kung Pao Pastrami is basically a bunch of celery, bell peppers, peanuts, pastrami, and salt thrown together.. almost like a firesale of last night's dinner in the fridge. It didn't taste like anything remotely close to the original Kung Pao nor did it have any flavor worthy of its $13 price tag. The salt cod fried rice was acceptable, but it barely had any salted cod as well as a smidgeon of chinese sausages. \n\nAlso, I'm Chinese - and I'm saying this is NOT chinese food.

The photo I saw of the tofu looked really tasty.  When it arrived it was in a soup of oil and grease, even the plastic container it came in was oily.  Seriously, a pint of gelatinous tofu oil soup, no mushrooms (as described) and laced with grit filled, peppers, black peppers, dried red peppers and more gritty spices.  I took on bite and had to get it out of my mouth ASAP.  Really gross and disappointing to say the least.\n\nNext came the salad rolls.  I was hoping for fresh butter lettuce with a hint of herbs. The whole roll was filled with herbs and stems and the sauce was exactly the same as the Tofu (soup) dish!\n\nSteer clear from this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-30", "description": "The best way to describe the food at Mission Chinese is super greasy Chinese takeout that will light up your taste buds. It's good, but different. The flavors were bold and absolutely amazing. The restaurant itself is small and you will often find multiple parties waiting outside. I love the tacky decor that adorns the inside of Lung Shan restaurant. The ageless Christmas lights and tissue paper dragon lantern almost balances out the heavy metal music perfectly. Despite some reports of  crappy service, I found our waitress to be pleasant and helpful. \n\nWhat I liked: The salt cod fried rice was probably my favorite dish of the night. It was just a perfect marriage of greasy fried rice with that salty, briny flavor of dried cod. I also loved the thrice cooked bacon. The rice cakes were the perfect texture and the crispy bacon was fantastic. \n\nWhat I found to be mediocre: The tea-smoked eel had a nice presentation and texture, but there was nothing tea-smoked about it. \n\nWhat I though flopped: The ma po tofu was a slimy, spicy mess. They were stingy on the pork shoulder and everything else just tasted of chili paste.  The beef cheek \"a l'orange\" was a crispier version of Panda's orange chicken, except you couldn't taste the beef cheek. It was thoroughly fried, but lathered in the orange glaze. \n\nTips: Come here with your entire party present before 6 pm. In general, stay clear of the spicy menu items if you can't handle the heat.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

Young guy with floral tattoo on his right forearm. We wrote our names on the waitlist at the door at 615pm and he tore the sheet off, so when we returned at 645pm the sheet was gone. We asked if we could put our names down again on the list and he said \"come back at 8pm, we're not feeding anyone till then. No, no list - list starts again at 8pm.\nSo we decide to go somewhere else for a drink and return at 8pm. It is now 810 and people have gathered outside, and started writing their names on the paper outside the door. We do the same (we are now third in line). Same dude walks out, swears at us \"FFS don't write names there!!\" And tears the list off again. People are... Shocked. He then comes out with a fresh piece of paper maybe 5 mins later, sticks it up - leaving the people milling around at the entrance confused. We then take matters into our own hands and say, ok - let's go in the same order we wrote on the previous piece (something I imagine the host should really be managing). The other groups outside thank us for taking charge and being fair. Everyone talks about what a douche the dude is.

It's top 100 places to eat in SF and being number one, it should be AMAZING. \n\nWell, sorry folks. I wouldn't even call this restaurant a real Chinese restaurant. The customers nor the waitresses were even chinese, and that's the FIRST thing I look at to validate some authenticity in chinese restaurants. If anything, I would say this restaurant is a Hipsternese restaurant, playing rock music, dimly lit, christmas lights all around, waitresses in colored denim jeans and tanks, and everyone in the restaurant being Caucasian (no offense). My friend and I were the only Chinese people eating in a chinese restaurant. *awkwardd* \n\nI kind of got disappointed at that first sight, so I told my friend I would \"use the restroom\" and spy on the cooks to see if they were even Chinese.  Luckily, they were! So I said ok we'll give it a shot then. We ordered a lot of food just to try it all out, and honestly, the food was average. If you're someone who doesn't eat Chinese food very often I can see how it can be delicious, but I eat Chinese food every day and I can find more authentic food with half the price at a legit chinese restaurant.\n\n1) Infamous Salt Cod Fried Rice: 3 stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sW7WYYrHEvR8yEYxautAgQ?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#w9CRR9nw86uOCQYMhrtbdg\nIt's good, but it's not amazing. It wasn't salty like some restaurants make it, but I also don't think they added much salt cod in the first place. $10 for this dish but I can get it just as good and cheaper at a local chinese restaurant. But if you like the Americanized atmosphere, then you can come get it here. \n\n2) Thrice Cooked Bacon: 4 stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sW7WYYrHEvR8yEYxautAgQ?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#-pKUB0ezT1gypMHSsxgv2Q \nI thought this tasted better than the salt cod fried rice!

I had a feeling it would smell or taste like curry (which I don't eat at all) and it did, so my friend ate it. But he said it was alright, not bad if you like lamb and don't mind cumin/curry like me\n\nOVERALL: not impressed. If you must come here, order the salt cod fried rice and thrice cooked bacon.

Lazy.\n\nI asked the waitress what the favorites were, and she referred to the above.  The cucumbers were there mostly because I felt the need for something green, and maybe something refreshing to counter the meaty sounding dishes.  I say this mostly to show that I didn't go out of my way to order the worst dishes here and that it was likely a representative sample, if not among the best that they serve.\n\nThe food was only superficially Chinese.  Kung pao with celery?  No, just no.  I don't even know what was going on in the bacon dish, as it was just a mish mash of tastes and textures that it just felt off and didn't synergize into anything resembling Chinese food.  And yes, I understand that this is \"Asian fusion,\" but like I said, it did it in a lazy way.  That is, protein substitution.

I told the waitress that the portion size was smaller than I remembered (after I had finished the food, I had no intention of sending the food back). She said \"yeah it's a little bit smaller but not that small\". After she swiped my card and came back with the receipts, she said \"the chef says food has gotten more expensive\".  I weep for you MCF, if the $7 pho place down the street can still turn a profit, yet you can't survive with your $14 child-sized noodle soup.", "author": "Sylvia W."}

The highs were the Beer Brined Sichuan Pickles, which were so flavorful and spicy.  The second runner up was the Tea Smoked Eel which was a very nice break from the pickles.  On to the mediocre at best was the Salt Cod Fried Rice which I would have liked to see more Salt Cod.  The Cumin Lamb Ribs were a huge disappointment. They were overcooked and the pool of sauce couldn't break through to the hard exterior to flavor the meat.  To make matters worse I couldn't detect the vaguest hint of Cumin.  I would have to call this dish lamb abuse at it's worst.\n\nThe interior is dim with a big red dragon floating overhead.  The service was fine if unremarkable.  The beer list covers the expected, but no complaints.  With all of the really great places to eat, many that provide more bang for the buck, I would skip this experience.", "author": "Heather D."}

We arrived a little after 5 PM (after looking for parking for a good 10-15 minutes) and added our name on the list outside. We were called after five minutes and they sat us right in the middle of the tiny restaurant and brought us menus. *Caution: Once you step inside you are overwhelmed with the smell of spices... people were coughing all over the place!!! \n\nWe looked at the dishes and decided what we wanted to order, but for some reason we couldn't flag any of the waitresses down! It seemed like they were just walking by and ignoring us even when we were all looking around and obviously ready to order. I even asked one of the waitresses \"Could we order please?\" and she said \"yeah\" and never came back. WTF. Not cool. After 10-15 minutes of being ignored and no service a bunch of my friends started trying to flag someone down and FINALLY one of the waitresses came over. Not a good start.\n\nWe ordered the tea smoked eel, dumplings, cod fried rice, and mapo tofu. The eel was quite good, big pieces of eel with a nice rice wrapper and some crunchy celery inside. The dumplings were tasty but they were small and way overpriced for what they were. The cod fried rice had barely any cod in it =( which was disappointing because COD is in the name, but the addition of Taiwanese sausage in the mix was nice. Finally the mapo tofu was SPICY! Be aware this dish will make your mouth tingle. I am a big fan of mapo tofu but I've never had it this spicy before; it was good but you sure have to be careful!\n\nIn the end the food was meh, the service was horrible and the prices were too high.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-09", "description": "So many haters out there! I loved Mission Chinese Food, and in a city where there  is a plethora of amazing restaurants, I can honestly say: \"I'll be back.\"\n\nFar from authentic, or at least far from the authentic I know. I can tell you this much, the Oakland Chinatown scene isn't serving up chicken schmaltz fried rice and kung pao pastrami, both of which were devoured at Mission Chinese.\n\nQuick back story: Danny Bowien (chef/restauranteur) opened one up in NYC after so much success here in SF and the wait to eat in NYC was hours. Like unbearable. If you didn't get there at 5pm to put your name down, you weren't gonna get a chance to eat until 11pm type deal. I am so pumped that was not the same experience here!\n\nOk the deal: no reservations, first come, first serve and your party must be present to be seated. You leave your name on a pad and you either wait or leave and if your name is called while you have taken reprieve at a local bar, you can come back let them know and you'll be up next. It works. We arrived at about 7 on a Saturday night to a wait, came back at 9 and were easily seated.\n\nHip hop is always the best music you can play, especially when eating in a dark, kitschy Chinese restaurant. Yes, call me a hipster, call me whatever you like, but I'm into the vibe. Service suits the restaurant. My water glass was always full, my food came out quickly and we exchanged pleasantries. What else are you looking for?\n\nNow the food. I suggest going family style. All of the portions were large. There were 3 grown men and myself and this was more than enough food. Nothing was over oily, like Chinese food can tend to be. Lots of sodium, but again they didn't over do it and what do you expect? This is Chinese food!\n\n - Thrice cooked bacon - Salty, delicious and those flat slices of dough add this great texture. A nice side dish to share.\n- Pork dumplings - This is on the to-go menu, but they hooked it up. More gyoza than dumplings. They were good, but there's better out there. \n- Tea smoked eel - Funky. I liked it, but didn't love it. I wouldn't order again. The combo of ingredients didn't mesh as well as it could have. Definitely unique.\n- Kung Pao pastrami - Such a unique dish. Chunks of pastrami sauteed with potato, celery and peanuts with a hint of spice. Really great dish. A table favorite.\n- Schmaltz rice - chicken fat dressed rice with cucumber and a hint of hot sauce. I wouldn't order this as a main entree, but it went perfectly with the spiciness of the other dishes. Very subtle flavor, but so buttery and delicious. I loved this.\n- Spicy beef chow mein - My favorite with the rice. Spicy, delicious beef sauteed with noodles and vegetables. \n\nBetween the quality ingredients, the large portion sizes and the creativity of the food, Mission Chinese is it. We left full with a bottle of sake, dropping about $30 per person. For a night out in the Mission that isn't a massive burrito, look no further.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

The thrice cooked bacon however, I could hardly find any bacon. The dish was very spicy and I love me some spicy food but this even made my lips burn.

They donate a portion of each entree price to the food bank. Like the former Mission Street Food (their chef homages), Myint's association with Commonwealth, and quite possibly the future Mission Bowling Club, they're carrying a sense of food activism.

I visited Mission Cantina in NYC for their Vietnamese breakfast. Mission Cantina is under the same ownership as Mission Chinese Food and I was expecting the same greatness I had encountered at Cantina. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. The food was a bit below average, the service was solid, the music taste was on point. \n\nA friend and I ordered three dishes. General Tso's veal rib, egg noodles, and forbidden  fried rice. The veal rib came out first and it tasted great. The sauce had the right balance of sweet and tangy. The viscosity of the sauce gave it a really nice visual. It was crispy and fatty and my favorite dish of the night. The egg noodles and forbidden fried rice came out together but neither was impressive. We both agreed that the egg noodles heavy use of ginger completely destroyed the dish. We could not taste anything but ginger. It was as if the noodles were a vehicle for the ginger. The forbidden rice was neither good nor bad. It was just your average fried rice. The three dishes left us wondering wether we had simply ordered the wrong items on the menu or went in with incredibly high expectations.  I think it was a little of both. The food was average, but the service was solid.\n\nThe waiter was pretty knowledgeable of the menu. Went with the veal rib after speaking to him about the dish. The dishes came out in a  reasonable amount of time and the wait for a table was in the neighborhood of ten minutes. The decor was what you would imagine a hipster Chinese American restaurant would look like. \n\nThe restaurant was incredibly dark. The only lighting being provided was some old christmas lights and lanterns. It felt like one of those rooms where pictures are developed. The music was on point, but it was loud to the point where we could not carry  a conversation. \n\nThe high expectations were not met. I thought it was going to be as awesome as Mission Cantina's Vietnamese breakfast but it did not come close. I don't put too much weight on decor and service if the food is amazing, but the overwhelming ginger in the egg noodle dish and the unremarkable forbidden rice left me disappointed.

Nothing looked super appealing, but I had been recomended the burrito, so I ordered the one with the tofu inside. The people I was with ordered a bunch of other things to all share. My burrito came with cod fried rice. It was super fishy. Like fish that had been left out on the counter for 2 days fishy. Unbareably fishy. It was totally inediable. My other friends tried it and agreed that it was too fishy and no one wanted a second bite. Thus 3/4 of the burrito went uneaten. \n\nMy friends ordered the mushroom fried rice, ribs, chicken wings, and some noodle dish. The only dish that anyone actually enjoyed were the ribs, though I wasn't a huge fan of them. To me the only thing that I wanted a second  serving of were the chicken wings, but not because they are good. They are covered in some sort of chili - lime rub. When you eat them your mouth goes numb and everything tastes weird afterwards. Not a totally enjoyable experience, but I had a second one for the novalty of it.\n\nThere's also only one toilet and this place is always packed, so expect waiting 10 minutes or so for your chance to pee.\n\nAll in all a super dissapointing dinning expereince.

Although our waitress was a definite ditz, her suggestions were spot on:\n\n-- Tea-smoked eel\n-- Sour Chili Chicken\n-- 3x cooked bacon and rice cakes (without the bacon)\n-- Stir-fried Squid Ink Noodles\n\nWe found that the mix of 2 apps and 2 entrees were the perfect amount for a not-super-hungry group of 4 people at 5:30pm (early dinner).  (At 5:15pm on a Saturday night, we arrived to an almost empty restaurant but the place filled up quickly and by 6:15pm it was a packed house with a short line outside!) My fav was the thrice cooked \"bacon\".  Being that the group is used to spicy food, I didn't find anything mouth burning, as other Yelpers have mentioned, but I am glad we went with a mix of fiery and non-fiery dishes.

I read about MCF in Bon Appetit, so despite all the negative reviews, I had to come try it. We got here around 8:30pm on Sat night and ended up waiting over an hour. (That part sucked.) I will warn you that this place looks like a ghetto Chinese restaurant, but it does not serve ghetto Chinese food. The food is more fusion, and most of the people eating here are hipsters or non-Asians. I think initially that was a really big negative, since usually a sure sign of an ethnic restaurant being good is when _insert said ethnic group_ eats there. Like my brother said, \"I feel a little embarrassed to be the only Asian people eating at an Asian restaurant.\"\n\nBut if you set your expectations as coming to MCF to eat straight-up good food, not about coming to eat specifically Chinese food, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. That may be an understatement. \n\nMust gets:\n#1- Squid ink noodles. I guess they don't do to-go so it's not listed on their website menu. This dish was awesome. It's squid ink (thick) noodles with lamb, fennel, chickpeas, and onions. It also comes with a dipping sauce, which might have been some buttery lamb broth. I don't really care what it was, but if you're a big fan of lamb, you'll love this dish.\n\n#2- Thrice cooked bacon and rice cakes. Rice cakes with sweet tofu skin, pepper, and thrice cooked bacon. Really tasty, but the thrice cooked bacon was soft, not crispy, like I'd expect of something cooked thrice. Actually, it was kind of hard to distinguish between the bacon and the tofu skin in the dimly lit restaurant, since both were kind of soft and floppy.\n\n#3- Mongolian long beans. This is mandatory if you're one of those people that feel like you need a vegetable-heavy entree with every meal. It's spicy, but not burn-your-mouth-off spicy. It's a huge dish with lots of long beans, lots of other semi-edible vegetable parts, like ends of boy choy? Like I said, it's hard to tell what things are in the dark. \n\nSkip it/not sure what the hype is all about:\nLoser #1- Kung pao pastrami. Meh. The pastrami was really tender and salty, but it felt like the flavor completely clashed with the kung pao flavors of peanuts and heat. It wasn't by any means bad, but I just wouldn't order it again.\n\nLoser #2- Salt cod fried rice. Sounds exciting with the fish, Chinese sausage, and egg, but at the end of the day, if you've had a fried rice, you've had this fried rice. Nothing about it stood out. Sure, you'll get yummy bits of fish or Chinese sausage, but it's mostly rice and egg.", "author": "Alice T."}

My friends and I were in the process of finishing our beers and deciding how to split the bill. We then noticed a restaurant employee with a long face was standing next to our table, which made us feel uncomfortable because he was really looking at us as if he wanted us to get out of there right away. I then asked him (trying to be nice and ask him what his preference would be given we were going to split the bill): excuse me, what's easier for you, if we include the tip on the credit card charge or if we pay it later? He then responded: it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it fast. At this point I realized this restaurant employee -who appeared to be the manager- did not care about the customer experience and only wanted to get us out of there to make a quick buck on fast table turnarounds. \n\nI then went on to confront him, letting him know that it is customers like my friends and I who pay his salary and that he shouldn't be treating us like that. I felt I had to do this given we were trying to be nice to restaurant staff - by asking him what payment option would be most convenient for them.

FOR HIPSTERS.  It's got a lot of creativity in the menu, and a whole lot of spice.  That being said, it's freaking delicious.\n\nThe ambiance:  it's loud.  Like, really loud.  For a chinese place, they sure do love their hip hop.  And Mariah Carey.  Which might have been okay if not for the mildly intoxicated hipsters belting out unwanted karaoke.  Anyway, the point is, it's loud.  But hey, it's the Mission.  There are hipsters.  Deal with it.  \n\nThe food itself was very good though.  The pork belly was a very interesting take on it (very... pineapple-y) but pretty delicious.  And they definitely nailed the crispy skin, which is my favorite.  It was a little fatty, but not too much more than what i would expect of, you know, pork belly.  People!  if you don't want fat, don't order pork belly!  \nWe also got the Kung Pao Pastrami which was SPICY.  If you weren't considering it, GET RICE.  It'll help with the spice and and spread out the extremely tasty seasonings.  Lastly, we got the Westlake rice porridge was tasty, but nothing that you couldn't get somewhere else.  For $12 the portion size was pretty decent though, and there was crab.  not bad.\n\noverall it was a great dining experience, although it was a bit loud.  Definitely worth a swing by on a slow night, or if you're just in the mood for something spicy and chinese.", "author": "Mike P."}

I've gone in person twice but I more use it for their delivery service.\nI like their cucumber appetizer. It's nice and fresh, but it's too soggy for delivery.\nChicken wings are great too! \nThe thrice cooked rice cakes are wonderful. The combination of spicy and bacon savory flavors really make this dish stand out.\nThe ma po tofu is great too but not for delivery because I swear it once arrived smelling a bit odd. Also, if you google this recipe, you can easily make it yourself for 1/8 of the price. I've done it before; I just haven't had time recently.\nThe salt cod fried rice has to be my favorite on the menu. It's my favorite because the flavors are not as strong as the thrice cooked rice cakes with bacon, but it goes very well with the long beans. And those are really saucy and spicy!\nChow mein is bland. I've had the beef and the duck and I just have to say bland^2. \n\nNow for the experience itself: \nThe restaurant has a bit of a hippy vibe. The waiters are very nice and American. \nI've gone in once with my boyfriend and by myself. Both times, the food came out in a timely manner and the servers were very attentive. \n\nNow the delivery side is really funny.\nSo after dining in person, I realized that they deliver to Balboa Park! Junky Chinese food is on my list as I crunch down for my exam! However, instead of an American waiter picking up the phone, I get someone who can barely speak English. I mean, there's really only a limited number of times I can repeat my phone number over and over again until someone gets it right. They also can't get the number 62 right. It's not 52 or 42 or 32... it's 62. At one point today, I had to ask them to pass the phone to someone who spoke better English. If you can't get 2 numbers right, forget 10. \n\nThese phone conversations can be pretty awkward. The wait is a little long. I spend 15 minutes ordering a salt cod fried rice dish with a side of long beans for almost $40 and it takes you 75 minutes to deliver it to me. 2 dishes for around $40. \nIf anyone calls in for delivery orders, I HIGHLY recommend that you do not order delivery here for lunch. I once ordered the porridge and the crab they used clearly was bad. My boyfriend and I had to dump it out. \n\nToday, as I was studying away and awaiting my order, I got a phone call from the delivery guy that he left the food outside my door. I went out to pick it up, expecting him to be there so I could sign my receipt. All I found was the dinner placed on the floor at my door.\n\nMission Chinese Food no more.", "author": "Aggie Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-05", "description": "Rarely do I praise hipster joints with a whole lot of 'tude, but Mission Chinese does such a novel twist on traditional Hunan and Szechuan dishes and for such a good cause - 75 cents of every entree goes to the San Francisco Food Bank - that I cannot deny that I really like the food they serve there. Finding out that it made Michael Bauer's Top 100 in the Sunday Chronicle, Jamie W. and I made a beeline to 18th and Mission early on Sunday evening to give it a try before the inevitable stampede. Even at 5:30PM, the nondescript place was getting fairly crowded. \n\nUnless you knew what you were looking for (the yellow awning that says Lung Shan Restaurant), you'd probably miss it unless you noticed the anxious crowd waiting on the sidewalk. There are abundant temptations on their menu courtesy of the culinary creativity of Danny Bowien and Anthony Myint (see photos of the menu), but be prepared to find out they may be out of certain dishes. For instance, I really wanted to try the Warm Egg Custard with Duck Confit and Sea Urchin, but dammit, they were out. \n\nInstead, we tried the $10 Lion's Head Meatball in Marrow Broth with Preserved Turnip Greens, Bok Choy and Ramen Noodles (see photo). That was delicious with the ground pork very tasty and moist and the ramen just the right consistency. It easily feeds two on its own, but we didn't stop there. We ordered the $12.50 Sizzling Cumin Lamb because I was immediately drawn to the idea of Salt-&-Peppered Lamb Belly mixed with Chili-Pickled Long Beans, although it looked like there were a fair number of green and red peppers and onions as well (see photo). Regardless, the luxuriant belly pieces were a nice counterpoint to the crispiness of the vegetables as it came in a burning-hot cast-iron pan. \n\nOur last choice was a scorcher, the unavoidable $11 Kung Pao Corned Beef which came with a warning of of two red pepper signs on the menu (see photo). The generous slices came mixed with celery, potatoes, roasted peanuts, and of course, red hot chili peppers you needed to pick up lest you want to experience a loss of feeling in your lower torso. It was delicious, but the sweat was rolling down the back of my head like that embarrassing scene of Albert Brooks in the anchor chair in \"Broadcast News\". The audacity of the culinary execution here is what will bring us back regardless of the perspiration challenges. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...adventurously funky reinventions of dishes you could find at a Chinese take-out counter only the ingredients here are uniquely unexpected and awfully tasty \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a bit of a dive heavy on the formica, but I guess that's part of the charm here \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty efficient if a bit coolish to offset the heat of some of the dishes, I guess \nTOTAL - 4 stars...totally worthy of your attention and such a bargain to boot", "author": "Ed U."}

Halfway into our meal, another group of her friends come in and are seated.  She spends ALL of her time taking pictures of them, chit chatting, and bringing out food for them.  Basically, she is waiting on them hand and foot.  Meanwhile she pays no attention to anyone else.  She never once walks by our table or the other tables around us.  When we are done with our food, I flag her down and ask her for a check.  She does not bring us the check.  We wait for at least 10 to 15 minutes.  I go up to the counter and ask the male worker for a check.  He mumbles something and I ask him what he said. I ask him again if I pay here.  He says I can bring it to you or you can pay here.  Not knowing how long he will take (because he could have just given me the check already right after I asked him), I tell him to bring it to the table.  \n\nThis is one of the worst places I have ever eaten at.

The food is amazing and the atmosphere is fun, even if the quarters are a bit tight. The food is a version of Chinese that I am sure no one has ever had. It is complex and fresh and beyond creative. The chef is simply brilliant. I have never had a bad meal and the place has never failed to impress. I recommend bringing a nice bottle of red to pair with the food. We have actually brought some nice reserves and the food really goes well with it. I was quite surprised. I am addicted to the pastrami and the forbidden rice, I almost cry when i think about the rice being taken off the menu. It was always my non negotiable dish. Truthfully everything is amazing, you can't go wrong. And try the Moscow mule. \n\nThe only thing I wish they would change is the attitude that all the maitre'ds often have. Whoever handles the front/ reservations is often rude. This is strange because the wait staff is always super nice. Last time was even worse than normal and left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. We had a reservation because my in laws were in town. We got stuck in very unusual traffic and were running late. Our bad. I know. I called and asked if it was ok. When we arrived (around the time I estimated on the phone) I apologized again and mentioned that I had called ahead. The host was a little dismissive but told us to wait outside, which we did without complaint. Then when he seated us he was rude again and proceeded to give me a lecture about how normally they would not seat us and then proceeded to intentionally ignore me and my husband throughout dinner while we were trying to flag someone down for water. First of all we were only about 10-15 minutes late, I called, I apologized.  They take walk ins and we did wait a little, we were also the ONLY people waiting for a table so they probably would have sat us at the same time had we just strolled in. It was just really unnecessary attitude. Not too many people know about this place and I take everyone and their mom there and I just LOVE the food so much. They always love it.

He's kind of another level of food snob, so I just let him wander like a blood hound searching for game to hunt... and all of a sudden, his ears perked and I heard him howl with delight (okay, i'm definitely exaggerating... but just play along)... as he pointed to a run down chinese joint that almost looked closed. I raised my eyebrow in skepticism, but decided to trust my food-hound friend. \n\nWhat it turned out to be was an old run down chinese restaurant (Lung Shan Restaurant), being used to give real Chinese food to hipsters. Wonderful. We were seated within 10 minutes (super fast for the city!).\n\nDecor- it's like walking into a dark room because all the lights are red. Not good for your eyes... but eh. They did not take away from any of the original cheap chinese restaurant decor, just added little touches. My favorite is the chinese painting that they turned into a speaker cabinet pumping trendy music. \n\nBeing the gourmand that my friend was, we ordered way too much... haha okay, not his fault. Mine. I saw all these dishes I had missed from my time in Chongqing! Tons of huajiao mala junk (numb spice). We got the lamb ribs with cumin, the face numbing noodles, the chongqing chicken wings and the salt cod rice. \n\nOh my gosh. I had low expectations. My rule is- if the majority of the crowd is white people, the chef will probably tone down the food for their tastes... But wow. I was proved wrong. i love that the food here says \"hell no!\" and doesn't apologize for being Chinese and the flavors and textures that make chinese food wonderful. The lamb ribs were wonderful and cumin-y. the chicken wings and the face numbing noodle soup had our mouths in numb fire. The salt cod rice was divine and had just the right amount of salted fish in it. \n\nHere's my only major complaint (the minor is that it's a little pricey for stuff I could get at another chinese restaurant... but i forgive that complaint for being in the mission district)- the other patrons with didn't seem to understand the food. While I appreciate that the owner/chef is trying to expose real chinese food to the white hipster masses... I couldn't help but cringe as I watched people eat the food. Most actually surprised me and appreciated the culture and the food... but our next door eaters looked at their salted cod fried rice... and without even tasting it, started dousing it with soy sauce. This is a cardinal sin in my book for chinese food. I kind of wish the restaurant would just hide the soy sauce and only have vineagar, lao gan ma and maybe spicy mustard so that it would avoid any situation like what I had just witnessed. It took all my strength not to sock the guy in the face... him pouring soy sauce was like pissing on the graves of my anscestors... okay. maybe i'm getting carried away here haha.

I think I even had a dream about it last night. It was simply incredible.\n\nWe were on a vacation from LA, and the entire reason we went to MCF was because I saw Danny Bowien on The Martha Stewart Show, of all places! Ha. He was making his specialty, high-gluten hand-pulled noodles. Martha was insane for them, I was impressed, and I had to try them. So on we go to San Francisco to give them a try.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that they were not on the menu anymore. I shyly asked our very sweet waiter where they were, and he explained that the city made them stop making them. I guess they were making them out on the street, which I hadn't realized. Anyway, the menu looked so wonderful (plenty of veggie options) that I didn't let it get me down.\n\nWe started with the smashed cucumbers in sesame sauce. Trust me, this is the most refreshing dish you'll ever find. I love cucumbers and pickles anyway, but my god. Out of this world good. To make something simple this memorable is pretty hard to do. Can't recommend this dish enough. In fact, I'm about to attempt to make them tonight. Got the small chinese cucumbers on the counter waiting for me and everything. My husband wanted to try the tea-smoked eel, which is a wrap. And it has braised pork and chinese celery in it as well. It was outstanding. So many different flavors and crunch.\n\nWe were pretty full by the time we hit the main course option, but we both ordered. I had the Egg Egg Noodles (a vegetarian dish).....holy moly! PERFECT. It's very hard for me to explain, but they're hand made egg noodles sitting in a broth with all sorts of fantastic veggies sitting on top of it all. And all of that is topped with a gooey, poached egg. Break open the yolk, and the whole dish changes before your eyes. I liken it a bit to traditional Asian porridge. If you've never had anything like that, this is the best I can recommend. (If you're in LA, give Red Medicine's porridge a try)\n\nHusband ate a fried rice dish that was good and very simple. The rice was rolled in chicken fat and had a texture like no rice we'd ever had. While it was great, this probably the low-point. But, who cares. A low-point here is still outstanding. Oh, and it was a Monday night at 6:30 and we had no wait at all! So don't let the fear of a long wait stop you. And although the restaurant is SUPER cool with very attractive young people serving you, they are all surprisingly nice and helpful and prompt. None of that \"too cool for school\" stuff here.

So she crossed their name off the list and gave their table to someone else. So there's that. Why not have someone take down people's names? If you're going to have a policy of not seating people because you supposedly can't read their writing? I made sure my name was legible by the way! \n\nI think that Saturday night the hostess did a poor job of managing the wait list. I think she was eager to get rid of people from the list because like I mentioned it was almost closing time and there was still a huge line. When we were eating we saw the cook/chef/owner screaming with the hostess. Employees started leaving one by one. And the restaurant was still full. \n\nSo 2 stars for the ghetto situation. Not something I would have ever expected. Don't show up here if it's after 9pm because you may not get seated until 10pm, and they close at 10:30pm.", "author": "Vol T."}

Add in its reputation, and I think my expectations were set a bit too high. My dinner here wasn't exactly the best.\n\nWhen I saw the Tea-Smoked Eel in the menu, my eyes immediately lit up because I love tea-smoked duck. I was really expecting the same kind of big smoky pow that you would get from the duck. The rolls themselves were alright - a bit sweet and salty. What really let me down was the eel. They didn't taste a bit smoky to me at all. I still think that there's potential in this dish. The smokiness would've complemented the sweet and salty flavors in addition to the pork. It would've also provided a nice contrast to the fresh flavor of the greens. Without the smoke, the dish didn't really tie together.\n\nI was also really excited to try the Ma Po Tofu. After hearing all the buzz, it seemed like this was MCF's signature dish. It definitely had a decent kick to it, and the bean sauce was thick and rich. However, the bright citrus notes and tingly numbing sensation you'd get from Szechuan peppercorns were absent. That's a big deal. When I eat Szechuan food, I don't even pay too much attention to the spiciness. The defining feature is the presence of the numb feeling in your mouth. In the end, the Ma Po Tofu wasn't really interesting without the citrus flavors and numbing peppercorns. \n\nThe Salt Cod Fried Rice was another dish that looked good on paper. I'm guessing it's suppose to be a play on Chinese salted fish and chicken fried rice (ham yu gai lup chow fan). I thought the fried rice in general was pretty bland and lacked wok hei. The mackerel confit tasted fine, but it didn't hold up when paired with the rice.  The fish wasn't flavorful enough to properly season another component. There's not enough Chinese sausage to really help either. I think something more potent, like bacalhau, would work better in the fusion fried rice.\n\nThe price isn't too high, but I think for the wait, I'd rather go to Z&Y for Szechuan food.", "author": "Nei N."}

(Not to be confused with fusion, where you use non-traditional ingredients/techniques.) You probably won't find these dishes at other Chinese restaurants and if so, they probably won't be so cheap.\n\nFor the haters, I can see how this places seems to \"pander\" to a hip, Caucasian crowd, with its white, hipster, only English-speaking staff, clientele and music. I can see how the no-reservation system is frustrating and aggravating given the incredible amount of hype surrounding this restaurant.\n\nAnd because I can see both sides of the equation, I have come to the conclusion that I am completely, 100% ambivalent about Mission Chinese. The Thrice-Cooked Bacon and Bok Choy in Popcorn Broth are delicious and innovative, but also incredibly greasy and rather small in portion. The Smoked Beef Brisket Noodle Soup is a good idea in theory, but the smokiness overwhelms the beef flavor and the giant noodles (about 2\" wide) are a pain to eat. The Beef Cheek \"A L'Orange\" is just....I don't even know what to think of it. I couldn't taste any orange and the pieces were rather over-crisp and greasy.\n\nThat said, I'm still glad I chose this as the place to take my visiting, out-of-town friend Nurah M. She doesn't get good Chinese food where she lives, so she wanted me to pick a place to satisfy that craving. Mission Chinese was perfect because it took her request one step further and gave us original, unique Chinese food that even other Chinese restaurants wouldn't offer. So if you're looking to find a Chinese restaurants that meets these criteria, I would definitely recommend Mission Chinese.", "author": "Josephine L."}

I couldn't imagine that this place would have been better than the Chinatown places in Houston, TX. I came to visit sf to try different food, not Chinese! But as he insisted, I went with it since it was famously known and attracted long lines. Luckily on a Sunday around 1pm, there were no lines but after a while that we were dining there, the restaurant started filling up.\n\nThere's no ac inside, just the front doors being pretty open which made it for a miserable and uncomfortable eating environment because it was so darn hot. We were better off eating outside on the floor instead of inside this sauna. They also served lukewarm water. \n\nWe ordered the ma po tofu which to this day, I can't explain the weird tingling numbing sensation I got from this dish! It's not like it was super spicy but enough to make us sweat. Add on top of that with the hot environment, and you're one sweaty, sticky hot mess! We kept asking for napkins to wipe off. The dish was a bit too much. It made it difficult for me to thoroughly enjoy my meal because of the numbing it did to my mouth and tongue. No matter how much rice I ate, it wouldn't go away. The taste was also so different, you couldn't stop eating it either. It was normal when you take a bite then tangy aftertaste? Anyone feel me on this? \n\nWe also ordered the thrice bacon with rice cake. The rice cake reminds me of the Korean ddok, that's probably what it is anyways. Anyways I'm not a fan of bacon but this dish was pretty delicious and flavorful! The bacon combination with the rice cake mochi was so good, I can still taste it in my mouth. I definitely recommend this dish. \n\nWe also family styled, that's the way to go!", "author": "Jeena L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-01-02", "description": "You come to Mission Chinese to get some fun, funky twists on Chinese fusion food in a unique environment, at least that's why I loved it the first time I went. At my first visit over a year ago, the food was gratuitous, rich and just a little too salty - but over all really tasty. 2nd time I took my parents, bad mistake, as two 1st generation Chinese immigrants were appalled by what they considered a bastardization of their home cuisine. Though the food was tasty, it even saltier than the first time, to the point where we didn't finish a lot of the food. I'd give that visit 3 stars because the food was still palatable. \n\nBut these two visits are not why Mission Chinese is getting one star from me. Last night, I took some friends visiting here to enjoy some hip, fun chinese food and half the dishes were just seriously inedible even horrifying. \n\nWe got the Tiki Pork belly, which is always a safe bet at Mission Chinese, it's hard to go wrong with deep friend pork belly. It was solid, but as always a little too salty. You can't NOT skimp on white rice and water here, you will be punished. \n\nThen the Mongolian Long beans, another edible dish, it wasn't great but again it's nearly impossible to screw up. \n\nNext we got to the Sesame chicken, by this time everyone's tastebuds were experiencing some serious fatigue. Drinking water was such a good relief that it almost hurt. Sesame chicken was not noteworthy - I almost forgot we had eaten it. Thick crust, over cooked, barely any meat... again primary flavors: salt and sugar.\n\nBut the last two dishes are why I woke up with my throat swollen this morning, what made a pretty mediocre meal unforgettably bad, why I've probably lost dinner-picking rights among my friends and why I will never go back to Mission Chinese again. \n\nWe got the Vegan Dan-Dan Mein - again nearly impossible to screw up. The noodles came out swimming in this thick sauce, unlike any Dan Dan mein I've ever seen, more like noodle cornstarch soup. There was a hint something weird, herbal, tangy - almost a mix between lemon grass and pinesol that was in the noodles... not only do those two flavors NOT mix with food in general, they especially clash with the Ma La (numbing spice) that laced the Dan-dan mein. That combined with what must have been 500g of salt in this small bowl, the four of us couldn't get through 1/4th of the small bowl of noodles.\n\nFinally, the unforgettable Ma Po Tofu. I had nightmares about this. How the F*(#K do you screw up Ma Po Tofu that badly? Texturally the dish was okay and that's where the good things ended. There was Ma La again, which I expect to be in a good Ma Po, but then you get slammed with the salt and there's this indescribable chemical burning pain. The only thing I can compare it to is Potassium bitartrate filling the inside of your mouth. Don't ask me how I know but that's the closest feeling there is - if you want to try for yourself they sell Potassium bitartrate under the name Cream of Tartar in most grocery stores (have 911 on the ready) OR you could just try some of Mission Chinese's Ma Po Tofu for 10X the cost. At least you'll have a pretty red dragon gracing the saddest culinary atrocity in your life. \n\nSeriously we are not picky eaters, I'm Chinese and I clear my plates but we could not eat more than 3 small spoonfuls of the Ma Po Tofu. I just kept diluting that chemical sludge with more and more white rice until I realized I was just eating white rice at that point to try to end the pain. I want to emphasize that I grew up with Chinese peppers and Sichuan food, this was not the burning of chilies or Ma La... this was something else, much more sinister. Water hurt, my tongue hurts this morning, my throat is nearly swollen shut. How was this even legal? Were we being experimented on? \n\nI was between tears and laughing hysterically when our sweet, nervous waitress asked us if we wanted to box our nearly untouched food. Please no.", "author": "Jing Y."}

We assumed that because it was a Sunday night that there'd be a shorter line. Sike.  After putting our name down on the clipboard outside, nervously pacing up to see where we were in line, we ended up walking down the street to The Sycamore for a drink before heading back.  Once we sat down, we decided that we were going to go all out and get all of the \"highly recommended dishes\" per Yelp.  Here's what we ordered:\n\n-Fresh Rice Noodle with peanut sauce: Definitely fresh, but we got this only because the Egg Noodles were sold out that night.  Our overall reaction was that it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.\n-Tiki Pork Belly: Loved the pickled pineapple that comes with this, but like the Fresh Rice Noodle, it wasn't anything that blew my mind.\n\nAnd then came...\n-Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice Cakes: OMG. THIS WAS AMAZING!  I definitely have a soft spot for bacon, but this was something my tastebuds hadn't experienced yet!  This was definitely spicy as indicated on their menu, but it was mitigated by the chewiness of the rice cakes.  I would definitely get this again!\n-Chongqing Chicken Wings: HOT HOT HOT HOT.  The spice type on this is unreal and nothing that I had ever tasted before.  After scouring the internet for the type of spice that coated the chicken wings, we discovered that it is the Sichuan peppers that give the \"I can't feel my face\" numbness and the \"I need a tub of yogurt\" heat in my mouth.  Granted, my spice threshold is insanely small, so if you're sensitive to the spice pizzazz, tread with caution.  Otherwise, this is definitely a must-have item.  I'm told that it doesn't hold well for leftovers, which is why it's only available for sit-down.\n-Kung Pao Pastrami: Most definitely a spicy dish, and one of Greg's favorites for the night  This dish came out last, so we were able to take the leftovers home.  The smokiness of the pastrami really came through, and the spiciness was definitely a good kick in the ass for the end of the night.\n\nOverall, while the first two dishes were lackluster, the last three dishes were so insane from a taste perspective, you really had to think about what you could relate it back to.  You knew it was Chinese, but everything that went into it said that this isn't like any Chinese you've ever had before.

The atmosphere was cool with red lights for ambience, decorations on the ceiling and hip hop music playing in the background.  We got there at 6:30p on a Saturday and had to wait about 45 min.

Yes, MCF adds something new to the food landscape and I love that chef Danny Bowien is not held back by normal conventions and is cooking up dishes from the heart and often the gut. Unfortunately I have to say that for me there are quite a few misses on the menu.\n\nWe went with 4 people and ordered the Braised Pea Leaves, Chongqing Chicken Wings, General Tso's Veal Rib and Spicy Beef Chow Mein. The pea leaves were actually quite tasty and the broth flavorful and showed some restraint and balance, something that was not the case for the other dishes. The chicken wings are fried well and at first glance look like a typical Szechuan dish, but are coated with a mouth-numbing pepper, which as many people have pointed out here, is actually quite unpleasant. It has nothing to do with how spicy the dish is, but it numbs your mouth and kills your taste buds for about 10-15 minutes. \n\nThe chow mein was extremely over-salted, to the point where it was inedible and the veal rib was greasy, the coating not that special and generally didn't live up to an $18 entree. Which brings me to the last point, the place may look like many other cheap Asian eateries, the prices certainly don't. \n\nAll-in-all we walked in extremely excited and hungry and we left with an overall feeling of disappointment.

But I think I must wait a while before giving this place another go.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ate here last night and ordered three things to share. We decided on the Tingly Lamb Face noodle dish, The Ribs, and the renowned Green Bean dish. As usual, the atmosphere was very lively and engaging. Love the lighting and the dragon floating overhead from the ceiling.\n\nThe Lamb cheek noodles came first. The broth was incredibly salty, spicy, and heavy all at the same time. I hadn't known beforehand that they'd be udon noodles which I am not fond of but tried to like anyway. The lamb bits were very tender. We both went through our first pitcher of water like nothing.\n\nNext came the beans. These were also quite salty, unbearably so. They actually tasted almost identical to the soup to me, the only difference being texture. I thought at this point that it was our mistake for having ordered two things that were too similar in flavor and at least we had one more thing to try.\n\nThe ribs (unsure if they were the General Tsao or the Cumin ones, as one was out and the other was our backup) came very hot with the outside blackened plated on top of sweet onion slices. While I am a fan of crispy skin and charred meat, this was a whole other level. The outer skin was literally a quarter inch thick of black crust. Once you got past that, the meat was pretty good, but had a pretty straight forward generic \"pork\" flavor. The onions below were probably my favorite part! They were sweet and crunchy.\n\nNot sure if the MSG in the salt shaker on our table was an indication of the kitchen using a good deal of it in the food, but it would explain the saltiness of our dishes, the tingly mouth sensations, and the excruciating headache I've had for most of the day.\n\nSo it's bye for now, Mission Chinese, until we meet again!", "author": "Megan D."}

I had heard about Lung Shan for the past 2 yrs, upon moving to the Mission, but never got around to trying it. My man and I had just enjoyed Thai massages down the street and decided to grab something light. We ordered to go because it was late and the place was packed, though I would like to go back and dine in. Dim and dirty with great loud music, this is just my kind of spot.\n\nHe chose the Salt and Pepper Cod fried rice - his personal favorite from childhood - which was alright. Within the white rice, the cod was complimented by soft scrambled eggs, thinly sliced Chinese sausage, and green onion. My first time having this dish and I don't know if I would personally order it again. The cod had an overly fishy smell, which my bf said was normal for the dish.\n\nThe dish I chose, Thrice Cooked Bacon Rice Cakes, was a hit. My man warned me that Chinese bacon is sometimes too fatty and slimy, but I suppose since it is cooked three times, it firms up and takes on more of a meaty texture, like the bacon I am more accustomed to. The dish is very rich and pretty spicy but maybe a little over seasoned, which I loved. I offered a bit to my roommate back at home and she was a fan.\n\nThe negative, I must say, is that the customer service seems to be lacking. It's the Mission, I know, which somehow gives waiters/waitresses the authority to be super rude and dismissive. I waited around for five minutes before I finally asked one of the staff walking past me again and again if I could order with her, to which I was told to hold on - she never came back, but another girl came and took my order anwyay.

However, the food at MISSION CHINESE is better than most and that's because they take Asian standards and toss them on their heads.\n\nWhile known as MISSION CHINESE FOOD, the actual establishment is called LUNG SHAN RESTAURANT and its a bit of a dive, and I love it for that. The look of the joint and the uniqueness of the flavors are so different, it works. You would come in expecting Lemon Chicken or Beef Chop Suey but in reality, you get something totally different!\n\nWe went for CHONGQING CHICKEN WINGS (with Explosive Chili & Crispy Beef Tripe), SALT COD FRIED RICE (with Mackerel Confit & Chinese Sausage), MONGOLIAN LONG BEANS (with Xinjiang Spices, Horseradish & Chili Oil), BEEF CHEEK A L'ORANGE (with Orange Glaze, Kaffir Lime Leaves, Satsuma & Sesame) and KUNG PAO PASTRAMI (with Explosive Chili, Sweet Peppers & Peanuts). As you can see, Asian standards, tossed on their heads. I am a massive fan of the Mongolian Beans, they have a great kick to them and loads of flavor. I enjoyed the Kung Pao but agree with other reviews that said the meat was fatty and burnt. The Salt Cod Rice had a surprisingly fantastic blend of flavors and the Spicy Wings were top notch, mouth numbing heat yet oh, so tasty. The Beef was tender & moist and probably the least surprising of all the dishes.\n\nYou will have to wait to get a seat here as it is always busy and they do not take reservations. Do not go with a large party (more than six) or you will wait for long time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-06", "description": "3.5 stars.\n\nYesterday was the debut of the latest food venture (Mission Chinese Food) by the folks of MSF sharing the kitchen at Lung Shan. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G5cLIqCQd5QPOEKXl9LAAg/l The concept is \"Americanized\" Chinese food with a few twists. A friend had warned me in advance about the spicy items in the menu, just in case u can't handle the heat. I didn't feel like eating spicy food this time, so I didn't order those items (will try next time). Another tip: IF u order to go, don't forget to ask for utensils and napkins if u need them, otherwise u won't get any.\n\nPrices are not cheap, but 75 cents from every dish is donated to charity (SF Food Bank). Old news for those already familiar with the MSF concept. I have to admit that my first impression was that I preferred the old MSF creative menu better.\n\nAbout the food so far, in my opinion most dishes rate in the 3 to 4 stars range, some better than others.\n\nThe Peking duck chinito ($8) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1NybyuwRYYqkFJNYtaAbWg/l is a meat version of a HK dim sum item - duck meat inside a fried dough (\"yau tiu\" or \"oily sticks\" in Chinese) wrapped in a rice crepe (\"cheong fun\"), and served with hoisin sauce. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CP9KxPfb2GyJJ_4K8HcScg/l Nothing new for dim sum aficionados. - Verdict: it's just okay.\n\nThe salt cod fried rice ($10) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JIHAl3aA3FoBguVCmW3k1w/l is probably the most expensive fried rice I've ever paid for, but it's tasty and u get plenty of BIG chunks of tender fish as well as lots of sliced Chinese sausage. In a way it's like getting 2 dishes in one (deboned fish + fried rice), not bad at all. My favorite dish in the batch. - Verdict: thumbs up!!\n\nThe half roasted chicken ($9) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2Es_aFnCVfwHN1ZT5Xa-RQ/l was the most generous portion-wise of all the dishes I've seen. It can easily be shared among 2 or more people, and it comes with a stir-fried rice with peanuts. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D6_-GVzaUwKOjY76JJCmpQ/l Great crispy skin on the chicken. The pristine grated ginger sauce was neat, and the burnt wine sauce (yes, not soy sauce) was interesting. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8yMWJLI6YmYOCTEmfINHEA/l Most Chinese restaurants have something similar - \"chuy pei cay\" or crispy skin chicken, New Hing Lung makes a very good version (way better). - Verdict: thumbs down.\n\nFor dessert there's a taro pannacotta with honey ($4). http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/35MfXhgCEgsUtsc9BOLGxQ/l I'm sure that it looks wonderful on a plate when dining-in, but the crisp cookies got soggy inside the container with the honey sauce. The taste (mild taro potato) and texture were fine, a good dessert. - Verdict: thumbs up!\n\nThe old dining room could use a remodeling. For me the the lure of the original MSF was the changing menu and creativity. I hope that they can occasionally add a new item to keep things interesting. UPDATE: they now add new menu items almost monthly. Some dishes are interesting, some are not. My overall rating remains 3.5 stars. For any future updates I'll just upload my pics of the new food items.\n\nNote that u can also order from Lung Shan's regular menu.\n$5 corkage fee.

Not the table really close to the couple, literally THE SAME TABLE as the couple. Understandably so, the couple who appeared to be on a nice Tuesday night date, didn't want to be sitting shoulder to shoulder with two girls catching over their forlorn love lives and unsuccessful tinder dates. So doing the appropriate thing, we requested to sit at another table. Nothing against the couple, they seemed very nice.\n\nSo we requested it, and the rude hostess at around 7:30 pm last night, said you need to put your name on the board, which we have. Then in a very rude snarky voice, she said \"Well I need you to stand outside, k thanks.\" Ugh! I wish I had gotten her name. We were so turned off, we went to another restaurant. \n\nOk, sorry, had to vent. But seriously, Mission Chinese...if you are reading this, I love you guys.

A group of my friends and I waited about 45 minutes on a weeknight to get a table.\n\nI'll admit, the dining experience is very unique. There is a big red dragon that goes across the whole restaurant and the music is a great mix of old school hip hop.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best. Almost every dish we ordered felt way too salty.

I used to think, \"Oh hey, if the place is good, who cares that much about the service anyways?\"\n\nThanks for proving me wrong, Mission Chinese. This could possibly be the worst customer service I've ever had, and I've been to restaurants where there were dead flies on my serving plate. \n\nLet's start with the ambiance. I get that Mission Chinese is trying to be a cool \"hip\" Chinese restaurant, but I certainly didn't feel very hip inside a dimly red-lit room (reminds me a little of Chinese brothels) with Drake blasting in the background and a Chinese dragon chillin' near the ceiling. Okay, ambiance aside, whatever.\n\nLet's talk about the servers. Rude, rude, omg, SO RUDE. We had two people come in late because there was an emergency at our company and they had to go and sort it out. So we saved two dishes for them so that they could eat it when they arrive.\n\nOne of my friends began to eat, pouring some of the Mapo Tofu onto his plate, and he wasn't even halfway finished with the Mapo Tofu bowl (totally enough for another meal) when one of the servers - a blond girl - just comes over and takes it away. Not a word, not an \"excuse me, are you finished with that?\". She just comes, and takes it away. WTF? We were all pretty confused, so we asked another waitress - black hair, tattoos, piercings - about it. It was obvious that she didn't believe us when we told her that there was still a huge portion of it left, until the blond waitress who took it away came by and said, \"Oh yeah, there was still LOTS of it left.\" \n\nUhm, then why did you take it away in the first place?!?\n\nSo, the other waitress with the piercings says, \"Oh, I sincerely apologize for that. Unfortunately, the kitchen is closed...\" She was not apologetic at all. \n\nAfter she said that, we just sort of stared at each other. Naturally, in any restaurant, you would expect the waitress to be like, \"Oh hey, since we accidentally took your entire plate of food without asking and just threw it away, we'll leave that dish off the check.\"\n\nInstead, what she said was: \"We can take that dish off the check. Or, instead, if you think 'you had your fill' and think we 'deserve to get paid for the food that you ate', you can 'pay for the entire meal' as well.\"\n\nI was reading some of the previous reviews, and it looks like this sort of experience - where the waiter and waitresses just take away your food to force you to leave - is not novel. If you close at 10:30pm and would like us to leave by then, all you have to do is ASK NICELY, instead of TAKING AWAY OUR FOOD AND THROWING without asking.\n\n....... I can't even write this review anymore. Getting angry again. \n\nThe experience leaves a nasty taste in my mouth, no matter how good the food was. It wasn't even that great, by the way.

First, the ambience. I realize it's a small place and seats are a commodity, but it doesn't make for a comfortable atmosphere when you're wedged in a corner, with the table a hands length away and no privacy. That's the very reason the young server dumped the appetizers on the leg of a person in our party, and the jacket of the table next to us. It wasn't as if he was incompetent, it's most likely he's not a circus tight roper who can miraculously see in the dark! A little more lights please! Just a little! I'd like to see those paper dragons looming large over our heads before they spray fire. Next, the music. Okay, maybe I'm a bit older than some of the crowd, but EDM in a restaurant that is played in an already small location is irritating as hell! The very fact that I know what EDM is shows I'm not adverse to hip music at a restaurant, but how about background lounge jazz, or something that lends to relaxing rather than trying to read lips in a closet? Next, the food. I had the veggie Ma Po Tofu or is that Po Me? It looked delicious! But I think they borrowed half the salt on the city to make this dish! If I could have tasted my tofu or veggies over the salt, I would have eaten more than three bites. My friend had a veggie dish with pastrami. He loves meat. He hated this! I had a bite, and thought the pastrami tasted like a chopped up baseball glove in salted veggies. Yes, the salt! Ughh! Lastly, I will commend them for their dumplings, even though the sour cream is questionable. That's one step above mayonnaise, so I wouldn't call it creative.

I really think it's about picking the right dishes here.  I did come across the similar tingly spicy sensation as last time but it wasn't as prominent.  One of my friends was more sensitive to it so stayed away from the mapo tofu that she sensed it was coming from.  But my other friend and I fully enjoyed the spicy tofu dish.  We also LOVED the sizziling cumin lamb dish that had peppers in it but not as spicy to me.  The dish was so aromatic it filled the room and the lamb was absolutely tender..falling off the bone.  Our smaller dish came out later which was strange to us but didnt' disappoint.  We ordered the pork belly which was mouthwatering.  It was strange that it had coconut flakes on top but some how it really worked once you gave it a try.  \n\nOverall I think the dishes I had this time around was a lot better than I had before...and I liked this place better because of it.

I also like that most of the appetizers are large enough to be an entree for one.

All in all it was a pretty good meal. I would give it about 3 1/2 stars. After seeing what other people loved on yelp I went with a chicken dish that was pretty good. My complaint, which happens often in Chinese restaurants, is when other vegetables are added or substituted for those that describe the item on the menu. A.k.a. you gave me potatoes when you said it was cauliflower. Potatoes and cauliflower are nowhere close to the same type of item. Potatoes are from the plant family Solanaceae or nightshade, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae , and many people have an allergic or inflammatory response to eating plants in this family, even if they don't realize it. For those of us who have chronic medical conditions that include inflammation this is something we try to avoid. Don't get me wrong I ate a couple of the potatoes and they were delicious. But why so many? They pretty much where the secondary ingredient to my dish if not the primary one. What I will say is the chicken was moist, I hardly ever eat chicken breasts because it is dry it has no flavor, but this chicken was quite the opposite. My boyfriend enjoyed his Beef and broccoli quite a bit. We both like the pickles we tried but decided they were more of a novelty and something we wouldn't order again. The food certainly had quite a bit of spice even at a mild level, but this was to be expected by me. Luckily I didn't go pick up the food, but with my boyfriend tried to pick the food up I guess they told him they didn't have the order at all, he said the restaurant was very busy it was Friday night, after waiting a few minutes the order magically manifested, it was probably back there all along.", "author": "Coco J."}

I really loved what they did with the tofu; they sliced it very thinly so it was like long, wide noodles. I'd skip next time though.\n\nThree Cooked Bacon and Rice Cakes (Vegetarian Option) - AMAZING. We actually had to ask the server if we got actual bacon because the fake meat, which appeared to be made in-house, looked and smelled too good to be true. Lots of smokey/spicy flavors, which we loved. It balanced well with the noodles...\n\nEgg-Egg Noodles: DROOL. My husband, a ginger-phobe, loved these. I don't see what other reviewers are saying about this dish having too much ginger.  It was creamy from the egg, fresh and bright from the ginger and scallion, and I couldn't stop eating it. \n\nI didn't mind the dark, hipster ambiance whatsoever. I actually found myself enjoying the novelty of having Busta Rhymes serenade me through my foodgasm. Who knew?\n\nTry it. Ask your server for suggestions. Don't hate.

We ordered their long beans, which were far too overly salted and spicy. I can deal with an overload of spiciness but not with an overload of sodium. However, we ordered the cumin lamb dish and my friend and I both really enjoyed it. It came on a sizzling iron platter along with onions and carrots.\n\nWe also got 2 beers and the total came out to $42. I definitely wan't to come back and try the other dishes next time. It's not the best but if you're craving a meal with extreme flavor and spice you've found the right place.", "author": "Angela K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-22", "description": "You know what, I really like Mission Chinese Food.\n\nIt's not Chinese food, and you probably shouldn't compare it to the hundreds of authentic Chinese restaurants in the City.  Rather, you should view Mission Chinese Food for what it really is: Chinese-inspired food, with a smattering of influences from other Asian cuisines, all uniquely thrown together in a setting that is 100% Mission.  Take it for what it is, and you may actually enjoy your meal.  But definitely avoid the temptation to compare it to real Chinese food.\n\nAs for the actual dishes, here's some stuff I tried and my thoughts:\n\n+ Tiger rolls: a bunch of veggies in a rice noodle roll; this is reminiscent of Vietnamese spring rolls, but with a twist.  Tasty and refreshing. \n\n+ Szechuan Pickles: nice appetizer dish, lots of spice and kick, the peanuts are a great addition for taste and texture\n\n+ Tea-smoked eel: this is similar to the Tiger Roll in that you have some kind of veggie and, in this case, meat filling in a rice noodle roll.  Pretty tasty stuff.\n\n+ Mapo tofu: super spicy, HUGE portions, but overall just okay. I wasn't wowed by this dish.  Even if I'm not comparing it to \"real\" mapo tofu, this is still kind of a lackluster dish, one that you can probably pass over.\n\n+ Thrice cooked bacon: now THIS was a stellar dish.  They stir fry rice ovalettes with a mix of vegetables, spices, tofu skin, and more.  What you have is a flavorful, spicy, chewy, and delicious dish that packs a lot of punch into each bite.  Loved this dish. \n\n+ Salt cod fried rice: now, I know I said I wouldn't be comparing the food here to \"real\" Chinese food, but a dish like this begs to be compared to the real thing because it IS the real thing.  This is the standard salty fish fried rice that is found in almost all Chinese restaurants, and Mission Chinese Food doesn't try to do its own hipsterized version of it.  Rather, they do the real thing, and it's a decent version, but nothing too special.  I liked it, but it's a pretty standard version.\n\n+ Pork belly: wow, SO fatty, but I liked it a lot.  The crispiness of the skin is delightful, though the amount of fat on this thing is kind of frightening.  But that's also why this dish is good.  But be warned: lots of grease!\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised by how generous the portions are - the dishes are just as big as what you'd find in an authentic Chinese restaurant, which, if you've been to one, you'll know that dishes in Chinese restaurants come with very generous portions.  \n\nWhat else...food comes quickly, the place has a very \"Mission\" feel, there's usually a wait but it's not atrocious (we came here around 8pm on a Friday night and probably only waited about 15-20 minutes), it's kind of loud but not unbearably so, prices are fair though a couple dollars above standard Chinese restaurant prices.  \n\nA unique eating experience, and I would certainly recommend this place.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I had a late flight in so this was the perfect spot to call in a pick up order.\n\nThrice cooked pork ($11/5 stars) - Chewy rice cakes and bacon practically, but I definitely didn't care for the biter melon. Thankfully you can just remove those pieces without disturbing the rest of the dish.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice ($10/4 stars) - Large portion and pretty much what you can expect\n\nSmoked Beef Brisket Soup Noodles ($12/3 stars) - Brisket was really good - fatty and flavorful. Noodles were soggy, but to be fair, we ordered to-go. There were virtually NO stewed carrots (which is why we ordered this dish in the first place). Don't expect typical beef noodle soup, because the flavor is completely different here.\n\nSavory Egg Custard ($12/ 3 stars) - Super small bowl of steamed egg with uni. The boy didn't think the fruit mixed in was very palatable. \n\nWe'll definitely be back to try some of the other items, as I'm hoping that we just ordered wrong.", "author": "Jessalyn C."}

Not only was the wait one-fifth of the time in NYC (and the dining rooms were of comparable sizes), but the food was SO much better!!  I ordered two of the same dishes as I had in NYC (the egg egg noodles and the salt cod fried rice), as well as a few dishes they don't have on the NYC menu and the overall experience and food in SF was far superior.\n\nYou can read my other review for Mission Chinese NYC to read my comments on the egg egg noodles (get them!) and salt cod fried rice (skip it!  There's no cod in the dish! We found one measly, minuscule piece, although it was a lot less sweet than the one I had in NYC).  For other dishes I ordered that they don't have in NYC:\n\n1) The tiki pork belly - full disclosure, they have a short-rib version in NYC: MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS.  It was perfectly braised, nice and fatty, and not overly sweet. I didn't really understand the coconut shavings on the top though - I could've done without.\n\n2)  the savory egg custard - AHH NYC Mission Chinese why can't you have this on your menu?!?!  Uni and smoked trout roe on top of a chilled egg custard? ZOMG i'm seriously in heaven. I basically ate all of it and my dining partner only got a tiny bite.  I've been really into uni lately, and theirs was fresh and creamy. The roe added some nice pops of salty goodness.\n\n3) The sliced peanut noodles - again, NYC why are you so inferior?! Get these on your menu! Love the delicious rice noodles bathed in rich peanut sauce. So amazing.\n\nMy assessment is: shorter wait, better food, less pretentious.", "author": "Angel H."}

Having passed by before, once on a Wednesday (closed) and another time (Slammed), some out of town friends wanted to give it another try. We went around 6:45 on a Sunday and the line seemed a lot shorter than usual, and we only waited about 15-20 minutes for a table. \n\nThe restaurant is very dark and the tables are close together, but it smelled absolutely fabulous inside, a deep but delicious spicy aroma. The music was pretty loud and very 80s, and I noticed most of the wait staff were in fact non-Asian which is rare for a Chinese restaurant.\n\nThe menu is relatively short and simple which I appreciated. We skipped the cold appetizers and went straight to ordering. The 4 of us shared:\n- Thrice cooked bacon\n- Mongolian Long Beans\n- Wild Pepper Leaves\n- Veal\n- Chicken wings\n\nThe wild pepper leaves are a definite pass but everything else was really good. I should warn you, the food here is SPICY. The chicken wings were literally covered in a bed of those dried hot peppers though were themselves edible and ironically one of the least spicy things we ate. The chicken wings tasted of Chinese 5 spice powder and were meaty and fresh. The bacon dish was very tasty, and I think I liked the veal most of all which was a combination of fatty and well done. The long beans were also quite good and we wish had arrived earlier in the meal. We shared a few rice bowls and some tea. \n\nA unique interesting and tasty place.", "author": "Jordan C."}

I've heard the wait can be long.  For us, it was about a smoke's worth of a wait.\n\nOur server had a very casual style.  But he was effective and polite.  His personality kind of went with the place.  Everything happens at a pretty quick pace.  This is not a long drawn out dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance is kind of something I almost missed.  It was super busy and we were seated in a corner upfront.  From what I did catch,  it comes in just a dime over being a dive. It is also set up to squeeze in as many diners as possible.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/bd3dre2\n\nThis is one of those meals where I did not order and I did not pay.  One friend ordered and the other one picked up the check.  I didn't even really see a menu.  Hooray for free food.  However, it does mean I may not be 100% accurate on the names of the dishes.\n\nThe food ranged from good to very good.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami - This was probably my favourite dish.  It just came together very well.  A lot of time strong east-west fusion just blows up in some kind of clash of tastes.  The strong falvour of the pastrami really popped but didn't dominate the dish.  For me, this one worked!\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/aargdlz\n\nBeef A L'orange - This was a good dish.  But it was kind of basic.  It was well executed but didn't stand out.  I do like the flavour of orange with beef though.  Plus, the beef was pretty tender.  \n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/a6rw59q\n\nSpicy Green Bean - If you've read any of my reviews, you will know that I am not the huge lover of greens. But I did dig these.  The beans were cooked perfectly and then there was the heat.  There is nothing bland about this batch of beans.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/afsamo6\n\nSalt Cod Rice - This is another dish that worked against my own personal bias.  I've never been a huge salt cod fan.  But the flavor of the cod was restrained and the rice served as a great platform the dish.  It worked and I really enjoyed it.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ba3e8y4\n\nChicken Wings with peppers - I guess this is a Schezwan take on chicken wings.  These are wings buried under a bed of peppers.  They do pick up some heat but it is not too over the top.  I just cried little.  For me, this dish was good but certainly wouldn't make any of my top ten lists for chicken wings.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/bzme2np\n\nOverall, this is a fun and slightly adventurous dining experience.  There is a good energy to the place with lots of folks enjoying their food in a relatively cramped environment.  The food is good and trying some different things.  Most of it works but I am not sure any of it is truly mind-blowing.  It is worth a try and, for me, might be warrant a second visit.  It squeaked out four stars but that was with a little bit of a round up.", "author": "Mark D."}

However, by the time we left, there was a decent sized crowd waiting outside for tables. \n\nWe got the tea smoked eel, Kung pao pastrami, salt cod fried rice, & strawberry coconut mochi. Of the 4 dishes, my favorite was the tea smoked eel.

Little did we know what we were in for.\n\nAs others have mentioned, this is not your typical Chinese restaurant. The owner just took Chinese food and did his own thing with it. I have no problems with that. We also didn't mind that most of the dishes we ordered were so spicy. But it seemed that all of the spicy dishes had the same overall taste; a little more variety in the flavors would have been nice.\n\nHaving said that, our favorites dishes of the night were the Thrice Cooked Bacon (great combination of texture from the bacon and rice cakes, though the bacon could have been thicker), Sizzling Cumin Lamb (though a bit overcooked), and the Salt Cod Fried Rice (which we ordered three of to neutralize the spiciness from all the other dishes). The \"Explosive\" Chicken Wings were pretty good too, but compared to the other spicy dishes, this was actually quite tame, so don't be too intimidated by all peppers that cover the wings.\n\nThe Ma Po Tofu, Stir-fried Sweet Peas, and General Tso's Veal Rib were all decent, but again, the redundant spices just made the overall experience a bit uninteresting.

I'm really spontaneous and not very good at making far out plans. Hence, If i did ever decide to eat a Michelin star restaurant I probably won't have the patience or memory to make a reservation half a year in advance and remember to show up to it. I rather come at 10pm when the place is closing down and try to sneak in a service. \n\nBut anyways, I digress again.I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 5 and waited about 30 minutes for a table.

However, it seems to be another example of a place overrun by long lines of hipsters.\n\nAfter a long wait for a table, we finally managed to get seated in the super cramped, dimly lit, dining room. We shared a few dishes including the salted cod fried rice, beef noodle soup, thrice cooked bacon, stir fried mung beans, Hainanese chicken rice, and their sea urchin custard. The fried rice and chicken rice were really uninspiring and a bit boring. The bacon and mung beans were so spicy that they were nearly inedible. Every bite was like eating fire! The bacon itself was nicely done, although I'm not sure why it had to be cooked three times. I bit into the single piece of bitter melon in the bacon too, which was pretty much raw and killed my palette after that. The sea urchin custard was an interesting concoction but ultimately wasn't special enough or delicious enough to make the meal overly memorable. The high point of the meal was the beef soup, which was served with crepe noodles instead of egg or wide rice noodles. Definitely a pleasant surprise.\n\nAll in all, I was seriously disappointed by the famous Mission Chinese Food. Prices aren't insane and I will grant that food quality was much better than at most Chinese restaurants, but otherwise it didn't live up to the hipster hype.

We miss it when we are out of town. It's innovative without losing authenticity. I am Chinese ethnic and me and my Taiwanese friend from New York City think this is *the best* Ma Po Tofu we ever ate in the world. \n\nHere is the list of our favorites: \n1. smashed cucumbers (it took us a long time to figure out the dressing... so fragrant; garnished with subtle red peppers), \n2. braised pea leaves (love the green, love the garlic, love the tofu -- or thin-sliced vegetarian fish-cakes; love the peppers; love the soup); \n3. Ma Po Tofu -- the best I've ever had: spicy (real Sichuan huajiao or flower-pepper) yet tasty; non-oily yet authentic (we usually get the one without pork)\n4. Relatively new on the menu: banquet chicken -- definitely get it if it's available. A true delight.\n\nOh, I must write about the deco: It's funky, or, kitsch: pink giant dragon over your head (like a dinosaur skeleton in the ceiling of a museum?), a portrait of the General Gao (a legend for American Chinese food?!) guarding over the kitchen door, planked by two sidewalls of kitschy paintings of \"the\" Chinese cultural icons. If you get a chance, try visit their bathroom in the back. There is nothing special about the bathroom. What's special is the journey through the kitchen on your way to the bathroom: You walk out of the dark dinning room of an Anglo-American setting filled with mostly non-Chinese hipster customers and staff, and find yourself in a totally Chinese working environment -- Asian staff and Chinese characters on the cardboard boxes, and even Chinese music (I think I heard it once). A clash of the world?\n\nThe best way to describe the atmosphere is that it's like being in the early movies of Wong Kar-wai, for example, Chungking Express, when Wong was still the most talented. With this said, not everyone likes early Wong Kar-wai. So better warn your prissy friends about the adventure before you go.", "author": "Julia H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-03", "description": "Sorry, hype or not, this is not good food, Chinese, Japanese or American Knees. I hardly ever crave Chinese food the way I crave other foods, so I had low expectations and hype was not a factor for me.  It might be for you. I do believe good food is good food, even if you want to question it's authenticity.  Likewise, something can be authentic and taste shitty... and be authentically shitty.\n\nI feel like they take essentially traditional Chinese dishes and add some French words--not ingredients--in there; e.g., escolar \"confit\" for the salt cod fried rice, \"mirepoix\" in the beef brisket noodle soup.  Don't be mistaken - this isn't Asian fusion.  They're just applying French terms here at Mission La Cuisine Chinoise. ...See what I did there?\n\nWhile the flavors are primarily Szechuan, you can play a good game of \"What Doesn't Belong?\" with their menu.  The menu changes, but based on the one currently online, here are some of the answers: sea urchin, eel, cumin, and cardamom.  \n\nEverything was a combination of oily, salty, spicy, or sour, or all of the above.  If that sounds good to you, this is your spot!  \n\nTheir website is full of warning signs. Their logo is a rickshaw and there is a ninja delivering a flying kick across the middle of the page. That ninja kicked me in the face and flew away.  IT IS TAUNTING ME.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, what MCF has taught me is that if I didn't hear about a Chinese place from a fobby relative, I should expect my meal to be an expensive version of Panda Express.  I'm kidding.  That's not fair to Panda Express.\n\nWhat I can say is that food comes fast.  The six of us ordered a ton of things, and I can't remember them all.  Here's the breakdown, starting with the good stuff:\n\n26) SMOKED BEEF BRISKET SOUP NOODLES - $12\nCHEUNG FUN, MIRE POIX,BOK CHOY, CARDAMOM BROTH\n\nHands down the best dish of the night.  This was actually good and using cheung fun as the noodle was interesting.  I would love if they used hand cut noodle instead.  It couldn't quite redeem the experience, but if I had eaten only this dish, I would've come back for other dishes with high expectations.  It tastes like the pan-fried noodle soup at Turtle Tower (#6 Ph B\u00f2 \u00c1p Cho Nc) and Taiwanese beef noodle soup (niu ro mien) had a baby.  And that Taiwanese Vietnamese baby is MCF's smoked brisket soup noodles.  This is the only dish I'd come back for.  \n\n\nXX) PORK BELLY - $XX\n\nThis isn't on the website, so I don't have the exact menu info.  We had their pork belly with pineapple and cucumber.  It was pretty good but way too fatty.  One of the pieces of pork belly was pure fat, zero meat.  That's a ripoff.  And gross. \n\n\nXX) SHORT RIBS - $XX\n\nThis was okay; a few folks at the table complained that it was fatty, but my piece was tender off the bone and decent.\n\n\n21)    SHANGHAINESE CHOW MEIN - $12\nPULLED PORK TROTTER, ROCK SHRIMP, PICKLED MUSTARD GREENS, NAPA CABBAGE\n\nThis was one of the better dishes of the evening, and I feel like all it did was taste like chow mein from a decent Chinese restaurant.  Umm, good job?\n\n\n22) SALT COD FRIED RICE - $10\nESCOLAR CONFIT,CHINESE SAUSAGE, EGG,SCALLION\n\nThis one, I have mixed feelings about.  While the pieces of cod were larger than the traditional dish (a nice change), there was nary a Chinese sausage to be found in the fried rice.  Perhaps they forgot about it.  I don't have a problem with that.  But I ate a lot of salt cod and chicken fried rice growing up.  That was the dish I would order.  It's supposed to be small pieces of cod with pieces of chicken (in this case, sausage).  On its own... it seemed lacking.  This was also one of the better dishes... and this was just just average.\n\n\n16)   MA PO TOFU - $11\nGROUND KUROBUTA PORK SHOULDER,SZECHUAN PEPPERCORN, CHILl OIL, STEAMED RICE\n\nToo spicy and pretty sour.  Not much to say about this dish, because I don't really eat this one often. Enough to have had better. \n\n\n23) SIZZLING CUMIN LAMB - $13\nSALT & PEPPERED LAMB BELLY, CHILl-PICKLED LONG BEANS\n\nI ate this just because it had been ordered by our group.  The whole restaurant smells like this dish so it must be popular.  Cumin also smells that strong.\n\nSTEAMED RICE\n\nDry as the desert.  It tasted like day old rice, which is perfect for fried rice but not so great for steamed rice.\n\n\nCHICKEN WINGS\n\nStraight inedible. So, so salty. Many of us left this after one bite.", "author": "Erika C."}

We wanted to pre game at my friend's house with some vino and Mission Chinese. Thank goodness they delivered to the inner Richmond, though they said if she had lived just a few blocks out, they wouldn't have delivered.\n\nA Friday in Lent called for many seafood dishes and only one that was allowed to have meat: the rock cod fried rice which was adorned with slices of chinese sausage. I begrudgingly set those morsels aside on my plate while I enjoyed the fried rice. Another favorite was the Mongolian long beans. I'm a big fan of mouth burning heat and this was right up my alley. The beans were perfectly saut\u00e9ed in chili goodness. I ate the little slices of green chili like they were prizes. While I reveled in the delicious, hurts-so-good heat, my counterparts were in agony from the whooshing sounds coming their way - failed attempts in trying to cool their scorched palates.\n\nAnother favorite of mine was the shanghainese chow mein. Noooooodles! Big fat noodles that were chewy and absorbed all the yummy sauce filled with notes of shrimp. Loved the mustard greens and and napa cabbage.\n\nI didn't really care for tiger salad. I didn't taste roasted seaweed. What I did taste was mocked Fresh Express mixed greens salad with raddichio added wrapped in rice paper. The chili sauce was mostly chili oil with absolutely no punch. \n\nOverall, a belly rubbing, satisfying dinner night in. We didn't end up going out that night.

Eel had a touch of sweetness and the celery gave it a fresh flavor, although the amount of celery was a little excessive. Both interesting and unique with a fun play on textures. Great w/ soy sauce, just wished the celery flavor didn't overpower the dish.\n\nTHRICE COOKED BACON: The name is a little misleading. It's basically just spicy rice cakes. You get a lot of rice cakes and a very VERY minimal amount of bacon.

I was pleasantly surprised late one evening at work that we had ordered delivery from them. \n\nNow I didn't expect complete authenticity; especially since it's a place white friends rave to me as having really authentic Chinese food. It's the equivalent of me telling you that the McChicken here tastes just as good as the ones I had at McDonalds in Asia. It's a hipster take on Chinese food with a mishmash of styles from the different regions. \n\nThe salt cod fried rice was a standout. It's a staple dish that I like at many Chinese eateries but Mission elevates it with the addition of sweet Chinese sausage. The rice cakes in the thrice cooked bacon reminded me of a dish my grandma used to make only saltier. Still, it was a nice nostalgic trip for me.\n\nI thought the mapo tofu was a little too heavy handed on the chili oil and light on the preserved black beans. Still tasty though albeit spicy. The gai lan with beef cheek is a nice play on beef and broccoli. Taste about the same but I like gai lan more so points there. \n\nWe had a couple of other dishes too but I didn't really remember them much. One observation after the meal was that I was absolutely parched. You need water for this heavy meal. Still it's decent.

Not everything is spicy but if you think it might be spicy, it's spicier than that. Soooo Good. Thrice cooked bacon, wings, pastrami, and salted cod fried rice are the only items you need. And sake and beer to cool the burn. You're welcome.", "author": "Heather M."}

If the food wasn't so good, I probably wouldn't come here though, because the place is kind of dirty and the last time I went the customer service was less than satisfactory.\n\nI had been waiting for about 10 minutes, having put my name on the list, when a group of 4 walked up and immediately got seated. I asked the kid (wearing flannel and hair that looked like it had never seen shampoo or a brush) why I'm being skipped and his response was \"We have plenty of room.\" \n\nWrong answer bro. The correct response is \"I'm sorry sir, I'll seat you right away.\" If you have a wait list, don't skip people. Work it in the correct order, it's a simple thing.\n\nDouchy waitstaff aside, the food is super good.", "author": "Tyson H."}

Was not disappointed.\n\nI had the Tiki Pork belly which was sinfully good.  It was a little bit crispy on the outside and tender soft on the inside. It was a mixture of sweet and tangy pork, and soy nutty goodness.   The pork belly melts in your mouth.  This is a must have item and for me the best dish of the evening.\nWife had the Broccoli Beef Brisket with Smoked Oyster Sauce.  It was outstanding, large, and juicy.  It was so good; she didn't want to share her plate.  \nWe also tried the Salt Cod Fried Rice.  Most yelpers rave about it, but for me it was okay.  Maybe slightly on the bland side and left me wishing there was more Chinese sausage or pieces that weren't paper thin.  Maybe, I'll try it next time to make sure.  \nI also ordered the Thrice Cooked bacon.  It was S-P-I-C-Y, delicious, and definitely unique in flavor with the bitter melon, tofu, bacon, and hot peppers.  It was unusually good.  \n\nOur waitress was helpful in suggesting what items to order.  She was friendly, cute, and the service was excellent.  It seemed like all of the waitresses had tattoos, super friendly, and helpful.  \n\nThe restaurant is in a slightly seedy neighborhood with a couple of homeless people sprinkled here and there.  \nThe ambience inside the restaurant was hip with some type of cool rock music playing in the background.  The lighting was dim and the trip to the restroom with through the kitchen.  The cooks were working fast and not smiling.  That's fine with me because their food was delicious!  Overall, I definitely recommend Mission Chinese.  It's unique food that's worth the trip.  Plus, they deliver all over SF.", "author": "Vinh B."}

Somewhere between ethnic and hipster with shabby-chic touches beneath a festive dragon and garbled punk playing a bit too loudly it was towards the front of the restaurant that I requested to be sat and with a brief perusal of the menu my order was set - a mere twelve minutes from seating to the arrival of three plates from a service staff pleasant, though perfunctory at best.  Obviously focusing on the classics for my first bites of Bowien's cuisine it was with the \"3x Cooked Bacon\" that my tasting began and with a notable burn on my lips even as I avoided the whole Szechuan peppers the dish certainly shined - the pork's saline sapor juxtaposing bitter melon as discs of rice cake soaked up an elixir of fat, aromatics, and heat.  Moving next to salt cod, one of my favorite foods, served in the fashion of fried rice perhaps it was an effect of the dish that had preceded it or simply a case of inflated expectations but overall the whole plate tasted bland - a trend thankfully not carried over to the crunchy spring rolls who succeeded everywhere the rice had not as bold fish flavors played point/counterpoint with notes of smoke, saline, and sweet while raw vegetable added just enough texture to make the whole plate not only fresh, but also surprisingly light - something not exactly prominent elsewhere on the Mission Chinese menu.", "author": "Michael U."}

You can get a simpler, better version of this at HK Lounge or normal Chinese takeout places.\n\nSpicy Mongolian Steak Chow Mein: The steak was tender and grilled perfectly, but there was not enough meat and the \"Mongolian\" flavor was little more than Sriracha sauce. \n\nBraised Pea Leaves: There were plenty of interesting ingredients in this dish (including pumpkin slices), but I think too much thought went into being \"experimental\" and not into making a good, solid broth.

Here's a quick breakdown on items I've tried:\n\nTiger salad - not what I expected, but it's literally greens rolled up within a noodle\nTea smoked eel - unexpectedly wrapped in rice noodle along with ham hock and hoisin sauce, but surprisingly very good; looks like a smaller version of the tiger salad.\nPork belly - fried and crispy, but not as tender as I would have liked\nExplosive fried chicken - Fried chicken buried beneath a pile of hot spicy red peppers; only ok\nHot and sour rib tips - Very tender and saucy\nStir fried pork jowl - Nothing special for me\nMa po tofu - A bit too spicy for my taste\nSalt cod fried rice - Nothing special\nKung pao pastrami - Nice smoky flavor of the pastrami along with a mixture of spices; this dish grew on me\nSizzling cumin lamb - One of my favorites; the lamb is really tender\nSmoked beef brisket soup noodles - The flavor was a bit too smoky.\n\nOverall, I was pretty intrigued by the unique menu items. Definitely some hit and misses. It's a nice place to bring people looking for a different spin on traditional Chinese and Szechuan dishes.", "author": "Rick T."}

So tender and the sauce is perfect), beef chow mein, thrice cooked bacon, dumplings, and the pastrami. Danny Bowien knows how to make his chinese food unique but still flavorful. The food is pretty spicy so prepare yourself! But I loved it. I'm coming back here next time for a plate of fried rice.. For one.", "author": "Madalena T."}

Friendly, efficient service and we were seated right on time (we were lucky enough to score a reservation, because they they still have long lines even on a Thursday in the rain). I ordered the smashed cucumbers to start which were interesting and tasty even though it made my lips numb. Three main dishes: Thrice cooked pork, very flavorful and the rice cakes were a good texture. The Kung Pao Pastrami was nice and spicy and the dark Matcha noodles complimented the hotter dishes perfectly. Strangely this was my first adventure to this hallowed establishment, and it did not disappoint. Plus we got a cozy seat right in the front window which was kinda romantic too.", "author": "Gary B."}

There are some that cater to Asian people and there are others that cater to non-Asian people. Lung Shan falls in neither of these categories. It is more Asian Fusion. All of the dishes are Chinese dishes but with a twist.\n\nThe dishes weren't bad. My gf and I had the smoked eel. the 3 times cooked pork with rice cakes, and the gourmet dumplings. All were okay. The smoke eel rolls were good. The celery inside it gave it a nice crunch but did not mix well with the other ingredients. The 3 times (twice cooked?) pork with rice cakes were okay. It was probably the best out of the three dishes. It was very spicy, which was not what I was expecting. The dumplings were flavorless. They put in sesame oil just to make it flavorful but it didn't do it for me. All of these dishes are close to Chinese food but you wouldn't see it anywhere in any other Chinese restaurant. \n\nThe ambiance was dark. The walls were all dark red. I get it, red means money according to tradition but you don't see any restaurants that have dark red walls anymore. I couldn't see much in the dark. We were squished in the corner with another group it was a little uncomfortable. \n\nThe service was okay, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't entirely very personable. The general crowd was filled with hipsters which is not a bad thing. We were the only Asian people in the restaurant.", "author": "Tako B."}

I mean ride and die, whenever I go back to China my grandpa makes me fried scorpions and my cousins and I go out to restos with four floor walk ups to eat intestines boiled in hot chili oil with loads of floating chilis on top. Whenever I eat that deliciousness it's seasoned with my TEARS because I'm crying about how I won't get anything like it back in the states. \n\nBut then there was Mission Chinese Food.\n\nOh, my, sweet, four dragons of PRC this place is magnificent. They cook Chinese SOUL food. Not that it's greasy and rich--- but it actually comes from the soul. Each taste for me is a lyrical memory that makes my mouth sing. \n\nI sometimes go by myself just to get the congee, there's some delicious strands and pieces of a shellfish, a delicious egg, tons of little crispy, chewy fat pieces and scallions. I mean, I can't remember the exact names of the toppings off the top of my head but I remember being so happy. So happy. SO HAPPY. (Holy crap, I wrote delicious too many times in that paragraph but that's just a testament to my extremely positive emotional reaction to this place). \n\nThis place is always jam packed and the people around me are always emitting moans of pleasure or gasping at the sheer deliciousness of their order. \n\nMy fiance takes me on dates here and we are tempted to order the General Tso's Veal Rib every time. It is so fucking good and comes with a brutal knife stabbed into it that is the culinary sign language for: FUCKING EAT ME and we FUCKING EAT IT. \n\nThe beer and drinks are priced like a real run-of-the-mill Chinese place. I've even seen crappier places charge more!\n\nPeople behind this place are very thoughtful and not obnoxious. I thought they'd be too kitchy-chic but they're actually just \"keeping it real.\"\n\nRegarding service, Chinese grandmas deliver the food speedily and will give you anything you want as long as you flag them down.

The richness of the eel, the sweetness of the hoisin sauce, and the saltiness of the cognac soy come together and master a perfect dance of complexity.\n\nThe sizzling cumin lamb is kinda like the Chengdu lamb dish from PF Chang's... except a million times better and not Americanized. It was some of the tenderest lamb I've ever had, accompanied by a light charred taste (which some don't like but I love), and a hint of sweetness and heartiness with dates. Loved the dates!\n\nMa po tofu was definitely great, but be warned: it's spicy even at medium. Large chunks of tofu and pork make it a solid dish.\n\nThis isn't a place you go to for decor (although it's charming in its own right).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-11", "description": "I think to a certain extent the amount you can appreciate Mission Chinese sort of depends on how much chinese food you eat. I eat a lot of chinese food so let's break it down.\n\nSmoked eel rolls - great, good smokey flavor with that crisp texture cut with the chang fun sauce and soft noodle. Very clever way to incorporate the flavors and textures.\n\nSalted Cod Fried rice - chinese people eat a lot of salty fish but somehow not like this. you'd think after all this time it would have been done but for some reason it hasn't which is weird because it's delicious. Also salty fish is one of those weird chinese flavors that if you're not raised on it, then it get's sort of weird.\n\nThrice cooked bacon - take on a classic shanghai style dish that normally comes with chicken. The bacon really works with the chewiness of the rice cakes, sort of gets you to chew the bacon longer which means you get to taste bacon longer. Score.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami - I thought it was over spiced but again the pop of the peppers both texturally and flavor wise matches pastrami pretty creatively and doesn't feel forced at all.\n\nTo elaborate on that point more, I used to have this real stigma against asian fusion food. It always tasted forced, like the chef was like ok, I have a western dish, how do i put something asian in it so i can sell this? Mission Chinese doesn't seem forced, in fact it almost tastes effortless, like it was obvious these dishes would work. That's not to say that I don't think they really put a lot of time to nail these things down. Rather it's how you want fusion to taste, effortless and natural, like these things always went together. \n\nSadly i've now moved out of SF and just found out they delivered.

Thinking everyone would be out of town we showed up with a group of 8 people - good thing one person canceled! Would they really have enforced the 8 person limit? After about a half hour wait we got the big round table in the back. The best thing about coming with a huge group is that you can order a lot of dishes to try. Our original plan, plotted during the long wait, was to order everything on the menu. After seeing it was 25 items we realized this was going to be physically difficult to eat that much food so we compromised and ordered all the cold dishes and selected a couple of hot dishes as well. \n\nI can't remember what appetizers were on the menu but the things I liked best were the Beijing Vinegar Peanuts, Szechuan Pickles and Savory Egg Custard (though it was too \"fishy\" for hubby).\n\nFor the hot dishes we ordered:\n\n* stir fried pork jowl and winter radishes - wow, woW, WOW! There wasn't that much pork jowl in the dish but the entire thing was permeated with a rich meat flavor. I don't know how they did it. I've never had radishes so good! I had seconds and thirds of radishes.\n\n* ma po tofu - I've had this before and it was just as good and just as hot. I mean seriously hot. I could barely eat a few spoonfuls. A lot of people at the table couldn't do more than just taste it.\n\n* thrice cooked bacon - I like rice cakes and the bitter melon is done really well, but this is not one of my favorite dishes. It just doesn't gel together for me.\n\n* tingly lamb noodle soup - a nice refreshing soup with thick noodles and tender, tasty lamb. It's a pretty big bowl. Enough for all 8 of us.\n\n* wild pepper leaves - another WOW surprise. I don't know what wild pepper leaves are but they are tasty and slightly bitter. I like bitter greens so this was just up my alley. The soup is hot though it didn't stop me from having seconds.\n\nAll in all it was $45 per couple for a very full meal with leftovers.\n\nService was adequate. They were very good at the beginning, getting us drinks and taking the order. However, once the food started coming out it was super hard to flag anyone down to get refills or more rice. The food came out pretty steadily so we always had a lot of dishes on the table - almost faster than we could eat and clear the plates.", "author": "Jean K."}

Even the famed and revered Ferran Adria ate there after his recent talk in San Francisco. It's a place that I had wanted to try just to see what the hype was all about.\n\nAfter signing up on the waitlist and waiting an hour in the cold SF night, we got seated and perused the menu on what to order. We chose:\n\nRed Braised Pig Ear Terrine: I'm not a pig ear fan but was willing to try this just because it seemed different. This dish didn't win me over. The gelatinous aspic intermingling with the crunchy pig ear didn't appeal to my taste buds. My gag reflex yes.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice: Now this was more to my liking. I enjoyed the bits of salt cod, the thinly sliced Chinese sausage, and the \"breath of the dragon\". That char and smokiness in the food you get from a searing wok. It wasn't anything too different from what I've had at other Chinese restaurants, but it eased the pain of the terrine.\n\nBroccoli Beef Cheek: Cut up and sauteed Chinese broccoli covering up this huge, buttery beef cheek. There was also jewels of poached oysters spread throughout the dish. It was surf and turf I've never had before. And it is something I'll definitely order again.\n\nThrice Cooked Bacon: It's a popular dish that's ordered. Sliced rice cakes, onions, chili oil, black beans, and sliced bacon. The bacon was a bit chewy and tough. I expected it to be crispier so it was disappointing.\n\nSlow Cooked Char-Siu Pork Belly: This dish could give you a heart attack. The pork belly pieces were uber-fatty. It's something familiar to me as the Vietnamese have a similar dish to this. Tasty but I would up my Lipitor count before eating this. \n\n7 Chicken Wings w/ Explosive Chili Pepper: It is deceptive looking. You have these fried chicken wings covered with mounds of red hot chili peppers. You expect it to be mind alteringly numb, but in fact, there is only a mild tinge of heat that lingers for a while. I enjoyed the spice blend on the wings and these would be great to eat while watching any sports game.\n\nDid it meet the hype? I'm not so sure. Some dishes I felt could be at any Chinese restaurant. Some did stand out like the Broccoli Beef Cheek and 7 Chicken Wings. There were some other items we didn't get to try that I would have liked to. It'll have to be a 3 star review for now.", "author": "Randy T."}

You'll only be disappointed and unsatisfied.\n\nMission Chinese Food has been on my bookmark list since they opened.  After having an extremely horrible day, my friend told me to choose a restaurant and I came up with Mission Chinese Food because one of my friends also brought it up one time.\n\nRESERVATIONS:\nThere are no reservations.  Our party of five came here on a Thursday night.  The wait was about an hour or so.  When we were finally seated, we were seated adjacent to another party's table.  Also note, they do not accept parties larger than 8.\n\nFOOD:\n*Hainam Chicken Rice ($7) - Not good. I expected it be traditional with strips of chicken placed on top of the rice. Instead there was small pieces of shredded chicken mixed in with rice soaked in wine and lacked the traditional ginger flavor.\n*Thrice Cooked Bacon ($10.50) - The bacon was delicious and the rice cake and tofu skin added a nice touch to the dish.  However, there were too much onions and the still crunchy bitter melon wasn't cooked enough.\n*Westlake Rice Porridge ($11) - The best dish the night.  The mix of oxtail, crabmeat, green onions, cilantro, and topped with fried garlic was an almost homelike dish.\n*Ma Po Tofu ($11) - The dish wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good.  Although there was a generous amount of tofu soaked in spices, the dish seemed like it was missing something, but I can't place what.\n*Chicken Wings w/Explosive Peppers - Pass.  Although the chicken wings were mostly moist, it lacked flavoring and was overwhelmed with peppers.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe males (I'm assuming they were the owners) were friendly and helpful.  The female seemed as if she had a short attention span and would walk off if you couldn't give her an almost immediate answer.\n\nPARKING:\nMetered street parking which can be quite difficult to find.\n\nWill I be back?

We'd order the same thing, thrice cooked bacon and the fried cod rice, once a week. We even bought the book and made our own thrice cooked bacon dishes a few times. Tastes change as do restaurants over the years and we felt like we just weren't getting consistent meals there anymore.\n\nIt's become a special occasion for us to order MCF for pick up now, probably just once a month or so. The last order we got was the most disappointing yet and I don't think either of us are really in the mood to roll the MCF dice in hopes for a good meal anymore.\n\nThe balsamic vinegar peanuts we ordered as an appetizer had no vinegar at all. Instead it was just a little plastic bowl with some peanuts and 4 garlic cloves. We double checked the online menu to confirm the vinegar peanuts were still on there. I guess they just forgot to add it? \n\nThe Thrice Cooked Bacon, the most important part of our order, was almost half the size as usual. We often have enough left over for another small meal, but not this time. The ingredients didn't feel like they were cooked together very long either... more like they were just thrown together without letting the flavors mix. My wife referred to it as \"once cooked bacon\", which sort of nailed it. The flavor just wasn't there and much of the bacon seemed like it had been overheated and really tough to chew. The noodles were as good as usual, just bland. We'd had hit or miss meals before, but this just seemed like such a waste. It was the first time we'd had to go back out for more food to fill us up. \n\nThe Salt Cod Fried Rice seemed as good as usual though.\n\nI tried a couple times to reach out to MCF to let them know about our meal (there's no email on the site and no response via twitter). I've heard similar complaints from other long time fans of MCF, so I'm hoping the restaurant can make a come back.

In all honestly, being asian, I don't like my asian food to be messed around with too much, save for the occasional food truck endeavors. She mentioned that this place opens up at 5 PM every day and gets packed within couple minutes. I was pretty skeptical but whatever, we got to that area around 5:10 and there was a line outside the door. wtf right?\n\nAnyways, parking like anywhere around SF, was a bitch, especially in the mission area. Finally found a spot about 3 blocks away and had to walk in the rain and I'm thinking to myself, this place better be fukin' worth it...\n\nOn the outside, the restaurant looks real shitty, I'm just being honest. There's a sign that doesn't even say mission chinese food in fact, it's some other restaurant name and no glamorous designs whatsoever and inside the restaurant is very dark and tight quarters. They've opted to go with the traditional chinese lighting technique of using only lanterns and its dark as hell inside.\n\nBut out came the food and the waft of spicy dishes made the trip worth it and needless to say, all the dishes were delicious, especially the chicken wings. I don't think I've ever had wings with that particular flavoring, it's hard to describe but it's fukin good.\nQuarters are tight as mentioned so you probably be bumping elbows with strangers, but with food that good it's hard to complain, although it is a bit too dim inside. Bathrooms are way in the back and you needa walk past the entire kitchen, awkward.\n\nWould recommend for adventurous folk seeking something different than your typical asian fare.", "author": "Jason L."}

The chefs in the back must be Asian though because they know how to cook a mean sizzling cumin lamb. This is one of my favorite lamb dishes that I've tried recently.

For someone who is such a fan of San Francisco's culinary heaven, I decided to finally check Mission Chinese Food off the list. All day I had been anxiously waiting for 5pm to roll around the corner. I had spent some time earlier that afternoon reading the menu and found myself in a dilemma -- I had no idea what I was going to order. It all sounded so wonderful. I wanted to try it all!\n\nWe got there right when they opened and managed to grab a table immediately. Took another quick glance at the menu and we placed our order. We all knew we had to try to salt cod fried rice. It's the only thing I ever here anyone talk about it. When it got to the table we all just kind of stared at it. We were a bit confused as we saw zero salt cod in this \"godly\" dish.\n\n\"Maybe it's mixed it there somewhere?\" I took my chopsticks and stirred the fried rice around.\n\nNo salt cod.\n\n\"Well...does it at least taste salty?\" It didn't. No salt cod or hints of the mackerel confit. Something that should pack a punch with flavor. We sat there for a bit longer and looked through some photos of this dish on yelp and other sources which clearly showed that salt cod had been present in this dish once upon a time.\n\nI had never been served a dish before that left me so puzzled.\n\nWe waved down the waitress and asked her if this was indeed the \"Salt Cod\" Fried Rice or if we were given the wrong dish. She was quick to reply in the most unfriendly, condescending way and said this dish doesn't actually have pieces of salt cod in it and walked away. No care in the world about our experience at a restaurant that is supposedly one of the most important restaurants in America. \n\nThen in walks Danny Bowien himself. I glanced at him in disbelief and stared down at the \"salt cod\" fried rice, moving the rice to the edges of my plate as I'm still searching for this non-existent fish. As he walked by our table, a part of me so badly wanted to introduce myself and ask him to take a bite of this dish and see if he thought this was acceptable. Because I think he would say otherwise. \n\nWe also ordered the tea smoked eel, savory egg custard, and the tiki pork belly. The pork belly was truly the only thing I enjoyed.\n\nI just wish I had some salt cod in my salt cod fried rice. And maybe a server that actually cared.\n\nFarewell, Mission Chinese Food.

(chicken? can't remember. ) The food all seemed pretty standard Chinese fare except for the noodles - these were coated with pea puree and topped with a soft boiled egg. I don't know about other people, but I've never seen my parents/relatives/other Chinese people eat this dish or anything even similar. It was a little weird, since the rest of the dishes were pretty typical. The service was also very Americanized, though all of the chefs and workers in the back were Chinese.

Came for lunch again, and was maybe 25% full around 12:30 on a Saturday. Great time to go. Service was quick, with all the dishes out within 10-15 mins of us ordering. \n\n- Sour Chili Chicken: 60% chicken, 20% zucchini, and a little bit of potatoes and peppers. Not particularly flavorful, and somewhat dry chicken. Would not get it again.\n- Broccoli and beef brisket: 70% Chinese broccoli, and 30% beef. The chinese broccoli I'm a huge fan of, so that was nice. But maybe a bit heavy on that for most people. The beef was super super tender and juicy, though some of it pretty fatty, with one piece I got being ~entirely fat. Good and simple, likely to please many, but not standout.\n- Mongolian long beans: these have changed a little since I last had them a year ago or more. Less leeks now, and almost entirely long beans. Were about as spicy as I remembered them being (not a lot for me, but my tolerance is very high), though my friend had some trouble. There were some chili peppers mixed in there, so maybe that was why. Tasty and a solid staple, though apparently more for those who can stomach it.\n\nSo I wouldn't get the two meat dishes again probably, though I would the long beans, and a lesser experience in that way, but I purposefully ignored my favorites for new things, so I'll be back to my favorites (of which there are many) - pork jowl, cumin lamb, chicken wings, veal rib, pea leaves, and long beans.", "author": "Kris K."}

Don't be fooled-- Mission Chinese is in the old Lung Shan spot, but they have yet to change the signs. \n\n3 things: super spicy, super salty, super oily. Better skip Mission Chinese if you have a weak stomach or high blood pressure. I got the Ma Po Tofu... the seasoning was good, but intense. Again, if you have a weak stomach/palate, skip this place. The sauce, I speculate, was pure chili oil. Needless to say my stomach/intestines weren't too pleased with me post-meal, but it was yummy. Definitely get rice, and request extra water as you will be dehydrated from the sodium. My mom ordered the combo fried rice, and it was good, albeit simple, perhaps a tad bit overpriced. \n\nThe vibe is... well, Mission hipster at its finest, or worst, depending on who you are talking to. It's dim and the music is loud, good for a casual meal with friends, but if you're looking for something more intimate I'd look elsewhere. \n\nThe service is minimal & the food came out fast. I probably won't be a regular because a. it's quite heavy, b. it's not in my neighborhood, and c. i think i prefer Clement St. dim sum/Chinese (but i'm not sure you could compare the two) \n\nTry it out!

It was a little too spicy for my taste but overall packed full of flavor and had an interesting texture combo going on with the rice cakes.

Loved it.\n\nSquid Ink Noodle in Lamb Broth - (2/5) Disclaimer, I'm not a fan of lamb so my opinion is probably biased but this $14 plate was overpriced for what we got. Barely touched it and was a little too gamey for my taste. \n\nDefinitely worth seeing but there are better, more afforable Chinese restaurants in the city like San Tung.

My friend was kind enough to get take out for us.  Unfortunately, certain appealing dishes were available only for in restaurant dining (like a squid ink pasta!)\n\nGRANDMA'S SPICY LAMB DUMPLINGS: Slightly gamey, with a kick from chili oil; I could have done without the peanuts but really liked the pickles. \n\nTEA SMOKED EEL: Reminded me of the dim sum \"chang fen,\" but instead of shrimp or beef, it was smoked eel.  The eel itself was smoky and rich.  The Chinese celery added a nice crunch, but the celery was a little too pungent for the dish.  You definitely need to dip it in the soy sauce.  \n\nTIKI PORK BELLY: Kind of fusion-ish with the pineapple, coconut, and mandarin orange - like a tropical pork belly, with a little tiki umbrella and all. \n \nCHONGQING CHICKEN WINGS: Tons of red chilis on top, as well as chili oil - pretty explosive as they say.  The crispy beef tripe may actually be even better than the wings.  The spiciness can be numbing.\n\nSALT COD FRIED RICE:  Disappointing! I think this dish made it on the 7x7 list.  You can't really go wrong when you combine salted fish, chinese sausage, egg, and scallion with white rice.. unless there's essentially NO cod in the dish.  I had to add salt and chili sauce for more flavor.  I did like the jalapeno in it.\n\nKUNG PAO PASTRAMI: Tons of flavor and textures, nice kick, probably my favorite stir fry.  Definitely on the greasy side.  \n\nCUMIN LAMB RIBS: Done well, hickory smoked, and the accompaniments went well on the rice.  \n\nTHRICE COOKED BACON AND RICE CAKES: Stir fried rice cakes coated in bacon fat.  The bacon wasn't as strong as I expected, and it had lots of Szechuan pepper, but I actually hoped for more salt in this dish, too. \n\nMONGOLIAN LONG BEANS: Good flavor, very oily, lots of spices, didn't taste the horseradish.  \n\nMARKET GREENS: Kind of expensive ($12) for some stir fried baby bok choy, but it was the lightest dish of all, and I really needed vegetables not coated in oil.\n\nOverall, I was expecting for more flavor rather than just pure spiciness.  While I appreciate the creativity like with the kung pao pastrami, I thought they under-performed on more classic, signature dishes like the fried rice.   I think they also use less sugar than the average Chinese restaurant in SF; though they use just as much grease.   It's fun to try the various dishes, so it's better to have more people.  It's by no means a light meal. \n\nHonestly, I think the concept was cooler as a pop up restaurant.  Otherwise, it's pretty expensive for Chinese food and quite overrated.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

And some more beef pieces would've been nice.\n\nBut finally, the chicken wings... So. Good. It wasn't just stupid-spicy. It was tongue tingling, but sophisticated spicy. If you've had ma-la spice before, this is the restaurant's version of it. As I type this I am craving ma-la soup so much... (If anyone can recommend a great place I can have authentic ma-la soup please let me know!!)\n\nIn short, the ribs and wings I will definitely be re-ordering, and would recommend without any hesitation. The dumplings were good, but I would rather try something new next time, and the chow mein I would recommend against.", "author": "Katherine Y."}

That moment came Thursday between 6 and 7pm. Better late than never? Maybe not. Not all is well in Denmark. Impossible to believe the chef of this restaurant is getting any accolades. Seeeeeeerious quality control issues are at hand. \n\nEverything looked so good on the menu. With some recommendations from our waitress we still couldn't  narrow and ended ordering a large spread, which appeared in the following order:\n\n1. Tiger Salad: lettuce in a roll. I usually love raw and cooked; this left me wishing we were eating Vietnamese. Raw lettuce, wet rice noodle. \"Is that all there is?\"\n\n2. Stir-fried Sweet Peas: Was expecting new peas in pod as in \"typical\" Chinese fare, delicately saut\u00e9ed and bristling with complementary spices. Instead, a monster bowl overflowing with BB size peas, entirely conjuring a picture of our hero in Woyzeck, tortured with a diet solely of peas. \"Did you eat your peas?!? Did you eat your peas?!? Did you eat your peas?!?\"\n\n3. Thrice Cooked Bacon: Given the omni-love-a-thon of bacon these last few years, could this dish be considered original in any way? That said, the grease and salt component x-ed out all other flavor, including one of my favorite veggies, bitter melon, which normally serves as such a divine foil to meat.\n\n4. Sizzling Cumin Lamb: another favorite, cumin, completely disgraced by overuse, obliterating the other featured players in this dish, namely a lamb that sported an obese amount of fat over muscle. No sighting of either the figs or watercress that so seductively wooed us from the menu, presumably fatted, salted, charred and cumined to death beyond recognition.\n\n[Two minute warning: the grease and salt in the few bites we've actually eaten so far signal an S-O-S of major indigestion or worse, food poisoning, in the coming hours.]\n\n5. Tea-smoked eel: no tea, no smoke, no eel. Description should read: \"salted mush in a slimy noodle nestled in a salty sauce excusing itself as a spirited soy.\"\n...\nWhen we left around 8, still no lines waiting to get in. Maybe the rest of the world has been clued in already.\n\nConclusion: The worst meal in recent memory. James Beard should be rolling in his grave.", "author": "Kmc M."}

Sadly, the magic and excitement died just about as quickly as it started. We opened with the Chongqing chicken wings, described as having 'explosive chili'. I would agree with this description, if by 'explosive chili' one means 'overpowering Chinese 5 spice'.

Mission Chinese has been one of the most talked about restaurants in the Country recently.  I have honestly not kept up with the hype but finally decided to see what is so special about this place.\n\nMission Chinese was one of the original pop-up restaurants and appears to be cresting with the whole pop-up restaurant, food truck hype.  How long this will go on? I have no idea, but imagine your hole in the wall Chinese restaurant (and I mean a real hole in wall), add cool beats, turn down the lights, write a book and make some slight modifications to Chinese classic dishes (with varying degrees of success) and voia!  That is Mission Chinese in a nutshell.\n\nMission hipsters stand in line for the opportunity to be greeted rudely by the hostess who warns you sternly about the restaurants seating policy.  Hint to hostess: there are two ways to express a rule... one is the rude way and gets you a smaller tip and the other way that makes your customer feel that you are doing them a favor that gets you a bigger tip.\n\nThe true revolution here is the marketing which one can not dismiss.  The food was decent but not better than any number of local Chinese hole in the walls, e.g. Henry's Hunan.  Putting squid ink to color your noodles truly does not warrant the hype.\n\nNot to leave this review on a complete negative note.  The salt cod fried rice was cooked perfectly.

One bite, and I knew it was going to be a quick downward spiral. It was SO salty, there was barely any unagi in it and i am a fan on Chinese celery but it was just too tough and made it difficult to eat.\n\nThe rice- where was the salty cod? If I knew it was going to just be Chinese sausage rice, I would have made it myself. Definitely would not have paid 10 for a rice that costs less than 2 to make. \n\nThe tofu- chunks of tofu in an extremely oily, inedible slosh. We literally took the tofu out and wiped it down with a napkin. There was barely any pork belly in it- max two tiny pieces. No vegetables and seriously what the hell was that sauce? It was disgusting and I have no idea why people  order it... But props to you for tricking me. \n\nGod it was horrible and was such a waste of 2 hours...

I think that some of the individual dishes are fairly authentic but definitely not a traditional restaurant, as there is a wide variety of dishes, from handmade noodles, to fried rice and southern BBQ.  (err wut?) \n\nThe southern BBQ plate simply must be eaten.  It is authentic texas style slow smoked brisket and sausage... how strange, in a chinese place, but it was GOOD.  My wife, who grew up in Texas confirms, this is sadly one of the better BBQ joints in the bay area, and just for this one dish.  Crazy.  sweet and spicy sauce (a little sweeter than is typical of TX) but yum!  deep smoke rings on the brisket.  \n\nWe also had a lamb cheek noodle dish that was pure sichuan style.  YUM.  The bits of meat were all things that many westerners would just toss out or make into head cheese, but they are the best part of the animal, just the choice bits of meat, with the associated gristle, etc torn off already.  PACKED with flavor... this dish was no joke spicy as well.  Both of us were panting but kept going back for more, because it was not only spicy but extremely complex from the cilantro to the lamb, and the pungent sauce... and the noodles.  Perfection.  I could have eaten a whole portion of this, but I think my stomach lining may not have tolerated it.  I like spicy food and this was a perfect example of being spicy and tasty at the same time, not just spicy for the sake of being spicy.\n\nThe salt cod fried rice was fantastic too.  I mean, it's called SALT cod fried rice, you gotta expect it to be intensely salty.  This was some of the best fried rice I've had, it had a perfectly chewy texture with bits of crunchy rice and the salty mild fish flavor.  Surprisingly, this had a decent amount of depth to it, not just salty.  You could still taste the delicate cod flavors along with the various spices...  yum!\n\nOverall, I had a really positive experience here, but I can see how things may be difficult as it's fairly busy and service can be a touch spotty (but for the price, you really can't complain!)    \n\nI would probably have given this a 4.5 but I enjoyed it so much, I want to balance out some of the negative reviews...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-03", "description": "In the Ying and Yang of restaurant exploration, there is a balance between expectations and reality.  If the reality beats expectations, then it can be a glorious experience.  Over time and through additional experiences, you reach a kind of equilibrium.  I call it the realm of the \"old standby\", where although you may not be overly excited by the 10th visit, you are nevertheless never disappointed, and always leave happy.\n\nThen there's the other side, where expectations are so blown out of proportion, there is absolutely no way that reality can ever meet, let alone exceed, that level of anticipation and excitement.  This is quite simply not fair to the diner, or to the chef who may have had a completely different philosophy as to what his/her restaurant was all about.  In this era of fast media, instant gratification, and yes...user developed reviews (Yelp, I'm talking about you), we are all guilty of participating in, and exacerbating the situation.  Of this, I am also guilty.\n\nChef Bowein started Mission Chinese, from my understanding, to turn the traditional Chinese restaurant theme on its head...but do it tongue in cheek, or with a wink and a smile.  What can be more subversive than taking over a Chinese dive restaurant, giving it a secret name, that's not so secret, and meld Sichuan methodology and spices with non-Chinese ingredients like pastrami...yet give diners a real taste of what Sichuan food is really like.  Wow....my head just exploded thinking about it...\n\n...and that's the problem.  Already the expectations of being surprised or even shocked, it's really unachievable.\n\nI know that in the beginning, this all must have been subversive, if not revolutionary, if not for the fact that, especially in the Bay Area, a good chunk of us have had authentic Sichuan cuisine (or Hunan cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, etc.) so the particular riff on flavors has a familiarity to it that doesn't scream \"revolutionary\".  Notwithstanding that, I guess the intent was that the way it is all put together, and the \"atmospherics\" of the dining experience would give it a little cultural kick.  But I'm sure those aspects get enhanced by the 6th Tsingtao.\n\nTrust me, I like dives, but a little more light, and cleaner path to the restrooms, let alone cleaner restrooms, wouldn't hurt the dining experience or the cultural milieu.\n\nSo what's the bottom line:  Mapo Tofu:  has that characteristic tongue numbing of Sichuan peppercorns, but otherwise, is not surprising or revolutionary.  The Smashed Cucumbers in Garlic Sauce was surprisingly bland, with hardly a hint of garlic.  The Chongqing Chicken Wings were good...would go great with a couple of beers, but was also on the mild side for my taste (after all, this is Sichuan cooking we're talking about...this is spicy wings we're talking about).\n\nThe Kung Pao Pastrami was spicy, but exceedingly salty.  Being that pastrami is brined to begin with, careful salt control is a must.  It must have been missing on my visit.  The same went for the braised beef noodle soup...which was so salty, we had to add about a 1/2 glass of water to the soup...and ask anyone who knows me....I'm not gentle with my seasoning.\n\nI don't know what to say other than disappointed.  But I'm not sure I have the restaurant to blame or the concept itself.  The fact is, Chef Bowein has blown-up, to use a new media phrase, and there's no going back....not even to the nascent days of Mission Chinese's opening.  Whatever was there in the beginning has now been lost in the morass of expectations, and you can't ever get that back.  On the other hand, had this been a restaurant opening in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California, I don't think Anthony Bourdain would have come calling.  So you got to take what you can take and run with it.  More power to you.\n\nPut it in the Mission, however, call it by a name that isn't really its name, and invite the Mission hipsters to eat there, and you have a cultural phenomena.  I get that....I respect that....but that doesn't mean disappointment can't happen.\n\nI'm hoping Chef comes back...does a little tinkering....and doesn't forget that in this new media world, expectations bring you up, and can make you come crashing down.\n\nAnd a few more light bulbs can't hurt.", "author": "James K."}

The skin on the wings was dry fried, crispy outside and juicy inside. Lovely!\nThe kung pao pastrami is a nice riff on the chicken favorite, peppers again running the show and married with the fatty pastrami.\nThe pickles are a sweet/sour flavor bomb, a nice segue between the entrees.\nI liked the succulence of the sliced peanut noodles, slippery and saucey.\nCall ahead and your food will f waiting in 25 minutes.

I would have to say it was tasty but it wasn't really chinese food. I coined it \"ironic chinese food\". This is because I believe it was tasty and very reminiscent of certain key flavors of chinese food (and very authentic chinese food) but they used ingredients that were non traditional.

I guess this place has some destination value, and I'd visit again if I had the chance.\n\nI came for a late dinner on a Friday night with a party of three.  We put our name down and waited outside in the mild San Francisco cold.  The wait was bearable - I think it was something like 20 minutes, extended because our third took his time showing up.  Once we were in, we got a moderately shitty table in one of the two glass-walled corner pockets adjacent to the doorway.  I sat against a window, presenting my back to the street.  The ambiance was kind of fun.  The restaurant was dim, tiny, and very busy.  The servers were pierced and Mission hip, as was much of the crowd.  Service was decent, fast and available.  We weren't forgotten.\n\nThe food was excellent.  We ate family style and ordered four dishes for three people.  It was a lot of food, which we only came close to finishing because of my MVP vacation appetite.  My favorite dish was the salt cod fried rice, which came with mackerel confit, Chinese sausage, lettuce, and egg.  It was fluffy and wonderful, delightfully salty, with bits of fish and sausage to add their meaty substance.  I also loved the thrice cooked bacon.  It was hefty with some great chew, and it was severely smokey in a way that I rather enjoyed.  One of my friends said it tasted like he was smoking a cigarette, but I don't think he meant that in a bad way.  The bacon came with bitter melon, tofu skin, chili oil, and plenty of floppy, supple Shanghainese rice cakes that moderated some of that strong flavor.  The tiki pork belly was another good dose of pig, a sweet one to counteract all the salt and smoke.  The pork belly was cooked soft and fatty with a soy caramel, and it came with mandarin orange, pickled pineapple, shaved coconut, and macadamia nuts.  The only overtly spicy dish we ordered was the Mongolian long beans.  These were quite spicy, but very enjoyable as a side.  They were a little bit doused in chili oil, but I liked the firm texture and the mix of Xinjiang spices and horseradish really delivered a kick.\n\nI washed down this feast with a $4 21st Amendment IPA, which hit the spot.  I think I spent a little under $40 on this meal, which is a lot for Chinese food, not too much for a destination dinner.  I was happy with the food, and would visit fairly often if I lived in the area.  It's apparently great for take-out, and I imagine many San Franciscans have Mission Chinese in their contacts.", "author": "Steph C."}

The tofu contained a gigantic amount of tofu-- which can be a good thing if it is adequately offset with plenty of sauce and flavor. My biggest complaint was that it seemed too tofu heavy and lacked contrasting textures. Perhaps I'm not too big of a tofu by itself fan, so this could be a positive for other people. \n\nI did appreciate how plenteous the peppers were in the tofu. It was quite spicy-- very much akin to actual Sichuan-style Mapo Tofu. They put the flower peppers in to make your tongue numb as well. \n\nAs far as the tea smoked eel, I thought this dish was one of the most unique items I've ever sampled. The rice wrapper was reminiscent of a dim sum item, the eel evoked the taste of sushi, and the hoisin/peanut sauce flavor made me think it was a Vietnamese spring roll. I thought it was very well done and was almost a tour of Asian flavors in one dish. \n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food that they give, the servers are friendly and the ambience is somewhat hipster.

I wanted so badly to love this place, after all I'd heard. The tiki pork belly had come highly recommended, and this did not disappoint.  It was perfectly prepared, and the fusion flavors of nuts, cheese, and sweet soy were surprising and delicious. It was the first item that arrived, and I just about squealed when I saw the paper umbrella sticking out of the spicy piece of fresh pineapple. The ma-po tofu, though--bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!  I have been to China several times, and have studied Chinese cooking. Artistic license is one thing--the traditional dish uses ground pork--this version had a scant few chunks of cubed pork that turned eating the dish into a \"find the meat\" expedition. \n\nWorse than this, however, was that the dish was completely redolent of Szechuan peppercorns. Yes, the dish was *hot*, but made authentically, that is to be expected. The Gweilo roaming the Mission might have a problem with this, but the heat was not something I took issue with. The extreme assault on my tastebuds by dozens upon dozens of Szechuan peppercorns was inexcusable.  The recipe I have used for 20 years, is plenty hot and seasoned, and calls for *1/2 teaspoon* of crushed Szechuan peppercorns. \n\nThe pickled long beans were just OK. I love long beans, and found that this preparation did nothing for them.\n\nI would give this place another chance, but I would only eat what came recommended by friends and Yelpers instead of playing the menu equivalent of \"pin the tail on the donkey\".", "author": "Michele W."}

That said, in a town where you can get plenty of damn tasty regional Chinese food in settings that range from small dives to hip and trendy eateries with craft cocktails, I'm not sure I'd return here. \n\nI'm a vegetarian, so take this review as you will. I tried: the spicy pickled peanuts, sauteed baby bok choy and thrice cooked \"bacon\" rice cakes (props to them for making a vegetarian version). The peanuts have interesting vinegar and spicy flavors and are rather irresistible. The bok choy is cooked well, but I actually had far tastier bok choy the next day at Fang (and I make fantastic bok choy myself). I was really disappointed in the thrice cooked bacon rice cakes which promised my favorite thing to eat in the world: tofu skin (it's impossible to find in New Orleans, so I make sure to hit up places in SF and NY who do have it). The dish contained exactly three tiny pieces of tofu skin buried in a massive amount of oily, oh-so-damn-oily, chewy rice cakes. I'll hold to my initial claim of \"damn tasty,\" but also wayyyy too oily in a bad way. Could this be an isolated occurrence? I don't think anyone else mentions the lack of tofu skin, so it's possible.\n\nPrices are fair and despite the more dark/divey Shanghai den kind of thing they have going on, it's, as you've probably guessed, not a dive at all. For example, divey Chinese restos don't typically serve Cava by the bottle, so yay! Note that they don't serve it in a bucket of ice and the bottle was already not icy cold, so our waiter kindly put it in the fridge and refilled our glasses for us when they were empty. He was awesome, btw, despite having a packed restaurant to work in.\n\nI just wasn't blown away by anything I ordered, though after months of being deprived of damn tasty Chinese food, I nearly devoured everything that was placed in front of me. That happens to me whenever I'm confronted with decent Chinese, let's be real. I guess I'm on the fence. I'm in NYC far more regularly than SF, so maybe I'd give it another try.

I always see people check in to this place on Facebook all excited to try it out and it makes me weep.\n\nThis is not your ordinary Chinese restaurant. They try a lot of weird recipes that probably cater to all the hipsters in the Mission.\n\nI came here with a group for lunch once and we ordered a variety of dishes. We just went with whatever sounded appealing by description including the ma po tofu, kung pao pastrami, and the chicken wings, among other things. The tofu plate itself was okay, but I cringed listening to the waiter try to pronounce it (he said something like may-poo) yet act like he was an expert on Chinese cuisine. For the pastrami dish, there was hardly any pastrami to be found and we all dug our utensils through it just to dig anything out that we could find. The chicken wings were insanely thin and had no meat in them, yet had a lot of spicy powder splattered all over them which made eating them unbearable with the aftertaste of powder in your mouth. Two thirds of the chicken wing plate was just filled with chili too.\n\nFor the small amount of food we were able to pick out from the plates, we still had to pay $13 per person. And with the short staff, it took a while for us to get our bill.\n\nOne plus though- we did see a kid here who looked exactly like Harry Potter. That gave us a good laugh while we waited forever for the bill.", "author": "Allen C."}

My friend and I wanted to catch up over a meal and she mentioned this place - perfect!  This place must be busy all day everyday - we thought we were getting there early for dinner at 6PM on a Monday evening.  It was packed!  We sat at the end of a long table shared with other small parties, and we ordered up.  \n\nFriends and Yelp had great suggestions on what was good so we got: cold dan dan noodles (woo spicy, made me sweat, could not focus on the taste because felt too self-conscious sitting there sweating, haha), hainam chicken rice (pretty good), salt cod fried rice (one of my favorite dishes of the night, great flavor, wanted more), sizzling cumin lamb (pretty good), broccoli beef cheek (another favorite of the night, yummy lovely fatty taste, a couple of oysters mixed in, would definitely order this again!) and beer (21st Amendment beer with watermelon flavor, very interesting, great with Chinese food!).  Loved the saucy nut mixture they brought to our table at the beginning of the meal.\n\nService was quick and friendly enough.  The line stacked up pretty quickly after we sat down.  We had lots of leftovers and probably ordered too many rice dishes (a small bowl of steamed rice was also included in our order), and I wish the waitress had recommended that we order one less rice dish (but oh well, they were all good).

But I don't know what type of fusion food they were going for. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes. Unfortunately, as a party of 2, we were crammed into the middle tables. There was barely any room for the dishes. Place was loud. I couldn't even see the food as it was so dark (only lit by Christmas lights and the light from the door to the kitchen). \n\nWe ordered the Beijing Vinegar Peanuts (which tasted like regular peanuts soaked in oil - finger food or chopsticks? even the waiter didn't know); Tiger Salad (yeah, a bunch of herbs soaked in vinegar wrapped by a sheet of rice noodle - not much flavor other than herbs and vinegar - blah); Broccoli Beef Brisket (it says it was cooked with smoked oyster sauce but ummm, it literally tasted like an ash tray); and Mongolian Long Beans (this is probably the most edible dish, and that's not saying much, as they used some spice that left a nasty aftertaste, which the beef brisket also had a nasty aftertaste). Even the sake we ordered couldn't drown out the aftertaste. We were scrounging for any mint, gum, etc. that we could find, and ended up going to a bar hoping alcohol would numb the taste buds. \n\nThis is probably one of the worst meals I've had - last one was coincidentally at a restaurant in Beijing, China.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-02-23", "description": "Don't believe the hype! \n\nBy far the WORST \"Chinese\" food I've ever tasted in my entire life! Even Panda Express does a better job than this barf food I had.... My friends and I had such high expectations for this place, and we were beyond disappointed after the first bite. How can a restaurant that's on the 7x7 list, featured in several magazines, and has 1000+ reviews on Yelp taste that bad, you ask? It's all the hype - and please, don't believe in it. \n\nMy friends and I came on a Friday night (silly us) and waited for about 30-45 minutes in the cold (super windy night) with people pestering us for money. From the first glance of the store-front, I was kind of skeptical of the place. It was very grungy - and my belief was confirmed when I went inside to use the restroom. The restroom was straight through the kitchen and out the door. It was where the garbage and recycling bins were located, and right next to the kitchen. My initial thoughts were, \"use the restroom as fast as possible because rats and cockroaches can come out any minute!\" I mean, I didn't see any.. but you can only wonder....\n\nI also hated the interior of the restaurant. It was super dark and uncomfortable. My party had to share this medium size round table with 2 other parties, which was kind of awkward. I meant, I'm from HK and I'm used to this whole sharing table concept. But cramming us altogether with so little breathing room is not okay. When the food came out, we could barely distinguish our dishes with other parties' dishes. Not only that, but the table soon ran out of space to even accommodate all our dishes. Ugh... However, the most annoying part of the meal was that my party literally sat under the speakers, and they were playing loud, obnoxious KMEL-like music... Really, at a \"Chinese\" restaurant?? You have got to be kidding me. \n\nOkay, the most important part of the review... the food....\n\n1. Char Siu Pig Ear Terrine\nWeird texture and taste. What grossed me out the most was the little pieces of hairs still stuck on the pig ears... Even with the limited lighting, I could see those hairs stick up. Who would serve customers food with animal hairs still on it?? That's just disgusting.\n\n2. Tea Smoked Eel\nThis was a cool concept, but just didn't work. It would have been okay with just the rice noodle, eel, and celery, but there was this fishy tasting minced paste thing that just tasted like barf. I literally felt nauseous immediately after eating that. It was just a weird taste.. I don't even know what it was. I read the menu, and it says that there was \"braised pork\" in it.. but it definitely didn't taste like pork to me.... \n\n3. Salt Cod Fried Rice\nProbably the only dish that was \"acceptable\", and only because it didn't deviate too much from the REAL salted fish and chicken fried rice Chinese people traditionally make. However, given the quality of the food, it still wasn't very good as it lacked in flavor. I've had way better fried rice at Panda Express... But I'm glad we ordered this...since this was the only dish that was edible lol\n\n4. Egg Egg Noodle\nCame with a raw egg, which I think ruined the entire dish. How can they ruin such a simple dish? I think it literally consisted of noodles, scallions, ginger, soy sauce, and the raw egg. But it was just disgusting. I can't pinpoint why (weird texture and taste?), but I could only take 2 bites before putting it down. \n\n5. Kung Pao Pastrami\nWere they trying to kill us with that overly salty pastrami?? I've never tasted anything THAT salty... My friends and I were even joking about how this should be called \"Morton Pastrami\" given the extreme saltiness of the dish. I had one bite of the pastrami and couldn't handle it. Though I enjoyed the peanuts.......?\n\nMy friends and I ate about half (or less) of each dish and didn't even bother to take the leftovers home. It was THAT bad. I mean, I felt bad for wasting food like that and considered giving it to homeless people, but I think it would do more harm for them than help... Where are they going to find water to wash down that disgustingly salty pastrami? Worst $70 bucks ever spent on food. The table next to us also left half their dishes untouched and didn't take them home either.. That's saying something.\n\nI should've known this place would be a disappointment given that there were no Asians waiting in line to try this place. This place is super \"Hipsterized\" and gives Chinese food a bad name. I feel sorry for people whose first experience with Chinese food is at Mission Chinese Food. If this was my first experience, I would probably hate Chinese food. If you want REAL Chinese food, go elsewhere, preferably somewhere in Chinatown, Richmond, or Sunset.. NOT the Mission, and definitely NOT Mission Chinese Food. \n\nThe only redeeming factor about this place is that they donate 75 cents per entree to SF Food Bank. Other than that, I could care less if this place closed down.", "author": "Michelle L."}

We ordered the tofu, Lion's Head Meatball and the Westlake rice porridge, three dishes that I order often at Chinese restaurants and thus could use as points of comparison.  \n\nThe tofu dish is spicy, as it should be and was meant to be.  You will not find a \"dumbed\" down version of this dish here, as so many places have done.  The pork and silken tofu dish is rich, luxurious and comforting.  The green peppers and Szechuan peppercorns provide just a hint of sweetness. There seemed to be more pork than tofu in the dish.  Hint: for those of you that aren't used to really spicy food, rice is a must to accompany this dish.\n\nThe Westlake rice porridge is so good!  The ratio of crab, oxtail and cilantro to the porridge was perfect!  The soup was so flavorful and light.  My preference is for the Cantonese style preparation of this dish, where it's thick and creamy, but the porridge here, where the rice grains haven't completely broken down, opened my mind to other interpretations.  All I can say is \"Please sir, I want some more\"!\n\nThe Lion's Head Meatball comes with vegetables and ramen noodles in a marrow broth.  The meatball is light and fluffy, as it should be, and the broth is rich and unctuous.  The pickled turnips provide some needed crunch.  I found the dish to be on the salty side and a bit too rich but would recommend it to others.\n\nWhile waiting for our food to arrive, I noticed the kitschy decor....gotta love the dragon hanging across the entire length of the ceiling and the two beer cans in its mouth!!  If anyplace could be described as a dive, this place absolutely fits the bill. Christmas lights hang from the wood paneled walls, the plates are mismatched and tables/chairs are straight out of a bygone era.  However, don't let that distract you from the reason you came to eat here...the food.   The space is small and the wait can be long as there are few tables.  It does share the space with an old school Chinese restaurant and the wait staff is from that operation.    I found the staff to be nice, especially the chef, who was awesome.\n\nPortions are very generous.  Prices are pretty reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.  An extra star for their donations to one of my favorite charities - the SF Food Bank.  Their interpretations of standard Chinese fare maintains the integrity of the dishes but adds a twist that makes it special.

I am Chinese and I can tell you that this is not the traditional minced chicken with salted fish fried rice.  They have their special spin on this dish and the flavors are very unique. Taiwanese clams was a disappointment.  I love clams but these were the tiniest manila clams and on top of that most of the shells were empty.  The sauce is good but nothing special, based on what I remembered it is a cross between XO sauce and black bean sauce with a little bit of Chinese bacon mixed in.  The worst dish of all was the Kung Pao Pastrami.  I love Pastrami sandwich and I love anything Kung Pao but the combination of the two is one hot mess.  The flavors are weird it was spicy and smokey with slices of potatoes and celery.  \n\nThe service:\nWell, the service was better than expected.

I got the kung pao pastrami. A few things to note here.\n\n- It's really quite good. The pastrami is smoky, tender, and slightly spicy. The fattier pieces melt in your mouth, and the edge pieces have a nice little bark on them, like barbecue.\n\n- Lots of vegetables -- red peppers, celery, and paper-thin potatoes, all lightly cooked to stay a bit crispy. I liked the meat-vegetable ratio; the pastrami would have overwhelmed the dish with salt and smoke if they'd used more. The potatoes were an unusual choice, but I've got to admit, it works.\n\n- It was light on the peanuts -- looking at pictures other people have uploaded here, they seem to be pretty inconsistent with the peanut dosage.

Pity; they would have worked well here.\n\n- I didn't think it was actively spicy, but the folks next to me ordered the same thing and gave up due to the spice. Not sure whether this was due to inconsistency in the kitchen, or I've just burnt off most of my taste buds.\n\n- A large pile of not-quite-kung-pao and a bowl of rice came to $14 or so.

I've been traveling to San Francisco for 4 weeks and was finally able to check it out last week. I tried going a couple weeks ago on a Wednesday, but unfortunately, that's the one day it's closed....strange but I had heard such good things that I had to go back.\n\nMet a friend for dinner last week...I had the thrice cooked bacon with rice cakes. Holy sh%t that was good. Succulent bacon, bitter melon, soft, creamy rice cakes, crispy tofu skin, and the chiles. We also shared the Mongolian long beans which were beyond spicy but delicious.\n\nThere were so many great options on the menu like kung pao pastrami and brisket and broccoli that sounded amazing, but I couldn't have the first time.\n\nI was back in San Francisco this past week, so I made it a mission to head back to the mission.\n\nI went back again for the Sichuan pickles and pastrami. The pickles were delicious, almost like a Chinese kimchee. The pastrami, although unique, was on the salty side, especially when paired with an IPA. It was delicious and tasty but needed something sweeter to balance it out.\n\nSince I wasn't completely satisfied by the pastrami, I went back again for the brisket and broccoli and had to have the long beans again. This time was amazing...the dish had a lot more broccoli rabe than brisket, but it worked really well with the brisket adding a salty, smoky accent to the crunchy broccoli. \n\nThere's still the General Tsao's lamb ribs that I need to try so I'll be back my next time in San Francisco.

Your tongue will be on fire and you'll feel s numbing sensation on your tongue for several minutes.\n\nThrice-cooked bacon w/ shanghai rice cake - now this I would go back for. Also super spicy but the bacon has a really nice smoky flavor and I love the chewiness of the rice cakes. The dish also has biter melon which gives it a nice flavor and crunch.\n\nSalt cod fried rice - NOT spciy. I've definitely had better. I don't taste any salted cod in there and there is nothing really special about the fried rice. I hate chinese sausage in fried rice and surprisingly even though this dish has chinese sausage in it, I don't really taste it. \n\nKung pow pastrami - interesting. The pastrami is really good but I don't care for all the veggies in it (celery, tomatoes, onions etc.) I found myself picking for the pastrami instead of enjoying the dish as a whole because again, HELLA spicy.\n\nBeef noodle soup - definitely not as tasty compared to shanghai or sechuan restaurants. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I got to try it several times but 4 dishes for $51 is not worth it.

I have a pretty high tolerance to spice and didn't think this was very hot - very tasy though!!\n\nCombination Fried Rice - Super flavorful and I loved the pineapple with the crab - YUM!\n\nMongolian Long Beans - These, I LOVED! they had the perfect amount of spice and were just super tasty.\n\nSome misses:\n\nChongqing Chicken Wings - They look dry, they taste dry. The coating/breading - very strange, I can't really explain it. The taste - I couldn't tell you, my tongue was numbed. The contents of the package were 2/3 red chilis and 1/3 chicken wings. I'll be avoiding these next time.\n\nCumin Lamb Ribs - Dry and hard to eat; the end.\n\nAll in all - a super solid spot and I would definitely want to get delivery again (or eat here)!", "author": "Catherine A."}

I'll endure almost anything for great food, just wished they delivered on it.  Szechuan pickles, like another said, Meh version of kimchi.  Pork belly, good flavor, just wish it wasn't burnt on the bottom, took a whole layer off the belly that we couldn't eat.  Veal ribs, completely burnt, the entire outside of the rib was black, dried and inedible, we picked it apart and got a few bites from the middle that were good, but come on.  This is basic cooking technique.  Last dish was beef cheek a l'orange.  Good flavor, but AGAIN, cook to shit.  Dry chewy pieces of meat, some of it I couldn't even chew up, was so overdone.\n\nThis was the most over-hyped place I have ever eaten at.  I don't know where they lost there way, but they are lost.

The place is appropriately dingy and dim, though there is a huge lit-up dragon flying over ahead. \n\nWe got the little hot plate of tea-smoked eel as an appetizer. It definitely wasn't what we had envisioned, but it was a nice surprise. My mental pic had strips of unagi on a bed of rice noodles and drenched in soy. Instead, it was eight little tubelettes of rice noodle wrapped around Chinese ham, big hunks of eel, celery, and it was lightly wet with soy/cognac with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds on top. Pretty presentation and clean flavors, and I could have definitely eaten a few more. I've been wondering about making unagi dumplings for a while now, so seeing how rice noodle and eel flavors interact nicely is a good sign!\n\nOur two mains were the cumin lamb, which comes with a side bowl of chili-pickled long bean dices and the thrice-cooked bacon. Both dishes reminded me of Ethiopian cooking in that everything was a caramelized onion explosion. The lamb smelled amazing since it came sizzling on a platter and had a cloud of cumin spewing from it. Big slabs of belly meat, so lots of burnt fatty bits to savor. The onions soaked up all the meat juices, so it went great with rice. I wasn't really sure what to do with the pickled long bean, but it was a nice counterpoint to the meatiness. The thrice-cooked bacon was probably my favorite of the two mains since it had a lot of interesting flavors going on. The inari flaps gave some sweet while the peppers threw in the spicy. Rice cakes and onions again soaked up everything.\n\nWill have to come  back to try their ma po tofu and their bbq!", "author": "Kevin L."}

The decor is very fun and lively, with a big dragon covering the ceiling. Our waitress seemed rather annoyed that our party took more than 5 minutes with the menu. To appease her on the second check-in, we ordered a few items and said that we'd order a few more in a minute. She huffed and took all but one of our menus (was she worried they would run out?). We ordered the cucumbers, sesame chicken, dan dan noodles, mongolian long beans, and the chicken wings. The dan dan noodles were good, but the sesame chicken, long beans, and chicken wings were all absurdly salty.

I put my bias and hipster fatigue aside because I was hungry and because something smelled good coming out of that kitchen full of very non-hipster Asian moms and daughters.\n\nWe started with the Black Vinegar Peanuts.  They were tangy and soaked long enough to leech some of the crunch out of the nuts, infusing them with lots of drink-it-up flavour.

But the food is made with authentic ingredients with a twist. It's not fusion, but it's quarky. It's Chinese Food for city hipsters! \n\nWord of caution: this place is usually pretty packed. You're supposed to put your name and party number on the clipboard outside and wait to be called. On a Tuesday night, my two friends and waited about 20 minutes, where we were then lead to and squeezed into a table in the back. After oggling at the menu this was the result:\n\n1) The Slow-cooked Pork Belly was pretty awesome - the tangy, fruity pickled pineapple (it was slightly fizzy, whoo!) complimented the salty, fattiness of the pork. \n\n2) The Mongolian green beans were exploding in garlic and pepper flavor. \n\n3) The Thrice Cooked Bacon isn't the smoky bacon one is accustomed to. This tender bacon absorbed the flavors of the dish - mostly garlic, black bean and soy sauce. Bitter melon, rice cakes and tofu skins accompanied the bacon. Could've had more bitter melon. \n\n4) I wasn't too big a fan of the Sizzling Cumin Lamb. I see what they are trying to do with piling on the spice, but all I could taste was CUMIN. Could've used something to round out the flavor a bit.\n\n5) Westlake Rice Porridge with oxtail, dungeness crab, poached egg and cilantro.  I think after all the explosive flavors of the other dishes, this seemed even more subdued and tame. This was a little more watery than the rice porridge I'm used to, but still very well done. \n\nAll in all, I had a nice time here. But it was a little on the salty side. I think when you put Mission Chinese Food in the grand scheme of food in SF, I can only give it the 3.5 stars. I mean, just a ways over in China Town lives some of the best Chinese food in the Bay.

The food wasn't bad or especially fantastic.\n\nWhy the 2 stars?\n\nI was shocked when I went to the back to go to the bathroom. I witnessed so many disturbing health issues. Firstly, the kitchen's floor is a bunch of old dirty cardboard strewn about. The tubs of fresh veggies used for cooking are kept a foot off the ground by other old pieces of cardboard, nothing covering them. \n\nWhile I was in line 3 cooks took smoke breaks right outside the kitchen without closing the kitchen door, letting the cigarette smoke waft straight in. I could visibly see the smoke mingling with the open containers of veggies, which also happened to be right next to the open door. One of the cooks put out his cigarette in a little holder right outside the door  on the ground (which happens to be 2 feet away from the open veggies just on the other side of the doorwary) and, I kid you not, beelined straight to the stove and continue to grease up a pan with his bear-hands without even washing them!\n\nUnfortunately I witnessed all of this before I even got my food so it kind of ruined the whole experience for me.

Also, large portions, so that's a plus.\n\nThe food itself was strange --- unlike anything I'd seen before.

After standing in line for about a half hour for a table of two (no biggie) we got seated. Service was pleasant and friendly. I figured I was gonna try out the Ma Po Tofu because it's the hotness on Yelp and Foodspotting, and we tried the Egg Egg Noodles (a variation of Dandan noodles, plus egg). Two main points to make here:\n\n1. Ma Po Tofu. Whoa. I mean this not necessarily in a good way -- just whoa. The spice totally confused me, threw me for a loop. The initial flavor was amazing, rich, round and savory. The pork was done just right, the sauce LOOKED just like yo Taiwanese mama (or mine, at least) threw em together but when it hit your mouth I was just flabbergasted. Something about it was wayy off balance. Highly peppery and leaving a bit of a sour, punchy aftertaste, I just kept tasting Ma Po in everything I ate that night. Did something go wrong in the kitchen? Am I just a sensitive taster? I'm confused. Help me Yelp! Do I just not get the hype? Am I not cultured enough? My advice to you is do NOT come in here with expectations of authenticity.\n\nBy the way, the Egg Egg noodle was pleasant, rich, and delightful.\n\n2. MCF is making Chinese food sexy. Like date-night, libido-revving sexy. Deep pulsating bass-y music, and dim lights, this place is like someone took a chinese restaurant and started pushing it toward a lounge-ish feel, but didn't change anything about the restaurant except the lighting.

We both eat spicy food every day, but this was clearly an accident in the kitchen.\n\nThe stir-fried pork jowls was very greasy and salty. The salt and greasiness drowned out any subtlety the dish might otherwise have had, like the radishes were flavorless. And what is up with the shrimp puffy chips on this dish? That didn't help, and they soaked up some of the grease, which made the chips less appealing.\n\nThe tea-smoked eel rolls seemed like a good idea, but they were actually really bland! We didn't notice the eel flavor. Those fat white noodles didn't seem so tasty, kind of stale.\n\nOverall, a disappointment. Maybe this was once a great thing, an experimental, punky Asian fusion joint, but the execution left us feeling, well, ill. Offensive food, really, that has certain flavors cranked up so high like the chef is tripping balls on meth and just can't taste anything ao s/he dumps more and more of it on until finally it's strong enough to reach their addled senses.\n\nSo, don't eat here unless you don't care about the food and are just looking for a hipster scene, which this is. The punky dishes might appeal to inexperienced, younger diners, but anyone with expectations of, say, pleasure or subtlety will be very let down.", "author": "Kevin P."}

People think it's inauthentic because it's not take-out. People think it's authentic because it's not take-out. All the spices and scallions must have culinary compasses spinning because this place is being touted as \"traditional,\" \"non-traditional,\" \"Americanized,\" \"non-Americanized,\" and \"salty.\" In truth, it's all of the above and none of the above at the same time. From my perspective, the most apt way to describe Mission Chinese is \"western style Chinese food interpreted with a heavy hand by white people.\" It's pretty much peerless, and it's not bad. \n\nMa Po Tofu and Cumin Lamb were both enjoyable, albeit overly spiced and rather salty. I was thirsty for literally the entire next week. I did notice that the tofu dish had very little pork in it, the lamb dish was dominated by onions, and the salt cod fried rice was mostly rice. This place may be run by hipsters, but they're stingy like Asians are, I guess.\n\nEven so, I reject the notion that people cannot like this restaurant solely because it isn't what you would find in Chinatown (or China, for that matter). Why should we limit ourselves to food prepared the same way it has been a thousand years before? Be adventurous!

This place is Michelin Guide recommended?  I don't think it's for the decor.\n\nThe menu consists of about 20 items organized into starters, entrees, rice/noodle dishes, and vegetables.

This Chinese food is different.  It's taking traditional Chinese dishes and twisting them up.  There's nothing subtle about this food.  It's a punch in the face and if you're up to that, then there's plenty to enjoy.  If you're a traditionalist or purist when it comes to your Chinese food, you won't like it.

The lion's head meatball (also one huge piece - this place is all about big, single chunks of meat!) came in a soup with ramen noodles. Interesting take on the dish, which I usually have dry, with rice. By the time it was delivered to us, it was a little lukewarm, but I'm sure fresh from the pot, would've been 10x better.

So much fat left on the lamb and the broth was so-so.\n\nFried Rice was the only good thing, but not worth the price/sickness/disappointment.\n\nFrankly, the fact that my mom got sick and everyone else had funny feeling stomachs has sworn me off from Mission Chinese forever.

It did help knowing that the sign was from the last occupant of this space, which is a different Chinese restaurant.\n\nWe really enjoyed our meal.  The food was freshly prepared, and the service was great (always a smile, excellent food knowledge and lots of advice).  The establishment is a total dive, with formica tables jammed together and crappy banquet chairs, but that is the point of pop-up restaurants, no matter how long they last.  It is about the food, not the ambience.\n\nTo eat, we had the:\n\nSzechwan Pickles - basically kimchi or pickled cabbage.  Excellent heat level; loved the addition of crunchy peanuts for a salty crunch.  Delicious appetizer.\n\nSzechwan Long Beans - this was the one dish I would never eat again.  It says spicy, but it should say initiatory.  The beans are crisp tender, but their natural sweetness is drowned out by such a hot sauce that you will lose all feeling between your mouth and your chin.  Food should not hurt.\n\nPork Belly with Tea Soaked Egg - the restaurant was out of noodles, so this was not prepared as it usually is.  It was still fantastic.  You pop the yolk, and it oozes all over the chewy belly with a crunchy sear.  Talk about rich!  Salty pork in creamy egg goodness.\n\nBeef Cheeks with Chinese Broccoli - hands down the best beef and broccoli that I have ever eaten.  The beef cheeks are rich and tender (a bit reminiscent of marrow), and the chinese broccoli is crisp tender, the sweet offering a welcome compliment to the butter beef.  Sprinkled with sesame seeds, this dish appears traditional but has exceptional flavor.\n\nThrice Cooked Bacon - VEGETARIAN?!?!  This dish was made with tofu skin, which tasted like the most perfect braised bacon without the heavy after feeling.  The korean rice cake is a brilliant, chewy cross between rice and noodles.  The veggies were plentiful and crisp.  I think that this was the best dish of the evening.  A great smoky, sweet, spicy mash-up.\n\nGeneral Tsao Veal Rib - a huge beef rib with a crisp sear encapsulating rich red meat served in a fermented black bean sauce.  I love black bean sauce - salty goodness.  This was an excellent dish.\n\nSteamed rice accompanied our dishes and was welcome to sop up the sauce.

As far as Chinese food goes, this was on the expensive side and not very satisfying.\n\nI had the General Tso's Veal Rib. While there was certainly some tasty bites in there, overall it wasn't that great. There was a lot of fat in the dish and it does not come with rice or anything on the side. I wish I had known that because my entire meal was just a big hunk of meat. (Yes, I could have taken a closer study of the menu and realized this, but I figured for 18 bucks it would include rice).\n\nMy wife had Thrice Cooked Bacon. I had a few bites and while the bacon was pretty good, overall the meal was very spicy. Again, it did not come with rice which made it difficult to eat since it was so spicy. I should note that my wife is Korean and is used to eating spicy food and still found this dish on the spicy side.\n\nFinally, they did not deliver any utensils or napkins with the meal which was annoying since we were staying in a hotel and didn't have any readily available.", "author": "William Y."}

Please do not eat here if you have blood pressure problems, because every dish here is extremely salty or spicy. Chili oil is used a lot here. Be sure to have a gallon of water handy. After a while, it was hard for me to taste the difference between the dishes I ordered because all I could focus on was drinking enough water to power through all the saltiness. \n2) Prices. For the prices, I'd rather pay the same amount and get 5x more Chinese food AND have delivery/tip be included in that price. \n3) The wait. Given points #1 and #2, I don't find much value in waiting 45+ minutes for the aforementioned dishes. SF is a big foodie town and there's a plethora of restaurants that I'd happily camp out to try, but MCF isn't one of them.

I guess they don't mess around with the 2 fire symbols.\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the Ma Po Tofu which was just okay to me because I felt that it needed a bit more flavor.

We also ordered the mouth watering chicken, mapo tofu, and sizzling cumin lamb.\n\nUm...despite the name that mouth watering chicken is not mouth watering at all.  The three of us agreed that the name is really deceiving and we left a lot of it untouched. I don't know what seasonings they use, but it had a funky smell to it and not a great texture either.  It was completely unappetizing.\n\nThe sizzling cumin lamb was maybe the highlight of the meal.  Actually, the grilled onions and peppers that come in this dish were the highlight of the meal.  Seasoning on the dish were good and flavorful, but the \"meat\" we got was probably like 85% lamb fat.  One big chunk I took was entirely fat.  I literally could not find any lamb meat on that big chunk at all. I thought it was an anomaly but my friends also had similarly predominantly lamb fat pieces.  What a disappointment!\n\nThe absolute lowlight of this meal was the mapo tofu.  We asked for it to be not as spicy as normal because quite frankly we all knew it would be too much for us to handle.  Not surprisingly, it took them a little longer to make us our dish since they had to make it from scratch rather than just scoop up whatever they have simmering away in the back.  It.. Was. Awful.  There was a huge pool of oil across the entire bowl and the mapo \"sauce\" tasted essentially like glorified ketchup, which makes no sense because there are no tomatoes in mapo.  The pieces of pork shoulder were tender but otherwise I thought this dish was a complete failure.\n\nI am also now convinced that MCF makes their food extremely spicy because they don't want you to actually taste any of their food.  Combine the crappy food with the fact that they're still trying to pass themselves off as a pop-up restaurant, the ridiculous wait, and awful interior of the restaurant, I honestly don't know why people like this place so much.

Now wait in line. Or come in during non-meal hours, because the wait during lunch and dinner can go up to an hour or more.\n\nSit down in the dim interior and stare at the paper dragon overhead while someone's Pandora station* plays in the background. Soon, a nice waiter comes by and asks in perfect English for your order. Repeat to yourself a second equally important note:\n\nDon't order more than a combined rating of three chili peppers.\n\nMake your order. If you're eating during normal meal hours, try to hear your companions over the noise of other patrons, or if you're eating off-hours, take a look around.\n\nSee that couple with the hefty bowl of ma-po tofu (two chili rating), half finished? They're staring at it and seriously considering taking it back home**. Between them sits a plate of thrice-cooked bacon (one chili rating). They scrap away the copious amount of jalapeno slices and thus are able to enjoy the tender bacon and chewy rice cakes***. The girl laments about too few bittermelon pieces and too much onion, and laughs at her partner grimacing at the taste of bittermelon.\n\nThe third plate on their table contains a large heap of Szechuan peppers. They shuffle through them and fetch out small fried chicken wings (two chili rating). The wings are sprinkled with what looks like paprika and black pepper. Altogether, the plate contains about 6-8 wings. They finish them all, and the heap of peppers awaits cleanup. The girl licks her fingers and smiles in approval****. She then wonders aloud, \"Throwing them away would be such a waste. I mean, they're so spicy, you can reuse them.\" You hope they don't for sanitary reasons, but you are more concerned about your own tolerance of them on your chicken wings than the destiny of theirs.\n\nThe man of the couple looks red in the face, gulps down his water, and comments that he is full. The girl spoons more mapo tofu onto her plate and slurps them up with rice, before taking a sip from her glass of water. She must be a saint.\n\nSatisfied, the thrice-cooked bacon now just onions and jalapenos, the ma-po tofu spooned into a container, they leave. The girl says on the way out, \"My lips are numb from the tofu.\"***** Meanwhile, your own ma-po bowl thumps down in front of you and your companions, and they whistle in disbelief.\n\nGood luck, have fun. ^_^\n\n* I actually don't know if it's Pandora, but I heard an odd mix of songs when I ate here, mostly 90's alt rock.\n** Don't get me wrong, the ma-po was quite good. The spiciness isn't so much hot-spicy, as it is numbing-spicy. Big difference between the two.\n*** It's a good thing I'm not a strict vegetarian, because I couldn't help eating the bacon and rice cakes. The least spicy of the dishes we got. Quite a few onions, and be very careful you don't mix up the cilantro with the jalapenos.\n**** The wings had a good balance of crispiness, salt, and spice.

The pickled veg small plate and vinegar peanuts small plate were, literally, inedible. Pure raw vinegar flavor,  no seasoning,  except the 3 cloves of \"confit\" garlic laid on top. What the heck? The *famous* chicken wings were so overcooked that there was not a drop of moisture left in them - and while they came buried beneath a ginormous pile of dried chilis, the wings themselves were not flavored other than having a thin sprinkling of seasoning on the top side of the skin. (The seasoning reminded both of us of Larry's Seasoned Salt).  Okay, now regarding the \"shrimp dumplings\" on a bed of picked veg.  It's the same inedible raw vinegar \"pickles\"  referenced above. People, I love pickles of all types including quick pickles, however there is no way that you can fairly describe completely raw veg submerged briefly in pure vinegar &  a splash of soy sauce as  \"pickles\".  The dumplings were more like small tortellini than dumpling,  and again, seasoning was not there.  Lastly, the drinks. We ordered one of the specials ($12) that was vodka and ginger beer with kaffir lime.  It wasn't as bad as the food, but unimpressive nonetheless.  The bill for this regrettable meal was just under $60 before tip.

Our wait for three people was 30 minutes max on a Thursday night at 7:30. I was very surprised (not to mention grateful). \n\nIt's dark inside - not \"candlelight at your table, dim lighting\" dark, but more like \"typical mission dive bar\" dark.  The atmosphere is not particularly classy and the service is nothing to write home about (we sat at our table for 15 minutes before anyone came to check in with us).  \n\nNow that I've said all of that - let me tell you, the food is delicious and makes up for all of the above.  Food items I'd order again:  (1) Ma Po Tofu - yes it's spicy.  It's a reddish sauce + tofu, no veggies or anything else.  Our mistake was not ordering a side of rice with this dish - you'll want something to soak up all of the delicious sauce.  (2) Kung Pao Pastrami - the pastrami was amazing (I don't even like pastrami normally!) -  it's not deli meat slices, but rather chunks of fatty, flavorful goodness.  \n\nNot as big of a fan of: (1) Bok choy in popcorn broth - it's a big bowl of mini bok choys in a miso sauce (still not sure why it's called popcorn broth).

I'd read and heard all the hype and really wanted to check this place out for soooo long. And the Egg Egg noodles were good. But....\nWith that being said we had some \"Mouth Watering Chicken\" which is a cold dish, okay no big deal there...but it had some kind of spice on it that after a while coated your mouth. And when I went to drink some water it made the water taste weird. And it really overpowered the dish. I'm all for trying new and different flavors, but I just felt it was so overpowering that the chicken and other ingredients got lost and became disinteresting. We also had the long beans which were not bad (also a cold dish) crunchy and spicy. I guess if we had tried maybe some other items, I just wasn't that impressed for all the hype around the talk. \nI guess it's just not for everyone.....Note: I did try making Danny Bowien's Tea-Infused Poached Chicken stuffed with rice from a recipe that was posted in a magazine. Though the chicken had a really great flavor, the rice didn't cook (twice I tried this recipe??) and had to pull the rice out and cook separately.

We walked towards the location and was caught off guard by the restaurant's name on the awning, as it was different from the name on Yelp.  However since this was the only Chinese place around and also due to the long line, we came to the conclusion that this was the place.   \n\nInitial Red Flags of this restaurant's authenticity:\n- The menu outside was all in English with no Chinese characters\n- The person who was seating people was not Chinese\n- The price of the food was extremely expensive (over $10 on average per dish)\n- The restaurant's name was re-branded \"Mission Chinese Food\"\n- Majority of the people who gave this place 4 to 5 stars where not Asian, which skews the ratings. \n- Some of the cooks were not Chinese\n- Most of the people eating were not Asian\n- We asked the waiter if they had menu's in Chinese, who then looked startled by the request. \n\nHowever, we decided to not jump to conclusions and let the food have the final verdict.  \n\nFood Results:\nPork Belly - Decently crispy but not stellar.  Dryer than usual. \nGreen Beans - Not bad, reall spicy and a good portion.\nChicken Wings - A person with no arms could probably make better wings.  Really dry with a lot of peppers to seem as if you are getting a lot for the price you are paying, but really you're only getting 5 to 6 wings.  \nCoca Cola - Tasted good, however I am unable to confirm its authenticity.  \nTap Water - SF tap, just how we like it. \n\nConclusion\nWe determined that it would be unfair to compare this place to other Chinese restaurants, besides, it's in the Mission and they have to cater to the hipster crowd if they wanted to make money.  But my overall experience and with all the hype on Yelp, I will give this place 2 stars, to offset the overrated reviews by many.", "author": "Shad B."}

I had some serious reservations about the place, fearing a painfully hip, P.F. Chang's in the Mission. But to my surprise, they for the most part, kept the food true to its roots.  Yeah, so they don't have pastrami in China, but the kung pao pastrami, at it's core, was authentic and tasty.\n\nThe thrice cooked bacon was delish. Unlike cheap bacon, pork belly served in Chinese restaurants (which is stil tasty mind you), MCF uses good quality bacon that is smoked to such perfection that even the bacon fat was delicious.\n\nThe rice cakes in this thrice cooked bacon was truly the highlight of the evening. Those chewy rice cakes were the hit of the evening - perfect in their \"q q\" (Taiwanese for mouth feel, chewiness) with just the hint of sweetness.

Don't eat the hot peppers - you might have to use your iPhone to pick out the edible pieces (it's dark in the middle).\n\nThe nice thing about MCF is that if you doggie bag it, you have the foundation for some bad *ss leftovers the next day, just throw in some fresh veggies to mix with the MCF leftovers.\n\nThough there were some misses with the food, I have to give them 4 stars because I love the concept, I want to encourage further innovation in Chinese food and the old school rap is awesome.", "author": "Madison W."}

Everyone and their mother have been talking about this place, and this hipster mecca even spawned another restaurant in the East Coast hipster mecca of Brooklyn.  The smell coming from inside the restaurant (as we waiting outside) was very enticing.  Visions came to mind of chilies frying in oil, with massive pots and pans sizzling with cumin flavored meats and noodles....my mouth was watering when we finally sat down.\n\nUnfortunately, this place turns out to be MASSIVELY overrated.  We started with the beef brisket soup, which was packed with rice noodles, bits of fatty brisket, scallions, and a few other goodies.  The soup was really flavorful, and definitely not what you would normally expect from soup at a Chinese place.  It was more earthy, with kind of an umami aftertaste. It was a promising start to be sure.\n\nThat was followed up by the Mongolian cumin lamb, lamb rib tips, and peas.  The Mongolian cumin lamb had a lot of promise too.  The smell coming off the platter was onions and cumin.  It looked spicy and almost seductive the way the lamb was falling off the bone.  Surprisingly the meat itself was pretty bland, leaving only a slight aftertaste of cumin.  The cumin covered onions, however, provided a potent hit of flavor.\n\nThe rib tips were much the same.  Super tender boneless lamb (though a little fatty) covered in what promised to be an explosion of spices, and yet again very bland.  The smell was there, and it looked good, but alas, all it did was make me thirsty.  \n\nThe peas were the best part of the meal.  Nothing particularly special, but a healthy serving of fresh peas mixed with garlic and chiles.  \n\nThe service and prices are good.  We got a lot of food, and it was only about $40.  But I can't imagine circling for parking in the Mission, then waiting 20 - 45 minutes out on the sidewalk for Chinese food that is just so-so.

Not that I don't like mushrooms, but I think the new recipe is not as good as the old one.\n(b) The last time I dined there, I found a RUBBER BAND in my fried rice. I am not kidding. I was very sad about it but was still hopeful it was a one-time incident...so...\n(c) I ordered mapo tofu & congee from them a week later. The delivery came swiftly. However, this time I found a PIECE OF PLASTIC in the mapo tofu. \n\nThis is inexcusable. The restaurant clearly has some sanitation issues to address :(\n=======\n\n\nVery strange Chinese food that is always worth at least one visit whether you are Chinese or not. This is not your typical Chinese food. Hell, I mean it's not even typical authentic (i.e. real food that real Chinese ppl eat) Chinese food!  Sure, the dishes are somewhat recognizable --- there's fried rice, noodles, ma po tofu, and porridge (I call it congee), but it's made *just so slightly differently* that it brings out an interesting sense of creativity and tasting experience. \n\nIt doesn't matter whether you end up hating the food or not. It's still worth going there once.\n\nService: I have had better luck getting take outs and delivery. Delivery has always been on-time (exactly 40-45 min), if not faster. Strangely, service at the actual restaurant appears to be worse. The place is ill-decorated, ill-lit, with awful music, mediocre service, and unforgivingly long wait times, should you decide to dine in.

Not \"Man vs Food\" level crazy hotness, but fierce enough that I won't be surprised to find a few unjust bad reviews based on that. There's no stars for you to tone down the spiciness level. Bottom line -- if you can't handle spiciness, order non-spicy food on the menu.\n\nDishes: here are my reviews for each dishes I've ordered\n\nMa Po Tofu --- GET IT! unless you can't eat pork, which would be a huge shame. it's a very thick, savory sauce filled with soft tofu and pork chunks.\n\nBraised watercress --- interesting blend with pumpkin, peanut, and beans. I would count this as fulfilling enough as a standalone vegetarian entree. Healthy, too.\n\nBaby Bok Choy in popcorn broth --- I saw a review complain the broth was too bland. Not true. The broth was LIGHT flavored. I don't think it's supposed to be a heavy dish. It's just some nice chicken broth with bok choy. Very healthy and a good companion dish to ma po tofu.\n\nMongolian Long Beans --- spicy spicy spicy! But goooooood. A giant mound of spicy long beans will serve well as a standalone entree, if you can handle the hotness, that is.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami --- sorry, but this was a meh to me. I simply did not like the overly smoky flavor of the meat, and did not really find the blend of red peppers and peanuts to be all that interesting.\n\nWest Lake Rice Porridge --- a very standard, homey congee dish, as a congee shoudl be.\n\nTea-smoked eel --- the name was better than the dish. Sorry, just more gimmicky than tasty to me.", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

We both love spicy and Asian inspired food so we couldn't wait to give this place a try, but the food was ridiculously fatty and over seasoned.  None of the plates we tried were even spicy.

However, I was turned off quickly after biting into a solid piece of pastrami flavored fat.  Overall, the pastrami was way too fatty and way too salty.\n\nSizzling Cumin Lamb: What wasn't fatty was overcooked and dry, but my wife thought this was the most palatable dish.  I couldn't get past the cumin.  There must have been an entire bottle encrusting the dish.  It wasn't too appealing to bite into solid chunks of cumin.\n\nBraised Pork Belly:  I realize pork belly is really fatty, but there was almost no discernable meat on the three mushy salted chunks of pork belly served.  The dish basically tasted like clumps of over salted lard served in a bowl of salt water.  \n\nBrisket Noodle Soup: We agreed this was the worst dish either of us ever had.  The brisket was too fatty and too salty, noodles were clumsy, and the broth was inedible and ruined anything it touched. My wife and I actually argued over whose side of the table the bowl had to stay on because neither of us wanted to have to smell it.", "author": "Greg L."}

It is incredibly crowded at all times, however, the ambiance is festive and colorful enough to make up for the lack of space. \n\nNow why did I rate this place three stars?

But I must preface this review by the fact that when you Google this resto the description under the link reads \"Mission Chinese Food serves Americanized Oriental Food and is located at Lung Shan Restaurant in the Mission.\" Yep Oriental! The only things Oriental are rugs and instant ramen, and if you call Jeremy Lin Oriental you'll likely get fired from your job. Long story short, direct your expectations away from \"Chinese Food.\" If you must, think \"Americanized Oriental Food.\" \n\nMe and an eater buddy of mine had decided on a few dishes, but we wanted to GO BIG. The menu is a bit daunting because you can't get a real feel of the eclectic and eccentric dishes like Kung Pao Pastrami. We were fortunate to have a very helpful, nice server by the name of Ellie C. that helped us dissect the menu and offered her \"must try\" dishes. I then realized the service at MCF, while at times frantic and rushed, is very friendly, helpful, and efficient. \n\nOur targets:\n- Salt Cod Fried Rice\n- Char Siu Pork Belly\n- Taiwanese Clams\n\nOur server Ellie suggested:\n- Szechuan Pickles\n- Chicken Wings w/ Explosive Chili Pepper\n- Kung Pao Pastrami\n\nEverything was a winner. The pickles our server suggested cut the spiciness of the chicken wings well and provided our only \"veggies.\" The wings were crispy, damn hot, left your tongue with a slight tingle on the back end, but was a great way to start the meal. As I've said before, best damn Salt Cod Fried Rice ever, period. Pork Belly was fatty and tender encased in a crispy, lightly fried exterior. Clams were just plain good. The Kung Pao Pastrami, a strong suggestion by Ellie, was good, but weird, and weirdly good! The smokey pastrami had great flavor on its own, but when stir-fried in with the usual kung pao components yielded a very eclectic dish. \n\nWe devoured everything, but did leave half a plate of Pastrami due to lack of room.  I think we did well with the 6 dishes between 2 stomachs. Add 3 beers and our grand total was $58. Not bad at all for Americanized Oriental Cuisine.\n\nTIP (re: Wait Time): Sign up, go for a drink, and come back. One page of names is about 45-60 minutes.

I was not seated right away and had to wait 5 mins to approach someone(not busy at all when I went).

Few minutes later I asked about anything that was offered from off the menu which he replied no. I asked for his recommendation on a small portion and entree. He recommended the lamb dish and peanuts. I guess my taste buds are not \"hipster\" because the food was \"different\".

Although not in the way I expected.\n\nThe flavors were BOLD. There's nothing delicate about the tastes here. Everything is big, and powerful, and in your face. It's like all the characteristic notes on traditional Chinese food got plugged into a stack of Marshall amps and played a power chord with their hair on fire. The chicken wings are probably the best example, but even the spicy cucumber appetizer is out for blood. \n\nThe drinks selection is excellent, and inexpensive ($3 for canned 21A), which is good because beer isn't an add-on but a necessity if you're one of those people who likes a breather amidst your bouts with culinary intensity. \n\nAdd to that the \"churn & burn\" dining tempo that gets you in and out as quickly as any hole-in-the-wall spot, blaring music from the 80's and 90's, and a big paper dragon looking down hungrily at you from the ceiling, and you get something that is as much a satire of the Chinese food world as a radical evolution of it.\n\nI give it 4 stars out of 5 because it wasn't necessarily an experience that was entirely pleasant. It's like an amusement park ride. Really fun every now and then, but not something I'd do every week, or every day. But it's certainly An Experience (TM), and a massively unique and original one, at that. The architects behind Mission Chinese are to be commended.\n\nFinally, If you have a friend coming in from out of town, I recommend you bring them here for some \"traditional SF Chinese food.\" Be sure not to tell them anything, and have a good story about why there's no chow mein on the menu.

There's been so much hype and so many people are convinced that this place is something really special. I can't help but wonder what I missed. \n\nI went there with a party of six on a Sunday evening, and fortunately we didn't have much of a wait, or I would have been even grumpier about my experience. We ordered a number of dishes, including some peanuts and pickles to start, coriander lamb, chow mein, chicken fried rice, chicken wings, salt cod fried rice, long beans, and mapo tofu. Most of those dishes felt like a big, salty, spicy slap in the face. The place is so dim that you can't really see what you're eating, and you also can't really hear anything due to the loud Pandora blaring from someone's laptop and the huge crowd, so it was really hard to tell what I was putting in my mouth (well, I'm pretty sure that what I was putting in my mouth was a lot of salt and spice with some fatty bits mixed in). The chow mein was probably the best of the dishes, but it basically tasted like any noodle dish at any decent Chinese place. \n\nI keep trying to figure out if I was, in fact, at the same place that everyone's been raving about. I wondered if I ordered the wrong things - but we ordered a pretty large percentage of the menu, so I think we got a good representation of what Mission Chinese has to offer.

My friends and I knew that it wasn't technically Mexican food, but it was tasty and we loved going there all the time. However, when I got older, I made friends with actual Mexicans, traveled to South American a few times, and now live in California... I no longer frequent Taco Bell (sure it is still tasty in a nostalgic, processed comfort food type of way... like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese).\n\nI love fusion food, I love Zantes Indian pizza, I love HRD Coffee Shop's Kimchi burritos/Mongolian cheesesteaks, I like chocolate with chili peppers and bacon, etc... but fusion doesn't automatically mean \"awesome\", it means someone is experimenting with new flavor combinations. Some flavor combinations are awesome and become new \"authentic classics\" and some are forgotten.\n\nUnfortunately, overall Mission Chinese Food falls a bit on the wrong side of \"awesome.\" Some of the dishes were tasty in a raw sort of way, but chefs are a little too enthusiastic with their spice rack. We went there for lunch on Sunday (no line! yay!) We had the following dishes (in order of best to worse).\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice - this was pretty tasty. A good blend of chinese sausage and scallion. I didn't notice the mackerel confit, but overall it was good.\n\nStir Fried Sweet Pea - decent, but forgettable.\n\nSizzling Cumin Lamb - the lamb was tasty, rich and fatty. A bit salty though (as was *everything* on the menu). Also surprisingly light on the cumin flavoring (which was surprising, given the BOLD, INTENSE flavoring the rest of the menu seems to scream). Most people in the group like it.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami - I like pastrami and it was tasty, again a little salty. Most of the group thought it was too weird (I didn't find the sweetness of the pastrami that distracting though). However... it wasn't good enough for me to want to order it again.\n\nSzechaun pickles - ok, these were terribly one-dimensional, they basically blindly dumped vinegar, salt and sichuan peppercorns over cabbage.\n\nOverall... everything was overly salted (even one of my friends who likes to salt her ketchup said this was too salty and had to eat a lot of rice), and the flavor/ingredients weren't balanced well. Also surprisingly the heat level was very tame (despite all the red chili peppers they add... they've intentional made it very mild for our American palates... just like Panda Express). I would consider going there again to try some other dishes (someone like the Westlake Rice Porridge)... but I would never recommend a friend to go there.\n\nFor the best Sichuan food I've had outside of Sichuan province (that is including spending a summer in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing).

But one thing that bothered me the most was our waitress with the OX nose ring, she was extremely rude to our party and just didn't have the friendly attitude that most HIPSTER restaurants have.  It's like we bothered her when we had questions or needed service.

Savory egg custard is a common PLAIN dish in the Chinese home. Easy to make: crack 2 eggs in a ceramic dish, add salt to taste, beat the living hell out of them, add water, and steam. Generally eaten with soy sauce, mix it in with your rice. \"It tastes different in the restaurant\"...that's because I don't use MSG at home.

Luckily, my friends thought to bring me by here this weekend, and I was quickly reminded!\n\nWe showed up at about 5:45 pm on a Sunday, and even though we had a large stroller with us, we were quickly seated near the door and offered a generous space to place the baby gear. The hostess was helpful--initially offering a bigger round table near the back, but then suggested that we could have this front table when she realized the current diners were paying.\n\nThe decor is sort-of non-decor :) But I'm fine with that--people are here for the food. It's a mish-mash of dragon suspended from the ceiling, Christmas lights, and old school tables and chairs. I made a trip to the restroom upon arrival to wash my hands, which necessitates that you walk through a prep area. I thought it was funny to see a sign above the door in that room ordering \"Do not ask anyone in this room any questions.\" I guess that's their way of saying \"these guys speak Chinese.\"\n\nFood came out quickly, as it was ready. We ordered the Szechuan pickles--a spicy cabbage/carrot/peanut dish, served cold. It was interesting combo, and tasty. Our hot wings came out next. Served under a bed of chili peppers, they weren't especially hot, but definitely made your lips tingle a bit. Honestly, I'm not much of a wings fan and could have done without them--and because they are only 7-8 to an order, it wasn't a great buy. The salt cod fried rice was the perfect complement, though, balancing out the spice in the wings. The words \"fried rice\" do NOT elicit excitement for me, but it was amazing. Finally, the slow-cooked pork belly is divine--served with pineapple and cucumber for a sweet and sour taste. It has a crispy exterior but was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful.\n\nI had a Back in Black (21st Amendment Black IPA) and one friend also got a beer. For the three of us, with 3 entrees, an appetizer, and 2 beers, the total was just under $50. Not bad at all, especially for some really awesome food.", "author": "Meredith D."}

Ok, place tough broccoli stems on plate, add poached oyster and overdone, chewy, stringy beef, then serve by surly server. Why?  Just too be weird and \"cutting edge\"? Pork jowl and winter radishes?  You mean cubes of fat mixed in with about 40 halved al dente radishes with green stems attached?  What?\n\nThe real tell tale sign here was the rice.

The eel was strange and goopy.  The chow mein was fine for chow mein.  Everything else was super spicy!  And if you try to eat family style and mix dishes, the spicy dishes will overwhelm the flavors in all the other dishes too!  The ma po tofu was also swimming in red oil, which I found gross.

Any and all these dishes can be had for much better and cheaper at authentic Chinese restaurants all over the city, albeit not at any one place.\n\nI love my spicy food, but the over-reliance on spice made the non-spicy dishes seem bland in contrast.  The tea-smoked eel lacked the strong eel taste and texture.  Ditto, the salted cod fried rice needed more salted cod - don't skimp on what makes the dish delicious!  The sizzling cumin lamb had the distinct lamb taste but not much else for flavor.  The spicy dishes were a bit better - the ma po tofu was just standard fare, the Mongolian long beans were good, and the \"mouth-watering\" chicken was the best because of the mound of red peppers to chew on.  Spiciness is good, but it goes even better when there are other complementary flavors.\n\nAre the dishes worth the wait and $10-ish per plate?

Sadly we were all very disappointed. We ordered the Mongolian Long Beans, Broccoli Beef Brisket, Salt Cod Fried Rice, and the Spicy Beef Chow Mein. The beans were good but the only flavor you could taste was fire. Yes, we were told it was spicy but I was expecting a lot more flavor (and really didn't want to have to resort to putting soy sauce on everything). I thought the beef brisket was the best thing we ordered but the main flavor is definitely some sort of bbq sauce, which is a little overpowering. The beef and broccoli were cooked perfectly though. The fried rice was fine, nothing special, and pretty fishy tasting. The chow mein was a huge disappointment. The entire dish tasted burnt/smoky and you couldn't taste any of flavor. Plus it was pretty dry. I only ate a few bites of it. My fiance said that the flavors were pretty authentic but everything was underwhelming.

Too bad :(\n3) Kung Pao Pastrami - Another great dish but I don't think I'd ever crave this.\n4) Sizzling Lamb Cumin - I think I almost choked on the cumin-flavored smoke.  However, after the smoke had settled down and we started to breathe normally, the lamb belly was delicous!!  Would DEFINITELY get this again.\n5) Salt Cod Fried Rice - I'm not sure if it's because there was too much of a spicy party in my mouth, but I didn't really taste anything special about this dish.  Everyone else seemed to like it a lot though.\n6) Westlake Rice Porridge - Another favorite of mine!  There's oxtail and crab and one huge ostrich egg.  Usually this is supposed to come out first but I'm actually glad it came out last since it was a nice end to our meal.\n\nThere's always long lines for a reason but you'll come out smelly and sweaty and full of \"gourmet\" Chinese food.

It's NOT chinese food!  Veal, uni, beef cheeks, eel rolls?? These aren't typically found in chinese dishes.   And the clientele and servers there were mostly non-asians.  Four of us ordered a bit too much food: \n\n- Pork belly: 4 big pieces of crunchy-on-the-outside, melting hot and fatty on-the-inside pork belly.  \n- Uni with egg custurd: first time i ever enjoyed uni\n- Veal ribs: some fatty boney mess -- don't get this\n- Tea-smoked eel rolls: disappointing. Not a lot of flavor. Still pretty unique.\n- Mouth watering chicken (that's the name): probably my favorite. So salty but in a good way. Chicken hearts were yummy.\n- Chicken rice: nothing special\n- Spicy chicken wings: the peppers were too numbing. Couldn't eat more than 2 wings. It wasn't very spicy. It was just numbing.\n- Beef cheeks with gai lan: beef cheeks were tender but this dish was nothing special in flavors.\n\nOne of the male caucasian servers was quite rude, but it's ok.  I go there for food, not for service or ambiance.  They play hiphop and american music.  The dining area was too dim, i couldn't even see my food very well.", "author": "Jessica N."}

I chalked up the less than stellar rating to the Bourdain syndrome (Bourdain hits up a restaurant-It blows up-people expect to be blown away and are disappointed), but I really enjoyed my meal here. Here's why:\n\n1) Price: The entrees were priced between $10-12, but HUGE. We ate till we were full and had leftovers for 2 full meals. MCF - wallet friendly! \n\n2) Ambiance: Dragon hanging from the ceiling. Red, dim mood lighting. Christmas lights accenting the walls. Empty Cristal bottles filled with fake flowers. MCF - Kitchsy, but hipster-cool in a way that would only work in the MIssion!\n\n3) Taste: DELISH! We ordered the (i) Thrice Cooked Bacon; (ii) Broccoli Beef Cheek; (iii) Li Bao Dry Braised Noodles; and (iv) Salt Cod Fried Rice. MCF - \"American Oriental food\" at its best! \n\nThe noodles were my least favorite dish. They were lackluster and kinda tasteless. Thank goodness the other dishes were standouts! The thrice cooked bacon was sinfully satisfying: chewy discs of korean rice cakes were an interesting contrast against the smoky, savory pieces of pork belly. I really enjoyed the cheeky play on broccoli beef: tender pieces of beef cheeks and chinese broccoli. I LOVED the salt cod fried rice. I could've had that dish alone as an entree. My bf thought it was salty, but I have a salty palate. \n\nOverall, don't let the 3.5 star rating deter you. It's definitely not authentic Chinese food, but it's an interesting, delicious, and innovative take on Chinese food, nonetheless.", "author": "Monelle A."}

I think this place is hit or miss with some folks because of the price point (for Chinese food), but it wasn't really any more expensive than a Chinese banquet restaurant; plus, the quality of meat was better.\n\nWe came shortly before 5pm (when dinner starts), so we were seated right away.  We ordered the kung pao pastrami, broccoli beef cheek, tingly lamb noodle soup, tea-smoked eel, and salt cod fried rice.  Our favorite dish was the broccoli beef cheek - incredibly tender.  The kung pao pastrami was indeed spicy, so I didn't try very much of it.  The tea-smoked eel was probably my second favorite dish, and the salt cod fried rice added a nice complement to some of the heavier dishes.  I did enjoy the lamb in the tingly soup but I hated the tingle - it just lasted too long for me to enjoy the dish.  I think next time, I'll skip the tingly soup and just order the sizzling cumin lamb.\n\nAmbiance is entertaining, very hipster SF.  I think for a while, we were the only Asian people dining at the restaurant, which is normally a bad sign but I suppose Mission Chinese pulls it off alright.  Service was fine, though this would not be an appropriate restaurant for non-English speaking families.\n\nOverall, everything was pretty good and we enjoyed our meal.

Saw it get good where you had to choose which menu you wanted, either Mission Chinese or Lung Shan.

Watched it become basically all Mission Chinese and have supported your hard work by bringing multiple guests to dine, and recommending your place by word of mouth. I live here. I'm a local. \nSo I was shocked, angered and embarrassed when the young man playing host (and first representative of your restaurant) treated us, not just rudely, but with contempt! Our egregious offense? We walked in and tried to sit at a table in a half empty restaurant. He talked over the crowd to us. He scolded us by repeating no less than 5x in a row \"the rules are very simple\" and told us there are many other restaurants in the area and we could eat there. Add that he got into a staring contest with me before shaking his head at us in disgust. This all happened in less than 1 minute of our arriving. My out of town guest then saw him talking to the kitchen and gesturing our way, which prompted her to say \"I'm not so sure they aren't going to spit in our food. We'd better leave.\"  WHAT?!  We could have been a drunken homeless crowd off the street and NOT deserved this abysmal attitude. \nI feel amazed that all the hard work and dedication the kitchen and wait staff put into this restaurant has changed to this turd's arrogant bull.  Here's a few OTHER rules to remember; COMMON COURTESY!  RESPECT YOUR ELDERS! or how about an original \"The customer is always right!!??\"  Amazingly poor form.  \nHave him try that attitude with your TV friends Martha Stewart or Anthony Bourdain. OR EVEN BETTER, send him to work at your new NY restaurant. If he pulls that with some nice Italian ladies in NY, he'll be deaf in one ear and walking 'funny.'  Good luck!  p.s.

Now, I've heard a few good things about Mission Chinese Food, and have been wanting to try it for some time now.  How fortunate of me to not even ask for it, but have great friends just show up with food.  \n\nAlthough this place exceeds regular chinese food joints, it doesn't do so by far.  While some dishes add a little  extra something to set it apart from the others, some simple things like chow mein are far beyond reach of the real thing.  Therefore, while a 3 star seems short, its more appropriate for a 3.5 stars.  Not quite a fan, but admirable for some of the flavors and creativity.\n\nLet's start with the bad:\n-Chow Mein - granted it was takeout, but even with that, the chow mein shouldn't be so mushed up and soaked in sauce.  Sure I like my sauce, but when the noodle itself starts losing its consistency and almost mixes in with the consistency of the sauce, that's a big NO thank you.  Even the nice pickled greens which offered crunchiness to the dish was unable to save this\n\n-3x Cooked Bacon - pretty much just thicker slices of bacon cooked perhaps stewed, broiled, and then stir fried into the rice cake.  The rice cake was too hard, and there was too much salt in this.  Bacon and Pork Belly are the same thing people.  Don't be fooled when someone throws out a miraculous dish with the words: P-o-r-k B-e-l-l-y\n\n-Ma Po Tofu - I know lots of people usually like this, but over here, its just like any other restaurant IMO.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't great.\n\nThe good:\n-Rice Noodle with Unagi - i like rice noodle, and I like unagi.  However, the rice noodle wasn't fresh enough and tended to be too thick and hard right against the soft unagi.  I think what works for rice noodle dishes is a contrast in texture such as shrimp or the chives in the ground beef, or the bbq pork in some dimsum restaurants.  While the texture just didn't work for me, I did like the flavor and the marry of japanese cuisine in a chinese twist.\n\n-West Lake Porridge - so simple, yet it amazed me how good this was simply by changing water and cornstarch roux with congee.  The flavor is still there but instead of a thick soup, you get a thick hearty porridge.  \n\n-Uni and scallop over steamed egg and roe - perhaps my favorite because it twists so much japanese influence on a traditional chinese dish, steamed egg.  Roe could have been excluded, but the uni and raw bay scallop definitely gave it a different flavor that was appreciated.  \n\n-Salted Cod Fried Rice - let me say, when you order this from ABC, from those other chinese restaurants, it does not fail you.  It's a go to kind of rice since the fish is perfectly salty and everything else in the rice just goes well with it.  But here that salted cod tastes different.  It could be (I don't know) that they cure their own cod, but theres a nice richness and no overpowering flavor in the  salted cod that's presented in the rice.  \n\nOverall, its a fairly interesting experience and worth checking out again because having eaten the same chinese food years and years, its nice and refreshing to see some new ideas applied to it.", "author": "Vincent K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-09-08", "description": "I think the food here is good, and I find the \"creativity\" in their menu interesting, but guys, this place is way overhyped.  \n\nTo start with, this is not real Chinese food, and I don't think it pretends to be either.  (If it does, then it is no better than an average Chinese restaurant.) So let's accept this and move on and think of this place as a \"modern\" and inventive cuisine, albeit in a jarringly mismatched Chinese restaurant setting.  But the dragon in the ceiling is pretty awesome!!\n\nThe use of western ingredients in Chinese preparation is a cheeky twist, for example, Kung Pao Pastrami and Savory Egg Custard with Sea Urchin.  Such pairings are creative and refreshing and opens a new perspective on how to re-invent traditional foods with new ingredients.  Hats off to the chefs for their creative genius.  \n\nHowever, the execution of such new dishes at times falls short of expectations.  \nSlow-Cooked Char-Siu Pork Belly - this just has \"yummy\" written all over it (I mean, what part \"slow-cooked\", \"char-siu\", or \"pork belly\" does not make your mouth water), but here's where 1+1+1 equals less than 3.  The resulting dish did not achieve the normal tenderness of a slow-cooked pork belly, nor does it have the awesome smoky, savory-sweetness of a classic char-siu.  The flavor of the meat was less developed than it should have been.  The consolation prize of the dish was the soy-cured egg - smoky and salty with a soft melty yolk - makes you want to have more.\n\nBroccoli Beef Cheek - I suppose this is the upscale version of the ubiquitous Chinese take out menu item #54 \"Beef with Broccoli\" - turned out ok.  The beef was tasty, and we were pleasantly surprised to bite into a whole poached oyster, which adds so much richness to the dish.  However, the quality of the Chinese Broccoli was quite poor - several pieces were fibrous and tough.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice - turned out to be the dish we couldn't stop eating.  Salt Cod is usually quite salty, but they did a great job toning down the salt here, and produced a tasty fried rice.  The rice was cooked well - dry but tender.  The salt cod and the Chinese sausage both contribute to that savory goodness that only preserved meats can provide, rounded out by the freshness of the scallions and softness of the egg.  \n\nI would go back for the Salt Cod Fried Rice, but may have to think twice about some of the other dishes, and waiting in a long line outside for a table.", "author": "Thomas L."}

I was fine with that- considering Bauer's rave.\n\nPlus it's supposed to be the \"best non-Chinese Chinese food\" in San Francisco, at a really chintzy Chinese restaurant in the \"cool\" part of town.\n\nI'm down with that. I'm all about a good gimmick and a great chef story.\n\nFOOD: The Tiger Salad was amazing. Fresh herbs and wrapped with cold sheets of  pasta in a fantastic seasoned sauce. Great starter- although huge portion size. You'd think there wouldn't be complaints in that department, but I'm a traditionalist: starters are to whet the appetite, not become your whole meal.\n\nI followed that up with the General Tso Veal Rib. I love me some ribs, but I've also given up pork a decade ago, so this opportunity had me frothing. Huge slab of flesh with fork and knife dug into it, swathed by an assortment of onion/pepper slivers in Tso sauce. The big hunk of veal looked tempting so I started gnawing happily, until I realized that the majority of it was fat. Ever realize that you're masticating fat directly? I got nauseous from that thought, despite the meat portion (what little there was) tasting great. Took the bits of meat and veggies home in a to-go.\n\nSERVICE: Great, tall blond server who knew her shiz. She gave great recommendations and was quick. The one unsmiling Asian guy? He gave my table attitude when we asked what a certain dish he plopped on our table was. \"Do you want it or I'll take it away,\" he said. He reached for the bowl. We repeated our question of what it was and he just stared at us and said it was what we ordered. He needs to be clued in that the put-upon attitude isn't synonymous with no-frills aesthetic. \n\nAMBIANCE: It's the hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, complete with white plates, plastic chopsticks, and regular carafes of water. Decor is standard for this type of restaurant: Paper dragon across the entire restaurant hanging from the ceiling while top 40 hiphop blasts out of the speakers (need to be replaced, btw- one receiver was going in and out my whole meal).\n\nOverall, I'd go back, because I saw more things on the menu I'd want to try.

I'm one of those Chinese people who believe the dirtier, smellier, and closely packed it is, the better the Chinese food (note: this works for Chinese restaurants only). So I really had no expectations when I walked into Mission Chinese Food. I barely noticed the metal and plastic chairs with riped vinyl seats. I could barely feel the stickyness of the table. And the dingy, musty, dark room around me didn't faze me. What DID surprise me was my very pristine, very hipster, very skinny jean wearing friend sitting across from me at this unassuming restaurant. Even more, I was befuddled as to why HE was the one who brought me here. In true hipster fashion, he always brought me to trendy eateries in the gentrified Mission and upscale food spots downtown. What were we doing here??\n\nOne look at the menu and I knew: we were not in for an ordinary Chinese experience. How did I know? The prices. Not your mom and pop Chinese restaurant with $28 meals that serve 4. Nope, here each plate is $10-$15 and they sound like amazing dishes that could be served in any upscale restaurant. And they're written in English. \n\nWe ordered the Tea Smoked Eel Roll, the Salt Cod Fried Rice, a Scallop Custard, and the Pork Belly. Everything was AMAZING. Again, I am not a high class Chinese food type of girl, but cheap Chinese doesn't compare to the progressive dishes they have going on at Mission. While I didn't LOVE the Tea Smoked Eel, it was really interesting and unique. The Salt Cod Fried Rice wasn't anything special--it was a typical dish that you can order at any Chinese restaurant, but here it just sounds fancier. The Scallop Custard was soooo delicious. But the Pork Belly was the star of the show for me. Crispy and crunchy on the outside and moist and tender and juicy on the inside. I love the Hoisin glaze and how it slightly sticks to the back of your teeth. So good. I wish at still ate meat. :[ \n\nOverall, this place merits 4 stars for me.

The food was either kinda bland or just too spicy and not in a good way (hint..hint...mapo tofu.) The pork belly was a bit too dry for my liking. It wasn't juicy and it was cold. My friend ordered a salad and it never came. We tried so hard to get the waitress attention to ask about the order. It seemed like they were doing something, but not really. I suspected that they were equipped with a sixth sense, \"I think someone might need something. Quick! Avoid eye contact and turn the other way around!\" \n\nFinally when we got one of them cornered, her reaction was just 'u-huh' and she carried away with her business. Needless to say, we never got the salad and they were just too busy apologizing 20 minutes too late when we got our bill. \n\nIt's not worth the wait and it's fitting for white people who think \"Oh, this seems different than regular Chinese food, hence it must be good.\" Eh, it's all yours!", "author": "Perry S."}

I got the Mongolian string beans and my friend ordered the pork belly. Both of us were blown away by the flavor, and especially by the balanced spiciness: the food was really spicy, but the spice was just part of the flavor; it didn't take over the experience.\n\nAs for the rest of the experience, there was a lot left to be desired. They had terrible music blasting for what would have been the entire time had the power not kept going out. It was like being at some awful hipster dance party with worse music and eating instead of dancing. They were slow to bring us water when we sat down and slow to take our order. When we finished, there was no \"Would you like another round of beers and a look at the menu?\" They just dropped the check on the table with a perfunctory thank-you and that was that.\n\nLike I said, I really enjoyed the food, but the atmosphere and service were deal breakers.", "author": "Charles P."}

I don't know if it's authentic or not but whatever they made here was really good.\n\nDecided to do a full up family style tasting (SCORE!).\nTea leave smoked eel, thrice cooked bacon, explosive wings, fried rice with chinese sausage, and a lamb and greens dish. Everything was really good. I have to say though that the smoked eel and the thrice cooked bacon were by far the winners though. Very flavorful and oddly enough with the bacon, it wasn't the bacon that was the reason why it was an awesome dish. It can even be ordered vegi, is how good it is. The explosive wings were an experience to try once, but nothing special. They did happen to achieve a taste that wasn't all heat, but at the same time, it didn't have any flavor either. The unanimous opinion at the table I think was, they are numb tasting. Like that's all my mouth was after ... and tingling.\n\nSort of a loud spot and cramped but it's the mission so I have sort of gotten used to that. Large dragon light is put overhead stretching across the whole restaurant. I noted the music selection because it was like a throwback to highschool. Da Brat, Ja Rule, The Fugees all loudly playing through the stereo in the back.

I think the prices are more than fair for what you get.  I don't understand people's criticism about price.  Comparing MCF to a regular cheap Chinese place on price is comparing apples and oranges.  Like maybe a bruised red delicious to an in season mandarin.  \n\nThe thrice cooked bacon was a star because of the chewy rice cakes.  Awesome.  The other star for us was the cod fried rice.  The texture of the rice is outstanding.  I also really liked the cat fish soup.  I was disappointed with the cumin lamb.  The lamb was cooked really well, but the cumin strength was a bit much for me.  I knew that from reviews going in and I ordered it anyway.  I view that as my error.

A little too much hype. I know this place is supposed to be a twist on traditional Chinese food-- I get the irony of the typical sit-down Chinese restaurant, but the food served is actually more modern and twists what people usually expect from Chinese food. The thing is, the food isn't executed well enough to pull the whole thing off, IMO.\n\nFirst off, the only impressive dish that we tried was the Savory Egg Custard. This was more like cold broth, uni, & cooked egg whites; not an actual custard. It was good & very different, but I felt like there was something missing from it to really make the uni stand out. I would order this again solely based on the fact that I haven't seen a dish like this anywhere else. \n\nSlow-cooked Char Siu Pork Belly- I grew up on Chinese pork belly stews (you know, the kind that looks like the meat has been dyed by broth & soy sauce) so I know what to expect from the texture of \"slow-cooked\" pork belly. This was not slow-cooked, it was deep fried. Biting into the meat, it still smelled a little unclean (the way that fresh pork smells at a butcher shop.) The soy-cured egg was incredibly salty and after eating the noodles with hoisin sauce, the egg seemed ten times saltier. I expected a lot from this dish and I was rooting for it, but overall, the preparation just wasn't appetizing. Not a great combo. \n\nMa Po Tofu- I knew this was going to be spicy, but it seemed less creative & overpriced when I saw that Sriracha was drizzled on top of the dish. I don't think I could taste the flavor of the pork or sauce because all I ever got in each bite were HUGE pieces of different spices. It felt like I was eating tree bark and wood chips with tofu. There was too much star anise and the whole thing tasted like black licorice to me. \n\nI would be open to returning here and trying other dishes, but only with a group of 4-5 people because it'd be better to share these overpriced items.", "author": "Janette H."}

It was around 9:30pm on a Sunday night and my friend was craving Chinese. Since we were in the area, Mission Chinese was the only restaurant that could accommodate us at this late time frame. The menu lacked excitement and \"ooohhs and \"aaaahs\" so I decided to go for something familiar with MCF's twist. I ordered the Hainam Chicken Rice and my friend ordered the Open faced \"Chinese BBQ\" Sandwich. Yes, I gave my friend a funny look for ordering that granted he wanted Chinese food.\n\nSo the rice, it had more damn peanuts in there than chicken and it was waaay too salty. My friend's meal was just unappetizing. It looked great when it came to our table but the taste was just BAD!! There was nothing Chinese about this dish. I thought the \"Chinese BBQ\" implied that the flavor would be like the meat in char siu bao. This was straight up American style BBQ done badly!!

We tried the following 4 dishes:\n\n- Chilled Buckwheat Noodles - delicious, but because I don't like parsley this was my least favorite dish of the day. \n- Savory Egg Custard - an absolute revelation and a 5-star favorite - it's a steamed egg with big bites of sea urchin, trout roe etc, and it was an interesting mix of flavors and textures, and it has a refreshing feel, much like a gazpacho. It's worth the trip just for this dish (but that's maybe because I love uni so much)\n- Lamb Face Noodle Soup - delicious and just the right amount of spicy. The lamb definitely smells a little gamey. My question was how do people tell regular lamb and lamb face apart. We certainly couldn't. It just felt a little gimmicky. \n- Smoked Beef Brisket Soup Noodles - the brisket (I think) is smoked American style. It definitely has a southern feel/smell to it. That's the main thing that made the dish an interesting fusion, coz it's definitely no ordinary beef noodle soup that you can get at any other regular Chinese restaurant.\n\nThis is definitely a hole-in-the-wall, questionable decor kind of place.

Who knew that scene could taste so good? Super spicy scene. Mmm. Toto, we're not in Lung Shan anymore. \n\nI didn't mind the wait. I'm a very patient person. A less patient person might get verklempt and/or irate. That's not necessary. Don't stray too far if you do wait. Much like medicine, prognoses about time are wrong. \n\nWe sat down soon enough. What a cramped restaurant! So many more seats than when it was Mission Street Food. More opportunity to eat and see and been seen in the scene. Maybe they wanted it to be like a Shanghai subway? So crowded, but I liked it. Lots of cute boys in plaid and pretty girls in pastels. Pastels must be coming back into style. Note to self.\n\nThe food is wonderful. Spicy! When I was twelve I swallowed some crazy peppers in the International District in Seattle and I've been somewhat of a jock since, trying to outdo my personal best. Good amount of spice here, especially on the chicken wings which are dry rubbed in five spice. Yum. Not for chapped lips after a long hike, another note to self. Ma po tofu was my favorite dish, made with kurobota pork and sichuan peppers. The tingly lamb soup with shanghai noodles was my other favorite. Can I have two favorites? The menu said that the lamb broth was numbing. Not so, but it was a really interesting flavor that I can't place. My friends loved the thrice cooked bacon with rice cakes. Can't have three favorites, can I? Definitely not in Lung Shan anymore. My friend's boyfriend called him during dinner and asked him to order a General Tso's for him, to which Nicho responded, \"I don't think they have that here.\" No General Tso, but there is Kung Pao with \"explosive chili\". I must try this chili. \n\nIt's so loud inside because of all the pretty people laughing and Dr. Dre rapping about having bbqs everyday and driving fancy cars. We weren't really using our words, so the sound was okay. Occasional grunts and lapping up water, and some pointing, nodding, and smiling.\n\nWords are a hindrance. Just go and taste for yourself.

The peanuts had the skin still on them which I like.  Nothing too crazy though - it is what it sounds like.  A small bowl of peanuts with vinegar and some anise seeds.\n\nThrice Cooked Bacon.  Not a huge fan but then again I don't like smoked meats too much.  Strong smokey flavor.  The gummy rice cakes were good.\n\nSizzling Cumin Lamb.  Thought it was pretty well done.  I think they were short ribs (?) and the taste and consistency was excellent.

Perhaps all the press I had heard about the place made my expectations too high, or perhaps it was due to the limited selections they have for vegetarians. In any case, though, the food was decent but not amazing, the service was lackluster, and the experience was certainly nothing to write home about.\n\nMission Chinese is buried in the heart of the Mission district, looking just like a typical \"hole in the wall\" place. A group of five of us came for Sunday lunch; we were prepared to wait for a little bit (given all that we had heard), but were pleasantly surprised that the place wasn't too busy, even at the noon hour. The layout and decor inside is somewhat tacky and kitsch - think cheap plastic tables and chairs crammed together, with random ornaments - a huge paper dragon, for example - hanging from the wall.\n\nService was pretty spotty from the beginning. I noticed on their menu, too, that some of the dishes were noted as \"vegetarian option available\". When I inquired to our waitress what exactly the vegetarian \"thrice cooked bacon\" entailed - a perfectly reasonable question, in my opinion, given the title of the dish! - she brusquely told me to read the description in the menu: \"description provided in the menu\" was her entire response. If I had been known what the vegetarian option of the dish was based on the description, I wouldn't have asked her in the first place!\n\nAs it turns out, the vegetarian version of the dish is basically cooked rice cakes mixed with bitter melon, other vegetables, and chilis. The dish itself was actually pretty decent; I enjoyed the rice cakes, which were sticky and flavorful. The other members of our table ordered a couple of the meat dishes, and also reported similar results - each of the dishes were decent, but they said none of them was particularly great or amazing.\n\nI would have considered giving Mission Chinese four stars, but the poor service and atmosphere knock it down to three stars. Tl;dr version: decent food, lackluster decor and service, and certainly overhyped.", "author": "Jeremy H."}

The first time I would have given as a four star experience - good food, decent service, and mellow atmosphere.  The second time was a solid three star - the food was not as good and the service was still ok and the atmosphere was still mellow.  \n\nThis last experience is definitely a two star. My boyfriend's sister came to town and we talked about this Chinese place in our neighborhood that had gotten rave reviews.  Then she and I go there - we order two things to split, I order a tea and she orders a Mexican coke.  I got my tea somewhat fast and then after a somewhat long wait, our first dish.  Our out of town visitor reminds the somewhat ditzy acting waitress about her coke that she had ordered, which she brought over about five minutes later.  After about fifteen or twenty minutes after finishing our first dish, the waitress came over to prove it wasn't just an act.\n\n\"Here's your check!\"\n\n\"Um... we never got our second dish.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to take it off the check then?\"\n\n\"No, we love paying for food we don't eat....\"\n\nReally, service this bad should get two stars just for the humor.  \n\nAnd the food this visit was only about a star.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-10-12", "description": "I find Mission Chinese to be a \"must try\" restaurant when visiting San Francisco.  It truly reflects what the 2011 San Francisco hipster strata is all about:  a creative, aloof, innovative, young, third world, fast-paced, laid-back melange of California urban culture mated with really good food.\n\nThis is not your grandmother's Chinese restaurant.  You see sesame seeds actually used here to add taste rather than texture.  I've been here twice with my husband, who loves spicy Chinese food.  I don't.  \n\nHe had the most provocative thing he saw on the menu, Kung Pao Pastrami.  Both of us thought it was really good.  But there's no way I could have eaten even a quarter of the whole dish because it was so spicy.  And you can't pick out the spices, either. They're everywhere mixed in with those aforementioned sesame seeds.  If you love spicy, it's definitely worth a try.\n\nThat same evening, I ordered the Salt Cod Fried Rice.  It was really tasty, and a large enough portion for three or four, but I wouldn't want to make a whole meal out of it.  The salt cod was perfectly prepared, moist and not overcooked.  The rice was flecked with lots of green onion and probably cilantro, and onions, I think.\n\nBut neither one of these dishes alone really makes a meal.  The pastrami came with a bowl of rice, but still the meal was off balance, not enough greens.  So to try to balance it, I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles.  Cool, cucumbers, peanut sauce, greens, etc.  But labeled as a 'small plate', it was still too large to match with the other dishes without having a slough of leftovers.\n\nUnfortunately, we got no guidance from our server.  She was barely interested in our presence at the table.  She didn't seem to be too interested in anything, so it wasn't like she was distracted.\n\nI find it interesting that the so-called \"hipsters\" who love to slam a restaurant for poor customer service and bad food (see previous reviews below) are also from the very same ilk who provide it.  Maybe it's a generational thing.  But the service at Mission Chinese is cold and nonchalant at best.  This is something (social skills) they need to work on instead of their tattoos.\n\nOur second visit garnered a better result for me.  Husband again ordered the pastrami.   I ordered the 'small plate' fried pork belly with noodles and cucumbers.  I thought it had all the elements I was looking for in the description.  But this time, the server cautioned me that this was more of an appetizer and that I might find it wanting more.  So taking her advice I ordered a 'small plate' Hainam Chicken Fried Rice.  It came first.\n\nIt was good, but again, it wasn't a meal.  Bits of chicken mixed with fried rice, a bit of chicken fat for flavor and some vinegar to cut the greasy feeling.  I'd order it again, but I was anticipating the pork belly appetizer.  \n\nThis is where I should have started.  It was remarkably good.  The pork belly was fried to the point of caramelization on the outside and it was like butter on the inside.  Eye-rollingly good.  It came resting upon some wide rice noodles rolled up with cilantro and scallions, a few pickled cucumber slices, a soy cured 'soft boiled' egg and hoisin sauce.  Yum!  This was everything I was looking for and I would have been very satisfied (and had more change in my pocket) if I had ordered only this.\n\nBoth times, I topped it off with their Ginger Beer from Australia.  I love it.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, make sure you take a trip to the restroom at the back of the restaurant.  You get to walk through the food staging area, see huge cuts of barbecued beef, lamb, pork prepared expertly, workers checking their iPads for orders and reviews (I surmise) and finally arrive at an adequately clean (for a very busy small restaurant) out the back by the dumpsters, where the air is amazingly refreshing.\n\nThis place could certainly benefit from a nicer piece of real estate, but I think that would somehow cheapen the whole experience.  This is raw San Francisco - heart of the Mission District, heart of the economic crisis from which it sprang (good out of work cooks looking for a cheap way to ply their wares) and really innovative food.  Be sure to check out the beer cans resting in the jaws of the giant dragon suspended from the ceiling.  \n\nOh yeah, and if you're in a hurry, tell them you're willing to share the big table at the back.  Just be prepared to experience the loud rap and hip hop music emanating from the ghetto buster iPod in the back.  Remember, this is not your grandmother's Chinese restaurant.

The atmosphere couldn't be more mundane mid 70s dive bar, with it's drop-ceiling and tired banquet hall/church basement type chairs.

I've grown up eating traditional Cantonese food in the Sunset, Richmond, and Chinatown, so I wondered how good a place in the Mission could be.  \n\nWe got to MCF a little after 7:00 pm on a Tuesday night and unbelievably there was a hefty list of people waiting outside.  We put our name down on the list (make sure you check that your party is completely there) and proceeded to wait for 45 minutes for a table.  When the host told me this was actually a slow night, I really couldn't believe it.\n\nWhen we finally sat down, we ordered the dan dan noodles, the ox tail porridge, spicy chicken wings, pork belly, and ma po tofu.  All of these are dishes I've eaten many times before at other Chinese restaurants so I already had some expectation on what they would taste like.  \n\nThe decor of this place is very interesting.  It's a cross between the hole in the wall places you'd find in Chinatown (but cleaner), and the hokey Chinese Restaurant you'd find in Idaho, or somewhere in the Midwest (red lanterns, Christmas lights on the side, a vase of fake roses).  It's a little retro, but I think it definitely fits the Mission.  \n\nService was pleasant and the food came out fairly quickly.\nHere's a quick review of a few of the dishes:\n\nOx tail Porridge - Definitely our favorite.  It wasn't as thick as your typical porridge, but it had a lot of additional ingredients that made this a very satisfying dish.\n\nMa Po Tofu - More flavor than you would get at a typical Chinese place.

After reading an article, and hearing about the recent buzz, I decided to give it another try, focusing on new additions on the menu.\n\nI ordered:\n\nSavory egg custard - interesting but won't order it again, too salty; and the slimy custard plus the slimy roe plus the slimy uni make an imbalanced combination with respect to textures. I love slimy and briny food in the right contexts but the combination of these three ingredients did not work for me.\n\nThrice-cooked bacon - Good stir fry. I would order it again. However, it's not worth the hype. It's like any good stir-fried rice cake dish that one can get at a decent chinese restaurant. I speculate that the hype is due to reviewers who rarely encounter rice cake dishes.\n\nMouth-watering chicken - average. Might order it again if I'm lazy to make it myself. It's a little too oily/salty for me. I prefer my homemade version with cloud-ear fungus, celery, sichuan peppercorns. I speculate that all the hype is due to reviewers who haven't had the real version or think chicken hearts constitute an innovative ingredient.\n\nRed mustard green - my favorite out of the dishes I have had. Not too oily, well stir-fried. Will order it again. However, it's unlikely I will make this place my destination just because they can stir-fry some Asian veggie well.\n\nIn conclusion, average food that is a bit too salty and fatty. Spiciness and flavor in the dish are too one-dimensional. For a place that has this much hype and this long wait, I would expect not only innovative combination (which some dishes do have) but also a delicious spin off from the traditional sichuan cuisine. However, the dishes either do not rise above or fare worse than the traditional dishes. If you just want some good chinese food in the Mission without any wait, go to Heung Yuen. If you want serious Sichuan, Mission is not the right place.", "author": "pH R."}

Are you vegetarian? Get this without meat. Contrary to what the name suggests, the bacon is only a small part of the flavor, and one of the least important.

Huge chunks of pastramai, seasoned with a mouth-tingling collection of spices (mmm, sichuan peppercorn), are accompanied by peanuts and peppers and potatoes and crunchy celery. The entire thing is tossed in a spicy, sinus clearing sauce. The only downside with the dish is its inconsistency. Sometimes you'll get the perfect balance of ingredients, but other times you'll have a celery salad with a few pieces of pastrami.\n\n[anything] Fried Rice -- These guys know how to do their fried rice. The salt cod version is a good bet, as is the breakfast fried rice (the most recent iteration comes with salmon roe -- woah).

Food came in 45 minutes, even though the lady who took my phone order said it would take an hour. \n\nI ordered the tingly lamb noodle soup and hainam chicken fried rice. The lamb noodle soup was tasty at first, but then my mouth began to feel numb similar to the sensation prior to a dental procedure. I swear that broth is lidocaine-infused - and the dish was not spicy at all! What's the point?? The hainam chicken rice was forgettable. From the online menu desciption, I visualized a dish similar to Singaporean chicken rice. But, hell, no, chicken came in tiny bits like you get in a Nissin noodle soup and the main protein in that rice  is roasted peanuts. I know there's supposed to be some wine in it but that gave the rice a slightly mushy texture and sour taste. Almost like eating pickled rice or, worse, spoiled fried rice (my tummy was fine the day after so the latter option was thankfully not a reality).\n\nOh, one more thing, with the food price + delivery fee I'd expect at least there would be chopsticks and/or plastic spoons & forks. Sorry, my delivery did not come with those either. \n\nI'm still baffled with all the hype and good reviews this place got. A number of well-known food reviewers say that it really is not Chinese food - then why the term \"Chinese\" in the name and the claim of Szechuan influences? I quipped to my colleague the next day to never trust non-Asian revierwers to judge and rate Asian cuisine. \n\nGo to any \"real\" Szechuan restaurant to get an appricaition of glorious spicy food from the Szechuan region of China. If dives are your thing, stay with the authentic Chinese cuisine (not the usual American Chinese takeout type you'll find around your neighborhood corner!) you would find in SF's Chinatown - just observe or ask around on where the native Chinese speakers eat.

When I read this was great Chinese food in the NY times I had to try it out and see for myself.  Usually my parents would tell me the top Chinese restaurants they've been too and this wasn't even on their radar so, I had some doubt about what the NY times had said.  \n\nThe reason why this place gets 3 instead of 2 stars is the fact they have a lot of spicy dishes, which is a plus in my book.  Since I have been eating Chinese food all my life this place doesn't really do anything new for me.  It's good Chinese.  Now if I were not of Asian descent I could see how this place is spectacular to the unasian tongue but having eating food all over Asia and even china town...this isn't the best and does some injustice to a lot of Chinese restaurants in the bay area which are comparable and even better without all the fanfare.\n\nDishes ordered for two people...\n\nSalt cod fried rice - you can find this at every Chinese restaurant and nothing was really different.  I could have picked this up for $7.50 at 5A in Millbrae\n\nMa Po Tofu - Again, pretty regular dish you find at most Chinese restaurants and nothing really spectacular\n\nSizzling Lamb cumin - good dish because they actually added chili pickled long bean which gave it a nice sour taste to contrast the cumin.  Although the dish wasn't labeled as spicy they did have sliced jalapenos mixed in with the onions.  Best dish for the night\n\nFried chicken wings covered in chili peppers - I really liked this dish even though the flavors were the same as other Szechuan restaurants but they actually fried whole chicken wings.  Traditionally all other restaurants that make this dish cut up the wings in small pieces without a whole lot of meat.\n\nSzechuan pickles - good, but ordinary \"pao tsai\"\n\nTea smoked Eel - Something about this dish that just didn't work for me.  Either the Eel was too heavily smoked in Eel or the taste of hoisin sauce that just messed with me.  I think you do have to try this since this was probably the most creative dish we had. \n\nAll in all, good food and I will go back to try other dishes that I missed.

Even when your mouth is on fire from liberal use of szechuan peppercorn.\n\nIf you only get one thing, get the thrice cooked bacon without bacon. Trust me. The bacon detracts from the dish, but when you get it without bacon, they had more tofu skin, which gives you wonderful sweet, tofu skin-ny bites to contrast with the other flavors.

I don't know if it was the best, but it was darn close and we stumbled across some other delicious eats with a flare that took the classic, conventional chinese dishes for a ride.\n\nLung Shan carries your typical hole in the wall atmosphere. No frills and ruffles. Just your dowdy tables, plates and utensils. You don't expect much, but you get treasure.We ordered the salt cod fried rice, ma po tofu and westlake rice porridge.  Each dish had it's own exclusive quality that held a unique flavor and sometimes, desensitizing heat that you will never forget.\n\nAs indicated, the Ma Po Tofu is spicy enough to make one feel febrile, but once you take enough bites to become numb to the heat, you realize that it's a pretty good dish. With a side of rice, I managed to eat quite a bit!\n\nThe salt cod fried rice and Westlake porridge were also a hit! The porridge actually had real chunks of crab. My fave!

Different style of chinese food sorta fusion but not out of this world amazing and more of hype. They have a dine in only menu selection in addition the take out one. All dishes are relatively more expensive than your typical chinese place and expect to wait 40+ minutes to sit down. No parties greater than 8 and they have a strict no-add on policy/entire party must be present before seating. Club hip hop music is playing in the background in this very small and compact restaurant that uses non-matching utensils (probably on purpose)\n\nChar Sui Pork Belly (9.5 - dine in only)\n4 pieces of spiced and crispy pork belly that is high fat but tastes almost as good as the ones they serve at santa ramen. Served with pineapple and cucumbers. Its alright but theres only 4 pieces ... \n\nThrice Cooked Bacon ($11 available dine-in and take out) \nvery fatty bacon pieces with rice cakes mixed with a ton of onions, peppers, and jalapenos. This dish is pretty spicy and tasty although the spice really overwhelmes your taste buds. Overall I would recommend getting this dish if you can handle moderate spice since its pretty unique.\n\nTea-Smoked Eel ($9 available dine in and take out)\nKinda like rice noodle rolled sushi with eel. Came with 8 pieces and by far was the most healthy dish of the night. Pretty tasty and recommended to try.\n\nOther notable dishes on the dine-in menu that if we had more people in my party we would have considered ordering Taiwanese clams and the lamb ribs.\n\nOverall our party was a little disappointed with the fact we couldn't add another person to our party but restaurant policy i guess... anyways the food was different but nothing to go gaga over. If you dont mind waiting 40+ minutes and having an adventure finding parking, then come on down to mission chinese food. Ill probably wont be back.", "author": "Robert Y."}

They were unable to serve any sort of vegetable-based dish without tofu. \nAll that aside, when the food we ordered came, I tried to keep an open mind...but it still didn't do it for me. The food was not bad by any means, but it just wasn't great either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-05-21", "description": "After hearing about all the hype and discovering that a sister restaurant had opened in NYC after I had relocated from there to SF, my friend and I were pretty excited to check this place out. Arriving at a little after 7 PM on a Tuesday evening, we stood outside with the crowd on the street and waited for 45 minutes as assorted homeless indigents encouraged us to \"help them out\". When our table was ready, we found the interior of the restaurant to be somewhat dilapidated and decorated in a weird mish-mash of cheap Chinese restaurant decor (a few red \"scrolls\" and lanterns), Chinese gift shop (specifically, the extra-large blow-up dragon hanging from the ceiling) with a college dorm room (namely the white Christmas lights strewn around the restaurant). On top of that, they play hip hop not too inconspicuously: chowing down while listening to Bone Thugs and Ludacris, I was left unsure as to whether or not I should be getting up and busting a move.\n\nFood items:\nBeer-brined Sichuan pickle: pickled napa cabbage that was moderately salty and just a little sour from the beer, a decent starter that would've been better with rice.\n\nSmashed cucumbers in garlic sauce: essentially fresh smashed small cucumbers served with garlic hummus and fresh minced chilies. Delicious, but only vaguely Chinese.\n\nTiger salad: some assorted bitter greens encompassed by a single layer of wide rice noodle, with a mostly unidentifiable and totally forgettable vinagrette (?). I feel somewhat ashamed for having ordered this, but to our credit, some prior Yelp pictures had us mistaking this for the beer-brined Sichuan pickle.\n\nSavory egg custard: a new dish per our waitress, it is essentially a egg custard (almost like a chilled version of what you get at Korean BBQ) served in tomato water with a decent amount of uni, trout roe, and minced shiso leaves. Separately, all these components are actually delicious. Together, they formed a cold hodge-podge with no common element, a sum that is less than the individual parts.\n\nSliced peanut noodles: perfectly cooked wide rice noodles served with a slightly watered down peanut sauce. I like my peanut sauce actually heavy on the peanut, but the effective cooking of the he-fen left me envious.\n\nThrice cooked bacon: holy cow, is this dish smoky. Crispy and yet not completely dried out pieces of chewy bacon are stir-fried with slightly numbing chilies, thin slivers of bitter melon, all in chili oil. A potent combination that was hard to resist picking at even when full.\n\nSizzling cumin lamb: for those of you who cannot handle gamey meats, this dish brought the barnyard along with the lamb on the plate. The meat is certainly tender and well prepared, at least. I was looking for a heavier hand with the cumin; I may in fact stir-fry my leftovers with more cumin.\n\nSalt cod fried rice: our favorite dish of the night. A very delicately prepared (if that is possible for fried rice) dish with good balance of salt, sweet from the chinese sausage, and starch with just a tiny shred of lettuce to keep it tasting slightly fresh. It honestly reminded me of late nights of post-clubbing Chinese food back in Boston, a cleaner and less funky version of salted chicken and fermented fish fried rice served in venues like Chow Chau City.\n\nVerdict: apparently we came to this restaurant looking for Chinese food, and what we found was...50% something else. At over $40 a head for this level of meh (even though we have a boatload of leftovers), I'm actually very surprised that Danny Bowien won the James Beard for Rising Star Chef. The one caveat is that 1 of the more famous dishes, Biang Biang Mien a la Xian Fast Food of NYC fame, was sadly nowhere to be found on the menu. I'll try that for take-out or delivery next time (and maybe my last).", "author": "Gene C."}

Why do they have to go and ruin otherwise perfectly tasty dishes with so much excess salt?  The only reason I can come up with is that they got a boatload of salt at a discount and have to use them up before their expiration date is due.  We had the lamb noodle soup, the salt cod fried rice.  We also received a dish of fried chicken wings that we didn't order and they ended up letting us have it for free.  The lamb was so delicious and so tender.  The broth has so much flavor.  The fried rice has a very unusual, but pleasantly so, taste with the Chinese sausage added in.  The wings have the perfect crunch which I would have loved to have more of if only my lips didn't go numb from being coated with so much salt!\n\nThe other dishes we ordered that showed more restraint with salting were the mussels (perfectly cooked and well sized mollusks) and the egg custard (the least favorite of all the dishes we had in overall taste).\n\nWould we go back?

But actually everything except for the salt cod fried rice was way too overbearing with seasoning.  It just showed that the kitchen just didn't have any control.  I was thinking that maybe they were just stoned or high back there.\n\nWhat I ate:\nSlow Cooked Char Siu Pork Belly - score: 3 of 5.  The pork was tasty and chewy but it was no big deal.  The only thing I really liked with this dish was the salty egg.\n\nMa Po Tofu - score: 2 of 5.  Way too much cumin.  I couldn't taste anything else.\n\nHainam Chicken Rice: score 2 of 5.  No big deal.  I've had better in Chinatown.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice: score 4 of 5.  The savior of the night.  Tasty!  You could taste the salt cod in every piece of rice.\n\nChicken Wings with Explosive Chili Peppers: score 3 of 5.  I've never had that much szechuan peppers and I didn't know that it makes your entire mouth numb!  Chicken was crispy.\n\nI know that MCF is going for a more fusion, eclectic style of Chinese to draw in the more hipster crowd, of which are obviously mostly Caucasian.  Nothing wrong with that but overall there was no consistency in the menu.  Either it was bland like the Hainam Chicken Rice to the almost inedible Ma Po.\n\nSorry.", "author": "M V."}

Here, everything meaty, salty, fatty, and spicy is tossed together and dialed up to 11. \n\nMission Chinese was described to me as Momofuku-esque, and that's not wholly inaccurate. The kitchen definitely gives off the same \"we're cooking what we want to eat, and eff you if you don't like it\" vibe of the early Ssam Bar late-night menu (it also manages to be even more tightly packed and less conducive to lingering than Ssam Bar).\n\nFortunately, everything can be delivered, and knowing I don't have to brave the crowds of hipsters for my next hit of Thrice Cooked Bacon means I'll be eating here a fair amount in the future.", "author": "Amy L."}

My \"mouth watering\" chicken was so delicious I was popping chicken hearts like candy. Since I generally avoid all organ meats, that's really saying something. The pork belly was also good, but not a standout. I just wish they had been serving the thrice cooked bacon. Their vegan version of that is my favorite dish on the menu.

We nibbled on the rice while we waited for the lamb.  when it finally arrived, it was NOT sizzling as the name suggests.  the meat was low quality lamb.  80% fat and some meat covered with LOTS of onions which surprisingly tasted better than the actual meat.  The cumin taste was a bit over-powering.  when the APPETIZER chicken wings came (last) it was covered with PLENTY of smoked red chilli peppers.  it found it to be such a waste of good chilli.  i took it home and made myself a nice hot sauce.  But I cant imagine them throwing away that many chilli peppers.  $$ down the train.  But back to the wings.... it was dry and too salty.  it needed a dipping sauce of sorts.\n\nI really dont get it.

Although none of us have ever yelped before, we all agreed this was one restaurant worth breaking the cycle for. Plus...we got there five minutes before it opened at 6, so we had one of the first tables. I would recommend this as it seems like this little place gets a crazy wait. (Decidedly WORTH waiting for, though.)\n\nFABULOUS, delicious, gourmet with a hint of funky, and the only chinese place I would recommend for visitors. Plus, I love the atmosphere. They are playing a great variety of hip 'dance/ambient' music...Don't worry, they aren't blasting 90's techno, it's more like the band \"The Knife' has a musical lovechild with 'Purity Ring\". Very fun while you're eating. The lighting is also super low, your table lit in red glows by the awesome paper chinese dragon that fills up the upper tier of the room. In my opinion it's perfect for groups of 2-4 on a casual friend dinner. \n\nBut the food...lemme tell ya. I give thumbs way up to all of my dishes. \n1. Peanut noodles.....it's like they bred lasagna pasta and mochi together and dumped delicious peanut sauce on top. The texture was different and perfect. \n\n2. The orange beef tongue....another WINNER. If you like beef tongue, which is close to beef with just a slightly gamier flavor, covered in orange saucy goodness....go for it. This is a slightly more traditional style chinese dish, but with that special flare. \n\n3. And finally....the piece de resistance....LAMB CHEEK soup. Do it. Just......go order it right now. Thick, seemingly handmade, long noodles on top of a bed of cilantro and spices, pickled veggies and melt-in-your-mouth, fallin' off the bone like nana's famous ol' pot roast, finger-lickin' good lamb.

Why is there a number by each item if they don't want us to use it?\n\nWe ordered the # 21, which was sizzling cumin lamb with chili pickled long beans and #10, which was supposed to be 7 chicken wings with dried red chilies on them. \n\nWe only got 5 wings buried under the red peppers. They were salty and had a slight vinegar and spicy taste, but the dried peppers seemed to be there just for show because they didn't seem to flavor the wings much. We asked what kind of tea they had, and our waitress said \"just Chinese restaurant tea\". I asked is it black tea or oolong or what? She didn't know. She brought a half pot of weak tea.\n\nOur lamb was buried under a heap of sauteed onions. Again, we didn't see the point to so many onions except to hide the fact that the lamb was mostly bones with the meat fried down to a crisp. Some cumin flavor, but mostly a salty flavor. There are other places that serve better cumin lamb with better cuts of lamb and at a lower price. \n\nAlso, there were no pickled long beans with it. We told the waitress. She had to check the menu, went to the kitchen and came back with a bowl of the pickled beans saying \" they told be to just give this to you\" and then she walked away, never to return to our table.\n\nWe never had a chance to tell her that there were only 5 wings instead of 7. There was no rice on the menu and none was offered. We saw her bring rice to other tables, but not ours. Getting eye contact from any of the staff was impossible. They all had dead pan expressions as if they wished they were somewhere else. \n\nA bill was just dropped off at our table without anyone asking \"how was everything?\"\n\nThis place represents the worst of what a restaurant should be.

The food was decent-but-overpriced at best, inedible at worst. We had:\n-Pork belly appetizer - this was actually pretty good! Crispy on top, with a thin layer of fat and juicy meat. It was served with a dark savory sauce and some canned pineapples and mandarin oranges (which was a little wtf? I would've preferred pickles or cucumbers).\n-Thrice-cooked bacon - Looked delicious! Rice cakes and juicy, marinated bacon bits. Unfortunately, our dish was SO SALTY I had to ask the waiter to take it back. He claimed there was no salt in the dish, only salty components, so I made him try some at our table to see how salty it was. He was nice enough to offer us a new dish.\n-Beef, broccoli, oyster sauce - The beef was tender but sparse. I could only find about 10 cubes in the whole dish. The oyster sauce was again on the salty side, but not unbearably so. The broccoli was actually broccolini, which was pretty good. I like this creative interpretation and only wish it were better executed.\n\nI might be able to accept this quality of food if it was hole-in-the-wall cheap, but it wasn't.

I was totally shocked, but I knew I'd have to try it myself.\n\nNot surprisingly given the hype, lines are a frequent occurrence outside the no-reservation restaurant; there must've been at least 20 people waiting outside this past Saturday night at 9pm. However while everyone else was still nursing their Thanksgiving food coma, my mom, dad and I dropped in for lunch the day after Thanksgiving. What do you know - there was no line!\n\nWestlake Rice Porridge oxtail, dungeness crab, soft-poached egg, cilantro\n\nThis was a sort of a hybrid between a Westlake beef soup and a traditional congee (rice porridge). The lineup of ingredients was an all-star cast so I had to order it. Served piping hot, small pieces of crab and oxtail were scattered throughout the bowl filled with bits of soft rice, strands of egg and a clear soup. The dish was fine, somewhat disappointing. I expected the oxtail and crab to play a more prominent role, maybe with a little bit of oxtail stock incorporated into the soup. In actuality, the soup was very mild in flavor and the oxtail/crab really didn't bring a lot to the bowl. Don't get me wrong, the soup was tasty but it didn't live up to its all-star cast of characters.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice escolar confit, chinese sausage, egg, scallion\n\nI thought this was another fun dish using salt cod instead of Chinese dried fish. Its effect was similar, adding a fishy flavor to the rice to pair with the sausage and aromatics. However, we all thought this plate was a bit heavy-handed with the salt.\n\nSmoked Beef Brisket Soup Noodles cheung fun, mire poix, cardamom, turnip, broth\n\nWhereas the rice porridge was served hot amid wisps of steam, this soup was served warm. The brisket here was very tender and incredibly smoky, infusing the soup with that flavor. Rice roll noodles added some additional substance to the full-flavored dish.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami explosive chili, celery, potato, roasted peanut, steamed rice\n\nA familiar preparation of pastrami was stir fried kung pao style with something called \"explosive chili.\" I was fearful but actually found the heat to be present but not unbearable. The meat was tender and flavorful, and I thought there was a pretty decent balance of ingredients. My dad wanted more meat and less \"filler\" ingredients though.\n\nMy dad said this meal was definitely better than his previous experience, but the meal still did not live up to high hopes. I thought the food was \"just okay\" (definitely not awful), with flavors not really coming together as well as I had wanted. The menu is incredibly intriguing, integrating Chinese food with Western techniques and ingredients.

The broccoli beef was average, and didn't have that much meat on the plate. The General Tso's veal rib flavor fell short, and was super oily.

What I experienced was nothing outerworldly, but rather average. The slightly innovative twist on Chinese classics was evident by the menu. While the menu terms were standard classic, the ingredients were paramount. The use of great braising techniques were employed with finesse. \n\nMy major critique was that all of the dishes were overly salted and sauced. Now I like my sodium intake as much as the next gal, but I felt my hands swell to the size of lobster paws by the end of the meal. The sauces seemed to all have a slightly \"heavy\" texture and while I am a firm believer that fat equals flavor, the sauces lacked the unctuous flavor that is usually coaxed out by hours of cooking was lost on our dishes. \n\nOut of the eel roll, Hainam chicken with rice and the chinese broccoli with braised beef cheeks, the latter won out on taste. It was truly the standout dish of the evening and we'd be back just for that. A generous portion of perfectly braised beef and plentiful Chinese broccoli with a few fresh oysters thrown in for good measure. Great stuff. \n\nMexican coke and cheap Tsing Tao doesn't hurt either.", "author": "Stacy T."}

I only tried three dishes and would've loved to try more but dishes were a bit pricey. \n\nCons: Flavor. Ma Po Tofu (decent, good flavor, spicy, tasted like it was microwaved though), Spicy Chicken Wings ( SPICY SPICY SPICY! I felt like my lips were tingly and everything was so salty. Something about the spiciness made everything so salty), & Salt Cod Fried rice (This was the most decent dish of the ones we tried. Flavor was okay but bf thought it was microwaved and it felt cold)\n\nOverall, it's way overrated for the food. Spicy overkill. I don't understand why my 7 pieces of chicken wings needed to be covered in 50 pieces of red peppers. Such a waste! Everything was really salty too.

To one side were four college students from New York, who talked surprisingly loudly, both inside and outside the restaurant. (Yes, everyone waits here, even on a Tuesday.) To the other side was a couple with good food knowledge.\n\nService at Mission Chinese is collective and thus can be indifferent because no personal connection, or accountability, exists with any given table. This led us to not have as much alcohol, or fresh plates, as we'd desired. \n\nA return visit might be a good idea. My friend and I didn't order well because a) the egg custard with sea urchin and scallop was 86'ed and b) she also doesn't like fish, so we didn't order the salted cod fried rice. \n\nThe pickles were good. The wings very good, but their taste was difficult to determine. We ate them after the Mouth-Watering Chicken, which was fantastically spicy, and might be uncomfortably spicy for some diners. By that point in the meal, we were skittish of the long beans, probably unnecessarily so. \n\nDue to the mediocre service, we didn't try asking for new plates.

Take someone like Danny Bowien:  trained in NY and then few stints all over SF (winning Pesto World Championships while he's at it), but now makes Chinese food.\n\nYou're gonna get some cool shit going on.\n\nMission Chinese combines what you think about Chinese food and plays with it. Let's take Mongolian Beef, and put a tender beef cheek into it instead. How about cumin lamb? Let's make that with lamb belly instead.\n\nIt makes sense in my mind because he's taking your Chinese flavors and playing around with the cuts of meat or introducing a different technique. A good example of this is the Ma Po Tofu. When you get it, it's Ma Po Tofu in a truly authentic form, but he steps it up by using ground Kurobuta pork shoulder. This isn't your weird goopy messy at a run-of-the-mill Chinese joint. This Ma Po Tofu tastes like what you get in China.\n\nI went yesterday to try out his new dishes using a smoker for \"Chinese BBQ\". It's funny because he's pairing a Mexican coke/hoisin sauce bbq sauce with a Texas-style BBQ meal. The brisket tastes like a BBQ joint brisket with an Asian twang. You even get the slices of white bread like in Texan BBQ joints. It wasn't my favorite, but the Xian Lamb Cheeks and Pork Trotters were crazy good.\n\nThe Kung Pao Corned Beef was my favorite of the night, combining sliced potatoes, chinese celery, roasted peanuts, tossed in a spicy concoction with his house-made corned beef.

The food here is like no other Chinese food I've eaten! I'm not even sure it's really Chinese. It's definitely interesting and worth trying, since it's different and cheap. You'll wait up to 45 minutes at dinner time to get a table, but once you're in and have ordered, your dishes come out in 10 minutes! Plan to write your name on the list long before you're hungry, go to a bar for a drink or stroll the Mission alleyway murals, then come back after about 30 minutes. \n\nI've had:\n\n-Tea-smoked Eel: like Chinese sushi with flat rice noodle as the wrapping. Tasty but too much sauce, couldn't taste tea nor eel\n\n-Pork Jowl w/Winter Radishes: Kind of tart and the radishes are super-mini gumball sized. I enjoyed eating them but hardly recall any pork, let alone jowl.\n\n-Chicken Wings: they're actually drummettes, served swimming in a bed of chilies. Spicy and had a real strange slightly citrus, cooling, numbing effect on the tongue. We were wondering if they accidentally dropped something into the seasoning bucket because the sensation in our mouths was so unusual. Bothersome. \n\n-Salt Cod Fried Rice: it's fried rice, whatever. You could get fried rice in Chinatown for probably $2, not $10. This is one of there least flavorful dishes, meaning it's good to have on hand to balance out everything else. Still, I would save money by ordering plain rice.\n\n-Sizzling Cumin Lamb: very tender, too salty, too much fat, mostly bone.\n\n-Lamb Noodle Soup: a brown broth (think Thai), quite opposite the pale, cooling chicken broth-based soups served in most Cantonese establishments. Flavorful like everything else but nothing to take note of.\n\n-Chow Mein (please pronounce it \"meen\" w/ a quick, downward tone not \"main\", because that's incorrect in any dialect!): not bad, good to balance the more flavorful plates but again, I  could get this for a few dollars in Chinatown.\n\nService: they do not have time to check on you and probably won't refill your water. \n\nAmbiance: the only lights are white Christmas strands flanking the walls at table height; so dim you squint a little to take a good look at your food.

I'm great with spicy, but man--it was super spicy! Maybe, it was also because my roommates and I had champagne with it (bubbly and spicy DO NOT MIX, note to self). I wish the tofu were cut into smaller pieces so that it could soak up more of the sauce flavor. The meat (pork) in it was very good as well.\n\nThe Salt Cod Fried Rice was good as well, but not amazing. I probably wouldn't order it again, and try other things.

Next time I'm going to San Francisco, it'll be one of my first stops.\" Richman has not always enjoyed Bay Area food, but he is a man I trust when it comes to food recommendations. That being said, I checked out this talked-about restaurant the other day - let's just say that Mission Chinese (and Richman) did not disappoint. \n\nThe food is terrific and the flavors are bold (not to mention all meats and vegetables are local organic). Many of Mission's dishes are precisely as \"Chinese\" as its owner Danny Bowien (who never cooked Chinese food until he opened his restaurant). \n\nFood to taste: \n- Westlake Rice Porridge - is a perfectly-hearty, simple yet deep-flavored dish - braised oxtail, dungeness crab,  and hints of cilantro and ginger.\n- Thrice Cooked Bacon - a \"must\" for any bacon lover. Thick, mouth-watering strips of bacon, rice cake, scallions, chili oil.\n- Kung Pao Pastrami - If you enjoy spicy food, this has a kick (and then some). Slices of pastrami with explosive flavors of poblano and serrano chilis.\n\nAlso recommended:\n- Escolar and chinese salad\n- Chinese custard\n\nThings to note:\n- Cheap prices (accepts plastic)\n- Dress casual (think diner / dive style)\n- Get there before 6pm to avoid the line\n- No reservations\n- Don't be fooled by its awning - Mission Chinese Food is housed inside a pre-existing, old-style Chinese spot called Lung Shan.  \n\nAs Richman said, \"I think Bowien is a secret genius.\" I absolutely agree.

Had to ask for my soda three times before it came and another table of two that sat 5 minutes after us got their orders in before. \n\nMenu items no doubt have a flare on chinese food which was a good experience but not for the best.", "author": "Eric L."}

We called ahead and were instructed that we were on the list, but when we arrived the employee managing the list would not talk to us and we did not seem to be on the list. I understand that he was very busy, but he did not have the common decency to speak to my friend and I at all. I eventually decided to go into the restaurant to speak with someone and spoke to a nice employee that instructed me to go back outside and she would inform the man managing the list that we needed to speak with him. We waited for another 15 minutes and finally the man came outside again and I tried to speak with him. He absolutely ignored me. I'm sure the food may be good (full disclosure I haven't tried it), but I'm not sure any food is worth this type of rude behavior. I could tell this is a restaurant that does not value its customers as highly as it should, and has employees that do not have the common decency to even speak to people who are not being pushy and are only seeking answers as to whether or not they are waisting their time.

We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, fully expecting a long wait, but much to our surprise, we were seated right away. \n\nThe ambiance of the place leaves something to be desired - if you want to use the restroom, be prepared to walk through the kitchen and stand next to trash and recycling bins - but the food was solid, and reasonably priced. However, if you're looking for traditional Chinese food, this is NOT the place. If you're ready to try some combinations you've never had before, you're in for a treat.\n\nThe two dishes we had that stood out were the thrice-cooked bacon and kung pao pastrami. The bacon dish was light on the bacon, but the perfect flavors and abundance of rice cakes made up for it. The kung pao pastrami was ridiculously spicy but completely worth it.

When I'd floated the idea of Mission Street for dinner, she went looking online for their menu and via Yelp came across not only a rather ordinary looking Chinese food menu, but some equally bland \"what's the big deal and why do people love this place?\" reviews. I was perplexed since I'd been looking at a menu with some rather authentic-sounding and exotic dishes and the reviews to match. We soon puzzled out that they actually have two menus. I assume one is meant for the mouth-breathing Gwailo and the other for the locals. We ordered from the interesting menu and were rewarded. I have to admit that for every dish we got, there were two others that we were closely considering. We'll have to try an all new assortment next time.\n\nWe're told that the order will take an hour to arrive and are glad that we put the order in early to accommodate the girls when they get off the show floor. Half an hour later we hear a knock at the hotel door. Props and an extra star for sheer speed in San Francisco rush hour.\n\nI tasted only a spoon of the soup, it having been ordered by Katelyn, a semi-lapsed vegan who I figure might be trying to avoid the rest of the meat-heavy order. It's tasty miso broth, and she assured us all in strident tones that the mushroom dumplings were good as well.\n\nThe group agreed that the absolute favorite was the Hainam Chicken Rice. Something about the combination of bits of chicken meat, peanut, and heavy application of chicken fat made it irresistible. Even after I was full, I found myself going back for another fork of that rice.\n\nMy only disappointment was the pork belly. In general when I think of pork belly and slow cooking, I figure that the result will be a great deal of the fat rendered out over time and tender, succulent meat left behind. The cubes of pork belly in our order are 90% fat. I excised the meat from between the fat layers and there is a nice-sized snack. I will admit, however, that this is likely the result of my own expectations and that this presentation may well have been perfectly pleasing to the intended native palate. Both the soy-cured egg and the ginger scallion noodles that came with it were delicious, though.\n\nWe went beef heavy on the other two dishes. Had I realized that Janelle's Broccoli Beef contained the same beef cheeks that the other Mongolian dish did, I might have opted for one of the other dozen or so dishes that were in the running, just for the sake of variety. The meat was delicious and tender in both preparations. I loved the fresh horseradish flavor in the Mongolian version, and the inclusion of actual poached oysters in addition to a smoked oyster sauce and Chinese broccoli signaled that this was not the beef broccoli that I'm likely to get from my strip mall sweet and sour joint at home.\n\nI really enjoyed this food. Add in the possibility of delivery and I'm pretty sure that Mission Chinese will become a staple of our future visits.", "author": "Ryan C."}

I wouldn't recommend it if your stomach is really sensitive to spicy hot food.  The sizzling cumin lamb dish was good, although there were quite a few grisly bits and we had more onions than lamb and green beans combined, leaving a serious pile of onions behind.  \n\nThe atmosphere was just bizarre for us. It looks Chinese owned and run (except for the servers which I can only assume was to cater to the hipster patrons) with Nicki Minaj and reggae blasting through the speakers so loud you could barely hear each other talk, while you sit elbow to elbow with a bunch of other kids. It's definitely a scene.\n\nWhen I eat spicy food, however, I want room a little to breathe, and you don't get that here (go figure, it's the Mission).  I had a coughing fit because a pepper flake got stuck in my windpipe; and having two strangers elbow to elbow with me at the same table just isn't a good situation for anybody.

The short answer is no.\n\nThe crowds of people hanging around outside the unassuming Lung Shan Chinese had piqued my interest in this Mission Street eatery, but the crowd hovering around outside had always dissuaded me from trying it out. After a few attempts to make it when the list wasn't 10+ people deep, I finally came at 6pm on a Monday night and there was no wait. We were greeted by a waitress that must have been just about to get off, as she wasn't helpful answering questions about the food and after we ordered we never saw her again. But then again no one comes to Mission Chinese for the service or ambience, the vibe is all about the food here.\n\nWe ordered the Beijing Vinegar Peanuts, Salt Cod Fried Rice, and the Catfish ala Sichuan Soup. The Beijing Vinegar Peanuts came in a small bowl and were a decent side but not really sufficient as an appetizer. The anise and vinegar seasoning on the roasted peanuts made my taste buds smile. The Salt Cod Fried Rice was tasty enough but it was really difficult to identify any cod bits actually in it. Sichuan usually implies spicy and the soup was pretty plain and had a strange bitter/sour taste, especially the marinated pinto beans floating around in it. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but I'm really not sure why GQ's Alan Richman named Mission Chinese Food on his annual list of the 10 Best New Restaurants in America.\n\nIf the place is packed when you stop in I recommend Dante's Weird Fish, seafood deliciousness, or Reaction, cheaper Mexican fare with great inexpensive drinks, across the street as alternatives.", "author": "Carrie G."}

I love how they chopped the chinese sausage in super small slices, because the sausage is pretty salty otherwise. \n- Cumin lamb ribs: This is a must order dish!!! It's a pretty unique / fusion type dish. The cumin lamb comes out on a sizzling plate w/ tons of onions. The lamb is incredibly tender and falls off the bone. They also throw on some pickled onions on top of the lamb to cut some of the richness of the lamb. Disclaimer: the lamb was incredibly fatty which is an awesome plus but can put some people off as well.\n- Kung pao pastrami: Another amazing dish. The pastrami comes out in lil chunks that burst of flavor. It is accompanied by red bell peppers, celery, and topped off with sesame seeds. Again, you can't eat a ton of this at a time because it's pretty rich / greasy but if you love spicy food then you'll love this dish.\n\nOh yes, and I want to mention that you will be paying about a $2 hipster premium on every dish.

The braised beef cheek had that exact same smoky flavor, and although the meat was perfectly tender, that flavor just completely threw me off. In general, the individual components of everything were very good, but somehow combined to become one great big disappointing flop.

Brisket is flavorful, noodles are large, rolled noodles. But the salt killed it for me.\n- Mongolian Long Beans: Okay. Again too spicy for me.

The atmosphere is unique - with the hipster crowd and waitstaff compared to the actually very authentic Chinese family in the back, the kitschy decorations, and the music. And I do think it works well together.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I showed up here on Sunday around 645pm, we probably were seated around 7pm. The place was busy, and the line was getting long behind us. We ordered:\n\nTea Smoked Eel\nBroccoli Beef Cheek\nPork Belly\nGinger beer and Mexican Coke to drink\n\nWe both loved the Tea Smoked Eel. It had such a surprising crunch to it - and it was really well balanced. The pork belly was sort of disappointing to me. Maybe because my mom makes amazing braised pork belly, and this wasn't even close. While some pieces were fatty and well-prepared, others were dried out and chewy. The sauce is similar to the hoisin sauce they serve with peking duck. If not for the mildly pickled cucumbers, the dish would have been too salty. And lastly, the broccoli beef cheek was overwhelming broccoli, with three pieces of beef cheek. They were admittedly very tender, but again, a bit too salty for my taste.\n\nThe service was also pretty slow. We had to remind our waiter about our drinks - he literally didn't remember that we had ordered them because he reached for a menu when I brought up drinks, and I had to correct him and say that we had already ordered them. Our food also came at odd intervals, the pork belly followed the tea smoked eel pretty quickly, and then we probably had to wait another 15 minutes for the broccoli beef cheeks. I think they actually did forget about us.\n\nAll in all, this is an experience to be had. Maybe a just one time so that I can say I've eaten here.

The thrice cooked bacon, well, it's bacon cooked three times. Duh. And the pork belly delivered on all accounts - don't sleep on the egg, it's an integral part of the dish and delicious on its own.\n\nWe were able to get a table for two 7:45pm on a Saturday night without a wait but within minutes there were people milling about, waiting for a table. \n\nThe prices at MCF are ridiculously cheap considering the quality of ingredients and care that go into each dish. Speaking of cheap, you can bring your own wine for a $5 corkage fee.\n\nMission Chinese Food is firmly entrenched in my rotation of restaurants that I will gladly return to without hesitation. Go ahead, try some of the dishes that I listed. You can thank me later.", "author": "phil h."}

My sister and I came here last night for dinner, and we had to wait about half an hour to get seated.\n\nThe food here is definitely EXCELLENT and for a very good price. My sister and I ordered the following:\n-Slow Cooked Char Siu Pork Belly - $9\nTHIS DISH IS AWESOME. The crispy pork belly was so delicious. I would come here again and again for this dish.\n\n-Westlake Rice Porridge - $10\nAnother awesome dish! The only thing is that I wish that the chunks of oxtail were bigger; they were cut up so small that I couldn't tell what it was. There was also a generous portion of crab in this porridge, which was excellent.\n\n-Dumplings with yellowtail - don't remember the price, but I think it was around $7\nUnfortunately, this was my least favorite dish. It was awesome watching the chef make dumplings while waiting outside, but unfortunately, these dumplings were a little bland. The dumpling skin was also too thick, in my opinion.\n\nIn short, the delicious food and the reasonable prices make me want to come back again and again, despite the long lines.", "author": "Wendy S."}

With an endorsement like that, we were ready to be blown away with what must certainly be the areas most delicious, ingenious and satisfying Chinese food. \n\nNot so much.\n\nThe ma po tofu was... okay. Best dish in San Francisco? Hardly. Actually, let's be real. \"Not even close!\" To be fair, it was good but just that -- good. If I'm being uber critical, it was too hot to actually taste any spice and a bit to greasy for my particular taste. But as far as authenticity, I suppose this was the real deal. Subtract a little red-hot pepper, and maybe it'd rank as one of the best ma po tofus in town. But again, City's Best Dish? \n\nNo. \n\nWe also ordered the slow cooked pork belly which was actually quite delicious. It sounds really, really gross, but there was something about the way the skin molded to my teeth as I chewed, the way the fat (yes, the yummy pork fat!) melted in my mouth and the pork itself was delicious too. This was a great dish -- far better than the tofu. \n\nExcept one... small... exception. There in the middle off the pork was a cold, soft boiled, curried egg. It looked interesting, but tasted so gross that I actually had to compose myself from yacking at the table. And I, as may people would tell you, am not afraid to try *any* food. This, my friends, ruined the experience. \n\nNo matter how good the pork was and even if the tofu had been the star it was billed as, after taking a bite of this egg I was ruined for the day. No amount of differently-spiced food could erase the yucky texture and taste from my memory. \n\nFood aside, the restaurant was... a sight to take in. In the dining room it had the typical charm of a hole-in-the-wall Mission Chinese restaurant. I suggest doing yourself a favor though, and going no further. To use their bathroom (outside in the back) takes you through the kitchen and adjoining... rooms? At best, the kitchen is tolerable to those with a strong stomach, at worst probably enough to ignite a firestorm of health code violations and raised eyebrows from patrons. \n\nTaste in food is subjective, so take what I say with a grain of salt and feel free to try it yourself. But I'm not likely go to back \n\nAs for 7X7 magazine's endorsement of this place? Apparently taste isn't just subjective, it's headless, blind, without scent and lacking in taste buds.", "author": "Jeff Z."}

It's like a less greasy version of the fried rice you'd get in your average Chinese joint. The Chinese sausage was a nice touch, though. And it still tasted good when I reheated the leftovers for dinner!\n\nSlow Cooked Pork Belly: Highlight of the meal! Crispy on the outside, tender & juicy on the inside.

I like things that are too salty except that they shouldn't be mixing their super salty meats with the veggies. \n\nWe had the Broccoli Beef Cheek which has oysters, gai lan and beef cheek.

Really yummy. Tastes and looks just like the porridge my grandma use to make except my grandma would never put oxtail and THE HEAPS OF CRAB in the porridge. She also use to give us an option of adding ginger or not. If I could, I would love to have grandma's porridge again. The massive amounts of crab makes the porridge here soooo worth it.\n\nThey have beers from 21st amendment including their watermelon beer and their IPA. Both are really good.

I ilked this dish a lot.\n\nThe ubiquitous Sichuan dish, thousand pepper chicken, was fine, but the portion of chicken wings was lacking. Nicely seasoned and plenty spicy though. I liked that it isn't as oily as I've had. Spices in the Richmond does this dish well.\n\nThe egg custard was complex and savory with nicely cooked scallops, and tasty broth. Well executed.\n\nThe mapo tofu was probably some of the best I've had, really spicy and beefy. Excellent over rice.\n\nThe sizzling cumin lamb seemed more of onions than anything, but good fresh cumin seed flavor and I think they used lamb chops so that would explain the small portion. Z&Y has a spicier one on their secret menu that tops this though.\n\nThe pork belly with rice noodle rolls was pretty nice, although really fatty (obviously), but the combination was genius. The tea smoked egg didn't seem to add to the dish, but it was soft boiled, very nicely done.\n\nI'd come back for certain dishes, but I wished they'd offer more than just Tsing Tao, Heineken and Bud Light.

Yes it's Asian, the taste, the ingredients...it's very Asian...but with a different flair.\n\nThis place is cool. Upon entering a shabby restaurant front, besides the typical Chinese restaurant decor, you immediately see a huge red illuminated red dragon strung throughout the ceiling, Christmas icicle lights on the walls left and right of you, a little corner on the right upon entering where the bbq orders are being precessed, and the tune of 90s hip-hop playing. Tight...dinner tonight is gonna be good!..how fun!\n\nThe food here is good. I was thinking kinda like creative (additional) Asian twist to an already Asian menu. Asian....comfort food...hip. The menu is short, filled with what seems like your typical Chinese restaurant items\"...but wait, the ingredients...now that's a little different!\" And it all works out too! The ingredients...they get creative with the items, adding some extra Asian flair (not American flair) to the menu items.\n\nMy friend and I ordered four items between the two of us: Ma-Po Tofu, Salt Cod Fried Rice, Hainam Chicken Rice, and BBQ Beef Brisket. All items were good stuff! The BBQ brisket was super tender and super fatty..has a sauce made from \"Mexican Coke\" (I think it had a little hoisen going on in there too?)...served with onion/cucumber(pickled?) on the side, and three slices of white bread with the crust cut off (kinda like peking duck with the little bun that it comes with). The two rice dishes were plenty yummy/tasty (approved by my friend who is a fried rice fanatic!). The Ma Po Tofu was not your typical either, as it reminds me of something that taste like something from the restaurant Old Mandarin Islamic (it's good stuff!).\n\nThe only thing negative I can say about this place is the price of the items are a little more expensive then expected. Not that it's super expensive, but more then usual. You can justify the prices though with the creativity of added ingredients to each menu item. I think it's worth it though, knowing that you will not find that type of taste at another Chinese restaurant. (The other negative thing, and not that it's the restaurant's fault, was the drunk homeless person that strayed in. He was going to each table mumbling....16oz. plastic $3 vodka bottle sticking out of his back pocket. It's the type of area though.

The area is not great, Mission between 18th and 19th, so safety is on your own any way. \n*Price is moderate not cheap but towards more to expensive such as $12 for Salted Fish Fries Rice-not entree, $16 for Lamb Rib Grilled, all entrees are over $10 even some vegetarians are made from TOFU.\n*Products (food) are very delicious; thats why this restaurant can still survive.\n*Promotion: None\n\nI hope this review help you to decide if you want to go to this restaurant.", "author": "Johnny O."}

Everything is pretty delicious, although some unadventurous diners may have trouble with spiciness, textures, etc.  \n\nDining there is an experience, as the wait can be lengthy, but it is totally worth it.  Don't expect to have intimate conversation, as east-coast hip-hop is a staple of the dining room.  They have a small but diverse selection of bottled and canned beer, which definitely helps in handling the Szechuan spices.\n\nMission Chinese also delivers all over the city for a nominal fee, although there are several items that are only available for dine-in. It usually takes over an hour, but is always hot and delicious when it arrives.  Overall, my recommendations would be:\n\nkung pao pastrami\nma po tofu\nsizzling cumin lamb\nthrice-cooked bacon\npineapple pork belly (or pig tail) - dine-in only\n\nthe chili wings are overrated IMO (too salty, not that hot), as is the salt cod fried rice.

Great, but not amazing, as there is a distinction.\n\nGreat in the sense that the flavors were on point, it wasn't super greasy like all other Chinese Food tends to be, and it arrived piping hot. The veggies were cooked really well, cooked without being mushy or al dente, and spicy but not overwhelming. Quick note though: they use some of that pepper from Schezwan that makes your tounge numb/ tingly, so if that's not your thing this place is probably not for you.\n\nThe downside? There isn't a whole lot in the terms of beef to veggies ratio, so if meat is your thing, one order may not satisfy you so to speak.\n\nPros: Good quality chinese food that delivers. Delivery charge isn't a whole lot\n\nCons: Maybe more expensive than you normally pay for delivery chinese, but the quality more than makes up for it.", "author": "David H."}

But after reading about it on 7x7 and all these other food blogs, decided to give it a try. And ZOMG it was amaaazing. It's like cheap gourmet Chinese food at it's finest. Here's what we got:\n\n- MaPo Tofu - as good as everyone says! I loved the flavor of this dish... it was spicy, but not in a dump-in-a-shit-ton-of-chiles kind of way. It had lots of other spices in it like cloves, cardamom (I think?), and other things that made it very fragrant and delicious. I can't really compare it to 'real' mapo tofu because I've never had it before, but this dish was delicious.\n\n- Hainam Chicken Rice - light and refreshing. I was hoping it'd be a bit tastier, but this one was just okay. Next time I'll probably get the cod salted fried rice instead.\n\n- Cha Siu Pork Belly - the presentation for this dish was pretty amazing. Pork belly was delicious! Though it comes with 5 pieces.. so if you're by yourself or with one other person, you might have a hard time finishing this one because it is super fatty. \n\n- Cold Noodles - was expecting a bit more out of this one, because I'm a huge fan of the leng mian served on the streets of Shanghai. Texture was a bit weird for me (buckwheat soba noodles?) and I would have liked a more vinegary flavor. But it was still decent nonetheless. Probably wouldn't get it again though.\n\nSo overall, 4 stars. Ambiance is nice too. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on their menu!", "author": "Rhea K."}

Unfortunately, Mission Chinese fell a little short in the taste department. Nothing was bad, per se, but the majority of my food was just bland.\n\nI had a really hard time deciding what to get since so many items on the menu appealed to me. My friend and I ended up sharing:\n\n*SIZZLING CUMIN LAMB: The flavours were great but the lamb belly pieces were a lot fattier than I'd expected. There was barely any meat on them (some people may be into that but I'm not one of them). My favourite part of this dish was all the slivered onions that soaked up all the yummy flavours.\n\n*TAIWANESE EGGPLANT: This would've been a great dish if it was more flavourful (it was almost,  but not quite, there) and the eggplant was more well-done (but that's a personal taste). Loved the sprinkling of fresh basil on top though.\n\n*WEST LAKE RICE PORRIDGE: I'd expected the use of oxtail, addition of Dungeness crab to, and the congee aspect would make this a good variation on the Chinese classic. But instead I got a big bowl of bland and watery rice porridge with not enough beef, crab, or cilantro. It was salty enough, but something was missing.\n\n*STEAMED EGG CUSTARD: A very light and simple dish with the addition of shaved scallops on top. The flavours didn't blow my mind but it was satisfying in a I-would-like-this-if-I'm-sick way. Portion-wise this was also a lot smaller than the other dishes and I barely noticed the confit chicken that was supposedly in there.\n\nI'll still come back to try all the other dishes that caught me eye if only to satisfy my epicuriosity.

All the dishes tasted great, and one of Mission Chinese Foods greatest asset IMO is it makes the dishes standout from regular Chinese fare (kung pao pastrami?!?!?! tell me more!) without coming across as \"fusion food.\"  In other words the food at this place really feels like the idea came from a person who cooks authentic Chinese food but is well versed in other cooking styles/techniques, rather than a person who just wants his food to appeal to the masses.\n\nGive this place a try, hopefully you won't have to wait too long in line for a seat.", "author": "Brian A."}

I don't think you have the right to say what is good Chinese food, unless you have had good Chinese food. Regardless, yelper has taken me to some hipster Panda Express and made me eat something I don't even believe is Chinese. Just because a Chinese chef created it, doesn't mean it is Chinese food!!\n\nI go there before my flight back to LA because all you yelpers say it so awesome, get there and the line is long and that was to be expected, the parking is horrible in that area, but that was all stated and you can't hold MCF responsible for that. We put our name on the list and it moves quickly and I am willing to wait for good food. \n\nI don't know if people were drunk or high when writing the reviews on MCF, but the place is dark as a night club, the tables are fold out tables with no table clothes, and every plate seems to be different. The water they served was probably straight from a garden hose with no ice and brought to your table with busted up carafes. I guess this is a good reason to order tea or alcohol. The interior was dark, I would keep it that way because the place is dingy and I am sure you wouldn't eat there if they turned on the lights, it's like make-up for your restaurant. This fact alone should scare people and no one in their right mind should be giving them 5 stars. After all the reviews of this place, I am seriously tempted to open a place there and furnish everything from Home Depot \n\nBecause some idiots said that the cumin lamb FAT, the super SALTY long beans were good, and the wish there was cod-fried rice, we had to give it a try.\n\nThe food:\nOverall everything was salty, very salty, and probably loaded with MSG as well.\n \nThe Lamb fat was just that, the onions and veggies were decent, but there were so few pieces of lamb and the few pieces that were there was all fat. People on here say that the lamb is tender, but most fat is tender, I have no idea how people think they are actually eating lamb, it's called lamb FAT!\n\nThe long beans were decent, they weren't overcooked, but they were just so salty. I am surprised more people haven't complained, I wanted some salt with my beans not beans with my salt. I enjoy spicy food, but I was a bit surprised, because it was much spicier than typical Chinese food, but regardless, it was decent, but not good. I rarely see Serrano peppers in Chinese food, but they were all over it btw.\n\nThe cod fried rice, that was the only decent thing on there. Honestly, nothing that special, I am sure a panda express cook could easily cook this dish, probably make it taste better a half the price. I am not endorsing panda express, but if you don't want real Chinese food, might as well get it there, because at least you don't have to wait long, it's half price, the tables are clean and the place has a clean atmosphere and just bring your own mp3 player to blast music so loud you think it's a club. \n\nOverall it's worth trying, but not worth the money or the wait. The whole vibe of the restaurant is pretty low class and nasty, but if that is the appeal, it doesn't attract me. I like when a place is eclectic and clean, but not dark/dingy. It was worth trying, to know that people can make bad Chinese food and be successful because yelp says it's good. So people if you want authentic Chinese food, this is not the place. If you want to try funky dishes created by Chinese people, then try it, but make sure you are ready because it ain't pretty inside. If the place feels dirty in the dining area, I can only imagine the kitchen.\n\nGood luck.", "author": "Eddie K."}

Naturally anyone should be curious how something as ubiquitous as Chinese food in a city that has a Chinese eatery on almost every block can win over the hearts of those picky Mission hipster eaters. \n\nFirst off, the appearance had to be a hole-in-the-wall mom n' pop kinda place. The dirtier the better: because obviously the more energy you put into making delicious food, the less you should have to worry about interior design. However, ironic objects are a charming must: fake flowers, posters that look like they were directly imported from Red China at least 20 years ago. Also, you want a good mixture of authenticity and hipness: a family photo of the staff including unaculturated grandmas is endearing but it also doesn't hurt to throw in a younger dude named \"T-Bone. \" \n\nOnto the food. Based on yelp reviews, we ordered the salted cod fried rice which was a huge bust. I don't get it at all! I don't see how this is different from any other Chinese fried rice I've had in my life. Maybe the two pieces of cod made the difference, but I am pretty sure if you blindfolded me and give me a $3 fried rice from any generic Chinese restaurant, I won't be able to tell the difference. \n\nThe sesame noodles were different from your traditional Chinese sesame noodles. Lighter in taste and texture, it's almost like a lightly creamy noodle salad. The smoked eel dish was pretty fantastic. The presentation and taste resemble unagi rolls, but instead of rice, eel is wrapped in silky rice noodles and the whole texture/taste balance was perfect. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try some other dishes---many sound very enticing and interesting. Do come here early: we had no issue getting a table around 11:30, but by the time we were leaving an hour later, the restaurant was full and bursted into chaos where we had to ask for our bill twice and each time it was forgotten as soon as the waitstaff turned around and got involved in some other tables' business.", "author": "Candice B."}

I've been to Mission Chinese a few times before my last visit and it was always an awesome, mystical experience. The food was so imaginative and unexpected. Whenever I was in the Mission and had the chance, I would go there. During our visit yesterday, however (at least a year since the last time I was here) 2 out of the 3 dishes we ordered were so spicy we couldn't even eat them. I brought my boyfriend and we ordered the Ma Po Tofu, the thrice cooked bacon, and the egg egg noodles. We had to send the Ma Po tofu back because it was painfully hot. I think by the time we made our way to the bacon dish, our tastebuds were so numb from the heat and we had so much endorphins coursing through our veins that it didn't seem as hot, but as I am writing this review, I just heated up the leftovers and I couldn't eat more than 2 small bites without running to the kitchen to grab some milk. I want you to know that we are no wusses. Habaneros and jalepenos are regular ingredients in our homemade food and cocktails. But the food was so over-spiced that we couldn't enjoy the subtle and complex flavors that I have experienced on previous visits.\n\nOn some positive notes: this restaurant carries my favorite beer in the world - 21st Amendment Watermelon Beer (omg so good), and when we explained to our server that the tofu was too hot to eat, she was very nice and took it back and comped our beers (so we basically didn't pay for the dish and got an additional 4 bucks off the check). She also mentioned that the chef has changed the menu in the past few months and made the spicy items even spicier. I think this is a huge mistake. I can't imagine why anyone would want to change anything about the menu when Mission Chinese has been so hugely successful the way it was. But oh well. If you are looking for a psychedelic, out of body experience, the dishes with the peppers next to them on the menu should take you there. \n\nBut if you can't handle the heat...stay out of Mission Chinese's kitchen.", "author": "Jessica G."}

Glad we did and nice to see the Chinese culinary universe in action. Started with cold apps-- something that gets overlooked a lot in the West but is ubiquitous all over China. Garlic cucumbers drenched in a nice sesame sauce. Then had the smoked eel. It was rolled up in rice rolls and tasted great, highly recommended for the experience. The mapou tofu was the best I've ever had in the United States. It's ashamed how misrepresented this dish is in the States, but if you've never been to China, try it here and you can get as close as it gets to authentic-- complete with the awesome tingling mala numbing pepper. We also tried their fish fried rice. This dish actually was brought first, a big no-no in Chinese eating culture--rice comes later, as a filler. The cumin-flavored row of bones (ribs) had some Western Chinese influence and flavor, and the Hunan chicken wings are not to be missed merely because of the phenomenal presentation. This place is rad and totally disproves the fact that paler folks can't find good Asian restaurants. Hallelujah!", "author": "Brian J."}

Sigh, the consequences of high expectations.\n\nHere's what we ordered, and what I thought:\n-Tea smoked eel rolls: Probably my favorite thing we had. Nice salty ham hock with tender eel and some bitter greens.\n-Cumin lamb: Super tender but super fatty lamb with a flavorful char along with too many raw tasting onions on a sizzling platter. If you love fatty meat, then consider the lamb. \n-Thrice cooked pork belly: Again, with the raw-ish onions. Oily and non-memorable sauce flavor. Basically uncrisp bacon. I'd skip this one.\n\nI think we may have just ordered poorly with too many stirfry style dishes; next time I'd get a soup and neither the lamb or pork belly were good enough to order again (the leftovers sat in the fridge 2 days before we ate them; that's pretty telling because something yummy would have been gone the next day).\n\nNote the largest group allowed is 8 people and expect a wait.

SOOO... we drug 6 of our colleagues out into the Mission to dinner around 6:30 on a Tuesday night.  Thankfully we were high on the list and the nice host agreed to seat us pretty quickly even though two of our folks were walkign form the BART station at Mission/19th.  We sat at one of the large tables in the center and our ever so charming host got us drinks quickly and then walked us through a list of \"must tries\" for us to enjoy family style.  The interior was as expected, funky and dark with club music playing in the background which got mixed reviews from our crowd (I loved it and others described it as maddening - lol).  The good thing was that as it grew darker outside, the interior was brighter.  We ordered the following and shared and had the associated impressions:\n\nVinegar Peanuts - Yummy and vinegarry while still crunchy (hone your chop stick skills young Jedi!).\nTea Smoked Eel - AMAZING - I am a huge eel fan and the dumpling wrap was awesome and the seasongin of the eel was not overpowering.\nPork Belly - YUM YUM YUM.  Not too fatty with a good \"rind\" on it.  It was a melt in your mouth not too salty experience\nMa Po Tofu - Really good an da favorit of more than one.  The tofu was a little slimy fo rme (but that's tofu) but the spice was magical!  Not too much just enough to make it interesting.\nKung Pao Pastrami - Patrami was so tasty - the amount was fine it was not greasy.\nBroccoli Beef Brisket - Amazingly tender brisket with tons of CHinese broccoli in a good sauce.  REally nice annise notes.\nSalt Cod Fried Rice - Yummy though nothing really crazy good.  I couldn't really discern the taste of the salt cod.\nSquid Ink Noodles - SO GOOD!!!  The noodles are HUGE and were very well cooked and were quite tasty.  Not sure if there really was any add from the ink but it was really tasty and enjoyed by all.  \nLong Beans - AWESOME but VERY SPICY!!!  I got a jalapeno by accident and WOO HOOO.  \nThrice Cooked Bacon with Rice Cakes - The bacon in this was SOOO nice and the small rice cakes were awesome (think quarter or 50 cent sized discs).\n\nAnd the best part we had 8 folks for dinner who drank beer and the tab was a little over $200!!!!!  This was an amazing feat and everyone enjoyed it massively and we were all absolutely stuffed.\n\nIn conclusion - take this for what it is... a very positive review from someone that can be picky but that can also embrace a TWIST on a particular type of food (be it nouveau southern, fusion, whatever).  One thing we wondered is how the chef came up with all this stuff and how long it took in the test kitchen to refine all the flavors.\n\nBe a little adventurous (the peeps in the Mission don't bite - much), loosen up and eat up y'all!", "author": "Shane J."}

After coming in today and witnessing the experience, I have this memory of these fusion style ingredients embedded in my tongue that'll stay with me for years to come. It's something special when a person who isn't even Chinese can create these dishes out of ingredients that nobody can ever expect and turn them into \"Traditional Chinese\" style cooking. I came around 5pm and there was already a small line outside. I was stopped by a clipboard outside of the shop presenting the crossed out names from each customer that already stepped foot inside. I must've been #20 something but was escorted inside within minutes. As I entered through, I noticed the dim lighting that darkened the room, the red Chinese New Year dragon hanging across the restaurant ceiling, the yellow walls, a crowded room with people talking and eating up, and the smell of Chinese food streaming across the room. It was a sight to see. The restaurant isn't that big anyway..tight pathways for people to walk through. I ordered the mouth watering chicken which contained smoked chicken, chicken hearts, and sichuan peppers. I had their famous Kung Pao Pastrami which was salty but was very unique. They used up whole slices of pastrami and created this traditional dish using celery and roasted peanuts. The cumin lamb was off the charts. The meat was tender and full of that cumin flavor which also arrived sizzling to our table. My favorite was the Cod fried rice because it had a different type of taste to it. The mackerel confit mixed well with the rice and eggs. My experience here was great! I'd like to come back again and try more! Thanks Danny.", "author": "Allister D."}

We were feeling adventurous, but all four dishes were a let down. The noodles in the sea weed salad were undercooked and whole thing was flavorless. The eel dish with cornflakes had a smokey sweetness which only hit one note and seemed tired at the second bite. The egg custard held promise, but under the fishy pudding were two chunks of mystery white meat, sad, flavorless and dry. The pork belly was dry despite the huge chunks of fat -it could have been delicious if rendered down. The soy sauce egg was uneatable.\n\nI wanted to like this place. It was my second time there. But if things weren't going bad enough with the food, we were hit with a nauseating and lingering body odor bomb from our sweet young chef. \n\nHipsters seem to love this place.

It came with 8 pcs of chicken. Very crisp taste, that really got your mouth watering for more so be prepared with some water. \n\nStir-fried Pork Jowl and Winter Radishes - Nice taste and the radishes went well with the pork. The jowl (cheek/jawbone) of a pig is probably the best part when it comes to eating anything off the head of a pig. The texture was awesome, very tender and juicy. \n\n7 Spiced Beef Tendon - Another one I enjoyed. The spices were even and you can distinguish most of the spices as you take bites into some really tender beef. Again a lot of peppers were in the dish, with more onion too.\n\nThrice Cooked Bacon - I love bacon, but this isn't your average bacon. It's a bigger cut but with the cooking process the flavor of the natural pork comes out even more. The flavor isn't genuine though just average with the oil and black bean. The bitter melons didn't really do justice maybe for something else to bite with the meat? \n\nHainam Chicken Rice - I liked this rice, but with the ingredients it was just a little above par from your average chinese stir fried rice.\n\nI might have to go here one more time.

It's dotted with restaurants that are clearly meant for those who are foodies like Foreign Cinema and now Mission Chinese Food. Part of the gentrification of a neighborhood that is mixed with Asian families, Latin American families and every so often, William Rast wearing pork pie hat sporting hipsters. Mission Chinese Food is situated in Lung Shan Restaurant in the middle of the block. So you see a kind of run down storefront in a line of storefronts that are run down. \n    Because the foodie set have discovered it and they don't take reservations for this tiny place, you have to get there early. They have a list that you write your name on so you can get a table when one opens up. My husband and I arrived a half hour before they opened and stood at the gates waiting. More people started arriving around 1120am and about 1130, a young man walked up and before he wandered into the restaurant, politely apologized for how late they were opening.\n   We were let in around 1140am and told to sit down anywhere we wanted. We sat down and then once most of the people were seated, were given menus then our place settings then glasses of water. The waitress was aloof, as if she just wanted this day over with already. The young man was trying to make sure everything was running smoothly, serving, taking orders. \n   The decor is in keeping with an old restaurant with kitschy choices. The dragon hanging from the ceiling, the red lanterns and the faded walls. There are no apologies that the place looks like a time capsule from the '60s. The modern music was an odd juxtaposition but amusing. \n   Our order was simple: the chicken schmaltz rice, thrice cooked bacon rice cakes and the pork belly. Our waitress took the order efficiently and went to the next table. We saw orders come out within about 15 minutes being delivered to other tables. Within about 20 minutes we got our rice cakes and pork belly. Between ordering and getting, we also got a carafe of cold water which was much appreciated. It took another 15 to get our rice.\n   The rice was very nice, subtle in flavor with ginger notes. It was quite good but not the best of the three dishes we chose. The rice cakes - which I'm a sucker for when my Mom hits the Korean market delis - were cooked with chiles, bitter melon, onions, tofu and of course, the bacon. It was really lovely. The sweet rice cakes with the salty porky bacon... I drool thinking about it. But the pork belly. Oh the pork belly! Soy turned into a caramel that attacks your teeth and won't let go - in a good way. The pork belly is meaty with bursting fat that embraces the soy caramel. It's decadent.\n   As for our waitress. I saw a couple reviews referring to the indifferent service. Yes our waitress was as I said, aloof. But I noticed after about the third time I said politely, thank you and please, she was wiling to crack a smile and warm up a tad. \n   The meal over all was really good. It made us very happy. The fact that before we walked in we had someone who was politely apologetic that the place was running behind schedule was quite nice.", "author": "Kim S."}

(Actually, haha, it actually made being there for almost 3 hours very amusing, to the disappointment of my boyfriend... ) \nBut the service was the worst service all four of us have ever seen. \n\nAnd I don't even want to burn the sweet waiter and waitress! they just looked so tired, I wanted to give them a hug and a break. So I'm going to burn the owners!!! \nGive your employees some happiness/a break and for fuck's sake... hire some more people. They were doing the best they can, and this is the owners' mismanagement. I had to ask for our water twice from Both waiters, I asked for my drink twice, they took forever to take our order,  and once in... \n\nWe received each dish one by one, with at least 7 minute intervals between each dish. Two vegetarians, two meat eaters, random dishes coming without things like Rice or the appetizer, it was a very uncomfortable food moment. \nWe told the meat eating boys, please, eat before it gets cold. But no. They had manners (or the sense to wait for their own rice?) and then the food was cold when we had all the pieces. The cold food happened to be DELICIOUS, and I just kept wanting to give the workers more hugs.  And just as we had begun to feel fed and let go of any dreams of eating Soup, our Soup came! We had hoped to get the soup  Before the cold food we had just ate... but whatever.... it was warm. \n\nWhen we realized we were going to miss any movie plans because we had been there for so long, we tried to subtly wave the waiter & waitress down for the check. Ignored, I went up and asked for it. I got the worst evil eye from the hipster waitress, and immediately felt compelled to give her a hug and explain that we wanted to catch this movie... (we didn't)... but instead, I just glared back and wrote this yelp review. So, I'm sorry, and I hope you got your hug. \n\n& Damn. The food was so good.

Even the dishes I didn't love, made up for their shortcomings by keeping my interest. The Kung Pao Pastrami was mostly tasty, at times odd and had a spice that flirted with painful - but somehow worked. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere super dark and super loud with a huge paper dragon snaking along the entire ceiling - a bit contrived, but cool.\n\nIf your expecting typical Chinese food or a refined dining experience - either check your expectations at the door or go somewhere else.

Back then I thought it was novel idea to run a comfort chinese food restaurant out of an otherwise ordinary greasy chinese to-go place in the Mission.  Flavors were different and blended together well in many cases.\n \nWell jump to  4 years later, I am back with some friends and parents. I didn't expect my traditional chinese parents to get the twist on the dishes, but at least they would experience different ways of preparing traditional chinese comfort food and get a kick out of the flavors.  The wait is about 1 hr long, even for a Sunday night.  We ordered about 9 things off of the menu.  The highlight was the egg-egg noodle ( which was not salty), and the low light was between the mongolian long bean and sizzling lamb served on a sizzling platter.  The mongolian long bean was salty to the point of inedible.  There was some chinese spice in the bean that made my mouth tangy and numb, and whatever salt was in the beans was magnified about 100 times.  I could not eat a bite of food for about 5 minutes while I waited for the taste in my mouth to clear away.  The sizzling lamb had a very small about of  lamb in it and it tasted dried and way over cooked, plus it wasn't sizzling (not sure why it is served on the sizzling platter).   We also ordered a kung pao pastrami.  The pastrami meat itself is salty to begin with, and the other kung pao ingredients were also salty.  The beef noodle was very different than any other I've ever had. It has a smoked beef brisket in a soy sauce broth which was a nice mixture.  But because there was so much salt in the other 3 dishes, I had a very negative reaction to the entire meal, and I couldn't wait for the meal to end this night because this is the second place I've brought my parents where I was very disappointed (the other being michelin rated Commis in Oakland which I have not written about yet on Yelp).  After dinner, we stood outside the restaurant for about 10 minutes discussing why this place is so successful. \n\n I don't want to pan the place too much, because it is creative chinese food.

Everything I ate was delicious and a few of the dishes were really and truly superb. \n\nAll MCF's ingredients are fresh, very fresh. They use all local produce and meats, and one can really taste the difference in a dish like Tingly Lamb Noodle Soup. The broth is clear; it's rich. The lamb tastes like lamb, but without a game-y aftertaste. The meat has no gristle. The soup is delicately spiced with raw, shaved ginger and scallions, which creates just enough brightness. He uses thick, hand-made Shanghai-style noodles, and the consistency is satisfying and chewy, not dough-y or sticky as hand-made noodles can be. \n\nI also loved the Char-Siu pork over rice noodles with shaved scallions and ginger... perfectly charred and sweetened pork without sacrificing tenderness. And the rice noodles are coated with shaved ginger and scallions and lightly topped with a sweet vinegar. It melds sour, tangy, and spicy while allowing the pork to be savory without erring on the side of salty. \n\nAnd the Salt Cod Fried rice is amazing. It just has to be eaten carefully.  It's a little different than the dish that inspired it, which is a classic Salty Fish Fried Rice. Traditionally, the fish is very salty and smelly, and mixed into the rice. But in this, he skips the smelly, and the cod is fried and placed as a whole piece on top of the rice. And this is amazing, because it's palatable for more people. \n\nThe key to getting all the flavors in this dish is to fill your spoon with a piece of the perfectly-prepared fish as well as some of the rice and sausage. Eaten this way, it's revelatory. The sausage is thinly sliced, because it's a traditional sweet sausage, meant to be a complement to the sweetness of the rice. And if you look at your spoon or notice what is happening texture-wise, you'll also see that the rice is broken-up to create that texture, which is a good way to get at how sweet the rice is all on its own. \n\nFinally, if the Szechuan pickles are the diced long beans in chile oil, then that is also, absolutely delicious. It's Chinese long beans, which are like a longer version of American green beans. They are cut-up and then soaked with thinly sliced chiles and chile oil. The final product is crisp and the chile is piquant. It's really, really good. And it actually reminds me almost exactly of the pickled sides I actually had in Sichuan, years ago.\n\nThe one thing about the place is that it was a little hard on my ultra-sensitive stomach the next day. But I'm a plain rice and veggie eater when I'm not going all out. So my suggestion is for any eater at MCF to think carefully about what you want, maybe ask if they'll comp you a bowl of steamed rice to go with your main dishes (if you get something like the Taiwanese eggplant, for example), and go slow. Eat spoonful by spoonful. The food is quality. It's authentic Chinese basics using great, local ingredients and prepared with care. And if you eat slowly and thoughtfully, you'll find you've never had a better meal. \n\nI thought my my meal was genius.

But it's a clever and well executed spin on Chinese food. \n\nBy no means is this a traditional menu. While dishes are more Chinese than anything else, they borrow flavors from cuisine throughout East and South Asia. One could argue that if dressed differently, these could all be dishes on a more contemporary Asian-Am tapas menu. \n\nThe food is really rich, so you might get satisfied really quickly even though portions are huge. I say go with a group. Try the Pork Belly, Ma Po Tofu, Sizzling Lamb (heavy on the cumin), and Salty Cod Fried Rice. There are better places to have renditions of the Savory Egg Custard, so pass on that.", "author": "Jonathan V."}

We enjoy the salt cod fried rice both times we were there and really liked the lamb dish despite only getting 3-4 pieces of bones with almost all the meat shaved off, probably for use in another dish?... All the other dishes we have tried thus far (pork jowl and turnips, broccoli and beef cheek, and brisket noodle soup) were good with very different  and unique flavors, but were all too salty and greasy since the dishes all had very fatty cuts of meat. We felt the pork belly was fried too long and didn't like the taffy-like texture. \n\nThe place is cramped and dingy and the staff don't seem to be the most sanitary (I wonder how clean they are in back when they felt comfortable putting new napkins that had accidentally fallen on the floor in the clean pile in front of customers). I got knocked several times by the wait staff and was lucky the soup didn't drop all over me.  The plates and chopsticks weren't clean either. \n\nAlthough I did enjoy the taste of each dish and am still curious about some of the other dishes on the menu, I don't think we will return again for a long time since both times we've been there, I have felt the dishes overall are just way too salty. And on top of it all, they are very expensive for this type of restaurant.  I noticed some other reviewers felt this place is cheap or reasonable.  Either they've raised their prices now that they've gotten so popular (and have changed to a trendy new name) and are catering to a more Americanized crowd or else over $10 entrees for lunch is considered cheap.", "author": "Christine W."}

But luckily there were some dishes that weren't so spicy. There were some surprising dishes like the broccoli beef which is not what you expect - it was Chinese broccoli and 1 big chunk of braised beef cheek. The Ma Po Tofu was also good - the gravy was just right. The Pork Belly was delicious on the bed of a slice of toast. This is a different take on the typical Chinese food. The meal was fulfilling and I ordered a soda since the tap water had an odd taste. \n\nCame here with a group of people at before 12 noon and there was no wait.

I do so I was incredibly impressed with this. This is a dish served cold... the revenge of the eggs! Sea Urchin, Salmon, and chicken eggs mixed together. The chicken egg is the base for the custard, and it is topped with salmon eggs and uni with a cold broth. Very unique.\n\nChar Siu Pork Belly - a deep fried pork belly with plum sauce and flat noodles. I thought it was good, as it tasted similar to Lechon Kawali, the filipino equivalent of deep fried pork belly. The plum sauce was a great compliment to the dish, and the rice noodles added a nice bit of neutrality to the strong plum sauce and fatty pork belly.\n\nMa Po Tofu - Not your average Ma Po Tofu... this is completely different from any Ma Po Tofu out there... it uses pork belly, and has seasoning like star anise! Very interesting modernized take on Ma Po Tofu. A little heavy on the star anise, as it did taste like black licorice at some points. This dish is pretty spicy... definitely spicier than what I'm used to from Ma Po Tofu. The tofu is also different... as most places I've eaten this at uses firmer tofu which allowed for cubing... they use a softer tofu, so the texture is mushy.\n\nOverall, a good experience for me.

First and foremost I must say I get annoyed by restaurants that don't take reservations.  It makes no kinda sense.  It irritates people.  Perhaps in the future there will no longer be this frustrating first come first serve free for all.  As a big big fan of anything spicy this place hit the mark for me with very spicy Sichuan style dishes inventively prepared.  Expect a lot of numbing Sichuan peppercorns and chili paste and chili oil.  \n\nThe ambience is your typical hole in the wall Chinese eatery with random mismatched pictures on the wall and a tacky paper dragon on the ceiling.  But as with many dumpy Asian restaurants the food more than makes up for the surroundings.  \n\nNo complaints at all about the food!  The tea smoked eel, Hainan chicken rice and cumin lamb were really good.  Lamb in a Chinese dish works surprisingly well, at least the way they do it.  The piece de resistance has got to be the spicy chicken wings in a basket of flaming hot dried chilies.  Salty, hot, crispy, even the dried chillies were great.  I compare most spicy Sichuan food to Spices II on Clement and 6th ave.  Both places are great in its own right.  Spices II is more traditional fare and Mission Chinese is more creative and fusion.

Once inside, Mission Chinese has a distinct hipster vibe punctuated with kitsch overtones juxtaposed with tradition; a full scale dragon hanging from the ceiling greets you along with a weathered older asian lady, who brings you to your table where a severely tattooed Mission-type waitress takes your orders, with the likes of Muse in the background all this while.  The interior decor is decidedly humble but the eclectic symphony works harmoniously with the friendly staff.\n\nFor food, we ordered the Westlake Rice Porridge, Broccoli Beef Cheeks, and Sizzling Cumin Lamb.  I love that chinese broccoli was used and the beef cheeks were done to perfection.  Although the other two dishes tasted good, I felt that the spices used were too heavy handed, a far cry from the subtle and delicate blend of spices I'm used to in traditional regional Chinese cuisines.

The inside decor was typical to a Chinese restaurant: mismatched things on the wall / ceiling and fake flowers on the table. We ordered the Chinese BBQ, Mapo Tofu (the #1 thing on the menu), pork dumplings (come on, they were homemade!), some vegetable and pork belly.\n\nChinese BBQ: GREAT. It even came with slices of white toast. Great cuts of pork, good BBQ sauce, and it came with an awesome bowl of pickled cucumbers and onions. The vinegar even cut the sharpness of the raw onion and it was perfect.\n\nMapo Tofu: wayyyy too spicy. It's the spicy that's so hot, you can't even taste any other flavor. I would've liked if the tofu was a little softer. The ground pork was plentiful and large, but almost had a mealy consistency to it. I don't understand how it's the most popular thing on the menu.\n\nVegetables: I think it was the bok choy. Very well seasoned, good side dish\n\nPork belly: came with thin, flat and wide rice noodles and thinly sliced cucumbers and boiled eggs. Had nice presentation and tasted great; pork belly was a little dry.\n\nDumplings: came last. We had to flag two different waitresses to bring the dumplings (they had forgotten and even gave us our check before we had gotten them). They were aite, but pretty disappointing. To be fair, they tasted better with the broth they came in, but it's not what you'd think a homemade Chinese dumpling would taste like. And I know they changed the regulations of the temperature/color of what's suitable to eat for pork, but the middle of mine looked VERY pink. Like, up-at-2-in-the-morning-hocking-up-food-poisoning pink.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience. I'm thinking this is the new \"it\" place where you want to be seen and where you can find the most up-to-date \"it\" food with other local hipsters and cool kids. I went to Washington Bakery and Restaurant with the bf today and we ordered dumplings to make up for last night's disappointment, and it was oh-so satisfying.", "author": "Becky K."}

But today I was like, \"You've earned it. It's almost the weekend, goddamnit, and you deserve a tasty dinner to sit & watch the new season of Jersey Shore with\", so I gave Mission Chinese Food a call after having stared at their online menu the past few days drooling on myself.\n\nI called at about 6:15pm, and ordered the Lung Shan Vegan Delight (soup) and the Garlic Eggplant. The girl told me that she'd waive the credit card minimum because it wasn't the dinner rush yet. I immediately fell in love, even though I ended up paying in cash instead.\n\nThe goods came in about 40 minutes and immediately my entire room smelled of garlic, in the most delicious way possible. I slurped down the Vegan Delight soup, which was a miso soup broth with scallions and soft dumplings made of savory mushrooms, in no time. Then I moved onto the Garlic Eggplant, which was seriously garlicky and amazing. The tender eggplant was encrusted in chili flakes and fried garlic, and sprinkled with jalapenos and Thai basil. There was grilled garlic cloves throughout.

Though to be honest, I hadn't heard of it before a friend had taken me and my expectations weren't very high.  Especially after seeing the comically pathetic looking sign out front.\n\nI'll try and dig up the fond memories I had a few days ago:\n\nBeer Brined Sichuan Pickles- 5/5 Delicious, succulent, but refreshing dish.  I used it as a pallet cleanser between some of the richer dishes.  Equally delicious on its own.\n\nSmashed Cucumbers in Garlic Sauce- 4/5 Used it for same reason as above, but not quite the amazingness.  Still very good\n\nTiki Pork Belly - 5/5 Oh my god.  My mouth is watering thinking about this right now.  Perfectly cooked hunk of fatty meat that epitomizes the melt in your mouth deliciousness you'd expect from a restaurant with a higher price tag.\n\nGrandma's Spicy Dumlings - 4/5 Very good dumplings.  I'm a dumpling fiend and these fulfilled my hopes, but perhaps I'm holding out on the perfect ones for a 5.\n\nStir Fried Pork Jowel and Radishes - 3.5/5 Actually better than my rating suggests, but this was one of the dishes I had high expectations for.  Piled my plate once, but saved room for the other dishes.\n\nThrice Cooked Bacon - 5/5 Yep. Amazing.  Other reviews say this was over salted, but seriously?  We're talking about bacon here.  Rice cakes were paired perfectly and this dish and it got cleared off the fastest.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice - 3.5/5 Same idea with the Radishes.  High expectations that didn't get met.  A little overly salted and was a little too mushy for my usual desire with fried rice. \n\nWestlake Rice Porridge - 4.5/5 Great hearty porridge.  Would make the best meal on a cold rainy day inside.  \n\nI can't wait to go back and try again.", "author": "Jesse M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-06", "description": "So I feel the only fair way to review Mission Chinese is in two different halves. Without a doubt this was probably one of the more unique experiences I've had at a restaurant. \n\nThe mere thought of a Chinese restaurant in the heavily Mexican district of San Francisco with Hipster waitresses blasting (awesome) folky music, might turn away a couple of Chinese food purists. \n\nBut who cares about them anyways? \n\nWe waited about an hour outside to get a seat for 3, which I've heard is pretty typical for MC. \n\nSo overall, I think it's a pretty great place for a date if you're with someone that's a relatively adventurous eater. Read: DON'T TAKE SOMEONE WITH A WEAK STOMACH YO!\n\nWhat we ordered:\nRed Braised Pork Belly (Fatty awesomeness)\nSalt Cod Fried Rice (Best I've had in a long time)\nEgg-Egg Noodles (Gingery and crazy good)\nThrice cooked bacon (Spicy, but delicious)\nChongqing Chicken Wings (DAFUQ!?!?!)\nMaPo Tofu (I CAN'T FEEL MY FACE)\n\nSo we started off with the Red Braised pork belly. If you're adverse to fat or have existing heart conditions, it may be wise to stay away from this. If not, this is melt-in-your mouth, party in your pants awesomeness. I've had better at traditional chinese places, but this is a pretty well done dish. Good to share with a few people. The Salt cod fried rice was done perfectly. Not too stinky and salty from the salt cod, a really great balance of scallion, eggs, chinese sausage. Probably my favorite dish of the night. The egg-egg noodles took me by surprise. They give you a raw egg yolk to mix in with the egg noodles, which gives it a richer, creamy texture. The dish is heavily gingered, but they do it in a way that is really successful. The thrice cooked bacon with Korean rice cakes was probably my second favorite dish. The bacon was salty, a little crispy and so well done. The addition of the rice cakes was a perfect vehicle for the spiciness of the dish. It's exactly what I needed. \n\nAnd now we enter the second half of the review, which deserves a name of it's own: \n\nWELCOME TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL. \n\nChongqing Chicken Wings. No dish has ever left such a lasting impression on me, maybe in my life. It lasted the entire rest of the meal, the rest of the night, and the following morning. This dish is not for the light of heart, the light of spice, and the light of HOLY BALLS WHY!? These wings are pretty heavy in Chinese 5 spice, which can be a little off-putting for those that aren't used to it. When you bite into them, you'll notice that they're well fried, and incredibly fragrant. Then your lips start to tingle. Then your mouth goes numb. The wings are coated with Chinese numbing spice, better (or maybe not) known as Sichuan flower peppers. It's an incredibly intense experience and I don't know if I've ever had my face literally go numb from spice. On the plus side, the wings are an incredibly flavor enhancer. Eating the noodles, the thrice cooked bacon, and the salt cod fried rice directly after eating the wings, made each food even more amazing. It was absolutely remarkable, it was like we were eating three completely different dishes. \n\nThen came the Mapo tofu. Now, I am a student of spice. I grew up with a father who loved to cook Sichuan style and grew his own Thai hot peppers. This Mapo wasn't the best I've ever had, but it's definitely worth giving a try. It's a little salty, so I suggest having some white rice around to help balance out the saltiness and spice of the dish. Maybe it was because of the Devil wings we just ate, but on medium spiciness, we were dripping in sweat, which in my case was spreading the spiciness across my face and thereby producing a numbing sensation. What the mapo lacks in balance of salt and spice, it makes up for in flavor. It's a pretty fragrant mapo dish and uses chunks of pork shoulder which fall apart in your mouth. I might get this again, but probably without the chicken wings. \n\nOverall, I give Mission Chinese a 4/5 because I would definitely go back, I would probably order most of the things I got again, but there are ton of really great items on the menu that I really want to try. The wait staff is pretty attentive and friendly. It certainly will be a while before I forget this experience. Damn you Chongqing Chicken wings. Damn you.", "author": "Brian C."}

This is basically sichuan food with a twist, so don't go expecting Hunan or whatever. The flavors are intense and complex, with unexpected ingredients. We ordered the numb lamb face, the lamb noodle soup, the tiger salad rolls, the slow cooked pork belly, the peanuts and the eel and ham jock rolls. The only loser in the bunch was the eel, which had great textures, but overpowering smoke flavor in the eel. Both lamb dishes made judicious use of sichuan peppercorns for just a tiny bit of numbness on the tongue. Both also used fresh hand pulled noodles. The tiger salad rolls were simple and refreshing, maybe worth saving for the end of your meal as a palate calmer/cleanser. The pork belly was rich and crispy, almost like duck confit. \n\nDishes came out as they were prepared as of the case at most asian restaurants. Service was friendly but aloof.

But in MC you pay $4 for what is really just Korean Komichi ( the chef's true origin) except it has no taste. \n\nThe Pork Belly\nIn Sichuan, Pork Belly dish is considered an art of slow cooking. It is all about  timing and  degree of the heat. Well-done pork belly is  tender with texture, not greasy (\u80a5\u800c\u4e0d\u817b). But in MC's version, the lower part of the belly is too fatty, too soft even watery and the top skin are just too stifle to chew...I didn't even touch the second piece. (It's $10 for two pieces)\n\nThe Eel spring role\nToo salty. Too much soy source added to the juice, which is often deemed a sign of amateur Sichuanese cooking. You need to drink a lot of water and beer to go with that.  \n\nSichuanese cooking is also about which part of vegetable goes with which part of meat. But  in MC,  I once ordered a meat dish (forgot the name) just to see major part of my plate was full of  WHOLE baby radish. And it's so tasteless and hard to process, I basically just give up the whole dish. \n\nNO, Sichuanese cooking is NOT not all about spicy source. Spicy  source is normally just the final touch. But in MC, I have had dishes that are basically cooked in the same mix of spice, except they are too salt and too spicy ( MC is using wrong pepper and pepper corn!)\n\nMY ADVICE?\nIf you want fusion, go to THE HOUSE in Mission. If you crave for authentic Sichuaness, go to Z & Y in Chinatown. The latter was never on food critics' radar only because they are too busy with Chinese customers and because they haven't  mastered American's FOOD MARKETING skill -sometime, its all it takes to be famous.\n.", "author": "Din D."}

We were really excited to try some different and delicious food that is hard to find around the Berkeley campus area. It is a short 5 min walk from the 16th St Mission BART station which is convenient. \n\nThankfully, the wait was not that long but the restaurant is small. The first thing we noticed was the atmosphere... in the back of the restaurant, we saw a familiar scene of Chinese ladies peeling vegetables but that contrasted with the hip hop and techno music blaring from the speakers. This is not your average Chinese restaurant and we could see that from the menu as well. For example, we ordered the Hainan chicken rice which I'm very familiar with. When this dish came out,  it caught me by surprise. Although it had the typical \"you fan\" (oil rice) with roasted peanuts, there were tiny pieces of chicken mixed in with the rice which was a bit disappointing especially for the price. \n\nWe also ordered thrice cooked bacon and ma po tofu because they were the dishes our waiter recommended for our first time here. I was really hesitant to order the ma po tofu because they warned us that it is super spicy (one of the two dishes on the menu to receive two spicy icons). It is definitely spicy but very flavorful. The thrice cooked bacon has to be my favorite. I think it was my friend's favorite as well. Despite the dish being a tad oily, it was extremely flavorful because of the pork (thrice cooked bacon). It also had the perfect \"wok hay\" element (the distinct flavor and taste of the food in a hot wok). \n\nThe portions were quite large, especially the ma po tofu. We barely managed to finish the thrice cooked bacon dish and my friend had to take the ma po tofu home. Price-wise, I would say it is decent based on the portion size of the dishes we ordered. Yes, it was a bit oily and we were thirsty afterwards perhaps from the MSG but what do you expect from a Chinese restaurant? Our lunch was very filling and the homey yet modern atmosphere added to the experience. We'll be back again! Oh, and our waiter was super nice and friendly :)", "author": "Helen W."}

Although I don't like to admit it, I generally avoid Chinese restaurants if I don't see it filled with Asians.  In my book, hipster fusion Chinese food = BAD.  Last night I violated my unspoken standards, and gave in to the hype that is Mission Chinese Food.       \n\nWarning: If spicy food bothers you, don't go.  If it bothers your friends, don't bring them.  And stay away if you are expecting traditional Chinese flavor combos.    \n\nBut for the open mind and adventuresome palate, you owe it to yourself to visit MCF!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-08", "description": "My first encounter with Mission Chinese was something of a second hand experience. I should have expected an unremarkable dinner when I popped the \"Tingly Lamb Noodle Soup\" into the microwave for a nice bath of radiation. One bite and I was thoroughly unimpressed. My problem was I was eating my girlfriend's leftover stew. A few months later I was actually in the Mission (current Oakland resident) and a friend suggested we eat there. Looking at this place from the outside only made it less appealing but I went in and I am very glad I did.\n\nThis place serves great food. Let me elaborate. The wait is long but if you manage to get a table order as much food as your body can hold at one time. You definitely do not want to make the mistake of having just one dish, and the atmosphere begs you to share your food so bring a few friends. On my second try I found myself in a state of euphoria after indulging in so many fatty foods I thought my heart would explode from happiness. I'll just talk about the dishes in the order in which they were served because ultimately, as my chopsticks became a natural extension of my hands, I feel like everything was being consumed simultaneously. \n\nThe first dish that was served was the Salt Cod Fried Rice. The names of the dishes are in no way misleading as this a pile of fried rice with some salt cod. The dish, however, is tweaked just enough to make the palate appreciate the flavors that are being combined. The second dish was the Broccoli Beef Cheek which tasted a little like Mexican comfort food oddly enough. The beef cheek was so tender it tore apart easily with a pair of chopsticks and the taste is reminiscent of the Mexican dish \"Caldo de res\". A fan of this dish will feel right at home with this one. The last and my preferred dish was the Thrice Cooked Bacon. It's everything a bacon lover needs. Nice fatty pieces of bacon with rice cakes. The textures are satisfying to the point that even eating the rice cakes by themselves is as gratifying as finding the last piece of bacon on the plate.\n\nBased on the food alone this place is great. Forget about the ambiance and the people that are there or aren't there because chances are you probably won't be talking to them and if you do you might just surprise yourself at how nice Hipsters or people from other lifestyles can be. Do yourself a favor and check this place out before it's gone.", "author": "Javier E."}

Yep, it was spicy.  But importantly, it wasn't TOO spicy.  Very flavorful, and the spice didn't overwhelm.\n\nFried Rice: Pretty solid.  The cod is a nice addition; not fishy at all.

Not overly seasoned, which was a good balance to the other big, bold flavored dishes.\n\nWhen we started eating, we felt like the portions were too small, but I just put away a decent amount of leftovers, so I'm not sure portions are a problem (the fried rice was particularly generous).

The first time we had the Thrice-Cooked Bacon, I thought it was absolutely incredible. My taste buds were dancing like there was no tomorrow, haha. The rice cakes in that dish were especially marvy. The Tea-Smoked Eel is served sushi-style in fresh noodle wrappers, and is really good. Same goes for the Tiger Salad, which is much larger and you know, has salad stuff in it. Nice appetizer. The Hainam Chicken Rice is *very* tasty.

And when better to start than the new year, right?!\n\nHad a crazy NYE and finally managed to drag our butts out of the house by 2pm on 1/1/11.  Needless to say, I was starving.  And nobody wants to be around Hangry Mel.  I needed comfort food.  A bowl of rice.  With something to warm me up in rainy SF.  Lung Shan it is!\n\nOk, so I've been here before when they used to do Thursday night pop ups as MCF (it was a tribute to Rene Redzepi of Noma) and I've ordered delivery once, but I had not actually eaten inside when it was just a Chinese restaurant.  Not really sure what to expect... although I did hear they offer three menus.  Apparently, the third one is a secret one (or maybe you have to be a native speaker?) since we only got two.  But we ended up picking items from just the MCF menu.\n\nVegetarian Delight - I barely even read this description, but they suggested it to us when they told us there were no pork dumplings and we still wanted soup.  First off, the name does not do it justice.  This is soup and not some mish-mash of veggies, which is what I would think based on the name.  It's three mushroom/veggie dumpling in this broth that was just out of this world.  A lot of times, I'm tempted to dump soy sauce or chili in broth-y soups cause they just don't have a lot of flavor.  Not this one.  This was not in-your-face-crazy, but rather a very delicate and yet super flavorful broth.  4.5 stars.\n\nTiger Salad - this was a bunch of herbs/greens stuffed in a rice crepe and then drizzled with chili oil.  A surprising burst of freshness and bold flavors that really woke up my taste buds.  I imagine this to be a staple for me.  Be warned though, it is very filling.  5 stars.\n\nTaiwanese Eggplant - I've never met an eggplant dish I didn't like, but I was a little underwhelmed by this.  It was good for sure, but maybe I was expecting amazing after the first two dishes.  3 stars.\n\nSizzling Cumin Lamb - wow.  Very stimulating to my eyes/ears (the smoke wafting from the sizzling goodness), nose (earthy, cumin/onion goodness), and mouth.  Oh the flavors and the texture!  The meat was very tender and although it was at times fatty, it was complemented by the crisp onions that soaked up all the cumin lamb flavors.  Yum!  5 stars.\n\nOverall - For all of that, it amounted to less than $40.  It really could have fed 3-4 people, but since I was soooo hungry, it only fed two of us.  But then again, I barely ate the rest of the day cause I was so full.  Definitely the value here is great.  Service though was just okay.  Granted, it was new year's day and apparently their regular people weren't working (it was the cook giving us our teapot, but forgetting the tea cups).  Also, I'm not sure how authentic these foods are, but for me it's irrelevant since the food was amazing.  I will definitely be back.", "author": "Melody A."}

I've only been to a couple times for foods to go only, so I don't really know how the actual serving would be like for eat in, but by far what I have experienced especially today ,the service got  A LONG WAY to improve; either drop that shitty american attitudes, or adapt more genuine asian modesty.  Unlike many other asian restaurants, most of people who serve in this restaurant seemed to be less of native asian language speakers which was interesting, maybe for better, faster serving purpose, because of  the busy crowds....I thought.\n\nHowever, I  guess my luck was out of fortune on one of the busy nights, when I stopped by at this place and ordered a food to go. As usual, I waited for my order outside at the door because inside was crowded and busy. I told this dumb caucasian lady who took my order, told her that I would wait outside because there was almost no space inside, and she didn't even bother to give me any sign even though the food was already ready to go. I basically literally waited outside standing for 50 minutes under the cold weather at night. When I came inside again, she totally ignored me and pretended busy working, not knowing anything at all without a single apologetic word or glance. \n\nThen this asian kid with a hat was happened to be unfortunate one to deal with my displacement when I was already quite upset with my exhaustion, but what he gave me even worse was his back talk with \"chill\" american attitude....\"can't you see we are busy here?\"...as if he owned all the rules in the house.\nI was pissed off and I asked him for the manager and he even wouldn't let me by saying he's the one. \n\nWhen I talked to the real manager, I cancelled my order and got refunded despite of his free offer. He humbly dealt with me in proper manner regardless how he was thrown off.

Since then, I've been there a handful of times, and the wait time has gotten longer and longer each time. Their d\u00e9cor hasn't been updated since the Lung Shan days, but I don't mind it that much. What I do mind, however, is having to strip down and jump into the shower as soon as you get home because the stench of grease clings to your hair and all your clothing on the way out.\n\nOf everything I've had, the fresh tofu appetizer is my favorite. Even though, like everything else, it's on the greasy side, the black bean sauce is simply divine. They used to have a different version of it that I liked better, though. I'm also a fan of the thrice cooked bacon and the eggplant. My friend, Lynn, complains about the overuse of Sichuan peppercorn, but whatever. I love it. Everything is spicy, bold, and flavorful. The salt cod fried rice and vegan delight also throw in some much needed delicious subtlety and lightness. \n\nLast time I went with a group of eight, the table before us took forever to finish up, so the waitress gave us some free char siu pork belly and Szechuan pickles, neither of which I was a fan of. I mean, I usually like pork belly, but not when the fat to meat ratio is astronomically high and the pieces are cumbersomely large.

Remember those racist shirts Abercrombie & Fitch created around 2003? It had those Chinese guys on it with rice hats and slanted eyes? That's basically the decor in this restaurant. It's completely over the top. It's like watching a Chinese comedian in yellow face telling racist jokes about herself/himself in order to entertain a white audience. As my girlfriend said, \"I didn't think the decorations would be so 'chinky.'\" We did see one other Asian couple, but no other people of color at all.\n\n1) Chilled Buckwheat Noodles - So salty it was nearly inedible. Just not good.\n\n2) Salt Cod Fried Rice - I got this because it was the most mentioned dish on yelp. Are you kidding me? You can make this at home in about 10 minutes. If you don't know how, just go to youtube and search for \"How to cook fried rice.\" There is absolutely nothing special about this. It's just egg fried rice with a few little bits of fish and chinese sausage. And the salt cod did not taste anything like what you expect when you get a Chinese dish with salted fish.\n\n3) Thrice Cooked Bacon - What a mess. It's like they took a bunch of random ingredients (black bean sauce, bitter melon, pork belly, rice cakes), cooked it together, then drenched it in chili oil. Seriously, what is this?\n\nGet it together people. Throwing a handful of cilantro on Chinese food doesn't make it gourmet.

And a Chinese kid with hipster glasses and tats are standing behind the window scooping soup or something.  Interesting enough.\n\nIt's packed in the late afternoon so I assumed it had to be good. The menu is small.  I like that already.  The ingredients sound Chinese.  I like that too.  Then there are words like \"confit\" and animal parts like \"belly\" and \"cheeks\" that belong on the list of words I love to hear.  This place is pretty serious, sounds like they really know something about food...  I'm in.\n\nI only got two things.  Lamb noodle soup and cumin lamb.  The soup was quite possibly the most delicious noodle soup I've EVER had.  I love fresh Shanghainese noodles, and there was something dangerously delicious in that broth though I am opposed to drinking soup for noodles, I slurped it up to the last teaspoon.  I never had lamb belly before, but was curious because god knows the most superior cut of meat to have ever been placed on this earth is pork belly and this place has now put doubt in me about that.  I saved the cumin lamb and brought it home for my mom and she DESTROYED it.  She was like \"Where'd you get this?  Can you get this for me again?  I'll give you money tomorrow.\"  \"Mom it's all the way by where auntie lives, in San Francisco! ... Wanna go there tomorrow for dinner?\"\n\nThe food has a very distinct Chinese flavor, so I wouldn't call it Asian fusion.  Maybe not even Chinese American, especially when you think about all the other things out there that are labeled as such (panda express etc).  It's very much classic Chinese comfort food, but also more refined than that.  For example, the Sichuanese peppercorns are ground and put in the rub so they don't peskily get stuck in your teeth.

Mission NY has been my go-to place for chicken wings and fried rice since I first went there a few months ago. I had the chance to visit the original Mission in the Mission district of SF recently. The menu was similar but the tastes were actually quite different. The cod fried rice was very good and very close to what it tastes like in New York. The pork belly and the chicken wings were similar but the taste was much more savory and sweet. It was as if they had put chicken salt and sugar into the mix. Overall, it's still a fun experience to go to Mission and the crowd is always happy and cool.", "author": "Wesley H."}

The Mister and I hit up Mission Chinese after the gym one day. We put our names on the waitlist and ended up waiting about 40 minutes. As we watched patrons walk out, we overheard each party make a snarky comment. When our turn to be seated approached, the waitress tried to seat us at the end of a table of a party of 8. We politely declined due to the cramped quarters. When we were finally seated, we we struck by the blunt heat in the restaurant. Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but there could have been better ventilation, A/C or fans at the very least. We were covered in sweat in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe standout of the meal was the thrice cooked bacon and slow cooked pork belly. The pork belly definitely stood out. It was crispy on the outside and juicy melt in your mouth goodness on the inside. We ordered the salt cod fried rice and weren't too impressed. It just tasted like bland friend rice. We also had the spicy chicken wings. At first glace, I was highly anticipating the wings, as they were dry and not swimming in sticky sauce per usual at Chinese restaurants. However, the wings were submerged in a huge pile of dried red chili peppers. Not only that, they were dusted with a layer of cayenne pepper. So the heat factor (from both the spiciness and the temperature) were scalding. This added to the cramped quarters, the sweaty environment, the experience was down right hell-acious. Personally, I left with no tastebuds on my tongue and numbness on my lips. I would come back for takeout or delivery and definitely get the pork belly and and thrice cooked bacon. Too bad their delivery menu is limited. \n\nBoo.", "author": "Sean A."}

The beef cheeks were tender and flavorful, while the onions, chilies and green onions that came with it were a good accompaniment to the beef.  It was spicy (and you can see all the hot chili oil they used in the dish) but not overly so.  Also go the pork belly.  This was also good, but there weren't enough things accompanying the very fatty pork belly.  It really needed additional components to make the dish better (and the 4 slices of cucumber and pita-like bread were not cutting it).  Finished off our order with the mabo tofu.  This was just a standard dish, nothing extra special about it (as i was expecting it to be amazing since everyone raves about their mabo tofu).  I have no complaints, it was spicy, the tofu was tender, the portion was huge but it wasn't anything special.\n\nWill I order from Mission Chinese again when I'm in SF?

As soon as we entered, the place was small, but the space was lit in red light and decorated with lanterns everywhere. I thought it was cool, like a little indoor Chinatown. The only thing is, we didn't have a private table and had to share it with other people. The couple that sat next to us were obviously on a date and I could hear their conversation. I was thinking, I hope the guy doesn't date that girl again lmao! She wasn't good for him I thought coz she acted a little spoiled and privileged. Anyway, back to the restaurant. Service was good too and they were attentive, although we had to cram the dishes so it doesn't overlap on the couple's space next to us! Parking was a little hard to find when we were there.

Yes, some of the dishes are original and not something you'd find at your neighborhood Chinese place.  But just because it's inventive doesn't mean it's good.  Their flavors are interesting, using unusual spices and ways of combining them, but it's just not working for me.  The spicy things are super spicy in a strange way (numb tongues, anyone?) that makes you not taste anything else that's on your plate, and everything seems to have 5-spice powder.  The cod fried rice, on the other hand, was bland: I was hoping for more fish and salt, but it just had no flavor (Panda Express, anyone?).

My buddy ordered the  Kung Pao Pastrami and while he loved the heat, the large amount of potatoes versus the small portion of meat turned him off. Also the rice was dry.  Now for service: they served mine without telling us that my buddy's dish would be MUCH longer. How much longer you ask? About 10 minutes from when mine arrived and this was only after we inquired as he never returned to the table after serving mine to see if everything was ok (I would have said mine was too salty). He explained that the delay happens sometimes when they just open but there was a table taht sat after us that was served first. So to all you hipters who put this on the map...you can keep it.

I like how they say no parties over 8, but in the middle of the floor were 3-4 tables or even 5 put together for a party of about 15-20. The person in charged looked like she was screwing or either dating the head chef, so maybe that's how you can get away with things like that..(lolz).What was funny was how some yuppie woman with a very big handbag walked by a table and accidentally hit the water jug with ehr purse, causing the entire jug to tip over spilling everything on their food and into another person's purse. My major complaint is this: HOW COME NO ASIAN PEOPLE WORK HERE? THERE ARE ASIAN HIPSTERS IN SF OR EVEN OAKLAND THAT WOULD KNOW CHINESE CUSTOMS LIKE WHEN SOMEONE WANTS MORE TEA. \n\n-Good things about this place:\n-Large Mexican coke glass bottles \n-Ginger Beer\n-vegan Chinese options, and because it's hipster orientated I know that they actually put some effort into really veganizing the dishes, otherwise they'd lose hip points :( I'm always eery when I eat at Chinese places because you never know if it actually is \"vegan\".\n-The staff didn't seem overwhelmed with the amount of people..or pissed off.

Thus, I feel I have a good judgment on Chinese food.  So let me begin my experience at this famous hyped Chinese restaurant in the mission district. \n\nNEVER NEVER GO HERE, THIS IS THE WORSE OVERHYPED CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER!!!! HORRRIBLE, I HAVE WALKED AWAY DISGUSTED AND ASHAMED OF THIS PLACE THAT EVEN CALLS ITSELF A CHINESE RESTRAUNT!!!  It should be called \"I can't cook so I'll overspice everything and yet I will give the WORSE service in the world!!!\"   I am still shocked by the people who've rated this place 4 stars and above (it's probably the PF Chang and Panda Express crowd - \"Ohhhh we eat Chinese food once a year and order Kong Pao Chicken and Fried Rice.\")\n\nHere are TOP 10 reasons why you should avoid this place: \n1) I came here at 7:32pm, they told us it's a 40 min wait. Come back at 8:10pm - \"it's a 20 min wait.\"  I ask the waitress at 8:32pm how long the wait will be - \"it's a 15-20 min wait.\"  I ask again at 9:02pm - \"it's another 20 min wait.\"  I finally get seated at 9:18pm.  I don't care if the wait is long, but please be honest and set my expectations. Don't lie to me to just keep me around\n2) SERVICE - Chinese restaurants aren't known for their service.  But when I told the waitress that the food was too spicy, she just walked away. Not one person ever came to us to ask us how the food was or if they could pour us more water. She only cared when the bill came - selfish to only care about the tip.  In all my life, I've never tipped below 10% for food.  I'm a very generous 20% tipper. I gave her 0.2% tip for a crappy $78.90 total bill - i was too lazy to wait for the change. \n3) Food was so spicy!!!! You can hear other people complaining about the spice!  My tongue was burning that I couldn't even taste anything else.  \n4) MSG!!!! All they use is MSG and Spice to cover up their lack of ability to cook Chinese food!  I've never tasted more Salty food in my life!!!! This is not Chinese food, dont believe anyone on Yelp that says it is. \n5) Cheapness - we got the fried chicken dish for $9.00 or something close to that.   They gave us seven pieces of small chickens covered with over 120 pieces of peppers!  I can order 7 pieces at KFC for only $1.00.  I couldn't even taste the chicken because of the spices\n6) The hotdog stand to your right is more delicious \n7) Nothing was delicious. I can't even think of one thing! We went straight to Bi-rite for ice cream just to cool our mouths after all that crappy filled spicy MSG Chinese food. \n8) Be ready to fart spicy stinky Chinese food.  Whatever toxic spicy crap they put in there, it makes you fart.\n9) Plain White rice was the best \n10) This place will probably lead to a case of explosive diarrhea\n\n\nOverall, this is the WORSE experience I've ever had with Chinese food. I've received better service in hole of the wall restaurants in Beijing (the real Beijing).   If you go this place - just set your expectations so low and you'll be happy. Otherwise, please save your time, money, and sanity - avoid this place.  Any other place in SF beats this scam restaurant.   It is truly a SCAM.  I truly believe everyone who rated this restaurant 4 stars above grew probably grew up somewhere without any Chinese food. \n\nGo to Sunset, Chinatown or Richmond district if you want real Chinese food.", "author": "Mike L."}

It began as a pop up but has taken on a life of its own and gone into the stratosphere.  The food offerings are as diverse as the clientele. The place is not huge but can accommodate larger parties in the middle row of tables that run the length of the restaurant. The decor inside is your stereotypical hole in the wall joint with a paper dragon on the ceiling and mismatched pictures adorning the wall. The overhead music playing is gangsta rap!  Lil Wayne, Ice Cube, etc. Ha!  The decibels in here are pretty high with the loud music and conversations going on. You really do need to shout to be heard.  They do not take reservations and the wait times for a table can be very looong but well worth the wait IMO.  Service is hit or miss since its always so busy but always friendly with a smile. Take out and delivery are available which is awesome and speedier than having to wait for a table. Parking in the Mission is spotty for sure. \n\n***Show Down***\nI've eaten here for dinner half a dozen times and have never been disappointed. My favorite dish has got to be the cod fried rice. It is seasoned perfectly and definitely not fishy.  The chongqing spicy chicken wings are coated in numbing Sichuan peppercorns and served with fried dried chili peppers. It's so good I can't get enough. I even eat the dried chilies :-). I've also had the lamb face noodles, thick rice noodles served in a delicious robust broth and chunks of fatty lamb.  Then there's the oddest and most creative of them all, the kung pau pastrami. Big chunks of pastrami stir fried with celery and mushrooms in a savory gravy. So delicious with rice.

However, Anthony Bourdain's recent visit to the City, and a hungry stomach at around 5:00pm on a Friday, prompted my girlfriend and to give this place a shot. \n\nI was actually surprised at how affordable this place is. Most dishes are between $10-12. A lot of dishes peaked our interest, but we ended up settling on (i) Thrice Cooked Bacon; (ii) Broccoli Beef Cheek; (iii) Li Bao Dry Braised Noodles; and (iv) Salt Cod Fried Rice. The Thrice Cooked Bacon was outstanding - good smoky flavor with the perfect amount of spiciness. Broccoli Beef Cheek was a very very close second - the beef cheek was moist and soft and the oyster sauce (which included actual oysters) was not overpowering. I thought the Salt Cod Fried Rice was a tad bit on the salty side when I first had it. But when I had it the next day, I could honestly say it tasted way better. I would skip out on the Li Bao noodles as there was a strange aftertaste that wasn't appealing. Note that the portion size is quite large and we managed to turn this dinner into two additional meals the next day. \n\nAfter a more in-depth look at some Yelp reviews, I've come to the conclusion that a lot of people knock this place because of its hipster clientele, personified by its owner Danny Bowien. I've also come to the conclusion that people suffer from unrealistic expectations - a Michelin experience in a place adorned with empty Cristal bottle vases stuffed with fake flowers. But this place doesn't pretend to be authentic Chinese; rather it openly confesses that it serves \"Americanized Oriental food.\" My kudos goes out to MCF not only for its charitable endeavors, but for challenging my palate to experience something beyond various interations of sweet and sour pork, Mongolian beef, and kung pao [insert protein here]. I'll be back, even if everyone around me is wearing skinny jeans.", "author": "Lael A."}

You guys must be out of towners from a place where Chinese food is not common or you are bandwagon reviewers.  There is NO WAY this is good Chinese food or even good food!\n2. The restaurant must have contacted you when you originally wrote your honest bad review.  They asked you if you took it down they'd refund your bill or give you a free meal, so you did.\n3. We are all being Punk'd!\n\nThis place is truly a scam or some sort of joke on San Franciscan foodies! I can deal with a place with bad food and good service, and I can deal with a place with good food and bad service.  But to deal with a place that makes you wait over 2 hours, when originally quoting you 45 minutes and then having to deal with the bitchy pint size waitress with the tacky eagle tattoo on her left arm or deal with the blonde chic with the batman t-shirt where they roll their eyes at you when you ask if you've ordered too much food, and then give you a scornful look when you comment on how spicy the food is, and then don't even bother checking up on you to see how it's going, it puts me over the edge! \n\nThe food has WAY TOO much MSG and spice!  The noodles were greasy.   It all seemed to be a brown color.  We ever got the green beans, and those even tasted nasty.  The food came out so fast that it was definitely not made fresh. I just felt so unhealthy after the meal.\n\nWe all work hard for our money and to spend time to come to this place and waste my time and money was just a joke.  The food was the WORSE FOOD EVER.  Let me say that again, just in case you didn't get it the first time - WORSE. FOOD. EVER!

I went with a large group and tried a good cross-section of the dishes, and the food was uniformly awful. The biggest complaint here is the level of spiciness- every single dish was absolutely drenched in jalapenos and other super hot spices, so any other flavors were completely undetectable. Why even try to have a so-called interesting take on Chinese food if you're just going to destroy your diner's mouths in fiery bites of fire? We're no strangers to spicy food, but our mouths (and other orifices) didn't recover for days.  Even if you can look past the horrifying spice issues, the food was totally disappointing. For example a lot of the dishes seemed to skimp on the good stuff-  pastrami and bacon are hard to find in the dishes that supposedly feature them.  The barbecue dish we had also came with soggy white bread which promptly disintegrated into a paste, just foul.  The dining experience was further ruined by the awful dim fluorescent lighting and the pounding house music. Even the bathroom was terrible! The only positive points- we discovered an interesting rice cake in the bacon dish, the prices were inexpensive, and the wait staff were friendly and prompt. \n\nBottom line- Don't waste your money on this trend unless you like to wait outside for hours to have your taste buds burned off.

As in, you could barely taste the food.  And in that slight moment of being able to taste it, it tasted sour.  I guess that's the \"uniqueness\" or \"innovative\" aspect of this place.\n\nI've had all sorts of Asian food, Thai, Vietnamese, Hunan/Szechuan, Taiwanese, etc in my lifetime, but nothing resembled the awful flavors from our choice of dishes here.\n\nFood aside, there was music blasting from the speakers in the back made conversation impossible.  Our waitress had turned it down, only for the owner (Anthony) to crank it back up later.  It was awfully generous of him to turn it down when requested directly by us.  That is, until he threw us the check not too long after.  In fact, the moment we slid our chairs out to get up, he turned the music right back up.

No waiting if you go for lunch. Maybe it is not as good or the novelty has subsided. \n\nThe food concept is very interesting. I applaud them for the wonderful twists they put in to regular Chinese food... e.g. adding the rice cakes to the Thrice cooked bacon dish, putting \"cheung fun\" instead of regular noodles in the Beef Noodle Soup.  However, the executions of most dishes are not refined at all, plus overall the food is too spicy, oily and salty. I have asked the waitress to see if the kitchen can tone down the salt and spice and was given a flat no as an answer.  You can only eat this kind of food once a year if you are at all health conscious.  \n\nThe place is a dump and prices do not reflect the quality of the food.

I sat down and the atmosphere was kind of dark and there's a large paper dragon hanging from the ceiling.  We were seated and the restaurant was half full.  A family was just finishing up behind us with a big plate of the Breakfast Fried Rice.  Looking at the menu that sounded really good and they overheard us mention that.  They offered us the fried rice which was really nice of them.  Oh my god, the thing was sooo damn good.  It had bacon in eggs in the fried rice of course.  It was also topped with salmon roe which added the perfect amount of saltiness to the dish.  We're not homeless or anything, we did order some food.  I ordered the squid ink noodles and my wife ordered the pork belly.  The squid ink noodles were good and it wasn't like linguine as I was expecting, but more like the rice noodles you'd find in a chow fun.  It had lamb and yogurt along with some onions and spinach to form a well balanced dish.  The yogurt was a little weird with the squid ink noodles, but overall I was happy with the dish.  The pork belly was delicious giving a nice crispiness on the outside and fatty tenderness on the inside.  They also combined the sweet and saltiness that I really enjoyed.  The service was also great.  We had two servers roaming around.  We were primarily taken care of the dude with the California shirt, beard, and wine red beanie.  They were both friendly, but not too friendly where it would be creepy.  They were both quick and did give us the perfect amount of attention.

What a waste! The pieces that were eatable were very moist and tender and not very gamey at all, but I really wish they gave more meat in the dish. 2/3 of the box was filled with slightly grilled, almost raw onion.

It sounds like something I would like.  Ultimately, the food is average and the twist under delivers or is just way out of left field.\n\nWe started with the Mouth Watering Chicken (an aside: the literal translation is Saliva Chicken, so I'm glad they modified the name).  It had the typical spicy and numbing elements to it.  The chicken hearts were all cooked a little differently (one was still bloody in the middle while most were cooked through).  Ok dish.\n\nNext was Chicken Wings with Explosive Peppers (aside number two: explosive is a ridiculous term for food and it just reminds me of explosive ...).  This is a take on \"la zi ji\" (sorry if my pinyin sucks).  Some Szechuan dishes are some meat deceptively covered in a mound of red peppers.  The dry (non soup) versions typically aren't that spicy and this dish was no different.  The meat in this case was fried chicken wings with a healthy dose of black pepper.  Again, nothing special.  Take away the peppers that are really for show and you're left with black pepper chicken wings.\n\nOur next three dishes were my favorite three dishes of the night.\n\nBroccoli Beef Cheek - The oysters in the dish were a real surprise as I clearly didn't read the menu correctly.  Every component of the dish was really tasty (Chinese broccoli, beef cheek, oyster) but the oysters still seemed really random.\n\nPork Belly - Crispy skin and super fatty.  Really good with spicy marinated pineapples.  I devoured my portion, but my friends had mixed reviews.\n\nSmoked Beef Brisket Beef Noodles - Delivers on both beefy and smoky.  Maybe a little too smoky, but still good.\n\nThe last dish arrived late.  We had pretty much finished off the other dishes by the time it arrived, but it would be worth it, right?  The salt cod fried rice sounded tasty and was featured by 7x7.  I've had the dish more times than I can count, but never one that was featured by a magazine and never one with Chinese sausage, so I was definitely excited.  Well, one bite in and I could tell that I was never coming back to this restaurant.  I looked at my friends' faces and they all showed the \"really?\" expression.  The fried rice was relatively flavorless and pretty much every other salted fish fried rice I've ever eaten has been better.  Maybe this was the healthy version (less oil, less salt)?\n\nAll in all, I'd give the food 2.5 stars.  The swing to two stars comes from the following:\n- This place is pretty much always busy.  That means a line to get in and everyone is packed in like sardines.\n- Our table had spatterings of rice from the previous diners.  There was a baby at the table and a small bowl's worth of fried rice on the ground where he had been sitting.  Can't say I blame the baby.  When we left, the hostess took about 5 seconds and 3 wipes of the table to \"clean\" it.\n- It's very loud in the restaurant with the amount of people and music playing.  The dim lighting also makes it hard to see things, but that could be a good thing.  Some things we don't want to see.\n- We had to remind the wait staff of our last dish and it took a while for it to come out.  That makes us wonder if it ever got put in in the first place.\n- Bloody chicken heart.  I thought that was normal until everyone else showed me the insides of theirs.

Because we got there as they were opening, we were able to get seated right away.

A refreshing and tangy side to have, but not a necessity. If you like pickled things, I would give it a go since it's not that expensive.\n- The Salt Cod Fried Rice was NOTHING special. First of all, there was practically no cod in there. You wouldn't even be able to tell that it was a cod fried rice unless someone told you. I didn't get any pieces of cod until my third serving from the big plate, and even that piece was tiny. In addition, the fried rice tasted just like any other fried rice from any other Chinese restaurant. I cannot believe this is on the 7x7 Big Eat list because it is completely undeserving. \n- The Thrice Cooked Bacon was pretty good. I liked having the rice cakes in there.

My friend heard great things about Mission Chinese Food and usually is very good about choosing places to eat so we were pretty excited to order our food.\n\nTo start off, we waited forever for the food to come (way longer than they originally told me and I had to call multiple times for status updates).  I think it was about an HOUR longer than what they had originally told us.  I was REALLY hungry but at the same time I was trying to keep my spirits up and did not let the extra long wait put a damper on dinner. \n\nAfter the food finally arrived, I was super hungry.  You know when you are super hungry you could eat just about anything and it tastes amazing?  Well keep that in mind when I tell you that the food was REALLY REALLY sub-par.  The first disappointment was that the food looked nothing like the photos.  I got the cod fried rice and it was pretty much plain fried rice.  There was NO FISH.  Maybe I am really clueless and don't know what cod fried rice is but what it sounds like to me is fried rice with pieces of cod (a fish) in it.  When I looked at photos before ordering, my belief was confirmed by the photos that look like they have pieces of some sort of white meat.  For some reason there was none of this present in the actual \"cod fried rice\" that was delivered to me.  When I called to let the restaurant know, they pretty much told me I was straight trippin' and the fish was melted in and I have no idea what I am talking about.  That was extremely irritating to me.  The pork belly was sooo dry.  It's pork belly, how the hell do you mess that up?  I don't know.  The other thing I ordered was the uni egg custard which tasted like a piece of uni with some sort of salty half-melted egg jello/pudding hybrid.  But I will take responsibility for that last dish because I should have thought twice before ordering uni for delivery but what can I say? I was craving some good food, i LOVE uni, and I was hoping for the best.  My friend got some sort of unagi thing which I think he thought were good but left this really bad taste in my mouth. \n\nOh and to top it off it was not a lot of food for the amount of money spent.  What a rip. \n\nAfter eating this food, I wanted to CRY.  (Note: I didn't actually cry.) To sum it up, my experience was HORRIBLE.  I hate to be so mean but I really want to warn everybody out there to help even one person prevent this type of situation.  If you are craving Chinese, go to R&G Lounge instead.  I should have done that instead of try this place but now I know better and life is about making mistakes and learning so they can have one star for teaching me a lesson.", "author": "Amber L."}

It never seemed as if the guys running the place were driving for authenticity. They seemed more akin to David Chang, though in my opinion, they're not remotely near the vicinity of David Chang's ass in either creativity, taste, quality or execution.\n\nTake this with the following grain of salt: I ate their delivery food and personally I think their delivery policy is fairly generous. \n\nMy other and I tasted the ma-po tofu, the cumin lamb, and the hainan chicken.  Delivery came with a takeout container of rice. Nothing blew our minds. Portions-wise, the ma-po was the largest. Hainan came in the same small takeout box size as the side of rice. Cumin lamb was pretty paltry, given to us as a not remotely meaty \"shank\".\n\nAs a person of Chinese descent, I don't have high expectations for Chinese food in the bay area. In terms of flavors, the cumin lamb was pretty spot on, but then again, in that dish, the dominant flavor is cumin - so it's not that difficult. What I hated most about this dish was how it was served. The best and I suppose, the most \"authentic\" way I've had this dish is with thin slices of lamp like what you could find for hotpot. I've also had this with a huge meat shank of lamb, more like a leg of lamb. What Mission Chinese Food gave us was ... not particularly edible. The lamb was stringy and particularly gamy. There wasn't a lot of meat. There were however plentiful chunks of lamb fat layered with skin and meat. I don't particularly enjoy lamb fat.  It doesn't have the same quality as beef or pork fat. In this dish, it had solidified in a particularly grainy and not tasty way. You basically were picking stringy bits of meat off the bone and trying to avoid the nasty bits of fat. Not very enjoyable \n\nMa-po tofu was really meh. They flavored with bay leaves which was fairly novel. My boy nods in agreement. It didn't add anything to this dish. I suppose it's \"spicy.\" It wasn't for my guy, but he's half korean. It was slightly spicy for me, but not unbearably so. I'd say it's about a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  The lack of flavor though... ugh. \n\nHainan was still more meh. Rice was chicken flavored. Peanuts were a nice textural touch. Part of eating Hainan Chicken rice is in the presentation. We weren't served chicken separately. It only came to us as slightly shredded and mixed into the rice. Definitely atypical. I feel a little jipped about the lack of chicken to be honest. Although it is \"authentic\" to include a quarter of a chicken with the rice, we definitely did not have even 1/5 worth of chicken shredded into our rice. \n\nI know my experience is from delivery food, but really? Best new restaurant??? from Alan Richman and BA? ... idk man. As far as I can taste, there is nothing brilliant going on here, either \"good\" or \"authentic\".  Simply more bay area mediocrity. I'd still head to LA for better versions of anything on their menu. CHEAPER too.", "author": "Andrea L."}

The rest was downhill. I spent the rest of the meal wondering why the NYT would rave about this food and so many people would wait so long to eat here. Being someone who travels to China at least 8 times per year and eats in many different regions, it was nice to know that this restaurant was using spices used outside of Canton, where 99.9% of all SF restaurants get their inspiration, regardless of how they categorize themselves. However, i could not help but get the feeling that the dishes at Mission Chinese were nothing more than inadequate attempts  to reproduce something like a Sichuan or Yunnan flavor, never quite getting the right spice/flavor balance and resulting in an unpleasant dish. Our pork belly was 100% fat and zero meat, and being deep fried to boot made it hard to stomach.  Again, the original Hunan dish, which provides fatty MEAT delivers a nice balance which Mission fails to do. Our dumplings were dry inside, and some were already broken when they reached us- this would be a travesty in China to serve broken dumplings, as the seal preserves the flavor and juiciness. \n\nMaybe I am missing something?", "author": "Brian B."}

This is NOT a chinese restaurant, just in case you thought it was. Confused? Yeah, me too. What Mission Chinese does serve is closer to asian fusion (I know, I hate that term too and it pains me to even type the words, but there are few other ways to describe it); whimsical plays on common chinese-american dishes. Like for instance the broccoli beef brisket, this dish is like easting pot roast at your grandma's house...if your grandma dumped fried green beans and salty msg gravy over the top of her pot roast...\"You spilled your kung pao in my pastrami!\"...seriously, talk about two great tastes that don't go great together. And whatever you do DO NOT order the spicy chicken wings. Seriously, don't say I didn't warn you about this. Our server said the wings were a must-try, and that they weren't too hot and really just made your mouth tingle. Well she was right about that part because my whole face was tingling, and not in a good way. I love hot/spicy foods but these wings have an indescribable taste and sensation, sort of like they've been soaked in peroxide, and they're borderline inedible. I will admit that I did like the combination fried rice, and if I were ever to return I would order it again. However I will probably not return because the food is just too bizarre and it is also waaay too expensive, especially considering the place is a dump. I love a good hole-in-the-wall dive as much as the next guy, but not at these prices. I guess I like the idea of this place, but the execution of combining chinese dishes like kung pao and fried rice with traditionally western foods like lamb and pastrami just turns out to be downright weird. You'll leave wishing that you had skipped the long wait to eat here and just picked up a box of greasy chow fun from your local chinese take out joint instead.", "author": "Benny A."}

I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup and it was such a disaster - too salty, too much soy sauce, too much basil, very little beef brisket, and the thick noodle was simply odd because it was still rolled up when I first picked it up with chopsticks from the bowl. I don't know if the noodle is supposed to be a feature because it is definitely NOT conventional Chinese cooking. I am all for cooking creativity, but this dish is just sub par in terms of taste and presentation (black bowl of soup is just not pleasant on the eyes).\n\nI also glanced at the other items on the menu and there was just nothing that caught my eyes. \n\nDon't give this place too much hope before you go in so that you won't be as disappointed as I was.", "author": "J P."}

While there's really no limit to my spice tolerance, I'm over that phase where I essentially downed hot sauce like someone was daring me to do it. I want to taste my food, not the chili pepper. When too much chili is used, it imparts an unpleasant chemical flavor to the dish. This flavor afflicted half the food I ordered (the eggplant and the bacon). The other seasonings were both sloppily administered and overused, leaving me with several mouth-fulls tasting only of of cumin or curry. \n\nThat said, the food showed potential (the chunks of pork belly and noodles were really, really tasty), and Mission Chinese is an unusual restaurant, so I will definitely order again and hope the food improves.", "author": "Adam M."}

I LOVE Chinese food, really all types of Asian food, so I was very excited to see what the fuss was all about.  Arrived at 6:15 on a Monday night.  Place was almost full.  Good sign.  Snagged the last two seats at the the big communal table. By 6:30 there was a crowd outside waiting to get in.  Really good sign.  Also, there was a guy making homemade noodles right up front.  REALLY good sign.\n\nWhen I order Chinese, I like to get a mixture of salty, spicy, sweet and tangy dishes.  I'm also a big fan of fish/prawns and chicken.  I was surprised to see that there was maybe one cold chicken dish (spicy) and one chicken wing appetizer (seriously spicy).  The only seafood I could see was a hot mussels dish which I have to be in the mood for. Since the menu was tilted towards pork and lamb dishes, We decided to try the char siu pork belly which had been recommended, but didn't see the duck or the dumplings which had also been recommended.  We also ordered the mustard greens, the pastrami and the salt cod fried rice.  The fried rice came first.  It was really good.  Loved the fresh ginger that was sprinkled throughout it.  Nice touch.  However, our next dish took at least 10 min to come out so we didn't get to enjoy the rice with anything.  When the char siu pork finally came, I was disappointed at the skimpy smear of hoisin sauce that came with it.  I'm not sure that you could really call it char siu to be honest.  I liked the soy-cured egg and the noodles that were served with it, but that salty pork needed to be better balanced with some sweetness.  I could really only eat one piece of it.  After reminding the waitress that we'd ordered mustard greens, they finally brought them along with the pastrami (which we'd ordered after the fried rice).  Both dishes were incredibly salty.  I don't mind salt, but wow!  It was just too much.  The pastrami was also studded with nearly raw celery which was kind of pointless.  Paired with another, less salty spicy dish it would've been OK, but there really wasn't a lot of diversity when it came to the dishes.  Everything on the menu was either salty and/or spicy.  Perhaps taken on their own, the dishes were OK, but together, not good.  \n\nThe service was also really spotty.  Anyway, the next time I want Chinese, I'll stick to Chinatown.

I guess our expectations were too high based on past reviews.  We had the Tiger Salad - fresh kale type greens wrapped in a soggy noodle doused in soy and vinegar. I added the peanuts to give it some help. The cumin lamb ribs had a blackened crust that was dry & tasted like bark (not the tasty bark of long roasted beef), no flavor of cumin, and the interior was all fat - we casted them aside. The trice cooked bacon and rice cakes were soggy, all stuck together and was nothing like the description on the menu - we pushed that dish aside too. What was good was the spicy beef chow mein - wished we had two orders of it and called it a day. I'm sure I sound like I'm overly harsh but when a restaurant and chef receives such high accolades they should try to live up to them. We spent a fair amount of money to try different dishes that our server recommended as \"top dishes\".

We had the Tiger Salad, which was a salad with a gingery dressing wrapped up in a noodle-like wrapper, pretty basic, but tasty. By far the healthiest item we tried. The Kung Pao Pastrami had the girl next to me and Christiaan gasping for air, but while it was spicy, it was not unbearably so. The Pastrami was tasty but of course very fatty (one bite I had was just a pure lump of fat). This was an incredibly greasy and salty dish, as were the Green Beans. I don't know if it was MSG or just too much salt, but the dishes were just realllly salty and oily. Did I mention salty and oily? Ironically, this is how I imagined Wo Hing General Store's food would taste. If you are in the mood for spicy, greasy, salty food, that may or may not be authentic, go to Mission Chinese. I suspect it might make good hangover food. On the other hand, it could give you a hangover. \n\nOne thing that is kind of fun is the communal tables and the giant Chinese dragon on the ceiling.

The inside is nothing special, just another Chinese restaurant with an awesome floating dragon on the ceiling. Both times I've been the lights were off too - weird. Anyways, I will always chuckle a little to myself when I'm here. The ambiance is just so confusing. The decor and the food are so authentic, yet the ambiance is not like any other Chinese restaurant I've been to (and I'm Chinese). The servers are all young and hip, very \"Mission District\" and the music is stuff I will hear on Live 105. I always have to ask myself, \"Where am I?\"\n\nBut then the yummy food comes out, and I settle down a bit. The salt cod fried rice, as noted, is delicious - probably my fav. on the menu and will be a go-to from here on out. My second favorite is the shanghainese chow mein - it's so traditional it reminds me of my grandma/mom's cooking (they're from Shanghai). Next would be the kung pao pastrami - a very interesting fusion, but it works! Tied for last (out of the things I've tried) would be the spicy chicken wings and the beef noodle soup. The chicken wings were SOOOOOOO spicy, even my Korean friends couldn't handle it. Lips went numb after one piece. We all concurred that we would never order it again. The noodle soup was too \"fusioned\" out for us. It tasted so smoky, without any good quality, since it was a soup. And since the noodles weren't actually noodles but were large rolls of cheung fun (like you get at dim sum), it was very hard to eat. It was also lukewarm when it arrived at the table. Sadly, will never be ordering it again.\n\nOverall, love the fried rice and noodles, and since I love so many other things near by, I'm sure I will be back soon enough.", "author": "Jen L."}

There's usually a line, but it rarely takes more than ten minutes to get a table. Water is served when seated and without charge (there's sodas, beers and some wine too in addition if one's interested) and the food arrives fast and It is insanely good! \n\nI'm not a fan of chicken and would never order it at a restaurant, but the Hainam Chicken Rice is really, really good I realized when sneaking a bite! So savory and perfect with the fresh ginger tingle.\n\nWe tried the One Pound of Salt & Pepper Shrimps the last time and it's worth it's money (being the second most expensive dish on the menu and that being 12 bucks! The top one is the Sizzling Cumin Lamb for 12.5 but haven't tried that one.) The fennel on top was tasty and perfectly cooked. \n\nEvery time we go we have the Pickles to start with, and every time we say we have to try make these at home! I think they have a spice or two in common with the Tingly Lamb Soup, at least my tongue likes to think so. Crunchy, spicy and fresh!\n\nThe Braised Mongolian Beef Cheek and the Lung Shan's Vegan Delight are two other favorites. \n\nIt breaks my heart that the lamb dumplings are gone though, the last time I had them I told my husband I'd eat them as my last meal if I'd get to choose one, they are that tasty!

MC smells moldy, and i definitely wouldn't walk on the floor without shoes.  The music was good, and the service was simple and efficient.   I just couldn't get over the dank smell.\n\nThe food - i love the idea of what they're trying to do, but the execution is far from perfect.  Granted, i tried 2 things.  (the riff on hainan chicken rice, and the beef cheeks and broccoli).  The chicken rice was fairly vinegary, which i didn't mind, but it just wasn't very tasty, and kind of dry.  The beef checks was a hunk of braised beef (i like this.) with chinese broccoli, and some cooked oysters on top.  it was a little runny, and the beef wasn't braised very well.  all in all something that is brilliant as an idea, but when it comes down to taste, was again lacking.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back unless someone else wanted to go and dragged me there, but from my first experience, i was really disappointed", "author": "Brian C."}

It took forever to be seated and upon entering I looked around realizing that I had just waited forty minutes to be seated in a dingy looking chinese restaurant; complete with christmas lights and a contrived mix of late nineties hip-hop.  We ordered the seaweed salad, ma po tofu and broccoli beef.  The seaweed salad was merely average, far too many noodles, it was over-dressed and there was far less seaweed than anyone ordering seaweed salad would expect. The ma po tofu was terrible; too viscus and the sichuan was incredibly overpowering. I'm quite comfortable eating spicy food and I'm familiar with the mouth-numbing effect of a sichuan pepper but this was simply unacceptable. There must have been about twenty whole dried peppers tossed into our dish making it nearly impossible to eat.  Ma Po Tofu is known for being a more complex dish, but this left much to be desired. The flavor was underwhelming and dominated by the sichuan and the sauce was too oily, you could actually see puddles of oil in the bowl. The broccoli on the other hand was very good, the beef was braised and the broccoli was crisp, flavors were well-balanced and the cooked oysters were sweet and not rubbery.  \n\nJust as I was beginning to think the place wasn't all that bad a COCKROACH appeared on our table and began making it's way towards me.  In effort to be polite and to not alarm other patrons I got up, stepping back from the table and waited for my waitress to appear. The waitress looked at me completely expressionless, like she didn't know why I would be bothered by a cockroach sitting on our table with our food; she took the napkin from beneath my water glass and crushed and killed the cockroach with her bare hand.  This was disgusting and I feel sick writing about it but the absolute worst part of the entire situation was the complete lack of acknowledgment or effort to apologize on behalf of the establishment.  From that point on my waitress was nowhere to be seen; I assumed she was telling the manager or would come out and offer an apology but nothing.

As others have noted this is not a place you bring a first date, the ambience is horrible, but the brave like us go for the food and not the surroundings.\nWe decided on salt cod fried rice, the bacon dish, salt and pepper wings and some kind of beef short rib dish that I now don't see on their online menu. All were simply sublime.\nThe salt cod fried rice is amazing, just loaded with flavor. When combined with something like the thrice cooked bacon it really is mind blowing. The fusion of spices and flavor is perfect. \nThe wings, covered in red chili peppers, were divine. Perfectly crunchy exterior with a nice combo of salt and pepper, revealed by perfectly tender chicken past the skin. The beef dish was very good but by then we were so full we barely made it through that dish. \nI will definitely be going again.

It comes across as sort of 'French Dip'-ish, and is piquant, with a lamb jus dipping sauce.  Very tasty and well priced.\n\nSimilarly, the roasted chicken has been replaced with 'Thrice Cooked Bacon\" for $9.  This dish was fantastic, and surprising.  Texturally, there was a lot going on - chewy rice, soft and fried-eggy tofu skins, and crispy, crumbly bacon.  Taste wise, the bacon and the tofu skins were particularly intense, and throughout the dish you'd get an occasional jolt from the bitter melon.  Bitter is not my favorite taste, but they were judicious with the melon use, and ultimately, it was good to break up the rich savoryness of the dish.\n\nPrices remain extremely competitive for the neighborhood.  A lavish take-out meal here will be significantly cheaper than one from Big Lantern, the current Mission chinese powerhouse.", "author": "Daniel M."}

We tried the sizzling lamb with cumin, mustard greens and the pork belly.  \n\nWe first got the mustard greens which were fresh and tasty - lots of garlic and I liked that the ingredient was the star of the dish. The greens were cooked more than I like but they retained a vibrant flavor. Then we waited quite a long time for the lamb, which came on a sizzling platter piled high with onions, green peppers and pickled long beans. The lamb belly turned out to be a combination of belly and ribs- ok with me, I love bones.  The meat was redolent of cumin and was fried very crisp. Good texture but the flavor was somewhat one-dimensional and a bit underseasoned. If you could get a perfect mouthful of lamb, pickled beans and onion, it worked. But there weren't enough of the beans to provide that acidic balance to the richness of the lamb and the sweet raw flavor of the onions. The pork belly had a wonderful crispy exterior and the fat was delicious. My only complaint is that the meat was a bit dry. The crisp skin should be contrasted by meltingly soft meat and fat. I liked the boiled egg served with it. The yolk was still runny and the soy infused exterior provided a great contrast. The sauce with the pork belly tasted like plain hoi sin which is a shame. \n\nThe restaurant itself is a dive but I like dives. My bf reported that the Bathroom was  dirty.

And because Yelp is so overrated.\n\nSo....I've been here 3 or 4 times and this place is definitely unique and they should get an A for effort at trying to put out relatively authentic szechuan food.  I'm just a simple lo-fan so I know not what I speak of, however, I did grow up eating northern chinese cuisine at my buddy's house three times a week so I think I have the right to say a little something. Also, I've been to china several times recently, so have dipped my beak in the fountain of authenticity.\n\nEvery time I liked it, but something was just a little off.  First, the Ma Po Tofu.  The first couple times, I really liked it - very hot, a little greasy, lovely szechuan peppercorn tingle, good light texture to the sauce, a peppery burn - very interesting, if the flavors were somehow not quite spot on.  Unfortunately, they have now changed the recipe, which gives it a deeper meatier flavor, but that meaty flavor now overwhelms the Tofu, and turns a relatively light, spicy dish into a heavy gloopy meat stew that has a texture closer to Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee than anything else.  Af first I was puzzled about the change, but I asked the chef about it and he said that he had indeed changed the recipe.  Not sure what to say about it - I still kind of liked it, but it reminded me of nothing so much as the sucking sound that comes when one pours Spaghetti-O's out of a can.  \n\nHome made pickles.  Love-em.\n\nPork BBQ in cocacola sauce?  Not really chinese, but mmm tasty.\n\nBeef cheeks?  Meh - just a little bit off.\n\nTingly Lamb Soup - just ok, a bit overwhelmed by the pepper corn.\n\nTiger Salad.  Let me just say, this was about the worst dish I've had at a decent restaurant in many moons.  First:  Not A Salad!  Its a couple rolls.  Second:  The flavors are completely off. I could not finish this - its a wierd combination of overwhelmingly sour and herbs with a \"dressing\" that i couldn't choke down.  Do not order this dish.  \n\nCumin Lamb - this is an ok version of what is one of my favorite dishes on the planet.  They do a version at Old Mandarin Islamic that isn't much better, but neither approaches what should be a culinary orgasm.\n\nOk, so that's it.  For some reason, even though I don't love the food, I find myself thinking about it, and I keep going back, because they're food is interesting, different, and relatively cheap.\n\nHope they keep it up, and bring back the old Ma Po Tofu recipe!", "author": "Mike L."}

Since most of the reviews mentioned a long wait and we didn't want to wait in the freezing cold, we went right when they opened. FYI - by the time we finished, which was around 6, the restaurant was 90% full. \n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Smoked Beef Brisket Noodle Soup: not the typical Chinese-style beef brisket, but the meat was very tender and flavorful. I wish they used actual rice noodles (hor fun) as opposed to rice noodle wraps (cheung fun). The broth tasted like soy sauce. Oh, the portion was very small; it literally came and went.\n2. Pork Belly: lacked sauce/flavor, but the meat was excellently prepared. The meat part of the belly cube was succulent and crispy, whereas the fat part melted in your mouth. I really admired the texture. \n3. Thrice Cooked Bacon: the rice cakes were a little hard and some were even clumped together. The bacon was soft and packed with flavor. Overall, the dish was smothered in black bean sauce and peppers. A little spicy (for those who can't handle.)\n4. Ma Po Tofu: I wasn't too excited to learn that this was their famous dish because....seriously, ma po tofu isn't that hard/special to make. Anyway, this tasted like chili. The tofu wasn't all that silky, either. I'd say skip this and you wouldn't miss a thing.\n\nOverall:\n\nTheir flavor, composition and even presentation may not be that authentic, but I can tell they put a lot of work into the texture and preparation of the meat, which is essential in Chinese cuisine.  So mad props for that. Actually, their food beats 90% of the SHIT they serve in Chinatown(s). \n\nService was OK. \n\nIt was really dark (red?) in the room.\n\nI did not find the place one bit hipster.\n\nYes, the journey to the restroom is quite adventurous and have you questioning if you really want to eat there, but hey...if you're craving for authenticity... ;)\n\nI did not love it, but I didn't dislike it, either. It was decent; I did not regret coming here, and even want to take my Chinese food Nazi father here to see what he thinks. That might endure some scolding....", "author": "Grace C."}

The egg that came with the porridge was awesome, but $10 for some porridge is ridiculous. The beef stew with noodles had a really weird flavor, which i think is the cardamom in it, doesn't really go well with the flavors in the broth, the brisket was VERY good! Lastly the buckwheat noodles is the nastiest dish I've ever tasted, I think it also had a numbing effect on my tongue, eel was good though, wish that came over some hot rice. My porridge took forever to come out so they offered us some cucumber salad, which was just meh. Also they notice I barely touch the buckwheat noodles so they didn't charge for it.

The beer was cold, the music my favorite cheesy 90s songs (mostly hip hop) and the dishes were AMAZING. I was so happy, I literally started dancing in my chair and humming as I was eating.

In order of our favorites, we had the sizzling cumin lamb, mao po tofu, pickles, veg dumplings and seaweed salad. We loved it so much we were already talking about how much we want to come back, but we adore spiciness (which most everything was) and funky environs. If you want white tableclothes, a calm quiet setting or no spicy peppers, onions or tons of other bold in-your-face flavorings, go elsewhere.

It changed the way I think about dining out in a way, and definitely opened my mind to the way things can be combined in a dish.  This is not the place for traditional Chinese cooking but if you appreciate food & flavors this is the place.  Don't be intimidated by all the hipster talk - they are open to anyone who appreciates good food & brings an adventurous attitude to the table.  This is almost like going to dine in a friend's basement, if your friend was as creative, fun & casual as Danny Bowien appears to be.  The vinegar peanuts are a MUST.  So complex.  And they complimented other dishes when they were eaten together.  I crave these things.  The longbeans were Schezwan style as in super spicy, and super addictive.  Everything here screams fresh, flavorful and complex.  I tried a friend's Thrice Cooked Bacon - holy moly, super yum but definitely for sharing.  We also shared some kind of peas but they are no longer on the menu so I can't remember exactly, just that I ate Mission Chinese leftovers for lunch 3 days in a row following my visit and I was glad to do it!

Does Mission Chinese have good food?  Yes.  Has it received praise from the food gods of SF?  Yes.  Does that make up for horrible service?  NO!\n\nAfter our first visit a few months ago, my husband and I left with full, happy bellies, but kept saying \"I wish we could've tried ____, but that would've been just too much food.\"  We were excited to visit again last week with more people so we could order more items off the menu.  We have tons of wine left over from a recent party so I thought it would be nice to take a bottle or two.  I called to ask and received a long 10 seconds of \"uuuummmm\" from the guy who answered the phone.  He put me on hold to ask someone else and came back with \"no you can't bring your own wine\".  I thought that was odd, so I looked back on Yelp reviews and sure enough just 2 days prior there was a review saying that they brought their own wine.  Naturally I called back to confirm.  Same guy - \"Uuummmmm, well, I don't know.  Wait hold on.\".  He passed on the phone to someone else.  I, very nicely and politely said \"Hi\" and got cut off by a very RUDE \"Yeah, do you have a question because we're really busy right now..\"  What the..!  Anyway, I did have a question, which I asked and sure enough you can bring your own wine with a minimal corkage fee.  Fine.  On to Mission Chinese.  At least the food is good.\n\nWe ordered what we loved before: Tiger Salad and Salt Cod Fried Rice.  We had the Cumin Lamb on our first visit, but it was really a plate full of sauteed onions and 4 meager pieces of lamb.  Good flavor though.  We were torn between the Beef Cheeks and Corned Beef and asked our waiter what he thought between the two.  He was CLEARLY annoyed by the question. He was like \"well, both are good...it depends on what you want.\"  Really?  That's your response??  Seriously?  Anyway, we went with the Corned Beef.  Although tasty, it was a plate full of potatoes and a few slices of corned beef.  Why so stingy with the meat, Mission Chinese?  Oh, and we didn't get a serving spoon with our Salt Cod Fried Rice.  When asked for one, a fork was literally dropped on our table 5 minutes later.  \n\nI would've given one star, but the Salt Cod Fried Rice bumped up the rating.  There are way too many great restaurants in SF that aren't bothered by the great business they receive and are happy to serve their guests.  Attitude such as the one displayed at Mission Chinese was appalling enough to turn me away from the establishment all together.", "author": "Aisha W."}

It wasn't cubes of steak, but whatever they did to it... it was super tender.  not your typical brocolli beef with oyster sauce, that's for sure. for starters, there were actual oysters in the dish!\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice - If you've ever had salted fish and chicken fried rice, this is not the same thing. but good.  it was the most normal thing we had last night.\n\nOVERALL, i can say that everything was a VERY different and unique take on what I'm use to for typical chinese food. It was worth a try and I'd probably go back to try a few other things (mouth watering chicken, char siu pork belly, ma po tofu that every table seem to have, long beans).  Portions were fairly generous, given we both were able to have enough for lunch today... \n\nIf you love \"chinese\" food and want to opt for something more... adventurous? give this place a shot. you'll either love it or hate it. \n\nme?

The pickles, which are already full of flavor in and of itself, only tasted like really salty pepper and oil.

All of them were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, moving around, but not actually doing anything productive.  \n\nI call for take-out, and the girl who answered sounded like she had no idea what items were on the menu.  The turnip cake turned out not to be an option.  No reason, just not like they sold out  or anything.  She tells me food would be ready to pick up in 10 minutes.  Got there in 20.  Nobody knew what my order was.   Apparently the girl hadn't remembered or bothered to put down my name with my order.  It's a bad sign when you see 20 paper order slips scattered across the cash register with the staff having no clue which order they belonged to.   Had to repeat 5 times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-07-17", "description": "I find it revealing that some reviewers of this restaurant have to prove JUST how multicultural they are by proclaiming themselves to be experts in Chinese food and will brag about how this is Chinese food and that is not). Now I am all for cross cultural exchange, and one accessible way is through food but you don't see me declaring myself  to be the expert on authentic Ethiopian food, Mexican food, or Korean food. Bottom line is, unless you grew up in that culture and have access to all its nuances, you do not know enough to proclaim yourself as an expert. It's okay not to be so worldly and experts in everything, even Anthony Bourdain (as he usually goes to \"exotic\" places and experiences cultures not his own), he can still fully enjoy the food and experience. Because even as a so called expert and food writer, he has the intelligence and humility not to fall into that \"I am an expert in ______ culture\".) \n\nLikewise, I found Kelly A.'s review to be offensive in her xenophobia and stereotyping. Now she admits she does not like Asian food for the high salt (valid from a health standpoint) and \"scary\" factor (totally xenophobic and racist).  I can tell you that 99.9% of Chinese restaurants in America serve nothing more scary than what you see in an Italian or French restaurant. Once in a while there will be a restaurant that serves items like turtle, frog, ostrich but there is rarely \"weird meat\" out there-- what's next, is she going to conjure up visions of opium dens and stories of white slavery in Chinatown?\n\nNow that I have gotten that off my chest, the food was decent. The mapo tofu was good but there is much better (and truly spicy) Sichuan food at Z & Y in Chinatown, Panda Country on Geary, and Little Sichuan in San Mateo. We did quite a bit of eavesdropping on the tables around us and everyone was raving about how big the portions was for the price and how it was soooo authentic! Umm, not really. It was bigger compared to places like Slanted Door that serves you tiny plates at $15 a pop but compared to most Chinese restaurants, the prices were about $2 too high per item and the portions maybe 30% smaller. (We only ordered off of the Mission Chinese Food menu and not the Leung San menu.) The peking duck chinito was tasty and a spin on a very similar Cantonese breakfast dish, which had all the same ingredients but the duck. The soup was tiny, even at $5 but tasted alright. Props to the restaurant for at least not charging us for staples such as tea and an extra bowl of rice which they will do at some hipsterfied establishments. Service was especially slow for us as the waitress for our area spent half of her time chatting up her friends at the next table and regaling them with her travel itinerary. And she did this while the restaurant was very busy and everyone else was running around. But, when she did come to our table, she was all right. \n\nSo do I have anything against people that like this place? No, the food was decent and everyone has a right to how they liked the food but please stop there. You have nothing more to prove. And as for someone's opinion that this is \"foodie\" Chinese food, in my experience, this was not. There are other places if you want \"foodie\" Chinese food. The food was decent but its popularity is greatly helped by the hipster oh-let's-be-ironic decor and the pompous confirmation it gives to some reviewers of their expertise in other people's cultures.", "author": "Empress C."}

I would definitely go back to try other items and can only hope they reopen the NYC location.", "author": "Pamela N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-24", "description": "This was my third visit over the course of a week - needless to say, I'm a fan.  Locale leaves a bit to be desired - I can't tell if it's appropriate or just plain dingy.  \n\nFirst visit - Ma Po Tofu, Szechuan Pickles.  Ma Po Tofu was excellent: fiery and rich, the Berkshire pork showed especially well.  Would have liked some flower pepper, though.  Szechuan pickles were less impressive - good kick with the flower and chili peppers, but a little too acidic for me.  \n\nVisit II - Szechuan Chicken Wings, West Lake Rice Porridge.  Wings were fine - it's hard for me to not like anything fried szechuan-style.  Porridge was AWESOME - great rainy day comfort food.  Oxtail and dungeness lend it a lot of richness which is cut nicely by the ginger and cilantro.\n\nPart III - Tea-Smoked Eel, Thrice-Cooked Bacon, Cumin Lamb.  Eel is definitely worth a try - eel comes wrapped in cheong fun (cool presentation), with celery (good contrast), and possibly fried noodle (good for texture).  Fun take on cheong fun.  Thrice-Cooked Bacon was equally kick-ass - great spin on nian gao (shanghai rice cake).  Spicy peppers, rich fatty pork goodness, and some slightly sweet tofu skin made for a unique and well-balanced dish.  Cumin lamb also had some great flavors going on (interesting presentation with huge chunks of lamb belly on bone).  The accompanying side of pickled long bean was nice (though a bit salty on its own).\n\nIt's hard to pin down what's going on here.  I don't buy Mission Chinese Food's claims of being \"Americanized\" per se, it's a place I'd happily take my parents and grand parents to.  It's certainly a unique take on Chinese food, borrowing from many regions.  To me, it's fun, light-hearted, and also a great take on Chinese dishes and cooking styles.  Many Chinese dishes can be a bit one-dimensional - the dishes here always have a lot going on and show great balance and depth.  Great value, too - it's quickly turning into a staple in my diet.", "author": "Christopher C."}

Tingly spice in all of the dishes - fresh, amazing food.  Salt & pepper prawns (think Chinese fajitas) were incredible - cumin, fennel, perfectly carmalized, kicky spice.  Lamb noodle soup - rich dark broth, toothy noodles, crispy lamb (never mind the bits of fat, just go with it).  And of course, the ma po tofu was divine.  The slow-burning spice creeps up on you over time, which makes this dish get better and better.  We'll be back, and back, and back.", "author": "Julie L."}

I mean that as the highest of compliments, so I hope it's not taken in the wrong way!  It's a California/American take on (mostly) Sichuanese food in the same way Momofuku is a New York/American take on Korean/Japanese food.\n\nI'd venture to say that the Yelp reviews are MCF are so bimodal because of the difference in expectation.  If you go expecting traditional renditions of your favorite Chinese dishes, you will be sorely disappointed.  You're better off saving that experience for somewhere in the South Bay (or better yet, the SGV waaaay down south!).\n\nThat being said, I thought MCF was just outstanding.  The dishes I had were exploding with flavor.  They were also quite spicy (it helps that I absolutely loooove spicy food and the ma la quality which characterizes so much of Sichuanese cuisine).  I also thought the dishes were quite thoughtful and creative.\n\nIf you don't want to get too intellectual about it -- just go because the food is interesting and delicious.  But it's definitely not traditional.\n\nWhat we've tried so far:\nEgg custard with uni & trout roe - The coldness caught me by surprised even though it's in the 'cold dishes' section of the menu (duh).  Very crisp, clean, and seafood-y tasting.  If you don't like fish, steer clear of the fish roe.  The shiso was a nice and unexpected complement to the briny, fishy flavors.\n\nNumbing lamb mien - Hand-pulled noodles had amazing flavor and texture.  Spot-on.  Spicy and numbing as promised -- but also oh-so-flavorful.  If you have a low heat tolerance, you'll probably only taste the spiciness.\n\nSizzling cumin lamb - Milder heat with green chiles & onions.  Speckled with whole cumin seeds, which made for a nice contrast of textures.  Lamb belly was rich and unctuous.  \n\nYoung mustard greens -- Not spicy at all.  Nicely blanched and  then tossed with minced garlic with good crunch and flavor to the greens.  Excellent complement to all the other fiery dishes we had!\n\nThrice cooked pork -- I was surprised to find dduk (Korean rice cakes) in a 'Chinese' dish but then again, this isn't really a traditional joint.  Fatty, spicy and delicious.  What else can I say?\n\nTotal bill (including two beers and a ginger beer):  $70 plus tip.\n\nThe wait was longer than expected (we were told '30 minutes') but it was probably closer to 40-45.  It was absolutely worth it though.  Even though the place was packed and our server was a little harried, we never felt rushed or pressured to leave, which was an unexpected bonus.\n\nDefinitely go.  Even though I'm going to call this place 'fusion,' it's not fusion like PF Changs.  It's just mouth-wateringly good.  Extra bonus points since we got to watch Danny Bowien pulling noodles in the window -- shortly thereafter, he personally brought our our cumin lab dish.  If that's not a restaurant owner pouring his heart, soul, and sweat into his establishment, I don't know what is.", "author": "Coco L."}

Unfortunately, what that meant is that the dish was simply radishes and garlic in soy sauce. That's 11 dollars, and is not a meal. I guess I just assumed that if something is advertised as a vegan or vegetarian option, that means that there is some food on the plate, not that they would simply give you the garnish that was around the meat. Again, I get it, this place is for meat eaters, but one shouldn't advertise something as a vegan \"large dish\" when it is simply radishes, or when ordering, should warn the person that their meal is a garnish.\nThe owner stonewalled me, said i could have a refund (as though I am about to have a delivery person drive across town to give me $11), and refused to admit that there is anything even slightly funny about the idea of charging the same amount for a large meat dish as plate of garnish. He said I am entitled to my opinion; thanks, dude, here it is, and I believe it is common sense.\nObviously this place is doing well because plenty of folks think lines=quality and salt=flavor. I will go literally anywhere else next time; maybe this place is fine for meat eaters, but they clearly aren't making an effort otherwise, and shouldn't pretend that they are.\nIf there are any people who can actually eat radishes and salt as a whole meal, please contact me and I will remove this review.", "author": "Patrick W."}

The pork belly was nicely presented..very crisp large 2-3\" cubes or pork belly on an oyster style sauce, topped with a fresh chili and micro sprouts, with fresh pineapple on the plate as well; a bit of a play on sweet and sour. One of the neighboring tables shared some of their salt cod rice ( they found it too salty, but I liked it) and  Ma Pao tofu with us..that was awesome: thanks neighbors!  \nI too liked the music selection,and  our waiter was really friendly.

Went there for a late dinner expecting to wait for at least an hour because when we wrote our names down, our party of 4 was 11th in line. Preceding us were parties of 2 or 4 or 6 and peeking through the windows the place was already packed. But we must have timed it well because some parties dropped out or wandered away missing their call and we actually got in within 20 minutes.\n\nThe dining area was small and very eclectic with the white tiny holiday lights decorating the walls and the long cloth dragon suspended over the length of the ceiling. Odd that rap music was playing in the background. The diners were in their 20's to 30's but I didn't feel awkward being the senior patron of the establishment for the evening. Even though the tables were pretty much nestled so close together you had to skinny up to walk through, when we sat we did not feel crowded at our table. \n\nDaughter had been here a couple times before and recommended the BBQ platter which had 3 different types of pork and a perfectly poached egg adorning each side of the platter. I saw a dish of bok choy on one of the tables and ordered that and being such a common dish, this was so flavorful with the garlic chives and mushrooms and cooked to perfection....not soggy or limp. The pork belly was classified as a small plate on the menu but there were 4 huge portions on the plate and it was crispy and melted in your mouth at the same time. The salt and pepper shrimp was done with whole shrimp so there was no excuse not to suck all the spices and flavoring before ripping off the head and the shell to eat the meat. We also had the pork dumplings in the hot and sour broth and the best way to eat it was to make sure you slurped some of the broth while eating the dumpling. Steamed white rice and tea rounded out our meal. I was surprised at how large the portions were for each dish. I had assumed it being asian fusion that the size would be smaller and am glad to have been wrong. \n\nI would be happy to eat here everyday so that I can select all the other items on the menu.

It is more like chinese inspired cooking and is damn good.\n\n4 of us, about 16 bucks each. We left all full and all very pleased. This place far exceeds its price tag. I loved the beef cheeks, pork jowl, pork belly. The thrice cooked bacon I didn't enjoy as much, it was a bit smokey for me. The veggies in that dish were definitely awesome though.\n\nThe quality of ingredients used at this place are clearly top notch. They must go to great lengths to secure prime ingredients, and it shows.\n\nAtmosphere is casual. I was there on a saturday night, accidentally got there 30 minutes before they open (open at 5) so killed some time nearby before we went back about 5:05.

Favorites include the spicy lamb noodle soup, the fried rice, and the ma po tofu. Last week, we ordered our usual and were really bummed about the change in the ma po tofu. What's up with the pork chunks? The seasoning is all the same, fantastically mouth-tinglingly szechuan pepper spicy, but we missed the ground kurobuta pork. Please bring it back Mission Chinese!!! Or, hopefully it was just an off night because the lamb dish we ordered last week came out as ribs with very little meat and not the seasoning that had been on the menu. \n\nThe restaurant does play some good music for a Chinese restaurant but may need to change up its playlist a little (I know, can't have it all). But, if you've been there a few times, or go regularly, you'll hear some of the same old school R&B again.

I got the salt cod fried rice which was good but to be honest I don't know how this is different than fried rice with Chinese sausages.  It didn't seem to have a lot of cod for me to say that it should be called \"Salt Cod Fried Rice\". I also ordered the \"Sour Chili Chicken\" which was tasty and I really liked that it had potatoes.  My least favorite was the \"Ma Po Tofu\" which I have to admit wasn't bad.  It's just the dish that didn't get finished.  The problem for me is the price. I ordered take out for 3 entrees that cost me 43 bucks.  I called it in and food was ready when I came by so service was not an issue.

I'm on my third visit to MCF. If I could go everyday I would. \nThere's a lot of hype about this place and it is true that it's loaded with hipsters that beg to be made fun of, carrying in their cans of PBR and Tecate wrapped in small brown bags and sporting expensive t-shirts that manage to look pretentious, expensive, yet all together meaningless and cheap all at once. (How is it that Hipster seems to be a male identified fashion movement? Hipster chicks are somehow simply accessories with pixie cuts and skinny jeans?) But I digress...\nAs stated elsewhere, MCF is somewhat undercover, serving out of Lung Shan restaurant. The melamine tables and no-frills sensibility of the restaurant are rendered charming by the large parade dragon that coils around the ceiling, and the reddish glow of the paper lantern covers and dragon somehow make everything look exactly as it should in a secret Chinese hole-in-the-wall that turns out amazing chow. The whole effect is made somewhat surrealistic by the ever changing soundtrack. My first visit involved some Nick Cave and Lou Reed, The second was hip-hop and tonight was apparently Katy Perry remix night, What?\nUnless you go during the day, be prepared for a wait. Don't pout, don't whine, just put your name on the list and enjoy the wildlife viewing of the Mission until your name gets called. We waited quite a while, and the smell wafting out of the door as diners came and went was nearly maddening. At some point 30+ minutes into the wait, the door opened and a bolt of light from heaven revealed the man himself, Danny Bowien, bearing a steaming plate of pulled pork trotters and a pile of forks. \"You guys have been waiting a while, share it around out here\". I stood there like I'd won the lottery. I held the plate and passed the love along. It was a glorious mess of pork happiness atop a layer of white bread soaking up the saucy deliciousness and a side of fresh pickled cucumber and onion. Our entire wait simply melted away and the goodwill amongst waiting guests was palpable.\n\nThe food is supernal. Tonight was my other mother's birthday, we planned on ordering a lot of food with the intention of taking leftovers home, and we executed that plan with the precision and aplomb of a Gay spandex clad drill-team. (ok, not as many leftovers as we thought)\n\nThe service is fast and friendly, the servers busy, but gracious. We started out with the pickled vegetables. My mom slurped the pickling juice out of the bottom of the bowl it was so good. The Lion's Head meatball is the stuff that Cup o' noodles dreams of growing up and being, if Cup O' Noodles dreamed of being a neurosurgeon spice merchant adventurer who models for Vogue on the side. The Hainam Chicken rice is creamy, mild, understated and rich. The smoked eel left my husband begging. The chili chicken wings came in a sea of chili pods so dense that you had to dig to even see the wings. Like little buried treasures, the slightly metallic tang of the chili's on the thin perfectly crisp skin passed quickly into a long, slow tingle that lasted the duration of the meal but never interfered with the other dishes. The Char-siu pork belly was a textural masterpiece of dense meaty pork and ethereally light fat. I'm sure that fat layer took an entire day off of my lifespan and I don't care, It was worth it. The tea smoked egg on the side had a runny yolk that was so creamy and delish I'll be trying to figure out how they did it for weeks. We got the Ma Pa Tofu which tastes like a Chinese mother re-imagining Bolognese with what she had on hand after only reading about it in culinary fairy tales.\n\nI guess you might think the roll-back bars on the window's are for after-hours safety, but I now firmly believe it's to keep people from leaving too many nose prints on the windows. \nGo, Go now.

We ordered the Black Vinegar Peanuts to start, then moved onto the Kung Pao Pastrami and the Salted Cod Fried rice.  I think the dishes could be best characterized as authentic Chinese flavor meeting contemporary creativity.  The peanuts were tasty and fun to eat with chopsticks, definitely a salty dish, but good if you don't mind salt.  The salted cod fried rice was full of flavor, but since it didn't have much salted cod if we went again we'd probably set that aside as a family style side.  The Kung Pao Pastrami was so good it almost pushed this to a five-star review.  Aggressively spiced with chili oil, but the perfectly tender Pastrami and a melange of peppers, chilies, onions, and roasted peanuts made an excellent combination.   $10 corkage and good deals on beer.

I should've known that when I realized I was the only Asian customer in the nearly 80% occupied restaurant.  My biggest issue was the excessive usage of chili pepper/jalape\u00f1o.  It made me wonder:  are they using the chili to mask the lack of depth in their dishes' flavors? \n\n1)  Slow Cooked char siu pork belly \n-The dish came with 5 pieces of pork belly beautifully cooked.  It's fatty and flavorful.  Unfortunately, portion was cut too big.  I felt sick after having half of 1 piece.  In other restaurants where I enjoyed similar dish, the meat would be cut more into a bite-size portion.  Tea-smoked egg was just okay.  The flavor was barely detectable after eating a couple of other [tongue-numbing] dishes.\n\n2) Salt Cod fried rice\n-one of the my two most-likable dishes of the meal.  Nicely balanced flavors.  When it first came out, cod pieces were too salty.  However, the left-over next day was much better.  Good 'day after' dish.\n\n3) Thrice cooked bacon\n-the bacon had a nice smoky flavor.  Rice cake was cooked well with a chewy bite.  Again, it was seasoned with too much chili oil that over-powered most of the ingredients.  When I was able to successfully uncover a single piece of a rice cake or bitter melon that's not overly covered by the chili oil, I was quite happy the original flavor combination (sans chili oil)\n\n4) Taiwanese eggplant\n-my favorite dish of the night.  Eggplant was cooked nicely with a wonderful balance of basil flavor.  I don't know how Taiwanese it was, but I'd say that was one dish more recognizable as Chinese food.\n\n5) 7 chicken wings with explosive chili pepper\n-imagine a large serving plate with 7 little wings on.  Then, pile on chili pepper after chili pepper until it resembles a small mountain.  To eat the wings, you have to fish them out under the big pile of pepper.  After you've consumed all wings, you wouldn't be able to tell that you didn't just simply order a large plate of chili pepper with nothing else.  Taste?  I doubt anyone tasted anything after their taste buds have been numbed by all the spiciness in all other dishes.  The skin was a bit dry & chewy... not in a good way.\n\n6) Sizzling cumin lamb\n-if I could imagine less chili oil, the flavors probably worked well.  Lamb could've been prepped more to minimize the strong \"lamb\" taste.", "author": "diana t."}

I've had the high-end, the greasy, dim sum, pastry, hole-in-the-wall specialties (hello Gourmet Delight BBQ!), and more.  I therefore wish to be taken seriously when I say that the Szechuan-based cuisine at Mission Chinese Food (not Lung Shan) is The Best Chinese Food I Have Ever Eaten.  The best.  Particularly when you take into account the low prices they charge for dishes you would only find at fine dining, new Chinese establishments.  Almost every single dish I've been served so far has been mouth-wateringly delicious, cooked superbly, and spiced wonderfully.  The two exceptions so far have been the Szechuan pickles, which are neither as spicy nor flavorful as I'd expect, and the Salt Cod Fried Rice, which is delicous but needs a little more salt cod in my opinion.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall, and the interior is spare other than the AWESOME dragon chandelier that spans the ceiling of the room.

Whereas Andy Ricker's Pok Pok looks to bring Thai dishes in their most traditional and authentic forms to the masses, Danny Bowien is taking Chinese and Sichuan dishes, going balls out creative, Westernizing it, and then delivering it to the masses and saying, \"HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?\" And it's freaking delicious. The savory egg custard (with sea urchin, salmon roe, citron, apple, and green perilla) is pure ridiculous delicious decadence. Stir-fried pork jowl and radishes (with fermented black bean, mint, and red perilla) is so unbelievably satisfying, it's hard to believe it's not laced with something illegal. The salt cod fried rice (mackerel confit, Chinese sausage, egg, and scallion) is both familiar and different yet remarkable. Sizzling cumin lamb (salt and peppered lamb belly and chili-pickled long beans) is best summed up with this phrase: HOLY CRAP.

The wings were way over-spiced, and, I think, unnecessarily overpowering, with substantial amounts of spice rub that could be scraped from the skin (they serve only the flat mid-joint, not the \"drumstick\" part). As for the Kung Pao Pastrami, I'm used to NY-style pastrami that's been cured in brine, and not so heavily smoked as here. The pastrami chunks were a bit dry and too lean; there should be some marbling. Finally, the lack of useful lighting didn't help in taking in the overall dining experience, even with a table close to the window at this hour.

We have seen a lot of glowing reviews about Mission Chinese Food, from NY Times to Bob Appetite.  I had looked it up on the web to see what the menu looked like and had some trepidations before we even got there.  I was worried about the food being too spicy for my husband, and I was worried myself about extremely fatty food like pork belly.\nBut because of all the great reviews, we decided to give it a try.  The best thing I can say is that we got a great parking place, and there was no wait at 1:00 on Monday.\nWe ordered fried rice, chicken salad with chicken hearts, and the cumin sizzling lamb with long beans.  \nFried rice was OK.  Miniscule amounts of chicken, a few peanuts, nothing great, but nothing bad.  Slightly more tasty than white rice.  \nThe chicken salad was the best for me, but too spicy for my husband.  Slices of chicken breast, cucumbers and cilantro on top, deep fried chicken hearts which were pretty tasty, a pretty good dish, but swimming in chili oil.  \nThe sizzling lamb dish came on a sizzling iron skillet and smelled wonderful. Alas, it didn't turn out so much.  The meat was 5 - 6 chunks of bony fat.  The vegetables, mostly onions, were good with the aforementioned rice, but despite its lack of a \"spicy icon\" on the menu, was loaded with some type of small, sliced, and extremely hot peppers.  Needless to say, hubby wasn't a fan, and I picked most of them out of my portion as well.  Perhaps it was a blessing that there were no long beans on the plate.\nPerhaps we should have refrained from going here in the first place, and maybe the negative review is too harsh, but we made an effort not to order things we knew ahead of time that we wouldn't like - spicy & fatty.\nInterior doesn't seem funky or hip to me, just dumpy, and I actually have an unbelievably hysterical vision of the Chronicle/NYT/Bon Ap reviewers walking through the grubby kitchen to the garbage and junk strewn restroom area.  Yuk.\nI guess you can tell that I won't be back and advise you not to go the first time.", "author": "Lee D."}

Talk about overhyped. Had read and seen all the incredible press about Danny Bowien and this place and really expected a standout, original, quality meal once I made the trek in from LA. What I got instead was a phenomenally greasy and disgustingly over salted (note: I'm an admitted salt fiend and even this was too much for me) semblance of supposedly authentic Chinese food. Ordered the much lauded salt cod rice (seriously? Zero salt cod flavor. Couldn't hold a candle to even the most average hole in the wall shop you'd find in the streets of Hong Kong); the thrice cooked bacon (swimming in grease, intensely salty), the tea smoked eel (the actual rolls weren't bad but were ruined by the pool of soy sauce they sat in, making it inedibly salty); and the sweet peas (probably the best dish of the four because it was so simple and didn't get slammed by an over seasoned heavy hand). All in all, it was a terrible meal that left both myself and my date feeling not only let down after much anticipation, but physically pretty awful after (heavy MSG perhaps?). I've read that Bowien has since abandoned the SF MCF to tend to his bustling new outfit in NYC. And maybe that's the problem here.

But to call this Chinese food? Authentic? Innovative? However you want to qualify it -- this meal was straight up HORRIBLE.\n\nWe ordered the much talked about Sichuan pickles (see SFoodie: http://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2011/05/no_x_sichuan_pickles_at_missio.php; No bueno Jonathan...). And it was SALTY as all hell.  The sodium level pierced all corners of my mouth. Every single bite caused my eyes to tear. \n\nWe also got the triced-cooked bacon.  This was probably the easiest dish to stomach.  Still salty, but the rice cakes did wonders to evenly distribute the sodium...\n\nThen, the lamb noodles and salted cod rice came.   Now, I have to admit that I had high expectations for the lamb noodles considering I dined at Xian Famous Noodles (see the best place on earth: http://www.yelp.com/biz/xian-famous-foods-new-york-3#query:xian%20noodles) three times in a single week.  Again, the sodium content was through the roof.  It didn't help that the dish was spicy too.  It was literally paintful getting through every bite.  The sodium, then spicy, then sodium again -- one punch after another. No frigggin relief.  Don't get me wrong - I live for spicy food. But a great meal is about a plan, a strategy, a complementary pairing -- not just THROWING TOGETHER THE SALTIEST AND SPICEST INGREDIENTS YOU GOT.  And the noodles. Oh how sub-par they were. These noodles are supposed to be al dente and chewy.  That's the beauty of these noodles.  MCF's noodles were overcooked and mushy.  Maybe if MCF focused on bettering their flavors would this dish actually work!\n\nAnd I have no comment on the salted cod fried rice. Its sodium content was probably through the roof too. But it was one of the last dishes that came, and by then my mouth was starved for something bland that the rice did just the job. So it tasted like plain white rice to me.

Everything is covered in the same mixture: sliced garlic, julienned chili peppers, green onion, peppercorn, peanuts all tied together with some slightly thickened soy/oyster sauce.  Two of the dishes I got were covered in this mixture.  For example, my beef dish was 10% beef and 90% of the mixture.   You really have to dig through this mixture to find the meat in your dish. There is really only so much of this mix that you can eat and it makes the dishes taste one-dimensional. \n2.  I ordered beef noodle soup b/c I saw a guy in the corner of the restaurant making them. The texture of the noodles I got was ok but again the flavor of the beef soup was mediocre. The beef chunks were not cooked long enough so they were not tender enough.\n3.  I ordered the dumplings b/c I saw the guy making them. Dumpling skin was too thick and filling was not unctuous enough.\n4.  Also tried the steamed egg custard with uni and trout roe. The texture was unpalatable--everything was soft and slightly slimy.", "author": "Karen C."}

There were a lot of flavors you can't find at other run-of-the-mill Chinese places (hua jiao, what what!). One warning though, if you don't like fatty meat this place probably isn't for you. Not to say you shouldn't try it; I used to be a lean-meat only kind of guy too, but once you get past the initial texture, fat can be super delicious if it's done right.\n\nI noticed there seems to be some confusion over whether this is \"real\" Chinese food. Chinese cuisine varies widely from region to region; the kind of bland food you get in Shanghai is vastly different from the hearty lamby goodness you can get in Beijing (yes, I am biased towards Northern food). Food in Sichuan is even more different and has a lot of \"Sichuan Peppercorn\" in it. That's the stuff that makes Mission Chinese food's tingly lamb soup tingly. \n\nThat said, Mission Chinese food has created a menu with traditional foods from many different regions of China. Ma po dofu hails from Sichuan, Cumin lamb and tingly lamb soup live in the North and Hainan Chicken is the national dish of Singapore. I can't personally speak to how \"traditional\" the flavors were in all the dishes on the menu, but I can tell you that the broth in the tingly lamb soup tastes almost exactly like the broth from a famous beef noodle soup place in Taiwan. The meat is fatty and tender, but not grisly and the noodles look fresh and are probably made somewhere close by (they don't have the smooth look of machine-made noodles).  In addition to the soup, I had the beef cheek--not something I ever saw on a menu in China, but it wasn't far from some other things I had in Beijing. It was scrumptious, too.\n\nIn short this place is uber good and has a really diverse menu with a lot of dishes that are hard to find other places in SF.", "author": "Jacob G."}

The Thrice Cooked Pork had a nice variety of ingredients such as bitter melon and tofy skin. It was spicy and had that tingly, slightly citrus flavor you get from Szechuan peppercorns. It reminded me of a similar dish at Momofuku Ssaam Bar. The Szechuan were pickles also quite tasty. Kind of like Kim Chee, but with some roasted peanuts. The Tiger Salad was a miss. Too raw and stemmy. The Salt Cod Fried Rice was ok, but a bit of a misnomer. Salt cod reconstituted dried cod, so it's is dense and very fishy. Here the cod was fresh and bit bland. The slices of Chinese sausage could have saved the day, but they were paper thin and hard to discern.\nService: Friendly service. Very prompt. All dishes came out around the same time.\nAmbiance: Better than I thought. Death Cab for Cutie and Built To Spill wafting through the air. Kind of like Minako in a way.\nPrice: 3 dishes, the pickles and one beer = $38 A decent of amount of food for that price.\n\nOverall: What I liked, I like a lot.

There are 27 dishes so there's guaranteed to be something of your liking for you and your group.  Though I'd never try and come here with more than 4 people.  Food is excellent and in many cases indescribably good.  If you like Chinese food this place kicks it up a notch and slightly sideways.  To understand that you really just have to try it.  A great place for people who aren't that adventureous but want to start. From Sea Urchin, to Oxtail, to Tounge he has dishes featuring those and other non-standard things that anyone (and I do mean anyone) can enjoy.  Prices for food this well done are very reasonable.

It was cute, my first bite I thought hmm this tastes so different, and I kind of liked it. By my second piece, I didn't like it anymore. Too weird for me. Roomie didn't like it on the first go, and we ended up throwing it out. We also got the thrice cooked bacon. It had a very smoky flavor, which was the worst part of the dish. I still liked it, roomie was sort of teetering between liking and disliking. We also had the ma po tofu, which was pretty much a soup. It is a little spicy but not very spicy like the 2 spicy on the menu makes you think of (oh and the bacon one wasn't spicy at all). We both liked this dish, I think it was yummy! Best dish of the meal! Lastly, we had salt cod fried rice, which we both liked and finished right up. For the two of us, there was a little left over, not enough for another meal, and the price was around $50. Roomie said he'd probably not eat here again.

You can write an arrow next to your name, go off for a drink during the wait, and if they call your name and you're not back, they won't knock your name off the list. Inside, the decor is awesome. Dragons, lanterns, paintings and blacklights. And club music. Dark and loud and hip. For food, we ordered the appetizer of pickles, which took maybe 30 seconds to get to our table, even with the place as busy as a restaurant can get. It was salty, not as vinegar or acid heavy as I expected, but good. A little spicy. The peanuts in it were insanely amazing and the cabbage wasn't bitter. Then came the Pork Belly. Can you say AMAZING?! 4 pieces, each the size of a large egg, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Literally, nothing has ever melted in my mouth quite like that. You need to be OK with pork fat (who isn't?) because I would say it's 50% or more fat, but it melts on your tongue is so soft. And the plum sauce is great. Last up was the Thrice Cooked Bacon. HUGE plate of thick, fatty bacon, onions, hot peppers, rice cakes (think scalloped potatoes) and an amazing sauce that words cannot describe. It is salty, but not in a bad way. But the SPICE. Oh, lord. I can handle a LOT of spice, but that was A LOT. My lips hurt. My forehead sweat. My voice stopped working. My eyes burnt. My mouth screamed for mercy. But the taste defeated all the pain and I ate, and ate, and ate some more until I think I was numb. My boyfriend, poor soul, can handle a lot less spice than I, and he was near death by bite 5. But, alas, the taste overwhelmed and he kept eating. And drinking water. It was amazing, but please be warned. That is HOT. We think it's a good deal for the money and worth the wait, on occasion. If you're adventurous is your tastes and spice acceptance. I recommend.", "author": "Dallas K."}

The fact that Alan Richman wrote that the brisket and egg custard were one of the top ten dishes in San Francisco is laughable and probably the last time I'll take anything he says seriously. The food is just fine but it just appears disorganized, incoherent and at times tasteless. Some people say that it shouldn't be judged against real Chinese food rather comparing it to an Americanized version. That's fine but even then it doesn't measure up to the pletheora of five star ratings. If you looking for great Chinese food, Americanized Chinese food, experimental American-Chinese food, or whatever people call it this place is unlikely to satisfy. A good variety of dishes were sampled: cold sesame noodles, egg custard, char siu pork belly, lion's head meatball, Mongolian Onglet, salt & pepper shrimp, bok choy, and bbq platter so it's not just one bad dish that I had.", "author": "Procter F."}

Net chicken wings. I am a wimp when it comes to spicy but they were fried so perfectly and so yummy I couldn't stop eating them.  On to the lamb soup. I love lamb and this soup was delicious. So unique were the favors like nothing I've ever had in a Chinese restaurant. Last was the pork belly.  Pork belly is everywhere and even though I love it I'm kind of over it but with that said I ordered it anyway and am I happy I did.  The crispness of the belly along with the sweetness of the pineapple was a great combination.  Is this place regular Chinese NO and I'm so glad it's not.  You can get that anywhere, this is new and different and wonderful.  Usually I don't care about service for me its all about the food but today I compliment the service.  It's was friendly and fun.

Described as \"Americanized Oriental Food\", don't expect typical dishes like Beef Broccoli and Kung Pao Chicken. Instead, there's Broccoli Beef Cheek and Kung Pao Pastrami, which is my personal fave! The pastrami in this dish is smoky and tender, absorbing lots of the chili flavor. Their spicy dishes are absolutely spicy! Thrice Cooked Bacon and Mongolian Long Beans are other fave spicy dishes. To cut through the spice, add the Cold Dan Dan Noodles, Westlake Rice Porridge, or Salt Cod Fried Rice- all delicate, greaseless, yet flavorful. I'm glad to know Mission Chinese Food extended their dining hours. To avoid the crowds, I suggest early afternoon (they open at 11:30am everyday, but closed on Wednesdays), however, Mission Chinese offers dinner hour (6pm) specials like house-made dumplings! Expect to spend $20-25 per person, which is pricey for \"Chinese food\", but keep in mind that a portion of sales benefit the San Francisco Food Bank. Delivery service is available, but wait time is about an hour. So if you can, definitely make a trip down to Mission Chinese Food!", "author": "Leroid D."}

This place is fun only because Danny B is not trying to be true to cuisine...his take on famous Cantonese fried rice dish is pure American by using salt cod instead of cured 'stinky' dried fish...the real pungent smell in front of those Stockton Street vendors is genius.  This is like what American Chinese was like 40 years ago with Moogugaipan (Mushroom Chicken) and Beef & Broccoli (his beef cheeks...) but now his take is far more adventurous!  So go there and please do not think this is great Chinese is not by a long shot as the technique and finesse is purely lacking but enjoy the spirit of his creation as it is something original by his own hand...whether true or not to pure Chinese cuisine, is not the point,  He is just doing his thing...don't believe me...watch him trying to pull noodles...hilarious and innocently beautiful as a child playing with ramen for the first time!", "author": "Gregory C."}

Flavorless and unsanitary conditions made it difficult to appreciate any creativity or locavore ingredients. I expected the dark, scruffy interior given it's pop-up history. The lack of cleanliness ruined appetite. The chipped plate did not seem washed completely with a black speck on it. When I walked thru kitchen to bathroom it looked messt and dirty, and it was not busy at all. Waitress sniffled and sneezed while taking order, wiping her nose. I often look beyond some sanitary violations for some kick ass authentic ethnic food. But this is eurocentric chinese with food stripped down to singular flavors, lacking intensity and meat-centric. No hot, salty, sour, sweet, or other flavor contrasts. Just mono-flavor or meat. Pepper greens w/ tofu skin& pumpkin sounded interested and the ingredients seemed very high quality, but it was served in flavorless broth tasted like nothing but peppers in hot water. I recall a chicken dish I had that tasted and looked like high quality chicken but was flavorless, no spices, nor any hint of the birds juices in the meat. Barely any chicken meat either. Salad of herb & lettuces was not dressed at all..just plain. It would have been a nice contrast on its own had other dishes been bolder. Creatively served summer roll style w/ rice paper. Recommend putting a sauce or dressing on side to dip in.  Did not have some or the star dishes that reviewers rave about, but if you can screw up the simple selections I'll pass.", "author": "Rafi C."}

I tried the saltcod fried rice - I found it tasty but not amazing as other reviewers seemed to find it.  The chinese sausage inside was a bit dry and while it was good, for me it didn't hold that \"crave\" factor that takes something from \"it was decent\" to \"I'll definitely be coming back for this one.\"  I got the szechuan pickles - honestly, not my thing, I was disappointed!  It was super oily, WAY too many peppers in there which were just taking up space and not enough actual pickles!  I liked the peanuts in it but overall, I would not get it again.  I ordered the famous ma po tofu.  Again, SUPER DUPER oily.  It was tasty but only order this if you're prepared to deal with mouth numbing heat (mostly I'm not - I like heat that gives a kick but doesn't numb you - perhaps I just can't handle Szechuan heat!) it takes away from enjoying the flavors.  I must say, the delivery man was topnotch - for him, I rate him 5 stars, I think his name was Lien?  Liang?

The first time, we had the Ma Po Tofu and a bunch of other dishes that I can't remember now.  I walked in with an open mind, understanding that this wasn't going to be traditional Chinese food.  The food is definitely a flavor bomb--in some ways good, but in many ways kind of terrible.  After our first visit, I remember thinking, \"Yeah, I wouldn't mind eating here again\".  But when we went our second time, the fried rice tasted old like it was made from frozen old rice and had been sitting out for a while.  The other dishes were also not good  and we were not impressed with our second visit at all.  I convinced myself that maybe they were just inconsistent or maybe we ordered the wrong things and that I should give it one more try.  Well, our last meal at Mission Chinese was today and it disappointed again.  We had the chongxiang wings which wasn't very spicy, but it left my entire tongue numb and I couldn't wait to go home to wash off the taste.  We also had the broccoli beef and the egg-egg noodle.  The broccoli beef was okay--the beef was very tender, but the flavor was off-putting and I couldn't finish much of it.  The egg-egg noodle was the best dish we had, but that's not saying much either.  I remember reading an article on the owner of the restaurant and he had said he wanted to make Chinese food because it's what he craves after a night of drinking.  Well, everything tastes good after a night of drinking except I'm pretty sure Mission Chinese would make my hang over feel worse.  So, I really don't understand why people love it here but my honest opinion is: it sucks for an \"Asian-inspired\" place and I wouldn't waste my money here again.", "author": "Trinh N."}

There has been so much hype and build up about this place and I was hoping that this place can deliver... figuratively speaking. I recently went here with seven of my closest friends to celebrate my birthday on a saturday night. I was concerned about the wait time due to the fact that there was eight of us and that it's a pretty small restaurant. They do not accept reservations, so first come first serve. We waited a little while, but no more than 15-20 minutes.  Or server was attentive and punctual. We all ordered an assortment of dishes so we could all share. I had to get my hands on the porridge and the salt cod fried rice! The porridge had light and delicate flavors and the addition of salted peanuts, served on the side enhanced my senses. The salt cod fried rice was very authentic. There was just the right among of salt in it.  You must try the lion's head meatball served with ramen noodles.  The meatballs are fork tender, ginger and green onions compliment the dish and tie the meatballs  together nicely. The main event of the evening came when the pork belly and kung pao corned beef arrived. The pork belly was sweet and salty, perfectly crispy on the outside, and molten hot like lava on the inside.  Flavors of star anise and cumin shine with every bite.   The corned beef which we were told, had been smoked for 12 hours. The attention to detail results in a dish both spicy and explosively flavorful. I was not disappointed, the hype is for real, chef Danny Bowien is for real. I can't wait to come back for another visit.", "author": "Jeff F."}

After a 15 minute wait at around 1:00 PM on a Saturday, our party of two was sat next to a large group. As in, directly next to them... at the same table. I think that's a little strange, but it can be overlooked for good food. It was also unfortunately humid in the dining area -- but not so humid we felt the need to leave. The menu is lacking some detail for me so I was wary about what to order but finally decided on the Kung Pao Pastrami. My boyfriend ordered the Smashed Cucumbers and Lamb Face Noodle Soup. Everything was just the right amount of greasy that you expect from Chinese-American food and was really tasty -- very inventive flavors! I was impressed. The reason this establishment is getting four instead of five stars is twofold: whomever made the food used just a hint too much chili oil *almost* overpowering the food and the service was subpar (again, another thing I can mostly overlook for good food).

The decor is basically an inside joke for a bunch of white hipsters making fun of the schlockier aspects of cheap Chinese joints. The servers were elderly Chinese women who looked clinically depressed from having to witness the atrocity being committed against Chinese cuisine.

How long ago were those noodles packed?!  I couldn't even eat the soup after.  What a waste...", "author": "MJ L."}

We found it in the marvelously tender Brisket with the Smoked Cola BBQ sauce. I was intrigued by the many parties who ordered the Veal Rib ($16) while we waited for 40 mins in the rain to get into this popular joint. It was moist on the inside, crusty on the outside, and smothered in a spicy sauce that my adventurous foodie uncle said was the \"hottest thing I've ever tasted.\"  (I thought it was very flavorful) We also enjoyed the very cumin-ly spiced Sizzling Lamb. The onions and Thai peppers combined nicely with the edgy spice, and were oishii! We also tried the Westlake rice porridge. While it had plenty of silky dungeness crab meat in it, along with ample minced cilantro, it was a bit saltier than I would've liked. This is the perfect food for a cold, rainy night in SF. The bottom line: I should have read more of the Yelp reviews to gauge the SPICY index. I liked the food, though my dining companions were less enthused. Very good service--very un-Chinese restaurant like!", "author": "Neal L."}

The food I would say is Chinese inspired, not authetic. And that's great, considering we have no dearth of Chinese restaurant in this town. The chef at MCF adds unusually touches to the dishes, and the result is totally delicious. I want to eat those soy cured eggs all day...I mean how does anyone braise the eggs with lots of flavor while still have the yolks ne runny? Mission impossible! But orgasmically delicious. And the pork belly is so good, and I happen to be a self proclaimed connoisseur of pork belly so I should know. The best dish is ma po tofu. Nothing like Mom used to make, but it's addictive like crack (which Mom also did not used to make). Skip the more subtle flavored dishes like congee (which is as good as I've had but nonetheless still subtle) and fried rice and go straight to spicy dishes like ma po tofu (my mouth is watering just thinking about it). That's where the chef shines. MCF is the future of Chinese Food.", "author": "Jason J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-05", "description": "good food but what's more amazing is the amount of effort the chefs put into it. it does remind me somewhat of momofuku although it's not quite on the par, yet (if it's up to me i'd say tune things down just a slight notch). when we were there we saw the way they were working on the dough, and it's clear they are putting heart and soul into it. keep it up.", "author": "shane y."}
