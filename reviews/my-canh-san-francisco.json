But, this restaurant was not a fit for me.\n\nI ordered the #23 - Special noodle soup, which is basically the typical combination pho with the rare steak, meatball, tripe, tendon, etc. I thought the broth was a bit too salty and had an odd aftertaste to it. The bean sprouts they gave me was a bit old & yellow and the lime was all dried up like it was cut open hours ago. The noodles and the meat were fine, but the old condiments kind of turned me off.\n\nI like how they're open late (till 2 AM) and they cater to the late night crowd. But if it's not too late yet in Chinatown, I'd recommend going to another place for pho.", "author": "Victor L."}

When we walked in, it was pretty empty and we took a seat near the back. I defaulted to the special noodle soup and glanced at the wall while we were waiting for the staff to take our orders. When we saw a picture of the beef carpaccio on the wall, we asked the staff how much it was since it wasn't on the menu. She seemed to hesitate a little before saying that it was $17. We decided to pass on that and my friend felt that she was making up the price on the spot. \n\nOur orders came out within five minutes, which was in my opinion pretty fast for pho. The special noodle soup came with the side of bean sprouts, basil leaves and a slice of lime. Upon closer inspection of the vegetables and the lime, it seems that they weren't fresh. The lime especially seemed pretty dried up. Basil leaves were slightly frayed with a shade of black. The pho was okay though, and I don't have much to say about it other than it wasn't bad. It was still pretty filling. All in all, it was alright.\n\nWhen we got the check, the staff loomed over us and it felt pretty awkward that she was standing over us while we were paying. I felt a bit annoyed by that since this was the first time that has happened to me and it was in poor taste in my opinion. If it was just the pho, I probably would have given this place a four. However, I'm taking off a star because of the vegetables and the other warning signs we spotted. Overall, would recommend this only if the other pho places in Chinatown are closed.", "author": "Nelson X."}

However, let skip over what ever reason behind that, I love their banh canh (\"udon\", for anyone who doesn't culturally appreciate). \n\nA very plus point for this very shady place is that the restroom is rather clean. I'm usually an anti-unisex restroom person because I disgust that guys don't aim right and splash all over the toilet seats (unless the restroom has a female and male stall). But seriously, although the restroom here is small, it is so clean. Unlike the Burger King I went to previously downtown near Macy's at Union Square. \n\nOk, let's go to the main point. The food. Banh canh here has the distinct Vietnamese orange color! I love that! It is not food coloring fyi, but annatto. Each bowl comes with a part of a crab.

This is my lowest rating to date for a restaurant.\n\nThis place was a hard 'meh' for me.\n\nFirst of all, yes, the place is extremely dingy, but I was willing to overlook that because 1) so are all the other places surrounding it and 2) there are some dingy restaurants everywhere that are absolute diamonds in the rough. \n\nMy Canh is not one of them. I ordered the crab and tomato soup and it was like vaguely crabby water. Imagine like a hot, crab flavored La Croix. The seafood mush on top was unappetizing and everything else was just too unmemorable to even describe. The fried wontons were like 98% fried air and 2% whatever meat mush was at the very bottom. Both dishes were edible, but not much more. \n\nHere's the thing though--this is definitely a drunk food restaurant. First, it's probably the cheapest food I've ever had (yes, cheaper than McDonalds) and it comes quickly. It's open until 2 am and I'd probably think it were good if it was 1:30 and I'd had 10 shots of tequila throughout the night. But barring that scenario, I wouldn't come here. I'd much rather pay more and have better food. \n\nOverall, I've been pleasantly surprised by most of the dirty, hole in the wall places I've been to in SF (even convenience stores in Bayview).

It is one of three restaurants on the same block that are open till 2 am (the other two being Sam's and Panuchos). I tried it out a couple of days ago when wanting something late at night. It is a pretty run-down place that definitely needs a good scrubbing but I guess most places in Chinatown would fall under this category.\n\nI decided to get the Chicken with lemongrass over rice ($7.95) to-go. Ordering was straight forward without issues and after ordering I waited for about 10 minutes at one of the tables while the cook rustled up my dish and I was on my way.\n\nI got a small size container with a lot of rice and a small amount of chicken fried with lemongrass and I mean a tiny amount. It obviously lacked the intense taste of lemongrass but I could pick up some lemongrass taste if I concentrated hard. The rice also could have been much better, it was at best passable. Overall pretty average.\n\nPrice wise it was pretty cheap with cost being under $10 for a fresh cooked meal. Obviously, it was cash only. The quantity of protein in this dish was enough for a late-night snack but it would be too little for a regular meal. I have to give them props for being open late and being cheap but that is balanced out by the dirty run-down nature of the place and the small serving size, so I'm going to have to go with an A-OK grade at-best.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

The chewy texture of the noodles in the thick, almost gravy-like soup....MM. So good. We were there in the afternoon, so i can only imagine how much more amazing this would be if I were half-drunk at 1AM. There were assorted pieces of pork belly and chunks of pork blood, as well as whole pieces of crab. My sister and I actually got too lazy to eat the crab...I know, we are trash.\n\nWe came for the noodles but the star of the show was definitely the bo tai chanh, which is the Vietnamese version of beef carpaccio. The tender, rare slices of beef are marinating in a tangy fish sauce/lime juice then topped with generous portions of chopped basil, fried shallots, crushed peanuts, and pickled onions. I was drinking that marinade. So fresh. So good. Perfect for a hot day. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Price -- \nThe crab udon and the bo tai chanh are off menu, so my sister and I had no idea how much it cost when we ordered them. We unexpectedly spent around $50 on two bowls of noodles and an appetizer. The $20 beef carpaccio was definitely worth it for me, but I don't know if I would pay $15 again for those noodles again.\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nIt's a hole in the wall Asian place so expect run of the mill Asian service. They brought tea, they brought the food, they brought the bill. \n\nBonus star because I would come back for the bo tai chanh!\n\nTL;DR: BEEF CARPACCIO YUM.

Then, I looked at the picture and tried to recall how it tasted, I realized a 1-star review would be more accurate. It's known to be a great place for late-night fix for for people who are munchy after clubbing or insomniacs that don't really care much about the quality of the food. All I tasted was (loaded) MSG and bad quality crab meat that were masked by the amount of alcohol in my body at the time I had it.

Given the fact it's their specialty, it only makes sense for me to order it for dinner.\n\nI've had banh canh cua before in other places and have a good idea on what to expect. Given the fact SF is famous for their seafood, I also had high expectations for their crab. Unfortunately for $13, I felt their product fell a bit short. While their crab meat, broth, and portions were very good, I felt the noodles were overcooked as they broke apart too easily. I'm used to the kind of banh canh that's chewy, and unfortunately I didn't get that from this place.\n\nService was very good for an Asian restaurant; I actually felt I got very good treatment while eating here. Unfortunately it probably won't be a place I'll revisit again.\n\nCash only!", "author": "Calvin S."}

It looked like any other hole-in-the-wall restaurant located in Chinatown and never really intrigued me. After an eventful night in the North Beach area, I was surprised to find this spot open and decided to give it a try.\n\nI've had their pho and bun bo hue with both being mediocre at best. Even being slightly inebriated and famished didn't make those dishes palatable. However, a friend raved about their crab udon and highly recommended it. Reluctantly, I found myself here recently after a night in the area and decided to give it another try. I could not find their crab udon on the menu, but the staff knew exactly what I meant when I ordered it. What I received was a very pleasant surprise: a bowl of udon noodles, crab, pork, and pork blood. However, the highlight of this meal was the delicious broth. It had the same viscosity of eggflower or hot and sour soup but the flavors were complex and full of umami goodness. I don't always drink the soup but this was too good to waste.\n\nIf this review was only for the crab udon, My Canh would get a solid 4 in my book. While delicious, it was a small bowl and there wasn't much. Also, unlisted was the price, which was 13 before tax and can come at a surprise, especially for those who only carry cards (cash only here). In my opinion, I would have excluded the crab and put more of everything else, especially that broth. Since this review is for the restaurant and not just one item, it's a 3 because everything else I've tried is a 1 or 2 (not good even when drunk). I've read good things about their beef carpaccio, so I may try that if I'm in the area again. To summarize: the only thing they should serve is their crab udon.", "author": "Philip W."}

It opens til late night, it says 2 am on Yelp, but I've come passed that and was still seated. Especially after the club or bar, perfect way to end the night or sober up to get home!\n\nThey're a family owned pho restaurant that's open everyday almost all day. Mad props to the workers/owners for the long work hours.\n\nIt's right on Broadway right after the Stockton tunnel. All parking is metered street parking, but late night there's no worries. Just make sure you watch out for street cleaning. From experience, I've gotten a street cleaning ticket, $65 :(.\n\nThey're not very big, they have 2 larger round tables and others seat 4-5 people. The later you come, there's a chance you'll have to wait. Very popular late night on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nI always order their #21, Banh Canh Cua, crab noodle soup. Now I've definitely had better banh canh, but not in SF and especially not late night. The crab noodle soup is thick with udon noodles. It comes with coagulated pork blood, slices of pork, and pieces of dungeoness crab. The soup always comes out piping hot that's rich and tasty. Their udon is always cooked perfectly too. It's seasonal so it can range from $10-12 depending on the price of crab.\n\nI've had their Bun Bo Hue, it's ok not really your traditional BBH. Their pho is average too.\n\nTheir fried imperial rolls Cha Gio are also really good. Their not tiny, they definitely don't jip you with some tiny a** pieces. They also come out freshly fried and piping hot. I couldn't even hold it with my hands. It's stuffed with filling with a nice light cripsy and flaky crust. Delicious. I've never had imperial rolls like theirs.\n\nTheir beef carpaccio (Bo Tai Chanh) is also pretty memorable. They make theirs slightly different, but it's delicious with a combination of flavors and textures in each bite. It is on the pricier end for an appetizer, if I remember correctly it's around $12.\n\nTheir price is average, but cash only. There's a few banks nearby like Chase and Wells Fargo.\n\nI can almost guarantee you've had or will have better pho/viet food, but it's hard to find any that open this late.\n\nLet's talk about their service. They seat you, take your order, bring out your food, and clean up. When you request for something, sometimes they ignore you. Most of the time they act like the ignore you but they bring it out shortly. Sometimes it takes more than one try to ask. Conclusion, their service is pretty bad. But surprise for a pho restaurant? not really. I can see that some people see them as rude. I've been accustomed to this kind of service from pho restaurants.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

To me it was just a regular bowl of soup. \n\nThe bowl is not pleasing to the eye and we all know that you eat with your eyes first! First sip of the soup and it was very slimy! It's a lot thicker than what I'm used too and the slimy texture does not help. I think it lacked some seasoning because I had to squeeze in three pieces of lime. \n\nLooking at the bowl there was a lot of crab! Which is good for the price! But some of the crab tastes like plastic! So I basically discarded those and only ate the udon noodles. \n\nI added a star to this place because of how nice the owners were.

I accidently reviewed Vietnam restaurant when it was really My Canh.\n\nTLDR; Bland Bo Hue. \n\nHELLA bland Bun Bo Hue (how is that even possible?!)\n\nLemme explain.\n\nI work in the area and often frequent Pho Vung Tau for my Vietnamese fix (see: hungover). After a quick HH while waiting for traffic to die down, we were feeling adventurous and wanting soup to wash down those tasty libations; A quick yelp search directed us here, and boy, were we in for it.\n\nMTL opted for the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong with extra \"homemade\" fish sauce (nuc mam)..... for my fellow mi trang, it's basically a vermicelli noodle bowl with imperial rolls and slices of grilled pork. Honestly, it was pretty good.... But in my defense, it's hard to mess this up (especially with extra nuc mam (NADDA MEAN? FOSHO). Serving size was large and had a good amount of meat at $7.00.\n\nHowever, I decided to be daring and get their bun bo hue considering MOST reviewers raved about their soup. BAD. I mean.... The noodles were good and the meat was plentiful, but the broth was just BLAND. Hell, when I want bun bo hue, I want one hand on the chopsticks and one hand on a napkin keeping sweat from dripping into my bowl. This honestly taste like water with noodles.... I've had nongshim bowl noodles for $1.29 that tastes better AND has more flavor. Hands down, the worst BBH I've ever had.\n\nThe interior was pretty run down (messy tables, flies everywhere, a string held the bathroom door open). While you'd expect this to be \"standard Chinatown\" ambiance, they should know that Pho Vung Tau around the corner is EXTREMELY clean with prompt service. Oh, did I mention better BBH!? Know your competition, people. At $20 out the door, it really wasn't that inexpensive for what it was.... But hey, at least it was a sobering ride home!\n\nI don't think I'd give them another shot.

I had been there as a child way back in the day before the war got very bad. It was a floating restaurant, floating on the Saigon river, and before and during the Vietnam war, was a popular place for Foreigners and Americans to dine. It was blown up in 1965 with two bombs, killing 42 people. \n\nThis My Canh is a simple diner with a greasy feel, but with good tasting food. They are best known for perhaps 2 dishes, their Banh Canh Cua (Crab soup) and Bo Tai Chanh (Beef Carpaccio with lemons). But their Pho broth is deep, complex and delicious, and clear, with the flavor of beef embued over time, not with shortcuts. \n\nIt is very good drunk food, being here near the nightlife, and it is hard to find a seat after midnight, when their rush hour begins. But it is also good sober food, despite the divey atmosphere. \n\nI have been here twice. Once, late at night with my good Vietnamese friend, who knows the staff and introduced me to the Bo Tai Chanh, which I had never had before.

Golden King on Clay has been my go-to place but today, just as I was going to go there, I realize I should give My Canh a try.

The Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong (BBQ Pork & Imperial Roll dry vermicelli)  ($7.50) was pretty good. Compared to Golden King, the imperial rolls are much crispier on the outside and the filling more flavorful. The filling also doesn't have that overwhelming fish-sauce taste. Pork is BBQ to perfection but I wish it has more crusty charred edges. It certainly hit the spot.\n\nNote to self: Imperial roll here is tastier than that of Golden King (Clay/Grant), Cordon Bleu (California/Polk), but not as good as Thanh Tam II (Valencia/17th).\n\nCash only.

We arrived a little before 2 AM and snagged the last available table in the back. (Closes at 3 AM on weekends.)\n\nThis was my first time at My Cahn and I know they're known for their Bo Tai Chanh (Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio) and Banh Canh Cua (Vietnamese Crab Soup w/ Udon Noodles). However, I had to settle with a rice dish because I was a bit nauseous to want to try the BTC and wouldn't be able to handle the MSG in the BCC. Even though I didn't order their signature dishes, the food at My Cahn is mediocre at best and the bulk of its business is from satiating the appetites of the drunken North Beach party goers. \n\nMy friends and I started with the Cha Gio - Vietnamese Spring Rolls which were good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZBX6HhQWZse0KJ_wPtIFAw?select=gpQprSUnuyzuPE8SIMae3g\n\nThe spring rolls were crunchy crust with a flaky cracker-like crust. It was generously filled with a pork and taro mixture that was savory. Parts of the spring roll were burnt, so it did leave a lingering charcoal-like flavor in my mouth. \n\nI ordered the Com Bi Thit Nuong - BBQ Pork Over Rice w/ Shredded Pork Skin. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZBX6HhQWZse0KJ_wPtIFAw?select=chie-P81M5HpIG0vf1cahA\n \nIn order to enjoy the dish, I think I would have to been completely drunk. The beef was chewy and bland. Other then the grill marks that added a smoky flavor, it was oily and tasteless. The pork skin & meat was missing that gelatinous and grainy texture and I literally had to bathe the meats in the nuoc cham (Vietnamese Chili Garlic Fish Sauce) to give it some moistness and flavor. Also, the rice didn't taste fresh; it was dry and hard. \n\nInattentive service is a given for most Asian hole-in-the-places, but our waiter had a stick implanted so far up into his a$$ that it gave him a permanent sour face. The constant eye rolling and disinterest in being there created a very cold and uninviting environment.

So we can see the stacks of sack of rice oh and a sack of Monosodium Glutamanate (MSG!!!). Now I\"m not doubting that most Asian restaurants don't use MSG, but don't make it so obvious. To be fair most people I know who stay away from MSG still don't know what it stands for and the bag did have it all written out. \n\nThen there was one worker just sitting at the table doing her thing like cutting vegetable because there must not be enough room in the back. Normally I don't mind it because that just means they can keep an eye on you and make sure you are taken care of while still getting important stuff outta the way. Only problem was, she wasn't keeping an eye on us so the service wasn't good and it was a little awkward watching someone cutting veggies haha. \n\nAgain we came in an awkward hour so there was hardly anyone there, but still no reason for the service to be bad.

It was also salty because of the crab paste. The dish is an acquired taste if you're not used to it. I suggest adding copious amounts of chili pepper and lemon to offset the saltiness.\n\nThis spot also carry other popular items (e.g., the pho was so-so, the bun rieu is much better, the rice plates were so-so, etc.). They have coconut water in coconut shell or in a can. And, I always try to grab a red-bean in coconut milk dessert drink to-go.\n\nPay them a visit not because of high quality VNese foods (2-star food if daytime, 3-star food if late at night), but because they open late-nights, and can fit a group in.\n\nThe place seems unkempt but that's an atmosphere requirement for late-nights grub.", "author": "Peter L."}

We walked up and down Broadway a few times, looking at the Canto spots and the Viet spots, but I wasn't in the mood for Canto flavors and I was little unsure about the homeless man in front of one Viet place and the near-zilch seating in the other Viet place. Finally, we came into My Canh and sat ourselves in the back by the drinks fridge and hoped for the best.  \n\nLet's just say that the whole experience reminded me of the joy being a teenager in NYC Chinatown in the 1990s.  Beautiful Viet-American girls with bleached hair and cute makeup weaved in and out of English and Vietnamese as they talked about everything from hair to boys, while chowing down.  And old dude in the corner slurped up his noodle soup just as it was his right to enjoy every morsel.  And then there was us, me with a chip on my shoulder of bygone NYC Chinatown and my husband who doesn't even really like Viet food.  Well suffice to say -- THANK YOU MY CANH for serving up toothsome beef-balls, al dente noodles, and a whole assortment of hot sauces and chiles to choose from!  And thank you for reminding me of pleasant times with old friends.\n\nFor reals though, not gonna lie, the regular bowl portion was not enough food for me.  I did end up going around the corner to Walgreen's for a Gatorade and across the street to VIP Cafe for a coconut filling bun.

The udon texture varies slightly as well. Overall, I have enjoyed the banh canh regardless and have been back multiple time since my last review.  Other than our usual orders for the banh canh cua, the hubby and I decided to get the egg rolls today for a change. I liked the egg rolls as they are very similar to my mom's (my mom's are still the best in my opinion). They also add some taro to the egg roll filling which I enjoyed. You get 3 egg rolls per order.

In many ways, this place became the inadvertent Yelp event away from the official one.\n\nI felt like a new customer again as I couldn't remember their menu, but their pho and rich arrays of dishes are still some of the most affordable you can find in California. Cassie and I shared an order of egg rolls ($5.25) and I also had a bowl of pho with tendon ($6.50). The egg roll tasted like it had been refried with a unsettling texture but the interior was deliciously filled with ground pork and taro. The presence of taro was strong and flavorful but I also wished the depth of the fish sauce for dipping could be a little stronger. My bowl of pho came in a bowl big enough for a steaming facial. The broth was pretty good with large pieces of slippery tendon that were very tasty. I only wished the noodles could be slightly firmer and beef could come medium rare atop of the soup. It was still very comforting and delicious nonetheless. Servings are small compared to other pho places and it was good enough to get me full.\n\nService was very friendly, responsive and expedient. They told us that they were opening till 3am that night and this certainly position them to be a top late night eateries in San Francisco.

I have searched and tasted so many different restaurant's banh canh cua in San Jose area, but nothing was as comparable to theirs. The banh canh cua is the Vietnamese udon noodle soup. It's thick noodle soup but not only is the noodle thick but the soup is  thick as well with great flavors. In the soup there are pork meat, pork blood, crab(yummy), fried onions with green onions, and a few more but I can't recollect the exact details.They have a slice of lemon on the side for you to squeeze it in. The soup is already so very tasty, but the lemon juice really enhances the flavor to the max level. Just thinking about it makes me drool. I want to drive to SF right now and get myself some banh canh cua. Not only do I eat the noodle soup there at the restaurant, but I also togo two of them home. Yes, 2 orders.

I would say its not that authentic but it's good enough for me to not drive to San Jose for a bowl. This bowl of spicy noodle soup will work for me. I had their beef carpaccio and to be honest, it was amazing before but they cut their meat a lot thicker now so its pretty tough to chew and swallow. If it was thinner, then it'll be a very delicious dish.  Their regular noodle soup hits the spot after a night of clubbing and drinking.  But.....be sure to drink a lot of water because I woke up with a dry mouth. Hydrate please! A lot of MSG in their food but still an awesome place for a quick pho fix late at night.", "author": "Irene L."}

The food at My Cahn reminds me of the typical place most people would eat. Not excessive or fancy, but a good meal and enough flavor to make it enjoyable. Also, healthy because there are none of the typical\"excessiveness.\" In both Hanoi and HCMC, one can find fancy foods with fancy sauces and spices, but that isn't where \"the people\" eat.  My Cahn is typical, especially the various Pho's. \n   Beyond the flavor the service is friendly, helpful, but there is a very slight language struggle...but it is no problem. The setting is a bit untidy, but that is no problem either.  If you want fancy-fancy, go a block away into North Beach. If you just want a nice VN meal, enjoy it here. Healthy?

This place is a hole in the wall, so it might be a bit difficult trying to find it the first time. \n\nThe restaurant is also kind of worn and could use some aesthetic improvements, but so do most places in this area of the city. \n\nThis restaurant is known for the banh canh cua, which is a kind of noodle soup dish that has Vietnamese udon, pork blood cubes, dungeness crab, and other goodies in it. It was divine here. The broth is so sweet from the crab and seafood -- the broth is also very sweet and kind of has a light viscosity to it that I find very appealing. It was more than a broth but much less than a chowder. \n\nI usually don't like soup-y foods too much, and I never can finish a whole bowl of pho (even the small portion), and I gobbled up the whole thing -- broth and all -- here. \n\nSqueezing a bit of fresh lemon or lime juice on the hot bowl of banh canh cua with a few squirts of sriracha make this dish absolutely heavenly. \n\nSan Francisco is known for dungeness crab, so be sure to try this place out!\n\nTIP: They do use fresh crab, so it's best to come here during dungeness crab season. Otherwise, most likely, the smaller less flavorful red crabs will be used in the banh canh, and it is not as delicious. If you're a crab fanatic, this will be of utmost importance! \n\nEnjoy! I crave this food on cold winter nights. So good.", "author": "Anh D."}

They humiliated me in front of whole bunch of customers by shouting at me telling me \"You don't want to eat then get the hell out!\"\n\nOK this is what happened.  You be the judge.  I went to this restaurant late at night.  It was not a busy night.  Just few tables.  I was hungry so I ordered an extra large bowl of number one beef noodle soup.  Then they brought out this very tiny bowl of soup.  Then a large group of young kids came in.  They were about to order.  Then I called the waitor and said \"Excuse me sir.  I order an extra large bowl.  You gave me the wrong size .\" This bowl is so small its for ripping of tourists.  I am not a tourist.  I eat at Vietnamese foods all the time.  And they charge almost $9 for a X large bowl.  Then waitor and the owner both ignored me.  Then I kept complaining about how small your extra large bowl is.  I am not a stupid tourist who will pay $9 for this tiny bowl.  Then one of the owners got angry and came toward me with an empty bowl and loudly said \"Look!  This is our medium size bowl.  You compare it yourself!  Your bowl is so much bigger!\"  I said \"Oh yeah?\"  And I just poured my entire soup noodle which I never had a single bite into that medium size bowl she brought.  And guess what?  The entire content did not even reach the top of that bowl.  It's like one full inch below the top.  This shows that my bowl is even smaller than their medium size bowl because the soup reached the top of my  bowl.  Then I spoke out loud since that woman spoke to me very loud.  I said \"You see?  Your medium size bowl is way bigger than my bowl.  So this is not the extra large bowl I ordered is it?\"  Then she got embarrassed and immediately yelled at me and said \"OK you don't want to eat then you get out!\"  All those other young kid customers were laughing and as I walked out I heard these young kids placing their orders.   One kid said he wants a medium size bowl of some soup.  Then another kid also said he wants just a medium size of some noodle soup.  Then another said \"Excuse me.  I want to cancel my large size soup noodle and just go for the medium size.\"   Nobody dared to order their X large bowl anymore after what they saw.  Terrible service.  Very unfair and shady.  Maybe they never saw me before so they figure its okay to give me a tourist treatment.  But actually I ate their before several times but not very often.  Or maybe they did not have enough soup that night.  What ever the deal is I am writing them up on Yelp.\n\nOh yeah I just remembered something.  Much earlier, maybe 4 years ago me and my friend were eating at this same restaurant and it was Chinese new year eve.  That same waitor who gave me the tiny bowl of X large soup opened the front glass door and starting blowing up those Chinese red fire crackers that are linked together in a long chain.  The door was opened and he blew them up only like 12 feet away from our table. It was so loud it was breaking our ear drums.  Both me and my friend told him to stop blowing it up.  But that waitor totally ignored our request and just kept blowing up that chain of fire crackers.  We kept telling him to stop or at least shut the door for us and blow it outside.  But he simply pretended that he did not hear us.  Then after like a minute the fire crackers stopped popping.  Finally we can take our fingers out of our ears.  Then guess what?  This waitor took out another round of fire crackers and blew them up at the door.  Pop Pop Pop!  None stop.

Inside it's a hole-in-the-wall feel with 4-5 tables along a wall with the kitchen to the right.

Had to yell to get my check.\n\nThe banh canh itself was fairly solid, at the upper end of the price range at $9.50/bowl (market price) The soup was flavorful and thick, and contained various bits of pork and pieces of crab. I like the fact the crab is in the shell, but it makes the banh canh a bit harder to eat, and less enjoyable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-21", "description": "For a metropolitan city, San Francisco doesn't have a lot of late-night eateries, at least compared to Los Angeles and New York City.  We have Mel's (which sucks) and a couple of Korean restaurants (also not very good) - and a couple others but one would have to be completely PLASTERED and needing to eat out of necessity to enjoy the food.\n\nThere are two late-night restaurants that I do frequent where the food is basically pretty good.  Both happen to be in North Beach - which is one area in which I rarely hang out at night, so it's a bit inconvenient.  But this is Grace talking - - where won't I drive to for food?  \n\nThe first place is Yuet Lee, which offers some impressive Chinese food at an even more impressively cheap price.  In fact, this was the only place I would frequent up to a couple of months ago.  But their soup selection is weak, and when you need some good soup, noodles and a whole lot of MSG - you need \"Pho\".\n\nFor late-night Pho, My Canh is a great place.\nThe pho is pretty good. I'd give it a good 3-stars.  They give you a decent amount of meat, the noodles are cooked right, and the broth is good enough.  This is not Pho that will knock your socks off but at 1 AM - like I said, your choices are pretty meager. It will warm your tummy and at least make you feel better in the morning.\n\nIf you order their \"raw beef\" - they give you an amazing dish of flavors, piled high on their thin slivers of raw beef.  It's not on the menu - you have to ask. Even if you have reservations about raw beef - go try this.  It really is delicious.  I have to give this dish 5-stars.\n\nHaving been to My Canh now about 8 times in the last couple of months, their service is pretty consistently friendly.  They are accomodating in that I usually end up taking a group of 7+, and it's been as many as 12 people, and they will arrange the tables for you, move chairs, etc.\n\nIt's rather grungy in here, and I have to wonder about how sanitary the kitchen is.  But you know, when I am hungry and it's 2 AM, who really cares?  If it won't kill me, it's basically good enough for me.  If I can eat a plate of raw meat w/ lemon juice here and live to tell about it - it won't kill you.  (Well, unless it does, I guess -  which would be sad but how could I have known?)  There is one bathroom.  That, too, is grungy, but again - after a night of drinking, you really won't care too much.  I will say I have never seen so much Costco toilet paper in one place, piled all the way up to reach the ceiling.\n\nFor very good Pho, I still have to head to Pho Vietnam on Polk (which, so far, is the best I have found in San Francisco).  But serving good Pho there is really irrelevant when it's 1 AM and they close at 10 pm.  \n\nSo, when you're well into the night and you have the Asian affliction of needing SOUP after drinking - - My Canh is a good choice.  \n\nNote:  Pho Saigon is right next door - and  there IS a difference so be careful which door you walk into when you're stumbling about looking for this place.", "author": "Grace K."}

Apparently it's one of the most ordered dishes there.  Not necessarily the best Banh Canh Cua around, but perhaps the best in SF  under $10 after hours.\n\nThe place is normally overflowed after 2pm in weekends as clubbers need to recharge their engergy after dancing, courting or whatever...  I once wait for 45 mins to get to the table and another 45 mins to get a bowl of Banh Canh Cua that shrinks in content (the bowl is still the same size) in comparision to one I'd get in some earlier evenings.  And there's still a line outside.  It is around 3am.\n\nBeing so frequent there, servers and chef assistants and chefs know us by name.  They tell us \"don't come here late in weekends, it's over crowded.\"  They actually add more crabs and noodle to the serving to make up the last time that they... shrink the bowl of Banh Canh Cua during rush hours.  8-)  The gesture is kinda cute!\n\nIt's definitely not a place u find the best ambiance, or the finest dining experience.  But for sure it's a place where u can get some good food cheap.  And remember, don't come after hours in weekends.", "author": "QC P."}

I ignored it the first three times because I understood that they were busy, and for as busy as it was the wait was understandable......\n\nLast night, blunt number 2 and feeling hungry but not at all interested in the food the bar we were headed to had to offer, Chong vehemently insisted we get coconut curry with tofu & vegetables, her new alleged favorite dish. We get there and to our glee it's not as packed as usual and we sit at one of the four open tables. We wait about 15 minutes til the server finally took our order. 30 minutes and 3 new parties later..... our conversation turned into a struggle to keep our mind off the ridiculously long wait. We ordered spring rolls and coconut curry, a vegetarian dish that's usually on our table within ten minutes... but for some reason the past 3 visits, it's taken 20 [on this particular visit 30]. Chong was not pleased she felt like we were being ignored on purpose. I felt the same and she took note that the newer parties got their food before us. I have to tell you how hungry we were, I started eating the Nuoc Leo [peanut based dipping sauce] and mixing it with the chili and tasting it. Cheech & Chong were eating the condiments.... \n\nThe food was good, there's no arguing that aspect, ever. But My Canh needs to return to how it was before, disposed to treat guests with cordiality. \n\nChong gasped and looked at me when the bill came \"Oh no I only have exact change...not enough for tip :( I'm so disheartened*sarcasm*\" Not at all unfair in my opinion considering I don't get tipped as a server when I take a long time.", "author": "Myrtle M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-11", "description": "There are 3 categories of cheap in my world: cheap, dirt cheap, and well... dirty cheap. Yes, dirty. And I don't mean that in a Christina Aguilera dirty way, I'm talking just plain flithy, smutty, moldy, there are enzymes growing in my water, dirty cheap. \n\nNow please forgive me for being a germaphobic princess, but hole in the walls have never been my cup of tea, especially when that's lukewarm tea they're serving you. I find comfort in sipping on a hot cup of tea while being able to reassure myself that the heat is burning any potential microbe that could possibly be swimming in my cup. However, My Canh shunned any hopes for germaphobic reassurance. As I entered the smutty looking restaurant, the wooden panels plastered on the wall left me displeased with their choice of decor and their exposed refrigerator filled with vegetables in pink plastic bags scattered next to soda cans left me feeling a little uneasy. The communal utensil container expedited my dormant anxiety as I reached over to grab a fork. I found myself touching not just one, but the other five surrounding forks that stood next to my chosen fork. A sudden make believe scene flashed within my head of past customers with filthy unwashed hands who reached for one fork but ended up contaminating the innocent forks that were to be left for the next guests. I cried silently inside to myself as I wiped my chosen fork on my napkin.\n\nNow despite my lack of affinity towards My Canh's appearance and cleanliness, their food wasn't too bad. On a scale between decent and amazing, it fell somewhere short of great yet a little above good. Their menu had quite the selection, but my heart was set on getting late night pho. And not to mention, one of the main reasons we dipped into My Canh was the fact we got out of the gym around 10:30 and were craving for a mean lean bowl of late night pho past the regular restaurant hours (My Canh is opened until 2AM) The pho was fulfilling. It hit every bone in my body that was calling for a pho craving. The broth had enough flavor and sustenance to keep my tummy warm and happy for the rest of the night. I wasn't too happy with the appearance of their bean sprouts. Some stems looked rather brown and sooty so I had to meticulously pick which lucky sprouts I wanted in my soup. \n\nIt's hard to say if I would venture off to My Canh again. Although I was impressed with their extensive menu, tasty pho and accommodating hours, my germaphobic disposition can only endure so much smut in one sitting.", "author": "Ally C."}

I used to come here with an ex who would order everything in Chinese, which is a disadvantage if you're planning on ordering from the 'secret menu' and don't speak their native tongue or able to just point to pictures.

The beef is served raw, smothered in lime juice, cilantro, chopped peanuts, some chili, fried garlic and fish sauce. To many of you who may be discouraged by eating raw beef for fear of contamination, let it be known that e. coli lives in the intestines of the cow as well as yourself. Hamburger is where you would find traces of e.coli if any due to the fact that hamburger is pretty much different parts of the cow ground together. But the beef here is I think flank steak, sliced wafer thin. The acidity of the lime juice does its job to not only tenderize the meat even more but kill of trace bacteria. Chemistry and biology lesson aside, the beef was melt in your mouth tender and the combination of the add-ons just made the whole dish savory and delish. \n\nWe also got the banh xeo, which had a few pieces of shrimp, lots of bean sprouts, a few pieces of bacon all wrapped in a pancake/crepe batter. You can taste the coconut milk in the batter, and all in all it was pretty good but not anything super exciting. \n\nBanh Canh Cua was great! The soup comes nicely thickened from boiling the banh canh noodles in the broth. I think Banh Canh is made from tapioca flour so it naturally thickened up the flavorful broth. We asked them to shell the crab meat for us and there were about 3 crab legs worth of meat as well as a claw. There were also pieces of pork hock and the curdled pigs blood. Very good! Noodles were chewy and springy and I really liked the broth. A few squirts of Sriracha and I knew that this bowl of noodles would cure any hangover.", "author": "Derrick L."}

The best pho always seemed to be served by sort of sketchy-looking joints in back alleys or little stands squeezed between shops selling a mishmash of other stuff. My little hotel in Hanoi made a pretty good western style breakfast, but if I ordered pho instead, they would send a guy from the kitchen down the street to one of these places. He'd walk back in through the front door of the hotel, and put the outsourced pho down on my table.\r\n\r\nWhen I find myself near Broadway and Columbus in San Francisco, and I'm not down with Dim Sum or Italian food, a steaming bowl of pho at My Canh is a good option. When you walk into a Vietnamese restaurant, and it's full of Vietnamese people, you've probably made a good choice. Certainly true with regard to My Canh anyway.\r\n\r\nPho is one of those things - like pizza - that I could happily eat three times a day for the next ten years, and you can get it delicious and cheap at My Canh.", "author": "Shawn S."}

I can never convince anyone else that this place is worth a shot because, frankly, it's scary for most. When I first moved to SF, this place was quickly deemed a health hazard by my friends. Almost 5 years later, I'm still kicking and going back to this staple Broadway joint because, damn it, it's good. First off, Americans are spoiled whiny people. Grow up in Asia or anywhere else, and you'll know what I'm talking about. I mean, who cares if the pork chop you just ordered is caught in transit to the kitchen via a sliding bucket on the floor being kicked by a 4 foot tall Asian granny? It's going to be fried to oblivion so I'm sure all possible contagions are long gone by the time it ends up in your mouth. \n\nAnyway, my go to dish is the BBQ pork over rice WITH a fried egg (always got to keep it true to my roots and channel Filipino food combinations). It's hearty and just good. The vermicelli bowls are also great and the fried imperial rolls are the sh*t. I'm not a pho fan so no comment on that.

I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I have to consider the restaurant as a whole and not just for their food.\n\nThis place sits on the outskirts of Chinatown and when you walk inside, it's a very typical Chinatown restaurant.  Small, kinda dingy, hole in the wall sorta place, home to some of the best pho anywhere in the bay area (however, a VERY reliable source told me about a place in Oakland that's a notch up).  \n\nI've been here several times and I usually order the #19,  or #18.  I also add the Lemon Raw Beef (not on the menu) when I eat here with some friends.  It's 12 bucks but HELLA worth it!  It's superfantastic and the plate is enough for 3 people.  I have tried several other dishes, but the #19 and #18 are my favs.  The broth is savory and the noodles are perfect.  \n\nA couple of drawbacks are parking and the atmosphere.  Both are not very pleasant.  But hey, do you want good pho, or what?", "author": "Tom Y."}
