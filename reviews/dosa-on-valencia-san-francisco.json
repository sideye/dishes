My friends and I made a reservation for a Friday night and the place was packed - definitely shows how popular it is :)\n\nWe got the lamb dosa and chicken curry. The dosa was massive and just the right texture: crispy but soft, and sturdy enough to hold the fillings. The chicken thigh in the curry was really tender and the curry was flavorful without being too spicy. \n\nMy friends got some fancy cocktails that they enjoyed a lot, but I didn't order a drink so I'll take their word for it.

The caramelized onion uttapam was ok, I would not get it again. It had the same rich tomato sauce and mint chutney as the dosa, nothing else, and the bread part wasn't that good, it was just cooked dough with stuff inside it. \n\nNext time I would like to try the regular dosa masala, but the paper masala dosa was really good as well and I would be excited to get it again.

The menu has variety and its calld the Kerala Dinner. \n\nGrowing up in south india, i know how the food tastes. \nWhile the names on the menu looked familiar, the taste just did not. We ordered 5 items for the 3 of us cos we jus needed to get some great indian food as we drove all the way to SFO from LA. \n\nThe kerala fish fry costs $12 bucks and has 6 peices of some fish that was definitely not indian(0.5''x0.5'') placed on a yellow base with some fruit peices on it(my guess is Mango).\nThe dosa looked great but dint taste indian. The tomato chutney was jus plain tomato puree that you get in a store(tomato chutney is supposed to have alot more than jus tomatoes)and the coconut chutney was jus ground coconut. Both the chutneys desperately needed tempering. Kerala is the land of spices and i wished one of the items on this menu had them.\n\nThe food looked really nice and i found alot of non-indians liking it. Its because this was not INDIAN.\nI am not saying the food sucked. IT WASNT INDIAN OR MALAYALI CUISINE OR EVEN REMOTELY SOUTH INDIAN. \nThis is jus catering to the non-indians living in the area. I was fooled. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE INDIAN.\n\nRequest to the management- pls call your restaurant an INDIN FUSION restaurant. Tats appropriate. Sorry if i offended you.

We decided that everyone would order one plate (after a round of appetizers) and we would pass it around so people could try everything. When the dishes came I was surprised that there were so many dosas. I remember thinking that's weird that we all have the same tastes and got dosas. Well, hello, the name of this restaurant is Dosa because they specialize in dosas! I'm glad my husband wasn't there to witness that moment because I'd never live it down (although he sometimes reads my Yelp reviews, so if you're reading this, don't say anything).\n\nDigression aside, you really should order a dosa. That's what they are known for and they are delicious. If you see the pictures, you'll notice that they are huge! I looked at it and thought I can't eat it all. False! Since they are hollow on the inside other than the filling, you can eat it all if you truly believe! (Kidding aside, I found myself slightly on the fuller side of full by the end, but not uncomfortably so). \n\nWe started with the Dahi Vada, Lemon-Chile Scallops, Spiced Avocado Chaat (which we asked them to make not spicy so we nixed the habanero), and the Southern Samosas.  Everything was delicious and variety is the spice of life so I definitely suggest trying a bunch of appetizers! \n\nOut of all the entrees the three that stood out to me were the Organic Mushroom and Arugula Uttapam, the White Truffle Dosa (see a pattern? I'm a huge fan of truffle), and the Hyderabadi Lamp Chops. The lamb chops were so tender! I don't think you could go wrong with any type of dosa (I loved all the ones I tried), I'm just super partial to truffle oil!\n\nService was the only thing that was a bit of a con. It was super slow! We ended up going to pay at the counter because our waiter was taking too long to bring the check. He actually brought it after we already paid. \n\nTakeaway is if you need to get in and out then this may not be the best place, however, if you want a good meal and you have time to spare then I would suggest coming here! \n\nPro Tip: They take Yelp Reservation so you don't have to wait!", "author": "Christina G."}

Lucky for us, they take reservations. So we were seated immediately. We ordered a few cocktails, wine, and appetizers. The cocktails were delicious... but I usually am limited to very few of those with all the sweet/spicy/excess and go to an old favorite, craft beer. They had a very nice selection and I found one that I was digging.\n\nThe menu seems to have changed since I went, so some of the dishes are a little spotty. But for the apps that table shared, the samosas and scallops stood out. I kind of wish we had gotten three orders of EACH of those. Very tasty.\n\nWe also decided to do a big tasting of the entrees. Which obviously was not as easy as the appetizers. But a great way to taste a bunch of different things. I got one of the lamb curries and like with most lamb curries I have had at great Indian places, this was really good. But nothing more exceptional that I have had at some other Indian spots in San Francisco.\n\nAll in all a great experience. A perfect spot for our loud group since it was pretty loud in there overall. But not so much that you couldn't hear.

Haha but it was all good.\n\nI will go back and explore more their menu and drinks, because we only ordered plain water...\n\nIf you are new to Indian food, this is the place to go. Ask the staff and get ready for different flavors! We had a great experience I'm very happy that we found this place.", "author": "Bella C."}

It's weird that they charge extra for chutney but provide the popadums for free. This is like  providing the bread without olive oil or butter. \nI'm a die hard south Indian food lover and I've tasted several great restaurants outside India and Dosa stands as an average one in comparison. \n\nPS. Their reservation staff  (over the phone) can use some politeness especially when they are dealing with customers who are visiting from outside the city. They need to be a tiny bit flexible!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-21", "description": "Amazing combination of spices and flavors! Dosa represents contemporary Indian food at its best--there are a variety of creative small plates on the menu as well as larger curry plates, dosas, and uttapam! Everything here is delicious and there's a reason this cramped little restaurant in the Mission is so popular!\n\nWe started off with a couple of appetizers--the farmer's market salad was made with juicy chunks of heirloom tomatoes and donut peach, served over a nicely spiced turmeric raita. The avocado chaat with grapefruit and coconut had a surprising raw chile flavor from habaneros that really packed a punch! One of my favorite dishes of the night was the lamb kebab pav sliders--the lamb was so tender and it was served with a yogurt and red pepper chutney sauce that brought the whole sandwich together! The sliders were also surprisingly spicy, so do be warned--but the flavors were absolutely incredible.\n\nThen on to the dosas! The best part of the huge masala dosa was the thin, crispy lentil batter crepe, and we also had the paneer and peas dosa, which was a dosa wrapped around a mixture of peas and paneer. Both of these came with two different chutneys (my favorite was the cooling coconut mint chutney) as well as a lentil soup, all of which were perfect for dipping with torn pieces of dosa.\n\nFinally, for our main course, we had the incredible green mango halibut curry. Oh my goodness--the curry was so flavorful, creamy, and savory, and the fried halibut fillet that sat on top was so flaky and tender. The plate also came with coconut rice and was dressed with crunchy taro chips. We ordered a side of the bhatura, a huge, puffy fried bread that was perfect for mopping up every last bit of the curry sauce.\n\nOverall, this was an absolutely fantastic restaurant that will take you on a little flavor and spice adventure. Though a little bit cramped on the inside and though the service is a bit slow, don't let that stop you from coming to enjoy Dosa's modern, fusion take on South Indian food.", "author": "David K."}

Winning before the meal even begins!\n\nDOSA is a SF classic, whether it's the Fillmore or Valencia location. The latter is a bit more casual of the two but still fancy by Mission standards. Food is on the pricier side, but the portions are what one might expect in San Francisco as well.\n\nWhat to get: wine on tap, samosas, dahl vada, and of course a dosa! As many of the reviews have stated, dosas are like Indian crepes. A little bit bigger and a little bit crispier, with unique ingredients within.\n\nBest practices when dining with more than five other people: Everyone order 1-2 dishes that they'd like to try, then pass the plates around for a small taste. Hopefully everyone gets their original order back in front of them to finish. It's hard to do this with small plates, but the regular portions are much easier to split and sample.\n\nAlso to note for groups: automatic gratuity added to the bill. NBD, just worth mentioning. \n\nOverall, an upscale Indian experience beyond the typical Tikka Masala that takes people out of their comfort zones in a tasty way.", "author": "Abby S."}

She knows her business, and knows how to please customers.  I would recommend this owner does not lose her.  (Glasses, arm tattoos, short hair - Her name is Jean.  Owners - KEEP HER! She is amazing!)\n\nSo, first of all, here with my in laws, first visit EVER in 9 years.  So, just trying to make sure good impressions.  They are Indian, husband is Indian, I am not.  \n\nWine we ordered, out of it, but manager comes over, upgrades us to next level for same price. So far, so good!\n\nOrder \"snacks\" or appetizers as we usually call them.  Four of us, so double order of the samosas.  $13 each order..... and they arrive, tiny. I could eat two myself. (And folks, I am 6' and 165.  I don't eat like a pig). Ok........ chicken Chennai as the other. Good.  Decent size to share, not huge.  \n\nAnother appetizer - Onion pakora... Tastes great, but tiny shreds, not the usual battered clumps we are used to. Tasty however.  Not large.\n\nFirst main arrives - shredded lamb.   The portion was the tiniest I've seen outside a tapas place.   My in laws stare at me, laugh (thank gods) and say - what is this? Is this a dinner?  (I begin to sweat)\n\nI look at the manager (she was helping to serve, it was busy) and say \"I hope the next dish isn't this sized.\" Hurried explanation on this being \"small shared plates\", come to find out. Surprise. Fail on the waitress for not advising when ordering.  It also didn't help the bowl was about 7 times larger than it needed to be. \n\nManager handles the remark well - and I wasn't even that mad, just surprised.  In laws are watching!  \n\nManager returns (hello waitress? Where are you?) and says \"I've doubled the portion of the chicken for you, I just want to make you happy.  (We ordered fish.... but, ok, I'll swing at this point - and waitress even warned us it would take an extra 15 min for fish....I'm just sweating bullets here). Channa arrives (chickpeas) - tastes, okay size, not a meal for one. \n\nDOSA arrives - the dosa itself is huge - now I think, ok, they are being funny now.... again, tasty accoutrements to the dosa.  But a dosa is just batter.\n\nIn the the end, a surprise dessert arrives (does the manger read minds and know I was freaking out about making sure the in laws were happy?!)\n\nWe get a 10% neighborhood discount.  waitress only took our order and served the bill - she best tip back really well to everyone else!! That was it.  Servers filled our water, manager served our meal.  \n\nSo, with 4 appetizers, 4 mains, 1 bottle of wine, 10% discount and comped dessert it was $195 plus a $40 tip.  I think bill is $$$ though.  I would say the restaurant is $$$ not $$.   Rents are high in San Francisco, so I get it.  Waitress better give most of the tip to the manager\n\nWe've been here 4 times over 3 years. Service is always really uneven.  The manager saved it this time.  But food is tasty.

We had about a 15 minute wait after one other party (dinner on Saturday night), but we were fairly early at about 6:30. I believe the wait got longer as time went on- tip: the hostess told us we would be texted once a seat became available, but we didn't receive a text and were lucky to have been back in time!\n\nAmbience is chill- they played tropical house music and there was definitely mood lighting. We were seated next to the window, which was a kind of off seating because there were four seats, so we sat side by side, knowing we would be sharing the meal.\n\nI loooove that they give pappadum to start! They're these tasty lentil wafers/chips are so addictive, and the waitress even refilled ours after we finished them while waiting!\n\nAs far as our orders, we got:\n\n-Mysore dosa with lamb keemah: My favorite dish of the night! Mysore dosa was deeelish with stuffed spiced potatoes, accompanied with chutneys, a soup like broth, and the lamb keemah. It was a bit spicy (but a delicious and bearable heat), and enough to open up sinuses...sorta\n\n-Prawn malai curry with rice: This was delicious, but for the price, it wasn't worth it.

I can certainly understand running very spacious restaurant in the city of San Francisco could be very expensive so overall considering all other operational factors in restaurant business I will rate 3.5 for the Ambiance. \n\nService :-  \n\nI found Service is little slow in comparison with other restaurants but it hardly matters because they will treat you with really good quality unlimited fried Papadam. \n\nTip 1 :- Order Chatani sampler, this will really test good with fried Papadam. But make sure that you don't over eat papadam which will spoil your apatite for main course. \n\nTip 2 :- I will really suggest restaurant management to inform guests about Chatani sampler. Getting that on the table is quick and it also enhance the entire dining experience.\n\nFood :-  \n\nI have tried almost entire menu and I really don't have any negative about the food quality. Veg / Non Veg , order anything it is prepared with absolute perfection. \n\nIndian food is prepared here without any western twist. They are very close to authentic Indian food experience. \n\nPricing :-  \n\nIn my opinion pricing is not extraordinary and it is completely sound in resonance with food quality. \n\nOverall I will rate this restaurant 4.5 out of 5. \n\nSan Francisco does not have many fine dining Indian restaurant but such restaurants are really giving good test of Indian food which really keep my hopes alive of for the future :) :)", "author": "Sourabh P."}

Small scallops at that. I'm not sure if they'd run out in the back or what but that's pretty crazy. They came in a pretty tasty curry- the menu said lemongrass/greens/curry- there wasn't any lemongrass or greens so maybe it was just a bad menu choice all around for the evening.\n\nI was also disappointed by the dosa we selected, the spicy mung masala. It was basically bland mashed potatoes inside a dosa shell- no lentils or any spiciness at all.

We opted to get it over cauliflower rice which was also really tasty.\n\nThe food is good, however, I don't feel like we got what we ordered (again, not sure if there were just issues with the service/kitchen??) and that the price of the scallops was way off for what we got.", "author": "Elliott W."}

I wish I could remember the names of the dishes but I can only describe my favorites.\n\nAppetizer we had beet cumin soup- it was very tasty and the perfect balance of beer and cumin.

Third, we had an arugula lentil salad... very good as well.\n\nEntrees we had the lamb DOSA, a shrimp rice dish, and mushroom truffle dish. I wish I remembered the names! The lamb DOSA was very flavorful. And the lamb wasn't gritty.... I'm always 50/50 with lamb, but here it was good! The shrimp rice dish was maybe the least favorite of the dishes- still very good but I was still thinking about that lamb.

You definitely need a reservation here. We were told that we'd be seated in around 45 minutes. While we were waiting, we made an online reservation for an hour later just in case. We ended up being seated via the online reservation before I got a text for my in person reservation. Oh well. \nOverall I'd probably come again for dosas, drinks, and a nice date night atmosphere.", "author": "Amy X."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-07", "description": "Despite always being skeptical of fusion food (particularly when the presentation is pretty), but every visit to DOSA wows me with their tantalizing flavors and overall unique dining experience.\n\nYou start off with complimentary papadum (like an ethnic version of chips) which are light but frankly quite addicting with the nutty/lentil-y tastes. If you manage to save any, they pair well with the sauces of the main courses.\n\nSouth Indian moons ($14.50, chef's selection of 5 different mini-uttapams): Although the pancakes were not crispy as I had expected, they were packed with ingredients. I think my favorites were the mushroom (an assortment with a seamless blend of spices) and the egg poriyal (the brunch version of the uttapam, remotely akin to huevos rancheros with the incorporation of potatoes and chiles).\n\nThali ($24): This traditional platter showcases a tour of South Indian flavors. The server did a great job introducing each one and even explained the order in which they should be eaten. It's more information than your typical restaurant setting attention span may be used to, but it was an enriching experience to learn about the ethnic cuisine in depth. (Disclaimer: the dishes below are not listed in order. If only I had photographic memory to recall things like this!)\n- Seasonal vegetable porlyal: beets, quite pickled.\n- Sambar: a lentil broth, light and pleasant.\n- Rasam kootu: a sophisticated vegetable soup, subtly sweet from tamarind.\n- Idili gunpowder: turned out not as explosively spicy as I had imagined (I was bracing myself for something akin to ghost peppers). Rather, it was a more multifaceted, refined interpretation of spiciness from various spices, beans, chili, and garlic. The texture was notably fine and soft (like gunpowder!)\n- Raita: I may be too used to tzatziki, because I found this too watered down. It did do its job of cooling you down from the gunpowder.\n- Achaar: I think this was my least favorite, very pungently sour.\n- Payasam: a mildly sweet rice pudding. It seemed to be more aromatic with cardamon compared to other places.\n- Paratha: pull-apart, deliciously flakey layers. Not too rich; a perfect vehicle for all the side dishes. I wish there were more paratha to mop up all the sauces from the other dishes as well P:\n- Coconut chicken masala: I had dismissed the coconut as a trend, but it could have not have been better. The coconut added a distinctive and synergistic dimension to the masala, turning it into something of a Thai-Indian fusion curry. The portions were generous too, with the cup full of large meaty chunks of chicken.\n\nMysore dosa ($12.50): Given that we were dining at DOSA, we also got an obligatory dosa and the mysore was quite tasty. It had a bold spiciness, yet the base of masala potatoes and lentils anchored the dish to an overall homemade flavor profile. As expected, the dosa was excellent, thin and crepe-like with a satisfying filling of spicy lentil chutney.\n\nWhile the Mission location lacks the grand tall ceiling of DOSA on Fillmore, it is still considerably ambiancey with the minimalistically colorful touches and modern design. Service was attentive, and our server was helpful in helping us navigate the menu and decide what to order. Metered parking isn't too bad in the area (especially during weekend brunch time... when half the city flocks to brunch hotspots).\n\nIn this era of overpriced toasts, I am definitely a fan of DOSA's vast menu for South Indian/California fusion culinary adventures (bonus: it's Instagrammable!)", "author": "Edna C."}

However, the cold dosas cannot be forgiven. All of our meals but one came out within 5 minutes - the last taking about 20 minutes to come out. I joked that this last meal must actually be made fresh.

The corn and chicken chennai as well as the chutneys were my favorites. The tomatoes in the farmers market salad weren't as ripe as they could have been so it wasn't my favorite but the peaches were awesome and I bet later on in tomato season this salad would be spectacular. \nI didn't want to drink anymore alcohol tonight so had a South Indian Monsoon which had fresh ginger and was very refreshing.

Yes, it is sceney, and its Yelp ads at bus stops make it look even scenier.  (They don't do its owner and executive chef or whatever his title is any good-publicity favors, either.)  And yes, it is expensive.\n\nAll of those caveats are my wordy way of admitting fault, because the food is really good.  I mean really good.  You should come here to try it.  If you're scared of the scene, avoid weekends and maybe even Thursday nights.  Or you could come during Taste of the Mission Week (TotMW), aka Burning Man.  I came on the first Monday of this year's TotMW, and that day happened to have street-food specials, and of course I had to try one of them.  I tried the idli fries, and they are one of the best things I've ever eaten on Valencia Street, and I'll remind you that Valencia street is home to Udupi Palace and used to be home to Boogaloos (RIPish) and Herbivore (RIP, although this location wasn't good).\n\nThe crowning glory of my wrongness about Dosa on Valencia was when the owner and executive chef or whatever his title is came out and actually asked me about the food and talked to me a little bit.  Mind you, I was frumpily dressed (as usual), and I was eating by myself with a large backpack occupying the other seat at my table.  The guy had plenty of reasons and dollar signs to talk to much more important- and rich-looking people than me, but he took the time to ask me what I thought of the idli fries, and I couldn't lie, and I still can't.\n\nThe service is really good as well.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be a regular, but I would definitely bring out-of-towners here, and the food really is good and worth the price as long as you don't come too often.", "author": "John S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-21", "description": "Just as everyone says, this place is pretty bomb diggity.\n\nHopefully this helps a good bunch of you who are interested but I came here for Restaurant week 2017 after reading @lucyatcal 's medium post about the Best and Worst deals of SF Restaurant week--she had Dosa at the top of the list with almost $163ish dollars worth of food for about $40. If anyone is reading this during the week of Restaurant week (Jan 18- 29) first thing I have to mention is that the menu on the site is NOT the same as what they are serving in store! Hopefully they change that... but just a heads up, I actually think it's better because it includes more options of small plates and a choice of dessert.\n\nMy roommate and I (whom I'm sure you'll see her reviews of this place too ;) (shout to to you Marcie!) decided we had to finally try this place after hearing all about it and of course, realizing it was the best RW deal! So the two of us made a reservation and came here along with my boyfriend.\n\nA couple things to note about restaurant week: as a table you pick 3 small dishes, 3 main dishes and 2 desserts and you share with the table. The waitress will portion it between however many people you have. I think the best deal is coming with 2 people but in any case, the servers are really good at making sure there is enough food so even with a big group, I'm sure it would be great :)\n\nWe decided to pick the following:\nSmall Plates:\n- Red Beet and Cumin Soup\nThis was super good! Nicely spiced with a perfect bit of sweetness, this was like a gazpacho (except warm) or like a tomato soup, except with beets. Super smooth and luxuriously rich with a ton of amazing flavor. Definitely going to try and imitate it ourselves! It seems simple but so good and perfect to warm up your soul\n\n- Sprouted Mung and Paneer Salad\nThis was nice--nothing to speak lengths about but it had lentils and a nice crunch from the mung bean. It was pretty refreshing overall, nice and light but also very filling. Ours came with only two small pieces of paneer and we each had a solid couple spoonfuls to try it. \n\n- Chennai Chicken\nOMG so bombass. This was super good, moist and delicious chicken (probably the thighs) and it was covered in a crust and deep fried. It came with this yummy yogurt marinade and all three of us could not stop eating it it was so good, The perfect little appetizer and a taste for all palates :P\n\nMain Dishes:\n- Shrimp Biryani\nThis was really good, a sort of fried rice mixture with really soft rice and a bunch of spices plus a couple of mix ins and some shrimp. We got maybe 4-5 pieces of shrimp and a good helping of rice. This was a great compliment to the meal and just an overall solid option.\n\n- Lamb Keema (Dosa)\nIn case you don't know, a dosa is almost like a mixture of a crepe and like a chip--it's fried on one side so that it's crispy and the other side is a little bit doughy but overall, the dosa at Dosa is pretty thin--great as like a cripsy and flour tortilla in one or a one sided crispy injera (yea, poor description but the closest I can think of!). You'll fill it with sauces, and mixings, just as you would like a taco or crepe or like Injera (ethiopian pancake). Our dosa came with this really nice spiced lamp mixture with some potatoes and on the sides we also got this like coconut green sauce, a spicy red sauce, and a big bowl of this reddish orange curry. Overall it was delicious, especially just mixing everything together!\n\n- Organic Mushroom and Arugula Uttapam\nThis was basically like a pancake--it reminded me a lot of a vietnamese pancake or a part pancake, part omlette-y crepe. It was filled with delicious mushrooms and truffle oil and topped with fresh arugula. This also came with the chutneys and assorted dips which really complimented the dish. We described it as kind of like a pizza pancake aha\n\nDessert:\n- Pistachio Barfi\nThis was a decadant little chocolate sort of cake. So good.... layers of cashew milk fudge with pistachios, ganache and all sorts of goodies layered into a perfect little cake. Its a small serving but so rich that we barely finished it given the small piece we recieved!\n\n- Mango Sorbet\nThe best kind of sorbet period. You really can't go wrong with this, it's the besttttt\n\nAnd that's that! At $42 a person and then additional tax and tip, it was a TON of food and RW was a great way to taste so much of their menu without breaking the bank, since this place is normally pretty high end. The food is really outstanding though and I know I would definitely be back and recommend this to friends. We were all STUFFED and I'm so happy I took advantage of this deal.

Today, DOSA proved me wrong.\n\n// Chennai Chicken ($12) - 3 stars\nLightly fried chunks of chicken breast with a yogurt dipping sauce. We ordered this to balance out the otherwise carb-heavy meal with some protein.\n\n// Chicken Dum Korma ($24) - 2 stars\nThis dish was too spicy for a korma. The chicken was alright, but it's still not a great bang for your buck.\n\n// Channa Bhatura ($18) - 5 stars\nEven though I wasn't a huge fan of the chickpea masala, the bhatura was so delicious that I still had to give this dish 5 stars! If you are thinking about it, consider just ordering the bhatura itself for $6.50.\n\n// White Truffle Masala Dosa ($15.50) - 4 stars\nA crepe filled with spiced potatoes, onions, and cashew nuts. Also, since everybody knows that truffle oil makes everything taste better, we ordered that version.\n\n// Organic Mushroom & Arugula Uttapam ($15.50) - 4 stars\nThe uttapam was a thicker version of the dosa. It came with different kinds of mushrooms and baby arugula. Oh, and truffle oil, for obvious reasons.\n\nI'm certainly no expert on South Indian food, but my friends from Bangalore told me this place was legit. I agree - it lived up to the hype!

Street parking can be a pain but there's a pretty decently priced garage next to dosa which is worth it because there are a number of things to stroll by on the Valancia. We went in to find a beautifully decorated, inviting interior and were greeted by the loveliest of workers (manager? owner?) who ended up being the one that took care of us the entire meal. He was incredibly elaborate with explaining the menu to us which was very helpful since Indian food is not something I am used to and know about. We asked him for a suggestion about the street food portion which I am so thankful we did because his recommendation was amazing. The menu changes frequently so asking for a suggestion is probably the better option as opposed to searching through yelp photos since they might not have something you're looking at. Our meal was shared between 3 people and we were all STUFFED. \n\nPANI PURI (small hollow crispy breads meant to be filled with cilantro-mint-chile, tamarind, black chickpeas, mung, squash) : Our servers recommendation and my personal favorite! He came to do a demo at our table on how to eat these since it was our first time seeing these. You are basically given hollow fried bread balls and you delicately poke a hole through it, as to not crack the entire thing. You then fill it a little with the mixture of chickpeas, mung, and squash. Next comes the sauces which you adjust amounts depending on your taste, the tamarind being sweet, and the cilantro mint chile having a kick! Fill that baby up with sauces and then quickly put the entire thing in your mouth before the sauces make it soggy. It was definitely a delicious experience. \n\nCOCONUT CHICKEN MASALA: This came with an extremely lemony rice that complimented the coconut chicken masala very well and brought the flavors out deliciously. The dish was creamy, rich, and not shy of flavor at all. A must get! We used that warm naan to scrape up all the remaining saucy goodness.\n\nMASALA DOSA (filled with creamy spiced potatoes, onions, & cashew nuts, served with coconut and tomato chutney, and sambar): If you love potatoes (which I'm sure you do unless you're an evil person) then you'll love this. It has so many spices in it you could see the specks of it through the creamy potato mixture. The dosa is so perfectly crispy, it contrasts the creamy potatoes and then the sambar (vegetable stew) is hot and comforting to wash it all down.", "author": "Maleah M."}

Five gumball-sized pieces were not enough for sharing with more than two people.  Even for one, it was a poor value at $12 for the plate.\n\nPoor:\nUttapam with caramelized onions was not pleasing.  It was too heavy on the onions, and rather than caramelized they were crunchy and almost raw.  They were browned a little on some edges, but not a deep caramelization and sweetness like we were expecting.  The menu description hinted at another unique twist on a classic South Indian dish, but actually it tasted no different than uttapams I've had for a third the price at other South Indian spots, some just a few doors away. \n\nAnd the cheese and peas dosa was very dull.  It was just all cheese, a chopped up paneer with a hint of turmeric for color.  I found that filling flavorless.  But it pleased our 10 year old cheese lover, so maybe that's the target audience for it.  A little heavy for a kids menu item, in that case.\n\nSo overall, the room and bar area is trendy and fun for a date night.

Indian food is one of those cuisines that I know very little about and I was happy to have a \"guide\" for the evening.\n\nWithout reservations on a weeknight, I was first seated at a bar and then I was able to improve our position by moving to a table by the window near the entrance.\n\nWe started with the Vada Sambar, which are like little donuts dipped in a lentil based sauce/soup. It reminded me of minestrone and it reminded him of home.\n\nNext, we shared the spicy mung dosas and I realized that I find eating with hands to be as challenging as eating with chopsticks can be for others. I struggled to not make a huge mess or to miss my mouth. I think I failed once or twice. \n\nWe also tried their lamb shank special. It was hearty and ended up being more food than we could finish.\n\nIt was a fun evening and DOSA is a comfortable introduction to Indian food for those who are also not too familiar with the cuisine. There are good cocktails as well.", "author": "Yi Z."}

We were tired of the mediocre restaurants that we were coming up on as we were rushing in our travels so decided to Yelp and plan out a nice Indian meal. After making the journey and reservations to be seated, we are so satisfied at how authentic and fresh everything we had were. Because every single thing we ordered tasted so well and made so authentic to real Indian cuisine, we deemed this place 5 stars. \n\nService was very helpful in making our selections, very knowledgeable and came with the recommendation to everyone to share small dishes so that we can taste as many styles in one sitting. Good advice. \n\nWe had the paper dosa, vada pav (which seemed popular), and uttapum sampler. Paper dosa, incredibly crispy the ENTIRE time. Vada pav, buttery crispy outside with a pleasant cut of sweet chutney. Uttapum, inventively topped with mushrooms (authentic mushrooms of Asia ex. enoki) that compliment so well.  Let me enlighten to those that has not experience indian cuisine in India - In the US, although the dishes can be found, the ingredients from the US are simply different than India. Perhaps a spice would be less potent, the potatoes not as soft and sweet. All of which makes a big difference in the final taste of Indian dishes. Ex. if you mother had a specific brand of peanut butter that she always served, you grow up longing for that familiar taste, smell, and texture. Having a different variety is noticeable when you have eaten it for 20+ years! We are glad to find that this is the first restaurant in the US that authentic, really was authentic down to the spices, saltiness, sweetness of the potatoes, the exact caramelization of onions. \n\nI encourage you to try this place. It would definitely show what authentic Indian cuisine is like.", "author": "Rebecca L."}

They are also gigantic, so I couldn't even touch my third course. Got to enjoy that as lunch the next few days!\n\n1. South Indian Cioppino - I wouldn't even call this a cioppino. It was more of a coconut-y seafood soup. The seafood was good, but the broth itself wasn't my favorite. Pretty steep on the normal menu for what it is too ($17).\n2. Lamb Keema Dosa - The dosa itself was tasty! The lamb was good, but the chutneys weren't my favorite. After trying all of the dosa restaurants in Sunnyvale, I have high expectations for my chutneys now!\n3. Goat Biryani - was wayyy to full at the end of dinner, so saved my Biryani for the next day. I did pick at the crust a little bit though, and it was so delicious. The crust obviously got soggy the next day, but the rest of the dish was amazing.

Upon entering, we were greeted with a friendly hostess and the amazing smell of Indian spices, a nice comforting feeling on one of those super chilly San Francisco nights.  A party of 4 with no reservation on a Saturday night I was expecting a wait, but we were seated immediately in a booth near the back of the restaurant and quickly greeted by our friendly server.  The server was able to go over the menu and explain the difference between Dosa, Uttapam and some good appetizers to share. \n\nWe started with the Chutney sampler as well as the summer bean Vada.  The Chutney sampler was delicious, crisp little wafers with hidden spices and four different dipping sauces.

All served with some tomato, sambar, and coconut chutneys for dipping.  We all agreed the white truffle masala dosa was the highlight or all the dishes.  The amazing aromas of Indian spices with the white truffle oil was decadent and delicious.  \n\nDosa has become my new favorite Indian restaurant in town.  This small quaint spot puts out some of the most flavorful dishes in town and can accommodate a lot of dietary needs (vegan, gluten free, etc).

The atmosphere is good (slightly noisy) but the tables and arrangement feels rather cluttered.\n\nWe got the Habanero-Mango Masala dosa and the South Indian moons. The Habanero dosa was not at all spicy, more like a typical Masala dosa that you'd get in India or an authentic south Indian restaurant. But it did taste good. The South Indian moons consists of all the Uttappams on the menu in mini size, and it's alright. The chutneys are pretty tasty but the sambhar that came with the dosa/uttappams wasn't too great. We loved the cocktails, some of which have a nice spicy or fancy twist to the taste.\n\nOverall, it's worth a try if you like slightly less spicy dosas, with an Americanized ambience and menu.

Pureed beets with a hint of cumin, topped off with creme fraiche. \n\nAnother winner, the lamb keema dosa. Sure I had to pay an extra $2 but that's ok, I could eat a full order of this all by myself. After all, the restaurant's name IS dosa. The dosa itself was a crispy thin crepe that came with a variety of sauces I could fill it with. I liked that the filling was on the side so I could customize it however I wanted. And the soup that you dip it in! Apparently the restaurant was founded on this. \n\nRasmalai for dessert! My first time having sweet cheese. Drenched in a milky rose, cardamom, and pistachio \"soup\". I love flowers! If you do not like floral tasting things, you might not like this. It'll taste like potpourri. \n\nI appreciated that the owner took time to take care of his customers. When our dishes arrived, he thoroughly explained each one to us. \n\nTip: Do not ask for naan.

A lot of my friends who came before suggested that I try out the drinks they had. I tried out the Peony, which was delicious. I never thought mixing milk and alchol outside of a White Russian would be any good, but this was creamy and good. Some of my friends had a variety of other drinks, I think another group favorite was the Port of Call which was a spiked tea with a side of peanuts. For my second drink I had the Aaraam Se, which I was intrigued by the sheer fascination as to what I would get. I don't really remember what it was and it wasn't particularly distinct, so I would say to stick with one of their premade drinks. It is a cool experience none the less to just name off your favorite flavor and the bartender to just concoct something. \n\nAs for food, I started by splitting a plate of Vada Pav which was delicious. The side salad it came with was a nice added bonus and wasn't just a bunch of greens on a plate but rather well made. The Vada Pav was cooked great and had the masala and spice of a more traditional vada pav. Now to main course, and I didn't feel vindicated eating at dosa without having one of their dosas. I chose the White Truffle Dosa due to a recommendation from a friend and enjoyed the meal but definitely didn't think it was that much different than an average dosa I would get from home. I would really love to come back and have one of their more traditional dosa types like a mysore or something else just so I can use it as a better barometer to dosas I have had in Madras. \n\nI also was not a huge fan of sitting right dab middle of the dining area with waiters constantly bustling around, but still I would love to come back just due to how extensive their menu is and their genuine focus on South Indian food. \n\nP.S. The Habanero-Mango is probably one of the spiciest things I have ever eaten. The warning is very well warranted considering my friend who ordered it couldn't even get through half and my mouth was burning for almost the whole meal from just one bite. Beware it is not for the faint of heart, but it was very good for the one bite I could taste before the heat kicked in.", "author": "Vaibhav S."}

Choosing to order the more unique options over the more traditional dishes in an effort to try something different, I found the food inspired, but lacking the key tastes that make Indian cuisine what it is.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-03", "description": "My wife and I used to frequent Dosa Valencia when they first opened several years ago before they made it big. We knew the restaurant was going to be a huge success because the food was so amazing. We loved it. We probably went at least 30 times and when Dosa Fillmore opened we frequented that one because it was closer to where we live. We didn't think Fillmore was quite as good as Valencia but it was still excellent.\nFor some unknown reason we stopped going some years ago. No one reason in particular, I think we just got excited about other cuisines and places and lost interest.\nWe went back to the original Valencia location last night with a couple friends. I knew exactly what I wanted to order and was pleased most if not everything I used to love is still on the menu. A few highlights:\n\n- Lamb sliders. These things were awesome. Heat level is INSANE. I applaud the chef for having the nerve to put as much heat into those things as they do. I nearly choked at first as I inhaled a tiny chunk of the lamb and the heat seared the back of my throat. All good. That's the kind of burn anyone who likes spicy food should love. The quality of the lamb which was finely ground was also superb. \n- Chennai chicken. This is always good, however it used to be better. The chicken used to just explode on the palate with various spices and heat, and the accompanying yogurt sauce cooled it perfectly. Now it is more like a standard fare chicken and the sauce is kind of boring. Disappointed but still pretty good.\n- Dahi Vada. This one was the major letdown of the evening. This dish used to be spectacular. It was served in a nice size bowl with a spiderweb thread of yogurt and sauce that was beautiful to look at and tasted like heaven. Now it is served in one of these gourmet bowls that really allow them to give you half as much and gone is the intricate artwork on top. It still tastes similar but nowhere close to how awesome it used to be. I really think Anjan should restore this dish to its former glory. It was one of the best dishes I've ever encountered anywhere.\n- Corn Poriyal. Very good, refreshing corn spiced perfectly which was a nice break from the heavy flavors everywhere else.\n- White Truffle Dosa. Spot on. As I'd expect from all of the dosas, this one was just as I remembered it and 100% delicious and awesome. \n- Caramelized onion Uttapam. Very good but I didn't think it was very unique. Just ok.\n- Channa Batura. Pretty close to how I remember it and it was usually one of the dishes we loved the most. It still comes out with a gargantuan wheat bread ready to explode with steam in the middle and the divine chickpeas. It is still awesome. I think it used to be a smidgen better but it is still wonderful. \n- We ordered a few rice dishes and a veggie curry also which I thought were good but not the highlight of the meal so I won't go into great detail. \n\nI hope this provides a good review for your consideration of Dosa. If you like Indian food you will not be disappointed with Dosa, just know that technically it used to be better. You still can't go wrong here though. Bon apetit!", "author": "Matt H."}

At $42/person for 3 courses, Dosa has easily one of the most budget-friendly tasting menus in the city. \n\n1st course: Fried sole -  I was surprised by how much fish they gave considering it was just an appetizer. Think the fish from fish and chips, but with a curry dipping sauce rather than tartar. It comes with a little salad which was refreshing.\n\n2nd course: Paneer & Peas Dosa - How does one not get a dosa at a place called Dosa? Paneer is so interesting to me because unlike the cheeses I'm familiar with, it doesn't melt. It's a curd cheese that has a hard tofu-like texture. Definitely get this if you haven't tried paneer before. It comes with a lentil dipping soup as well. I was already getting pretty full by the end of this course...\n\n3rd course: Hyderbadi Lamb Chop - I was struggling by this point but it was easily my favorite course. The yogurt marinade was perfect to undercut that fattiness of the lamb.\n\nGuava Gelato - Everything else on the dessert menu looked extremely rich and heavy. This was the perfect end to the meal.\n\nSolid portions, tasty food, and doesn't break bank. Highly recommended!", "author": "Lucy N."}

To be honest, I didn't really know what to expect as I rarely eat South Indian food.\n\nWe ordered a few things: some dosas, chennai chicken, fish and lamb curries.

My sister and I started with the Poori and the mint chutney which was pretty light, despite being fried bread.  For dinner I got the Rava Masala and my sister got the Spicy Masala Dosa (made Vegan w/no ghee).  I am allergic to rice and my sister is Vegan, and they were able to accommodate both of us, however even though the Rava Masala is made with semolina flour they also use a very small amount (according to the waitress) of rice flour.  Needless to say, I took my chances.\n\nWe drank their house reserve Rose wine and had their house-made Masala Chai with a coconut passion fruit sorbet for dessert.  All-in-all the experience was great, the food was delicious and the ambiance was nice for two late 20's ladies.  My 4 stars is because it was super busy and the 2 bars tenders seemed stretched too thin to give us a lot of attention, so we ended up waiting for things like water refills.  \n\nI will definitely eat here again on my next trip to San Francisco! :-)", "author": "Katie S."}

My favorite is the white truffle masala dosa and I always get it. The last time we were here, we had a reservation for 8pm for a party of 6. We showed up exactly on time but they weren't able to accommodate us until about 9pm due the small size of the establishment. We were starting to feel a bit annoyed thinking they shouldn't have accepted our reservation if they were at full capacity. However, the staff went out of their way to compensate for our wait time and apologized profusely. They offered us some really amazing appetizers of our choice and a round of drinks, all on the house! They were very attentive to us even while we were waiting, constantly trying to free up a table for us. This is the mark of a good business, and we certainly appreciated the way they handled the \"hangry\" crowds during peak times. The food as always was top notch.

It's an Indian crepe, accompanied by sauces (in this case, a coconut cilantro and a tomato sauce), sometimes stuffed. Dosa (like the food) is best eaten with your hands, pulling apart the crispy dough and dipping it in the sauces. \n\nDOSA (the restaurant) does a perfect rendition of this. The whole ritual of breaking apart the food and dipping in the sauces is so addicting, you keep doing it while you're chatting. I'm such a fan of the coconut cilantro sauce, which is light and refreshing.\n\nWhat is better, is that DOSA manages to make my paneer dosa crispy on the edges, and fluffy towards the middle. This holds the paneer well, making this middle part of the dosa chewy. The paneer was savory and well spiced, giving the whole dish so much flavor.\n\nAt the end of the meal, I am stuffed, satisfied, but not to the point of a food coma.

Prior to my visit, I had never even heard of a dosa. Man, I was in for a treat!\n\nFor starters, make sure you make a reservation. This is CRUCIAL. This place, while not terribly small, is not very large, and they seem to operate at max capacity. It's also a very intimate and hip setting, so I imagine it fills up quickly as a date spot. \n\nSo aside from some popular Indian dishes (curries, chutneys, etc.), there are DOSAS...and these things are AMAZING. Depending on what kind of dosa you get (for example, mine had potato with truffle oil as a filling), it can be rolled up or folded...and it is HUGE!!! Imagine a LARGE crepe that is lightly fried (buttery goodness) to perfection. It's large enough to not only eat the contents that come inside of it but also to dip in the various sauces, chutneys, etc. that they bring out with it. \n\nBeware of the lentil curry soup! It is fantastic but also very, very, very spicy. I like spicy things...but my nose was running, and I was sweating like a rabid hog after just a few bites. Whew.\n\nPrices tend to be on the high side. I think a curry dish was in the $20 range. The dosas vary depending on if you get vegetable, meat, etc., but they tend to be cheaper. Appetizers are also on the pricey end. This looks like a great place to get drinks.

Upon arrival to Valencia and 21st St, we were lucky to have found street parking immediately..and the restaurant was just a short walk away. We were seated 15 mins prior to our reservation, since we arrived early, and the host was even considerate enough to offer us the choice of a window seat, since it was such a warm evening. With about 15 minutes to spare before 7pm, we were also offered the Happy hour menu to browse through. We didn't have to wait too long before our waiter arrived to take our order.\n\nOnce our order was taken, we were given a plate of light and crispy homemade chips. It was very tasty and addicting. We started with the Chennai Chicken from the happy hour menu. Fried boneless chicken with a bit of heat accompanied by a yogurt dipping sauce. Although it was too spicy for my palette, I did manage to enjoy about 6 pieces of it while little sweat beads started to build up on the bridge of my nose. \n\nOur waiter was extremely helpful in offering his suggestions for which menu items had a little less heat in them and which menu items we should consider, so that it would be the right amount of food for the two of us. His suggestions we're spot on. \n\nWe ordered the White truffle masala Dosa and the Hyderbadi lamp chops. Both were absolutely amazing! The Dosa.. which is essentially a crepe, was so light and crispy and the potato filling with infused truffle oil was superb. I enjoyed it a lot. The lamb dish was awesome as well. So tender and flavorful!  And the lemon rice accompaniment was perfection. \n\nAfter dinner we even had a little room saved for dessert. We ordered the special homemade gelato. It was toasted rice with cinnamon flavor.  The combo sounds weird....but it tasted wonderful!\n\nOverall, I had a very pleasant experience at Dosa. My tummy was happy and my metabolism was reved up a bit. I would definitely recommend South India cuisine to anyone interested in trying something different. The only minor dislike I had was that their menu items did seem a little overpriced.

I decided I would definitely come back later.\n\nThis past Friday, I came back with a friend who was visiting San Francisco for the first time. We're both South Indian, so we know the authentic taste of a homemade masala dosa, and like I said before, it lives up to it. \n\nThis time, I had the Paneer and Peas Dosa, and my friend had the Sweet Potato dosa. Paneer and Sweet Potato aren't ingredients typically used in authentic South Indian dosa, yet the taste maintained that \"authentic\" integrity.  We also the vada pav, and I loved how they incorporated the spices also prevalent in authentic Indian cuisine, in a fusion way. I also had a Mango Lassi and Rasmalai, which both had an authentic taste. The Rasmalai tasted better than most Indian restaurants and included the flavor of the cardamom and saffron used in it. \n\nThis restaurant is definitely worth the hype and the price.", "author": "Deepti N."}

This trip I did not have a dosa. If I return, I will try one. We shared a bread pillow and we were in love with it. Friends got the lentil fritters, dosa and chicken curry. Husband and I got the scallops (spicy and tender) with lotus root, uttapam (pretty good), and veggie meatballs in a peanut sauce (the \"meatballs\" were nice, but the sauce was a little overwhelming for my taste). The coconut rice was a bit dry and too sweet to accompany the peanut sauce of this dish. Plain rice would have been better. Instead of dessert, we had mango lassis. \nIt was difficult to have a conversation with the noise level of the music. \nIt's very crowded so definitely make a reservation and still plan on waiting a bit.\nThe 4 of us were happy and full when we left.", "author": "Tanya F."}

I was also midway working thru my chai (how ironic) latte and he asked politely if I could finish it quickly since they sell drinks too (like chai!

I really appreciated how professional he was about it so I chugged it like a champ. \n\nI saw down and decided on the lamb Keema omelette. I've never had a lamb omelette before but I have to say, it was very delicious! The egg was very juicy. The lamb was very nicely spiced and there is some sort of red sauce pairing to go with it. It comes with a potato salad too sprinkled some cilantro and some other spices. I was too full by then and packed it to go. I paired this meal with a fresh mango lassi. They hands down have the BEST mango lassi, perfect blend of sweet and creamy. \n\nFor a gal doing a solo lunch, the staff was very kind and attentive, asking me if I wanted to set my yoga mat elsewhere instead of in the floor.

I hadn't been to this Valencia location for many years. I made a reservation for 5 people - had to confirm with a credit card so if I canceled within 24 hours I'd be charged $15/pp. Fine. Fast forward to our arrival (on time). Our table wasn't ready. If I'm guaranteeing my reservation with a credit card I would hope we would be seated within 10-15 minutes of the reservation time. Almost 30 minutes later (and in the sweltering heat - there are some serious ventilation issues happening) our table was cleaned and cleared but we were still not seated (hostess was busy with other people arriving, so I had to ask her if we could be seated at our table). In the meantime, we had been subjected to some *serious* attitude from the bartenders. I've lived in this city for 20 years so I'm used to service with attitude but this was some outrageous eye rolling, non sensical sarcasm just for trying to figure out who to order a drink from while we were waiting for our table. Ugh. We were seated at our table and thank goodness our waiter was wonderful (I wish I knew his name - he was our saving grace). We ordered a bunch of stuff as per his recommendation. Everything was delicious but the timing was off. And it was even more sweltering at the tables than it was at the bar. After we left, we all reeked of fried food because of the ventilation issues.

NINE! and all were SHAREABLE. it was ridiculous how generous they were with portions.  to start, we had the lamb slider (tender and yummy), beet croquette (super interesting!), and seafood chowder (my gf's LOVED and devoured).  then it was a round of dosas - lamb keema (side of minced lamb and peas and diced potato) was soooo good i ate most of it, winter uttapam with potatoes, and something that was more flatbread like. i really enjoyed that each was paired with 3 very delicious dipping sauces - so much spice and flavor in each! and THEN we moved into entrees. my fave item BY FAR is the super tender and deeelicious goat briyani. omgosh. soo good. i would come back again and again for this item! the chettinad chicken was awesome as well with the lemon rice, and the fish curry we didnt even touch (packed for lunch) because we were so full. \n\nawesome experience at dosa. the service was quick and attentive as well, and they spaced out the courses nicely.  we also had delicious cocktails that complemented the food in terms of flavor and spice. overall great.", "author": "Christina L."}

The papadums are so tasty, and with our side of raita ($4.50), the two went superbly together.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers, the shammi kebabs and the cochin calamari.

It's quickly become one of my favorite dishes, especially when packed with a generous portion of veggies. I ordered the Sweet Potato Dosa, which is described as also having \"ginger, shallots, chiles & curry leaves\". It sounded incredible, so I had to have it. \n\nAll of the dosas come with \"coconut & tomato chutneys and sambar, a flavorful lentil dipping soup made with vegetables and spices\".  I thought the chutneys were good, but not great. The sambar was flavorful, but I prefer the version at Vik's Chaat, as this version was a little less spicy. \n\nI think (at least for us vegan folks) it would be nice if vegan options were clearly labeled right on the menu. Our server seemed less than enthused for having to wait on a table of two vegans. She told us that no appetizers were suitable for us except for the soups and salads, which was very disappointing. \n\nAfter some scanning of their online menu post-dinner, it appears that there is a Happy Hour menu somewhere, but I did not see it on our table. Was it perhaps hiding on the back of the drink menu? I would have appreciated if our waitress had suggested it to us, as it was our first time there. No worries, though. My Hanging Gardens cocktail (while expensive) was quite tasty. It was comprised of vodka, beet juice nectar, lemon juice, ginger liqueur, long pepper. I could have easily drank 2 or 3 more of these, but at $11 a pop, they are a little too steep for my more humble income bracket.\n\nIf the service was a bit more enthusiastic and more vegan appetizers were added, I might bump this one up to a four. There is a pleasant atmosphere inside, especially on a hustling, bustling Friday night. \n\nThe hostess was just lovely (wow, what a beautiful smile!), and she and a handsome fellow bid us a fond farewell at the door. It was great to end on a high note. \n\nHelpful hint: if you have any dietary restrictions, there is a really handy dandy chart on their website that will guide you in the right direction.

The lighting is perfect, and the service is outstanding. \nWe ate family style - We tried the Chennai chicken as an app, and this was a show stopper for me, I think I'd have to say my favorite part of the meal. Tangy, sweet, and so unique. We also got their fries. Im a fry snob. I seek the best. And these fries- left me aching for more. They are so delish.\nMy mom, who is from Iowa - got the chicken masala which everyone agreed was the best main dish. They made it less spicy for her, and it was perfect. Although I think it would have been great with the original amount of spice as well. We got the dosa sampler which came with all these different dipping sauces. It was tasty but nothing to write home about. \nThe waitress suggested this puffy bread - which I will dream about til I die. It was sweet, crisp, and so tantalizing. I've never had anything like it.\nI will never forget this meal, and if I ever come back to San Fran, this is the first rez I'm making. Thanks Dosa. I Love you.", "author": "Sara V."}

Great food that is fun to eat, laid back vibe, with friendly servers and bartenders. \n\nI've been here for dinner twice now, and had a good experience each time. Let me first say that I do not consider myself an Indian food expert by any means, and I've only had the usual naan and curry dishes from other places. On my most recent trip here, I ordered the calamari, the prawn masala, bhatura, and the sweet potato dosa to share with my girlfriend. \n\nI'd say that the calamari was reminiscent of ceviche, except with stronger flavor from the spices. Take caution if you cannot handle spicy food. This dish packed a lot of heat! It also came with uttapams (small savory pancakes), which were very flavorful as well. \n\nNext came the sweet potato dosa. A dosa is sort of like a crepe that you can get filled with a variety of fillings. The sweet potato filling was alright, just mashed sweet potato with a conservative amount of spices mixed in. I would actually prefer the dosa plain next time because I like the crispier edge pieces. The dosa came with a few dipping sauces: a warm lentil soup sauce and a variety of different chutneys. They were all really good. I was already pretty full by the time we finished the dosa.\n\nOur prawn masala entr\u00e9e came next. You can get these served with rice, but we decided to try the bhatura. I was afraid that we wouldn't even get close to finishing the bhatura because that thing was HUGE. Thankfully, it's just because the dough expands a lot when it cooks, and is mostly hollow. The prawn masala was SO good. The flavors were and strong were on point, and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. I wish it came with more prawns though. \n\nWe were stuffed by the end of our meal and had leftovers to pack. Next time, I will definitely stick to ordering one appetizer and entr\u00e9e, and either a bhatura OR plain dosa and not both.", "author": "Rosanna K."}

If it's not being screwed by the prefixed menu, it's food, or service. \n\nLast night it all started great. A nice server that gave us exactly what we ordered but when our mains came, never came to check in. I finished my wine and was ready for another glass but our server had disappeared. No one ever came to see if we wanted another round of drinks. We finished our meals with water and finally after 10 minutes past finishing our entrees a completely different server/busser came picked up our plates and asked us if we needed anything else. Well yes the check please. At that moment our experience had been so runed down that we didn't even want to check the dessert menus.\n\nOn our way out we saw our original server in another section of the restaurant. I assume she got moved there half way through our meal and our section never got a server reassigned ...

However, Dosa has a special \"allergy menu\" that's something of a problem. To me, being someone with food allergies (I'm celiac with additional food allergies) an \"allergy menu\" implies that the wait and kitchen staff are conscientious about the needs of those of us with food allergies. If you have a gluten-free menu, that means the food has to be prepared and cooked separate from other food. I've had many wonderful meals at Dosa and then been sick on my way home and for the rest of the night even though what I ordered supposedly didn't have anything I'm allergic to. My guess is that food is getting cross-contaminated--most likely when it's being cooked. \n\nDosa should either get rid of their allergy menu so that those of us with allergies know that the food isn't safe or they should commit to insuring their \"gluten-free\" menu is actually gluten free and not getting cross-contaminated. There are restaurants in SF that meet the needs of those of us with real food allergies without making us feel like we're being high maintenance or asking too much: Nopalito has tons of gluten-free items and (at least on Broderick) is super careful about cross contamination. Tacolicious will cook food in a separate pan (not on the regular grill) for those who react to cross-contamination. And Delfina and Al's Place are also great at dealing with allergies and and making diner's with allergies not feel like pariahs or assholes. I've always wanted to believe that Dosa was in that camp but time and time again I've ended up sick after a really expensive dinner.\n\nOh, and their gluten-free dosa chips--at least at the Fillmore location (I'm not 100% about Valencia) get cross-contaminated after a certain time. And their wait staff generally isn't aware that happens. How confusing is that? Seriously, claiming your food is gluten free and then trying to save a couple dollars by cross-contaminating the cooking oil with gluten at a certain time is just about as lame as it gets.\n\nThe message is if you have real food allergies, unfortunately, it's probably better to stay home and not be in pain.", "author": "Beth B."}

My friend raved about Dosa Palace however and said he preferred their dosa to Udipi Palace so decided to come back the next day for dinner. However, after ordering an appetizer I was so disappointed that I ended up leaving and going back to Udupi Palace. \n\nIndian food is one of my favourite cuisines and I expect it to be very hearty and traditional. My order at Dosa Palace however didn't taste at all like traditional Indian food. I ordered their lentil fritters with yogurt sauce and I expected it to be pancake size fritters with yogurt sauce on the side or top. Instead I got something that was 90% yogurt with fritter balls that were 1/2\" in diameter. While it was very prettily presented, there wasn't enough substance to the dish. I felt like I had basically paid for fancy organic yogurt with Indian flavors. After looking around at the other patron's meals, I decided to pass on the entree. The prices at Dosa Palace were higher than I expected but the portions looked to be smaller than normal. If I'm paying alot of money for food I better be able to have leftovers I can use for another meal. \n\nWhile I\"m sure many people enjoy Dosa Restaurant, for me it was too fancy to satisfy my craving for authentic Indian food. Since I'm on vacation in San Fran, I'm not trying to eat diet food. This restaurant definitely caters more to people who want organic Americanized Indian food with small portions. \n\nI do have to give them props for their service though.

The music is a little too loud, which is probably my only criticism. Everything else is excellent.\n\nChennai Chicken: Spicy, spice-filled chicken, crisp on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside\n\nTruffle Masala Dosa: The perfect example of Dosa's Indian-American fusion fare. The crepe was the perfect texture--light and fluffy, yet crisp and thick, if that makes any sense. The filling was the quintessential potatoes and spices but with the addition of Italian truffle oil. Did the combination work? Oh my lordy lord, YES!!!\n\nSeasonal Vegetable Curry: My friend's entree for the night. Tasty and healthy and all that good stuff\n\nRasmalai: Probably my favorite Indian dessert of all time (besides chum chum), and one I always order at any restaurant that offers it. It's funny. I think ordering actually cheese for dessert is for rich morons with no taste, but I've discovered in recent years that I absolutely love desserts made with cheese such as kanafe and rasmalai. Dosa's rasmalai was just perfect. The paneer was clearly freshly made and generous in portion. The malai had the perfect combination of cardamom, sugar, cream, pistachio and rose water. How good was this dessert? Well, my friend who is getting married and has banned herself from having dessert could not stop eating this. Yeah, that's how good it was.\n\nFor drinks, I got a custom cocktail with vodka, cardamom, lime and vanilla bean. It was absolutely delicious.

Somehow, it always evades me, until a recent Saturday morning. \n\nFor hardcore carnivores like me, prepare yourself. Meat item selection is very minimal, so I suggest you embrace it and go with the flow.\n\n- Pani Puri ($8): Traditional small hollow crispy breads served with chickpeas, mung, potatoes, tamarind water, and spicy-sour mint sauce. Make a small hole in the bread, fill it up with all the ingredients, and prepare for the flavor explosion in your mouth. I've had this several times before and they execute it fantastically. Very fresh ingredients and a wonderful combination of flavors, especially the tamarind.\n\n- South Indian Moons Uttapam ($14): Instead of getting one large uttapam for $10-$13, you can try all five for a little bit more. This features the Trumpet Mushrooms, Caramelized Onion and Paneer & Peas uttapams, as well as two others I don't recognize on their menu. Each one has its unique, but delicious flavor. Although a bit westernized, they still feature the distinct South Indian tastes. Trumpet Mushroom is #1 IMO, with Paneer & Peas as a close second. Dipping sauces are also fantastic, especially the tomato chutney.\n\nAlthough it's not on the menu, they have mango lassis. Unfortunately, they didn't impress. Too thick and dry. \n\nOne big downside is the service. Although our waiter was attentive and efficient, he went a little bit extreme on the former. When you ask for water, it shouldn't come with a lecture on the differences between their sparkling and still selection. He also made our token Indian friend a bit uncomfortable with his condescending attitude and inquiry into whether we knew how to eat all of our dishes.This was accompanied by several minutes of unnecessarily lengthy explanations. I understand he means well, and I appreciate it, but this needs to tone down. I just want to eat my food before it gets cold.\n\nDosa on Valencia takes a surprisingly semi-upscale approach to traditional South Indian street food, and I approve.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

In the meantime, we had been subjected to some *serious* attitude from the bartenders. I've lived in this city for 20 years so I'm used to service with attitude but this was some outrageous eye rolling, non sensical sarcasm just because I asked politely who to order a drink from while we were waiting for our table (it was unclear who was doing what behind the bar, and nobody bothered to ask us if we'd like a drink).

Not sure if it is because it is supposed to be \"Southern Indian\" or if it is a \"fusion\" concept, but the main reason to come is the \"Dosas\" (hence the name) & \"Uttapam\".  These are variations of a nan, huge, fried dough puff, or flatbread, created with different flavors & herbs, served along with different sauces to dip.  These are delicious.  Having the 5 chile uttapam was delicious and not as spicy as the menu would indicate, so don't be afraid to try.We also shared some Mango Curry Fish, and some other dishes.  Our nephew needs to eat gluten free and our waitress was so amazing at explaining the gluten free dishes (they even had a separate gluten free menu) and she was so careful to speak with the chef to ensure there was no cross contamination on the preparation.  The service was excellent and the food delicious!  Definitely a need to go place if you like Indian food.", "author": "Steven B."}

We were a party of 4, but a table for two was literally right up against our table - you would have thought we were a party of 6!  The food is delicious, but super small portions. As an example, $28 for two very small lamb chops? Laughably small portion of eggplant - 5 very small quarter slices - delicious, but we got that as an appetizer for our party of 4. The eggplant was LITERALLY 5-bites total. The $24 chicken masala was interesting - green, and tasty, but not what you normally think of as masala.

This was pretty good but nothing special. It's basically spicy chicken tenders. I thought the portion was pretty small if I had to pay full price. \n\nPrawn Masala w/ Shrimp curry ($18): Coconut milk, red chiles, ginger, red onions, spices. The flavor of the curry was good and reminded me of a spicier version of chicken tikka masala. We got this with coconut rice ($3), which went very well together. $21 total for curry and rice though? I would much rather go to a casual Indian restaurant and get the same thing for less than $10. \n\nOrganic Mushroom & Arugula Uttapam ($15): Trumpet, maitake & beech, mushrooms, curry leaves, truffle oil, topped with baby arugula. I wasn't the biggest fan of this dish. There were too many mushrooms and I barely tasted any truffle flavors.  I would recommend getting a different Uttapam if you are thinking about ordering this. \n\nOverall, I thought the food was average and overpriced.

Also tried and recommend the masala dosa and the chicken on the small plates menu. Lentil soup had a good spice to it, tasted like vegetarian chilli. One thing to note is the waiter brought by a second bowl of lentil chips and we thought it was complimentary.

We got two stringy, tendony, fatty meat-resembling dishes and a crispy, delicious Rava Dosa. With masala. A different waiter brings us a regular dosa, but takes it away since we already have our dosa.\n\nWe get billed for both a full Masala Dosa, and a side of dosa too.  I was politely trying to explain to the waiter that while we didn't order the masala we were happy to pay for 1 dosa, when the waiter starts insisting that the Rava Dosa was not a valid side order. (Who confirmed our order off his notepad then, your twin brother?) Before I can say anything, he rudely tells us he's getting the manager and pouts off. \n\nThe manager asks if we have ordered this exact combo before (we have) and whether we go there often (we do), then says there is no way this should have happened since Rava Dosas are not a legit side.  He asks again if we go there often (we do) and then says he has to talk with the owner since this is a \"special situation\" that has NEVER happened before. Comes back 5 mins later and explains that they can take the extra dosa off but that he would email (REALLY?) all the waiters at both locations to make sure they don't give Rava Dosas as sides. And that they need to standardize so this NEVER happens again. Seems simple - a mistake was made, remove the offender from the check, apologize and be done with it. \n\nI'm confused and sad.

We go there couple of times a month or at the very least do takeout once every two weeks. With that said, I had a terrible experience there for the first time. I'm intolerant to gluten and one of the items I ordered was the bhel puri. On asking our server if it was GF, I got a positive response. When the dish was served, i went through about half of it before noticing pieces of something that looked very close to a wheat cracker. I picked out those pieces and asked the server if it was GF to which he asked his co-workers and told me it was puffed rice. Being an Indian, I'm pretty confident of what puffed rice looks like so I asked for the allergan menu. On that I noticed the dish can be made GF but typically has wheat in it. On further questioning the hostess, I find out that the dish was not made GF.\n\nI understand that restaurants screw up. My issue, however, was with how the situation was handled. When I first asked the waiter, he should have bought me the menu so we could double check. Fine that didn't happen, so what about the second time I asked and was told that the ingredients that looks like they were made of wheat were puffed rice. It was only when I asked a third time that the wait staff finally made an attempt to double check and see what order had been put in. \n\nAnd I get really mad when people just take things off your check as a way to appease you without really talking to the customer about why it happened and how it could have been avoided. Being gluten intolerant doesn't mean I just didn't like my dish..I will now have to deal with some severe discomfort because of this.

Bartender apologized, said he'd take it off our bill, but he didn't take them off our bill. \n\nOur friends arrived. We moved to our table. Server was very helpful and, since it was our first time at Dosa, gave us an enthusiastic run-down of the menu. \n\nWe shared some chutneys with pappadum. Chutneys were really nice and varied. One was spicy, one was herby, one was fruity, and the other vegetabley. Why, however, are they served in little rectangular dishes that are nearly impossible to eat out of? Pappadum was excellent. \n\nIn the lull between appetizers and entrees, we began to realize that no one in the restaurant was happy to be in the presence of a child. The child is incredibly well-behaved, and the parents are laid back, so I don't really understand all the stealthy glances and looks of horror we received. Being from Europe, it's normal to have kids around in public spaces. They are just part of our life. We don't go to restaurants expecting a perfectly silent and private experience. For that, we stay at home! Anyway, I digress...\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the sunchoke-paneer koftas, lamb pepper-fry, chicken korma, and the south indian moons (a selection of 5 mini uttapams). Everything was fantastic. The food was so good that we temporarily forgot everything else. It was so good that we hardly cared about how dirty the toilets were (they were dirty though, like gas station dirty). The food was so damn good that we didn't waste a bite of it.

This was my first visit to Dosa on Valencia and surely will not be my last. First the bad part. Parking is horrible. Now the good: The room is fantastic. High ceiling with beautiful fixtures and artwork. The service was impeccable. Everyone, to a person, went out of their way to be friendly and welcoming. The menu is big but we were a party of six, including two Indians and four others who have been to India dozens of times each. We did full justice to the menu, ordering about 8 appetizers and 7 or 8 entrees. Each and every dish was prepared to perfection. I have to say it's some of the best South Indian food that I have ever had in America. I give Dosa on Valencia my fullest recommendation.", "author": "Mik H."}

We also got an order of the idli fries which were not bad, but the cranberry chutney that accompanied them was truly out of this world -- apparently just got introduced a week or two ago.\n\nMy son got his favorite kid's crown dosa with a good helping of the seasoned mashed potatoes and chutneys. I finished my meal with an order of the vada sambar. The sambar was heavenly -- always love the sambar at the other location as well -- and the chutneys were great too.

Dosa is different so don't go expecting the usual. I love the location on Valencia. The new Fillmore restaurant was way too upscale for the food and just made me uncomfortable. The atmosphere here is busy but feels warm and cozy. \n\nI've been here so many times and I love it but I always get the dosa. I think much of the menu is overpriced and frankly, the dosa is just amazing so I always get it. I usually come with a girlfriend and split two dosa and a salad or appetizer. I recommend getting the two different kinds of dosa and I also highly recommend allowing your server to choose for you or make suggestions. They know their stuff.\n\nThe wine selection is amazing. I've never, except here, sipped a wine that tasted exactly like the description on the menu! White wine seems to go particularly well with the spicy food and yes, it is spicy but it wears off quickly. I have a pretty low tolerance for spice and yet enjoy the heat of the food here.\n\nThe dosa expands in your stomach so at first you won't think you've ordered enough but just take your time eating it and you will have enough. I've never had any other food with the flavor of these sauces. It's really an incredible experience. Like fireworks in the mouth.", "author": "Angelique L."}

I trusted her judgment so I really can't recall what we had.\n\nI recall staring off with a roasted beet salad, followed by a chicken dish stewed in a green sauce with califlower. Also, we had a order one of their masala. \n\nBy far my most favorite dish was the masala. The texture was flaky with a great chewy bite. Inside, was a good spread of well seasoned puree of vegetables (spinach, kale, etc?), The accompany side of sauces were also pretty good as well and paried nicely with our meal. The portion is quite good!\n\nThe chicken dish was ok, felt the chicken was way overcooked and the portion was slim. However, the sauce was good and would like to know how that was made. No real call out on the salad, cooked fine, really tart, straight forward dish.\n\nI spoke to one of my co-workers about Dosa and she told me that they don't serve anything special. The dishes found there are what are typically served at home but they charge a great deal more. \n\nWhile I can safely say that its not \"cheap\" it's within reason.

(Actually, I would love to deduct more stars for her but I love the food here). I was ordering for the entire table (6 of us), and after I got the first two items out, she began to tell me I was ordering \"incorrectly\"...excuse me, but is there a correct way to order?? I told her I would be ordering more than those two items (obviously 2 dosas alone will not feed a table of 6) but she wouldn't let me get another word out. She began to explain all the different dishes they had and how I'm supposed to be ordering one of those other dishes...ok, we get it, not our first time dining there nor was I finished ordering. My uncle had to chime in and said to her \"maybe let us finish ordering first and then make suggestions?\" She still didn't shut up about the different options and she was adamant about how we should order a curry dish. Well maybe if she stopped rambling, she would have known we were ordering 3 of the curry dishes she kept talking about. After 5+ minutes of her talking nonstop, we finally continued our order. I think she realized her mistake and quickly took our order and walked away. Never saw her again. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing at that point. \n\nOnto the food. So delicious!! For the dosas, I recommend the paper dosa and truffle masala dosa. The paper dosa is huge! Definitely enough for 6 people. My personal favorite is the habanero dosa but beware, its spicy (or at least to my family, It wasn't spicy to me but I'm also a freak when it comes to spicy foods). The chicken korma is also really yummy...my uncle liked this the most! My table also ordered the shrimp curry and fish curry (it was their special that day). I think the shrimp was the winner of the two. My mom really liked the Channa bhatura as well, that puffy bread is amazing! The only thing was the Channa was that the onions were overpowering, but if onions are your thing, order this. The mushroom uttapam was good too but I think I prefer the dosas. Not as heavy!

We weren't too hungry, so we decided to start with the paper masala dosa which was humungous! I usually prefer thin and crispy over thick dosas, so this was perfect. I think my eyes popped out of my head when it was delivered to us. It's gigantic!!! It was very thin and crispy and tasted so good with the sauces that came with it - coconut, tomato mint, potatoes and a veggie based stew. All were very good! Somehow, we were able to finish the whole thing. We also decided to order the Tamil lamb curry to share. We added lemon basmati rice to this dish and it paired perfectly. Every bite was flavorful and tender. It had a subtle kick in the background, but it worked well. \n\nThe waitresses were super duper nice and attentive. When we sat down, we were curious about the spice level of the habanero mango dosa and she offered us a sample, which were really appreciated. No joke, that is super spicy! We enjoyed our dinner and will gladly return again to try many of their other offerings.", "author": "Cindy T."}

This year, my friends and I weren't in the mood to pay a $50-100 cover to get crunk and dance with strangers.  We just wanted to spend it with each other and have a good meal, good drinks, and good company.\n\nA week prior, Open Table indicated that Dosa was booked for the majority of the night.  We called and they were able to give us a table for 12 at 10:30pm on new years eve.  This was perfect because we could eat until the countdown and they were giving out complimentary champagne and party favors.  The restaurant was about 75-80% filled at the countdown which wasn't bad.  Everyone was happy and noisy.\n\nThere was a 4-course NYE menu for $49/person which was a LOT of food. You're basically getting 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert.  My husband for the prix fixed and I got one entree.  Below was his 4 course dinner:\n\n--Appetizer: Chicken Kebabs.  They're like spicy and delicate chicken patties with this amazing cilantro sauce.  People were hesitant to order this because I'm sure in their minds they were expecting overcooked white meat on skewers.  This was not the case at all.\n\n--Entree 1: You can choose either a dosas or uttapams.  I tried the white truffle dosa and after sharing this one person, we were both veering on the full side.  This is a BIG pancake.  I couldn't really taste the white truffle.\n\n--Entree 2: Goat curry.  The meat pieces were bone-in and so incredibly tender.  I loved the dish.  The accompanying rice had a strong lemon flavor that went well with the goat.  The downside is that there are quite a few bones to pick through the dark sauce.\n\n--Dessert: Tearamisu.  It's their take on the tiramisu using paneer and chai both in the cake and in the chocolate-chai sauce.  Almost better than the original.  It's like drinking chai.\n\nAnd my single entree was the Kerala Chicken which looks like a dish of really poo green mush but is so AWESOME!  I couldn't stop smelling each spoonful before the bite because the fragrance of the coconut milk was so enticing.  I don't think I've ever really done that before.  I do agree with some other Yelpers who say that the non-dosas are better than the dosas so be sure to order other items such as this.\n\nDrinks were also well made and they have a section of spice-filled drinks.  Get ready for cumin, chili, and cardamom.  I got the Gunpowder which is Antiguo Reposado tequila, gunpowder agave, lemon, elderflower, and grilled mezcal pineapple.  I was worried this would taste too strong but the bartender reassured me that the other ingredients help to mask and balance out the tequila which it did.  \n\nMy drink did come pretty late but other than that, service was top notch.  Pictures make the place look casual during the daytime but the ambiance is pretty romantic at night with all the candlelight.  It's a small place so make a reservation!", "author": "Shannon L."}

They have a fun bar program, with an extensive gin and wine list, as well as cocktails, but also lots of fun non alcoholic bev options too.

There is a lot to this menu, and if you need any explanations, the staff is only too happy to help - they are well versed and on it if you need something.

All have their own distinct twists and all are wrapped in roti and then FRIED like an Indian BURRITO.

Yes, and they DO go with that! We were sad to stop there, but knew we could fit no more in our party clothes, and so we did the sensible grown up thing and walked away from the menu, but don't think for one second that our stomachs agreed with this prudent decision.\n\nWhat also sets Dosa apart is the atmosphere. It's beautiful, spacious and luxurious feeling.

It was simply amazing with the \"Medu Vada\" which was crispy outside and fluffy inside and made for an amazing appetizer ! \n\nSadly, their namesake dish, the Dosa, on the otherhand, was pedestrian and sorely disappointing --- which is not to say that it was an unmitigated disaster; it was still a pretty respectable Dosa !\n\nThe spicy pepper chicken which is served with a side of either lemon rice or dosa (I went for the dosa) made for a satisfying meal with generous portions, and in my opinion goes pretty well with a glass of Riesling.\n\nI'd rate it 4 stars for their food, service, and decor but have to dock one star for disappointing on their namesake dish.", "author": "Umesh T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-13", "description": "Dosa. \n\nOne of the great frontiers on good Indian food in San Francisco. \n\nTonight was actually my second time here and I only arrived here by chance because of the lack of parking around Pakwan (ANGRY FIST SHAKE). \n\nFor those of you who don't know what Dosa is, it is basically a crispy fried crepe packed with Indian food deliciousness (amount of deliciousness varies). If you've never had it, stop what you're doing right now. \n\nSeriously. Stop it. \n\nGo find Dosa and make damn sure it's good. Better yet, put Dosa on your GPS and get here now. \n\nThis place does not disappoint, not in the least bit. There's a little bit of everything here for everyone, lamb lovers, chicken lovers, vegetarians, Indian cheese lovers (yes this is a thing). \n\nTonight, we ended up tasting from the Dine about Town Menu which gave us an opportunity to try a couple things we normally wouldn't have. \n\nWe started off with the Cochin calamari and Chennai Chicken. The chicken was coated and fried with a great cumin flavor. The calamari was definitely my favorite of the two though. The hints of coconut milk come out and give it a great balance and the calamari was perfectly tender. \n\nSecond course was the Spicy mung masala dosa and Paneer and peas dosa. The Spicy mung dosa had a decent amount of heat to it and I found it a little bit harder to eat. I'm typically not a huge fan of mung (just the word sounds gross...mung...mung...bleh) but this dish was definitely tolerable and probably good if you actually like mung (bleh). Now Paneer I have a special place in my Indian stomach for. \n\nI will eat paneer like it is my f***ing job. \n\nThis particular dosa was incredibly flavorful, which can sometimes be hard because paneer often just takes over the flavor of whatever it's in, kind of like an indian tofu mozzarella cube. \n\nMy only gripe is that my friend I was eating with is an asshole. Now if you have read any of my yelp reviews, you'll know that spice is not always my friend. Well spice reared it's ugly head again and beat me mercilessly into submission. \n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nDo not, I repeat, do not order the Mango habanero sauce unless you are prepared to be clutching a pillow for the next two hours, deduced to nothing but a puddle of heat sweats and shear pain. This is not white person \"OMG, LIKE JALAPENOS ARE SO HOT\" hot. No, it's \"I rub ghost chilis in my eyes for fun\" hot. It's flavorful, you think it's okay, then you start getting adventurous and put more and more on there. Then you realize that the enamel on your teeth have begun to wear down from the fumes. You've been warned. \n\nWe finished off with the pepper chicken and pepper lamb with rice and yogurt. These were alright and honestly probably the weakest part of the night. Both were a little bit too salty for my taste, but they both had a great flavor profile (whatever the means). \n\nI will now digress. \n\nIf you have read all you need to know to convince you to go to Dosa, please stop reading. But for the love of all that is great in this world (see puppies, ice cream, and Nicholas Cage), they have Pappy Van Winkle here. \n\nThere are few bars, restaurants, homes, etc. in San Francisco that have Pappy Van Winkle. For those that are unaware to the world of bourbon, Pappy (in this case a 15 year) is the pinnacle of good bourbon. It's about $18 for a pour, which is actually really cheap for this particular blend, and you will be so much happier after having it. Also, who wouldn't want to have bourbon from a bottle which has an awesome old dude smoking a cigar? \n\nAnyways, look this is a great place and you should go check it out for yourself. The staff is pretty friendly, and the wait isn't too bad, provided you're willing to sit at the bar.

The only reason I am not giving it 5* is I was very disappointed in the portions of the Dine About Town 3-Course Dinner.  It's more of a petite sampler.  The portions were definitely smaller than ordering from the main menu.  \n\nMaybe this is a false impression I have, but I thought Dine About Town was to promote business during a notoriously slow month for restaurants and that they have the 3-course dinner so patrons can try their food at a discount.  Not the case here.   I have been to other Dine About Town restaurants where they serve you the regular menu size.  The 3-course was $36.95.  Here, if I ordered off the menu, it would have been $47.  For the 21% discounted rate of $36.95, I felt like I received about half of the normal food.  I was not the only one who felt this way.  Like us, the lady next to us ordered the Kerala Chicken on the special.  I heard her pick up one of the few morsels of chicken and say, \"Now, this is just sad.\"", "author": "Janelle O."}

What we got was a mini kitkat size dessert for 10 freaking bucks ???? They looted us. The worst of all, it tasted like medicine and was the worst ganache I ever tried. Never coming back here again.

The food is unbelievably delicious!\n\nSome of my favorites...  You can never go wrong with the mung salad, chennai chicken, a paneer and peas uttapam or dosa, seasonal curry or any of the brunch dosas.  They also have wonderful cocktails to wash down all that spicy food.\n\nFor anyone with a nut allergy, they have a special menu just for you.

It was flavorful and the presentation was lovely. We then all shared the chicken karavali and the spicy mung curry dish and it all tasted great!

Been here a couple times, and I've liked every single thing I've tried so far. Plus the papadums (lentil chips) they give you to start with are DELICIOUS ... I inhale them all in 30 seconds and have to ask for another bowl.\n\nPani Puri - These gems are AMAZEBALLS. 7 little pani puris for $8 - I would say this was the best appetizer. It was on a special mini appetizer menu so I don't know if they always have them, so get them while you can! Pani puris are little hollow crispy flour balls, and you poke a hole on top. Then they give you 3 items to fill it with (chickpeas, mashed potato, and mung beans) and then they give you 2 sauces (a slightly spicy mint chutney (sauce) and slightly sweet tamarind chutney) to pour on top. The guy who served them to us was so nice, and asked us if we knew how to eat them (we didn't), and expertly showed us how to make one/made one for us! The mint chutney was seriously YUM and I literally ate it by itself and poured it on everything else I ate the rest of dinner.\n\nCrispy Fish Pakora - These are SO good! Little fried fish sticks. But now that I've had them a couple times, I'm starting to think they're not worth the $$$ (5 sticks for $11). Good to try if you've never had them before, though, and they didn't have them at the Fillmore location when I went.\n\nChennai Chicken ($9.5) - This was also very small but very delicious and flavorful, and comes with yogurt for dipping. ($9.50)\n\nLamb Pepper Fry ($19.5) - Good tender lamb but a little salty (and now that I'm looking at the menu prices, expensive too holy cow!). Very small for the price - think one cup of curry. We got it with the lemon rice ($3) but everyone said was good but personally, I'm not a big sour fan, so I'd probably go for coconut next time.\n\nChanna Bhatura ($15) - \"BIG PUFFY THING\" - GET THIS! Fight with your friends over who gets to be the first to rip a hole and deflate the steaming bhatura. Slightly sweet, slightly crispy, and slightly chewy. You will have leftover chickpea masala so you can eat it with the rice or dosa or something later on.\n\nSpicy Mung Masala Dosa ($11) - Best bang for your buck. Really good! Basically a giant crepe folded over with mashed potatoes in the middle. It also comes with a lentil soup, which you can also eat with rice too wooot!\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa ($12) - If you come here a lot like me and get bored of the Spicy Mung Masala Dosa, you should get this one! The filling is the normal potato/onion/cashew mix you you'd expect, but with truffle oil. I love truffle oil and you can really taste it here! \n\nFennel and Spinach Dosa ($13) - This one's a little different from the other dosas. Instead of one big crepe, they divide it into a couple of smaller rolled up crepes. And it doesn't have masala, so there are no potatoes, and the filling is sauteed spinach and more vegetable-y. I personally like the other two dosas listed above better.\n\nUttapam: South Indian Moons ($14) - These weren't BAD, but they were nowhere as good as the other dishes. This was a sampler of all five uttapams and they were all pretty unimpressive, and kind of all tasted the same. Kind of like a small thick not-sweet pancake with different things on top. I would just not order an Uttapam and get another Dosa instead lol.\n\nDrooling after writing this review... can't wait to go back!", "author": "Cynthia W."}

Fully recommended.\n\nLotus Stem Day Boat Scallops --- juicy, thick scallops that were lightly burned on one side and lightly sauced with a side of fried lotus slices. Yummy!\n\nHyderabadi Shammi Kebabs --- weird stuff. It's like a tiny pancake-y thing topped with a mashed protein substance that is supposed to be lamb. And yet it's called a kebab.

ROFL.) settled on Dosa after we watched The Geezer at The Marsh across the street (great venue, great people-- different review for a different time.) I had initially wanted to take him to Upidi but he pointed out, \"Its Vegetarian.\" SO, we checked out Dosa on a Saturday night around 7p (we had tried to do an open table reservation around 6p (during intermission) and open table pulled up 8:45p as the first table available at Dosa. We decided to go and check it out at 7p anyway and actually had no wait to sit at the bar. (Fortune cookie advice: If you're desperate to eat and can't wait for your reservation, try your luck. You may get lucky.)\n\nWe had the fish pakora as an appetizer, 5 stars. Perfect crunchiness with great fish texture and sweetness. Have had better chutney than the two they supplied. \n\nMasala dosa & lamb pepper fry with lemon rice on the side: both saltier than I like but overall alright. Loved the dosa (BF: \"this is authentic. 4/5\") and the lamb (BF: \"3/5\"), just wished things were less salty. 3 stars out of 5 (my boyfriend's lamb dish is much better), have had much better sambar (though, it may be because I like okra in mine *it is key to any good sambar!* and this one just had some squash and potatoes and carrots?) So, I guess it would be a subjective 2 star rating because I've had better (which, is the definition of a 2 star on Yelp) and I can't deal with salty foods. But, since the fish pakora was worth another trip, I'd say it was a 3 star, A-OK in my book. I think I'm becoming an SF food snob. :) \n\nHad the South Indian Monsoon as a drink and it was pretty good-- I really like ginger. Chai was alright: heavy handed on the cardamom, per my boyfriend.

We took the BART from Fremont and got delayed by half an hour. We called ahead and explained to them that we were getting late. They were very courteous and said it wouldn't be a problem as long as we were done by 830 pm (we reached at 730 pm).  All that didn't matter as they had our table ready and we had pretty much decided what we wanted on the way to the place. \n\nOnce seated, service was quick and our waitress was really nice and friendly. We ordered our food and less than three minutes later, we had our Dahi Vada. Being Indians in a very pricey restaurant, I guess our expectations were equally high. The $9 Vada was not even worth half as much. The presentation was nice, but that was it. The Vada was old, had too much cumin, and was a huge letdown, especially since we'd heard it was a favorite. Just based on that, I immediately gave it 1-1.5 stars. Next, I ordered Rasam for my itchy throat and literally the only thing good about that was that it was hot and seasoned with spices reasonably well. It tasted pretty sad though. My rating was now a solid 2. My girlfriend still hovering at 1-1.5. At this point, we were actually talking about opening our own restaurant and how much better we'd be at making Indian food. \n\nThen came our main course dishes and lifted our ratings to 3 stars. We ordered a Channa Batura and a Masala Dosa. The Batura was the largest I've ever had, and that includes restaurants in India. It was a standard affair, except of course, it's sheer size. The Channa was, well.. We make it better at home! The Masala Dosa was bland as a wall, but the tomato chutney and sambar were very nice. In all fairness, we didn't ask for it to be spicy, because, well, we didn't know what to and what not to expect. The Dosa itself was well cooked and tasty, if of course, you didn't care about the flavor too much. All that these dishes did was add $25 to our bill of $13 and boost our rating of this place from 2 to 3 stars. \n\nWe would never go there again, if we could help it.

I guess it didn't hurt that we arrived around 2:30 pm - one hour before they closed. The restaurant was pretty empty so our waiter was very attentive to our table. I was pretty excited to come here because I love Indian flavors and this place also made Michael Bauer's 'Top 100 Bay Area Restaurants for 2009' list, which just came out the previous weekend.\n\nI was sad that they ran out of the meat curries by the time we got here, but I am pretty used to eating vegetarian Indian cuisine. In fact, the flavors from the lentil soup were very similar to the Vedic food that I've had from Hare Krishna in San Diego. As for the menu, our waiter was very helpful in suggesting the dosa and uttapam plates. Dosas are very reminiscent of crepes and uttapams are similar to scallion pancakes. \n\nWe ordered the masala and spring dosas and the caramelized onion, paneer & peas, and seasonal fruit napoleon uttapams. They all came with a coconut and tomato chutneys and a sambar (soup). I loved the smokiness of the sambar and the coconut chutney didn't have an overpowering coconut taste. We also added an egg plate of which I don't remember the contents. The flavors were simply amazing. I actually preferred the uttapams to the dosas because the thin crispy dosas had a tendency to get cold very quickly. We also tried six additional chutneys of which I only remember three. The spicy habanero is not for the faint of heart and the sun-dried tomato one was too overwhelming. I did enjoy the sweet mango one. \n\nAs a diner, sometimes I love having the choice of creating different flavors for my meal. But in some instances, I need the chef to do the directing. The multitude of dipping chutneys was very confusing. I know that people have different preferences, but it would have been nice if one chutney paired well consistently with one dosa or uttapam, like a wine pairing. There was a lot going on with flavors already and to throw in so many things was a little overwhelming - in the end, everything started to taste the same. I also didn't care too much for the mango lassi - it looks better than it tastes. We saw a couple people have this at other tables, but the yogurt was too thick for my liking. Despite my complaints, Dosa is a top-notch restaurant. The staff is very professional and it shows that they put a lot of effort into their food.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

No one greeted me when I entered, so I decided to find my party on my own. When I took a step towards the dining area was when staff decided that they wanted to acknowledge my presense and get up off a bar stool in a \"whoa-whoa not so fast\" manner. \n\nLuckily the food made up for a rather unpleasant entrance- we ordered the channai chicken, cochin calamari, South Indian moons, mango habanero dosa, and prawn masala with coconut rice.\n\nThe dosa was amazing and fi-yah! The waiter was like \"Are you suuure? Let me have you sample the paste first before you go and order that.\" After tasting the paste, we went for it. I could handle the spiciness, but my dear friend was near tears. All I can say is.... proceed with caution*\n\nBoth channai chicken (did not look like the pictures posted on here...was a little disappointed) and cochin calamari starters tasted delicious and my faves of the whole meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-26", "description": "This! This is what I have been looking for in Chicago -- South Indian food that makes me whip my hair back and forth (just whip it). Dosa, I have a concussion because I have been whipping my hair back and forth since I ate here (and dry eye syndrome for weeping that you are so far away from me).\n\nTo begin with, Dosa is so on top of it, I ate here during a SF heat wave. You heard me. Evidently, things like 'air conditioning' are unheard of in (some? many?) SF restaurants. So, I was fortunate enough to be walking the streets like a hooker during these hot times in the city. What to eat on a hot day? Indian! So, the fact that I loved the experience despite sweating like a wh0re in church really says something about the quality (and company).\n\nI discovered Dosa thanks to one of my oldest friends with whom I'd recently re-connected (later in the evening, one of my best buddies and his gal pal joined us). Psyched to be catching up, I ignored the menu for a while to just sit and talk. But, talking can only take me so far. I needed food. And, we got it. Before I chat up the food, though, I need to give much thanks to our server. She was helpful and present without being hovering or obtrusive. Nicely done. Check this spread:\n\nCalamari sauteed in coconut milk and served with greens -- succulent. Each bite burst with flavor. To do the dish justice, couple the meat with the milk with the greens. Perfection. It got the point that even though we hadn't seen each other in years, my friend and I sat in silenced and grubbed on the octopus;\n\nPrawns with coconut rice, chile, coriander, and more good stuff -- ridiculous. These prawns had been living the good life; they were huge. Their natural sweetness when added to the spice of the chile and coriander created a party in my mouth. The coconut rice dulled the heat enough to leave amazing flavor on the plate and in my belly; and\n\nCilantro Mint Masala Dosa. So, this is what dosa is supposed to taste like. I'd had a dosa experience in Chicago that... wasn't like this. I loved it. I loved every bite. The crepe was flaky, the sambar was interesting without being overpowering, the chutneys were a taste and texture success, and the mint/cilantro went brilliantly with the potatoes and onions.\n\nI washed down all this yummy food with a couple of glasses of Chilean rose and I couldn't have been happier. It had been years since I'd seen my friend. It had been years since I'd eaten delicious Indian food. I had *never* had memorable South Indian food. Everything blended perfectly on that hot summer day. Dosa is made of win.", "author": "Johnny T."}

Sadly, I honestly can't give you all the technical names of these dishes.. but what bodes well for a restaurant is that a naiive indian food eater like me can order about 7 random appetizers and dishes and like each and every one of them. \n\nThe cocktails were delicious - they have a full bar, or my FAVORITE which was a make your own cocktail - you describe to the waitress what you want and they bring out a surprise. this can quickly get dangerous because I asked for a sweet and tangy drink that packs a strong punch! \n\nOverall - next time around i'll pay attention to more of what we ordered, but definitely would come back!

She is vegetarian and we have both had many many Indian meals together and apart from hole in the wall to uber upper end.  She married an Indian man and he just calls it 'food' 8), but she and I have a ritual of Indian dinner every time we see each other, which isn't often.  We hesitated because she and her husband had planned to go here the next day ... she felt like she'd be cheating on him ... but I convinced her that it would be no waste to go two days in a row - plus she could go to the one on Fillmore for comparison.  Just perfection! We LOVE dosas and the variety here is amazing, each one is truly unique and yummy.  The coconut chutney is amazing, light, crunchy, cool.  My all time favorite snack is the Dahi Wada (which are little rice dumplings in yogurt sauce with tamarind drizzled on top).  The Dahi Wada's here are very small compared to ones I've had other places, but they are delicate, almost fluffy and I could eat them every day!  The cocktails are artisinal, the atmosphere hip but warming comfortable.  The portions are small for the price (like if rice comes with your dish, it's like a half of a cup shaped sweetly with a garnish of cartelized onions on top) but you don't leave there feeling gorged (unless you went whole hog ordering tons of things, which is easy to do).  The smaller portions allow you to order more and taste more, so I think this is actually a bonus.  We left feeling very very satisfied and even a little giddy. p.s. they give unlimited papadum!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-26", "description": "Came here for SF Restaurant Week 2017 as a group of 4. We ordered the family-style restaurant week menu, which consisted of 8 courses (3 small plates, 3 entrees, and 2 desserts) to be shared among the group. Food wise, this place is amazing - really nice complex flavors, great dosa, and interesting South Indian cuisine. However, I want to point out the portion sizes for the restaurant week menu are NOT the same as for the regular menu. So when you compare the price of something on the RW menu to what it would cost on the regular menu, you may not be getting the same amount of food. They portion out the RW items per person, but to be honest as a group of four we received some of the dishes in small bowls that looked like they would be more appropriate for a party of two. The same dish off the regular menu was much larger (that we saw at other people's tables). So, I would say that overall I'd recommend trying the RW menu if you're a group of 2 since you'll get to experience a lot of variety, but if you have a larger party you may end up getting more bang for your buck food-wise (although perhaps less variety) if you order off the a la carte menu. That said, I'll probably come back.", "author": "J L."}

Going at an earlier time is usually less noisy and not as crowded, so its a good suggestion to go for an early evening dinner.  The food here is rather good and they have a lot of variety to choose from which is unfortunate to have been dampened by all the other parts of my experience. \nSo, since the food is pretty good, if you want to try this place try to go earlier so that you can enjoy it more without all the little annoyances that come along with eating there at high traffic time.\n\nThe owner is one dedicated guy!

Right amount of tanginess, thickness and proportion of vegetables. Innovative dishes like fried upma are very nice too. Their decoration with chutneys is impressive too.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is very good. The waitresses and waiters were very kind and understanding.

Our food arrived very quickly (too quickly, in my opinion), which meant their assembly-line kitchen was simply cranking out dishes, not putting care into each.

The menu looked really good and we can select four dishes for $34.95.  Seemed really reasonable.  I remembered what I ate but don't know what it is called.  The only thing I have to say is that it is pretty spicy.  I love spicy food but this has a whole new meaning to spicy.  It was good and very tasty.  I was impressed that I could actually enjoy Southern Indian cuisine.  Scary thought too.\n\nBut when it came to for the dessert, I ordered what looked like a fried donuts soaked in sugary water-like.  It was horrible.  It was awfully sweet and hurts my tooth just biting into it.  I felt like I had a cavity right there and then.  The entrees were decent but just pass on the dessert.\n\nTheir services lack a lot as well.  It happened to be a very warm night that nite and where we were sitting literally had no venitlations.  We kept asking them to please increase the fan.  Their responses were that is as far as it will go.  Then half an hour later, we noted those fans were going so fast.  WTH?!!!!!

Naturally we were disappointed with the service, but we didn't have to say anything: the Manager walked over (I think his name is Leo - thank you Leo!), apologized profusely and deducted the glass of wine and the main course that took long to arrive off our check.

That's fine. I didn't mind,  I got the Masala Dosa. It was good. Not as good as I remember, but still good. About 15 mins into my nice relaxing meal, the manager and a disgruntled waitress sat down one table down from me and have a very lengthy, sort of loud conversation about her work issues, how to handle her section, up selling, getting along with her coworkers. This went on for about 30 mins. I tried to ignore it, but I just kept hearing an employee complaining/discussing issues with her manager and the longer it went on, the more tense I got and the more I was reminded about my long, miserable work day. With each complaint, Each bite started to taste less fulfilling :( I'm sure this probably and anomaly and not a reflection on the food, but, man, that meal was not fun. I don't know if my stomach was getting upset from the spicyness of the sumbar or the screeching of the waitress-manager complaint session in my left ear. \n\nIt wasn't intentional or malicious, just inconsiderate of the customers experience.

We ordered the onion rava dosa (hey, we're Indian. we love onions) and spicy mung masala. Both were good but I liked the onion rava dosa more. The sambar and coconut chutney were delicious. I even  took seconds of the sambar, which almost never happens (they were nice to give us seconds of the sambar for free). \n\nI really want to go back and try some of the other unique dosas since there are so many options. \n\nThe only slightly annoying thing was that I made reservations for 8:30 and my whole party showed up but we weren't seated until closer to 9.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-29", "description": "What an opportunity it was to celebrate the end of 2009 with fellow Yelpers Manabu M, Amy C, Tom R, Cassie J, Dorothy C and her husband Peter, Bradley N and wife Camelia, and Rinky A and husband Mike. It was a momentous occasion for Elite and soon-to-be-Elite members to break bread at Dosa. We helped Manabu to celebrate his second month anniversary as a Yelper, scheduled a New Year's lunch with Tom R, and for the rest I can tell a story about each person based on our interpersonal relationships and from following their reviews. As people took turns to stress the inclusive nature of this event compared to those that required the Elite status, I glanced across the table and knew exactly how we became friends through Yelp and the relationship we have developed over time regardless of age, profession, educational background, and other visible markers that often set us apart in this divided world. \n\nAlthough Dosa wasn't initially our first choice, it turned out to be a fabulous venue for such an event. From wall to wall the place was clean, spacious, and filled with fresh vibrant orange and brown d\u00e9cor with a good mix of natural and artificial lighting. Seated by the corner right behind the bar, our group had plenty of room and privacy to work with. We started off with a slew of appetizers to share and later each person had their main course individualized.\n\nDahi batata puri: Small hallow crispy breads that came with yogurt, potatoes, mint, and tamarind chutneys. It was a one-bite sensation with the entire bread collapsing to let the fillings run wild. It was decent.\n\nDahi vada: A beautifully presented yogurt with tamarind and mint smothered on top of lentil dumplings. Some people didn't discover the lentil dumplings at first since they were well hidden but I thought the dish was okay. I'm not too big on dishes served chilled and it was a bit heavier in taste than the rest.\n\nBhel puri: Amy C told me that this dish tasted like a mix of instant noodles and spices and I have to agree in terms of its texture. It came with an exciting mix of mango, potatoes, tomatoes, onions and other seasoning and it was crunchy and delightful.\n\nPani puri: Another set of small crispy breads where we had to manually poke a hole in the middle and fill it with spoons of chickpeas, mung beans, and potatoes before filling mint and tamarind water to capacity. I probably like this appetizer the most as the fillings had a lot of substance while the mint and tamarind water brought a refreshing sour and mint balance to bring it all together. Yum yum.\n\nFor the main course, I had the chicken curry special and it was fresh and creamy without it being unnecessarily oily. Chicken pieces were generous with lots of flavor and seasoning. The slight kick added flavor to a generous serving of coconut basmati rice. I thought the rice was not as good as the one at Burma SuperStar, but it was still a powerful sweet-spicy combination. Additionally, I also had a taste of Amy C's eggs dosa which is what they specialize in brunch. The eggs were nicely scrambled with tomatoes and onions with a fluffy external layer of savory dosa to keep the fillings together. Her side of coconut and tomatoes chutney was mildly spicy and creamy delicious.\n\nService was excellent. Our water was constantly refilled and our server Lindsay was very knowledgeable and attentive. Not sure what we had worked out with them prior to lunch, but they also charged us for cutting the Saint Honore cake and plates which was an unexpected detail to note. From a personal standpoint, I have to agree with Tom R and Bradley N that their food could be spicier, but I also saw several people at the end of my table who really struggled with what they were having. This said, I thought their culinary purpose was the necessary medium for a large group like ours. \n\nFinally, I would remiss without thanking Maybelline C for organizing this event. May and her husband Marc have been fabulous to work with and it was troubling to learn about her illness on the morning of the lunch. Despite her illness, her efforts to coordinate up to the moment of the event were significant in making it a success. With May being the face of our current and future events, I have no doubt that people will continue to gather and redefine for themselves what Yelp is really all about. As for Dosa, I would absolutely love to return for your brunch items. 4.5 stars for the overall experience. \n\nHave a Yelpalicious 2010, everyone!", "author": "Daniel L."}

It's basically deep fried chicken straws with a yogurt dip.  \n\nMasala Dosa - This is the most basic dosa, with potatoes and spices.  The three dipping sauces were fab.  I loved the sauce that came in the bigger bowl, not sure what it was called.  The coriander sauce was also tasty.  Definitely use the sauces.  I started eating the papadum (Indian chips) with these three sauces.  \n\nSpicy Lamb with lemon rice - This dish is rather spicy, but that's how I like it.  It's not as spicy as vindaloo, but close.  The lamb chunks were tender and the sauce was thick and flavorful.  \n\nAll in all, the meal was delicious.  I would get one app, a dosa, and one entree for two people.

But I'm putting together a list of some of my favorite places in the Mission for a friend, so a-yelping I go.\n\nWhen this place opened a number of years ago, it was impossible to get a table. You'd wait over an hour. It's still packed now, even on a Thursday. But by some miracle, we happened to get seats at the bar within 5 minutes. And I got to introduce two friends to their first dosas. That in itself was worth the price of admission. It was also interesting to try to describe a dosa in French to someone who hasn't had one before. South Indian crepe? South Indian burrito? \n\nYes, Dosa does go out on a California cuisine limb, and have distinctly non-Indian varieties of dosas and uttapams, but that is what we love about San Francisco, isn't it? We don't leave well enough alone. We mix and match. We put our own stamp on things. We try to make what was good enough just a little bit better. That is what we do.\n\nAnd after having travelled to India, I can say that the dosas and sambar are great. The uttapams are great. After having eaten about a half-dozen dosas this year, I got the uttapam sampler. All of the different uttapams were so delicious that it seemed like almost a shame to dunk them in the sambar.\n\nGluten-free notes: Dosas and uttampams are naturally gluten free.

I guess that's his job. He also thought that I ate fast, \"praising\" my hungry self for pounding down my food. Excuse me for enjoying my food.Definitely felt judged for not dressing nice enough as well but such is life. \n\nThe chai tasted like burnt kheer, hardly spiced and no tea leaf flavor. Literally worse than any \"chai tea latte\" I've had anywhere else.\n\nAll in all, I had a decent experience. The place seems to cater to a largely White clientele, with spicing being relatively mild. That being said, I would come back for the dosa but I would definitely prefer other joints a little farther in San Jose or Sunnyvale that don't sacrifice authenticity for novelty.", "author": "Radhika P."}

The green mango and paneer dosa is delicious and I have always loved their uttapams. One of my favorite things here is actually a side dish--the dahi rice. Yes, dahi rice is a simple and seemingly unglamorous dish (yogurt, rice), but Dosa does it so well, so creamy, and so perfect. Great with their hotter dishes--I scoop it with the poppadums they bring to the table :)\n\nI also like their drinks here--cocktails are good and the wine they serve pairs well with the south indian flavors.\n\nNote: When they say something on the menu is spicy, it really really is.

Typically, I don't like sitting at the bar, especially when you're paying this much for a meal, but it worked out in our favor. We were able to pick the brain of the bartenders and ended up with some really great entrees. \n\nWe started off our meal with drinks: the Port of Call and the Ginger Ante. The Port of Call was like a hot, naughty, spiked tea with tons of alcohol and a kick! The Ginger Ante was acidic, and refreshing. \n\nFor an appetizer, we tried the Chennai chicken. This dish was like Japanese chicken karaage: battered strips of juicy, tender chicken with a creamy sauce. It was really delicious, but slightly overpriced for the portion.\n\nThe bartender recommended that we get the Paper Masala: a thin, pliable and crispy version served with spicy mashed potatoes, onions, cashew nuts and various chutneys. When our paper masala arrived at the bar, I think half of the restaurant was looking at us. It was GINORMOUS. (see my yelp profile pic!) Imagine a crispy crepe the size of a saxophone placed in front of you. Did I mention it was HUGE?! And let me tell you, in this case, size does matter. We thought that there was no way we could finish it but it was so delicious that we did. The crispy texture of the dosa was the perfect foundation for the savory spiced potatoes and sweet chutneys. \n\nNext, I had quite possibly the best lamb curry I have ever eaten: Tamil Lamb Curry. The lamb was impossibly tender, but not faling apart. It was in a savory sauce of fennel, tomatoes, poppy seeds, caramelized onions and spices. The recommended side of lemon rice was a light and refreshing contrast to the subtle gameyness of the lamb and the earthy spices of the sauce. \n\nWe ended with the Fresh Cococut Custard Cake, but I wasn't that thrilled with it. \n\nOverall, Dosa lived up to the hype for me.

Our bartender-server was attentive and provided some great suggestions for our meal. \n\nWe started off with some cocktails, the Port of Call and the Ginger Ante. The Port of Call, a hot (as in temperature) drink that tasted like spiked tea, was surprisingly good. The Ginger Ante was refreshing and had a mild finish. \n\nOur meal started off with the Chennai Chicken, which was well seasoned and moist, similar to Japanese chicken karage. My only gripe is that it is somewhat overpriced for the portion. Our main entrees were the Tamil Lamb Curry accompanied with lemon rice, and the Paper Masala dosa. I'm by no means an expert in Indian cuisine, but I will have to say that the lamb curry with the lemon rice is one of the tastiest curries I've had, probably ever. The lamb chunks were perfectly moist and the curry rich and nutty. The Paper Masala dosa was quite the eye catcher, as it appeared to be huge crepe folded into a cone stretching about 1.5 feet across the plate. It tasted wonderful, and went well with the Masala (a very well seasoned mash potato) and the various dipping accompaniments. \n\nFor dessert, we tried the Fresh Coconut Custard cake. My girlfriend wasn't wow'd by it, but it grew on me as I kept eating. I enjoyed the texture of the coconut that lined the bottom of the cake. \n\nTotal damage came out to $90 including tip.

Tasty tasty stuff that dosa, I was impressed. The flavor of the filling was there without being covered up by the wicked spicyness. Sometimes when food is hot like this the flavor of the ingredients are lost in the burn. Not so in this case. The \"fire broth\" soup was simple and a good starter, again well played on the spicy. I love Indian spicy done right. Have you ever seen someone have a moderate allergic reaction to something? Sweating, redness in the face, tears, runny nose, and a general look of despair? That's just how I look when I'm finally eating Indian food that I think is just right on the spiciness. Yea, this physical proof work out really well for me, especially with the ladies... :/\n\nI only had one concern, and I will address this on my next trip. My food was really good, so of course I wanted to I try a chunk of my friend's dosa. She went for the Spinach & Fennel Pooriyal, I was stoked to try it as the description is not very close to mine at all, so I'm thinkin' \"Sweet, I get to try two pretty different dosas\". Hmmm not so much, yes I could pull in a slight spinach flavor but for the most part.. her's tasted a lot like mine. I'm not talking the chutney and sambar, I know those are the same, but the filling in hers was pretty close and equally spicy (even though there was no note of \"spicy\" in the description). On a financial note, $10 seems reasonable to me for the dish. \n\nTo the vegans out there they have a very helpful allergen chart where you can cross reference any dish on the menu to see if it has dairy. Very clear, very easy. The servers will be glad to explain dishes that can be altered to fit the vegan diet too, they seemed to know their stuff.\n\nSo I'm gonna go all MythBusters and roll back and try something as far away from the description of my last dish as possible. If it comes out and it's amazing AND unique, then *wipes sweat of forhead* the 4 star stands. If it turns out to taste a lot like rest.... I maybe won't be so sure anymore.

Every dish we ordered was heavily flavored by many different spices, which is to be expected from this type of cuisine. I thought it was amazing (unfortunately, the rest of my party wasn't partial to such flavors). One person said that the first dish we shared (South Indian Moons) was a pleasant surprise, but as the meal went on, she didn't like that each successive dish also had a bit of a kick.\n\nBe warned, if you don't particularly enjoy spicy dishes. If you do though, everything tasted as good as it looked. For reference, I ordered a three-course meal with cochin calamari (goes nicely with the included uttapam), trumpet mushrooms uttapam, and seasonal vegetable curry. The rest of my party ordered a three-course meal with hyderabadi shammi kebabs, trumpet mushrooms uttapam, and prawn masala with Louisiana shrimp (the included seafood is quite large), as well as the daily special (mahi mahi - looked quite good), and the channa bhatura (the included bread is huge, but shrinks greatly in seconds.\n\nOne thing, though: don't order both the south indian moons and an uttapam from the three-course meal as the dishes are almost identical. I'd imagine that the same goes for a dosa from the three-course meal and something from the Dosa section of the menu. I would have preferred to try something else, in addition to the uttapam.\n\nAlso, the place is quite small and cramped, as is typical of establishments in San Francisco.

There was a good amount of diners already in but we were seated fine. Our waitress came and gave us the quick run through on the Dosa menu and after taking our orders, it took around 10 minutes for all of our dishes to come out. I chose the Lamb Keema because it seemed like the only meat dish on the Dosas menu! I didn't notice until I saw that my friends weren't eating any meat dishes. The dosa itself was huge. A gigantic crepe. It came rolled like a poster on my plate. There was also a delicious spicy dipping sauces and two chutneys on the plate additionally to the mound of lamb. The sauce was too spicy for some friends and the waitress informed us that there is no mild sauce and that the only thing she could do was to replace it with a yogurt sauce. I found that odd that there wasn't any mild soup dipping sauce in an Indian restaurant. I for one found that spicy dipping soup to be so good! I thought $15 was a little high for the amount of lamb you receive, but it was pretty good so it can slide by this one time. The menu overall is very pricey with the lowest priced item on the menu being around $9. I never knew vegetarian food to be so expensive.......", "author": "Alex T."}

When we arrived there was a large party of Indian people already eating there, which we took to be a good sign of quality and authenticity.\n\nWe first had southern Indian in Denver, Colorado (where there is a great place called Masalaa which serves wonderful vegetarian dosas http://www.masalaausa.com/). We would even drive over an hour from another city to eat there since it was so popular with my boyfriend. But after moving away, it has now been over 2.5 years since having a proper dosa.\n\nFor his birthday last February I even tried (and failed) to make them myself...\n\nAnyhow, we started off with the mint lemonade and mango juice. The lemonade came with fresh mint leaves and the mango juice was perfect - sweet, thick and refreshing. Next we were served crisp papadums and before we could get started our dinner was already arriving. \n\nHe orded the traditional Paper Masala Dosa and I got the Lamb \"Keema\". With both orders our curries were served on the side rather then inside the dosa which was fine for us and made it more convenient to share. My minced lamb was fantastic as were the  chutneys (one was a tomato and the other a cilantro-mint dipping sauce). Our dosas were large and magnificent. They tasted wonderful and were thin and crispy. \n\nThe service was great - quick, efficient, and friendly. The host was welcoming and let us pick a seat, our waters were refilled a number of times, our dinners came out together and piping hot, and the waiter was willing to answer questions and didn't act impatient or rushed.\n\nWe were both impressed and definitely are planning a return trip.

I got the tasting menu which is a great deal for $35.\n\nCochin Calamari: I love Calamari in general, and wanted to try an Indian twist on it. This was good calamari, but not that innovative. 3/5 stars\n\nSouth Indian Corn Soup: This was great. Not hot at all, and just the right amount of spices. We liked this so much I tried Googling for similar recipes at the table. 5/5 stars\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa: My parents always dragged me to this crappy Dosa place back in Ottawa, and I've hated Dosas ever since. Fortunately the dish has been redeemed with this rendition. The filling was great, and the truffle oil took it over the top. The bread wasn't overly spicy or bitter like Dosa bread can be sometimes. 4/5 stars\n\nPaneer & Peas Dosa: Paneer is one of the few vegetarian Indian dishes I like (it's freaking cheese, everyone loves cheese). The dish had the flavor of paneer throughout, yet was complex enough to stay interesting with all the other stuff like the spiced peas, filling, etc. 5/5 stars\n\nTamil Lamb Curry: Very good. I find in lamb curries, the curry has to be strong enough to balance the gamey taste of the lamb. The curry in this dish was great. The lemon rice matched it perfectly and was great in itself. 5/5 stars\n\nFresh Coconut Custard Cake: With all the interesting inventions they had, I couldn't leave without trying dessert. Most Indian restaurants have the usual Gulab Jamun, Rasmali, etc. The cake was great, although you should like spices in your dessert if you want to get this. If you like Mexican Hot Chocolate, you'd probably like this. 5/5 stars\n\nFinally, unlike most Indian restaurants, the inside is modern looking and really quite nice, with lots of dark woods and intimate lighting.

I almost had to actually bail out on the invitation, because I'd told my friend during the party's planning stages that my budget was pretty tight and I could only go out if it was somewhere cheap.\n\nDosa is many things, but it is NOT cheap.  I ended up going anyway because my lovely friend paid for my dinner (she really wanted me to be there, the sweetheart).  That said, when I go somewhere as pricey as this, I have pretty high expectations.  \n\nIn many ways, those expectations were well-met.  For starters, the tiny restaurant was crowded and busy, but there seemed to be TONS of staff, constantly running every which way while managing to be efficient rather than frantic.  All the service was very prompt, questions asked were graciously answered, finicky eaters (me, vegan) were accommodated, glasses kept full, enjoyment levels frequently checked, etc etc.  At one point, the table next to us was vacated by a family with a baby.  Three different people working simultaneously had the table cleared and wiped, seats cleaned, and floor swept in bare seconds.  So the staff get 5 stars from me.  The presentation was also stunning.  Everything looked amazing, down to the gorgeous stainless steel presspot of coffee.  \n\nHowever, there is a reason that Dosa only gets 3 stars instead of 5, and that comes down to the food itself:  it just wasn't THAT amazing.  It was tasty, but my Tenderloin neighborhood Indian joints have food as tasty or better for a fraction of the price.  Sure, the setting and everything else was a great deal more upscale, but I just expected more authentic flavors and felt that the spice level had pretty much been toned down.  We ordered family-style and shared a HUGE number of small plates and entrees in our large group, and even the 'spiciest' dish just wasn't that spicy.\n\nI guess if someone else was paying again and really wanted to go, I'd go back, but otherwise if I'm going to throw down teens to twenty on an entree alone (if you get curry and a 'side') I'd rather go to Gracias Madre.", "author": "Keegan R."}

It's not that we haven't found really delicious food here, but it's just nothing has been better than what I have had previously.\n\nDosa, was perfect.  It probably had a edge as I've only had South Indian food once before with an Indian friend and did not find it particularly wonderful.  Dosa completely changed that.  \n\nWe got the tasting menu for $35, which btw, what a great deal.  \nCalamari appetizer - divine, perfectly cooked texture and the taste was unique but amazing, definitely not your typical calamari.  It was my favorite dish of the night, if I had to choose.  \n\nWatermelon salad - just because it sounded, well, interesting, and it was very refreshing, the combination of the sweetness of the watermelon really balanced the other Indian spices\n\nDosas - we had both the white truffle dosa, and the paneer dosa (cheese).  both were delicious and came with three sauces.  I think the most amazing thing is the fact that you really do get layers of flavors, especially with the sauce, where your initial taste buds are stimulated by the sauces, then by, for example the flavor of the truffle.  Usually, with sauces, you just taste the combination of the food and sauce at once, but there was such a clear layer of different flavors that explode in your mouth gradually, which was amazing (like that scene from Ratatouille!!!)\n\nLamb tamil - very soft lamb, absolutely cooked to the perfect degree where the meat was just coming apart very easily, delicious.  comes with this citrus rice, which takes a bit of getting used, I couldn't really get used to it and probably would ask for a milder seasoned rice next time\n\nPrawn curry - the curry was absolutely delicious, one of the best I've ever had.  I do have to say the shrimp was a bit underseasoned, which is weird given the sauce is amazing.  it was almost that you taste this amazing sauce, and as you get into the texture of the shrimp, which was perfect, the flavor falls  bit flat... \n\nService was absolutely amazing.  Staff was very friendly and attentive. Incredibly fast service and your water glass is always full.   \n\nAmbiance also perfect.\n\nI think I will become a regular here, as it is just a block away!

However, it's actually more reasonably priced than I assumed, and the decor is not all that fancy inside. It's a hybrid between a creperie and a tapas restaurant ...lots of small plates ...mostly variations on the South Indian dosa, which is really a savory crepe, and the uttapam, which is the dosa's thicker pancake-style cousin. It doesn't matter to me that much as I found it all pretty darn tasty.\n\nI came with my good friend Mary, who was adjusting well to her newly unemployed state as are many of my friends in this most somber economy. Neither of us were familiar with South Indian cuisine, so our order was strictly shot from the hip. To our amazement, it turned out we were culinary marksmen no matter how blind our shots fired. First, we tried the $10 Masala Uttapam, which had spiced potatoes, onions and cashews. It came with little cups of dipping sauces ...a coconut milk one, a tomato one, and something called sambar, which is a thick lentil-bean mixture.\n\nThen we went for the $8 Samosas 'North & South', which were huge with the Southern one filled with caramelized onions and vegetables and the Northern one with spiced potatoes. Delicious. However, our favorite dish was the $14 Channa Bhatura, which is a garbanzo bean masala accompanied by a puffy, savory wheat bread. The combination of flavors was just right with just enough on each plate to satisfy us. Clearly there are other dishes to try on future visits, and I indeed look forward to them. My one minor complaint is that the place gets packed awfully quick and expect to be grazed frequently if your back is facing the unmonitored walkway in front of the bar.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...a genuine treat and a nice intro into South Indian dishes ...Naan n' Curry will become Naan n' Phooey if you come here\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars... on the dark side and rather crowded during the evening\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...quite stellar and patient with our Yankee-level questions about the menu\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely want to try a dosa next time, and there will be a next time", "author": "Ed U."}

Lentils, same size.\n\nThe samosas were ok....take one of the paper masala side dishes and stuff it in an empenada. Voila! Now add 2 sauces (cilantro & chutney) and now you have a samosa meal.\n\nMy favorite entree of the night was the organic Kerala chicken & coconut rice. The chicken and slices of tomatoes & green beans were covered in a slightly spicy green sauce. The coconut rice was okay, had the same consistency of an Uncle Ben's type of rice...I wasn't impressed. The taste of the chicken however made up for the rice. I would definitely reorder this again.\n\nOverall, good spot. It tends to get crowded, but a little crowded for my own good maybe.

However, yesterday's dining experience at DOSA has made me a DOSA fan!!\n\nWe shared -\n-Rava Onion Dosa - The consistency of this dosa was just right - not too crispy and not too soft. There were enough onions and cilantro mixed in with the batter to add some extra crunch and flavor. \n-Paper Masala Dosa - Huge paper dosa that comes with potato masala, chutney, and sambhar. The masala tasted great with the dosa and was not too bland or oily. \n-South Indian Moons - 5 mini uttapums. These were good but not great. I think the paneer uttapum was the worst - the paneer did not even taste like paneer! \n\nI would definitely come back!", "author": "Geetanjali J."}

It's some solid Indian food served in a nice but unpretentious setting.  The prices are extremely reasonable, the service is friendly, and the company... well, when you're hanging with friends, it's always all good. \n\nI enjoyed my samples of the huge cross section of dishes we ordered and served up family style.  The appetizers were very tasty, the paneer roti wrap was quite good, and the chick-pea stew drove me to seconds and thirds.  The highlight of the night for me (aside from my excellent dining companions) was the roti with potato and some form of sauce (also with potatoes).  Good stuff.  We indulged in the special, a whole fish marinated overnight in garlic then fried to a crispy blackish-brown. It was tasty and required some serious work to debone.  We did a damn fine job of getting a much meat as possible off that fish, eyeballs and all.  The meat was tender and amazing but the exterior had a somewhat burnt taste.\n\nAll in all, I was impressed but not blown away.  I enjoyed all of the dishes just fine, but felt they lacked some form of depth/complexity that I am used to in truly amazing Indian food.  Maybe I'm just not used to authentic southern Indian, I have never been there, so who knows?  I do believe that it's very, very solid food. Just not 5-star solid. \n\nThe wine list also scores some stars, with a wide and diverse variety of red offerings in a very reasonably priced range.  We scored a pretty decent bottle of Malbec for somewhere in the $30's.\n\nThe desserts were again very good but not insanely good. The highlights of our spread were the little donut balls in syrup and the rice pudding in rose water. Those were both amazing. \n\nWould I go back? Absolutely. Should I go back? Probably. With so many 5-star reviews from so many of my trustworthy cohorts, I feel like maybe I missed something. I guess until then, I'll just have to guess...", "author": "Don B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-03", "description": "Went to Dosa last night after a few years, and it confirmed what I had previously thought.  Great ambiance and presentation, mediocre food.  Though I appreciate the thought, Indian food isn't about presentation.  It's about flavor!  I have never seen prettier Indian food in my life, but I have tasted much better.  And it's really expensive for what it is.  Here is the breakdown:\n\nDahi papdi chat: 2/5 - This tends to be one of my favorite chats.  It is usually loaded with delicious chutneys, tomatoes and onions, and is swimming in dahi (yogurt), so that every bite is flavor country.  Not so here.  It looked very artistic, but chat by its nature is meant to be messy.  There was not nearly enough dahi, chutney, tomatoes and onions.  We added our own to make it taste better.  Even still, it was far from the best papdi chat I've had.  \n\nFish pakoras: 3.5/5 - These were pretty good.  We got 5 large pakoras, which were fried and then crusted with something delicious.  They are served with garlic and onion chutneys.  Not going to lie, I didn't really care for the garlic chutney (use it sparingly), but the onion chutney was tasty.\n\nUttapam moon: 2.5/5 - This was a collection of 5 uttapams (small, savory latka-type pancakes, with a variety of ingredients cooked in... kind of like omelets but with no eggs), served with 2 different chutneys.  There was a tomato chutney and a chickpea chutney.  I thought most of the uttapams were just ok.  I really liked the onion one and the paneer one was decent, but the rest were mediocre.  You can get MUCH better Uttapam at Udupi Palace 1/2 a block away.\n\nChana Battura: 4/5 - The chana was tasty!  I am a huge fan of chana masala and Dosa's did not disappoint.  The batura was unfortunately over-cooked and had we not been in a hurry, we probably would have sent it back.  All in all, this was my favorite dish of the evening.\n\nWhile Dosa is unsurpassed in its presentation, the attractiveness of its food comes at the expense of its flavor.  This might be fine for someone who is into blander foods or who doesn't have much experience with Indian food, but I don't think I would return to Dosa again anytime soon, except for for drinks.  The food is just meh and it is VERY expensive for what it is.  There's no need to go to Dosa when Udupi Palace less than 1/2 a block away.  The food there is MUCH better and it is WAY cheaper.", "author": "Julie S."}

I noticed some people were unlucky enough to be squeezed four to one tiny table, but it didn't seem to bother them.\n\nSERVICE: iffy. Sometimes I felt ignored (like when we wanted to order, but couldn't find our waitress) and sometimes I felt like a queen (the busboys were pretty good about keeping water glasses filled and taking away plates).\n\nFOOD: So much DAT gluttony! Dosa offers a four course DAT menu for $35... it was a lot more food than any of us were expecting. What I would order again and also what I would avoid at all cost:\n\nAppetizer:\n- ORDER - Chennai chicken: tender, juicy, with a spicy kick, these were yummy dipped in the yogurt sauce\n- AVOID - Lentil patty: This wasn't just swimming in yogurt sauce-- it was DROWNING.

I would choose this over any of the other dosas (we tried masala chutney, paneer + peas, and the uttapaam, which reminded me of a Korean seafood pancake)\n\nEntree:\n- ORDER: Tamil lamb or chicken curry: both were delicious and extra savory. The lamb was tender and had no hint of gameyness (probably because it was covered in spice!)\n\nDessert:\n- ORDER: Chocolate chai gelato: I'm sure any of their gelatos/sorbets would have been fine. If you MUST order dessert, go with one of these because...\n- AVOID: Gulab jamoon: I've learned from previous encounters that Indian sweets are SWEET. Tooth-achingly-practically-inedible SWEET. So I definitely avoided this particular dessert when it came time to choose. Maybe I wasn't firm enough in my description of the Indian idea of dessert, but all three of my dining companions decided to order this dessert (because they wanted to declare their love of balls?)... and probably bitterly regretted their choice. I don't think anyone finished even one third of one ball. \n\nOVERALL: If Dosa wasn't a 40min drive from me (and if I didn't have to prowl for parking in the Mission) I would probably come by to try a few more of their dosas and their bhatura.

I really liked it - something totally new - but tasty, spicy, and filling.\n\nThe decor is on par with most of the medium to high-end Mission restaurants, certainly date-worthy.

DOSA, both on Valencia and Fillmore, just is the place to enjoy good southern Indian dishes, good company, good wine and not to mention the cocktails. If you are like me who like to host and entertain visiting friends who share the common love for southern Indian dishes, DOSA is the place to take them to and to be seen! I hate it when so-called food reviewers ridicule with harsh words -- truth is no place is 100% perfect, no service is super duper excellent because this is a restaurant/bar and not a massage parlor! I can tell you the waiters at DOSA both at Valencia and Fillmore, have always been attentive, kind, and good to me and my guests or my dinner companion. The service they give is unrushed, unforced but natural. Yes they never bring a big fan to fan us while we look at the menu! But they treat us like how they want to be treated. If you have a bad experience here, I am sorry. Sometimes I like to see a waiter disrespecting a customer for disrespecting him! Yes it is a two way thing! You as a customer must respect your waiter if you want him or others to respect you! I am lucky, I've always been treated and respected well here. Let me take this opportunity to remind diners that the service here is good, and the atmosphere and the flavors here are truly modern classical southern Indian -- the dishes are the reasons why we Indian food lovers eat here and tip our waiters well. Now to the tart -- its Black Mission Fig Tart is its newest star for me and worth getting another mention this week -- it is pretty epic! Definitely deserving my double thumbs up.

My family was in town, and my husband-to-be and I had spent the weekend shuttling them around giving them a taste of SFs finest restaurants. Finally it was my choice: A mellow family dinner at a hip urban locale! Plus the price was right, since we'd be treating all weekend and funds were running low.\n\nI just had the most fun bridal shower ever and I selected Dosa as the finale to the evening based on yelper, Todo, and many other recommendations (like BFF Sharon M). I thought it was the perfect choice because of its convenient mission locale (good for people coming from all areas of the city) and it was good for my vegetarian family (so many options!), also because some of my family is always riding me about trying more spicy foods (they are basque after all) and I figured Indian food has a lot of nice spices. Little did I know these members of my family were really anti on the Indian food, so the dinner ended up being a total mess. Mostly because it's impossible for them to keep opinions to themselves and let everyone else enjoy. Sigh, but you know fam...you still love 'em.\n\nI was a bit annoyed starting off because we had a reservation, that I made months in advance, and we still waited quite a bit for our table. Also, the staff wasn't the friendlist, but neither were my guests so I would give them another shot (as I did with my guests!) \n\nDosa doesn't have just spicy curries. Which works out good for me because my gastroenterologist would not be pleased seeing my family history and all. I asked them what I could have that wouldn't be spicy and they selected a few items for me. Namely, the Dosas are what you should be ordering (hence the name). The fam on the other hand, ordered some of the spiciest dishes available and were visibly...and verbally... unhappy.  They ended up drinking too much and getting sick. I ended up getting sick from the all tension and the staff wasn't too good about rectifying the situation, they mostly threw up their hands, which was annoying because their recommendations for me were so on par. \n\nThe Dosa I had was really yummy, but it was so hard to enjoy.  I'm big on second chances, I can't base my whole opinion on this one off night, so I'm going to go back, especially for the brunches everyone raves about, but I won't go back with a group, it's just not the right setting.\n\nUPDATE: Came back for brunch with my husband, Sharon M, and Ian M and were very impressed. I think it was just an off night that we went there (mostly due to the people I was with). We enjoyed a non-vegetarian curry, the masala dosa, and the eggplant dosa. Nothing was spicy for weak little me! We also had these yummy things sharon and ian picked that you can only get at lunch and my husband used the words \"heck yes!\"", "author": "Nikki M."}

I ended up being an hour early. \n\nMy loverman met up with me and he went inside and asked if there was a way we could get seated early. I'm not sure but I think we did end up getting seated earlier. Neither of us were very hungry so my loverman asked if we could split the tasting menu but our waiter told us we couldn't because the menu was designed for only one person. We considered ordering two of the tasting menus but ultimately decided against it. I ended up ordering the Spring Dosa and he ordered the Egg Dosa with Cheese. We were then served a plate of chips or something. They were obviously deep fried so I didn't go near them. \n\nI'm always surprised at how fast service is at Indian restaurants. My Spring Dosa was freaking huge. It was cut into three pieces while my lovermans was just one gigantic wrap. I didn't really like any of the sauces it came with. The white one looked super fatty and I didn't even want to try it but I did at the request of my loverman. I really liked the Dosa and all the veggies looked really fresh. At one point a woman walked by and  asked me if what I was eating was the Dosa and I said yeah and she goes \"Oh I should've gotten that.\" Haha. \n\nI finished 2/3s of it and I was completely stuffed. I hate taking food home and I usually finish everything on my plate but I would've literally burst if I tried. I went to the bathroom at that point. When I came out, I had no idea how to exit. I looked behind both the curtains which both led to some type of storage area. I decided I would just wait for the person in the other bathroom to come out and follow them out but they never came out! It literally took me almost a good 10 minutes to figure out how to leave. Haha. It ended up being the door at the left. \n\nWhen I got back to my table, my loverman told me he asked them to bring us the dessert menu. Tiffany! Van always has room for dessert. Not in this case though. I didn't even bother looking at the dessert menu. \n\nThey offered to box up the rest of my meal for me. Something in the back of my mind told me they would wrap up the sauces for me and I knew I should've said something but I didn't.

Okay, okay, I'll tell you more about why this place should not be missed...\n\nGO SOUTH: It can be difficult to find South Indian fare since most Indian restaurants feature the more popular Northern cuisine. And secondly, it can be difficult to find South Indian faire that tastes good. Well, Dosa meets both requirements, and it does so better than I've ever found. Ever!!!\n\nSARDINES:  They do pack you in like sardines in this small Mission spot. Be prepared to know intimate details about your neighbor's life. But, it's all good. In fact, after my food arrives, I get so into the delicious bites that I forget about the love triangle squabble going on next to me!\n\nOH THE FOOD:  My recs after sampling my way through:\n\n*Chutney sampler: Slather your papadum in one of four chutneys - tamarind, dahi mint, sweet onion, and chile-garlic.\n*Rasam: Spicy tomato broth soup that is perfect to drink (yes, I drink it from the bowl, why bother with a spoon) or to dip your dosa in. \n*Pani Puri:  Small crispy breads filled with chickpeas and potatoes. A very interesting and tasty dish. \n *Masala Dosa:  Classic dosa served with a filling of potatoes, onions and cashews. I love savoring this one and dipping it in sambar. This item is my true love on the menu that I have to have. Oh, I'm craving it now!\n*Habanero-Mango Masala:  This one comes with a Warning Label!!! It's an intensely hot masala dosa spread up with a habanero chutney. I do love spicy, but this spicy is off the radar! I still crave it, so I've found a compromise where I get the masala dosa and get the habanero chutney on the side so that I can still get the spice without being pained. \n*Brunch drinks: The brunch drinks add a twist to the usual staples. They feature a Bloody Mary 'Curry' and Mimosas that can be served with the standard OJ or Pomegranate or Mango juice.\n*Brunch (never heard of Indian brunch before this place, but somehow it works): They feature brunch-y type foods with eggs in them.

The venue is very warm and comfortable is complemented by friendly staff who show great patience with the many folks who crowd in here for some authentic Indian cuisine. The dosas are delicious - large portions made with pretty authentic sambar / chutney (I could go there and just eat chutney all day...). I tend to prefer the masala dosa, as the masala is always filling, healthy, and reminds me of home.  The prices (especially for a good restaurant in SF) are very reasonable as well.

The hostess was very friendly about this and we were seated within 15 minutes (reasonable, it was pretty busy at the time!).\n\nThe waitress was very friendly. She explained every section of the menu and answered any questions we had.\n\nI ended up ordering the paper masala (recommended by a friend) and my boyfriend ordered the lamb curry. The paper masala was definitely different ... it was a huge, rolled up thin and crispy piece of ... I want to say pancake, but I dare not. Basically, it was thin, crispy and came with a bunch of dips and mashed potatoes. YUM! My boyfriend thought the curry was good, and the lemon rice he ordered on the side was tasty as well.\n\nThe curries are a bit pricy because they do not include the price of a starchy side (3 dollars for rice), but the paper masala was only $11.

We didn't make any reservation so had to wait for 20 mins but guess our timing was still good, we reached at 6:45, otherwise minimum wait is for 45 minutes.\nSo as were seated, we ordered VADA PAV's( staple maharashtrian appetizer), rasam( spicy lentil soup) and chennai chicken. They were all great and wasn't  typically indian style. Vada pav's were just AWESOME and so full of flavour.  The chutneys were so different and that adds to the taste.\n\nFor main course, we ordered Egg dosa, Mung dosa and the HABANERO MANGO dosa. Yes, those who have tried  the habanero-mango dosa know what i am talking about. It was so SPICYYYYYYYYYYYY!!\n\nAlthough I like spicy food but before coming to DOSA, wherever i have tried indian food, even if i request to make the disy spicy, the spice leve was always mild SO i ignored the warning on DOSA menu that the habanero dosa is very intense and guess what, even between 2 of us, we couldn't finish 1 habanero dosa with 4 portions of SWEET CURD and 6 glasses of water.\n\nIt is that spicy!! It's a big big NOOOOOO to HABANERO MANGO DOSA.\n\nI am not giving this place 5 only because the place is too small but the food is really great and worth trying.

There was a man at the front door who looked at me ruefully and then my husband said \"c'mon in fairness that was not a good example of Indian food.\" Finally being more rational I said Ok, I know that strip mall place was probably the worst example of Indian food so I should give it another go. We went it.\n\nI LOVED THE FOOD SO MUCH! We got lamb curry which was to die for and a dosa (honestly I don't remember which one other than it had marsala in it) and that was amazing too!!!

The man who was \"judging me\" outside when I was being a whiny bitch was apparently either the owner or manager, he came over and asked me if the food was alright. Very embarrassing!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-20", "description": "The most ridiculously over-priced and over-rated place I've ever been to. Being a native south Indian myself, calling this south Indian food is an insult in the face of south Indians worldwide. Of course, it's easy to get away with that technicality by calling it fusion cuisine, so I can't say anything about that. We went as a group of eleven people and they madeup a rule on the fly that a group of more than seven should do most of the orders from a limited choices three course menu (costing 40$ per person), where none of the options were what I wanted. \nFirst I thought, thank God, they did not insist that everyone in the group has to get a three course meal, as my wife is a light eater. I orded one three course meal for myself and some vada paavs and dosas for my wife. But after looking at their extremely small portion sizes, I realized my mistake.\nSpeaking of the food itself, the vada paavs were passable (South bay has better. Try ICB). The dosas themselves were alright (Paneer peas and mango habanero were our choices), although I must say the mango-habanero sauce was good and spicy. The \"Indian fruit chaat\" is what really made my blood boil. Some fruits with some Indian seasoning, salt and lemon on it somehow stands as a menu item on its own? The lotus kofta curry was laughably bad, with too much of Indian spices added to it that I couldn't even have two spoons of gravy (Btw, other than the Dosa, none of the items I mentioned were South Indian in any sense).\nAnd the worst part was the bill itself, which for 11 people, was my total one month rent for the studio I stayed in, when I first came into the bay area. And it got me wondering, I actually spent 55$ per person for what? The ambience was nothing close to any of the fine dining cuisines I've been to. The food was hardly south Indian. The only thing south Indian in the menu was the dosa which they use like crepes to wrap random things to create their menu items.\nMay be I am biased because of the multiple good options for south Indian restaurants available in South bay (Madras Cafe, Anjappar, Madurai Idli, Aachi appakadai and may be if none of those is open, even Saravana Bhavan). Or may be I was the odd man out in this place (seeing how there are so many good reviews already). Or may be this place works for ridiculously rich people who want to have an alternative for their daily routine of burning dollar bills, while claiming that they had Indian food. Or may be this is how South Indian food tailored for the American palette should taste like. But if you want to eat authentic south Indian food, look elsewhere. Although I must confess, if you want south Indian restaurants with a good ambience (I for one care more about how good the food tastes, more than the ambience), your choices are limited.", "author": "Sri V."}

Sorry, Dosa but you didn't really live up to the hype for me.  Ambiance wise, Dosa was really trendy with a busy bar, cool dim lights, and young yuppy crowd.  The food is different from your typical Indian curries.  Breaking down the food:\n\nCocktails:  I didn't get any but took sips of my friends'.  The Ginger Ante (10) was too bad while my friend thought the First Date (10) was way too strong and had to exchange it for another Ginger Ante.\n\nTamil Lamb Curry (18):  This was one pricey dish for a lukewarm, non-tender lamb in a non-distinct curry sauce.  Truth.\n\nRegular Dosa (3):  This giant, think crepe was used to eat with the curry.  Light and crispy, it is a highlight of the meal.\n\nMasala Chutney Dosa (10.5): was the best dish of the night.   A indian crepe filled with a potato-eggplant filling.  This was delicious.\n\nSouth Indian Moons (13.5): A sampler plate of Uttapam, smaller thicker versions of dosas that are more like pancakes.  These were not bad, but truthfully, I could not to much difference between the different types of fillings.  \n\nOverall, the food at Dosa is unique, but not quite scrumptious.

I had the spring dosa filled with shredded veggies that was mostly cabbage. The chutneys on the side were not as flavorful as I remember them being at the other Dosa location (Fillmore). Also, the sambar contained some long beans that were actually two hard to even chew or swallow. \n\nMy boyfriend got the habanero and mango dosa which was way too spicy for us to enjoy. In their defense, the server and menu warned that it was very hot and even offered to bring a sample of the filling so he could try it ahead of time. He didn't take the sample. If you are thinking about trying this dish definitely sample the filling ahead of time! I couldn't even taste the mango under the habanero spice. \n\nThe cocktail I had was very good and inventive but I feel like the Fillmore location has a larger and more interesting cocktail list.\n\nSo basically, if i want to go to Dosa again I will go to the fillmore location and if I am in the mission looking for a Dosa I will check out Udipi next time.", "author": "Leuwam T."}

I've been wanting to come here for ages and was stoked when this venue was suggested for brunch/lunch. Although it's in the Mission area, it's more in the \"charming neighbourhood, restaurant row\" area than the traditionally grimy/grungy image associated with Mission.\n\nBetween the three of us, we tasted idlis, vada, plain utthappam, the spiced mung salad and the habanero/mango masala dosa. The first three were as expected, and props for the texture of the utthappam, which was just the right balance between soft and crispy. The mung salad was unbelievably delicious and has me tempted to try to recreate it at home. Only beef is that the portion size is a little small for the $9 price tag.\n\nNow, a word to the wise for those foolish enough to brave the habanero dosa. Even though I was given a taste of the chutney and knew what kind of heat was in store, I naively thought that my tongue would be able to withstand the assault of the habanero-mango sauce with the hot masala and the hot sambar. Alas, I could not finish the delicious dosa without two glasses of water and three cups of yogurt. Seriously, if you think you have a high spice tolerance, beware. I'm glad I tried it but am more than happy to experiment with something a little less fiery the next time. The sambar and chutneys were tasty, with just the right amount of tang and spice.\n\nFor dessert, we split the rasmalai, which was surprisingly not cloyingly sweet. I was tempted to try the Tea-ramisu (with a chocolate-chai sauce, chai-infused rum and paneer), but will save it for next time.\n\nThe service was the only letdown - they forgot the dahi vada we ordered and took much longer than expected to bring the food out, given that the restaurant was not packed. Luckily, I was in the mood for a leisurely lunch, but this would have bugged me a lot more under normal circumstances.\n\nMake sure to stop by if you're in the area. Heck, make sure to make a special trip to this area in order to get a taste of South India.", "author": "Kavita B."}

Only two negatives I can mention are: 1)  it took a very long time to get our tap water, after the server tried his hardest to do the upsell on bottled water. 2) there are chairs/stools closely positioned so that it's almost impossible not to brush against other people when exiting and entering your table, as well as along the main walkway to the restrooms and the back of the restaurant.", "author": "Amalia C."}

While I encouraged everyone to start without me, we were rather close to the door and I'm sure the temperature of their food suffered. After a few minutes a member of the waitstaff came over and told me they had forgotten to make mine, so everyone ate. When it did come, it was not actually what I had ordered. I decided to cut my losses. You would think that they would at least comp the main that came out so delayed and incorrect. Nope, no acknowledgment at all.

It also rates rockstar high for vegetarian & vegan options- I was almost overwhelmed with choice. Only solution is to keep coming back for more ;-) \n\nI love Indian food but am used to the somewhat heavier-feeling curries and naan bread; Dosa's menu is filled with an amazing array of South Indian cuisine though- which includes different curries, veggie dishes, small plates, rice dishes, uttapam, and-of course- dosas. Come here and get as many dishes as possible and share them. \n\nAs I said, we came here for my bday, and I must have spent about 10 minutes just reading through the front page of the menu- the seasonal tasting page- it all looked so awesome I didn't even think to open up the menu. When I finally did, not only was it filled with more amazing menu items, there was also a card in there. Turns out my mother had given us a gift certificate for drinks (thanks, MA!) and the manager, Leo, had completely taken care of arranging things and had hid the card in the menu. Knowing my mother, I'm sure he spent a fair amount of time making sure her requests were met, and he could not have been any sweeter. Leo came over to our table and was just completely welcoming, friendly, and funny, and went well above and beyond. He even emailed my mom about our meal afterwords- how nice is he??! When there's that much hospitality and attention to detail by the higher-ups in a restaurant, you know you'll be well taken care of. \n\nBut don't get me wrong, I'm not just going with 5 starts because I think their manager is a cool guy- this place hit all my marks food-wise. We started with some of the grilled corn & coconut soup, and OH MY GOD it was delish. Get it, love it. I also particularly liked the seasonal veggie dosa and the summer uttapam. Even the frickin pompodoms were the best I've ever had. Actually, I wish they sold those things....

They definitely make good looking Dosa's, Idli's and other novel southern Indian cuisine which are difficult to find across San Francisco for some reason courtesy of the huge popularity of northern Indian cuisine. Heck I think they have first mover advantage and that holds them in good stead coz they have a novelty in this city.\n\nAs far as the food is concerned, I am not a huge fan, it's sub-optimal, watered down a bit as far as the spices are concerned. I grew up in India, and have tasted the best in length and breadth of Indian cuisine. Dosas are regular food fare for us back in India and humble mobile food vendors can prepare a heck of a dosa that used to leave me smacking my lips and with a full belly. With that perspective, Dosa, a mighty restaurant in San Francisco, barely even compares. By no means, the food is bad, it just isn't fantastic or hitting the same standards of high quality food other Indian restaurants in the city have. The other complain I have that there isn't enough quantity , it is reduced. Dramatically reduced. The size of Idli's should definitely be bigger than the little dots they served me today. The masala in my dosa was about a handful, and left me with a feeling of wanting more in my dinner. \n\nI have heard people complain that is overpriced but I felt it was priced just right, maybe the lack of quantity leaves one feeling that it is over priced. There is a bar inside and that makes drinking and consuming southern Indian cuisine a rare combination so they get a brownie for that. They haven't gone wrong with the ambience at all, sitting pretty on Valencia street with dim lighting, but they aren't really hitting the high notes either. I have had a bad experience with the service once but I am willing to forego that as a human error, so I am not deducting any points from the rating for service.

Because Dosa has now sourced gluten-free asafoetida--a frequently used Indian spice often ground with just enough wheat to sicken people with celiac disease.  \n\nGluten-free asafoetida means that we can have the sambar that comes with the dosas and enjoy that gorgeous mint-yogurt starter dumpling thingy and all the many other GF offerings made with asafoetida!\n\nFor the medically gluten-free among us, Dosa was always a blessing--a restaurant with a clear allergy menu that uses high-quality ingredients to make wonderful food.  Dosa proved to be a reliable restaurant where I could meet friends and *eat* with them.  That may sound facile--but I've drunk gallons of water and tea while watching others eat.  Having celiac disease can mean you'd better limit your hopes to San Pellagrino.  At other places I've also relied on the assurances of well-meaning waitstaff and wound up being temporarily disabled by illness.  Not so at Dosa.\n\nI have fantasized of celiac minority rule since a rakish restaurant server in Barcelona (S\u00e9samo,C/ Sant Antoni Abat, 52, Ciutat Vella) claimed that almost half the population is celiac.   It ain't true, but his comment made me wonder what a gluten-free world would look like.  \n\nSubsidies for alternative grains? ELISA testing for every milled substance?  Mandatory labeling laws with real penalties?  Being able to simply *eat* without interrogating each ingredient?\n\nAnd Dosa.

Made reservations from open table through yelp just 20 minutes before the reservation time. We got there 10 minutes early, checked in and were immediately seated. I was amazed how quickly we were seated even though there were groups of people standing waiting for a table. Perfect example of open table working brilliantly.\n\nWe took a look at the menu and ordered the paper masala dosa, lamb curry, tomato and onion uttapam, and the channa bhatura. Was very surprised everything came out so fast. Our little table for two was literally covered with plates of food. There was barely an inch of free space to move dishes around and pick up my glass of water, but that's a good thing!\n\nUsually when things come out and aren't the right size, they are smaller than expected. But when the paper masala dosa came out I was shocked as to how huge this thin wafer crepe style rolled up like a waffle cone thing was! It literally covered almost half of the table and had both ends of it hanging off of the plate it came on. The dish came with spice potatoes and three dipping sauces to use, one green yogurt, and two red ones. I broke a piece of the wafer and topped it with potatoes and some sauce. It has a nice spiced flavor to it with a good balanced texture of crispiness, mushiness and sauciness. I thought this dish was cool and fun but eating it with my hands got my fingers a little oily. But I liked the comfort to the food. \n\nNext was the uttapam. It looked like a very thin crust mini pizza but the crust was softer and doughier. The uttapam was very Indian spicy but this dish felt pretty oily as well. Next was the channa bhatura and the lamb curry. The curry was perfect, lamb was sweet and juicy tendery swimming in a well seasoned Indian curry. The channa bhatura was what we dipped in the curry with, but I didn't really enjoy this bread, naan looking thing. It was nice and big but this thing was super oily and my hands were sparkling shiny after breaking this bread. It tasted all right but nothing special. It was so oily that we didn't even want to touch it anymore, we gave up and abandoned more than half of this big thing.\n\nOverall the food was okay, had the Indian spice I was expecting but I did not enjoy the oiliness to most of the dishes we ordered. The service was very good though, fast and responsive.", "author": "Patrick L."}

I had anticipated a long wait for brunch, especially on Father's day, but we had no problems getting in with 5 in our party.  The place was actually still 1/3 empty.  Compared to Fillmore, Valencia felt much warmer and welcoming.  Off to a good start to our meal.\n\nService was great -- attentive and we did not feel rushed at all.  Food came out at a good pace this time, and the tables were a good 1/3 larger than those at Fillmore.  We tried the Pani Puri (loved this dish! enjoyed playing with my food -- cracking the little crispy bread, which I destroyed on the first try, and filling it and topping it with the two sauces), Dahi Vada (gorgeous presentation), the South Indian Moons Uttapam (a more filling version of the dosa), Spicay Mung Msala and extra sampling of chutneys.

My reservation was honored as soon as we stepped in the door. Overall, service was very attentive and considerate.\n\nAs for the food, if you're looking for a \"standard\" indian restaurant, this won't be it. This is southern Indian cuisine, which from what I can tell, differs from what you'd normally expect from a typical Indian restaurant. \n\nI used the tips on Yelp to guide our menu selections. I had the Chennai Chicken (a well spiced dry fried chicken with yogurt sauce and after thought salad), Dahi Vada (fritters submerged in a mixed yogurt sauce which seemed more like soup than a sauce), and Prawn Masala (shrimp in a dark coconut spice sauce) with coconut rice and Bhatura (a giant ball of bread that you deflate and then enjoy, think of naan but slightly sweeter). \n\nThe Chicken was well spiced but the yogurt sauce could have been slightly more special. Dahi Vada was virtually served cold, refreshing but the yogurt sauce was so overwhelming and excessive that you wouldn't even know that there was a fritter below. I had to ask the waitress to clarify what dish it was. The Prawn Masala was the most tasty item I tried and matched especially well with the coconut rice. Even though it was very enjoyable, it was extraordinarily salty, to the point that it left my palate tired. The Bhatura was very soft and enjoyable. \n\nService is fast and the fourth star is mostly for that. The food is good, but not as earthy and comforting like most higher end indian restaurants. It's as gourmet as the restaurant is decorated. Good alcohol selection!\n\nI will say that I doubt I'll be returning for some time.", "author": "Julio E."}

Being avid Indian food fanatics, we agreed on Dosa and we were both blown away.  \n\nDosa is not like any other Indian food we've had before.  Almost every Indian restaurant we've had up until now has focused primarily on Tandoori BBQ, Curry, Basmati, Naan, etc. You won't find any of those at Dosa...  They specialize in South Indian cuisine, which centers on Dosa flat breads and Uttapans.  \n\nWe started with the Dahi Vada appetizer which was superb.  It was this beautifully presented dish of Lentil dumplings infused with organic yogurt, tamarind, mint, and other spices.  It tasted wonderful; very flavorful and a moderate sized portion for two people.\n\nNext was our Spinach and Paneer Jumbo Prawn curry with coconut rice - the one dish that reminded me of other Indian restaurants I've had before.  Essentially it was an Aloo Palak dish with shrimp.  It was OK, better than fast food Indian places such as Naan & Curry.  However, it wasn't as fresh and tasty as Sultan's spinach Curry.  Out of everything we ordered, I was least impressed with this dish.\n\nOur last dish was a classic Masala Dosa.  We've never had Dosa's before so we didn't know which one to order.  Thus our decision to start with the Classic (apparently the tried and truest).  I was amazed at how large this was.  The plate itself was huge, and our half moon shaped Dosa spilled out at least six inches past either side of the plate.  It was filled with spiced Potatoes and cashews, similar to what you'd find in a Samosa.  The Dosa's come with 3 dipping sauces, all of which are delectable.  One is a creamy one that tastes pretty garlicky; another is one that reminds me of a vegetable soup.  The third one, my favorite, was a fresh tomato based puree that was cold and reminded me of a blended Salsa.\n\nOur dinner was fantastic and was a pleasant introduction to South Indian Cuisine.  We will definitely be back again and again to try the other Dosa's and Uttapans that all sounded amazing.  I hope Dosa is a catalyst to a new wave of South Indian restaurants; I haven't seen any others around. I'd highly recommend you check this place out.", "author": "Timothy C."}

No, I have a chemical dependence on spicy food, so naturally I ordered the item on the menu that had  \"warning\" next to it.

When I showed up I looked around and didn't see people I recognized so I told the hostess that I was there with a big group, she asked, \"do you mean the yelp group\", so much for anonymity. I've put off writing my review because I have no idea if we got the typical dining experience. \n\nI was hesitant to come here because I was under the impression that this place was strictly vegetarian, I think it used to be, but when I'm invited to meet some of my favorite yelpers for lunch I get over my aversion to vegetarian food quickly.\n\nI've had lots of Indian and Pakistani food but have never had food like this before. I don't even know what to call most of the things I ate so forgive me for using the wrong terms.\n\nWe had two styles of these little empty crust balls filled with stuff. I liked the ones that came filled by the restaurant but the ones we had to fill ourselves were too complicated; this is far too delicate a task to expect your customers to be able to do. We had other appetizers but they didn't really make an impression.\n\nI found the menu baffling. For my entree I asked the waitress to bring me the spiciest thing they have. She said anything could be made spicy so I asked for the chicken curry, which was the only meat dish available. Even though I ordered it spicy it came fairly bland, they gave me a sour tasting chutney to spice it up but I didn't think the flavor complimented the curry. I also tried a giant crepe thing with ground up potatoes in it that Cassie ordered, it was interesting but bland and lacking something, meat would have made it much better.\n\nThis might be an excellent crust ball and Indian crepe place for all I know but I didn't particularly like the food and I thought the prices were high for what we got.", "author": "Manny F."}

For NYE dinner, they had a fixed menu costing $80 per person for four courses.  Our table of four chose wisely to get a taste of virtually everything.\n\nFirst, it was great that we got there on time and our table was ready for us -- no waiting!  \n\nSecond, from the moment you enter the door, service was phenomenal.  A woman, who I later found out was the owner's wife, was naturally fantastic, but the hostess as well as servers were also very pleasant.\n\nThird, the food was all-around terrific.  I was seriously impressed with the escarole (soup), and the first two courses were amazing - including the Dosa dish (I ordered the paneer and peas one - delicious!).  The curry (3rd entree) was very good but I didn't feel it was as \"special\" as the first two.  The dessert was hit or miss.  The dough bread we ordered was really not good, but the coconut ice cream dessert was out of this world!\n\nThey have a green mint (spicy) sauce that I could seriously drink by the bowl. It basically made every dish taste even better.  Spicy as hell - just the way I like it.\n\nIt's great food, so I give it 4.5-stars.  It's about the only \"Indian\" restaurant in SF that I really enjoyed, so thumbs up.  Factor in the service and great wine - and I am rounding up to 5 whole stars for Dosa.  \n\nThat said, while it hovers close, it's STILL not the amazing Indian I have come to expect through home-cooked meals or Indian restaurants in Europe.  It's a tiny little step below that - ahhh, I miss Dublin, London, and Amsterdam.  \n\nAs a sidenote, I scored parking on NYE at 7:30 in the evening in the Mission, RIGHT in front of the restaurant.  \n\nIn any case, I highly recommend Dosa as a dining venue.  It's great for a business dinner, but also nice for a date.  \n\nAnd pick the Bucklin Zinfandel - - that wine was outstanding.\n\nAfter all was said and done - the dinner came to $500 including the tip (four people, four courses each, and two bottles of wine).  I suspect it would have been significantly less on a regular night (since we also would most likely not order four courses), but we were all impressed and awfully full as we took off to formally bring in 2010.", "author": "Grace K."}

Hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly at our reservation time (a first here!). As we weren't particularly starved enough to go full-four-frontal prix fixe with the built-in prosecco, we opted to order off the a la carte menu instead, forgoing the dessert and upselling on the bubbly. \n\nWaitress, assuming we were ordering a la carte for price-point reasons, \"Are you sure you don't want to just order the prix fixe? I think it'd be cheaper.\"\n\nHuh? No, I don't want dessert and it's NYE, I want a distinctive bottle of sparkling shiraz, not something I can find easily at any local Safeway, but \"yeah, okay, sure, you can check on that\" (knowing full-well that our shared starters, dosa, entree each, and wine would wind up just shy of what the prix fixe would have cost). She doesn't come back.\n\nThe starters -- chicken croquettes and halibut pakora -- were solid and the dosa were as fantastic as they've been any other night I've had them. \n\nThe mains, though. Oh, the mains. I know what to expect and you did **not** deliver. Flavors masked by an excessive amount of heat (and yes, I have a high tolerance), skimpy on the meat, and the mango prawns? Two pieces of mango, three shrimpy prawns, and tomato paste, with sugar.\n\nTo our waitress walking past, \"Excuse me, yeah, hi, hello?! Ummm, we've really enjoyed the starters and dosa, but the mango prawns...\" *pointing to untouched plate* \"taste like canned Ragu...\"\n\n\"Oh, well, you see, it's a tomato base.\" Nada else. No apology. Check please. Full check, apparently. Upscale places normally don't compromise return business in favor of sticking the full bill to a dissatisfied customer. I guess Dosa does.\n\nNeedless to say, much like the canned tomatoes, the experience left me with a tinny taste in my mouth.", "author": "Claire Q."}

The dosa batter is made from rice and white lentils, which is protein (that's why so many Hindu vegetarians eat lentils and rice for every meal). But don't be mislead that their dosa is great/good and that's why you're feeling full! \n\nThe only thing Dosa has going is that it's the only (well, if you ignored Udupi) upscale, South Indian place in the city.\n\nIt's like this: on a holiday in Nevada, I could go to a Denny's and order eggs and toast, pay them the basic price and leave. OR, I could go to a fancy, upscale diner, order the same stuff, but pay $13.95 - for the fancy plates/flatware, the ambiance and other stuff. \n\nP.S: Dosa on Fillmore is thriving thanks to your money - you paid him & her that extra money for another fancy Dosa place......that lease is all because of you and your generosity :)", "author": "Me Iz S."}

Also ordered a mango lassi, it was too creamy for me (had the texture of melted ice cream).  \n\nI have to take off three stars for the completely inedible dosa and service response though.  I ordered a habanero chilli dosa.  I'm from Andhra Pradesh, the region of India that's known for chilli dosas (I've had many of them in my life, and I make dosas at home).  Spice is meant to enhance taste, not overpower what you're eating.  They had put so much of habenero chili on the dosa that it became COMPLETELY inedible.  And I have VERY high spice tolerance, I put red pepper flakes and Sriracha hot sauce on everything.  I also got annoyed that when I complained (they said the spice varies depending on the chilli season), they offered raita (yogurt) - but didn't tell us they were going to charge for it!  \n\nThe dosa had the correct texture and consistency, so props for that. But everything on their menu should be edible, and the habanero chili dosa most definitely was NOT.  I ended up paying $20+ and barely eating anything.  \n\nIf you want the same dosa for a fraction of the price, there's a ton of hole-in-the-wall places I'd rather recommend.  Or ask your token Indian friend to cook you one.

All with a fried fiddlehead fern appetizer.\n\nBrought my Brazilian \"nephew\" here after visiting the Museum of African Diaspora's abstract expressionist exhibit. It was a warm day, so we sat up front by the sliding window and enjoyed the breeze and the action on Valencia.\n\nAs always, we were warmly greeted and started out with mild fried pappadam. Growing up, our supply was shipped to us my my granny who made them herself. My mom always heated these over a flame and they were charred and uneven. She only ever fried them for company - so when I come here and eat the fried pappadam, I get to be company! They are also a lot milder.\n\nMy Rio beer drinking nephew tried a Rasputin beer which came in a tall German style glass, and we took advantage of the Happy Hour prices - $6 for a plateful of batter fried seasonal veggies ( also something we only ever made for company) and bite sized chennai chicken which was spicy and delicious. Two spicy appetizers followed by a third - the cool and tangy sweet artistically presented dahi vada (yes, yes, another company dish), and my belly was filled.\n\nI have never had fiddle head ferns and associate them with upscale restaurants that only cook what grew in the forest that day. So it was a real delight to find them in South Indian food - not South Indian, but very seasonal to NoCalif, and SEASONALITY is a South Indian tradition. My mom's cooking was always varied and depended on what was in season, and that playfulness was a delight to find in something as low priced as Happy Hour. Three large appetizers at $6 apiece and $4 beers is a steal.\n\nI always get the impression that great thought goes into the menu because it stays playful and seasonal. Masala Fiddlehead Ferns? Spice in the forest? The South Indian Forest? It could happen. They were warm, rich, crunchy, soft  and spiral shaped. Fried in masala batter, they are a vast improvement on boring onion pakora.

Really, about $2 worth of beer for $15?? A complete rip off, it would be a bad value at half the price. \n2) Some of the courses are more food art than food, e.g., the seafood Vada first course looked very pretty, but the food was literally two bites (each Vada comes out the size of the 25 cent piece).  \n3) the waiters are constantly trying to clear plates regardless of whether everyone one else at our four person table had finished less than half their portion.  Efficiency if fine, but this felt pushy.\n   In sum, if value is of absolutely no importance to you, eat here anxiety free.  However, if value is even of some importance, you will experience a meal filled with nagging frustration.", "author": "William F."}

They will make vegan dosas upon request, so ask your waiter or waitress.  The atmosphere and decor is less of an Indian restaurant, but more of an upscale bar restaurant.

Our server (Ziya?) was great -- very knowledgeable, especially when we asked him for suggestions on what we should order.\n\nWe ordered: (1) the samosas, (2) persimmon idiapp salad, (3) kerala chicken curry w/ a side of coconut rice, and the (4) chatni dosa. The samosas were awesome -- huge w/ a good crisp and they were actually a bit spicy. Dip them in some of the cilantro-mint chutney and you're good to go. The persimmon idiapp salad, with fresh sliced persimmon and rice noodles in a coconut sauce, was recommended by our server and I'm so glad he suggested it to us. It had a very unique flavor that I loved -- the textures of the FRESH persimmon and the rice noodles went really well together in the strong coconut milk sauce. The kerala chicken curry was incredible -- good flavor with tender pieces of chicken. It went insanely well with the coconut rice. \n\nThe chatni dosa was good, but still, I don't think it was that GREAT. Personally, I enjoyed the other food much more than the dosas here.

I took my mom here for her birthday and she is a hard woman to please but she absolutely fell in love with Dosa. The food is scrumptious and the ambiance is very classy yet warm and intimate. The vada pav (vegetarian slider) is literally an explosion of taste in your mouth. PLEASE ORDER THE VADA PAV. You'll be the happiest person alive if you do. I promise. It has the perfect combination of flavors. The lamb keema dosa is really good, the paneer peas dosa is not as flavorful and was on the soggy side. The habanero-mango masala dosa is sooo yummy but ridiculously spicy. Even if you're into extremely spicy food, you should definitely ask for a taste of the habanero mango chutney before you order, to make sure you can handle it. The rasamalai is to die for - one of the best I've ever had, and I've had MANY rasamalais. My parents loved the Madras Coffee and deemed it very authentic. Overall, Dosa offers authentic and delicious South Indian food with excellent service. The waiters are very helpful and friendly and one of them was the ideal tall, dark, and handsome type - he looked so brooding and mysterious. Sigh. I swear I'm going to marry him one of these days. I came here with about eight other South Indian people and they all absolutely loved it! And that's saying a lot - let's just say South Indian people are hard to please when it comes to food! \n\nP.S. I loved Dosa, but honestly it gets five stars instead of four all due to its vada pav.

I usually avoid lamb especially in the States because I find it too lamby/gamey. Lamb in China and Australia are less gamey, but still a bit to strong flavored for me. But this lamb curry--omg. It must've been the spices they cooked it in because it was tender and the flavor was soooo good and not a hint of gameyness! The lemon rice was ok to me (not much of a fan of lemon rice in general) but it DID go really well with the lamb.\n\nBe warned that your nose will run if we get a spicy dish.

The texture of the dosa itself is very comforting & is a pleasure to eat; it's crunchy around the edges & soft in the middle. \n- total without tip: $44 (i thought the dosas were well priced but $17 for the chicken dish was outrageous & for that reason, I may not be ordering it again.\n\nFantastic environment for a first date or anniversary.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

And in a city where having high price points is practically an aesthetic value in and of itself, I would also call it one of the worst values, especially considering that there is a phenomenally better South Indian place - namely Udupi Palace - not even a full block away.  Although Udupi Palace's lines are already longer than I like, the shred of me that is purely selfless implores you to go there rather than Dosa.\n\nMy main issue with Dosa is that it is silly overpriced, seemingly because those who run it believe that they offer something unique.  I infer this from their emphasis on presentation of the food and also the fact that the wait staff addresses patrons as though they never could have had South Indian food before.  Servers tend to be overbearing about making recommendations and the assumption of your ignorance then translates into $11+ dosas, $14 channa bhatura (!!!), $9 vada appetizer, and so on.  \n\nApparently part of Dosa's draw for its many fans is the idea that eating there is an experience.  To me, the modern decor/atmosphere is tacky and cheesy at the same time, and the (not Indian) music is obnoxious.  How is it that even usually-discerning restaurant patrons miss these obvious issues?\n\nThe best thing about Dosa is that it does siphon a good many more potential Udupi Palace customers away from that far superior restaurant, especially those that desire a certain kind of service/experience that I find annoying.", "author": "Josh C."}

A bottle of Kingfisher was $6 and the garbanzo salad recommended by our server was fine but boring, and garnished with pale, crunchy tomatoes.

It was like a modern day waldorf  salad with out all the mayo and raisins.  \nNext we had Potatoes & Organic Peas Croquette with a hot mint chutney and a tiny bit of radish clovers with a light dressing on the side to cool ya off. .  This was also very tasty with a bit of heat and more when you used the chutney. It was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. \nOur main dish was Prawn Masala curry with a side of plain rice and uttapam.

I came earlier this week with visiting parents, and have decided I'm not going to go again if I can help it. The food is sub par... samosas are really poor - can get better ones most places. The dosa was meh. Not worth a ton of hype. Barely spicy and just kind of blah. The wait service was surprisingly harsh. The guy made fun of my mom for asking what she could order that wasn't spicy - she's very sensitive to hot stuff (unfortunately - she doesn't pretend it's cool!) and just can't eat it. (Why'd we go to Dosa? Well my stepdad insisted.) Anyway, the waiter proceeded to make fun of her for it, telling her \"it's just psychological, you know.\" And that she needed to power through it. Then he brought her the special, which she still found too spicy. \n\nAt the prices and the crowdedness of the place, I'm just not into it.

Has a kick of spice after a few chews.\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa- SUPER yummy!!! Especially with the white truffle oil. Not your typical Indian flavor but added a different flavor profile that even creeps out of  the to go bag. The Masala was not overpowering with its spices and I think everything worked well together.\n\nSeasonal Vegetable Bhutara - The least spicy of the curries in their tasting menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-02", "description": "I'll start by saying that while I'm not Indian, I love Indian food. I've been eating it since I was a young child, and at one point spent two months in India, where I had some of the best meals--and certainly the best dosas--of my life. I really wanted to like Dosa, but unfortunately, my recent experience there was anything but positive. I guess if you do go, stick with the dosas, which I've had once or twice, and are tasty and relatively reasonably priced. Otherwise you may be setting yourself up for disappointment both in terms of the quality and the price. My girlfriend and I went this past Sunday evening and got the tasting menu and a \"chef's selection\" of uttapams. From the tasting menu, we chose a seafood vada (fritter), a \"seasonal\" fennel and spinach dosa, and a chicken korma dish. The price of the tasting menu was $40 so I figured that the dishes would each be full sized. However, each dish was disappointingly tiny. The vada was a single, round fritter, about the diameter of a water glass--maybe four small bites at the most. However, neither of us minded the size since it was insanely spicy, almost to the point of being inedible. Mind you, we're not shy when it comes to spice--I'll put Tabasco, Tapatio, Cholula, whatever all over any dish, but this was like blazing, eyes tearing up, nose running, breaking out in a cold sweat, sick to your stomach spicy. Furthermore, there was no indication on the menu of how hot this dish would be. It was accompanied by a similarly impossibly spicy dhal, of which we each could only eat a bite or two due to the severe burning in our mouths and the sweat breaking out on our brows. We told our waitress we like spice, but that this was just over the top, and so if she could ask the chef to just tone it down a notch on the subsequent dishes, that would be great. She said she'd let the kitchen know. Then came the fennel and spinach dosa, which was again miniature (not their typical full-sized dosa), and really not that tasty or filling compared to, say, a masala dosa. The small portions of fennel and spinach inside made it seem pretty thin both in terms of actual size and in terms of overall flavor/substance. The final sorry entry from their tasting menu was the chicken korma, which was likewise small, though at least this one wasn't unbearably spicy. However, I think the chef overcompensated after our comment to the waitress, because this dish had the exact opposite problem that the vada had: it was just incredibly bland. I'm sorry to say that it was actually the worst chicken korma I've ever had--it tasted like chicken cooked in pureed, wet cardboard. You could get a tastier chicken korma from any typical, down-the-street type Indian restaurant. Finally came the five uttapams, which each had a different topping chosen by the chef. They were...fine. They didn't have a lot of flavor and were mostly saved by the coconut chutney that they came with. In the end, the bill came to over $70 (including the tip) for just the two of us, and we didn't even order any drinks or dessert. For that price, we could have gotten a feast from almost any other Indian restaurant that would have given us leftovers for days and would have tasted a lot better, or we could have gone to any of the other nearby, moderately high end restaurants in the neighborhood, and eaten much better. Overall, an incredibly disappointing dining experience from start to finish. The only reason I didn't give them one star is because the service was reasonably good, and it has a nice ambiance (though on the particular night we went, the adult son of the family seated next to us was actually playing a video game on his phone at full volume during a significant portion of the meal--way to classy it up, buddy). I'll be giving Dosa a miss in the future, and will instead be going to their nearby, more reasonably priced competitor when I'm in the neighborhood and have a hankering for Indian food. If I must return to Dosa (at gunpoint, for example), I'll be pretty much sticking to the dosas. Based on my experience, I think you'd be wise to do the same.", "author": "Moses G."}

Not only were they super delicious and flavorful, the portions were big and filled all three of us up. The food was ready pretty quick and they were not stingy at all about the amount of sauces they provided for our food. \nThe service here is really good. The lady explained how to eat the different foods because it does get quite confusing. They checked up on us frequently, and when we asked questions about the different dishes, they were very clear on what everything was. \n\nService was good, food was good, experience was overall a 5 :)", "author": "Sheila X."}

You eat a lot of sambhar. I don't know what an analogy would be... but it's as much a dip as meat sauce is a dip for spaghetti. Most other South Indian restaurants give free \"refills\" or just charge $.50-$1 (Udupi next door). I love sambhar and take major offense at this nickel-and-dime attitude (especially when they give very little to begin with). \n\n- Prices in general. About 30-35%% more expensive than the neighboring Udupi (whose food, I'll admit, I don't like as much - but it's definitely good enough).

The last time i went was a Friday night me and a girlfriend didn't have reservations so we opted for the bar instead of a 30 minute wait for a table .It was very tight and I bumped elbows w the chick next to me for the entire meal meanwhile I was being bumped by servers rushing behind me I had no where to put my purse except on the floor under my stool. This wasn't a huge deal for me but I can see how it might be for someone else so I thought I'd let you know. Reservations might be good.\n\nOther than the crowdedness the atmosphere is beautiful. Dim lighting illuminated with supplemental candles,  Indian music in the background, overall a very warm feeling. It was a good place for me and my friend to catch up but would also be a nice date place. the bar would be a good choice for wine (they seem to have a nice selection) and appetizers.\n\nI wasn't super hungry so we decided to split two appetizers and a DOSA. We ordered:\n\n1. Crispy Fish Pakora Sustainably-caught fish, marinated in chile, cumin, ginger & garlic, fried, served w/ spicy chutney\n\nThis was supper tasty but a bit smaller than I expected. It was 5 pinky sized fish sticks  for 9$.\n\n2.Dahi Vada Lentil dumplings, topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind & mint, mildly spiced\n\nThese were yummy too. 5 bite sized dumplings, 5 mouthfulls of India. I'm not sure I'd order them again though as the flavors were too muddled.\n\n3. Paneer & Peas Dosa filled with spiced and shredded farmer's cheese, lightly grilled, peas and cilantro\n\nReally delicious. I eat meat but a lot of the time I'm happier without it. This was one of those times. Soft texturally and flavorfully with delicate spices. It was very enjoyable especially with the dipping options (the coconut one was my favorite).\n\nWe finished off the meal with 2 Chai teas (one soy and one regular) and Raj Malai. The cardamon and cool creamy pistachio flavor  was the perfect way to end the meal.\n\nIn summary this was a great experience. IT is a good place to go if you're not starving as portions are small. This does allow you to try many things on the menu but it can also leave you still hungry once all your food has devoured. There are more substantial items such as the curries but I didn't try them.\n\nLast note - the staff was courteous and pretty attentive considering how busy it was. Every time our order was placed in front of us we were i instructed on how to eat it which was a nice touch.", "author": "Miya F."}

Everything, I repeat, EVERYTHING that was put into our mouths that night was fabulous. So much food, so much happiness. Oh and go with the wine pairings if you are looking to get sloshed with those dosas. But on another note, going with the tasting menu and wine pairings may give you some limitations on how much food should be put into your mouth.. \n\nAnother recommendation: They have two bathrooms. I visited both of them that night but if you have a choice use the one farther down the hall. I opened the bathroom door into a room full of orange-ness and mirrors and it was spectacular.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-05-04", "description": "I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, and especially not to vegans, despite the numerous offerings labeled \"vegan\".  I was really bothered by the RANCID BUTTER that permeated my dosa.  I was there with a group, and several other people also commented on the heavy butter flavor of the dosas.  It was so bad I couldn't finish my dosa, even though I love dosas.  I finished the filling and gave the rest of the dosa to a friend, who wasn't too excited since she also felt it was too buttery/rancid.\n\nI have a hard time believing the dosa was vegan, given the consensus at my table about the butter flavor.  Although the waitress was quick to warn me about not sampling a friend's dish as it was not vegan, and seemed interested in making my dish vegan, I suspect all the dosas are made on the same grill and they don't clean it well in between, resulting in the super rancid butter flavor.  It was unappealing to vegans and non vegans alike, as it was so greasy and unpleasant, so I would not recommend Dosa, despite other aspects of the food being completely fine.  \n\nIf you do decide to go to Dosa, rancid butter dosas aside, my Korean girlfriend strongly warns against the spicy dishes.  She thought that she could take it being Korean and often eating really spicy food, but Dosa takes it to a new level even she couldn't handle.  Being a wimp I didn't need any warning, and found the mild dishes to all be fine spice-wise, as did all my other girlfriends at the table.\n\nUpdate:  I find the response of the restaurant owner odd, and a further sign this restaurant should definetely be avoided.  I specifically pointed out an issue with butter contamination of vegan food that a large group of diners vegan and non-vegan alike agreed on.  In fact as often happens with large groups the vegan diners chose the restaurant.  Disregarding vegans means losing the future business of large groups of diners that spend many hundreds of dollars in one evening.  I did not say that I thought unfresh ingredients were knowingly used, only that the grill surface likely needed more frequent cleaning as the flavor of the BUTTER was rancid, not the dosa batter.  \nFermented dosa batter does not taste rancid at all, it tastes sort of sourdough like.  Dosa batter does not normally include any oil, oil only is used in the cooking phase.  Rancid is a word that refers to spoiled oil, not fermented lentils and rice.  I do not feel I should have to prove my credentials to describe my meal, or provide definitions for all the words I use, and I find it insulting that the owner has stooped to implying that my lack of knowledge about dosas is the problem not their food.  I have made dosas from scratch many times at home and at others' homes (using ingredients purchased at the Indian grocery and fermenting overnight or longer, not sure how much more dosa study I need to do to meet the owners criteria?) and I've had them at lots of restaurants where they have never tasted like butter, rancid butter, or rancid oil of any kind.  These restaurants include Malabar, Dosa Republic (now Chennai Club) as well as places in Sunnyvale like Madras Cafe.  \n\n***The owner's total disregard of the true issues and customer feedback and insulting condescension means I am now lowering my rating from two stars to one.  ***\n\nIt seems like the goal of \"Dosa\" is to cater to people who want the fancy ambiance and trendy location and are willing to believe this is authentic high quality South Indian food, perhaps because they have never had this genre of food before so the owner's condescension somehow works.  There appear to be enough takers that my large group of friends who now knows better won't be missed.  I suggest if you are in this neighborhood to visit Gracias Madre instead, which we would have done except one group member has a Mexican food aversion.  I guarantee the food will be far superior.  For good dosas I like Malabar but it is a trek out to Santa Cruz and Malabar has its quirks and issues.", "author": "N T."}

YAY! I love impromptu date nights, especially when I get to check out restaurants I've heard so much about, but have never been to. Those wings will have to wait. \n\nWe popped in a little before 630, and they seated us immediately at the window. Luckily, we arrived before the dinner rush. Apparently, it's busy at Dosa almost every night. \n\nToast ordered the Rasam \"fire broth\" - spicy, tomato, lentil, and tamarind broth, a Bhatura to share, and the Paneer and Peas Dosa. I was debating on what type of Dosa to try, and ended up getting the Mysore Dosa. The waiter was helpful and suggested ordering the sampler of chutney dipping sauces, so that I could try other flavors. (.50 cents per flavor)\n\nWe started off with the complimentary Papadum chips. They were very light and crisp, and speckled with cumin. Magically delicious! It was a great way to test out the chutney sampler. The fire broth was lentil-y, spicy and good as well. Next came our Bhatura. Definitely a surprise to see a giant inflated dough ball. It's BIGGER THAN YOUR FACE (and mine combined)! I snapped a photo of it before it started deflating -- and then it was just flat bread and not as exciting. It was a tad on the oily side, but great with the dipping sauces. \n\nWe both agreed that the best dipping sauce, by far, was the Baby Eggplant chutney. I also liked the Cilantro/Mint flavors - both were light and refreshing. The Tamarind definitely has a sour kick to it, so try a little bit first. If you're feeling adventurous, try the Habanero. I tried a dime sized drop - despite the hotness, it also tastes sweet. \n\nMy Mysore Dosa was delicious!! Of course, I do have an unhealthy love for potatoes. The crepe itself was big, slightly chewy, and partially filled with creamy spiced potatoes with onions and cashews. I think I would've preferred less dough because it was folded so a big portion was not filled with anything. I ended up using the Sambar (lentil dipping soup) more than the Tomato and fresh Coconut Chutney. All three came with the Dosa for dipping. The Paneer and Peas Dosa was wrapped like a burrito, and cut so you could see the filling. The cheese looked like scrambled eggs, so I kept thinking I was going to eat eggs and peas. It was also tasty and not too pea-y. \n\nOverall the service was attentive and very helpful, everything was delicious, but just slightly pricey.  However, with all the food that you get, it's not too bad. We ended up with 6 or 7 ramekins of dipping sauces and half of our Dosas in a doggy bag.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try other things, and mayhaps bump up the rating.", "author": "Donna H."}

For example: masala. So like a potato onion curry ish thing. \n- UTTAPAM is also a crepe as well, which is slightly thicker and the ingredients are rolled into it, so it comes out like a small burrito. \n- Both DOSAS and UTTAPAM are served with three things...\n1) Lentil soup \n2) Tomato Chutney and \n3) Coconut Garlickey Chutney\n\nOur server was really helpful and helped us order about 2 dosas, an egg plate and 3 uttapams -- once of which was a sweet one. He then suggested for us to try other chutneys, and subsequently after agreeing to it, he brought out 6 different chutneys for us to try: a lime one, a lemon one, a mango one, a dried tomato one, a spicy habernero one, and something else I cannot remember. I definitely suggest trying the tomato one because it has a bit of spice to it but also a salty kick. Put a dab of this on one of your dosas or uttapams and then load it on with the tomato chutney they give you from the beginning and you're golden. Trust!! \n\nFor newbie diners at Dosa, I highly recommend getting...\n1) Masala Dosa\n2) Paneer & Peas Uttapam\n3) A side of their tomato chutney for 50 cents.\n\nI will be back to dine at Dosa to try their curry that they ran out of when we arrived.

I loved the chic intimate atmosphere, and for me personally- a non-allergy person, I would have loved DOSA, had I not been with an allergic person, and had I not encountered TERRIBLE customer service.\n\nYou need to know that this restaurant does not list common allergic ingredients on their main menu, and items that you would think may not have nuts, ginger, etc may- so you need to ask your server for an allergy menu. My date has a terrible reaction to nuts, and when we saw on the main menu that there was no listing of nuts next to the Kafta Meatballs, he ordered it. He's had several dietary allergies his whole life, and has managed eating Indian food before...\n\nKafta meatballs are made with cashews. We were going to the restaurant for his birthday AND our 2nd anniversary.\n\nI called the restaurant 5 minutes after we left- as he was throwing up in the gutter - to ask what the hell was in his dinner before I took him to the hospital! The maitre-d rudely asked me why I didn't ask for an allergy menu. I had no idea there was one, as other food items on the DOSA menu had listed there were cashews, and there was no such listing on his Kafta Meatballs- we both thought there was 1 menu.\n\nI called back the next day March 19, to speak with a manager and he pacified me. I told him I am a yelper, so he knows I'm writing this, as he has not fulfilled his promise of gift certificates or even the card he promised when I gave him our address to pass off to the owner. The manager asked for the address, so I feel like this is a double-insult.\n\nI paid $90 for dinner as my date threw it up just out front, and then we had to go to the hospital to get his epinephrine shot. He was sick for 2 days. The manager said he would send such items to as retribution for his ruined his birthday, but hasn't. \n\nTERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Dosa is warm and inviting, while at the same time having a hip vibe going.  \n\nI sat at the bar and found the bar staff very friendly and helpful - unlike many bars in the Mission.  Even the guy sitting next to me was helpful in my beer selection.  I had a great experience at the bar.  The food had some great flavors - although I'd skip the organic field greens since you're probably there for South Indian flavors.  The salad wasn't bad; it just didn't seem appropriately paired with the rest of the menu.  The garlic soup was out of this world - spicy and flavorful - and was a work of art visually.  The shrimp chili fry had a really great flavor, although the shrimp might have been a little overcooked.  \n\nThe downsides?  It took quite a long time for each of my successive dishes to arrive.  At least the vibe kept me entertained during my wait.\n\nI'd definitely recommend trying Dosa, even if you don't consider Indian to be your thing.

There are so many wonderful unusual sounding dishes listed that you end up deciding on several dishes and then you forget what you've ordered.\n\nAs the first few plates start to appear, you might wonder which dish you're about to enjoy and you'll dive in. You'll be 'oohing and ahhing' and telling your friends to 'try this dosa' or 'make SURE you have some of that' that you'll probably forget what it is that you ordered. \n\nThe plates will continue to come out of the kitchen. Like a pack of hungry wolves, you'll practically attack the waitstaff, anxious for what's next. There probably won't be a lot of talking while dining either.

The decor is modern but warm, and the place has a nice feel to it.  Unfortunately our waitress proved to be somewhat distracted -- she forgot to tell us the specials until after we'd ordered, and otherwise barely delivered the minimum of service.\n\nFor a starter we had the Chennai Chicken ($9.50), which was excellent.  The free Papadum chips were also very good.  I had a glass of the Gew\u00fcrztraminer ($12; good but a bit sweet), which one of the owners delivered to the table himself.  Apparently that wine is a favorite of his.  \n\nFor entrees we shared the Masala ($10) and Paneer & Peas ($11) dosas.  The presentation was beautiful and the portions were a good size.  And while the ingredients certainly seemed very fresh, I found both of them to be fairly mediocre as far as flavor.  They just didn't stand out at all, although the Masala was the better of the two.  Similarly, neither the tomato chutney nor the sambar were anything special.  The fresh coconut chutney was better.  However, my girlfriend thought it was all delicious, so YMMV.\n\nWe finished with the Gulab Jamoon for desert (\"Two soft, lightly-fried milk and dough balls served in a warm, cardamom flavored sugar syrup\"), which perhaps predictably tasted like dough and sugar; it did not impress.  Both of us wished we'd had Indian ice cream down the street instead.", "author": "Andy S."}

I was not disappointed.  While I'm not the most seasoned connoisseur of South Indian cuisine, I know what tastes good and Dosa definitely fits the bill.\n\nMy roommate and I arrived on a Wednesday night without reservations.  There was a wait for a table, but we decided to take a seat at the bar instead.  Really it's an ideal situation for me.  Might as well just the distance between myself and the alcohol down to a minimum, right?  Since it was my first time here, the bartender offered a few friendly suggestions on what and how to order.  Having already had somewhat of an idea of where we were going, we went with the onion pakora, lamb kofka with lemon rice and chutney masala dosa.  While we waited for our order, the bartender brought over a little snack to get us started of pappadums.  These chip-ey things are awesome.  I just could not stop eating them.  They are so light and crispy and cheesy!  Fantastic!\n\nThe onion pakora arrived quickly and it was a perfect way to start.  Basically an Indian version of the blooming onion, the perfume of cumin and coriander invaded our senses and whet our appetites.  There was just enough batter to make it crunchy, but not so much so that you forgot what you were eating, it was fantastic.  Granted, it's pretty tough to go wrong with something battered and fried in my book.  \n\nThe entrees of the lamb kafka and dosa arrived not much later as our corner of the bar was covered with a massive triangle of dosa and a healthy portion of lamb and rice.  The dosa was light and crispy on the outside, which just a bit of chewiness as you bit into it.  The lamb kafka was terrific as well with six good sized lamb meatballs swimming in a spicy, rich and flavorful sauce.  The lemon rice was a perfect accompaniment to cut through some of the richness of the sauce.  The edges of the dosa also provided a nice substrate with which to soak up the sauce of the kafka.  \n\nI again must commend the service here.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful with out orders and the service was timely.  The atmosphere here is very lively, but I still felt quite comfortable here.  The prices aren't bad here, but I wouldn't necessarily consider it cheap.  However, it's been over 3 hours since we ate here, and I'm still stuffed so that must be a good sign right?", "author": "Gary L."}

Well sorry, no I don't believe that last part.  And regardless of what ingredients were used,  the food tasted only so so  - I've eaten a lot better in even hole in the wall indian places. Dose comes no where close compared to Amber or Breads of India. This is SF - most cooks here know how to cook meat tender. This was tough - all of it from appetizer to entree.  The calimari appetizer was so tough - like chewing hard rubber.   Even when the brought out the papadum when we fist sat down they didn't bring any mint or other dipping sauce to go with it.

(Also, hideous forty year old facelift in Seven jeans from five years ago: fuck you. I wear what I want.)\n\nA note on waiting for your table: it's going to be a half hour plus, so you might as well not freeze outside the whole time. The assholes sitting at the bar will do everything they can to prevent you from getting close enough to order a drink, and the bartenders will acknowledge you wistfully, as though they understand your plight but can't permeate the jackass wall enough to actually take your order. But you must persevere. Even if it means getting your shit right up in someone's sambhar, you must persevere. Order more drinks than you need at the moment, and close your tab right away, because it will be the last time you have any face time with that bartender. Oh, and get up out of the sambhar as fast as you can, because homey is pissed. I mean, fuck him for not waiting for a table like the rest of us, but still. You don't want to get a beating over a hefeweizen. \n\nAnd speaking of the hefeweizen, I recommend the Pinkus Organic. It paired really well with the lightness of the food, and it's a refreshing post-workout beverage.\n\nThe menu at Dosa is stupefying. It's lengthy and exquisitely detailed (there is even an addendum spreadsheet for food allergies and vegans). Clearly, a Masala dosa is requisite, just as an archetype. I would also highly recommend you get the \"Idli Moons\" to share, though \"share\" will quickly become more like \"stab interloper with fork.\" And despite my professed craving for the \"lightness\" of the food, I found the bhatura to be my overwhelming favorite.

North Indian food is tasty and all, but sometimes I hanker for the food of my childhood. I haven't gotten around to learning many of my mom's recipes, so for the moment I search far and wide for a South Indian restaurant to satisfy my comfort food cravings (that doesn't involve driving to the South Bay).\r\n\r\nWhen my friends and I got there, I was impressed by the Mission hipster/modern decor. But things went quickly downhill from there. First they apparently lost the reservation that my friend had made and accused us of not making reservations. Luckily, it was early (6pm) so they could \"still seat us.\" They proceeded to take us to a table for 6 that was directly in front of a weird hanging partition. Combine that with the poor acoustics (I had a hard time hearing people on either side of me, let alone across the table), and I was put off.\r\n\r\nOkay, so the physical space wasn't the best. But I'm here for the food right? Yummy, crispy dosa, filled with spicy, flavorful potato curry, and sambar. Salivation. So to keep it simple, I order the most unfancy one off the menu.\r\n\r\nI was mystified by the presentation. What any self-respecting dosa maker puts the potatoes on the side? That's the thrill of eating a dosa. Dipping the crispy ends in sambar, working your way to the yummy potato center. Besides, eating dosa is messy as it is. Having to \"build my own dosa\" didn't help manners.

Its also possible that I managed to order the two joke dishes on the menu.  \r\n\r\nThe first moment of cognitive dissonance occured right after I walked in. I'm speaking of course, of the music. I'm  a fan of the bouncy groovy music - but it's quite odd having that as dinner music -- especially in an Indian place.  (In the music's defense, after that CD ended they changed back to the more traditional music that tends to be played in a place serving cuisine of the asian subcontinent.)\r\n\r\n(Side note to those looking for a romantic dinner: high ceiling + crowd  = trouble conversing.)\r\n\r\nThe second moment occured after I sat at the bar and got my first look around.  Is it just me, or does that food runner look just like Quentin Tarantino?  Okay - that's just odd.  Unless he's working on a film about the food industry and just wants some experience. \r\n\r\nThe waitstaff were friendly, but it was pretty obvious that they're just about out of steam - apparently they've been busy since they opened on Tuesday.  They brought a little plate of pappadum with my beer, which is a nice touch.\r\n\r\nSo those joke dishes I mentioned? Potato Croquettes and Tamil Lamb curry.\r\n\r\n- Potato Croquettes -- possibly a major ordering mistake.  Served with a splash of arugula and a side of ... ketchup.  I've been to piles of indian places, and the chutney of the \"57 varieties\" has never before made its apperance as a side dish.  (Or does that still count as a vegetable?)  The Croquettes were decent - could have been more intensely flavored, and crisper.  From the menu description I was more expecting a South Indian variety of Samosa.\r\n\r\n- Lamb Curry.  The curry itself was good.  I thought I detected a bit of raisin in the sauce.  Could have been spicier - but those of you who have eaten with me know that I like pretty much everything \"just a bit spicier.\"  \r\n\r\n(okay, actually my brother claims that when folks ask me if something is spicy or not, a caption should appear in front of me that reads: \"Professional driver. Closed Course. Do not attempt.\")\r\n\r\nSo the curry by itself was fine. They brought out with it a plate of rice - surrounded by more pappadum.  No really, I've still got plenty of pappadum on the other plate, that I was enjoying with my beer.  The basmati rice was ... unfragrant.  No cloves in this rice, no carrots, no saffron  - just a pile of white matter.\r\n\r\nWith \"Misrilou\" playing in my head, I walked from dosa disappointed.", "author": "Stephan W."}

For starters we had the Vada Sambar (you can probably guess from the comments above that I hated this dish), which comes with gooey dumplings (yuck) in sambar (double yuck), and the Dahi Vada, a lentil dumpling in yogurt and spices.  I have to say, I really enjoyed the Dahi Vada (particularly the presentation--it was beautiful with white and brown striping, you just have to see it) but again the price just wasn't worth it ($7 each).\n\nOther folks in my party ordered the lamb curry, which they said was amazing, the mysore dosa (so-so), and the seafood curry (okay).  Adding in three beers, our bill (including tip) came to about $120.  I think that's waaay too overpriced for what we got.  And, yes, the decor is pretty, but it was noisy, hot, and folks were crowded together (waiters were literally tripping over people). \n\nSo, even though it's good to try new things, I will probably not be going back.", "author": "Cassidy P."}

The food was good, not the best south indian I've ever had (not like the kind my friend's family fed me!), but the service was really terrible.  See, I'm the kind of person that usually makes reservations for this type of \"hip\" establishment, because it's the kind of place where you will have to wait eons otherwise.  However, that's exactly what happened anyway.\n\nA group of 5 of us arrived around our reservation time, and were told we had to wait.  About an hour and a half later my friends were more than annoyed, but I insisted we stay.  Once seated, I was so annoyed I couldn't really enjoy my dinner. The service left much to be desired, especially after waiting so damn long on the street.  I have not gone back since.\n\nUPDATE: After writing my review, not 30 minutes later I received an e-mail from one of the owners.  He apologized for the service and then turned around and told me that I was wrong about their reservation policy.  Like I once told a woman whose child kicked the back of my seat for the entirety of a 3 hour flight, don't apologize do something to address the problem.  Perhaps if he spent less time stalking yelpers who didn't rave about his place and more time actively managing the establishment so that these issues are resolved, then Dosa wouldn't have as many angry reviewers complaining about waiting and bad service.", "author": "Lorraine L."}

I was also inside most of the day Fighting the Good Fight with Photoshop CS2 and I couldn't bear to eat one more meal in front of a screen. So, out to Dosa we went...I can practically go there in my bathrobe.\n\nBut then, I don't think I'm ever going there again.\n\nThe first time I went to DOSA was when it  just opened, and let's say I was pretty unenthusiastic. It was basically a big $10 pancake with some thin, soupy Indian food smeared on it. But one night I ran into some rich friends who were standing outside in line in the icy mist, rosy cheeked, with such anticipatory smiles on their faces I thought maybe I should give it another try. \n\nThey said it was their \"favorite Indian restaurant.\" My current favorite is ROTI, despite the iffy service and the distinct feeling that it's mild Indian food for, uh, whatever the Indian word for gringos is. Gentiles? Goys? Whatever. I love Roti, but I didn't want to give up my parking space and drive to West Portal.\n\nSo last night started out a little disappointingly. We walk around the corner from my quiet, impressionist tree-lined street and guess what?Young hipsters! Hipsters with piercings and tattoos--well, yards more piercings and tattoos than colonize me and my boyfriend. Hipsters Out on a Friday Night!! Hipsters standing in line to experience the manna that is DOSA!\n\nThat star up there?That's for the Botticelli's Venus that was seating people. She was lovely and sweet and I wondered whether I had such nice curves when *I* was 23. I was bewitched by her. We waited half an hour, and my boyfriend and I shared an $8 glass of wine at the bar. I was thinking about Venus's creamy white shoulders when the bartender poured us extra wine. Which was nice because, well, when exactly did it become customary to only serve half a glass of wine? So I was cheered. But it all went downhill from there.\n\nWhat can one say about spending $14 on a bowl of sauce with two chicken bones in it? \"It looked so good on the menu.\" They have a great menu copywriter. I thought, \"This item here? with the 5 pancakes chosen by the chef? That HAS to be a lot of food!\" \n\nLike as if.\n\nThe chicken thigh bone was a bit too spicy for me, so I tried to attract the attention of our waitress to bring some, I dunno, chutney? Raita? Something sweet or cool to offset the hot and spicy and...did I detect bitter? It took quite a hub-bub to get those things. The waitress and the busboy looked appalled. Apparently chutney was only served with the pancake dish, which wasn't out of the kitchen yet. \n\nI looked down at my droopy little thigh bone (the one on my plate, with the sauce on it) and suggested they bring the chutney a tad early. The waitress sighed. Gringo, she thought. Wimp. I felt distinctly unhipper. How could I tell them I used to eat Indian food for two bucks on sixth street in the East Village before they were even born? (\"We used to walk six blocks in the snow to eat Indian food on sixth street! We used to DREAM of eating Indian food in a corridor!\")\n\nAfter the Disappointing Chicken we got six little latke-sized pancakes with a bowl of inedibly hot, meatless, vegetable-less brown glop (Was it soup? Was it sauce?) and a bowl of slightly more edible garbanzo bean stew. The pancakes were tasty. There was, however, a thimble-sized cup of something pale mint-green, that tasted of almonds or something. It had green flecks in it, I think, and it was without question the best thing on the table.\n\nWe were so unsatisfied that when the waitress came over to suggest dessert, I said we were looking forward to a pint of Ben and Jerry's in front of a Netflick. She finally smiled and said that sounded good to her, too. So I finally started to like her. After all, I was a waitress for 12 years. \n\nLet's just say, when you spend $50 for a cheap bite out on a chilly Friday night, you shouldn't be hankering for your pals Ben and Jerry to come over for a nightcap.\n\nThe decor is nice, though.", "author": "Caryn L."}

The noise levels were a little better it being a Sunday night, although the crowds were still cranking and we had a short wait for our table. Make a reservation, which are now available and plan to have a glass at the bar.  The Leitz riesling is a great wine to pair with any of the dishes and it's only 8% so you can drink up.  My eyes are always too big for my stomach at this joint and I once again am in a serious carb coma.  The Dahi Vada is awesome still and all the dosa's are worth trying. This place is becoming a local staple. End update*\r\n\r\n*Update 6/28/06 Returned for an 8o'clock dinner and was pleasantly surprised with my meal again. Especially the Dahi Vada which is a visual and gustatory splendor.  Although the noise issue hasn't been rectified, the food was even better than the last time and our waitress, although Mission hipster extraordinaire, was quite pleasant and knew her south indian cuisine. The Taj tallboy was a necessary addition to our otherwise fantastically spiced dinner.  For anybody who has been frustrated with over oiled indian dishes, I would highly recommend Dosa, to see how it can be done  proper.  My new request is reservations.  *end update*\r\n\r\nOriginal Review: \r\nDosa does a good job of re-reintroducing South Indian cuisine to San Francisco. The crowd is a Mission blend of everyone that makes the  hood so special. The food was good quality but not quite outstanding.  The atmosphere is busy cool but the noise levels made me feel like I was a grumpy old man. \r\n\r\nFor my personal gustatory pleasures, I prefer driving to  Cupertino or Fremont for my carb happy pleasures of dosas, idly, uttapams and sambhar. There is no bettter guilty pleasure than that warm cocunut chutney feeling when you look around and see that  you're the only white guy in the joint, and the kids are staring at you wondering how you discovered their secret.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you're not feeling the scenic 280,  Dosa is a good choice for South Indian,  so enjoy the tighty whitey waiters and the chitter chatter boom box.  FYI, for another version of authentic ethnic cuisine done well in a cool upscale style, check out either Limon down the street on Valencia.\r\n\r\nDosa is new to the scene, so I'll be checking back to watch their progress. As with all new endeavors, it takes time to work out the kinks in the curry.", "author": "Phil M."}

The restaurant is small, intimate and dimly lit, perfect for a date. However, the tables are pretty close together, so refrain from speaking dirty or baby talk to your date because the people next to you can hear you very clearly.\n\nThe majority of the menu is occupied with a list of dosa and uttapam. I'm too lazy to explain it what they are, so just go directly to their website http://dosasf.com/menu.html\nMiss K (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1Idc35tGsgkB3G2ntig0LA) got one of the dosas... can't remember which one. I got the paneer and peas uttapam, just because I like to be different. Nyah.\n\nNow, I have never had southern indian food before and have never even heard of dosa so I didn't know what to expect. The dosa was pretty big, compared to the uttapam. I was slightly disappointed about that at first because I was hungry and I picked the smaller dish. But by the end of dinner I was actually pretty full. The mango lassi probably had something to do with that because it was really really thick. A bit too sour for my tastes though.\n\nAnyway, the food was really good. all the dosa and uttapam are served with a lentil..something..something... soup (sorry, bad memory) and 2 different kinds of chutney. I couldn't tell which chutney I liked better because I keep mixing everything together. It tastes better that way! Besides, I was just following the \"tip for first timers\" on the menu. Basically it tells you to put a little bit of each chutney on a piece of dosa/uttapam, dip it in the soup and eat it. It's really good! I think the coconut/white chutney will burn your tongue slower than the red one, but the spiciness doesn't linger.\n\nLastly, our waitress (Christy?) was really nice and pleasant. And I notice that Dosa is the most diverse indian restaurant I've ever visited. Usually when I go to an indian restaurant, all the employees are indian guys. But Dosa employs all white, yellow and brown people. I thought that was pretty cool.", "author": "Ari C."}

I was in Rajasthan earlier this year (Northwest India) and ate in the homes of several Indian families.  And although DOSA is Southern Indian food, the food served here still definitely has that homecooked, authentic vibe to it.\n\nI actually loved all the dishes.  Lentil chicken was oh so tender....the prawn masala was savory and non-fishy....the Dahi Vada (lentil dumplings with yogurt) was hella good and I'm generally not into cold dishes or dumplings to be honest.  The Prawn chile fry appetizer was tasty but the portion was kind of small.  And the bhatura!!  I love this bread.  Big and puffy and slightly sweet.  Yum!\n\nOne of the drawbacks to this restaurant is that they don't take reservations.  We had to wait 15-20 minutes on a Thursday night for a table for 3.  I also circled 15-20 minutes looking for a parking spot and ended up finding one on 18th and Valencia. I can't imagine what the weekend wait and parking situation is like.

I think to confirm with the waitress when we place our order...  \"There are no nuts in these, right?\"  Turns out ALL of the dosas --every last one of 'em-- have nuts in them.

As a person who's known to eat raw jalapenos with his salad, I can handle the spice; unfortunately, most dates of mine haven't been able to. How about having 2 varieties of sambar, and mix the two in the desired proportion to get the right amount of heat? At Dosa, you have no choice: either take the flaming-hot sambar, or get something else (what else would you eat a dosa or idli with??)\n- the idli was pathetic. I have made idlis at home, and I remember the first time I made idlis: they were dense and gummy. Dosa's idlis had the same consistency. Real idlies are  fluffy and a bit coarse.\n- My date's dosa was a bit on the soggy side. \n\nFor those who are unaware of South Indian cooking, Dosa should be fine; just another ethnic restaurant with strangely spicy dishes.

Modern southern Indian cuisine, updated and inventive without being fusiony.  Upscale but informal trendy.  The namesake crepe-like dosa are fun and novel to us San Franciscans. You can have a good time here.  A foodie haven, a winning formula for ethnic food much like Cha Cha Cha,  Slanted Door, or Ti Couz.\n\nThe room is often packed to overflowing, couples touching their faces and playing with their hair, lost in each other more than the food.  An enthusiastic staff of unevent professionalism and expertise scurries through like water down a cascade, randomly tending to this or that.\n\nMy first visit was slightly disappointing.  The idea works, and a very good chef is at work.  The weakness is execution, particularly service.  The waiter was awkward, the ninja food runner hit-and-run, slapping things down to the point of sloshing on the table then dashing off without explanation or checking or cleaning up.  He kept tugging at our half-finished plates, touching and moving them before asking if we were done.  Eventually he  yanked them away with food still on them without asking.  When done we told the waitress and host we wanted the check, no dessert.  Then we got, you guessed it, dessert menus and one of those strip tease waiter routines to get you to eat sweets.  It's group service, so you get random treatment from a lot of different people.  Overall the service is quite attentive, just  frenetic and unpredictable.\n\nWine and alcohol is very expensive but food is quite reasonable.   $6 for a bottle of Anchor Steam?  Double no thanks.  But the crowd thinks otherwise, snapping up red wine by the bottle, nothing under $40, because that's what they like.  White wine is $8-11 a glass (they charge far more than the customary 1/4 of the bottle price for an ungenerous pour). \n\nThe \"fire broth\" was thin and enticing but small, incomplete, it left you wanting to eat other things.  I think that's the purpose.  So that one hit the mark.  Uttapam sampler had five seemingly identical open faced tacos with various sauces.  My dosa was an interesting crispy crepe but the potato filling, a solid hunk of food matter, was not completely satisfying.\n\nKitchen staff gets slammed with more orders than they can handle so things can come out a little uneven and needing seasoning corrections.  A few things could use a squeeze of lemon (which wasn't offered), a little more or less salt, a different condiment. \n\nThis place has lots of potential.  With better execution, simplifying the menu, a few key signature dishes, it will break out of just being a good times hangout to become a more serious restaurant.\n\nSecond visit - upgraded to four stars.  Not all the way there but closer.  Tried some more dishes and hit some jackpots.  A lamb curry, for one, and calamari appetizers.

Although their entire menu is not gluten-free (ask and they'll give you an allergen cheat-sheet that tells which allergens are in which foods), Dosa's focus on South-Indian cuisine reveals just how versatile gluten-free grains are, and how core those grains can be in some cultures. It'll make you feel like other cultures' foods were made for your tummy.\n\nThe pungent scent of Indian spices greets you at Dosa's door, and sticks to your clothes when you leave. Their menu focuses on two styles of South Indian pastry, including the dosas -- stuffed with vegetables, curried potatoes or paneer cheese -- and uttapams, which are more like pancakes with a variety of items mixed in. The dosas and uttapams are served with a pair of chutneys, typically coconut and tomato, as well as rich lentil soup that they cook for nearly a full day before bringing it to your table.\n\nDosa also offers an array of curries and a tasty range of appetizers -- but stay away from the spicy Chennai Chicken, which is unsuspectingly dusted with flour.

Once again, I wanted to hit one of the big hipster havens and write that, really, it was seriously over-rated.  I'm thrilled that Dosa proved me wrong, and provided a delightful dinner adventure.\n\nWe arrived, this Saturday evening, right when they opened. There were already 3 or 4 parties waiting but we were seated immediately in a fabulous window table.  It helps that it was a gorgeous July evening in the Mish, which made for great open-window dining.\n\nFrom the moment we sat down, the service was EXCEPTIONAL.  Our server was charming, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine.  I hate it when I ask a server for a suggestion and they reply with \"I dunno. (*giggle*) Everything is good!\"  Not at Dosa!  She had useful suggestions, and great explanations about every menu item and the wine to go with it! THANK YOU!\n\nIt's been a few years since I've had Southern Indian Food.  I love it.  It's hard to find so I consider it a big treat!  I wasn't sure if Dosa could live up to my hopes but they absolutely delivered -and then some.\n\nWe ordered from the prix fixe menu with wine pairings.  As each course was laid out, Steve and I argued over whose choice was better.  (I maintain that all of mine were.)  The food was DIVINE!  Each plate contained a symphony of deliciously spiced treats and just the right amount of cardamom--which to me means cardamom in everything.  \n\nI hate to say it, but I wasn't thrilled with all of the wine I sampled.  I had a pinot noir before dinner that I didn't even finish -and I LOVE pinots!  I also didn't expect the tempranillo that was paired with the 3rd course to be a rose.  If I could knock a half a star, I would, but everything else made up for it in spades.\n\nFour course prix fixe dinner for two with wine pairings and two extra cocktails came to $150.

Trendy Indian restaurants usually bring out cynical side of me, mainly because they lack the authenticity in the eating experience.   Cloth napkins?  I'll stick to the paper ones thank you very much.  Silverware?  The only eating utensil I need is attached to the end of my right arm.  Ceramic dishes?  What happened to the stainless steel plates with the three compartments?\n\nDespite this skepticism, the food was actually decent.  And entertaining.  One of the waiters came over and offered to show my friends and I how to eat the pani puri dish, but after seeing that there were two brown people at the table to provide assistance, he figured we could manage.  Little did he know, I'm an awful friend.  One of my buddies tried to carefully poke a hole in a puri and ended up shattering the whole thing.  Another poured the pani into his puri only for it to come leaking out all over his arm and the table.  My roommate just said f*** it, ate his puri and then took a swig of the pani.  Needless to say I laughed my ass off.  Almost as funny as watching me eat with chopsticks...\n\nThe bhel puri was excellent and the sambar that came with nearly every dish was suspiciously addicting.  I was not too pleased with my paneer utthapam (I guess the place is called \"Dosa\" for a reason) but liked most of my friends' dishes.  Waiting staff is also courteous and vigilant with the water refills...but we did go on Sunday for brunch when it wasn't too crowded.\n\nOverall, the food was good but seemed to be catered to fit the chic ambiance of the restaurant...in other words, it was overpriced ($8 for a plate of six pani puris?  Aren't Indians supposed to be frugal?)  The taste is more westernized as well, so I probably wouldn't bring my Indian parents here (that would be equivalent to bringing your Asian parents to P.F.

Because I am perplexed at the high ratings.\n\nEverything started great: cool atmosphere, packed room, great service, great explanation of the Dosas. And the starter, recommended by the waiter, was excellent: Chennai Chicken, boneless chicken marinated in yogurt, spiced and fried, served over greens. So far, I'm liking it.\n\nProblem #1: _Do not_ order the tasting menu. At $39, it's expensive for what you get. My Lamb Kofta had two meatballs the size of nickels. A complete disappointment for what I was paying. My friends who avoided the tasting menu had reasonable servings at reasonable prices.\n\nProblem #2: _Beware_ of going with a party of 6 or more. We had 7 and received a 20% service charge, rather steep, but when Dosa slaps on another 4% surcharge for S.F. Heath Care, you end up with everything on menu really 33% higher with tax, tip, and surcharge.\n\nPaying $85 for one beer, one glass of wine, one tasting menu, where the main is tiny is absurd.\n\nAside from feeling gouged, I wish Dosa could solve the pricing problem. Some of the food is very good. Some of the Dosas average. It nets out to Decent Indian food in a cool atmosphere for high prices. Pass.\n\nP.S. I too have been emailed by the owner. Although I appreciate his thoroughness in reading these reviews, he needs to take to heart the criticism on price/quality/portion.

Overall, it kind of makes the anticipation of going more stressful than it ought to be.  But what can you do?  \n\nIt was actually quite easy to get a table here: we were a party of 5 so I simply made a same-day reservation on OpenTable.  I had heard recommendations of doing the tasting menu, but with 5 people it was really much cheaper to order a la carte.  We ordered two sambars, lamb vindaloo, vegetable korma, channa, a paneer dosa, a masala uttapam, and an extra bhatura.  It turned out to be more than enough.\n\nI guess it's important to note that Dosa is *not* just a typical indian menu plus dosas.  They're serious about doing it south-indian here.  Not that I'm an expert on south indian, but I do know north indian and this is not it--they don't even have naan (but don't worry, fellow naan-lovers: the bhatura will win you over with its oily goodness).  There's also precious little in the way of meat dishes.\n  \nIronically, though, we actually found the curry dishes, not the dosa/uttapam, to be the highlights.  My personal favorite was the korma--worlds apart from the rich, buttery stuff you get at Roti--which was loaded with cloves or something, because each bite was like spicy Christmas in your mouth.  Still, the dosas have a subtle, nut-infused deliciousness of their own.\n\nDosa is well known for doing wine pairing, but my experience is that every indian dish needs a different type of wine, so we just went with Soju cocktails (and by the way, Soju has officially reached hipster saturation at this point--witness Soju & Vitamin Water, the official drink of the Treasure Island festival).  Of course, I still maintain that beer or scotch are the optimal drinks for indian.\n\nAll in all, don't let the hype hold you back (or drive you here against your better judgement).

Maybe you can understand why my Dosa love is unenthusiastic, and more like a \"Dosa?.....Don't-sa sound so good unless we are going on a date.\"\n\nFirst the BAD:\nDosa = Not great for large parties.  Read: parties over 5 people.  Who don't travel together.  In packs.  Tied at the hip.  Admittedly we had a party of 8.  Two of which were stuck behind a car accident they could do nothing about.  Yet, they refused to seat us,  and despite having reservations (AT 5:30, when no one was there), we amicably bellied up to the bar to wait. Which leads us to my next two observations...\n\nDosa = Kinda small, and one hell of a dinky walkway between the bar and the dining area.\n\nDOSA = Bar-tendress was a totally unfriendly, unhelpful, and downright rude.  We were all dressed to the 9's, being delightfully polite,  and ordering many wondrous, not-so-cheap foo-foo drinks.  Go figure.  Next time I will sit there, taking up space, swearing like a sailor in my gym clothes, while sticking out my tongue.  And I will be ordering many, many, mixed virgin cocktails. \n\nHell hath no fury like a birthday girl scorned by a crabby bar-tendress.\n\nSo here's what I don't get, Dosa.  You know we're a large party, with 6 nicely dressed, polite people, obviously drinking/spending a crap-load of money for a birthday dinner...Why not just seat us in the table you've set aside for us anyway, let us order a bottle of champagne and some appetizers and kick it for the 20 minutes we have to wait (while getting the hell out of your walkway...)?\n\nThe GOOD =\nDosa= Finally sat us, after some finagling, and didn't blink an eye when the 2 late-comers hopped in our table, prior to our ordering.  Our waitress handled it oh-so-amazingly well (yay, things start looking up!), and was super helpful in aiding us in our culinary choices. \n\nDosa= Waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable about their cuisine, and make excellent recommendations.  They posses the key to de-mystifying the wonder that is the food of Dosa.  \n\nDosa= As everyone says, delicious food and drinks.  I had the lamb curry, and for my first baby sheep experience, it was quite a heavenly de-virginizing. We passed around our various dishes and each one of them was presented beautifully, and tasted great.\n\n\nCONCLUSION = Dosa good for dates.  Dosa BAAAD for big birthday.  Dosa likes you when you're eating, and likes picking out good things for you to eat.  Dosa bartendress does not like you (or anyone else for that matter, it seems).  \n\nIf I rated Dosa on food and drink alone, it would easily be a 4-5 star shot.  But half of the experience rests on the customer service..and that ranged from absurd, to great, and back to bizarre at the end.  \n\nThanks for the mediocre customer service experience...with the great food...I guess.", "author": "Christy B."}

We got there early and were seated right away, but by 7:30, the place was packed with a line out the door.\n\nI'll admit from the start, I'm a fan of northern Indian food over Southern so my tastebuds created an argument against this place long before I unfolded my napkin. In the end, I found the food rather average. The Masala Dosa was slightly bland and the accompanying sauces, though filled with potential, lacked punch. The lamb dish was decent, but not impressive. The sauce was fairly bland, the meat a little tough and the rice sparse.\n\nFortunately, the chai and the service were great.", "author": "sara s."}

He walked us through the differences between North and South Indian food in a way that, despite that he must have to acclimate to the hipster population to work there, wasn't bored and condescending. He was pleasent and competant and made up for the so-so food and pretentious people everywhere. So-so food because you have higher standards the more of the hard-earned that you're dropping.\n\n**Beware that the owner is a little unclear on how to make folks like his place better.

Generally speaking Indian spice and my GI system don't get on too well.  But I had a feeling I would do OK at Dosa.  Yelp definitely turned me on to this place, though I had noticed its enticing orange interior and styling storefront before.  It seemed worth a try.\n\nIt. Was. All. Delicious.\n\nNow, does someone who knows very little about Indian culture and who generally avoids Indian food loving your restaurant speak in its favor or to its detriment?  I'll let you decide.\n\nThe Dahi Vada (lentil dumplings drowned in - like, literally hidden underneath a flood of - Strauss Organic Yogurt (not sure why the brand is so important as to be on the menu, but whatever) )was a delightful mix of spicy, crunchy, cool, refreshing, minty, salty, sweet YUM.  Leftover yogurt made a great dip for Papadums.  \n\nWe had a curry with prawns and tomatoes, the name of which is escaping me (ie, it's not on their online menu, which I am obviously consulting because I have a total mental block for non-Latin-based languages - and French, incidentally).  It was another spicy salty sweet sensation of flavor which encouraged me to eat way beyond my comfort level of fullness.  Delicate, savory basmati rice accompanied.\n\nWe split a Dosa as a main entree.  My dining partner pulled some kind o f two-Dosa hibrid with the waitress.  As it was already stuffed with farmer's cheese and peas and spices, it was not much for dipping in the overabundance of unidentifiable chutneys, plus the lentil/eggplant soup thing (internet says: \"Mysore\" - which they served on the side instead of spread).  I used a spoon.  The combination sent me into a place of isolated deep contentment, from which it was hard to hold a conversation.  I was sad we could not finish it, that we once again ordered too much food.\n\nI like the innovative menu, nevermind my need to be coached by a professional through the ordering process.  There is much of intrigue to try here, and that encourages me to come back.  Everything was exectued well and the space was intimate and not too noisy.  This place is a winner.\n\nDid I just write winner?", "author": "Jennifer B."}

So, I was excited to try DOSA after hearing good things.\n\nBy the look that our waitress gave us, we seemed to have ordered a lot.  We started with the DOSA version of chicken fingers - tasty but nothng spectacular.  Then came our lentil dumpling appetizer that was smothered in an artistic display of mint puree, yogurt, and some kind of plum sauce....there was a lot of sauce.  I like to be saucy, but not to eat food that is super saucy!  Good sauce, but still we decided that it was a classic case of \"diminishing marginal value.\" \n\nThe lamb stew was delicious with just the right amount of spice...and oh so tender.

We showed up around 7:45 and were told there was a 20 minute wait so we headed up to The Make-Out Room for a drink. When we returned (I think we missed our spot) we were informed that it would be another ten to fifteen.  I have zero patience and contemplated trying someplace less crowded. Luckily we decided to stick it out. The hostess came out side to let us know that our table had opened up ...and it was on. It was extraordinarily loud in the restaurant but I didn't really feel like it hindered our conversation at all and I'm the soft spoken type. \r\n\r\nWe started with the Organic Greens, Mango & Sheep's Feta Salad. Those flavors accompanied by red onion, toasted walnuts and topped with an understated (didn't overpower the other flavors) yet amazing cilantro dressing definitely made for a great beginning. I had the Spring Marsala dosa and my dinner companion had the Paper\r\nMasala. Both were excellent and I'm a meat mouth.\r\n\r\nA new word has been added to my lexicon. That word is Sambar. The menu describes it as \"a flavorful lentil dipping soup made with vegetables\". Flavorful is the understatement of the century. Soooo Gooood! I think our server mentioned something about 31 different spices but I was slightly distracted by the little voice in my  head repeating \"Go Gene, Go Gene, Get busy, Its your birthday\" and the dull roar of a packed restaurant as I savored this delectable (There's crack in it) soup.\r\n\r\nDosa gets five stars for excellent food and the fact even though they are doing well (I've got to  assume) yet haven't forgotten what hospitality is all about.

You take one look and you can tell it's a charming place. The signage is nice, the decor looks fabulous, the music is cool and the crowd waiting outside looks hip and hungry.\n\nI was warned the wait would be long. I just didn't think I'd spend the whole night starving.\n\nI anticipated it being crowded so I showed up there around 8ish to put my name on a list for a large group. The hostess said the wait would be 1hr 20mins. I gulped but accepted it.\n\nCame back with crew 1hr 30 mins later. No luck. This is where starvation beings.\n\nThe hostess just sucked. Granted, it's a hard job dealing with a bunch of hungry people who want to sit and eat. But you can't just ignore them. Part of the job is working with customers, the more proactive, the better. \n\nWe constantly had to go to the hostess instead of her coming to us to find out what the hell was going on. How much longer would we wait? At one point she said that they stop seating at 11pm and we'd surely eat before then. I couldn't believe my ears. \n\nAfter a while, I had the distinct feeling that the hostess wasn't being genuine with me or the other patrons. I often heard her using the same excuses like, \"Oh the people at your table are about to leave..\" or \"the people at your table are eating dessert\" or \"the people at your table are just sitting there and we're waiting for them to leave.\" While the hostess was civil, her concerns for the patrons was definitely not genuine. \n\nAt hearing this, people with baited breath would wait another 20-30 mins while the people at the tables they were waiting for were supposedly \"done and just sitting there.\" Please. We saw people come and go and be seated and it didn't make sense that a group took 30-45 mins to order dessert and pay.\n\nWe ended up waiting a total of 2 hours (2 HOURS!) and sat around 10ish. I heard no apologies from the hostess when we sat. \n\nI can understand if patrons are lingering, ordering dessert, whatever. But keeping customers waiting indefinitely is just wrong. Giving them really bad time estimates is just wrong. If I knew we'd be eating at 10:15 instead of 9:30, I surely would've gone elsewhere and come back to Dosa another time. \n\nFoodwise: The spring dosa was decent, the vegetable korma wasn't. Maybe it was my fault ordering korma at a south Indian restaurant. The spring dosa was good but not any better than one could find at any other decent dosa place for much cheaper. \n\nThe only reason why I'm not giving 0 stars is a person who seemed to be the owner/manager came to us and sincerely apologized for us waiting so long. He was very kind and removed the obligatory tip from our bill. He also explained that it was an especially busy night. \n\nUnfortunately, our whole group was brewing angrily outside for the extra 45 minutes we waited (on top of the 1hr 20 mins we were told) and the damage was done. \n\n(In all fairness, we still tipped a fair amount because we did not want to blame the waiter for our unpleasant experience as our waiter did a decent job.) \n\nSo, patrons, consider yourself warned. Dosa, the food was good but not worth the wait. Personally, I'll be looking for other South Indian restaurants next time I get my craving for dosas.\n\nHere' my breakdown:\nHostess: 0 stars.\nWaitress: 4 stars. \nOwner/Manager: 5 stars.\nFood: 4 stars.

Honestly, we were so incredibly disappointed, I've been tossing up giving a two star rating.  However my other visits do not justify two stars, so I am going with a three... for now.  \n\nFirst of all, to make a reservation for 5, they request a credit card number.  What?!  This isn't a white table cloth, high end restaurant... what the heck?  Someone please explain this logic, because I just don't get it.\n\nThe food was decent.  We started with an order of Pani Puri.  We've been for Sunday Brunch, so we knew what these were all about and were very much looking forward to it.  However, these came out stale.  Possibly day old from Sunday brunch?  They weren't crisp, and it wasn't easy breaking through them with a spoon.  Incredibly disappointing.  The Fiery Fruit was great as always.  There were five of us, so we ordered several dosas and uttapams.  They were great, however two of them were so similar we couldn't tell them apart.  Wish our server would have enlightened us about this fact when we placed our order.  \n\nWhile our server was pleasant (blond with glasses), and competent, nothing particularly shined.  Another server came and brought out some of our dishes, she was incredibly unpleasant.  (medium brown hair) Her attitude was horrible, and it was noticeable in her tone, and her body language.  She even seemed to purposely run into one of the bus boys because he was in her way.  Another turn off.   \n\nI should also mention, the gentleman filling my water spilled some in my dipping sauces and on the table without apologies or acknowledgement.  Not a droplet, but a decent amount spilled and landed in my sauces.  My boyfriend sitting across the table from me, chuckled a bit when he saw the whole thing, and the guy heard him, and slammed the water down on the other side of our table.  Um, yeah.  What do I really say to that?  I'm typically pretty darn easy going when it comes to service, and dining, but this was straight out of control.   \n\nI should mention one more good and bad experience for the evening...  When we paid the bill, we didn't notice the automatic 20% added for gratuity.  Apparently that's their policy, a party of 5 or more automatically receives 20% gratuity.  Doesn't that seem a bit excessive?  A 5 top is considered a large party?  I don't know.  We didn't notice it, and someone, possibly the floor manager, brought it to our attention.  That was one of the very few redeeming qualities of the night.  So thank you for bringing this to our attention.   \n\nUgh, I just don't know if this experience is deserving of three stars, but I'm going with it based on my past experiences there.  Maybe this was a severely off night.  Again, our food was mostly decent, but we left feeling like we paid a lot for what... some decent but not outstanding food, and mediocre to sub-par service.  What happened???  Dosa used to be a favorite of mine.  I'm afraid it will be some time before we return to this neighborhood spot.", "author": "Kelly K."}

Dosas and uthappams are simple South Indian breakfast food although getting increasingly getting complex and sometimes overly so. Dosa has the basics you cannot go wrong with- the simple masala, paper, and rava. Others are questionable-like the truffle one or the three-cheese one. The chutneys and sambhar accompaniments were tasty as was the rasam.  If you are a spicy food buff, don't miss the habanero-mango masala dosa. The chutney burns but is worth it. The selection of other curry dishes were a bit limited for a vegetarian but this is a dosa place and you go there to get,  umm, dosas (see note on service below). The dessert menu was tempting but other than the rasa malai which was well done, others were a bit disappointing and not worth the price tag. Just go to bi-rite.\n\nWhich brings me to service which in this occasion was a little wanting. The waitress was trying to change everything people were ordering to the point where I was going ask her to pay the bill as well. She was over blowing the habanero chutney (which she insisted be on the side instead of inside the dosa) to be some sort of Krakatoa in a cup which turned out to be fiery but not volcanic as she made it out. She also questioned our choice of too many dosas claiming that they will taste the same but once again this is a dosa place and in food savvy sf, even the non-indian locals know a thing or two about Indian food and how to order. \n\nOverall a bit pricy but worth the experience.

If you've ever had high-quality, authentic Indian food, this place will severely disappoint. The spices have no zing to them and taste as if they've been in the freezer for a year or two. Both our dosas and udapam were quite bland. The dahl was the one redeeming element of the meal, being quite tasty.\n\nSecond, high prices... Maybe these prices are normal for the city (I'm from the peninsula and so don't eat in SF all that often), but this place really seemed overpriced to me. The decor was classy--they were going from a contemporary Indian look from what I could tell--so maybe that hiked up the price a bit. However, it seems to me that if you're going for contemporary, then the food as well as the decor should be so, and this was definitely not the case. In any case, fabulous Indian food is definitely available elsewhere at this price.\n\nFinally, the non-Indian wait-staff. First of all, it is just a little strange to be eating Indian food and being served by a 100% white wait staff. yes, perhaps I should be open to new concepts, but it just feels rather non-authentic.

They're pretty serious about not seating people that haven't closed their tabs. \n\nAK said that the service had been spotty in the past, but we were blessed with one of the most professional, attentive servers I've had in recent memory. Water glasses sat empty for less than a minute before being refilled; Amir steps outside for a minute and leaves his napkin on his chair, and someone comes by and folds it. They're completely out of mind until the moment you need something, and then they're gone again, like The Others on Lost except they refill your water glasses instead of stealing your children. \n\nThe place itself packs a crowd without inducing claustrophobia, it's warm but not stuffy, tasteful and trendy but not pretentious. And the owners are nice. I'll be back next time I'm craving latkes, stew, crepes, and wings but don't want to hit four different restaurants.", "author": "matthew r."}

Dosa is one of those places. I am not super familiar with South Indian fare, but I know Nish (my friend on Yelp) loves Dosa and so do some of the people I know in the real world, so I have really been wanting to check it out. Friday night I was finally able to team up with my partner in crime Jen O. for an early dinner and we both agreed on Dosa.\n\nWe decided we would try the 4 course tasting menu, because the portions are a bit smaller and since there was two of us we ordered two things from each course and shared. Plus, at $30 per person, this is pretty reasonable. \n\nWe also did the wine pairing and shared, so for $16 each we got to sample six wines. I don't recommend the wine pairing though, because though the wines are actually quite good and so is the food, The wine does not enhance the flavor of the food because the spice wipes out the wine. Honestly, Jen and I both agreed that a nice cold glass of beer would have been better with our meals. \n\nSo here is what we had. My favorites are marked by an *.\n\n1. Starter Course \n\n* Cochin Calamari -Tender calamari, saut\u00e9ed with a mildly-spiced coconut milk sauce, served with mixed greens. (Incredible)\n\nDahi Vada - Lentil dumplings, topped with cool Strauss organic yogurt, piped with tamarind & mint, mildly spiced (Too beautiful to eat - but we managed.)\n\n2. Mini Dosa\n\nPaneer Dosa - Dosa filled with spiced, grilled farmer's cheese, peas and cilantro. (Excellent)\n\n* Chatni Masala Dosa - Our signature South Indian savory crepe filled with creamy, spiced Indian potatoes, onions, cashew nuts with a spiced chutney spread of blended baby eggplant (Excellent x2)\n\n3. South Indian Curry\n\n** South Indian Lamb Kofta - Spiced natural & free-range lamb meatballs in a creamy sauce of tomatoes & spinach served with lemon basmati rice and raita (Yes, it is as good as it sounds).\n\n* Kerala Chicken & Cauliflower - Tender free-range chicken in a grated coconut sauce with green beans and tomatoes, with basmati rice and raita made with Strauss organic yogurt (Delicious)\n\n4. Dessert \n\n* Kulfi (Indian Ice Cream) -Pistachio\n\nGulab Jamoon -Two soft, lightly-fried milk and dough balls served in a warm, cardamom flavored sugar syrup (Almost identical in taste and texture as pancakes soaked in syrup, except no maple taste. Too sweet for me).\n\nAmbiance - We were seated in a roomy corner next to an open window on a warm night in the Mission district - Bitchin'\n\nService - It was great. Our server was really cool and whenever she was too busy to get to us, she sent her crew to make sure we were comfortable and cared for.", "author": "J F."}

We had one of the egg dosas, which was delicious and came with the best bowl of dahl I've ever tasted.  They also have some chaat entree dishes that they don't have in the evening, which were excellent.  We had two chaats and one egg dosa split between two people and we were full and happy.\n\nService was super friendly and attentive.   Fresh plates and a cleanly-wiped table between the starters and the main course, which even some fancy restaurants neglect to do.  We were there right at opening, 11:30, so they weren't very busy yet, but I was still impressed with the service.\n\nMy only gripe is the coffee, which was some kind of Indian sweetened coffee with milk that I didn't like.  I'm sorry, but I just really need three thumping strong cups of black, rich, coffee at brunch.  I know this was Indian brunch, but if you can have a Bloody Mary or Champagne at Indian Brunch, I don't see why you can't have a gut-eroding cup of Ritual or something like that.   Nor was the tea selection extensive.  If you like black tea but don't like Earl Grey, you're out of luck.\n\nWe were out of there for under $50 with a big tip, and will be back, though I might BYO coffee next time.", "author": "Vince D."}

Dosa is certainly not the place to visit if you're in a rush and I'm certainly very grateful when people chose to wait.   \n\nIf you grew up in India, like I did, a few minutes here and there is just part of life and you learn to take it in stride.  :-) \n\nI'm not sure where you've had dosas before but I imagine even though you're of Indian origin (judging from your name) you neither grew up in India nor are you Southern Indian.   On the other, I and three of my chefs grew up in India with authentic Southern Indian fare.   \n\nI'm okay if you don't like our food (I don't expect everyone to), however, there is  *nothing* \"fusion\" about our recipes.

I ended up waiting over an hour for my table, but the hostess was amazing. When the 20 minute wait turned longer, she brought fresh pappadam ONTO THE STREET for me and my 3 friends to munch on. When 10 more minutes passed, she came out herself to apologize that the party before us was lingering so long, and comp us a free appetizer. Menu in hand, she had us choose a selection there, and sure enough, it was delivered to us (with more pappadam) the moment we sat.\n\nThe food from there was spectacular, the waiters wonderful, and after the meal they were friendly and let US linger, even when we asked if we were holding up another table. (They said we were not and assured us they would let us know so we didn't shaft another party like we'd been.)\n\nThis place is fantastic. Great food, great service, the whole deal.

This cannot be a dosa place!\" I tell myself this the entire time I'm waiting for a table, getting seated, ordering, eating and leaving the restaurant. Dosa restaurants generally do not have romantic lighting, a full bar with amazing mixed drinks/wines, tables of well-dressed customers and waitstaff that fawn over you. It was a welcome surprise...although I did feel slightly under-dressed since I thought I was coming to a regular Dosa place. \n\nWe started with the Chili Bhajia. Not sure what kind of peppers they use but this was really really good. Fried to the perfect amount, tasty, not overpoweringly spicy and just all round deelish. The plate was cleaned out in about 4 seconds. I ordered the Bhattura for my dinner. A huge, round fluffy piece of fried dough (yes...I threw any healthy notions out the door) served with a side of channa masala (garbanzo beans in an onion-tomato gravy). The Bhattura was sweet. I've never had a sweet Bhattura ever and I have to say it was not a welcome change. The Channa was fresh and tasted rather good but the Bhattura just ruined my meal. The rest of my table ordered various types of Dosas. The plain dosa tasted good as it was super crispy. Getting that consistency and crispiness is a feat and I applaud the chef. My husband ordered the Dosa with the Spinach/Cauliflower Curry. The dosa (plain) was of course amazing. The curry...wow...overpowering with garam masala and it tasted like someone had emptied many curry powders over the veggies. Not good. Props to them for creating very interesting chutneys such as harbanero which made my husband cry (literally) with happiness. \nWe ended the meal with Yogurt Rice...these guys use Strauss Yogurt which is my favorite brand to use when eating Yogurt Rice...so they id their research and came up with the perfect end to the meal. \n\nYou are paying solely for the ambiance and location when here. A dosa at excellent dosa places (Saravana Bhavan for example) would run about 5-6 dollars. A Dosa here at \"Dosa\" costs about 13-15 dollars. My Batthura cost me around $13. At any other Indian restaurant, it would have run me about $5 (including the Channa Curry). For these prices, I better get myself some amazing food. In fact the next day, I went to Saravana Bhavan and Dasaprakash in the San Jose area and had a much superior meal - taste-wise. \n\nDon't think I will be back again because I know how good South Indian food tastes having eaten it everyday growing up. This is not it. The decor and service is great but the food needs some serious work.\n\nUPDATE ON SEP, 21 2010\n\nI received a message from Dosa's owner mentioning that their higher prices are due to the fact that they use local, sustainable ingredients and that all employees get healthcare and are paid well. Great...I applaud that attitude. \n\nI still think that the entire experience (primarily due to the lackluster food) is a 2 star review. \n\nAlso, the owner added this in the message that I thought I should call out: \"We generally don't compare ourselves to the South Indian restaurants in the South Bay but rather to the home-cooked food and the cuisine we grew up with in India.  :-)\"\nI am comparing this meal with my childhood meals growing up in a South Indian household with my parents and grandparents and eating such food every single day. I'm also comparing Dosa's food to that of other South Indian Restaurants in the Bay area.", "author": "Sing V."}

While a US citizen, he returned at least once a year and came back with a suitcase full of his mother's own ground spices including the only rasam powder I had ever known.  His wife, impressed that I knew and liked south Indian food given we were in Philadelphia, gave me powder from their private stash, taught me to make rasam and introduced me to other ingredients I hadn't used before like jagary and fresh curry leaves.

So I'm spoiled for life on that account.\n\nThat said, I really liked everything else I've tried here so far.  I was glad to see cachumber salad on my first visit but sorry to see it re-named chopped salad on my second.  It is a pretty confetti of diced cucumber, red onion, tomato, carrot, red and green bell papper with a chili/lemon dressing over four romaine leaves that serve as nice scoops.

Here, you'll find mostly vegetarian with a single chicken appetizer and a few meat based curries. The main courses revolve around dosa and uttapam - vegetable filled crepes and pancake like chickpea breads with added in vegetables and spices.\r\n\r\nArriving at 7pm, we were lucky to be able to get a table - a single two-seater that had just become available. Considering that a group of four that had arrived just before us had been quoted a 1.5 hour wait for a table, we felt  that this was a good omen.\r\n\r\nThe food? Wonderful. I started with the Chicken Chennai - spicy chickpea battered chicken served over mixed greens and garnished with slivered red onion - which was fantastic, possibly the second best Indian chicken dish I have had, surpassed solely by Mehfil's Chicken Laccha. Following that was the Coriander and Chili Uttayam - perfect on its own and magically made better by dipping it in the wonderful coconut chutney.\r\n\r\nDosa's decor was also quite nice - using deep salmon colors accented by brown wood and frosted glass partitions. From a restaurant flow perspective, the bar was too crowded, making it difficult to follow the maitre d' to our table. The bathrooms were clean and the service seemed to lack any noticable defects aside from the fact that our main courses came a little too quickly after our appetizers.\r\n\r\nTwo appetizers, two main courses, three beers and a \"chai russian\" - a variant of a white russian using chai and soju instead of Kahlua and vodka came to $61 without tax. We'll certainly return here - next time saving room to try one of the tempting desserts.\r\n\r\nNo reservations for parties of 4 or less and no hard alcohol.

Besides bad puns, I have a problem with eating Indian food in that it will make me sweat uncontrollably (even when the food isn't all that spicy).   It's especially embarrassing when I am the ONLY person in the restaurant pouring out of my pores.  \n\nFood:  3 stars.  Dosa and Amber India are the only places that my friends from Bangalore, India were impressed with.  That's a good indicator of the authenticity of the food.  However, I would skip the appetizers.  The medu vada, served with sambar and chutney, tasted quite bland.  The South Indian Tomato soup, described as delicately flavored with spices, could have been the \"fire broth\" as far as I was concerned.  There was nothing delicate about it.  Thankfully, the dosas and curries hit the spot, especially the paneer dosa (highlight of the night), chatni masala dosa and lentil chicken, which was so tender.  I didn't care so much for the South Indian Moon Uttapam, which felt like a waste of money and came with the same damn chutneys and sambar we got with the appetizer.  For dessert, we had the cheesecake, the most non-Indian dessert on the menu, and it wasn't half bad.\n\nService:  2 stars.  Our server was clueless.  We ordered everything family style and all the dishes came out at once.  There was absolutely no room on our table to fit all of the dishes.  As we were trying to maneuver the plates around and clear up space, he even came by and asked us how the food was - before we even had a bite!\n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.  The space is modern and cool, with a mixed crowd that mostly skews towards the younger side.  A couple of issues I had was the heat in the dining room, which was another catalyst for my sweat, and the lack of a reservation policy for tables under 5. \n\nHits:   Lentil chicken, dosas (especially the paneer dosa).\n\nMisses:  Medu vada, South Indian tomato soup, South Indian Moons uttapam.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Amber India, Vik's Chaat Corner, Pakwan, Shalimar", "author": "Keith C."}

Either way it's expensive, but this doesn't seem to bother me so much when it's three blocks away at 11am on a Saturday and I'm with Laura Holden who has now moved to Oregon...so well..\n\nAnd then there's that server I love, I love him, but I do not like some of the other people. Fortunately I usually don't deal with them, I deal with Mr. nice tall guy. \n\nIn any case, there is one thing I still crave and can't find anywhere else: The Dahi Vada. Yeah you don't know what that is, but I'm here to tell you. It's a yogurt lover's god, and a heart burner's savior made with nothing but the best, Stauss organic yogurt (how much better could you get?). Lentil dumplings live in this bunch of orgasmic holy land mildly spiced and piped with mint and tamarind. The sour taste mixed with the slightly crunchy exterior of the dumplings is comforting and full bodied in flavor. I savor each moment for sure.\n\nI regularly order the South Indian Moons (my server tells me I never fail with this one) which consists of five uttapams (I find them better than Dosa) which are served with the sambar, channa, and chutneys. Basically one of these dipping sauces is spicy and brothy. The other two are pasty one coconut flavored, the other with a tomato bisque flavor. \n\nI don't think the Moons are anything worth crying over, but they're definitely tasty, with their spiciness taking full reign over their fat appeal. They are def. much better than the curries though.\n\nIn any case, I like South Indian food, I do, so I go here, but I don't like their curries.

And that means that they miss a few beats here and there, but hey, at least they're trying.  I absolutely adore Indian cuisine, but rarely does it stray from the usual suspects -  chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, blah, blah, blah.  I was delighted not to understand half the menu at Dosa.  \n\nI have never raved about pappadam before, but dang, this stuff melted in my mouth!  I had to order a second basket.  And a second beer...\n\nTo start was the \"Five Indian Moons\", a sampler of five uttapams.  To be fair, I only loved the \"Paneer &amp;Peas\" uttapam, but I still think it's worth ordering the sampler, if it's your first time.\n\nOf course, order dosa; it is their namesake, if you haven't noticed.  I prefer plain, so I can scoop chutney to oblivion.  I tried the three-cheese dosa, and I never thought I'd ever say such a thing, but there was actually too much cheese, and it overpowered the delicate dosa.  I can't believe I just said that.\n\nService is OK.  A bit too professional and sterile, if you ask me.  And they can never keep my damn water glass full.  Maybe I should order my food less spicy; perhaps I should take some accountability here...\n\nI have been to both locations, and I'm torn as to which I prefer.  If you're lookin' for a chic night out with a beautiful chandeliered bar and beautiful manicured people, go to Fillmore.  If you're feelin' low-key, and just want to eat goddammit, go to the Mission.  \n\nEither way, just go.  I have not yet seen another Indian restaurant break away from the norm as successfully as Dosa has.  I'll certainly be back soon.", "author": "Monique B."}

Why would I go to a place with Indian cuisine if I don't like curry?  Well, not everything is a curry dish and my friends love this place so I wanted to be a sport and try it out.\r\n\r\nThis place is obviously very popular as can be seen by the number of people dining here right up until closing time.  My group had a wait of about 20 minutes which is really a short wait compared to many places I've eaten.  Waiting for good food is just something you have to learn to accept.  While waiting I had a lychee infused soju.  The soju flavor was actually pretty strong which threw me off because most soju I have had didn't have a strong flavor.  It tasted a lot like the overly syrupy lychee martinis that my roommate makes, bu this wasn't at all syrupy.  If you like soju though I think this is a definite must try, but probably not for someone who has never had soju or is very picky about their alcohol.\r\n\r\nFor my meal I had the Paneer and Peas.  I was very happy with this dish.  It was cheesy and the peas were not all mushy.  The chutneys they give you with this dish is a great accompaniment.  I had a bite of a shrimp dish that was good and a bite of something with eggplant that was wonderful.  The mango lassie that I drank was so refreshing.  I loved it.  I would order a pitcher of it if I could.\r\n\r\nI didn't have any problems with the service.  We got our table as soon as the space became available.  We didn't have to sit and stare at a dirty table hoping that someone will clean it for us to be able to sit down.  Our drink orders were taken promptly and we weren't pushed to order until we were ready.\r\n\r\nIf you do like Indian cuisine, not just curry dishes I would highly recommend this place.  It's more accurate of my experience to say that Dosa deserves at least 3.5 stars.", "author": "Luis M."}

I selected the uttapam sampler (moon something or another), Issy had the peas and paneer uttampa, and Jess had the Mysore Masala Dosa. Everything was de-lusious! Im looking foward to a return visit (hopefully soon) with a bigger appetite so i can try some of their apps, salads, and desserts.\n\nUpdate:\nIve been back since and have expanded beyond the uttapams and dosas.

Dosa wrapped up the evening very nicely. We got a table in about 15 min, not bad for a saturday night, and the staff was super efficient and friendly.\n\nThe spring dosa was good, though the accompanying sambar was too sour - but the heavenly coconut and tomato chutneys more than made up for it. Portions were good size (i could have sworn the server said their special for the day was Fish Barramundi, coz i was a little taken aback when i got something as big as a Barracuda), but if you're one of those people with a mind-bogglingly large appetite, then add an appetizer or two and dessert and you should be in good shape.\n\nOverall, the food was above average (note to indians: if you're expecting down-home indian cooking just like your amma makes, you will be disappointed). There's definitely more authentic south indian food to be had, but it involves a drive to the south bay and not-so-fine dining.\nSo if it's a nice evening out you're looking for, Dosa fits the bill well, not to mention the perfectly reasonable prices for the ambience and service.\nWill definitely be going back.", "author": "Miki N."}

There is a wait of epic proportions.  I might as well have brought the latest Harry Potter book, but luckily I had many good friends around to chat-up with.  From my estimates we were waiting a total of 2+ hours to be seated.  That's ridiculous.  Even for a Friday night.\n\nLooking over the menu, I spotted the first page, which contains a fixed-price ($35 at time of this writing) that allows you to choose a soup/salad, mini-dosa, curry, and dessert.  I always like to choose from this menu because it allows for a great variety of sampling at a moderate cost...and it reminds me of Europe.  Unfortunately, after selected all of my dishes, the waitress comes up and tells me that if the majority of our table (of 8) does not order from the fixed-price selection then I cannot either.  This made me actually angry.  If I was alone I would have left right then and there.\n\nSo, hurriedly I selected some other options from the base of the menu.\n\nHere's what I chose:\nOrganic Greens, Mango & Goat's Feta - $9\nRava Masala Dosa - $11\nIce Water - $0 (Thankfully!)\n\nSticker shock?  Yeah...that's a bit high, especially for a dosa.  San Francisco eating ain't cheap.  Dosas in the South Bay can be found easily for $5 or less.\n\nThe salad was decent, but nothing spectacular.  Good balance of flavors and portion size was as expected.  Just nothing stood out on this dish.  You can make this one at home.  Buy one of those goat cheese and walnut salads in the prepackaged salad aisle of the grocery store plus a mango and Whalaaa!\n\nThe dosa was...awesome.  Possibly the best Dosa I've ever had.  Granted, I've never had this type (Rava) of Dosa before.  Maybe that was the factor that swayed me so much.  Also, I think I've had maybe 10-15 dosas in my entire life...so not a huge pool we're sampling from.  Oh, and some were buffet dosas.  Anyways, I'll give Dosa credit to their name.  This was the highlight of my visit.\n\nDosa might be better as a street stand selling delicious dosas - allowing easier access and concentrating on their craft.  I think the only time I will ever return is if I can be assured that the wait time is not more than 1 hour and they allow me to order whatever I want from the menu.

Don't know if egg Dosa work better as dinner or as a kick-ass breakfast entree.\r\n\r\nMethu Vada were excellent and so was the Sambar (the lentil and vegetable soup) accompanying all the dishes.\r\n\r\nWine list is remarkable, but am I going to be drinking a bordeaux or other full body reds with my dosa? probably not. I think Champagne, and other sparkling wine from New Zealand works great with it, just get the bottle, its only $25, and great value for it.\r\n\r\nand the solo entree for desert (ras-malai) which although is common across the board in indian restaurants, was done beautifully. Nice and light and very fragrant heavy cream sauce, the cottage cheese patties themselves were of superior quality than most other indian restaurants.\r\n\r\nI think the place works as a great dinner date spot as well.\r\n\r\nso give it a shot if you have never had South Indian food before.

Great service... very informed and coherent waitstaff that provided us w/ proper ettiquette for eating dosas w/fingers ( not w/ a fork....which I didn't really follow for the entire meal ;)  ) . \n\nBetsy & I made it there around 6pm for dinner. It was quiet and there was a table available immediately by the window. We started w/ the Dahi Vada which was almost too aesthetic to destroy. That's dumplings hidden under a fantastic light organic yogurt w/tamarind and mint. Man... it was awesome.\n\nBetsy got the Spicy Mango Shrimp and I chose the Spring Dosa, which we shared. It was a lot of food for just the two of us. I really wanted to try the Rasam Fire Broth but that'll have to wait 'til next time. \n\nAgain, service was great, although at one point in time I thought it was almost TOO great and TOO attentive but I think that's just because we were having a pretty great discussion.... and so the southern indian cuisine was awesome. Cool Indian music & warm decor... a 5-star no less.\n\nDefinitely a next time! Try it if you haven't already....\n\nP.S. Their website refers you to the parking garage on 21st between Mission & Valencia. I didn't even know there was a parking garage there... which made me happy, of course, because living in the Mission I'll definitely put this to good use.

I do, however, have a lot of experience with restaurants and this is a very good one. I love it when the owners (Emily and Anjan) are on the floor working...you can be sure that quality will be insured and that's always the case here. Its no surprise that Michael Bauer (SF Chronicle) named this one of the 10 best restaurants in the Bay Area.\n\nI've rarely been to Dosa when there wasn't a line at the door. Since I usually come here alone I wind up having dinner at the bar. The wine list is small but well chosen (although I wish there was a full bar). Having eaten here 20 or so times I've had most of what the menu offers and don't recall having been disappointed with anything. They offer two soups, a tomato and a \"fire broth\" and both are actually served hot (a pet peeve of mine is warm soup). Both are flavorful and light. I usually order the Chopped Salad or the Fiery Fruit. I do like spicy.\n\nThere are very few non-vegetarian dishes on the menu so being a non-vegetarian I welcome the Chennai Chicken appetizer. Again, just a bit on the spicy side the portion is large and the chicken, marinated in yogurt before frying, is moist and tender. One of my faves. I've had most of the Dosas but tend toward the Uttapams, an open-face version of Dosas. I love the Tomato/Onion Uttapam and the Chili/Coriander version as well. By the time I've finished all this I rarely have room for desert (although I always hear the siren call of the Valrhona chocolate gelato).\n\nThe prices are very reasonable, the service is excellent, the decor is warm and soothing and inexpensive garage parking is right around the corner.

Delicious and satisfying textures to delight your mouth. Just go there!\n\nFor appetizers, try the idli. They're little dumplings made out of lentil flour and come with sambar, a super flavorful lentil stew with coconut (I think). They also come with two little condiment sauces, one is spicy-tomatoey, and the other one is creamy and coconutty. Seriously delicious. It's the kind of food where you're making little comments like, \"Oh. Yeah! Mmmm. Oh my God, this is so good,\" with every bite, and you start to wonder if people around you will think you're doing a Meg Ryan in \"When Harry Met Sally\" impression.\n\nI had the Spring Dosa, which was a dosa filled with potatoes, peas, carrots, and I can't remember what other stuff, but it was steaming hot, and had such amazing fresh flavor, and was cooked to perfection, with the potatoes done but still firm, peas still bright green and popping gamely in your mouth, really just so lively and fresh and definitely Spring-y. Again served with sambar (fine by me as I can't get enough) and the two condiment sauces.\n\nWe also had the chicken curry, which was really interesting to me and unique in it's denseness of spices and heavy use of chili and cardomom. It kind of reminded me more of an Indonesian curry, but then I'm no expert...I just know it was fabulous!\n\nFor dessert I had the mango kulfi, which was really good, but not all that different from gelato or regular ice cream, or maybe my taste buds were just exhausted from such an exciting meal!\n\nMy first introduction to Indian food was at Pasand in the South Bay when I was 18, and that's what I thought Indian food was for a few years. When I first tasted North Indian food, I was like, \"Wha...?\" I quickly grew to love it for it's own charms, but my true love will always be the Southern (Madras?) cuisine. Even the names of Indian dishes have such a wonderfully whimsical sound. How can you not love something called idli? Or sambar? Or pappadum? Or dosa? Or gulab jamun??? I dare you not to smile as you order your food!\n\nFantastic music, lighting, and decor add to the experience at Dosa.

Mainly because while the food is good and tasty, and the decor very nice, it's overhyped. It's a trendy Mission restaurant in a city that does not have much to offer in good, authentic Indian food.\n\nFor a restaurant that is named dosa, their dosa is average - it was a bit more limp and soggy than I expected it to be. I've had better dosa from a cart in Washington Square Park in downtown Manhattan. And Vik's in Berkeley serves better dosa too. Except that Vik's is not an upscale trendy restaurant.\n\nSome of their other dishes are quite good. Others not as good. The service is fine. The waits can be ridiculous.\n\nWhile my review might seem a tad harsh, it is to be taken only in context of my standards for Indian food. Dosa is one of the best Indian restaurants in the Bay Area for food, decor, atmosphere, and service and I will be back, but I am keeping to my stance that there are no options for good, authentic, regional Indian food in the Bay Area.

After Udupi Palace opened in Berkeley, my wife and I go there more consistently than any other restaurant. We have also had decent dosas at Priya in Berkeley, India Curry House across from Bimbo's 365 in SF, and Saravana Bhavan in Mountain View.\r\n\r\nWe have been intrigued by Dosa since we found out about it here on Yelp and finally got a chance to try it last night. We showed up around 7pm on a Saturday, and surprisingly, it only took around 15 minutes to get a seat. We ordered a Taj Mahal and Pelegrino at the bar while we waited, examining our menu options.\r\n\r\nWe started with the romaine and paneer salad, which was good, except the paneer didn't really add much flavor. Crumbling up and sprinkling our remaining papadum over the salad was actually a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe baseline South Indian dishes for us are the masala dosa and sambar. We were not disappointed by these.  The dosa was nicely done with crispy on the edges, stuffed with delicious potato masala curry. We were not at all impressed by the coconut or tomato chutney. The coconut chutney in particular was comparable to a dull sweet hummus.  Luckily, the complexly spiced sambar provided ample dippage. I would also like to recommend a side of the mango pickle.\r\n\r\nWe also tried the only vegetarian curry, chana bhatura, which is a chick pea curry served with a large bhatura, which is a fried bread similar to poori or even sopapilla (fry bread of the southwest).  The combo is noteworthy. I just wish there were at least one more vegetarian curry to choose from...\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is nice and decor is pretty trendy. Our bill for all of the above was $60 including tip. So, that was pretty expensive, but worth it for the experience.  We will likely try Dosa again, but with a little more self control on the ordering. More than likely, you'll find us at the completely vegetarian Udupi Palace in Berkeley.", "author": "Ron L."}

When I arrived here my excitement almost instantly turned into apprehension. This place was way too swanky for a restaurant aimed at serving what is essentially a breakfast dish or light lunch. I almost felt like more attention was paid to the lighting, fixtures, design, and bar area than anything else in the restaurant.\n\nOnce I saw the menu and its prices I grew even more wary. $10 for a dosa? OK, I'm willing to bite, but this better damn well be a fucking incredible dosa.\n\nWe ordered dahi vadas (little crispy dumpling like things immersed in yogurt and sauces) and onion pocadas. While the taste wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't super authentic or confidence inspiring. The dahi vadas had way too much yogurt in the mixture and the spice/taste was far too reserved. \n\nOnce the dosas cames out (we got the panner cheese filled and 'authentic'  spiced potato varieties) I was impressed with the size. The dosas themselves seemed to be executed well in terms of texture and crispiness. However, taste failed for authenticity on all accounts. The dosa wasn't too bad, but the potato filling was certainly way to tame for me. Seemed 'americanized' to me...maybe I need to try the spicier versions.\n\nOh also, we waited over an hr for what ended up being bar seating...and I don't think they take reservations. The place is pretty small, with maybe 15-25 tables total, and unfortunately most of the space is wasted on the over sized bar.\n\nFor a place that is supposed to specialize on one dish, is this crowded, and is on the higher side for prices, you would expect something really authentic and to have your socks knocked off. My socks are still on...\n\nMaybe I have to give it another try and order something else?", "author": "Varun .."}

Unfortunately, the Chutney Masala Dosa had a filling too thin and slippery to top my list. \n\nI was considering giving the place 4 stars because it's a little pricey, but I think the food and the atmosphere speak for themselves.

This made me eye him curiously throughout the night and I have to say that I liked the way he seemed to stay calm, aware and active- not that I know anything about restaurant management. \n\nDosa is for rare occasions, since the price tops similar formidable taste establishments: Udupi for Indian food or Osha for Thai.

The problem with this place is the intense cognitive dissonance you get if you've ever eaten at a proper dosa restaurant. Stuff like dosas and channa bhatura are Indian street foods. A dosa is normally like $5, if even, and eaten off a tin plate. These guys only get away with charging $10 for a basic dosa or $13 for a channa bhatura because the they're the only game in town, so the food is new to many people.\n\nBasically eating here feels like it would if you went to a pupusa place, and the sommelier recommended a wine for your pupusa. Or if you ate at a place that bills itself as a trendy, sit-down hot dog restaurant. You're sitting in front of food made of chickpeas and potatoes, eating with your hands, smudging your cocktail glass with greasy fingerprints. It just doesn't feel right.\n\nThat being said, I relented on the stars because the food isn't bad. It wasn't spectacular (my bhatura was deflated and a little cool, the dosa was good, but not the best I've had), but again, it's the only place in the area I can get south Indian, and it's pretty good. The food was definitely low on the heat level; ask explicitly if you want it spicy. Indian coffee was okay (it has some nice chicory flavor).\n\nMy experience with the service was very positive. The host and the bartenders were laid back but attentive and quick. The decor was very nice, all flickering candles and warm colors.

There's a lot of South Indian food I love, and thank God for Dosa!\n\nThere's two reasons I love Dosa: 1) it's very San Francisco Mission; it caters to the San Francisco crowd, not the Indian-missing-home-food crowd -- makes a world of difference, seriously. 2) it's South Indian food: the menu's a potpourri of dishes from Chettinad, northern Tamil Nadu, northern Kerala And central/southern Kerala.\n\nIf you're new to South Indian food in general, I suggest you go in a group so you can sample a lot of different food. I highly recommend the Cochin Calamari, Dahi Vada, Heirloom & Idiappam, Mysore Masala Dosa, Rava Masala Dosa and Chennai Chicken (curry). You might want to order some bhatura (puffy wheat bread; it's North Indian) for the curries.\n\nThey do have some North Indian items in the menu, like samosas, baingan bharta, onion pakora, etc., if you care.\n\nEnd with a cup of nice Indian tea (not pre-sweetened!).\n\nI've always had a good experience here. And the wait staff is pretty knowledgeable so don't feel like you'd be lost here. Alternately, if you're having a tough time deciding, get the four-course tasting menu.\n\nBon App\u00e9tit.", "author": "Premshree P."}

The preparation was similar to a calamari salsa, with diced tomatoes, cardamom pods, and the coconut chutney as a dressing. Our dosas were the Indian-equivalent of burritos where the tortlla was replaced with an thin, egg-based pancake and stuffed with the corresponding vegetables. I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb current, but my taste buds were burned out by the time I reached the chicken.

Dosa opened when I lived in the mission years ago and after attempting to go 3 times in the first year it opened (I don't like to wait), I gave up and Dosa dropped down to my B list. Fast forward 7 years, I was searching for a new vegan friendly restaurant and finally tried Dosa. I love going to an omnivore restaurant and having a variety of options besides salads. The paper masala was super fun to eat - the pictures don't do it justice - this is a huge mammer jammer! And I loved the South Indian Moons - The mini uttapams were deliciously chewy with crisp edges. The soy chai was also fantastic. We also tried the potato and mushroom curry with the coconut rice. It was good, and not greasy like Indian curries tend to be, but not as great as the other dishes. The decor and music were both chic and hip - the perfect ambiance for a date. The hubby and I sat in the window and people watched as I became nostalgic for my days living in the mish. After dinner, I didn't feel weighed down like I usually do after Indian food, and the best part was that my hair and clothes didn't smell like the food. \n\nP.S.

The dosa itself was not quite the right combo of crisp and soft.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-02", "description": "Upon arriving at Dosa on a Thursday at 6 pm, we were seated at the bar until the rest of our party arrived.  The bartender casually introduced some of his favorite dishes to us while we waited.  As folks trickled in, our party became complete and we sat down to a half-full restaurant around 6:30.  By the time we ordered, the restaurant was full and pleasantly noisy with spirited conversations around appetizers and entrees.\n\nDosa specializes in southern Indian food, which is a fairly dramatic departure to what most of us are more familiar with.  That being said, there are some recognizable items on the menu -- things that read \"curry\" or \"lamb\" or \"masala\".  However, the stars of the menu are the namesake of the restaurant: the dosa (and its cousin, the uttapam).  Our server was very enthusiastic in explaining just exactly what these were -- the dosa is a thin rice crepe, while the uttapam is a thicker pancake, both of which can be ordered with a variety of fillings or toppings.\n\nBut first, the appetizers.  We started off with the Chennai Chicken (fried boneless organic chicken marinated in organic yogurt with coriander and cumin).  Boneless buffalo wings from India?  Perhaps, but the mild spices were a surprise, which I appreciated since I could actually taste the chicken, which was tender, moist, and flavorful.  We also had the Dahi Vada, which confused us a bit when it arrived at the table.  The bowl of yogurt we saw actually contained the small lentil dumplings underneath the tamarind and mint design along the top surface.  Not only were the lentil dumplings great, but the leftover yogurt went very well with our entrees also.\n\nI am a huge fan of paneer, so I was immediately drawn to the Peas and Paneer Dosa.  My rice crepe came filled with shredded farmer's cheese, peas ,and cilantro.  While the portion size was relatively small, there was just enough food to satisfy me without making me feel bloated -- as I often do at Indian restaurants!  The peas and paneer were also very subtly spiced, allowing all of the main ingredients to shine for themselves.  The dosa and uttapam dishes come with sambar (a lenti dipping soup) and two chutneys (tomato and coconut).  The tomato chutney was a particularly good accompaniment to my peas and paneer lentil.\n\nWe also ordered an uttapam topped with a masala containing potatoes, onions, and cashews.  The uttapam was a more substantial pancake, which made it more integral to the taste and texture of the dish.  If I were to return to this restaurant, I would definitely order the uttapam over the dosa.  Another masala we tried was the Channa Bhatura, which contained garbonzo beans witha choice of  an oversized puffy wheat bread or a vegan poori (fried bread made from whole grain durum wheat).  We assumed that the non-vegan wheat bread would not be fried, since it wasn't mentioned specifically in the menu, but it came to the table glistening with oil.  A bread was definitely required for the masalas, but perhaps a baked option would have been more appreciated here.  Nonetheless, both of these masalas were great dishes with an obvious taste departure from the more commonly known northern Indian cuisine -- I suppose everything simply tasted milder.\n\nTo round things out, we also ordered a more familiar Tamil vegetable curry with cauliflower, green beans, potatoes, and cherry tomatoes over coconut rice.  This dish was unoffensive and rather plain -- it was, once again, very subtle in spicing, but the vegetables by themselves weren't particularly punchy in flavor, leaving a bit of a vacuum of taste with each bite.  The subtlety of spices in the other dishes were to their advantage, but not so well here.  Then again, this vegetable curry isn't terribly adventurous when it comes to southern Indian cuisine, so I'm not surprised that I wasn't terribly impressed by it.\n\nI suppose the lesson here is to understand the motivation for this restaurant.

I have tried to get in there numerous times without a reservation, only to be turned away at 7:00 p.m. with the notion that there are no tables available until 10:00 p.m.  They won't make a reservation if there is table of less than 5, which I consider to be pretty snotty, especially considering they are in the Mission, but sure, whatever.  Go right on, ahead.  \r\n\r\nI tried Dosa last night....finally.  We were sat pretty much in the middle of the restaurant, which was a little too loud for my taste, and my ears were ringing after we left the restaurant.  I got the Masala Dosa, which I thought was really good.  I had a non-spicy chutney that I kept dipping my food into.  The manager also brought us an extra dosa, because he felt that my boyfriend's dosa was a bit too crispy.  Now that is good service.  :) \r\n\r\nI will give Dosa 5 stars for service when you are actually in the restaurant, 4 stars for the food, 3 stars for ambiance, and 2 stars for having to wait for too long and try too many times to get in.  This averages out to about 3.5 stars, but they don't let you do that on Yelp, so I will go 4 stars, because I liked the wine.", "author": "Joanna S."}

I think on our first attempt, we were told that they had no tables at all. No wait time was offered. The second time, we were told an hour. My belly couldn't take the wait. Plus, they wouldn't let us up the number in our group when a couple of friends made an inpromptu decision to join us for dinner. This third time I came prepared. So I wasn't the least bit shocked when they said 45 minutes. The minute that door flies open, the smells from the kitchen are overwhelming. The air is so thick with wonderful aromas that, as hungry as I was, I thought I could taste the air. \n\nWe ordered the lentil patties with yogurt sauce as a starter. I like yogurt but I thought the amount of yogurt on this dish was a bit excessive unless you love you some yogurt. But I found that it overwhelmed the lentil patties, which I would've liked to have tasted more of. When they first put the dish down in front of us, I thought it was dip and didn't get that there were lentil patties hidden underneath. (Sorry, I'm a novice.) For our meal, we ordered the Meysore Masala Dosa (dosa stuffed with potato, served with lentil soup) and the lamb curry. Both were absolutely delicious. Spicy enough to give it just the right amount of kick, but without leaving you sweating like a hog.

As a recent NYC to SF transplant (15 months) I had experienced quite a bit of disappointment when it came to Indian cuisine in San Francisco.  After my third try I decided to give up on it all together, until I came across Dosa's name again when planning out my valentine day dinner and decided to finally go for it.\n\nBecause of my last minute reservation the only table I could get was for a 9:30 seating, much later than I had become accustom to in the city.  My date and I were almost 40 minutes early and our host was happy to seat us right away.\n\nWe both ordered the prefix menu;a 4 course meal with 4 or 5 options to select from at each course. We also went with the wine pairings for the prefix; a generous 1/2 glass of wine with the first three courses.  Between the two of us we were able to enjoy 8 different items and 6 wines.\n\nThe waiter was friendly and warm, personable, and knowledgeable of the food and the ingredients as well as the wines.  The food was a bit hotter in flavor than I was used to for Indian (I was certainly feeling it the next day), but the quality was excellent.  The atmosphere was decent; the wall colors were as spicy as the food, the light fixtures were a bit unattractive (I'm a lighting snob, so I'm a bit harsh).  The seats were comfortable, especially after having all that wine, but I thought it was a little tightly packed (I could follow my neighbors conversations too closely).  \n\nA highlight of the meal was the Dahi Vada, which I thought was one of the most attractive dishes I've ever seen at an Indian restaurant.\n\nDosa was by far the best Indian restaurant that I have come across in San Francisco and I would certainly dine there again.", "author": "Mister G."}

We went on a Friday night without a reservation so we sat at the bar and had a couple glasses of wine each before dinner since there was a 30 min. wait time.  The bartender, Karine, was SO sweet and really knew the wines.  She really took an interest in what we ordered and suggested a bottle that she thought we would like to accompany dinner.  We did order the suggested bottle and loved it.\n\nWe debated whether to order the tasting menu or go ala carte and realized that we could get twice the amount of the same food that was on the tasting menu for the same price or less and get a second meal out of it.\n\nThe coconut and red pepper soup was AMAZING!  I could have made a meal out of that alone.  My partner ordered the fire water soup which was spicy but not overwhelmingly so.  We both got dosas - mine the regular masala dosa and his the mung bean dosa.  The dosas were tasty on their own but the real stars were the accompanying sauces!  They added so much flavor to the light, crispy dosas.\n\nFor entrees we ordered the eggplant dish and the prawn curry.  Both were amazing, although the eggplant dish was SPICY!  My partner ordered the cheese curd dessert which was tasty and just the right serving size to be shared at the end of a (self-imposed) heavy meal.\n\nThe food was done well but lots of places have good food.  What made me give Dosa 5 stars is the service.  From the friendly and attentive bartenders to the gracious hosts to the napkin folding every time we visited the restroom to the fact that my beverage glasses never emptied, this was a real dining experience, not just a meal out.

I know that the space is limited, and they want to accommodate as many wallets- excuse me, I mean \"patrons\" as possible, but there is no room to gesture while talking without smacking someone at the next table.

We made reservations for a Sat. night during Dine About Town. For my four courses I had the Lentil dumplings (Dahi Vada), Spring Dosa, Pepper chicken and Gelato for dessert. I was most disappointed by the Dahi Vada as I didn't realize this dish was served cold. The dumplings are basically served in a bowl under a heap of yogurt. The Pepper chicken also wasn't anything to rave about. There were two pieces of chicken and one of them was a drumstick. It's nearly impossible to eat a drumstick without picking it up, which means there's no \"cute\" way to eat it. The flavor of the chicken was good, but I've had better for a fraction of the price. At the end of the night we walked out with a $90 bill, which is definitely on the high end for what we got.", "author": "Krystal C."}

We got two tasty curries--one shrimp, and one lamb (well marinated/stewed, a little heavy on the cinnamon, but great choice of spices nonetheless).  And the rest was mostly vegetarian.  The chennai chicken was awesome... perfect beer food.  perfectly marinated and stirfried (Read: very moist and flavorful).  The rest of the things we got were variations of pancakes/crepes.  I can't remember what everything was called, but we got two dosas, one eggplant dosa, one spring dosa, both tasty.  ANd we got this paneer and pea in a pancake thing, and this other pancake-like thing.  All of these came with a soup to dip in and two little sauces.  THere was this awesome fried puffy bread called Bhutara I think, that was oily and flaky, kinda like a roti, but more puffy.  It soaked up the leftover curries very well ;)\n\nThe highlights of the evening, I think, were actually the chennai chicken, and the lentil dumplings (I think they were called vada sambar).  The \"dumplings\" were amazing--the dish was like a shallow soup of yogurt, and the balance of textures, and flavors was simply amazing.  the lentil \"dumplings\" were basically a loose chewy cake of lentils, and were drenched in a chilled sauce of yogurt and some other stuff.  For presentation, the chef made concentric rings of brown and white, and then dashed them radially towards the center to make a beautiful floral pattern.  Outstanding.\n\nThe food was awesome.  5 stars.\n\nBut... the place itself was extremely loud--they need some soundproofing.  we were right in the middle of the room, by the wall, and only a table of 8 yelpers.

For a split second, I did wonder if they would be serving bacon and eggs or even pancakes?  Ok, just kidding about the bacon!\n\nIn fact, they did have Indian versions of the traditional omelets, pancakes, and crepes.  I had the South India Omelet which was more of a frittata.  The eggs were well cooked; fluffy, but not runny.  Unexpected was the spicy \"kick\" from the chilies.   My friends tried the Sunny Side Uttapam, which I would compare it to having eggs and pancakes, and the Egg Poriyal Dosa, a crepe in disguise.  Of course, each dish came with sides of  tomato chutney, coconut chutney, and sambar.  All seemed to match well with our dishes.\n\nIn the end, I think we all agreed that the OMELET was the BEST, with the uttapam a close second.  The dosa was good, but seemed much more plain when compared to the others.\n\nBefore we get to the STAR rating, one thing of importance to note, weekend brunch doesn't start until 11:30am.

Great service, not rehearsed \"niceness\".\n\nMy friend and I sat and the bar and proceeded and stay there for the meal itself. The bartender without hesitation recommended the Cabernet Franc. Great choice (although I know crap about wine).\n\nFor starters we ordered an Idli Vada Sambar. To be honest, I don't know which one was which but one was pleasing while the other was rather bland. The both were served in a broth concoction and either the idli or vada ended up being too mushy as a result.\n\nNext, we ordered the Masala Dosa which lived up to the restaurant's namesake. Perfectly crisp, light, and perfect amount of filling (as if I really knew what the hell a dosa is supposed to taste like),\n\nWe shared a main of lamb curry and this is the justification for only 3 stars. This is the one dish my friend insisted we order due to her past \nDosa outing. Although done well, there was nothing to justify my friend's enthusiastic recommendation. It only tasted like lamb curry with a bit of spice. That's all. \n\nDessert was Gulab Jamoon, eaten solely by me. My only reason for ordering these was to compare them to their ubiquitous Indian buffet cousins. Ehh, a little better but not my much. However, our server comped these b/c they were the bottom of the barrel...literally. We ate late and these were all that were left at the end of the night.

I think we got there just before the rush because just after we sat down the place started to fill up and get REALLY loud (minus half a star because I couldn't hear my own voice and came out of the restaurant horse after dinner).\n\nI had a masala dosa and a mango lassi, which are two things I have ALL the time.  I figured that if the place couldn't make their most basic things decent, it wouldn't be worth me coming back.\n\nThe mango lassi was a bit too thick for my taste, but otherwise flavorful. Check.\n\nThe dosa was tasty!  Just enough spice, just enough potato, just enough sambar.  Check.  \n\nMinus a quarter of a star for WAY too much grease on my fingers after my meal (I don't even have that much after eating at a mom-and-pop Indo place) and minus another quarter of a star for a very bland sambar.  \n\nThe rus-malai was yummy, but again, a little on the thick side.\n\nThe owner was nice enough to come and introduce himself to us and ask us how the food was.  I think it was cause we were one of  the only brown people in that joint (not uncommon in San Francisco) and he maybe thought he'd get an honest opinion of the food (or maybe he asks everyone, who knows?).  I told him I didn't expect much and that I was pleasantly surprised, especially because I heard so much about Dosa.  \n\nService was great.  Water always got refilled.  Orders didn't get messed up.

It's probably safe to say that most expat Brits accross the globe contest to being big curry fans - the food is pretty much a staple dish back home. That said, finding a good spot in the city has been challenging which is why after hearing about it's many awards and accoloades Dosa was high on our list of new places to try in SF. \n\nDosa did not dissapoint. Far from it. This is without a doubt one of the best places you can go for an Indian, especially if you are vegetarian and more so if you like authentic cuisine and not the heavy, creamy, over seasoned mixes you often get served at most joints. The mini popadoms didn't need sauces they were so flavorsome and the Spicy Mung Masala was tasty enough to satisfy any carnivores who say vegetable treats are bland and boring. Also highly recommended is the Channa Bhatura - the dishes are prepared with virtually no wheat and natural ingredients meaning you can eat lots and don't come away feeling stuffed and bloated. All in all awesome food for a very reasonable amount - great for dates, small groups of friends and even solo trips as the bar is lively and inviting.

Dosas and uttapams were good...meat dishes not so much. And I LOVE meat. And I almost didn't come here because of such a limited meat menu. Sigh. So take my advice and stick with the vegetarian dishes and you'll be happy.\n\n***UPDATE***\nAbout 5 minutes after posting this, I received a message thru Yelp from the owner apologizing for the service.

Most Indian places in town are N. Indian and Pakistani and are either way overpriced or kind of divey. Either could work depending on your tastes, but Dosa brings something wholly different to the party. Since it serves S. Indian, Dosa's regional specialty is also its namesake: flat, spongy rice pancakes of bread that conceal a collage of spices, flavors and ingredients (reminiscent of Ethiopian food in its composition and textures, if not its flavors). The spicy mung masala dosa is fantastic (green chiles, spicy potatoes and lentils), as are the somosas and the peppercorn chicken (comes in a thick sauce that mixes heavenly with a side of rice).\n\nWhat you won't find here are the tika masalas, naans and tandoori dishes served by about 90% of all Indian restaurants in town. \n\nFinally, while I didn't have dessert, an after dinner spiced Indian coffee was without question the best coffee drink I've ever had. \n\nThe wine list is substantial and the servers are skilled at recommending wines. Personally, I like white when eating spicy foods, and the Greek Assyrtiko we chose was fantastic. \n\nThe restaurant itself is a stylish and modern foodie paradise, painted in warm earth tones and decorated all over with technicolored paintings in Indian motifs. The service is prompt, although I felt like they were rushing us a little and going for turnover (at 6:45 on a Friday, the place was already filled up).

Not really - and halfway through the meal, the Dosa lost its warmth so it was kinda soggy in the middle.\n\nOther dishes we had included:\n- Idli Sambar -- great starter, idli itself was a bit tough but the dish was good on a rainy SF evening\n- Kerala chicken -- this was pretty awesome, including the coconut rice. I'd probably get this again.\n\nSo yeah, 3 stars. The waiter we had was really nice and was attentive with the water.\n\nBehind us was an Asian couple with a girl who talked really loud. The guy was trying to be tough and ordered the spicy masala dosa. The waiter warned him that it was really spicy, but he went ahead and got it, but then had to ask for yogurt to cool it down. So much for impressing the girl. So for all the guys out there -- don't try an Indian restaurant for a date. You might embarrass yourself with spicy food.", "author": "Reid Y."}

For one dish is about $16 and all it is is mashed up beans, potatoes, and flour to make the bread. There is hardly any parking on the street and you have to pay for parking at a garage nearby.

Please understand, I'm not trying to be an authenticity douchebag.  It's just that I used the mother cuisine filter on yelp (oh wait - yelp - you don't have that? please implement! i'd prefer advice on indian restaurants from a Venkat than from a Victor) and that told me what I needed to know - I still see no reason to pay your prices for food that gets it about 80% right when I can do better in at UP down the road, or in freaking Cleveland.\n\nThe rundown:\n\n1. Mung Salad - nine dollars.  nine dollars? for that?  about 2/3 a cup of mung sprouts that tasted pretty much only of lemon despite the advertised spices.  Concept has lots of potential.\n2. Rasam - good.  You got one of the basics right.\n3. Chile cilantro Uttapam.  Weak sauce.  Weak freaking sauce.  No evidence of chile or cilantro.  Didn't hold up very well to being eaten by hand, which is why you play the game in the first place.  And are you guys pureeing some portion of the sambhar before it comes out to make it pass for soup? Sambhar is not supposed to have a uniform mouth feel guys. Uttapam was the low point and the sambhar was the low point of the low point.\n\n\n4. Dahi Rice w / Achaar.  The space above is to indicate that I waited about 1/2 hr. after the uttapam for the dahi rice to show up.  I'm glad your kitchen knows the appropriate order of things (yogurt rice always last) but I don't recall asking for extra time after the uttapam to smoke a cigarette, use the restroom, and order tamarind rice from UP while I waited.\n\nBy the way, if you're going to be a south indian restaurant, how bout using a south indian word for yogurt instead of the Hindi.  Ok, now I am being an authenticity douchebag. \n\nService was fine, and I thought your staff did a respectable job of shepherding newbies through the menu.  But please inform them that Shrikhand is not just \"sweet yogurt.\"  Gogurt is sweet yogurt.  Shrikhand and gogurt are completely different things.  Therefore Shrikhand must not be sweet yogurt, right?\n\nEDIT\n .\nI see dedicated pain in the ass Anjan M. has decided to comment on my review.  \n\nHere's an idea: why don't you convene your legendary 14 south indians to find some recipes that actually celebrate the gastronomic diversity of the south?\n\nNo?\n\nYou're still going to serve up the same old pablum?\n\nAnd you're still the same condescending bore you were yesterday?\n\nOK.", "author": "Srikanth S."}

One of my friends who lives just a block away from Dosa highly recommended this place many many times.  My boyfriend who seems to live in the floating dog house ever since we started dating happens to LOVE Indian food.  The odd thing is that we never had Indian food together.  Anyway, I decided that it is time for us to give Dosa a try since my BF loves Indian food and my friend is so crazy about this place.\n\nSince Dosa does not accept reservations, we decided to arrive at the restaurant early.  We arrived at about 6:00pm on Saturday evening.  It took us 1 hour and 30 minutes to get a table!!!    Luckily we secured a spot on the corner of the bar so we could at least had our appetizer first.  The calamari salad was delicious!  The calamari was so tender and full of flavors with different spices.  The lychee cocktail was not as good as what I had expected.  The lassis cocktail was so tasty that I drank 2 glasses before we were seated.  We ordered lamb curry, chicken curry and a plain crepe.  The crepe was paper thin and was great to dip with our curry dishes.  The curry dishes were spicy but not too hot.  The chicken was juicy and tender.  I love the fact that they put both the breast meat and thigh in the dish.  I am the dark meat eater!\n\nMy conclusion is that people go to Dosa because they are food lovers.    That's why most people are willing to wait for hours for a table.  Will I come back to Dosa again?  I will under one condition: Next time I am gathering 6-8 people so we can get a reservation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-03-15", "description": "Don't underestimate how hard it is to get a table at Dosa: Four of us tried to walk in and eat here a couple of weeks ago, and gave up. Trying to work within the system, we gathered up 2 more friends -- Dosa takes reservations for groups of 5 or more -- and emailed early the next week to get a table. After 3 days without a response, I called and left voicemail. A very sweet woman called me back and apologized for the problem, and found us a table at the time we wanted. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, my expectations ran pretty high after all of this rigamarole. Largely, I think they were met. The food is interesting, tasty, flavorful without being incendiary, and thoughtfully presented. Service was crisp but a little stand-offish, and our server was very helful when it came time to figure out what (and how much) to order -- once we asked. \r\n\r\nI was really pleased with how reasonable the prices were. For less than $45 per person, including tax and tip, we had 2 bottles of wine and a handful of beers, plus a ton of food. Our order included a refreshing chickpea salad, a pair of appetizers -- crispy-spicy potato croquets and lush lentil dumplings -- three dosai (paneer, egg, and rava masala), and two of the curries: a deeply spiced Tamil lamb, and a prawn coconut masala... oh, and a giant bathura. Each dosa came with its own bowl of sambar, plus two smooth chutneys: a gingery coconut one and a spicy tomato version. Needless to say, we didn't have room for dessert, although I was tempted by the cardamom ice cream.\r\n\r\nOn the downside: The tables are awfully close together, the noise level is out of hand, the decor is warm but a tad bit stark -- some art on the walls would help. Worst of all, the hordes of drooling, hovering patrons (staring daggers while you try to enjoy dinner) is really, really annoying. The hosts were letting people hang out in the dining area, not just the bar, and I found that extremely inappropriate.\r\n\r\nIf I could make a reservation for a party of 2 or 4, or better yet, walk in on a weeknight with a reasonable expectation of a table becoming available within the space of a leisurely cocktail, I'd become a regular. But given the hassle factor, I can't imagine it being more than an occasional thing. I hope that once things calm down a bit, the owners might consider opening at least a few tables to reservations, while leaving the majority open for walk-ins.", "author": "anita c."}

As a South Indian, born in Mysore, I know first-hand how good a Mysore masala dosa, made in Mysore, tastes, BUT, DOSA does a pretty good job of creating a wonderful space to introduce some pretty delicious entrees.\n\nThe restaurant:  Love the design.  For a small venue, they've done a great job of making the atmosphere inviting and warm.  I think the earthy paint color is gorgeous.\n\nThe staff:  Very friendly and attentive.\n\nThe food:  Looks like art.  It's not one of those restaurants where presentation outshines palatability, the food in DOSA actually looks and tastes good.  I would recommend the South Indian Moons uttapam or the rava dosa, both are fantastic.\n\nWait:  I think for dinner it's harder to find a table.  For lunch it's great.

The food here is as beautiful as it is delicious, although you'll enjoy it lots more if you have a decent tolerance for spice.\n\nThe chutneys are amazing across the board, although the habanero-mango one is pretty lethal (yet somehow still tastes great). The sambar that comes with each dosa is flavorful and fresh, as are the dosas themselves; I've never had anything bland or boring-tasting here. There's always a number of vegetarian options, although if you're vegan or lactose-intolerant, watch out for cheese or cream in many of them. The servers are generally fabulous and happy to offer (good) advice if you're unsure what to get. The restaurant is lovely, if smallish, and with the high ceilings, it does get noisy and a tad claustrophobic when it's full. So it's probably better suited for groups of 4 or fewer - if you bring your entire extended family, you won't be able to hear anyone.

It was really tasty and I like when calamari is grilled, not fried.  They also shared Onion Pakora, which I didn't try because I don't like onions.\n\nFor entrees, I had a South Indian Moon Uttapam.  Uttapam is basically like your naan, but more sophisticated.  I loved mine.  I love anything that's naan-like, and my dish came with uttapam of different flavors.  I wasn't sure if the two rather large bowls on the plate were dipping sauce or meant to be eaten as independent dishes.  For dipping sauce, there is far too much of it for the 5 pieces of uttapam you get.  And as an independent dish, I just couldn't take it as a wussy for spicy food.  I tried to spoon it into my mouth, but my eyes-watering, coughing reaction was way too embarrassing to share with even close friends. \n\nThe Indian friend had the same dish as I did, which gave me even more confidence in my choice. The two guys had dosa.  If you like thin, crispy dough, I suggest dosa.  Different style, equally tasty. \n\nThe portion isn't large.  But I have developed a new philosophy in 2008 on restaurants: I think it's better to leave a little hungry and wanting more than to go home feeling stuffed and uncomfortable. \n\nAnd it was surprisingly easy to get a table on a Friday night despite the location and popularity of the place.

You have to understand that I'm so totally over crepes as creative cuisine - everyone's been there and done that (plus pesto and artichokes), but THESE are crepes I can still respect.  Mmm...you tasty little thin crepes filled with gooey, spiced goodness.  You're so delicious...yes, you are!  Yes, you are!\n\nOne dosa's a great portion-size for me - huge but fairly thin, and it comes with the best sambar I've ever had.  I LOVE LENTILS.  Very odd quirk of mine, but it's true.  And I could slurp the sambar here for daaays.\n\nAs for other food, I've tasted a really wonderfully-spiced veggie curry here, and probably the only near-miss for me has been the rack of lamb curry (nice with the lemon rice but nothing to write home about since the lamb was a little too tough).  Service is great and personal, especially for such a cramped, crowded space.  Great place to enjoy good food and pretend to be cool.", "author": "Christina H."}

I went with the boy, who is South Indian (Bangalore what!) and he was excited to see other Indians waiting for tables with us. But we were both surprised that when the food came he was underwhelmed (I thought it was pretty tasty, but I've never had dosas before, so I'm a horrible judge) We were also weirded out to see that nobody working there had a hint of Indian descent, which I think made the boy feel even weirder about the food.\n\nThe ambiance of this place is awesome though, and sitting at the bar was fun.

Although I'm not behind this 'no reservations' policy (look, man, I can plan where I'm going to be and what time, even if other people can't) I do think the staff do everything possible to make the process as painless as possible.  The bartender looked like he was scanning for snipers, he was so on top of everyone's drink needs.  People would just turn towards the bar, and he'd have a drinks menu in their hand!  If you got low on a glass, he'd ask you if you wanted more.  None of that 'excuse me, bartender' nonsense you get from 'hip' places.  (NB. When did it become 'hip' to be rude?)\n\nSo having finally gotten our seats, (and yes, we're so close to everyone, I can hear the guy at the next table explaining to his date why he and his Dad don't see each other much, even though his Dad lives 10 miles away), we made the critical mistake of not ordering our food when the waitress took our drinks order.  Apparently, this is a major faux pas at Dosa, for which we were punished by her taking the order of four other tables, ignoring our efforts to gain eye contact, to reel her back in.  She never forgave us for that indiscretion either, I would note.\n\nSo we do order. The drinks arrived.  The drinks are spilled.  This happens.  The server was very nice about it, offered to pay for cleaning (red wine, light colored shirt) but hey, that does happen, the shirt is a few years old, don't worry about it, and we were comped for our drinks.  Nothing beyond what I would have expected, but nothing less either.\n\nWithin minutes (less than 5, mind you) of ordering, the lentil doughnut as my husband calls it (Vada Sambar to the rest of us) arrives at the table.  Yummy, hearty, better suited for a colder day (my mistake, not theirs) but delicious.  We also ordered the Masala Dosa, which was very tasty, and the South Indian Moons.  This one is a little sample plate of each of the different types of Uttapam (the chile and corriander was the best) and this dish was the bomb.  Fantastic channa dal to go with it, spicy, but tasty.  Ummm, so yummy.\n\nSo overall, four stars.  Really terrific service (even with the red wine spilage), fantastic food, well chosen beverage list to accompany the food.

The neighborhood is slowly being referred to as \"The Gourmet Ghetto\" (the original Gourmet Ghetto is in Berkeley, CA), because of the surge of notable restaurants that have settled in the past few years; Bar Tartine, Tartine Bakery, Balompie Caf\u00e9, Delfina, Foreign Cinema, and Bi-Rite Creamery are just some of the restaurants I'm interested in.  I've already eaten at Range (see my blog entitled \"Not so free Range\"), Papalote, and Caf\u00e9 Gratitude (blog entries in the works).  \n\nWalking distance from my new apartment is Dosa, a south Indian restaurant that was recommended by at least half a dozen locals.  But when making plans to eat at Dosa, I was warned of the long wait for a table on any given night from the moment doors open.  Luckily, dining alone at 5:30pm on a Monday night is a surefire guarantee for a seat at the bar.  I'm not a huge fan of dining alone, but a good bartender can usually enhance the experience for single diners and offer some good conversation.  Planning to eat a lot of spice, I selected a glass of crisp Gr\u00fcner Veltliner to round out the heat.\n\nAs one would expect with the name, dosa's make up a major part of the menu.  Typical South Indian fare, dosa's are thin, crispy cr\u00eapes made of rice and lentil batter and stuffed with various fillings.  My favorite is the traditional Masala dosa, filled with curried potatoes, fried onions and occasionally peas.  I opted to try something new and ordered an Uttapam, a slightly thicker version of a dosa, mixed with green chilies, onions and fresh cilantro.  The accompanying sauces and chutneys make the experience delightful because you can diversify each bite with spoonfuls of fresh coconut chutney, tomato chutney and sambar.  \n\nIndian desserts are a far cry from Western desserts.  Ras Malai - a Pakistani and Indian dessert made of patties of paneer, a mild farmers cheese, which have been soaked in sweet cream and flavored with rosewater and crushed pistachios - was a refreshing and elating end to a light and flavorful meal.

A little bit different than what I used to, but I guess it was their specialty.\n\nThe customer service was good and I absolutely recommend to make a reservation to come to this place. We had one and we still had to wait quite a bit. \n\nThough I had a pleasant experience, I doubt that I will go back. There are many other cheaper good Indian restaurants.", "author": "Perry S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-05", "description": "I've been obsessed with dosas lately, so it just seemed natural to gravitate towards this place. I went on a Sunday afternoon and expected to wait in line, which is what I always see at dinner time outside this place, but was pleasantly suprised by being able to walk right in and take a seat.\n\nI ordered a Masala Dosa, which was amazing. I have been eating at several different restaurants that serve dosas, and the filling was by far the best I've had. The potato filling was heavily scented with aromatic spice and had been mashed to delectable moist perfection. It was, however, much smaller than I am used to and came with a pitifully small amount of coconut and tomato chutneys, especially for the price. The sambar was flavorful, but watery and lacked the addition of any vegetables. \n \nI probably would have left feeling satisfied, but a little cheated, except that the staff was apparently just not busy enough and decided that meant being aggressively over-helpful. I understand good service, but if I'm not engaging the staff in conversation, they usually get it that I want to eat in peace. \n\nThe host that seated me might as well have just sat down at my table the entire time critiquing how I ate. He actually did make himself comfortable in the seat across from me when my food arrived.\n\nApparently he thought I need to be schooled in Indian food because I asked my list of questions at every new restaurant I go to about the ingredients of the food I'm interested in ordering. I have allergies to wheat, gluten, and eggs so have to be cautious that way. First he over explained what a dosa is, then he actually sat down at my table when my food arrived and started telling me what the \"correct\" procedure was for eating my dosa! \n\nApparently he made my actual waiter nervous, because after that it was impossible to get the waiter's attention for things like water. I really didn't want to interact with the host after that, but he was the one who kept noticing me looking for the waiter and getting me things.\n\nMy taste buds where happy and my belly full when I left, but this place made me feel cheap and anti-social.  I like to get more for what I pay and I like to feel relaxed rather than harrassed during my meal.\n\nThe 4 stars are for decent food,minus non-relaxing atmosphere.", "author": "Wendy B."}

Minutes later the place was packed.  Nice crowd.  Good vibe.  Typical mission.\n\nI started my meal off on a high note.  Mung sprouts.   Actually a spicey lentil salad.  Very nice.  Complex flavors.  My tongue used taste buds not exercised for decades.  A slow heat that builds slowly but doesn't overwhelm the food.  Why aren't lentils (and barley for that matter, but barley is another story) used more often?\n\nNext, chennal chicken. It's described as fried marinated chicken.  It comes to the table and is tempura like, but more spicey.  In fact in this plate of food, the oil the small pieces of bird were fried in and the spices overwhelm the meat.  The plate tastes of everything but chicken.  \n\nI finish with moons uttapam.  Five different discs of carbohydrate. Supposedly differentiated from one another by various toppings.  My aged taste buds cannot distinguish one from the other.  Dip each into a somewhat spicey sauce, cool it off with another sauce, and you know what?  Its still nothing more than a pancake with some stuff in or on it.  \n\nWell, each to his own.  I had a nice time.  Southern Indian is OK for me but nothing more.  Food being such a subjective thing, well, try for yourself.  Even if you only like it as well as I did, you may also learn something.  I did.

The hour-long wait made me so hungry that I'm pretty sure anything would have tasted delicious at that point - but Dosa was still a delight. \n\nMy 2 peeps and I shared an awful lot of food - dahi vada, idli vada sambhar, paper masala dosa, mysore masala dosa, paneer peas dosa, mango lassi, madras coffee, and almond pistachio kulfi. Everything was very good and very authentic. The dahi vada was served in such an aesthetically pleasing manner that I hardly had the heart to dig into it. (But I did. And it was awesome). The accompanying sambar and chutnies tasted like they were homemade. I would say the only less-than-perfect item was the filter coffee - the taste of chicory was a bit strong, and it had no foam on top (which means it wasn't made quite the right way). \n\nI live almost exactly midway between Dosa and the south Indian places down in the south bay (Saravana Bhavan, Madras Cafe) - but if I'd like to have my food in a classier setting, I'm so heading north.", "author": "Abha R."}

(would have been 25 min or a table). About 20 min later, the line was out the door. Keep the long lines in mind when thinking about going here.\n\nEach of us had the tasting menu. We started with the marinated calamari, which wasn't great, a bit bland and marinated, not fried. The Dahi Vada was very hefty and filling, and heavily sauced, I liked it, she not so much.\n\nWe then had mini-Dosas, the Chatni Masal Dosa and the spicy Mung Masala. Honestly, we could not tell the difference between the two, but they were good, particularly with the chutneys.\n\nWe moved on to the curry. We had the Baingan Bharta and the lamb. both were great.\n\nby this time we were stuffed, we had gone from famished to stuffed very quickly.\n\nBut there was still dessert...We had the mango Kulfi (tastes like a frozen mango lassi) and coconut sorbet.

I would say overall, this place is pretty good and I liked all the dishes, but just didn't find anything outstanding.  \n\nWith a small group of friends (4), we ordered take out for a little dinner and movie at our friends' place.  I was impressed at the timing (20-25min.) for a Sun. night, and a really nice hostess taking our order as well as welcoming you into the restaurant (thank you Jessica).. 4-5 stars for take out service (This is the closest I've ever been to giving out a perfect score)\n\nAs for the food, I guess I just love my meats and there's not many of those options in a south indian cuisine.  We tried their paneer and masala dosas (what they're known for),a chicken curry and lentil dumplings.  The dumplings look like fried doughnuts and are mediocre but I liked everything else.  I agree with their recommendation that putting both sauces on the dosas increases the taste palette and I should also warn against those non-spice lovers that at a minimum, most of the food (esp. the curry) has at least a little kick to it.  \n\nThat being said, we only spent $15 a pop but I guess in the end, a place has to meet expectations.  I suppose I'm not being really fair since it is a lot better than most, but when you're consider one of the top indian restaurants in the city, I expect to be somewhat delirious with delight at the end of a good meal.\n\nUpdate (9/4/07): +1 star for one of the owners sending me a personal e-mail to discuss other options that I might enjoy besides the one I tried in the statements above.

It was suuuper packed... so much so that we overheard an angry man in front of say that he waited over 30 minutes for his table and he had a reservation! We only waited 15 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. So, I guess this is a warning to all that reservations are more than recommended if you want to eat here on a busy weekend night!\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nCochin Calamari --- really tender calamari rings in a curry sauce with a side of greens.\nPaneer and Peas Dosa --- looked like a cheese and peas burrito!\nTamil Lamb Curry with Coconut Rice --- exactly what the name says.\n\nI think the best parts of the meal were the calamari appetizer because the calamari was tender and the sauce was delicious! And also the coconut rice because it was light and had a hint of coconut that went really well with the spice of the curry. The dosa itself was just ok. I don't know if there was supposed to be a really spicy chili pepper in it because I ate it and my mouth/throat/stomach lining was on FIRE for at least 10 minutes. I even teared up a bit which really scared my bf. Ha! The lamb curry was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nGiven all the hype (and the ridiculous wait) for this place, we were sadly underwhelmed. I would return to try other dishes on the menu, but I'd rather try something else.", "author": "Cecilia W."}

The chennai chicken was tender for being fried and the yogurt sauce was a good complement to the dish.  The dahi vada was pretty but it was covered in sauce that was very rich.

OK.  Oh first we find out that the corkage fee is $20, a little pricey but whatever.  Anyway, back to my story.  So we tell the waitress and she looks very pained and says \"oh sorry we can't split tasting menus\".  Uh, what does that mean?  Two of us are ordering off the tasting menu and one isn't, we aren't splitting?  Waitress: \"oh actually in most SF restaurants including ours, we like to time the dishes so we can't have two of you order the tasting menu and one not\".  Uh, again, what???  Its a timing thing?  How elitist and fabulous do you think you are?  btw, loved my friend's comment \"yeah I understand that at a fine dining establishment, but, uh, okay give us a minute\".  So we either had to promise that our third friend wouldn't order anything else and not eat off our dishes and we could order the tasting menus (that was ok for some ridiculous reason, btw, you are losing money by her not ordering but whatever) or the two of us couldn't order off the tasting menu.  (again, you are losing 70 bucks (tasting menu is 35 dollars) which doesn't make any freaking sense to me if you are trying to make money, aren't you a business?).  So, guess what, we left.

I thought maybe I should visit again, but then I realized that I have way too many restaurants left on my list to hit up before I leave SF...and that I am, in fact, narcissistic enough to think that my review might serve some use in this Yelp world. So here you go:\n\n\"Congratulations, Dosa! You have just made it into the Overrated Club!\" I wanted so much to like Dosa - hip Mission locale, cool decor, vibrant energy, courteous and down-to-earth service (both while waiting for our table for four and during the meal). However, there was a lot of the experience that just seemed a little bit \"off.\" Our server was very enthusiastic about telling us his favorites within each section of the *overwhelmingly* large menu. Since he seemed so friendly and we were so indecisive, my friend and I got into our \"assault the waiter with questions\" mode. He handled it well, but when we asked what the difference between fresh corriander and cilantro was, he seemed flustered and was unable to find an answer for us. I think that we scared him because after that we never saw him again. The service thereafter was moderately good, though it took some effort to flag down more water.\n\nOh well, it's probably best because some of his suggestions were real disappointments, and I am a terrible liar. Our starter, the Dahi Vada (lentil dumplings topped with yogurt, tamarind, and mint) sounded intriguing and unique to Dosa. Unfortunately, the presentation and the texture of the dish elicited a unanimous verdict, \"It's like 7 layer bean dip.\" Not appetizing unless it is Super Bowl Sunday. For our entrees, I had the Chatni Masala dosa, which we all agreed was the best pick of the table; it would have been nice though if the waiter had confirmed whether it would be made with the eggplant or the ridge gourd. The dosa was very large (~12 inches across), with an ample serving of a creamy baby eggplant chutney spread encased in a wonderfully crisp crepe. The other entrees included the Channa Bhatura (a flat-tasting chick pea masala served with an awesome puffy wheat bread), some vegetable curry that was so inspirational and muddled in flavor that I can't remember anything else worth mentioning, and the South Indian Moons. The South Indian Moons (chef's choice of five uttapams - aka open faced dosas), in particular, sounded too good to be true - and it was. It's a classic case of sacrificing quality for quantity - the half-dollar sized uttapams were all dry and none of their toppings was able to stand out (I enjoyed the paneer & peas most, probably because I am a cheesehound like that).\n\nDespite how terribly loud it was, we were able to carry on a lively discussion about NYC vs. Bay Area lifestyle and dining (p.s. I'm always up for this conversation...). While the food was not offensive, the overall experience was unimpressive, especially given the attention and high praise Dosa has received.\n\n3.5 stars for ambiance + 3.5 stars for service + 3 stars for food  = an induction into the Bay Area Chapter of the Overrated Club.", "author": "Steph P."}

We were told that the kitchen had closed so we weren't going to be able to order.  Fine.  But then when we tried to order drinks (beers, etc.), we were told that the kitchen was closed and so was the bar. !!  It was only just after 10pm (closing time) and I just couldn't believe that the bar would shut down that quickly. My friend went next door and bought some beers from a convenience store and brought them into the restaurant for us.  Meanwhile, one of the guys in the group who had arrived earlier and was eating also tried to order another beer and was given the \"we're closed\" line.  He went up to the bar and made a big stink about it and a few minutes later, the manager came over and apologized to him saying that there was a miscommunication and that he could indeed order another beer.  The server who'd been so incredibly rude to us and had told us we could *not* order drinks also came by to apologize *to that guy but not to us on the other side of the table.* To add insult to injury, she came around to our side of the table and asked someone else BUT NOT US if she wanted another drink. Talk about a slap in the face.  First tell us we can't have food. Okay. But then tell us we can't have drinks. Then tell us we *can* have drinks but don't even offer us any. After the completely uppity way they treated us, I wouldn't have bought a drink from them anyway, but still. It's hard to believe that the proprietors would have so little sense of customer service that they would 1) turn away the chance to make high margin $ on alcohol, and 2) not try harder to mend the bad feelings caused by the \"miscommunication\" among their staff in the hopes of getting repeat customers in the future.

I don't do well with rules... \n\nI busted in here last Tuesday night all pissed off because I was having a hard time parking my car for the first time since moving to the Mission, and my friend and I were trying to squeeze a hurried dinner into planned-out nights, and said friend was calling me asking me over and over where was this place? He was standing on the corner of 22nd and Valencia! And I was calling him back repeatedly while trying to find a parking spot, and park, and walk, downhill, with my big work bag, and my computer bag... \"It's not right ON the corner. It's ON Valencia.\" And then he's calling me back saying he doesn't see it... \"Well walk farther down then. It might be closer to 21st.\" And then -- THE HORROR! I see it. And it's actually between 20TH AND 21ST. And I have to call him back AGAIN. Only I can't get through because he's calling me at exactly the same time to tell ME where it is... And I'm like, \"I KNOW where it is. I'm committing this cell-phone-suicide FOR YOU.\" And by the time I get in he's having a chai at the bar and I drop all my bags on the ground and he's like, to the maitre'd, \"Can we get a table now? (Aside to me) They wouldn't seat me without you...\" And scary maitre'd is like, \"Actually, why don't you settle with the bartender first...\" And we're like, um, oookay... And he was really kinda snotty. But whatever, we really just want to sit down. And HOLY SHIT was it hot in there. Like, I know you're a \"Southern Indian\" place, and you're very proud of the fact that your food is DISTINCTLY southern Indian and not northern, but your CLIMATE doen't need to be... And we finally get our table, and then we realize we know NOTHING about said cuisine of southern India. So we ask the waitress for help. And she's like, WAY INTENSE. She's like, there every second. Are we ready yet? Do we want dosas or uttapams? Why don't we get one curry, and one dosa, and share everything? Okay, well, WHY DON'T WE MAKE UP OUR OWN MINDS? But whatever, she was trying to be helpful, and she was, for the most part... And then the food comes. And it's good. I mean, really good.

But of course we can't finish it. And oh good Lord, we have to ask for to-go containers. So some mystery man comes out from the kitchen, and I don't know what happens. It's like that carni act, where the guy puts a quarter under a card and then shuffles it around on a table with other cards and makes you guess which one the quarter is under... DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH OUR FOOD? Just put it all in boxes and give it all back to us! Lord! Then evil maitre'd man comes back with our check, because once again, he REALLY wants us to settle up, because by now the place is PACKED. Packed, I tell you! On a Tuesday at 7:30.

My companion also noted that with the tasting menu, you don't have to negotiate several plates of large overhanging dosas at a smal table. \n\nI had the uber-fresh mung bean salad starter, and the reduced-serving portions of paneer dosa and lamb curry.

I had never had dosas, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I do recognize delicious. Dosas are large South Indian crepes made from rice flour and fermented lentil flour batter. Fillings are customarily vegetarian and include potatoes, vegetables, and chiles. We started our meal with a lentil tomato soup that was light and spicy enough to ward off colds for the rest of the season. The paneer cesar salad was also perfect--the cheese not too fried and the dressing not overpowering. The boyfriend loved the fresh-tasting cucumber salad. Then the dosas! We had a lacey Rava dosa with blended potato and cashew nut filling as well as a traditional dosa with paneer that was surprisingly delectable for something so seemingly simple. The chutneys that accompanied them (cilantro and mint, tomato, and a spicy, gravyesque one) were all perfection. The wine list was short but well chosen (the cab franc went especially well with the richer chicken dishes), and lambic beer and soju cocktails (including a \"russian chai\" which is a delicious twist on a white russian) round out the beverage selection. Don't wear a belt so you can enjoy the dessert--the paneer with sweet cream is rich but worth it. The owners Anjan and Emily are sure to succeed with this well-thought out menu, warm yet modern atmosphere, and cheerful, attentive service.", "author": "Gretchen T."}

We had to wait about half an hour to get a table for two (they only take reservations for parties of 5 or more), but it was truly worth the wait.  I had the paper masala dosa (thin, crispy long rolled crepe-type deal with a potato filling), served with truly tasty sambar (soup, basically) and chutneys (dipping sauces).  For some reason, the masala aspect (meaning the potato mixture) of my paper masala dosa was served up in a separate bowl rather than stuffed within it, whereas the regular masala dosa came stuffed.  Either way, the taste was great!  The pappadum (salty fried chips-type things) they provided before taking the order was good too, and they have a nice, extensive list of drinks.\n\nYou have the option of getting a 4-course meal for $35 (meaning a soup, starter, entree, and dessert), but honestly unless you're like SUPER hungry, I think just going straight to the dosa will work just fine.  I am a total hulk, and this satiated me.  I'm a little disappointed that I, unlike other reviewers, did not receive a cultural lesson on the cuisines of India! :\\ Oh well. Maybe because we were both brown.\n\nNote that this is not a good place for you if you prefer your Indian restaurants and the people within them to be a living, breathing museum of ethnic stereotypes.  There are no servers dressed in maharaja uniforms, bowing politely to the backdrop of melodious flute and sitar music. Also, don't ASSume that this isn't real Indian food because there is no nan, tandoori chicken, or samosas; we are by no means a monolithic people, and each region has its own cuisine.  Contrary to what some reviews have stated, the dosas look and taste pretty like the ones actually found in South India (not that cross-cultural culinary experimentation would be a problem anyway).  It's just the very trendy decor and hipster-Mission look of the restaurant (including the staff) and the music (er, don't know what the genre is called, but it wasn't Indian) that give it the feeling of \"fusion.\" And what's wrong with that?", "author": "Leena K."}

My husband and I love south Indian food and do not mind driving to Berkeley or the South Bay for it. But I am seven months pregnant and wanted to try south indian food close to home. We were told that it would be a forty minute wait. We waited an hour 30 minutes!! I almost fainted by the end of the wait. To their credit, the service staff was polite and gave me a chair to sit on. but twice they gave a table to people who walked in half hour after us. Granted, it was a table for four but there were plenty of couples who had been waiting a while and would have been happy to share a table for four. We were pretty mad and exhausted when we finally got to sit. They got the starters out right away but the food took a really long time to come. We started with the Rasam and the calamari. The rasam tasted like it was out of a box but the calamari was actually good. For entrees, we ordered the Rava Dosa and the pepper chicken. Both were extremely mediocre and nothing to write home about.  \r\nSo if you have to wait more than 20 minutes to get a table, just drive to berkeley and eat at either Priya or Udipi, both offering wonderful no-frills south indian food that is far more authentic. \r\nA message for those who just keep sitting there once they are done eating while the line outside just keeps getting longer (the owner finally had to hint to a group of 3 who were all to happy to just sit their half hour after their check had arrived.

Every time I go I never have a reservation, only a desperate hope and prayer that a table for two might be opening up sometime in the next hour for me and my dining partner.  Alas, my prayer goes unanswered as I'm turned away time and time again by a line of people outside and a hostess who is unable to accommodate my hunger pangs and desire for that large South Indian crepe craving that can only be cured by a whopping dosa.  Tonight, however, God looked kindly upon me and my friend as we were told a table would be available in 15 minutes.  I was about to get my dosa fix!  I haven't had a dosa since I visited India four years ago, but I distinctly remember how much I enjoyed it.  I've been hearing great things about Dosa and the excellent South Indian cuisine since it opened on Valencia.  Needless to say, after this many attempts and all the hype, I was ready to be disappointed.  I was not.\n\nThe meal started off right with the friendly and courteous owner himself, Anjan taking our order and making some helpful recommendations (I was so hungry and eager that I was about to order food for the next three days and he held me back).  We started off with the Chennai Chicken which was a delicious mix of spicy kick calmed by the cool yogurt dipping sauce.   We then proceeded to share the Masala Dosa which was deliciously paired with the flavorful chutneys and superbly prepared sambar.  We also ordered the Prawn Coconut Curry and the Tamil Lamb Curry which were both extraordinary.  I expected that they would be too spicy, salty or sweet.  They were both perfectly seasoned and the not overpowering at all.  Every bite of the curries mixed with the basmati rice or Uttapam was a pleasure to consume.  The portions were very reasonable and we had plenty of food leftover to take home.  The prices were very very reasonable and the portions very generous for any Indian restaurant, much less one of this caliber.  The service was excellent and the waitstaff very attentive.   \n\nIf you haven't had South Indian food, I highly recommend trying it out.  This ain't your momma's Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan we're talking about here.  It's totally different from the mainstream Indian fare.  Anjan and his wife know how to run a restaurant.  He must have come over to our table 3 or 4 times to talk to us about the food and our experience.   That level of attention always stands out to me because an owner who cares that much about his food and patrons demonstrates how much he loves his restaurant.  We were around when things were slowing down and chatted with him for a bit.  I'm happy that a guy that nice is having this type of success with his first restaurant.

I did not understand this until it was too late. \nAnd by too late I mean when we are seated and have asked for more liquor at which point the BF gives up on deciphering through his vodka haze and puts me and the vegetarian in charge. \nWhen I am drunk I want to grunt and point at pictures of food. \nSomehow we manage to pick some things and the waitress gives her approval for our choices. This is the part where I am supposed to say to her \"Uh did we order anything that doesn't have cilantro in it?\" I forget that step. \nApparently my BF also forgets this step. BC when food starts showing up and I ask the other waitress the important question she laughs at me. Of course there is cilantro in everything. I know this. \nOh well. BF eats the pepper chicken and deems it quite good while the veg and I get down with the paper Dosa which was really good, especially the dipping soup, I can't remember what that was called but it was great. The one thing that we had which I would not recommend was some kind of lentil patty covered in this major sauce pool which none of us really understood or liked. \nSo i guess the important lesson here is have your wits about you when you go here. You will need your brain.\nLearn from my mistakes people because one of us has to and it is certainly not gonna be me!", "author": "Melissa H."}

Decent but very overpriced relative to much tastier Indian food.  One of things that i enjoy at indian restaurants are the condiments and the sauces.  The condiments were minimal, less tasty than at the cheaper Nan and Curry style places, and the sauces were also less exciting.  Certainly nothing memorable.  The waiters were attentive, but a bit patronizing, acting like we had never tried Indian food before.... please.\n\nThis place would get a three as the food was decent, if the prices were even close to reasonable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-01-06", "description": "I had twice eaten very well at Dosa, so when my parents wanted to try a new restaurant, I suggested going there on a recent Tuesday night. Unfortunately, while the food was good, we had a very unpleasant incident with our waitress, who made it very clear how little she cared about what kind of  experience we had. I will not be going back.\n\nWe were a very friendly party, relaxed and in the mood to have a good time, and everything started out fine. We were early for our reservation, but were seated within five minutes. We ordered two bottles of wine, and four appetizers for the table to share, and seemed to have a nice rapport with our waitress. The wine and appetizers were served in good time, and we were all enjoying ourselves. Things were off to a great start.\n\nThen, three of us were served our entrees. No problem -- we waited a few minutes, expecting the rest of the food to come out shortly, or for the waitress to notice and tell us what was going on. (I think they have food runners, because our food was served by a combination of different people, none of whom would speak to us). When nothing happened after a reasonable amount of time (maybe 10 minutes?), we flagged down our waitress to let her know we were still waiting on four dishes. She said she would check with the kitchen, and came by again shortly to say there was a mistake and they were doing what they could to fix it.  \n\nAt this point, she started to get a little aggressive - like we had been giving her a hard time or something. Which we had not be doing at all - we were all still very nice. \"No problem,\" we said. She walked away, without giving any indication of how long we'd have to wait, or offering to bring those waiting on dishes anything to tide them over.\n\nFive minutes later, or so, a fourth dish came out. Then, nothing. After another ten minutes, we thought we had better let our waitress know we were still waiting - she had not come by to check on us. Again, we caught her attention and politely let her know that we still needed three dishes. \n\nAt this point, she snapped at us, saying that \"the kitchen is already aware of it!!!\" And stalking off. We were stunned! Many of us at the table have worked in food service, and it did not seem unreasonable to inquire politely about food that was taking a very long time - we just wanted to make sure it hadn't been overlooked - she's the one who can talk to the kitchen staff, not us. By the time the last dish had been served, those of us who had been served first had been done eating for quite some time. \n\nAgain, we ate well, and had a nice time. The only real problem with the meal was the waitress's attitude. I am sure she was stressed, it was busy, but she was very unpleasant with us. I might be paranoid, but I had the feeling that she felt she could brush us off because, as a large table, our 20 percent tip was going to be added to the tab no matter what happened.\n\nEventually, the waitress came over with four dishes of ice cream (not enought for the whole table) and offered what I suppose was an apology (she never actually said, we are so sorry, and I'm sorry I snapped at you) for the food arriving at all different times. She ended with an aggressive, \"You're night isn't ruined, right?\" \n\nWell, of course not, but we thought for sure she would not add the compulsory 20 percent tip and let us decide for ourselves how much her service was worth. But, she did indeed add the service charge. (The manager did come by to offer us a more heartfelt apology for the mix up, which we appreciated. By then, however, it was too late.)\n\nIn the end, our objection was NOT that there was a kitchen mix up. As frequent restaurant diners, and former restaurant workers, we understand that can and does happen, and that it's nobody's fault, especially (usually) not the wait staff's. \n\nHowever, what we did object to was her prickly behavior when we asked about our meals. The message she gave us was that she didn't really care if we had a good experience at Dosa. \n\nThe food at Dosa is very good, so it's sad for me to say this, but because of the poor treatment we experienced, I will not be going back.", "author": "A O."}

I've tried a lot of things on the menu, my previous experience with South Indian foods being in Bangalore and the South Bay. The dosas are excellent. I even like the non-traditional cheddar cheese dosa. It's like a quesadilla and it's fantastic. I'm in favor of evolving cuisines, afterall, if noone experimented, we would eat the same boring shiite all the time. I love the channa bhatura, but the portion is enormous. It's kind of daunting to feel like you have to finish that enormous bowl of channa and even more enormous piece of deep-fried bread. For idlis, no one makes them as tender as mom does, so I recommend getting vada or dosa if you like sambar. The chennai chicken is sooo delicious it's guilt inducing. The curries are all excellent. My favorite chutney is the tomato chutney. I'd like to see the other chutney be a green chutney with cilantro in it. That fresh green taste would really round out the flavors. Now the ambiance at Dosa is pretty good. It's loud inside, but wonderfully decorated in a non-tacky fashion. It's not cafeteria style like all those places in the Peninsula. The crowd is distinctly good-looking, and it's a great place for people watching. You will do this because the wait is long, even if you're a friend of the owners or did the art on the walls (that was me) the hostess will still make you wait. The busboys are really sweet though, and the barpeople are pretty good. The Mango Seed cocktail of mango lassi and soju is super yummy and the wine list is thoughtful and increasing all the time. Well to sum it up, the food is really quite good, very nice ambiance that is a little loud, and the waitstaff is hit or miss. The portions are way too big, so don't go there alone if you want to try out more than one dish.  When the owners are on site, as they often are, they go out of their way to say hello and try to seat us. More often than not, we eat at the bar, which is a good option if you don't want to wait for a table. Five stars!\n\nBy the way, this is a \"hello\"  for all the morons who wonder why they don't serve naans at Dosa.  I don't even know why you bother reviewing it. South Indian food is a completely different cuisine! And the little \"sticks\" in the sambar are a very yummy vegetable called \"drumstick\". You actually strip away the flesh with your teeth. They add an essential flavor to the sambar.  ANyway, please take your $7 and go back to Naan and Curry because the line is long and I don't want to wait in it for an hour only to hear you gripe about there being no Chicken Tikka Masala.

I was still confused.\nWe got our tea and the server asked if we wanted any other drinks or to start with apps. I jumped on the app order.\n\nPrawn Chili Fry: Prawns rubbed in lentil flour, chili powder & other spices and fried, served with shredded romaine.\nPaneer & Romaine: Romaine leaves topped with pieces of lightly fried farmer's cheese, organic cherry tomatoes, and thinly sliced cucumber served in a creamy garlic dressing.\n\"Sound alright?\" I asked my friends. \"Sure, what ever.\"\nWe like to be random and we like to share in the randomness.\n\nA couple minute later the server came back and my friends finished our ordering with 2 dishes or their choice.\nTamil Lamb Curry: Free-range natural lamb in a sauce of fennel, tomatoes, poppy seeds, caramelized onions and a blend of other spices.\nand, an order of\nMasala: Uttapam topped with spiced Indian potatoes, onions and cashew nuts.\nWe chat, laugh, cap and joke and have a great time. And our food begins to arrive, really fast.\nWow.\nSince I have no experience in the field of South Indian cuisine, I won't attempt to describe the flavors, textures, colors and aromas of our dishes to you the reader. I feel that it would do it great injustice. But, I will say that it was incredible.\nIncredibly delicious and gorgeous. Exotic and spiritual.\n\nOn the down side. I feel that out server was over extended. Once we got our orders in and received our meals, we didn't see her. We wanted to order some wine. I kept trying to get her attention, but no luck. Just as we were about to say \"fuckit\", a person I figured out to be the floor manager asked us about our meal and if we needed anything.\n\"Yeah, can we get a wine menu please?\"\n\nHe returned very quickly and gave us a couple minutes to decide before taking our orders.\nJC decided on a velvety and spicy Spanish red, and I ordered a soft and sweet Chilean red. Both went well with all out dishes. Very very nice.\nAs we were finishing up our meal and sitting back and sipping wine, our server finally returns to ask our status. Despite the lack of attention, we were ALL good.", "author": "Kione E."}

The fianc\u00e9e and I like to think of ourselves as connoisseurs of the cheap and dirty Bay Area Indian-Pakistani dives ever since that down-and-dirty gem, Kabana, near our former University Ave and San Pablo pad, won over our hearts and taste buds. From that first fateful evening when we stopped by for some Saag, Kabana became a firmly-entrenched weekly tradition. Fast-forward three years and we are driven to Dosa by the 1000+ positive Yelp reviews on a warm, hungry night out in the Mission. Once inside the famed Dosa, we were similarly  drawn to the Dahi Vada and Chennai Chicken by the fanatical Yelp reviews in their favor. The former was relatively tasteless while the latter was good, but like any fried chicken tenders are good (i.e. not worth 10 bucks). Yes, 'Chennai Chicken' is a fancy name for chicken tenders that couldn't hold a candle to anything you'd get at your local Chick-fil-A. I ordered a glass of gewurztraminer, which rarely disappoints, but managed to do so, and even more so at $12 the glass (d'oh!). The finac\u00e9e had a significantly more drinkable Spanish red. We ordered the Masala Dosa for our main dish and were left longing for the piping hot Garlic N'aan and  greasy, soupy Masala from Kabana or the literally finger-licking good food of the Ethopian Cafe Colucci in Berkeley. It's not often that a night out in the City has us dreaming of our old digs in Berkeley, but Dosa managed to do the trick. We tried to salvage the meal with dessert, but the Rasmalai, while tastier than the rest of our sub-par supper, was of a funky texture that left us less than impressed. The portions were such that on the way back to our car we almost bought a delicious-smelling sausage from a street-vender on the corner of Capp and 22nd. Needless to say, we won't be back. In short, if you're looking for a stylish venue (which Dosa is), go somewhere with better food (Andal\u00fa, Foreign Cinema and Lim\u00f3n are nearby)...and if you're hunkering for good Indian food, even N'aan and Curry will better satisfy your urge and for about $60 less...", "author": "Matthew Z."}

But the prices - especially for South Indian food - are ridiculous. This is a typically wannabe SF eatery, more about the fake ambience than the actual meal on your plate.  And the ambience isn't even that good - the service wasn't great, and the tables were much too close together, allowing no privacy at all.\n\nCount how many Indians are at Dosa on a typical evening.  Then walk down the block and count how many are at Udupi.  I rest my case.\n\n---\n\nI got a very polite response from the owners, who claim (among other things) that a direct comparison to lower end restaurants is unfair because Dosa uses natural ingredients and observes good business practices.  All of which I greatly respect, actually.  So I added one star.  \n\nBut ... the fact remains that when I'm paying a good chunk of my hard earned money for a meal, I have high expectations (about the food, most of all), and Dosa did not meet those expectations.  And although the comparison to much lower priced Indian restaurants may be unfair, it still lurks in the back of my mind.

We didn't make a reservation because we weren't sure what time we'd get there. We arrived around 6:30 and were told it was a 30 min wait for 2 people but we could have an appetizer at the bar. We only had time to order our mango lassis (super thick but tasty)before we already had a table, less than 10 minutes. I almost left when they said the 30 min wait so it's a good thing I didn't!! Both of us had the seasonal tasting menu, which is $35 per person I think, for three courses. Local, organic, seasonal food! Our waitress was very sweet and friendly. For the first course, roomie had the chicken, sort of an Indian chicken nuggets, and I had the pear avocado salad. Both good. For the second course, roomie had the special hot pepper uttapam and I had the sweet pepper sunchoke uttapam. They were both really good, and I think these were the best of the whole meal. Two options on the second course had nuts, but the waitress was able to steer us away from them. For the last course, we both chose the veggie bhatura, which came with a poffy bread. It was good, but lacking in real veggies. I love squash and I had one, maybe two pieces, just one cauliflower bite and one green bean. But mostly potatoes. I'm ok on potatoes but not a super duper fan, I would have liked more veggies. Roomie concurred. Still, really tasty, good sauce and bread. The dessert menu is nut-heavy. We ordered one cool looking carrot dessert that didn't say it had nuts, but when it came, it did. Only the chocolate cake doesn't, and I wasn't in a chocolate cake mood, but the waitress was super nice and apologetic. We both had chai tea soo good and a great way to finish off a nice meal. This is listed as $$ here on yelp but it should be $$$. For 2 chais, 2 lassis, and 2 dinners, it came out to $100 and change, which was worth it, but just note that if you're coming here expecting to pay $11-30, odds are, you'll really be paying more.

Minus one star for one rude person of the wait staff (if you are interested in story, see below).\n\nThe food:\n\nI don't think I've ever had Southern Indian food and Dosa is probably the best Indian food I've had in awhile.  I don't mind paying a little extra, especially when it's as good as Dosa is.\n\nThere is only one non-vegetarian option from what I could tell from the menu.  It changes daily.  Sunday's daily special was a lamb dish.  It was soft pieces of lamb with a firecracker spicy sauce.  Excellent and addicting.  Our second item was a traditional Paneer dosa with farm cheese and vegetables.  Very very good. And the chutneys that accompany the dosas are excellent.  \n\nOur server:\n\nIn Jennifer's defense, I did bring my one year old to a packed restaurant on a Sunday.  And he was a little cranky because he was hungry.  Had she checked on us, I would have asked if there was anything kid friendly (not in a heavy sauce) on the menu, as he was not interested in the dosa I ordered for him.  Or I might have ordered a second mango lassi to bribe him.  But to my relief, he made it through without any real scandals.\n\nThe reason I feel offended is because my older boy order a mango lassi with the original meal order.  Jennifer, our server asked if I wanted to try one also.  I responded, that I would sample his and if I liked it, I too would order a second.  We finished our meal before we ever saw the mango lassi or our server again.  With fire coming from our mouths, we'd finished our waters and I could not get her attention.  When we finally did get her attention she argued with me and said that she had already served us with a mango lassi earlier.  She left and returned twice asking me again and again if I was sure that she had not given us the lassi.  At this point I was ready to snap, it was extremely rude.  The lassi costs a measly $4 and if my son wanted to drink 3 on our lunch date, I would buy them for him.  I would not lie and try to weasel a second from the server for free.   When she finally returned with the mango lassi she made a comment about how she remembers giving the drink to us and she also remembers saying how much we were going to enjoy it.  Then she retreated to the back of the restaurant and kept watch on us, like as if the mysterious glass was going to reappear and she would catch us.  Now how were we supposed to enjoy the remainder of our meal and the lassi after we were repeatedly insulted?  I wanted to get up and leave, but I did not want to spoil lunch for my boys.  It's too bad that the server did not have the same consideration for us.   \n\n= MINUS ONE STAR", "author": "Jessica R."}

It was very flavorful and on par with other Southern Indian food I have tried. I mean I have never been to India but from what I have heard it is fairly authentic.

I mean if it is that's fine , my favorite Japanese restaurant growing up was owned by Koreans so it is not really a big deal. Anyway, I think the prices were fair.

They did act like we had never had Indian food before \"Channa means chickpeas basically\" and \"a curry is a spicy dish\". Eh really I never knew that. We also brought our own drinks from the whole foods store next door. In less than 30secs 4 waiters stormed our table and made us feel super ashamed about it. I understand bringing outside food and it was a mistake but not that big of a deal  but seriously 4 waiters!! They gave us a lecture like we were 4th graders and even poured our drinks into glasses they brought. I made the mistake of pouring my own drink into my own empty water glass and got reprimanded. I mean really. The next thing that happened is they hovered after that incident. Then they were all about us leaving, we wanted dessert though they began to clear our table before the last bite of food was even in my mouth.

There is such a buzz about this place that we HAD to try it.  We finally were able to go when we went here not as hungry as the previous times.  I need to highlight this, but the staff was very friendly; especially the wine guy and the bartender who's recommendations we used to select our dishes.  There was actual conversation and not just rote pleasantries with a smile.  Having said that, I understand one of the main principles of running a restaurant is having a high customer turnover, I felt a little rushed when I was slapped with a menu before I even took my first sip waiting for a spot at the bar.  \n\nIt was one of those rare warm SF evenings and I wanted a good cold beer, unfortunately, I couldn't find one on the menu, so I settled for a mango mimosa and a mango seed for my friend.  The mango seed which is mango lassi and soju was pretty good but a bit a little bit heavier than what I was craving for at that moment.  Ahhh, but you can't go wrong with mimosa right?  Wrong!  I think the fresh mango that they used was out of season or was not ripe enough, because the mango mimosa was really tart; the combination  evaporated the natural sweetness that usually comes with mango and champagne.  It tasted like I was drinking a really bad champagne bottle; I didn't know Charles Shaw made champagne.  Although, the \"Tank Girl(?)\" wine that the bartender recommended was really really good.\n\nI'm a calamari-holic and order calamari at every restaurant I go to.  It's definitely made my bill much more expensive most of the time, but I'm willing to pay for it to find those rare instances when I find a definite winner.  This calamari was not one of them.  While the actual calamari was very fresh, the sauce it came with overwhelmed the squid and made the dish literally taste like regular pasta......and it was the pasta that an old friend's mom used to make that made him not my friend anymore.  How can you mess up pasta?\n\nThe Lamb Kofta was excellent and was a bit peeved that my friend liked it as well; damn her.  I really liked the various Uttapams and the paneer and peas really surprised me; I'm not a big cheese guy and I actual enjoy this.  In conclusion, my friend thought the dishes were really salty, I thought they were very tasty and I was able to taste most of the ingredients used.  We both felt that the uttapams and the paneer was better on their own, adding the chutneys and the sambar to them really confused the palate.  I'm used to dallop chutney on my dishes, but had to restrain myself with these dishes.  Weird right?  I think this is what my friend meant when she said the food was salty.

The dosas are okay, often nicely crispy.  My choices are the masala dosa and the paper dosa, as I think they taste the most authentic.  The uttapams are okay as well, but their temperature sometimes suggests they are heated under a lamp.  The same goes for the lamb curry, which on a good day, is nicely piquant and zesty, but when tepid, tastes like just another curry with some lamb.  The chickpea salad is lovely, but honestly, to call it South Indian-inspired would even be a stretch.  My South Indian friends simply shake their heads at the idea that Dosa has the chutzpah to claim authenticity.  They all grew up on South Indian food courtesy of Mom, so I turn to them for precise judgment, as I would turn to Koreans who have had food in Seoul or Los Angeles' Koreatown when it comes to authentic, great-tasting Korean.  Their opinions notwithstanding, everything tastes fine so long as you do not expect the rich tapestry of spices that comes from undiluted South Indian home-cooking.  For the latter, the choices are endless if you go to the South Bay or Berkeley, which is a stone's throw away.  And everything is ridiculously overpriced, especially the trademark dosas.\n\nThe decor is very nice--warm with earthy, clay tones, the lighting and furniture add a smooth, modern touch.  There is a full bar and the bartenders are eager to help.  The wine list is interesting.  I had syrah from India and that was... interesting.  Service is fine.  They are always busy bees and the tables are too close together.  Still, Dosa is here to stay and I am curious to try the new one on Fillmore.", "author": "Dee C."}

So packed that we had to wait 25 minutes for a table-a sign that the food is good.  \n\nMaybe my slight disappointment in the food had to do with the fact that I wasn't really in the mood for Indian food to begin with, but nevertheless I still feel like northern Indian food is tastier and appeals to more people than the type of food offered at Dosa.  We ordered the lamb meatball curry, the spiced fried boneless chicken appetizer (i forget the proper names for all these dishes), the puffy fry bread, a side of coconut rice and the pea, cilantro and farmers cheese uttapan.  The curry was good, although I would have appreciated it more if it had chunks of lamb meat instead of lamb meatballs.  The uttapan was so-so; it was not what we were expecting.  We thought it was going to be a type of thick bread similar to naan-except it was more like an omelette or something.  It was a bit heavy and didn't stick together well.  But, the veggies inside were tasty and the occasional burst of texture from the peas was a nice touch.  The puffy fry bread was AWESOME!  Definitely get it-who doesn't like fried dough?!?  Lastly, we ordered the honey rice ball things for dessert, which were OK.  I'm used to those being served in a rice pudding type soup, but these were soaking in basically a hot simple syrup liquid-and they were HOTT as hell.  My bf burned his mouth on them so watch out for that.  And also, they only gave us two honeyballs-for $5 I feel like they should be giving 4.  Most people share dessert nowadays, and two measly little balls seemed like a rip off in my opinion.\n\nMoving on to the service.  Although our server was friendly and polite, I felt like she was just totally not on the same page as we were.  Every time I asked a question, I felt like she didn't understand what I was inquiring about and the answer I received was confusing and strange.  It was weird.  And, I felt like she could have been slightly more attentive-the other waitress on duty seemed to be on the floor a lot more than our server was...I found myself wishing we had her as a server instead of the one assigned to us.  Sorry, but true. \n\nAll in all, it was a decent meal but the next time I'm craving Indian I will most likely opt for the northern Indian food I am more accustomed to.", "author": "Genevieve M."}

It wasn't too busy and service was spot on.  Their \"brunch\" menu didn't look any different than what you would expect on a regular menu except that they offered alcoholic brunch drinks and egg-related dishes.  Of course, I wanted to try their infamous dosas so I ordered the spicy mung masala dosa, which is filled with curried-flavor mung bean and potato with chopped up onions and bell peppers.  My man ordered the paneer and peas dosa, which was served very differently than my dosa (see my photos).  While mine was the dramatically large rolled crepe with filling loosely placed in the middle, his was wrapped into a tight, burrito-like structure.  Both were very tasty, and a bit spicy, but not too spicy.  I liked the crispy \"chips\" that they give in the beginning of the meal (like tortilla chips in Mexican places). and also the fact that the dosas came with two different chuneys (a tomato based one and a bean based one, I think) to dip, and also a small bowl of lentil/veggie soup called sambar.  Two dosas for the two of us was $25 w/o tip and we were stuffed silly.  Still had room for a Humphrey Slocombe ice cream after a short walk there ;)", "author": "Grace M."}

The papadum, unfortunately, was a salt lick, as if someone simply paid no attention to how much salt was added. The chile and onion pakora was nice, but mucking up a chickpea-batter fritter is nearly impossible. Is it too heavy? No. Is it too greasy? No. Done. The classic masala dosa (filled with potatoes, onions, cashew nuts) was just fine too. Was there any applause from my cells? Not even a chirp, but it was just fine. The Vada Pav, a vegetarian slider with a spiced-potato patty, chutneys, onions, etc., was nice, if uninspiring - and it still eludes me why you are asked to mix the \"gunpowder\" and ghee to apply to the slider yourself. The Tamil lamb curry, which they serve with the lemon rice, was good enough; and that, in the end, was the 'flaw' with everything - all was good, nothing great, and I'd rather eat at Vik's Chaat (Berkeley) any day of the week. Dosa's 'organic' sourcing and product pride is well and fine, but better flavor is better flavor. The 'Southern' influence of Dosa's cuisine is not much of an inducement (I thought it would be); it's not especially distinguished in its spicing from what you find in other Indian restaurants. I'll be honest with you - next time I'm in the area looking for an Indian meal, I'll try Udupi Palace instead, and I'm no vegetarian, so take that as you will, yeah? In sum: fine service, enjoyable space, good food, a nice wine and liquor selection; but if the brilliant originality and power of Indian cuisine is your one true thing, there is better to be had without the frills or extra bills.", "author": "Brski B."}

I guess i will have to try it out next time. ) \nc) Tamil Lamb ( thanks for the correction ) , i thought this one was funny. Lot of Tamils I know are vege eaters, and some are not.

And even if you decorate your little locale to be the \"hot spot,\" I don't give 2 shits. The food needs to be good. Sorry, I like food. Now, I admit I am not as familiar w/ south indian cuisine. Although i did have south indian in india...well, the northern part of india, and it was good. Now, with this restaurant, we were all overwhelmed by the menu. The veggie crepe thing I got was ok, but I kept combining like 4 different sauces over it to give it flavor...and there was so much crepe. I don't really know what the deal is - if this is a very western version or what, but it was just not  quite working for me or my party. \n2. Ambiance - ok, it's a nice setting. however, the music was elevator music which i asked the manager to change. she did to mellow indian beats...but nothing inspiring. the bar is cute. lighting is nice. But we were seated at a table in the front and it was so awkward. \n3. Servie -- if you have read any of my reviews, you know this is a biggie for me. First, the people I dealt with were awkward. Except for the bartender - I was a huge fan of her. She was cool. Had I known, I would have spent my night at the bar instead of at an awkward table. The manager was ok. The hostess had some major attitude. The waitresses were ok, but not very smooth. Maybe they lacked experience? Also, there was no place to hang my coat. It was dragging on the ground and it took them forever to figure out a solution - that is, to figure out to hang it up on the hangers they had on the wall. They sat us at an awkward table and were just generally awkward. I guess the theme here is awkward and not smooth. And then when we left the restaurant, the waitress didn't even say thank you or give us a nice farewell like a proper waitress. Really did not sit well.....all in all, what a total disappointment.\nI guess if I had lowered my expectations the price and experience would have been different. It's just so hard to say, hey, go to this restaurant where you're going to pay significantly more money, not like the food that much, and be around awkward displeasing service, when I could say, head to Naan and Curry, pay $7 a person and enjoy some seriously amazing food, drink free chai, listen to bollywood beats, and hang out w/ Rashad..... and i like chic places, but good places are good places....and this does not even come close to the top 1%....but Naan and Curry.....now that's a great place.", "author": "Jess P."}

My favorite is the Rava Masala, but everything I've had here has been wonderful.  I highly recommend a mango lassi, smooth, flavorful and easy on the sugar makes this drink the perfect accompaniment to a spicy meal.  On that note, don't come here if you can't handle a little heat, this is Indian food after all.  The coconut chutney cools things off nicely though should you find your ears whistling and/or emitting steam.  Service has been consistently outstanding.", "author": "Celeste A."}

Was reading the writeup at the window and this is a southern indian restaurant...hmm interesting, it must be spicy then. We sat down after 5 mins of waiting time and our friendly server showed up. We were given a plate of papadam on the house, nicely done. We ordered appetizer - Chennai Chickeu Boneless chicken cubes marinated in Strauss organic yogurt and spiced with cilantro, coriander, cumin and curry leaves, lightly fried, served with mixed greens which came in a jiffy. Then for entrees, we had the Masala - classic Dosa filled with creamy, spiced potatoes, onions, and cashew nuts and sampler of uttapam - South Indian Moons the chef's selection of five different uttapams served with sambar, channa (gurbanzo beans) and chutney. Was slightly disappointed with the Dosa Masala since it was rolled into a burrito-styled serving with lots of stuffing, not the way I know of Dosa. I was really hoping for the paper thin dosa, should have ordered the crispy paper dosa served without the filling. Alright next time maybe...it was still packed when we left at 8:30 and patrons were still waiting for their table.

They're little crispy hollow pastry thingees that you break a hole into the top of and fill with delicious things like chickpeas, potatoes and mung beans.  Then tamarind and cilantro \"waters\" are poured into the cups so that they're full.  Then you just pop them into your mouth.  Wonderful!   (They only serve them at brunch and Monday nights... check them out!).  I never knew I loved tamarind so much!

We were there early, but waited nearly 20 minutes past 7:30 to be seated, while they were seating people right off the street with smaller parties. Ok, I understand big parties are hard to seat.

We only got 1 round of drinks, not the 2 or 3 that we would have preferred and when the manager checked in on us because our server was MIA, he took our order for a second round of drinks (after we were done eating our main course) and never brought it to the table. The bill would have been nearly double if we would have had a chance to order more drinks... too bad for them!

They require everyone to be there before seating us, which - in the case of last night - meant that six people waited for 10 minutes at the bar while our assigned table sat vacant. Frustrated, esp. when we'd been on our feet all day...would have liked to sit and relax.\n\nThe only other frustration came with a mix-up with the check - took us over 15 minutes to get out of there, and they still mis-charged the ONE credit card we had. They remedied this by giving us the difference in cash, but it was still a bit annoying.\n\nThat said.\n\nThe food here is consistently tasty; for those who aren't familiar with South Indian, it's mainly vegetarian and quite different from your \"traditional\" Indian (Naan 'n Chutney-esque restaurants that you see on every corner.) Their Uttapam and Dosa are both fantastic, whichever variety you choose, and I tried the calamari appetizer which tasted like Christmas. (Must have been the cloves, and note I *LIKE* things that taste like Christmas!) We always get the beautifully presented Dahi Vada and literally have to get more papadom  to scoop out the last morsels of this tastiness.\n\nI will certainly return to Dosa and hope that they reconsider their seating policy for large groups (or are more willing to make an exception for \"regular\" customers like ourselves) as this restaurant would clearly earn at least 4 stars if not for that service snafu.", "author": "Aubrey S."}

I'd say, however there are few draw backs that are probably just plain inevitable for the location and quality: (1) it's expensive and (2) it's crowded on every night of the week (60+ minute waits sometimes) and (3) it's cramped (too many people, too little space; can get hot and stuffy, like you're back in India again).  \n\nI stick to a few favorites when I go here.  The masala dosa is good though not necessarily the best I've had.  The sambar is pretty good too.  What I like best there is the rasam (the 'fire broth') it had a good deal or fire in it when I had it and I wouldn't recommend sipping it out of the bowl as the menu suggests... might be too much fire.  The chole bhatura (uhm, chane, or in english, I guess it's curried garbanzo beans and deep-fried leavened flat bread) is pretty good too.  I'd say besides home, there's been only one other place in the bay area where I've enjoyed it when eating out.  Finally, I had their mango kulfi once.  I'd give the kulfi a four, but the size of their portion is a definite thumbs down.\n\nThe service is also pretty good.  Every waiter/waitress we've ever gotten there has been easy going and attentive, but not overbearingly so.\n\nI'd recommend going out with a group of friends to this place (preferably for a special occasion since it's a bit too pricey), but I wouldn't recommend it if you are just trying to relax and kick back or were just trying to get a quick bite.  \n\nUltimately, I'm sure there are other places where you can get comparable (equal or better) quality South Indian food for half the price and twice the leg room with almost no wait. (Not sure where they are in the city, but there's at least a couple of South Indian places in Berkeley that should do it).", "author": "Anx R."}

This is even more of a problem now that you can easily get more food and more authenticity for about a third of the price next door, at Udupi Palace.

Anyway, I went here, because I heard it had good vegan Indian food, which is hard to find in this city! When I was vegetarian I would stuff myself with Indian food all the time until I was in pain. Now, I'm having trouble finding a place that understands what vegan is (one place in the marina served me up a big chunk o paneer, yuck!, btw, on a side track what is the point of paneer, it tastes like tofu anyway, couldn't they just replace it with tofu?) Anyway, I do believe and hope that we found that holy grail: yummy vegan Indian food at this place. We told our server we were vegan and asked if we could do the tasting menu, and she said yes, they could make anything that wasn't already vegan, vegan. We started with lentil soup and a sprouted chick pea salad. The sprouted lentil salad was fresh but not amazing. The soup was very spicy and yummy.  Then we got our dosas, which turned out to be very crepe-like (of course now my suspicions of egg are creeping up). They were filled with yummy veggies and potatoes and came with three orgasmically good sauces. I almost licked out the rest of the coconut sauce. Then came our curries. I got a vegetable masala that was pretty good, not amazing. My boyfriend got a chana masala that was freakin delicious (she had them leave out the cream she said), and we ended with a coconut sorbet, which was yummy and fresh, but nothing to write home about. It was a pricey night, but our server was nice, and, at least I hope, it was my first good vegan Indian food experience in the city!\n\n***update***\nI've been assured by one of the owners that the food I ate here was, in fact,  vegan, and the dosas are made with fermented rice and lentils, and can easily be made without ghee.

It's prepared with so much care, it's evident from the first bite that the chef knows what he's doing. I always get the 5-indian-moons - chef's choice of 5 uttappams, with sambar and chutney accompaniments. This dish is hands down my fave.

We also get the chilli chicken, which is delicately flavored and seriously good. Hubby usually gets a dosa, they rock at the potato filling, the sambar with ghee smells oh so good, and they are very very attentive at refilling water, but leaving you with good privacy especially for couples. \n\nHave been to Dosa 10+ times now and never had anything to complain about.

LOTS OF PEOPLE know about you, talk about you, want to eat at you. Mission \"generate buzz\" accomplished.\n2) I'm not conducting surveys but I'd still guess that the majority of your patrons are local-ish (Mission, Noe, Bernal, Castro) and if I may say so, when the options are a) wait for 45-hour or b) eat dinner at 4:30 in the afternoon: the hassle factor starts to drive us elsewhere.  (and I can't imagine this helps with the audiences for whom the mission location is not a plus). You are unique enough that sometimes I'll brave this, but there's many a night when I end up elsewhere even though you were my first choice. (later weekend hours would remedy this as well)\n3) Though you are an excellent romantic but not too romantic dinner spot, I can never plan such dinners at you because of aforementioned unromantic things like 45minute waits and 4:30 in the afternoon.\n4) The people standing outside are like the evening version of the Boogaloo morning crowd - not in appearance,mind you, but in annoying-blocking the sidewalk factor.\n5) The current reservation policy (5 or more, 4 or more?) encourages patronage by the kind of people who move in herds, who are, in general - how do I say this delicately?-  tacky (I do not extend this criticism to family groups, who tend to make me smile and I enjoy eavesdropping on) Now, tacky people are entitled to your goodness too. . .but a herd of them is a bit much.  Alternatively, it encourages the rest of us to accumulate a herd which encourages us to drink more and get loud and disturb those lucky diners who have persevered with the romantic dinner thing.  \n\nNow, since you have proved yourself to be quite deliberate in most of your decisions I don't expect that the current policy is merely thoughtless . . . but this is one diner who would  consider you perfect if I could just make a reservation for 2 on a Thurs-Fri-Sat night between 8-10.", "author": "Jen A."}

When the food was first coming out, my first impression was that we weren't going to be full because the portions seemed a bit small.  By the 2nd course, we were already getting pretty full!  Every dish was so packed with flavor and I loved every course and every dish we had.  My husband and I both went with the 4 course meals and got different items, so we were able to try different things.  \n\nThis would have received a 5 star for it's food, but in the end it only received 4 stars because of the noise level in the restaurant and the way the service seemed rushed.  For a 4 course meal, I would have liked to enjoy it more, but it seemed after every course, even before we were finished, a waiter would come by and say \"well, the next course is coming up\" and would almost rush us to finish to make room for the next thing.

One dish was outstanding -- the Dahi Vada -- this was the first thing we got and it was fabulous.\nI also was fond of the paper dosa -- it was slightly sweet.

The shrimp curry had a smoky flavor so was a bit of a standout.\n\nHere's the thing -- if I was walking by and saw no crowd  would I stop in? maybe. The food was decent but only that first dish was \"special\". I don't think it'd be a destination spot for me, tho I thought it was decent.

We got drinks and watched people get seated. After 40 minutes we checked in and it was down to 2 ahead of us. Seemed reasonable; sure it wasn't the 25 minutes we thought but that was OK. 10 minutes later they told us there were a few tables of 3 leaving and we should be seated soon. We watched many 4 tops get seated (which was frustrating because we would clearly order as much as any 4 top and had already consumed more at the bar than those tables would in food). We check in again and they were not the least bit apologetic. We told them we were leaving (after an hour wait) and they said OK. Bye. \nUGH.

My first shock was that a glass of Torrontes, an Argentinian everyday quaffing wine was $10 by the glass. Those wines usually retail for $7-8 bucks a bottle and charging that amount for this kind of wine is really unreasonable.   If it had been $7 or $8 a glass that would be acceptable in a restaurant situation but in a tough economy and with fewer people dining out, it really upsets me to see this kind of price gauging.    The dinner was satisfying, we had the samosas, a dosa and one curry which were tasty but truly not distinctive enough to merit the prices we paid.   I realize the dosa itself is a speciality, but to me it would be better served as a street cart food for a reasonable price rather than a white tablecloth restaurant where you leave feeling a much lighter wallet.

Parking right outside - yaay!   My very first experience with Indian food, years and years ago, before the dawn of time, was a south Indian restaurant, so I am somewhat familiar with dosas.  Plus I have traveled to India.  Unfortunately, I was not overly impressed with the dosas at Dosa on Valencia....whine....maybe it was an off day?  Maybe the time?  The filling just seemed a little...bland.  I know dosas aren't spicy - but I mean it seemed just like potatoes and tumeric - I could not detect any cumin seeds, which I just love, and isn't there usually some onion sauteed in butter?.  The coconut chutney was okay, but honestly I've had somewhat better.  In fact I've made coconut chutney (and it did take a lot of experimentation to get it right) and mine is better (although it's so much work - I used a fresh coconut  and toasted chana dal - that I don't make it often)..  But I'm not saying that it was bad at all - just not spectacular.  So obviously I'm giving the place a good review anyway.  We started with the pani puri, which I have never had and thought it was really fun.  We really liked the mint cilantro water.  My husband ordered the South Indian Moon Uttapam - a selection of them.  I thought they were just great.  As for Rob - well, he liked them, but I think he prefers Northern Indian food.  Actually, I think he needs to try more South Indian items.  We also ordered raita (we just love the stuff and have to try it everywhere).  It was just fantastic.  That yogurt!  Where did they find it?  maybe they made it?  It was soooooo rich and tangy and great (especially after last week's debacle at the DREADED Amber India).\n\nThe service was really good.  We were offered a choice of sitting at the bar or at a table by a really nice guy - and then our server was really great - she had a way of being helpful without every being overbearing. For example, she asked us whether we had ever had pani puri before (no) and then showed us how to put it together.  She did this without being condescending in the least.  Later she asked whether we were familiar with the sauces (we were) and she said \"oh, great\" and left us to enjoy them.

For those of you who want to try it but don't want to wait at night, she informed us that they serve lunch on Saturday and Sunday and that there is never a wait.  She also said that the chef does some special curry for lunch that he does not do for dinner time.  Check it out.  Not for those who can't handle spicy food.", "author": "Princess P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-18", "description": "I feel about this place kind of like I feel about Ti Couz--once you are no longer enamored by the constructed exoticness of the place, there really isn't much substance left to keep bringing you back.\n\nThe food ranges from a decent rendition of South Indian food to just plain weird. I have sympathy for the chef--when you actually go to South India, most of the food there is not made with especially fresh, healthy ingredients. To make the kind of food that health-conscious San Franciscians are expecting, you need to be creative and move beyond that cuisine. All that is fine (I'm not an \"authenticity\" Nazi)--but in my opinion you should warn people what you're doing rather than surprise them with it.\n\nSo, for example, if you order a paneer dosa, you'd expect to get a dosa with a bunch of paneer and maybe some spicy potatoes (or other traditional dosa fillings) to complement the paneer. You would not expect to get a dosa filled mostly with peas (alone, not in a sauce, and \"fresh\" tasting rather than well-cooked), which, in addition to having three times the volume of the actual paneer, overwhelm the taste of the paneer. This would be fine if this were described on the menu, but it wasn't--we actually asked the waiter if we had been served the correct dish, and were surprised to find that we had (\"oh wait, maybe I taste a little paneer, behind all those peas\").\n\nThe second complaint I have is the cost--South Indian cuisine is based on very cheap ingredients, including potatoes, sometimes chickpeas, sometimes a few peas (usually well-cooked and _always_ in moderation), spices you can buy very cheaply in bulk in an Indian grocery store, etc. How they can justify charging $11 for a bunch of spiced potatoes in a crepe is beyond me. The food doesn't seem to be sufficiently refined to justify that kind of cost. Maybe it's also because the quality is generally only a small step above the run-of-the-mill dosas I've eaten in South India, where you can get one of them for something between $0.25-$1. Again--cheap ingredients.\n\n\nThree stars because, except for the surprises, the food was decent and occasionally quite flavorful. I may eventually go back simply because there aren't many South Indian options around.", "author": "Jared B."}

Great food presentation and atmosphere.  The big downer is that it doesnt take reservations for a party less than 5.  You have to wait outside and there's this bum outside that giggles and paces back and forth which can lead to a very uncomfortable pre-dinner experience.  The first time I attempted to go, a Saturday night, the hostess told me it would be about a 20 minute wait.  After an hour of watching the bum like a ping pong tournament, we got so hungry that we ended up going to the Pakistani restaurant half a block up who's name escapes me.  The second attempt on a Friday was more successful.  The bum paced for about 25 minutes before we got seated.  The Dahi Vada was beautiful and a unique dish - lentil dumplings topped with swirls of yogurt and sauces.  Lamb curry was very flavorful and different.  \n\nThe only thing that would prevent me from going there is that I don't want to have to wait an indefinite amount of time for my meal.

True to the restaurant's name, Dosas are the specialty here.  The Masala Dosa was HUGE  and we had to play musical plates with the other dishes to get the damn thing to fit on the table.  And the flavor?  Nothing short of luscious.  Really.  Make sure you dip pieces of your dosa in coconut sauce (the hummus-looking thing on the side) - it's ORGASMIC.  My friend insisted on ordering the eggplant curry, which I initially resisted because I always thought I could make it better myself, but tonight I ate my words - and yes, lots of YUMMY eggplant curry that I could never duplicate at home.  Also had their Paneer and Peas Uttampam, which was delicious as well; tasted like a cheesy Jewish latke (potato pancakes) with peas.  My only complaint was that it was a little too small for the price ($13 and it was only about the size of the dinner plate - but then again EVERYTHING looked small compared to that dosa!)  Speaking of small for the price, I would avoid the appetizers.  Unfortunately the fact that our spinach and cauliflower fritters came in a painfully small, tea-saucer size portion was enough to bring my rating of this place to 4 stars only (would include another 1/2 star if Yelp let me)\n\nSERVICE:  Superb.  Waiters are very friendly and knowledgable about the cuisine, and are helpful, NOT pushy, when making recommendations.  Water glasses were always filled in a timely manner, dishes were removed from the table almost once the food was finished from them. Dosa has a good team that's VERY on top of it here. Bravo!\n\nAMBIENCE: Classy.  As I said, this is fine dining.  Lighting is sexily dimmed, but the modern lights hanging from the ceiling give it a very warm glow that reflects nicely off the orangy-earth toned walls.  There's a full bar if you want to catch a drink while waiting for your table or after your meal.  Admittedly a little crowded as the restaurant is small, but at least there are high ceilings so that it's not stuffy.  DEFINITELY a hot date spot.\n\nPRICES: Well this ain't Naan n' Curry, so for the full experience, you should probably expect to spend about $25 - $30/person, including drinks and dessert, which is fairly reasonable for a classy restaurant.  If you're on the budget like me, however, you probably want to save this place for special occasions only. \n\nPARKING: I always recommend taking the bus in San Francisco.  However, if you have a date you need to impress with a full pick-up service and everything, you're in luck; there's a lot on 21st Street between Valencia and Mission, and there seems to usually be ample parking in there.", "author": "Catherine C."}

Udupi Palace it was! The wait was long and it was hotter than a whorehouse in hell! No way were we going to subject ourselves to eating hot Indian food in 90 degree heat, so we wandered over to Dosa which we had also heard a lot about. The ambiance was much better and it was about 15 degrees cooler in there! \nThe service was phenomenal! Our waitress was very informative and offered up some great suggestions. We opted to try the curry lamb kofta and the paneer and peas dosa. The lamb was really tasty albeit for only 5 tiny meatballs! The spices and quality of meat was definitely noted, but I had wished there were more red onion action. Don't get me wrong, the dish was filling and delightfully spicy, but not big enough to share! \nI gulped down at least 4 glasses of water, so I can attest to the service. My glass was constantly refilled without me having to wave someone over, which was much appreciated since my mouth was pretty much on fire! As for the dosa...maybe its just me, but I didn't think it was particularly spectacular....at least not to the point of being this places namesake. The crepe didn't have much flavor and the peas still had quite a bit of bite to them as if they were slightly undercooked. The sambar however was very hearty and contained big chunks of veggies which were tasty. \nAll in all this place wasn't a bust, but I doubt I'll be heading there again soon. At $60 bucks for two people, there are plenty of other Indian places to try.", "author": "Stacy T."}

It is another thing when they refused to give me a reservation a week earlier for a party of 8 for my birthday when they had no existing reservations for that day.  The hostess said that we had to come in person to give our name and party number on that day.  So, on my birthday, my hubby got home earlier than usual to put his name on the list and then came to pick us up. When we got to the restaurant we still had more time to wait.

All were good, and the presentation on the DV was notable.  The sambar was kinda boring, if I wanted to complain, and the coconut sorbet was way too sweet for my taste, but not bad.\n\nRegarding some common criticisms:\n\nFirst of all, you can count your alternatives for S. Indian on one hand.  Yes, one of the those is a hop away, but none of them fill the niche that this does.   You could go here without worrying that your date would be overdressed, and as someone who is perfectly happy eating off a thali and even appreciates something Bollywood playing up on the wall, and generally prefers typical \"ethnic\" joints for being relatively casual (and cheap) as well as relatively tasty, I very much enjoyed a more upscale, polished environment for a change.  Going here felt like a special occasion, but it was still comfortable.\n\nSecond, the food is actually pretty good.   That it is more expensive to eat here than the alternatives is no surprise.  You are paying for more than food.   And really, it isn't expensive when you consider that.  And it isn't like you are eating something from Chat Cafe, prettied up, either.  The food just wasn't mind blowing or anything.  Maybe if I'd made it to Vik's or Udupi, I'd be less forgiving, but it isn't like I haven't had better elsewhere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-11-03", "description": "I love Indian food, and when it's prepared well and with quality ingredients, there's nothing else quite like it.  So I've been thrilled the three times that I've visited Dosa - well, about the food, anyway.\n\nThe service at Dosa was very sorely lacking.  During our meal this evening, servers and hosts alike were pushy and apparently unconcerned about being obvious about their need for us to eat quickly and get the hell out, despite the fact that we were (trying to) enjoy their tasting menu, ordered two bottles of wine, and weren't being particularly slow about our food & wine consumption.  They were sloppy - placing dishes, glasses, and finally, the check on the table with apparent disregard for where they landed.  Finally, they were rude - telling us to go find our coats ourselves (\"They're over there on the hooks on the wall somewhere\") after we had paid the bill.  This is not an acceptable response from any server at any restaurant, especially given that it was the host had insisted we not hang our coats on the backs of chairs and had taken them away when we were seated.  \n\nThe server's response was unacceptable under any circumstances, but after paying a nearly $300 bill and - because we're apparently a bunch of suckers - tacking on 20% despite the frustration inducing experience, it carried extra sting.  (Note to self: Tell my bleeding heart to stfu the next time it tries to convince me that it's reasonable to tip 20% for bad service.)\n\nDosa does offer a really rather delicious, distinctive menu.  Despite my increasing frustration with the subpar server, busser and hosts, I enjoyed the potato patties, dosa, and exceptionally tender lamb curry.  The galub jamun was about as good as it could be - which is to say - fine.  On the whole, the food was quite wonderful, with the perfect balance of flavors and textures. \n\nIf you aren't put off by the overbearing din of the restaurant, the extraordinarily long wait for a table, and the amateur and - at times - \nappallingly disrespectful service, then it really is worth sucking it up a little in order to enjoy a meal here.  In fact, I think I would recommend that everyone try it at least once.  Just know what to expect.  And after you leave -- well-fed, basking in the memories of your delicious meal but fuming about the crappy service -- just remember that you don't have to go back.  \n\nI'm pretty sure I won't.", "author": "Nzinga K."}

It is one of the few in the Bay Area that serves booze. Probably the only one that serves cocktails of this calibre.  \n\nThe positives are very good service and decor. The negatives are the food and execution of the dishes. The quality of ingredients is high. Some of the appetizers like the Chennai Chicken were well done. However the rest of the meal was very mediocre for the price point and the quality of ingredients. The Tamil Lamb curry was extremely  over spiced with the wrong spices. My wife is Tamil and I am very familiar with the cuisine of south india. The Tamil Lamb Curry evoked no memories of Tamil cuisine in the spicing. The chutney served with the Dosa dish was decent but the sambar that  came with the south indian moons tasted nothing like sambar should. \n\nDosa is a great concept and for the masses  unfamiliar with South Indian cuisine it is a good introduction and  adds to the variety of cuisine in the City. \n\nHowever,  the food here is neither creative enough nor authentic enough for the prices charged.  I would expect a highly skilled chef creating great dishes given the quality ingredients and the price point and service level. What your get at Dosa can be had in many of the other south indian places in the Bay Area for far less albeit with no booze or decor.   Some how I can't help imagine that people of SF could do a lot better if Dosa's chef would tighten the execution of the dishes.\n\nUpdated to reflect the dessert: \nThe Rasmalai here is excellent.

It seemed a little chaotic inside because there were people everywhere.  It was also very loud, but I guess that is to be expected from a trendy place like this one.  Unfortunately, the place was so crowded it was almost uncomfortable.  There were a lot of people waiting outside because the restaurant is so small that there is no waiting area inside.  Pretty much every inch of space is occupied by a table.  During dinner, we shared a table with another group.  You're literally eating with other people, but it's so loud, they can't really hear what you're saying anyway even though they are sitting right next to you.  \n\nOn the upside, I really liked the decor of the place.  If you're looking for a trendy hot spot that serves good food, this is the place to go.  Just go after 9:00 PM so you won't be waiting an hour for a table.  The staff was also very friendly.  The owner apologized for the long wait and looked like he was very involved in helping the staff get things moving.

Its a tighter dosa that makes it almost burrito'ish. Some Dosas are a little thinner than others and some a little crunchier. The chutneys are amazing (we even got a mint chutney for fun for only some chump change extra). If you end up with extra chutney, I recommend loading them all up into the left over Sambar (lentil soup) and topping your meal off with something spicy.

It's a great place to eat if you don't care about food.  Otherwise, the food is sophmoric and just plain bad.  Try the chick pea appetizer if you doubt.

So we sat down and I tried to be understanding of all the mission hipsters and non-Indians who were all dressed up and having the red AND white wine pairings with their meal.

During the meal I joked with my mother and told her that I was going to buy her a gift certificate to Dosa for Christmas and her response was I would die.

I was ready to strip naked and offer myself up to whoever they have cooking that crazy crazy indian grub. The food was so new and exciting, the spices so rich and layered, the delicate dosas so light and smooth. When Autumn neglects a glass of champagne through an entire meal, it's a pretty good indication that the food is out of this world. We arrived at 5:20 and were turned away til 5:30. Went next door. Came back at 5:31 and there were only about 4 tables LEFT in the cozy, gently-lit dining room. PartyBot and I always have leftovers but as soon as that food started coming, it was every man for himself. I had that Spring Dosa divided and conquered so fast, Party didn't even see me sneaking a little extra for myself. The onion pakora and it's divine dipping sauce was more or less inhaled and I tell you, if I could get that in a drip feed, I wouldn't hesitate. The highlight of the meal was the Niman Ranch lamb curry, worth every last penny ($16). The sauce was like a mole with asian flourishes. Oh I ate it every way but dirty: On rice (delicious!), on rice scooped up with the crispity-crunchety pappadam that they give you loads of, by itself, on my dosa, and yes, with my fingers. I licked every last drop off of my plate and would have finished off the whole thing had I not begun to sport an early-pregnancy belly from overindulging.

While there were some glaring exceptions (no yogurt rice! no pickle! no idli!) from the menu, the food overall was good.  The rasam (which they served as soup) was so spicy that some tamilian friends of mine at the next table over called it \"Too Authentic.\"  I personally found the sambar (with either the capcicum or the okra) to be a better choice either as a starter or as a dipping sauce.  The dosas were better than the uttapam (which I think is still attempting to fit into the western style eating mode, instead of the indian style \"Tiffin\" mode.  Just as an aside, I love that all these sort of super-casual home foods are getting such american love because of their novelty.  It would be like an american restaurant opening serving like hot dogs and rice krispies - the stuff your mom makes for snacks :).   \nBut I digress.  The food came out prompty, and was served hot - and while the uttapam wasn't spicy, the masala dosa was.  The desserts were excellent and hopefully the other items on the menu will not disappoint.  A recommendation (especially to the carnivores): south indian food is vegetarian, as a general rule we are orthodox and veg.  so unless you are really unable to do without the meat stuff, try giving up the flesh for a night, you won't be disappointed.\n\nMy two complaints:  I ordered Dahi Vada, and since i've never actually heard a white person say this, i didn't know how to \"White-ify\" the pronounciation... and the waitress didn't understand me!  I had to point!  Second, someone else's order came to the table.

However, on a Friday night around 10:30, Sonia and I were in dire need of food and drink, so without straying too far from my apartment, we found ourselves sitting at the bar at Dosa, happily ordering whatever was left in the kitchen before it closed for the night. This upscale and trendy Valencia street restaurant is beautifully decorated with lights and mirrors. We were attended to by the bartender, who immediately took our order (the dosa appetizer and heirloom tomato salad with crispy noodles and coconut milk). I was taken aback at the care that went into crafting the dishes when they arrived. Each plate looked like a piece of artwork, almost too pretty to eat (although I somehow managed to lick my plate clean). The appetizer consisted of two thin pancakes (dosas) filled with a mixture of vegetables and paneer cheese. To finish off the plate were a smattering of different sauces, neatly dotted on the plate almost like an artists palate.  This stuffed creation tasted quite good, I was pleasantly surprised- the flavors were not as overpowering as I find in some Indian dishes. The heirloom tomato salad was also delicious- I particularly enjoyed the crunchy noodles and coconut sauce at the bottom. Both of these dishes were completely different than any other Indian food I've ever tasted (more refined perhaps) and I would definitely go back to sample some of their main course meals (late at night though, as I've seen this place packed around dinner time).", "author": "Kate A."}

It didn't hit me until I went to this place just how Northern the Indian restaurants around SF tend to be. In Boston the Indian restaurant scene was a little more pan-Indian; even the Punjabi cafe served dosas. But then I realized, whoah, I've really been missing out on the mustard seed, the coconut, the lighter vegetarian focus of South Indian cuisine. And of course.. dosas! They were fantastic! Day-old rat ass would taste exquisite if you wrapped it in one of these and dipped it in sambhar. We also tried some of the curries, which were rather intensively spiced with masala but we found delicious. I suppose paying $10 for a crepe could seem a little ridiculous, but when you look at it as a restaurant experience, and consider how well everything is executed, and the friendly and professional service, it's really a great value. You may have to wait a bit at the bar for a table, but this was a blessing in disguise as it gave me the opportunity to try my first Indian wine -- a Shiraz from Sula Vineyards that was quite good.", "author": "Tom L."}

Then, you filled it with home-grown mung beans, some mashed potatoes, and garbanzo beans. Top that off by pouring in some tamarind sauce and spicy cilantro water. Eat it in one bite. My god.. MOUTH PARTY!!!!! The flavors all mixed together in a most powerful fashion. Delightful taste sensation. On the side we had the Indian scrambled eggs, which were very light and flavorful. Perfect scrambled egg texture. Then, we had the paper dosa. Humongous! We split it between 3 people and there was enough for everyone. The paper dosa came with potatoes and chestnuts, and on the side were coconut chutney and some other kind of sauce. The dosa was crispy and light. The only thing was that the coconut could have been more coconuttie (I am, however, obsessed with coconut, so nothing can ever have enough coconut for me!)

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-17", "description": "Being of South Indian descent, I feel pretty comfortable commenting on Dosa.  Typically, outside of the South Bay, North Indian restaurants outnumber South Indian ones by at least 10:1.  And usually the South Indian restaurants that exist are cheap (read: poor ambience/bad service/generally ghetto), vegetarian and only cater to Indians.  As such, Dosa is a breath of fresh air and really destroys all of the stereotypes generally attributed to South Indian restaurants --- plus it's in SF.  I've been 4 times and have really enjoyed my experiences each and every time.  For apps, I'm a big fan of the dahi vada.  The vada is crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside and probably as well-presented as I've ever seen the dish, even in India.  The accompanying yogurt and chutneys match well with the vada.  I don't really care for the Chennai chicken --- it's a little too greasy and flavorless.  The sada paper dosa is my favorite dosa.  Even my mom, who is universally considered the best dosa cook in my hometown, really likes them.  The sada paper is buttery and crispy and perfect for dipping in sambar and chutney.  I don't really care for masala-filled dosas but everyone I've been to the restaurant with seems to like them.  I really like the channa bhatura as well.  It's pretty rare to find a restaurant that serves good bhatura.  Also, Dosa's plates are actually big enough to hold the bhatura, which is a big plus in my book.  Once upon a time, I went to Vik's and was utterly disgusted to see some woman eating her bhatura directly off the nasty table.  (Btw, do any Indian people actually like Vik's?  I think that place is perhaps the most overrated Indian restaurant ever.  I understand it's cheap, but it's also disgusting.  The quality has seriously gone down hill in the last 5 years or so.)  Anyway... Dosa also has some quality meat dishes.  The tamil lamb curry is great.  It's a little greasy, but very tasty and one of the better South Indian meat dishes I've had in a while.  The prawn coconut masala is pretty good too.  The restaurant also has a good selection of beer and sake cocktails.  Overall, I'm a big fan of the restaurant, but the lack of a reservation policy bugs me (actually, I think they may take them for parties of 5 or more).  I would definitely go more often if they took reservations.  Also, the restaurant is a little cramped with the tables being set pretty close to each other.", "author": "Saw T."}

Traumatized not by what we'd eaten, which was delicious, but by the service, which, from the moment we arrived, was officious, aggressive, impatient, and just plain rude. I will refrain from firing up my own hostile jets again this morning by enumerating each and every moment we felt rushed, when we had to snatch back our plates from the eager bussers, when our waitress checked back in to find out what else we wanted to order, if we were done, if we liked it, and so on. WHen the owner accidentally put a bill on our table before we had even been served the dessert we had ordered, I was appalled but not surprised. It turned out he had mistaken us for another table. Okay. But the last straw came as we were leaving: the host, seeing us moving toward the door through the narrow passage between bar stool diners and table diners, ordered us to WAIT while he brought a group of 7 or 8 folks into the restaurant to seat them. Huh? Isn't it basic etiquette that you allow the person who is leaving right of way? Apparently the rush to make a profit at Dosa is SO dramatic that pummeling diners with an army of aggressive servers, and then expecting them to pause in their flight from such punishment is simply how business is done. \nI feel sad.

What was he talking about? It's not a perception it's real. If he shut his mouth, it would better. Our bad experience didn't stop there, the waitress wasn't very attentive.

Probably because they only have about two tables in the whole place capable of seating five, and the place was PACKED on a Wednesday night. But, I was in a good mood, so we just sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited. When we finally got seated and ordered, all of the food was fucking awesome. All of it.

I ordered the Onion Rava Dosa (dosa made with caramelized red and yellow onions), expecting it to be slightly sweetened by the aforementioned caramelized onions, but the dosa was neither sweet or especially flavorful.  What's the point of onions if they don't accentuate the flavor of the underlying food???  In addition to lacking much flavor, due to the onions in the mixture, the dosa was rather firm and filled with holes where the batter didn't fill in the gaps making it extremely difficult to use the dosa for actually gathering the lentil mixture or chutneys.  One last note, the lentil mixture was overcooked.  Ok, so you get the point about the food.  The service was generally good, if not a bit overbearing.

Now I am not one who ordinarily needs a lot of coddling by restaurants, but if you keep us waiting 45 minutes when we had a long standing reservation, you could at least offer us an apology or a round of drinks or appetizer or something.  Instead, it wasn't even acknowledged - it seemed to be treated as fairly standard (which based on the fact that it's happened to me before is perhaps actually the case).

While it's not so much as to label this place as a \"fusion\" restaurant, since it serves indian food at it's core, it still is nice to see innovation that looks and tastes great.  Everything is really well thought out and balanced in terms of spice, which is nice from the usual \"GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER NOW\" kind of feeling I get from going to most other Indian places.  While it's certainly not as cheap as your usual Indian place, I beg you to at least taste what Indian food can be like when its dressed up and refined.", "author": "Patrick C."}

The first time, I thought it was the best food I've ever eaten - so unusual, different from Indian food you are used to.  Now, after sampling half of the menu, I have to admit - almost everything tastes the same.  All of the dosas seem to be essentially the same - be it masala or lentils, the different varieties of dumplings, you name it, kinda tastes the same.  But that same is DELICIOUS.

We had 2 kinds of dosa, vadas, lamb curry, and some prawn dish. It was a while back, so my memory is not absolutely clear about the names or specifics. What really, really stuck out was the lamb curry. It was a fairly dry curry with so much flavor. The lamb was incredibly tender, probably the most tender meat that I have ever had. And it tasted like lamb. I often find myself a bit dissappointed by lamb because so many restaurants choose to serve very mild lamb that tastes as much like beef as lamb. It's a very crowded place, they don't take reservations as a rule, and the wait was about an hour. So that could be annoying, but I think it was well worth it. There are plenty of bars nearby. Speaking of drinks, do try the lychee soju.", "author": "Vernon S."}

The space is small but never feels cramped due to a thoughtful space plan, although it does get a little too warm at the back of the restaurant. Service is friendly and helpful all around, from the hostesses to the servers to the busboys, an achievement few restaurants can claim. Another nice touch is Dosa's wine list, which is much more varied and unique than the offerings at most Indian restaurants I've been to. The menu has a good array of choices and makes nice use of fresh local ingredients. The spring dosa was good although not as fabulous as we'd expected, but the prawn coconut curry was delightfully sweet and spicy with a generous amount of prawns. While I think that Dosa is a good value considering the quality of ingredients and overall atmosphere, I'm not sure I agree with the Chronicle's designation of Dosa as a \"Bargain Bite\" unless you only order one dish and a glass of tap water.", "author": "Heather F."}

As for the food, the size of the dosa divided the opinions of our group ( thrilling or goofy) but everyone agreed that they were  a bit hard to eat in that form (somehow I remember them as being smaller in India or more manageable in India.)\\. The dosa's flavors, definitely unlike those in India,  were flat and ponderous. I am not sure if it was the result of less than fresh ingredients, overcooking or simply ineptitude about spices.

The pakoras (which are fried onions in cheapea flour) were tasty and spicy. We ordered the masala dosa and we liked our food. The wine we ordered was good but we were amazed at the half empty glasses served at $7.50....per glass.\r\nWe then ordered the Goulab Jamum for dessert and what a let down, they were falling apart and did not taste good at all. The owner came to our table to apologize for that but did not take it off our tab which we would expect if the owner himself feels that they were soaking too long in the syrup.\r\nWe were overall satisfied with the place and would go back since we love dosa and don't have to wait until we are in Berkeley or South Bay but it is a bit pricy compared to other South Indian restaurant.", "author": "Bianca R."}

Since she didn't like the Dosa we shared in San Jose back when we started dating, I took the opportunity of her absence to make a long-anticipated Sunday lunchtime trip to Dosa. Since it was Sunday, I found a yellow-topped meter right out front, parked, and walked in to a fairly busy place. The bar was empty and comfortable - perfect for dining solo. I knew I wanted the standard Dosa (Dosa Masala), but wasn't sure what to get as a starter. I asked the bartender, and she recommended the Pani Puri. She showed me how to crack open the fried puri and demo'd how to make one by starting with the most dense fillings (potato) first, then filling up with the tamarind and mint \"water\". She was very helpful and friendly. The Dosa Masala arrived and the crepe-like shell was larger than the plate! The filling was tasty, and the lentil soup and other sauces were really tasty. My only complaint was that the filling was probably only in just over 1/2 of the dosa, and I re-spread it around inside to avoid too much empty shell (tho that was nice for dipping in the sauces as well).

We knew nothing of its reputation, so entered with no expectations - good or bad.  The space is warm, if a bit pretentious.  The menu is comprised of very basic Indian dishes, yet is presented, both in the menu and by the staff, with an air that reeks of condescension.\n\nWhen we entered, the dining room was less than a third full.  Yet, it took our waitress nearly 20 minutes to make her way to our table.  We ordered drinks, the fire broth, sunny side up eggs uttapam, and chatni masala dosa.\n\nAfter another 15 minutes our drinks came.  Following a lengthy discussion on how good they weren't, our food finally arrived.\n\nThe soup and dosa were both inoffensive, if a bit coarsely seasoned.  However, the \"sunny side up\" eggs were raw.  I like my eggs runnier than most and would gladly take underdone eggs to overcooked ones.  We were ultimately treated to both at Dosa.   Now when I say raw, I mean RAW.  The whites looked like a pool of translucent snot.  Literally.  Translucent.  Snot.  When we were finally able to flag down our waitress (no small feat, I assure you), she advised us that \"that is the way you ordered them.  You said 'sunny side up' and that's the way they're cooked.\"  She apparently missed the point that they were not cooked.  She tapped my girlfriend on the arm, and said with a great deal of presumptive condescension, \"I'm just letting you know how to order for the next time.\"  Her tone and demeanor clearly expressed her belief that we knew nothing about the food we were ordering.  (I should mention here, I am a former professional chef of several years).  However, this was not haute cuisine.  This was not even ethnic cuisine.  This was a sunny-side up egg.  There's no requirement for a refined palate in this instance.  It's an egg.  You put in a frying pan.  You COOK it. \n\nFinally, after she continued arguing with us and refusing to acknowledge that the egg was uncooked, I ran my finger through the translucent snot, at which point she picked up the plate and clearly annoyed, said she would fix it.  The plate returned a few minutes later, with the same eggs that were now completely overcooked with a burnt crispy bottom and hard yolks.   \n\nFor this splendid feast, we were set back a mere 40+ dollars.  I would have been much more fulfilled and less annoyed had I handed the money to a stranger on the street.\n_____________________________________________\n\nI received a prompt and very kind response to my above post from who I presume to be the owner of the restaurant.  He apologized for our experience and asked when we were in so that he could address the our issues with his staff.  I was rather impressed by his timely action and raised my original rating by a star on account of this alone.", "author": "Michael G."}

I apologize that your experience wasn't everything you expected it to be!  Since your review is read by thousands of people I do want to comment and clarify on a few things you've said. \n\n- Our prices are comparable to (or less than) other full-service restaurants in the Mission such as Delfina, Range, Foreign Cinema, Garcon, Beretta, etc.   \n- We use organic and natural ingredients wherever we can and make everything fresh daily.   You might not be able to taste it but you were definitely eating healthier food that you would find in a $15 / meal place, especially if you're eating fish. (We get our fish from the same vendors as Gary Danko.  As a matter of fact, I'd be concerned if I were paying $15 for a plate of fish! :-)) \n- You can walk away from Dosa with a great meal for about $20 or $25.  It depends on the food & wines you order :-), which brings me to my next point! \n- We ALWAYS pump the air out of our wines and store them in our coolers overnight (including reds) to preserve the wine.  ANY good restaurant should do that since the air oxidizes the wine.  I don't believe you will find a single restaurant that dumps all their wine overnight.  Considering we serve about 6,000 customers a week, 7 days weeks, our wines never last for more than a day!  The Malbec is a popular wine for us. You were probably tasting the casis, spice and smoky notes of the wine which is exactly the reason why some people like it and, of course, some people don't ! :-) \n\nI hope you do come see us again whether or not it's on a date! \n\nKind regards, \n\nAnjan \n(one of the owners)\"\n\n\ni gave dosa 3 stars in my initial review, i think these guys take themselves just a bit too serious. i considered dropping the rating to two stars after i was told that i know nothing of fish or wine in a poor attempt at convincing me to revise or retract my non-5-star review, but a message through yelp shouldn't alter the experience i had and the review of it.", "author": "Ameer N."}

The food was tasty, as usual, though I missed the entire reason for coming to Dosa, which was the lamb curry, which was no longer on the menu.  The server tried to convince me that the lamb kofka (meatballs) were the same thing, so we ordered that instead.  While tasty, they weren't even on the same level as the lamb curry, not even close, so I felt misled by our server.  In addition, I wish they would leave the \"fine dining\" experience (i.e. the four course menu and wine pairing) for their Fillmore location, and go back to being a great neighborhood restaurant, like they used to be.  They are good enough to ride on the yumminess of their food, and the fact that South Indian restaurants are virtually non-existent, they don't need to aspire to be something greater.", "author": "Reyna J."}

I went on a Sunday afternoon so it wasnt exactly a full house either.  We were seated promptly but werent even given water until right before the appetizer came out.  And speaking of the appetizer, we werent told how to eat it until we had to ask.  The waitress gave definite attitude and was less than helpful because we werent ready the first time she came to take our order.  And its not that we were taking our sweet time, its a very interesting menu full of dishes that I had no experience with prior to Dosa.  So needless to say I didnt feel that the 'tude was neccesary.  We ordered the Paneer Dosa and the Spring Uttapam.  We also tried the Fire Broth soup and the Pani Puri.  Everything was packed with such flavor and just exploded in our mouths.  I've been talking about Dosa all week and would recommend it to anyone that is open to new flavors and can appreciate the art of cuisine.  I will even give it a second try to earn back that lost 5th star! :)", "author": "J L."}

I came in a party of 4, and we came at 7:15, so were prepared to have a wait.  The issue I had was that we were told upon arriving that the wait would be 30-40 minutes, so we grabbed the only seat at the bar (way too small) and ordered some drinks.  An hour later, the bar tender asked us to order more drinks or appetizers, seemingly implying we were taking up space and not putting down enough cash.  We ended up waiting an 1 1/2 hours, and I thought the host should have given a more realistic wait time.  The atmosphere was ok - small tables with club music in the background.  The food was good, especially the mung bean salad and Kerala Chicken.  The dosas were good, but I prefer them less buttery and with the potatoes inside, not on the side.   We specifically asked for the food to be spicy, and it was not at all, even with three of my party being Indian.  My boyfriend even asked for a plate of chilis, which they brought, but they were diced and had the seeds removed, so they were not spicy either...   The coconut sorbet was delicious and a huge portion, easily serving two.  It was a good meal, but just an ok dining experience.  We'll be back, but earlier or not on a weekend.", "author": "Leslie R."}

My owna ordered the chicken curry special (not on menu), it was the special of the day and it rocked...the chicken was flavorful thru and thru and the breaded parati was incredible...melt in your mouth!  I ordered a mynsa dosa which was a potatoe-lentil filled crispy pancake wrap; ohmawgawd, talk about delicous...dip it in the tamarind and mint sauce and proceed to devour.

Tonight I went with a party of eight for my sister's birthday this week and the food was fabulous as always, but the experience could have been better.  The waitress came by, told us about the special and recommended the $39 per person four course dinner for a party of our size.  We weren't really interested in dessert, so we decided to order from the menu and eat family style.  Normally when I go there the food comes out in courses, starters first, then dosa and uttapam, then curries.  I don't know if they wanted to hurry us up or what, but we got bombed with food.  The dishes came fast and furious, and we spent most of the meal passing things around and couldn't really talk or socialize.

I am South Indian and am amazed that any other South Indian person could approve of the food here.   I would have much less of an issue if the place said it was \"inspired\" by South Indian flavors, but to call it an authentic South Indian restaurant is insane; all you need to do is take one trip there to realize immediately that this crap is not served in real Indian restaurants.\n\nTHE SERVICE: we showed up at 9:30 pm on a Friday night.  To Dosa's credit, a twenty minute wait meant a twenty minute wait; however, that was the only thing that went right.  The bartender clearly gave preference to the white people seated at the bar, serving and paying attention to white patrons who clearly arrived after I did.  When he finally came around to me, I asked loudly and clearly for the drinks menu; he returned with the food menu.  It took literally 10 minutes to get his attention, all the while being completely ignored by the useless barback.  He seemed annoyed when I asked for the correct menu and didn't come back for another 10 minutes.  Just as he was done pouring our drinks, the hostess came to seat us.  She was forced to wait on us while rudy mcrudetender took his time closing our bar tab.  The drink, by the way, was the pomegranate garnet and it tasted like Strawberry Shortcake had vomited into my glass.\n\nTHE MENU: appalling.  First of all, I can't believe this place can get away with serving heavily overpriced breakfast food as somewhat classy dinner food.  Secondly, none of the \"curries\" on the menu are  authentic -- I dare anyone to tell me when they've seen such dishes on mom's table, in the way that Dosa prepares them.  The salad and soups section is hilarious -- we don't eat that stuff in India, at least not in the western sense of the words.  Give me cucumber pachadi any day.\n\nTHE FOOD: I ordered the mung sprouts salad, rava masala dosa, and salty lassi.  The salad was fine, just not authentic.  The dosa was ... disappointing at best.  Nice and thin, but soggy rather than crispy.  The masala, rather than being stuffed in the center, was underneath the tri-fold of dosa -- how the hell was I supposed to reach it without making a mess? I was expecting at least some delicious coconut chutney and perhaps coriander chutney.  What I got were some strange tomato (?) chutney that I've never seen on a South Indian table, and a garlicky, runny version of coconut chutney.  The lassi was terrible -- more sweet than salty, and with strange spices that I've only ever tasted in North Indian versions of lassi.\n\nTHE LANGUAGE BARRIER: imagine, a South Indian having a language barrier at a South Indian restaurant?? Well, that's what you get from the awkward kurti-laden servers at Dosa.  I had to resort to hideously Americanized pronunciations (it's not Lassy the dog, people!) and had to endure a night full of hearing these girls take requests for \"doe-sah\" and \"oo-tah-pom.\" ugh.\n\nI would rather make the trek down to the south bay for real dinner (rassam, more kozhambu, bisi bele bath, etc.) or authentic breakfast food than ever set foot in Dosa again. \n\nI would never, ever bring my parents to eat here if they visited.
