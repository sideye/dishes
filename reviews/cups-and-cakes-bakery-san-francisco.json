Not gonna lie, I was put in charge of my boss mans baby shower. And I might've immediately connected booze with cake for the situation. Did some quick searching thru Yelp, and landed on Cups and Cakes. \n\nBoy o boy did they do a superb job! I initially called a few wks ahead to get a general quote for the price of the cake. It seemed super reasonable for the type of cake + amt of labor and design as compared to Susiecakes or something similar. Anyways, I placed the order by calling in. Wanted to make sure they were understanding the whiskey booze request flowing thru the cake haha\n\nLet's just say the boss and the rest of the team were very excited about the cake. Cups and Cakes went above and beyond to make an amazing cake. Major, major props to the team. LOVED the \"bottoms up\" add-on as well! 5 stars :)", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Also, terrible customer service, and poor organization on their end. If you need details, keep on reading.\n\nI was in need of a dairy-free cake, and sadly there aren't too many options out there. My search led me to their website, which seemed so promising. 2 weeks before the event, I placed an order online, and did not receive any confirmation. I sent them an email (per the instructions on their website if no confirmation was provided) - no response. I called, and finally got a response. Order was placed, and I was charged.\nThe day of the event, and no delivery. I call them wondering if perhaps their driver is running late, and find out that they had the delivery date slated for the next day. I checked my email, and it was not a mistake in my communications. Flustered, I ask them if there's any way they can get a cake to me before 3pm (delivery was supposed to be noon). They didn't say no, but said they would call me back. I waited for 30 mins or so, no return call. After one final call, they said they couldn't make 3pm. \nI asked for a refund, which they said yes to. Refund did not happen (~$80 for the cake + delivery), my follow-up calls weren't answered, and I left messages for them, no response.

After they did an amazing job for my wedding a few years ago, Cups and Cakes has been my go-to for Valentine's Day and birthday deliveries, and pick-up for parties and other occasions.\n\nI placed an order for a 1/2 dozen sampler the day before I wanted it delivered. I received the automated order reply but no confirmation, invoice, or anything else.\n\nSince I never heard from them I have been calling since they opened to try to get a hold of someone to see what happened. No one is even answering the phone.\n\nI was really looking forward to sending my friend cupcakes for his birthday. If they can't even pick up a phone to confirm or cancel a small order like this one (or heck, change their outgoing voicemail message to say they aren't open if they aren't open), I don't think I can trust them again for bigger occasions in the future. Oh well.\n\nUpdate: I received a private message from the account belonging to the owner of this bakery within about 3 minutes of posting this review, stating that the owner was in the hospital. That's very unfortunate and I hope she gets better soon. That said, I find it odd that whoever sent me the message was available to respond to a negative review almost immediately, but not to answer a phone, send an email, or change a voicemail greeting to reflect that they were closed and unable to fill orders.", "author": "Tierney H."}

But after today you know what they lost that chance to have my business $$ there.\nI came here ordered edible photos on white chocolate so I could stick them on cupcakes. I ordered a day in advance came the next day waited hours. This was for a very important party. When I finally came to pick them up they were  trash I was surprise the fact that the woman who claim to be the owner presented it!!!! (pictures speak louder see my posted photos) the reason why I'm giving them a one star is because she presented a one-year-old's work and then try to blame it on putting on the chocolate no honey your printer didn't work correctly on printing out those photos PERIOD! It had nothing to do with the chocolate. She had two other (young teen/Fam) girls in there that were completely rude (my friend had to put them in check) they had stinky faces from when I walked in not only that they were giving me the stink look. The lady who claim to be the owner was super nice HOWEVER, it seem like she didn't even care. she knew that it was shiitt.y work yet she still presented it to me that's what disappoints me tremendously. Long story short she gave me a refund but kept the chocolates like after wasting my time you should at least let me keep the edible pictures and give me a refund so I wouldn't have to leave such a bad yelp review. Unfortunately, this is what it comes down to I've attached photos THEY SPEAK FOR Their selves. This woman wants to continue her business being 4 star than she needs to seriously put the young women that are working for her in line. Teach them professionalism even if the guest is wild. It's too bad she didn't try to fix the situation she should've said \"I'm sorry you can take those I'll give you a refund I hope you can give us another chance to do business with you\" but instead then she just gave me refunded took the chocolate edible photos!!????

As someone who has experience working with customers to increase satisfaction, it's rude to use CAPS for emphasis. I get the concept of cakes in cups but if the idea doesn't work well for consumers then it's something to take into consideration like find a way grease the cups, add more moisture to the batter to make it easier to remove, or put a notch on the liner so it's easy to tear.

I needed to get a cake or some cupcakes for my friend's birthday, the barriers were that 1) she is vegan and 2) I am a horrible planner, so I didn't think to order any or find a bakery that could make vegan cake until the day of the party. I called 4 different places on the morning of the party and this shop was the only place where the phone was answered, which was incredibly serendipitous because of what followed. I asked about the possibility of them having some vegan cupcakes in stock that I could reserve and pick up that evening, but was told that they usually only have vegan and gluten free options available on Friday, alas, it was Thursday. \n\nThe owner immediately offered to bake a special batch of vegan cupcakes just for me because it was my friend's birthday, allowed me to select the flavor and waived any extra charges due to the special order. I ordered 1/2 dozen vegan chocolate mini-cupcakes and a mixed batch of 1/2 dozen standard mini-cupcakes of her choosing, even though she would have let me pick out my own if I wanted.  When I arrived, the batch of special made cupcakes (upgraded to regular size even though I only paid for mini) were finishing being cooled and awaiting their frosting, so we chatted for a few minutes while she beautifully frosted the cupcakes and let me pick out sprinkles. I also got a bonus cupcake to sample while I waited. It was awesome. Then the owner brought out some birthday candles for me to adorn my cupcake(s). \n\nI brought to cupcakes to my friend's house (birthday girl) and she was really touched by the fact I got her the vegan cupcakes and they looked so pretty. I ended up eating two, one chocolate and one blueberry. The blueberry was one of the best deserts I've had recently, full of plump juicy blueberries with cream cheese frosting. Everybody else in my group loved their cupcakes too. The owner was super friendly, went out of her way to make my unique order happen, and was generally a pleasure interacting with her.

I finally settled on a Mexican chocolate cupcake and a vegan pumpkin cupcake.

The pumpkin cupcake was nice and moist however I couldn't really get down with the vegan icing (there was something off about it to me). Here's the lowdown:\n\nLikes:\n-they have happy hour (buy one/get one free) on the weekends after 3pm\n-variety of cupcake options that varies in flavor (check out their website for daily/weekly cupcake flavors) \n-plenty of street parking nearby (I was able to drive up and pop in easy)\n\nDislikes:\n-didn't particularly care for the icing (a bit off/too oily for my taste)\n-not too close to BART (although close to a Muni line) \n-cake portion may be a bit dry, depending on the time of day you go\n\nOverall, not bad at all and another option I have when in need of a cupcake fix.", "author": "Tracy T."}

Once you enter, the first thing you will notice is that you have walked straight into their kitchen. But there's no point in eyeballing the whole joint, the magic is right in front of you. Inside the glass display, there are large cupcakes in crazy mixed flavors. Obviously trying all of them ($3.25 each) is humanly impossible for both my stomach and my wallet, so I decided to browse on and noticed that they had mini cupcakes ($2.15 each)! \n\nAfter a long debate, Blueberry Cheesecake, Red Velvet and the Pecan mini cupcake was finally chosen. All cakes were really moist and the frosting was slightly under my sweetness level radar. The Pecan had a very sticky and thick texture that I wasn't too much of a fan of. The pecan's were large in size compared to the cupcake as well.\n\nOverall, my sweet tooth was satisfied today, and all I had was two mini cupcakes!", "author": "Linda K."}

My personal favorite is a traditional chocolate chocolate but all the other flavors I've tried (lemon, pretty pretty princess, strawberry, mexican hot chocolate) didn't disappoint either. The cake is always super moist, dense, and well flavored. You can definitely tell the cake is made from scratch and not a box. As for the frosting, they're definitely on point for flavor and i love the lightness that using soy etc gives the frosting, it is never sickly sweet like a lot of frostings are. The staff is also always super nice and willing to help make suggestions and take special orders given advance notice. As for pricing, they seem on par with other cupcake shops.

I had visitors coming into town and wanted to celebrate friend's birthday by picking up some cupcakes. My old go-to spot recently shut down so I found Cups And Cakes on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I ordered had a dozen red velvet cupcakes online. Fairly simple process. For those of you who are curious, you submit a form with your request online and will receive an invoice within 24 hours. \n\nI picked up the cupcakes and the owner was there to do the hand off. She is so sweet and I'm so mad I didn't catch her name. We started chatting and I told her about my visitors and friend's birthday and she graciously threw in a few more cupcakes of a different flavors (peppermint). The cupcakes looked gorgeous and we're green and festive for St. Patrick's day. Ugh I'm so mad I did this but I had to try one before the birthday celebration. Sue me! I couldn't help myself gahhhhhh but she was kind enough to give me a few cupcakes for free so technically I didn't do anything wrong, right? So I basically stuffed the whole red velvet cupcakes in my mouth and OMG IT WAS SO GOOD. Fresh and delicious. The cupcake wasn't dry and was perfectly most. The butter cream is to die for. I can't believe I'm even saying this because I don't even like red velvet at all- so that's gotta mean something! Cups And Cakes has converted me to into a red velvet cupcake fan. My husband will be so happy. He'll be in disbelief, but will definitely be happy :)\n\nI'm looking forward to picking up more treats. Oh and best part! They're dog friendly :) the owner said she even makes puppy cupcakes on Saturdays. Gluten-free and wheat-free. We will be back next Saturday!!", "author": "Monica T."}

I am one of those people. I scrape it off if I can't handle it. But a cupcake isn't a cupcake if it doesn't have that crowning glory.\n\nPrice -- $2.75 for basic and $3.25 for ones with filling inside. (Mini bites are $1.75 - $2 each)  for the quality you get, the price is right.\n\nIncentive -- if you recycle your box on your next visit, you get a free mini bite. \n\nVariety -- from the margarita cupcake to the maple bacon one, this place has something for everyone.\n\nIf it wasn't for the little flying insects that I saw in the display case (it was a warm day) this place would've definitely gotten 5 stars.", "author": "Janice C."}

The decor is adorable, the ladies working were sweet (ideal and awesome temperament for a cupcake place) and the displays and variety of cupcakes were unique - Pancake breakfast (maple frosting with bacon on top), Thai Tea (Vegan), Double dark chocolate, Birthday cake (vanilla cake with chocolate frosting and sprinkle balls), Luscious vanilla, Rich red velvet and more.\n\nI opted for something simple - Birthday cake which consists of vanilla cake batter with a chocolate frosting and a dash of colorful sprinkle balls.  In my opinion - if you have the basics down with cupcakes - you got it going on - and I'll venture for a crazy flavor next time.\n\nUnfortunately I was let down. The frosting had a great texture and was just the right amount of sweet - which was awesome...BUT the cake part was dry and crumbly (not in a good way) and rather flavorless.

Not like you're a bother.\n\nI should had read the reviews a little better before ordering. Sorry, my mistake.\n\nThe boyfriend had a very specific request for his birthday cake. Yellow cake with chocolate frosting. With all of the fancy places, where was I going to find something that simple?? I thought I found it at Cups and Cakes. They had the exact cake I wanted, and it was even called \"The Birthday Cake.\" Exactly that - yellow cake with chocolate frosting with rainbow sprinkles!\n\nI went back and forth whether I should get the XXL cupcake or the 4 layer cake. I thought the XXL cupcake was funny, but the 4 layer cake sounded more delicious. Thinking that we are adults, let's go for taste over laughs. It was expensive, but I figured what the hell... it's his birthday, and I'm sure it'll be great.\n\nI went to go pick up the cake, there's plenty of parking on the block, which was great. I get to the door, and I try to open the door.. and it wouldn't open. I looked at the sign, it says \"OPEN\" ....so I knock on the door. Nothing. I look in the window and there are people in there. So I give it a big push, and it opens. \n\nThe woman behind the counter looks annoyed... like I was stupid I couldn't open the door and (as others say) don't make eye contact and says \"let me know when you're ready.\" in a barely audible voice. I tell her I placed an order. She says \"Name?\" I tell her. And she gets the cake, puts it on the counter, and walks away. \n\nI forgot I had paid online... so I said \"Oh yeah, I paid already...\" and she said \"yeah...\" ...and that was it. There was no, \"Thanks for coming in\" or even a \"Have a nice day.\" \n\nI look down at my cake and it is TINY. Again, my mistake - it said it fed 4 people, and it literally had 4 slices to it - cut it into quarters, and there's your cake. I paid $40 for this TINY ass cake. And there were no rainbow sprinkles as promised!\n\nI left there thinking \"This better be a damned good cake!\" \n\n...The cake was... meh. The chocolate frosting seemed very high quality and rich, but the richness made it way too much as a 4 layer cake. The yellow cake was dry. \n\nNever again. \n\nSeriously woman, it's not even a matter of customer service. Get some social skills. Basic human manners. \n\nTerrible.", "author": "Bonnie H."}

The strawberry would have been perfect if it had a bit of tartness, rather than the artificial strawberry flavor.\n\nHowever: the cream cheese frosting has a distinct taste (and isn't as sweet as the others), and the meringue frosting is AMAZING.

It seems like a cute concept to make the cupcake liners in those little cups thingies but its very hard to eat the cupcake from them. Because you have to rip off the cup and its not easy to do either without making a huge mess. \n\nThe space is very small as well probably a max capacity of 4 before the fire department comes and shuts the place down for having too many people. I am not too picky about customer service in bakeries places but at least a smile and a welcome would be nice.

Yes, nothing says everlasting love like carbs and buttercream. \n\nRegardless of the hubbub of aggressive window shoppers, Jennifer remained poised and sold us a couple of the regular-sized cupcakes for $3.25 each. One was the carrot cake with cream cheese - a kinda-meh concoction that didn't strike me as terribly original but awfully sweet. The other was the true winner, a red velvet cupcake with a marshmallow meringue topping that took some time under a broiler. There is a small window counter and exactly one stool, so I get the impression they want you to am-scray when you grab your goodies.\n\nThis was actually not the first time I tried Jennifer's confections since her mini-cupcakes were prominently featured at the Yelp holiday party where you had to shoulder-squeeze through the throngs to get one. You can probably tell I'm just not a cupcake aficionado. I'd prefer a cheesecake... no, not a slice, a whole one. Stop judging me.

My extraordinary will power allowed me to wait a few hours before visiting the shop.  I meant to walk out of her bakery with just six mini cupcakes.  I ended up with a dozen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YhePgD1qj43XI7s-UP0NDw?select=P0HzFqBgnezN_K4O-84EHw) forcing me to share a few with my co-workers.  The cupcakes were as fabulous as I had hoped!  Please note that this bakery is a mere two blocks from my workplace.  That's not good!  After one visit I am totally in love with Jennifer's cupcakes!\n\nI purchased five different varieties of mini cupcakes, and I returned to work to sample all five.  The remaining seven cupcakes were left to my co-workers with a simple announcement on the intercom, \"Delicious mini cupcakes near the time clock.  Please take only one and no fighting!\"  You should have seen the pushing and shoving to get at those cupcakes.  I took my five to my cubicle and sampled them in private.\n\nLuscious Vanilla (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YhePgD1qj43XI7s-UP0NDw?select=VtXRyu0202pfQwFO6zkA6A) - Moist and dense yellow cake with a nice buttercream frosting topped with a miniature vanilla wafer.  This was delicious.  I was just getting started though.  I hid the other four as I ran to the break room to retrieve my carton of Lactaid brand milk from the refrigerator.  My co-workers knew something was up.  I rarely take milk breaks!\n\nRed Velvet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YhePgD1qj43XI7s-UP0NDw?select=LLEyPPg3ZN9ftOe4q0ANpQ) - Ohhh!  There's a very slight bitterness in the cake which leads me to believe there's more than just red food coloring in there.  Maybe they do use beet juice.  Regardless, the moist and sticky cake paired well with the fluffy cream cheese frosting.  Suddenly, I felt red velvet euphoria!\n\nCherry Cola (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YhePgD1qj43XI7s-UP0NDw?select=hqhtZ4DrrgViyLGTFGOz8g) - OMG!  The cake actually tasted like cola but without the fizz.  Very unique and very good!  The cherry buttercream frosting is bit softer than the other frostings, but I'm not complaining.  Topped with a candied cherry half I loved this one also.\n\nMaple Bacon [officially known as Pancake Breakfast] (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YhePgD1qj43XI7s-UP0NDw?select=Dw5FRj_FX7uzs0iUzWKB-Q) - My favorite of the lot, but then again, I'm a bacon fanatic.  I thought it was pretty neat looking with that sliver of crispy fried bacon on top of the rich buttercream frosting, but I was in for a big surprise when I bit into the cake.  There's more bacon than you can believe in the cake batter.  If not for the sweet buttercream this would definitely be savory.  As expected, the maple and bacon flavors are equally prominent.  I almost didn't purchase this one, but Jennifer talked me into it.  \"It's really good!\"  Nice going, lady!\n\nCarrot Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YhePgD1qj43XI7s-UP0NDw?select=6z1WImJroHrAF_MYrf9BKA) - This was the gluten-free selection of the day.  Gluten-rich foods don't bother me, but I got this one to make it a full dozen.  The cake was kind of unique in itself.  I liken it to a cross between a traditional carrot cake batter and a spice cake batter.  As was true of all of the cakes this one was very moist also with lots of soft shredded carrot inside.  The cream cheese frosting was good and I liked the sprinkling of crunchy candied carrots on top.\n\nSo good and yet, so dangerous!  Cups and Cakes Bakery, welcome to the neighborhood!

Worth the third cupcake? Not quite. But definitely tasty enough to make me forget that I'm not quite ready for cupcakes again, for just a little while.", "author": "Johnny W."}

It tasted kind of bland and the frosting was way too sweet for my liking. My friends said that you can taste the flour in the batter and I agree.

Of course, the classics are always available: chocolate, vanilla and the uber-popular Red Velvet. For those of us who crave novelty, though, there are about five totally new flavors too. Just yesterday, for instance, when I went in they had pink lemonade with pomegranate, honey almond and raspberry truffle among others. I love this!\n\nThe cupcakes themselves taste great. They're not overloaded with frosting and the cake is moist and not too heavy-just perfect.\n\nAs an added bonus, the owner, Jennifer, is super-nice. She happened to be in the day I first came by and we chatted for a long while about the store. It is her baby - one location, right in Soma, so you can support a local business too (I know how those of us in SF like to do that! ;) ).

I got to knocked down another one of my bookmarks! :)\n\nIt's located on the busy 9th street, but I didn't have an issue parking. I went at 5pm and I parked right up front. It was a really small shop and I recommend looking up it's store picture on yelp before getting there as like I did. I was able to spot it better right away with the image in my head. I stepped inside and it was basically an open kitchen that took up most of the store. They had a glass display case (like ones for jewelry) that served as a divider to separate from the customer side which was only about a couple feet in of standing space. There was only one lady there and she was making cupcakes, I assume she is the owner. She was really nice. I appreciate the fact that she gave me time to pick out what I want. I needa that space when it comes to making these tough decisions with cupcake flavors. \n\nThey had regular sized cupcakes and minis...I ordered minis so I can tackle as many flavors as I can...\n\nThe Specialties $2.15...\n\n- Pumpkin Perfection: It's a gluten-free pumpkin cake with cream cheese frosting with a couple toasted pumpkin seeds on top. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin, but this was really good. I loved how it's gluten-free. I loved the cream cheese frosting and I usually don't even like cream cheese except on my bagels! \n\n- Banana Split: It's a banana cake filled with chocolate pastry cream with vanilla frosting. The presentation itself was already enough to send me to the dessert heaven. The cake had the great smell of banana and tasted just as good as it smelled. The chocolate pastry cream was awesome.\n\n- Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough: It's a chocolate chip cake with brown sugar frosting and chip chips on top. This was one OK. It didn't really stand out for me. I thought it would actually have tiny chunks of cookie though in it but it didn't.\n\n- Pink Lemonade: It's a tart lemon cake with frosting and rainbow sprinkles. The tart lemon cake was soooooo yummy! The tart that came with it made me yearn for more! The frosting though was interesting...it tasted like skittles.\n\n- Orange Dreamsicle: It's an orange juice cake with orange and vanilla frosting. I took a bite into this and I was like O...M...G!! The orange juice cake was explosive in my mouth, my taste buds went bananas! DE-LISH-IOUS!!! I highly recommend this one!\n\nThe Classics $1.95...\n\n- Red Velvet: This was one of the best red velvets I've ever had. Typically the cream cheese frosting is really heavy, but this one was really light and flavorful at the same time! WOW.\n\n- Luscious Vanilla: It VERY vanilla tasting on the frosting...it was like eating a vanilla ice-cream. It was like vanilla-overload.\n\nThe customer service here was excellent. She was VERY welcoming and helpful. She explained how the cupcake boxes were biodegradable and if we come back with the box at the next visit, we can get a free mini cupcake as an incentive. Also, she explained how her cupcake wrappers are a bit customized. It had a tiny cut to tear for easy access to the cupcake. I didn't really think it's necessary, but it's thoughtful of them. I do appreciate it. \n\nAll the cupcakes I had was special. It was very creative. I feel like she is quite daring when it comes to the specialty cupcakes. It's so uncommon! Orange juice cupcakes? Banana split? Wowsers! I would never get flavors like this at Kara's. This lady really brings it to the table when it comes to her cupcakes. I was able to feel her creativity in me as I took bites into each of the cupcakes. It was simply amazing. \n\nThe one thing that kept it away from a 5-star rating is that ALL of it's frosting was too sweet for me. I really LOVE sweets, but it was too much sugar.

I can't even imagine the chemicals those cups leach off during the baking process. Plus it's hard to believe they are food grade. Yuck. I cannot believe they picked those medicine cups as their gimmick. \nAnother minus - if someone orders an assortment, you as the bakery should provide a list of what is included so folks know what flavor they are supposed to be eating.

I had heard from friends and Yelp reviewers alike that this was the place for cupcakes and yes I had to follow the other lemurs off the cliff. \n\nFinding this place was easy enough and parking was really sweet and easy during rush hour traffic. The store itself is a tiny little space with bright pink highlights and a convenient sign on the sidewalk tempting you and informing you of the flavors of the day. Today I decided to partake in the lime-coconut, angel food with toasted marshmallow, caramel, and cookies and cream. \n\nCoconut-lime: Kind of a disappointment. The lime overpowered the coconut frosting and tasted way too buttery somehow. \n\nAngel Food with Marshmallow: Actual cake was too soft and fell apart but the marshmallow topping was too tough. It was a complete contrast in texture and another disappointment.\n\nCaramel: This one tasted like creme brulee only because it tasted toasted/burned and had a hint of caramel. \n\nCookies and Cream: This was the only highlight of the entire experience. It tasted similar to any cookies and cream ice cream and the chunks of Oreo on top was a delightful touch. \n\nI'm not completely against coming back here again because I hear the red velvet is good but I would definitely not make an effort to come here again. Hopefully someone would just hand me a red velvet cupcake in the future...", "author": "Jessica K."}

I have to go back approximately 3-4wks to begin this story. \n\nWe planned on visiting the City, so I suggested we stop by and pick up the mini cupcakes with the Groupon I had purchased a month or so earlier.   As we were walking to the bakery door from our car (which was parked right in front of the door) my husband noticed that the girl was getting ready to close.  He said \"hey\" and she stated that she was getting ready to close for lunch.   I said that we had driven a ways and asked if it would be ok to get some cupcakes.  Her reply, \"ok, but hurry up\".  Really?  Bad customer service from the gate.  We all looked at each other with the \"you're kiddin look\".  She did let us enter, reluctantly.  \n\nNow, I didn't remember that the fine print on the Groupon said \"24 hr notice\" was needed to pick-up goods, that's fine my oversight.  We were going to just buy a cupcake, since we were there, but her service was so rude that we decided against it.  \n\nNow fast forward to July 12 @ approx 2-2:30pm.  The same girl was present to give us our order.  No amicable greeting and again she acted as if we disturbed her day.  When we left,  my 8 yr old child said \"that was the same  lady and she still has a bad attitude.\"   \n\nNow that we know that service was bad,  let's talk about the cake cups that could not be anymore redeeming.   We picked up the 24 mini pack with multiple flavors.  We took a bite from each flavor thinking \"the next one has to be better\"   Not!  The cake was dry, not tasty and the icing was too sweet and dry as well.  The remainder ended up in the trash.  Furthermore, I don't think that baking them In that little paper cup was a good idea at all.   They were hard to peel from the cup.  That's enough about that.  \n\nOverall, not a good experience.

Cups and Cakes Bakery just surpassed anyone else in customer service, deliciousness, and supreme awesomeness. \n\nI called yesterday afternoon on a whim and politely asked if there was any way I could have cupcakes delivered on same-day delivery in the city (I have some friends who have been working their brains out this week with killer 14 hour days who could use some sweetness). The very kind and patient man from Cups and Cakes was totally on board. I wasn't particular about flavor, so it was easy. They had a surplus of cupcakes, were already making a city delivery, and BAM. Done and done. Less than an hour later, cupcakes were delivered. \n\nFlexibility is becoming increasingly underrated, and the ability to figure out a way to say \"Yes\" often seems to be going by the wayside.

This is a bakery made just for YOU!\n\nEach time I walk down to Peet's Coffee, I pass this little hole in the wall that was formerly a VERY greasy spoon diner.  In June of last year, the pig sty was transformed into a great little bakery that churns out cookies, cakes, cupcakes and I don't know what else.  \n\nPretend for a moment that the sidewalk is a freeway with various exits along the way.  Depending on the alure, some exits you don't take (like the exit to Los Banos) and others you do take (like the exit to Disneyland).  \n\nAnyway,  while walking on the sidewalk near this place, the sweet smells emanating from this bakery are enough to make you want to enter the pink Dutch door like I did today.\n\nI'm on a diet, but that didn't stop me today.  I bought a double chocolate mini-cupcake and while I could have taken the entire cupcake into my mouth, I took it in five bites and savored every one.  And if you're seriously on a diet, no problem, their Angel Food with 7-minute frosting is only 65 calories!\n\nWhen I reach my weight loss goal, I'm going back and treating myself to one of their signature cookies:  a layer of cream cheese frosting and a layer of dark chocolate frosting pressed between two salty oatmeal cookies.  Now you're talking!!!\n\nNow, why did I say this bakery is perfect for Vegans?  Well, it's because most of their cupcakes, cookies or cakes can be made vegan to order.  When I was inquiring, I was told that they would make a vegan cupcake of my choice if I had an hour to wait!  Now that's service!\n\nThey're a bit on the expensive side, but then again, like the slogan for L'oreal ... You're worth it!", "author": "David C."}

It's a block away from the 9th & Brannan center/Trader Joe's (head towards downtown).  The bakery has limited counter space and no seating.  It feels more like their workspace where they just happen to have a small retail section.  The selection is limited but they just opened.  During my visit they had 5 types of cupcakes (including a gluten free one, carrot cake), 2 types of cookies (one was vegan) and 1 type of scone.\n\nThey had mini versions ($1.75) and full size versions ($2.75) of the cupcakes.  \n\nCupcake flavors:\n* Luscious vanilla: The vanilla cake was nice but didn't have a strong vanilla flavor (almost like a yellow cake).  The vanilla frosting was smooth, thick, dense and sweet.  It had a nice texture - not too soft, not too hard.  The mini nilla wafer was a cute touch.  Needs more vanilla flavor, no visible evidence of vanilla beans.  \n* Deep dark chocolate: Dark chocolate cake with dark chocolate frosting and a chocolate chip.  More moist than the vanilla cake with a thick dense swirl of chocolate frosting.  Good but basic/classic.  Has a ton of frosting, I could do with less.\n* Orange juice\n* Red velvet: heard it was just okay\n* Gluten free carrot cake\n\nI didn't like the waxed cup that the cupcake comes in.

Since I was in the neighborhood doing a little shopping at Bed Bath & Beyond, I figured I would stop in and pick up a couple of cupcakes.\n\nFirst, let me say that I find it very surprising that a cupcake shop would do well in this neighborhood. The area is unpleasant and pretty sketchy. You don't see a lot of families out for a stroll around here. I'm guessing that Cups and Cakes is not that interested in walk-ins and probably makes the bulk of its profits from large catering orders.\n\nHaving read descriptions of some of their cupcakes in the SF Weekly post, I was planning to get the Pancake Breakfast (maple bacon with maple bacon frosting) for my husband and the Root Beer Float (root beer with vanilla frosting) for myself. They had neither, which was a bit disappointing. I asked the man behind the counter and he said they only have certain cupcakes on certain days. Fair enough.\n\nI should say that the man who helped me didn't go out of his way to be warm or helpful. He was just there. He answered my questions and got out the cupcakes I ordered and put them in a box and took my money and handed me my box of cupcakes, but there was no joy in any of it. When I'm at a boutiquey small business -- and especially one that's a cupcake shop -- I feel entitled to having someone help me with at least a little bit of joy. Otherwise, why not just sell your cupcakes via a cupcake vending machine?\n\nI ended up getting a chocolate chip cupcake for my husband and a raspberry-filled lemon cupcake for myself. They were pretty good. They weren't $3.25 good. They weren't go-out-of-your-way good. But they were pretty good.\n\nKara's Cupcakes and That Takes the Cake, both in the Marina, have way better cupcakes and warmer, more attentive employees.\n\nIf you're interested in the SF Weekly post, here's the link:\nhttp://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2012/01/san_franciscos_top_10_cupcake.php", "author": "Jessica L."}

The place is tiny and a little bit difficult to find. So we walk in and see the cupcakes on display. The cups they put them in are like the cups that are used to get Ketchup at In N Out or at McDonald's. I guess this is why their namesake is Cups and Cakes, because they use cups instead of traditional foil cupcake wrappers. It is definitely unique and makes for easy eating because the cups are easily tear-able. I just didn't find it very visually appealing. We ordered all mini cupcakes which were 2.50 a piece; a carrot cupcake, nutella raspberry, and a red velvet cupcake. \n\nThe carrot cake one was too spicy for my liking, just too much cinnamon and nutmeg I believe. The frosting was very good having a unique cream cheese taste almost like a goat cheese flavor in my mouth. The nutella was decent but not my favorite. I didn't like the raspberry jelly they put in the filling, it just didn't blend with the nutella flavors like I was hoping that it would. Finally, the red velvet; I've had much red velvet in my life so far from many a bakeries and this one stands out as unique for sure. The frosting is the same as the carrot cake variety and was definitely creamy and sweet with that goat cheese flavor as I mentioned. The cake part could have been moister and wasn't the best velvet cake portion that I've ever had. Overall, a disappointing encounter, and not worth the walk from Westfield Mall. The prices are the same as specialty cupcake bakeries like Sprinkles and Crumb's but in terms of presentation and taste, they just can't compete. I wouldn't come back here unless they gave me an ultra good deal or a new taro flavor cupcake!!", "author": "Cliff C."}

Not only did they boast bold sweet treats (Mimosa and Lemonade), the cute and helpful guy working ( Gabino? ) was so helpful and understanding that I was giddy for cakes.\n\nFor those of you who are all about the campy / kitchy Sprinkles experience, open your horizons and find your roots here.

After arduous and extensive study and research, I discovered I prefer my cupcakes of the fresh/moist cake, lightly sweet frosting, and organic ingredients variety.  I have had my share of cupcakes gone horribly wrong -  dry cupcakes, topped with congealed, sickeningly sweet frosting, all made with artificial ingredients.  Luckily, Cups and Cakes fits into the former category.  Of the sampler I tried, my favorites were the ginger beet, red velvet, raspberry truffle, boston cream pie, and oj.  I'm not a massive fan of the paper cupcake wrappers (there's a whole technique for getting your cupcakes out of them smoothly, requiring a bit of patience and time I do not possess when I eat cupcakes), and they aren't the most heavenly beautiful cupcakes in the world, but they are indeed divine to eat.\n\nJennifer herself is super personable and seems to genuinely appreciate feedback on her cupcakes.

It's a small place near Trader Joe's and Costco. \n\nCupcake: Cake and Frosting\nThe cakes were moist but was lacking in flavor. \nThe frosting were overall pretty good. \n\nSnickerdoodle - The icing was great! It did taste like a snickerdoodle. The cake was just there to hold the frosting (as it was for all of the cupcakes). Bland and moist. I was wishing it would compliment the frosting.\n\nCookies & Cream - This was a nice balance between cookies and cream. Sometimes people put a whole bunch of cream with a sprinkle of cookies and the cookie flavor gets lost. \n\nLemon Drop - The sugar overpowered the lemon. I couldn't even taste the lemon or any tangy/tartness in it. This one was a total miss.\n\nRed Velvet - Again the frosting was fantastic but the cake was bland and I couldn't taste anything, felt like a filler. Whole point of a red velvet is the frosting AND the cake.\n\nDark Chocolate - Frosting was great, not too sweet. Just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth. Light enough to want another one after eating. \n\nVanilla - Did not try it. I'm not a vanilla fan. However, I did try to smell it and there was no trace of vanilla flavor. That made me question if it was purely made with vanilla extract.\n\n\nBottom line:\nTheir strong point is definitely the frosting. If you like light cakes with heavy, rich frostings then this is the place for you. For me, I like a balance of both. The cake should be just as good as the icing. \n\nGo back again? Maybe. Probably only if they're offering a really good deal. At least this place is not on my blacklist. I'll try them again if they improve the flavor of the cakes.", "author": "Shirlene K."}

We got our cupcakes, sat down and were ready to enjoy what looked to be great cupcakes. He took a bite, I took a bite and we both looked at each other. It was one of those \"what did we just eat\" kind-of-movie moment. Needless to say we both weren't too ecstatic and he had to help me finish the 2/3's of the cupcake that I didn't finish.

It started from childhood and mostly because I link all of my happiest memories (which are few and far between) with celebrating my birthday.  \n\nSo, since JUNE is my BIRTH MONTH, I decided to start a list of some of the cupcake establishments that I've tried in California and NYC.  I've not tried them anywhere else b/c HONESTLY, I've not been anywhere else in a long while (job hazard). \n\nOkay, now back to CUPS and CAKES.  I ordered a rather LARGE order of MINI cupcakes at CUPS   I could have SWORN that I wrote a review about this place before.  I hope that it hasn't been removed!\n\nI've been here several times.  Once during their grand opening, once because I had a hankering for cupcakes and recently because I wanted to bring some mini cupcakes for a cupcake tasting/snack break here at Genentech.\n\nSome comments:\n\nWhere some stores are kinda snooty about their \"gourmet\" product, cups & cakes really reflects it's neighborhood (SOMA - 9th street).  The employees aren't uppity at all.  They take the time to answer questions, but they do always seem to be busy decorating and baking when I show up (which is a good sign).\n\nBe sure to check the CALENDAR, flavors change.\n\nYet, there is a good choice of flavors on a daily basis, both CLASSIC and SPECIALTY.\n\nThe icing is awfully sweet, but it is FLAVORFUL!\n\nThe cups idea is cool, but makes it really difficult to peel off and leave the actual cake unscathed.\n\nOut of the many that I've tried, my favorite:  Irish Coffee (yes, I belong in AA, we know that already).\n\nOn a side note:  I purchased 1 box full of minis, but there are different price points if you choose classic over specialty.  Just be aware of that.\n\nAll in all, I would say that the service is good and the cupcakes are solid.

The first one I tried was a simple vanilla cupcake and it took me back to my grandmother's baking from 15 years ago. I usually get a chocolate cupcake for my husband and then try their crazy flavors myself. I love their mojito, their pancake breakfast, and anything they attempt with lemonade or cheesecake in the name. They've also been making caramels (salted, salted with bacon) and it's all delicious. I heard the owner explain once that pretty much everything in the ingredients is organic, too, and I can certainly vouch for the freshness. \n\nTo top it off, they're just nice people. Every time I go in, I'm greeted with a smile and have a nice chat with the person behind the counter, and it's a really clean and well-kept shop. I 'liked' them on Facebook and really enjoy the updates in my newsfeed about newest items and flavors, plus I bring my box back and they give me a free mini each time!", "author": "A I."}

Got a Groupon deal for $25. I gotta tell you, it was not worth the $25, what about the full price of $50? They are tiny and there was 4 of each flavor (which I had to find out what flavor was by either guessing or eating each one). The \"assorted\" box came with classic flavors only, such as chocolate, red velvet, lemon, strawberry and I am guessing vanilla (it was a weird flavor, so I am not sure), there was no specialty in there. So if they were trying to earn new customer, it should try at least to add some cupcakes that would make you go back there because they were the only one carrying that specific flavor.\n\nAll in all, I've tried much better for much less.\n\nAt least it was good for killing my craving for sugar.", "author": "alice a."}

Yes, they have chocolate, vanilla and red velet like everybody ele, but they also have root beer float (wonderful), samoa (awesome like the cookie) and pretty, pretty princess.

And my cousin. \n\nCoconut- its better than other coconut cupcakes i've tried, but I probably wouldnt get this particular flavor again.\n\nPB&J- the grape cupcake was pretty dry.. the frosting was good, and has a nice subtle peanut butter flavor. it definitely reminded me of a pb and j sandwich, and I might get this again just to see if the cupcake is moister. \n\nStrawberry Banana- the best cupcake out of every one I tried :D I want moreeeee.\n\nPancake breakfast- the cupcake was more savory than i thought it would be. the frosting had a nice flavor, but was kind of gritty.. like there were still sugar crystals all through it. overall it was fun to taste, but its just not something i would get on a regular basis. worth a shot, though!\n\nVanilla with strawberry frosting: they had run out of the pretty princess flavor already, but were nice enough to frost some vanilla cupcakes with strawberry frosting for me. I loved the frosting, and the cupcake was good too, but the strawberry seemed to overpower the flavor of the cupcake. So next time, I will definitely try the princess cupcake.\n\nMoonpie: chocolate cupcake with marshmallow frosting. i got this for my boyfriend because i do not like chocolate cake. He loves chocolate cake and marshmallow, so i thought it was a good match. He liked it, and said he would give it a 7/10..

Their Happy Hour special of Buy 1, Get 1...it applies to EVERYTHING - cupcakes, cookies, caramels, homemade fudge...orgasmic OATMEALICIOUS cookies!!!!\n\nOk, so here's the real deal: went w/ 3 friends after dinner on a Saturday, right before 7pm so limited selection. I'm definitely (as in I'm planning in my calendar right now) to go back & try the others. I'll start small & work up. All cupcakes were the baby bite sized so we could buy/eat a few right away. \n\nHomemade fudge - it's ok...it was a little dry & not overly fudgey. I'll stick w/ the version my aunt makes during the holidays that's peanut butter gooeyness. But only $1 each.\n\nSalted Caramel - very good. Not overly caramel-y where you're chewing for 30 minutes then it gets stuck in your teeth. No...this one is more on the velvety-side with a nice flavor/taste. Glad I have 2! ($0.50 each & since it was buy 1, get 1, I got 2 free caramels since I bought a fudge!)\n\nBrown Sugar & Brown Butter Cookie - good, but not great as it was dry & the edges crumbled. They used a muffin top pan & I think these cookies would be stellar if baked on a sheeet pan & eaten right from the oven. Then, I'll agree - this would be \"my cookie if I had a cookie\".\n\nRich Red Velvet - used to be my favorite flavor for everything but now I'm realizing it really is just yellow cake w/ food coloring & cream cheese. While the cream cheese was nice, smooth & moist, this cupcake didn't really \"do\" it for me. Not very exciting flavor-wise.\n\nLuscious Vanilla - fantastic! The vanilla flavor was spot-on. Not overpowering but there. I think having bits of the real vanilla bean in the frosting would up the WOW factor, but this cupcake does it plenty already.\n\nCherry Cordial - but not because mine had a chocolate drizzle on it but it's not pictured on the website & now I don't remember. But the one that has the Marashino Cherry w/ chocolate drizzle. The drizzle was the perfect touch - setting off the flavors. Saved the cherry for last (of course!) with just a bit of chocolate on its side...divine!\n\nMexican Hot Chocolate - the last 1 I ate & now 1 of my favorites. The chocolate & spice were so perfectly married that I wanted more as soon as I was finished with it. Rich & dark, smooth & moist. Can't ask for more than this perfect creation.\n\n(saved best for last) Oatmealiscious Cookie - GO BUY ALL OF THESE!!! (but hide them so they don't get stolen!). 2 oatmeal cookies with chocolate & frosting sandwiched in the middle. I only bought a mini & my friend got the large one...I asked her for another bite after I finished mine & she refused me! (as well she should have - I would have too!) This thing is amazing - the oatmeal provides a nice crunch & texture to the moist & sweet cream in the middle. The chocolate adds that final touch of magic which makes it oh-so-yummy-come-an-get 'um! This IS \"my cookie\". \n\nTake your friends, buy them for bday parties, just be a part of this bakery's life. It's worth every guilt trip you give yourself later.", "author": "Marissa H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-21", "description": "I was very disappointed with the service from this place.  I bought a groupon special from cups and cakes and saw on their website that they required 24 hours notice for ordering.  With that I placed an order on Friday at 2pm and went to pick up my cupcakes at 4pm on Saturday.  When we arrived a very unfriendly worker gave us a lecture on how they were unable to fulfill our order and they were booked for the next couple of weeks.  Then she went on and on how we did not get a conformation email because we ordered after 3pm, which did not make sense as I printed out my email order and the time stamp states 2:04pm.  So after she saw that she said, \"I'll try to put something together.\"  After a 5 minute lecture on how she doesn't have our order she grabs a premade box of cupcakes and says, \"Here you go.\"  \n\nShe made no sense at all.  Why the long lecture and unfriendly attitude as she clearly was able to fill our order.  Not to mention, all she had to do was to email me back the day before saying she couldn't fill our order and I would never have bothered making the trip and saved the groupon for another day.  They just seem highly unorganized and didn't seem to want customers from their unfriendly attitude.\n\nThat being said, we did get our cupcake assortment.  There were:\n4 red velvet, 4 chocolate, 4 vanilla, 4 lemon, 4 strawberry, and 4 orange sherbet.  The frosting on all the cupcakes were excellent.  Not too sweet and completely the flavor they're supposed to be instead of the generic butter cream flavor of most cupcakes.  However, I thought the cake portion of the cupcake was a bit dry and flavorless.  If you've ever had a sprinkles cupcake, then you know that this cupcake does not compare at all in moistness or flavor.  However, I do feel the frosting here is better than the frosting used by sprinkles.  That being said, cupkates is still hands down the best cupcake I've had thus far.  Their cake portion is moist and flavorful and their frostings are full of flavor and not super sweet.  \n\nOverall, the experience was unfriendly, and the cupcakes only ok.

They had a great variety from orange creamsicle, root beer float, vanilla cream puff and a really funny one that I didn't try that was topped with bacon and bananas LOL! The owner was nice, the bakery looked pretty clean. The array of customers were interesting and funny too! Prices were reasonable 1.75 for mini cupcakes and 2.50 for regular size. The strawberry lemonade was to die for..OMG sooo yummy even better than red velvet cupcakes my stomach smiles  just thinking about those yummy little cupcakes =) They come in a really cute pink box and if you bring your box in the next time you come you get a free mini.woohoo =)..

My favorite cupcake, now of all time, is their Pancake Breakfast. It tastes just like a giant fluffy pancake drenched in maple syrup. I wish they made this flavor every day, but I understand they need to keep a rotation of flavors and keep things fresh.

Very helpful for my lunchtime adventures.\n\nI think the shop is bright and cheery, very clean, and the workers are generally friendly. The baking area is in plain site of the sales counter, so it's very open and adds to the ambiance of the place.

Sure, but this is the most effective way for me to point out how this bakery offers *the* best cupcakes in the city--nay--ever. \n\nI'm as big a fan of funfetti as the next guy, but after 20+ years, my cupcake palette has grown beyond what my classmates' mothers would make for the class on their kids' 5th birthdays. \n\nWhat makes a great cupcake, and by extension, a great cupcake establishment? It's one, simple but hard to execute principle: Creativity. I don't know a spatula from a wooden spoon, but I know when the icing's vanilla and the batter's Betty Crocker. If it's something *I* can bake, no thanks.\n\nCups And Cakes says, \"Duncan Hines, Betty Crocker, game over.\" Like a great mystery novel that keeps you guessing, you never know what kinds of cupcakes will greet you, and when you hear what these cupcakes are supposed to taste like, you're naturally skeptical. That's the beauty of adventurous baking. \n\nCase in point--it was St. Patrick's Day and my wonderful girlfriend and her wonderful friend bought me Patty's Day-inspired flavors, one of which was Guiness. And I hate Guiness. \n\nThis cupcake, however, not only tasted like a Guiness pint, but also didn't lose its charm as, well, a cupcake. At the end of the day, who would think to pair Guiness flavors with a cupcake? That's how Cups And Cakes succeed and stands above the rest--risk, and so far for me, always a reward; what they say the cupcake is, tastes like it--what a novel concept!\n\nCups And Cakes also gets brownie points (heh) for their green approach to packaging. While many companies are getting dinged for offering their products within superfluous boxes, Cups And Cakes offers a free mini cupcake when you reuse your boxes for more cupcakes. It's a great example about how being green drives more business. \n\nSo when you need that pick-me-up after a long day crunching numbers, stop by Cups And Cakes for some inspired creativity and a warm, welcoming store (lots of pink and a pink cruiser with flowers in the basket reside outside it). Also, if I happen to be buried alive, I hope all the layers are cupcakes, so I'm even more compelled to eat my way out. \n\nOK, I'll stop being so morbid...", "author": "Brian D."}

Thanks Jennifer for your response! I must try your Oatmealicious soon!\n\nI saw an article on the Oatmealicious cookie at Cups and Cakes Bakery earlier this week on SF Weekly and forced my boyfriend to get one for me since he was on jury duty near by.\n\nOn Thursday, he picked me up from work with a big pink box full of cupcakes! (They were out of the Oatmealicous cookie.) Aw, thanks K!\n\nThe food:\n\nI've never seen cupcakes like these before. Most designer cupcakes are perfectly symmetrical, but not these. They had a real homemade look and came in little paper cups rather than the usual cupcake wrapper. Their signature is the little slit on the side of the cup, so you can easily tear the wrapper off. K bought 6 cupcakes and the kind owner gave us a mini red velvet for free. We ended up eating the cupcakes over the next 2 days, and the cakes were still moist - a real plus. Cupcakes are $2.75 each.\n\nCloud 9 - I totally understand why they call it Cloud 9. This cupcake is made of a sticky and chewy angel food cake topped with a fluffy marshmallow frosting. The frosting is a little too sweet than what I'm used to, but supposedly it's only 150 calories so it's A-OK with me.\n\nCherry Soda - This one was alright. Again, too sweet for my taste. I have no idea what kind of cake they use for this. I'm guessing a caramel? The frosting had a hint of cherry soda flavor.\n\nVanilla & Chocolate - These are 2 separate cupcakes, but I'm just going to do a combined review. These 2 were the prettiest of the bunch. The vanilla is topped with a big swirl of vanilla frosting and a mini vanilla wafer cookie. The chocolate was topped with chocolate frosting and a chocolate chip. Both were really good. Moist cake, not too much frosting, not too sweet.\n\nI'd like to come back to Cups and Cakes Bakery to try the Oatmealicious cookie. Two soft and chewy oatmeal cookies sandwiching cream cheese frosting and chocolate ganache. YUM. I've got to try one of those soon.", "author": "Sam L."}

The paper liners are easier to pull down. With the snack nut cups you literally had to push the cupcake up and out of the cup. The frosting left a taste in our mouths.

She has an easy to navigate website, she always picks up her phone or returns emails promptly, and is as timely as Financial District traffic will allow for delivery. \n\nMy first order with her was for 6 dozen cupcakes for our CEO's birthday. I called her 2 days in advance, we talked about flavors, and she delivered. Which reminds me; she charges $10 for delivery. I don't know where she is, or how she gets here, but it's rediculously cheap. And cheap = awesome in my book. \n\nHer cupcakes are moist and flavorful, with just the right ratio of frosting to cupcake. This is both for the regular size and the mini bites ones as well. She's gotten her recipies pretty much perfected, though the Margarita cupcakes could pack a bit more of a punch. I have ordered the Red Velvet (which seem to be the office favorite), the vanilla with lemon, the Chocolate Coffee ones, the Pink Lemonade ones, the Megan's Margarita ones, and a couple of other flavors.\n\nYou really can't go wrong.

But it was cool meeting Jennifer and seeing her kitchen, along with all the other cupcakes waiting to be picked up. They all looked so freaking good, but not as good as mine. \n\nMy cupcakes were beautifully packaged with a cardboard insert that kept them from moving around. Jennifer even gave me tips for keeping them fresh for a few days (turns out this advice was unnecessary due to the speed of cupcake consumption).\n\nThe cupcakes were a big hit at the party, especially the ones with cinnamon cream cheese frosting. They were SO moist and the frosting light, yet thick and gooey. I am so impressed! And I know my friends were too (i.e. Miss Heidi Y.'s review).", "author": "Carolyn F."}

They were able to accomodate a last minute customization request for a dozen cupcakes and were ready for an early pick up. Only deduction is because the cakes were a bit on the dry side. I'm happy enough with my first experience though to return for another tasting, of hopefully a fresh batch.", "author": "Kim K."}

Its frosting was good--standard actually; nothing outstanding or supremely special.  (The plus side is that I found it less sweet than Kara's or Magnolia's...with the latter giving me a severe toothache.)  The peanut butter mini cupcake is worth a try though!  Maybe it's because I just love Reese's, but this one made the visit worthwhile!  The cake and frosting seemed well-balanced and wasn't too rich or sweet either.

I actually e-mailed Jennifer on the day of delivery asking if the cupcake delivery, originally schedule between 6pm - 8pm, could be moved closer to 7pm - 9pm as I was anticipating a longer day at work. She never responded to my e-mail (I'm assuming she got it, since all her orders are based off e-mail), so I had to leave work early to get the cupcakes.\n\nThe cupcakes themselves were o-kay. I bought a box to share with my friends and family over Thanksgiving, and while they looked great (the presentation of the cupcakes in the bright pink box is very cute!) I think most guests thought the cupcakes were about average. My friends who were in town from NYC said they prefer Magnolia and etc. (well, they're from  NYC, their options are endless!!) but some other guests said they didn't like them at all.\n\nI thought they were about average as well. I wasn't a huge fan of the cream cheese frosting, in general I don't like too much frosting, and fortunately there wasn't a ton of frosting on these cupcakes. But, the cream cheese frosting had a sour quality to it. I tried the chocolate buttercream thinking it might be more desirable, but it wasn't, I actually liked it even less than the cream cheese frosting. It was way too sugary and gave me a stomach ache.\n\nSorry, I really wanted to give this place a better review, but these are the facts! Also, I ended up paying $50 for a box.

I called the day before to request a couple specialty flavors for pickup the next day. The lady on the phone was very polite and said that they change flavor availability daily (except for the red velvet, chocolate, and vanilla), but that she would try to accommodate as best she could. Yay, I was very happy! \n\nThe next day, I walked in with my sister and both vouchers in hand. Flavor availability was VERY limited, and I was very disappointed. I picked up two dozen of the basic cupcakes, and another half dozen of the specialty cupcakes. The lady helping us was very patient as we picked our cupcakes. However, when she went to box them, she scraped the frosting off a couple of the Pretty Pretty Princess cupcakes. It wouldn't have been a big deal, had I not been planning to give these as gifts. A second lady came by and began putting the cupcakes into boxes, including the now mutilated cupcakes. I politely asked if I could exchange the damaged cupcakes, as I was giving them as gifts, and apologized for the inconvenience. A sarcastic look washed across her face as if to say, \"Really?! It's a cupcake.\" She said that those were the last ones and left it at that. A third lady baking in the back said that she had more frosting and could refrost it. Yay, I was happy again, despite that the refrost job looked almost as bad as the mutilation itself. \n\nWhen we went to pay (my sister was taking one box, and I the other box and a half), the same sarcastic second lady said that only one voucher was acceptable, regardless of whether or not it was a \"gifted\" voucher, since both had my name on it. We ended up paying $60+ for a terrible customer service experience and \"Eh...ok\" cupcakes. \n\nAS FOR TASTE... \nred velvet: Disappointing. It was really nothing special \npancake: Disgusting. I LOVE bacon. LOVE. This cupcake almost killed bacon AND cupcakes for me. \npretty pretty princess: This one was actually pretty good. The cake itself wasn't superb, but the strawberry frosting made up for it. \ncarrot cake: This cupcake was also good, but how can anyone mess up carrot cake? \npb&j: Not bad...but weird. \nvanilla: It was ok, but the ball on top tasted awful. \nalmond: Light almond flavor cake, with a stronger almond frosting. \nchocolate chip: Looks like cookie dough, not a memorable flavor. \nchocolate: Not bad. \n\n\nAll in all: I'm still stuck with one voucher.

The pink lemonade ones were a bit too tart for most of the party-goers, but nonetheless, people liked them.  Definately recommended!", "author": "Jessica F."}

Not only did I reach her on the first ring, but she was a complete sweetheart, totally professional and entirely unfazed by my crazy rush order. Our transaction was completed in about two minutes and I was left with no doubt that this woman would come through. My gut was right.\n\nOne look at her online menu and I knew I was in expert hands. Only problem was which fantasy flavors to go with. For my morning meeting, I chose Pancake Breakfast and Orange Juice baby bite cupcakes. And this morning, like clockwork, I rang her bell and was handed two safe-for-transport pink boxes of fragrant goodness. Yes, at 5:45 AM.\n\nFast-forward to the meeting: with all the bustling activity there, it was still the cupcakes everyone was talking about. You were a hit, Jennifer! And you will definitely be seeing a lot more of me in the future. Hopefully at a more decent hour.", "author": "Kelly N."}

I just celebrated a birthday, and at the last minute I thought it might be nice to provide some kind of snack or dessert for my guests. The problem was that the evening's schedule wouldn't allow me to pick anything up en route to the bar or to drop anything off beforehand. Thank goodness for Cups & Cakes. With about a day's notice, Jennifer was able to prepare my order and deliver it, no problem. The cupcakes were a hit -- apparently even the most stone-hearted of men enjoy a tasty bite-size cupcake -- particularly the Grasshoppers, the chocolate cupcakes with mint frosting topped with a Junior Mint. Look, I'm just some dude, but do yourself a favor in the popularity and goodwill departments, and order some Cups & Cakes cupcakes for your friends, you big dummy.", "author": "Eugene P."}

We picked her not because they were the most gorgeous -- they're cute, but lack the cupcake glamor of other bakers -- but because they were far and away the tastiest of others we tried. We arranged for her to drop off the cupcakes and set them up on the day of, since we were busy. When we got to reception they were all ready to go. Everyone loved them, enjoyed trying different flavors, and in general got a kick out of the mini cupcake experience. My only complaint is that Jennifer ended up switching the icing on one of our flavors, but when I mentioned it she offered a partial refund right away.

They come in really cute hot pink boxes and Jennifer decorated each tiny cupcake fabulously with a furry Elmo face (hey, at least its not Barney). She even made a special mini-cake for my daughter to attempt to eat  on her own (she's just turned 1).

And they look fabulously stylish. But have you tasted the gluten-free versions? It doesn't matter! The point is, they don't taste any different than the regular flavors!!! What???? I'm not kidding, and I've tasted gf cake all over this city!! My daughter, who is allergic to gluten, came for a tasting with me. We wanted to order a variety of cupcakes for a party, and we only serve gluten free in our house. So Jennifer hands over two different flavors of her gf cupcakes. One has strawberry icing. We took a bite. The closest any strawberry flavored food has come to tasting like the real thing. So I say, \"Jennifer, what do you use to get it to taste like real strawberries?\" And Jennifer goes, \"strawberries.\" Literally, she uses sugar, butter, strawberries. That's it! The other cake was a chocolate. Moist. Fluffy. Not falling apart like gf always does. NOT a dry sponge, like gf often is. They are simply the best gluten free cake we've ever had. We say to Jennifer, \"ok, what flavors can you make gluten free?\" thinking, ya, probably one or two. And Jennifer goes: \"all of them.\" This woman is a genius. Order for your party; you will be the cupcake hero. I am at my house!", "author": "Heidi f."}

I too came across Cups and Cakes Bakery on Yelp and decided to give Jennifer a call. She was great on the phone and I couldn't resist trying three different flavors, so I bought a dozen each of the luscious vanilla, rich red velvet, and pucker-up pink lemonade. When I picked them up each dozen was securely packaged in a plastic container with individual slots for each cupcake. They smelled great and I really wanted to try one, but decided to wait until the party. It was worth the wait. They were a hit at my boyfriend's birthday party. They were moist and full of flavor. But what really impressed me was the balance between the cake and the frosting. Jennifer makes the best butter cream frosting that I have ever had. Her frosting has more flavor than Kara's Cupcakes. They were so good! The red velvets were gone first, but the vanilla and pink lemonade were also delicious. I can't wait to have an occasion to order cupcakes from Jennifer again.

After I was too late to order the cupcakes my sister-in-law specifically requested for her baby shower (yikes!), I took a leap of Yelp and ordered 3 dozen cupcakes from Jennifer.  She was easy to work with, made lots of helpful suggestions about flavors and quantities and  -- most important -- loaded me up with the hit of the party: ridiculously scrumptious cupcakes. They were so gorgeous all lined up, people didn't want to eat them and ruin the effect. But then when they did -- mercy, they were soooo good.  We did a dozen each red velvet and chocolate, and then we were able to do a dozen assorted because Jennifer was making all sorts of different varieties for a wedding tasting.  The faves were the red velvet and the chocolate, and then depending on your tastes, the pink lemonade and the orange ones were excellent, too. The bacon cupcake was unconventional, yet tasty -- sort of like your entire breakfast rolled into one -- they'd be perfect for a brunch event.  I will definitely be ordering from Cups and Cakes again!", "author": "Teri O."}
