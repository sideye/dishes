Service is still a bit of a hit or miss and the ambiance looks much the same, perhaps just a bit brighter inside...but overall this last trip was really quite good.\n\nWe began our meal with the giant clams. 2 orders was still very hefty for an appetizer. Each serving comes with a generous portion of sliced, sweet surf clams and a half sea scallop tossed in vermicelli noodles mixed with minced garlic and chopped cilantro for flavor. Sweet soy sauce infused with jalapenos is served on the side. Flavors were absolutely on point and texture was also very good - I was impressed by this serving, especially since this was also not a top tier Chinese restaurant.  I'd definitely recommend this dish.\n\nNext came the salt and pepper spareribs. They are thinner than most banquet restaurants, but where they lack some meatiness they certainly hit the mark in terms of flavor and crispiness. Some places are too meaty while others use a batter that's too thick. Neither of those are true at Oriental....they likely have a light cornstarch dressing that's they thrown into the deep fryer before being tossed in kosher and white pepper. It was really quite good.\n\nThen came the salted pork congee. At $13 this sounds like a ripoff but the portion size is otherworldly, easily double that of most restaurants. They also throw in the salted pork bones which have a little meat that's then heavily salted for flavor. These bones are really the gems of the dish though since they are the source of flavor. So go ahead, gnaw on them a little.\n\nLast but not least was the beef and tomato pan fried noodles. I loved how many fresh quartered tomatoes they added in along with bell peppers and onions. The gravy was very good - not too thick and just enough to coat the majority of the noodles but still leave crispy parts. \n\nOverall good meal. I think they've definitely redeemed themselves for now.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I got walnut shrimp, salt and pepper oysters, and shrimp paste \"ong choy.\" They used cashews, not walnuts, and the shrimp was completely over fried and very dry. The oysters were very small but had thick batter/coating, and very little flavor. The ong choy was oily but had no flavor- couldn't taste any shrimp paste and it wasn't salty enough.\n\nI don't know if I came on a bad night or why the food was so bad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-03", "description": "You see a small Chinese restaurant with an unflattering furnishing and there's not much to think about after that.\n\n-You only go during lazy Tuesday nights for take-away chicken fried rice (and you drench it in Sriracha at home).\n\n-You only go when you're balling on a budget because $25 can get you a filling dinner for 2 with leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\n-It's a place you NEVER suggest to a friend. You'll suggest Koi Palace or S&T. You will suggest House of Xian or House of Pancakes. But never in your life will you suggest Oriental Seafood Restaurant.\n\nThat's all fair. OSR is not heralded like their neighbor S&T, nor do they have a special dish such as the Dan Dan Mien like House of Xian. It's not, as young cats would say, \"lit\". But I'm here to change that. Because OSR has a lot to offer, and it can be \"lit\" for all of us. \n\nConsider creating your own happy hour at OSR with your group of friends. $4 for a bottle of Heineken or TsingTao (spoiler: they taste the same), so that's $12 for a pretty good time. Supplement the beer with an array of Chinese makeshift Happy Hour food. The Salt & Pepper Spareribs ($8) is crispy, fried, meaty, and just begging to be washed down by a bottle of cold beer. For a slightly lighter option (with an big emphasis on slightly), the Honey Walnut Shrimp is a crowd favorite. Slightly fried shrimp doused heavily in mayonnaise, this popular dish takes away all the natural flavors of the shrimp and replaces it with a gluttonous awesomeness. In other words, the ideal pairing for mass-produced beer. Then after downing anywhere from 3 to 5 beers, you can finish this perfect experience with an order The Steamed Surf Clams ($7-8 per person). The clams are served sliced on a small bed of vermicelli with a healthy amount of soy sauce, all plated on the original clam shell. It's a good finish to the meal and gives a good glimpse of what OSR has to offer other than its Panda-esque menu. \n\nYour group will leave Oriental Seafood Restaurant with your bellies full and a slight buzz from reasonably priced beers -- a perfect pre-game. As your group Lyft your way out to an awesome night out, keep track of the OSR's bill total as compared to your transportation cost. You may not find a more economic Happy Hour place in all of San Francisco. Isn't that worth a recommendation?\n\n--\n\nFor people looking for serious seafood, I'd be remiss not to mention their Lobster. I'm not here to vouch for it's taste or OSR's cooking technique, I'm here to vouch for its value. \n\nLobsters are always market price, but I've been able to get away with $20 to $23 a pound. For a 6lb monster, you're only looking at $140 ish. This is crazy. I repeat, crazy. For a similar lobster at Koi Palace and/or Hong Kong Flower Lounge, you're going to be ponying up $300+. \n\nThe lobster can be served two different styles. The classic Cantonese way would be to have one plate be cooked with Ginger and Scallion. This way of cooking is supposed to minimize the interference with the Lobster's natural flavors while adding another layer of aroma. Or so my Grandpa says, he's the expert in our fam. The second way would be for it to be steamed with garlic over a bed of vermicelli. The same logic applies, minimize the interference of the Lobster's flavor.\n\nThis 6lb Lobster feeds four. Before cooking, the waitress will fish out the Lobster for your table to see how lively it is. I can attest, it's usually as lively as Blake Lively. This has become my go-to restaurant to take my gramps. He loves the giant lobster, and I'm all in on OSR's value. Good stuff.", "author": "Ringo M."}

We were not disappointed by the friendly service & low prices.  The orange peal chicken has a good orange flavor, but lacks iun spiciness though ther are chili peppers in the dish; our fault for ordering a Szechwan dish at a Cantonese restaurant.  The salt & pepper prawns are a hit with suculent prawns with a lite badder & wonderful salt & pepper mixture; I love the jalapinos & how they add to the bit of kick with the dish.  The e fu noodles with crab meat are lite & buttery with fresh crab meat, meaty mushrooms, & onions.  My mother loved her shrimp fried rice & has enough left for a couple days.  Needless to say, I have lunch tomorrow.  The tea is wonderful; definitely warms you up on a cold San Francisco night.  I loved the juicy oranges we got at the end of our meal.  So, for excellent Cantonese cuisine at low prices w2ith friendly service in a bare bones atmosphere, Oriental Seafood Restaurant cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.", "author": "Brian S."}

Do not let the plain and rather fading green awning fool you.  Or the carnival-induced namesake deter you (the term, \"oriental\" being applied to all Asians is usually a sign he was way too old to date, as was the case w/one geriatric).  The minute you step over the threshold, affable and cheery countenances greet you almost immediately.  This is a typical SF establishment set in the outer Sunset so expectations of fancy linings or the trappings of touristy clout will not woo you.  The carpeted flooring is ancient as are the blurry mirrors on the wall and the chairs, despite being comfortable after a long walk out on the beach, sport cracked vinyl.  This is where the locals and neighbors go for consistently large portions of greasy yet delicious American Chinese food (or traditional Chinese, if you can read/speak the language and order off the menu as thus).  Hot tea is always followed by a small ceramic dish filled with these savory coated peanuts that they also sell for $4 by the takeout box.  I nibble on these whilst perusing the menu.  Skip the typical fortune cookie dessert and request the hot red bean porridge instead.  The mildly sweet dessert will settle a full stomach.\n\nThis is by far, the most inexpensive joint (most of the dishes run around $5.95) I have found and the portions never reflect the cheap prices.  We have never been wronged by ordering the following: House Chow Mein, Pork Chow Fun, Wor Won Ton soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Mongolian Beef, Sweet & Sour Pork, Moo Shu Pork, Gai Lan w/garlic sauce, Steamed chicken w/garlic oil, fried (and steamed) flounder, shrimp + sauteed greens, Peking spareribs, and Black Bean Short Ribs. I've grown up with this menu so do not judge:  I am not Chinese and was born in America, which would reflect the rather typical order.  However, that being said, the plates consistently come heaping with food and we always leave with leftovers boxed neatly stacked and bagged.\n\nMy previous dates have enjoyed this spot.  My friends have enjoyed this spot.  And when family visits, I take them to this spot.  Parking is plentiful a few blocks down so park the car at a meter or take Muni and walk a bit.  Leave the chubby butts and lazy countenances back in suburbia.  And in retrospect, I will never take dates here again because this has become my little to-go-spot after running w/my friends and their dogs at Ocean Beach and Fort Funston.\n\nConsistency, maturity and longevity, I salute you.", "author": "Miika M."}

When our order was ready, which took no longer than 15 minutes, I was surprised. The meat was jammed into a plastic container box, to the point where the box almost didn't close shut! It's more than enough for two people to finish in one sitting. At about $6-7/entree for most dishes here, the prices cannot be beat. \n\nOn my second visit here with a friend of mine, we ordered the hot crispy (half) chicken and flat rice noodles with beef and bok choy. I'm not lying when I say that their hot crispy chicken is comparable to San Tung's chicken wings. The sauce is sweet and spicy and the skin on top of the chicken is perfectly crispy.

I visit too many Chinese restaurants that under-season or over-season their food, but this place is just right.\n\nThe lobster noodle is good and the black bean sauce clams are always a hit.  The fresh shrimp (still swimming in the tanks) and ling cod made two ways (Soup and Stirfry w/ veggies) for special occasions are a must.  The salt and pepper crab or green onion ginger crab never disappoints.\n\nWith cheap prices and the abundance of fresh seafood dishes, this restaurant will remain a mainstay on my Chinese restaurant list.", "author": "Curt L."}

It was around 9-10 at night, and there were only about 2-3 tables filled when we walked in. There was one table in the middle, filled with a couple drunk guys, who just happened to be smoking there. The manager asked them to stop about two times, then ended up drinking two beers with them. Needless to say, having people smoke in a restaurant, which is ILLEGAL, is a big no in my book. We asked them to stop smoking, and things didn't go well. Bottles were  thrown , plates were broken, and a chair was also thrown. Let's just leave it at that. \n\nPrices were cheap and the food wasn't that good. Everything here, you can probably find at another Chinese restaurant somewhere else in the neighborhood. \n\nThe only thing going for this restaurant is the price of the food. The taste wasn't good, it was too salty for my liking, but a fairly big portion. \n\nI would recommend this for people who just want a quick and cheap meal, for anyone who doesn't care AT ALL about the taste of their food. The experience here was just too much for me. I am avoiding this restaurant forever, no matter how cheap their prices are.", "author": "R F."}

It ain't fancy, but it is not quite hidden away or super tiny to warrant that overused term. I'd call it \"basic\" or \"sparse\". \nThis is a cheapskate's delight! What I've enjoyed most are the GI-NORMOUS PORTIONS of \"sup chow\" chow fun and fried rice. I saw a waitress serve on an oval dish chow fun stacked over 4 inches high. Ridiculous. I thought maybe the table ordered a double portion. But when I opened my take out, the plastic container was filled to the top. Could've fed me for three meals! That would work out to under $2.00 PER MEAL! I once took a couple orders to my parent's place and my mom was impressed. She knows a good deal when she sees it!\n\nUPDATE: The rock cod fillet w/tender greens isn't the freshest tasting. Stick with the whole steamed fish if you want fresh.

The calamari in the house chow mein was SPOILED! It was so gross. I picked out all the calamari from the chow mein and put it in a bowl. I was not going to complain, but then the waitress came by and said, \"Next time you should tell me that you don't like calamari so we don't put it in the dish!\"  I was so mad. I told her that the calamari was spoiled and she did not even say anything. Instead she just walked away to the cash register and ignored us. \n\nI am never going back to this place.
