It's mostly your standard Vietnamese cuisine of noodles and rice, soups and rolls and clay pots. We both picked out a vermicelli bowl each (vegetable for me, bbq pork for my partner) as well as an order of fresh vegetable spring rolls. \n\nThe rolls arrived first, as expected. The four rolls came with a sweet chili dipping sauce and were big and fat and full of fresh vegetables (mushrooms, lettuce, mint, some tofu, and not a lot of noodles surprisingly). They were very good and went great with the sauce.\n\nOur bowls came out not long after and I was quite shocked at the volume of food in both! I was also extremely impressed with the vegetable bowl, which was heaped with fried cabbage, mushrooms and tofu. Many places fall short in their vegetable bowls with a few boring vegetables and being very bland on taste, but this was bursting with flavour. I barely needed the extra sweet chili sauce that came with it (although I poured it in to seep through to the noodles underneath). My partner's bowl came topped with bbq pork and sprouts which he said was excellent and done really well. There was also so much food, we couldn't even come close to eating half of what we were served (we might've been able to eat more if we hadn't had the spring rolls?) Given how cheap the prices were though, we didn't feel bad leaving food behind, we gave it our best shot and ate until we were stuffed.\n\nPros: excellent food, the vegetable vermicelli bowl is delicious, huge portions for really cheap prices.\nCons: not a lot of vegetarian options overall, so be aware of this.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

Ordered the pho special which was $9 so that wasn't bad at all. The Pho came out piping hot which I like and had a nice glisten to the soup-all good signals. HOWEVER, I was instantly disappointed when I tasted the soup. It lacked so much flavor. I had to add extra hoisin and sirarcha just to scrap up whatever flavor I could get. \n\nAnd this place got 3 1/2 stars? Don't get me wrong, the ladies were nice AND they accepted credit cards but damn... I can't let the food slide. \n\nWould I be back? Most definitely not.

The restaurant is relatively small, but has sufficient seating to take care of most of the lunch crowd.\n\nBeef Pho: I was rather underwhelmed. Portions are fine, meat is a bit sparse, and soup was likely the least flavorful pho broth I've had. Noodles were average, nothing special but not bad either.\nBun w/ BBQ beef + Imperial Rolls: Much better than the pho in my opinion. Great portion sizes, beef is tender and flavorful, and the imperial rolls are done quite well. I would definitely come back again to try some of their other BBQ meats and also \n\nThey place their health department score card (81 points) close to the counter, so you don't really see it until you're right at the table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-14", "description": "I stopped by two weeks ago one weekday evening since I was craving for some pho and it was cold outside. When I came in, there weren't many people there inside; I counted single digits including the workers in the kitchen. I was seated immediately and served some hot tea. I looked at the menu and ordered the barbeque chicken pho. Ten minutes later, my pho came out with a side of vegetables and barbeque chicken. \n\nFor some reason, I thought that the barbeque chicken would be on the pho instead of being plated separately, but that's a non-issue. I dug in and sampled the broth first and I was surprised by the strong taste. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it is, but it did taste saltier than other phos I've had. Does not taste like the pho that I am used to. I poured in the accompanying vegetables and went for the noodles. The rice noodles were good, and the so were the vegetables. I then moved onto the barbeque chicken (there were eight strips) and I admired the crunchy skin and juicy meat. This was a hearty bowl of pho, and I was pretty full by the end of the meal. \n\nSome observations that I'd like to point is that the pho broth is not like other restaurants, and I have to assume that the pho broth is standardized for other menu items since the protein is coming out as a side. One reason I say that is because I felt that I did not get a taste of chicken from the broth itself. I can't really tell you what the broth is made from, but I don't think it's a chicken-based broth. Also, as an aside, I rather they put the napkins on the table instead of having me flag down the waitress to ask for extra napkins, but I think that's a common practice in Chinatown restaurants. \n\nIn my opinion, the pho itself is a three, but really the saving grace here was the barbeque chicken. There was a generous helping of barbeque chicken and it helped balance out my mild dislike of pho broth. Therefore, I am awarding a plus one based on how good the barbeque chicken is. In my opinion, I think you can get better pho in Chinatown for nine dollars. The taste of the broth sort of turned me off, and I don't think I would come back for the pho. However, the barbeque chicken tells me that the other non-pho dishes in this restaurant are worth exploring.", "author": "Nelson X."}

First off, the customers dining in when I visited recently were all non-Asian.  At a peak dinner hour that should have raised a red flag, but I stayed anyway because I was hungry and I was curious.  I had just hiked down from Van Ness Avenue and Sacramento Street after volunteering at a One Brick event, and not having had lunch I was starved.\n\nWhen I heard the gentleman seated adjacent to me carry on in loud conversation to both his dining companion and before him to the waitress that his chow fun was nothing like chow fun he had ordered at other restaurants that should have been the second red flag.  By the way the waitress snapped back with a bit of attitude telling the senior gentleman that THAT was the way they prepared THEIR chow fun.\n\nFrom hearing that I knew I wasn't ordering chow fun so I decided on one of their combination rice plates instead.  I thought I was going with a safer choice by selecting the combination rice plate with grilled pork chop, lemongrass chicken and a fried egg.  There was a television turned to the local news so that kept me occupied as I waited for my food.\n\nThe kitchen worked at a snail's pace, and I waited some time before I was presented with this plate of what looked like a very good meal (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IiawLo4puLiRPqYssFC1_w?select=I-8MejlhcLwwSKlQfkBFeA).  Looks can be so deceiving though, and there was no way of telling that from just looking at this plate.\n\nHow was my dinner you ask?\n\nThe rice was overcooked.  Inedible!  I hate mushy rice, and I never understand how a restaurant can mess up on such a simple staple like steamed rice.  When I first learned how to cook, rice was the one thing that came out perfect.  The pickled carrots and daikon wreaked.  Somehow I wouldn't be surprised if somebody told me they used the same vinegar brine over and over again.  It was just plain bad!  The quarter inch thin pork chop was tough and 40 percent of the cut was either bone, fat or sinew.  The two pieces of lemongrass chicken thigh (obviously reheated in a microwave) were the size of two thumbs.  The fried egg was overcooked.  If there was one redeeming quality on this entire plate of food it was probably that the lettuce leaf was fresh and the two slices of room temperature cucumber were crunchy.\n\nThe service was awful too.  Even though I threw in the towel or in this case my napkin onto the dinner plate very quickly the waitress walked by twice staring down on my table without bringing me my check.  I had to walk up to their little counter, ask for my check then wait for the only person capable of handling the cash register to arrive before I could pay and get change.\n\nThe only thing this visit did for me was it quieted my growling intestines long enough for me to take the short walk up to Golden Boy Pizza where I pigged out on delicious pizza squares instead.  \n\nCheap food - yes!  Edible food - no!  Never again, Pho Vung Tau!!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

This evening I called for take out and was looking forward to a great meal. I picked up my order 15 minutes after calling it in. When I got home and was ready to eat, I ordered No. 43, BBQ chicken/Imperial rolls vermicelli, I saw five small charred pieces of BBQ chicken and six small inch sized, burnt imperial rolls on a bed of rice noodles, one small chopped lettuce leaf, a few pieces of bean sprouts, cucumbers and maybe four tiny pieces of mint leaves. I was disappointed, that small, charcoal order was almost $10.00 (including tax). I also ordered the No. 10, BBQ beef sandwich, another disappointment.  A few small strips of BBQ beef, a pinch of pickled carrots and turnip folded into a french roll, which was decent.  I will never order another sandwich from this place again. I would drive over to Larkin St. where a couple of decent Vietnamese bahn mi shops are located. I'm not to sure about eating at the restaurant ever again, if I do, I will definitely ask them not to burn or char my food, again.", "author": "Gina L."}

The pork is very thinly sliced but marinated and tasty. The problem is the \"lumpia-size\" rolls. Tiny like those brass Thai nails on Thai dancers!

The meat is some sort of chopped up marinated goodness with crab paste. I've tried Bun Rieu at the two other pho places nearby, and I'm pretty sure Pho Vung Tau's Bun Rieu is not as authentic as it should be after wiki-ing the ingredients. Still, I think it's my favorite one. One of these days, I'll need to try the Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup), but it's hard for me to stray from my usual deliciousness.. \n\nRainy days make me think of that delicious soup and I can't help heading over to PVT. Even when they're packed during lunch service, the wait is never too long. The service is friendly and fast, food affordable and delicious. They will kick people out fast if others are waiting, but when there's no rush, you could sit there for a bit with some tea. The island decor/wallpaper is interesting.

My friend Natasha and I decided to head for Vietnamese food though, gosh darn it, and I'm glad we did. What a nice little place! I am also partial to their tropical themed-signs and the palm-tree and grass-hut festooned wall hanging inside. What can I say, I'm a sucker for am-bience.\n\n\n\nI tried the Satay Seafood Soup. It tasted like an Indonesian riff on your usual Vietnamese rice noodle soup and was really very tasty indeed, with a nice spicy hit of coconut milk and (what seemed) like a little bit of peanut. Seafood was plentiful, if a little heavy on the fish cakes. As it happens, I love me some fish cakes, so this was by no means a bad thing.\n\n\n\nWe shared the Shrimp Salad, a pretty classic Vietnamese salad composed of cabbage, pickled carrot and radish, fried shallot, and peanut, as well as mint and cilantro. This came with a nice light fish sauce dressing and was a good cool counterpoint to the soups.\n\nNatasha had the Vermicelli Bowl With Beef. This was one of the most humongo vermicelli bowls I've ever encountered, and she said the beef was tender and delicious.\n\nPho Vung Tau is a nice option for Vietnamese food in the depths of Chinatown.
