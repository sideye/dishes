Golden Horse is probably my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurant for no-frills, affordable, and quality Cantonese Chinese food.  I used to come here quite a bit with my grandparents since they live so close, both for banquet-style dinners and occasional family-style lunches.  The restaurant has been around for like 30-40 years, and not much has changed it seems.  There is a new Kettlebell Gym that opened up next door, and a Trader's Joe across the street.\n\nI came here with grandma, her caretaker, my uncle, and my wife and sister for lunch.  We ordered some of our usual favorites and they were all cooked and flavored perfectly.  No MSG since none of us got thirsty after the meal either.  Lunch including tax and tip was $80 with plenty of leftovers!\n\nPeking Ribs - They are really good with sweet and sour pork here, and the Peking Ribs are pretty solid.\n\nTofu and Fish Filet - When he was alive, it was the favorite of grandpa.  The tofu was cut a bit thicker than I remember and the fish having a bit more breading, but overall the flavors were still there.\n\nVeggies - Spinach with preserved eggs and egg whites is a classic, but I like the simple saut\u00e9ed pea sprouts with garlic.\n\nPoached Chicken - Grandma's favorite, and you can get the version that's juicier with that ginger-scallion soy.\n\nBeef Brisket - I only had a few pieces but they were tender and juicy.\n\nSeafood Fried Rice - This version had a nice, light gravy to keep everything moist.  Nice texture contrast with the shrimp and squid.\n\nNote if you are in a hurry, you can also just order a rice plate at the front - Panda Express Style.  If you are looking for a big dinner with lots of people, they can crank out a multi-course banquet too.", "author": "Daniel C."}

Even when the restaurant is empty (it usually is), we usually go get our own tea because nobody ever comes by.  We usually can see workers or staff in uniform seated on the rear tables playing on their phones as we wait for the check or for tea.\n\nRecently, the owner (or rather, most frequent staff member), Nancy, erupted in a screaming match with our family when we refused to eat or pay for the string beans (they were beyond tough).  A bit disheartening to absorb that; no customer, right or wrong, deserves that treatment, let alone regulars.\n\nUsually the food is okay...not anything spectacular.  That's the main reason I'm not giving a one-star.  Despite being constant patrons, we're not coming here again.  Not worth the trouble and poor customer service.", "author": "Matthew W."}

The problem I find is usually consistency. For example, my all time favorite is sweet & sour pork, but many times the sauce, or the fatty content, or the quantity is completely different than the previous time. I still have my favorite places and Golden Horse is not in my Top 3, but what they lack in fine dining & ambiance they certainly make up with consistency.\n\nLocated in Nob Hill on the borderline of the good neighborhood and the hoodlum it can be overlooked, but if in the area and jonesing for Chinese... look no further! Golden Horse does have a goofy name, but I assure you no horse is used in any dish that I'm aware of, it's simply one of those Chinese astrology good luck type of names.\n\nI have several favorite dishes here, including my sweet & sour (tho I have genetics for gout so no longer), Peking spare ribs, chicken & snowpeas, just to name a few. They also have really good lunch specials straight from the hot table... & cheap too! Yet, it's also a true restaurant where at night time tables open up and that's when I usually order my special occasion crispy duck w/ chips! Really delicious and one of the best bargains in the city! Soups offered with all entrees. Hot tea with a wink. \n\nLastly, if your expectations aren't sky-high then give Golden Horse a try. Tasty \"Cantonese style\" Chinese food at affordable prices. Add friendly service & consistency! This was my go-to restaurant when I lived up the road & I'll recommend this spot to anyone in the hood.", "author": "Eric R."}

The food is inconsistent, and it depends on what you get. Last visit, I got roast pork appetizer, very fatty. I also got combo fried rice, which first came with lettuce cooked in! Disgusting. Sent it back. They replaced in with fried rice that had little tiny, uncleaned salad shrimp in it. The rest of the meat was cut into pieces so small, what little of it there was couldn't be tasted! The owners of this restaurant have made a fortune, considering its location, and the fact that it is always full when I go there. Like a number of privately owned restaurants in the city, they are only concerned with profit, and not giving customers quality food at a fair price.", "author": "Ebony S."}

While we were walking to Trader Joe's one evening, we decided to go into this place.\n\nIt's a small Chinese restaurant.  There are hundreds of them in the area, and this one isn't much different. I was surprised at how friendly the people were.  Precious likes to cook, and she frequently talks up people about food preparation and recipes down to what type of oil and spices are used.  The server was flashed a smile and eagerly participated in the conversation.\n\nWhen the food came it was good.  Precious go steamed clams and some steamed vegetables.  Both were good.  I got the chicken with cashew nuts as I always do.  It was good.  The only problem is that the cashew nuts weren't roasted.  They were just thrown on top as an afterthought, but it was good.

My mom and I had been loyal customers of Golden Horse for a long time. The food was decent and at a good price. But the food has been going downhill while the price continues to climb. We come here because it is close to home and there are no other Chinese restaurants around this area. Recently, my family and I were served beans that were so old that we could NOT eat them. I showed the server, Nancy the plate of uneaten beans at the end of the meal and simply asked for a discount due to the  inedible beans (and because we had eaten the shrimp from the dish). She said NO because we should have told her about this at the beginning of the meal. I tried to reason with her, but her voice escalated to the point where I just wanted to leave. One should never question a loyal customer and especially one who never complains! Whoever coined the phrase, \"The customer is always right\" would get a lashing here. You would slink away with your tail tucked between your legs after meeting the fury of Nancy. Another thing that I think is super rude is that Nancy impatiently hovers over you while you count out your money after a meal, but doesn't give you the time of day and hardly ever comes by to check on you any time during the meal. Don't come here if you want good service, you will be sorely disappointed.

Judging from all the Cantonese families I saw around, one or two of which were celebrating a NY dinner, and all the chatter from customers and staff alike, the spot should be legit, so I'm giving them a 3. However, be warned, as I ordered some snow pea shoots (dau miu/dou miao) with garlic, and they served us a  mound full of somewhat sickly-looking veggies, with patches of yellowing. No restaurant should serve their customers vegetables like this, grr. I suspect they may have advised others to not buy their expiring pea shoots, as we didn't see anyone else with it, even though the waitress said they were good today. :P\n\nThe pork and taro clay pot was interesting but not what I expected. It uses fatty cuts of belly, like in mei cai kou rou / mui choy kau yuk, but layered with taro, all on some lettuce in the clay pot. Not bad, but I was hoping the taro would be nice large chunks, not something that was closer to mashed potatoes when you dug into it. Definitely a heavy fatty dish; probably wouldn't get it again.\n\nThe pork and snow cabbage soup was a pleasant surprise. The toppings were nice (pork, seaweed, cabbage, and a surprising amount of bean sprouts), and the soup not starched up the wazoo like Americanized Asian soups are. Although instead of starch to thicken it, it had a ton of rice noodles underneath the toppings. Wish it had a bit less noodles and more broth; we had tons of noodles left, which also soaked up quite a bit of soup. An order of that could easily fill someone up and then some.", "author": "Linus W."}

I believe it was $168 for all dishes below.\n\nBbq combo platter - Good variety. It had duck, ribs, bbq pork and my favorite, jellyfish! \n\nShredded abalone and chicken soup - In need of a little more flavor. The soup had a nice consistency, but I needed to add some salt and lots or white pepper since it was a little bland.\n\nHoney glazed walnut prawns - Prawns were perfectly cooked! A little crispy with a nice blend of creaminess from the mayo and a hint of sweetness from the honey.\n\nBeef steak and scallops in honey black pepper - Beef and scallops were nicely stir fried. Peas still retained a nice crunch.\n\nSquabs meat stir fried with vegetables - A little gamey but I loved the vegetables! Especially the celery! \n\nGolden fried crispy chicken (whole) - This dish can be on the drier side in general. I ate a piece of dark meat which retained it's juiciness, but the white meat looked a little dry. My little cousins loved the chips!\n\nGinger scallion lobster and crab - The set menu we got said Lobsters in supreme sauce. Knowing my parents and how they prefer crab over lobster, they probably swapped out one of the lobsters for crab and asked to make it with ginger and scallions. This is one of my favorite dishes! We got a whole lobster and a whole crab. Sooo good! \n\nBraised sea cucumber with black mushroom - I don't like sea cucumber but I love lettuce and mushrooms! I kept picking at this dish after I was full!\n\nSteamed live whole fish - Another one of my favorite dishes! I love fish when it's steamed with soy sauce, ginger, etc. It's normally so moist! But this one was a little overcooked so it was a little disappointing. Plus the fish was on the smaller side. At least it came at the end when I was pretty much full.\n\nBraised yee foo noodle - I didn't really eat this dish so I can't comment on it. One of my cousins took the sauce from our fish dish and mixed it with the noodles. Said it was delicious that way!\n\nRed bean dessert - I didn't have this either since I'm not a huge fan of these soupy Chinese desserts.

The only thing I can say they have going for them is that it's consistently decent Chinese food at a good price. Their sesame chicken used to be fantastic. But now it's filled with pieces that are very tough and end up being discarded. I politely asked them last time if they could give me a fresh batch because the chicken has been \"very tough and not very tender.\" The fellow behind the counter was very accommodating as far as his demeanor and response, but I still received \"tough\" pieces of chicken. I did not realize this until I brought it home as it was a to go order, so I didn't have an opportunity to send it back.\n\nI recently called for a to go order at 8:49PM. The woman on the phone said \"We're closed.\" I said, \"I thought you closed at nine.\" She said, \"Our last call is ten minutes before closing.\" I said, it's 8:49. May I please place an order?\" She said \"Sorry.\"\n\nThe only reason I go here is because of the aforementioned decent pricing and that it's close to home. But these are the laziest Chinese restaurant employees I've seen in my life. So I'm caught between going here or to a Chinese restaurant where the service is more efficient and the food costs a couple more dollars per dish. I'm afraid it might be time to move on.

In fact, I think they just charge whatever the hell they feel like charging at the moment when you order. I was at Trader Joe's (across the street), and decided to pop in for some quick take out on my way home. I checked them out on Google first: Their price for a shrimp fried rice on this menu was $5.25 (http://places.singleplatform.com/golden-horse-restaurant/menu?ref=google. Also: http://sanfrancisco.menupages.com/restaurants/golden-horse/menu). OK, $5.25 is REALLY affordable. I wouldn't be surprised if it were more than that. So I went in, and had a look at their printed take-out menu. The price of a shrimp fried rice  on THIS menu was $7.25. I ordered it, still. Of course, when it came out, they charged me $8.50. So, right off the bat, there's a problem here. I was most certainly overcharged, and while $3 isn't going to break the bank, it's the PRINCIPLE here that matters; the outright dishonesty, and attempt to deceive. Beyond this, what I ultimately received, while certainly EDIBLE, was probably only worth about $5.25 in the end. It was nothing special at all: Bland, uninteresting... So, my advice to you all is \"Don't waste your time\". They need to figure out what the hell they're doing there. And they're probably taking you for a fool anyway. Screw them.

He then went back to his \"texting\" and it was impossible to get his attention again. My friend and I ordered two lunch combos. Mine was cold and my buddy's was so so. Upon eating my meal, I spotted a tiny insect running across my table. It was a baby cockroach. That pretty much finished my meal. The server sat there while others cleared tables, and another server came over and offered to box up our food and get our bill, all while our server was pre-occupied with his mobile device. I also mentioned/showed to the lady whom finished up our situation the smashed insect, and she apologized. I suggested that she bring this to the attention of her management, of which she reluctantly agreed.  It's bad enough to received bad service and mediocre food, but to have insect infestation is deplorable. I won't be going back there again anytime soon.", "author": "Timothy L."}

I get the typical stuff like combo fried rice, house special chow mein and ordinary chicken, beef and seafood entrees (a la carte). Portions are large.  The kitchen staff is very efficient -- you get you food quickly and the wait staff are also efficient.\n\nThe place is very spartan and the store front is in need of a long overdue facelift as well.  \n\n\nOh, the boss-man should install a second phone line for the credit card machine so that the staff can take orders over the single line telephone.  Cheap owner(s)!  And this single phone line could pose a security risk for credit and debit card users at this restaurant.

To us, the service is great and family-friendly, but the food can be unpredictable.\n\nEarlier today, I took my daughter with me grocery shopping at the adventurous Cala Foods. Before our shopping, the restaurant was crowded on Sunday midday. I wanted to eat there, but she wanted the food to take home so she can watch the 49ers' game and the conclusion of NASCAR. (Yes and just like me, she loves watching sports on a Sunday.)\n\nWe placed our order, go shopping and come back. One of my daughter's favorites is the Salt & Pepper wings. And one of my favorites is the Vegetarian Fried Rice. Both totaled to $10.50. \n\nWe get eight spicily seasoned fried wings. In the past, we enjoyed the wings from here. But unfortunately the wings from today were a bit dried and had an unusual aftertaste. I was never a big fan of Cala food's meats and I hope the restaurant didn't pick the wrong batch.\n\nOur fried rice had rice (of course), chopped broccoli, water chestnuts, peas, baby-corn and eggs (eggs can be optional). At least, this rice dish we can enjoy and we chose a winner with this dish. \n\nDespite the mediocre meal and being close to our crib, my daughter and I will be eating here again.

So if you are looking for Panda Express or the type of place that you can get chicken chow mein or sweet sour chicken, you will not be happy.  This place is for the authentic chinese taste for those that immigrated to SF many years ago, or really know family style cooking, Chinese American style....\n\n1.  Ambiance - What can I say, this is a small place and drafty as well.  The decor is decidely inexpensive and well, the best chinese places have the worst restrooms, so this place is pretty darn good as far as chinese food goes, which means the restrooms are........\n\n2.  Banquet Size tables - They have three of the large size tables that can seat 8-10 easily. Big Lazy Susan for moving the food around, this makes for a perfect family get together.\n\n3.  The food - Here we go.  This is a chinese restaurant which means that you will find the service to be sub par according to western taste and perhaps abrupt.\n\na.  Fixed Menu - They have three fixed menu for 27.00, 36.00 or 57.00  Each of these has soup and then a variety of meat and seafood.  We had a table of 8 and I ordered the 57.00 menu.  It came with soup of the day, which is the best always.  Steamed Flounder, clams with black bean sauce, crispy chicken, crab with ginger / garlic, bok choy and mushroom, Peking Spare ribs.  As mentioned, the soup is the type that I have a hard time to find outside the SF Community and had to learn to make at home.  Double goiled, fish maw and crab. It is awesome.\n\nb.  Plus - I always order one or two add on to the fixed menu and have tried many, such as:\n\nc.  Beef Chow Fun (Dry) - I always order this for the kids and here it is as good as it gets. The noodles are the right consistency and firmness. The beef if extremely tasty and tender as it melts in your mouth.\n\nd.  Chicken with green onion and ginger - This is my favorite besides the salt baked chicken.  It is a simple dish, which brings out all the best flavors of the chicken and the chef's skill. This is essentially a boiled white chicken, whole or half and cut into bite size pieces that have all the bones in it.  Here it is great.\n\ne.  Steamed black Bass - I always love steamed fish and if the restaurant has a fresh water tank for the fish, I order it.  This time, they had bass and it was very nice. The mixture of steaming it with green onion, cilantro and then the soy sauce and oil is just right. Easy to remove the bone and to chow down on the tasty morsels!\n\n4.  Go back factor - This is my go to place when in town to see friends and family.\n\n5.  If you are from Hong Kong or southeast asia, you may find this place a bit under performing.  If you are a descendant from the Chinese immigration 100-150 years ago, you will know what it means to have this type of food at this restaurant.  Not the typical Panda not the typical fancy asian place, just right for those born in or near Chinatown!!!\n\nGK says, check it out.", "author": "Greg K."}

Unfortunately, it was not ready when we arrived as the previous party was still eating and there were lots of people waiting to be seated.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of stuff...\n\n* Jellyfish and Cold Meats Platter - Beautifully laid out, surprisingly.  I say that because with it being so busy, you'd think it would have come out a bit sloppier.  Jellyfish was good, standard for Chinese restaurants.\n\n* Shark's Fin & Shredded Chicken Soup ($24) - The waitress was messy when she served up this dish. My brothers were offended that most of the soup hit the table.  (It wasn't that much, but she definitely wasn't careful.)\n\n* Squab in Lettuce Cups - A generous amount.  This dish at our restaurants barely has enough for our party of 11, and there were leftovers this time!\n\n* Honey Glazed Walnut Prawns with Mayonnaise Sauce ($9) - One of my favorite dishes and I ate this all up!  Yum!\n\n* Seafood in Mixed Vegetables -  A standard display of calamari, veggies, and a glossy finish.\n\n* Crispy Chicken - I ate the shrimp chips but skipped the chicken.  We had leftovers of this dish to bring home.  Obviously not a favorite for us.\n\n* Steamed Fresh Crab with Garlic Sauce - We're usually a family of crab eaters, but this time it was left untouched.  Once the heads were gone, we had a few crab pickers.  \n\n* Chicken with Salted Fish Fried Rice ($6.25) - I'm not a big fan of fried rice, but my family likes the salted fish variety.  We also had steamed rice, so it wasn't as popular as it could have been if the steam one never showed up.\n\n* Deep Fried Stuffed Bean Curd ($6.75) - Another favorite of mine, especially when it's sauced up.  Good with white rice.\n\n* Steamed Fish - It was on the smaller side of life, which barely fed our family.\n\n* Pork Ribs - I usually skip this, especially the wet ones.  There's usually too much other stuff I'd rather get my fingers on.  \n\n* Long Life Noodles - A big surprise for all of us.  Usually bland and something that you order just because, it was surprisingly good.  Everyone was eating this up and no leftovers here!\n\n* Dessert was red bean soup.  Again, not a favorite of mine and always gets skipped.\n\nOverall, we had a lot of food and a few boxes of leftovers.  Prices were decent and service was just alright.  My family seems to be somewhat pleased with this place because they've been going there a lot in the past few months, so it works.  \n\nI did take photos of some of the dishes before my family members got their chopsticks into it!  Some of the dishes may have been doubled to accommodate our hearty eaters.\n\nUpdate! 05/4/08 - Went back for dinner last night and tried a few other dishes.\n\n* Soup with egg, corn, calamari?, and some other stuff -  Pretty good, I don't know exactly what kind of soup it was, but you can check the pictures to see for yourself.\n\n* Peking Duck - Fatty chunks of duck meat.  They still use the big buns with the red stamp on it!\n\n* Steamed Chicken with Ginger & Scallion Sauce (Half $7.50) - It tastes so good with the sauce!  Ask for extra sauce so you can slather your chicken with it!\n\n* Deep fried fish with snap peas - The fish was a bit dry, it needed some dipping sauce to give it a kick.  \n\n* Dessert was different this time - a coconut based hot sweet soup that was yummy and had us asking for more!  Definitely better than that red bean crap!", "author": "Teri C."}

Still the best go to restaurant for Chinese food. Great great great! place for family dinners. Every chance me and family get we come here for dinner. We usually roll in large groups, so we get seated in the large tables behind the wall which I find very special to sit in because it feels like you have your own dining room. \nThe servers are amazing. The restaurant is family owned, it's usually the same servers and their always cheerful and energetic which really helps bring me into a great mood on gloomy days.\nThe food is awesome! I tried about everything on the menu and this is what I recommend. \nAppetizers:\nHoney-walnut shrimp (best in the city)\nPot-stickers\nFried Oysters\n\nEntrees:\nMongolian Beef\nSichuan Eggplant\nCrispy Pork with sweet and sour sauce\nSeafood over rice\n\nGreat prices and really worth going there for lunch for a quick bite, dinner by yourself or in large groups, and delivery if your just feeling lazy at home.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-05-07", "description": "I am boggled by the fact that some people leave this place 4 or 5-star reviews... never mind that this place has even managed to accumulate 3-and-a-half stars on yelp.  How does this even happen?\n\nMisled by reviews, I urged my boyfriend to dine here with me one evening when we were hungry and in the mood for some favorite dishes.  To be specific, I mostly wanted to come here for the honey walnut glazed prawns since a few people reviewed that they did this \"right.\"  Incorrect. This is not that good. The prawns were dry, the walnuts were charred, and well... I dunno what to say. It's just not \"right.\" So I'm not sure where people get that idea.\n\nWe also ordered hot and sour soup. Why did no one comment before how HORRIBLE this was? This is even more baffling than the 4 and 5-star reviews. It is incredibly insulting that they would even dare to serve such a poor, amateur attempt of hot and sour soup in exchange for money.  The soup tasted absolutely nothing like traditional hot and sour soup.  There is no flavor... unless you count the taste of weak, extremely watered down vinegar (you can hardly even taste the vinegar, and that's just sad), and I didn't detect any pepper in our bowl, much less the taste of any spices.  The soup did have the typical ingredients that make up hot and sour soup, such as egg and tofu, but there were MYSTERY PIECES of meat that were also included.  (Really?!?!)  I think I got some bits of sweetened pork (lit looked oddly red and looked like it was meant for another dish), bits of beef, and shrimp that had an off taste.  The soup, overall, was too light in color in comparison to traditional hot and sour soup - a light, clear pink/red as opposed to a dark, opaque brown.  The broth was also too thin. In order to salvage this soup and make it more palatable, I added soy sauce to mine, and I advised my boyfriend to do the same. He agreed the soy sauce improved it greatly.  If you, for some reason, end up in a situation where you are at this restaurant for reasons beyond your control and you have to stomach this hot and sour soup, you should add soy sauce to yours, too.\n\nMoving along. We were craving a favorite dish, Peking pork spare ribs, so we got that, too.  Another dish gone wrong.  Doesn't have the typical bright red color, doesn't taste the same at ALL. If anything, it reminded me of orange chicken.  Needless to say, Peking pork spare ribs should not be reminiscent of orange chicken.  I don't know what to tell you.\n\nThe service was quick, however... a bit *too* quick. We were seated immediately upon walking in, and 3 minutes later, we got our soup.  A couple minutes after that, the prawns.  The ribs weren't too long, either.  I half-suspected they had these dishes pre-made and heated in a buffet-style table in the back, ready to serve as people order.  You know, on second thought, that wouldn't be too big of an assumption - it explains why things don't really taste the way they should... probably because they pre-make tons of things with similar ingredients and try to pass them all off as different dishes that were made to order.  I suppose this quickness is a plus if you're in a hurry and want something cheap, but don't expect things to taste good.\n\nI often assert that if you don't do it right or well, then don't put it on the fvcking menu - you'll just look like a fool, advertising that you can make such-and-such, then handing guests a pile of crap and expecting them to think it'll pass their expectations (if any).  Then you just end up disappointing people such as myself - the poor, innocent individuals of the world who just want to have a good meal.  That's all. \n\nWhat is the world coming to? In a world filled with many dining options, you people choose to go here? Why?  Cheap Chinese food that is also good DOES exist.  Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.", "author": "Ida T."}

Instead of going to our usual Koi Palace for dinner, we came here for our Christmas dinner instead. After hearing good things about this place from my sis and my future brother in law, I knew it wouldn't be bad at all since he is a picky eater. \n\nThis place is usually packed but when we went, there was just four big tables that were reserved and some tables filled. Lots of people were calling in for pick up so they were actually pretty busy. Place isn't the cleanest but it works for me. The dirtier the place is, the better and more homey the food is.\n\nWe ordered:\nHoney Walnut Shrimp: Good but not the greatest. The shrimp was plump and fried to goodness but had a little too much mayo then I had liked and the walnut looks kinda old.. Didn't have the usual shine..\nSquab: MmMmMMmm juicy, meaty, yummy!!! \nPan Fried Flounder: MUST ORDER. Fried to perfection. MUS MUST HAVE. The crispiness and the freshness of the fish just went perfectly together\nMongolian Beef Noodles: So good.. My numba 2 fav. The noodles had a bit of curry taste/smell to it but it was just so yummy I had two bowls of it!\nCrispy Fried Chicken: Meat was not dry and the skin was super crispy.\nBeef Steak and Scallop in honey sauce: A little too much pepper and not enough beef.

We'd been meaning to try Golden Horse since it's so conveniently across from Cala, but then we learned it delivers! We got ahold of a menu from menuist.com. The delivery was prompt, but the food was only ok. We had:\n\ncrispy chicken - This half chicken was well-fried, but only on the outside, which lead to a high fried surface to meat ratio for the wing, but not for, say, the breast meat. So while the meat was cooked well, it was pretty bland if there wasn't much fried area. We were unsure if this was available just as wings, which would probably be a better option.\n\nstring beans with xo sauce - The xo sauce was a bit overly seafoody to me, and there wasn't much flavor otherwise. The string beans were nice and fresh, though. My dining partner found this dish spicy although I didn't.\n\nmu shu pork - Pretty good, wish a good sauce, but not the most difficult dish, it seems. There was a little piece of gristle in the pork but overall the quality was fine.\n\nmongolian beef chow mein - I agree that the beef here was actually pretty good, and the texture was nice - it wasn't overly cooked and dried out. I wasn't as crazy about the flavor, as I think something licorice-y dominated a bit. The noodles were a little tough, too.\n\nOverall I wouldn't be in a rush to try it again, but I wouldn't rule it out either. I'd like to try the flounder.", "author": "Lisa K."}

This place has been here forever, and I don't here for dinner because of the difficulty in finding parking.  Four large round tables were reserved on the right side of the restaurant.  On the other side of the restaurant, there is seating for smaller parties, and a steam table, with trays filled with food for take out.   In the back, there are tanks for live crab, lobster, black bass and rock cod.\n\nHere's what was ordered (at least from what I remembered):\n-Seafood soup with calamari and minced scallops:  Very good soup.  Not salty, and the calamari and scallops weren't over cooked.\n\n-minced squab with Chinese sausage (lap cheung), and mushrooms, with lettuce cups:  Also very tasty.  Lettuce was fresh and didn't from being washed.\n\n-Walnut Prawns:  I agree with earlier reviewers that the prawns were very plump, and deveined, but a little to mayonnaise-y for my taste.\n\n-Steamed Chicken with Ginger, Scallion, and garlic sauce:  Chicken was done well.  Some people like their steamed a little bit on the red side, but I liked it as it was.  Chicken was warm and very moist.  The sauce was in a separate dish, and was a nice accompaniment to the chicken. If not done right, this sauce can be too salty, but this one was done right.  We did request more sauce.\n\n-stir-fried broccoli with calamari, scallops, and mushrooms:  Fresh broccoli, and again, the seafood were perfectly cooked, and did not have a chewy consistency (like eating an eraser).\n \n-Roast Peking Duck with steamed buns:  Nice crispy skin, and very moist meat.  The duck was cut right before it was served.\n\n-Fried whole flounder:  I personally like my fish steamed, but this place did a good job of frying this flounder.  Fish had a hot oil, soy, ginger, and scallion sauce poured on top of it.  Bony fish, but the meat of the fish was very moist, not dried from being overly fried.\n\n-Mandarin Pork chops:  All pieces were cut about the right size so one didn't have to tear apart larger pieces.  The pork chops had a nice crispy crust on the outside, and were moist on the inside.  This is best eaten when this dish is still hot.\n\n-Coconut soup with tapioca:  Usually by now, everyone is too full to have this.  Not for Sugah Daddy.  A nice, warm, but not overly sweet ending to this lunch.\n\nEach course came out really quick, but not to the point of being served one on top of the other.  Servers were also very prompt in clearing out the empty courses to prepare for the arrival of the next course.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of this place is not much to look at.

Bottom line: the right combination of smells can actually increase a store's sales.  Look it up.\n\nThat being said, if you run a restaurant, you need to be careful about what kind of smells you employ in your sales tactics.  For example, just for example, if your restaurant smells great from the outside, and then all the food sucks, your customers are going to walk away quite disappointed.  Like they've been misled.  They will wander in off the street, following their noses like some kind of cartoon dog (Coooooooooooookie Criiiiiiiisssspppp!), then order some delicious looking food, sit down, and find out IT HAS ALL BEEN ONE BIG LIE, YOU SCAMMING SONNAMABITCH!  The food, they will find, is rubbery and tasteless.  The noodles are limp and ineffective, like Bob Dole's wang.  The BBQ pork is only slightly more chewy than the rubber newspaper dog toy sold at PetsMart.\n\nAnd then, the customer will walk away, shaking his or her head, disappointed and deflated, like a scorned 17-year-old boy on prom night.\n\nI loved you, you bitch!", "author": "Ben P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-06", "description": "REDISCOVERY! \nGolden Horse has been around the neighborhood a long time +20 years but my visit there last night was positive from several aspects.\nFirst, get over the tough parking in the area and if all fails you can always risk the underground parking at Cala's across the street.\n\nOk - Aspect #1 - clean upgraded look, apparently, new owners since 2 yrs have completely remodeled the dining room.  I mean raising the ceiling height and adding crown molding - that is unheard of detailing from a chinese restaurant.  Although the room is not that expansive, you don't feel 'crowded'.  This will give you a clue into Aspect #3.\n\nAspect #2 - Excellent menu selections from typical to the more exotic jellyfish, quail.  However, go to the inside back cover of the menu and choose from 4 preset family dinners ranging from $25.80 - $56.80 and you can't make a mistake here...the portions are not so puny that you have to request double portions.  We attended after a memorial and had two tables and our table had 5 adults and one teenager and we still boxed up 3 takeaways with leftovers.  See below for the family menu we selected.\n\nAspect #3 - One would think and assume that at $32.80 for 6 perfectly cooked and seasoned dishes ($5.47 per dish), it would be portioned for a party of 3 but as I stated in #2, they do not do that.  Plus, my comment about their detailing of the dining room extends to their detailing of the way the food is actually presented on each dish.  I would be easier to tip the wok of perfectly cooked vegetables onto a plate and ring the bell to serve, but they actually took the time to arrange the greens in a circular pattern and the seafood (prawns, squid & mushrooms) add to the overall color of the dish.  Each dish showed the same level of detailing which only adds to an overall positive experience - Bravo!\n\n$32.80 gives you \nSliced pork, salted egg w/ mustard green soup - Very tasty and not too salty.\n\nSpicy salt baked spareribs - similar to salt pepper pork chops, again not over seasoned.\n\nDouble seafood with tender greens = very good presentation\n\nBeef stew and tofu in a clay pot = very yummy and temperature hot\n\nPan fried flounder = crispy and golden, no hint of oil that has 10,000 hours of work.\n\nChinese broccoli (guy lon) with oyster sauce = tender and deep green\n\nI wasn't disappointed that a light dessert did not come with this dinner.\n\nService was excellent and friendly.  \n\nCheck Golden Horse out especially if you haven't been there in the past two years.", "author": "Randall F."}

I'm half Chinese from a Chinese restaurant-owning family so my tastes are Americanized (and then some) but I still know the good stuff when I see it.  \n\nHalf the time what I order isn't on the menu, but like most Chinese places, they're great about making whatever dish you want.  GH has great scallops.  Very fresh and high quality.  Their beef, while still quintessentially Chinese restaurant-esuqe, is less fatty and gristly than most other places.  I love their shrimp dishes.  Their kung-pao shrimp is so tasty that despite its not being nearly spicy enough, and its having peanuts and bell peppers which I don't like, I order it again and again.  I love their bbq pork won ton soup, especially when I'm not feeling so hot.\n\nThe only thing I've really disliked there was their sesame chicken.  I know I should know better and I always cringe when ordering it anywhere, but I LOVE the syrupy fried chicken dish.  That is, I love it when it's actually fried chicken and not disgusting fried bits of God-knows-what as it is at Golden Horse.  I have a theory that Chinese places use dishes like sesame chicken as both a litmus test to weed out the idiots who should be eating at Panda Express and as a way to make money deep frying whatever scraps are kicking 'round the kitchen and serving it to said idiots.  Thankfully, I enjoyed dozens of other dishes before ordering the sesame chicken, so I recognized it for the aberration it was.", "author": "Lauren C."}

Been reading reviews for a year now, and I figure I'll give back to the community that has taught me so much about the city I now live in.  \n\nGolden Horse is reasonably priced.  I believe around $6-$8 for typical fried rice and noodle plates, more for seafood entrees, but it doesn't go above $13 or so unless it's got the expensive stuff in it.  Usually the neighborhood is terrible for parking (Nob Hill), but park in the Cala across the street, and sneak out so they don't know you're not a paying customer.  I doubt they'll care much since since they're getting demolished soon to make way for a Whole Foods with luxury condos above.  \n\nThe food is solid.  Try the rock cod clay pot and won ton soup.  I forget what it's called but it's not the typical won ton soup.  Peep the menu and you'll see what I mean.

The reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because one time, I saw the waitress drop the fortune cookies on the floor and picked it back up to put it into the same can and served it to customers.  I never eat the fortune cookies there, but they have great lunch specials, and they are very nice to all customers.  The food is great.  $5 for a 2-item lunch.  So much cheaper than Panda Express if u were to get chinese food from there. :)", "author": "Amy A."}

Not exactly a gourmet restaurant but a good, authentic place.  You can also order dishes that aren't on the menu (like mustard greens).  I especially enjoy their lychee fried fish and their shrimp egg foo yung.", "author": "Mahogany G."}

Eat there frequently when feeling in the mood for chinese food. Many employees at the hospital nearby order take out and carryout and seem to like the food and service.", "author": "Patrick R."}

Geez! They must think people have stomachs the size of Buddha's!  The service, though not necessarily warm, was brisk and efficient.  The restaurant was the biggest drawback: it was very very dirty and unwelcoming.  Overall, I give it props because the tasty dishes and price point were just what I needed!", "author": "Tova S."}

Because of that I can only say they have excellent service.  But I have been going here sometimes weekly for over 5 years.  Is it the best Chinese Food in SF?  I honestly have no idea.  But they are very pleasant and inexpensively priced.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  You can't beat the price of their lunch buffet.", "author": "Tommy B."}

We enjoyed sauteed shrimp with mixed vegitables and cashew nuts, chicken chow mein, and hot and sour soup.  Everything was tastey and not loaded with salt or overly sauced.  The portions were great and we ate a huge meal and had leftovers for under 30 bucks!  This place is great choice for chinese!", "author": "Sweet C."}

The BF and I went there on a whim after having a drink at Hyde Out.  Our waitress was the only downpoint of the whole experience.  She seemed angry that she was even serving people, exasperated, and just generally annoyed unless she was talking to one of her co-workers.  Whatever, my man and I just laughed about it.  We ordered the Dinner special (the first one) with the two person minimum and that 2 person minimum is a stretch.  The both of us could barely get through half of the chicken chow mien, fried spare ribs, general's chicken, tofu soup and egg rolls.  We had enough to take home and eat for nights.  And our bill? With tip it was around about $30 +/-.  And we spoke with a super sweet man while he boxed up our meal...this place has been around for 15 years.  Yum Yum in your Tum Tum with Bucks left in your wallet (sorry...I know, I know)!", "author": "Veronica S."}

I went to lunch and had the salt and pepper chicken wings for an appetizer-delicious. I had #188 Shredded chicken fried yee foo noodle. It was a huge plate but a little bland nothing a little soy sauce didn't improve and in fact delicious enough to eat the huge plate. There were a few weird mushrooms on it which I gave to my friend. He said they were bland. My friend had #21 rice plate with sliced cod with greens on rice. He said it was delicious and they give a huge plate with a lot of rice. They also gave us some seaweed shrimp soup with tofu-or at least I saw those things in it. There were a lot of asian people eating here which is usually a good sign. I also was expecting it to be a dive but it is actually a nice place. They also have a express line where  you can pick out food and take out or eat there. I would go back again!", "author": "Jack B."}

Their food don't taste as original Chinese restaurant.  Plus food portion for a box of take out is not even full in a box.  You can get better salt and pepper ribs at another place, but not here.  I suggest walking down a few more blocks to Chinatown to get much delicious food.", "author": "YELP U."}
