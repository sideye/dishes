Would be great for business lunches/dinners or dates (but maybe not the first one XP).\n\nI picked this spot for a team lunch and was able to make the reservation for our party of 8 for a noon lunch on Wed just the day before. I appreciated their flexibility as I was scrambling to find a last minute lunch spot to accommodate our larger group. Note that for larger groups, they do ask for a credit card number when you make the reservation.\n\nNote: don't get this restaurant confused with its sister restaurant Barbacco, which is more casual and comes at a slightly lower price point. Even though I was trying to avoid making this mistake, I still somehow made reservations at Barbacco first. Whoops.\n\nThey start out the meal with small thin breadsticks, which I've never seen before. These were just okay, but I wasn't a huge fan of the long and thin shape. Also I thought they were slightly dry, even with the provided sauce.\n\nLuckily they followed this up with some delicious bread. I'm not sure exactly what type of bread it was (our guess was focaccia), but it was very light and soft. When they came around to offer seconds of this bread, I went for it with no doubt or hesitation.\n\nI asked our server about their most popular dishes, and according to her, the pappardelle ($24) is the most popular dish here. It comes with slow cooked short rib ragu, young onion, and horseradish sprinkled on top. It came served piping hot, and while I didn't like the wasabi flavors on top, it was otherwise a very solid and filling dish. The pappardelle was thin and didn't stick to each other, which made it easy to eat.\n\nFor dessert, we shared two orders of the amaretti panna cotta ($11), which is served with roasted roasted peach preserve, almonds, maple caramel, and peach sorbetto. It was light and creamy and provided the perfect light and sweet ending to a heavy carb meal.", "author": "Dianna H."}

And with the recent influx of deliciously affordable pasta shops in the city, Perbacco just kept getting pushed further and further down the list.\n\nBut, having the opportunity to nab a company-sponsored meal several weeks back, Perbacco popped back up on my radar, making it the first time I took a proper look at their menu: to my surprise, their pastas averaged $20, like many other restaurants here, but with an additional choice between \"smaller\" and larger portions.\n\nThe other surprise came when we dug into the actual food: unlike most restaurants here, their pasta is surprisingly light. Not bland, mind you, but lighter and more flavorful than you'd expect from pasta served up in America, which often tend to be heavy-handed with butter, cream, and other seasonings. The highlights of the night were the tajarin and agnolotti, both of which I'd highly recommend.\n\nAnd while they still don't topple my other picks in the city, there's definitely a time and place (and mood) for the style of pasta here, so I'm absolutely adding Perbacco into the rotation.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Spacious restaurant with plenty of accessible seating options.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

It was more than we should order for two people. If I had to pick, I'd get the octopus and the carrots, since the burrata cheese is good, but not extraordinary in any way (the octopus is always great and I order it every time!) \n\nFor the pastas, we ordered the agnolotti and the tajarin. Initially, they had accidentally served us the agnolotti with short rib instead of the one on the menu (filled with roasted meats and vegetables). We hadn't even noticed the error, but the quickly brought us the correct pasta and told us to keep the original as well since we had started eating it. 5/5 for handling the situation very gracefully and quickly without us even noticing. (Servers are well trained for details in general- every time I'd use the restroom, my napkin would be neatly folded when I'd come back- something many more high-end restaurants in SF still need to do).\n\nWe liked both the agnolottis more than the tajarin. I like thin tagliatelle but I don't think the veal and the sauce went very well with it. \n\nThe agnolotti filled with roasted meats and vegetables was definitely our favorite pasta. \n\nThe best part of Perbacco is definitely the desserts. We got the dark chocolate bonet along with the vanilla bean panna cotta. I can't compare the two since they're both amazing. \n\nThe vanilla cream, the brownies and the berries help enhance every bite of the bonet, which would have been amazing on its own. My usual style is to take a little bit of the vanilla cream and the brownie with a decent chunk of chocolate bonet to have an explosion of happy tastes in your mouth. I'm already hungry writing this review now. \n\nThe vanilla bean panna cotta is also delicious and works really well with the strawberry-rhubarb preserve and the lime sorbetto, which fills your mouth with a light, refreshing taste after the main courses. \n\nWe were there for four hours and enjoyed it thoroughly. Will come back for a fourth time.", "author": "Karanveer M."}

The roasted fig dessert with seasonal berries with a side of basil gelato was very disappointing. The berry juice was drizzled on what tasted like pieces of stale/dry bread. This was not easy to eat or appetizing and I'm surprised this even made it on the menu. The roasted figs were chewy and distantly resembled the fresh figs I was imagining when I ordered this dessert.

The accounting of my holiday season binge eating adventures cannot be complete without a review of Perbacco.  I cannot believe that I haven't written a review yet! This is a go-to date night spot because of how wonderful it is--coupled with the relative ease getting a seat without a reservation if dining after 7:30pm most nights.  If not, you can most likely get into Barbacco next door--again, with relative ease after 7:00pm-7:30pm.\n\nVibrant and bustling, Perbacco is always a solid bet for excellent Italian food.  You can rely on them to have the highest quality ingredients, perfectly balanced flavors, and the most delightful homemade pasta outside of an Italian mother's kitchen. I also rarely comment on the wine lists, but Perbacco has an approachable and unique selection of wines.  I find ordering wine here to be extra fun.\n\nService is also excellent at Perbacco.  The staff is highly trained and knowledgeable.  They are also very kind, friendly, and expert multi-taskers.\n\nWhile I'd have to go back into the archives of my brain to recount all the specific dishes I have had for you, let me assure you that as a Bay Area native who has recently toured Italy for almost a month, Perbacco has Italian food that was better than a lot of places I tried in Italy.  Most recently, I had a squid ink pasta with octopus ragu and fresh seafood.  It was to die for.  Husband Bear isn't as pasta obsessed as I am, so he often gets protein centered dishes at Perbacco.

This restaurant was on my list to try in the city for some time now, so I went in happily during their dinner service. \n\nPerbacco is located on California Street in the Financial District area of San Francisco. It's not hard to find. It's in between Tadich Grill and Barbacco. (Barbacco is owned by the same restaurant group. Also Italian fare.) There's plenty of parking at the Embarcadero Center parking garage or you can use their Valet parking at the front. Street parking is always an option too. \n\nPerbacco is on the high end spectrum of Italian cuisine. I believe their other Italian restaurant next door (Barbacco) is more on the affordable level of dining. The interior decor does match the grander level that I expected. There's a bar area by the front hostess for drinks and snacks. (I believe that they have a pretty good Happy Hour during the weekday.) The downstairs is cozy with many tables and a half open kitchen. They also have an upstairs dining area for a more intimate atmosphere. Our server was friendly and helpful. I knew the dishes I wanted so I ordered right away. In addition to the dishes we ordered, we were also given a couple of complimentary items which was appreciated. A lot of Italian restaurants don't offer complimentary bread anymore so that was a nice touch. Overall, this was a good place to go for higher quality Italian cuisine, but nothing really stood out to me out of the dishes we ordered. I would go again if I was in this area and craving Italian. I would probably try Barbacco next door also since I haven't been yet. \n\nPiastra Roasted Octopus : This was good. Not too chewy. The veal tongue was ok. The flavor was a bit bland though. \n\nPappardelle : This was good. The pasta was al dent\u00e9. The goat ragu tasted a bit too gamey for me. I'd probably try the Tajarin next time. \n\nHalibut \"Alla Piastra\" : This was good. I liked the flavor of the black olive aioli. The halibut was cooked nicely.

We shared family style, so nothing became over whelming in taste.\n\nStuff grilled squid- Pretty good. There aren't many places that make a dish like this, so I appreciate it when I can get it. \n\nChicken wings- It was okay. It was very saucy. A little bit too sweet and zesty for my liking. It was accompanied by a spicy mayo like sauce, but I felt that the wings already had enough sauce- if not too much.\n\nAgnolotti dal plin- Very interesting. It was a bit dry on the inside. Perhaps it needed a little more sauce. \n\nTajarin- I enjoyed this a little bit more than the other pasta dish. It was more flavorful all around.

Really enjoyed the truffle week menu :)\n\nThe pappardelle, the tajarin, and the short rib ravioli were all amazing. The scallop was nicely tender, and the duck was done very well. Back when I was doing Meatless Mondays, they were very accommodating and whipped up a lovely mushroom risotto. Desserts are super solid - we enjoyed the brown butter cake, but I thought the cocoa nibs detracted from the dish.\n\nEverything is executed well and tastes great.

We were quickly seated at a booth and our hostess struck up conversation while we waited beforehand. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is spacious and doesn't feel like you're jam packed with the other tables. It's always nice when San Francisco restaurants actually let you hear the person across from you, and somehow maintain reasonable prices.\n\nOur waiter gave some great recommendations, and overall provided phenomenal service. They brought some interesting pocky-like crackers with salsa to start, then bread and butter to follow (complimentary of course). \n\nI ordered the Agnolotti and my lady ordered the gnocchi. The gnocchi was good, but the Agnolotti was absolutely outstanding. Far and above the best stuffed pasta I've ever had.\n\nBasically, it's a three dimensional triangle stuffed with a delicious mix of pork, quail, rabbit, and veal that is bursting with flavor. Typically stuffed pastas have weak portions, but this plate was literally filled with little stuffed dumplings. \n\nThe pasta is decadent, with the overflow juice from the meat stuffing serves as the sauce for the dish. The handmade pasta gives it a slightly al dente bite which creates a phenomenal texture. \n\nAll this for a $22-23 price tag for an entree? Pretty unreal if you ask me.", "author": "Armand F."}

Came with a friend on a Saturday night with an 8pm reservation.  Even at that hour, it was pretty busy.\n\nServers were very attentive, frequently checking in to make sure we were enjoying our meal, had water or wine in our glasses, or if we wanted a piece of bread.  Breadsticks with pesto are complimentary and rolls are available upon request.  \n\nBased on other reviews and recommendations, my friend and I shared the following:\n- PIASTRA ROASTED OCTOPUS- olive oil potatoes were divine and the salsa cruda added a refreshing taste to the dish.  Was kinda sad that the octopus was slightly overcooked and therefore a bit tough to chew, because the flavors were excellent.\n- AGNOLOTTI DAL PLIN- apparently when you come here, you need to order the pasta.  The agnolotti was the first recommendation followed by the pappardelle, so we went with agnolotti.  The meat and cabbage filling made the agnolotti very savory and surprisingly filling but delicious!  Hands down our favorite course of the evening!  Note that all pasta dishes come in two sizes- we went with the larger portion but honestly I think we might have been alright with the smaller one, given how rich this dish was.\n- BEEF SHORT RIB BRAISED WITH RED WINE- very tender (that it was easy to pull apart), not too fatty, and packed with lot of bold rich flavors.  Vegetables well cooked and the light sunchoke passatina provided a light contrast with the heavy short rib.  Thankfully the portion wasn't too big- I think I could have eaten it alone if it was the only thing I ordered.\n- SPUMONI- highly recommended by the waiter and a great choice.  The mousse was smooth and creamy, but not too sweet or heavy on the tongue, with the toasted pistachio butter and candied strawberries providing a bit of texture to the dish.  Strawberry sorbet gave the dish an extra sweetness and acidity.  \n\nAll together, along with a bottle of wine, down the middle it cost little more than $80 (probably far less without the wine).\n\nSolid spot in FiDi if you want classy Italian food.  Think it would be great for work lunches/ dinners.  Definitely recommend family style so you can taste a little of everything, and ordering a pasta is a must!

The langaroli is kind of like a ravioli and is filled with short rib as well but the texture is more grainy, like the meat was ground up and mixed with other stuff. Also, bread is available upon request. It's served with good quality butter as well.  For dessert we shared a crostatina, which is like a little tart. It had sesame custard and was topped with a berry jam. Tasted a lot like an elevated pb&j--yum!!\nOverall I'm a huge fan of this place. It's definitely on the fancy side but not restrictively so.

There was a bar, some high top seating, and some booths near the front entrance; while we were waiting for a table to open up in the main dining room, the hostess informed us that if we were willing to settle for the booth closest to the door/hostess station, we could be seated immediately.

For an entr\u00e9e I got the agnolotti dal plin, since I was in the mood for pasta but still wanted meat (I think there were a lot more pasta dishes without meat, which would be good for vegetarian diners); it was a bit too salty for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-17", "description": "I have been Perbacco for happy hours and dinner and have enjoyed it on most occasions! I have tried a lot of their appetizers and personally think the Salumi platter is only good for big groups, if you aren't in a big group I suggest the fritto misto (basically a calamari but with hella vegetables breaded). The rest of the appetizers seem more like sides or are priced more like main courses! \n\nLast time I was here, I loved the Short rib ragu last time, but it wasn't there any more as the menu changes seasonly - but they always have a few short rib dishes. Here's what I tried this time (only short rib dishes): \n-Pan Seered Beef Loin and Braised Short Rib: Short rib was an after thought, but beef loin was very flavorful.  \n-Plin Al Brasato (short rib pasta): If you like short rib, I would order this pasta if you like your pasta filled with a different kind of protein. Short rib with pasta is a very interesting combo, but the soft with the slightly meaty texture is a great pairing!\n\nWhen it comes to their COCKTAILS, I will divide it between these categories ($12 a piece):\nThe STRONG/LETS GET TURNT DRINKS: \n-Nord & Sud: Kind of like an old fashioned, but heavy on bitters. Good for your money. \n-Hemmingwaywish: RUM RUM AND RUM. Oh baby, you'll light a fire under your ass (in a good way) with this one. \n\nA weekday drink (get you through the week, but not too wastey): \n-Midnight Dream - tequila and chartreuse is a perfect strong yet sweet combo! (Personal fave)\n-Strega Chinita - vermouth and applejack - strong after taste, but great aroma! \n\nBiatch drinks yet yummy: \n-Perbacco - Um where is the alcohol in this?

I'm right towards the end of a Whole30 (an elimination diet where you eat lots of meat, eggs, seafood, veggies, fruits and natural fats - but no dairy, gluten, soy, legumes, added sugar, alcohol, etc.) Eating out can often be a nightmare on whole 30, because generally so many of the off-limits items are hidden in food that you wouldn't expect it to be (e.g., sugar added to your mustard).  So, that being said...\n\nI met a colleague for dinner tonight and we couldn't have been more delighted with our food at the service. I was able to order the seared duck breast, which is grilled simply with olive oil salt and pepper. You wouldn't believe how flavorful it was. The waiter recommended a market fresh salad as a better fit than what was listed on the menu (the fig and chicory salad that was listed had a dressing with an off limit ingredient). They put together a fruit plate for me for dessert, and I kid you not the plums and peaches were the best I have ever had. Go here! Go here! Go here!

Service was alright; the waiter was oddly hover-y when we sat down and were clearly in the middle of a discussion and thus not ready to order, but hard to get ahold of later in the evening when we needed him. Nice guy overall though.\n\nAnyway, we shared a bunch of appetizers:\n\n- PESCE CRUDO: Fantastic. Highly recommended.\n- BURRATA: Very good!\n- LITTLE GEMS SALAD (endive and pears): Good, but not as memorable as the others.\n- STONE FRUIT, TOMATO, AND PARMASEAN SALAD: Great combination! \n- BEETS WITH YOGURT: beautiful and yummy. \n\nFor my main course, I got two \"half size\" pastas - I love that you can order half a portion! In theory it's so you can get one as an appetizer, but it's also great if you want a lighter meal... Or want to try more than one pasta! I got the:\n\n- RAVIORA filled with ricotta and lemon, and served in a truffle sauce: AMAZING. Wow. Definitely some of the best pasta I've ever had!\n- PAPPARDELLE with braised short rib ragu - Also very good, but not as good as the raviora. \n\nAll their desserts sound amazing, but after consulting with our waiter, I settled on the LAVENDER BAR, which was delicious. It's basically a small layered mousse/cake that's covered in chocolate, and served cut in half on its side. It was a perfect way to end the night!\n\n(Below: Passover 2016 review)\n--------\n\nCame here for the Italian Passover special menu last week (see photo), which was a lot of fun. I loved how they had specialty Passover-themed cocktails (which didn't taste all that special/unique, but it's such a great concept).\n\nThe food itself ranged from hits to misses, but overall was good. I loved the charoset that they served with matza when we sat down - lots of dates, very Sephardic. The antipasti and the soups were also delicious, particularly the chopped duck liver (amazing), the sweet and sour eggplant (couldn't get enough), and the chicken dumping soup, which looked like matza ball soup but actually had chicken and apple meatballs (delicious - might have to copy this for our own Passover next year...).\n\nHowever, the main dishes were totally unmemorable, and the side of broccoli rabe, well, let's just say they took the idea of having bitter herbs at Passover much too seriously. The dessert was good, but super small. Also, I didn't appreciate that our waitress had no idea how to pronounce many of the dishes. I get that this was a special, two day only menu, but it really detracted from the experience, and made it seem much less authentic.\n\nOverall, though, we enjoyed the night, and I love that they went out of their way to create such a special and unique (in San Francisco) menu to celebrate Passover. It was a lot of fun.", "author": "Liz F."}

It's been hyped up for me (and I've been to its sister restaurant Barbacco), but it totally lived up to expectations. I was with a group of six and everyone enjoyed the food and service tremendously. We had a couple of appetizers between us, including the octopus, which was perfectly cooked (i.e. not rubbery at all); the burrata, which was perfectly creamy and paired with delightful asparagus; and a beet salad, which was tasty. To drink, I started with the Aloe and Goodbye cocktail, an unusual combination that felt like a risky order, but turned out to be nicely refreshing. And for my main, I split the Raviora and the Quail with my SO - the raviora is a MUST. Meyer lemon + ricotta cheese and mint is an incredible combination. The quail is no slouch either, with a crispy exterior, delicate interior, and perfectly paired mushrooms on the side. Suffice it to say, I will be back.", "author": "Megan B."}

It was so bad you can't hear the person across of you. And you walk out with more of a headache than if you were at a bar. Their air conditioner was broken on another visit but they didn't say anything was wrong today. So maybe they were just saving money and leaving customers to sweat. \n\nThe coujette (small $15) was with asparagus, green garlic and mushrooms. I have had their gnocchi before and it has been really good. But this dish tasted like asparagus baby food. It was one note and the texture was mushy. The mushrooms tasted like asparagus baby food. Even the fresh asparagus tasted like baby food because it was covered in that mushy sauce. So sad to see such awful food come out of what used to be a great kitchen. \n\nThe Tajarine (large $21) looked good but has no flavor this time. I have had this dish multiple times before and it has been amazing. I have had a bad Tajarine before as well but thought maybe that was a fluke. Now I'm wondering if this is the norm. The noodles were still cooked well but the sauce was like eating a meaty pile of no flavor \n\nService was slow. I had my utensils in the side and asked our server to get the dish to go but he ignored is for over 10 minutes. Just because we had a lot of bad food on the table didn't mean we wanted to watch it. And if he were observant I would have thought he would have asked is everything ok. Likely I would have said sure. But he didn't even care to ask. \n\nI'll probably give them another shot but maybe on Saturdays they don't cook as well as other days. Or they assume we don't care how good the experience is because they are busy enough. If that's the case then they should just tell us not to come on Saturdays.  So sad.", "author": "Traci H."}

Booking for a table of 12 was more of a headache than we thought it would be which already left a bad taste in our mouths. First they were pushy about us booking the private room; when we requested the main dining room they made it seem like it would be a huge ordeal...finally the manager relented and said we could have a 6pm reservation but asked us to come 15 min early, then at 6pm on the dot started calling for status updates (we arrived at 6:02pm). I'm sorry, it's Wednesday, early, and you are not the hottest restaurant in SF, you just happened to be convenient location-wise.\n\nThe meal was decent, not amazing by any means given the plethora of incredible Italian places in the SF area (desserts were probably the highlight).

Several clients we were entertaining had empty glasses and I had to flag someone down to get our server to offer another round. (In a corporate dinner like that, should be easy money just to keep those drinks flowing). When our server caught wind of our anxiousness, was passive aggressive to me with her disdain: \"Is there ANYTHING else I can get you? Are you sure?\" smiling through gritted teeth then continuously refilled my glass of wine (2 refills within 5 minutes) even though I was slowly sipping.\n\nAfterwards I felt everyone was underwhelmed and just not blown away by any means by the ambiance, the service, the food. 2 stars at best.

Our main courses were slices of duck breast tender enough to cut with a butter knife and a unique dish called langaroli - thick pasta noodles folded and stuffed with braised short ribs and black truffle butter.

This was a pretty classy place and I made the mistake of wearing a tshirt and shorts last time because I had no idea how nice this place would be.. I didn't make the the mistake this time! I got the Piastra Roasted Octopus as an appetizer and that's probably the best tasting octopus I've ever had. Usually the octopus I eat are very tough and chewy. This one was seriously so soft and tender I felt like I was eating a cloud! I wish the portions were a little bigger because that octopus was sooo good. \n\nThe main dishes included the Gnocchi and the Duck Ravioli. It was nice to have a variety of dishes because they each had such different flavors! The gnocchi had that classic pasta feel to it and then the ravioli had a very rich twist to it since it had duck filling instead of like cheese or beef that I'm usually used to. Seriously, why does duck make everything taste so much better?? I imagine it would've tasted beautifully if I had ordered some red wine as well so I might consider it next time! The portions are actually pretty big unlike other pasta places. Like, there were so many pieces of ravioli and gnocchi I felt it was never going to end haha. Also, the bread is really good (it comes with the meal so eat to your heart's content but don't fill up on it too fast!). A very nice classy place and I definitely would to explore the menu a little more next time! But I'm for sure getting the octopus again... No doubt about that :)", "author": "Patrick C."}

We were seated in a nice corner area and the server was still very attentive and patient despite our indecision. \n\nThe foie gras terrine was definitely the highlight of our meal, we were quite sad when we finished it. She recommended a nice Italian red that we did enjoy (know absolutely nothing about European wines, but we expressed partiality to dry cabs and she helped us along). The one negative is that our server did keep correcting my pronunciation of various dishes (granted I am not French) but that was awkward, and even more confusing when the male server bringing us the food (who seemed very much European and possibly French) pronounced it the same way I did. The duck was arguably better than the short rib but both were satisfactory, and both had a sauce pairing that was absolutely amazing. \n\nThey were oh so sweet and sent along complimentary Italian almond cookies (almost like a meringue but denser) with a \"happy birthday\" note with it, and the persimmon sorbet was absolutely light, refreshing and delicious.

I'm not sure if the blame should go to the server, but he ended up bringing a brand new order that was up to temperature.\n\nHere's what we ingested:\n\nPESCE CRUDO (HAMACHI) (2/5)  Low marks for the hamachi which was ever so slightly fishy and not impressive in the least.\n\nROASTED OCTOPUS - (4/5)  The folks at the table gave this dish a thumbs up.  Very small portion so don't plan to share unless you're a party of two.  \n\nBURRATA W/PERSIMMON (2/5) If an appetizer with burrata is on the menu, we order it.  We've had our share of burrata appetizers.  By comparison, this one is at the bottom of the totem pole.  Underwhelming not only in portion size, but also the cheese lacked flavor and creaminess.  This one I would not recommend.\n\nAGNOLOTTI (3/5) Filled with roasted meat and cabbage, many Yelpers sang its praises.  I liked it but didn't love it.  A bit too one note and salty for me.  After a few bites, you were looking for something else.  Best agnolotti that I've ever tasted came from Il Ristorante di Giorgio Baldi in LA. It's the AGNOLOTTI in CORN TRUFFLE SAUCE.  When you're in LA, please do yourself the favor of getting to that restaurant to eat that specific dish.  Getting back to the point, I would not order the agnolotti again at Perbacco's.\n\nTAGLIATELLE w/VEAL RAGU (3/5)  My daughter didn't complain about this dish, but I'd like to take the opportunity to tell you what was wrong with this pasta dish.  First, the pasta itself was good, very good.  The problem was the veal ragu. It was dry, lacking flavor and uninviting. The ladle-ful of ragu was sitting in the middle of the pasta.  Normally, you would take one forkful of the pasta and the sauce in the center would start naturally start spreading over the plate and onto the unsauced pasta.  But not with this sauce.  It was too dry and not saucy at all, which is one of the biggest reasons this dish doesn't pass the test.  If you're going to put a sauce in the center, it needs to be saucy enough to work itself around the plate.  End of pasta sauce 101 tutorial.\n\nBEEF LOIN & BRAISED SHORT RIB (3/5)  Another just OK dish.  On one side of the plate, one small braised short rib, and on the side was a very small slab of beef loin.  I didn't care for the short rib and I'm hard-pressed to tell you why.  The flavor not there, yes tender, but the sauce wasn't good.  The beef loin was good, and the little there was, I enjoyed it with the horseradish.\n\nPerbacco has great potential, but tonight it wasn't realized.  Maybe this is a restaurant that \n*used * to be good.  I don't know.  But if I base my judgement on last night's experience, it's a three at best.  I wonder if we ordered different things off the menu if that would have impacted our lack luster experience??", "author": "Darien R."}

I believe we were served by 5 different people and all of them are attentive. A plastic wrap was accidentally left in our appetizer plate, when I told the server about it, he apologized and offered if we want to return and be served a new one. I said, it's fine, I just want to let them know. When he returned he said he took it off our tab. I think that was nice. The food quality wasn't really affected by the misplaced wrapper. At the end of out meal we were given free desserts because of the incident, I didn't expect that but it only shows how they value customer service. The food was delicious and our cocktails were unique and refreshing. It was such a nice experience dining with Perbacco.", "author": "Roxanne C."}

I can't pronounce your name or any of the items on your menu, but the pastas here are really some of the best I've had! It was double date night and we had a reservation for 9 pm, but got there around 7. We were absolutely famished and were lucky to be able to be seated immediately upon arrival. The restaurant had a lot of open tables when we arrived, but filled up pretty quick! While waiting for our orders, we had bread sticks and bread with the most delicious pesto dip!\n\nWe ordered the burrata with strawberries as an appetizer and oh my goodness... this was one of the highlights of the meal. The cheese is so delicious with the strawberries and almonds, I think I could eat this every single day! For my entree, I ordered the gnocchi with chestnuts and persimmons (it had a much fancier name, sorry I didn't jot it down). It's not the fluffiest gnocchi I've ever had, but it had really good flavors. I haven't had chestnuts in a pasta dish before, it definitely was interesting! The boyfriend ordered agnolotti (again, it had a much fancier name) and this was really yummy! It was somewhat similar to a ravioli, except it was stuffed with delicious meats! I really enjoyed this dish! The other couple ordered tajarine (these noodles were like fresh ramen noodles, really tasty!) and pappardelle (had short rib and was definitely one of my other favorites of the night). \n\nAt the end of our main courses we were completely stuffed! But for some reason still ordered two desserts to share. I ordered the salted chocolate cake with honeycomb and grapes and cherries. It was very delicious, but heavy. Definitely worth the try! The other couple ordered a panna cotta that had thyme in it. It was very interesting, although I have to say I preferred my cake better!\n\nTL;DR: SF has so many amazing restaurants to try, and Perbacco is one of the ones I'd definitely want to come back to some time!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-06", "description": "Perbacco is a nice upscale Italian restaurant situated in the financial district in SF. You can take a stroll along the Ferry building, see the Bay Bridge from afar, and even drop by the Cupid's Span and then plan a little dinner at Perbacco since it's walking distance.\n\nThe overall ambience of the place was nice. It was chic and modern. One side of the wall were bricks decorated with a span of mirror that ran across. It was nice because if you are sitting on the other side of the table facing the wall you're not just limited to look at the wall. You are able to see the whole restaurant and be immersed in its overall ambience. And I believe ambience is key at any restaurant. The place was dimly lite but not too dark. It gives off a nice romantic feel which isn't bad for an Italian place since it would be perfect to bring your date... Overall I like the overall feel of the restaurant.\n\nTo jump into the food... \n\nMy friend and I started off with their Pesce Crudo (4/5) which was really good. The hamachi was really fresh which was really surprisingly since it's an Italian place. The whole dish had a lot of different flavors going on but surprisingly everything went really well together. I would definitely recommend trying this dish.  \n\nFor our entrees, we got their Duck Rissotto (4/5) and Pappardelle w. Lamb Ragu (4/5). The duck risotto was very creamy and rich and yet had this hint of sweetness that accentuated the dish. The Pappardelle was cooked al dente which I love. I've tried Pappardelle at other places and sometimes it's really bad bc they undercook the pasta but Perbacco was right on with the texture of the dish. I was impressed. The lamb was very tender and moist and wasn't gamey. Both dishes were excellent. \n\nFor dessert we got their Lemon Thyme Panna Cotta (3/5) which was a very pretty dish with an array of fruits and nuts. Loved the side of sorbet which was very refreshing. The panna cotta was good and you could definitely taste the thyme but I've had better. \n\nOur waiter gave us an extra dessert for free! Yay free food! He gave us their Hazel Nut Meringue which was good... there was chunks of hazel nut embedded into the meringue... I can't complain it was free. \n\nTo end the dining experience they also handed out petite four at the end that consisted of chocolate and a nut based chew... it was good but I was uncomfortably full at that point... \n\nOverall it was a nice meal. Our waiter was nice and was very attentive to us. Made sure our wine glasses were full at all times... Oh we ordered a bottle of Barbera upon recommendation from our waiter and it was very good... Yum! :) If you're in the area you should definitely check this place out!", "author": "Stella M."}

Not a deal breaker since Perbacco does get packed after work on the weekdays.  It's a nice place to grab dinner before heading home on BART/MUNI but don't expect to meet clients here as it is almost impossible to carry a conversation through all the noise.\n\nFood was good, but nothing memorable stood out.  Execution of each dish had a few ups and downs, I was expecting a lot from their Pappardelle w/ Shortrib Ragu dish but sadly, it was just ok.  I do appreciate that they properly cooked the fresh pasta though, nice and al dente. \n\nHighlight of the night was definitely the pesto that came with the bread and breadsticks, yum yum!  Our waiter also brought out meringues for the birthday girl which was a nice gesture to end the evening.\n\nI won't go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the area...I may meet up a few friends for drinks and a quick bite.

Very friendly, informative and efficient.  The wait staff that cleared our tables and filled our waters were very attentive and efficient.  The older men in suits helped with carrying out the entrees and there were plenty of staff and help (reminded me of Barbacco where there is plenty of staff and they all work with one another seamlessly!).  Service was excellent!  The wine Armando recommend was great with my dinner.\n\nWe had the beef tartare as the appetizer and it was delicious.  It came with a raw quail egg on top with garlic bread on the side.  YUM.  WAYYY better than the beef carpaccio at Foreign Cinema.  I had the lamb ragu parpadelle (similar to the ragu pasta dish at Barbacco) and BF had the scallops.  Both were amazing.  The side of brussel sprouts was a nice touch.  \n\nMUST ORDER DESSERT.  We had the salted caramel gelato with pinenut cookie.  They also gave us the coffee gelato with another cookie.  I loved both.

Since I had an OpenTable gift card for $100, I thought why not try Perbacco! It's been on my list of places to try for a while now. We had a 6pm reservation on Fri 5/9. Parking was pretty easy. We found a spot a block over a little before 6pm.\n\nComplimentary breadsticks with pesto - I love pesto, but this was just bland! Plus with the crunchy breadsticks it was actually a little messy which I didn't like. Who wants to drip pesto on tablecloths?!\n\nSalumi misti ($29 for a large) - A selection of house cured salumi inspired by traditional piemontese recipes. There was a good amount of meats, but none of them stood out except the pate. They were all a little lackluster and didn't have much flavor. I don't get why this was/is on the 7x7 list.\n\nPesce crudo ($15) - Hamachi, shaved hearts of palm, blood orange, kumquat, serrano pepper. I love hamachi, hearts of palm and serrano pepper. I wasn't sure if I would like the kumquat but it didn't make the dish overly sweet so I didn't mind it.\n\nPiastra roasted octopus and pork belly ($14) - Olive oil crushed potatoes, salsa verde, celery fennel salad. The octopus was a little tough. And I love chewy octopus! The flavors blended well together, but I had a texture problem with this dish.\n\nSeared sea scallops ($31) - Hearts of palm and seasonal citrus ragout, sea urchin, chrysanthemum. Good thing I like hearts of palm cuz it was in this dish too! The scallops were nicely cooked. The sea urchin added a lovely subtle touch.\n\nPappardelle ($19 for a large) - Wide pasta ribbons, slow cooked short rib ragu, grated horseradish. The pasta was perfectly cooked! And the short rib was nicely stewed, but together, something just didn't gel. The sauce didn't seem to bring the meat and pasta together.\n\nDry aged liberty farm duck breast ($28) - Stone fruit radicchio panzanella, basil, apricot duck rillettes. I don't know why, but the duck itself had no flavor. The skin didn't have that nice crispiness I love when it's browned on a pan. Not sure how they cooked it, but maybe it was sous vide and then put on the plate? I also didn't care for the panzanella as it was too sweet.\n\nWolfe ranch quail breast filled with wild mushrooms ($32) - Potato puree, chard, wild mushrooms. I don't really remember this dish so I can't really comment. I do adore mushrooms and chard. And with quail it should be a winning combo.\n\nNew potatoes tossed in herb butter ($6) - Sea salt. The most disappointing dish of the night. I rarely order potatoes as a side but I was craving some buttery carbs so I decided to get this dish. The potatoes were under cooked and underseasoned. Not good at all! \n\nOlive oil panna cotta ($10) - Sprouted almonds, borage, strawberry white balsamic sauce, rhubarb sorbetto. We ordered this based on the recommendation of our server. I liked this dessert better than the one my dad chose. The panna cotta was nice and silky and creamy. The sauce and sorbetto complimented it well.\n\nMascarpone cheesecake ($10) - Pistachio sponge, poached rhubarb, candied kumquats, mandarin sorbetto. I didn't care for this dessert. The cheesecake was lighter than I expected and didn't hold up to the pistachio and fruit flavors. It didn't feel like the cheesecake was the star of the dish.\n\nOur server was nice and attentive through most of the meal. Remember to ask for bread and butter if you want it. I didn't read the menu til we got our Salumi misti and had to find our server to get some bread to go with the dish. I think if you order it they should ask you if you want bread.\n\nI debated giving this place 3 or 3.5 stars. After taking into account the food, service, and price, I'd say Perbacco is a solid 3 stars.", "author": "Elena N."}

Extremely knowledgeable servers who can recite the menu from memory and give excellent recommendations.  Interesting food, with several vegetarian options.  \n\nThe meal starts with breadsticks and some sort of green pesto/garlic dipping sauce.  Both are nice.  They bring boules of bread for each person if desired.  One complaint:  the butter brought with the bread is not butter.  It's margarine.  \n\nThe appetizers were wonderful.  The BURRATA WITH ASPARAGUS AND LEMON BUTTER was a large portion and very tasty.  There was just enough lemon sauce to enjoy with all of the large stalks of asparagus.  The burrata was perfectly creamy. The BIBB LETTUCE SALAD was absolutely delicious with feta cheese, a citrusy dressing and shaved radishes.  Unfortunately there were only about 5 pieces of lettuce.\n\nThe RAVIORA, with fennel scented ricotta, asparagus and a lemon butter sauce, contained house made fresh pasta.  This was a beautiful plate and quite tasty.  Get the full portion size, though, as the half is quite small and only a few dollars less.  \n\nOthers entrees at my table: SLOW ROASTED PORK SHOULDER with PEAR AND WALNUT \"CUGNA\", MUSTARD SEED JUS & POLENTA.  This was touted by a North Italian expert as one of the best, most fulfilling dishes he'd ever had.  He claimed that it the sweetness of the fruit perfectly paired with the tender thick chunk of pork.  \n\nThe OCTOPUS with SQUID INK PASTA was also a hit, despite the waiter's warning that one needed to really love those ingredients to enjoy the dish.  I would have been warned off of it at that point, but my companion chose to forge ahead.  She thought that the breading gave the dish an unusual but delicious and welcome texture.  \n\nThe ROASTED WINTER VEGETABLE / KALE RYE BERRY \"RISOTTO\" & CITRUS GREMOLATA appeared bland and uninteresting.  Likewise, the diner that chose this dish had nothing to say about it.  \n\nFor dessert, we shared the LIME-MEYER LEMON PANNA COTTA with CANDIED CITRON, LEMON CREMA POMEGRANATE SEEDS & SPICED RED WINE SORBETTO, which was perfectly creamy and light, making one feel that it could not possibly be bad for you.  \n\nWe also tried the SALTED DARK CHOCOLATE BONET on ALMOND CAKE with GOLDEN CARAMEL GRAPES, HONEYCOMB & VANILLA CREMA.  While I could take or leave all of the other elements of this dessert, the honeycomb was one of the best tasting and most interesting items I've eaten in a long time.  Flaky, crispy crunchy, airy texture with a rich dark caramel and honey flavor.  Amazing.  Just give me those and I'll be happy.  Beware if you have fillings or caps, as this is a sticky item. \n\nThe ambience, service and food were excellent.  The price is a bit high, but to be expected out of a swank FIDI restaurant.", "author": "Sasha R."}

The food was SO good here - so glad we were able to get last minute resos to Perbacco.\n\nThe pasta here is really, really good - and they come in small or dinner portions so if you're not feeling too hungry, you can still have a taste. I had the Agnolotti (YUM) while others at the table had the Gnocchi, Shortrib Pappardelle, and Risotto. For starters, I had the Peach and Mushroom appetizer and wow - I could have had two more plates of that.\n\nGreat wine selection, including some glasses that you can try through the Corovin method. This is a neat contraption where a slim microscopic needle pierces the cork and allows the wine to drain through - such that the cork is never removed ensuring constant freshness of the wine. It's pricey starting with the one I had at $25 but boy it was good.\n\nService was amazing - my husband had ordered a side of Brussel sprouts and when asked about it, the waiter apologized profusely and said he misunderstood and didn't catch it. We decided not to get it even though he said it would only take a few minutes. We still said no (not maliciously but we were happy with ou plates). Our waiter still brought it out complimentary. That was really great.\n\nDesserts are also good, but the main features at Perbacco really are the pastas.\n\nGreat space: modern, sleek, and actually quite large (two floors).

A tablecloth, and a cocktail.\n\nThat's what I realized the moment I walked into Perbacco's sister restaurant, Barbacco, where we had a dinner reservation for our one grown-up date night in San Francisco.  I just need a good meal, not a fancy restaurant -- or so I'd figured when making our reservation. Who needs pretension? \n\nIt turns out that *I* need pretension...or at least a cocktail list. When we walked into the noisy Barbacco and discovered that they only served beer and wine, we popped next door into the serenity of Barbacco and were thrilled that they were able to seat us.\n\nEven though the restaurant was crowded and noisy, the acoustics meant that we were able to have a quiet conversation without difficulty. The service was excellent -- almost too prompt! We ate a two-course dinner in barely more than an hour.\n\nThe food itself was excellent: we had a delicious fritto misto and salad to start, followed by two very good, meaty pasta dishes. We were grateful that the waiter explained their cuisine comes from a region of Italy known for its meat dishes, since that let us focus our choices. For the same reason, it's not a great choice for vegetarians, even though they have vegetarian options.\n\nI gave the restaurant four instead of five stars simply because it wasn't one of those mind-boggling meals that I'll remember for years. But it really was a very good dinner, in a very good restaurant.\n\nAnd the cocktail -- that I *will* remember for years. Not just because I was grateful for a full bar, but because it was literally the best cocktail I've ever had: the Senza Nome, made from equila, cantaloupe juice, aperol, lime and basil syrup.

Good choice, the cheese was good and tomatoes ripe. Enough to take the edge off without stuffing us. They brought rolls. Roll was very good but I did not ask for another as I did not want to fill up on bread. My friend got halibut. I thought of scallops, I have not had scallops in an age, but when I asked if it was a cream-based sauce the waiter got a little evasive, well, not really a lot of cream blah blah. I got quail. Very good quail. Crisp skin, interior perfectly cooked, with a corn dish and roasted mushrooms. Everything good and very attractively presented.\n\nFor dessert got boccone dolce. They wrote \"happy birthday\" on my plate in chocolate but the dessert was a little disappointing. It looked beautiful but just did not seem to bring out the flavors. The crema had no chocolate flavor and even the ganache had very little. Could they have skimped on chocolate?

Service was average as well so did not make up for the food. Our bill came out to ~$140 for three people which is outrageous. \n\nIn summary, quality and taste were well below average and the food prices are not at all aligned with what they're offering their customers.

They seated us at a four top table at the main aisle near a column.  We had chosen a perfect restaurant to all get together.  Perbacco is upscale in decor, romantically lit but a loud atmosphere with a large space to accommodate a higher capacity of people.\n\nWe brought in a nice bottle of bubbly, and they chilled it for us.  The breadsticks with some dip was a nice touch but, they turned out to be stale.  Our waitress made up for it by bringing fat, warm, soft dinner rolls with our entrees later though.  She was also very patient, personable in dealing with us.  Sometimes when a bunch of us haven't seen each other in a few months, we get very chatty and lose focus on ordering!  I was able to get everyone in line to make up their minds though.  \n\nWe ordered a nice bottle of sav blanc for the table.  As an appetizer, we ordered the Fritto Misto of Shrimp under the recommendation of our waitress for sharing.  It was pretty good and interesting.  I never had green olives tempura style though.  It was a good choice for us though.\n\nI ordered the duck breast with parsnips, radicchio and roasted pears.  It was quite the exquisite dish and a harmonious concoction of flavors.  It was nice to indulge in duck other than the typical Peking style I'm used to.  Two of my gf's ordered sea bass which I did a little quality control on and approved of!  My other friend had the Pappardelle which was wide pasta ribbons with some shortrib ragu.  Omg...  This was amazing, carbolicious pleasure!  Since, she was from out of town, I took hers home with the rest of my entree I didn't finish.\n\nHalfway through the meal, we realized they forgot about our Veuve Clicquot.  They brought it out towards the end which was fine, but by then we couldn't finish or walk out of there overly tipsy!  \n\nI'm not a fan of splitting the bill four ways unless you're armed with cash, but they did it for us.

We dined at the restaurant last night per a friends suggestion that it received almost 5 star reviews and a Zagat rating. We were greeted by a nice enough staff that showed us to our table; however when I asked the hostess if we could just sit one table from where we were she acted as though we asked for a VIP seat at the queens table! No biggie we took our booth at the corner of the restaurant. Next we were given menus, which were extremely difficult to read and understand and we're from the Wine country so we're definitely used to reading upper scale type menus. We were then assisted by our waiter, which took down our appetizer choices a beet salad for me and a beef tar tar for my husband. The beet salad was one of the worst I've ever tasted with shriveled up beets and a very dark and extremely bitter green which I have no idea what it was! I immediately decided I'm not eating this horrible bitter thing they're calling a salad and placed it in front of the table expecting our waiter to immediately notice it since he never even bothered asking how anything tasted after he dropped off the appetizers. However he didn't even notice and the water server who was more attentive to our needs replaced it with what they call their market green salad, which is not on the menu...why I have no idea! The waiter made it sound as though it was a big secret! My husband enjoyed the beef tar tar and I thought it was average. The water server then brought out the market salad, which I did think was very fresh with greens but much too lemony on the dressing. Then came the horrible entrees. I ordered the \"famous\" pappardelle pasta with short rib ragu and my husband ordered the veal chop. First the pappardelle was nothing like I've ever had. It hardly contained any pasta and the ragu was a sweet shredded beef more like a stew than a beef pasta sauce. My husbands vealchop was strange to stay the least with orange zest in the crust which was very overwhelming and made it taste just like Chinese lemon chicken at a mediocre Chinese restaurant...not at all what we expected from this highly rated and in our opinion over rated establishment.

I asked why it took so long to reach over the bar and how come it was empty - there was no response. The bottle had been washed out so I could not show my guest that what we were drinking was really a Tawny 20, and the restaurant had no other bottles.........it all seemed very fishy and we all felt we had been served a sub-standard drink and not what we had ordered. \nThis may all sound snobbish but at $20 a glass I think a wonderful restaurant of this caliber could have managed this situation far better......

Between a party of three we had 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, a cocktail, 1/4 liter of white wine, dessert wine, coffee, and a dessert. The bill with tip came out to a very reasonable $200. Everything was plated beautifully and the portions were pretty spot on. \n\n1. Hamachi crudo with clementine, hearts of palm. Very sashimi-like, ultra fresh fish. \n\n2. Seared octopus with black chanterelles and broad beans. One of our favorites. Extremely fragrant and multi-dimensional dish with the varying textures of the octopus and silky beans. \n\n3. Barley pasta \"rags\" with veal suco and black chanterelles. Another favorite. I'm guessing their housemade pastas are all a standout and have that unmistakable \"toothsome\" fresh texture. Just a tad salty. \n\n4. Suckling pig with brussell sprouts, chestnut spaetzle, persimmon. This meaty dish had different cuts of pork - mostly pork belly. Need I say more?\n\n5. Butternut squash cannelloni on top of a bed of vegetables and black chanterelles - probably the most unimpressive thing we ordered. It was good, but almost too simple. You literally were served two crepe-like cannelloni's with pureed butternut squash.  \n\n6. Almond semi-freddo with chocolate, pomegranates. Beautiful dessert with lots of playful bits and fruity things scattered on the plate. \n\nGreat service, lovely meal!", "author": "Amber M."}

Our server was Tamara and she was nothing short of exceptional in offering good wine pairings as well as guiding us through the menu selections. My wife ordered the gnocchi and I had the braised short rib. Both were exceptional with the gnocchi being light, almost fluffy and served in a beef ragu.

We decided to come here instead of another more fancier and $$$$ place at our original 9:30 reservation time and it definitely was a good idea.\n\nThe meal itself was excellent: we started off with foie gras, Pappardelle, duck breast, and Brussel sprouts, and salted dark chocolate bone. I tried foie gras in the past and didn't really like it but I guess not all foie gras is equal! This restaurant's version was very savory and good. They had a slight acidic sauce with it that was a very nice compliment to the fatty dish. The pappardelle, duck breast, and salted dark chocolate dessert were all phenomenal and I really did savor every single bite. Not sure if some people came on a bad day or something but I seriously enjoyed every bite. The only dish I was disappointed in was the Brussels sprout dish. This restaurant's brussel sprout dish was very salty and burned so that was a big let down ...and a waste of brussel sprouts!!\n\nBut what made this experience a 5 star even with the less than stellar brussels sprout dish was the service. Our server (forgot his name) was just super pleasant and would give us great recommendations (on wine, menu choices). And usually, when customers order things servers don't stop them because larger orders = larger tips (since people calculate it %wise) but our server told us to order slowly one thing at a time and stopped us from ordering too much food.

I had been here before, had a great meal, and my mom enjoys Italian food so decided on this place.\n\nMade OT reservations for 6PM so it wasn't too crowded yet that we were quickly seated as soon as we arrived.  Then while we sat down and ordered, the 2nd level became pretty full filled with a bunch of happy guests.  I noticed they have a private room on the second level with the view of the kitchen.  That's nice!\n\nWe started off with the small Salumi Misti plate.  As I raved about their pasta, my husband and I each had 1/2 order of two different types.  I realized now that I ended up eating the same one: Tajarin (Tagliatelle with 5 hour pork sugo, porcini mushrooms, and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese).  HAHAHAHAA!  So much for trying something new!  Still looked like Japanese ramen noodles, but the sauce was still good.  \n\nMy husband ordered the Tortelli di Aragosta (pasta filled with lobster and polenta), but they brought out the wrong dish so we had to send it back.  It took a few minutes to bring out the correct dish.  Those were shaped like mini wontons, but it was delicious with the cream sauce.  My husband enjoyed it very much.\n\nFor the main course, I had the Branzino (Mediterranean sea bass with matsutake mushrooms in dungeness crab jus).  Pretty big portion of fish, but I ended up eating it all.  Loved the nice clean flavors.  My husband had the Quail filled with chestnuts, braised chards, mushrooms in a huckleberry jus.  Good, but not great.  I would have preferred roasted quail instead of a stuffed one.  My mom had the Pappardelle with the short rib ragu.  It was a little lukewarm when she got it that we had them reheat it.  I had a taste and it was a definitely a meaty ragu, but I liked it.  \n\nOverall, a great meal and decent service.  Only negative was the long wait for our main entrees, but it was Christmas Eve and we did notice servers take full plates back to the kitchen and many staff running around so it must have been a chaotic night for them.\n\nWe ended up taking a bottle of wine so we paid for the $20 corkage fee.

The seemingly simple dish had a slightly smoky char that matched the delicate octopus. The crushed potatoes along with the shaved radish and celery leaves gave the plate a salad-like feel.\n\nAnother lovely salad-like starter combined seasonally fresh sweet peaches with large earthy slabs of grilled porcini mushrooms. The flavors were further enhanced by a thyme-tinged sauce and thick-leafed purslane. Although quite good as is, it might have been better with another element like sweetbreads.\n\nTheir signature dish, the tajarin pasta, didn't impress. The ramen-like tajarin noodles were too thin to hold the diced \"salsiccia di bra\" sausages and didn't want to absorb the sauce. Although full of rich ingredients like a pork sugo, the sauce wasn't luscious, but watery.\n\nThe \"coujette\" entr\u00e9e had large and spongy gnocchi in a sauce of duck, cream, and onion. The menu said \"foie gras butter\" was in the dish, but there was no hint of foie - particularly when the sauce was thin and not rich.\n\nThe atmosphere was not as high-end as I expected with plenty of diners in jeans and sweatjackets.

The boyfriend was so hungry that he ordered TWO dishes! He ordered the pappardelle which was my second favorite dish. The meat melted in your mouth and the sauce was very bold. \n\nI will go back again to taste more of their dishes! So far this experience was A OK, mainly because the service that nice was not what I expected.

I was really happy that they had a booth available for two for a last minute lunch at 1pm. I was equally impressed by the attentiveness of the wait staff who got my drink order before I even had a chance to look at the menu and his attentiveness throughout our meal, filling water glasses and bringing us more bread as soon as we scarfed down the first pieces. Our food came out really quickly but we were quite disappointed with the overall quality, preparation and flavor. The Tajarin (handcut thin tagliatelle, 5 hour pork and porcini mushroom sugo) was like ramen topped with dry sloppy joe meat and the Polpette (meatballs over mashed potatoes and raisins) was a little sweet with too much cinnamon. We only liked the Brussel Sprouts but funny enough both the sprouts (cooked with duck fat) and meatballs (served with marinara and no cinnamon) are way better at Barbacco where the service is not as good! The service at Perbacco is always great, whether lunch, dinner or after dinner drinks and desserts but I'm never wowed by their food anymore. My friends and I used to love their Papperdelle with meat cooked with horseradish but apparently it's not on the menu anymore. If you like mediocre food outstandingly served, topped off with a large bill at the end of your dining experience, go to Perbacco. They won't give you what you bargained for.", "author": "Jen L."}

Once I had some steak at an alumni lunch.  It was under-seasoned and overcooked.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-10", "description": "Came here today with my sis and my cousin for one of our gabathon lunches.  I asked if we could sit upstairs, since it's slightly quieter, and they were quick to accommodate us.  I hadn't been here for several years, like Rene C. and was pleased that I'd come back.  We had come once for an anniversary dinner not that long after they opened and liked it.  I saw more men (and women for that matter) in suits here today than anywhere else for years, but decided not to hold it against them.\n\nFirst the service was just perfect!  Our server totally got us from the start, seemed to know that while we're food lovers, we were also there with a big talking agenda.  She paced things perfectly, didn't rush us, but didn't ignore us either.  I wish I'd gotten her name, so I could give her credit.\n\nI was most intrigued by the appetizers, although there was a smattering in the soup/pasta category that looked good, as did several in the entree section.  I just wasn't up for a full entree course.  One appetizer didn't seem like enough, and two seemed like too many, so I worked out a deal with my sis to share one, and then we each ordered another.\n\nOne order of the beet salad:  Lovely to look at with micro beet greens.  The roots were impeccable, the preparation was a little boring though.  It would have benefitted from something with a tart note.  There were two tiny roasted onions; more would definitely been better.  The three of us all ate this one.\n\nTwo of us got an order of the frito misto.  It included rock shrimp, fennel, green beans, onions, lemon slices, and OLIVES.  Who wouldn't like a deep fried olive.  The server had said there anchovies, and try as I might, I never could locate one of those much coveted little guys.  It came with an uninspired aoli type dip on the side.  The portion was big for an appetizer, and if you weren't making it a main course, as we were, it would definitely cry out to be shared.\n\nOne order of butternut squash ravioli with a brown butter sauce with pomegranite seeds strewn on top.  It looked lovely and the pasta part of it had a lovely texture.  There was something in the brown butter that kind of over exerted itself - sage maybe.  As I've said before, I'm not a big fan of the baked squashes, and this was no exception.  It was too sweet for me, but those who like that sort of stuff said it was good.\n\nWe shared something that I think was called a tarrone for dessert.  Dense dark chocolate with dried apricots and nuts inside.  I liked its rustic quality and the deep chocolaty quality was further emphasized by a chocolate sauce on top.  I probably wouldn't order it again, but the two chocoholics with me seemed to be in heaven.\n\nThe bill including 3 coffees and tax, before tip was $73 - very reasonable!\n\nFood:  36/40\nservice:  20/20\natmosphere/ intangibles:  17/20\nvalue:  18/20\n91/100= A=5 stars, just barely\n\nFrankly, I'm surprised.  If I hadn't used my rating system and just guessed, I think I would have given 4 stars, but given that would I ever give any 5's?\n\nI don't, however like the bathroom arrangement, down two flights into the basement and unisex.

It's kind of a more formal version of its sister restaurant, but the pasta prices aren't significantly more. \n\nThey have a liquor license, but none of the cocktails stood out to me, and I thought wine better matched the meal.  They had many glasses by the glass with a good number of Italian wines.  I thought the glasses were a bit expensive.\n\nStarters: \n1. Pan seared foie gras: with classic accompaniments of brioche (a toasted rectangle) and a cherry compote\n2. Heirloom tomatoes: the tomatoes are in season, but the peach compote with the saltiness of the ricotta salata were awesome together. I used the house bread to soak up the rest of the sauce at the bottom \n3. House bread: free upon request; good flavor, reminded me of the acme baguette in flavor\n\nPastas: the 3 of us ended up doing 2 regular sized pastas and 2 appetizer sized pastas.\n1. Gemelli: squid ink pasta with an octopus and shellfish ragu (shrimp, clams, mussels all out of the shells).  This was probably the lightest of the 3 pastas in terms of fattiness, and it was a good seafood option\n2. Papparadelle: rich, super flavorful slow cooked short rib ragu, which wasn't overly fatty.  The grated horseradish was a really nice contrast.  This dish had tons of flavors going on \n3. Tajarin: I don't usually love thin pastas, but this one was so fresh and had tons of flavor with the porcini mushrooms and pork sugo.  It may have actually been my favorite \n4. Coujette: potato gnocchi (the pillowy soft kind but larger than usual) with a duck ragu and foie gras butter. Needless to say, this one was the heaviest one, so the light nature of the pasta helped. It was a bit rich for me, but it was one of the more interesting gnocchi dishes I've had in a while\n\nSide:\n1. Sugar snap peas: with pea tendrils and a minted pea sauce.  The snap peas were a bit oily, and I couldn't taste much of the pesto.  I would probably skip this one. We felt compelled to get a vegetable to counter the pastas..\n\nDessert: \n1. Citrus mint panna cotta: super smooth, very refreshing.  The mini white donut peaches and blackberries were super sweet, and the peach sorbet was a nice contrast to the panna cotta itself.  This was a really impressive summer dessert. We all thought we were full, but we had no problem finishing it in minutes \n2. Chocolates: for the table at the end (complimentary)\n\nThe bill ended up being less than we had expected since we mostly went for pastas.  If it were up to me, I would do just pasta and nothing else (fresh pasta is a weakness of mine). The server was very helpful when we were trying to portion everything out.\n\nBetween the two, I would say I probably still like Barbacco more, but Perbacco is a different experience and is worth trying.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

I rarely give 5 stars and in this case (although the food was also very good) it was because of the excellent, attentive and friendly service. When something was needed, staff was available. When we wanted additional sides after the main courses were served, they quickly accommodated us. The sommelier was available for recommendation, which I found necessary because the wine \"book\" was extensive, with too many choices. We had seating upstairs and they fortunately have an elevator in addition to stairs, for the less-abled.\n\nThe dish I enjoyed the most was the agnolotti dal plin (small filled pastas in a delicious brown gravy), which I ordered as an entree size, to share with the table (you can order the pastas 2nd course size, which is smaller, or entree size). They were thoughtful to split the serving into two plates, so it was easier to share. Frankly, I could have eaten the whole thing myself (yum!), but I did want others to try it. The papardelle (with short rib ragu sauce) was excellent. I had the crepes (butternut squash, I think) which was very good (finger-licking), creamy and flavorful. Most of our table ordered the duck breast entree, which is not my cup of tea, so I cannot comment on how it tasted, but everyone cleaned their plates completely! Also loved the Brussels sprouts.", "author": "Shan H."}

I walk past Perbacco almost every day for work and I'm so glad I finally stopped in for dinner! \n\nThis place has truly elicious food and is a lot more welcoming/un-stuffy than you would think. The ambiance was definitely on the more formal side, but there was a nice mix of couples/families/and small groups of friends. The Rabaton (ricottta gnocci with mushrooms) was delicious- incredibly light and flavorful. Our waiter was incredibly attentive without being overbearing or hovering. \n\nA note on the portions: I avoided getting the smaller pasta portion for fear that it wouldn't be enough, and the larger size ended up being far too much food.", "author": "Hailey H."}

We were seated on the 2nd floor, which felt really nice and \"personalized\" for our group. Only disappointment was a table away from us, that decided to bring a little kid to dinner, and the parents wouldn't quiet the kid down. Good thing, they were ending their dinner soon. There was a private event going on, also on the 2nd floor, yet they didn't disturb us.\n\nWe had a great and attentive server assigned to us...her name was Alexandra. She was very sweet, personable, knowledgeable and even treated our table to an additional dessert, since she knew that my friend and I were indecisive between 2 desserts. Alexandra thought it would be a nice surprise to serve both desserts, especially because it was my birthday. She gave the best description, when we asked her about a certain entree on the menu.\n\nThe hostess needed to be less snobby, and more friendly. I mean come on... I have received friendlier service in Beverly Hills.....smile and ask how we are doing! :)\n\nThey do change their menu from time to time. \nFor appetizer I got this mushroom type soup, which was a delish grown up version of a cream of mushroom.\nMain entree was a pork loin. I tried their wild salmon, pappardelle and gnocchi, which is also delish.\nMy friend got the butternut squash cannelloni and she wasn't quite happy with it. The texture was a little bit weird for me and my friend was right that it would be better off as a ravioli type of dish. My friend was offered another dish since she barely touched her dish, but she graciously declined the thoughtful offer, and went on eating our friend's pappardelle.", "author": "Abby C."}

J had a class of Pinot Noir which he enjoyed ($14).\n\n7)  Fantastic Appetizers.\n\nMy favorite dish of the night was the freshly made Burrata Cheese.  It was atop a pile of basil sprinkled marinated cherry tomatoes and slices of ripe nectarines.  Summer in a bowl! ($14)\n\nThe Hamachi Appetizer was fresh and elegantly plated.  While I liked the kumquat, fennel, and olive oil drizzled on top, the salty and briny black olives overpowered the fish ($14).\n\n8)  Pastas that are as good as they say!\n\nI ordered two half portions as an entree.  Of the two, I preferred the pillowy soft Potato Gnocchi, with a rather salty Liberty Farm Duck Ragu, and some sliced cherries ($13).  \n\nI also tried the Agnolotti filled with Porcini Mushrooms.  Although I liked the huge mushroom flavor of the Agnolotti itself, I didn't care for its cream sauce and toppings.  While the addition of blueberries and douglas fir needles on top was definitely creative, it didn't meld for me and I felt like I was nibbling on a Christmas tree ($12).  \n\nJ loves rabbit so he tried and devoured the Spinach Pasta \"Rags\" with Devil's Gulch Rabbit Ragu ($13).  \n\n9)  Entrees\n\nIf you aren't a Carbivore like me, there are plenty of Entree options.  J tried the Wolfe Ranch Quail with roasted chanterelles and cipolline onions which he enjoyed ($27).\n\n10)  Elegant Desserts\n\nThey surprised us with Brutti Ma Buoni Cookies on a plate with \"Happy Birthday\" prettily written in chocolate.  Although they are supposedly \"ugly but good,\" these hazelnut filled cookies made of sugary sweet meringue were actually were not ugly at all!  \n\nWe also tried a Goat Cheese Mousse ($9) and a Chocolate Tasting ($10) but honestly I was too full to fully appreciate them. \n\nGrazie Perbacco!\n\n\n\nAT38", "author": "Amy C."}

I have been to this place 5-6 times over the last three years, and it just keeps getting better and better.  First, the service is wonderful.  I always come to SF on business and generally eat alone, so I sit at the bar and order from the regular menu.  The bartenders at Perbacco are great people and know their food, wine and cocktails extremely well.  \n\nAnd oh, the food, the food.  If you are lucky enough to eat at Perbacco while heirloom tomatoes are in season, ORDER THEM.  I have never had such wonderful varieties anywhere, and they will not serve a tomato unless it is at its ripe peak.  The basil, ricotta salata, olive oil and whatever other wonderful goodness they sneak onto the plate is all wonderful.  Their vitello tonnato starter is also a revelation - juicy, rosy and thin slices of roasted veal slathered with a tuna-anchovy mayonnaise.  You must try it. \n\nTheir pastas are the true star here, and frankly I have never ordered an entree as the pastas are just that sensational.  The tajarin with the 5-hour pork sugo, the ravioli filled with braised short ribs and porcini mushrooms and the recently added agnolotti filled with slow cooked pork and hazelnuts in a plum jus are each unique and memorable.  The gnocchi with the gorgonzola fonduta sounds heavy but isn't - the gnocchi are light as a feather and melt on the tongue.  The fillings and sauces here are not only perfect, but the pasta itself is a wonder.  Filled pastas sometimes have great flavor but the pasta turns out gummy - not here.  The pasta itself is always toothsome, light, perfectly cooked and delicious in its own right.\n\nThey have a very nice selection of reds by the glass.  The 2008 Langhe Nebbiolo is superb with any of the pastas mentioned above.  \n\nThe only dessert I have ever had here is the brown butter cake with pistachios.  In a word - YUM.  I hope to return here again and again for years to come.  It is always a terrific experience.  These people love to provide wonderful food and service - an art form.", "author": "Steven H."}

Not a huge portion but a really good dish.

We were very disappointed since we both absolutely love burrata.  The second appetizer we had was the Vitello Tonatto, a slow roasted veal sliced very paper thin slices of veal similar to Carpaccio.

The food was good, but I work with restaurants on a regular basis from a PR and marketing standpoint and I always say, \"You can have good food, but if you don't have the service aspect down you're business is going to suffer.\" I don't care how great the food is, nobody wants to go to a restaurant with bad service.

I came here with my bosses and some coworkers for an 8:00 dinner on a Saturday night. I ordered a tasty cocktail while I waited and we were seated about 30 minutes later.\n\nThey gave us a 6 person high top table right by the open kitchen in the back of the restaurant which I loved. I also adored the overall ambiance of the restaurant, very contemporary, chic, and trendy. Very California in my opinion. Two floors, including a nice bar in the front of the restaurant, very open layout, and on the upstairs floor, a private room for private parties. \n\nNow for the most important part...the food. Fantastic. The moment we sat we were given some breadsticks with pesto sauce. Yum. For a starter I had their burrata which came with pieces of roasted brown sugar coated butternut squash, pomegranates, and arugula. The burrata was absolutely delightful, creamy, milky, and just melted in your mouth. It paired beautifully with the sweet, roasted squash and the fresh and crisp arugula. The pomegranates were a nice and interesting touch, as well. For dinner I had the scallops, I can't even describe how amazing they were. 4 roasted scallops in a herb aioli and red wine jus. The sauces paired exceptionally well with the perfectly cooked scallops. Everything in the dish just came together nicely. Highly recommend this. We also ordered some pan roasted cauliflower and roasted carrots as side dishes. I I never had carrots roasted to the point of being almost black...they were tasty. \n\nFor desert I ended up with the burnt caramel gelato, which was exceptionally sweet and came with vanilla sea salt and some pignoli nut cookies. I couldn't stop eating it! A little sweet, but the sweet paired so well with the salt. \n\nThe wine menu was excellent and the bottles that were chose were perfect. Service was great, the waitress knew the menu very well and was very helpful in picking out dishes and wine. Overall, a great experience, I would highly recommend it.", "author": "Shannon W."}

The restaurant has two floors and the first floor actually accommodates a lot of seating.  I like the dining room.  The low ceiling kind of gives it a more intimate feel and the dining room is contemporary and elegant (nice light colors throughout the room that do not clash).  The restaurant has a really clean and refined feel to it.\n\nPerbacco gets busy at lunch.  Perbacco offers an upscale lunch with pastas and entrees that feature high quality ingredients.  Despite the fine dining menu, the pricing is not that bad.  Almost all of the dishes are below $20 and the portions are surprisingly generous.\n\nFor complimentary items, Perbacco features crispy breadsticks (maybe overly crunchy) and pesto.  They also offer just okay focaccia bread.\n\nI started with the burrata, spring pea and artichoke salad.  The salad was garnished with mint, preserved Meyer lemon, and artichoke crema.  The salad was light and refreshing.  The burrata was creamy and the peas were nice and plump.  The artichokes were tender while the greens were fresh and had a nice fragrance to them.\n\nIt was a nice salad even though none of the elements (or the combined flavor combination) were that special or memorable.\n\nI liked my pasta entr\u00e9e more.  I had the agnoli di conglio, which was ravioli filled with devil's gulch rabbit.  The pasta was tossed with black chanterelles, braised greens and a rabbit jus (and then topped with grated parmesan by the server).  The pasta was very good.  It was nicely thick but not doughy and had a good flavor.  The filling was great--meaty and juicy.\n\nI also really liked the sauce.  Pasta sauces can often just be salty (or just one flavor), but the rabbit jus here had several dimensions to it.  There were definitely salty notes, but the red wine flavor really came across and added a surprising and welcomed light sweetness to the dish.\n\nFor dessert, I had the almond brown butter cake that had a center of lemon curd.  The dessert was garnished with toasted meringue, pate de fruit, strawberries, strawberry sauce, and candied lemon peel.  I thought this was a nice dessert and much more refined than what I've had at several other Italian restaurants.\n\nThe brown butter cake was good and moist.  It had a good crust as well as a good flavor.  The lemon curd was also good--creamy and smooth.  I think it got baked a little too much because there was not as much curd in the center as I was expecting.\n\nI thought the garnishes were good.  I really liked the toasted meringue and I liked both the strawberries and strawberry sauce (they were not too tart).\n\nService was okay.  The servers seemed to be working hard, but there did not seem to be enough staff.  Because Perbacco lists many Italian names/ingredients on their menu, many customers were (not surprisingly) asking a lot of questions.  And this kept the servers from being as attentive as they should be.  The food itself came out at a good pace.\n\nAs mentioned, prices are not that bad considering you can easily go with just one item here (and most of their menu is below $20).\n\nPerbacco is a good upscale lunch spot.  It gets quite busy and it is easy to see why.  Their upscale lunch features a lot of good food and the atmosphere is nice and very welcoming.  I also like nearby Michael Mina and Wayfare Tavern for an upscale lunch, but Perbacco might be the best value of the three.\n\nParking in San Francisco is difficult.  There are several parking lots and parking structures nearby.  You can also find metered street parking along the street adjacent to the Ferry Building.", "author": "Anthony N."}

Our reservation was for 8:30 PM and we arrived on time. We only had to wait a few minutes while the table was being cleared for us.\n\nThe interior is open and modern without being pretentious, while also being intimate. We were seated at a large table (probably large enough to fit four), which I thought was great. There's nothing worse than being crammed into a row of tables for two where the person at the next table is 3 feet away from you, so thank goodness for the seating arrangement. The noise level was moderate: although there were a lot of people talking, you could pretty easily have a conversation with your party.\n\nOur server was attentive and answered our questions well. He also helped me pick out a wine for dinner, even bringing over a couple different ones for me to try until I found one I liked (since I was only having a glass). Every chance he had, he would check up on us and ask us how our food was, let us know the status of our food arrival time, etc. They also fold up your napkins for you when you get up from the table! Cute. :)\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n-- Small salumi misti: a plate of house-cured meats. This was fantastic - if you come here, you MUST get this! I honestly can't remember which meats were which, only that every one of them was insanely good. I liked that they were served with little breadsticks as well as pickled veggies, which cut the richness of the meats nicely to refresh the palate. The pickled carrots didn't even taste like carrots, they just tasted good (and I hate carrots normally).\n\n-- Stracci, half-portion: Spinach pasta \"rags\" with a veal sugo and golden chanterelles. This pasta was so delicious. It was rich and savory while still being light, despite the heartiness of the veal sugo. There were large chunks the chanterelles, which made my tastebuds do the happy dance. BF and I took pieces of the house bread to mop up the sauce, it was so good.\n\n-- Cunij: BF's entree. This was braised rabbit with roasted butternut squash, green apple, and chestnut polenta. I had a couple bites... quite tasty indeed. BF liked it a lot.\n\n-- Quail: my entree. This was a HUGE (and I mean huge for a quail... like the size of a mango) quail breast stuffed with wild mushrooms, served with potato puree, chard, and black chanterelle jus (can you tell I like chanterelle mushrooms?). AMAZING. It was everything I wanted it to be... juicy and savory and just perfect. The chard wasn't even that bitter (like I have known some chard to be) and I liked that the potatoes were pureed - kept things light. And the chanterelle jus? It tied everything together so well. This was a very umami-heavy dish and I loved it. LOVE LOVE LOVE. The portion was very large (BF ate half of the quail to help me out) and I was still really full by the time I \"finished' my plate.\n\n-- Burnt caramel gelato: Quite nice end to the meal. BF and I shared this, although I ate 70% of it by myself. Nice smoky, earthy notes and enough sea salt sprinkled on and in it to balance out the intense sweetness. Comes with a cookie (I think it had pine nuts in it?).\n\nOne thing I will note is that there was a significant length of time between when we finished the appetizers and when we got our entrees. BF commented on this and wondered where our food was, but I didn't mind since that gave me time to digest and zen out before tackling the entrees. Dinner took a total of 2 hours from start to finish, so if you go here, treat dinner as the main event for the evening.\n\nSo with the items above, plus 1 glass of wine and 2 beers, the total was about $135 for the two of us (not including tip, which brought it up to ~$160), which I thought was just about right considering the portion sizes. They are not trying to gipp you food here... you will be full and happy at the end of the meal.\n\nVerdict: Go! You won't be disappointed. It is well worth the money.", "author": "Kimber L."}

We arrived five minutes early prior to our reservation. Upon researching, it seemed as if there was a dress code or to at least be dressed nicely. My boyfriend dressed nice casual and I wore a nice dress. Upon arriving, we saw some people were more business casual. I felt over dressed, so you can certainly come nice casual. When we arrived, the two hostesses were talking, and it took them a couple of minutes to acknowledge us. Which was a little awkward, we just stood their for a couple of minutes unsure if we should interrupt or not. After we checked in, we were sat within a minute or two. \n\nWe were sat in a corner table behind the mirror, which wasn't a bad seat. It was perfect for us. There's also enough spacing between tables which I liked. We didn't have any drinks, just water. The waitress brought us something to snack on, which was long get thin breadstick with olive oil and pesto blend. It wasn't bad, but not great. I didn't particularly care for it. We ordered one appetizer and a small plate, the appetizer was the ravioli with black truffle sauce. It was really good, the sauce was fantastic. However, I wasn't expecting one giant ravioli. It was literally one giant ravioli. It was great, and the taste was there, but figured two would be appropriate for the price, and it was also cold. Not sure if it was supposed to be that way. Our small plate was mushroom risotto, and this was portioned enough for the both of us. The risotto was great and wonderfully seasoned, probably some of the best I've had. \n\nAs for entrees, he had the halibut and I had scallops. Both were pretty amazing. We didn't have any complaints about our main dishes. The scallops and halibut were coked perfectly. By that time, we were pretty full and took a dessert to go. As ordered the lavender bar, which was mousse and Devils food cake all mixed together, with rice puffs, lemon, and lavender. It was really good. I we both felt like it certainly wasn't worth $11. It was a very small portion. Before leaving, they did give us some chocolates, which was nice. \n\nOverall, I would come her again for a nice time and beautiful dinner, or maybe a special occasion. For two people, it was $125 - one appetizer, one small plate, two entrees, and one dessert. This isn't too bad for a nice dinner.", "author": "Cecilia V."}

I've always been a huge fan of Barbacco, so it was difficult making the reservation for Perbacco instead this time. However, I'm so glad I did because it surpassed all of my previous expectations.\n\nOur whole experience from start to finish was absolutely great. As some others have mentioned, service could be slightly improved due to the at times inattentive servers. However, we also dined like it was a three course meal and they continuously replaced our dinnerware so I'm not complaining.\n\nThe meal begins with complimentary bread crackers with a chimichurri sauce which was a great touch. We decided to order three things to split: the herb and mushroom ricotta gnocchi, risotto, and duck breast. My first bite into the gnocchi was heavenly - I've never had such rich gnocchi that melted in my mouth before. The risotto was also extremely flavorful with hints of apple and mushroom. Finally, the duck breast was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a really interesting peach salad on the side.\n\nI would highly recommend each of the dishes we ordered. At the price point that Perbacco is at, I'm completely blown away by the quality of their food and service. I'm already planning my next trip and I can't wait to be back!", "author": "Sunny H."}

When making reservations at a restaurant, don't you typically do your due diligence (ie check the website or menu) beforehand, to set proper expectations?! People are funny.\n\nAnywho, I digress. Perbacco was an incredible dining experience for me and the rest of my group. Like many people, I too have been to my fair share of Italian restaurants both in the US as well as when I lived in Florence a few years ago-- Perbacco certainly knows what they are doing. I say this because I haven't been to the restaurant in over a year and still remember the tagliatelle w/ pork sugo I ate.

I've been here several times for lunch and dinner, and I've been hooked since the first time I went. Before Perbacco, I'd always scoffed at Italian dining out as being a thoroughly heavy, carb-loaded, gut-busting Olive Garden/Buca di Beppo-like experience. I never knew Italian cuisine could be so inventive, light, and refreshing without making you feel as if you've added 20 pounds of gut and booty ballast.\n\nWeekday lunch at Perbacco is a total power scene, with lots of business deals being discussed everywhere. If confidentiality and discretion are a concern to you, the tables downstairs might feel a bit intimate and closely spaced. Yet overall, the atmosphere is loud and lively. Not so much so that you have to shout to be heard by your companions, yet just enough so that you likely won't be overheard by the tables next to you.\n\nDinner at Perbacco can run from semi-formal to business casual, with younger professionals sticking to the bar and well-dressed, reservationed older folk sitting down to an intimate dinner before a night at the theater. \n\nI didn't have a reservation the last time a friend and I went for dinner, but we still managed to get accommodated immediately by having table settings placed on the last remaining empty bar table up front. Everything from the salumi platter, veal, hanger steak, to a cheese platter struck the right \"balance\" for almost any attribute you could imagine - whether unique flavors, the \"magnitude\" of the flavors, \"lightness\" vs. \"heaviness,\" and even portion size/value.\n\nOverall, a memorable and truly positive dining experience that makes you feel lucky - and proud - to be in such an amazing city.", "author": "Vincent L."}

The rest of the service was excellent as well--the server did a great job of explaining to us exactly how everything was prepared so that we knew what we were getting.\n\nWe split the brown sugar gelato for dessert, which was very good. (I had a hard time deciding between that & the salted caramel. Now I really want to try the salted caramel!)\n\nIn any other city (except maybe New York or something), I'd probably give Perbacco half a star more--the food was all very good, but I have had so much food in SF, and so much Italian food, that has utterly blown me away, so the bar is really high. There was nothing at Perbacco that I felt rose to the \"foodgasm\" level, which has kind of become my standard for rating something five stars.\n\nThe only other drawback was the noise level. We were lucky enough to be seated upstairs, which was definitely quieter than downstairs, but it was still a bit loud. (Which....seems to be par for the course in SF.)

Good thing I made a reservation a month in advance for 8pm. My date came 10 minutes before I did, he ended up waiting by the bar. We were then seated at a corner table. Quite roomy for a corner booth I must say. It's a square table that would be for four, so it's extra plate room for our dishes. Service was a bit slow, most likely due to greater traffic for the special day.\n\nThe menu was slightly different from the one I browsed earlier that day, with more choices. I ordered this Citrus Cured Langoustine, with Maine Lobster, Dungesness Crab, Sturgeon Caviar and Langoustine Panna Cotta. Shellfish heaven I must say! The presentation was beautiful, with various colors of citrus fruits and seafood. I have a thing for savory panna cotta, or perhaps panna cotta in general. I like this soft, gelatin texture, yet I'm not to expect a sweet vanilla taste, but rather something that would not normally come to mind. Overall, the dish was a bit lacking in taste and texture. Not that it's a bland dish, in fact, it's a bit too salty for the caviar. I can see why the fruits came in handy and the seafood were prepared as close to their normal seafood taste as possible. However, the tastes don't seem to blend it well. It was a bit choppy, doesn't flow. It's like a festival rather than a show. I find it a bit interesting on how the lobster pieces were overcooked, which became a bit tough, the crab was just right, and the langoustine had a sashimi texture but slight fishy taste. The idea is definitely there, it's just in need of more of a technical touch on the execution.\n\nMy meal continued on with the Cunij, Roasted Rabbit Leg & Boudin with Rye Berry Risotto, Chanterelle Mushrooms, and Braised Greens. I enjoyed that risotto!! The flavors were a bit overwhelming if I had a bite of the risotto before the rabbit meat. The rabbit leg was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, has the texture of a game hen, but has a light but gamey taste to it. There's a lot of meat in that tiny little leg. Oh that cute rabbit, I just love it. (Sue me for eating a cute creature.) Portions were just right, but perhaps the flavors had tricked me well, it is quite a heavy dish. I had to stop halfway if I want to save room for desserts.\n\nOn the side, we ordered Brussel Sprout as our usual dining action. Unlike its sister restaurant, Barbacco, these were not deep fried in duck fat. Instead, these were sauteed in brown butter, with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and capers mixed in. Definitely a different texture and taste. I don't quite enjoy this type of preparation for Brussel Sprouts, it's lacking texture and could be too mild in taste.\n\nI ended the meal with a Burnt Caramel Gelato with Sea Salt and Pignoli Cookie. I was simply too full to try the cookie. I picked at my gelato though. Unfortunately, as good as the dessert had sound on the menu, I could not stand the sweetness. This is rather a personal preference item. The aftertaste of caramel was just a tat too strong. I'm sure those who are capable of eating sweets, which means the major population, will enjoy this gelato. The flavors were rich and blasting, the texture wasn't extremely thick and creamy. It's also a generous scoop, not bad for sharing.\n\nGoods and bads about this place. I'll grade it a 3.5 for the most part. I guess I might have had a higher expectation since I seriously love Barbacco. Bumping it up for doing a great job on the risotto.", "author": "Connie C."}

I had heard great things about it, and the Yelp reviews were off the charts. When we entered the restaurant I was given a Happy Birthday card...that was a nice touch!  \n\nOne of the deciding factors in my decision was that the Salumi Misti was on the Big Eat, so naturally, my family started off with one of those.  I have never been a big fan of salumi plates in general, but thought I would try each kind. They were good, but because salami is something that I'm not a particular fan of, one time was enough.  We also ordered that Burrata with sweet corn and cherry tomato crudo.  I work at a cheese shop and know my burratas...this one wasn't curdly (the death knell of mozzarella's) and the cherry tomato crudo was flavorful. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=6Ljap5vwurZCKsRTMsHJIg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=zJqYLy_4xU2ZEeACMkntuw\n\nFor my main dish, I had the Pappardelle with braised short rib ragu.  I was a bit disappointed that the sauce tasted like Thanksgiving gravy...I was expecting something more earthy and meaty.  Aside from that fact, the portion size was perfect and the pasta cooked to perfection.  \n\nDessert was good...so good that my family of 3 ordered 4 and finished every last bite.  I had been dreaming about the doughnuts. They came out warm, in a bag, with a nice \"Happy Birthday\" chocolate stencil on the plate.  The citrus wasn't overpowering, but enough to taste. The Butter Pistachio Cake was good as well. There was some filling in it...almost custard like.  The Burnt Carmel Gelato is to die for...and I've been to Bi-Rite, so don't even try to compare the two!  It was topped with coarse salt which added an addictive crunch to the creamy concoction. By far, my favorite dessert was the Chocolate Torrone.  It had chunks of hazelnuts in it and was served with blackberries on the side...extremely refreshing and a chocolate lovers dream.  \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=cDJ4bRfKKCnyG_yPlIg0xg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=Mv00nKAsnXI8niNRE_LI0w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=jvPPoc7lGTmUaLEOoVwUyg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ztL8KI0ed0snCiK88ZUfNw?select=ba5IP3z3Qot0TGwuDE6arA\n\nAll in all we had a good experience.

It is absolutely delicious!\n\nMy friend and I came for dinner on a Saturday night. It got progressively busier as the night went along, but the service stayed fantastic throughout. For our starter, we shared the Carne Cruda -- a wonderfully rich and tasty, veal tartare. It came with some black truffles as well as a wafer-thin biscotti complement to serve the tartare. It was the star of the meal. It was tasty, a top selection of meat and had a delight creamy texture. I would absolutely return for just this dish.\n\nFor mains, we had the Rabaton and the Pappardelle. The Rabaton was a filling gnocchi with wild mushrooms which were not overpowering or overly watery. The spinach and herb really shone through and we never felt as if the pasta was too doughy or plain, which is a common symptom of bad gnocchi. Additionally, neither the garlic nor the ricotta were too strong--it was well balanced. The Rabaton was amazing! It was drenched in a rich ragu from a beef short rib stew. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth good and had the fall-off-the-bone texture. It was not tough at all, very savory and not in the least bit dry. In general, the pasta was perfectly al dente, just the way I like it. \n\nDessert was top notch as well. We shared the Dark Chocolate Bonet, a cross between a custard and a pudding. It was soft and rich, a theme through the night, but was not too sweet for our taste. It came with an awesome caramel honeycomb which was so good that I hogged. \n\nAll in all, I would come back as soon as possible. It was a great experience and I'd be excited to try their other dishes. I'd get that Carne Cruda again, though...", "author": "Larry Y."}

By the time we had even narrowed down our options, it was pretty late into the evening, so we figured it would be best to dine somewhere near our hotel.  We agreed that Perbacco seemed like a fantastic choice and rushed over to satisfy our growling bellies.\n\nWe walked into the elegant dining room, which was quite expansive and extremely packed.  We were seated at a comfortable table and presented with a lengthy wine list.  My glass of 2008 Alto-Adige, M\u00fcller Thurgau was crisp and delicious.  Fabulous bread also helped tide us over as we awaited our meal.  \n\nAfter gazing around at the neighboring tables, we started salivating over the decadent pasta dishes.  Each creation was offered in full or half portions, but we decided to split the larger plate as our starter.  There did not seem to be a poor choice among the bunch, as they were all exquisite and unique.  We settled on the Pappardelle, which was tossed with a short rib puree.  The dish was earthy, savory, and comforting.  My duck entree was equally fabulous.  The meat was lean and perfectly cooked.  I actually exclaimed that it was the most well-prepared duck I have ever tried.  \n\nUnfortunately, our spectacular meal was tarnished by snippy service.  Our waiter was extremely refined and professional, to the point where I contemplated if he disliked us.  He seemed extremely put out all evening, which made us hesitate with our requests for additional bread, and so on.\n\nRegardless of the waiter with the attitude, our meal at Perbacco was delightful.

Fritto misto shrimp with olives, green beans, $15. Not too oily but we didn't like the green olives no matter how much you batter and fry it. Might not order again.\n2. Pork belly, $15.  A 4 in long, about 2 inch thick piece of pork belly.  It was just about 1 bite for the 4 of us. \nEntrees:\n1.  The agnolotti pasta with \"meat\" was ordered by 2, $20/each. It was chewy like a gnocchi and shaped rectangular with lots of sauce.  It was OK.\n2. Duck breast - 2 thick slices of med rare breasts were tender and very good and came with a  side of salad, $30.\n3. Beef short rib, $34 came with one large short rib and slices of pork. Not enough for a Jr. Yelper to eat, who welcomed shared food from our plates.\nDesserts shared by 4:\n1. Cheesecake $11, was OK.  Not my favorite but the tiny scoop of apricot sorbet was really good. \n2. Bonet, $11, chocolate mousse like cake.  Chunks of crunchy meringue was interesting.\n\nThe diners next to us looked like they had a veal pasta which I might've liked as well.

Perbacco has made a major come back into mine.\n\nIt has been a while since I've dined here, honestly I cannot even remember when it was but it has been at least a year. I've always enjoyed some amazing meals here, but started to take it for granted and just knew that at some point I would be making a return visit. And last night was exactly that. A true sublime reconnection. A night that for the first time in years, I would actually clean my plate.\n\nA group of four, 6:15 reservations and cocktails in hand we were ready to party and be treated to huge meal that would rival Thanksgiving. And yes, in my opinion we did order way too much, but when 99.99 percent of the menu offerings sound absolutely delicious what are you supposed to do? \n\nMarie and my wife are fans of beets. Markus and I hate those stupid things so we got the burrata and heirloom tomato starter. Our appetizer was amazing, but I must admit those beets looked awfully tasty, and was tempted to pry one of those away. So as of right now, I am officially still president of the \"I hate beets\" club, but on my next visit I am going to take a chance and put one of those purple slimy things in mouth and see what happens. \n\nFour mains to share,\n\n1. Pork shoulder with polenta and turnip. Good? YES! and I am now a former member of the \"I hate turnip\" club.\n\n2. Risotto with wile mushrooms. My favorite of the evening. Complex flavors with a hint of Gorgonzola. The cheese was not on the menu description, but it was there i just know it.\n\n3. Gnocchi with toasted walnuts. Mixed reviews at the table, but I thought they were perfectly executed. \n\n4. Tajarin,  tagliatelle noodles with a rich pork sugo sauce. This has always been a staple here and it always found a way to our table. But last night it missed the mark. There was no problem with the pork sugo sauce, but the problem is that there simply wasn't enough of it. May not be part of the future rotation.\n\nTwo desserts to share.\n\n1.Gelato with sea salt. So good we fought over the last bite\n\n2. Gianduja. Dark chocolate, hazelnut and praline bar. Also served with a sea salted gelato. OMG! Yes, it was amazing.\n\nCheese course to share.\n\n1. La Tur. One of my all time favorites, creamy goat cheese. Try it with honey.\n\n2. CAPRIAGO, BOHEMIAN CREAMERY, SONOMA (had to copy and paste that).

Unfortunately, it's been a while since I've been back to this place to give a full on detailed opinion, but from what I remember, it was great. \n\nThe staff was really friendly and knew their menu, and the food was delectable. The one thing I can't get over is that ooey, gooey fig cake; you can't miss dessert here.\n\nIn terms of food, their bruchetta's (sp?) are really good, especially the one with mushrooms. I also had a mushroom risotto which was really earthy and warm. My mother had a sort of pasta that had a pesto sauce which was great too. \n\nAnd, for being an \"expensive\" restaurant, the value and the price was actually not as expensive as we thought, even with appetizer, entree, and dessert with wine!", "author": "Bahar A."}

Clearly the sort of place where a lunch could be leisurely or fit within the typical lunch hour it would not be long after my focaccia arrived that the first of two pastas would come, in this case the rich and earthy stracci, and close on its heels three of my favorite things all on one plate; tender gnocchi, supple duck, and sweet cherries - a 'best of' dish on a trip with many and good enough that I actually requested a second demi-portion that arrived fifteen minutes later - a decision I'd regret only slightly when I realized there were at least four desserts I wanted to taste, instead limiting myself to the truly fascinating sweet mushroom donuts filled with green strawberry jam...plus a scoop of intense caramel gelato flecked with smoked sea salt rounding out a truly excellent lunch.", "author": "Michael U."}

The meat plates were eaten up quickly.  After the meat we had the salad course.  It was a simple salad with delicious tomoatos, grapefruit and nuts.  What a wonderfully light salad to start off the pasta dish.  \n\nFor the pasta we had the gnocchi with mushroom cream sauce, and a risoto with a delicious white wine sauce.  The pasta dish was amazing.  I am not a huge pasta fan, but it was great.  The entree we had a choice between duck and seabass and I had the seabass.  It was done perfectly.

It's one of a few places in SF that's been on my list for several years after multiple people recommend it and after reading strong reviews and learning about the pedigree and style here. So my wife and I finally had a chance to go this week for a casual dinner outing. \n\nThe ambiance is lovely and the service is really top notch. The waitstaff was friendly, helpful, and present. Our main waiter was definitely a pro -- good stuff. I'll say the menu is fantastic as well, although the pastas and mains were largely meaty. There were plenty of creative and delicious sounding choices, especially on the appetizer list. However, before I got to the main menu, I started with the wine list. Lovely collection, but the wine prices were incredibly pretentious. I know there's a lot of markup for restaurant wine and they need to make some money here, but this list and the prices are bordering on the ridiculous. \n\nWe ordered an Italian wine at the lower-to-mid range of prices. As expected, it was drinkable, but mediocre (actually, appalling for the price, but whatever -- I don't think we would've found better value in a different selection since it was all overpriced).\n\nAs for food: our apps were nice, especially the frito misto, but nothing spectacular. And sorry, but the mains were just so-so. I had a squid ink cavatelli with octopus and urchin that sounded amazing on paper, but just didn't come together for me on the plate. It was tough, unloved, and the entire dish, bland. I am a very low sodium user -- many dishes that would pass the normal palette taste too salty to me. But for the first time in recent memory, I actually had to salt my restaurant food here. In the end, sensing my dissatisfaction, our waiter took a few dollars off the bill and added some complimentary cookies to our dessert order. \n\nWhich brings me to the highlight of the meal: dessert. Again, the menu was great -- good choices and quite creative. We ordered the salted dark chocolate bonet. It's was huge, and very yummy -- almost redeeming the rest of the meal! My wife commented that we should just come back here for dessert only sometime when we have that late evening hankering for some yummy sweets. \n\nAnd indeed, I'm not likely to go back soon except maybe for dessert, unless someone tells me I hit a bad night or I picked the wrong menu items. Too many other great places to eat around here, and way better things to spend my money on than a so-so meal.", "author": "J S."}

Service with a smile is your job, no?\n\nThe black sea bass (with wild mushroom asparagus ragout, potatoes, and spring onions, $26) were good but the skin nicely crisped, but the ragout was overly salty in my opinion.  At least my portion was sizable compared to the small piece of salmon others got.\n\nThe one shining item was the almond brown butter cake for dessert ($9).

My favorite was definitely the pork terrine, I think I am now a terrine addict.  Accompanied with the house made bread, this is a meal within itself. YUM.\n\n-Farfalle Nere (squid ink pasta and crispy octopus)- I've had squid ink pasta in NYC before and it was delicious. So I couldn't pass up the opportunity to be adventurous and order it again.  They did a great job, the farfalle was perfectly \"al-dente.\" and the pasta tasted fresh from the sea. The octopus was perfectly cooked, tender and with a slight bounce in the bite.\n\n-Pappardelle (wide pasta with slow cooked short rib ragu)- Tasty! I've had this dish many times at other restaurants and homemade as well, it's ALWAYS a winner. It taste good and feels comforting.  The short ribs were tender and sauce was flavorful with accents of sweetness and savory.  \n\n-Meyer Lemon Panna Cotta w/ Rosemary shortbread- I am already a big fan of panna cotta and with the meyer lemon it was the perfect end to the meal.  The panna cotta was light and creamy and combined with the huckleberry compote, it had the perfect finish.  We shared the dessert because the two pastas had us on \"carbo load.\" My friend really liked the Rosemary shortbread cookies, I agree they were really good. Perbacco should think about selling them in bulk, I know at least two people that would buy that!\n\nThis place is definitely great and the price is reasonable for the amount of food. Its always great to share, especially when its Italian food, there are so many appealing choices.", "author": "D C."}

The restaurant had a big lunch crowd so I was glad that I made reservation in advance.  I ordered a duck confit for lunch and it was probably the best one I had in the recent years.  It was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The duck was crispy on the outside and fell off bone tender inside.  The flavor was excellent and consistent throughout. We also ordered dessert.  While the dessert did not disappoint with creativity and flavor, the portion was small.  I finished it in 2 or 3 bites.  Overall, I would definitely go back again and will make sure to make reservation if I do.", "author": "Happy L."}

I always have the impression that the accents are the same as Spanish accents. Is that the case? No. Me always gets to look stupid. Sadface.\n\nI never had noticed Perbacco until the St. Patty's Day block party, while I was walking to Wayfare (which was full, so I ended up at Wexler's). I came in search of a Bellini, only to find a Bellisimo. I can't remember what was in it (champagne, blood orange, etc.), but it was enough to make me return for another.\n\nMy first experience here was nothing memorable. Bartenders loitered around the place and conversed among themselves. I sat at the bar on a Friday evening, ready to fill my spacious tummy with lots of unhealthy goodies. By the end, my tummy was only halfway filled and my wallet was $75 emptier. Sheesh. I really liked my raviolo, but just one? C'mon, I'm dying of hunger! Boo. My halibut was good, but I still craved more raviolo. Raviolo was truffley, yolky, goodness. For dessert, I had the bonet, which I didn't really like. It was like chocolate pudding with some caramel sauce and whipped cream. Bleh. By the end? I ended up eating dinner part two at another restaurant in the area.\n\nI remember the second time a bit differently, but it could have been from the Bellisimos and champagne. The atmosphere was different. A good different. They served focaccia instead of the hard, tooth-chipping bread they served during dinner. I requested the bar menu in hopes of having some truffled egg toast, but it wasn't on the menu anymore. Sadface. I simply ordered the Catelvetrano olives with the burrata cheese. Holy ravivioli, pat me on the back! You have to try the burrata cheese, you just have to! Wow.\n\nThere was a man next to me who kept me company. He raved about their meatballs, he even let me sample some of his dish. I still thought the burrata cheese was a better choice, though (:\n\nFor dessert, I had chocolate mousse. It was so much better than the bonet, I swear on the holy grail. I let my companion have a taste, to which he said, \"Mmmm!\" He's not even a dessert person, proof that you should get the mousse!\n\nOn top of that, the bartender was this amicable little Spanish man. He was always very attentive to everyone's needs and made sure we were all happy. We talked about Quince, which was how I found out that I had been pronouncing it incorrectly. Boo.\n\nSomeone mentioned finding a cockroach. Well, I found a translucent red bug (about the size of an ant) on the side of my burrata plate. I wasn't sure if it came with the plate, or if it had gotten on there afterwards, but it doesn't distract from how good the burrata cheese is. GET THE BURRATA CHEESE! Oh, and pair it with a Bellisimo.\n\nPerbacco, please bring back the truffled egg toast so I can try it. Please please please please please!", "author": "Elaine N."}

But the price was exorbitant and my 4 year old goddaughter could have plated it much better. \nThe melons were just thrown on a plate.\n\nThen came my 2 entrees; I ordered the smaller portion of the Tagliatelle with 5 hour pork sugo and the Agnolotti del pin. \n\nThe moment the server set the tagliatelle down, I was like...is that the tagliatelle?!? He very apprehensively said 'yes'; which makes me think I'm not the first person to ask that question.\nThe tagliatelle was cut so thin, it looked like a plate of cheap instant college ramen, topped with chef boyardee canned sauce sitting on a bed of oil.\nBut I thought, oh well, I'll give it a try. \nI was horrified. \nIt tasted worst than it looked. \nThe tagliatelle was overcooked, the sauce was terrible; it tasted like canned sauce and where was the porcini mushroom?\nI can't imagine Anyone thinks this is a good pasta dish- Perbacco really needs to remove this from the menu. \n\nSomeone else in my party ordered the tagliatelle as a bigger entree and only took 3 bites; the poor girl went home starving. The look of disgust on her face said it all. \nInattentive of the server not to have noticed the almost-full dish. Bad call. \n\nThe agnolotti was passably better. \nHaving just had Flour + Water's melt in your mouth flavorful Agnolotti recently, this was a subpar version. The pasta was too hard, it wasn't tasty and it was disappointing. \nI finished the dish only coz I was famished and couldn't eat the ramen disguised as tagliatelle. \n\nThe dessert was also disappointing. I really wanted to wash my taste buds from the terrible pasta entrees but the bambolinis were filled with some tart nasty jelly that tasted like a cross between kiwi and kumquat. \nWhy, Perbacco??? Why????\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact that I was at a biz dinner with acquaintances i just met, i would have sent the dishes back. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay a single cent for dinner. \n\nI'm a fan of Barbacco, but sorry Perbacco, I cannot come by again.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

This IS THE restaurant you want to create lifetime memories at!\n\nLast night my girlfriends and I celebrated my 40th Birthday. Yes, a milestone birthday and I certainly had more than one reason to celebrate!\n\nUpon arrival with my beautiful girlfriends we were greeted very warmly---and the staff knew it was my night. The service was impeccable kind of service where you feel like a VIP from the second you start talking with the Host and Hostess. We got to the table, not to be overlooked by the gorgeous cheese spread that our table was sitting near. \n\nThere was a Birthday card presented to me by the Hostess and we were introduced to Allison AMAZING, INCREDIBLY attentive, smart and funny Hospitality Professional. (SERVER is way too pedestrian for this woman-you have to request her-she is unbelievable)!!! Allison definitely knows the menu and the food. She made some very nice recommendations and is clearly a foodie. I thought she was very emotionally intelligent or a former Actress...she has a high EQ as we learned throughout the evening. I wish she could have joined us, she is that awesome! We ate amazing food, lobster and hearts of palm...poached pear...amazing wine (and that was just for starters). My friend ordered the octopus app for her entree and the brussel sprouts (mind blowing). My other friend ordered the pillows of pasta filled w/goat's cheese and brussel sprouts. Little pillows of heaven with homemade pasta! Yum!\n\nI ordered the papperdelle w/shortrib ragu topped with shredded horseradish. I have to say it was one of the best entrees of my entire life. I would order this again and again. It's perfection. The pasta is generous and beautifully cooked, the short rib is fall apart meat and the sauce w/the horseradish is a perfect marriage of flavors. \n\nWe had drinks (Perbacco, some tequila drink and another froufrou cocktail) and then switched to wine. By the time it was desert and cheese we were done...\n\nThe bathrooms are super cool too! Don't drink too much though because you have to trek downstairs to the basement for the bathroom which is kind of a cool set up. The battery of sinks are communal and the toilets are MMWW and then a private bathroom. I liked that concept considering while I was washing my hands the most handsome young man was down there an whoa-I nearly passed out. We ended up talking...and I almost tripped up the stairs (that would have been bad)...we chatted some more and I got a Birthday hug from him...holy crap...what a bonus! He was so hot!!!\n\nAllison knew we were skipping dessert and yet brought a plate that said 'Happy Birthday' in chocolate with some amazing lemon sorbetto and a napoleon that was phenominal...followed up by almond nougat and hazelnut chocolate squares. \n\nIf it were not for Allison our evening would not have been the same. The food was incredible but the service and the feeling of that restaurant was superb. I talked with a man who I think was the owner or manager. Either way-he was delightful. The entire evening will not be forgotten anytime soon. Thank you Perbacco for making my 40th Birthday an experience that I will not ever forget!", "author": "Sherie R."}

But unfortunately, we went in with high hopes and came out quite disheartened. \n\nThe service was a tad pretentious but completely understandable given this restaurant's cadence. And the ambiance was quite ordinary with an average dining age group of about 40 - 60 year olds. I suppose it's somewhat classy in a very older and sedentary manner. \n\nThe food was honestly very disappointing. We ordered the butternut squash risotto, fritto misto, short rib pappardelle, side of brussels sprouts and the burnt caramel gelato. I honestly cannot pick my favorite since all of the dishes were equally sub par - I am probably the biggest fan of risottos but this one was simply too sweet, a bit runny and sparse with the cheese. And the pappardelle definitely did not live up to all of the fabulous reviews - it was overpowered with tomato sauce and digressed from any meat based flavor. Eeek. \n\nBut most of all, you can clearly understand how mediocre and unsatisfying the meal was from our reaction to the dessert - we didn't even finish half of it! And it certainty wasn't because we were stuffed. We never waste desserts, EVER. \n\nSo all in all, do yourself a favor and try one of the other Michelin rated SF culinary highlights instead.

The place wasn't just humming, it was bursting at the seams in terms of the number of people and the high level of energy permeating throughout.  \n\nWe were seated promptly in the upstairs dining room and presented with a plate of grissini and pesto to nosh on, as well as a crusty roll.  We had a good idea of what we wanted to order as we had already reviewed the menu earlier in the week.   Oh yeah, we were excited.  Each of us had eaten here before, but not recently, so we were really looking forward to this meal.\n\nWe split an order of the pappardelle with short rib ragu and horseradish to start.  All I can say is Oh.My.Goodness.  There is nothing that compares to handmade pasta with a very tender, rich and flavorful sauce made from short ribs.  The grated horseradish was the perfect counterpoint to the richness of the meat.  The pasta was perfectly cooked.  \n\nFor the entree I ordered black sea bass, which came with mushrooms, beans, spinach and black truffle butter.  The generous portion of fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was flavorful and rich without being heavy.   Definitely something I would order time and again.  We also orderd a side of the brussel sprouts.  Were our dishes good?  Given that the only thing remaining on our plates was the chervil garnish, I sould have to say that it most certainly was!  \n\nFor dessert we had the pistachio panna cotta and the bomboloni (doughnuts filled with fruit).  The doughnuts were served warm and were delicious, but came in a close second to the panna cotta, which was light, creamy and bursting with pistachio flavor.  \n\nService was good, but not as attentive as on previous visits.  Our meal lasted 2.5 hours, which was a bit longer than we had expected.   Although our waiter checked in on us serveral times during the meal, there were slight lags at the beginning and end of our meal.  I'd be happy to attribute this to it being a busy and packed weekend evening, as I had not experienced any issues on prior visits.\n\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area.

Kids these days are so spoiled....they have to be bribed with iFonez, iPad$ with animation movies, just so that parents (or single parents) can go on dates have the kids to be quiet next to them. Not me, I was an easy cheap date....make the breadstick good, and everything else will be in its right place. iGrissini trumps iPad. Nom Nom Nom Yom Yom Bom Bom Bom GaGa GooGoo this breadstick is da shiznit good good! \n\nBut to keep up with the times, you cannot just have great breadstick anymore. \n\nPerbacco is billed by many food geeks to be one of SF's finest old world style Italian.\nEven if they think is Gangnam Style....this place is otherwise really not my style.\n\nGrissini - shaggadelic great. Eat it plain, or dip in some special sauce (the usual olive oil + ground parsley + garlic goodness). I could clean up a whole plate of these easy, with or without salumi.\n\nButternut squash soup - pretty good, can't go wrong with this one\n\nsalad - forgot the name of it, but see the pic. A beautiful sculpture with a few fruits in it that was pure delightful bliss\n\nand then it went south of there (and not south of the boot)\n\nBraised short rib entree - not my order, but had a sample, and I'm of the conclusion that I prefer my short ribs done Asian style (primarily Korean, Vietnamese, or Cantonese/Chinese or Taiwanese). This red wine braised prep is again not my style\n\nTagliatelle (fresh pasta) with 5 hour pork sugo with wild porcini mushrooms - I purposely skipped the braised short rib paperdelle since a few folks I know ordered it and were not doing the horserider gallop dance afterwards. So I decided to try this pasta dish. Sugo is supposed to be some Italian sauce. Here it is a pork stew mix...and it could possibly change slightly depending on the region, but it's supposed to be like a minced pork (with a puffy texture) simmered with tomato, herbs, amongst other things (supposedly there were porcini mushrooms inside, melted into the mix). Unfortunately there wasn't much in the way of sauce or flavoring...mostly moist minced/ground pork, and fairly one dimensional (mostly a salt profile). No matter how much tossing and mixing of the pork with the pasta, there was a mismatch in general. Grated parmesean didn't improve the dish either. It's perfectly fine if this is the intended approach and execution, but to me this did not work very well. No sauce clinging to the pasta (and still ends up being a salt and pork smear). Something like a Taiwanese style rou zou (stewed minced pork) over brothless noodle, is a lot more robust, in a similar approach (but w/o the tomato). Perhaps a non pasta entree would have been better, but this was a disappointment.", "author": "Ken K."}

Also, the restaurant manager who handles our wine was quite a bit off that evening. He brought us a bottle of wine to sample and started pouring it, but it was empty. Which surprised me because most people can tell when they pick up a bottle whether it's empty.  He also decanted our bottle of wine we ordered but left the decanter off our table away from us where they keep the other ones. So we couldn't refill our glasses until he bothered to wander by our table and check on us.

However I'm the person that is always Guinness swilling so if I miss one day it doesn't kill me.\n\nThe first thing you notice before walking in is the large polished metal signage. A small host station is to the right when you enter and to the left is a long elegant bar that reaches a good ways into the restaurant.  The decor uses the exposed brick of the building and a balance of modern and classic elements through out. Finding that without reservations, our wait could have been upwards of an hour. I did however notice two open spots at the bar in which we happily jumped on right away, since it was full service there.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that we are seated right in front of the in house cured meats operation. All the salumi on the menu, right in front of us. What a way to spark an appetite. Plate after plate of meat were cut and served  from our vantage point. Of course we were going to order one of those things! First off however, being at the bar, we had  to see what the mixed drinks were going to be like, so we got a Lemon Drop and my \"old man beverage\" of a Rob Roy . Both excellently mixed.\n\nAs we perused the menu, the choices were:\n\n- Tasting of Salame - NOSTRANO / FINOCCHIONA / FINOCCHIONA PICCANTE (SPICY) / SANGUINATO (BLOOD)\n-  Baccala - Salt Cod mixed with potatoes and served with toast points\n- Beef Short Ribs, spring vegetables, gremolata\n- Braised pork shoulder\n\nAs you can see, this was a meal of meatz (yes that is with a Z). Cured meats and braised meats. The only exception was that of the bacalla. But there were no exceptions in the fact that everything was good. I couldn't tell you what all the names of the salumi were but they were delicious. \n\nIt never occurred to us that we were sitting at the bar because the service was just as good as if we would have been at a table. We did however look around and noticed that the clientele were much older than we were. It was also pointed out to be that the guy next to us had a lot of \"man jewelery\". There was also this older lady that came in with a huge puffy St Patty's day hat, and our guess was she was recently ragingly drunk :) Only one person was younger than us and she seemed very bored with her parents. So you might say the ambiance was a bit older and stuffy but I think the food and service makes up for that. We were definitely well taken care of.

The meat really tasted like chicken, but well cooked and delicious.\n\nWe picked a random Italian wine and it ended up wonderful.  My company ordered an orange scented donut.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-03", "description": "Is it bad to say the best part of the meal was the bread and butter?\n\nMy step-mother LOVES Perbacco! She knows I'm a total foodie and is constantly asking if I've tried Perbacco yet. It's been on my list for errm, over a year and the only thing that brought me there was my quest to check #18 Salumi Misti Plate off my 7x7 list...\n\nMy gf and I had reservations at 8 PM last night. Perbacco was bustling when we arrived. We waited for 10 minutes while they got our table ready for us.\n\nFOOD:\n*Breadsticks and Pesto Dipping Sauce (complimentary): The breadsticks were like ordinary breadsticks you would find at the grocery store. They were a bit too crunchy for my liking. The pesto dipping sauce was very light and fresh, but b/c there wasn't parmesan cheese in it (at least I didn't taste any), so it was bland.  \n\n*Bread and butter: The bread was nice, crusty and had a pillowly soft center. The butter was AMAZINGLY good. It definitely had a higher butterfat content than the standard American butter has; it had a velvety texture than melted into each taste bud.\n\n*Salumi Misti Plate (#18 on 7x7): Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, ham, salami, terrines, galantines, and pates, but I wasn't \"wowed\" by the Salumi plate. There were about 8 different kinds of house-cured meats, none of which were explained to us, so we didn't know what was what. Other than the pate, all the other meats just tasted like different types of fat and lard. Thank goodness the pickled gherkin, cauliflower and our chianti help balanced out the oiliness. \n\n*Crudo Hamachi: Three thick slices of hamachi drizzled in oil and sprinkled with shaved fennel, serrano pepper and tangerines. Although the hamachi was buttery, it had a pungent fishy smell to it, which I found to be odd. There was no \"fishy\" taste which perhaps  the kick from the serrano pepper and the sweet/tartness from the tangerines masked?\n\n*Pappardelle w/ Shortrib Ragu: After seeing rave reviews on YELP, I was so excited to try this dish. But, when I finally got to, it was a let down. The handmade pappardelle was excellent and was cooked to a perfect al-dente and the short-rib was very tender. However, the sauce was a HUGE disappointment b/c it did NOT tie the dish together. I expected it to be somewhat like a marsala; rich and savory sauce packed w/ flavor, but it was nothing like it. It was flavorless, watery and did not adhere to the pappardelle or shortrib\n\n*Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder w/ Chanterelles and Fingerling Potatoes: The pork shoulder was fork tender, but it was evident that the accompanying sauce was just drizzled on the side as opposed to the pork being braised in it b/c it was flavorless. The chanterelles were tender, as were the potatoes and that's the only good thing I can say about the dish.\n\nDRINKS:\n*Hendrick's Tonic: Nice and strong w/ a hint of cucumber flavoring. A very clean and crisp cocktail. \n*2004 Chianti, Riserva, Riserva, Vigna Misciano, Borgo Scopeto (Sangiovese): Smooth, light, fruity notes, and a very acidic aftertaste which helped balanced out the oiliness from some the dishes.\n\nPRICES:\n*Apps: $8-12\n*Pastas: $11-14 for an appetizer portion and $16-$19 for an entr\u00e9e portion\n*Entrees: $18-$26\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waitress was very friendly but not very attentive. It took us about 20 minutes to flag her down before we could order our bottle of wine. However, the busboys always made sure our water was filled. Our food came out in 20-25 minute increments which lead to total dining time of 2 hours.\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR:\nPerbacco is much larger than it appears to be from the outside. The d\u00e9cor is very simple and clean; red brick walls to the left, marble floor, light auburn ceiling, ivory walls, white linens, brown booths and seating and large vases of flowers scattered throughout.\n\nPerbacco was very busy for a Tuesday night; hence it was very loud. As the other reviews stated, this is NOT a date spot. This is more for  pow-wow lunches and business dinners. \n\nI didn't like the fact that you the bathroom is downstairs and you have to walkdown a long flight of stairs to get there which is challenging with heels after several cocktails/glasses of wine. \n\nCROWD:\nStuffy mature FIDI crowd dressed in suits and ties.\n\nPARKING: \nRelatively easy street parking after 6 PM. \n\nI'm glad I was able to check #18 off my 7x7 list, but highly doubt I would return to Perbacco. Although the dishes were well-prepared, none of the dishes stood out b/c they were flavorless. NEXT!!!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We love how he gently pushes the boundaries of what American diners' conception of what Italian food is. Not everything reaches the heights, but the food is complex and unusual, and therefore worth the extra star.\n\nThe four of us shared the salumi misti platter. Mostly ordinary (the bar has been raised so high by so many places these days; we are fortunate in the Bay Area!), but loved the rillette. So often this is an overdone, overlarge, overrich spread, but Perbacco's is light, fluffy, and a perfect starter. Next time I would skip all the other salume and just have this with their lovely housemade breads.\n\n-- Beet salad with mandarin orange: very good\n-- Octopus roasted with cranberry beans in tomato concasse: outstanding!\n-- Burrata cheese with roasted butternut squash and pears, cress, herb vinaigrette: a Grade B. Chunks were too large, textures too similar, flavors too mild. Squash hadn't caramelized enough to add its usual sweet notes.\n-- Ligurian fisherman's soup. Good, but VERY salty\n-- Fritto misto. Batter shattered off. Green beans & fennel should have been cut shorter. But the aioli was superb, saved the whole dish.\n-- Vitello tonnato. Always superb, and we always order it. Tasted like they sneaked some anchovies into the tonnato sauce, which we heartily approve of. Luscious!\n\nEntrees:\n-- Risotto with local porcini mushrooms, caramelized onions, toma della rocca cheese. This was a very different risotto preparation. Compared to the usual pale-colored lemon or chicken risotto, this was more like a \"short ribs\" of risotto, dark and tangy. Spouose thought it was odd, but I thought it was fabulous.\n-- Ravioli filled with roasted butternut squash, toasted hazelnuts, and pomegranate seeds. A beautiful dish, both in looks and taste. Very generous on the half-size serving.\n-- Pan-roasted monkfish. Very good, but the veggies (previously always reliable) were al dente, too hard to eat. Had I known this I would have insisted the plate be returned to the kitchen to be redone, but I didn't find out until afterwards.\n-- Liberty Farm duck breast, warm salad of brussels sprout leaves, persimmon, dates, pancetta. Very well executed; sauce was more savory than sweet which is what I prefer.\n\nDesserts were good, not great. Service was excellent, this is one of the best-trained waitstaffs in the City.", "author": "Jean K."}

I had the halibut and my friends ordered the rabbit, pork shoulder and pasta.  They were all delicious.  The meat was not overcooked and each dish had a distinct flavor.  I had the mushroom soup as well and that was very tasty.  Make sure you try the sunchokes and brussel sprouts as well.  Oh, and the breadsticks!  We couldn't stop eating them!\n\nThe staff was very attentive and did not miss a beat.  5 star experience all around.  For dessert, we had the white chocolate mousse and enjoyed that as well.

Like-minded Fidi people flock to this lunch spot so I was glad that I made a reservation, because I was wrong to think that it would be less busy with the nasty rainy weather we have. \n\nUpon getting seated, water and breadsticks with pesto sauce were provided. You can skip the breadsticks, a bit too crunchy, but don't worry you also get a piece of thick focaccia bread with butter.\n\nI had to order the salumi misti plate, which is #18 on the Big Eat SF list. We had to motion for the waiter to come over and tell us what each item is. He took the time explaining each meat but I could barely hear him since the noise level in here was pretty high. There were 5 different house cured salumi and 2 kinds of pate on the plate. I really liked the salumi di coto with its noticeable dots of fat. The prosciutto cured in red wine was definitely the saltiest of all, so I put some quince jelly to tone it down. The cornichons were a fave of my BFF! Both of us didn't want to touch the lardo because it just looked unappetizing.\n\nAbsolutely get the Rabaton, it's a truffled-herb gnocchi with roasted mushroom sugo. He kept raving about these soft pillows! This dish is a good choice for vegetarians as it is very filling.\n\nI ordered the Tajarin. Imagine hand-cut tagliatelle, pork sugo cooked for 5 hours crowned with just the right amount of parmigiano reggiano.  A simple dish but incredibly good. \n\nOh, dessert. \n\nThe pistachio panna cotta with pomegranate gelatina and pistachio cookies were more than welcome in my mouth.  Although this panna cotta was too soft set for my liking, we still finished the whole thing.\n\nService was professional but could be more friendlier next time.

You'll see that I didn't LOVE the food below, but the service was so good, that I'd consider going back JUST for the service.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nThe crowd seemed like a bunch of businessmen / older individuals / couples--wasn't very diverse.

The cilantro sauce was so good we asked for extra to have with our meal, and because of Perbacco's awesome service, got more in no time. \n\nWe ordered the fig salad, which was pretty good. The cheese on the dish was rather strong, so if that isn't your cup of tea, beware. We also to the Rabaton, and two of us didn't like it very much. It was definitely the right texture (melt-in-your-mouth texture) but none of us ended up being huge fans of the flavor (may be a personal thing). We got the fingerling potatoes (made vegetarian) and they weren't too special. For dessert we got panforte and panna cotta. The panforte was reasonably good but did not blow us away and the panna cotta was DELICIOUS and great texture. Oh and the bread that came with the entrees was good.\n\nPRICES:\nReasonable, actually!

I only got the half portion, and found that to be filling, but my bf got the full portion and was not full. We both agreed that the dishes were excellent though!! No complaints there. We skipped out on dessert, because we had plans to go elsewhere. I want to try their desserts sometime though! \n\nThe overall atmosphere was nice, and I had a wonderful time Definitely gets pricey fast, so this isn't a place I'd visit often, but surely a treat every once in a while.", "author": "Ashley N."}

We decided to come here for a last minute 9:00 PM dinner while on vacation in San Francisco. Since we were staying less than 2 blocks away, it was a great choice to walk to. For dinner I ordered the coujette, which was potato gnocchi with duck livers and other organ meat. It was described as very rustic and earthy. It was a good description, but the meat and the sauce was a little too game-y for my taste I think. The gnocchi was done perfectly though, as expected from a high end Italian restaurant. Lucky for me, the other half of our group ordered the shareable plates, which was about 1/2 cup of pasta, so they helped finish my meal. My boyfriend had the other gnocchi, which was a ricotta gnocchi with herbs and toasted hazelnuts, definitely the winner. For desert, we all shared my raspberry sorbetto with lemon cookies, which to me, was the best part of the meal. \n\nThe reason I am not giving this restaurant the best review is because of 1. the portion sizes for the sharing plates and 2. our waiter who the entire time we ordered anything tried to unabashedly up-sell us on everything. I get you need to make a living, but when I say no the first time, I mean no. \n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant had a very open and vibrant feel with lots of larger tables laughing and having a great time.

Bar in the front, and tables in the back.\n\nThe menu is printed up daily.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nThe meal starts out with Bread Sticks and a nice Pesto sauce.  Later, you get bread which is OK.\n\nFRITTO MISTO OF ROCK SHRIMP / SEASONAL BEANS / OLIVES / FENNEL / LEMON AIOLI $11 - This appetizer was really good and a highlight of our meal.\n\nTAJARIN - HANDCUT TAGLIATELLE / 5 HOUR PORK SUGO / PORCINI MUSHROOMS $13 small/$18 large - The flavor of the pork was good.  However, there was no extra sauce.  For me, there was a disconnect between the pork and the noodles.  The noodles are set on the dish, then a scoop of the pork is put on top. I would say the dish is 1/3 pork and 2/3 noodles. While the flavor of the pork is good, the noodles are plain.  So you get, flavor with plain, flavor with plain.  I'm not sure how they can improve the dish. But, I would not order it again.\n\nRISOTTO - ROASTED WILD MUSHROOMS / CARAMELIZED ONION / BUTTERNUT SQUASH / SPINACH / TOMA DELLA ROCCA $14 small/$19 large - I don't have Risotto often; so, I don't consider myself an expert.  That said, I enjoyed the dish.  It had nice, large, chunks of wild mushrooms.\n\nPAN ROASTED BLACK BASS / SAUT\u00c9ED FENNEL AND FINGERLING POTATOES / BLOOD ORANGE BUTTER $28 - The wife had this and really enjoyed it.  She would order it again.\n\nOther thoughts and comments:\n\nThe menu (as presented above) is all in CAPS and separated with \"/\". For me, the way the menu was presented, it was hard to imagine what the dish would be like and it was really hard for me to make a selection of what to eat.  I guess the most confusing part is that you have no sense of the proportion of the ingredients on the plate.  Perhaps they could make it more of a narrative like this:\n\n\"TAJARIN - House made (who cares whether they are handcut or not?)  Tagliatelle noodles with a scoop of Pork Sugo which is simmered for 5 hours, with porcini mushrooms\"\n\nWhen you order wine by the glass, they actually bring the bottle to the table and pour you a glass.  They even show you the label before they pour.  It was a nice and unexpected touch.\n\nParmesan cheese can be added to your dish by the waiter.  It comes pre-ground in a bowl, and they spoon it out for you.  For such a nice restaurant, I think it would be nicer if they would grind it or shave it at the table rather than spooning it out of a bowl.\n\nThe bathrooms are downstairs.  Given the lighting and the current custom of using yellow tape on a top and bottom step, I think they should add some yellow tape (especially to the top step) as after a few drinks, I could see someone stumbling down the stairs.  They have individual rooms with toilets, and a communal sink area to wash your hands.  For such a nice restaurant, I think they should try to figure out how to separate the Men's and Women's bathrooms and sink area.\n\nDuring our meal, a waiter and busboy handled our table.  When we got up to leave the restaurant, not only did both of them thank us for coming; but four other employees did!!!!  It was a nice and unexpected touch, that made us feel really appreciated for dining with them.  My hats off to management for encouraging the employees to thank the guests when they leave!  As I said, it was unexpected; but both my wife and I positively commented on it when we were outside the restaurant.  It just made us feel really appreciated and wanting to come again.\n\nThough my wife has eaten there several times for lunch, it was our first time for dinner.  We'll definitely return.\n\nFor those that care, they take AMEX.", "author": "Roy C."}

All four of us were delighted with our food.  I would eat there again without hesitation.\n\nMy appetizer was so good, I was overwhelmed, but it's not on their online menu, so I can't copy it for you.

Our waitress ensured that everyone's wine needs were well accommodated.  She listened carefully to what I described as our desired characteristics and price, then recommended an Italian wine that worked well.  One person in our party didn't favor it (she prefers big, flabby over-opulent wines), so our waitress immediately poured her an alternate by-the-glass that pleased her.\n\nWe dined on the mezzanine level, with hopes that it would be quieter and easier for two couples to talk.  I would like to see some dampening elements introduced to that space, because when the restaurant was fully crowded, it was difficult to talk.  When some other tables finished and cleared, it became much easier. I recommend asking the restaurant where to sit upon booking your reservation if you want to have intimate conversation on a busy night (or any other time people get drunk and start out-bellowing each other).\n\nThe atmosphere is very lively, and the furnishings really feel like you're in a nice restaurant in Italy (lots of wood and marble).

My dad said he hinted tomato juice in it??? Strange.

I was eating mine, almost finishing when I found a worm on my plate. Now I'm not one to start screaming, but I was done with the salad part of the meal. My aunt wasn't though and complained to our waiter who brought me another salad that I didn't want bc I was already grossed out enough. And I hate wasting food. \nAnyways, for our entrees we had a choice of scallops or steak and I didn't feel like either. So I saw there was a vegetarian choice and I asked what it was. It was a rice with mushrooms and a mushroom sauce on top. I am not a fan of mushrooms, so I asked if I could just have some rice with some veggies put in and he said of course, not a problem! I was finally excited for some good food. When my plate came, it was a huge plate of red rice with chopped onions. UH that's not what I meant when I asked for VEGGIES.... It was the nastiest dish I have ever had and I barely ate a few spoonfuls. My gpa now thinks I never eat bc I just could not take this restaurant! I was so over the night, I just wanted to go home. The worm salad wasn't even comped for my gma and when I saw the price of the bill, I was mortified!! I have had better meals at so many places, this one just killed it for me.

It was presented artfully and tasted like god intended: the fatty duck with crispy skin was balanced by the sweet and tart strawberries and rhubarb.  If the +1 had asked me to marry him that night I would have been insulted that he was competing with the duck.\n\n+1 had the short rib sugo, served over papardelle with grated horseradish.  Also excellent - the very definition of elegant comfort food.  \n\nWe shared the veal appetizer, which was thinly sliced and served with an albacore/lemon sauce, capers, and microgreens (I think).  This was, as you might imagine from the rest of the review, also delicious.\n\nPortions were generous--enough so that between the complimentary crostini, crusty bread with butter, the appetizer, and the entree, we had leftovers to take home.  Two tiny dessert bites were served with the check, and off we went into the windy spring night.\n\nBut don't YOU go, because then it will be even harder to get a reservation at a reasonable hour.", "author": "Jennie K."}

Our organizer was so excited to have dinner here and she had booked many months in advance since we were a large group.  I understand that some of the menu has to be set in advance when you have a big group but I think something should have stood out but nothing did. Not a fan of breadsticks on the table.  Makes me think of cheap Italian restaurants.  Dinner started with pear salad, followed by braised ribs and dessert.  The food was fine, but just fine, not outstanding or remarkable.  Most disappointing were the desserts. I have read all the mouthwatering reviews of yummy desserts.  Where was the dark chocolate gonet, the torta di carote, the panna cotta.  Not at our table.  Unfortunately we were offered little mini pound cakes that were dry, dull and must have come straight out of the fridge because they were still cold. I know we were a group but really - couldn't there have been some panache with the desserts at least.   The wine and service were good.  Trip to the toilet was complicated - I should have known when the waiter escorted me. Down the escalator, turn left, then right.

I was researching for a place that celebrates birthdays, where you don't have to break the bank for great food, and we found this place.  Right when we got in, we got seated almost immediately and my bf was greeted with a birthday card.  That was an extra plus!!!  \n\nI definitely did my homework, so the first thing we ordered was the Roasted Fig Salad...OMG, melt in your mouth figs with toasted hazelnuts (one of our favorite kinds of nuts), Scimudin cheese, Juniper Cured Lonza, and Arugula.  Highly suggest this item to order if you are a fig lover.  This item is good enough to share if you want your own entree.  \n\nFor our entree, I had the Pappardelle with a slow roasted short rib ragu.  One of the best Pappardelle I've had, melt in your mouth short rib, and cooked to perfection, both the short rib and the pasta cooked aldente.  My bf had the Beef Short Rib Stracotto, also cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth.  Very tasty, whatever sauce they used was just perfect and there were some cooked grapes that gave it an extra \"YUMMYNESS\" to the dish because of the sweet and savory taste.  \n\nAs we ended the meal, I had asked the waiter if I had a choice for our birthday dessert, and he said I can order whatever I wanted and he'll put \"happy birthday\" on the plate for us.  So when the menu came out, I found out that the gelato comes with two scoops for $7 I think, so I asked if it's ok to get 1 order of gelato but 1 scoop of two different kinds of gelato to taste, and he said it was ok to do that.  I loved that we had that option. We had the Burnt Caramel with sea salt, and also had the Blueberry Swirl Lavendar gelato.  Both were very good, but I think I liked the blueberry one better only because the burnt caramel tasted like something I've had before.  The best part was that I didn't know that they gave a complementary dessert for birthdays, and so they gave us the free dessert of the Ugly Looking Cookies on top of our gelato dessert.  So we got 2 desserts for the price of one, basically.  It was the best, the cookies were the best tasting cookies I've ever had.  It's a must try!\n\nThen at the end we got some bite size desserts, one was a piece of dark chocolate and the other was a cubed hazelnut taffy-like candy.  It tasted like a BIG HULK.  \n\nOne of the best restaurants, by far, in SF that does not break the bank.  Everything on the menu was less than $30.  I also read on the menu that there's an option to taste two pastas that is $16 per person.  We really loved the ambiance inside of the restaurant and kind of romantic.  We definitely will come back, they have a sister restaurant called Barbacco two doors away, thats a little more casual that we may try next time too.", "author": "Amy A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-03", "description": "Where do you go to get pretty good food, not worry about parking on Saturday night in the city, and feel safe dining in the neighborhood? This is definitely a good option. Celebrating a birthday, I thought this would be a nice spot especially since one guest was coming from Chinatown. After dropping everyone in front of the restaurant, I found a space less than one block away as the Financial District becomes a ghost town on weekend evenings. When arriving the table, the hostess gave the birthday person a card congratulating her on behalf of the staff and management of the restaurant (nice touch, appreciated). We then dined on the following: \nAppetizers (all shared) \n1. Fritto Misto (rock shrimp) - Deep fried string beans, olives, onions, tomato, and, of course rock shrimp. My brother likened it to a tempura batter as it was served with a creamy sauce. $11.00 \n2. Chef's Salumi plate (small) - A variety of house made sausages, meats, and a small, fruity pate-like spread with small baguette slices. It was a plentiful portion with good variety. $18.00 \n3. Risotto of the day (small) - I forget the accompanying meat (pancetta?) and mushrooms. My parents first taste of risotto which they likened to a thick Chinese porridge (jook). Good flavor with added shaved Parmesan for extra richness. $14.00 \n4. Pappardelle with short ribs (small) - Wide, lasagna-like egg noodles with a braised short rib meat and a hearty brown sauce. This dish was just okay and didn't wow anyone. $12.00 \nEntrees \n1. Grilled Pork Chop - Cooked to a pinkish medium, the 1.5 inch bone-in meat was hearty and flavorful. The accompaniments were only okay; not a knock-your-socks-off version like Spruce. $24.00 \n2. Seared John Dory - This flaky white fish was cooked perfectly for my father. It had a crusty top while the meat stayed moist. $26.00 \n3. Stuffed Quail - Very interesting presentation and flavors. It comes to the table in a medium sized black cast iron container. After showing the contents, the server then re-plates the contents to a normal ceramic plate. In trying a bite, it was interesting and, though the menu didn't state it as an ingredient, had an anchovy-like after taste. I liked the Swiss chard that came with this. $25.00 \n4. New York Steak - My brother ordered it medium rare and he did not complain about it. Silence is golden. $29.00 \nSides \n1. White Corn with Golden Chanterelles - Nice perk of being in the Bay Area is having seasonal vegetables at their sweetest when in season. $7.00 \n2. Fingerling Potatoes - Six long wedges of hearty potatoes. Did not try, but my brother's silence says it all. $5.00 \nDessert \n1. Butterscotch Budino - Think of a chocolate mousse-like pudding topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. $8.00 \n2. Brutti Ma Buoni - This translates to Hazelnut cookies (four) served on a plate with a Chocolate-etched \"Happy Birthday\". The menu also describes this as \"Ugly but Good\" which was appropriate. Complimentary \n\nOverall, this was a nice dining experience which highlights the chef's rustic cooking style. Prior to ordering, the servers also brought some bread sticks with a pesto dipping sauce and later individual rolls. Service was excellent as our water and iced tea were repeatedly refilled. I don't remember how his cooking compared to his Scala's time, but I think this menu is more memorable.", "author": "Mike C."}

For some reason, we were escorted to the big marble table right by the kitchen - and we could see what was going on there- and though it wasn't quiet, it was certainly a more private space than the tables in the front of the restaurant that were much closer together.\n\nAnyway, we had very attentive service the whole night, in addition to good recommendations for food. We had a good red wine and I had the Fior d'Arancia cocktail which was slightly sweet and perfect for me. We started with a beet salad served at room temp (props for that - beet salad served cold is criminal!) vitello tonnato, a tasty rendition of the classic dish, and a fritto misto with shrimp and other vegetables with a dipping sauce.\nAbsolutely yummy!  One of us also enjoyed a puree soup of sunchoke that was absolutely sublime, velvety, earthy-tasting and perfectly seasoned.\nThe entrees were sea bass with gigante beans and pasta pillows with a beef mixture served in a very brothy liquid seasoned with savory - we licked our plates clean.\n\nWe were very full by that time, but had two desserts - one a pressed pumpkin spice cake with slices of persimmon and a gelato, and the other one poached plums. Amazingly the plums were sweet and served also with some spiced ice cream. Although the desserts were certainly tasty, we didn't think the combination of ingredients on each plate really had much to do with the other. I forgot to mention that because it was my birthday, they brought a plate of four amazing hazelnut meringue cookies with Happy Birthday written on it in chocolate, omg! Then a little plate of fondant and chocolate pieces arrived which was the end to a great meal. \n\nWould go back again in a heartbeat!", "author": "L A."}

They seated our party of 11 on the 2nd level in our own little divided alcove - it was nice having a little private space. We had one server named Ben taking care of us for the entire four hour meal, and he was great - attentive, informative, and patient, and he checked on us enough times where we never had to flag him down. \n\nI feel we tried everything they had on their current menu from appetizers, to pastas, to main courses, to desserts. I am horrible with remembering names of dishes, but I do recall enjoying the veal-stuffed pasta, butternut squash ravioli, beef short ribs, stuffed quail breast, and duck breast the most. The desserts ranged from a yogurt-tasting flan, burnt caramel flavored gelato, to a heartier chocolate mousse, apple cake and bread pudding concoction. Again, apologies for not being detailed in my descriptions -- really, the dishes just kept coming and we kept eating. \n\nFor drinks I tried the Mandorino cocktail, some Sauvignon Blanc, and espresso.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is intimate, and I found the noise level to be pretty comfortable. Although there were several groups scattered throughout the restaurant, we could converse without having to raise our voices to be heard. \n\nFancy dining, but without the stuck up attitude I feel from more upscale establishments.

We had a reservation for a private room upstairs. I must say, the place is pretty nice. When you first walk in, there's a few seats along the bar/counter. Then you hit the stairs, but beyond that there are some tables as well. When you go up, there's a couple more tables and the private dining room that seats 12-15 people comfortably at a long table. You can see the chefs working in the kitchen from the window!\n\nSince this was a company lunch, it was paid for. The prices are on the higher end, but seeing as this is FiDi, it probably isn't an issue for its clientele. Would I pay out of pocket to come here again? Yes! I'm curious about the dessert some Yelpers are raving about.\n\nI got the pan seared hanger steak, which was really delicious! My first though was, that's it? But then when I started eating it, I got pretty full. Great flavor on the steak. The arugula and squash salad had a nice citrus/vinegar dressing, but not overpowering. Great dish!\n\nThey were good about refilling our drinks. Our food took a while to get to us, but that's probably because we were a big group and had a lot of orders.

The dining experience started out good, we opened a bottle of wine and had the beef carppacio as a appetizer. It was full of flavor and even came topped with a quail egg. Next we ordered the tagliatelle. It looked like ramen noodles with a pile of meet sauce on top. The sauce and noodles did not go together at all, and i have never seen tagliatelle like this. We decided to try something else and the waiter recommended the truffle risotto so we went for it. The rice was crunchy and the over all dish had no flavor. When I asked for the bill I was shocked that the risotto was 65 dollars! I payed anyway and sat in the restaurant waiting for them to bring out something, anything with a candle to say happy birthday to her, but it never happened. This made me upset because I had let them know it was her birthday when we got there. I wasn't going to say anything but I was unhappy and wanted to let the manager know. When I told him everything he said the food how was sapposed to be this way. He ended up saying he would take the risotto off the bill and the credit would go back on my card but I still have yet to get the refund.

We had a leisurely meal with a friend, two bottles of wine, and a bunch of shared plates.\n\nThe Salumi Misti - a mixed plate of house-cured meats, was good but not quite great.  Nothing in particular stood out, though it did certainly satisfy any salt/fat cravings we might have had.  We also tried the baked octopus ( surprisingly good in texture and flavor ) and the smoked cod and frisee salad ( nice flavors, well-balanced ).\n\nAlso tried some pastas: Agnolotti Dal Plin and Tajarin.  The fresh pasta was spot-on in texture, and perfectly paired with the sauces.  Would definitely order more pasta next time.  Brussels Sprouts on the side were perfectly roasted, nice and dark.  Also had a nicely cooked fish entree.\n\nWe had the small size of pasta dishes and they were perfectly possible to share between three curious diners.  The menu is interesting enough that we were thinking of ordering more dishes, but the food is filling enough that we ended up not needing to do it.\n\nThe wine list is long and confusing - unless you know more about Italian wine than most people will ever learn.  Both the sommelier and our server were helpful in choosing something decent once we indicated some taste preferences and a price range. ( though the sommelier's indication that Italian wines tend not toward the fruity/jammy was perhaps put to the test by our second selection of a Valpolicella Superiore without his assistance.).\n\nOverall, it's very good and sometimes great Italian food, appropriately priced.

No veal, no basic pastas, and featured 2 of my least favorites vegetables: cauliflower and brussel sprouts.  Overall deserves 1* for value, but I've added an extra star because the service was outstanding.  If you must eat here I'd recommend ordering a bunch of appetizers which looked far better than the entree menu.", "author": "Boris G."}

The first time, despite the fact that we had a reservation, they made us wait for 10 minutes in their awkward entrance before giving us the table. Second time, same thing, again, despite the reservation. I did not feel welcomed. It was 5:30 pm on a Friday night, and the restaurant was still pretty empty. Before we sat down, I asked if we could get the corner table next to where the host intended to sit us. She refused, saying that someone had requested it. Later on, I asked our table neighbors if they had indeed asked for this specific table, and the lady told me: \"No, I made the reservation on OpenTable, it's our first time here.\" It made me wonder why the host refused to accommodate a pretty simple ask. Were we underdressed? Too gay for her taste? We'll never know, but one thing is for sure: I am not coming back. When paying a $100 for dinner, I expect better service than this. If you HAVE to go there, try the panna cotta.", "author": "Cecile P."}

A bit steep and while I don't expect huge portions, they can be rather tiny. I recall eating there may years ago for a bachelor's party dinner; we all split the cost evenly and it still seemed high.

He began salad prepared with marinated root vegetables, beautiful golden beets and a tasty vinaigrette.  I opted to skip the traditional appetizer menu and start with the small portion of the handcut tagliatelle with five hour pork sugo and porcini mushrooms.   The pasta was delicate and the the pork was amazingly rich and lovely.  If I close my eyes I can still taste it.  \n\nFor our mains, I opted from the risotto with black chanterelles, smoked pancetta, swiss chard and parmigiano reggiano, was fabulously rich and the pancetta was perfect.

I almost didn't want to share, but what can you do? \n\nEverything here was amazing, honestly.

If all business lunches turned out as good as this one, I'd do that shit all of the time. Unfortunately my business lunches are usually me in front of a laptop sucking down from flaming lava-hot ramen. Not even the good kind, but the kind you buy at the grocery for 20 cents a package.\n\nWe were seated in the table that is sort of in the kitchen area, which was very cool. I enjoyed a nice glass of wine and our server was very knowledgeable about the wine selection, which was handy. I'm no wine snob, I choose wine by the picture on the bottle, so it is exciting when I say \"I'd like a wine like such-and-such\" and they come back with exactly that and can tell you the particular region and climate pattern that the grapes were grown in.\n\nWe had the salumi small plate and another one with cheese and balsamic tomatoes - the cheese I don't remember the name, but it was like a house-made creamier version of mozzarella. Very tasty. The salumi plate actually got my friend to start eating cured meats, I think. She wasn't a fan until she tried the ones at the restaurant. \n\nAnd I didn't eat anyone else's food, but the pasta with the braised rabbit and chanterelles gets an A+. I always like to go for things I'd never make at home. My only wish would have been for more mushrooms. I can never have enough. The rabbit was fantastic and tender and not the least bit gamey.\n\nWe split a few desserts as well, the ugly cookies (which were actually MUCH better two days later), the chocolate/hazelnut gelato/cake item (which was rich but quite good), and they also brought out (gratis!) a meringue filled with lemon marscapone and plum sorbetto (?). \n\nEverything was quite good. Very business lunch clientele. I felt that many important things were being discussed at other people tables. The future of the business world was being created over filled pastas and gnocchi.

My partner and I dined at Perbacco on New Year's for our anniversary.  We had 8:15pm reservations and were promptly seated in a corner booth on the first level.  Since it was NYE, the restaurant full, and many of the tables arranged in close proximity to one another, we were prepared to sit closely amongst others.  To our pleasant surprise the corner booth had access to the festive atmosphere, but at the same time added privacy and extra wiggle room.\n\nService: Top Notch - Five Stars!  We were nearly completely sold from the beginning when our server handed us a 'Happy Anniversary' card on behalf of Perbacco.  Throughout the night, our server also paid extra attention to ensure we enjoyed ourselves - the ideal amount of attention and privacy.  From the server to the hostess, each employee we encountered congratulated our celebratory event, which we didn't really expect, and therefore could not help but be thankful and impressed.  At the end of the evening the restaurant also provided complimentary cookies & chocolates with 'Happy Anniversary' etched in chocolate.\n\nFood/Drink:  Delicious!  We started with two Negronis on the rocks - they were superb.  For appetizers we split a Beet Salad and the Fritto Misto.  Also, as it was NYE, Perbacco served complimentary seasoned lentils.  All were great.  My favorite was the Beet Salad - the red and yellow beets were fresh, slightly sweet, and cooked perfectly with just the right amount of Castelmagno cheese, microgreens, and chestnut crumble accompaniments.  The Fritto Misto, nicely paired with their lemon aioli, was satisfying & filling - great starter for big eaters.  For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Pappardelle with Short Rib Ragu and my partner had the Garganelli with Duck Ragu.  We were pretty full after the appetizers, but still managed to finish both pastas (small size).  Each pasta dish was cooked a nice al dente and the ragus both wonderfully, rustically flavorful.  The horseradish in my Short Rib Ragu cut the richness of the ragu well with its pungency and zest.  \n\nOverall:  A great special occasion restaurant - we would not hesitate to return!

But honestly, I've never had such a rampant disregard for my tastebuds at these prices in my entire life. The first time I went, I ordered a $90 dinner just for myself, because I wanted to try the best that Perbacco--ranked third in the city by some--had to offer. Octopus and beef tongue salad, white truffle and oxtail risotto (off their seasonal white truffle menu), and tahitian sea salt caramel ice cream rounded up my order. I have but one word to say: SALT. It wasn't just that there was too much of it, to the point that I was actually gagging in the restroom before my end-meal cup of coffee, but the food itself was so tasteless that even if the only flavor available to the palate was not salt, one would have been disappointed. It was clear that the restaurant had confused subtlety with blandness.\n\nI spoke to the owner when I was at barbacco (which oddly has far superior food--and the same chef), and he offered me a second chance, on the house, to enjoy the food. I took him up on it a couple months later. This time, I ordered a gamut of delicacies and staples, from rabbit to a simple salad. I once again have a single word: SALT. The guy next to me at the restaurant returned his spaghetti and meatballs (as well as every other dish but the wine), and when we spoke I discovered that he had traveled for the last 40 years while with the Navy, tasting and loving cuisine from across the globe. When he left, the bartender shook her head sadly at me and said \"some people just don't have a refined enough palate to recognize delicious food, you know?\" Oh contraire.\n\nMy mother is a caterer and I absolutely adore salt for its restorative properties to most every meal. In this case, not only was it overused to an extreme degree, but it wouldn't have helped even if it had been sprinkled with the restraint of a starving farming family saving its salt reserves to give in blocks to its two tiring horses. In other words, the chef couldn't mask the tastelessness of the food with his liberal salting, no matter how hard he tried.", "author": "Joshua R."}

For the amount of money they charge, make the food taste better!!!  Definitely not going back, although there is a seafood restaurant next door that looks tempting.  I might try that next though and just skip this place entirely.  I don't understand all these 4-5 stars this place is getting here on Yelp.", "author": "Kay T."}

The sommelier was so nice and helped us pick a wonderful bottle of champagne and a really great bottle of wine.  He listened to what we wanted and suggested affordable bottles (he didn't automatically go for the most expensive bottles on the list) that both ended up being really good.\n\nOur server was also great - he knew the menu well and answered all our questions like a pro.  He also struck that perfect balance of anticipating our needs and handling them before we had to ask, but not being at all intrusive.  I was really impressed with the service.  \n\nFor food, we had the Pesce Crudo (big eye tuna) which was pretty good, although I enjoyed my husband's Piastra Roasted Octopus even more (tender and flavorful).  We also had the Tajarin and Papardelle pastas, which were both good -- I particularly liked the papardelle - really rich, delicious and meaty!  For my entree I had the seared scallops - they were awesome!  I'm kind of particular about the texture of scallops and I like it when they are firm, but tender, and these scallops were cooked perfectly - the tiniest bit of crunch on the outside and nice and tender on the inside.  They also came in this garlicy sauce that was delicious!  My husband had the beef short rib -- he said it was good, but not the best he's ever had.  \n\nFor dessert we had the \"ugly, but good\" cookies and the caramel/sea salt gelato.  The cookies are really light and airy with hazelnuts in the middle and the gelato had a creamy, delicious caramel flavor with bits of sea salt in it - I thought both were outstanding.\n\nWe were completely stuffed leaving Perbacco, but it was an all-around great dining experience - really delicious food, great wine and top notch service - can't ask for more than that!", "author": "Erin L."}

The table was tucked in a quiet corner so we could sit caddy-corner instead of across from each other, another plus.  \n\nBeing foodies we tend to order two dishes for every course of the meal and share them.  Perfect way to taste a vast amount of menu.  \n\nWe started with the roasted baby beets & strawberry arugula salad.  The beets were roasted to bring out each type of beets delicate flavor.  The arugula salad was tangy yet sweet at the same time.  A plate of trotter cakes were sent out as well.  Trotter is exactly what you are thinking, piggy feet.  The meat was shredded and fried inside a pressed cake, surprisingly tender and sweet.\n\nThe next course was pasta.  We shared the tasting for two.  Our two were potato gnocchi with duck ragu and ligurian pasta with pesto sauce.  The gnocchi were light and airy.  They were tasty little pillows drenched in a rich duck ragu.  The ligurain pasta was a nice contrast with the bright pesto sauce.\n\nThe main courses were sea bass and duck with stone fruit.  The sea bass's skin was crispy and the flesh just flaked apart.  The duck tasted great but was a little hard to break down to eat.  \n\nThe last course was the best, thanks to pastry chef Suzanne LaFleur.  We had the honey panna cotta, with fennel pollen and honeycomb.  The panna cotta had a luscious texture that made it move like it had a mind of its own.  The flavor was clearly honey without being over powering.  The honey comb which accompanied the panna cotta was crispy and a wonderful compliment of textures.  \n\nWe also had the gianduja, which is a dark chocolate and hazelnut prailine bar, which is served with a caramelized cocoa nib gelato.  Where the panna cotta was delicate, this was the opposite rich and imposing.  The flavors of hazelnut and chocolate were meant to be together.  Pastry Chef LaFleur marries them in a way that punches you in the face with flavor.  Each bite is better than the last.\n\nOverall an amazing meal, but the last course was the best.", "author": "Megan P."}

The service was great and we were seated at the chef's table near the kitchen. The acoustics were better in this area than (what I remember) the main part of the restaurant. The issue for me was, since I was here last, I became a vegetarian and I felt that the pasta choices were limited - but, maybe I felt this way because I couldn't have the dishes that I use to have. But, I did recommend the parpadelle that I use to get, and my friends did not seem to love it.\n\nWe did get the small meat sampling platter.

While the wine here was quite good, I had a first time rabbit experience with devil's gulch rabitt in spiced red wine sauce that did not go quite too well.

One was a bit chewy with some substance, the other was like a dry chicken breast, and the other piece was a soft bland piece of meat either way undercooked or way overcooked.  Either way, there was no flavor to the meat (maybe I just got a bad rabbit or they just got the most recent roadkill from Golden Gate Park) but it was flavorless even with being in the spicy red wine sauce.\n\nThe roasted pear salad was also a bit flavorless for my tastes and the apple/squash crostata dessert was just a fancy name for a circular shaped sized apple pie without the crust.

It was really good. The short rib was very tasty, it was like pulled-beef slow cooked in gravy, the sauce tasted like stew.\n\nTAJARIN - HANDCUT TAGLIATELLE / 5 HOUR PORK SUGO / PORCINI MUSHROOM - I think this is what my co-workers ordered. I was a little put off by the top ramen looking noodles and the bolognese looking sauce.

It would have been too large a dish for me to finish alone. They served it with roasted apples along side, they looked like potatoes.

To our delight, we were seated immediately at an excellent table.  Our service was pleasant, informative and unobtrusive throughout.   \n\nExcellent (and strong!) drinks in hand, we started with the hamachi crudo with citrus and the burrata with jerusalem artichokes.  The burrata and the artichokes were fantastic.  The hamachi was good but lacked a bit of acidity and flavor in general.  The lightness was a good foil for both the burrata and the pasta that was to come.\n\nWe chose to do the three pasta tasting.  I was *super* bummed that the risotto is not an option (risotto with duck, butternut squash and caramelized onions, you are on notice for next time!).  We made a quick decision to add the agnolotti dal plin which was fantastic.  I'm always blown away at how such a small filled pasta can have the most intense flavor.  I had the same experience at Cuoco in Seattle. Our other pasta selections were the tajarin (nothing special, sad to report) and agnoli with rabbit which was almost as fantastic as the agnolotti.   After sopping up the sauce with their lovely bread, I was shocked to have enough room for dessert.\n\nI'm a complete sucker for all things salted caramel so their burnt caramel gelato with sea salt was a no brainer.  It was SO delicious.  Perfect consistency and flavor.  It was served with wonderful pine nut cookies that had a texture and flavor reminiscent of marshmallow.  Delicious!

As a solo diner, I got a lot of advice re some of the best things on the menu. I reserved my seat at the bar on opentable.com and was warmly greeted by the hostesses. I started with the hamachi crudo with fennel and grapefruit. This dish was amazing. The flavors were perfection. My fish was very fresh, and I savored every bite. \n\nMy second course was something from the house-made salumi category: the pork liver terrine. . . mind, you, I would not have picked this dish from just looking at the menu, but Joe suggested it might be a nice interesting second course, and he was right. A slice of the terrine accompanied by some sort of fruit gastrique and whole grain mustard. Very rich, but a small enough portion, it wasn't overwhelming. \n\nLast dish, the small portion (you could select the dinner sized portion) of the ricotta gnocci. I've never tasted gnocci so light and flavorful. I'm used to a potato based gnocci, which can be very heavy. This one was made from whole wheat flour, I believe, and accompanied by a fresh variety of mushrooms. \n\nNice wine list, with sizes from by the glass, to 1/4 L and 3/4 L.

What a find.\nMy gent and I are bar people in the sense we love to dine at the bar even when fine dining.  The perspective is more authentic to us, and the views are always more fun.  People watching, interacting, etc.  We began with the tuna appetizer, which was exquisite, delicate and balanced.  For our second course we chose the gnocchi with an incredible, creamy, veal ragu.  Little pillows of pure love.  Finally, we enjoyed the short ribs with polenta and black truffle.  The flavors were so deep, so succulent, a definitive win.  \nI certainly love my vino, but am admittedly far from a connoisseur.  Thus, we placed faith in our server/bartender to recommend wines for each course- best decision we could have made.  His choices were positively incredible, enhancing each dish to a greater level.

It's more like Mario Batali in a g-string. Ewww...scatch that. Maybe Gina Lollobrigida wearing a bodice in a B-movie. Perbacco actually bills itself as northern Italian with a touch of Provence. I guess that means Neapolitan pizza and eggplant parmigiana are out of the question here. That's OK because the menu does look pretty good.\n\nI had the $17 Grilled Lamb Tagliata topped with a mint salsa verde and accompanied with a warm butter bean salad. Delicioso. I had a taste of my dining companion's $16 Pappardelle in a Braised Short Rib Ragu with golden chanterelles and sprinkled with parmigiano reggiano. Really delicioso. I made a mistake. Can we switch? No? Damn. But I did start with a no-brainer, the $8 Roasted Red and Golden Beets with arugula and castelmagno cheese in a white balsamic vinaigrette. Very good if a bit skimpy.\n\nI went yesterday for lunch with the recruiters who helped me land my new job. We could barely hear each other since the noise level is fairly unbearable, and the space feels a bit cramped despite the handsome decor.

Meh.\n \nWe tried several dishes, starting with the herb ricotta gnocchi with roasted wild mushrooms and the potato gnocchi with duck ragu (the former was weak, the latter was a'ight) and then the beef short ribs and duck sugo (again, former was poor, the latter was good).

Easy and fast with opentable and you get points. \n\nParking was easy and when we entered the restaurant, I was just staring at the open kitchen in the back. The decor and the workers here are so friendly! We were greeted by the hostess right away with a smile. \n\nWe got seated up stairs, which is a more intimate dining area. It's out from all the bustling noise downstairs and I liked it more up stairs because the tables are not as together as the ones downstairs. We sat down and the team at Perbacco was so nice, they even had a birthday card for me! I think that is how a business should be run. \n\nThe menu looked great, lots of options, vegetarians and meat eaters. \n\nStarted with:\nHamachi ($12)-It came with four think slices! Fresh and so delicious! Had lemon zest on top and red chile? I didn't care for that but it was still really good without it.\nFritto Misto of Rock Shrimp ($11)- The shrimp was fried to perfection! It was all shrimp. There was also fried green beans, olives, and fennel, served with a lemon aioli. MmmmMMmm. I miss that already!\n\nEntree:\nRecommended by our awesome waiter, Sr. Juan, Pappardelle ($16.00)- It tasted like homemade pasta, which I think really was homemade, with duck, and some kinda ragu, forgot. It was really good too. Finished it pretty fast!\nGrilled Ribeye steak ($29.00)- Grilled JUST the way I LOVE IT. It was awesome. i only wish they served with with a side like fingerling potatoes or something. The plate looked empty. I didn't care for the butter served on top, AT ALL though.. It tasted kinda like something was molding. Bad after taste. But I finished the steak so that means it's good!\n\nDessert:\nPear bread pudding ($8.00)- It looked more like a muffin without the paper on the bottom served with vanilla gelatin and mandarin marmellata. Looks can be deceiving! The pear bread pudding was really good. Good flavor of the pear you can taste the custardness of the pudding. Make sure you get a scoop of the bread pudding with the vanilla.

I mean, how am I suppose to support a pancake arranged on a dish Denny's level of style and presentation?\n\nMy good friend's friend was visiting from AZ for work and since I had missed connecting with her for several years, I had to delay my dinner plans with J and met at Schroeder's.  R volunteered Perbacco and since I had never been, jumped at the chance of trying a new place, plus to possibly review and check out the interior of the establishment.\n\nFirst, let me state that I am all about interiors and ambiance.  I believe this truly enhances the eating process and Perbacco did an excellent job of this.  The establishment is a sleek and modern rendition of Northern Italian hospitality, echoed in the use of warm neutrals and lighting floored firmly by the rustic brick wall behind the bar.  Good thing I was in my suit, because 99% of the people here were in coats, and it must have been the destination spot for all the good looking people in suits from the Financial District.\n\nR ran into a friend of his standing at the bar, who apparently knew the staff and the owner, and fantastically procured a banquette for us when one opened up.  Since I had already ruined my slight alcoholic tolerance earlier at Schroeder's, I declined to partake in anything special here, but did elect the Navarro Pinot Noir Juice, priced beautifully at $5.  They presented this in a wine glass and suddenly, people thought I was sipping some Pinot.  Brilliant.\n\nOnce seated, I was too busy checking out the interior and distracted by the group of suits behind us making loud discussion about an X-box game I had played in earnest (Gears of War, come on now!) but my dear friends ordered items off the menu upon the advice of our server, who was actually quite learned with the items listed and he advised that we start off with several of the appetizers (personally, they all looked quite appealing to me.)\n\nT h e O r d e r\n\nSALAME - NOSTRANO / FINOCCHIONA / SANGUINATO / TOSCANO / SALAME COTTO D'ASTI\n\nA fantastic platter for the virgin to antipasti and all cured vivid meats.  Arranged artfully, the meats were arranged by type and came accompanied with little pieces of crostini as well as a sweet honey type marmalade and little gherkins.  R's special Perbacco friend questioned the use of forks, so I used my fingers to select pieces of the Toscano/Nostrano/Finocchiona (I'm a sucker for these extreme rush of tastes piqued by the curing process, the wine-garlic-herbs mix) slices gingerly and nibbled on the very rich and salty meat.\n\nHAMACHI / SHAVED FENNEL / BLOOD ORANGE ESSENCE / OLIVE OIL\n\nExquisite and thick slices of the buttery hamachi, topped with shaved fennel, olive oil and slices of jalapeno peppers.  A beautifully textured piece of a gourmand's dream.  Remember to redip the hamachi into the olive oil for smooth transfer of senses.\n\nBURRATA CHEESE / MARINATED FRIARELLI PEPPERS / WHITE ANCHOVY / ARUGULA\n\nResembled a little bag of fresh mozzarella, but the burrata cheese was milky smooth on the outside with a slight ricotta texture on the inside.  A mild tasting cheese, collecting a bit of the cheese in addition to the bitter arugula and the savory peppers and anchovy brought a fresh burst of a combination of tastes in my mouth.  Exquisite.\n\nFRITTO MISTO OF ROCK SHRIMP / GREEN BEANS / OLIVES / FENNEL / LEMON AIOLI\n\nNot the surprising course of the bunch.  Think tempura style, but the Japanese version offering a bit more on the crunchy and less oily side.  However, I was in love with the little fried balls of rock shrimp.  The lemon aioli was slightly bland, perhaps in due part that the lemon flavor was a little too mild for my tastes.  I ended up dipping it into the sweet marmalade that accompanied the cured meats plate. Fried green beans were not too entertaining, but anything fried tastes good these days.\n\nThis impressive display of vibrant textures as well as bursting flavors and the expert melding of greens and peppers to fold rather than diminish existing surprises to our palate.  The dinner was made even more enjoyable with Umberto Gibin, the part owner, assisting in the deliver of our plates.\n\nI had to leave early from this wonderful presentation to meet up with a coworker, but will return to partake in the entree portion of their menu.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been impressed with artful Northern Italian fare and with the surprise introduction enhanced by the excellent service, Perbacco has restored my faith.", "author": "Miika M."}

PERFECTO!\n\nThis place won't jump out at you but is rather hidden amongst the giant skyscrapers in the Financial District but right when you walk inside, you know you've entered the Palace of Fine Dining.\n\nCame with a group of 6 with lunch reservations at around 115PM. Once we entered, we were promptly seated after a wait of a few minutes. I don't know what it is about Perbacco....maybe it's been I've never eaten lunch at such a nice restaurant before...but I felt like I was Leonardo DiCaprio walking down that spiral stairwell, getting ready for dinner like a King. \n\nMight I say that the customer service is superb? They were very attentive but not too attentive (if you know what I mean). 5 stars for that.\n\nBefore your food comes out, they start you off with these crispy breadsticks dipped in this pesto sauce. Delicious. I could not get my hands off them. I truly believe you can tell how good a restaurant is going to be based on what type of bread they serve you. \n\nAnd for the food? I ordered the Pan Seared Hanger Steak. I can still picture the overall pinkness of the insides, while the outsides were seared to perfection. Couple that with some greens...best lunch ever.\n\nRoom for dessert? Oh hell yes. Get the Bonet (chocolate custard). Get the Bonet. Get the Bonet. That's all I gotta say.\n\nJob well done, Perbacco.

Quality, diversity, and decent pricing. Above all else, not a lot of bullshit text.  Direct and to the point is just how I like it!  We started off with a lambrusco to cut the fat on some amazing meats.\n\nThe Salumi plate is remarkable.  All house-made meat, there was a wide array that satisfied a table of 5 hungry drinkers.  I can't begin to describe the wonders on that fleshy platter, so just go in an order one for yourself.  I'll probably be found at the bar soon enough with a crossword puzzle, a cocktail and a big plate of these meats. \n\nAppetizers were really good as well. The mixed fried stuff was tasty, but seemed to be entirely beans and shrimp, and if I had any complaint, it was a minor one that the aioli was a tad too tangy.  The trotter cake was above reproach and I wish I had gotten more than 2 small bites.\n\nThe pasta is 99% house made and also contains 99% of the salt in the Pacific Ocean.  I can only imagine what it would have tasted like if I had accepted the offer of grated cheese over the salt.\n\nEntrees were really really rough.  The duck breast was fine but not impressive, while the little piece of confit or whatever it was tasted like someone had poured an entire bottle of cheap pumpkin pie spices over it.  It was no more enjoyable than chewing a mouthful of cloves.\n\nThe veal was a fantastic example of poorly executed sous vide.  The mushy meat was well seasoned, but the texture made it miserable to eat.  Even the brussels sprouts, which I have enjoyed here in the past, tasted like they had been doused in sand.", "author": "Quinn S."}

I am well traveled in Italy, and I do not find the food at all authentic or tasty.  The fritto misto was too misto -- fine to add some lemon slices and fennel to the seafood, but this was all fried green beans, olives, big chunks of fennel, and a few shrimp.  The dipping sauce was flavorless.  The crab and hearts of palm was also disappointing:  there was a generous amount of crab, but the bitter, canned taste of the palm was overwhelming.  My friend had a pasta with duck that had a predominant flavor of vinegar.  The bread was a plain white roll.\nThis place is certainly not the best Italian in San Francisco by a long shot.

You will not find Tuscan, Sicilian, or Italo-American cuisine here, but rather classics of Northwestern Italy, done well!\n\nI had the side of **brown butter brussels sprouts with capers, shallots, and parmigiano reggiano** as a starter, and these were reallyyyy tasty.  There were some crispy bits, but for the most part it was a smooth blend of all the flavors, and the capers and parmigiano really added to this side dish.\n\nMy main dish was the **quadrati d'anatra** which were agnolotti (like ravioli) with duck, and an orange-rosemary arrosto sauce over them, sprinkled with hazelnuts.  It was very tasty, and reminded me a lot of the agnolotti I had in Torino, but with the brightness of duck and orange flavor instead of the darker beef and red wine flavors.\n\nWe were also both curious about the **Tajarin** pasta, which were handcut tagliatelle with \"5-hour pork sugo.\"  This dish was surprising in that it is so very simple --just a plate of tagliatelle with a generous splash of sauce in the center-- but it was no less exciting than the other dishes.  Definitely more of a \"comfort\" dish, with a delicious pork red sauce.\n\nOf all the flashy places in the Financial District that can impress visually, I think Perbacco is one of the better in actually serving quality cuisine that is well thought out.  I'll try and find an excuse to be back soon.", "author": "David W."}

Every single dish that came to the table was grossly under salted and spiced. We ordered a lot as we are people that believe in tasting a piece of everything, so it's sad to have nothing nice to say. Being someone that juice cleanses often, I'm also sensitive to restaurants that over salt. The fact that I had to add salt and pepper in this instance to everything is pretty horrific. Even the sea bass my mom ordered (while fresh) was grossly under salted. If choosing btw Mina's spot next door or this spot, default for next door.

The food is well prepared, European-style (small or \"demure\") portions served in a modern and bright restaurant setting. The restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside. I've heard that there's also a small mezzanine dining room from which you can see the action in the kitchen. \n\nThe menu has a small selection of crudo (raw fish slices), we tried the Hamachi seasoned with blood orange and olive oil which was delicious. The appetizer salads (also surprisingly demure) were very tasty (Roasted beets, Heirloom tomato salad), and the pastas (Agnolotti, Pappardelle) that we ordered were also good. For dessert we ordered the roasted pear which we enjoyed very much. Overall, it was a satisfying light dinner.\n\nThe deep red leather-like banquettes were not very comfortable for me. Avoid the inside corner table under the mezzanine area (slatted wood ceiling), there's a cold breeze (air conditioner?) blowing from under the corner seat (ankle level), if given that seat just ask them to give you another table. Service is slow (and in my opinion a little snobbish, or maybe it depends on which waiter you get) but attentive. We might come back to try other dishes.", "author": "Luis C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-06", "description": "I really wanted this review to be better and perhaps the lower rating is due to these high expectations but there were far too many things that were average at best with my experience with the meal.\n\nI had looked through the reviews here and on other sites and many people went on and on about the grand experience here so suffice it say, I was salivating. \n\nThe decor was grand and indicative of a post work eatery in the Financial District of any big city and with its tiled floor and mahogony bar I felt like we were in store for a meal that was so good I'd be tempted to  slap my mama.\n\nLet's get down to it -- \n\nAppetizers\n\n1) Burrata Cheese / Black Olive Condimento / Arugula / Grilled Filone\n2) Roasted Octopus / Saffron Poached Potato / Meyer Lemon Vinaigrette / Salsa Verde\n\nThe Burrata was what you'd expect. Straight forward cheese with a slight bit of resistance when sliced but roasted and creamy when spread on the bread and balanced with the olive.\n\nThe Roasted Octopus however had some winning moments as it was trying to morph into a foie gras with the soft texture and taste. This was a pleasant surprise.\n\nDinner:\n\n1) Two of us had Liberty Farms Duck Breast / Brussels Sprouts And Apples In Padella / Pancetta / Passato Di Sancrau\n2) Coniglio Al Civet - Devil's Gulch Rabbit / Spiced Red Wine Sauce / Otto File Polenta\n3) Beef Short Rib Stracotto / Root Vegetable Pur\u00e9e / Roasted Golden Turnips And Cipolline\n\nThe duck breast that I and a friend had wasn't tender even though it was presented medium rare and sadly a tough duck really is a mess. The brussel sprouts were decently prepared but didn't bring a redeeming factor to the meal.\n\nMy wife had the rabbit and the saltiness was a bit overpowering and the sauce didn't compliment the meal in the least. It was as if the sauce was the star as opposed to the pasta portions.\n\nThe winner of the meal was certainly the short ribs as noted by other posts. It won far and away as the other meals certainly left us flat but also because it's just done correctly. The meat was tender and braised and matched so well with the pasta. \n\nIf I were to ever go back I'd certainly have that meal but I doubt that I will.\n\nThere were some great aspects to the restaurant -- the drinks were made very well and were replaced with an easy frequency. And the overall bill was only 200.35 for the food and with a total of 10 beverages. \n\nI do have to say that our service was a seriously negative factor with the meal. Our server was hard to locate and hear, granted the place was full and she was scampering about trying to attend to far too many tables. One really odd part of the evening was when we were totaling up the bill -- we each were paying 60 dollars. So like any we have done in many other restaurants, we threw in a myriad of payment options. One person threw in 60 in cash and the I and another person decided to use a credit card. \n\nWhen we gave the server the bill, I said please put 120 on my card, 60 on the other card and use the cash as well. When I got the bill back I had a total of 140 and the cash was gone. Apparently she was so enamored with her service of avoidance and whispers that she gave herself a sixty dollar tip. Now it's not too far off from the 40 we were leaving but I'd never heard of anything like that before.\n\nIt was a slight hassle correcting the matter but at least it was done with. Just an odd experience overall.\n\nI would recommend this place as a great spot to meet and greet for drinks and maybe eating at the bar but as for a dinner, there are more than enough restaurants in SF to venture to.", "author": "gerald d."}

It took a while before our waiter inquired about what we wanted to drink. \n\nHowever, after we ordered our appetizers it didn't take long before they arrived.  We ordered  Hamachi (yellowtail) with blood orange essence, shaved fennel, and orange oil, and ligurian salt cod with potato gratin and crostini.  The Hamachi was good, but it was difficult to savor the fish because the orange oil and essence were too overpowering.  As much as I love Hamachi, I don't think I'd order this particular dish again.  The salt cod was too salty for my liking.  Even with the crostini and bread sticks, I was still unable to enjoy it.\n\nAfter a somewhat disappointing appetizer, I looked forward to my seared tuna entree; but that, too, was disappointing.  The tuna was seared alright, but the portion of the tuna that was uncooked was still frozen!  I should've followed my friends' lead and tried their pasta, instead.  I had a bite of the pasta and preferred it to my fish.  Try the Pappardelle, you won't be disappointed if you eat red meat and like mushrooms.\n\nThis place was batting 0 for 2, so I decided to pass on dessert.\n\nThe interior is modern and comfortable.  \n\nEven though I was disappointed with my meal, I might be willing to give Perbacco another shot.

I think the white veggie was cauliflower paired with leeks.  The menu stated black truffle salad.  Sadly, since I've never had black truffle, who knows if that was on my plate.\n\nBurnt caramel gelato:  SO good.  4.75.  Came with pine nut cookies, and the gelato was sprinkled with Tahitian sea salt.  Sweet and salty.  Can't go wrong with that.\n\nService:  Spectacular, minus the aforementioned tea incident.

It was a Saturday night, and the place was PACKED. So glad we made a reservation!\n\nSince this dinner out was part of my Christmas present, Nate let me pick everything we would be eating that night. YES!\n\nWe started with the Roasted Pear Salad with caramel vinaigrette, gorgonzola crema, and candied hazelnuts. So yummy; sweet, yet savory.\n\nNext course I chose the Tortelli Di Ciapin-Abe - Pasta filled with roasted sunchokes with sage butter, hedgehog mushrooms, and radicchio. I was expecting Tortellini noodles, which I adore, but it was more like Ravioli. Still very, very good.\n\nFor our main course, I chose the Liberty Farm Duck Breast with Roasted Pears, Butternut Squash Passato and Antica Formula Duck Jus. I have never had duck before, but OH! This was SO good. The meat was tender and flavorful. I absolutely loved it!\n\nDessert was the Burnt Caramel Gelato with Vanilla Sea Salt. This was what most of the reviewers were raving about, and I didn't even need to look at a dessert menu after reading all about it. And it was AMAZING!\n\nThe service was great; our glasses were never empty, and someone was always clearing or bringing out a dish.

There was a crisp urban feel about the restaurant when I last visited. Tonight it just felt noisey, crowded and  very ordinary.\n\nPerbacco  was packed on a Monday night  most folks appeared not to be  locals, perhaps they were all part of the 20000 convention members.   The service was attentive, although our waiter noted but did not ask about our half eaten main courses.\nThe starters of a fritto (which was not cooked hot enough) and a tartar which was fresh  were passable, but half way through the main courses my friend said, \"Room service was better!\"  I had the stuffed quail which was over cooked and tasted steamed and was on a mess of greens with both some kind of creamy sauce and a sauce of poultry,  It was all gooey.  His \"nettle lasagnetta\" was also gummy, thick with little taste of nettle and only a slight resemblance to lasagne and he said it had \"specks of meat in it\". \n\nI wonder what has happened here I certainly will not go back, but perhaps it was Monday and the chef was off  --oops I mean away--certainly the chef was off.", "author": "maria B."}

At Perbacco, most of these things definitely applied certainly, but really, it was the little things that impressed me the most, such as when our server offered us tastings of wines-by-the-glass when we asked for recommendations to go with our courses.\n\nAs for the food...\n\nHamachi with preserved lemon and chili peppers -- 4 large slabs of raw hamachi, drizzled with olive oil.  I felt the dish could have used a bit of acid, but the peppers were not overly spicy and the preserved lemon added a bit of pleasant bitter tang.\n\nRoasted Octopus - octopus tentacles, fingerling potatoes and haricot verts salad. Couldn't get enough of this dish - note that unfortunately one gets only about 4 tentacles of the most perfect and tender-roasted octopus...\n\nRisotto Milanese - listed on the menu as a \"saffron risotto / slivered foie gras / nettle puree\"\nWe ordered the large portion, and servers brought out 2 split and vrey generous servings for each of us.  It's presented to you rather dramatically with the shocking yellow saffron rice surrounding around 3 very thin slices or medallions (\"shavings\") of foie, and a tiny quenelle of nettles.  Each individual component tastes just ok on its own, but once you mix the lot together (smear the already- melting foie around with the nettles and gooey rice), the taste is orgasmic.\n\nAs for entrees, the boy chose the monkfish with wild mushrooms, beans and truffle butter -- I could smell the truffles as I sat across the table from him.  I opted for the milk-braised pork shoulder with polenta and savoy cabbage.  My dish was not exactly the prettiest to look at, but the meat was utterly tender and bursting with good porky flavor and the polenta rich and cheesy.  The boy's monkfish was also fabulous - perfectly cooked and firm and redolent of that singular earthy-heady truffle scent. Oh - and our side dish of roasted brussels sprouts - also fantastic...\n\nDid we have dessert? I believe the boy had a chocolate covered creme brulee served with crisp mini cannolis -- 2 desserts in one... I was absolutely stuffed and nibbled at the edges.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the design inside -- like Aqua next door, the small entrance belies the cavernous, long interior with high soaring ceilings and clean, minimalist lines.  Unlike Aqua, though, Perbacco lacks a bit of warmth and mystery and seems designed more for the high-end expense account power lunches and dinners of FiDi denizens rather than intimate tete-a-tetes with a crush du jour.", "author": "Claudine C."}

For a small portion of the pasta its around $12 or so and only about $4-5 extra to upgrade to a full size portion. Other entrees are $25 and up. \n\nService: Very good.

We're Italian and have travelled in Italy since we were little. Anyway, my boss had brought me here for my birthday also, and I was so excited to see Vitello Tonnato on the menu.  When I told my brother how good the food had been, he offered to bring my family there on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday. \n\nSo I phoned for reservations (7 at 7) but they didn't have anything available at  7. Would 5:30 be oK?  I reluctantly accepted -- we never ate dinner before 7 when we were growing up, but seven people at Perbacco? I understood it was tricky.  My brother and his family live out of town, but we live in the City, so we agreed to make the sacrifice and eat way early. \n\nThe staff had kindly asked if we were celebrating anything when I made the reservation.  I let them know that it was my birthday.  They assured me that detail would be noted on our reservation.  At the appointed hour, We arrived on time .... And were escorted upstairs and seated RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN DOOR. I was horrified. When I commented, sotto voce, \"Oh ...  Right next to the kitchen\", I was insulted by the \"hostess\" who said, \"It's not the kitchen\".  When I asked what it was, she said it was the stairs.  I tried to let it go but the longer we sat there, the worse it got.  There was a constant parade of waiters in & out. Then the odors started. I don't know what they were cooking in those \"stairs\" but it became too much. Thankfully, our designated waiter noticed me fanning the odor away and offered to check about another table. Our new table, despite being close by, proved to be a tremendous improvement. We were able to concentrate on the food, which was as it should be. \n\nWe had the Vitello Tonnato, an old family favorite, and the Salumi Misti, Pappardelle, Gnocchi, and Risotto. The Gnocchi were a huge hit with the children. And our (new) waiter, Rocco, was fantastic. He was not only impeccable, suggesting perfect wines to accompany our meal, but he was absolutely adorable with the children.  \n\nIf it hadn't been for that insulting first table assignment, I'd have given Perbacco 5 Stars. The table next to the swinging kitchen door may be alright to assign to walk-ins, but NOT to guests with (2-week) reservations travelling from out of town for a birthday dinner.

Starstruck Rebecca O. in da hou-ouse! \n\nWhile that was the obvious highlight of our dinner here, I did actually enjoy the food. My ricotta gnocci with mushrooms entree was good, but not special, but my husband's short rib pappardelle (rhymes with R Kelly), was heaven on a plate! I would definitely go back for that dish in a heartbeat. I was equally excited about the salted caramel gelato I inhaled for dessert. I'm really in love with salted caramel ice cream situations these days.\n\nThe dining room acoustics are noisy, so it's not the best choice for folks that are looking for a quiet, intimate ambiance.

Apparently the menu is all from one region of Italy so they didn't have a lot of traditional Italian dishes.  No Alfredo sauce, no marinara sauce,  no ravioli, no chicken anywhere on the menu, no lasagna, no spaghetti, no chicken parm,  no pino grigio, no salads.\n\nThe menu was interesting. I had the shrimp risotto which was pretty good, but they did a poor job of peeling the shrimp which is a fun surprise.   Most others in our group had gnocchi,  which was poor. They were mushy, a weird consistency.   The beef short rib wasn't good either and looked worse than it tasted.   The atmosphere was average.

I didn't have the chicken but it looked perfectly prepared.  The butter leaf lettuce was simple and the dressing light.  They had modestly priced (well relatively) wines that were excellent.

The buttery, flaky crust and topping, and all of the different berries hot and slightly melted...oh...my...GOD...I could have eaten 30 of them.\n\nAlthough I didn't partake - they had the biggest, most diverse cheese display.

The past few weeks have been absolutely crazy and my father's health has deteriorated greatly in so many ways.  He was hospitalized for ten days and is home now, but his dementia, alzheimer's, and poor health has been quite a test for us all.  On a good note, I used some of this hospitalization time as an opportunity to treat my poor saint of a girlfriend who hasn't had a night out in ages (since my dad ordinarily cannot be left alone and has to be watched all the time now, we normally cannot go out together at the same time at night).  If we weren't visiting him at the hospital, we were out and about, dining and drinking.  He is home now so things are back to normal and we absolutely can't get out or get away together at night now, but during that little time we had off, I really tried to make those nights special for her and show her how much I appreciate her and everything she does.  Thanks to Perbacco, I was able to.  Anyway, on to the review!\n\nThe review:\n\nAs everyone knows, I have always loved Perbacco and as such, it only seems logical that this meal turned out to be the most memorable of all the nice dinners and lunches that my girlfriend and I had together recently.  She has been so wonderful to me and my dad and with him temporarily hospitalized, I finally had the opportunity to take her out to dinner, something that has been absolutely impossible otherwise.  \n\nUpon walking in the door, was happy to see that Carla was working behind the bar (nice new haircut!)...she really makes the place and was fantastic as always.  The hostess and people working the front desk were really great too.  As always, the service from everyone we came in contact with was fantastic too.    \n\nSome places just always feel right every time I go there and Perbacco is one of them.  From the moment I walked in, I felt elated and at home in the uplifting environment.  This for me has always been the hallmark of a great restaurant...it's hard to describe, but in a nutshell, it's the convergence of setting, food, decor, and first class service/attitude (in a good way).  It's not just about location either, it's about a place with synergy that is run right and excels in so many ways.  Lake Park Bistro in Milwaukee overlooking Lake Michigan and Flagstaff House in Boulder, CO share a similar magic for me, every time I walk in.\n\nIn addition to the cocktails and then wines, we shared an appetizer of Vitello Tonato - slow roasted veal, lemon and albatore sauce, capers and arugula. She then had the Pappardelle which was wide ribbon pasta ribbons, slow-cooked short rib ragu, roasted cippoline, and grated horseradish. I had the Tajarin which was handcut tagliatelle, 5 hour cooked pork sugo, and porcini mushrooms.\n\nThe waiter we had, Brett, was first-rate and he really added to the experience.  Extremely professional, yet at the same time, genuine and real, he had the calm manner of a seasoned professional and his efforts made for an exceptional dining experience.  When I inquired about available roeros, he instantly suggested a special off-menu Trinita nebbiolo roero ($98) that turned out to be the perfect complement to our meal.  \n\nFor our main course, she had the Beef Short Rib Stracatto with root vegetable passatina, braised escarole, and honey glazed cipoline and carrots. I had the Striped Bass with wild mushroom and Jerusalem artichoke ragout and truffle jus. I specifically asked for no side of spinach and they were more than happy to accomodate.  Looking back, I just realized that I forgot to order the additional side of fingerling potatoes with lardo we wanted, but just as well, we were stuffed anyway. We then had a really nice valpolicella dessert wine (nice!!!) and then she had the Bonte, a wild harvested chocolate custard with whipped cream and amaretti. I had the Sformatino, a carmelized milk chocolate mousse with dark chocolate glaze, cocoa almond streusel, and creme inglese. No complaints here...it was a pricey, but most memorable dining experience for both of us, especially for her as it was her first time here. \n\nOne of my friends, upon hearing that I spent $300 on dinner for two here took a look at the online menu and was surprised that I spent so much.  I explained that we had some nice wines and that when there are as many outstanding items on the menu, it wasn't hard to do at all.\n\nPerbacco...just the mere mention of  the name gives me a warm feeling and makes me dream of heavenly Italian food, celestial pastas with slow cooked sauces, and fine wines in a tasteful, romantic setting.  Special thanks to our server, Brett, and Carla at the bar for a most memorable dining experience.", "author": "Roy N."}

Glad I did.  \n\nThe pork shoulder was unbelievable.  Not really what I was expecting either.  I thought it would be shredded or on the bone.  Instead it was presented like it was a steak, but very tender.  I am guessing it was pan seared after it was slow roasted.

Nevertheless, we were seated upstairs and ordered a bottle of wine and appetizer (a single raviolo with ricotta and spinach $12). If you ask me, that's an expensive raviolo. The had complementary sticks of bread that were unique and innovative and the pesto fresca dipping sauce which accompanied it was pretty good. \n\nFor my entree, being a vegetarian and not wanting gnocchi, I had a limited selection to choose from - I  I had the raviora 'd cosse - pasta filled with roasted butternut squash, sage brown butter and toasted hazelnuts ($16). This entree was way too sweet for my liking and I was left with a meh feeling from it.  I was hoping the dessert would save the night. For dessert we did a three cheese platter of capriago, caprino di riforano, and the cuise sotto foglie di tabaco. I wasn't wowed by any of these unfortunately.  We topped off the night with the Hazelnut Budino which really saved the night. Honestly, if I came back here I wouldn't even bother with the actual food, just the budino! \n\nWhat really turned me off from this place was the service. It was slow and unattentive. What was even worse was the annoying couple sitting next to us who were making fun of one of the other guests - to top it off, they started talking to our waitress about the guest and to my shock, she joined in on the discussion! I found this to be appalling and very unprofessional at any restaurant, let alone one that's attempting to be \"upscale\".\n\nBottom line, Perbacco left a bitter taste in my mouth, quite the opposite of the expression of pleasure and surprise, as their namesake alludes one will feel after dining here. My advice, if you want good italian in SF, travel to north beach, and if you want a romantic, upscale meal in SF, try a Michelin, - do yourself a favor and leave out Perbacco.", "author": "H T."}

We ordered a bottle of the Peter Paul pinot noir as I perused through the difficult-to-pronounce menu items. \n\nI decided on the Tajarin, not knowing what it was, but the phrases\" 5-hour\" and \"pork\" together sounded delicious. What arrived before we could finish our first glass of wine was a beautiful dish of long, stringy pasta (similar looking to ramen if I may be so bold) with a neat covering of thick pork ragu sauce. \n\nIf you're a foodie (and I don't claim I am), the first bite tells all. To me, if it makes my eyes close as I savor the flavors in my mouth, this place is getting at least 3 stars. As it turned out, the Tajarin pasta was cooked perfectly - a bit al dente to make it springy and pleasantly chewy. The thick, melt-in-your-mouth pork ragu sauce added a most excellent compliment to the pasta. I had to exercise diligent self-control as to not hork down the plate of pasta and lick the plate, as I was on a date of sorts.\n\nThough a bit on the pricey side (one plate of pasta, a bottle of wine, and dessert) came out to a little over $100, it's definitely worth your splurge fund when you feel like you deserve a heart-warming pasta treat.", "author": "Jason L."}

Our waiter was gracious, professional yet warm.\n\nI have no problem with the quality and taste of the food. While they were not exceptional, they were fine. However, I thought the display of the food, or the plating, was quite shameful. I usually don't care about it that much, but you are in a fancy, expensive restaurant, you pay a lot more than you usually do, it's reasonable to expect more.\n\nAfter we settled down and ordered, I glanced at the table next to ours. The gentleman at the table was having a pasta dish, it was a plate of spaghetti with some sort of meat sauce. If you just looked at the dish, you'd think you were in Denny's, or one of those undistinguished diners. There's no such thing as plating, none whatsoever, just spaghetti with meat sauce heaped up on the plate as if I would serve at home after a hectic day and I whipped up a quick meal. \n\nOur main dishes came. We both ordered pasta tasting courses, for which you got to try 2 different pasta dishes. Our plates were off white color, rectangular shaped. On the plates, sat 2 small pools of pasta in their sauces. I remember, in other restaurants, even the less fancy ones, usually they do something with the plate, some oil dripping on the side, some sprinkled parsley, just so the plate looked pretty, appetizing and professional, you'd feel that the chef was having fun. Not in our case. Our dishes looked very hurried,  mindlessly put together just to get them done and over with, it somehow reminded me of assembly line. Honestly my home cooking looks better than this.\n\nThen came the dessert Panna Cotta.  It sat off the center of a huge plate, almost tilting to the side, there were quite a lot of blank space because the plate was too big, that made the dessert looked sad and lonely. And the scarcely drizzled  raspberry sauce looked more like an afterthought, and not nearly enough to accompany the panna cotta. Remember those fanciful dessert plates? There are sprinkled powder sugar, splash of bright colored sauce, artistically arranged chocolate or cookie bits, mint leaves, I used to think it's show off, now I miss them. At least they are fun to look at.\n\nI admit, I usually don't give much thoughts to how food is presented, or, at times, I think some of the decorating of the dishes are excessive and showy, but it is nice to look at, like a piece of visual art. The pleasure of fine dining isn't just about taste, it involves flavor, texture, color, arrangement. I would be willing to overlook all these, if the food was exceptional. But in this case, it was not.", "author": "Echo C."}

Now something cool about the pasta menu: for you entree, you can order 2 or 3 kind of pasta that you'll share with your dining companion. I really like that option - this allows to sample more dishes and still have room for dessert. The agnolotti dal plin (kind of ravioli) filled with roasted veal and the pappardelle with slow cooked short rib ragu were terrific. We ordered the caramel ice cream for dessert, not bad, but I thought the pine nut and almond cookies that came with it stole the show (very fresh but chewy with an unusual combination of nuts). \nThe service was good too, we got some really good wine recommendations from our waiter.

Nothing against the restaurant or the food but it just wasn't my kind of food or my kind of atmosphere. What I liked I loved, but to describe what I disliked would require this analogy: To those who hate brussel sprouts, no matter how you cook it, you're not gonna like it. That was how I felt about the dishes I disliked. \n\nI apologize that the rest of my review of the dishes don't include names; I had a hard time reading the menu as there were so many things I didn't understand on the menu in one line. For those of you who don't come to these type of restaurants often or if you dont' have culinary experience, heed this warning: you will have a hard time reading the menu too. Words like passatina and passato frequent the menu often and I still don't know what they mean. I felt like I needed a dictionary or an italian-english translator to decipher the menu. Just what are they trying to prove -.- Anyways...\n\nFood: We shared appetizers and pasta dishes and there were dishes that stuck out to me. First was this plate of fried food. It had string beans and what I thought was calamari but my boyfriend's dad said it was fried shrimp. It had the right texture and a great taste. \n\nSecond were these pasta noodles with short rib ragu. The noodles honestly tasted like soupless ramen noodles but the lamb ragu had a great strong flavor. \n\nThird was the gnocchi. It was the first time i've had gnocchi so I\"m not sure how they are supposed to taste but it wasn't my cup of tea. It had a mushy texture and a forgettable taste. Anyone want to tell me if gnocchi is supposed to be mushy?\n\nFourth was the main entree I ordered. Duck breast whatever. It was really juicy but the taste was also forgettable.\n\nFifth was the hazelnut cookies. Again weird texture. Half the table liked it and half the table didn't. I wasn't that big of a fan. It was as chewy as nougat is which I think is kind of weird for a cookie.\n\nSixth was the chocolate mousse which I thought was the best part of the night. The chocolate wasn't overly sweet, it was actually pretty perfect for me. Satisfied my sweet tooth but didn't make me reach for the water cup. \n\nSeventh were the breadsticks. It's actually the first time i've ever had those thin hard crunchy breadsticks, like you see in italian restaurants on television all the time. I thought the flavor was great and it was even better when you dipped it in the sauce. \n\nService: GREAT. We were seated promptly at our reservation time. We were asked if we wanted to hang our coats up in the closet. The waiter was very knowledgeable and was able to give me recommendations for drinks and for the main entree. Our waters were constantly refilled and when we got up to go to the bathroom, our napkins were refolded for us. \n\nUnfortunately, I've had great service and great food at other restaurants so Meh is as good as this review is going to get. \n\nI would give this restaurant another try because supposedly they have a different menu daily so maybe different dishes will prompt me to give a better review.

It made me want to buy my own container of sea salt so that I could sprinkle it onto my ice cream at home.\n\nService was of course, superb. We couldn't finish our main courses since we ordered so many appetizers, but they were not offended at all to have to pack our food up for us. My green spirally pasta still tasted great the next day!", "author": "Melody L."}

The Barbacco a couple of doors away threw me for a moment, thinking I had written the wrong name down, but we figured out our mistake and went where we were supposed to go. Perbacco has a cool vibe as you walk in. The bar has a brick wall behind it and it is pretty dramatic. We walked past the bar and into the dining room. It is open and spacious. You can see the kitchen in the back of the room. We started with a delicious appetizer, then moved into a gnocchi dish along with the sea bass. Oh, my god!!! SO good!!! They have a thorough wine selection. The bottle we wanted was unavailable, but our lovely waitress, Jaime, brought us a similar one that we enjoyed. Our dessert, the ugly cookies, was a great way to end our meal. Not too heavy. It was my birthday, and they had written Happy Birthday on our dessert plate. Classy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-12-06", "description": "My never-ending quest to find an Italian restaurant comparable to Delfina finally led me to the entrance of Perbacco (read: a very nice gentleman finally offered to take me there) - one of Bauer's 100 best of the bay, and generally known to have a reputation for delicious, sophisticated Italian in the City. Equipped with 7x7's \"Big Eat SF\" list (not to mention an appetite big enough to eat the world), and having researched their signature dishes, I was ready to tackle Perbacco head-on. \n\nI'm not going to lie, I definitely went into the night with certain expectations of how everything should play out. And, in terms of atmosphere, those expectations were filled as soon as I walked in the door. The lively, modern, refined atmosphere instantly appealed to my \"city chic\" preferences. And, the open kitchen not only let me catch a glimpse of what was going on behind the scenes, but let me flirt with the chefs (with my eyes of course!) on my way down to the restrooms. Unfortunately, I don't think they noticed...\n\nThe service was on point as well - there when we needed it, helpful in answering our numerous questions, friendly, even complete with a sommelier to help us find our way through their extensive list. No complaints.\n\nBut, as I always say in these reviews, my bottom line is the food, and unfortunately the word that comes to mind when I think of Perbacco's menu is \"inconsistent.\"  I feel that one of the pitfalls of offering such an extensive menu is that some dishes are simply not going to be at the same level as others. Such was the case at Perbacco; while their specialties certainly deserved their rave reviews, the rest of our meal left me wanting more. \n\n**Exception: the bread sticks were buttery, perfectly crispy, and downright dangerous. Be warned that they serve bread sticks AND bread, so it's easy to fill up before the main course has even arrived!\n\nAs for appetizers, the SALUMI MISTI offered a variety of meat selections in sizable portions, however, it wasn't mind-blowing. Let's not kid ourselves here - it's sliced meat on a plate. Sure it's delicious, but it doesn't take a premier restaurant to serve it (and, I'm a bit spoiled by having Lucca down the street from my house). And, while the VEAL TRIPE was perfectly cooked, the composition of the dish was a bit uninspired and lacked seasoning. \n\nSince, as I said, I was ready to eat the world, we tackled 3 pastas - the AGNOLOTTI DAL PLIN, the TAJARIN, and the RABATON. There was nothing especially memorable about the latter 2 - both were executed well, but I wasn't impressed by the flavors. When I eat ricotta gnocchi, I want to think I'm eating a cloud, and the Rabaton fell short of cloudliness. However, the Agnolotti (a dish they are known for) was everything I could've wanted and more. As soon as we dove into that dish, our lively conversation came to a dead silence - there was no room for words in the face of that rich, complex flavor. This was one of the top 5 pasta dishes I've had in the City, and if I was ever to go back, would be the only thing I'd need to order to feel completely satisfied. \n\nWith so many choices on the menu, I'm sure everyone can find something that makes their heart sing. However, for me, I want any and every selection I make to inspire me to jump on a table and start declaring my enduring love (don't worry, it's only happened 2-3 times). While my overall experience was solid, my quest to find sensational Italian food in San Francisco must continue.", "author": "Kelsey E."}

Rounding out to one of the best lunches I've ever had, my experience consisted of 3 appetizers, a pasta main dish, and cafe latte.  \n\nLocated conveniently 5 minutes away from my work, Perbacco surpassed my really high expectations.  With classy, yet modern decor inside, and hip, knowledgeable, yet, not pretentious wait staff, I can see this being one of my favorite Italian spots to go to.\n\nStarting off with a slow roasted veal carpaccio in a lemon/tuna sauce, I was impressed right off the bat.  Not being a huge fan of veal or capers in general, I was pleasantly surprised by how tender and flavorful (without the typical vealish gamey taste) this dish was and how well it went with the sauce.\n\nFried rock shrimp was the next order of business, where there wasn't too much batter, or too little shrimp with each bite.  This also came in a lemon sauce (aioli) as well as some other fried bits.  Definitely couldn't complain about this dish.\n\nThe seared squid on a bed of arugula was the last appetizer that was demolished.  I especially enjoyed how the arugula nor the salted squid overpowered the other.  There was a very delicate balance in this dish that made it juuuuuuust right.\n\nFor my main, I had the langaroli with braised short rib.  This was a decision I had my server make for me when deciding between this, the tagliatelle and the parpadelle (all of which I'm convinced are amazing).  She mentioned that it was new on the menu and that it was a good choice, so I went with it.  In the end, who can really complain about pasta filled with braised short rib.  There were some bites that may have bordered on being too salty, but the succulence of the short rib brought it all back.  Of course, the pasta (smaller ravioli like) was perfectly al dente, and the portion was just right....assuming there is a correct portion after eating 3 appetizers.\n\nTo top it off, I had to deny the creme fraiche panna cotta and settle for a latte, as I still needed to be functional at work.  And, to one up themselves again, the latte came with extra foam and milk if we desired.  WHO DOES THIS?!\n\nPerbacco, you've earned a special place in my stomach.", "author": "Jeff N."}

We decided to have a dinner date on a Wednesday before I headed to my 6:30pm class and I chose this place for its proximity to the BART station. We planned to meet at 5; I arrived at 4:45pm. I was told by the hostess that they did not start dinner seating until 5:30. The hostess politely inquired if I were looking for Barbacco, which, for its convincingly similar name, must be a frequent source of mix-ups. I was not; and decided to grab a bar table in the corner near the front window to wait for my bf to arrive. It was pretty empty around 5pm but I am glad I snagged that table when I did, because the FiDi after-work crowd filtered in soon after. The bf arrived at 5:15; by 5:30, the entire bar area was crowded to the point of an almost-uncomfortable capacity. \n\nWe asked for menus so that we could choose our main dishes and put in our orders so that we could start our dinners as soon as possible. The menus for the night had not even finished printing yet, but our waitress was kind enough to bring them over as soon as they were ready, around 5:25. We ordered our mains and decided to start with the salumi plate. The salumi plate was all that it is hyped up to be in these reviews and more - the fatty selections were incredibly flavorful and decadent. \n\nI had the duck breast and the bf had the rabbit. These were both presented on our plates in two distinct preparations, which was refreshing as not only did it showcase the chef's abilities, but also we were able to experience our duck and rabbit in more than one way each. This was a refreshing take, as it was more interesting to my palate to be able to taste my duck in different textures and tastes that were overall complementary to each other. \n\nThe wine list is extensive and solid. I was pleased to discover a sizeable selection of rieslings. I had a very good $12 glass of riesling, but the name of it escapes me. My bf had a bottled anchor steam. Perbacco does not have any beers on tap, unfortunately. \n\nOur impromptu dinner date meal cost us about $90 before tip. Definitely not a place to frequent on a regular basis, but definitely nice for an after-work pick-me-up or a celebration once in awhile.\n\nPros:\n-Very solid and satisfying Italian main dishes \n-Beyond decadent salumi plate\n-Extensive wine list\n-Helpful and attentive waitress (despite the unyielding crowd)\n-Proximity to Embarcadero BART\n\nCons:\n-Very, very loud - the acoustics in the restaurant are not suited for comfortable across-the-table talking (not suitable for a first date, for sure!)\n-The elbowing FiDi after-work crowd \n-Not being able to get dinner seating until 5:30 (I would appreciate being able to sit by 5pm for dinner)", "author": "Megan L."}

Worked well here... Had my spot right away despite a long wait for tables. 10 mins later and I have my first glass of Pinot blanc and asparagus and radish salad. Simple and delish.\n\nI wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a pasta for my main course. I will not try to pronounce the name of this little gem. It was smallish raviolis with braised short ribs, topped with brown butter sauce and shaved horseradish.

I love the literal meaning of Perbacco, which is an Italian word to accentuate positive comments :)\n\nI enjoyed the ambiance of Perbacco.  We found two seats at the bar right when we walked in and everything on everyone else's plates looked delightful, tasty, and delicious.  I told the bartender we didn't even need to look at a menu since we were in a hurry and knew exactly what we were getting, but I definitely went straight home that evening and took a look at it.  The salumi plate was pretty good. Lots of fatty looking meats that tasted wonderful.  There was one item in a small ramekin in the middle, which I do not recommend; it looked like and reminded me of the food we used to feed my cat back in the day.  It was even a special kind of cat food since she was always sick. \n\nI would love to come back for dinner one night to try out all the amazing looking pasta dishes, pork rib, duck, or the meat plate.

We started off with the cured meats and root vegetable appetizers and I would have to actually pick the vegetables over the cured meats. The cured meats i think needed a bit more flavor to it, but the vegetables had a nice pickling taste to it that was very good! I ordered the duck breast and that was very tender and flavorful. It came with brussell sprouts, which I am not a fan of, but these were so tasty. Usually they get a bad rap for a reason, but if you decide to get the duck here, the brussell sprouts were pretty freaking awesome lol. I had a taste of the pork shoulder and all I can say is WOW.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-03", "description": "Dining at Perbacco was in the pipeline since Piccolina P.  highly recommended it to me only a couple of weeks ago. What most interested me in this establishment is that they serve typical dishes from Piemonte  (my home region in Italy) but with a Californian touch.  Pointless to say that I had great expectations (and some fears too).\n\nAs a great start, we got homemade grissini with a typical flavourful parsley-based green dip (Bagna Verde) that Piemontesi normally use as sauce for veal tongue or boiled veal meat.\n\nThe menu itself is rather interesting: I particularly like the possibility of combining two or three different pasta dishes (I wish more Italian restaurants offered such a possibility, since I often have hard times in deciding which promising homemade pasta to pick).  No chance I could have missed this heavenly possibility. After a good looking and flavourful appetizer with raw yellowtail, shaved porcini and celery, our main choice fell upon the following pasta trio:\n\n1- herb Maltagliati with lamb ragu', peas, ricotta di pecora and mint: excellent pasta, overkilling sauce with too much on it. I honestly find ricotta and lamb (despite its nicely melting-in-mouth texture, by the way) a rather weird combination, but I liked the mint (exactly the opposite as my gf ...);\n\n2-agnolotti al coniglio with vermouth based sauce and fruit mustard:\nthose agnolotti were a real pasta masterpiece and the sauce was original, even though the reduction didn't fully kill the alcoholic taste. Forgivable sin, though, that didn't affect too much the marvellous resulting dish.\n\n 3- tajarin (typical Piedmontese taglierini) with 5 hour pork sugo and porcini: if you wonder  why letting the sugo cook for 5 hours, this dish gives you a convincing answer. What a fantastic taste! Again, another delicious pasta.\n\nDesserts were good (but not exceptional) and they came in huge portions:  \n1- buttermilk panna cotta with a lemonish taste, raspberries and a touch of fruity granita;\n2- ricotta mousse, a lemonish cake (I can't recall the name) and Lambrusco marinated strawberries. \n\nGood wines and beers (I got a Piedmontese Menabrea) too.\n\nPerbacco offers a seriously good deal considering both quality and quantity (the real surprise, in my opinion) for the price you pay.  Thanks Piccolina P.: this place really deserves a visit (or two or three ...).  \n\nPasta lovers, here you can find \"pane per i vostri denti\" (literally: \"bread for your teeth\").\n\n4.5 stars.", "author": "Andrea L."}

Their breadsticks were also extremely light and delicious.\n\nI loved the veal carpaccio, although I'm glad there were 4 of us 'cause I think it was a bit on the oily side and I might not have liked it as much if I had to eat too much of it.\n\nIf you like fish/seafood, their octopus is pretty good, but not my favorite.  Their hamachi crudo is amazing.  The fish just melts in your mouth and it's like every tastebud is coated with flavor.\n\nTheir veal was a great entr\u00e9e and could not have been cooked more perfectly.  Their duck was also very good, but not as memorable.\n\nThe scallops -- god the scallops -- were just great.  Nice sear on the outside and soft and tasty in the middle.

Great menu selection, even a special menu for some truffle event. \n\nAtmosphere/Location: \nExcellent seating areas, great looking bar. Too many people standing around the entrance made it difficult to walk through. \nService:\nOur server was good although missing at times. When we initially sat down we had some questions on the menu, but she as busy provided good service to other tables, so when itwas our turn, we got her undivided attention.  Our food came out promptly.\nFood:\nEveryone gushed about how delicious their plates were, from the earthy delicious truffle ricotta gnocchi, the did i realy just eat tongue and feet massacrin plate, to the seasonally popularbutternut squash ravioli. I had th papperdelle with a short rib ragout and a side of the beans.  I loved the beans... spicy kick, just enough bacon to give the dish an edge.  I was not a fan of the paperdelle dish.  It was missing something.  There was a bit too much freshly grated horserdish, and not a sweet element to counterbalance. The flavor scale was sharply on the bitter side... perhaps some broccoli or another kind of vegetable would have calmed it down.  The pasta and short ribs were delicious, it's just too bad that the horseradish overpowered the entire dish.\nWe all had dessert. Everyone loved what they ordered, but the olive oil chcolate cake and apple tart stood out.\nDrinks:\nGreat wine list, but be ready to break the bank.  The cheapest option for CabSauv was 49. They had some goodies ont he list too, such as an Opus One. I stayed in the mixed drinks section and enjoyed a cucmber lemon concoction as was overpowered by excessive mint use on the mojito.\n\nAll in all, 4 stars.

My first impression was how large the actual restaurant is.  Bountiful seating in the back and a 2nd level lending a wedding banquet worthy space.  \n\nThe service from the host to each server was very gracious.  Our party of 3 came on a Friday evening as walk-ins and were immediately seated.  As I said, this place is so vast that it's hard to truly fill up the entire restaurant.  \n\nHere are some memorable favorites from what we ordered:\n\nThe Charcuterie plate - \nThe Salumi Misti had its hits and misses.  Some outstanding meats with spicy, oily flavors.  And there was a pork sausage that tasted like pork tartare of sorts... basically globules of fat, which I couldn't quite handle.  Perhaps a few crostinis could have helped with the texture.  There was another sausage that tasted like the best corned beef hash to me.  \n\nTagliatelle with Pork Sugo and Porcini Mushrooms - A knock out.  I loved this sort of pasta... the texture is that of the ramen you find in a Cup O Noodle, but more rough.  That may sound like an insult, but I am just describing the texture.  It had a great bite to it... as if you had wanted to nibble on each and every strand.  The taste is simply eggy.  Now mix that in with silky broken down pork sugo, it was a fine complete dish for me.  Porcini mushrooms just melded all together with a rich earthy sauce.\n\nI enjoyed the service who checked in on us at the right amounts.  The high points were high, but in general no real low points.  Just food that weren't made for my tastes.", "author": "Chris T."}

There are very few selections under $70, which is interesting because wine does not need to be $100 or more a bottle to be enjoyable. However the $65/bottle my boyfriend and I shared was definitely nice. \n\nI am Italian and was disappointed with the food...the sauces on the pasta and raviolis tasted kind of funky, but the noodles were cooked correctly. The salami platter was delicious, but expensive! To share a starter, get one of the cheapest bottles of wine, and an entree each (with no dessert) was about $160. \n\nThe service here is really good! The servers were very nice and attentive, including the hostess who did not have our reservation made through open table, but happily found a table for us no problem. Thanks! I host as well and I know its not always easy.\n\nAnother disappointing aspect was the woman who opened our wine for us did not even open it at the table. We were shown the bottle, then the bottle was taken out of sight, and returned to us opened. I myself open wine at a nice restaurant and I value the presentation, especially if the wine is costly. \n\nValet were very nice as well and would literally run to retrieve cars for guests, that effort is very much appreciated, especially on a cold night in the city.", "author": "Alyssa B."}

The atmosphere definitely felt power-lunchy, which is appropriate for FiDi. \n\nWe started with the pan-seared octopus, then had the pappardelle with short ribs, then ended with the salted caramel gelato.  I was afraid I wouldn't like the octopus, but it was actually really delicious. It was not too fishy and the olives were a perfect compliment to the octopus flavor.

The salted caramel gelato was admittedly not as good as bi-rite, but still a good end to the meal. The cookies that came with the ice cream were also really good. \n\nIn total, the meal was around $100; which is admittedly on the expensive side for lunch.

I would have given it a 5-star if it wasn't that the dishes are a little too heavy. Don't get me wrong: I love Italian food and I know gnocchi, pasta, risotto aren't light, but I think here it is particularly heavy maybe due to too much butter or cream in the recipes... possibly combined with the fact that they serve a delicious slice of focaccia, drenched in olive oil, which pretty much fills you up before you even get your meal. Each dish is unique and full of flavor, but very rich. \n\nI never heard of anybody not liking their food at Perbacco, but everybody always feels very bloated when leaving. Some people love this, others don't and would prefer a more balanced menu. Thus, I can only give it a 4 star. \n\nPS: I would recommend the agnolotti with rabbit, and most of the pasta or gnocchi dishes, but today I had the Risotto with Figs, Prosciutto and Burrata and, while the first bite was amazing, by the second bite I was overwhelmed with too much sweetness and too much richness....

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-15", "description": "Checking in at the end of our evening dining at this Italian restaurant in the Financial District I yelped, \"OMFG! Perfect service, perfect meals to share, and perfect company to enjoy this A+ dining experience!\"  I'd be hard pressed to recall a better evening of dining out than what I experienced last night, which was a tie with Zuni Cafe back in the spring so I guess my two favorite restaurants just now happen to be in San Francisco.\n\nWorking out here in the Bay Area as frequently as I have been of late I seem to go through fits and starts.  Some trips I'm all about going back to the places I've tried and liked, but some trips are like the last two weeks when every new experience seems to unfold some hidden gem that I'm just discovering for the first time.  Writing this just now I can't gush enough about how much I love this city so forgive me if you detect more than a whiff of hyperbole.\n\nMeeting up with a former work colleague whom I've not seen in about six years and her beau, it was on me to choose the restaurant since she'd only moved to town (from New York City) just two weeks ago.  Needless to say she wanted something on par with what she'd grown accustomed to in New York.  While I thought I was making a reservation at BARBacco where I'd dined a few months back, I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at PERBacco and realized my mistake and that I would be dining at the more established big sister restaurant.\n\nFirst the service: I wish I'd gotten my waiter's name so I could rave about him personally.  As happened at Zuni Cafe, he let us take our time as we were so busy talking we'd barely perused the menu after ordering a couple of drinks.  Since we were all three newcomers he took great pride in explaining the menu and insisting that everything on the menu is special when one of us asked if there were any specials.  Indeed he was right as every dish on the menu had allure, especially the homemade pastas and house cured charcuterie.  When we noticed that we could order two or three pastas to share for the table, he recommended we get two salads to start, two pastas, and two entrees.  \n\nWe had no trouble choosing the two salads, one was roasted beets on a testa (head cheese?) remoulade and the other roasted figs with burrata, arugula and a balsamic glaze. The pastas all looked great and I might have wanted a filled ravioli or gnocchi but we had the papardelle with beef ribs and the the molto Italiano strand pasta with pesto and crushed cherry tomatoes.  Given that all of the pastas are made on the premises I'm sure there was no going wrong. And rather than serving the the dish family style, we were each given a plate with a portion of each.  The papardelle was certainly my favorite and I guess I had a taste for beef that night because we also ordered the beef rib straccato.  No one is a bigger fan of red meat braised in wine than yours truly.  I love making it at home and I love eating it when I go out.  This version came not just with a bread crumb crust but a bone marrow bread crumb crust.  Perfecto!\n\nFor the second entree we were to share, our waiter pulled a delightful trick I've never experienced at another restaurant before.  Since we couldn't decide among the salmon, the duck or the rabbit, he said let me surprise you. We were all somewhat taken aback by the proposition, but of course he promised that they were each excellent.  That we went along with his suggestion is testament to his overall competence as a waiter and how deftly he orchestrated a gratifying experience.  And of course he chose a bottle of Italian red close to the flavor profile of our consensus wine of pinot noir that would have gone with any of the three but again seemed extra special because he chose it for us.  I'm not sure how he came to decide on the duck for us, but I couldn't have been more pleased even though I was hoping for the rabbit.  What was especially delicious was the the accompaniment of roasted apples and brussel sprouts that made for such a succulent complement to the duck.\n\nIt's rare that service and meal are so perfectly combined in one evening.  Part of the magic was of course catching up with an old friend in a setting new to both of us. But our waiter took the pulse of our table and just made sure we'd have a wonderful evening.  I only wish I could give more than 5 stars for this spectacular night!", "author": "Sean M."}

I would not normally consider it as a place where you'd have a casual dinner date with your sisters and your new baby niece...\n\nMy sisters, one of whom had a baby very recently, and I wanted to get together for a nice dinner.  We chose Perbacco because the menu was scrumptious!  What we hadn't realized was that Perbacco is a really nice restaurant with fancy, well-heeled patrons, and beautiful decor.  I felt a little embarassed trying to fit my 3.5-month old niece at our table, because the high chair wouldn't work with her car-seat, but the host and the servers were really accomodating and we managed to make the baby comfortable in a regular chair.\n\nNot a single person stared at us in horror, which was really surprising, even when my sister started to breastfeed!

How much more reasonable can you get?!?\n\nEverything we had was simply delicious, and I would order it all again, though I'll likely venture to other items on the menu because there are so many!  The burrata cheese app was especially noteworthy, as it just melts in your mouth.  I also love how our server automatically separated the pasta onto three dishes so we didn't have to divvy up the portions ourselves.  I really would consider this a fabulous value for your money, as we all left stuffed and incredibly happy.\n\nI am absolutely returning to Perbacco when I'm feeling in the mood for a beautiful sit-down dinner with excellent service and delectable food.", "author": "Kira K."}

Definitely the dessert to get!  \n\nSolid:\n- Seared Local Sea Bass: Was a little firmer than expected, but the combination of corn with some sort of a lemon-y sauce and asparagus was well done.\n- Goat cheese and mint ravioli: this was interesting.  Both the mint and goat cheese are subtle, so it actual tastes better than it sounds.\n- Fig-leaf scented panna cotta: Was decent as far as panna cotta goes.  Hard to appreciate it after tasting the mousse (see above).\n\nOther: Pappardelle, Prather Ranch Sirloin Steak, Roasted Octopus were all supposedly decent.

I can now rest easy with the knowledge that, according to 7x7 magazine, I only need to try 94 more dishes before laying claims to a life fully lived. \n\nThe decor is modern and somewhat understated, although the tables are a little too close together, and I definitely felt like the diners either side of us were privy to a little too much information. The wait staff were very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu - which was absolutely ENORMOUS. Our waitress gave a great wine recommendation (Perbacco has a HUGE selection of Italian wines)  and weighed in on their many popular entrees and appetizers.\n\nI, however, ignored most of those recommendations and decided to go freestyle. We started with the salumi plate, obviously, which was pretty incredible. Perbacco hand-makes all of their cured meats, and I've honestly never tried anything like some of the pates and sausages that emerged with our plate. Top marks, and if I'd been smart about things, I would have left it at that.\n\nMy appetizer was a watermelon salad with basic and queso fresco - which was tasy, but by no means extraordinary. I was HUGELY disappointed by my appetizer of home-made gnocchi with Early Girl tomatoes and cheese - the potato was incredibly dense and the tomatoes seemed a little too sweet and lacking in flavor - enormous bummer, because simple gnocchi/tomato dishes are my absolute fave. I left all but a bite on my plate. Donny S. was similarly underwhelmed by his pork dish cooked in milk - a dish the waitress had recommended.\n\nWe finished by sharing the olive oil chocolate cake - which was tasy, but not as 'push-the-envelope' as it sounds. The cake was a gooey fudgy sponge-type thing, and the ice cream was basically vanilla flavored with a little hint of olive oil. I think had it just been \"chocolate cake with ice cream\" I wouldn't really have noticed the olive oil.\n\nSo three stars - for the decor, service, and salumi. I'd probably come back here for a drink and an appetizer, but save my dinner money and take myself somewhere a little tastier.", "author": "Amanda F."}

It is however a nice place for special occasions I suppose, maybe a birthday or an anniversary?  Here's what we ordered:\n\nHamachi: I'd give it a 3.5/5 being that I've never eaten hamachi, which is wierd because I always eat sushi? but whatever.  It was basically 3 pieces roughly 3 inches long, 1.5 inches wide, and each piece was approx. about 1/2 inch in thickness.  It had some red sauce under the pieces of hamachi along with some fresh dill & something that resembled celery?  Not sure, but you can look at the menu and find out, i'm just a big lazy right now.  A bit of rock salt on each piece gave it just the right amount to taste.  I liked it with the dill and celery, i think, together.  If not eaten together with the dill and celery it just tasted a bit too fishy to my liking.  But all in all a good choice, I'd probably order it again if i ever go back.\n\nSalumi Misti: This dish gets a 2.5/5 because I'm not a salami expert.  Here we've got different selections of salami with a few uber tiny pickles & onions soaked in vinegar with some garlic pesto sauce, i think, along with a few slices of dried toast cracker like thingy's and some breadsticks.  I'd say i'm not a conoseuir when it comes to various types of salami, but it was pretty good.  I hear that this is a special thing that people rave about when they come here because the salami is cured in house or something?  Not being a salami fanatic, I will probably not order this again.  Guess I would've ordered it eventually since I hadn't tried it for myself.  It has a bit of a sourish taste but I guess that's a good thing? right?\n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad:  Man, this one gets a 3.8/5!  The slices of tomatoes were fairly big.  Topped with vinegar, balsamic vinegar, garlic, basil, fresh parm, and probably a whole bunch of high qual ingredients.  Very light, tasty and smells wonderful too...although it doesn't really have a strong smell.  I love basil and vinegar.\n\nPappardelle: This dish definately gets a 4/5.  It's basically gravy made from pork ribs with pork ribs on flat & wide linguine with no bones!  I personally never order ribs or anything with a bone, which sucks cuz  I love pork ribs!  The meat is so tender and you can really taste the essence of whatever they're trying to portray.  Awesome awesome dish.  I'd like to try and make this at home, but it'd be alot of work.  O well, if i go back I will definately order this.  It is a must have for people who like pork, ribs or both!\n\nHerb Ricotta Gnocchi: It was good, so I guess I'll give it a 3/5.  If you like ricotta or cheese or milk or cheese or the smell of cheese, then this dish is for you!  I think it was very well put together with the basil, spinach, and especially the cherry tomatoes.  I think they could've put a little more flavor in it, like maybe some meat or something, but that's ok.  It was still pretty good.  But I probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nSorbet:  Unfortunately, I dont remember which sorbet was ordered, but it was definately good.  This i'd give a 4/5.  I usually dont like sorbet's but this is definately the exception.  It comes in a ceramic glass shaped like a bent plastic cup for easy holding.  Unique Idea, definately innovative.  Also comes with 2 uber small shortbread cookies with raisin which were DELECTEBLE.  Yummm.\n\nPine Nut Panna Cotta w/ Blueberries:  It is a pretty dish as well a tasty one.  However, I'm a panna cotta freak so I'd hafto give this a 3/5.  If this was my first time eating panna cotta I'd definately give it a higher rating, but since I've eaten it at other places and even make it at home, I can't give it anything higher than a 3/5.  This must've been the only dish beside the sortbet I didn't get a picture of..o well.  It came on a huge white round plate with blueberries in a blueberry sauce artistically splattered around the plate with chopped pine nuts lightly spread out on top and the panna cotta being in the middle of the plate.  Again, awesome dish, awesome layout, even though I've had better, I'd still order it again.\n\nAll in all, I can't say I'll never go back, but I will not be craving to go back like I would to Katana-ya for ramen, but that's a whole other issue.  lol, that's not even italian food but whatever.  I must definately be a japanese addict.  Anyway, the ambience and atmosphere of the place definately was nice for this special occasion, except for the noise level, but that couldn't be helped being it was 6 pm on a friday night.  Definately worth trying.  I also left a fatty tip because our server was so friendly.  I dont wanna type about this place anymore cuz I hafto goto the bathroom so I'm going to leave you with this note:\n\nI've got to take a poop.\n\nuntil next time....EAT MORE FOOD!!\n\nand oh yea, it looks like they have a dressy standard for attire, but I went in jeans and a polo.

Weird leaves, nothing exceptional about the dressing, overall bitter aftertaste.\n\nWe then split a slightly overcooked risotto, it had a decent flavor but not anything remarkable.

I met an old friend there, he treated me to lunch for my birthday. It was an idyllic 2 hours. The grissini were fresh and crisp -- didn't try the other bread. We shared appetizers:  Vitello Tonnato and Antipasti Misti. Both were very good. It was the one and only time I've ever had Vitello Tonnato outside Italy or my own home and it was very good. The vitello was sliced like prosciutto, which was unusual, but it  did taste delicious. Our entrees were the hangar steak (with Vidalia onions!) and the roast chicken served on a bed of polenta. I ordered the latter as I was craving decent polenta and it did not disappoint. My friend graciously shared some of those eXquisite onions and a bite of hangar steak and I'll go with this entree next time if it's availabe. We topped off the meal with a delicious chocolate delicacy that had a hint of espresso. I can't recall the name of this concoction, it was like a creme brulee or a heavy mousse, and it was absolutely divine. \n\nI'd have scored Perbacco a perfect 5 if it weren't for the uneven service. We shared a half-carafe of Sangiovese, which I'll never order again. Highly acidic, it wasn't so much the quality of the wine as it was the server who made me regret our choice. I gather he disapproved of our selection as he spilled  quite a bit of it when he poured my friend's glass. Ok. Maybe it was an accident.   My friend poured the remaining glasses himself, rather than tempt fate by having our server  . . .   pour more. That was fine until the very end of the meal when, after expertly scraping grissini crumbs from the white linen tablecloth, he picked up my glass and turned it upside down right next to my friend's elbow. There was a trail of red wine dribble almost touching my friend's sleeve.  They traded glances and then . . . He does it AGAIN! with my friend's glass. We just stared at the two little red rivulets and then my friend asked, \"What's going on with this guy? Is he mad at me? He did that on purpose, didn't  he?\". I had to admit that it certainly looked lthat way. Three splash-downs, and all on *his* side of  the table. We'll definitely make sure we have a different server next time. \n\nBut even with that dodgy waiter, the food made our meal a wonderful reunion.", "author": "Lucia M."}

Two years ago, I had a wonderful dinner at Perbacco - the service was phenomenal, the ambience earthy yet contemporary, and the roasted duck divine.  For two years I have been trying to get back to Perbacco, and finally had my chance last night.\n\nThe service was still excellent, however, I found the food to be seriously lacking in flavor.  The arugula and pear salad was drizzled very lightly with a rich gorgonzola sauce (I would have preferred a little more), and it seemed like there was all of two tablespoons of arugula on the plate.  The roasted pears were so-so; for such a savory salad, they would have done better to caramelize the crust on the pears a bit more.  With so little salad on the plate, it becomes almost essential for every morsel to literally burst with flavor, and this salad did not.\n\nI also ordered the sea bass in a saffron broth.  I could not taste the saffron at all.  But the biggest disappointment - I did not recognize the fish as a sea bass.  I had imagined a thick, moist slab of meaty fish, but the sea bass had the texture of a mahi mahi,  It was served with the skin, but the skin was neither flavored nor crisp, so I could not understand its purpose on the plate.  The entree came with fingerling potatoes.  Again, I had imagined roasted buttery little nuggets, but these were sliced thin and boiled in the broth.  I was completely underwhelmed.\n\nMy husband had the lamb, which I thought had some good flavor.  But the medallions were so small - after excluding the bone, there was all of three bitefuls in each of the two medallions.  And at nearly $30 for the entree plate itself, I think the restaurant could have done a little better than that.  There was a glimmer of hope - one of our dining companions had the beef shortrib, which seemed to have been perfectly cooked; he did not even need his knife to slice it.\n\nWe had a flourless chocolate torte and chestnut/honey ice cream for dessert.  The chocolate torte was rich in flavor, but they missed the mark on the ice cream.  My first bite left me initially wondering if the ice cream was rancid.  It was only after I had thought about the aftertaste that I recognized the unusual raw sweetness as honey.\n\nI may have just been there on an off night.

I remember getting the agnolotti dal plin the last time ... but can't remember if I enjoyed it or not.

She was so great. 6 stars for her. \n\nWe started with a salumi plate- you can't go wrong here- it was so freaking good. \n\nThen we shared the anglotti- wow- what a treat. It came heavily recommended and passed the test with flying colors. \n\nThen we shared/split the rabbit and quail. \n\nI got the quail (luckily and it was very good!) Def a good choice. The rabbit was so-so .. a little too rough... perhaps over cooked. \n\nWe took a NICE bottle of FREEMARK ABBEY wine- omg- ridiculous. It was a 92 Cab Bosche.

It was so bad, I did not care to write a review, but last Thursday my opinion of Perbacco changed for the better.....\n\nI started a liver cleanse diet seven days ago, meaning no alcohol for fifteen days. My first true test of my discipline was at Perbacco when I did not order wine. Throughout the evening, only one person had wine, totaling $8.00.\n\nFor meals, I started with fresh, grilled asparagus with a beautiful hollandaise sauce. For my second course, I shared a papparadelli pasta with short rib meat on top. Both dishes were memorable. \n\nWhat made this restaurant stand out to me was:\n\n1.) The waitress treated us like we ordered there best champagne instead of one glass of wine and tap water.\n2.) They split the pasta without charging an additional fee.\n3.) The meal was only $59.00 for three of us, which is the least I have ever spent for three people in adulthood in San Francisco.\n\nI would give Perbacco a try if you have not been.

The head honcho of the office suggested Perbacco.  Luckily, we made reservations because it was pretty packed on Thursday night.  There were alot of people at the bar enjoying their cocktails, and all the tables were full.  \n\nI arrived 10 minutes early, but the client was even earlier.  They were already seated upstairs, so I had to entertain them until my boss arrived.  It can get pretty loud in the restaurant, so sometimes I would just nod my head and smile and pretend like I knew what they were talking about.\n\nOnce the boss arrived, we decided to order a bottle of wine.  The sommelier recommended two reds.  The client picked, but I can't remember the name....it was something Italian.  It was more of a full bodied wine, and once it had a chance to breathe, it was really good.  \n\nI ordered the Seared Sea Bass and my boss had the Grilled Prather Ranch Sirloin Steak.  I think the clients got the Grilled Berkshire Pork Chop, some seared ahi tuna dish, and a veal dish.  My sea bass was delicious.  It was in a tomato stew with shrimp, mussels and clams.  Since we didn't order any appetizers, the portion was a tad bit on the small side for me.  All of the other dishes looked really good, but I couldn't exactly say, \"hey..let me try some of that.\"  \n\nThe service was great.  Our waitress was quite attentive and made sure we always had everything we needed.  Our water glasses were always full, and our wine always topped off.  \n\nIf you need to use the restroom, find the elevator and head to the basement.  Its quite an interesting journey.  You exit the elevator from the back, and then you walk to a room with 4 doors.  Two M's and two W's.  Behind each door is a toilet and a sink, but there also sinks outside as well.  Kind of weird.  \n\nWith all the budget cuts and layoffs, I haven't had a free meal on the company in a while, so it was a great treat to dine here.  I'll definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu.", "author": "Patra I."}

I sat at the bar while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive since I was there 20 minutes before my reservation, and the bar staff was friendly and amazingly attentive. I ordered the brussel sprouts side dish to nibble on and it was literally in front of me within 5 minutes. It was melt in your mouse buttery brussel sprout goodness.  AND vegetarian, no chicken stock. One thing I really loved about the staff was how accommodating they were to my vegetarian needs, plus there were quite a number of vegetarian items already on the menu.\n\nOnto dinner, I'll point out the highlights, which were pretty much everything. We made reservations to enjoy the special white truffle menu, along with a few items off their regular menu.\n\nRegular menu:\nRabaton - fluffy pillows of delicious cheese and doughy goodness\nStuffed zucchini blossoms - it was ok, but we could've done without it\nOxtail risotto - I didn't try it since it had huge mounds of meat on top and the risotto was made with chicken stock, but I was told it was amazing. \n\nSpecial truffle menu:\nI forget the actual names of the dishes, but I'll try my best to describe them, they were all topped with 3 grams of truffles, shaved table side:\n\nSmall delicate ravioli pasta filled with melt in your mouth cheese - I thought I didn't like ravioli, but apparently I just have never had good ravioli. I don't know what they did, but it was amazing. \n\nEgg noodles (I think) with pancetta and I believe a poached egg on top - I didn't taste this, but everyone at the table seemed to love it\n\nBone marrow risotto - again, I sadly could not try it, but the entire table also loved it\n\nDessert and cheese plate, which was comped due to the waiter spilling water on the table. We're an easygoing group, and we didn't mind at all. They quickly offered us the table next to us as they cleaned up the water. Super nice and attentive staff.\n\nBlue cheese and a soft goat's milk ricotta, if I remember correctly, served with almonds, honey, and golden raisins on the side. Amazing melt in your mouth goodness.\n\nWine spiced sorbet - holy crap, I wanted to leave the restaurant with a pint of this stuff.  Refreshing and full of flavor, it was delicious!\n\nLittle hazelnut chocolate fudge and pistachio fudge - simple and yummy\n\nWe all left dinner completely satisfied and in foodie bliss.", "author": "Sophie P."}

Browse Rossi & Rovetti's website. They're a premium, highly regarded florist in San Francisco.  Make your selection, and give instructions on where and when to deliver to Perbacco for your dinner evening.\n\n3. Call Perbacco and make them note the florist delivery. Call back two more times later (a couple days before the dinner, and then again on the day of) to CONFIRM everything is scheduled as you want.\n\n4. Take her to dinner. Forget street parking. Pay the money for valet and save yourself some stress. On the side confirm with the waiter/waitress that the flowers are in position BEFORE you are taken to the table.\n\n5. Watch her reaction and rejoice your credit card was put to good use!\n\n6. Order dinner and enjoy Perbacco's delicious menu items. Have a sentimental, romantic conversation. Have a card ready in which you've expressed your love, and possibly a gift to be served with dessert.

The menu was a little overwhelming as several options sounded right up my alley. The waiter was really helpful in providing some guidance as he claimed that the raviolo shouldn't be missed. The soft pasta enveloped a luscious, rich filling of truffled-polenta, egg, and corn-truffle butter. Definitely not a dish for the faint of heart. It was quite good, but I wouldn't say it couldn't be missed. The same doesn't hold for my entree, however, the seared sea scallops. The scallops were delicious, perfectly seared and the celery root puree was amazing. It was an exceptional dish and if it's offered the night you happen to come in I highly recommend it. The ambiance was nice, although I would say the tables were a little too close for my taste, or maybe the person next to me just doesn't know how to use an \"inside voice.\" My meal didn't shake up to be classic Italian but it did stand out as a fantastic experience. I highly recommend Perbacco.", "author": "Stephen S."}

This was my second time dining here, and all I could remember was they had great salads and incredible pastas!  We went as a table of six, and my only complaint was that it was a little to loud to really have a nice conversation as a table.  It's okay, because the food made up for it all. I started with their heirloom tomato salad and then the boneless ribs with a bone marrow sauce.  All very exquisite!!  My husband had the mission fig and endive salad, with the parpadelle pasta, and both were simply divine!!!  All this, and a bottle of Paradigm cabernet, and we were off to a great dinner.  Dessert was okay.  Not great, just nothing memorable.  Service was good, nothing memorable either, but I certainly don't have any complaints about it.  \n\nSo, for consistently delicious dishes, I highly recommend this place.  There are hundreds of great restaurants in San Francisco, and this is just one of them.  So if you're in the neighborhood, go for it!  \n\nRight next door is their sister restaurant called Barbacco.

The likelihood of disappointment was high, but Perbacco really pulled through.  I think two aspects of their menu are really worth highlighting - the salumi and the pasta.  The salumi might be cured on site, and if not, it's freshly sliced and there are several options every night.  The pasta is freshly made and there are many, many unique options that don't involve words like Bolognese or manicotti.  They have a (seemingly) new addition to the menu where you can do a pasta tasting for the table.  It worked out wonderfully - we got 3 small pasta servings each which was basically the portion equivalent of an entree. \n\nThe wine list is great and my Barbera did not disappoint.  There are probably 20 nice types of wine by the glass in addition to the numerous bottle choices.  When I came here the first time, I had such outstanding cocktails that they could have been reason enough to come back.  This time, my drink (the eponymous Perbacco) was good, but nothing to swoon over.  I think it was a blip, so no poor marks on that account.\n\nGo here!

Not that they rush you exactly, but courses tend to come out fairly fast and close together and the atmosphere is not one in the dining room that encourages you to stay and talk for hours.

He sat our party of 7 at the chef's table, where we ended up dining for almost 4 hours on a Monday evening. Service was impeccable this time around, and food as delectable as my previous trip. \n\nWe wanted to do family style, so we ordered several apps (would recommend the squid, pork pate, and veal tartare) and let the server decide how we'd mix 'n match our pastas and meats for our entrees. \n\nHe brought us a \"pasta tasting\", which I would recommend if you have 4 or more people. It came out to 1.5 portions of 3 pastas, and they plated each pasta for us individually. It's the best way to eat pastas really, because a full portion of one just isn't as fun as trying a little of 3. The best one was the agnolotti with veal -- absolutely delcious.\n\nWe shared 4 \"meats\" (seared ahi, duck, pork,  beef short ribs). All were wonderful, but I especially liked the duck (hands down, the best duck I've ever had). The beef short ribs was also very, very good. \n\nBut what impressed me the most was that Umberto made that initial effort after my first review, and stayed true to his word when I came back. He didn't need my business -- the place was packed on Monday night. But you can tell he truly cares about his patrons and their experiences; the excellent food and service was an added bonus.\n\nFinally, the food is so different than what you normally find at high-end SF restaurants, even other high-end Italian restaurants, that I think Perbacco can be a destination restaurant for out-of-towners. It's so much more interesting than Gary Danko's, for example. And the prices are very reasonable (we had probably two too many dishes + 3 bottles of wine, and it came out to $95/person).", "author": "Veronica S."}

Beets, procuitto, cheese, salami, we ordered a bunch of appetizers and they were all worth sampling.\n\nBeing the healthy eater I am, as of late anyway, I opted for the halibut.

The noise level was deafening.  3.5 stars.\n\nOne does not cancel out the other, but it does take away from the experience.  What happens when a restaurant that is already loud is that the real loudmouths turn it up several notches so that their voices end up piercing through you like bars of steel.  I think I heard every annoying laugh in existence.\n\nFunny choice for a date place, although that is who we were surrounded by.  I know this for a fact because we could hear every word of our neighbors' conversation, and boy, I wish those two on the right of us good luck.\n\nI was there for a date with my husband to celebrate Mr. S's and my 20th anniversary of our first date.  Sweet occasion.  The lighting gave him a migraine (candles on the table would add much-needed warmth), and we couldn't hear each other.  Not terribly romantic.\n\nDespite everything, I thoroughly enjoyed my food.  We started with the Chef's Choice Salumi Platter which was delicious.  They cure their meats in house, and each type was tender and tasty and full of interesting flavors.  The blood sausage was the standout for me, unique and with amazing depth.\n\nThe next dish was my favorite of the evening:  the Baccala, or Spicy Salt Cod Fritters.  This is a generous dish and should be shared.  God, those things were heavenly - fried spheres filled with creamy, spicy salt cod.  Hubby had the Frito Misto, which was also good - I liked that it included unusual ingredients like fennel and olives in the mix.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Braised Spareribs, which were very good.  Wonderfully tender with a tangy tomato sauce, they were filling but not overwhelming.  I loved the polenta, too.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Semmifreddo, which made with milk chocolate with hazelnut cookies mixed in - dense, creamy, decadent.  This is a huge dessert, perfect to share.\n\nThe service, which I was wary of after having read the reviews, was uneven.  At times, very attentive, at other times, lacking.  We were very looked-after at the beginning of the meal, but were searching for our server by the end.\n\nThe food has an intimate, hand-crafted feel, but unfortunately the atmosphere has the opposite effect.  If you are in the Fidi and need a spot for a corporate dinner, I think you'd be fine.  If you are looking for a place to take a date, or have an in-depth conversation, I would look elsewhere.", "author": "Liz S."}

This place was super busy too, but they offered us a bar table at the front right away where we could order from the full menu - right on! \n\nIt had been a long and stressful week at work, and it wasn't over yet.  I should have been at the office, getting things done, but my very good friend was coming up specifically to see us.  How could I resist?  I think it was the best decision I could have made.\n\nWe were celebrating some very important and happy milestones, so we decided to go all out for dinner.  We ordered a lovely bottle of Syrah wine to share amongst the three of us, well, rather, the two of us, since one of my friends wasn't drinking.  For starters we had the prosciutto and melon and the sea scallops.  The melon was a strange and yet oh so perfect accompaniment to the prociutto, and the sea scallops, though raw (much to my surprise - I didn't really read the menu carefully) were excellent.\n\nFor dinner I had the saffron risotto with braised beef cheeks - WOW!  The saffron risotto was exquisite, so flavorful, and the meat was extremely tender, that everything melted in your mouth in just the right way.  I tried some of the ribs, which were also quite tender.  One thing I have noticed about this place on this occasion, and on a previous visit here, is that they leave a lot of the fat on their meat.  Does this make it more tender? Flavorful? I personally don't like the fat to remain on my meat, but that could just be me.  The halibut was tasty, but a bit dry.\n\nDessert was delectable!  I am a big fan of dessert, so I was really excited when I got to order what I wanted, then got my companions to order the other two items that I wanted to try. :)  I had the peach and raspberry cake with peach ice cream, all of which was excellent; however it came with this intriguing (and yucky) champagne jello type substance.  I like champagne, and I like jello, but those are two things that didn't mix well on my plate.  I got to try the chocolate torte - overwhelmingly chocolatey, but good, just make sure to order some milk or something.  I think the winner though, was my friends plum crostini.

Hispanic workers run most of the restaurants in the country (look in the kitchens and see who's making the food).  Our server was hispanic, as were most of the runners and servers were in the room.    About time.  Bravo!\n\nThe pastas are great - well seasoned, balanced with deep, deep flavors.  Carol had the Papardelle with Short Rib Sauce - wow! - and I had the Agnolotti with Bunny and Truffles - also very good, but they were really Agnolotini or Gnocchi sized, but I'm probably just splitting hares (sic).  \n\nThe wine list is very well chosen and fairly priced.   Kerner (a fairly obscure Riesling cross) from the Alto Adige by the glass ?!?!   Well aged Barolos in half bottles?!?!  Nice.   \n\nNow the negatives.  \nThe room is ugly.  Tables butted up against columns, concrete, brick, shiny surfaces.  The designer for the space should be whipped with a pappardelle!!

Also, Barolo shoudn't be served in Pinot Glasses, but that's minor....\n\nThe salad was fine - boring really. But, the lettuces were sopping wet from not having been dried, which made the vinaigrette overbearing. \n\nThe \"signature\" fritto misto was tired - the lemon slices were too thick to eat, and the batter was waay too dough-y to appreciate the interplay between the succulent rock shrimp and the crunchiness of the green beans.

The pappardelle was very good, but I might have to really order the tagliatelle next time!\n\nWe didn't see anything that jumped out at us on their dessert menu and decided to pass. BUT, that didn't mean we weren't going to have dessert at all (see my next review)! Our kind server brought us some complimentary squares of house-made chocolate hazelnut gianduia and some torrone nougat so we didn't leave without something sweet!", "author": "Connie C."}

Because at Perbacco, ordering carefully is the key to dining success.  Perbacco has only been open like a month, so maybe in time every item on the menu will be incredible, but for now there are great heights as well as some duds.  My ideal dinner there would consist of the following: Salumi, most of which they cure themselves -- maybe you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear but you can make wonderful salumi out of it!  Then the freakin' agnolotti, which descends from heaven on a cloud -- everybody else is writing about the agnolotti so I don't need to reiterate, just get some.  Then two desserts, the gelato trio and the panna cotta -- in particular, the caramel gelato is not to be believed.  Breadsticks throughout the meal, and a glass of vanilla bean mint lemonade, and that is nearly a perfect meal as you will find in SF.\n\nContrariwise, their risotto was avearge, the skate was dull, the short-rib stracotto was tender but boring, the artichoke soup was nothing special, and the beet greens were just too oily and salty.  Fortunately no one is forcing you to order these dishes!  Just stick to the winners.  The staff was great and the decor is too.  If I drank wine I'd probably praise that as well.", "author": "Ian G."}

I was told 11:15 or 1:30 were the only reservation openings, which is understandable for financial district lunch time crowd.  We arrived promptly at 1:25 and weren't seated until 1:45, by that time I could have gone to Fatt Dogg.\nSeating downstairs is definitely sleeker and less stuffy than the upstairs, where you don't get the high cielings and nice atmosphere.  Nonetheless I had the better than average petrale sole.

My first thought is, why?\n\nI'm giving it three stars though that's a little much, only because it's right by my office and I know it will be on rotation for weekly fancy lunches, and I must psych myself up for coming back.  It's easy to get bored in the FiDi and I am thankful to have a new restaurant to break the monotony, even if the restaurant itself IS monotonous.\n\nSo let's get down to it.  Ambiance first.  Basically, decor schizophrenia.  Sleek and elegant bar area, ugly-toned corporate-ish main dining room with low ceilings and a long stairway to underbelly-of-the-building restroom oblivion.  Where am I?\n\nService next.  This was one of the longest dinners of my life.   Why the almost one hour wait between apps and mains?  Maybe I would not have minded if I actually liked the person I was with.  But I was on a blind date.  That was boring me to death.  Bad date + long wait = drink entire bottle of wine almost entirely on own.\n\nNow food.  See, usually I put food first because it's what I care about the most.  But this food did not want me to care about it.  It was... meh.  I think the kitchen is afraid of salt.  Because the veal tartare desperately needed it (and where were the black truffles?).  And both pasta dishes (yes, I ordered two, because I needed to eat constantly to provide myself some form of amusement) suffered from a glaring lack of flavor - and I ordered the most flavorful-sounding ones: the much-touted agnolotti and the papardelle with short rib ragu and chanterelles!   What is going on here if butter sauces and long-cooked meats and earthy mushrooms taste like nothing?\n\nBut I think there is hope.  Sit at the chic bar, order a glass of wine from the nicely thought-out list, and have a bunch of salumi (which I did not get to order due to date's embarrassingly vanilla palate - I mean, I insisted on the veal tartare and he wouldn't even eat it!).   I mean, how could that be bad?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHad a biz lunch there today.  \n\nThe good:\n\n*Butternut squash ravs (if a touch, undersalted, no surprise there)  *Pear/blue cheese salad.  No complaints.  \n*Pork sugo: sauce was delicious, complex, flavorful,  BUT\n\nThe bad:\n\n*It was glopped on some very thin, very overcooked delicate pasta - think angel hair gone south.  No cohesion here.  I am perplexed: why this noodle choice?  \n*Burrata app: cheese was on the verge of going bad.  Nothing worse than past-its-prime burrata.  Plus it needed salt (I know, shocker).  \n\nThe ugly:\n\n*They FORGOT my cappuccino!  And I had to run back to the office with no caffeine to get me through the afternoon.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nSticking with my initial 3 stars.  But I still need to go back to try that salumi...", "author": "Melissa B."}

And I owe it all to one of my Absolute Favorite People in the whole wide world (AFP).  Ever eat with someone whose recommendations are consistently flawless?  I'm so lucky!  I have!  And I got to do that at Perbacco!\n\nI KNEW I ordered wrong before (see below).  This time, we relied on the know-how, recommendations and talents of one of the hawtest, friendliest, knowledgeable, talented bartenders around.  His name is *drumroll* SCOTT.  Wait, did I mention he was talented AND hawt?  Scott conjured up some seriously yummy and original cocktails.

Amazing selection of varying flavors and textures.  I can't say I have a favorite, since all of them were excellent and exceedingly fresh.  And so different.  Served with a couple of slices of toasted bread, their famous breadsticks and a few cornichons.  I can't stop thinking about the salumi! \n\n-CHEESE.  Scott recommended a huge hunk of soft cheese topped with a generous helping of lovely, flavorful black truffle oil.\n\n-PISTACHIO CAKE with a vanilla custard filling and fresh cherry compote.  HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, this is ONE OF THE BEST DESSERTS I'VE EVER EATEN.  The cake and filling were not overly sweet.  The cake itself was amazingly fresh, perfect texture and divine fresh pistachio flavor.  A miracle in a cake.  That's what I'm calling it from now on. \n\nPerbacco makes you re-think your notions of food and good food.

Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  Actually, most of my stars are for the stellar service and accommodation by the hosts and the servers, who really go out of their way for you, i.e., quick, efficient, friendly, helpful but not wanting to join you for dinner service.  Plus the place is rather spacious.  \n\nCocktails are alright.  We had the pearlini and the rosmarino.  Alright, not stellar.  Not wanting to make you want more :(.\n\nEats -- hamachi, shrimp (appetizer) and risotto.  Other than the hamachi, which was simple and fresh, the other dishes were not partic. inspired.

I may have been affected yet again by the hype and high expectations of having it on my to try list since it opened. :-O\n\nCost to worth it ratio: 3\n\nHighlights:\n- Waiter: I nicknamed him Italian Mr. Happy. I have never in my history dining ever encountered a sunnier--like warning: wear sunglasses--disposition. It got a tad bit unsettling at times only because I could only imagine what that type of happiness would be like, but you can't fault a naturally cheery happy person--the rest of us try to reach that point artificially. \n- Atmosphere: bustling with activity. Bar area up front, spacey open area with a lofty ceiling, and another area to the side with lower ceilings.\n Loud so not necessarily a romantic spot, but my girl friend and I were there for a good time together, so we didn't mind. Only thing is we couldn't understand Mr. Italian Happy with his soft voice amidst the full dining room.\n- Tomato bread salad: a rainbow of tomatoes (red, yellow, green, and even purple) with a side of a pile of mooshy bread mixed with a fresh tomato sauce. I'm a big tomato fan so I liked it all.\n- Short ribs: pretty good and also big portion.\n- Trofie pesto pasta: only place I've seen this outside of cinque terra in Italy. Exciting that it was on the menu, but I refrained from ordering it for fear it wouldn't live up to the original.\n- Location: just a few doors down from the legendary Aqua and Tadich Grill.\n\nMidlights:\n- Wine: good sized list. We got a few recommended glasses, but didn't care for them so much.\n- Frito misto: kind of a guess what that fried piece is game. After a few bites, we discovered fennel which was a unique choice, but a bit too much of it in the slice sizes and amount of it in the mix. The rounded light green items I originally pegged for okra, but ended up being olives. There were two different colored peas (green and white) which I liked, but wish there were more shrimp.\n- Brussel sprouts: halved with a lot of parmesan cheese--a bit over for my taste like it started snowing on top of it and if they waited any longer in the storm, it would have been a mound of white.\n \nLowlights (my flip side to highlights):\n- Crowds: even for a early weekday after work, so just keep that in mind. I was going to have a drink before dinner, but could barely fit through the door so went elsewhere.\n\nDecent meal, but I was looking for a knock my socks off standout for the relatively new hot-spot.

I perused the limited list of wines by the glass.  For an Italian place, they had no Pinot Grigio!!! But the waiter made a great comparable recommendation.\n\nMain course - I got the veal and cabbage ravioli.  If you love any pasta stuffed with any food product as much as I do, you'll be a happy camper.  Yes, the cabbage part sounds bizarre, but in fact, it added the perfect crunch to it. \n\nDessert - I'm usually hell bent on having something chocolate, but I'm glad I broadened my horizons.  The warm pistachio cake is possibly the best dessert I've ever had.  Moist cake with just enough nuts to add crunch and cold ice cream to balance the warm cake.\n\nCheese - yes, this was a dining event based on the number of courses we had.

Once we were seated, we were shown to Perbacco's private dining room--unexpected and very nice! Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the kitchen which was a great treat for those interested in behind-the-scenes of a great restaurant. Our families are a boisterous group, so it was good to have our own space and not worry about interfering with others around us. \n\nWe were served by several people, and each one was professional and a pleasure to interact with. Our families area boisterous lot, with most a type-A personality that can be difficult to deal with, but the staff was incredibly adept at dealing with us throughout the evening. One of my major concerns about taking two families out for dinner alleviated!\n\nWe ordered their fantastic salumi platter for the table, and when it arrived we were told that the chef decided to give us two platters that contained everything he offered rather than two platters with duplicate items. Wow. Not only great food, but great consideration in thinking about optimizing our experience. Not surprisingly, we had a great time sampling and comparing everything served--a wonderful start.\n\nWe had some real wine connoisseurs at the table, and the sommelier  showed up and dealt with three people simultaneously making demands on his wine list. He handled us adeptly and we ended up with some incredible wines: some that he recommended given our food orders and a description of the kind of wine that we liked, and some varietals that we specifically pointed that we wanted to try.\n\nMost of the table was from out of town but had sophisticated palates, and they were all impressed with what they were served. The dishes were served simultaneously, not easy to do for a table of 9, and really done to perfection. The quality of each dish was truly amazing--one or two great dishes out of nine is expected, but the number of incredible quality dishes was truly amazing. I was so happy that my out-of-town family was ecstatic over the food they were served--as were the in-towners! And I can't overstate the quality of service that we received.\n\nIt was my wife's birthday and they brought out a nice dessert for her, but subtle and no crass \"happy birthday\" celebratory motions that would not have fit with the mood.\n\nNot only did the evening impress our sophisticated out-of-towners, but also our more demanding local foodies, and me who probably had the highest expectations for Perbacco which I know well.

Does that mean that Perbacco is on par with Taco Bell? No. I just hold them to different standards, and in both categories (\"fast food\" and \"finer dining\"), both establishments fall dramatically short of satisfaction. \n\nFOOD - not so much. \n1) Salad - I got a salad that had a strong citrus element, with slices of grapefruit, I believe. The fruit slices had lots of internal skin, meaning that I had to pick at it and rip is apart to make it satisfactorily edible, and there were SEEDS left in it, which, in my book, is inexcusable. Maybe that's just my tastes, but.. you're a restaurant that's attempting to create good food and give it a decent presentation... don't lay it out so that your customers have to finish the basic prep work for you when the food hits the table. \n\n2) Main - buckwheat pasta\nI ordered a pasta dish that normally comes with prosciutto, but  had them skip the ham. It tasted good, but came with slices of potato (??!??!?@??!?) in it. I'm sorry, but if I'm ordering a CARB-BASED entree, I really don't need extra starches tossed in. It made no sense. \n\nCHOICES - \nAs I recall, there was literally ONE vegetarian option on the menu for entrees and most of the desserts were laden with alcohol, which I detest. Unfortunately, you couldn't request an alcohol-free version, since it was cooked in. \n\nPALATE DOMINATION\nI think what left the worst impression on me, regarding the food, was that the menu seemed dominated by one palate that was very particular - really rustic meat oriented. There were plenty of choices on the menu, but they all seemed to come from the same vein of culinary style, one that, as a pregnant woman, I clash with. Even the fish was unworkable for me at the moment. It seemed like the head chef created this menu to please his or her whims, without considering the varied tastes of their clientle.\n\nThe customers shouldn't have to hunt the menu to find what they can \"settle\" with and then have to have modified in the kitchen. Ideally, a good menu should offer a few options for a variety of types of palates. \n\nATMOSPHERE: \n1. UNBELIEVABLE NOISY - great for after work drinks and apps, wind-down socialization. Horrendous if you want to have actual conversation at your table. \n\n2. CIGARETTE SMOKE - We were seated on the third floor, yet somehow cigarette smoke wafted up and emanated around the dining room for a good 20 minutes. Given the location of the front door versus the staff area in the basement, I'm thinking it's a lot more likely the smoke came from a staff member having a smoke break, rather than someone out front. The bottom line is that a staff member on the third floor should have noticed and immediately had the situation addressed. \n\nSERVICE\nThis is a pet peeve... If I'm eating at a relatively fine-dining location, I want my service to be unnoticeable.*** The ideal is minimal interaction with the table, getting orders, etc, and then seamlessly refilling waters, beverages, delivering food, removing empty plates in a way that is unremarkable. \n\nSadly, our waitress was of the \"hey folks, welcome to my show\" mentality, so we had constant interruptions from her that were wholly unnecessary - interrupting us in mid-sentence to inquire if we wanted more to drink, if we were DONE with our food that we were still eating, etc. Ridiculous. Also, it was all delivered with an overly engaging, disruptive and peppy attitude, like she was inserting herself into our dinner company and trying to join our table. \n\nThe rest of the staff was equally bad - the busboys literally hovered near the table to try to swoop in the moment a fork was set down. \n\nThey seemed to be rushing us to turn the table, but we were by no means lingering and wasting time. \n\nBottom line - major disappointment. I will NOT be going back, even if someone else is footing the bill. \n\n***I worked for many years as a waitress in a variety of restaurants, from fine dining to pizza joints. As a waitress, I enjoy the chit-chat and casual attitude of slinging pizza, but I also deeply appreciate appropriate deference in a nicer establishment.", "author": "Hannah Q."}

I thought the food was quite good, but I'd stop short of saying it's excellent. \n\nWe started off with the raw fish appetizer, which I didn't know you would find at an Italian restaurant. I'm half-Japanese and have had plenty of sashimi in my life. So, I was a little skeptical of this appetizer, but my friend really wanted me to try it. I did and was pleasantly surprised to find the fish very fresh, and tasty with the light sauce and garnish they added. My only beef is that it was too pricey for a few pieces.\n\nFor the entree I ordered the house-made pasta with the pork sugo, which is meat sauce. I believe it's called Tajarin. I liked it from the first bite. The pasta tasted great and the sauce was delicious. However, I like more variety in my food and this was very simple, pasta and meat sauce. \n\nI guess I should have figured out what it was before I ordered it. If you like it simple, then you'll like this dish.\n\nWe didn't have dessert, but the very kind owner, who stopped by to say hi as my friend knows him, perhaps decided to bless us with a few hazelnut cookies. They were chewy, airy and delicious. They even gave us a few other small sweets with our check. I thought that was very generous and nice of them.\n\nBy the way, my other friend ordered the sea bass and thought it was terrific. It came with large corona beans that looked like elephant garlic or small peeled potatos. I was told they were buttery and very good accompaniment for the fish. \n\nI thought the interior was done very well, but a little too live for me. I like my restaurants less noisy. I would dine here again to try the house-cured meats and other dishes.", "author": "Michael N."}

My first visit was after an exhausting day's work with girlfriends.  We had just finished a long, food-less seminar and arrived for dinner hungry.  We placed our order and - needless to say - devoured our breadsticks while waiting for our first course.  We asked for more and were given a cold, hard stare like we asked for the waiter's first-born.  Although a decent meal, the service was steely cold and unfriendly that night.  \n\nSo I returned for the cocktail hour with a business colleague on a Monday.

You can check those off the list.\n\nNow, for the food:\n\n1. (appetizer) Yellowfin Tuna Crudo - tasty but my dining companion found a bone in his piece.  Erh, the only explanation I could come up with was I don't recall Italians being known as sushi chefs.  It was also a bit fishy.  The good thing about this dish is the taste and texture of combining watermelon cubes with the fennel and tomato.  Amazingly inventive!\n\n2. (entree) Garganelli - excellent flavor and juicy rabbit meat.  Definitely a winner among the risottos.\n\n3. (entree) Beef Short Rib Stracotto - tender and flavorful but could have used a bit more flavor.  The mushrooms were a great touch but I didn't understand the purpose of having peas mixed in.  Perhaps for color?\n\n4. (dessert) Red Plum Crostata - the crust was a bit soggy but the plum made a great contrast to the basil gelato.  The basil is potent.  Take small bites.\n\nOverall, this is a nice restaurant for little occasions.  Despite what you might think walking in, this is a fairly large restaurant.  For a place where I was hoping to catch a casual dinner, it was a bit extravagant.  However, the prices are very reasonable for the quality and they have a good Italian wine selection to pair with the food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-04-11", "description": "Our initial visit left us disappointed but convinced that the food was worthy if you steered clear of so-so main courses in favor of pastas. We decided that the colossally amateurish service we experienced was what prevented us from having the sort of night that we'd gush about. But after a second visit with significantly better service but much worse food, we just can't join the chorus of praise.\n\nAll through both meals, we noticed, over and over again, problems of size and intensity. Too much, not enough, too much, not enough... like some practical joke played by the kitchen at our expense.\n\nFirst, the overkill: On our initial visit, we loved the burrata appetizer, but quickly tired of its unctuous, truffled intensity. A strongly flavored salad was another tastebud-killer: All the components hung together well, but by the time he was halfway through, the richness of chestnut honey, gorgonzola, and hazelnuts was just exhausting. On our return trip, a beet-and-arugula salad offered just too much of the same flavors, over and over, without relief.\n\nNext, the underwhelming flavors: Although the feta-like Castelmagno cheese on that same beet-and-arugula salad provided too much salt, the beets themselves were nearly flavorless. On our second visit, a pasta didn't appear to have any salt in the dough, and had been dressed with unsalted butter. A cauliflower soup was perfectly velvety but didn't actually taste like cauliflower.\n\nAnd then, unpredictable portions: We loved the tajarin (hand-cut tagliatelle) with pork-and-porcini sugo as a middle course on our first visit, but an entre portion that we ordered on our second visit was only a smidge larger. Similarly, the sides accompanying all three main courses we ordered (over the course of 2 visits) were so skimpy that you wished the chef would just offer his entrees a la carte and be done with it.\n\nAnd frankly, Perbacco's entrees are its weakest link. The pork shoulder al latte turned out to be an unappetizingly symmetrical chunk of pig --- plated like Lean Cuisine on a small oval dish --- that lacked the cut-it-with-a-fork tenderness that's the hallmark this traditionally braised dish. And again, the sides were laughably meager. (Could there be anything cheaper than corn mush and cabbage?)\n\nBoth times we opted for gelato for dessert. Presented in adorable ceramic dishes made to look like partially crushed Dixie cups, the flavors ran the gamut from delightful (fleur de sel caramel) to overwhelmingly unpleasant (pistachio).\n\nSadly, we doubt we'll take another stab at dinner at Perbacco. We can envision returning for a plate of salumi at the bar, alongside one of their well-made cocktails... especially the Rosmarino. And certainly, if friends suggested we meet at Perbacco, we wouldn't decline. But for the price --- dinner both times hovered near the $200 mark for a full complement of food but minus any blow-out wines or other additions --- we can't afford the gamble of another hit-and-miss meal.", "author": "anita c."}

None of them are as consistent on so many levels though; I can honestly say I've never had an awful meal or service here (and I honestly can't believe it's taken me this long to get a review up). Anyway, today was a winemaker lunch for ten, and of course most everything was marvelous. We shared some apps around the table but everyone ordered their own entree, so I got a nibble from quite a few different menu items. And I could make a meal out of the crisp grissini & salsa verde that garnish every table!\nSalumi misti: an assortment of at least ten different meats, all cured in-house. I tried the dark venison salami, the Nebbiolo salami, and a milder salami with chanterelles. There was also a crostini topped with pancetta and some more grissini wrapped with cured lardo, both delectable. I even tried the salami di testa (my first headcheese experience!) and it was really good! There was a delicious, somewhat spicy mostarda on the side as well. I was surprised that there wasn't any mortadella, but it was still  a great mixed platter, perfect for sharing.\nBurrata: always a classic! The seasonal preparation included thinly-sliced zucchini, marinated fiorelli (zucchini blossoms) and (peeled!) cherry tomatoes, a shmear of pesto, and crushed marcona almonds. It was good but surprisingly not my favorite app this time - needed salt for sure, and I didn't really get a lot of almond flavor. I almost would rather have had the piastra-seared squid w/chilies and corona bean puree, which I have enjoyed in the past.\nFritto misto: rock shrimp, fennel, green beans, yellow wax beans, and even Castelvetrano olives (my fave!). Bummer though, no fried lemon slices like I've had before.  Delightfully fresh lemon aioli was served on the side though, in a large enough ramekin that I didn't have to ask for more :)\nI ordered my favorite, agnolotti dal Plin, as my entree. I am never, ever disappointed in this dish. The pasta is delicately folded around roasted veal and Savoy cabbage, with tender cabbage bits and an incredibly flavorful vealy jus drenching the plate. I got a bite of my neighbor's trofie w/pesto & potato that was good as well. I've also enjoyed the tajarin w/pork sugo (such a simple sauce but sooo flavorful). I would now like to call out the first dish that I ever had here (last October) as one of the most amazing pasta dishes I have ever experienced: housemade garganelli with squab ragu and golden chanterelles. That alone warrants the five-star rating, ten if I were allowed to go that high! Steffen's pasta creations are seriously amazing.\nGrazie mille a Umberto & Mauro for consistently providing a great service experience, and thanks also to the familiar faces of the staff (Juan & Alexandra).

The restaurant is split into 4 areas: the bar in the front with a couple high tables for 4, the upstairs and two downstairs areas. The right side of the downstairs feels almost like a cafeteria with low ceilings, strange lighting and crowded so I wouldn't recommend that. We sat in the left area which is spacious, has nice leather benches and great big tables.\nThe food was pretty good. Nothing super exceptional but the steak on the open faced steak sandwich was very tasty and exactly cooked the way we asked for.\nOverall the menu is a little bit confusing and I wish there would be more soups on it. \n\n4 stars because the FiDi needed another place for fancier but not over the top biz lunch.", "author": "Doro P."}

The furnishings' typical of these kinds of restaurants, but I liked the mossy green/brown/taupe color scheme, always put me at ease. My party of 4 (including yelper Jennifer y) had 11:30 res for lunch and was seated immediately. We were the first party on the second level, and within minutes the entire level filled up. I observed that the paintings hanging on this level was pretty fugly-please get some new ones! We were looking forward to the Michael Bauer-recommended bread sticks, and they were pretty good. Throughout our meal we were also served this foccacia bread that was steeped in way too much oil. \n\nFor apps we shared the beets salad (I'm not a beets fan, but the thin layer of castelmagno cheese on top was really good), and some kind of cod dish that was SUPER salty. For our main courses, Jenn y and I both had the short ribs that were so tender it fell off the bone. I loved the accompanying celery root, but didn't like the salad. Our companions had the scallop risotto with a lovely tinge of meyer lemon, and the agnolotti pasta that tasted really hearty. We shared a refreshing meyer lemon semifreddo, and I particularly enjoyed the candied lemon zest on top. And we all washed it down with a glass of celebratory bubbly.\n\nOur wait staff was efficient and capable, although our waitress had a shrill voice not that pleasant on my ears-but obviously that's got nothing to do with the restaurant. Everyone was pleased with the experience, and we had to squeeze through a huge crowd of diners waiting their turn. Good thing we came early; this is obviously a hot FiDi lunch spot.

The pork pate that came with it was a nice compliment.  \n\nNext, we had the organic peach salad with arugula that was so fresh and unique.  We also had some fried rock shrimp and green beans with a creamy sauce.  \n\nNext course included a stuffed pasta with rabbit and duck meat along with another dish of papardelle with a meat sauce.  Both were so satisfying despite my hesitance in eating rabbit for the first time. \n\nOur meat course included short ribs with a creamy mashed potato on one plate and duck breast with a sweet glaze and more of those juicy peaches.\n\nOur dessert course included a fig panna cotta that was so silky and not too sweet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-07-03", "description": "My wife and I went to lunch here the other day after reading about it on OpenTable.  We booked a lunch reservation, and were looking forward to the experience.\n\nI agree with Brian D.'s review that the breadsticks are top-notch, but that alone can't earn too many stars.  Like Ann, we also had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, despite a reservation; it didn't bother me too much, though.\n\nMy overall impression was that everything was way too oily.  Maybe we chose poorly from the menu, but I left the restaurant feeling pretty lousy and glad to be finished.\n\nWe started off with the Salumi Misti and Brandacujun (salt cod and potato gratin served with crostini).  The salumi plate was OK, but nothing special.  It wasn't nearly as good as the salumi misti that we had the previous week in Seattle at Salumi, and it wasn't nearly as good as the charcuterie plate we had at Daniel Boulud Brasserie at the Wynn in Las Vegas.\n\nThe best part of the Brandacujun for me was the crostini (breadsticks and crostini were the highlight of my meal) -- I've never had this before, so I don't have any point of comparison, but it was fishy and salty (too be expected), but also very oily.  Maybe that is how this dish is made, but it left me feeling very lethargic after eating less than my half.\n\nOur entrees (seabass for my wife and petrale sole for me) were good tasting, but also very oily.  I guess I was hoping for a lighter fish dish, and got a very heavy one.  Combined with our appetizers, it made for an unpleasant combination.\n\nOne other positive note, I did enjoy my drink, a watermelon concoction that was very refreshing (I'll have to check my notes to find the exact name).\n\nOverall, it was a stylish restaurant with nice decor, lots of beautiful patrons (quite a few speaking Italian), attentive service, but food that didn't match my tastes at all.  I would opt for a different Italian restaurant next time I'm in San Francisco.", "author": "Bruce R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-04", "description": "This is a long story that starts with frustration and ends well.\n\nI read that restaurants are having a hard time attracting business and are working hard to make their customers happy.  Perbacco is still learning about this message.\n\nOver a month ago I made a reservation for our wine tasting group to go to Perbacco, we heard good things about their food and wanted to taste Chianti Classico's.  When making the reservation for our group of 6, I explained to the hostess that we would be bringing 6 bottles of wine and would likely buy one or two.  She explained that there was 20 dollar corkage and a 2 bottle limit.  I told her this was a no go and she paused and said we will work it out for you.  I told her great and the group was ready to go tomorrow.\n\nSo today I get a call from the host, he says there is a note here that you want to bring 6 bottles; we have a 2 bottle limit.  So I explain my conversation.  Instead of saying OK, he says, you have to talk the sommelier.\n\nThe sommelier got on the phone after a long hold and told me there was  a 2 bottle limit.  I told him what happened.  He told me OK, if we made a mistake then we will waive the policy but added that he wants to sell his wine to his customers and let me know that he was not happy about our coming with our bottles.  I even asked him to come over that evening and share a glass with us and sell us a Chianti of theirs and he blew me off.  He made it clear that I had to convince him to let us into their restaurant.\n\nThe more i thought about it after I hung up the more irritated I became.  And then I picked up the NY Times dining section (does anyone else miss the Chron food section on Weds?) and there was an article on how restaurants are becoming more hospitable to their clients!  Here is a link:  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/dining/04note.html?_r=1&ref=dining\n\nThat did it,  I cancelled and will stay in the East Bay.  And when I callled to cancel they didn't really seem to care.  Hope their business holds up, they are not working to attract new customers in these funky times and that does not make sense.  Not to mention blowing off a 600 dollar check.\n\nThat afternoon I received a phone call from Umberto, the owner of Perbacco who apologized for what happened.  He asked if there was anything they could do to make up for the situation, he was very professional and respectful, and I appreciated that.  I said no, we had moved on.  He has emailed me as well.\n\nThat same evening I attended a great panel discussion on the life of MFK Fisher  and it reminded me once again that the love of food and company and wine are great passions that drive our lives. She was also someone who told it as like it is.\n\nI am sure that the sommelier at Perbacco has great wine knowledge and is a good person but he needs to realize that when a commitment is made to a customer, it must be kept, not challenged. Frankly, the host should never have transferred the call to him in the first place. That is what customer service is about, keeping your promises and empowering your staff.\n\nAnd a final note.  The next evening the owner, who knew where we would be eating in the East Bay after our conversation, went out of his way to buy us a bottle of Proseco before our meal.   That was exceptional and for that alone, the rating goes to a hopeful two stars.", "author": "Jules K."}

My Mother and I had to sit sideways on chairs while waiting for our table, and were hustled and bustled around by various servers as we were edging into the flow of traffic.  Think of a solution for this people. \n\n2) The waiter was charming and very excited to offer us his thoughts on the menu. We followed his suggestions to the \"t\" and I would note that the beef short ribs were amazing!!!  Super duper good.  On the not as good side, the fennel seasoned pork salumi, tasted like a slab of butter. \n\n3) Not sooo good dude.  We waited 40 minutes, yes that's 40 minutes, for our appetizer.  Granted, we had some of the Salumi to tide us over, but you cannot eat salumi and breadsticks for 40 minutes without becoming, well, annoyed.  Sooo I cancelled the recommended salt cod appetizer, that, of course, arrived a mere 30 seconds after I cancelled it.  Sorry dude, but that is a seriously long time to wait and Momma gotta work tomorrow. \n\n3) The entrees were fabu and the wine list is really kick ass. The Italian Sav Blancs by the glass were excellent, and the Nebbiolo I had with my short rib was also great.  The wines by the glass selection actually gets 5 stars. \n\nConclusion: They took the salt cod off the bill and also comped us our glasses of wine to make up for the ahhh, rather long wait.

It cracks me up that so many well-suited biznessfolks are always milling around the entrance during the weekday lunch-hour, and the fact that many of them are turned away because, due to the quality of its service and food, tables at Perbacco are hard-won without a reservation beforehand. Which is why I ALWAYS remember to make a reservation, because it's not to be missed.\n\nThey've added a few new delicious menu items as of this week (10/28/09), and may I say that if you have ANY interest in risotto, you should try the new risotto with braised ox-tails entree! It was so flavorful, rich and creamy, and thankfully, my lunch companion and I split the dish because it was a huge portion.

I look at several items with particular focus 1) ingredients 2) preparation 3) plating 4) environment 5) service and 6) wine list.   When these items are not working together the experience is un-even.  \n\n  \nThe service element was off from the beginning.  When I arrived I checked in with the host to my departure I was completely surprised and disappointed.  Disappointed with the hosts - the first host asked me to \"relax\" in a very crowded bar.  There was no where for me to \"relax.\"  Another host queries if I have been helped; I replied yes and then I am asked to check in again.  This was a sign of what was to come.\n\n  \nThe wait staff was less than friendly--even chilly.  Hardly excited about menu; was not willing to allow me to see which wine I would like the best by agreeing to my request for a splash.  When I get a splash I am always satisfied with my choice.  We were having a hard time deciding what to eat; little guidance or suggestions were made.  \n\n  \nThe food was quite different from the service.  The food was beautifully executed such an opposite experience to the service.  We began with the Ahi Tuna--the Ahi was perfectly fresh; even the olive oil was superb; gently drizzled; in my opinion it is easy to over use olive oil--that olive oil just a touch of lemon--so little of a touch that you may not detect it.  The other first plate was a salt cod fritti - four large spheres of slightly spiced salt  cod--a completely abundant dish.\n\n  \nMy stripped sea bass was a beautiful masterpiece of green abundance; pieces of olive complemented the sea bass.  There two large slices of potato--I was completely filled but the potatoes were so compelling.  When I am full I stop; I kept going and enjoyed each morsel as if I would never eat these potatoes again.\n\n  \nThe food portion, even by, San Francisco standards were generous I had only wished my pour of wine was as generous.

Our server was attentive and thoughtful touching our table in just the right away.\n\nNow, the food- this was a temporary menu developed by Joyce Goldstein who formerly operated Square One.  The culinary team of Perbacco did a fantastic job of bringing her vision to  our plate.  Vegetable dishes were executed beautifully.

The entire experience was flawless from start to finish. We went an hour before our reservation to grab drinks at the bar. While the bar was PACKED, the bartender saw me squeezing my way towards him and patiently waited. \n\nDrinks:\nMojito - I hate mint but my friend really liked it\nPerbacco - very refreshing, citrus vodka with a splash of amaretto\nHouse champagne - solid\nWine - we really enjoyed our bottle of Dama Montelpulciano and it was cheap!\n\nAt 7pm on the dot, our table was ready for us. The restaurant gets pretty loud, which is where they lose the half star. We were upstairs where I thought it would be quieter, but there was a private party in the room behind us and you could still hear the riff raff from the bar. \n\nFood:\nBreadsticks w/ pesto - awesome!\nBread - fresh!\nFritto rock shrimp starter - good, wide assortment of freshly fried stuff, great for sharing\nPappardelle - awesome flavor, homemade pasta was perfectly done and made the dish!\nPork chop - thick, meaty, and juicy\nTajarin - again, homemade pasta melted in your mouth! simple, tasty.\n\nThe dishes were just the right size, well for me anyways. At first glance, you wonder if there's enough pasta but by the end, you feel great. Service was impeccable and our waitress gave us great recommendations. I thought the prices were extremely reasonable - with appetizer, pasta, and bottle of wine, we all came out under $40 each.

We checked it out on a Friday evening in spring, when it buzzed with contented diners, most of whom - to my surprise - didn't look like they'd just left the office. \n\nPerbacco is a stylish restaurant, although somehow more Manhattan than San Francisco in its style.  Its relatively narrow entranceway belies the large dining room that unfolds over two levels towards the back of the long space that it occupies.  The front of the restaurant is dominated by a long, classic cocktail bar, where dinner is also served either at the bar itself or in one of the booths directly opposite.  The main seating areas - a large, open ground floor space with a mezzanine overhang - lie beyond the bar area.  The space has a high ceiling, with a tall exposed brick wall (another Manhattanesque touch) opposite the mezzanine level.  \n\nIt's deceptively big, with the main section of tables tucked away under the mezzanine, out of the view of the bar area.  The conversation buzzes, but the space seems neither noisy nor crowded.  If I have one criticism of this beautifully designed space, it's that there are a few support pillars that obstruct the tables that are close to them.  Our - otherwise nice - table for two was next to one of them and it was a bit of an encumbrance both to the dining experience and the service.  But no big deal.\n\nThe food is mostly excellent - standard rustic Italian fare with lots of enticing, ingredients-driven dishes.  We split a fritto misto to start with - a delicious mix of shrimp with fried olives, fennel and beans, before moving onto pasta.  The Tajarin with 5 hour pork sugo and porcini mushrooms was delicious and perfectly sized.  The parpadelle with short rib ragu and grated horseradish didn't quite deliver - the horseradish slightly overpowering the ragu.  The cheese board is worth the visit by itself, and Perbacco boasts an excellent list of predominantly Italian wine.  The well-dressed, convivial proprietor greeted diners with warmth and (on this evidence, justified) pride.  A great place - we'll be back!", "author": "Dom B."}

I was impressed across the board. We all shared bite, the only way it should be done, and we all liked everything. I had veal tartar to start which was awesome, it was a large portion and seasoned perfectly which is common downfall among tartars. My friends got the ahi (I think) sashimi which was served on a giant salt block. It was excellent as well. I got the chicken which was served with an amazing crawfish and tomato sauce with crawfish tails. AMAZING. Two people got the short ribs and one got the steak.

I've been here twice so far, and the food is quite good, the service mostly so, and the ambiance is pleasant.\n\nOn our first visit, we were seated promptly, but on our second visit, we had to wait for a good 20 minutes beyond our reservation time for our table for four -- yikes. Not so good. Our waiter on our first visit was a man who displayed the essence of professionalism; on our second visit, we were helped by an Italian woman who, while not super-polished, was lively and opinionated and made us chuckle (not necessarily a bad thing). She seemed to know her wine, too. Still, a little less levity, a little more gravity would've been nice.\n\nAppetizers are big, particularly the fritto misto and the grilled calamari, and they're excellent. Mmm, squid. The mixed salumi plate is fun, even if you're not a cured meat aficionado -- I enjoyed tasting the different types of salami, prosciutto, etc. Pastas are top-notch, too, although there's an unfortunate tendency for noodles to clump together. This is somewhat understandable with the tajarin since the noodles are so thin, but it's not excusable with the wide papardelle. Because I like pasta so much and have really enjoyed Perbacco's in particular, I haven't sample much in the way of main-course meats, and I've been too full for dessert as well.\n\nI'll be back -- the food is wonderful. I wouldn't rate this place above Delfina, as I've heard some might, but it's a go-to option. They need to work on de-clumping the admittedly tasty pasta.", "author": "Tara M."}

I also have to say that the one negative I had listed in my previous review is no longer there.  In the previous review, I had mentioned that the lighting was too bright for a dinner experience. Well, not only did I notice that the lighting was 100% better but Umberto, one of the 2 owners of the restaurant spoke to our table and told me that the restaurant's first few weeks had an issue with the dimmers not being installed.  Once the dimmers were installed, the lighting was corrected.\n\nAs for food, last night I had the Burrata Cheese with arugula and black truffle - amazing!  The Beef Short Ribs with Celery Puree - tender and smooth, and a chocolate torte with caramel sauce and hazelnuts - divine.  \n\n10/31/2006We had dinner here 2 days after it opened and it was great.  The food and service was truly well thought out.  Our waiter was attentive and courteous and the food was sublime.  Their wine list is amazing - great Italian section.\n\nWe started with a red wine from the Langhe region of Italy - very good.  For appetizers, we had the Prosciutto san danieli and the crudo viteloni (spelling?).  The crudo (Veal tartar basically) and the prosciutto melted in our mouths.  The we split the sirloin with a reduced sauce made from marrow - it was great.  We ended with the chocolate tart - also very good.\n\nThe only thing that I did not like was the lighting in the place.

My ability to be impressed by Italian fare has been numbed by a handful of extended stays in Italy throughout my life, and consequently I tend to avoid trendy Italian places with high price tags because there are so many ways that my pasta dish can result in an underwhelmed MEH from my palate (I know I sound insufferable; bear with me). So, when I stumbled into Perbacco after a few drinks on a Saturday night, I was not prepared to be astounded- I just wanted to carb load and check out the wine list. JOKE'S ON ME because I was BLOWN AWAY by the gnocchi with chanterelle mushrooms. It was seriously a religious experience. Everybody around me ordered the pappardelle and they were making the same mmMMMMMmmm noises as I was, so I take that as a positive sign. I also sampled the raviora- CRAZY GOOD (pomegranate seeds all up in my pasta, what an unexpected love story!). Service was good, wine was fantastic. My only complaint was that I was not totally into my caramelized white chocolate bar, which I think has more to do with my taste than the actually bar itself.

I was so excited to get an email from a friend regarding Perbacco's exclusively kosher-for-Passover meal for last night. Three of us booked a table and had a lovely evening. Now, anyone who knows about kosher-for-Passover food knows that it's REALLY hard to have a full course, delicious meal. Passover food is just blah, there's no other way to explain it. Perbacco did their very best and worked with what they had to produce a pretty good meal. The night started off with two small pieces of matzoh and a very thick harroset (I feel like there were figs in there...). Then I had artichoke soup (non-dairy based) ---- bland but once I added salt I enjoyed it more. We also shared (family style) grilled eggplant, marinated zucchini and duck liver, 3 of 8 choices. I had the chicken entree; drenched in fresh tomatoes, onions and olives. Super tastey. The entrees were accompanied by grilled fennel, a mashed-potato type side (again, no dairy...) and another lettuce based thing that is escaping me. Finally for dessert we were served (family style) caramelized strawberries (heavenly), a sponge cake (very good) and an almond pudding (not very good as it can't really be pudding without milk...).\n\nThe service was impeccable and the whole staff was very knowledgeable about each dish and choice provided. I was impressed at how Perbacco pulled this off and I am thankful that they catered to the Jewish community on a night that is truly different than all other nights.\n\nThanks, Perbacco!

One of the girls downed her champagne with each glass and kept staring at herself making fish faces in the mirror above the bench seats. That was weird, yet very entertaining.\n\nThe only thing I thought was strange was that they had Miller High Life on the menu and I think it was priced at $5. But for $2 out-the-door of the liquor store, don't buy a High Life at Perbacco.\n\nAll in all, Perbacco has good food/drink, good service, good atmosphere, and interesting people to watch.

Funnily enough, I had my first Perbacco experience last week, and I have to say, I have never been compelled to write any review on yelp for any restaurant- I mainly use yelp as a way to surf the city for new restaurants, not to pretend to be a critic.... however, I had such an amazing experience that I truly felt moved to let everyone know about it!!!! .... That being said, finding\"KIM D\"s review below HAS INFURIATED me into taking a moment to address it:\n\nKim, You are \"confused.\" There is never any excuse to demean anyone with a child. Even if they are loud, or in your eyes, out of line. To each his own. I cannot believe you would fault the restaurant or it's staff for another persons behavior anyway......\n\nBesides- what would the alternative be? To turn families away and have them write scathingly negative reviews about it on yelp??? Perhaps people with children have a little more patience and perspective than you... Perbacco, if you have lost this guest, you have gained one in me!!! So ciao bella, Kim- Please don't procreate.\n\nthat being said.... I sat at the bar, and although crowded, was fun and lively! I was never wanting for anything for the entire time I was there. The bartender- Scott- was proffessional and lovely. He suggested amazing pairings of wine with our meal..... And our meal!!!! Oh!

It took them about 10min to seat us, but once we were seated, everything was great.  \n\nWe had trouble picking out a first wine, since we wanted something Italian, but didn't know too much about Italian wines, but the sommelier was very helpful and picked out a nice light red (Dolcetto d'Alba) that went perfectly with the Salumi plate (and it was cheap too at $35!).  They were also very nice about the bottle of Ledson Sangiovese that we brought, no corkage if you buy a bottle on the list, so we saved a bundle on wine that night!  That means more $$$ for food, which we sure spent.\n\nEverything looked great on the menu, so we went a little crazy and probably over-ordered, especially since the portions were much larger than expected.  We got the chef's choice salumi plate which was awesome...and huge!  Nonetheless, we finished every last bit of meat.  I had a big carb craving so I had the raviolo appetizer AND a pasta dish (agnolottie filled with roasted rabbit).  The rabbit pasta was ok, but I really loved the raviolo, it had such a nice truffle flavor to it, and the truffle butter leaked out once you slice it open...yum!  The other entrees ordered by my dining partners (rabbit, chicken, and steak) were really good as well.\n\nBeing the gluttons that we are, we wound up ordering dessert still even after all that food.  I had a cheese craving as well, so we got 2 choices of the cheese to share, the piedmontese cookies, and the gelato.  I loved the cheese, especially the \"la tur\" soft cheese, which really shined with some honey and almonds.  The cookies were really good as well.  We were so full by the end we could barely finish the cookies and the last bit of cheese (their portions are very generous, 2 people can share a dessert).\n\nWe had a late reservation, so I can see how it could have taken a little while to get seated (maybe the previous party lingered a little too long), but it was nice that we got the table for the rest of the night and we did not feel hurried at all despite taking over 3 hours to eat (we did have 4 courses).  The service was warm and all the servers as well as the sommelier were very friendly.\n\nI would definitely come back again.", "author": "Arlene M."}

After sampling the fare, I have to wonder why.  \nMaybe wifey and I are getting jaded and cynical from eating out too much.  Maybe our expectations are too high.  Maybe we're just whiney snobby  gourmands who like to toot our own horns.  After all, wifey's been on a rage booking us for 2-3 restaurants per week.  This blistering pace has left me exhausted and weary.  At this point, the  only way a restaurant's gonna get a rise outta me is if unicorns serve the meal and buxom strippers dance in the background... that's not weird, is it?\n\nThe food here is pretty straightforward.  I found the entrees fairly standard.  Like others, I think the pastas are worth investigating if you decide to try this place.  Also, the salumi and cured meat samplers are nice.

It's beautiful; big bar, high ceilings, boothes, exposed brick, quiet upstairs dining area, open kitchen area.  It really is an amazing space.  And it's much bigger than I had expected.  I just wan't THAT impressed with the food.  \n\nI enjoyed the beet salad to start with, but its pretty difficult to mess up a basic beet salad.  My boyfriend had the slow roasted veal appetizer and it was nothing like we had expected.  There just wan't any amazing flavor to it.  A very weird combo with the tuna sauce as well.  And it's cold!  Not a favorite whatsoever.  I wouldn't recommend it.  \n\nFor my main entree I had the paparedelle.  I definitely liked the dish, but it wasn't anything special.  It is rare to find a short rib ragu, but nothing really stood out to me.  It tasted like short ribs.   I feel like my boyfriend could have made it for me.  He had duck tortiloni, which again, was nothing special.  Duck being as gamey as it is, really needed something extra flavorful to make taste really good.  It was just ok.  \n\nWe had two veggie sides, the fingerling potatoes and the cornona beans.  The fingerling potatoes were amazing, but thats just because fingerlings are amazing.  The corona beans were alright, but I guess I was really looking for some green beans or broccoli which wasn't an option.  I would have liked to see more \"green\" options for sides. \n  \nOverall the service was great.  Our SERVER was really sweet and had great recommendations.  She paired wine for both of our dishes and was all around very friendly.  The \"manager\"? was quite annoying though.  He gradually walked around the entire upstairs checking in on every table.  I don't know how often he checked on everyone else, but he interrupted our dinner THREE times to ask how everything was, sparked random conversation and made recommendations when we hadn't asked for advise.  I could have gone without him.\n\nI think it would be a really fun spot to go for some after work drinks and apps with some friends and sit down in the bar area.

Are we still in San Francisco?\"  \n\nOkay, onto the food.  \n-Pesce Crudo: Wonderful tastes of Albacore Tuna, Watermelon, Celery, Chili and Cherry Tomatoes.  Squeezing everything into one spoon and devouring it whole, you get a variety of flavors, that pair surprising well together!\n-Carne Cruda: Veal Tartare (I know...poor baby lamb!) quail egg (love quail eggs!) and truffle atop toasted bread.  Oh lord...I think Sexy Hombre had a few moments...I know I did!\n-Agnolotti: My Sexy Hombre may need to translate again what was in it, but I will say that it is A MUST!  So much flavor coming out of such a little pocket of pasta!   \n-Parppardelle: With Quail Ragu and teeny tiny little mushrooms...It was good, but the Agnolotti shoved it aside and took first place on my palatte!  \n\nNow, on to my favorite!

I don't know if I've ever had Chocolate Gelato THAT good!  The cute server, originally from Boston (love him!), told us about the rarity of the chocolate...I can see why.  Oh, don't let me forget to tell you about the Toffee.  Be careful, it will stick to your teeth, but let it marinate in your mouth to form a caramel consistency.

Finally made it to dinner at Perbacco last night after wanting to go there for quite some time, and after hearing all the rave reviews.\n\nUpon arrival, I was partially turned off immediately because of the crowd. There was a crowd out front, a crowd around the reception desk, and a crowd in the bar. I opened the door, got a rush of hot air, the loud boom of a few hundred people talking in an echo-y room, then fought my way to the reception desk to check in for my reservation (this is 6pm on a Thursday).\n\nThroughout the time I was there, the staff were all very nice and professional despite the stress of having a packed restaurant. The receptionist smiled and had her act together, the waiter was attentive and gave great suggestions, and everyone thanks you on the way out. No complaints over service.\n\nThe food was equally good. We started off with the chef's selection of Salami - and it was actually a very impressive spread of cured meats (all done in-house so they say). We also ordered the Red & Gold Beat salad which was fresh, and the Hamachi which was equally as fresh (but I am spoiled by being able to get fresh Hamachi anywhere in SF practically). For dinner I had the duck and it was cooked to perfection - very good. She had the Butternut Squash Lune, a little heavy on the butter but fresh and delicious. Desert - we ordered the Pistachio cake and it was soft and decadent.\n\nSO WHY 3 STARS CRAIG?\nThe problem is the NOISE LEVEL. It is loud. I could barely carry on a conversation without shouting. I found myself rushing through the meal so I could get outside and out of the noise. I've come to Perbacco before for drinks, but now I am thinking that the inviting bar scene is a real dis-service to the restaurant scene.

We also shared the salumi misti plate and the portions were very generous, and also had the local anchovy crudo, which was nice and briny but not too salty.  We also brought our own wine and ordered a bottle off the regular menu.  The sommalier was great, they were not snooty or condescending, which can sometimes happen when you bring your own wine (it helped I think that the wine we brought was unusual and not normally available to restaurants).  My hubby ordered the rabbit, which meh, I am not a fan of game, so I didn't taste it.  Apparently it was good, but I\"ll take his word for it.  I had the roasted chicken w/c was absolutely luscious.  It was juicy and flavorful.  Yum.  I loved how attentive the service was, not too pushy and hovering, but always there whenever you needed them.\n\nLast Friday, I went back w/ my girl friends, one of whom was desperately craving good prosciutto.  We tried to order the prosciutto, but apparently the restaurant was all out.  We were extremely upset, since the whole point of going to Perbacco was to get prosciutto.  Happily, the manager managed to find us some prosciutto (despite their earlier protestations) and we were able to eat our fill.  We also shared the salumi plate and a bottle of wine.  We were looking for a particular type of wine - medium and full bodied, tannins, not too fruity and the sommalier let us taste a number of different bottles before we settled on one.  Service was realy top notch, IMO.  It probably helped that we were four cute young gals.\n\nWell, that's it, I LOVE Perbacco.  I give four stars for the food and the eminently reasonable prices, but an extra star for the service beyond the call of duty.", "author": "Leah S."}

For my recent 27th, my foodie Father suggested we make a reservation at Perbacco, having himself had a great meal there prior. I hesitantly agreed but was soon thereafter reminded that way way back as a teeny tyke,  I professed to my parents that \"it's so important to sample new products\" which actually stuck as my motto. In this case, Perbacco stood as the \"new product\" and I'm pleased to report, I'm quite glad I tried it. From a vast and pleasing wine-list to delicious appetizers, entrees and great service, Perbacco proved to be not only a satisfying alternative to my usual birthday spot, but a delicious Italian restaurant worth coming back. \n\nAs someone with dietary restrictions (gluten, no soy, spicy, fatty, creamy foods, limited dairy, no acidic, etc), eating out poses challenges that often a restaurant is not equipped to deal with. In this case, I bashfully explained to our server my particular restrictions and was pleasantly surprised at how immediately accommodating he was. To me, that set the tone for the meal and I knew I'd be able to fully enjoy my choices without feeling the need to settle. He pointed out menu selections that included wheat and even options I might want to avoid just in case. When our barrata and heirlume tomato appetizer came to the table topped with breadcrumbs he-apologetically-asked if I'd like my own small slice sans breadcrumbs. I, not wanting to be a hassle, declined but after insistence from my father and the waiter, gratefully obliged. Good move as I absolutely loved the fresh cheese and tomatoes, paired in perfect harmony. With my taste buds delightfully ignited I eagerly awaited the arrival of my main course. \n\nI consider myself a healthy eater, food-intolerance's aside, but every now and then I get a craving that I must satisfy. When my craving focuses on meat, or in this case, pork, nothing else will do and my mindset is to go big or don't bother. As this was my birthday and my pork craving on an all-time high, I found my perfect match in Perbacco's \"porchetta\" entree. All I can say is HOLY PORCHETTA. It was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender rather than swallowed in fat as is oven the case especially with a technique of pork using the belly. Personally, as much as I love meat I can't handle the texture of fatty cuts nor can my stomach digest them. So, I was incredibly pleased to be able to truly enjoy pork with the texture and flavor components I prefer in line. Finally, dessert of sorbet left a refreshing finishing touch to a great meal.  \n\nI would most definitely return to Perbacco", "author": "Lisa H."}

We ordered the squid appetizer, salumi plate, tajarin (tagliatelle with 5 hour pork sugo), and salted caramel ice cream/raspberry sorbet for dessert.\n\nThe squid and salumi were good, but really nothing special.  The pasta was beautifully hand-cut and tasted good, but again, not amazing.  The meal was quite heavy also.  Nothing particularly subtle about any of it.  \n\nThe service was also surprisingly bad, given that this is an upscale joint.  We ordered an Arnold Palmer that didn't come until the end of the meal.  And when I asked for my leftover pasta to go, they took it away and forgot to bring it back to me.  I had to get their attention and ask for it after we had already paid.  \n\nThe food was good enough to return if this were a modestly priced restaurant.

For desert I really enjoyed the salted carmel ice cream.  Hence the two star review - good service, good soup, great ice cream, and minus three stars for the worst pasta dish ever served at a restaurant.

It was just an early dinner with a friend so we actually only ordered drinks and a pasta dish each. Service was excellent, from the hostess to all the waitstaff. I know we weren't a big bill, but it was a Monday night so I didn't feel too bad, but even as we stayed chatting, they kept filling up our water and weren't rushing us out at all.\n\nThe breadsticks, as well as the bread they serve are tasty. I had their cucumber drink with vodka instead of gin and it was good. I went with the octopus and squid ink pasta with bone marrow, hoping it would be like a similar dish that Marea in NYC is famous for and while it wasn't really the same, this one was still very good. One complaint though, it was very salty, I couldn't drink enough water during and after dinner. My friend got the papparadelle with braised short ribs and she really liked it to.\n\nThe other complaint I have about this place, and yes, I realize we're in the Financial, but the dinner size pasta servings aren't very big. I'm not expecting North Beach family style Italian, but still, the portions are definitely on the small side, especially when you're spending $18 on pasta.\n\nThe cheese selection looked great but we passed, I couldn't think about having anymore salt after my salty dish.

She said she could give me a little scoop of each for $7. Great. She comes back with 5 scoops of gelato and said \"oh the chef misunderstood me and they gave you a scoop of each in the freezer.\" Then she charged me $12. Who does that? At least the gelati were awesome--the burnt caramel with salt was one of the best things I've ever tasted. The espresso had chunks of fudge, the lemon was super bright and sour.

Combining historical elements (original brick wall dating from around 1914) with sleek, modern lines the ambience is both comfortable and appealing.  \n\nPrices are reasonable for the Bay Area with small plates (half orders) and most appetizers in the $10-14 range.  It's nice to go with friends who enjoy sampling several dishes and ordering several half orders that can be shared.  \n\nI started with a Rosmarino cocktail ($9) of Grey Goose vodka with lemon, rosemary simple syrup and apple brandy - sweet but good, served with a sprig of rosemary.  Consult with their Italian sommelier who knows his stuff and can assist you in selecting a wine to pair with your meal.  \n\nWe started out with a half order of the Salumni Misti ($18) which featured a variety of cured meats including mortadella and fennel salame.  We also sampled half orders of the Butternut Squash Mezzelune ($9) - delicious with sage browned butter and Castelmagno cheese - and the Tajarin ($10) handcut tagliatelle pasta with pork sugo and porcini mushrooms - very succulent and smooth with a orange zest addition which worked very well with this dish. \n\nEntrees for the most part are in the $20-29 range.   My party selected the Beef Short Ribs ($21) with celery root puree, and the Pork Shoulder ($19) with savoy cabbage and polenta.  I had the Pork with was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it.  The flavor was good and the cabbage paired well with the meat.  Sadly, the polenta had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  Considering the soupy texture and bland taste - this side was very disappointing.  \n\nThe chocolate tart ($8) and the trio of gelato ($7) - hazelnut, bitter-sweet chocolate, and pistachio were the perfect ending to a delightful meal.  \n\nA few added notes -  portion sizes were a bit small so be aware.  Service could have been faster, but due mainly to the kitchen and not the servers themselves who were quite attentive.  \n\nThe acoustics of the warm and inviting interior when filled with people can make it challenging to hear your own conversation.  Ask for the 2nd level dining area, if available, or a table near the back where it may be more quiet.  \n\nParking may be a bit of a hassle in this area - Perbacco is next to the Tadich Grill and near Aqua - so either be open to walking a distance or go with the valet which is available.  \n\nFinally, the restrooms, which leave a little to be desired, are on the basement level.

Wow. \n\nThe food was excellent. The server, Michael, superb. He even got us a taxi at the end of the night! The wine delicious. And the bill, as someone else noted, not as bad as I imagined. It is pricey if you do it right but for a downtown restaurant, I felt there was a lot of value. \n\nWe can't wait to return!", "author": "Danielle L."}

I took a chance on this new restaurant for a birthday dinner I was hosting. My four guests and I arrived a bit on the early side. While it was a bit noisy, we were escorted to a seating area near the bar where we were served a few delicious cocktails. While we caught up over drinks, I had a chance to notice the surroundings. The bar is complete with a real old-fashioned meat slicer - available to slice the fresh Italian prosciutto, salamis, etc.. We were shown to our seats and I immediately got into the spirit by ordering a bottle of the Drusian Prosecco and the 'salumi misti' (an assortment of the cured meats).\n\nWhile we waited we munched on some deliciously thin and perfectly salted breadsticks which came with a pesto paste for dipping. For our mains, we ordered pasta, fish, and the short ribs as well as a number of the vegetable sides. Everything was delicious.\n\nDessert left a bit to be desired. I really enjoyed the chocolate tart, but not so much the lemon tart.\n\nOverall, the service was enthusiastic but not overwhelming, the atmosphere was cheerful (although a bit loud) and the food was wonderful! I recommend Perbacco the next time you're looking for a special Italian night out!", "author": "Deborah S."}

Slightly industrial, minimalist looking. The men are wearing jackets, and the women are wearing black.  \n\nThis is the \"power lunch\" or \"power dinner\" kind of restaurant. I have no doubt that the group of stern looking men sitting next of us were discussing the possible merger of their 2 companies. \n\nThe food is delicious. I did not get to order off the menu because we were guests of a very generous, philanthropic San Franciscan. In other words, I ate for free. And such an enjoyable meal it was.\n\nI had the fritto misto (delicious), and the pear salad (good if you like sweet salads like Waldorf). I also had the duck with a copious side of brussel sprouts. This is just really good, high-quality Americana on a plate.\n\nCocktails are strong. The occassion demanded a dirty martini. It goes without saying that the rest of the night is a blur.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-17", "description": "Perbacco is a sleek and cool Italian restaurant in San Francisco's Financial District, focusing on the flavor of Italy's Piemonte and Ligurian regions, with a tinge of French and Provencal tastes. With all these diverse influences, Perbacco puts up a long and interesting menu, featuring house made salume selections, a crudo list, and a selection of interesting hand-made pastas. I always appreciate a long-ass and interesting menu, and Perbacco doesn't disappoint.\n\n\n\nI am exceedingly fond of our West coast sardines so I couldn't resist sampling the house cured local sardines with salsa verde, celery heart, and marinated egg yolk ($7.00). These were served chilled and had a pronounced and distinctly sardine flavor: you love it or you do not, there is little in between. I found the egg yolks played nicely off the oily fish-ness of the sardines, and the salsa verde gave things a nice herbal flavor.\n\n\n\nNext was the roasted red and gold beets with arugula, Castelmagno cheese, and white balsamic vinaigrette ($10.00). This was a simple but successful salad, melding two different varieties of meaty and slightly fruity beets with the peppery bite of arugula and the earthy flavor of a good strong cheese. I have had variants of this dish all over the place in California and this was a pretty worthy (and nicely sized) rendition - and a very attractive presentation to boot.\n\n\n\nWe flipped for the handcut tagliatelle with 5 hour pork sugo, porcini mushrooms ($16.00 entree size, $11.00 appetizer sized). Perbacco prides itself on its freshly made pasta, and this dish backs all tha talk up: the fresh and tender tagliatelle went perfectly with the rich and meaty sugo, which had a delightfully earthy flavor derived from porcini mushrooms. My mother enjoyed this so much that she had it for an appetizer and an entree, and I suppose that is a fitting testimonial.\n\n\n\nMy dad went for the Coniglio al civet with Devil's Gulch rabbit, spiced red wine sauce, otto file polenta, and crispy pancetta. This was a face-foward and distinctly wine flavored dish, and the combination of slightly gamey rabbit, powerfully flavored sauce, and crispy, porky pancetta was a successful one. I wish rabbit found its way onto more menus, Thumper-related sentiments be damned.\n\n\n\nI selected the special Ligurian fish stew with lobster broth, mussels, fish, scallops, shrimp, and mussels. The meaty and decadent broth was spiced lightly with saffron and had a piquant flash of tomato: it reminded me rather of a highly refined cioppino. The seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked, bypassing seafood stew's common issues with overcooked and rubbery shellfish. It's a light dish, almost too elegant: I would have liked a bit more of that delicious broth.\n\n\n\nThe sleeper hit of the evening were the side of brown butter brussels sprouts with capers and parmigiano reggiano ($5.00). These charmers flavored the falling-apart tender sprouts with a powerful hit of capers, rich brown butter, and distinctly stinky parmigiano. The overall flavor was that of a decadently rich and interesting casserole, and these were pretty impossible to risk - although the actual flavor of the sprouts was a secondary player here.\n\nFor the dessert course, we tried the pistachio panna cotta ($8.00), a straight forward and satisfyingly firm pudding with a nutty, slightly perfumed pistachio flavor. This was not a fancy dish, but it was a good ending to a rich meal.\n\n\n\nWe finished with a cheese plate, picking from Perbacco's nice selection of artisan cheeses. We settled on Bianco Sotto Bosco, a cow and goat milk cheese infused with truffles, and Caprino Di Riofrano, goat's milk cheese wrapped in chestnut leaf. ($12.00 for selection of two). I am no cheese critic, but both cheeses were earthy and tasty (and it is very hard to make truffled cheese bad.)\n\nPerbacco's dining room is very sleek and contemporary, and those expecting some sort of homey regional Italian experience will be disappointed. The place has the appearance of a restaurant tailor-made for power lunches and important networking dinners: in other words, don't come expecting a romantic environment or overwrought opera music on the sound system. The beautiful people are served by what seemed to be an engaging and well trained waitstaff: our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and our food came out with impressive speed and timing.\n\nWe will certainly return to Perbacco soon. It's excellent and interesting regional Italian dining at surprisingly regional prices - there really isn't much not to love.", "author": "faine g."}

I walked in here on a Friday night and was told that a table would be available in two hours.  My friend managed to charm an immediate table.\n\nA friend and I were arguing about whether this would be a good date restaurant and he thought no while I thought yes.  He apparently preferred a more chez papa type restaurant, quiet and intimate, while i thought this might provide a good atmosphere for an unknown date.  It was loud, but you cold drown out the din of talkers if you really wanted to.  If not, there was some good people watching.\n\nThat said, the food was pretty good.  The menu was extensive, with different selections of meat and pasta,  We had the sea bass, the halibut and the duck with grilled peaches.  Appetizers were the octopus and watermelon salad.  The watermelon salad was decent but not the best i have had.  I recommend trying it yourself.  Watermelon with vinegarette and watercress.  i didn't taste the caviar in the watermelon salad but it was there.  The sea bass was ok, it had a faint taste of scrambled eggs which I couldn't quite place.  The halibut was nice, but had a tasteless affect.  The best and most orginal dish in our party was the duck with roasted peaches, a nice combiantion that went well with a white wine that had peach notes.\n\nWe ordered from the wine list by the glass, which comprised primarily Italian wines which were very well selected.  Every wine that we sampled, from light red, to more fruity full bodied red, to fruity white, was solid.  Go here for a solid introduction to Italian wines.  Will not disappoint.  The accompanying food will suffice but will be a mere complement to the extensive wine selection.", "author": "apple r."}

I like the fact that a Swede can outdo an Italian in their cuisine- I think the challenge makes him a better innovative chef. However, the pastas were not impressive at all. We ate at Farina which was far more overpriced, but almost worth it because the pasta was so fresh and melting in your mouth... They are good with meats here. Not so much pasta plates.

I mean, the former is one of the premier restaurants in the City, and the other one ... umm ... has been in business since 1849.   It's an interesting location choice, especially given that the decor suggests more of a SoMa location.  Exposed brick, stainless steel, and art deco inspired logo reminded me of my dot com days.\n\nIt's not your grandma's Italian restaurant.  Instead of focaccia bread and olive oil, you have gourmet breadsticks and pesto dip; instead of generic plates and silverware, you have elegant table settings; instead of spaghetti with meatballs, you have something more gourmet; instead of uncle Mario who is also the host and a short order cook, you have a knowledgeable, pleasant waiter.\n\nI started with a gold and red beets salad with greens and vinaigrette dressing.  Beets are beets, but I liked the presentation.  I only ordered beets because my dinner companion ordered the arugula salad that I really wanted.  Don't blame me for wanting to be original.\n\nThen my entree came.  I opted for the risotto with veal.  The risotto was delicious, and veal was very tender.  Granted, my plate only had two tiny medallions of veal, carefully and delicately placed in the middle of the plate, but they were really, really good.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the pear and almond tart served with Creme Anglaise.  The tart was very rich, and the almond paste was fantastic.  Creme Anglaise was a bit too tart for my taste (no pun intended).  It tasted a bit like sour cream and custard mixed together and left in the sun for a couple of days.  Not my favorite item.  My dinner companion, however, opted for a chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream, which was clearly a better choice.  \n\nOh, and don't forget to order the espresso.  The tiny cup alone is worth the money.  You can feel very European drinking the espresso, or you can feel like a giant just holding a tiny cup.\n\nOverall, Perbacco is a welcome addition to the San Francisco landscape.  I would gladly go back if I am ever in the mood for an upscale Italian meal in a quiet setting.  I think Perbacco is great for both closing the deal with a big client and for a romantic dinner with that special someone.", "author": "Yan G."}

Seated promptly, drinks and bread brought quickly.  The breadsticks were deliciously crispy and served with a little ramekin of pesto.  I didn't try the foccacia that was also brought to the table - look kinda doughy.  We ordered right away since we had gotten word that it takes about 45 minutes to receive your food, and being on our lunch hour didn't have that much time to spare\n\nI got the Ligurian tuna salad and my companion got the tortellini and English peas.  The food was brought really fast - almost too fast!  My salad was so pretty to look at - little nicoise olives scattered around the plate along with tiny tiny little green string beans, cherry tomatoes, capers and some hard boiled quail eggs.  Unfortunately, the tuna was way overcooked and had the consistency of chicken of the sea, and there were eggshells on my plate from the hard boiled eggs.  Not quite what I was expecting.  Still, it was kind of good due to the wonderful dressing.  Ron's tortellini were kind of a dull - even the presentation was dull.\n\nThe place is pretty cool, and if you've ever eaten at it's predecessor, the Gold Coast, you would never recognize it.  They've preserved the long wooden bar and brick walls, but that's about it.  Lots of light wood paneling, thin strips of mirrors at eye level that really open up the room, and fabulous lighting.  I am a stickler for good linens and cutlery,ery, and Perbacco gets an A on that level.\n\nAll in all, it was sort of OK - but not for the price.  I think I may  try again for dinner with a group of people so we can really sample the menu.\n\nAnd it was TOO DAMN LOUD!", "author": ".Hon H."}

I won't go into any detail about the aesthetics other than to say that the place was visually appealing and very comfortable with plenty of space between tables.  \n\nThe service was very pleasant and we had a great waiter who always kept our glasses full.  There was a rather long lull between courses but probably a result of the kitchen and not the waiter.  Our server had great suggestions which we found to be very reliable.\n\nThe menu, printed daily, is very complete with something for virtually any palate.  I highly recommend the house cured salami's - while plenty to share between 2 people these meats are so good you'll probably need a second serving.\n\nFor our second course we shared the Tajarin which was unbelievable and it was clear why this was the waiters recommendation.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the Pork Sugo w/Porcini was very rich.\n\nFor the entrees my wife had the Sea Bass which was good but unmemorable.  I had the Pork Chop w/Pomegranate condimento which was fantastic.  This was really a great entree which seemed to be the most popular choice that evening.\n\nDessert was also great.  I had a pear bread pudding which was perfectly done.  My wife had the parmigiano reggiano which was some of the best we've ever had.\n\nWe highly recommend Perbacco.

Our server knew the menu.  When my friend wanted wine, she was immediately tended to.  \nWe shared Piasta Seared Local Squid and Frito Misto Rock Shrimp.

Still, Perbacco comes dangerously close to the overpriced/under-impressive touristy feel that befalls downtown restaurants. Everything about Perbacco was good, but nothing about it was really great. \n\nI arrived early for my early meal (5:45 pm), and was seated in a rather unfavorable seat right under the Muzak speaker. When I asked to be moved shortly thereafter, the hostess became irritated and said the more attractive section I was pointing to was \"reserved for those with reservations,\" as if to say I didn't have one. (I did.) Still, I was moved to a slightly quieter--if more claustrophobic table--further in the back. It wasn't like they were really hurting for seats--this two-level place is rather large, despite its modest facade. But whatever. At least I could dine without K.T. Tunstall blaring in my ears.\n\nThe food arrived promptly and with a competent pacing. The introductory bread sticks we received were strangely greasy, although tasty. We opted to try the house-cured prosciutto, which was delicious, especially when paired with the bread sticks. I started with the sugo pasta (nice that they offer their pastas as small or large portions, btw). Was very good, but definitely not the best I'd ever had. The entrees that followed were equally tasty... and good, but not great. My seared tuna was a generous cut of fish, but sort of bland. My friend seemed a lot happier with his skate wing. Desserts came to nearly $10 apiece, and considering the non-stellar-ness of everything thus far, it was enough to make me decide that tuna and sugo had filled me up.\n\nConsidering our tab came out to nearly $100 apiece (including a cocktail and half-bottle of wine), I'd probably save Perbacco for out-of-towners on an expense account.

We got neither.  \n\nWe shared a few appetizers....salume, bacala fritters, tempura veg and seafood, etc.  I believe the meats are house cured and they we're pretty good, but i really wanted some cheese or fruit to cut through the fat. Don't get me wrong, its was good, but just like melon will make procuitto even better, I was looking for a combo to accentuate the cuts.  Instead it was grissini or baguette slices.  Okay, but cmon....its was a pretty expensive plate of cold cuts.  The bacala was a bit mushy and seemed like it sat in the window too long or the steam just took out all the crispiness.

I was the first of my party to arrive at Perbacco and headed to the bar for a glass of wine.  Seats were not available at the bar, somehow I managed to hang on to the wine in front of the doorway awkwardly until dinner time.  It was amazingly busy for a Tuesday night.  We had reservations for 8:00 pm and weren't seated until 8:30, but redemption was earned by a complementary platter of salumi misto and an explanation from whom I assumed to be the gm of the place.  The salumi misto was terrific ( I would have ordered it anyway).  It instantly made me feel better.\n\nThe place was sleet with some exposed brick.  The front of the restaurant was rather narrow.  As you walk through the front door, you would never expect that it opens up to large dining area in the back.  I don't remember if the restaurant had white marble/stone walls, but as you enter the lower level to the restrooms, the walls were in white stone.\n\nThe food was decent.  My favorite, as you may have guessed, is the salumi.  My second favorite was the breadsticks with the pesto sauce.  We ordered the hamachi - big mistake - perhaps sushi at an Italian restaurant is not the most brilliant idea - it was on the fishy side.  My pork shoulder was good, but a little on the dry side and Hubby's sirloin  was slathered with blue cheese - which he thought was a pity -- good meat should not be covered with heavy cheese flavoring!\n\nThe wine list was predominantly Italy.  It was a great opportunity to try Italian wines in preparation for Hubby and my upcoming trip to Italy.\n\nMy recommendation would be to go there for drinks and appetizers (salumi).  Dinner would be okay - just because they try hard and the food is decent and the staff are genuinely nice.", "author": "Uimuim B."}

Sleek interior, attentive and fast service.\n\nI judge the service by requesting a slice of lime for my sparkling water.  If they forget, that's bad.  If I have ask twice, that's questionable.  At Perbacco, I got my lime right after I asked.  So points for that!\n\nMost of us had the Organic Peach salad with arugula and almonds.  Nice pairing of juicy Peaches and crunchy almonds.  I decided to have the sole for entree which the waiter chose when I asked what he would recommend between the sole, swordfish and the duck.  It came in a big portion.  The sweet corn from the sole dish was very delicious.  Fish was well done, juicy, not too cooked.  But nothing special for a $20 dish. \n\nDesserts looked very pretty.  I didn't have any but everyone else seems to like theirs.  I had a cup of organic English Breakfast instead and that was satisfying to me. \n\nI am surprised that people liked the bread sticks there.  I thought they were very ordinary (I like bread sticks from Hog Island, actually).  \n\nOverall, I enjoyed it as a free lunch.  But if I had to pay for it myself, I would've gone somewhere else.

My husband and I went here for my b-day dinner. We had heard many great things about the place, plus we have a friend of a friend who used to work here, so we were looking forward to a nice b-day dinner. We went on a Tuesday night, 9p.m. reso, and it was bustling when we got there. We were seated in the section in the back with a very low ceiling, with tables very close to one another, but it was a pretty space. Our server came and got our drink order, and asked us if we wanted tap or sparkling water, to which we requested a bottle of sparkling. Five minutes later, somebody tried to drop off glasses of tap water, and we had to tell him that we had asked for sparkling. We got our sparkling water and cocktails a while later. When we ordered our food, we specifically told our server that we were worried that we were ordering a little too much food, but she told us that although we were ordering a lot of food, she thought it wasn't a crazy amount, so we should be able to manage. (We ordered an octopus and beef tongue app, arugula and strawberry salad, spaghetti with pork ragu, rabbit entree for my husband, and fish for me.) Anyways, while we're waiting for our appetizers, the table next to us starts eating (they were seated after us and ordered after us). A long while later, our server came up to our table and asked us if we had gotten any of our food -- not a good sign. We told her no, we hadn't gotten anything yet, and she mumbled something about it being a \"long night\" for her (which is something I never to say to my customers unless the customer is a super regular). Anyways, some time later we got our apps, which were delicious. After those get bussed, we waited for another long while for the pasta. When the pasta finally arrived, our server also droped off the raviolo dish as a sorry-for-the-wait gesture, which was nice, but it was an odd choice of making amends since we were already worried that we had ordered too much. (I think the more practical thing to do would've been to comp our cocktails or give us a dessert at the end of the meal.) Pastas were delicious, again. However, after the pasta plates got bussed, we waited for a very long time yet again for our entrees.  By this time, the place was starting to look like it was closing up. The customers next to us, who were sat after us, were paying their bill. (On a side note, I saw that when they ordered a bottle of wine, the server brought out a bottle that was already opened, and poured a taste for the gentleman. I thought bottles are supposed to be opened at the table.)\nThe rest of the meal was a disaster. The food was really good, and we ate it, but since everything took so long to come out, by the time we were done with our entrees, we were the last table in our section. Our server brought out dessert menus, and while I was in the ladies' room, came up and asked my husband if we were having dessert in a slightly impatient tone of voice. We chose not to get dessert even though I was looking forward to a b-day candle dessert. My parents overseas had wanted to pay for the meal, but we decided we couldn't let them pay since it was such an unpleasant experience, so ended up paying for it ourselves. As soon as we signed the credit card slip, the server whisked the checkbook away like she couldn't wait to get her hands on it. There were no more apologies for the insanely long wait. And the worst part of it all is that we left an 18% tip after all that because I work at a restaurant myself, so anything less than 20% is a bad tip from me. Looking back, though, the tip should've honestly reflected our feelings about the service.", "author": "Y. M."}

If you're in a wine kind of mood, there are many good picks.  \n\nLess formal than Aqua, less stuffy than Tadich, but more posh than beer and meatballs at Harrington's or Schroeder's around the corner, you can't go wrong with Perbacco.", "author": "Marina Maven C."}

Service was spot on but friendly enough that it didn't seem overly formal. We were fully ready to order quite a bit more than we did but our server suggested we share due to portion size. The charcuterie selection was excellent, much more focused on raw sausages and pates than cured meats, which was a nice change. Our server was right, the portions were large and we were able to share a an appetizer and a main after the large salumi selection. The wine list is fairly large and our server gave us excellent direction on glasses and then a bottle. Our only difficulty with the evening came when it was time to try to get a cab at the end of the night and basically none were to be found in the fairly empty financial district.

My other friend had the duck risotto and it was very rich and heavenly. There was  a lot of duck meat in it too.\n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate tart and squash crostata. The chocolate tart was pretty good. The crust was very flaky and it was filled with a thin layer of caramel and the chocolate was very smooth and almost pudding like. It came with a large scoop of whipped cream and sprinkles of hazelnuts. My favorite of the desserts was the squash crostata. When I first read the description, I was very intrigued by the use of squash in a dessert. Since I love being adventurous, I decided to give it a try. I'm SO glad I did! It looked like a piece of pie, but the crust was made more flaky and the filling was sweet squash. It also came with a side of pumpkin ice cream.

But the stuff that looked best was in the apps and pastas, so we just made a meal of those.\n- I wanted a quiet table but there was a private party upstairs so I couldn't get a table up there : (\n- But downstairs wasn't too bad after all\n- Service was a tad snooty but our server was very well-informed\n- I don't drink, and our server seemed to sort of write us off when it appeared we wouldn't be having cocktails or wine.\n- There were inexcusable delays between courses. Dinner took nearly 3 hours and this isn't a 3-hour-dinner kinda place. They blamed the private party, but I'm paying for a table and the excuses don't matter to me. (To their credit, they did offer an additional free dessert to apologize for the slowness, but I'd rather have just gotten out of there 60 min. sooner.\n\nNow the good stuff: the food.\n\n- Beet salad: delicious (although we've all had this elsewhere)\n- Smoked goose breast salad. Nice. Really intense shaved goose breast - a lot like proscuitto, like nothing I'd ever tasted before\n- Ricotta ravioli with asparagus: exactly what is sounds like, and done to perfection. Tasted like spring in a bowl\n- Sunchoke pasta w/ mushrooms: intense, sweet, earthy and unexpected\n- Pappardelle with lamb: perfectly done pasta, tender braised meat, a sauce you could cry over\n- Agnolotti with bone marrow: they explode in your mouth like shanghai soup dumplings but it's intense rich marrow. Served with braised beef cheeks. Talk about gilding the lily...\n\nDesserts:\n- Rhubarb Sorbetto: oddly giant portion, quite tart, texture could have been smoother, I'd have liked more of the strawberry garnish. Cookies were insanely good.\n- Panna Cotta with Bergamot: not nearly sweet enough for my taste. A very \"sophisticated\" dessert, but I've never been into the not-sweet-gotta-put-herbs-in-desserts movement that everyone's doing these days.\n\nValue: Better than I expected for what we ordered, the amount of food, and the level of classiness.\n\nExtra points for not tacking on that B.S. health \"tax\" on the check but doing what all restaurants should do - just incorporate it in the prices.\n\nBottom line: If you like really really good pastas and you're looking for some interesting (and presumably authentic) regional Italian dishes, this is a great spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-16", "description": "Having thoroughly enjoyed my  lunch at Barbacco it was time to move on to the main event . . . dinner at Perbacco.\n\nEverything unrelated to the flavor of the food was pristine at Perbacco.  Service was excellent.  My fianc\u00e9e and I arrived a bit early for our reservation and the host informed us that we could be seated immediately or we could have a drink at the bar and then go to our table whenever we were ready.  We choose the latter option and enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar.  Sadly, the \"by the glass\" wine list was a bit lacking not offering as many choices as you would expect from a place like Perbacco.  Once ready to dine, we were promptly seated at our table.  The staff was very accommodating - and there was no delay in getting our table because we choose to have a drink first.\n\nTo begin, we shared the roasted octopus (a favorite of mine that I order every time I see it on a menu) and the burrata with asparagus.  (For my lone follower, the octopus was good (cooked well) but not nearly as good as at Bottega.  It was far better than Kokkari's, however.)  Despite its proper preparation, the octopus lacked flavor and was overpowered by the lemon flavor of the grilled scallions (lemon that was already added to the dish in the kitchen).  The burrata was good but overall the dish was nothing special as the asparagus lacked flavor (definitely needed salt).  We ended the appetizer portion of our meal wishing that it had more punch . . . more flavor . . . but perhaps that's just our palate preference.\n\nFor an entree, my fiancee and I got the trio of pasta.  Perbacco has a very cool option where for $18 per person, the entire table can try three different pastas (risotto does not count as pasta for this purpose).  We tried: (1) the tagliatelle with 5 hour pork sugo and porcini mushrooms; (2) the tortelli filled with wild nettles and toped with toasted hazelnuts; and (3) the gnocchi with duck ragu and chanterelles.  Out of the three, the gnocchi was by far the best.  The other two pastas, while cooked beautifully, lacked flavor.  The sauce accompanying the tortelli wasn't flavorful enough to cancel out the earthiness of the nettles (which, if you had nettles before, has a strong weed (think pests in your garden not the medicinal herb)  like flavor).  As for the tagliatelle, it needed some heat . . . some flavor to make it sing . . . however, in lacking that flavor dimension, it was fairly standard pasta with a braised meat sauce.  Good . . . but something numerous other Italian restaurants with far less cache offer up.    \n\nFor dessert we got the chocolate gilato with espresso cookies.  It was good but exactly what you would expect it to be.  It is the same chocolate gilato you've had at many other places.  \n\nSo, as you can see, I don't have anything scathing to say about Perbacco.  The ambiance, service, and execution of the food was exceptional.  The flavor, however, was lacking and that's what dropped the restaurant down a star for me.  The flavor of the food is what makes a restaurant stand out and Perbacco lacked that essential element.  Thus, for me, Perbaccao has been lowered to the level of just another good Italian restaurant in SF that doesn't do anything different or note-worthy.", "author": "Oski B."}

I just read the book \"Heat\" (Bill Buford, about Mario Batali and Italian food) so I was craving Italian. Perbacco specializes in Italian food from Piemonte and Liguria...I think it's the same region of Batali's expertise.....cured meats, amazing stuffed pastas, unadulterated seafood (they have a crudo selection), and braised meat sauces.\n\nThere's not much to say, really, except that I recommend Perbacco. It was very delicious, well prepared food served without pretension. Easy parking on the week-end is a big plus. Nice room, nice art on the walls. Just plain delish. I also recommend the book \"Heat\". You will crave this kind of food after reading it, and since going to Babbo is not an option here, try Perbacco.", "author": "Neile R."}

Our server hit the perfect balance, setting a warm tone without ever being intrusive or elusive - and his recommendations and wine pairings were spot on.\n\nWe decided to go with 3 courses, and started with seasonal fare, the poached asparagus with 63 degree C egg and Reggiano Parmesan crema was a wonderful way to enjoy fresh \"grass\", and the salad mixing local stawberries, spring onion, argula, ricotta salata and condimento balsamico was nicely balanced.  \n\nWe followed with two different pastas (the offer half portions so you can enjoy them as a course or as a meal) - my wife enjoyed the Truffle-Herb Ricotta Gnocchi with roasted wild mushrooms and Parmigiano Reggiano - light pillows of wonderful flavor - and I was blown away by the rich yet light  Herb Angolotti filled with Roasted Rabbit in a truffled sugo d'arrosto - the chef again hit a perfect balance between rich flavor and lightness.\n\nFor our main courses, I savored every bite to the Piatto Norcino - featuring 4 distinct and perfectly spiced sausages over a bed of lentils with seasonal greens. A simple plate of peasant food, with flavors a noble would love - a wonderful dish.  My wife found the Coniglio al Civet - with 3 treatments of Devil's Gulch rabbit, a wonderful choice, The belly portion was  \"rabbit bacon\" and offered  crispy, flavorful goodness, complemented by generous portions of a braised leg over polenta,\n\nFor dessert, the seasonal Strawberry Semolina Cake and Goat Cheese Sorbet - yes, goat cheese, and yes it worked bee-you-tee-fully! - was a great finsh to the night.\n\nFor each course, I asked our waiter to offer wine pairings, and each Italian wine complemented the course perfectly at ~$10-$14 per glass.

The service was fairly good, though there were a few things that stood out.  First, I appreciate the fact that restaurants will decant wine for guests when appropriate, but for some reason Perbacco decided to buy decanters that are very pretty but extremely hard to use (the ones with the super wide base). The poor table next to us got their wine spilled all over the table and into their food as the waitress tried to get the last wine out of the decanter.  Secondly, when I ask the waitress what her favorite dish is I kind of expect her to know how its cooked.  Ours didn't, she just knew to pick the priciest thing on the menu.  I have been a waiter and I know the game, but if your going to pick the priciest thing as your \"favorite\"  (I should have said favorite thing to eat, not sell) you should know how to describe it in an appealing way.\n\nAs far as the food goes, the first two courses were great (hamachi crudo and blood orange salad first, then truffle gnocchi in mushroom brodo) but the main courses were far short of expectations.  The duck was a huge portion but chewy and the rabbit was very dry.  \n\nIf you go, I suggest sticking with the pasta dishes which are quite good and available in app or entree sizes.  And don't let them decant your wine!", "author": "Pete M."}

Lucky for us, we were able to make reservations only a few hours before.  Don't get me wrong, it's not that the restaurant was empty that night...in fact, it was completely filled...and the restaurant is also a lot bigger than it looks!  \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is a nice mix of old and new.  The exposed brick walls and painted pipes on the ceiling opposite the clean light wood walls and glass and mirror touches all compliment each other well.  From the street, the restaurant looks small and narrow, however, it actually goes back a long way and widens towards the middle of the restaurant.  Suprise, surprise!\n\nLet me tell you, Perbacco definitely knows how to take care of special occasions.  The minute we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and were wished a happy anniversary--nice!  and immediately walked to our table, which was a \"special\" corner booth--double nice!  and placed on our table was an anniversary card--nice, again!\n\nI'm not some type of professional food critic...in fact, it's hard for me to even describe the difference between sweet and sour...but I can tell when food tastes good or not...and the food at Perbacco tasted just as good as everything looked!  We started off with the salumi misti which had a nice variety of salami.  And followed with the raviloi--my favorite!!  Cooked inside the ravioli, was spinach and ricotta and egg yolk...ahh soo good!!!!  The egg yolk really made it that much better!  And for our main dish, we had short ribs which had so much flavor and were also very, very tender.  For dessert, we decided to stick to something light--lemon sorbet.  It was a nice change to our meal, but it was a bit too sour.  However, when we mixed it with the lady fingers (I think), it sort of neutralized the sourness.  But, despite the taste, the presentation of sorbet was so cute...the chef had written \"Happy anniversary\" in chocolate on the platter...nice way to end our meal!  :)\n\nAll in all...great experience with good food.

Frankly, it reminded me a bit of the French Laundry- not terribly inspired.  Still, as my dad always said, you can't eat ambience.  \n\nMost memorable:\n-- A red sparking wine!

I don't get it.\n\nI think this place was good; like the description of the three star rating, it was A-OK. The restaurant is gorgeous, the service was excellent but the food was just ok. We started with the albacore tuna crudo...good, tuna was slightly on the tough side but the cherry tomatoes were fantastic. BF had the pork chop, which came highly recommended by our waitress. It was good but not great - slightly tougher than we would have liked, and way too salty for my tastes (had to drink an extra glass of water). I had the tajarin - hand-cut tagliatelle noodles which were to die for, but served with a very so-so pork sauce. I swear it tasted like an expensive version of Hamburger Helper - Beef Stroganoff. Now, I really like Hamburger Helper, but at home, not in a restaurant.\n\nHowever, the wine was good and like I said earlier, the service was wonderful.

When we called in we specified it was for a birthday and gave the host the name of the birthday girl, we'll say Betty, and we made the reservation under another name. When we arrived we gave the host our reservation name and he asked who Betty was...yeah real smooth. \n\nWe sat down and started going over the menu to decide what we wanted. Another table sat down 5-10 minutes later. The server greeted us then followed by greeting the other table next to us. Several minutes later she walked over to the other table and took their drink order. She passed our table...the table are less than a foot apart. When she dropped off their drinks she took our drink order.\n\nWhen she dropped off our drinks we ordered our food. The drinks were really good and decently strong. The food came out fairly quickly. We ordered a fried shrimp appetizer and the burrata. The burrata was really good and I would definitely order it again.  The fried shrimp appetizer came with fried green and white beans also. The beans were really good but the shrimp itself was very salty. \n\nWhen we ordered our entrees we requested for the server to add mushrooms to one of them. The rest we ordered regular. When the entrees came out she had added mushrooms to one of our side dishes instead of our entree. We split two of the entrees between two of us. They were very generous and split the two entrees for us which was a nice touch. The entrees were really good too. \n\nAs we were finishing our entrees the server came up to the table and very loudly, \"whispered\" to one of my friends, \"Which one is Betty again?\" Oh my gosh are you serious this was supposed to be a nice surprise at the end of the dinner, NOT SUBTLE AT ALL!   \n\nThey brought out a very nice desert with Happy Birthday Betty written on the plate itself in very nice writing. The desert was pretty good but it was more aesthetically pleasing than tasting. They also gave the birthday girl a nice handwritten card which I thought was a really nice touch.\n\nOverall the food was really good and I like the atmosphere of the place. They kind of ruined the whole birthday ambiance though which was really irritating. I would go back though for a nice occasion non surprise related.", "author": "Samantha T."}

Had a B-day dinner here with the folks a couple nights ago and overall it was average.   \n\nFirst of all, if there is a lot of people at the bar, as it was that night, the noise just resonates down into the dining area.   Second of all, if I ask the waitress what would she get if deciding between the quail and the pan roasted chicken, give me some ideas on the two.  Don't just ask me if I like mushrooms and since the chicken has mushrooms go \"then get that one\" Didn't seem like she wanted to give us her thoughts on the menu even though she was more than happy to give her menu thoughts to the table of 6 sitting beside us.  \n\nThirdly, don't send out a bus boy to ask us how our meals were.  I thought that was truly bad service.  What, you can't come by our table to ask us waitress?  \n\nOther than the service, which is a major thing with me, the food was all right.  I had the chicken, like I said up there, and it was pretty good.  Although it was a lil rare near the bone, but what's a lil chicken blood gonna do to me right?   Not like I haven't gotten food poisioning before. \n\nSo the gist of the 3 stars comes because of the service.

We were seated on time for our 8:30 PM reservation, and started off with delicious cocktails (a friend had a Manhattan, and myself a Hendrick's and tonic). \n\nThe server walked the perfect line between being polite and being excited about the menu, and we ended up with a bottle of white from Liguria, split a lovely pear and arugula salad, risotto with quail, and herb gnocchi - all of which were delectable. \n\nHowever, dessert knocked my little cotton socks off.

I had the hanger steak as the main dish, and other than it being a little chewy it was excellent. I'm usually picky when it comes to seasoning (especially if it's too salty), but the seasoning was just right and the side of potatoes was delicious.

Those lunches where I get to go to super nice places in the financial district and not pay and sit next to people that definitely have more money than I do. :-)\n\nAnyway, picked this place because it's one of the only places I have yet to go to in the Financial District.  We started with quite a few appetizers.  (I had no idea what 1/2 the things meant on the menu by the way, so we picked these with the help of the waiter.)  We started with the Burrata cheese, the Frito Misto,  a strawberry type salad, and I believe the veal.  Things I would recommend: 1- strawberry salad.  Strawberries were extremely fresh and full of flavor.  The  mix of the salad was excellent.  2- Burrata Cheese- we had no idea what this was but it was delish.  It comes with a couple pieces of toasted bread.  The cheese tasted very fresh and of high quality.  Things to not get: 1- The Frito Misto- it basically was tempura.  I'd pass. 2- the raw veal- tasted like beef carpaccio.  Just not my personal preference.\n\nNext they brought this bread.  This foccacia bread was REALLY a treat.  I seriously could live off it.  Definitely high in cals I'm sure but the crust was crispy and it was delish all around.\n\nThen our main entrees came out.  We were told to get the pasta.  I got the pasta with the duck ragu on top.  It was out of this world.  Meat was tender, seasoned VERY well, sauce was put on just right and pasta was very authentic.  Everyone at my table (except the one who ordered the risotto) though their dish was great.\n\nWhat's a recruiting lunch without dessert?  Unfortunately I wish we had passed.  We ordered the warm hazelnut cake and I believe the chocolate souffle.  We were all very disappointed in the desserts.  None of them were very appetizing.\n\nAlso, the over all atmosphere at lunch was pretty loud.  It was hard to socialize.  The ambiance is fine, new trendy restaurant like.\n\nSo this place does serve high quality and great pastas.  But because of the disappointment with our appetizers and desserts, I'm bringing the review down a couple stars.  And unfortunately next recruiting lunch, I may be choosing One Market.", "author": "Rachel S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-31", "description": "I read an article many years ago extolling the virtues of Manhattans served in San Francisco. I decided I had to see for myself. The first place I stopped on my exploration of Manhattans in San Francisco was Pebacco. Pebacco is in the middle of the Financial District, with a rather small facade that belies the size of the restaurant inside. I of course situated myself at the bar and, after introducing myself to the bartender, mentioned that I heard they do a great Manhattan. With pride he replied, \"We absolutely do\", and he put one together for me. The Manhattan was very good; it was well assembled, but it didn't have quite the level of bite I was looking for. The best way to describe their Manhattan is it's one with training wheels; if you're new to classic cocktails and are just looking for somewhere to start, this would be the Manhattan for you. It was mellow, approachable, but still tasty.\n\nFor dinner I decided to start off with the pesce crudo. Frankly, I had no idea what it would be, but the ingredients included hamachi, basil, ginger and a little jalape\u00f1o, which all sounded good and I took a chance and went for it. I'm glad I did. The flavors all came together perfectly, and the jalape\u00f1os were sliced thin enough that they brought just a little heat to the party but didn't overwhelm the dish. I went with the scallops for my main, which was served with corn and pearl onions. Scallops, like shrimp, are very simple to do well, but also very easy to overcook. I'd say that a good 80% of the time when I order either one in a restaurant it's rubbery and overcooked. These, however, were cooked to perfection. The wine the bartender recommended (a sauvignon blanc) matched nicely. With great food, service and cocktails Perbacco is the perfect place to start off any evening.", "author": "Christopher H."}

I went two weeks ago with my girlfriend, and without fail the food was delicious. \n\nI started with truffle and ricotta gnocchi, mixed with wild mushrooms; the pasta was cooked wonderfully, and the flavors were very well balanced, with a distinct truffle note but not allowing either fungus to overpower the dish. She started with fritto misto rock shrimp, served with a lemon aioli; the shrimp was cooked very well, but to me the real standout here were the other bits in the dish. Green beans and a squash or cucumber were present, but the real surprise and delight was the occasional olive, prepared fritto misto as well. \n\nOur main courses continued this theme of excellence. Her pesto was some of the best I have ever tasted, striking a perfect balance between the powerful ingredients. I ordered the quail, which was presented steaming hot from its original dish onto my plate. The bird was stuffed with a sausage, which helped to balance with the gamy flesh, with beet greens and \"polenta rustica\", a coarse-grained polenta, on the side. Each of these was incredible, but the real finishing touch was black truffle grated over the polenta. That this was not advertised as part of the dish impressed me all the more. \n\nBetween our dinners and the free bread and bread sticks, my date and I almost had to skip dessert, but we managed to eat our way through a raspberry sorbetto and strawberry gelato; that each of these tasted as if we were eating the chilled berries helped us in our endeavor. \n\nService at Perbacco was also a head above the rest; we arrived early, and were seated prior to our actual reservation. As we are rather young, my girlfriend and I are rather used to being ignored at restaurants; not the case here. Our waiters were attentive and professional throughout the evening, and we never were wanting for service. \n\nAll told, Perbacco was a great experience, and one I would readily repeat.", "author": "Patrick S."}

Salumi and cheeses are great, too, along with a lot of great seafood choices and great sides (try the brown butter brussels sprouts!)  Restaurant is beautiful but not huge and bar is small, so make reservations.", "author": "Andrea D."}

I'm told it's usually a reservation-only place for lunch.  We were one of four couples in the entire place, but that changed about 20 minutes later.  The place was jumping!  We sat in the alcove-like area on the first floor just to the right past the bar.  Not much to say about the decor there.  But, the bar area was awesome.  I had high expectations for the food and wasn't disappointed.  Great flavor.  I added a side of Brussels sprouts - which I don't ususally like - and loved it!  The highlight:  Awesome service!  For me, poor service can ruin the entire experience no matter how good the food is, and since this was my first time there after coming highly recommended, I am definitely a fan and can't wait to go back for another meal!

Service is brisk and warm and the interior is comforting. Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly, even though we brought our own bottle of wine (cutting into our bill, his tip). My girlfriend and I ended up just splitting a bunch of things: a plate of charcuterie and dried salame, followed by a beet salad. We split our entree which was potato gnocchi in a red sauce. Our portion was very small - small enough that if combined (equaling a full entree) I would have been dismayed. But in the end it worked out because we mentioned this to the waiter and when we orderede dessert, the kitchen way over-compensated and gave us a whole menageries of gelato flavors, when we just ordered one.\n\nOverall, a good pick. The bar has great mixed drinks and of course the wine list is very extensive.", "author": "Cody C."}

We'd both been looking forward to it, and it lived up to our expectations.\n\nThey started us out with both breadsticks, coupled with a nice, fresh pesto, AND bread and butter.  We shared all of the dishes.  We started off with the pear/arugula/gorgonzola/hazelnut salad (smallish, but really good) and the papardelle with short rib ragu.  The papardelle dish was so good we were fighting over the serving plate to lick it.  It struck the perfect balance between being really satisfying comfort food and not being too heavy.  Flavors were blended perfectly and textures were great.  The fresh pasta was superb.\n\nOur entrees were braised pork shoulder over savoy cabbage for her, and grilled chicken for me.  The pork, as with the beef in the appetizer, was fall-apart yummy, but not too heavy.  I would give a lot to have that dish again on a cold, rainy day.  It came with polenta, the perfect accompaniment.  My grilled chicken breast was the best I've ever had.  My boss agreed.  It was fresh and moist, grilled perfectly, with a lovely sauce.\n\nFinally, dessert--the reason we wanted to try this restaurant:  a trio of gelati, all of which were quite good, but the highlight was the caramel gelato with chunks of sea salt blended in.  The combination of textures and sweet/salty flavors was practically orgasmic.\n\nThe service was pleasant and efficient.  Although it was crowded, it was not so loud that we could not converse.  I can't think of a thing about this place I would change.  I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Earline A."}

I love Perbacco, it has been one of my dearest places to dine since they open years ago and continues to be up to this day, not only the food is prepared with the freshest ingredients but you should see the food presentation and wait until you taste. It is so good. On this particular evening my dinning companion and I shared the Crudo (hamachi) grapefruit/serrano chili/radish/and peppercress it was outstanding full of flavors.

The agnolotti dal plin were probably the highlight of my meal, perfectly executed and just as generous as the starter. \n\nMy main course were shortribs topped with a bone marrow crust over a carrot puree. It was delicious and huge, but not the most delicate composition. The richness of the bone marrow kind of got lost in the sauce. \n\nThe desserts are a rip off. A $7 sorbet came frozen to -10 C -- ever heard of tempering your ice cream, pastry chef? -- accompanied by two old slices of pear and an insipid, stale ginger shortbread.\n\nMy partner had worse luck with his first courses, but his entree of foie gras-stuffed quail was superb.  \n\nThe location is beautiful, understated and urban, not ultra fancy.

I have never had such a thing happen to me and as a result my boyfriend and I decided to give them another try.\n\nOur second visit to Perbacco was a totally different and far better experience.\n\nWhen we got there we were seated within a couple of minutes at a nice table on the ground floor.  The area we were in was fairly quiet and my boyfriend and I could have a pleasant conversation.  We had a great server, who spent time explaining several of the items on the menu and make very good wine pairing suggestions for the dishes we ordered.\n\nThe food:\nI\"ll start with my dishes.\nHouse made salumi: Delicious.  Very fresh and for the first time I had  blood salami and it was really good.\n\nGrilled Octopus with potatos and haricort vertes:  This was an amazing appetizer.  The octopus was so tender, it didn't even really seem like I was eating octopus. \n\nTagliatelle with Pork Sugo and Porcini Mushrooms:  Again another winner.  Very savory and rich in flavor, the pasta and the pork/mushrom sauce were a great pairing.\n\nI also asked my boyfriend to tell me how his dishes were and here are his comments.\nHamachi:  Excellent!   Unusual combination of flavors including mint lime and honeydew melon with the hamachi, which combined to create a dish that melted in the mouth.\n\nSeared Sea Bass:  This was a delicious dish as well.  The fish was excellently seasoned and was a good portion size in that it wasn't too small.\n\nOverall, our second visit to Perbacco was completely different  in terms of food, service and ambiance.

I've been looking for an excuse to try the place and someone finally offered to introduce me to the fantastic lunch menu. The meal was satisfying, the portions generous and the service prompt and pleasant.\n\nWe sat in the main dining room and, contrary to other reviewers, my companion and I were perfectly able to carry on a conversation without shouting to be heard. Service was attentive without being bothersome and we were given all the time we needed to make our decisions. \n\nFood: very good, 4 stars. \n\nHere's the breakdown ...\n\nSalads:\n\nI enjoyed the beet salad, my companion loved her tomato salad (end of season, probably the last chance to indulge). We tasted from one another's plates and agreed both salads hit the mark - well balanced flavors, appropriate portion sizes, great textures. \n\nPastas:\n\nI had to try the pappardelle given the number of people I've spoken to who raved about it. I thought it was very good, but I kept thinking it needed something ... like salt. The flavors were complex, but they didn't blow me away and I just couldn't get enough of the taste of the sauce. However, the pasta itself was exceptional. I could have eaten it with just a little olive oil and salt and pepper and been just as happy. Still, not a bad dish and I recommend it to my pappardelle loving friends.\n\nMy companion enjoyed the agnolotti filled with veal and cabbage with a bit of the short rib ragu drizzled over the top. It looked great, but I didn't try it. I will next time!\n\nCheese:\n\nWe finished our lunch by sharing a 3-choice cheese plate. I ordered the gorgonzola dolce, the goat and the Brescianella All'Aquavite (a cow's milk cheese coated in rye husks and soaked in grappa). The portions were unbelievably generous. I'm accustomed to cheese slivers when I order a cheese course out. It was almost too much cheese (saying a lot for an addict like me). It came with a plate of sliced walnut bread, roasted almonds, honey and re-hydrated golden raisins.

The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We made our reservation on opentable.com and when we arrived the hostess offered to seat us right away or to wait until 6:30 and have a drink in the bar. We tried the mojito and a house special with gin, cucumber infused syrup and lemon juice, both were superb. The servers were very friendly and professional. I asked to be seated in a quieter area (it's not overly loud inside but it's not super quite either) as it was our anniversary, and we were seated in a corner booth which was perfect. The server was helpful in her wine recommendations, as neither of us are familiar with Italian varietals. Wine also comes by the glass, 1/4 L or 1/2 L which is perfect for a couple. The mixed salumi plate was excellent but rich, it's probably a bit more than two people need but offers a nice variety of cured pork and veal. \n\nDinner was the duck for me and meyer lemon/mint ravioli for the wife, both were excellent. The duck was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth, and the ravioli were flavorful and tender. Dessert for me was the buttermilk panna cotta and the doughnuts for her, both excellent and the wife's doughnuts came in a cute little white takeout bag, I thought it was a nice touch. They offer dessert wine suggestions with the desserts which is helpful for those who enjoy dessert wines. They also offer a selection of digestifs and bourbon, brandy. The pacing of the meal was so nice, there was ample time in between courses to digest and the food came out at a proper temperature, ready to eat. I notified Perbacco that it was our anniversary mainly to get a quite table but they also gave us a nice card and a special dessert presentation, which I thought was a nice example of going above and beyond, and why they deserve five stars. The price provides good value for the food, the service is top notch and the ambience is fun enough for a group and still romantic for a couple. Parking is probably a beast, they offer valet but we got a ride in and out. Highly recommend for a special event.", "author": "Christopher V."}

Not sure why I keep coming back here when after every meal I tell myself I'm not coming back!   Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good but it's not so extraordinary that I would need to wait hours to eat here.  It's not just dinner either, once I came with coworkers at 11:30am and we could only sit at the bar even though half the tables were empty because they were already \"fully committed.\"  That being said, my favorites are the salumi misti, the pappardelle ragu, the langaroli and the cheese board!

Now, granted I live in North Beach and am not really a fan of Italian food, but the dishes at Perbacco are light and fresh...not your heavy standard fare.\n\nThe interior is gorgeous; all interactions with the staff were great (friendly, genuine, and knowledgeable); and the food is wonderful.  \n\nWe started with the burrata cheese- so yummy!  (even if it did kick my lactose intolerant ass later in the night).  Then, we shared a half order of the pasta with short ribs which was also excellent.  The actual pasta was the best I've had in SF and the meat was not over-powering.  Finally, the duck- delicious and served with a lovely stone fruit salad with perfectly ripe and juicy cherries and nectarines.\n\nWe complimented all this yumminess with a bottle of primitivo (essentially the only Italian red varietal I know anything about) at the bargain basement price of $31.  The food only made the wine taste even better.\n\nI'd definitely go back for drinks/snacks or dinner (love that it's like 3 blocks from my office so it makes a great weeknight choice).

Although we had reservations, it took about 15 minutes to get seated and an uncomfortable 15 minutes at that because there was little room to stand and wait.\n\nHowever, once we were seated, the service was great and the food and alcohol began to flow.  We shared the gnocchi, burrata and cured meats appetizers.  All were very tasty.  Us girls also started out with fragolinos (also very tasty) while my husband had beer.  We each ordered something different - the two fish dishes, the beef short rib and the duck breast.  The wine steward selected a light red wine that was delicious and accompanied everyone's dishes nicely.  The fish dishes were okay, the beef short rib a bit underseasoned and the duck breast sublime.  My friend (recent transplant from NYC) likes to pick a \"winner\" of the all the dishes that are ordered when we dine out.  The duck breast won easily.  \n\nWe also had desserts - sharing the pistachio cake, sorbetto and another litle cake (I can't remember what was in it except it was fruity).  The pistachio cake was my favorite - warm and crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside.  The sorbetto was delicious too - like taking a bite from a frozen strawberry.

But we had a gift certificate to Perbacco.  And we're so happy.  Started with a small salumi misti plate that was fantastics and very generous.  You could simply make it a lite bite with drinks if you wanted.  Then had the anglotti (sp?) pasta for the second course.  For dinner, I had the rabbit (three small piece prepared differently) and my partner had the quail.  The quail was delicious.  The rabbit sauce was excellent, but the rabbit itself seemed overcooked to me.  Our outstanding server paced the meal very well, kept our wine appropriately poured (we brought a bottle) and followed up to see how we were enjoying things.  When she asked about the rabbit, I simply told her that I loved the sauce but the meat was overcooked for me, she immediately asked if she could bring me a new serving.  I didn't want another dish because I was getting full.  So she insisted on bringing us dessert, which we reluctant accepted.  I forget was it was because we wolfed it down in two seconds, even though we were stuffed.\n\nHad the rabbit been as perfect as everything else, this would be a 5 star review.  We'll definitely be back.\n\nBTW - total bill was $150 (incl corkage, tax and tip).  Not bad for such superb service and wonderful food.

A bowl of pasta, 5 stars?  Not a likely combo.  This was not an Italian restaurant with your run of the mill bowls of pasta.  \nWe walked in at 6:30 on a Thursday night, the place was packed.  We were promptly seated in the back part of the restaurant (we had a reservation).  Our server quickly asked us if we wanted water, and asked if we had any questions or needed anything off the bat.  I always liked that, just shows attentiveness of the staff to make sure you are going to get what you need.  After looking over the menu which was packed with pretty much something for everyone, we both settled on an appetizer and entree for each of us.  I started with the Burrata and tomato salad, and then moved on to the braised short ribs.  My girlfriend had a green salad, and ligurian pasta with basil pesto.  \nTo start, we both loved our first courses.  The greens on her salad were about as fresh as they could get, packed with flavor, it wasnt a complicated salad, but all in all it was a perfect blend of greens and paper thin sliced parmesan cheese, with just a hint of dressing.  \nMy salad was absolutely amazing.  The cheese was like eating cream, but just solidified enough to keep some sort of a shape,  and perfectly salted.   The tomatoes were fantastic too.  By far the best burrata I ever had .  \nOur main courses came and we were both blown away.  My short ribs were braised and braised perfectly.  The meat was accompanied by the smoothest mashed potatoes I have ever eaten, also the green beans were lightly salted, peppered and steamed just enough to have some crunch to them.  My girlfriend's pasta had the greenest and tastiest pesto.  It had some other veggies blended in as well.  It was very tasty.  \nAfter we finished our main courses we didn't want to finish this meal, so we decided on having one more glass of wine and some cheese.  I know nothing about cheese, but we settled on two (robiola tre latte and boho bel), and they were fantastic.  We selected one off the \"local cheese\" section of the menu.  It was like eating a brie but a bit lighter in flavor.  Sadly enough it was time for us to move on with life and end the meal.  I couldn't have fit another bite of food in my stomach after everything, but it was a great feeling.  \nI was shocked when I got the bill.  It wasn't a \"cheap\" dinner, but very reasonable I thought. \n2 glasses of wine\n1 cocktail\n2 appetizers\n2 entrees\n2 cheeses\n120 bucks....\nNeedless to say, I have spent that kind of money in a restaurant in San Francisco more then once, and not felt that I got my moneys worth.

When we were done, the host ran outside to get one of the valets to hail us cabs.  It was fun.\n\nWe had the cured meat salumi plate - San Daniele prosciutto, goose prosciutto, pancetta, and coppa - it was awesome.  We were feeling pretty greedy, so we each got two half-portions of pasta... what a genius concept that is!  We had ricotta and green garlic gnocchi with asparagus; tortelloni filled with roasted pork and prosciutto in brodo with fresh peas; tajarin (kind of reminded me of ramen noodles) with a duck sugo; and tagliatelle with short rib ragu and wild mushrooms.

The food was good, but it kind of sucked that they don't permit by-the-glass choosing for boozing groups (full bottles only). Luckily, I was able to strong-arm everyone down a champagne path. And the loo was a little too \"Ally McBeal\" for me.

Our table was ready on time and it was a bustling scene.  Tried the salami misti platter - it was excellent!  The pastas we ordered were delicious.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was rich and flavorful.  I love that you can order an entree or appetizer size to try a few different pastas.  And the chocolate-hazelnut semifreddo is maybe one of the best desserts I have ever had.  For such a lovely meal, the prices were definitely reasonable.

I would highly recommend making reservations because it was packed when we arrived for our own. The atmosphere is fancy and definitely where the people of the Financial District go to wine and dine over business talk.\n\nSlow roasted veal- I really recommend this dish. It was thinly sliced and the lemon and albacore tuna sauce created a great combo.\nPiatra roasted octopus- The octopus was a little bland and slightly overcooked.\nPotato gnocchi- The cheese/cream sauce was yummy and didn't feel too heavy. The toasted hazelnuts created a flavor that reminded me of winter.\n\nFor my main course, I had the duck. This dish came out with 4 generous pieces of duck that had a nice crispy skin. However, the dish was a little salty and 2 out of 4 of my duck pieces were uncooked. For dessert, I had the bread pudding; it was dry. I liken the dessert to french toast with raisins. \n\nThe service was good though. The restaurant was busy but the waiter was able to provide an explanation on the wine and answer any of our questions. The lady who brought out our food was also very nice.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

I haven't seen this service in a long time so I really liked it. Short rib ragu was just perfect. Tagliatelle could have been a little more al dente.\n\nCaponanta had large pieces of roasted peppers that were extremely soft without being mushy. The mackerel was served with skin on but was cooked to perfection. \n\nWhite corn with mushrooms was unexpectedly good. The sweetness of corn worked very well with the smokiness of mushrooms. It was a very buttery dish but worked well with both the pasta and the fish course.\n\nFrom the description, I was expecting a slow cooked whole bean dish. It turned out to be green beans cooked very soft - almost falling apart. But the sauce was unctuous and sweet with tomatoes. Overall the combination was one of those things you want to scoop up with thick slices of bread.\n\nThe cookies were plentiful. Very nutty and bit too sweet. Espresso was adequate.\n\nIt was a lot of food but my stomach felt easy later.  If I go there again, I would just split a soup and a pasta dish.  Or maybe split a pasta dish and a cookie plate. Or a soup and a side. I wish it were a neighborhood place. \n\nService was unobtrusive and friendly. Lots of financial types talking business at lunch time waving their latest gadgets about.

Are you sure?  Myth, really?\" asks my seester.\n\n\"Yeah.\"  Sez me.  \n\n\"Hmmph. . . just seems like a scene to me. . .I am surprised you picked it.\"  \n\nOh.  I am overwhelmed by indecision.  \n\n\"Okay then, how about Fleur de Lys?\"  I ask.\n\nSo we settle on Fleur de Lys.  \n\nThen through a maze of miscommunication, bad weather, missed trips, cancelled reservations and general discombobulation, we ended up at Perbacco for San Francisco/Seattle Seester Christmas Fest 2006.\n\nI like the design as you first walk in . .. it's welcoming and spacious.  The salumi plates are plated at one end of the bar and they have a kick ass chef's dream Italian meat slicer at the end of the bar - I was pleased as I took this as a sign of the restaurants seriousness about their food.  It was a good omen.\n\nThe next good omen was that the bartender had a lovely Irish accent . .. one from Cork I believe and it's one of my favorite accents ever.  He was darling and made us two very delicious drinks. . . as we waited for our table (we were early for our reservation) I perused the menu.  It all looked amazing!  It's one of those menus that makes you wish you had more than one stomach. . .sort of a reserve, if you will, for those times where you just don't want to be limited to one.  Like a ruminate but better.   I mentally made my choices and hoped my seester was hungry!\n\nNext good omen is when we were shown to our table;  I like that altho we were only a deuce, they sat us at a four top.   I do truly appreciate some elbow room!\n\nWe ordered the ciccioli from the salumi menu which is a pork pate of sorts very similar to rilletes.  It was delicious - it came with some crostini and a small dollop of orange marmalade to offset the richness.  \n\nNext came the burrata.  A very generous mound of unctuous cheese drizzled with black truffle oil.  Served with perfectly toasted filone.  My only disappointment here was I would have like more bread with this dish.\n\nNext came carne cruda - a steak tartare of sorts made with veal instead of beef (same but different) - very delicious with just the right amount of garlic to accent the veal without overwhelming it.  We also got the fritto misto which was good as well with the usual suspects (rock shrimp, green beans, fennel) and a surprise of olives. . I'd never had a deep fried olive before and really enjoyed it.  \n\nNext came three appetizer portions of pasta - a pappardelle with braised shortrib sauce and porcini, penne with meatballs and tajarin; which is a thin, square cut pasta similar to angel hair with a five hour pork sugo.  Of the three, the best was the pappardelle - really deep flavor - almost buttery from the braise.  The tajarin was very good, too.  The pasta was obviously fresh and perfectly cooked and the sauce was quite delicious.   One complaint would be that it was that none of the pastas were hot enough - I think it would have been helpful to heat the plates and serve the pasta in small, shallow bowls as opposed to flat plates.   Also, the meatballs were a little tough - flavorful but tough. \n\nNext (no, I am not kidding!), came the pork shoulder, short ribs and a piece of cotechino  - cotechino is one of my favorite Italian sausages and they were featuring it in a bollito misto - I didn't want all the elements of a bollito misto so I asked for just a piece of the cotechino and they very graciously complied and even served it with the three sauces that would have gone with the bollito misto - an orange marmalade, a finely pureed salsa verde and a piquant tomato relish.  The pork shoulder was one of my best dishes I've ever had.  I love braised meat and this dish was just so perfect, I wanted to eat only that.  But then the short rib was not too shabby either. . it's kind of like if you had Jeffrey Dean Morgan standing next to George Clooney and you had to pick between them.  Both luscious!  The cotechino was stellar as well - perfect texture and very balanced spices.  I was so happy with the entrees!  These days, it seems that restaurants present amazing appetizers and then fall short on the entrees but Perbacco dishes up some amazing entrees.\n\nWe were full so we didn't get to have dessert - next time less entrees, more dessert.  \n\nThis restaurant is only 7 weeks old so there were some service bumps - kind of slow on service and lag time between pastas and entrees was a little long.  The clientele is a trip - there were a lot of really drunk people there - and while that is not the restaurants fault, it was kind of a distraction.  The bathrooms are funky.  Unisex but not. . .you'll go, you'll see.  \n\nI can't wait for my seester to come visit again so we can again - next time, my treat!", "author": "Lainie L."}

For example, I went there for a business lunch and we let our server know that we needed to be back at the office within an hour and we ordered right away.  An hour and 45 minutes later i paid the check- with no apologies for the delay.  \n2 ambiance is good but not great.  why?  because that place is just so dang loud!  for my birthday dinner last year, my husband and i could not understand a word the other was saying because it was so loud.  oh well, we just spoke up.", "author": "Kari P."}

Ok, so apparently there are 1000 people on Yelp who have not had truly good Italian food, I guess.  The restaurant was fine; had I come across it walking by and had a meal, I'd be ok with it. Presentation varied between delightful (beet salad) sloppy (agnolotti appetizer dumped on a plate).  The taste? Well, as ex-Californian (born and raised there), I can only say this ... It's like a stereotypical Hollywood blonde with surgical 'enhancements' that make her look like a cover girl ... You would do anything to date her based on appearance but when you sit down to talk, you realize that she is as vacuous as a blank canvas. The food was monotonous, at best. The ideas looked nice on paper but when the plate came to the table, \"meh\" is all I could think. My wife actually sent her dish back it was so bland.   My advice is to take what you read with a grain of salt; even my evaluation.  Just be cautious, that's all.

Everything gets TONS of salt, from ravioli to breadsticks to desserts.....damn..\n2.  Wine is kept at another table.  We ordered a bottle, they poured it, and put it on a communal table of other people's open wine bottles.  Of course, when you want to be refilled, they are nowhere to be found.  I do not need my wine intake to be controlled by waitstaff (ok-maybe I do, but that's not gonna make me come back!).\n3.  Dirty Radicchio-My salad was not washed and in the midst of eating it, found a huge clump of dirt in it.  To their credit, they took it off the check and provided me with a free (salty) dessert.\n4.  Wine glasses-So, we ordered a Zinfandel.  The table next to us ordered the same bottle.  They received wine glasses designed for drinking Zin and enhancing the taste.  We were left with the original glasses on the table.\n5.  Medium means medium-Medium steak does not mean bloody and raw, it means MEDIUM.  Luckily, still tasted good.\nOk, I lied--6 reasons, but #6 is really important:\n6.  Cheese plate-So, we picked the cheeses for dessert-a blue and 2 soft cheeses.  First of all, the cheese are kept on a table with the communal wines.  They are not covered either for safety or to keep the moisture in the cheese, so it was no surprise one cheese was quite dried out.  Then, they brought them on a plate with nothing on which to place/eat them (crackers, fruit, bread).  When asking for bread, we received the DINNER ROLLS that came at the beginning of the meal.  If there is one thing I know and love, it's my cheese.  The wrong bread or accompanyment can ruin the experience of tasting the cheese.  Thick, wheat rolls do NOT go well with a gorgonzola piccante.  That was the last straw for me, nobody should ruin my cheese.......ever.........\n\nUpdate one day later:  Guess the unwashed radicchio was more of a problem than I thought.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-04-11", "description": "My friend and I arrived early for our reservation so we sat at the empty bar which really has too many chairs. The bartender handed us one wine menu to share and we had to ask for another. We overheard a girl ask him how their pinot grigio was and his response was, \"good.\" She seemed satisfied with the answer, but I wouldn't have expected him to say it was bad. Shouldn't a bartender be able to elaborate on the selections on the bar menu?  My friend and I decided on a cocktail with prosecco and strawberry puree. The drink was great and the scene at the bar began to pick up. They have a mirror running the entire length of the restaurant which is nice to check out yourself (and others) in because the bar is hard to move around if you're sitting because you are locked in by all the chairs. \n\nWe were seated for dinner under the upstairs portion, and the ceiling was very low and the whole section was claustrophobic. There were cheesy paintings of Italy on the walls but I didn't find it attractive. Along with the vinyl booths that lined the walls, it evoked Olive Garden instead of Upscale Italian Eatery. However, the exposed brick and high ceilings on the opposite side of the restaurant were charming. The white and grey marble subway tiles clash with the warm colors on the walls. And the mirror that extends all the way throughout the restaurant gives you a clear view of the kitchen floor if you are seated toward the back of the restaurant.  The bathrooms are downstairs and around the corner with the same ugly tile thats in the restaurant. In fact,  the tile looked like it belonged only in the bathroom as opposed to throughout the whole dining room. The bathrooms are also mixed male/female, but the individual stalls are designated male/female.  Not bad but odd.\n\nThe wine director \"helped\" us pick out a bottle of wine... we discussed wanting a red that leaned towards the fruity side with notes of cherries. We got our $76 bottle of Sangiovese and it had notes of band-aids (really, it smelled like band-aids) instead of cherries and was spicy which is exactly what we told him we didn't want. The appetizers came very quickly and my friend's burrata with truffled salsa was fantastic. Very creamy and the truffles weren't overpowering as they can sometimes be.  I would definitely order that if I were forced to eat there again. I had the pear and endive salad which was extremely hard to eat. There was more arugula then anything else. The pear was too ripe and I couldn't get the endive on my fork it was julienned lengthwise and there wasn't much of it. The hunk of gorgonzola on this side would have been better crumbled on top. For dinner I ordered the ricotta and garlic gnocchi --- nothing to write home about and I didn't even finish it. My friend had the tagliatelli with pork sugo that was just a plate of pasta that looked like ramen with a big dollop of pork sugo on top. Edible, but that's about it. We ordered the panna cotta for dessert. The panna cotta tasted good, but the presentation was lacking. It was just a hunk of panna cotta in the middle with some strawberries on the side. And the strangest thing was the black pepper they deliberately (I think) sprinkled around the edge of the plate. It didn't add to the presentation, and we couldn't figure out why they would put it there because it certainly wouldn't add to the taste. \n\nThe service was just strange. Halfway through my meal the waitress asked if I wanted more bread and I told her no. She then walked over and took my bread plate with the half a roll I was saving for the sauce. It was bizarre. She left my friends' bread plates with bread on them. I was pissed! Hey, I just said I didn't want MORE bread not get this bread out of my sight! Although the food came fast it took forever to clear our plates. The waitress walked by about 5 times and none of us had touched our plates... and our forks were resting in the \"take me away\" position. But as soon as one of us was finished with our wine, she would come and take away that glass only. But our plates were still sitting there. And once our plates were finally cleared, we had to get her attention and ask for the check, because she was ignoring us at that point. \n\nThey are not a fold-your-napkin while you are in the bathroom restaurant....

It is without a doubt why people come here- it is  to taste what is Italy- through its wine, food and service.\n\nMy friend and I decided to meet here for dinner- it was both our first time to dine here and was very much looking forward to celebrating a recent promotion!\nFor starter:\nTasting of Salame- Nostrano, Finocchiona, Finocchiona picante and sangunato. This was a wonderful selection of the finest salami I have ever tasted.  The Nostrano was tender and sweet dotted with peppercorns, the finocchiona (cinta senese) was rich and seasoned with fennel- accompanied with the spicy version for contrast.  The sanguinato \"blood sausage\" was suprisingly delicious- a tarty sweetness but not too rich.\nThe Fritto Misto- was crispy and light- the rock shrimp was fresh with the  addition of  green beans, olives, fennel and lemon rings -all suited the aioli lemon dipping sauce.\nMy friend ordered the Beef Short Rib Stracotto- an italian version of pot roast- deliciously flavored with carrots, peas and gremolata.\nThe Braised Lamb Shank was the best I've had in a while, it was stewed to perfection- meat almost falling off the bones- the reduced stew sauce was impeccably rich and bold- I highly recommend it!\nNone of this could not have been more accentuated  by the Avignonesi 50 & 50 Capannelle, 2000 Tuscan wine- rich tannins- fresh tartiness that when allowed to breathe revealed its layers of complexity.  From appetizers- they were lush plums, cherries, and chocolate.  By the main dish- they were ripening raisins, prunes and light tabacco...ahhhh wines do breathe :-) \nI really liked the modern feel to this place, the dusk lighting and Cezanne-esque Italian countryside paintings were nostalgically entertaining, the staff all uniformed in crisp white shirts- not only conveyed tidiness but knowledge and courteousness.\n\nPS- Making Perbacco your next lunch/dinner venue will certainly accentuate a positive outlook in your life!  Si- La Dolce Vita!", "author": "Arissa C."}

Because it reminded me so much of something I saw on the Discovery channel on the decadence of ancient Rome it was uncanny. Well no vomitorium or slaves that I saw but otherwise it was dead on. \nSo yes my party of morally bankrupt Roman senators and I dined on the Salumi misti, which lived up to the hype, 5 hour pork ragu on taglitelli, also quite tasty and some great entrees. The most outstanding of the entrees in my opinion were the Tuna and the Pork Shoulder. Both completely spectacular. I had the Salsiccia and it was fucking great, the only thing that I didn't like was that the Cipollini onions were served cold but that's ok. I fucking love sausage and this was damn fine. The wine was flowing and fantastic. \nI have to say the service was good, not great but good. The busser stacked up all of our dirty plates and silverware until he could take everything at once which I really hate. It's so obtrusive but I forgive him.\nDesserts and cheeses were right on. I fucking love cheese and they have many choices all runny and stinky on a big board in the middle of the room!

Oh how wrong this place was, at least on this night. This was shortly before Christmas, and I had reserved a table upstairs both through Opentable and talking to one of the managers.\nLow and behold when we get there, the table was still not available, and I wasn't having that for my mom. The manager said he would do the best he could to secure the table as the occupants had been there a long time. Personally, I didn't felt his bedside manner was lacking for some reason. So we decided to wait an extra half hour or so for the booth. In the meantime, we ordered drinks. Now, a smart person who full well knows this is a special night for new clientele would comp the drinks straight out and say so. But the whole time we were drinking, I was not sure if that gesture was even thought of. Not until the end of the night did I find out that my cocktail was taken off the bill but not the wine. I'm not even sure why that was.\nAnyhow, on to the food. Also all around disappointing. Both our dishes, the ribs and seared tuna, both came to the table lukewarm at best. In her words, Mom has had better ribs at Jardiniere and Ad Hoc. My tuna was seared almost all the way through, which is a big no no. If I want to have Star of the Sea tuna served on a fancy plate, I can go to Safeway anytime.\nThe one upside of this whole affair was that one of the staff was very kind in trying to make us feel comfortable, so much so, he even took a little break to sit with us. He sympathized with the wait time and even said we should have had the booth behind us, which overlooked the kitchen through frosted glass. He was very concerned when we came down from the meal in less than an hour without even trying dessert. It's too bad restaurants cannot survive on goodwill alone.", "author": "Kevin A."}

Perbacco in Italian means \"by Bacchus,\" the Roman god of wine (and debauchery) - love the name.  With all this going for it, and the strong word of mouth, my expectations were high coming in.\n\nFood:  2 stars.  Appetizers and pastas definitely outperform the disappointing entrees here.  Also, Michael Bauer loves the breadsticks, but there's nothing special about them.  We took the server's recommendation and tried the salumi misti (chef's selection), and were immediately wowed.  I usually don't care too much for salumi, but Perbacco's exceeded my expectations.  Especially good were the sanguinato (blood sausage), mortadella and ciccioli (shredded pork pate).  Skip the pickled watermelon rind included with the salumi, it's pretty nasty.  I was equally impressed with the agnolotti dal plin filled with roasted veal and cabbage.  The agnolotti is very similar to tortellini or ravioli.  We also tried the burrata cheese, which didn't have as creamy of an interior as I expected, and the tajarin (tagliatelle with pork sugo), which had a good texture but was a little bland.  Given the server's awesome picks on the first set of courses (he didn't recommend the burrata cheese or tajarin), we decided to go with his picks for the main courses (duck breast, ribeye steak, and devil's gulch rabbit).  While the rabbit and duck breast were not spectacular by any means, I would rather have those entrees than the charred ribeye I received.  All I tasted was ash.  Dessert (fig leaf panna cotta) was decent, but not memorable.\n\nService:  3 stars.  Service was smooth, attentive, and extremely friendly....but I took my server's recommendation and had an ashtray for my main course, which is unforgivable.\n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars.  There is a lot going on in this restaurant from a design point of view.  The design is quirky yet modern and sleek.  It's definitely a vast improvement over the Gold Coast (not to be confused with the Gold Club), which previously occupied this space.  Extra points for the wall mirrors perfectly angled for people-watching (and my, do the people look good).\n\nHits:   Salumi, agnolotti dal plin filled with roasted vittelone and savoy cabbage.\n\nMisses:  Grilled dry aged ribeye steak, extra-charred.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Delfina, Oliveto, Acquerello, Incanto", "author": "Keith C."}

Delfina is one of my favorite restos and I loved my Xmas overindulgence at A16. The dishes I tried at Perbacco were mostly good but the service approached awful.\nWe waited for 15 minutes at the bar for our 830 res; the place was absolutely full. Drinks at the bar were crisp; I had a greyhound for an extra dose of vitamin c during cold season. At the bar, you get to watch the crudo and salumi stations prepare their platters. \n\nWe were seated downstairs in the low ceilinged nook that housed the kitchen at the Gold Coast. They've done a lot with the space, conversations were held at normal levels despite the crowd. As our entire table wanted to try as many items as possible, we opted for the small ($18) salumi misto. Our waitress pushed us to order the large ($30) but we were also ordering a crudo, 2 salads, and entrees, which sounded like a lot of food. The small platter ended up being more than sufficient with about 3 pieces each of prosciutto, mortadella, a few salumi, and a pork pate. Although I'm a sucker for cured meats and will go to extreme lengths for crocks of pate, nothing on the plate was craveworthy. Everything was good, but it lacked sparkle. \n\nService issues became apparent as the crudo, radicchio salad, and pear, gorgonzola, and endive salad arrived. Our food runner would silently drop plates onto the crowded table with a complete lack of finesse. We were left holding plates and moving glasses out of the way as we waited for our waitress to return for the used items. It was definitely awkward, and there was no coordination between the bussers, food runners, waitress, etc. \n\nThe crudo was very fresh and the portion was quite large especially compared to the tiny portion at the Slanted Door. The kitchen nicely split the basic radicchio salad with creamy garlic dressing. During the chaos of the starters our wine, a Piedmontese Roero Arneis, arrived. Interestingly, they pour the wine for you and whisk it away to a table at the center of the room. While this is usually fine with me, there was confusion throughout the night if our bottle had been finished or was merely hiding. A major complaint of mine was the wine service. For a 4-top eating a multi-course meal, they completely dropped the ball on our booze. We had friends from out of town visiting and it was impossible to get a second bottle despite trying to flag down our waitress, asking our food runner, and asking some other guy for it. I was shocked at how difficult it was to order the second bottle. By the time our waitress returned, half of our entrees had been eaten and some of our guests thought it was too late for another bottle. The manfriend and I ordered another 1/2 liter, but this aspect of the meal really bothered me. I like my beverages! \n\nAfter another round of musical plates when the entrees arrived, I was finally able to tuck into the lauded agnolotti dal plin, little pockets filled with a mlange of veal, sausage, and vegetables. It seems everywhere I turn these days, this newly chic pasta shape is receiving heaps of praise from food mags, bloggers, and critics.I liked it, but it did not illicit the same toe-curling need to lick my plate as the chicken and foie gras ravioli at Delfina or even the need to order another serving immediately afterward like the crab and toasty breadcrumb pasta at A16. The filling was balanced and savory, and I enjoyed the sheer wisps of savoy cabbage in the pool of browned roasted meat juices that coated the pasta. However, I expected thinner wrappers to ensure a maximum filling to noodle ratio.\n\nI anticipated more from the Berkshire pork shoulder al latte. I cook a lot of pork roasts, carnitas, and other succulent cuts at home. I turned to the manfriend for his reaction, it was \"yeah, it's okay.\" Some bites were on the dry side which is really odd for such a fatty cut that had been braised. He later reported that some bites were quite good, but it's pork shoulder, come on! The rest of the table was happy with their gorgonzola and nettle gnocchi and tuna mains. \n\nNo space for dessert after all that. We asked the waitress to put $100 on the card and gave her $140 cash; equaling the total plus exactly 20% for tip despite the service issues. I did not take up any of the issues with the manager and give them a chance to correct them. It was so hard to get a 2nd bottle of wine and I had guests with me, so I thought it would be a big scene. When entertaining, you want things to go as smoothly as possible. Instead, what we got back was the full bill ($200) on the card and $140 cash had been taken for a tip. A 70% tip! WTF? No way, not after the wine debacle. We eventually got the bill corrected but she acted like it was someone else's fault. I'm not sure who would make that sort of mistake, as a 70% tip is unusual. Service issues bumped a 4 or 4.5 star meal was bumped down to a 3 star experience.", "author": "Candice L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-02", "description": "Who should eat here:  Looking for a great Italian place in the financial district?  Definitely look up Perbacco.  Especially good for a business lunch/dinner, given the crowd, but don't let this turn you off, the food makes it worth a visit.  \n\n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\n3 Stars - Adequate\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\n\nAtmosphere/Ambiance: 3.5 stars.  The feel at Perbacco is on the serious side given its location in the financial district.  Think Aqua, One Market, Boulevard, but just a tad more causal.  The place is general bustling with the typical downtown business crowd.  They have a nice bar, where you can grab a drink and apps before sitting down for dinner.  The dinning room is a little bland, and can get a little bit noisy.  Its fun though and would work perfect for a meal with a friend/friends or business acquaintances.\n\nService: 3.5 stars.  I found our service to be better than adequate.  Our waitress was nice and accommodating.  The timing of the food was perfect and I really have nothing to complain about here.  However, one thing to remember, is that there is little intimacy and the service is more on the serious side given the clientele.  Don't take this the wrong way, they are not rude in any way.   Additionally, when we were there (Thurs night) it was very busy, so our waitress only made a couple of stops by the table.  Overall though, I was totally satisfied with the service, but it wasn't anything to rave about.\n\nFood: 4 stars.  I have heard some very mixed things from friends on Perbacco, but I have to say everything we ordered was very good.  We started with a Salame plate that had four different preparations.  There was a blood salame, a fennel salame, and two others that I forget.  I liked all four and I thought the portion side was more than generous.  Next we moved into some apps: the steak tartar and the bresaola.  The tartar left something to be desired.  It was good, but not really all that special, and I have had much better tartar, so I would look to the bresaola if you want a meat as an app.  For those of you that have never tried Bresaola give it a whirl, it is basically air dried salted steak.  Yum.  It was thin as paper, but had amazing freshness and very concentrated meat flavors.  For entrees we ordered the Pappardelle with braised short rib ragu and the duck breast.  The pasta was delicious, made fresh and cooked perfectly.  The short rib ragu was a very nice touch adding a nice richness to the pasta without making it over the top.  The duck was also good, and I think some of best duck I have had in the city recently.  It was a breast, but came whole rather than the thinly sliced preparation you normally receive.  I felt this locked in the flavors better and created more rich earthy flavors that speak more to the heart of the food.  Very tasty and highly recommended.  Finally for desert we had a trio of gelatos.  All were really good, there was a chocolate flavor, a hazelnut and a pistachio.  Nothing special, but all really good, and a nice refreshing end to the meal.\n\nWine: 4 stars.  Perbacco has a really solid list, specializing in Italian varietals.  Most of the regions (not just the popular ones) are represented in both whites and reds.  This is great for experimenting with some of the rarer Italian wines.  We ordered a bottle of the Paolo Scavino Barbera d Alba.  For $42 you can't go wrong.  This is one of the best producers in Piedmont, and for those that don't want to drop $150 on one of his Barolos this is a fantastic option.  Next we dipped into a 1997 Tignanello (which I brought).  The Som waived our corkage since I bought a bottle, which I thought was pretty cool.  As far as the wine goes, though, I would first choose what you want to eat and then ask them to suggest some wine options.  Ask for something out of the ordinary, there are some really fun things on the list.  Bravo!\n\nOverall: 4 stars.  I was impressed all around with Perbacco.  Definitely not a great date place or a place for a romantic dinner, but a really well done Italian restaurant with a good up beat crowd.  A must try in the financial district.", "author": "Scott P."}

We sat in the dining room in the back to the right, my least favorite part of the restaurant, the ceiling is low and it was about 85 degrees in there. Way too hot to be enjoyable. \nOur server, slow to greeting us almost like we had been forgotten. She looked a little rough, like she had jsut gotten dressed and dragged herself to work, a little fluff of the hair and cold water on the face would've been nice. So not the most attentive server, she seemed like she may have been on a cigarette break for mst of the evening. \nThe food:\nwe started with the salumi platter it was delicious, loved all the cured in house meat selection. we also had the hamachi fennel crudo. it had a such potential but fell short with the large amount of sea salt on top, whaaaa mouth full of saltiness, and the pool of olive oil on the plate was over kill. Next the raddichio salad, the two types of raddichio nice but alas one was extremely bitter and the parmesan and croutins couldn't cut through that.\nFor pasta we shared the angiotti pasta first filled with veal sugo and nettle ricotta gnochi, both fantastic flavors, the gnochi was wonderful melted in your mouth, one drawback to both the dishes were they were barely luke warm, chilled almost. Had our server been around and not on her break i would have sent it back. unfortunatey she never reappeared till we were almost finished. \nwe also shared the braised short rib entree, it was also only luke warm but the parsnip puree i believe it was, maybe celery root, was steaming hot. The flavors were very nice.\nFor dessert we shared the pistachio panna cotta and the trio of gelatos. the pistachio panna cotta different to say the least, it took a second to want to try it, the color kind of scares you away, it looks like and experiment more than a dessert. it was a deep swamp green color, the flavor grew on me after a couple of bites and  i liked the compotes, blodd orange segments and kumquat compote.\nthe gelatos, great, but again there was this sea salt thing on the caramel flavor, slow down there big guy with all the extra salt. a small amount to compliment would've been just fine, why'd ya have to go overboard and overkill. Overall i would go back, the food has shown to be good and the pricing reasonable. Hopefully you don't get the haggard server.", "author": "amy T."}

This was our first time to Perbacco and will not be the last.  The dining room is modern and you could carry on a conversation with your table, but there was a general buzz (i.e. not a quiet dinner spot)\n\nWe sat at the bar waiting for friends to show up.  It's always nice to have bartenders that give you a chance to taste before you decide on a wine.  Also, watching them slice up their house cured meats made that a must try for dinner.\n\nDinner started with the Salumi Misti (house selection of cured meats) which also came with a great country style pate.\n\nWe then proceeded to split 4 appetizers:  I would definitely recommend the veal and tuna sauce (delicious, must try traditional dish).  The sardine dish we ordered was good, but a fairly small portion relative to the other dishes.\n\nWe actually decided not to have a main, instead splitting 3 pastas to save room for dessert.  The Tarjin (hand cut tagliatelle which is like a flat spaghetti) and papardelle were delicious.  \n\nThere was not a dish that we did not like.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-01", "description": "3.5 stars\n\nPerbacco and I have a complex relationship. On one hand, it's ingredients are fresh and local and taste awesome. Some of the individual dishes I've had there are best in category (see short ribs below). Yet, I've felt at times like I'm intaking food from a rail gun (see salumi plate below), or there's just an item that's off...\n\nBread and butter:\n- Bread: for a high-caliber Italian place, your bread is passable, but it's nothing to write home about. It's not very chewy and tastes a bit dry. I think the density is the main issue--there's to much air and too many air pockets that make the bread not enjoyable on its own. However, it does soak in sauces well, and most of your meat and pasta dishes have sauces that are simply divine. This bread + shortrib sauce + my mouth = happiness. \n\n- Butter: high-five for room temperature butter, but needs salt. \n\nAppetizers:\n\n- SALUMI MISTI - I ordered a small, and this could feed 4 people. It was pleasant and a nice snack with bread, but nothing stood out as being terribly distinctive. One of the salumi items tasted like raw, ground meat, which was slightly off-putting. I don't know if the issue is even with the plate--Italian cured meats are categorically inferior to Spanish Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. (As a plug, the BEST cured meat I've ever had is the 5-yr old ham from Brindisa in Borough Market, London; pretty good manchego and membrillo too)\n\n- Goose salad (ordered to-go) - 5-slices of goose breast over some arugula for $22? Are you kidding me? Say hello to my little friend, the log of dining disappointments\n\nMains:\n\n- PAPPARDELLE (WIDE PASTA RIBBONS / SLOW COOKED SHORT RIB RAGU / ROASTED CIPOLLINE / GRATED HORSERADISH) - wow, this was a solid pasta dish with really fresh homemade pasta and awesome short ribs on the inside. The technique was flawless and the texture was al-dente chewy and gorgeously umami-rich and buttery. Would suggest putting a touch more salt in the sauce. Only note on presentation is that it was a little messy and felt more like a home-cooked meal (which I'll take any day over wow-factor presentation at the expense of flavor)\n\n- BEEF SHORT RIB STRACOTTO (ROOT VEGETABLE PASSATINA / CAVOLO NERO / HONEY GLAZED CIPOLLINE AND CARROTS) - this baby came out and my jaw dropped. I was literally mid-conversation with the guy next to me at the bar, and I just stopped talking while my mouth went into epileptic shock. The smell envelops your head in a cloud of charred meat, tobacco and browned butter flavors. I talked to the bartender and he mentioned that the meat cooks for a 3 hours at 120 degrees, making the entire piece of Niman Ranch boneless short rib fall apart as soon as you touch it. Fat and meat juices were so well distributed throughout the short rib that I hesitated every time I touche it with a fork. I just wanted to admire this (large) piece of short rib perfection. The purple, white and orange carrots and other baby winter root vegetables elevated the plating to a stratospheric level. I'm not kidding when I say this is perfect plate of food. I could have this once a week for the rest of my life, and I would be a happy camper. I cannot emphasize enough how good this particular dish is--of all the deliciously memorable dishes I've had in my lifetime, this easily ranks in the top 10. \n\nDesserts:\n\n- MEYER LEMON PANNA COTTA (HUCKLEBERRY COMPOTE / ROSEMARY SHORTBREAD) - technically perfect preparation of panna cotta, though I wasn't 100% set on the compote. The compote's texture was a bit too stiff for this dish and tended to stick to my fork as I ate the panna cotta. \n\nIn short: check this place out. It's a fun place to go with friends, prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service. The selection of Italian wines is off the charts and the short rib dish is the best preparation of short rib I've ever had in my life. P.s. $20 corkage!", "author": "Alex W."}

We were taking some clients out and was able to manage a large table in the upper room... literally in the back cave.  Our party came sporadically (i.e. not on time) and so we sorta ordered bits and pieces here and there.  The coppa di testa (warm pig head terrine) was really good... and even some of the naysayers at the table gave it a nod of approval.   The other appetizers were just okay (the hamachi crudo, scallops, fritto misto and one other dish that didn't quite make it down to my end of the table)... ditto for the pasta.... tagliatelle with pork ragu, some ravioli dish were just 'Oh hum' at best.  Then my entree, the house made sausage, took the longest to prepare, yet once I took the first bite, the middle of it was cold... so I had to ask to reheat the thing.   Desserts were not spectactular, even borderline flat... we sampled five different dessert items and not one jumped out at you.  The ice cream sampler, the 'ugly' hazelnut cookies, the meyer lemon semifreddo... I've had better elsewhere.\n\nAnd the wine list... it's a large selection and mainly all Italian varietals... there were some Napa selection... and the price was very reasonable all around.\n\nI guess the thing is... Italian cuisine is readily available and there plenty of good Italian eateries in the city that it's hard to find a place that just blows everything else out of the water.  I felt like this with Perbacco.

There were just too many things on the menu that I wanted to try again. Perbacco definitely has one of the best charcuterie platters that I've had in the city (even slightly better than Incanto, who make there own salumi). Get the chef's selection or assorted platter. They also have a mortadella or salumi one but if you get the selection, you get a little bit of everything. They have loads of appetizers but you can't leave without trying some of their handmade pastas. They offer most of them in small or large plates if you just want to have a taste. The papardelle and tagliatelle with pork sugo or short rib ragu were the best things on the menu! The pork shoulder and short rib entrees are the highlights of the main courses. I've gotten both and wasn't that impressed with the pork shoulder. Although they say it is slow braised, it's not as tender as you'd expect. The short rib is sooo delicious though! Juicy, tender, and so flavorful. It comes with a celery root puree that you can sop up all the beef juices with.\n\nWine list is also fairly extensive and reasonable. Check with the sommelier though...not all the waiters appear to be too knowledgeable. The ambience of this place is great. It's got a rustic yet modern feel to it and filled with great energy.

My appetizer was some kind of soft, sweet, mild, creamy cheese with black truffle \"salsa\" served with toasted bread  and arugula.  It was the perfect palate whetter.  Made me wonder what else was in store.  My main course was a ricotta-gnocci with some kind of asparagus sauce.  It was very simple, a beautiful color, and delicious.  To top off the meal I had the most exciting dessert--get this--polenta cake with olive oil gelato.  To finish off the plate, olive oil was drizzled around the plate along with a bright red rhubarb sauce.  It looked so much like tomato sauce that I was dying of curiosity about how it would taste.  I was very surprised at how well the flavors blended together in my mouth.  I can't stop thinking about my meal there and I can't wait to return!

We had reservations at 8:45pm, but showed up slightly early to grab a drink at the bar. When we walked in, it was pretty crowded. Well, it was in the financial district and on a Friday night. After getting our drinks at the bar, we had a lil trouble finding a comfotable spot to stand since waiters/waitresses and customers were all around and walking back and forth. I guess that was one thing I didn't like about my experience here.\nAnyways, about 20 mins later, we got seated. One interesting thing I noticed right away was the menu is dated and I'm sure everyday they have something different on the menu. That's pretty cool. I was looking at the wine list and had a few questions, so they sent over a \"wine-expert\" to answer my questions and he gave me a few wines to taste before ordering. The entree I ordered was the Sea Bass and my friend got the Rabbit.....yea i said Rabbit. I personally can never eat rabbit only cuz my cousins used to have 2 when I was younger and the thought of eating rabbit makes me think of their rabbits. Anyways, the Sea bass was yum!! It was very tender and juicy, if you like fish or even if you don't, I recommend ordering that or giving it a try. My friend really enjoyed his rabbit too. He said it tasted like juicy chicken breast. Sounds good, but still not for me. The waiters/waitresses are very nice and the whole ambiance of the restaurant was wonderful.

Nice big slices of golden and red beets, again well seasoned.  \n\nTajarin pasta: cheesy, meaty, thin pasta.  Yum!  \n\npaparadelle: THE HIGHLIGHT.  Nice short rib meat, big belts of pasta ... all I can really think to say is NOM NOM NOM.\n\nBrown butter cake: it was good, but not my favorite.  If you are a chocolate fiend (I am not), I think you would enjoy this more than me, because of the chocolate ganache they place on top. \n\nThe people at Perbacco were so accommodating, they got us a high chair and then a regular chair for a baby seat (although it's not really a baby place, I do not recommend for them), and a table that was a bit quieter upstairs as opposed to one downstairs.  Also, because we shared everything, they divided the pastas for us and put it onto plates for each of us.  Great attentive service!

I had requested an upstairs table (thanks Yelp!) so that it would be a little more intimate.  It was really loud at the front, but as you walk away from the bar towards the tables it gets quieter by decibels, so even if you don't eat upstairs, your eardrums shouldn't be overly assaulted by the end of your meal.  \n\nConsidered the salume plates, but when asked, the waitress indicated that it was a lot of food and would be more suitable for a larger party.  We instead started with the octopus which she got her approval.  Not squeamish by any means about consuming cephalopods, but traditionally Octopus is not a personal favorite.  In this case, it was excellent.  Great texture, nice smokey flavor (and low carb).  Next was the Pork Sugo with Tagliatelle.  I can see how some might liken the tagliatelle to ramen.  Both are thin and curly and very light to the teeth.  Even the Sweetie made a comparison, but being of Ramen heritage seemed to take to it quite fine.  He liked it and I did, too!  The flavor of the pork sugo was hearty, complex and almost lusty.  The tagliatelle was very delicate.  We were warming up now.  \n\nFor main course I was deliberating between the duck and the quail, but leaning towards the duck.  Waitress indicated that the quail was special, so quail it was.  Sweetie went with rabbit.   The quail was amazing.  Very filling, but struck all the right notes.  The truffle-oiled polenta was so light and creamy, and the grapes were very sweet with just enough tang to offset the richness of the quail.  The quail was super tender.  And ladies, don't worry about making a mess trying to eat a bony bird at dinner.  The waitress dissected the bird in half and just when I was ready for the next half she showed up in time (I think she was waiting in the wings) to serve me.  It pretty much fell off the bone, either that or the waitress took care of most of the major bones before serving me.  Either way, it wasn't an issue.  Also, the little birdy was stuffed with sausage.  Can't go wrong there! The Sweetie liked his rabbit, but I think he liked the quail at tad more.  He eagerly consumed the rest of my quail  when I couldn't quite finish it.   Did try his rabbit and must say it was quite tender and juicy.  Often my experience with rabbit is that it has a tendency to be dry.  \n\n For dessert we had the nectarine thingy.  Very delicious.\n\nBTW, had informed the restaurant when making reservations that we were celebrating the Sweetie's birthday and it seemed like everyone was wishing him a happy birthday.  They even presented him a hand written birthday card at the start of dinner and spelled his name correctly.     \n\nAs for service.  Excellent. Our waitress made excellent recommendations, was very nice, super attentive without being overbearing, no hint of  haughtiness, and never hovered.  We had at  4 people attending to us throughout our meal, anticipating our every need, and yet we never for a second felt intruded upon.   We had an excellent experience. \n\nOne of my most pleasurable dining experiences in a very long time.  Strongly recommended.", "author": "K K."}

Our spirits soon faded upon arrival of the Fritto Misto of Rock shrimp which was a heavily fried collection artifacts that we thought we could have done much better at home (it was real oilly). Our risotto was also a disappointment  due to its very heavy flavoring. Finally, our roasted fennel had no fennel scent.  Considering our high expectations I am going to grade severely. Perhaps other items on their menu are done better or perhaps the menu is just not in tune with our taste preferences (not too keen on heavy, rich foods).", "author": "Robert M."}

Service was excellent, knowledgeable and very friendly (our waiter told us stories of the guy they keep in the basement making the grissini placed on the table instead of bread, with a nice salsa cruda - AWESOME grissini - we went thru 3 plates of those in the first 10 minutes.  i lived in Italy for 5 months and never had better).  very crowded and noisy, but a beautiful, airy space.  But because it's so noisy, and huge, it feels a tad impersonal, not warm and cozy.  Ehh, that's a nit that doesn't need picking\n\nHere's what 3 of us ate last night:  Brandacujun --- salt cod/potato gratin/crostini - perfect balance of warm potato with crunchy browned top and salty cod; mozzarella di bufala/black truffle condimento/arugula/grilled pilone (a type of bread) - SOOOO GOOD.  So creamy soft, like melting jack cheese, but not warm, with the truffle and arugula, on the nicely charred bread - very heady; Coppa di testa - warm pig's head terrine!!  like rillettes, chopped up and then spread very thin into two disks, had a sweet, almost clove-y, cinnamon-y taste; this was a wow, and even tho my friend was put off by the fact it was pig's head, he loved it; carne cruda of vitallone/black truffle condimento/crostini - raw cute little baby veal (i have to get over this, i ate veal all over Italy - you almost can't get grown-up cow there!) of course was yummy, almost like the texture of ahi tuna tartare; fritto misto of rock shrimp/green beans/olives/meyer lemon/fennel/lemon aioli - very nice, light batter, olives were a nice tart touch in a rich dish like this; pappardelle/braised short rib ragu/roasted chanterelles - another rich dish - slow cooked, meaty, dark sauce, mixed in with big flat homemade noodles; fijian (!) swordfish/fingerling potatoes/chanterelles - better than the pappardelle even - tender and dense and flavorful.  dessert was a sort of chocolate tart with carmelized hazelnuts and some kind of polenta cake/vanilla ice cream/fruit coulis/with more carmelized hazelnuts - have to say dessert was a disappointment to me, but i'm not a huge dessert person.  my two companions liked it.  i thought the polenta cake was heavy (tho the waiter described it as light) and flavorless, and the chocolate thing was a bit dry, and hazelnuts are my least favorite nut.\n\nBut i have to say, overall, YUM.  We shared everything and were completely, painfully stuffed.  We also had three bottles of prosecco, and our bill total was something like $210 before tip.  Then onto Aqua for 3 glasses of wine.

Once our waitress took our drink orders, it was at least another 10-15 minutes before she came back with the drinks. We asked several questions, and she left to give us a few minutes to decide - which in the land of Perbacco is more like 15 minutes. Based on her recommendations, we had the following:\n\nApps - the burrato cheese with heirloom tomatoes on filone bread was ridiculously delicious. Literally ridiculous. The hamachi was also good, but the gnocchi overwhelmingly tasted like asparagus and wasn't good at all. And I generally love gnocchi.\n\nMain course - the pork loin was delicious and moist. The duck was surprisingly lean and much lighter than duck I had before - also very good. My dish was unfortunately a major disappointment. I ordered the beef short ribs based on the server's rave reviews and received about 10 ounces of beef fat with 2 ounces of gritty meat. This was surrounded by a sea of peas, one of the few vegetables I despise, and a couple of carrots and potatoes. \n\nDessert - Since the service was so, so slow, we passed. \n\nDrinks - I had prosecco and ordered a second glass which never came. But the first glass was very good. My friends ordered the Perbacco cocktail, wanted another, but were never given the chance to order another.\n\nThe food is generally good, but not consistent. Our server was friendly and sensitive to my food allergies, but seemed overwhelmed with too many tables. From start to finish, it took almost two and half hours for a two course meal. Simply too slow.\n\nPerbacco is a good place to go sit at the bar for drinks and apps. If you want to sit down for a meal - go to A16. The menus are strangely similar, but the service at A16 is FAR better, the food is consistently good and the prices are well worth it.", "author": "Rachelle P."}

Our group had two tables set aside in a secluded area that was pretty stark and had poor lighting, so we missed out on the chic decor of the main dining area.  Other than this fact, Perbacco was great.  We had a four-course menu with perfect portion sizes.  My favorite dish was the pesto flavored pasta with small asparagus cuts.  I've never had such tender noodles; they were clearly homemade.  I also loved the seared scallops with a mushroom sauce - I wish I had looked at the menu more closely so I could remember the other outstanding components of the sauce.  The berry crumble dessert was tasty, but I so wanted to order one of the other decadent Italian desserts off the menu.

With Terje gone from Scala, San Francisco lost a great chef in downtown dining options. As for a downtown restaurant without the extras offered by a French Laundry, it's as good as you get or would want.\n\nIt was impossible to get into Perbacco right after it opened..which may explain some of the bad reviews. A new restaurant is often overwhelmed, while the staff is still being trained. You should not expect perfection if you go in the first few weeks. We didn't even try. \n\nI had an opportunity to eat at Perbacco family style - four people sharing almost everything on the menu - after the post opening rush. I found:\n1) The food was excellent. Not exquisite, but it is not intended to be Campton Place or the Fifth Floor. All of it very tasty and well presented.\nNothing pretentious or overly composed. The foods have a slight rustic element, which I find pleasant.\n2) The service non memorable, which means just fine. I only remember bad service.\n3) The bill acceptable. \n\nThe only unfortunate thing is that it is located in a nest of similarly priced restaurants which offer excellent food: Acqua, Palio and others, leaving those of us working closer to the Downtown Centre with Scala, Kuletto or the Grand Cafe, all of which have slipped considerably in the past year, or Lark Creek Steak - which is excellent, but you don't always want to eat that hearty.", "author": "Otto S."}

We ordered the salumi and it was an awesome way to start the meal.  I had the hamachi crudo which was excellent, but my wife's tagliatelle with 5 hr pork sugo was ridiculously flavorful.  I also got to taste a small bite of the roasted octopus and that was well cooked and not at all rubbery or tasteless.  For entrees, I devoured my short rib (braised short rib with bone marrow crust?!  what's not to like?).  However, my wife and I felt her quail filled with foie was somewhat mushy; I'd expect the foie to be soft, but the quail really didn't have a nice consistency to it.  I also was expecting the dish to be awesome, but it was kinda bland.  Lastly, our orders kept getting messed up all night.  The right orders came to our table, but the waiters kept giving the wrong dishes to the wrong diner.  They even gave my Fernet Branca to my wife!  Place is definitely popular on a Saturday night and loud, but we had a nice round table in the back on the second floor.

The first occasion was a lunch to celebrate a few co-workers' birthdays.  We were seated upstairs on the mezzanine, which was quite chilly when we arrived.  The service was pretty slow considering that people are usually in a bigger rush at lunchtime.  I started with a golden & red beets appetizer, which was yummy and refreshing.  For the main course, I had the Ligurian style pesto, which was freshly made pasta, pesto, potatoes, and green beans.  My fiance's family makes this dish, so I was very excited to see this on the menu.  It was tasty, but a little too salty.  Lunch was accompanied by an unbelievably good focaccia.  I could have eaten baskets full of it.  I'm generally not super excited about bread, but this stuff was amazing!\n\nMy second outing to Perbacco was for dinner, this time with 13 co-workers.  This time we were seated downstairs.  I was surprised by the seating arrangement.  One side of the table was along the booth-like wall.  That meant that those of us in the center on that side were completely trapped there.  I don't know if there was a heater under the seat or what, but everyone on that side was sweating when we left.  It was so damn hot (and I only had a sip of wine!)  We had 8 different bottles of wine on our table - 4 white and 4 red.  I was really impressed by the service in this respect.  The waiters poured the wine throughout the evening and gave us as many different glasses for it as we wanted.  The service overall was much better at dinner than it was at lunch.  I was very disappointed to find rolls as the dinner bread.  I really wanted that focaccia again!  For dinner I had the spring garlic gnocchi with asparagus sauce.  It was really, really yummy.  I would definitely order that dish again.  I had some dessert this time too - lemon panna cotta - super delicious!\n\nWhile I think they have some atmospheric problems in here, the food is just fabulous.

This was the best service I've ever received anywhere - it was so much fun! 5 stars given the impeccable service, excellent food, and the use of locally farmed foods.\n\nThe service:\nWe arrived about 20 minutes early, and stood next to the bar sipping on cocktails. Just as we are mid-way through our first drink, a lady comes up to us and asks if we are \"ready for the next portion of our evening.\" She takes our drinks on a tray and leads us to a wonderful corner table in the back of the restaurant - it was perfect. I am clueless about wine menus, and ask our waitress to suggest a white wine, she offers her favorite and gives me a taste - it is exactly what I want. We also went along with her appetizer, red wine, and dessert suggestions as the meal progressed. She seemed more than happy to oblige our requests, and was never irritated by our questions.\n\nThe food:\nWhen you arrive they give you crunchy breadsticks with pesto dip, a bread roll, and butter - I wasn't crazy about the pesto dip, and the bread roll was cold and hard. From here on everything was delicious. We started with the chef's choice of salumi, which was an interesting array of choices plus pork pate - between my boyfriend and I we managed to find which salumi's we like and finish off the plate. We followed that with tomato/bread salad and gnocchi - the tomatoes and gnocchi were both delicious, but the bread of the bread salad was just mushy cold bread. By this point we were drunk and full, but we still had the duck and ribeye entree dishes - both were delicious and the sides with these dishes were yummy as well. Finally we finished with the almond cake - very unusual and tasting dense little cake with candied saffron and ice cream. We finished happy, full, and grateful for an amazing evening.", "author": "Corinne R."}

Unfortunately this week's visit rated 2 stars. We sat in a booth in the bar area (generally my favorite location) and ordered lots of small plates and a lovely bottle of wine for a bill that totalled about $230. My BF got mushroom risotto with pancetta (that's how it was described in the menu). What arrived was mushroom risotto with two large (3\"x3\") slabs of what seemed to be raw pork belly/fat on top. The risotto had no pork or meat flavor to it - it was good, but there was no connection to the weird \"topper\". My BF and I are by no means vegetarians and neither are we squeamish - especially him, not at all - and we both found the \"meat\" to be truly disgusting. When our very perky server checked on us, we expressed disappointment/concern and her response was \"yeah, usually the pancetta is small, cooked and within the risotto, but I guess the chef wanted to something a little edgier tonight\". And then she giggled and popped away. \"Edgier\"? Raw, large slabs of light pink fat? How about \"grosser\"?. \nIt was so revolting that neither of us could eat anything else - my veal tartare was untouched as a result. \nMy complaint was not as much with the food - there some things that I/we don't like - so be it - no big deal. But the fact that the server did not seem at all concerned that we didn't like it, that she didn't notice or care that we stopped eating and didn't touch large plates of food after it arrived, that she didn't even ask \"was there something wrong with the tartare?\" or when we expressed dissatisfaction with the risotto \"can I bring you something else?\" etc etc - you get what I mean... \nWe were having a large, fairly expensive meal at a very nice, upscale restaurant and our server was either clueless and/or completely insensitive to our satisfaction. Extremely disappointing - the experience will seriously make me question whether to go back, which is too bad. \nThe place is pretty, the food is often tasty and the wine list is very special - largely Italian, which I don't know well at all, but the sommeliers are extremely helpful - they have always helped me find things I like (which is no small challenge) - they are truly great.

The pastas were over the top scrumptious - truffle herbed ricotta gnocchi were delicate pillows of yumminess, the butternut squash lune were delicate, earthly goodness in a light sage butter. The lamb was delectable, perfectly prepared and served with a basil/parsley tapenade of sorts. The desserts were on par with the rest of the menu - inventive balances of flavors - spice cake with pomegranate, trio of flavorful gelatos. Refined Northern Italian flavors, with a focus on market freshness. Service was great; the right balance of attentiveness and fabulous recommendations.

I was dying for the salumi misti, but quickly realized that I alone could not finish it, let alone try anymore food.  At the chef-guy's suggestion, I went for the CACCIATORINO SOTT'OLIO, a very rich hunter's salame--excellent for $7, almost filloing me up.  The bartender suggested a good red wine, which also was a good value.  I opted to get the Hamachi, which was very fresh and well-preapred with fennel and blood orange.  A sprinkle of sea salt brought out the buttery flavor.\n\nFor my main course, I went for the pappardella with short rib ragu.  You have to be in the mood for a very rich, sweet meal to appreciate this, and I was, even though I could have stopped at the salame and been satiated.

I noticed quite a number of folks around us also ordered the dish, a flat noodle with tomato sauce and pulled pork. The duck breast for the main course was perfect. \n\nThe wine list is goes on for ever.  Lots of italian wines but an excellent choice from.   Many bottles priced in the $40-$80 range.  Wines also came in a 500 ml carafe, great where half bottles are too little and full bottles too much. The waiter seeinghow interested I was in knowing about italian wines gave me a great introduction.  Where I was unsure about a wine he brought \"sipping\" samples until I found one I enjoyed.\n\nAs if this was not enough the ricotta cake incredibly rich yet not at all heavy sent us to heaven.", "author": "Bill P."}

What we consider mediocre is probably magnificent elsewhere and our magnificent is orgasmic almost anywhere else. So, is Perbacco's food magnificent? Probably not by our twisted standards, but it is very good. What makes this place great, though, is the overall experience. In a previous life, I worked in restaurants and one axiom is that great service can make up for not-so-great food, but great food will not make up for bad service. At Perbacco you get good food, but you also get great service (and usually with an accent). I have always felt very taken care of and very appreciated as a patron here.

I understand why this restaurant is on some of the best lists in SF, The service is stellar and food is scrumptious but I think Oenotri in Napa is giving Perbacco some stiff competition. I came her last month with my sister and we shared a bunch of things, all delish. I recommend the pasta sampler or salumi plate. We also ordered the veal tartar, which was strangely chewy and had a gummy texture, not good! I'm a fan of ordering items  that you normally couldn't make yourself so the homemade pasta's don't disappoint. I seem to remember the riccotta meyer lemon gnocchi and a veal stuffed ravioli. We also ordered the brussel sprouts which were super good but can easily be re created at home.

The meal overall was amazing but it was a little too heavy on the butter and oil.  It's a personal preference thing.\nI'm not a huge fan of Italian food and pasta in general but I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here consisting of 5 small pasta dishes, one main, 2 appetizers, and 4 desserts (we like sugar).  The hamachi was delicious but nothing spectacular.  The salt cod, crab, golden yolk appetizer with the fennel and arugula salad was delicious but how could anyone go wrong with creamy egg yolk and something that resembled a cross between a latke and crabcake?  the chard, herb, and ricotta ravioli topped with walnut oil were delicious and were followed by some pouchy pasta filled with veal (i cried a little for the baby cow and then got over it because it was so good).  We had another pouchy pasta filled with rabbit and truffle oil, and thought to myself, \"eating these little guys is better than sex.\"  The lamb was cooked perfectly in my opinion (dining partner would have liked to see it a little more rare).  The last pasta dish had wide pasta with chanterells and some beef ragu.  T'was my least favorite dish.  Tasted like high-end cafeteria food...just not that great.  Melon sorbet was my favorite dessert.  The chocolate mousse, ugly cookies, and apple  tart were good, but you could imagine when they'd taste like.  No need for me to 'splain.\nAs far as ambiance and service...Boss-man and I were seated at a lovely corner table (prime table for people watching, my favorite pastime) and received excellent service.  The plates were coursed two at a time as we requested and were set at a good pace.  I also love the feel of the restaurant.  It's elegant but not at all stuffy.  it's lively with the bustle of people chatting and it's bright enough inside for me to see what i'm eating...and of course to people watch aka find hot men and rape them with my eyes...\noh one last comment.

Initially we felt really out of place in the middle of the midwestern-Denny's-style upstairs dining room - a bunch of loud, high women surrounded by the staid and wealthy elderly crowd - but the servers were amazingly welcoming and gracious and responsive to our whoops of delight over the flavor extravaganza.  We brought a bottle of wine with us, but it needed to be decanted, so we ordered a half-liter.  The lovely sommelier came over and said that if we just got the whole bottle instead of the half liter, it would actually save us money because then the corkage would be waived on the bottle we brought.  That was so thoughtful!  And although she reminded us we could bring our leftover wine with us, we ended up drinking it all anyway!\nThe pork chop with the pomegranate was spectacular - there was something so rich and fatty (in a good way) about it, it felt like we were eating the soul of the pig.  The other truly outrageous item we freaked out over was the \"chocolate cake\", which was not chocolate cake, but a plate of different chocolate concoctions of varied flavors and textures.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-01-07", "description": "We were treated kindly, maybe a bit over eagerly by the waiter, who was friendly, but interrupted our conversations a few times too often asking if everything was okay.\nThe food was very mixed: We had the raw scallops and raw hamachi appetizers, and though the fish tasted good, it was quite horrendously overpriced. There were four translucent slices of scallop on the plate, and a few pieces of an herb - definitely not the promised arugula - which made each paper thin slice cost three dollars. The hamachi portion was a wee bit more generous, but only by an ounce or two.\nWith the main courses you also have to expect that if you order the smaller portion, it will be really small. The agnolotti with veal were very tasty, the short rib sauce that comes with the papardelle is excellent too, but the papardelle themselves were not very well cooked, too al dente, and still sticky.\nOur friends ordered the grilled squid as starter and the pear salad. The squid was great, and the salad quite good. Our friends' risotto also tasted good, and the sole was nice and the only dish where we felt the portion size matched the price.\nWe were also very satisfied with the desserts: a lemon semifreddo, and a squash crostata with fennel gelato.\nAll in all it was a pleasant dining experience, but we felt that even though the individual price attached to each dish is not too bad, looking back at the quality of the food as well as the amounts you get, it still felt over prized.", "author": "Ursula S."}

I came here for lunch with my sister and we started off with the salumi and beet salad. The salumi was a good sized appetizer to share. It was pretty standard (and hard to screw up, so long as you knew how to use a deli slicer): mortadella, coppa, salami, prosciutto, etc. The beet salad was great. The beets were sweet and the dressing gave it a good contrast. The pork shoulder with polenta was ok. I'll admit, it looked kind of funny when it came out and had this creamy, brown gravy over the meat. I figured that was the \"al latte\" part of the dish name \"Berkshire pork shoulder al latte\". I can't say I've had a perfectly round and boneless piece of pork shoulder before, but I decided not to dwell on that thought. All in all the meal was average. Perhaps I'll try the pasta dish next time.", "author": "David S."}

I liked the hard bread sticks and pesto to start, but the bread rolls that came after were too hard for my liking and I had trouble cutting it with the provided knife- my cousin had a second one and said that batch was marginally softer.  The potato gnocchi with a veal ragu was very tasty and the highlight of my meal- this may tempt me to come back.  Not too salty and just the right texture.  My beet salad was ok- a little bland. They give you little dessert finishers before your bill- not exactly sure what they were since i had stepped away when they were served.\n\nTable service was average, but still professional.  Nothing stood out especially good or bad.  Neither myself or my cousin liked the suggested wines for our meals, but since neither of us are very familiar with italian wines in the by he glass selection it is half our fault:-) They did let my cousin check his suitcase as he was leaving for the airport directly after.\n\nThe atmosphere.  it looked really nice when i came in, but the longer i was there the less i liked it.  The tables were too close.  Being taken to our table the waitress had to ask two different diners to move in so we could get to our table.  The same difficulty existed when trying to get out to go the bathroom- I had to squeeze through.  I'm not sure if we just got the worst table in the whole place or if other tables are similar- I didn't see any reviews mentioning this so I thought I would mention it.  I felt like i was sitting with the table next to us.  We were also right near one of the support columns that seemed to contrast with the vibe of the other furniture- dark wood chairs/modern looking space- it made me feel even more crowded.  My other complaint was the bathrooms- I think a bit of this has to do with the space they got- but the paint on the walls was a weird brown and was chipping on the way to the bathroom and it seemed like the stairs were also used for entry and exit of supplies as it was a little industrial.  The bathrooms themselves didn't feel very clean- especially the floor.  For a place that is trying to be so nice it just seemed weird.\n\nI won't be rushing back, but I may give it a second try at some point.  The tall table at the back near the kitchen looked nice for a big group- lots of room.  Hopefully next time a more pleasant experience...", "author": "Maria F."}

I had read sample Perbacco menus and reviews, saw that it was heavy on the meat, esp. processed meats, so I wasn't expecting much. There were 2 entree choices for our party - either filet mignon or scallops - and I picked the latter. What came out was as follows: bread sticks - nice, but I'm not a stick fan. There was some sort of tasty dip, perhaps a chimichurri, to dip them into, and that gave them a little flavor. Next, real bread. Delicious, soft with a good crust, and fresh butter. The salad was mixed greens - arugula, radicchio, and endive.  Tiny granules of salt and pepper sparkled on the tongue - a nice effect, but sprinkled a little too generously for my taste. I would have preferred more vinegar in the vinaigrette. The scallops were huge and perfectly cooked - charred on each side of the \"coin\" and soft in the middle. The sauce was a demiglace or reduction, scattered with corn kernels, sauteed slices of wild mushroom, and little nubbins of something else - perhaps fennel. So good I had to sop it up with my bread.  Dessert was divine panna cotta with a mixed berry sauce. I don't know whose Pinot Gris I had, but I'm sure it had no effect on my judgment :) I'll be back soon to try the other dishes.

I thought the burrata cheese was OK.  A16 does it way better.  There it is so soft and served very simply w/salt and olive oil on great toasted bread.  I thought the Perbacco version was an interesting combo (with the red pepper) but the cheese itself was on the tougher side and the bread it came with was just not up to snuff.   The appetizer that was incredible was the albacore crudo.  OMG.  Explosion of flavor and nice kick of salt.  I will be back for this.  I had the papardelle in short rib sauce.  I thought it was great.  Warm and rich on a rainy night.  perfect.  Then we ordered the chocolate mouse cake or something like that and it was disappointing.  I didn't care for it.  Kinda dry and just nothing special.  We also got the \"ugly\" piedmont cookies and those were GREAT.  I wanted a dozen to go.  We sat up on the balcony.  We all enjoyed ourselves and although every dish didn't hit, I will be very glad to go back for a cocktail and more crudo.\n\nUPDATE:  Ate a late lunch here today and it was stellar.  the arugula salad w/fennel, orange and marcona almonds was perfect.  also had the pansotti in brown butter.  very good, but had better in italy.  had the radish greens too and they were perfect - tender and flavorful.  then dessert.  oh.  my.  god.  had the carmel bonet (new on the menu) w/apricot compote and carmel sauce.  had it with a glass of vin santo and it was absolutely perfect.  incredible.  just amazing.  once again, giving it 4 out of 5 stars.  service was very very good - relaxed and personal.  of course it was an odd hour and not many other diners, but still just great hostess, waiter and owner, were very attentive.", "author": "Celia S."}

My husband enjoyed some extremely well made Limonata Scozzeses by bartender Steve (his own creation!).  It was so nice and relaxing at the bar drinking some really good drinks, we decided to order some apps.  We went with the olives and the parmesian cheese plate.  Both were delicious.

At one point my 3 dinnermates had their plates in front of them and I had nothing for a few minutes (before we could flag someone down).

The wood paneling is cut poorly, the edges don't meet, the stainless steel corner gaurds don't come up to the top, and then they just secured it all with huge bolts right through the finish wood. it looks like a job someone's drunk uncle would do in cheap basement redesign. and it is directly at eye level! soooo shoddy! i realize it's not about the food, but it's like the age-old clean bathroom theory... if a place can't get those small details right, what's going on in the kitchen?\n\nmy cocktail was terrible (frisson ruined me)... way too sweet with no flavor but vodka and sugar with a sugar rim. and some sugar. oh, and did i mention it had sugar? first thing they tell us is that there's no more burrata which is the one thing i really wanted. watercress salad was fine. watercress and ricotta salata with o+v. maybe .50cents worth of product on the plate for $9.00. what is that, like a 450% mark up? \n\nthen we tried to order wine but i am not knowledgeable about italian wines and these are far and away the bulk of what they have. the sommelier came over, but he had such a thick accent i really could not follow what he was saying. granted that was my problem, so i just got a glass of cab (and the waitress did nicely swap it for my unpalatable cocktail.) but it would really help to have the wine menu broken up into some categories like \"big reds\", \"dry whites\", etc.\n\nfor dinner i had risotto which was also just fine. nothing exciting or out of the ordinary in any way, shape or form. the risotto i had a few months back at chez spencer... that was extraordinary! my bf ordered rabbit or something (probably the real reason i was pissed at him - how can  you sit down and order thumper's cousin with your vegetarian girlfriend?) anyway, she brought one dish and after he took a couple bites she comes back and said she ordered him the wrong thing. she takes the plate and leaves him with nothing while we wait for his main dish. i've worked in a lot of restaurants, and usually it's polite if it's your fuck up to just let the customer enjoy what you brought them while their correct dish is cooked. it's not like someone else was going to be able to eat it after my boyfriend already started it. and of course i was finished by the time his came. and no, we did not even get a free scoop of gelato for that.\n\nwe did order 2 desserts - i always like to give a place a chance up until the very end. the panna cotta was not very good - it was not nearly as rich or nicely tectured as many in the city ( it is as chic as molten chocolate cake at this point), though it did have a good cookie with it. the coffee custard w/ chocolate crust was quite good, but the best part of the meal was certainly the sambucca. too bad perbacco didn't have anything to do with that, or they might have gotten another star.", "author": "eva g."}

Our meal consisted of one outstanding dish and four good ones. I was disappointed. We started with salumi ($12, two pieces of house cured salami) and it was good. Then we had the Testa, which is (baked?) pigs head. this was PHENOMENAL. and I am not normally an offal person, but fiance loves the shit so I indulged him. I ate it with my eyes closed so I could get rid of extra stimulus. That's how good it was. It had pickled onions on top and it tasted like warm, pickled heaven. At this point in our meal we were both quivering with excitement for things to come. Our next dish was the agnolotti (sp?) which was good. nothing spectacular. Then we had the pork shoulder. again, it was good. I actually don't remember what we had for dessert, so I guess that says it all for that dish. I'd like to try it again because people rave about it so much, but I'm beginning to think it's more the power of suggestion than the actual food.", "author": "Chaka K."}

Keep in mind i went to Quince the night before, which was an incredible meal, so i may be biased and anything i ate the next night might not have stood a chance. Overall just an ok place. Wine list is nice since you can select 1/4 and 1/2 liters rather than just glass or bottle. The mixed prosciutto/salami etc platter was a good sized serving for the price but nothing was that great. I had the beet salad which was also nothing special and the beets had something off about their taste. As an entree i tried the pork ragu pasta which, as a previous reviewer said, did kind of taste like hamburger helper..and the noodles tasted like runny ramen almost, and needed to be drained. My sister tried the rabbit agnolotti which was better than my pasta but still not memorable. The highlight was my mom's steak, which was surprisinglly good and had a great char. The waitress was also very friendly and helpful but unfortunately i wouldnt recommend this restaurant to any visitors to SF, maybe an ok choice for locals.", "author": "Sara B."}

It was melt in your mouth good and light for gnocchi.  I had the beef short ribs with mashed potatoes, peas and fancy mushrooms.  It was all delicious.  A knife wasn't needed and the sauce was amazing.  My friends has the heirloom tomato salad, beet salad, lamb and tagliatelle with pork sugo.  All were also amazing.  We each had a cocktail, 1 bottle of wine and two dishes each and we each paid $68.  I think that was quite a deal for what we got.  Also, they didn't rush us and the service was great.

Only a few doors down from Aqua, (one of my favorites in the city), I couldn't imagine that Perbacco could be better than the great seafood restaurant.  After scanning the menu, we decided to try the tuna tartare and tomato gnocchi.  The gnocchi was delicious and is probably one of the best I have ever tasted because of its puffiness and yummy sauce.  The tuna was okay (but Aqua's rendition is better).  For our main courses, we tried the halibut, swordfish, and hanger steak.  The two fish dishes were fresh and yummy, but the steak was SO tough.  I received a piece to try and was suprised when 1- I could barely cut the thing and 2-when I tasted it, I could barely chew and wanted to spit the piece across the table.  After taking that awful bite, we decided to tell the waiter.  I have NEVER complained, but the steak was nearly uneatable.  After many nice apologies, we decided to order a butterscotch pudding and a butterscotch ice cream which were mouth-watering and oh-so-good.  Overall, Perbacco was a plesant dining expereince, but I was not that impressed to visit it again.", "author": "Shannon W."}

Perfectly braised rib with Paperdelle pasta cooked al dente with a rich and delicious brown beef sauce was a great start to the night. For the main course I had the Halibut in a light broth which was also delicious.  However, I thought that the pasta was definitely the star of the night.

Not much other than to say that dinner last night at Perbacco was lovely!  The food was awesome and service was across the board attentive and gracious right from the front of the house to our server!  We were a party of three and requested a table upstairs and that is exactly what we received.  We started with three appetizers:  the AVIOLO FILLED WITH TRUFFLED RICOTTA, the FRITTO MISTO OF ROCK SHRIMP, and ROASTED D\"ANJOU PEAR SALAD.  The Aviolo was my absolute favorite.  The Fritto Misto was very light - perhaps a few too many fried olives for my liking.  For our main entree, we shared three pastas ($18 per person for the entire table).  We had the RABAT\u00d2N (TRUFFLE-HERB RICOTTA GNOCCHI / ROASTED MUSHROOM SUGO), the PACCHERI (LARGE PASTA TUBES with ALBACORE TUNA RAGU / TOMATO / CAPERS / CHILI PEPPER), and my usual favorite, the PAPPARDELLE with SHORT RIB RAGU.  My absolute favorite last night was the pasta with tuna.  I thought the portions were quite ample as well.  I probably would have preferred that we had the option to have the food served family style as opposed to pre-divided into three piles on a long rectangular plate. I think it would have been a bit warmer.  Also, as a person who now lives and works in the Peninsula, I loved the $10 valet parking as parking is impossible in the FIDI.  Even lukewarm, the pastas were delicious.  Sad to say we skipped dessert and coffee as we were stuffed!

We were a few minutes early for our table and rather than squishing into the bar area chose to bundle ourselves back out to the street.  Once we made it back to our table we found little respite from the noise.  A decent martini helped.  Menu-wise I found too much emphasis on pork dishes.  I like pork, so don't all pile on, please!  There is also an overemphasis on smoke flavor - note I say smoke flavor.  It wrecked for me an otherwise promising risotto dish.  Mushrooms, yes, some bits of bacon, yes, but then some smoke flavor from a jar infusing every bit of rice?  no.  Food portions are a bit small for the price so it looked like we were smart to order a selection of starters for the table.  My beets salad was very tasty.  I thought the wine list was interesting, but there are not a lot of values there.  We had a sangiovese blend for our starters and then a nice  barbera d'asti for the mains.

I had read this was one of the luminary italian meccas in SF and I couldn't have been more disappointed. Let me frame this - if I had walked in off the street and didnt know anything about Perbacco, I might have been surprised. But, ranking with the heavy hitters in SF ? No way.\nFirst off, the space sucks. Its noisy, crowded adn gives one the feel of a conference center and the smell of rank carpet. They sat us on the second floor under an exit sign. Since my wife refused to glow green all night we were given another table 10 feet away. Not much of an improvement.\nSecondly, the service was abyssmal. I lost count of the times my mind drifte to 'where the hell is our waiter' and I had to flag someone down more than thrice to get some attention. He would leave in mid sentence to handle something else, not to mention forgetting whole portions of our order. I'm not even going to go into his limited knowledge of the menu ( where he had to return to the kitchen three times to get questions answered ) - it was pretty pathetic for a ranked restaurant.\nThe food for the most part was mediocre - traditional plates done in an American style with little surprise or panache. The sea-bass was soggy, the paperdelle dry and the sugo sugary like a chinese to go. \nThe one savior was the older gentleman who acted as Sommellier - he reco'd some very interesting wines, and they turned out to be the highlite of the evening.\nOverall, would not go back. There are too many other restaurants that have to earn their clientelle. Sayonara Perbacco.", "author": "John J."}

Our server only cracked a smile, which all of us rated as 'fake' when we were presented with the bill.  We had to ask for the bread, although the server walked around us several times to make sure that the plates of the folks next to us were filled.  We tried a variety of appetizers (beets, shrimp, squid, cheese & tomato) and main courses (meatballs, sea bass and  chicken).  All of them were good, but none really stood out as great.

Overall, it wasn't bad, but it's not going to make the top of my list either. I had the mixed salad with lemon vinaigrette and butternut squash ravioli. The portions are quite good for a lunch menu. My colleague is a regular and noted that the prices have crept up slightly since they opened.  - I have no idea if that's true as it was my first time there. The salad was terrific and the pecorino cheese was delicious. Butternut squash ravioli is typically buttery, but this was just drowning in oil. It also was also bland compared to other places. The service was friendly but slow. We waited quite a while for the check, and then waited again for the waiter to pick up our credit card. He never did and we eventually had to ask a bus boy to take it to the register. I may come back to this place and give it another try, but I'm not in a hurry. It's 3.5 stars rounded down for Yelp.", "author": "Veggie S."}

The atmosphere is pretty lively, perhaps it was the lack of sound absorption on the walls/ceilings - but it definitely feels like a fun place.  Service was pretty slow, but it was okay since we weren't in a rush.  Food was very good - shared the burrata cheese (excellent on toasted baguette w/ arugula), beet salad (perfect, but it's difficult to mess up beets), fritto misto (excellently fried mix of rock shrimp, fennel, olives, onions, green beans), and pappardelle w/ short rib beef ragu (short rib was tender, pasta delicious, but the sauce could have used more oomph/flavor).  Desserts were good, not great.  Gelati (homemade - bittersweet chocolate and caramel fleur del sel were excellent, the pistachio nougat was interesting and made more for a conversation piece than good ole' dessert).  Pistachio panna cotta was unremarkable - although it could be due to my bias against panna cotta.  I'm definitely coming back!  Fun place for a date - even first date!", "author": "Christina S."}

Once we were seated the dining room was much more comfortable and much easier to have a conversation.  The wine list has many nice selections and our waiter was able to help us select a great wine.  We tried the salami plate which had four interesting selections and we both enjoyed them all.  The waiter recommended the roasted octupus appetizer and it was unique and really my favorite thing we tried. We also had the anglotti with rabbit ragout, it was tasty but I wouldn't order it again and finally we had the pork chop which was cooked to perfection but the butternut squash it was served with had little flavor.  Overall it was good, our server was trying hard but disappeared for great lengths of time but the excellent busboy made up for his lack of attention.  One odd thing about the wine service, he showed us the wine bottle and then left to open it in the waiter station.

Perbacco shines with cooking that spotlights the Piemonte region and elements from Liguria and Provence.  The slow roasted veal appetizer with lemon and albacore tuna sauce is so tender and tasty, they should seriously make giant sandwiches out of that stuff.  While I thought about having the Salumi Misti, house cured meats and salami - after all, it is #18 on 7x7's list of places to try before you die - I opted for the squid which was also impressively tender and nicely accented with lemon and red chili flakes.  The folks here make their own pasta daily, and you can taste the freshness in dishes such as the roasted rabbit agnolotti.  The Subrich, or Piemontese meatballs, were perfectly prepared, not too dense or mushy, with a rich and savory spiced red wine jus offset by slightly sweet apples and potato puree.  Don't forget dessert.  They have a lot of chocolatey and nutty decadence on the menu, but they also have interesting items like citrus and vanilla infused rice pudding with a caramel crust, a cross between rice pudding and creme brulee.

I was taking several co-workers out to dinner so I was a little nervous about trying a new place, but am I glad we went!  \nThe food was fantastic.  We had way to many dishes to list them all. There were six of us so we split a few different appetizers, which were all delicious.  Almost all of us had a different entree, but everyone loved what they ordered.  And dessert!  Again, we all split a few desserts and I highly HIGHLY recommend the chocolate tart.  It's amazing.  That was our favorite dessert.  \nThe staff was very nice.  We never waited too long for anything, nor did we feel rushed.  The tables weren't too close together.  I can't stand it when it feels like you are eating dinner with the strangers next to you.  I didn't ever feel like any one conversation was overpowering and I'm pretty sure our group was OK.  The mezzanine was a cool place to be seated.  We didn't have a drink at the bar, but it looked fun and the place was pretty crowded when we left (it was a Thursday  night).\nThe only negative, and it's not really that bad, is that the menu is a bit pretentious, even for San Francisco.  There are a lot of fancy food words and you sort of find yourself looking for things you recognize (e.g. does that mean it's a chicken dish??)  But once you get past that it was a great dining experience and I would definitely go back.

Incredible home made pastas: Tajina  with the 5 hour pork sugo, pappardelle with shredded short ribs, and gnocchi stuffed with Ricotta. I absolutely loved their pastas. My favorite from the sampling was the gnocchi and Mr. ShiverMeTimber's fave was the tajina. Gnocchi was light in texture. I'm not sure how to describe but it was scrumptious.

Sounds a little trendy and maybe it looks that way too but a lot of the recipes are very classic basic good Italian.  The house made salumi misti platter is constantly changing as they cure different meats during different seasons but it's always a nice pile of salty savory happiness sliced thin.  The salads also revolve with the seasons but the ingredients are almost always what's available at the local farmer's market so that can mean shaved spring radishes or summer strawberries in a balsamic reduction or watermelon in a vinaigrette or little gem lettuce with lemon and shaved cheese.  It's always light, it's always fresh and I always rave about it.  But the pastas here are the showcase display- I think they are all handmade fresh daily but don't quote me on that... gnocci like potato clouds... handcut tagliatelle in a 5 hour pork sauce are tiny ribbons of heaven.  It's really a texture thing.  A master pasta chef knows how to keep the dough very tender and this place has learned the trick so for right now it's my reigning favorite for Italian.  The grilled meats are great. The fresh seafood is excellent but really... I almost always go back to the salad and pasta... if you have a winning combo, you don't' really ever have to mess with it...there's no need to.    I only had one bad dessert here and they have since taken it off the menu and hopefully burned the recipe but the vanilla panna cotta is so smooth and luscious, you could have dreamed it.

Having perennial looks of boredom on your faces, spilling more wine on the tablecloth than the glasses, and dropping silverware in front of guests isn't all that great for service. The people at my table began making jokes about the size of the stains from red wine on the cloth and I had a few drops on my shirtsleeve. If you've been here it's the woman who looks like she swallowed Billy Idol. Just not pleasant at all. The butternut squash pasta was pretty good but it's been awhile since I was hungry two hours after eating Italian, which is what happened. The serving was more suitable for a child. And an Italian place that serves literally one piece of bread per person?? The group was about 25 people and the feedback on the way back to work was that it was a letdown altogether.

But since I walked 4 hours to get there for dinner tonight, I might as well chime in.  True, I did not take the most direct route.  Starting at the Ferry Bldg, I walked up the Embarcadero, through Fisherman's Wharf and Fort Mason, up Chestnut St. to the Presidio, climbed the spectacular Lyon Street Steps, and headed out Sacramento St. to Presidio.  Then back along California to Divisidero and down Divis to Castro, where I thought I'd check out Gay Pride weekend.  Things were in preparation, but nothing had really started yet.  It seemed like there was better planning than in the past:  plenty of porta-potties everywhere around Dolores Park, scene of the Dyke Festival. ( I remember eating at Delfina a few years ago during that celebration when the restaurant was beseiged by revellers from the street wanting to use the restroom.  One particularly agressive young woman, when denied access stomped out yelling \"Delfina hates lesbians!\")   So I continued down 18th St, left on Valencia to Market, down Market and finally wound up at Perbacco on California St.   Of course, I could have just walked the 2 or 3 blocks from the Ferry Bl. but that would have been too boring.   I ordered two small pasta plates, the agnolotti dal plin filled with roasted vitelloni and savoy cabbage, followed by the tajarine:  handcut very thin tagliatelli in a brilliant saffron color with pork sugo.  Both dishes were a bit similar (the vitelloni and sugo were not that far apart) but each was quite good, with deep, complex flavors, more on the refined than the rustic side.  My glass of Barbera d'Alba was superb and complemented both dishes.   So that was it--a bit anticlimactic after the four hour trek, perhaps.  In terms of pure enjoyment, I got more out of the custard- filled bombolloni I bought from Boriana's at the Ferry Building, or the In 'N' Out burger  I indulged in at Fisherman's Wharf.  Most interesting to me was how each Italian restaurant attracts such a different clientelle.  Perbacco was filled with downtown types--jaded older patrons spinkled with a few young professionals, all very buttoned up.   A16, by contrast, attacts the young Marina yuppie crowd, whereas Delfina, which requires a trek to the Mission, is filled with a diverse, vibrant mix of everything,", "author": "David T."}
