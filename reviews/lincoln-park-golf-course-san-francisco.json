Especially once you factor in a SF resident discount when you present your card. \n\nThe location is picturesque with stunning views of the bay and Golden Gate Bridge (when the fog unveils it of course).\n\nThe course is well designed and interesting. There are intriguing elements that vex and distract--especially in elevation and hidden pin flags.\n\nWe arrived at 9am on a Monday morning, so we had plenty of carts to choose from, and were not over-run by golfers coming from behind. I was told that the recent rains had been kind to the course.\n\n4 hours and 11 holes later (I gave up counting strokes :D), I had to pull away for a lunch appointment.\n\nThis is not likely the course for more advanced players, but it was a great place to cut my teeth. I am grateful for this place and will remember it as my first course.", "author": "Lu-Shien T."}

The fairways were all a nice playing depth and the greens in surprisingly good shape. \n\nMaybe this is not a good beginners course. Narrow fairways and tight elevated greens require a certain level of skill if you're playing, otherwise expect a frustrating round. \n\nHowever, if you like a short tight challenging course that's got spectacular views and cheap green fees this ones worth a visit. I walked nine in about two hours and it wasn't busy, was able to play through a slower group and \nhad a reasonably good round all considered.\n\n3 Stars - a decent community course, would of given 4 stars except for not having a driving range \n\n00594", "author": "Ray F."}

However, I think I can sneak one in before the weekend to start 2015 right.  Even though a late post right after New Year's means less readers, that's okay.  Less readers means writing about something those people won't mind missing, which means one less golf related item on my \"to write\" list!\n\nWhile my friends and I have been checking out different places around the Bay Area, Lincoln Park is one of a handful that we keep coming back to, even if it's not one of the best we've played on.  In fact, it's somewhat shabby compared to the courses we've tried in San Jose.  The brown grass and barren dirt patches are understandable given the drought, but why are other holes muddy?  Plus, the grass is tough and isn't cut with a fringe to transition from fairway to rough.\n\nAs for the course itself, I won't detail every hole, but I will say it plays pretty fair while still presenting some challenges.  There aren't any water hazards, but there are enough traps to keep you on your toes and the rough is THICK (I've lost my fair share of balls).  What really makes it interesting though is the elevation.  Although there's some side-to-side sloping, it's really with how nearly every has you hitting uphill/downhill (a couple even have \"valleys\" in between the tee and the cup).\n\nAlso, while Lincoln is walkable, I'd recommend renting a cart (or having a push cart, at the very least).  Between the hills and how spread out the course is (it wraps around the Legion of Honor), you'll get your money's worth.  Plus, even if they are a bit worn down and beaten (and apparently scarce, as they ran out once), having a cart will help save your energy for looking for lost shots instead (or is that just me?).\n\nGiven my complaints and the three stars, why do we come back, you ask?  Well, the city isn't exactly overflowing with alternatives, it's convenient, and the green fees are actually pretty fair ($29 with resident card, $42 otherwise).  Mostly though, it's still a fun course and the views are awesome.  You get a little bit here and there through the first 16 holes, but the 17th?  Damn.

However Lincoln Park possesses one of the most beautiful views of the Golden Gate Bridge from a golf course.  Presidio, Harding Park, Olympic, Lake Merced and SFGC cannot boast that quality... however they all are of tremendously higher quality than the modest Lincoln Park Golf Course.  Currently the greens are in very, very poor shape.  We can only hope it gets better soon.\n\nFacts:\n\nThe course itself is a par 68 with 5 par 3s & 1 par 5.  Par 4s range from 245 - 383 yards and the 3 par 3s on the back 9 range from 200 - 240 yards.  Most holes are uphill or downhill to various degrees and slopes from both angles.  No hole is truly flat with the exception of the shortest par 3, the 3rd.  The 18th is the flattest, but by the end of the round it is just what one needs.  Many holes without bunkers. Greens are small mostly circular in shape with varying degrees of slope and topography. The course boasts picturesque views of the bay, the city skyline, the legion of honor & the sprawling coastline of ocean beach.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nI love to go out to Lincoln with friends for fun and not to work on my game.  A few par 4s are driveable for me so I love to swing hard at Lincoln from the tee.  A fun course if you don't expect too much from it.

I'm trying to pound out a few reviews for my Epic Breakdown of NorCal Golf, and I had my thoughts in my head about this course and went to put pen to paper.  It's been a few months since I played Lincoln and in trying to get my head around what I actually thought, I started reading through some of the other reviews.  It's a mixed bag and I guess that's kind of how I felt about the round.\n\nThe first review I read (from Thomas L. G.) stopped me from wanting to lament about how shitty the course was.  It is and it isn't and I just committed myself to going back to play this course soon to reassess... I'll update.  Thomas was right though.  It's easy to play a lot of golf on modern courses in the bay area and forget that this sport has been around for a long time and the original courses weren't designed to be these 600 yard par 5 monsters.  It's a game of precision and working towards a repeatable swing.  It lets you be outside, enjoy your surroundings and enjoy the people you're with.  Lincoln Park is great at those things.\n\nIt's one of those courses that you wish someone would dump a ton of money into, fix what needs fixing, spruce up the landscaping and really take advantage of those priceless views... and this place has them.  But then you realize that as soon as that happened, it becomes another financially unplayable course in San Francisco.  San Francisco golfers need Lincoln Park to stay playable for the majority of us that can't go pay $150 to play Harding.  So I get it.\n\nHowever, it's kind of frustrating to hit a great drive and then spend 15 minutes looking for your white ball in a sea of dying dandelions because the fairways hadn't been mowed in a few days.  It's kind of frustrating to hit your green in regulation and realize your putting line consists of a few different lengths of grass and a dirt patch.\n\nOverall, I liked the course.  I enjoyed it even with the numerous rough spots.  The price was reasonable for an inner-city course.  The pace was a little grueling, but not unbearable.  The views were absolutely amazing.

Same gardeners at Harding's TPC are also working here so maybe it has to do with union issues or just the right hand to crack the whip? The fairways are at best unkempt, the daisies proliferate and the greens are weedy but this is one of the greatest cities in the world and personally it's a disgrace to the staff at this facility that implements no growth grass, no weeding and no effort policies when they are supposed to be maintaining the same standards at all other city courses. In conclusion, you will not break par from the blues as only a handful of players achieved that honor during the recent City Championship qualifier. You will get some very sordid lies in the middle of the fairway after a good tee shot but to top it all off the views are incomparable.

You then take  a stroll to the far end of the course to play a 3 hole loop overlooking the Golden Gate. \n\nSome of the tougher holes on the course are found on the front side (although a nice \"treat\" awaits in 16-18 where any good round will be put to the test before you can post that score). \n\nThe back side opens with 2 short and score-able par-4's then you have a wicked 210 yard uphill par 3 to allow you to give back all that you gained in the previous holes. The lone Par-5 13th is next and then the quirky but dangerous 14th. After a nice mellow par 4 15th you come to the heart of the matter. \n\n16-18 are a great finish, period. 16 and 17 are back to back par 3's...easy, right? HELL NO!!

Even the locals are thrilled to come through 16-17 at one or two over for these holes. \n\nHole 18 is a nice 400 yd par 4 finishing at the clubhouse where you can rest your weary bones and savor some draft beers overlooking the final hole and the putting green. \n\nPrices are fair, the staff is courteous, it's a San Francisco experience for pete's sake, so stop the whining Biff and go back where you belong....\n\nFor the rest of us \"normal\" folks...Lincoln is a real gem.", "author": "Joel V."}

Yet, I don't believe that the green fees should be more than Harding, considering the shape that it's in, and the fact that their carts are DIESEL-fueled!  I mean, seriously?  We live in San Francisco and it still uses gas.  I got a contact high from driving in one.  That time, I didn't have the choice to walk it, as I was still in a boot from Achilles surgery and wouldn't have been able to navigate the course hills.  However, since then, I have happily walked to avoid the petrol fumes.\n\nThe holes are interesting and I love the lay out because it's so spread out.  Every hole is different, and the surrounding landscape, with its views of the ocean, bridge, Legion of Honor, and neighborhood are a cool addition to enjoying 5 hours while you're out there.\n\nWhat I wish they'd do, however, is give some better signage overall.  I'm not talking about yardage markers and all that because, really, even though it's nice to know how far you've got to go to the green, the game did not start that way.  So I'm okay guessing and getting to know better how to use all the tools in my bag.  What I'm talking about is just what hole you're at!  That, and a reminder to tourists that they should not simply walk out onto the course to take a picture.  We've have to yell a few times, especially at 17, to get people out of the way of raining tee shots.\n\nLooking back over this review, I wonder if it sounds more negative.

The twilight price is only $21 after 2PM without a cart and the views are amazing. We went at 3:30PM and since we got there so late, the guy at the clubhouse only charged us $12 for the back 9 price since it didn't look like we would be able to finish. We were able to fit in 15 holes before it was too dark including the famous 17th hole. \n\nAnyone who hasn't golfed here before, go to the 17th hole and hit a ball off the ledge into the water in the direction of the Golden Gate bridge. It's one of the prettiest holes I have ever seen.\n\nAlso, Lance the owner is really nice. I went here last week with 2 others and they told me about this winter golf glove sale for half off. I got there and they were sold out, but Lance hooked me up with same sale on more expensive gloves.\n\nGolf here instead of Golden Gate Park Golf Course because a 9 hole is $18 there with Twilight starting whenever Bruce feels like it (5pm in the winter). It's only $21 for an 18 hole after 2PM and you will probably be able to finish more than 9. RENT A CART THOUGH because the walking can be tough.", "author": "Katherine F."}

And not always out loud.  No no.  Most of the time, just up here.  Better, really, for all concerned.\n\nAnd, for about....5 years, I'd been having a lot of talks with myself about my drives.  And my...unfortunate tendency to turn too far on the follow-through and push them right (hey, can I help it if I'm limber?).  I've hosted long discussions in my head on this topic, and adjectives like \"idiot,\" and \"moron,\" tend to figure strongly into them.  BUT, at least for the time being, those days are past.  Because when I wandered onto Lincoln for a quick round a few weeks after Christmas, I espied a sale on Nickent 4DX drivers, one of the better-reviewed drivers in recent years.  $120, down from $300.\n\nAfter some careful negotiation, I was allowed to take one out on the course to test out and play with.  I hadn't held a club in my hand since a particularly disastrous outing with my boss that ended with me giving up 4 shots in 3 holes to flush everything away.  And that was August.  And, as we all know, Lincoln has no driving range.  So, I did my Jane Fonda hip twists and baseball-batting-swings for 90 seconds, then stood at the first tee in front of God and 12 assorted people I don't know, holding a club I've never hit before.  And smoked that motha' 285 yards, straight as an arrow.  Hey, it's an easy game, right?  My 85 after 4 months off says so, at least.\n\nI didn't hit that club anything less than awesome all round, and so it sits in my bag now.  With a furry gopher head cover, if you must know.  SO, when you swing by Lincoln (pun intended), don't forget to at least glance at the pro shop sales, because some of them are worth it.

The unpretentious thing really takes the cake.

When he opened the trunk, he displayed a full selection of sodas, beers and snacks all sitting in about 100 pounds of ice he had thrown in the trunk.\n\nOn #16 I sliced a ball OB.  Some jerk shagging balls picked up my ball and wouldn't give it back.

The fairways are extremely muddy and the greens are nowhere near true. \n\nWhy the 4 star review?  As with any golf shot on any course you have to ask yourself Risk, Reward.  A 250-300 yard par 4 on the score card seems like driver or 3 wood is the ideal choice but beware.  Holes can play tight as there are large trees wrapped alongside on the fairway.  Shots can play longer as some are uphill and play into the wind.  There are a number of white stake holes so if you get too aggressive and spray the ball the wrong way, you better hit a provisional.  Playing a mid-to-long iron is the ideal play here, besides, your second shot will leave you 140 and in.  \n\nThis course is challenging and positioning is key.  Golfers must think carefully of how to play there shots because its not straight forward.

A good course if you want to spend the afternoon on the links with a couple buddies and a 12 pack! No need for etiquette here.....it's ready golf!!!!\n\nI'm giving this course 3 stars for the price and breath taking views of the bridge and headlands.", "author": "Roger T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-08-20", "description": "A backyard course on a stretch of land that can probably house a championship track, oh well.  A hilly short course, low in par and difficulty, its a great layout for an average hack.  Even the experienced golfer will be forced to make some crafty shots, due to inconsistent, fair to poor conditions.  Regardless of the negative, the course has character.  If you're walking its a great workout, if you're driving a cart, drink.  Might as well.  Anytime after five is a good time to park behind the legion of honor and sneak on to hole 3, and begin to play random holes.  You only really see a course ranger there on the weekends and the kids in the pro shop can care less.", "author": "Adam M."}

Its decently priced if you have a resident card otherwise I wouldn't suggest you pay the full non-resident price to play, especially on the weekends. There are definitley better bargains around the bay to play. The greens are horrendous and the uneven surface compares to Lake Chabot in Oakland.", "author": "Ron T."}

People working there were friendly and the course was in good condition, especially the greens. There were some wet spots and drainage issues, however. Compared to Gleneagles,Cypress Hills , Emerald Hills and GG Park Golf course, this place is first rate. Its hilly, and the experience of the 17th hole is unreal. It must be the most scenic golf hole in all of the world.  I wish I could just play the back nine for a reduced rate, although its reasonable for 18 holes. Will be back many times", "author": "Mike M."}

I dont know what was worse, the 3 mile walk from the 2nd hole to the 3rd hole or the fallen tree that took my friends ball in the MIDDLE of the \"fairway\". The junior discount was anything but and the only thing that made up for the price point was the beauty of the 17th hole. Aside from that amazingly well kept 1/18th of the course, its not worth your money.", "author": "Kerry C."}

Lincoln Park is a $25 course so it really can't be that great, and it isn't.  However, it's got some interesting holes, gorgeous views and is incredibly close to the city.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-14", "description": "Gotta give this place some credit.  It's not the best kept course.  In fact, some places it's pretty chewed up.  But, for the price, the friendly staff, and the views (oh man - the views), the place will do for a cheap weekend of 18 holes, or even more if you're up to it.  The only downside to playing such a cheap and accessible course is you'll get some newbies to the game out there walking the course, taking 9 shots to reach the green, and it can get pretty backed up - especially on the par 3's.  To no fault of their own - I mean, you gotta learn somewhere.  But if you're an \"experienced\" golfer (who is really?  Other than pros...), you may wanna fork over a lil' extra and head to a nicer course.  Just not Presidio, unless you wanna get yelled at to hurry up when you're playing 20 minutes ahead of schedule.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-07-14", "description": "There's so much potential to this course if they just took care of it. The views are gorgeous, and the course itself is nice. But the fairways get very soggy in the winter and thick in the summer. You can hit a perfect tee shot and still feel like you're hitting out of the rough. The greens can be pretty bad too, with bald spots and pockmarks aplenty. No driving range, no drink cart and the clubhouse food quality is uneven, so bring some snacks. The green fee is reasonable if you're a resident ($24 or $25). Hikers tend to wander randomly around the course because there are walking paths weaving between holes. Sometimes they're even pushing baby strollers. Smart move. If they have a kid, wait for them to pass. If not, swing away!", "author": "Jason B."}

While this is by no means an all-star course, it provides good bang for your buck with great scenery.\n\nThe holes are not overly challenging, the bunkers never come into play and there is no water to speak of.  Hole number 5 is probably the most difficult for me, a long dogleg left set on a hillside.  \nAs others have commented, the greens are typically in pretty bad shape.  In addition, you'll find quite a few dandelion patches, and it can be difficult to find your ball.  Plan on bringing spares.\n\nNo driving range, so warm up has to take place on the first couple holes.  There is only one putting/chipping green, and it can get fairly crowded.  \n\nAll in all, decent value for your dough.\n\nTwo things I forgot to mention....  Lots of amateurs/beginners out here.  Keep your head on a swivel for stray balls, and the group behind you that gets in a hurry.  Also, lots of random hikers/nature-walkers.  Last time out I had to break up a picnic on the 4th fairway, much to their ire.", "author": "Josh B."}

I was literally putting on mud on 1 or 2 of the greens. Also, making your way around the course was difficult as there was no signage, unless you count the markings on the tree that lead you to the next hole. Yes, the 17th hole does have a nice view but that's about it. Even though its the cheapest 18 hole golf course around, it is still not worth it!", "author": "geary s."}

It's a decent layout especially for newcomers and those that are distance-challeged but the course really suffers from poor conditioning.  Shaggy fairways and greens that I usually don't even bother putting on are the norm on this course.  \n\nOn the flip side, it is fun to go out with your buddies on a shorter course and try to bomb the greens.  And of course you really are waiting to play the 17th which offers views of the Golden Gate that would rival any golf course view in the country.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-08", "description": "What a shame Lincoln has become what it is today, the city just does not have the funds to keep it up.  I give it 5 stars only because I have fond memories of playing it   back in the late 50's.  As a teenager we use to play almost everyday, sometimes 36 which you could do back then, the course was in great shape and just as well taken care of as Harding at that time.  The third hole was then a tight dog leg left par 4 that is now a par 3, the original tee sunk and washed out taking away a nice hole.  The fairways were nice and the greens in great shape, it's sad to hear people trashing the course now but that is the truth because it is really bad.  The course may be short but it plays much more difficult than it looks with the narrow fairways and sidehill lies, par 3's 16,17 and the par 4 18th are three of the most difficult finishing holes in the area for the better golfer, I know of only one person to ever finish 2,2,3 in all the years I played Lincoln.  I give it the 5 stars for back in the day but from my standpoint today I can't even give it 1 star for most of the year, around Feb for the City Tournament they do get it cleaned up and playable.", "author": "Bob S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-06-03", "description": "Lincoln Park has the best real-estate of any of the city courses as far as the scenery goes.  The view from the top of the hill by the Legion of Honor is amazing, and the two par-3s (16 & 17) play down along the cliffs overlooking the ocean and the Golden Gate.  Great spot at the tee-box on 17 to hit balls into the ocean which is easily reachable with a driver.  The par-3 itself is maybe not as reachable.  Both par-3s at the back are LONG, 230 and 240 yards, so I generally think of them as guaranteed bogies.  The rest of the course is a bit hilly and twisty, lots of slope on the fairways, usually to the side.  The course is not fantastically maintained, but its cheap and the atmosphere is more like a friendly local muni than the others.  Bring your own beverages, or get them at the clubhouse because there are none available once you start.  No driving range, but if you go off to the right of the club house, there is open space between the back of the 16th green and the 18th fairway that people use like a range.", "author": "J P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-06-22", "description": "I finally got around to playing a round here. It didn't start out great. Somehow, I missed that part on the horrible phone reservation system that told me I had to be there at least 30 minutes before my tee time. So when I checked in, about 10 minutes before, I was informed they had given my tee time away. Seriously? My incredulity then prompted the pro shop guy to inform me that most courses require at least a 30 minutes or more. Now, I have played on tons of courses up and down the state and I have either been really lucky and played ones that only care that you are there on time or this guy was talking at least partially out his ass. Oh, and another thing; I would not mind showing up 1/2 hour early if the place had a driving range (which it does not). But, all was fine, he tossed my twosome into the next available slot and we were off. The fairways were spotty, but not horrible. Some of the greens needed a lot of work, some were in good shape. The holes were interesting to play and the course is forgiving of most errant shots (though you can still manage to lose a few balls if you have the kind of slice I have!). We had some losers in Red Sox hats behind hit into our group a few times (yet one more reason to hate the Red Sox as if I needed more) and there are places on the course that should require hard hats with all the balls that start dropping around you. The views, of course, are fantastic, even with a solid marine layer (not on-the-deck- fog). And do look out for stray tourists! Nothing like a check-swing on your drive as some clueless family emerges in front of you and freeze like a deer in headlight (note to Lincoln, would a few signs here and there be too much to ask?).
