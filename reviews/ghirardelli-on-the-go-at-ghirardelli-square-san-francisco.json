Ghirardelli is a classic ice cream place that serves traditional sundaes and a variety of their signature chocolates.  The ice cream flavors are somewhat limited to more traditional flavors.  The one thing you have to get here is of an ice cream sundae of course.\n\nI had the strike it rich Sundae (chocolate & butterscotch)  The taste was pretty good the high light was the warm thick chocolate at the top.

This spot is amazing and delightful with super great vibes in this area and on a beautiful day the ice cream the brownies and all the things this factory offers will amaze you. Best part is you walk in someone is giving out free samples or chocolate all different kinds of chocolate they have super long lines so be ready to wait because the things there making here are amazing. They have all different kinds of variety of ice creams with brownies and toppings you can get. They make some chocolate in front of you fresh to. It is super heavy the ice and there brownies and I would defiantly recommend you getting the brownies warm they taste yummy and tasty on the melted ice cream. It is a little pricey but you getting fresh made stuff, with some good chocolate. It's a tourist place to check out and at least try one of there milkshakes or ice cream the brownies or the chocolate. Defiantly a spot people go to when in San Fran. They keep it clean also with the big rush; and they have little stands outside that sell stuff if you do not want to wait in a huge line inside the store.

Immediately we knew we'd made the right choice by redirecting ourselves to this quick cafe as opposed to waiting in the long line at the higher and larger restaurant in that mall. \n\nMy tween daughter and I proved we are related by ordering very similar versions of the same thing. We both ordered a Quake Shake. Hers was a blended chocolate bar with caramel. Mine was the Sea Salt caramel shake, blending in a banana too. My teen son opted out and simply sipped a soda and sipped our shakes in between. \n\nOur Three-thumb review is three chocolate and caramel sticky thumbs up. My son was impressed at the distinct flavors. My daughter loved the richness of the shake and the homemade (we think) whip cream. I loved that despite being a \"to-go\" spot, there was a couple - one of whom was an Iraq war vet inside, we sat outside and squeezed in under the overhang, and another family was there warning up their puppies from the damp weather. Everyone was warming their hearts over frozen desserts and sharing stories with those special to them. We were laughing so hard we could barely breathe over playing 20 questions.

But, it still offers the classic Banana Split, Sundae, Ice Cream Cone, Shake, Beverages, and Chocolates without the chocolate factory feel and capacity for more seating.\n\nI like that they offer Hot Fudge in either Milk Chocolate or Dark Chocolate! I love love love Dark Chocolate. Since it was Easter weekend I ordered the Easter Bunny Sundae for $6.75, which included a scoop of vanilla ice cream, dark hot fudge, whipped cream, sprinkles, topped with a chocolate bunny and six Ghirardelli chocolate eggs on the side. It was delicious. The hot fudge was decadent and the ice cream was creamy and delicious. A perfect treat for anyone not wanting to share a dessert. ;-)\n\nEven though there are only about four tables outside and three bar stools inside, there is plenty of seating within the Square or across the street at the Maritime National Park.\n\nThe only downside during our visit was the one man show scooping up ice cream.

We were within walking distance of Ghirardelli Square which was fantastic and convenient. However, Ghirardelli Square is undergoing major renovations, and the original Ghirardelli shop was closed and the Ghirardelli-On-The-Go was our only choice.  \n\nThus, a super long line was forming around the corner and people were waiting for two hours for their chocolate fix. While we were waiting we had an incredible view of the bay, and the trolley cars. We were also given free chocolate samples for our patience. \n\nWhen we finally got inside, because of the long lines, we were only able to purchase ice cream. My in-laws and hubby ordered hot fudge sundaes and I ordered the caramel candy bar shake. We had to wait another 20 minutes for our sundaes. \n\nWhen the orders were ready, they had made mine wrong (without caramel) but after waiting for 2 hours, I was not going to wait another 20 minutes for the correct shake to be made. In hindsight, I probably would not order a shake again, at least not the candy bar shake. The texture was strange and the bits of chocolate all sunk to the bottom which was hard to sip up with the straw. \n\nThe ice cream sundaes, on the other hand, were delicious. I loved the hot fudge.

We waited...I saw people who came in after us get theirs...so we still waited, after waiting for about five mins more, I had it. The BF goes up to see what's taking so long, they told him again \"It's coming up.\" He told them how long we've been waiting and I guess they HAD to make it right then in there cuz he came back with it. I was mad though! I know the place was super busy, but I've been there before when it's been super busy and I didn't have to wait THAT long for one item! I couldn't believe it. There was a family of like I think 8 who sat @ a table next to us...they ordered 7 items and got it before us, that made me kinda want to just get my money back. \n\nThe workers were kinda rude too. When we were waiting for a table to open up, we of course were standing in the way. Well this one worker, an older lady, had an order and she was looking for the number right. Well I wasn't really in the way, I was standing by the stairs and she comes by doesn't even say excuse me and bumps into me. I say excuse me out loud and she just looks @ me with a dirty look like \"well if you weren't in 'my' way that wouldn't have happened.\" I know having a job sucks, but you don't need to show it. Suck it up!!! People are going there to have a good experience, A LOT of tourists, not to mention. If you don't like how it is there, then quit!! \n\nI would give this place four stars, but thinking about it, I don't think they deserve it. I would give three and a half but since there isn't a half star up there, they only get three stars.", "author": "Akemi H."}

When I relented and said I will order what she suggested, she then warned me that it's almost like drinking melted chocolate - which is fine, except for the harsh and irritated way she said it.  That was it - I told her that it was not going to work for me, even though the guy at the cash register was very nice.  She seemed to not want to deal with me because I just don't order off the menu.  We still bought our kids their sundaes even though I didn't want to do business with this particular cafe anymore.  The other guy slipped in a small dark chocolate square for me, which was very nice of him. AT least they have somebody who knows what REASONABLE customer care is - which is why I gave one star.  He deserves to be in charge, and not that girl. He was very nice to everybody.   The manager however, needs more training in customer care - especially how to refer to customers.  She barked at the other customers, about going outside to eat at the tables, and shooed a lady out with a dog.  You know, you can be firm about rules but you SHOULD be nice and considerate about it, especially when the people still want to have some ice cream treats on a cold day.  They are patronizing the product - so take care of them, because they are the reason why you, girl,  have a job.  I worked in the front lines of a bank and a big store chain so I know what customer care is all about.  Thanks for reading this.", "author": "Cee B."}

Seriously. The most uplifting atmosphere, great location. The customer service isn't as good as it used to be, but honestly, it doesn't matter all that much! WANT NOW", "author": "Zeenat U."}

Maybe I don't like ice cream anymore, but I wouldn't go back.  It wasn't even really ice cream.  I think it came out of a soft serve machine?  In fact, it tasted just like the ice cream I get the kids a Sweet Tomatoes Salad bar. Very suspicious.", "author": "Chris D."}
