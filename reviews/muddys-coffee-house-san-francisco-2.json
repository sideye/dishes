I ordered a medium cappuccino and it was too hot to drink and tasted just ok. :( My friend also complained about their drink being too hot. The price-to-coffee ratio was competitive with other coffee shops in the area. On the plus side, there was ample seating and lots of power outlets; it was pretty quiet too, making it an ideal place to work/read/have quiet productive time.\n\nOverall, it was just an OK coffee shop.

She sat comfortably, probably in the same location she has sat in years along with her collections of books, while she sips her favorite beverage, and enjoys the crowds attention!  What a sight!  She was dressed to the nine as most women of her status would dare not be seen without proper gathering and perfect set of hair which by the way, she looked stunning!  It is so endearingly beautiful to find women with natural beauty.  \n\nThe barista who made my over-foamed cappuccino was quite intriguing.  She reminded me of a rerun series called \"Alice\" that I used to watch when I was a kid. There was a character by the name of \"Flo,\" (Polly Holliday) who played as a fellow waitress who had a bit of a \"sassy, man-hungry demeanor.\"  She was well known for her one-liner, \"Mel, you can kiss my grits!\"  \n\nInterestingly enough, that very same woman reminded me so much of \"Flo\" as she had more interest in TEXTING (which back then that would be like filing her nails), and then looking up at me and said, \"I'll be righta with ya hun!\" The only thing that was missing was probably the chewing gum effect.\n\nAt that point, I really didn't care much about her \"blah\" service, I became enamored and found it quite fascinating to be surrounded with a group of eclectic intellectuals, doing about the things that they do daily, all comfortably plopped in their very own \"nooky spot!\"  That was quite an amazing cappuccino!\n\nUntil then, Cheers! :p", "author": "Edwin R."}

Sure, there are a number of coffeehouses that serve much better coffee on this stretch - Four Barrel, Javalencia, Ritual, Borderlands - but they tend to crowd fast with the hipsters during the weekend rush. Not Muddy's. Still as a tomb in here with laptoppers commandeering the tables along the walls to be close to their beloved outlets (see photo). I get what people mean by the lackluster service. When we came up to the counter, we were waiting for just about anyone to show up for a good five minutes before the server finally emerged from the restroom.\n\nLeave a \"Be Back\" sign, will ya? I don't even remember the drip coffee she served me except that for less than two dollars, it was strong enough to keep me up that night. Looking for something sweet after our dinner at Alhamra, we noticed one last slice of a Vegan Carrot Zucchini Bread on the counter for $2.25, so we decided to share it (see photo). What a surprise to find it was quite tasty and not as mealy as you would expect a vegan mix to be with the carrots providing the right level of sweetness for what we had in mind. We ended up sticking around for at least an hour since it was fairly tranquil in there with only the occasional keyboard tapping providing the only diversion from our own chatter.\n\nCOFFEE, ETC. - 3 stars...decent caffeine but that vegan bread surprised me\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...looks tired and a bit grungy as others say but it's comfortable enough if all you're looking at is your laptop screen\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...kinda indifferent\nTOTAL - 3 stars...good back-up alternative to the more popular, fashion-forward coffeehouses in the area", "author": "Ed U."}

Yeah, this is going to be one of those reviews I totally hate when I read it.  The description being 1 or 2 stars lower than the actual rating.\n\nHow to get 5 stars?  Throw in a few comfy chairs or a sofa, tea that doesn't come from Safeway and a bathroom that doesn't remind one of dysentery.\n\nLets start with \"Dysentery alley\".  The facilities are just old and run down, I don't actually think it is that filthy but two trips through there put me in mind of Trainspotting or Calcutta for some reason.\n\nThe tea is from a bag that can be bought at fucking Safeway.  Seriously this is my biggest complaint with Muddy Waters.  I can't be to hard on them for this because it seems to be the standard in San Francisco coffee shops, which is a shame because I want good tea, just not from a tea house.\n\nAlso, someone mentioned the pot of tea coming with 1 bag.  I know, wtf is that?\n\nGood prices, good internet, plenty of seating and outlets.  I like the feel of the place.  Getting their act together on the tea front would go a long way to making this one of my favorites.  Doing something about that bathroom would as well.  Not sure with the space they have how practical putting in some alternate seating would be, it would be nice but what they have is good.\n\nI'll continue to frequent Muddy's, and continue to bitch about the bags of tea.", "author": "Max Jonathan S."}

The secret is stirring the grounds as they brew it. It is black, it is strong, it does the job. They use Max's Blend, which I've brought home and tried to replicate the experience, but it doesn't respond well to my french press. Royal Grounds also uses Max's Blend, and does it up pretty good, but they don't stir, so it isn't as strong.\n\nThere are 4 or 5 locations. Muddy's at 16th is at the ground zero of all the grungiest things about 16th and Mission area. It's not that the bathrooms are so bad (it is) but the possiblity that someone is in there doing godknowswhat and taking forever. Joel who works nites on weekends is the Mayor of 16th Street. He makes the best mocha--- no sludge of chocolate on the bottom of Joel's mochas, he does it right. Muddy's at 24th is quieter. Muddy's on Church St. I don't like as much. I don't like the neighborhood, which is too bad, cuz walking there from my house is a nicer walk than going past the construction along Valencia St. There is a Muddy's on 29th St. kinda near Mitchell's that I haven't been to. There might be an other one, I'm not sure.\n\nIf you want Ritual, fine, but everyone there is nose-deep in their laptops and god forbid you try and strike up a conversation. And the coffee is pretty good, I guess. just don't go to Revolution Cafe and get coffee, their coffee sucks. And the service at Revolution is the worst.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-11-07", "description": "A friend of mine recently moved from Tokyo to a small town in Japan. I asked her how it was, and she responded that it was much more tranquil and she got a lot more work done (she's a bookbinder) but that there was something missing. \r\n\r\nThis was how I felt after migrating from Ritual to Muddy's to work. The energy level could only be described as depressive zombie meditation. There was so much seating space that no one noticed me sitting for hours after my Mighty Leaf tea was gone. Blue-grass was playing in the background at a polite volume. No one was giving anyone else intense googly eyes. People were just chilling with their books, with their laptops, with their homies, sipping on Coke from a straw or coffee from a thermos, tapping  out tunes on a plastic toy keyboard, watching people come and go at the bus stop. A young white guy sat down to play at the cocktail Ms. Pacman and was soon joined by an older Latino man. Their intermittent whoops of victory shot through the nearly empty room. I watched dust motes float in the sunlight. The school bus came, and some kids got off and came in for an o.j. with their mom. It started filling up. An elderly lady with a garish streak of lipstick and a wispy bun sat tapping a pen on her lips and writing. She looked like an American version of a Degas absinthe drinker in a crinkly silver jogging suit. \r\n\r\nActually, maybe it's not so bad to get out of Tokyo. Life is slower here, quieter. It's a strange place, but I kind of like it. Three stars just became four. I think I'll go back and find someone to play Scrabble with.", "author": "Katrina D."}

The staff are friendly, they know what the regulars order.  Gaby is sweet and always friendly.  There was this one rocker dude who always seemed grouchy, but I took that as more about him than me.  Even though the coffee is STRONG, as it should be, I've gotten turned onto something else recently -- the name escapes me, but it is basically two shots of espresso in a cup of (already strong) coffee.  Like other things, it's made my tolerence increase.  An hour or so after having one of these cups yesterday, I noticed my heart beating fast, like I could feel it.
