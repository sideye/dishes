All my veggies were wilted. Additionally, the meat quality wasn't anything like Shabu House's - my meat was definitely not tender, and probably a little old.\n- Service: They kept forgetting to bring out things that were part of our Shabu Set, like our sauces, our rice, etc. When we'd remind them, it would take a good 5 minutes for anything to come. They seem severely understaffed. \n\nAll in all, I'd only come back if I was in the area, and desperately craving Shabu. And even though I'd probably just suck it up and Uber to Shabu House.

We did the math and it turns out they automatically added a 20% tip to the bill without consulting us. My aunt almost tipped twice. It was disgraceful and likely illegal. But at least we figured it out.\n\nOkay pricing for the food. I'd go back if I'm in that part of town again. But the reviews are right about the service here. It was the worst service I've ever had at a sit-down restaurant. I am fluent in Japanese so I tried speaking it to the server after hearing her speak Japanese in the kitchen, hoping she would understand what I was trying to say (\"Can we have some water?\" \"Can I have a menu?\") with no luck. It took asking for water four times in two languages to get any. And when she finally brought our water, I got a lot of dirty looks. I've worked in food service a long time. I know how to be polite to other servers in every language I can order food in. I know I wasn't being rude. Unless asking for water when it's almost 90 out is rude...\n\nI went with an out of town family member who has MANY severe food allergies, knowing Japanese food didn't usually contain her allergens, but we still wanted to ask about one to make sure and avoid a trip to the hospital. The waitress initially refused to seat us because we had the gall to ask \"Do the soup bases include soy sauce?\" (soy sauce is known for its wheat fillers, which would send my aunt to the hospital if she lived through the ambulance ride) and we finally had to decide to take the risk because the hostess/waitress refused to answer the question. We ended up getting the chicken broth because there was no answer about the spicy miso. The chicken broth was uninspiring.\n\nPro tip as someone who has worked in food service for a long time, if you open a restaurant in a tourist heavy area, like right by the ballpark, have at least one person on the floor who speaks English and knows words like \"gluten\" and \"allergy.\" You can't always hope the customer with the allergy speaks your language.", "author": "Emily A."}

The only other shabu experienced I've had was a horrible one in Japantown where we were given a hot pot full of unflavored seaweed water and a bottle of soy sauce to pour in our bowl.

How boring, uncreative, and unsatisfactory to the taste buds is that?\n\nPlanning where to eat in SF last minute on Saturday night is such a Herculean labor to me so we decided to go here since it's a few blocks from where I live.\n\nFor $32, you get all you can eat.  For $42, you can get all you can eat and drink.  But the drinks are limited to beers.  We chose two hot pots divided to four different soups.  We were given cheap meats that claimed to be Kobe, ribeye, lamb, and pork.  For a second time shabu experience, it wasn't bad.  I enjoyed the curry broth the best and we were given ponzu sauce and a peanut buttery sauce (maybe miso?) to dip in.  They were generous when we asked for more veggies and noodles.  \n\nService was a little slow due to one server manning the place and the place was smaller than I expected when I walked in.

Well, that's the big presumption the servers here made when Jamie W. and I tried this new spot in Mission Bay. I guess they took one look at me and concluded I don't need a tutorial, but what about Jamie? His mom didn't make him sing \"Shabu-Shabu,Shabu-Shabu\" as he poked a pair of chopsticks into a boiling pot of water. I just think shabu shabu is exotic enough to amp up the service with some dialogue with your customers, but they served it like it was dim sum...drop it off and forget it until we're ready to pay the check. We were seated at the high top communal middle table that we were sharing with a loudish Asian family who were here for Sunday supper.\n\nWe didn't peruse the one-page menu very long since there are only four meats, two broths and two appetizers to choose from (photo: http://bit.ly/1EagEA3). Like most first-time customers, we both went for the $21.95 Combination Shabu Shabu with a Half & Half Soup Base. That meant sampling slices of American Ribeye, Kurobuta Pork and Lamb (photo: http://bit.ly/1ttATFP) and dipping them in a split pot of Spicy Miso and Ginger Chicken Broth (photo: http://bit.ly/1wSSK9R). That was probably the most reasonable choice for a shabu shabu virgin like Jamie. Before the meat arrived, we decided to share the $4.95 Spring Rolls which we felt weren't even as good as bargain basement Chinese takeout (photo: http://bit.ly/1zX0bkd). Greasy with the kind of hard crunch that comes from leaving it in the deep fryer too long.\n\nAs the broth duo started bubbling, the Napa cabbage, tofu, udon noodles, baby spinach and assorted mushrooms arrived for us to test-drive our shabuing skills (photo: http://bit.ly/13tw4CB). We kept letting the spinach leaves and enoki mushrooms slip through our slippery sticks, so we were making quite a kelp bed at the bottom of the pot. The meat finally came on a platter in deli-thin slices, and honestly they were so thin as to become interchangeable in flavor. Meanwhile, servers would buzz by with no evidence of curiosity about our level of satisfaction. We weren't quite done, but our bowls of Green Tea Ice Cream came, so we switched gears (photo: http://bit.ly/1wop6JL).

I didn't get a: \"oh, sorry I'll get that\" or \"oh yes, that does come with it and I'll grab it for you.\" Instead she said: \"does green tea work?\" which she slides on the far edge of the table en route to someone else a couple minutes later.\n\nI just don't get it. I was as pleasant as possible to make sure I wasn't projecting anything at her. I don't think I've ever left a zero tip at a restaurant before but I couldn't make myself leave $.01 after how she made me feel. I'm not sure even that will make her realize how she's treating customers.", "author": "Boky S."}

Both were excellent, although if I had to choose one, I liked the chicken ginger the best (much more ginger flavor than in most broths).  Finally, they give you two sauces (peanut and ponzu).  The ponzu sauce here is sweeter than usual, but I really liked that.  The meal ended with a palate-cleansing scoop of green tea. \n\nService was nice and attentive.  The room itself was too hot and not well ventilated, so be prepared to strip down to stay comfortable.

The dinner comes with 1 plate of beef & 1 large plate of vegi mixed with tofu & noodle, more than enough for 1 person! My friend also ordered 1 Kobe beef dinner & potstickers and that was yummy too! Large juicy potstickers! \n\nThe restaurant is very nice , a clean modern look! It was very busy because it's their soft opening day but service was still top notch! \n\nI'm glad they finally open a shabu place in the soma district!

Pretty standard shabu shabu place but a great addition to the area. The owner was very friendly. They have added an all you can eat and drink option which was great, even though we each only had one plate of meat for the price it is a pretty good deal. The kobe beef was great and the veggie tray was fresh. We also ordered the pot stickers, which were delicious. Overall a much better experience then before.

When we got here, the restaurant had maybe 3 tables filled already. We were seated and attended to right away and service was almost immediate.  \n\nFor the selection, we ordered dinner servings of the meat combo and a plate of kobe beef.  The meat was fresh, high quality, and nice-sized cuts so no complaints there.  The plates all came with udon, veggies (spinach and bok choy), mushrooms, and tofu. \n\nFor the soup, my friend and I ordered the 50/50 split of ginger chicken and spicy miso, however, we both agreed that the ginger chicken base was pretty top notch - perfect comfort food on a cold SF day *two thumbs up*.\n\nWe ended our night with complimentary green tea ice cream, which was so good!  By maybe 7pm, Shabu Bar was completely packed and a bit loud that it got difficult to hear my friend.  Otherwise, it was overall a great dining experience and I would come back to satisfy my next shabu craving, especially since it's so close to work in the financial district. \n\nEnjoy and stay warm!", "author": "Yolanda C."}

However, we were able to split a large Kobe beef without any problems. The food itself was delicious. We ordered the half and half spicy miso and ginger chicken broth and they were both delicious.

Located right next to the ballpark, this is one of the few good Asian options in the area. Although Nabe is my go-to for shabu, Shabu Bar's ginger chicken broth was delicious, their beef was great, and their veggies and noodles fresh. I did the half/half option with spicy miso and wasn't so impressed with that broth, but would definitely come back for the ginger chicken.\n\nLike many of the customers pointed out, the ponzu is too sweet, but I did like that you could add other toppings to it like Chinese hot pot. Service was prompt and price point, while a little high (~20) per pot is not bad for SOMA.

It's a take-out order and they separated the noodle(small container) and the soup (large container)!  They even individually/additionally bagged the soup container for extra leak protection.  Awesome!!  I know this sounds like common sense, but so many restaurants don't do it to save money.  I want to give them the credit for doing it and for the yelpers who care about this service.\n\nAs for the noodle, it's more Cantonese style Szechuan beef noodle soup than the traditional Szechuan beef noodle soup.  It's delicious and flavorful, but the soup base tastes more like the Cantonese style beef noodle soup base.  They added the Szechuan beef noodle soup style sour cabbage pickle therefore it's not completely/all Cantonese.  There's still a touch of the Szechuan style in it.  \n\nThe beef flank chunks were tender and juicy.  Some of you might find them too fattening for your taste, but I love them this way so they don't taste dry/rough.\n\nNow about the noodle, it's ok.  Nothing extraordinary, just egg noodles.  I'm just glad they were not overcooked and not soaked in the soup when they packed it.  \n\nLast but not the least, the vegetable, bok choy was not overcooked!!  I can still taste the natural sweetness from the bok choy.  The color was still crisp green not the overcooked yellow or dark green with soup/soy sauce contamination.  They also were crunchy not soggy.  Thumbs up!\n\nThis is my first time trying Shabu Bar's food.  I'm definitely going back to try more.", "author": "Gina W."}

They also offered complimentary dessert, but strawberry flavor ice cream ONLY. Yep, for japanese shabu place to offer strawberry not green tea flavor, it was odd.

She left us with a wet table, so we used the napkins to dry it out.

It was enough to feed the 5 of us and the meat was fresh. It's not the frozen shavings you see at other shabu places. They came out with 2 sauces which were a little weird to use for shabu shabu. One seemed like a light vinegar (which everyone thought was soy sauce) and the other was a thicker sesame type sauce.\nBe prepared to have your clothes smell like hot pot since there's not ventilation. It's an interesting set up where every 2 seats there is an induction stove. So it's really meant for smaller parties unless you get to sit by the 4 top tables.\nYou'll be paying higher prices for the meat, but the place is clean and the vegetables were clean.\n\nAlso, they have TV's along the walls, so we watched the Monday night game here.

They have tv's mounted around the room perfect for any game night.  I'd definitely recommend this place  and will come back again! :)", "author": "Corinna L."}

Had we been told at point of reservation we would have gone elsewhere but we made the best of it and stayed. As we sat down and prepared to order, we tried to get a seafood plate ($25 lunch price) and share between two, as we have done in the past, and the waitress told us very shortly that it was \"not allowed\". OK, again we made the best of it, ordered the seafood and another dish and shared the between us both. Spicy broth was not too bad, food was mediocre.\n\nAs we wrapped up we had credit cards and cash so we did the math, auto 18% tip included, and went to the front to pay after no one came to check on us. Woman could not figure out the process so she called again on the lady who was being short and pushy earlier. I explained to her again the cards and cash and asked her at the end if we could get some cash. She RUDELY told me to hold on and she would see if there was any cash left over after processing. when i signed my cc statement she handed me my receipt and when I told her I did not need it she crumbled it and flung it on the desk. so rude!!! when she counted out the cash and saw there was balance. I reached out to get the cash for my co-worker (I was the accountant of group) and she told me, \"you already paid by card so this is not yours, who paid cash\", I mentioned the co-worker and she gave to her and began speaking in her mother tongue when I clearly DO NOT speak the language. I turned around to tell her that this was rude and unprofessional behavior and she became loud and was cursing me in her mother tongue. \n\n***UNPROFESSIONAL ESTABLISHMENT***\n\n**DO NOT COME HERE** WE DO NOT NEED NEGATIVITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SHOULD NOT SUPPORT IT. CLEARLY THIS BUSINESS HAS NO BUSINESS SENSE AND IS NOT MEANT TO LAST.", "author": "Selma R."}

I do alot of shabu in the sf area but this one has a very unique atmosphere and has a much more modern feel to it. Four huge screens that are viewable from everywhere in the restaurant make it an ideal place to watch games, get a good beer with some good food. The way the seats are setup were different because its one long table, but it makes it easy to make new friends and have a good time (I guess that's why they call it shabu 'bar') Will definitely be back. Prices are very reasonable too even though it's in a typically expensive area.", "author": "Johnny B."}

The waitress was extremely impatient and not helpful. Overall not a great eating or restaurant experience, we won't be returning. A shame given the good location.", "author": "Frank L."}

Highly recommend fried calamari. It's amazing. The spicy miso soup base is a must have. This is a great place for friends or coworkers to hang out for dinner. We will definitely go back for more.", "author": "Jess T."}
