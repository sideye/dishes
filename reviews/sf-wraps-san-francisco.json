Unassuming little spot that I figured just served a variety of your standard wraps but I was instead pleasently surprised to learn is a mediterranean specialty restaurant. \n\nI ordered the meat lovers wrap which subs the veggies besides onions for tons of lamb meat along with spicy sauce and tzatziki sauce. The guy at the counter was friendly and helpful and service was super fast. He even walked it out to me rather then just call me back to the counter which was nice.\n\nThis wrap was as wide and long as my forearm and packed with meat! It was slightly more pricy then whats listed on yelp but a good value considering how much food and lamb meat it was. I opted for medium spicy and it came out just right. Not too hot to handle but flavorful. The lavash wrap was thin and crisp and held up under the weight of all the filling.\n\nAll around a good experience. They had free samples of fresh snickerdoodle cookies too that were really good so ill have to come back again sometime.", "author": "Sean G."}

I came in after a night of drinking for some grub and I thought I ordered a shawarma but I got a wrap (duh lol), but the tortilla wrap was fresh and flaky. I can tell they make the tortilla in house. They also specialize in fresh baked cookies! They had samples on the display case...and after one small bite I was sold on a whole cookie (I'm not one for sweets). \n\nIt's definitely a late night spot, or lunch spot. They have a couple 2-tops and one 4, and about 4 bar seating. I'd come here with a group no bigger than 6, or literally alone because it's good.

That totally messed with what I wanted to order.  I ended up getting the chicken salad and a side of rice to go.  The chicken on the chicken salad was good, but came in 4 giant pieces and they didn't have plastic knives.  But luckily they gave me two forks so I could rip the chicken up myself.  Would it take them too long to cut it for you?  Anyway, overall I didn't like the salad.  It came with the smallest side of congealed dressing and there was a weirdly large amount of cabbage in the mixed greens.  Didn't realize I was ordering a raw cabbage salad.  The side of rice was extremely bland.  There's a previous review about the rice not coming with \"carrots, onions, and spices\" and the owner responded saying they didn't update the menu.  Well, the menu still says \"carrots, onions, and spices\" and I just got rice and some carrots.  \n\nAlso, a to go salad place should ask customers if they want their dressing mixed in or on the side.

I got the chicken shawarma with chicken breast, cucumber, spring mix, red onion, hummus and tahini. The person working the counter also asks if you want it spicy or not but it wasn't that spicy. The chicken in the wrap is somewhat dry and even the hummus and tahini doesn't hide that fact. The wrap they use seems like the premade ones that you buy in bulk. The combination of ingredients made it just an alright wrap. \n\nOverall, it's an okay place to stop for a quick lunch but it isn't great. \n\nTips - Don't order anything with chicken breast it's kinda dry. \n\nPros - quick and fast. \n\nCons - precooked chicken just didn't make it a great experience.", "author": "Brian N."}

It's very typical of other fast casual Greek restaurants I've been to -- you order at the front, sit down with a number, and they bring it to you in a basket in a flash.  I got the Gyro Plate, which was lamb and beef, but the Chicken Plate looked really tasty as well!  Each plate comes with a side of pita squares, which is different from the pita pockets or little wedges that I normally see.

Yeah, as the superheroes were all sitting around a table as they all tried the shawarmas. You couldn't quite tell whether they were exhausted from the battle against the Chitauri to save the planet or they just weren't into the shawarmas. After trying SF Wraps, I tend to think the latter since there are few things more disappointing than a marginal shawarma at lunch. At least that's what happened to me when I came in here in a hurry before heading back into the office. Now this used to be California Golden Cookies, but even though the cookies are still for sale, the purveyors finally switched the name to something more accurate about their menu.\n\nThey offer the standard Greek options like spanakopita, hummus, falafels, gyros and ah yes, wraps. The name change hasn't done anything to improve the quality of the food here though. I ordered the supposedly fool-proof $8.45 Shawarma Wrap, which was a somewhat crusty piece of lavash slathered with hummus and tahini sauce and rolled around shards of beef and lamb gyros, cucumber, tomatoes, lettuce and chopped red onions (photo: http://bit.ly/1Sw4fLK). It just tasted off, really off, with the meat having that unmistakable consistency of post-freezer burn. I ate a third of it but no more. Now I know how Iron Man feels.

All I knew was that I wanted whatever the other people had that smelled so delicious! Reza stated to me that many people order the Gyro Wrap.\n\nThe food is LEGIT here! The cooks name is Pablo and let me just say, \"He knows how to get down in the kitchen\". The food is tasty, flavorful and the portions are nice and you will leave you full. I still can't believe I was able to take down a whole wrap but I guess that's what happens when you are tipsy and hungry! Not only are the wraps a huge portion but the salads...OMG!! They looked so dang good and there huge! You have to order one to see for yourself. The have many good options of food but I really recommend the Wraps!  \n\nSeating area is small inside with a couple of tables and chairs so don't be alarmed but the food will make it all worth it!\n\nI never even knew this place existed and I am so thankful I found this!

Not only that but their prices are fair, the portions huge and food delicious.  It is truly a saving grace when you and your friends are on a long night of walking, brewery and bar crawling on a Saturday night.\n\nKnowing very well that I was going to be starving after a night of miles of walking, beer & whiskey drinking, it was comforting to know that there was a place nearby that was open late that served up some solid food options.\n\nA friend and I came here after leaving Rickhouse.  I forget what my friend ordered but I got a Beef Shawarma Wrap ($8-$9) and an order of Falafel.  The Falafel was decent but at about $6 I'm not sure I'd really feel the need to order it again but it seemed like a good idea at the time.  The wrap on the other hand was massive, filling and simply delicious. It was exactly what I needed after a long day of starvation.  I won't lie to you, I almost felt like ordering a second one. \n\nSeriously, this is exactly what is needed in this area. In a city of bustling night life and excellent bars, you're going to need a place with some solid, affordable and quality food options for some post-drinking indulgence.  SF Wraps meets that requirement quite well and surpasses it. If you're drinking at Rickhouse or something else nearby and you're hungry afterwards, you'd be foolish to pass this place up.  \n\nIf I ever end up visiting and doing the same crawl again, you'll know where to find me getting my grub on at the end of the night.", "author": "Jeff S."}

We were lucky to stumble upon this place! Located deep in the city near the nightlife areas, this is an ideal place to grab a quick bite as the night winds down. \n\nThe owner was very friendly to us as we ordered. Since it was our first time, he gave us detailed descriptions of what was on the menu. He also didn't mind having a decent conversation with us which is nice to have at a late night restaurant. \n\nI ended up ordering the Shawarma wraps which were delicious! The meat was tender and there was tons of flavor. I especially liked the sauce as it was tasty and complemented the Shawarma pretty well. It's also wrapped up nicely in foil making it easy to take home in case you don't finish it.\n\nI really like this place a lot since it's open late at night and they make delicious Shawarma wraps!

I came in around 9PM, so not like a late night drunken \"FEEDME!\" moment.\n\nThe service was great. Very prompt and attentive.\n\nBut the food wasn't what it should have been. I got the gyro plate. \n\nThe portion was large, no question. A lot of meat, a lot of hummus, and more tzatziki than one person could eat. But unfortunately, it was a situation where more ended up being less.\n\nThe meat: When you have a rotisserie gyro stand going, I sort of expect my gyro to come from that. Not pulled out of a rice cooker/crock pot in the back. And certainly not just chunks (not slices) of meat. To me, what makes a gyro (or shwarma, or d\u00f6ner kebab) REAL is that mix of crisp and tender... cutting the meat off as it is ready. What I got was salty beef cubes, warmed in a heater. No texture. And, I'm assuming homemade, because it lacked seasoning other than the salty flavor. \n\nThe sides: the hummus had a nice flavor, but was watery. And the tzatziki tasted like what I could buy at a Cash & Carry. If it was homemade, it needs a major garlic and dill injection.\n\nI really wanted to like this more. The owner seems honestly caring and responsive to feedback here, so I'm hoping this comes across as constructive feedback rather than bitching. \n\nAll this place needs to be awesome is a bit less quantity and a bit more quality.", "author": "Jim C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-18", "description": "I don't really want to write a review of SF Wraps because I've noticed the owner comments on everyone's reviews. Ugh for comments. Lately I've been getting a lot of unsolicited comments full of spitfire and vitriol in my Yelp mailbox. My sister, Johnna S., said that nothing good ever comes in the Yelp inbox. She ain't never lied. My reviews are a play-by-play of my experience. That seems fair. You'll note, for the record, that the vast majority of my reviews are 4-5 stars. \n\nOne Friday afternoon I was craving the food of my people (half of my people, anyway), and decided to give SF Wraps a try. I was pretty busy, however, and needed to make quick work of lunch. I hoofed it to SFW and noticed that there were only a few people in line. Sweet. \n\nIt took a long time for me to place my order. I became confused, and I wondered if I was actually in the line. I asked the guy in front of me if he had ordered yet, because it seemed like an uncommonly long wait to place an order. He looked at me with annoyance and replied with a curt \"no.\" Okay, I admit that was annoying. Whoops. \n\nWhen it was my turn, I ordered a gyro lavash. There were only two people working at SFW that day. One was taking the orders and delivering them, and one was cooking. \n\nSFW is teensy, just like every other restaurant in the area. I parked myself at a table to wait, since everyone appeared to be ordering take out. \n\nA man came in and ordered after me. He sat at the table next to mine. And I'm fairly certain he was wearing purple contacts. Purple. Contacts (c. 1993). \n\nBecause I checked in on Yelp immediately upon my arrival, I was able to keep track of how long everything was taking. Of course, while I was waiting, my boss sent me 100 emails--I could just see his head spinning all the way around as he wondered if I had died during my lunch hour. I became antsy.\n\nIt took 20+ minutes to get a single wrap to go. Yikes--that's too long for takeout at lunch. SFW is a new business, so they may just need a little time to work out the kinks. Let's focus on the positive. \n\n+1 star for price. Another spot located in the FiDi where you can get a great lunch for under $10! My lavash was $7-$8--hurrah! \n\n+1 star for healthy fare and portion size. My gyro wrap was more gigantic than the Pixies' song. It was surprisingly light and healthy-full of leafy greens and evenly distributed gyro meat. I had one half for lunch and the other half for dinner. It was pretty tasty, to be sure. \n\nSFW is a solid spot, overall. The only problem is the wait. Just my opinion. Please don't send me a message stating that this review sucks and that as a result of this review you hate both me and my mama. Thanks.", "author": "Sunny S."}

They're sleeping (heh) and SF Wraps is reaping the benefits. I'm glad SF Wraps exists. But for them, *someone* would have had a very bad night.\n\nLike others have mentioned, I discovered SF Wraps whilst wandering the neighborhood late at night. I'd just gotten off a cross-country flight and i was hAngry. Shocked that so few restaurant options were open to me, I pulled out my Yelp app with the last remaining strength I had (I'd been walking the streets like a street walker for an hour and prior to arriving at my destination, had made the mistake of using a shuttle service; I was done) and up popped SF Wraps. Done. \n\nI walked in and was forced to listen to drunk girl\u2122 prattle on and on about nothing anyone cared about. Just as I was about to lay hands on her, her more sober friend sensed her imminent danger and pulled her out of the resto. 'Soup. I need lentil soup... a combo wrap... some sort of juice... and that chocolate thing. Please... so weak...' Seeing my feeble and broken form, the gentleman behind the bar got to my order with terrific speed. In no time, I had my food and was off to the hotel. The soup was made with yellow lentils and was nicely seasoned. I was afraid that the consistency was going to be too runny and while on the thinner side, I found the soup to have a nice depth to go along with its flavor. It was so good, in fact, I drizzled the lentils over my combo wrap. Speaking of that wrap, get it. A combo of meats. A chorus of veggies. A cubic liter of sauceS. I devoured that thing and it wasn't because I was so hungry. It really was that good. About to slip in to a food coma, I spied the 'chocolate' thing. I have no idea of the name but it was chocolate, almonds, a bit flaky, and I ate it like a candy bar. So.good. Thanks to SF Wraps, I drifted in to pleasant sleep and wasn't forced to extend bodily harm to any bystanders. SF Wraps saves lives!", "author": "Johnny T."}
