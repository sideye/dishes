No, the reason to come here is for the seasonal breads and the cheap AF coffee.  Seriously.  A 16oz coffee is $1.50 which in my opinion is the deal of the century, AND it's delicious. As someone who can't seem to get it together and make their own every morning, this seems like nearly the same price per cup as if I actually did make coffee myself. At least that's how I justify being a regular.\n \nThey also have great loaves that you can't get at all Boudin locations such as olive bread, raisin bread and the animal shaped loaves they are famous for. It's a nice place to pick up something seasonal if you are going to a group dinner or picnic.\n \nAlso, I noticed other people had some opinions about the staff. In my many experiences they have been nothing but gracious and pleasant. I love this place!", "author": "Kathryn P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-25", "description": "I flexed my \"let me tell you all about sourdough\" muscles pretty hard not too long ago when I got all science-y about it in another review. To save you the pain of having to go through that again, I'll just sum it up thusly: it's not just your imagination, sourdough really does taste different in San Francisco. It's science. \n\nWhile there are many other contenders for birthing the bread nouveau movement of the last few decades that are based in the Bay, that's not Boudin's trophy. But arguably, when it comes to that tangy sourdough bite, they may very well be the name. The big one. The most well-known slinger of sourdough.\n\nWhile the airport is packed with their stuff, and the waterfront has the massive spectacle of the flagship bakery location, I'm actually quite fond of this one on 10th. It's the peoples' Boudin. The Inner Richmond locale. The \"stop by on the way home for a loaf\" location. The \"let's duck in for a soup bowl\" stop. \n\nFor me, it's been a go-to for years. Usually, it's when I'm on the way out of the city and I want to grab some bread as a gift for special people back at home. Nothing says you care like a loaf of bead, so when you tote a loaf of sourdough on the plane, you must really really care about the person it's going to. \n\nI'm a fan of the simple rounds, so if you can get through a big one, great. If not, they do have a smaller loaf. They also have the festive ones--holiday shapes, crabs, turkeys, or whatever. That's sort of a bonus feature and novelty, as they're good but never as good as the normal boule. \n\nRemember that this is a neighborhood shop, and it's not one of their new cafes. It's first and foremost a bakery where you drop in for a loaf of bread, and secondly, a very limited lunch spot that's pretty much just bread and soup/chowder. That's the charm, really. This is a bread lover's bakery. Pure bread. Unadulterated yeast feast. I loaf it.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

There are sandwiches and sweet you can purchase but the whole purpose for being there is for the amazing chew, taste, and smell of their fantastic sourdough. It does not matter if you tear a piece off to eat just as is. Or with a little bit of butter. Or maybe you like to toast it it and slather some fresh berry jam. And then there is always stopping off and getting some brie to go with your sourdough. Needless to say. The bread is amazingly delish. And the staff in the store are very friendly.

I started to suspect this when I went on my first walk around my new neighborhood and I could smell the boudin 2 blocks away. How cruel.\nSo this is very different from any other Boudin location I've been to. It's extremely small and really just a storefront at their main factory warehouse. They have every kind of bread Boudin makes, some pastries, a couple pre-make sandwiches, the classic chowder in bread bowl, and maybe a premade salad? (don't quote me on that). They also have basic coffee. What they DON'T have is much seating. They have only outside tables (3 to be exact) that sit 2 at each. Surprisingly every visit I've made they've been pretty busy with take-out customers. They also only have one employee working given the size, so it can be a little slow.\nHaving said all that, once you realize this isn't much of a restaurant and more of just a take-home bakery, it is everything you could want in the neighborhood. I will definitely be a regular customer now that I live so close by!\nMy other minor qualm with this location is that they don't do the Boudin frequent buyers card. Weird, right? I could be getting so many Boudin points with all the bread I'm about to buy...\nOverall: Just know that this isn't a 'Boudin Bistro' like almost every other location.

I feel it's my Yelpy duty to do some clarification. \n\nThis red brick building nestled between Geary and Clement is not your standard run of the mill Boudin you pop into in tourist ville or the mall. There is no huge lunch menu. This is a big ol bakery that just happens to sell a couple of lunch nibbles as well as all sorts of yummy bread. You can also get some coffee and a cookie or a pastry if you are in more of a snacky mood. The main purpose of the building is to bake and package bread so the holy yum yum smell of baking bread wafts up and down this little corridor of 10th Ave. The majority of their wares are under $5 making it a stock up stop for those around the holidays or traveling out of town. \n\nThe lunch item menu is simple. Turkey and Havarti, The Italian, clam chowder in a bread bowl and cheese foccacia bread comprise the entire menu and they sell their offerings until they sell out. I have enjoyed all three, just for a change of pace to the other surrounding offerings. Plus I dig the clam chowder. No lie, I love getting this to go, eat the chowder and the top of the bread bowl for lunch (the chowder's thoughtfully provided separately in its own to go container to prevent sogginess prior to eating) and then eat the rest smothered with the butter also thoughtfully provided as a snack later.   \n\nSimple pleasures folks, simple pleasures.", "author": "Veronica G."}

It's expensive for bread...thanks to the 2 day shipping and all, but the ecstatic phone calls and little love notes from my MIL make it all worth it. \n\nI've used this club for over a year now and the bread always arrives to her nicely packaged, they send it 2 day so it's still very fresh.They have a few types of clubs...but we just get the standard 2 long loaves per month. Too bad they don't have a 4 loaf version, I think she'd cry with happiness.\n\nSuper easy to use website (www.boudinbakery.com) and ordering process, notifications each month when a shipment goes out and my card is charged.

(Used to frequent it quite often, but am trying, yes trying as the operative word there, to stay away from excessive carbs.  Usually just a whiff of the bread smell walking a block away from the store is enough to get me inside to buy a pastry or two.)  It's a pleasant little shop, and I stress little cause there's no where to sit inside.  I love their breads (need to try their chabata though), baked goods (the chocolate croissant and fruit tart are my faves), and clam chowder.  I ALWAYS get it in a bread bowl because I love scraping some of the inside of the bread bowl to accompany each bite of chowder.  My only gripe is that often times there are too many potatoes, and not enough clams.  \n\nI think this location would get  the final star if it was a bit bigger and had at least three or four tables inside...the seating outside doesn't cut it for cold winter days (or cold days in spring and summer for that matter).

We had seen pictures of them all day so being that is was cool out, chowder sounded great. \n\nWe decided to try Boudin near Pier 39. We were looking for something a bit more upscale and Boudin looked the part. The pier overall was a little quieter being that it was Sunday night around 830ish so when we walked walked past the sourdough bread factory and went upstairs to Boudin I thought we were in for a treat. The restaurant was very slow yet they made us wait about 15 minutes before being seated. Our server was Samuel. Right off the bat, they were out of the \"petite chowder bowl\" and the \"large chowder bowl.\" We instead ordered 2 medium bread bowls. She got the corn-chowder and I got the clam chowder. The chowders were pretty tasty, creamy, etc as was sourdough bread but it wasn't enough for the price. $23 for both bread bowls and a soda. \n\nWorse yet, was the service. Samuel was inattentive and was clearly favoring another table as I saw him make at least 5-6 trips to check on them for an extended period of time. I guess they were his friends or regulars. I don't want to sound like a complaining baby, but we would have liked at least ONE refill on our drinks. Lastly, he literally *tossed* the check on the table (I'm pretty sure the bill-plate bounced) and bid us goodnight and kept walking all in one motion. \n\nSo, my advice is to skip Boudin and try one of the mom and pop restaurants on the pier next time.", "author": "Don M."}

The smell of Boudin bread often permeates the air in this part of the neighborhood, and if you've ever eaten at a Boudin and thought, \"Damn, this bread is good!\" well, this is the source!  Though it was an amusing sight for me, I think it's a testament to the quality and consistency of their bread when the regulars appeared quite anxious to get their Boudin fix.", "author": "Jenn C."}

(If you really want a true boudin's experience, go to the one in Fisherman's Wharf!)\n\nI always order the classic clam chowder in a bread bowl. You can never go wrong. Absolutely delicious. The bread is warm, soft, sour and overall PERFECT! The clam chowder is nothing too amazing, but it's the bread that makes it wonderful!\n\nThe staff here is nice, friendly and greet you with a smile.\n\nI will need to go back to try their sandwiches sometime.

And in both times i was told by the Franciscan restaurant they they've never sold it and have gotten multiple customers come in asking for starter.
