They don't open for lunch and only for dinner.  They do NOT serve pho here so don't bother to ask them for it haha, unless you want to troll.  The food here is awesome, the 7 course beef is amazing! you make all the rolls yourself and it gives you a really good experience.  Although all the meat and the rolls kind of tasted the same after a while, its still delicious! \n\nI recommend complimenting the food with a nice beer! They have this \"33\" beer from Vietnam and its pretty good! its a beer you don't see often at much bars and stuff.  I always walk by here pretty often and it always seems pretty packed regardless of the day.  We were here on a Friday and the whole place was packed already.  They have plenty of locations and I did read about them, their first restaurant is in Saigon! \n\nOnly beware that this place is in the Tenderloin, so keep your wallets and purses and valuables handy at all time if you plan on doing street parking and watch where you step because there is always a lot of needles on the floor..... something I have to watch out for everyday, lol.", "author": "Ben Z."}

I love 7 Course Beef and this is one of the best in the Bay Area to enjoy this Vietnamese speciality. They're located on Geary Street in the Lower Nob area and parking can be easy or quite challenging depending on when you come.\n\nMy dishes I love to order the most are the Bo Nuong La Lot(leaf wrapped beef), the Bo Nuong Sa(grilled beef with lemongrass and onions), and the Bo Nhung Dam(raw tenderloin beef you cook at your table). All are authentic and really hit the spot if you enjoy this cuisine. \n\nThere can be a wait during the busy weekend dinner times as you would expect.

We came to try their famous beef in 7 ways and we also ordered the sugar cane shrimp. The beef in 7 ways was a lot of food. We had 4 people and we ordered 3 portions which came out to be the right amount with everyone being stuffed by the end of the meal. \n\nThe beef in 7 ways overall was great and a fun way to try a lot of dishes. Dipping the rice paper in water and making your own spring roll was really fun. My favorite was the Hawaiian leaf wrapped beef sausage- so flavorful! My least favorite was the pate and the congee at the end (too much ginger for my likening). Next time I would order ala carte and try more of their other dishes.

But I've parked here plenty of times before and it's totally fine. \n+ Food: WOW. Make your own spring rolls is my favorite! (It's basically anything off of the SPECIALS or GRILL section.) Specials is cool bc they grill the meat for you and you just have to make the spring rolls yourself. Under the Grill section, you actually get to grill the meat on top of it! I recommend doing a mix of ordering from both Specials & Grill for a blended experience (and in case you're HUNGERS) and want to eat fast. The whole experience is SO MUCH FUN and it's such a great date / group spot. The meat was yummy (I ordered lemon grass & beef in Hawaiian leaf) and was thoroughly impressed with both. I opted out of the 7 Course Meal special bc that felt like too much food. \n\nMy favorites are Hawaiian leaf, grilled beef with lemongrass, beef + shrimp, beef wrapped in shrimp with noodles, and beef carpaccio. \n\n+ Wine: HOLY you can get a WHOLE bottle for as cheap as $22 (we ordered the $25 cab and I was very impressed LOL)\n\nAll together the whole meal (grill + special + one bottle of wine) came out to $72 and I was STUFFED.

At just $25 per a person, you can get yourself a 7 course beef dinner. Location isn't so great so be prepared to walk through the dirty streets in the TL just to get to Anh Hong.\n\nIf it is available, I highly recommend getting the water prawns with banh hoi. These water prawns are absolutely enormous! The sauce is sweet and savory and just soaks into the banh hoi (rice noodle squares). If you behead the prawns and let the roe and juices soak up in the banh hoi, the flavors just blow everything else out of the water. The owner was kind and gave us an extra water prawn on the house!\n\nThe best part of the 7 course beef would be the three different meat sausages that it comes with. Being able to soak the rice papers and use it to wrap it with the sausages and veggies you like is great because I get to make the wrap the way I want it. The beef fondue is delicious too! \n\nService is great and very quick. We got all our items really fast which is amazing seeing how busy they always are.

There are only a few small tables so waiting for a table of 2 or 4 will be super long. \n\nThere is one woman server, who does not speak Vietnamese, but Chinese.  I just could not believe that the owner hires the most incompetent waitress!   The waitress is rude, loud mouth, could not get the order right.  She screamed at the customers as they were no body.

The restaurant was half full so we were seated and had our order taken immediately after we entered. The sauces and beef salad came out first, but the salad looked like a mess that was hastily put together.\n\nWe were unimpressed, but finished it all because we were starving. It took another 10 minutes for the fondue to come out. They had forgotten our plate of meat, so we patiently waited for the meat as restaurant started filling up. We reminded our waiters a couple of times, but thought it was strange to have to wait so long for an uncooked plate of meat!\n\nIt took us around 20 mins to finish the beef fondue. We waited a total of 40 mins for our next course and flagged waiters down every 10 minutes, but it never arrived. What was worse, was that none of the waiters bothered to stop by our table and just said \"it's coming\" every time we asked. My mom was pissed having to wait 40 minutes and decided to pay for what we ate and left to a different restaurant.\n\nI'm sure the food would've been fine, IF IT HAD ARRIVED.

While there are other dishes here, like vermicelli or pho, it seemed like everyone in the restaurant knew that they wanted the seven course beef. And after trying the seven course beef, this would be the only thing I could ever get at Anh Hong.\n\nMe and 3 other friends came in around 5:30, and was seated promptly. We were all eager to try the seven course beef, so we only ordered that and some drinks such as thai tea, yuja cha, and coconut milk.\n\nSurprisingly, seven course beef isn't as meat heavy as one would expect. There is a large plate of carrots, cilantro, mint, radish, and lettuce. If you ever run out, you only need to ask the workers to receive more vegetables. The seven course beef also came with a lot of a lot of rice paper (which you dip into water to make it softer), and some fish sauce and anchovies sauce.\n\nMoving onto the main attraction, the seven course beef.\n\nThe Seven course beef has:\nBeef Salad,\nbeef fondue(beef hot pot),\n3 types of beef sausages (with shrimp chips),\nbeef meatloaf,\nand beef rice porridge(congee).\n\nThe beef salad was very good in my opinion. The beef salad has very strong mint taste. I thought it was going to be raw beef salad, but it was in fact a cooked beef salad. It was quite good, nothing mind blowing but it was a nice minty beef salad.\nThe beef fondue was just OK, but not as great as the salad. I personally thought the broth didn't have enough flavor, because when i cooked the beef in the fondue the fondue did not enhance the beef very much.\nIn my opinion, the main dish of the seven course beef is the giant platter of sausage and meatloaf, which has shrimp chips on top. This was definitely the best part of the seven course beef. Each sausage had a distinct taste, for example, one sausage had a thin slice of pork wrapped around it, another has a taro leaf wrapped around it, and the last one had a lemongrass taste. Each of these sausages were good by itself, but it really came alive when you wrapped a sausage with rice paper and put some vegetable with some fish/anchovy sauce on top.\nThe shrimp chips were fried well as well, so I enjoyed them very much.\nThe meatloaf was very fluffy, it almost tasted like meat flavored eggs. I personally didn't think the meatloaf was very good, but it added a different texture and taste.\nThe last dish was the rice porridge(congee) with beef. In my opinion, this had much to be desired. The congee was plain, and there was no beef taste. This congee might be a good cleansing dish, and that might have been the point. \n\nOverall, I would be very excited to recommend this to any group of two or more. This is a really fun experience. I think it is a little pricey and some of the dishes aren't very impressive, but the overall seven course beef experience is fun.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

Another time, we got one waiter's attention and he only came back with one plate of veggies but didn't refill the pickled radishes when the whole table was out. \n\nTo top it off, they charged a mandatory 18% tip even though we received absolutely no service and were ignored the entire time.", "author": "Heidi V."}

Had good memories here. Decided to go last night and well... here's my feedback of the experience:\n\nDisclaimer: I generally don't like to give negative reviews but Anh, I was utterly disappointed my experience. \n(*-1) Especially concerning that as I was eating, I freaking pulled a steel wire string (from those steel scouring pads) out of my mouth! Why is this piece of metal in the meal??? When I showed the piece of scrap that was in my food to a lady that worked there, she apologized. \n\n(*-1) Then as the waiter was trying to put a plate down, we had to maneuver things around the round table but before the plate was given enough room. The waiter starts slowly putting down the plate, allowing it to push aside the surrounding plates. That's normal in family style Asian restaurants. What was NOT OK was that he did it without care and ended up pushing over a sauce plate, which spilled all over my grandpas lap!! Hardly apologetic, he didn't even get napkins or water for us to help clean up the spill without us having to request it!?! I'm glad it wasn't anything worse i.e. Boiling hot or would heavily stain that spilled..\n\nThe beef salad within one of the 7 courses, which felt more like a pork salad since the meat was pale, dry and tough. \n\nOtherwise, food tasted flavorful and good. It's just the incidents that occurred outweighed the delicious factor.\nHad I already set shitty expectations of service/food safety, I probably would've recommended/come here willingly.

Pagolac was the restaurant I recommended when I was on \"Check, Please! Bay Area\" a few years ago when I managed to convince a young purse designer it was the bomb, while the Sonoma matron was not so much a fan. Well, Pagolac shuttered its door rather quietly in the last couple of years, and while Little Saigon offers several like-minded options, none really delivered the goods. I'm afraid I have to add Anh Hong to the ho-hum list.\n\nI happen to catch the place when it wasn't very busy on a Tuesday evening, so I secured a table next to the window with ease. Forgoing my usual starter of Fresh Imperial Rolls (Goi Cuon), I started boldly with the $5.50 Special Seafood Soup (Soup Do Bien Dac Biet), which was a relatively clear broth served in a clear bowl with some squid slices mixed in to justify its seafood label (photo: http://bit.ly/1UHRAKr). There actually wasn't that much flavor to it, and in hindsight, I think I should have ordered something with explicit ingredients listed like same-priced Asparagus Soup with Crab Meat so that I know what I was getting.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered predictably and went with the $13.50 Combination Korean BBQ Rib and Grilled Sesame Chicken Dinner Plate (Com Dac Biet). It was definitely a generous amount of food but rather blandly presented with the riblets piled on the flattened chicken with little distinction in flavor. On the same plate was a Fried Egg Roll, a Fried Wonton, a scoop of white rice (as opposed to the fried rice mentioned in the menu), and a side salad with their house dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1VoPcsE). It honestly reminded me of a school cafeteria meal where you were afraid to go up for seconds, so you decided to pile it high on your tray. Couple this with the indifferent service and I appear to be continuing my search for a Pagolac replacement.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...even if the food is good enough, it tastes a bit generic for Vietnamese food\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...pretty spacious\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...they appear to favor the big parties\nTOTAL - 3 stars...Pagolac wannabe doesn't quite satisfy", "author": "Ed U."}

The beef dipped in vinegar was delish! Their sauce was on point! Only wish it was a little thicker to take more onto the rolls. Their beef salad, the sausages and steamed pate, and rice porridge were all tasty. The meal was definitely satisfying and enjoyed! \n\nOne tip of advice for the restaurant - maybe not serve the diep ca (fish mint) to westerners? Or leave it on the side or be explained to them? Bc I'm Vietnamese so I know what is it and I, myself don't like the smell and can easily push it to the side.

I love Vietnamese food and have dined out in many places in SF. I completely understand that even in the best restaurants things can go wrong but the service in this place was shocking and the food, quite frankly, awful! My husband was half way through his main course when I asked where my meal was as it seemed like it had been forgotten. I was advised that it was coming but received no apology or even acknowledgement for the delay. I was looking forward to my chow mein but when it eventually did arrive it tasted bland and the meat seemed off. I was very hungry so I had a few attempts but just couldn't force myself to eat it. There was no one around to give my feedback to and after it was clear my husband wasn't enjoying his either, I decided to just ask for the bill. The lady who seemed in charge passed by, I asked for the bill, she didn't acknowledge that I'd barely touched my meal, or even give me a chance to mention anything  as she walked away. When she brought the bill over i informed her that I didn't enjoy the meal and that it tasted strange. She said it was because it's a Vietnamese Chow mein and that it was supposed to be crunchy... I couldn't believe her response. How ridiculous!  I told her that I didn't mind the crunchiness but rather the off taste, and that in fact it was so bad I couldn't eat it. She just said ok and walked away. I'm still shocked as I have never experienced such poor service. Maybe I was unlucky but I thought I'd share my experience to warn anybody who doesn't want their meal to be ruined by horrendous service and awful food.", "author": "Dorota C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-16", "description": "7 course beef dishes for the win! \n\nWhat consists of this feastful 7 dishes - cold beef salad, rare beef steak with hot boiling soup, 3 types of grilled sausages (my favorite was the simple beef with no wrapping of leaf or scallion stuffing), a scoop of this tasty meatball that was served with the sausages, vegetable plate that includes pickled carrots, daikon, mint, basil, beansprouts and lettuce and last, but not least, the hot beef porridge as dessert.  \n\nThat porridge should have been served as a soup, in my opinion, at the beginning to warm the soul up!  I recommend watching a YouTube video on how to roll up a spring roll, before ordering up the 7 course because it requires that skill to combine and eat the courses properly!  They provide fish sauce, anchovy sauce and hot sauce for the dishes - my favorite dipping sauce was the anchovy sauce.  \n\nThis grand meal can surely feed 3 people!\n\nThe service was lacking, otherwise, this place would have earned its 5 stars.  I had to repeat myself 2 times each for being ready to order and requesting for my cups of tea.  It was busy after 7:30pm on a Sunday night, but that doesn't excuse ignoring me 2 times each!  That made it 4 times of avoiding me.\n\nI like how the 38 Geary bus drops you off literally right in front of this restaurant.  It was so convenient - like valet drop off more or less, but for public transportation.  \n\nDon't expect grand decor.  Their other dishes are mediocre - you can find elsewhere.  As a heads up for a Vietnamese restaurant, they do not have Pho here!\n\nThe 7 course meal was fitful for a buffet!  For $20.95 per person, it was definitely worth the variety, delicious concept and tastiness.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

Was I disappointed? Absolutely not! \n\nBut first things first, our meal was 100% entertaining. The owner (?), the man with the awesome sideburns, was hilarious. He bickered with a friend throughout our meal. To be fair, our friend did not know the basics of rolling a spring roll. Mr. Sideburns even provided us a table side demo to the art of spring rolling; basically unheard of at any Asian restaurant. In the end, we were absolutely thankful for his participation to a very interesting and entertaining meal! \n\nNow, back to the food. As a group of 12, we ordered 10 sets of the 7 course beef set and there was still too much food leftover!\n\n1. Cold beef salad. \nI liked it! It was very refreshing and had the perfect tang.\n\n2. Beef Shabu. \nInteresting, probably my least favorite. The fire for the shabu was too mild and the broth was a bit too adventurous for me. \n\n3. Plate of 3 different beef rolls and 1 type of meatball. \nSeriously, the best part of the meal. The three different types of grilled beef rolls were divine! Everyone's taste buds were dancing for the beef rolls wrapped in Hawaiian leaf and the grilled beef sausage. The rolls with the onions were the least desirable, they were too mediocre and had no oomph to keep us yearning for more.\n\nNote: Please eat the meatball with the shrimp chips! My friend made a mistake and ate it with a beef roll. Mr. Sideburns was not impressed, haha. \n\n4. Beef Porridge\nA surprisingly light porridge! A great way to end a protein filled meal.\n\nOverall, a great meal with friends! You get to bond and laugh at all the ugly and pretty rolls that eventually end up in your stomach.

This is one of my favorite places in SF to take friends when I honestly do not have the energy to wash all those greens and slice all those vegetables myself. It's pretty close to what a slightly special, family-style meal would be like in South Viet Nam. If you come on the early side, you won't have to wait. Just be aware you'll be sharing the dining room with grandmas and grandkids celebrating somebody's birthday or the other.\n\nOn good days, the servers are like your youngest uncles who good-naturedly bear with you and your silly special requests. But they can also be more like your older, grumpy, great-uncles who, nonetheless, bring you extra herbs and refill your pickle plates endlessly. For Southerners like me who live in a neighborhood where people assume that VN folks eat only pho and banh mi, this place is a godsend.\n\nSeven courses of beef has always been too much for me, so if I'm feeling like having red meat, I usually just order 3 dishes a la carte. My favorites: the beef rolled with la lot leaves, the beef that you dip into vinegar broth at the table, and the rice and beef soup (which is best at the end of the meal, as a finisher). Often, though, I just stick to seafood, such as the shrimp on sugar cane followed by the assorted seafood grill plate.\n\nI love, love, love how much fresh greens they give you. It's piled up high just like my own family does. They also offer the traditional anchovy-pineapple sauce that goes so well with beef. \n\nThere was one day when they didn't have the full complement of the usual herbs, just cilantro and mint. I asked about it (fearing that they'd switched over to the minimalist plate that most other VN restaurants in the US offer). The owner came by and apologized, saying they usually do have the fish mint and the sawtooth herb, the red perilla and the rau ram...just not that day. Whew! Worries averted.\n\nSecret: Order a beer and tip some of it into the vinegar broth for the dipped beef. Mmmm.", "author": "Thy T."}

Not quite as good as the shrimp and sugar canes, but also worth trying.\n\nBoth of these come with sides of two sauces (a plain fish sauce, and another fish sauce mixed with several others), large lettuce leaves, and a stack of rice paper wraps that you're supposed to wet in the bowl of water.

You dump slices of beef in the fondue and make your own \"egg\" roll. It's actually rice paper you dump in water and it turns soft. So much fun! Then you get one big plate with 4 different beef: meatball, 2 types of sausages (they are a little sweet), and beef roll. You can also make \"egg rolls\" with these. You have carrots, cucumber, lettuce, basil, etc to stuff it with also. Last course is soup.. rice and beef. Very good! Overall we really enjoyed the experience and also the food!

The restaurant was surprisingly empty when we showed up and we saw a table reserved for 10 which we assumed was for us. Instead, they showed us to a table with 8 seats. I was confused but he said that we would have to squeeze. Wtf, rude. Why would you make us squeeze when you have all these open tables available? I was adamant on requesting a bigger table since we had a lot of adults which would be uncomfortable to squeeze AND I made a reservation for 10 so why don't you just give me my table for 10?! After the third time asking, he finally agreed to put two tables together to accommodate.\n\nWhen we got seated, my sister placed the order to probably the most emotionless man I've ever met who would not acknowledge any of our requests (we asked for water and soda chanh since 20 minutes in and they didn't bring it out on their own). I don't understand why their service was so slow when the restaurant was still pretty empty at this point. My family had a pretty late lunch that day so though we had 10 people (including 3 small children), we ordered about 5 portions of the 7 course beef, two appetizers and a rice plate to start and were planning to order more if it wasn't enough. The waiter kept making snide comments about how this was too little of food for such a big group and gave us the dirtiest look. Who are you to tell us how much to order? We are giving you business regardless! Which by the way, the bill ended up coming out to over $200.\n\nWhen the 7 course beef came out, we really liked the Bo Nuong La Lot and egg roll appetizers so we decided to order more, which took foreverrrr to come out. And since they wouldn't acknowledge us, we couldn't tell if they even got our order. Just as we were about to give up and ask for the check, the waiter finally brought out the last dishes. \n\nThe food here was hot, tasty and made to order which is the only reason why I'm even giving them 2 stars. They were way too rude from the get-go and I will not be coming back even though the food here was good. I know many say not to expect much customer service from Asian restaurants but this was beyond anything I've ever experienced and it is definitely not worth it to be treated this way!", "author": "V L."}

We did the beef and shrimp grill, egg rolls, and BBQ chicken. The raw portion of beef and shrimp was small, not worth the $26 for 5/pieces each. For the price I'm paying I'm expecting some vermicelli noodles to come with the combo. The only highlight was that the greens were fresh. The server brought us BBQ pork, my boyfriend can't eat pork and we informed him we ordered chicken. He then argued with us saying we ordered pork and insisted it was very good. Nonetheless, they didn't take it back and we didn't eat it. Very frustrating, it looked like everyone was enjoying the food but we were not impressed.

Pretty much too young to even know how to order my own food. \n\nMy most recent visit was in January for a friend's birthday dinner. She had just came back from traveling to Vietnam so she wanted to have 7 courses of beef. She had made reservations for over 15 people (forgot the exact amount) and they had made arrangements for that on a large rectangular table. However, some friends didn't show up so they had move them to a smaller round table.  My girlfriend and I arrived late. So when we got there, they were already munching. With that said, they still didn't want to give us the larger reserved table and just pushed together another smaller round table together. UGH. Let me emphasize that the restaurant is 3/4 EMPTY! Pessimistic, yes! Fine, we understand you want to reserve your tables for other guests. \n\nAlright, so everyone that was already there ordered already. I think they all shared the 7 course beef. My friend and I weren't that hungry so we wanted to share a rice place but the male server flat out told us NO because everyone has to order something. WHAT???? There was no apology or anything while he was saying it either. He stood there and waited for us to figure out our second order. \n\nBesides that, we never got refills or check backs. At the end of the day, I know it's a vietnamese restaurant so I shouldn't expect much service but for gosh sakes we're in Downtown SF not chinatown! I totally understand that you want to generate revenue and reserve seating for larger parties but service here is BS. Do not expect return customers if you are going to treat your customers like that. \n\nAs for the food, it's really nothing spectacular.

My family and I usually come here for birthday dinners or whenever we deem is a good time to feast. \n\nWe always, always, always get:\n- Chao Tom Banh Hoi (charboiled shrimp wrapped around sugar canes)\n- Tom Nuong Banh Hoi (grilled BBQ shrimp)\n- Cha Gio Anh Hong (house special imperial rolls)\n- Bo 7 Mon (7 courses of beef)\n\nThe Bo 7 Mon includes:\n- Goi Bo (beef salad)\n- Bo Tai Chanh (slices of rare beef cooked at your table)\n- Bo Cha Dum (steamed beef meatball/pate w/ chips)\n- Bo Mo Chai (grilled beef sausage)\n- Bo La Lop (grilled minced beef rolled in lot leaf)\n- Bo Nuong Xa (grilled beef w/ lemongrass)\n- Chao Bo (beef rice porridge)\n\nAll these dishes are served with rice paper, lettuce, mint leaves, cilantro, cucumbers, bean sprouts, pickled carrots and daikon. If you start to run low on these, just let them know and they'll gladly refill.\n\nThere's two different dipping sauces: nuoc mam (fish sauce) and mam nem (fermented anchovy sauce). They have very different tastes so give them both a try. I grew up using nuoc mam and was introduced to mam nem when I first came here; it took a while but it eventually grew on me. From my experience, mam nem usually tastes better with beef.\n\nIt's delicious food and an awesome hands-on eating experience. But be warned! You and your clothes will smell like the food you just ate.", "author": "Sandy T."}

The birthday friend and I ordered 2 Bo 7 Mon ($24 each).  The others ordered BBQ beef rolls with fried rice & salad, and a rice noodle side dish.  The tall, older Vietnamese Chinese male waiter took our orders. He was rude and unfriendly throughout our meal. He alone would keep me away from Anh Hong.  But he was not the only reason keeping me away.\nHere is my take on the Bo 7 Mon:\n--Celery salad: average at 8/10\n--Beef fondue: lean round slides of beef, good 9/10\n--3 types of beef rolls: fatty, greasy, MSG overdose, the lowest beef quality, 5/10\n--Beef pate: good 9/10\n--Rice soup: average 8/10\nThe BBQ beef rolls with fried rice & salad: unremarkable, beef rolls have fillers in the middle (onions, sprouts, or both).\n\nWe do not recommend Anh Hong Restaurant due to 4 reasons:\n--Bad neighborhood: urine-soaked and shit-filled streets, drug addicts and dealers, prostitutes, criminals, etc.\n--Average food with 3 nasty types of beef rolls - fatty, oily, over-MSG'ed\n--Rude waiter\n--Lack of cleanliness: dirty floor, sticky chairs, no paper towels to dry your hands in the restrooms.\n--Noisy", "author": "G D."}

Anh Hong is the place to go.\n\nMy friends and I got the seven course beef and it was delicious. It is A LOT of food so it might not be necessary to get one per person. Between 2 girls and myself we only got two orders of that and there were leftovers. The salad that came first was ok to be honest. It was refreshing but nothing I'd rave about. The Beef fondue was neat and pretty tasty. Next came all of the beef rolls and pate. It's not particularly easy to make the rolls if you're not used to it but not too hard to get the hang of after 2-3 rolls. After all of the rolls, the rice porridge comes in to finish it off. Very tasty porridge and full of flavor. All in all, it was a fun and tasty experience.\n\nHowever, if it's your first time here, come with someone who knows what to do because the waiters aren't the most helpful/friendly. Most people who go here already know what to do so they probably never have to really tell anyone what to do.", "author": "edward k."}

The shrimp's sweetness was heightened by the addition of the sugar cane without being too sweet. I thought the egg rolls were standard, nothing special. As for the chicken, it was overcooked but was sure tasty!\n\nFor the meat courses, everything came out relatively quick and tasted good. Nothing bad stood out to me partly because I simply was so entralled with the newness of my dining experience I forgot to taste taste my food. \n\nI love the fact that they give you a copious amount of rice wapper along with veggies and fish sauce for you to wrap your own meals. It is an amazing hands on dining experience that I am so fortunate to have tried. The next time I go to another establishment that offers a beef course I shall have a better sense of what to look for.\n\nAn authentic Vietnamese family style meal that allows you to be interactive with your meal, can't beat that! \n\n3 star for food\n+1 star for new experiences\n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nAnh Hong gives you the opportunity to experience more than just pho, a way to connect deeper with Vietnamese Culture.

Why? because their 7 course beef is probably one of the best in the city, but their service is horrible. I think i have the right to say that since I have been coming here since maybe being in my mommy's belly. MY family use to live in the Tenderloin and I grew up eating at this restaurant and just like the name of this place, they are famous for 7 course beef. My 2 favorite dishes here, are there lemongrass beef that you have to grill yourself and there beef porridge. the lemongrass  beef isn't in the prefix 7 course so you would have to order this on your own. The beef porridge is pretty amazing, its not your regular porridge you get at a Chinese restaurant.\n\nService- Considering the amount of business they have generated over the pass 2 decades,I'm sure my review wouldn't matter much but feels like people should still know about it. I'm a a big meat and veggie lover and while this is call 7 course beef you still need the veggie to enhance the goodness of the spring roll. Anh Hong doesn't like to refill your veggie platter,  I mean they have to but they prefer that you don't and if the restaurant gets really busy, the owner ( a short and fairly large vietnamese man) would literally ask you to leave if he knows that your  done eating . He comes over and checks and see how far along you are with the food and when you are pretty much done he drops off your bill. And if you are still sitting around he would come over and ask that you leave, I wouldnt mine that he did, but he never say it in a nice way and that's what annoys me . \n\nI would give it 4 stars if it wasn't for the service and he's been like this for the past 20 something years.", "author": "Angela T."}

Having visited the restaurant's website prior, I had high expectations on the decor, ambiance and food only to be let down in the end.\n\nWe arrived prompt for our reservation at 7:30pm since it can be quite difficult to find parking on the \"TL\" We found parking within minutes so I guess we were lucky so we were 30 minutes early for our reservation. We arrived at the restaurant and it was GHETTO! We were overdressed but at least we looked impeccable. We approached one of the waiters regarding our reservation and he told us to wait a few since it was pretty packed and busy at the time. We waited for around 10 minutes and they had a make-shift table put together for us. \n\nWe first started off with drinks, not sure what to get, the waiter recommended a Vietnamese beer, emphasizing that once we try this beer we won't forget it...the beer arrived and we took a sip...ehh? It tasted like all the other Asian beers I have tried, and no, I'll probably forget it. We ordered our food, the 7-course beef, Cha\u00fb Gio\u00f8 Sa\u00f8i Go\u00f8n - Saigon Rolls (Vietnamese Fried Eggrolls Wrapped in Rice Cake, served w/ Fish Sauce, Lettuce & Mint), and Cha\u00efo To\u00e2m Ba\u00f9nh Ho\u00fbi - \"Cha\u00efo To\u00e2m\" (Charbroiled Shrimp Packed around a Sugar Cane Served over Rice Cake). \n\nThe Saigon Rolls were hot and had a good filling in them, nothing too spectacular, forgettable. The Cha\u00efo To\u00e2m Ba\u00f9nh Ho\u00fbi came next, not good. It taste like the crab claw you get at a Chinese restaurant. It was three measly sized pieces for around $14, TOTAL RIPOFF! \n\nWe then started with the first two courses of the 7-course beef. It was ok, nothing that stood out. Then we had a long intermission waiting for our food. After about 15 minutes our 3-5 courses arrived in what we called, our \"DONG\" meat. Everything tasted the same with little variance between the dishes. There was a lot of wrapping of the DONG which got annoying after a while. If I'm paying $20 for this, I hate to get my hands messy, but I guess it is part of the whole experience of customizing what you want and like in your wraps. The last course, a Vietnamese version of congee came, it looked really good but again a disappointment.\n\nAlthough I probably won't visit this location again, my stomach was pleased with my first 7-course beef experience and would definitely recommend it to others who have never tried.", "author": "Myron J."}

For those of you who may not know, rice-paper gets soggy pretty quickly in the bowl of hot water. Rotate the rice-paper in the water until you can get it in the pliable form most of us are familiar with.

I stopped by Anh Hong to try their egg rolls and raw beef salad, and I ended up ordering the 7 courses of beef... BY MYSELF. In hindsight, it was pretty embarassing to sit there... alone... as course after course came and filled up my table.  However, at the time, I was too busy eating to care. \n\nThe 7 course beef dinner at Anh Hong is served with rice paper (and a bowl hot water to rehydrate the wrapping yourself), lettuce, mixed herbs, cucumber, bean sprouts, pickled carrots and daikon.  Aside from the first and last courses (salad and porridge), all these condiments are used to wrap up each course of beef.  \n\n1. Beef salad: slices of cooked beef, daikon, celery, onions, herbs and peanuts in a light vinaigrette. My least favorite course. The beef had a lackluster white appearance and was a bit tough.   \n\n2. Beef carpaccio: raw slices of beef that you cook in a broth. This was pretty good. The broth was vinegar-based and gave the beef a interesting acidic component. \n\n3-6 were various kinds of sausages served on one plate (a grilled beef sausage wrapped in lot leaf, grilled beef rolls mixed with lemongrass and onions, grilled beef sausages, and steamed meat balls). I let out a few audible gasps during this course. These were FANTASTIC! Everything was perfectly seasoned, tender, and juicy. My favorite item was the grilled sausages in lot leaf. \n\n7. Beef rice porridge: This was just ok. Vietnamese rice porridge is not thick and gelatinous like Chinese congee. It was more like broken rice in a beef broth. It was a simple way to end a heavy, meaty meal. \n\nOverall: I was really happy with the indulgent 7-course beef dinner at Anh Hong. After having been to Pagolac, I definitely recommend Anh Hong over Pagolac. While Pagolac may have a better ambiance, Anh Hong's beef courses were more memorable.", "author": "Monelle A."}

This particular dish is very good. It's so annoying as it is a 50:50 chance that they will even have it available. For this I want to give them 2 stars.  There is a common theme here: SUGAR, to overwhelm the taste buds so they don't have to use MSG... I'm a cook so I know the tricks.\n\nAll soups - They literally add sugar so it's \"sweet\". It's so overwhelming that I can't tell if the broth is really good or not. \n\nBanh Hoi - 4 stars but for the price, you get literally 8 thin slices of very sweet meat and 6 little patties of noodles with vegetables to wrap.\n\nRice Plates - Small portions served on HUGE fancy platters to appear like there is a lot of food but it's purely presentation. The meat marinade is loaded with sugar so if you like your meat \"Korean BBQ\" sweet, this place is it... 3 stars\n\nCleanliness - although the place is nice, they don't seem to sweep/mop/dust.

Only grip I have is that too bad they don't have their raw beef salad as one of their 7 courses, that would be awesome!  I keep coming back for their food, but as for their service, I can understand why some customers won't come back. \n\nI don't expect much service when I come to a restaurant like this, definitely nothing fancy so it is normally not a deal breaker for me to come here.  What I don't like is pushy waiters that try to make you order more, first time is ok, but when you keep on insisting, it just gets annoying!!  Their 7 course beef is huge for one person to finish so generally, one order is enough to feed 1 1/2 - 2 people.  I came with 3 others and started off the night w/ an order of eggrolls (which is somewhat costly - $10) and 2 orders of the 7-course beef with a bunch of side dishes (bun, banh hoi, etc).  Waiter gave us a nasty look and told us we needed to order more.  We were definitely  planning to but haven't decided on the others dishes yet, which started the whole pushiness.  He started to give us grief + attitude that we were taking so long to order the other dishes.  It just got very annoying and it didn't help that he was not smiling at all throughout the night.\n\nHe finally warmed up a little towards the end of the night and actually said \"you're welcome\" after the 15+ thank yous we said each time he brought stuff to us or picked up empty dishes from our table.\n\nNot sure when the next time I'll be back here, but I highly doubt it'll be any time soon.

Goi Bo - Beef Salad (Sliced Beef, Carrot, Daikon, Celery,\nOnions, Herbs and Peanuts Tossed in Lemon Dressing)\n\nThe beef salad was one of the best in the 7 (although the slices of meat didn't look exactly like beef) and had a great flavor.\n\n2. Bo Tai Chanh - Beef Carpaccio (Slices of Rare Beef in Ta\u00f9i Chanh Sauce) \n\n#2 was the most fun to eat - First, we got wraps which we dipped in bowls of warm water to soften. Next, we cooked the slices of beef in a boiling pot of water (similar to a fondue pot / hot pot). Then, we wrapped the beef, along with veggies, in the wraps. I also loved the dipping sauces. I wish we got more of this one!\n\n3. Bo La Lop - Grilled Beef Lot Leaf (Grilled Minced Beef Wrapped in \"Piper Lolot\" Leaf)\n\n4. Bo Nuong Xa - Grilled Beef Lemongrass (Grilled Beef Rolls with Onions and Lemongrass)\n\n5. Bo M\u00f4 Chai - Beef sausage (Grilled Beef Sausages)\n\n#3, 4, and 5 looked and tasted somewhat similar (I can't quite remember which one was which), but they were all pretty good. I'd recommend wrapping them in lettuce and using the dipping sauces (since the flavor can get a bit salty / heavy after a bit)\n\n6. Bo Cha Dum - Beef Meat Balls (Steamed Beef Meat Balls)\n\nThis one was popular and consisted of giant meatballs. ....Not my personal fave out of the 7 but definitely not bad.\n\n7. Chao Bo - Beef Porridge (Beef Rice Porridge with ginger and peanuts)\n\nThe porridge was delicious. I wish I knew how to make this at home. Too bad it came at the end - by then I was already full, but I still got seconds!\n\nMinus one star for service - I had to call for a waiter and ask more than once to get my water refilled, and they were a bit slow in bringing out some of the dishes / drinks.  Ambiance is typical Asian home-style restaurant  when I went (loud, a little bit crowded, kids running around) which could be both a good/bad thing. \n\nOverall, I liked it.

Just the name alone sold me.\n\nFor $18,95 pp, you get the following:\n\n1) beef salad - loved it! totally refreshing with shredded daikon, carrots, and sprouts.\n2) thin beef slices - served in a vinegar broth, you should quickly eat this as it cooks super fast in the hot soup.\n\nThe next 4 items are all served together on a plate. They are all made with ground beef, seasoned different ways. I liked them since they all had different flavors.\n3) beef wrapped in leaf (kind of like a dolma but full of ground beef)\n4) beef rolled around lemongrass\n5) beef sausages\n6) beef meat balls\n7) beef porridge - nice hot, and honestly by this course, I was so stuffed I could barely eat half of it. But it was gold, with ginger notes.\n\nEverything is served with fresh vegetables: rice paper, lettuce leaves, carrots, sliced cucumbers, daikon, sprouts, fresh mint, basil, and other Vietnamese herbs. You roll everything inside the rice paper and dip it in the sweet tangy fish sauce, and just EAT! It's filling but you feel good eating all these veggies.\n\nWe were greedy and even ordered the Chao Tom ($13.50), which are shrimp paste balls wrapped around sugar canes. You get 3 of them along with rice noodles and a side daikon salad. You're supposed to cut up the shrimp and size them down to fit your spring rolls that you make.

But I am extremely fluent in the international language of delicious family-style consumption of cow. \n\nSo when The Usual Suspects issued a sameday invite to a chow-down at Anh Hong, I was definitely in! While not officially a UYE, the lucky baker's dozen of us were Yelpers... but we took very few pictures (Thanks, Tammy C.)! \n\nThe East Bay (OAKLANDISH) contingent decided to carpool, and I'm going to blame (a) the wonky directions that Google Maps gave me; (b) the fact that my kick-ass navigation system hasn't been installed yet; (c) my Asianosity - aw... hell: (d) ALL OF THE ABOVE on the fact that I got lost several times en route to the meeting point. \n\nMy directional incompetence forgiven, we set out for our destination. During the quick drive over le bridge, I was informed that we were doing the 7 Courses of Beef. Yippeee!!! \n\nGrowing up, I lived 20 minutes away from THE Little Saigon - you know, the original? The one with the 714 area code? But I'd never eaten this infamous and amazingly orchestrated meal before. \n\nThe fact that very few pictures were snapped (none by me at all) bears testament to the scrumptious things that you can do with beef. While most of us at the table were already well acquainted, there was not a lot of chatter going on - we were too busy occupying our mouths with the real bidness at hand: EATING. \n\nThe price per person is less than $20, and is a full 7 courses of beef with all of the rice paper frisbees, pickled carrots, daikon and snapping fresh herbs that you can shove into your mouth. Fantastic. Eating Yelp Family Style, we were also able to order some fried imperial rolls, a seafood course and a dish that featured succulent chicken, earthy mushrooms and a savory, crispy-crunchy rice crust that I have only ever tasted in com tay cam... or however you spell it. \n\nI was swooning at the first course: beef carpaccio, VN style, chillin' in a bath of vinegar and the prerequisite fish sauce and peanuts. I couldn't get enough of it - and the flavor was luxurious and perfectly complemented by the quick marinade, not at all overwhelmed. \n\nA generous salad was tangy and crisp... which I piled onto my plate and into the baskets full of rice paper \"frisbees\" that you dampen in a bowl of hot water, circling, circling, circling... until \"al dente\" - they continue to soften once you place them on your plate and start filling them up with all manner of goodies which will tempt your palate. \n\nThe imperial rolls were petite and full of meaty flavor without being greasy at all... but still, very rich. I guess you can wrap them in the frisbees with some foliage or eat them plain... I think they're better with the acidity of the pickles and some mint and basil. \n\nI have no idea how Manabu M. ALWAYS looks dapper (suit and tie; impeccably gracious, too) while eating with his hands!  He is such a gentleman, and I adore him to no end... but once, just once, would it be so wicked of me to wish a wayward noodle onto his sleeve?  Or a splash of fragrant sauce upon his tie?  \n\nI didn't love the shabu shabu style dish at first, but found that if I just did a few courtesy swishes, so that my meat was still rare, I much preferred it that way. \n\nI skipped the squid and shrimp (a separate dish) because I was desperately trying to save room for the ensuing courses! \n\nI really enjoyed the 3 different \"beef sausages\" (add your own sophomoric joke here) - which are strange but delicious. They don't have a casing, but I believe that one of them is prepared wrapped in caul fat, which just takes it over the top. Extremely savory - I could only eat one of each - and that was a struggle. \n\nThe beef porridge was, I suppose, the \"light\" component of the whole gustatory experience. I was only able to muster a few timid spoonfuls, dubious in my ability to waddle out of the restaurant of my own accord. \n\nThank you to Peter L. for putting good food and good people together; and for finally showing up to your own soiree. At least you brought a peace offering of cupcakes! \n\nTo JCP and her guests: always lovely to see you again, Gentleman K. and Ms. Gina - you follow in JCP's footsteps and are fabulous beyond words. JCP - another thanks for sharing the wealth of your spirit and your spirits (e.g. from the liquor cabinet) with us! \n\nAnd thanks to my Amigo, for being such a good sport and dining companion. \n\nAt the conclusion of this meal - I looked around the table and saw blissful smiles, heard friendly jokes, and heartfelt toasts. I wondered: are we merely eating family style? Or are we truly eating as a family? \n\nI am going to choose the latter.", "author": "Kim D."}

They are all good in their own ways, but after a while they all start to taste the same.\n4) The beef porridge was my favorite, mmm. I wish they gave you more. haha.\n\nThe meal is filling and very good. Making your own spring roll takes a while to perfect, but once you get a hand of it, you can make them pretty fast. The vegetables (bean sprouts, mints, etc) are pretty fresh. Sometimes the servers are on top of things and refill your cups of water, or bring you more vegetables, and sometimes they don't. It's a hit and miss with this place. The food is good though. \n\nOne drawback is expect to come out smelling like beef. Another thing is that your fingers may come out smelling like the dipping sauce. Other than that, enjoy yourself.\n\n**Update:\nWent here again recently with a large group of friends. Stood at the doorway for the longest time before they came to ask how large my party was. Seated and was still waiting on a friend so we didn't order yet.

He kind of got angry I guess and walked off (I suppose they expect you to know what you want right away).\n\nOur table was pretty neglected after we ordered. Had to ask them to refill our cups of water numerous times, and ask for more rice paper. The same waiter that was pushy earlier kept coming back to tell us how \"We are supposed to eat\" and at first it was nice, but then it just started getting irritating. If I want to roll it this way, LET ME ROLL IT THIS WAY. You don't see me telling you how to be a better waiter. After a while we just avoided asking him for water, just in case he was going to tell my friends and I that we're drinking water wrong too.\n\nSo the check came, and we were a party of 9 so gratuity was added automatically. Gave them exact change. Then the same guy comes back and throws it back at us and says it's not enough. We all look at each other dumbfounded. I guess he missed the $50 bill in there and thought it was a $20. So we went to a different cashier and told him.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-11", "description": "4.0 Stars\n\nI actually tried this Anh Hong before I tried the one in Milpitas.\n\n$18.95 per order of 7 Course Beef.  One order is more than enough for one person. For two people I highly recommend getting one order of the 7 Course Beef and then order some appetizers or side dishes.\n\nIt's important to note this restaurant is in the Tenderloin district in San Francisco so don't expect to find the best of people around the area.  Parking can also be a pain so public transportation is the best way to get here.\n\nSince my dining experience here was very similar in terms of menu items, I'll borrow my review from the Milpitas one.\n\nse7en\n\nI'm not thinking about the Korean Pop Star. I'm talking about SEVEN course BEEF!\n\nLet's count them out and keep track of my fullness for fun. Remember to pace yourself.\n\n1) Special Beef Salad (Goi Bo)\n*Nice, refreshing appetizer.\n*It contained a mixture of pickled carrots, daikon, celery, and thin strips of beef that was all topped off with diced up peanuts and mint leaves.  The beef appeared really similar to pork because it was actually white in color instead of the brownish color I'm used to.\n\nFullness meter: [ |                   ]\n*This was a light appetizer. I had room for more!\n\n2) Beef Fondue/Hotpot (Bo Dung Dam)\n*Fondue/Hotpot done table side.  They bring over a plate of raw beef with onions and then you slowly dip the beef and onions in a simmering red wine vinegar sauce.\n*I recommend cooking the beef until you don't see any red spots left to ensure you won't feel sick afterward. If you have an iron stomach feel free to eat it still a little raw. I probably wouldn't do that myself.\n*Don't overcook the beef though so be sure to carefully watch it.  You don't want it to be super chewy.\n*Place it in the rice paper wrapper and toss on all the vegetables you want.\n\nFullness meter: [ | | |                ]\n*Not even close to being full. I'm feeling pretty good.\n\nNow they started stepping it up. 3, 4, 5, 6 all on one plate.\n\n3) Steamed Beef Meatball (Bo Cha Dum)\n*The meatballs were an interesting mix of various spices, nuts, wood ear mushrooms, peas, and noodles.\n*The plate has some shrimp chips that you scoop the meatballs onto and eat.\n*I found this dish mediocre. I wasn't all that impressed.\n\nFullness meter: [ | | | |             ]\n*I didn't have too much of this dish. I left more room for the sausages.\n\n4) Grilled Beef Sausages (Bo Moi Chai)\n*Tasty grilled sausages that were on the fatty side.  They were still juicy regardless.\n\nFullness meter: [ | | | | | | |        ]\n\n5) Beef Wrapped in Hawaiian Lot Leaf (Bo La Lot)\n*The beef was nice, tender, and flavorful.  The beef was wrapped in these dark green colored leaves that brought out all the flavor.\n\nFullness meter: [ | | | | | | | | |   ]\n\n6) Grilled Lemongrass Wrapped in Beef Roll (Bo Nuong Sa)\n*This was my favorite sausage.  Apparently, these are tenderloin rolls wrapped around grilled lemongrass that are then topped with peanuts.  The innards had a crunchy texture to it so I thought it was grilled onions at first.\n\nFullness meter: [ | | | | | | | | | | ]\n*I'm totally grabbing my stomach at this point. I had to take a quick break before the last dish.\n\n7) Beef Rice Soup/Porridge (Chao Bo)\n*If you have tried Chinese Porridge or 'Jook' before, you'll notice this is more on the watery side.  The thin beef strips, beef broth, ginger, cilantro, green onions, and peanuts culminate to make a nice dish to end the meal with.  \n*It really had deep flavor, but I couldn't get myself to have more than one bowl because I was so stuffed.\n\nFullness meter: [ | | | | | | | | | | ]  | |\n*See that.  I went over my fullness meter and it broke.  :(  I ate so much that I was waiving the white flag by the end of it all.\n\nIf you haven't tried this experience before, DO IT!\n\n== A MUST TRY! ==", "author": "Jason H."}

Nobody I know is going to eat their birthday dinner alone - not on my watch.\n\nWell, we had nine people at dinner and the location I picked was Anh Hong Restaurant.  I had heard lots of things about Anh Hong, but every opportunity to go had been sabotaged by one thing or another.\n\nFirst off - seven courses of anything for $18.95 is a bargain.  Make it beef, and you have an almost automatic fan.  Two in our party knew the owner well, and special treatment was rolled out to us - much appreciated!\n\nWe had the Vietnamese raw beef dish, and it was good.  The quality of meat was fresh and lean.\n\nWe all ordered our drinks - and several of us opted for the white wine.  The owner didn't ask which, so I assumed there was only one and expected nothing great.  However, what he served a Mosel Riesling that was FANTASTIC.  Even cooler was that once we got our drinks, he basically dropped off the bottle of wine at our table for the price of 3 glasses of wine.\n\nI think I fell slightly in love at that moment.\n\nHe asked us if we'd be having the regular seven courses of beef, and one of my friends  told him to just give us whatever is best.\n\nWell, folks - the seven courses of beef turned into more of a 10 courses of sensation.  The first dish that came out was a salad of some sort, and it definitely wasn't beef (more like pork).  It tasted great, seasoned perfectly, and was very refreshing.  Then came the rice wrappers, hot water, vegetables and other condiments as  the other meats came pouring out of the kitchen.  Included was this ENORMOUS prawn type creatures that were cooked perfectly (they were so big I initially thought they were lobsters) as well as fresh beef, sausages of some sort, wrapped and unwrapped, etc.  It was ENDLESS food.\n\nENDLESS!\n\nSome people threw in the towel after 4-5 courses; I, myself, chugged along to the end with a few others, but I was on the verge of throwing in the same proverbial towel when the porridge came out and I realized the onslaught of food had finally ended.  (The porridge, by the way, looked mediocre but tasted amazing; perfect ending to a perfect meal.)\n\nALL of us were unreasonably full.\n\nAnh Hong serves up delicious food, and while the neighborhood is a bit shady - DO GO and try the SEVEN COURSE BEEF.  It's so good, and such a great meal and experience to share w/ friends.\n\nThe service - everyone from the owner to the waiters - were exemplary.  They were efficient, and got the job done fast.  Everything we needed, we got.\n\nI was there last week, and while I am out of town for the next week or so, I intend to go back before 2009 is over to have it one more time.  It's delicious.\n\nHaving said all that - our million course meal came at a higher price that broke down to $43/person.  Since each of us had 2-3 drinks each, factoring that into the $18.95 cost would equal about $32 or so, and the addition of the shrimp and such, along with the raw beef we ordered in the beginning, brought the total significantly higher.  \n\nEven so, the meal was well worth it.\n\nThe place can easily accommodate large groups; just call ahead and ask them for a reservation.\n\nANH HONG is AWESOME.\nAnd Happy Birthday, Nelson!!!!", "author": "Grace K."}

They also have their 7 courses of beef style dinner, which is seven different courses of beef cooked differently. Some are served with lemon grass, rice paper and/or vermicelli. \n\nAll in all this place was attentive in refreshing our hot water and veggies for the rice wraps. If you like burritos, you can think of this as the Asian burrito, except healthier. AND, you get to make it yourself. As for dipping sauces, there was a sweet fish sauce with shredded carrots and a pungent vinegar style sauce which blew up my mouth in terms of spiciness. \n\nMy friends and I had a good time joking about the sugarcane shrimp.\n\nEric: you have to stick it (sugar cane) in your mouth and enjoy the size. ic Tiff likes to nibble that like a chipmunk\nTiff: I like squirrels better.\nMe: however you eat it, don't forget to swallow.

I wasn't too big of a fan of that many sausages, but I lived with it. \n\nThe cost for this experience is currently $18.95 per person. In my opinion, I think it is outrageous to be charging this much per person for just okay food. The flavors are not too intense even with the special dipping sauces.

COME HERE IF YOU'RE A MEATLOVER AND STARVING!\n\nEven though it's SF, there's not a whole lot of Asian restaurants that's open past 9 PM on a weekday. Me and my GF were feeling like Viet food after some after work shopping. I remember hearing about Anh Hong and their 7 Course Beef Menu and immediately hopped on YELP to see what time they closed. It closed at 10 PM, so Anh Hong here we came.\n\nAs we entered, we were promptly seated. We were given our menus and quickly after the waiter was hovering over us. *sigh*  \n\nFOOD:\n*7 Course Beef Menu:\n-Beef Salad: It was ok. The beef looked more like pork b/c it was white in color. It was a bit tough. The salad was made up of pickled daikon, carrots, and cucumbers.\n-Beef Carpaccio: It was good! The beef was very tender and the broth gave it a unique taste different from the typical beef slices you get in pho. The broth was very rich and had a vinegar base. \n-Grilled Beef Wrapped in Lot Leaf: YUMMY! The beef sausage was super tender and flavorful. It was wrapped in a leaf similar to the leaf used in dolmas. \n-Grilled Lemongrass Roll: This was another yummy dish. The beef was perfectly grilled and juicy. We couldn't make out what was inside the roll...possibly tendons b/c it has a crunch to it...I don't think it was onions as the menu had stated. \n-Beef Sausage: This was my FAV out of all the meat items. It was super juicy and very tasty. Well maybe b/c the cut of meat was super fatty! And, anything fatty is good!\n-Beef Meatballs: It was ok! It tasted like all the standard steamed Viet meatballs with the vermicelli noodles in it. Nothing really stood out about it. \n-Beef Porridge: This was the first time I've tried Viet porridge and it's very different from Chinese Jook. It's watery and boiled to the point where the rice has not broken down to it's starchy form. The rice is still a bit al-dente. Other than the texture which I wasn't used to, it had great depth of flavor from the beef broth, ginger, and peanuts.\n\nI have to note the 7 Course Beef Menu was a little misleading. It's more of a menu comprised of different beef appetizer items; like an ham tray if you will. But, it will leave you stuffed! And, like ALL the other reviews say it's enough food for 2 people!\n\n*BBQ Pork Rolls (wrap your own): One of the BEST rolls, I've ever had!  The pork slices were thick and huge, perfectly grilled and seasoned, very flavorful and juicy! The accompanying noodles were in a cake format and was still al-dente; just the way I like it!  The accompaniments (basil, mint, lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber, carrot, etc) were VERY fresh and added the perfect crunch to the roll. Luckily, the waiter had persuaded us to order this item; otherwise we would have missed out!\n\nSERVICE: Overly attentive in a creepy matter from start to finish. As soon as we got in, the waiter was hoovering over us. During the ENTIRE meal, he would stand in back of our table (I had the pleasure of facing him) and STARE. When I would look up and ahead, he would come running up to us and asking if we needed anything. This is such a change from the service I normally get at Asian restaurants.

First course is beef salad. The second course is beef fondue. It's more like you boil the raw beef yourself. The next 4 course came all together, coz, I guess, they are similar kind of food? They include 3 kinds of beef sausages and one huge beef meat ball. And all these came with mixed vegetables, cucumber, bean sprouts and carrots, most importantly, the rice sheets!!! What you have to do is take a piece of dry rice sheet and immerse it in a bowl of water in a circular motion, and then take it out put it on your plate. Then you can start to put vegetables, beef and sauce on it. (btw, their sauces are really stinky but good @@)  By the time you are ready to wrap those stuff all together, the rice sheet is already softened like what you had with spring rolls =D, this will only take a minute or two. So now you just wrap it and eat! The last course is the beef congee, kind similar with those Cantonese dim sum kind congee.  \n\nIt was fun and the food was so tasty, oh, did I mention it's cheap too. 4 of us, ordered 2 of the seven courses of beef and a raw beef in vinegar appetizer, which was also really good. These added up about $15 each. I'm totally gonna come back again!", "author": "Serena H."}

After an errand in the city my wife and I parked near Little Saigon and went walking in search of a Vietnamese dinner. Hey, there's Lee's Sandwiches. Not. Pho 2000? Nah, not really in the mood for pho. Pagolac! Let's try that. Rats, it's closed. So we decided to keep walking for a few blocks to get to Cordon Bleu, a restaurant we enjoyed a couple of years ago when one of my friends was visiting SF. When we finally made it to Cordon Bleu, you guessed it, it was CLOSED. Call it our Monday night bad luck that so many Viet places shut their doors on a Monday. We kept walking and eventually got back to Larkin St. and decided to cross over and try Anh Hong.\n\nAs we entered there were a few tables occupied but a lot of empty tables too. The waiter for some reason decided to motion us to the rear corner table, behind the aquarium and close to a table of four rather large people. We were like, no, we'd rather not be so cramped over there. After a couple of minutes he had another table cleared so we sat down and checked out the menu. Lots of 7 courses of beef, lots of fondue items and grill-it-yourself meals. I wasn't really in the mood for fondue or bo bay mon (especially not for $21 per person).\n\nWe settled on bo tai chanh for an appetizer. For main dishes my wife ordered #39, a kind of beef dish where the beef is rolled around onions in little sausage shapes, which comes with a boring side salad (mostly iceberg lettuce) and a mound of rice; and I ordered #49, rice steamed with chicken and shrimp in a hot pot. We asked for ice water.\n\nBo tai chanh came out rather quickly and we gobbled it up due to hunger. It was decent, but the sauce was too sweet. 3 stars out of 5. A few minutes later my wife's dish arrived. It was under-seasoned. 2 stars out of 5. 20 minutes later my order still had not arrived, nor had the ice water we ordered. Finally we asked again for our ice water and they brought it, and a couple minutes later my food arrived, steaming and sizzling in a hot pot. My wife was nearly done with her food by then but she was clearly intrigued by my order. Once I started eating, my disappointment began to fade. The steamed rice was better than I expected; the mushrooms were very tasty. Also, the bottom layer of rice was crunchy (almost like popcorn) and delicious. So I'll give my dish 4 stars out of 5.\n\nGiven the prices this place charges - consistently a couple of dollars per dish higher than we're used to paying for comparable quality Vietnamese food - I'd say I'm kind of disappointed. Only the surprisingly tasty #49 hot pot rice pulled it from a 2-star experience up to a 3-star experience.\n\nWould I recommend Anh Hong or return? Probably not, given the other Vietnamese options in Little Saigon. I just have to remember that Monday is not the night to go out looking for Vietnamese food.", "author": "Richard C."}

Love the fondue and porridge. \nSugar cane shrimp:  well balanced and flavorful. \nImperial rolls: who doesn't love fried food?   Tasty and the right ratio of filling to meat. \nLarge prawns:  wasn't sure if this was on the menu, was recommended by a friend and it was absolutely delish!  Prawns were almost the size of my palm!  Drool...\n\nMilpitas:\n7 course beef: I think the flavors were more spot on compared to SF. \n\nDifferences between the two locations:\nSF has basil and cilantro to wrap your own rolls, which gives a more fresh and vibrant taste. \nMilpitas: has the grilled whole catfish. Been wanting to try it but it's too much fish for two and was $55 MP. \n\nService:\nBoth locations were attentive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-27", "description": "Tips for when dining at Anh Hong:\n\n* Get the 7 course beef!  \n\n* If it's a dinner for two, insist that you only want one order of the said 7 course beef.  It's $18.95 for one very generous order that will leave the two of you very stuffed (granted you are on a date with a woman, and not two ravenous lumberjacks).\n\n* If your appetite is bigger than you think, try their BBQ pork chop over rice -- it's delicious.  Other items I've ordered off of their menu were hits or misses.  Stick with the 7 course beef, I tell ya.\n\n* Want to add some vino to the romantic dinner?  Bring in a bottle of wine and they'll charge you $10 for corkage fee.  A better deal than ordering from their not-so-impressive wine list.\n\n* Try not to pack so much onto your rice paper.  Yes, the ingredients are extremely fresh and you're inclined to pack in as much as you can.  But the key to making a good wrap that won't break apart is to be moderate. \n\n* Roll up your sleeves.  When biting into the wrap you just so diligently made, the fish sauce and fermented anchovy sauce you've slathered your meat with will dribble down your arms.\n\n* Bring some potent antibacterial soap with you or just avoid any hands-on interaction (e.g. giving someone a massage, allowing your date to smell your hands, etc.) after dinner.  Your hands will smell like fish sauce, no doubt about that.\n\n* Enjoy your meal!

Those places dont come close. They are over priced for the food they provide. \n\nWe went last friday night for dinner, and for 2 of us, 7 courses of beef, including salad, fondue, 3 different kinds of grilled beef, 1 beef pate and a beef porridge to finish off the meal, was a total of $41!! ($18.95 per person, plus tax). The grilled beef was so good - my favorite is the grilled beef wrapped with Hawaiin leaves. Its freshly grilled, you still get the smokey aroma - goes so well with the salad wraps!\n\nWe tried to finish off everything and we did - But we were stuffed! This could've easily fed a 3rd person. The meal was completely satifying -fresh, good quality ingredients- freindly, curtious and prompt service. I am surprised at this price range and the amount of food they serve, the quality was not compromised at all! \n\nThe decor is somewhat expected. Its been here for over 20 years. I think they've done a restoration once in that time, but they could go for another one. And they would probably draw a more yuppy crowd (sorry, Yuppies was the best way to describe it) and get more business like Le Cheval in Oakland does. Not to mention its in the Tenderloin dist. AND on top of that, parking requires about 15-20 minutes of circling around this wonder area in SF. \n\nSo rightfully, this place serves the typical patron of your traditional vietnamese family , who expects quality/authentic food for an honest price. With that said, dont expect the waiter to give you the 101 on how to make your own rice paper wrap. Bring a friend who knows what they're doing or ask the guy at the cashier - he's the owners son, and actually does speak english and can  help you. The waiter on the other hand, is there to make sure you have everything, and serves you promptly - you'll appreicate this with the 7 courses of beef which you'll constantly need things to be replenished  - the salads for the wraps, hot water to soak the rice paper, sauce and whatever else.\n\nMy advise,  for every 3ppl, order 2 servings of the 7 course beef, bill will be $41 and you'll be very happy and full!", "author": "Mai T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-21", "description": "After reading some reviews and having experienced the 7 course beef meal at Pagolac, I thought it might be worth experiencing someone else's version just to compare.  I went to the Anh Hong website and learned how they purportedly invented the 7-course beef experience, and I was fooled by the pictures of a brightly-lit, 80's-ish restaurant and thought I was going to get a retro-feeling establishment with a full bar and decent lighting.  Not so much.\n\nAnh Hong looks like a faded-out version of a diner without a counter.  Way faded out.  The place could stand to get a makeover because it's kind of hard to tell that the restaurant is even open when you show up ... so much space and no atmosphere.\n\nIf you are hungry when you arrive, you leave without an inch of space in your belly if you order the 7-course beef meal.  It's a ton of food, and it does taste pretty good.  What is hard to ignore, though, is the lack of care that goes into preparing and presenting the food at Anh Hong.  \n\nIf you want to get filled up on food with a large group, drink some beer and have your food plopped down in front of you, this is perfect.  If you are trying to impress a date, or you're not a fan of places that make you wonder what the Public Health score is, you might want to avoid Anh Hong.", "author": "Jenny K."}

Sadly, I never tried the last course (the beef rice soup) but I more than made up for that omission by eating what felt like 6,723 sausages and various beef rolls...if crack were a sausage, Anh Hong would be an illegal pleasure.\n\nPretty much everything was great, but my faves were courses two through seven (assuming that we had eight courses):\n\n- The second course was thinly-sliced slices of tenderloin that you cook in a red wine vinegar sauce (fondue style) and add to veggies to prepare your own spring rolls.\n\n- The third course was beef, chicken, shrimp and squid that you cook on a hot plate and again add to veggies to prepare your own spring rolls. I didn't see this item on the menu on Anh Hong's website, so I'm assuming that it was either a 'bonus course', or that it's combined with the fondue (which would bring us back down to seven courses).\n\n- The fourth course was some very tasty charcoal-grilled beef sausages. Suffice to say, I ate a bunch of these...\n\n- The fifth course was some large steamed beef meatballs that you chop up and enjoy with shrimp chips...excellent!\n\n- The sixth course was minced beef mixed with spices and wrapped in Hawaiian leaves. This was by far my favorite item of the meal, and I would guess that I ate no less than eight of these bad boys!\n\n- The seventh course was charcoal grilled tenderloin rolls topped with peanuts and lemongrass sauce. I was running out steam at this point and only had one or two of these.\n\nEvery once in a while a meal comes along that is so good, but also so huge that you need to unleash your 'inner fat guy' (I weighed 300 lbs. at one time) to take it down, and this was definitely one of these meals! It was worth every stomach-stuffing (towards the end) bite though...and very affordably priced.\n\nCount me in as a future Anh Hong repeat customer!", "author": "Art D."}

Always a good sign. The menu lists a plethora of traditional Vietnamese dishes but as the place markets its specialty as 7-course beef, that's what we opted to order.\n\nThe first dish was goi bo, or beef salad. It was validating to see traditional Vietnamese salad ingredients such as basil, mint, red onions, and carrots - all julienned or finely chopped. They even served two sauce options, both fish sauce-based and very delicious.\n\nThe second dish is a favorite in most Vietnamese households and is so very refreshing: beef fondue with special vinegar sauce. The dish is served with slices of raw tenderloin beef, an overflowing plate of greens, and pickled veggies. To eat, you just cook the beef in the fondue pot and then make a spring roll with the cooked beef, greens, and pickled veggies. Dipping sauces are the same as the salad above.\n\nThe third, fourth, fifth and sixth courses all arrived at the same time on one platter. It was a sight to behold! One item was steamed beef pate - delicious meat balls mixed with nuts, mushrooms and various Vietnamese spices. Another item was grilled beef sausage with a flavor that made me miss Grandmother's cooking. An item I don't think I've ever had was the beef wrapped in Hawaiian leaf. This was also mind boggling. But my absolute favorite of this combo was the slices of tenderloin in lemon grass and green onion and grilled to tender perfection. \n\nBy the time the seventh and final course arrived, I was ready to burst. I had already scanned ahead and knew that beef rice porridge was coming. I expected a thicker consistency but was relieved to see that the broth was at once watered down and strongly flavored. \n\nNow that I am just getting to know SF's Little Saigon, I am reluctant to But I do want to say that this place kicks ass.", "author": "Baochi N."}

The Chao Tom (Shrimp on sugar canes) is also delicious. The price for the 7 courses of beef, $18.95, was higher than the last time i came, but still a good deal for the amount of food that you get.\n\nThe 7 courses of beef consisted of:\n1. Beef salad\n2.

Beef porridge\n\nEach order of the 7 courses of beef comes with a bowl of rice paper, a plate of greens (lettuce, mint, and cilantro), and a plate of sides (bean sprouts, pickled carrots and daikon, and cucumbers). I always love to make my own rolls with the rice paper and all the different sides. All of the beef was very tender and flavorful. The beef carpaccio comes with a small charcoal hotpot and beef broth to cook it in. Items 3 through 5 come together as a sort of a sampler of beef sausages. The beef wrapped in lot leaf was my favorite! \n\nThe service was very good. As soon as we finished one course of beef, the waiters brought out the next one almost immediately.

However, that was easily addressed by requesting an order of Tom Bo Nuong Vi (marinated beef and shrimp for self-grilling at the table; similar to korean bbq). Here are the highlights:\n- beef papaya salad was a little bland and lacked the variety of texture that is what usually makes the dish; maybe the papaya was not as fresh as I'm used to, or they could have added some shredded celery stalk for more crunch.\n- beef fondue with vinegar broth, this was tasty...although the beef slices were a bit thick, that made it easier to not overcook the meat. Plus, they put some additional seasoning in the broth (not just straight vinegar)...I like.\n- shrimp was hard to cook because of the butterfly cut, but it was very pretty while grilling. They seasoned the beef and shrimp with the Mam Nem...yummy! The additional sauce tantalizes your taste buds with sweet saltiness.\n- Bo Cha Dum and the variety of \"meatballs\" were their best offerings of the 7 courses, in my opinion. Very well done on this one. Everything on the plate was delicious.\n- Chao Bo...I love love love porridge. And usually Bo 7 Mon restaurants don't put much care in the last course because it's just meant to wash down the previous 6 courses. However, Anh Hong makes a delicious beef porridge. They include slivers of kidney and liver which you can hardly taste unless you're paying attention -- and man, was I! YUM-MEeeeee!\n\nOk. So if all of that doesn't have you walking out your door right now, just think of the mad bragging rights you'll have after your visit to Anh Hong...\"dude, I just had SEVEN courses of beef. That's right. Seven.\" Don't forget the beer. If you want to do it Vietnamese style, go with a beer with high bitterness rating (e.g. Bud, Heineken, etc).\n\nBecause I mentioned the service earlier, here is an obligatory anecdote about it: En route to said restaurant, my friend's finger got in the way of a car door shutting. So I told the waiter about it and asked him for a bag of ice.

My favorite are the la lot wrapped sausages.\n\nJust for anyone who doesn't know (hey, I didn't), the proper way to eat courses 2-5 is to roll the meat up in the rice paper w/ the accompanying fresh vegetables to make spring rolls & then dip them into the sauces. You could probably roll up course 6 also, but I like to eat those w/ just the rice crackers. Even though the price is \"$18.95 per person\", you can order one serving's worth & probably feed two people. I went with 8 people & we were pretty full with 4 servings. & a final note: I personally think it is really important to understand that these dishes are all considered \"drinking dishes\" in Vietnamese culture (ok, except for the jook -- that's considered a ~good health~ dish). So, to really enjoy the meal, drink a lot of beer!", "author": "Ruby H."}

The food has always been good and at the time, my parents kept saying that their veggies are really fresh and nice looking.

I don't really like all 7 courses, so I like it when my dad orders other more authentic vietnamese beef dishes.  You can still wrap them, but they are just different kind.  At Anh Hong, you can get the kind where they give you a grill, and you can grill your own slice of beef and all.  Sooo yummy.\nThe seven course beef is only $17.95 per person and they are not sticklers here that they count the # of people.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-01", "description": "An Anthropology of Vietnam in Seven Courses\nOmid T=======.\nAnthro 132A\n\n\n In the course of examination of a culture, it would be irresponsible to omit the study of foodways as a cultural phenomenon as tied to religion, holidays, ethnic identity, domestic economy, and history.\u00ba The ideas expressed herein are the result of 2.5 hours of immersive field study at Anh Hong restaurant in San Francisco, CA, as related to Bo 7 Mon, (Bo Bay Mon) known commonly in the English language as Beef Seven Ways or Seven Courses of Beef.\n\n\n Bo 7 Mon is ideally representative of Vietnamese culture from the first millennium BC to the present day, reflecting Chinese, Khmer (Cambodian), and French influences in everyday foodways. Created as recently as the 1950's by the progenitors of Anh Hong's owners\u00ba\u00ba, Bo 7 Mon is now widely served at Vietnamese wedding banquets, as well as restaurants throughout the world. The influence of this feast is not only far-reaching, but has been propagated in a relatively short period of time. It is the aim of this paper not to examine the meal's influence upon culture, but culture's influence upon the meal.\n\n\n Before continuing, it is important to identify the components of Bo 7 Mon, as presented by Anh Hong. Please note that other restaurants may present the dishes in a different order, or with several different components altogether.\n\n\n Bo 7 Mon is comprised of Goi Bo (a beef salad mixed with assorted vegetables), Bo Dung Dam (beef fondue in which slices of raw tenderloin are dipped in a hot pot of vinegar sauce), Bo Cha Dum (steamed beef pate with nuts and mushrooms), Bo Moi Chai (grilled beef sausages), Bo La Lot (mince beef wrapped in Lot leaf), Bo Nuong Sa (grilled beef roulades around scallion, flavored with lemongrass), and Chao Bo (beef rice soup with scallions, ginger and lemongrass).\n\n\n The first and most obvious element of Bo 7 Mon is Bo or, more simply, beef. While Chinese cuisine serves as the basis of Vietnamese cooking (i.e. the use of broths, noodles, and the extensive incorporation of rice), the consumption of beef is representative of the vast influence of the Mongol empire, namely the Mongolian invasion of the 13th century.+\n\n\n Furthermore, the Khmer influence from neighboring Cambodia brought forth the use of what is commonly referred to now as small plates, as opposed to large, centralized meals.+\n\n\n Taking the above-named influences and mating them with the abundance of fresh vegetables and herbs and rich fishing waters of the Mekong Delta has resulted in much of the Vietnamese cuisine that survives to this day. Thus, one is commonly able to consume beef accompanied by rice noodles, rice wrappers, fish sauce, carrots, daikon, sprouts, mint, and basil at any of thousands of Vietnamese food outlets.\n\n\n The brutal French occupation of Vietnam from 1858 to 1954 resulted in much bloodshed and colonialist fallout, as documented in various historical studies. In terms of foodways, it had the more positive effect of widening the scope of Vietnamese cuisine by introducing French cooking techniques and customs. The Bo Nuong Sa is an exemplary dish, using native lemongrass to flavor thinly julienned green onions wrapped in a tightly rolled beef roulade,++ a cooking method unused in the region before the occupation.\n\n\n It was also the French proclivity to serve meals in multiple courses that influenced the Bo 7 Mon consumed by millions of Vietnamese today. Per the research of Steel,\u00ba\u00ba the proprietor of Anh Hong's great grandmother wanted to introduce French-style, multicourse meals to Vietnam.\n\n\n As uncovered further in these field studies, it is common practice to drink Vietnam's 33 Export beer as a gustatory enhancement for Bo 7 Mon. Research into the background of 33 reveals further French influence, as well as Dutch. 33 is a beverage brewed by an arm of Netherlands-based Heineken International that specializes in the manufacture of beer in former French colonies, such as Vietnam and Morroco#. (Previous work by this researcher has found that 33 in Morocco is identical to 33 from Vietnam.)\n\n\n It can thus be gleaned that the components and the whole of Bo 7 Mon (and its accompanying beverages) as found at Anh Hong exemplify regional and colonial influences on modern Vietnamese culture, and that foodways are indeed a suitable means of examining a culture.\n\n\n While it would be irresponsible to condone invasion and occupation, or to make light of people's struggles against said invaders and occupiers, it can be scientifically concluded that the Chinese, Mongolian, and French sacking of Vietnam have resulted in something truly delicious.\n\n\n Sources:\n\u00ba Jaffe and Fredericksen, 2005; \u00ba\u00ba Steel, 2006; + Civil, 1995; ++ Pepin, 1976; # Heineken International annual report, 2006", "author": "Omid T."}

UM HELLO! I'M CHINESE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID ASSHOLE! AND DON'T MAKE COME IN THE KITCHEN AND CUSS YOU OUT IN CHINESE, ENGLISH, SPANISH AND VIETNAMESE!!!! but per my friend's request, i bit my tongue! we ended up ordering 2 orders of 7 courses since we were able to get her mom to join us who was right around the corner. halfway through the meal, the bowl of water for the rice wrappers had gotten cold so we asked for it to be refreshed as well as a refill on auntie's cup of hot water and our waters too! he came back with a refreshed bowl of hot water and that was it. we proceeded to wave someone down for the next 15 or 20 mins to get our water refilled. no luck. even though they was coming by to throw our food on the table, they acted like they didn't hear us about the water. FINALLY, she got someone's attention and asked him to refill CUP OF HOT WATER AND CUP OF COLD WATER! the waiter/owner came back with one hot water. so she asked again for her cold water. he let out a big sigh and came back with the called water and told her \"you tell me to come here too many times! you asked for hot water and then cold water and what else you need now?\" my friend calmly told him than \"no, i asked for refills on the hot and the cold water the first time YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME!\" then she told him in vietnamese that she's been asking for the water for 20", "author": "jenna l."}

I actually thought this place is out nice, it is like a typical authentic Asian restaurant, the hole on a wall kinda of place. We order the infamous 7 course of beef. I thought they were all quite interesting. I like how they presented all different ways of cooking the beef. But I was kinda expecting more, because in one case, the dish with 3 rolls were supposed to be three different kinds. And I like some of the dishes, like the one with beef wrapped in leaves. I thought that was very delicious. We also had the BBQ beef where we get to BBQ our own beef in front of us in a tiny grill. The beef slices were super thin and were just perfect for the grill. And the point is after the grill, you get to eat the meat the Vietnamese way with them wrapped in rice paper and veggies! Overall, I will definitely recommend this place for trying something new and unique.  But I don't feel a draw for a crave to return for it.", "author": "Fung S. O."}

However, this time instead of receiving perhaps 50 cents worth of additional vegetables to enjoy with our dinner, we were denied.  I was beyond words.  I can understand if the question was to get more beef, but to deny us additional servings of the cheapest item on the menu?  Unacceptable.\n\nHence the one star.

Comes with rice paper, lettuce, bean sprouts, and picked carrots. \n- Shrimp rolls were delicious! especially being wrapped with rice noodles in rice paper. \n- eggrolls: sooo good. but nothing special\n- 1. beef salad was OK, not usually a big fan of that but it's really refreshing. \n- 2. beef carpaccio? with raw beef and you dip it in a soup like hot pot. this dish is one of their worst dishes and so we decided to get something else to substitute it. \n- 3. grilled beef lot leaf: DELICIOUS. one of my favorites! i love how it has peanuts inside to give it that crunch factor.\n- 4. grilled beef lemongrass: also one of my least favorite dishes because the beef is dry and the onions overpower the beef.\n- 5. beef sausage: my ALLL time favorite!! the number one dish that i look forward to.\n- 6. beef meat balls: love this so much! it's AMAZING.\n- 7. beef porridge: watery compared to what i'm used to. not really a fan but it's a good way to cleanse the body after all that beef. too much of a  ginger flavor. \n\ndefinitely recommend coming to this place! soo good! but parking can be a little hard.", "author": "Grace S."}

The place feels more like a chinese restaurant with the same kind of menus and the tank of karp.  Pagolac feels a little bit hipper with stone floors, vietnamese hipster servers, and amazing flavors that pop.  I wasn't too impressed with Anh Hong's shrimp on sugar cane -- tasted meaty rather than flavorful.  I was also kind of bummed that they expected us to pour our dipping sauce out of a glass because it meant that there were puddles all over the paper table cloth.  If I had never been to Pagolac though, Anh Hong would be good and nice and I would come back.  However, Pagolac is a few blocks away and it's just sexier.", "author": "Elena S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-08-25", "description": "As beef tenderloin is to cow, Ahn Hong is to SF dinner options.  A center-cut, great choice, offering beefy possibilities galore. \r\n\r\nHow fitting then, that this Vietnamese restaurant should be nestled in the heart of the bustling and hustling Tenderloin, a neighborhood that I love for its character and originality.\r\n\r\nSlightly off the path of the other restaurants on the Little Saigon strip, I noticed that the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant, as well as the friendliness of the staff sets Ahn Hong apart from some of its neighboring businesses.  While our Yelpish group (nicely organized by Connie & Shatangi) was definitely the more multi-cultural than the other clientele in the restaurant, I did not feel that I would need a translator or guide for a return visit.\r\n\r\nThe 7 Courses of Beef dinner was a culinary delight and an excellent value (approximately $15 for the dinner as listed on the menu).   Shatangi wisely added an 8th course which was a combo grill of chicken, shrimp, squid, and of course...more beef - adding variety to our already vast spread of dishes.  Shatangi told you and now I'm telling you:  good choice.\r\n\r\n1/ Beef in a Salad - excellent start, fresh greens, veg, onions, chopped peanuts in a citrusy dressing with very thin slices of beef - the least beefy of the beef dishes, and a great segway into the gluttony to follow...\r\n2/ Beef in a Hot Pot - you cook, you assemble, you dip, you eat, all wrapped up in rice paper wrappers.  Provided to you are the raw beef, veggies, greens & herbs, and dipping sauces.  The anchovy one is deliciously sweet & savory - good on everything (even cream puffs, but I'm getting ahead...)\r\n3/ Beef on a Grill - you cook, you assemble, you dip, you eat...\r\n*Extra Course*/ Mixed Grill (Chicken, Squid, Shrimp, mo' Beef) - you cook, you...oh, you're getting it now\r\n4/ Beef in a Sausage - lil links of savory goodness.  Not too fatty or greasy, very filling\r\n5/ Beef in a Ball - meatloaf-like consistency (sorta, kinda) to scoop onto a big rice cracker.  Yum.\r\n6/ Beef in a Wrap - Tea leaf wrapped around beef sausage AND Beef wrapped around sliced onions.  Just when you thought you could not pop one more thing into your mouth....they hit you with these little wonders\r\n7/ Beef in Soup - brothy/ricey soup with bits-o-beef, ginger, spring onions.  Helps to ease 1-6 down the necessary passages.  Well, that's what I told myself.\r\n\r\nBeverage of choice:  for me, Beer 33.  Cold, light and highly drinkable.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we were treated to Beard Papa's Cream Puffs courtesy of Michael M.  An unholy match was made when Grace M. doused her Puff in the anchovy dipping sauce and declared it delicious.  Do not try this at home.\r\n\r\nThis type of dinner takes time, so my advice is to go with people you really like who are open to new experiences and are somewhat adventurous in their eating habits.  Also, since you are constantly cooking, dipping, etc, wear clothes that will not suffer should you splatter a little.  Other than that, just bring a big appetite and you will not be disappointed.  And how, Ahn Hong!", "author": "Liz S."}

This is definitely a place that you come for the beef, since the waiter kept repeating \"no noodle, only beef\".  I think I found myself laughing most of the time because the waiters were hmm.. I guess very \"involved\" in our food experience.  After showing my friends how to wrap their food, they would constantly stand over our shoulders making sure we were doing it right and if we strayed from the path they would let us know and question every choice we made.  I think they were just trying to be helpful but I'm not gonna lie it was kind of intimidating.  I was boring and just had the chicken which was fine and I was able to try whatever beef dish my friends had and thought it was pretty good.  Now that I know the whole process I think I wouldn't mind giving it another try.  But I am slightly nervous about going again and accidentally wrapping it incorrectly.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

The Anh Hong restaurants have passed down the secret recipes of their seven beef courses down through the generations, thus serving the most authentic Seven Course Beef! The seven courses are as follows:\n\n1. Goi Bo (Beef salad): This is a mixture of carrots, bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, garlic, lemon grass, onion and a few other things, tossed in a lime/fish sauce dressing.\n2. Bo Dung Dam (Beef fondue): They provide you with raw (completely redred raw!!), thinly sliced meat and onions and a pot of boiling broth. You are supposed to first take one of the hard rice papers and dip it in the bowl of warm water that they provide. This makes the rice paper soft. Put it on your plate. Put some lettuce/carrots/daikon/cucumber or whatever veggies you want. Then you take a piece of meat and swish it around in the broth and put it on top of the veggies. Roll it up like an eggroll, dip it in the sauce the give you and enjoy!\n3. Bo Cha Dum (Beef...meatloaf?): This is like a meatloaf/meatball of beef mixed with some veggies like peas and other things. \n4. Bo Moi Chai (Beef sausage): This is sort of like a beef sausage the size of like..two of your pinky finger. They grill it up for you to enjoy.\n5. Bo La Lot (Beef sausage wrapped in leaves): This is a different kind of beef sausage as the prior, but about the same size and has a thin leaf wrapped around it before its grilled. You're supposed to eat the leaf :)\n6. Bo Nuong Sa (Beef rolls): This is a thin slice of beef wrapped around onions (I think) and then grilled.\n7. Chao Bo (Beef porridge): This is....well, it's beef porridge. Porridge with bits of beef in it.\n\nAs you can probably tell, it's quite the meal! Last time we came with 7 people, ordered 6 orders of the seven course beef and everyone was stuffed. Very reasonably priced too; we each paid ~15 bucks.\n\nOverall, such a great place to get some good, authentic Vietnamese food. I always go home full and happy!", "author": "Christine L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-08-29", "description": "At our last Yelpy international dinner, Shatangi suggested that we have our next one at Anh Hong. He raved about the famous 7 Courses of Beef Menu. To make sure I wouldn't be held responsible for killing any Yelpers by meat overdose, I planned our Vietnamese 7 Course Beef Extravaganza to occur 3 weeks after the Meat-O-Rama at Espetus.\r\n\r\nThe owners at Anh Hong were so accomodating to our party of 35. They allowed us to take over the entire mid-section of the restaurant without charging us for overbooking. Hen and I arrived at 7pm, and the tables were already set up and reserved for us. Since we were a bit early, we decided to sneak a cocktail down the street at Rye before dinner. Fortunately , we ran into Michael M on our way and kidnapped him and his 2.5 dozen of Beard Papas cream puffs. I was about to eat one of each flavored puff, thinking, how can a $15.00 7-course beef dinner be filling? $15?? It can't be THAT much food. But I refrained from grabbing the yellow boxes from Michael and promised I would wait until after the dinner. After a round of refreshing cocktails, we headed back to Anh Hong, where almost 2/3 of our party had already arrived. I LOVE it when people are EARLY and ON TIME!! (we got there at exactly 7:30)\r\n\r\nAs I passed out Yelp schwag and made people wear name tags, Mitch went on a photo-taking frenzy and the servers took our drink orders. They had a good selection of Asian beers, Vietnamese coffee and teas. \r\n\r\nAnd then, our 8 course beef dinner was served (believe it or not, Shatangi added one more)...\r\n\r\nEach item was served with rice paper, mixed vegetable & greens, cucumber, carrots and bean sprouts. My fiancee had perfected the rice paper wrapping technique during our visit to Yummy Yummy, and was happy to showcase his talents again. I also sat next to Cassio, who found this rice paper to be genius. He referred to it as a big thin communion wafer. The plate of 50 or so wafers and hot water was placed in front of me, and between my fiancee and Cassio, I could have sworn I was judging some rice paper wrapped food eating contest. My fiancee would have won for presentation, but Cassio would have won for creativity. That guy was wrapping EVERYTHING! Let me explain:\r\n\r\nCourse #1. Goi Bo Special Beef Salad - A refreshing flavorful mixed salad:\r\nThough the rice paper was not for this course, Cassio wrapped all of it in rice paper.\r\n \r\nCourse #2. Bo Dung Dam Beef Fondue - Slices of Tenderloin fondue at your table in a simmering red wine vinegar sauce:\r\nAs the beef was cooking in the fondue, Cassio wrapped ALL other available non-beef contents in rice paper. \r\n\r\nCourse #3. Beef and shrimp to char-grill yourself:\r\nCassio finally started to wrap beef in the rice paper, and managed to stuff an entire wrap into his mouth as Kristina took his picture\r\n \r\nCourse #4. Bo Cha Dum Steamed Beef Meat Balls - Delicious Meat Balls mixed with Nuts, Mushrooms and various traditional Vietnamese spices: \r\nMe: \"This is the last course right? We've been eating for ever. UGHH!\"\r\nCassio: \"I NEED MORE WRAPPERS!\" \r\n \r\nCourse #5. Bo La Lot Beef Wrapped in Hawaiian Lot Leaf - Minced beef mixed with spices and wrapped in an aromatic leaf freshly flown from Hawaii:\r\n\"We need more hot water!\" In the meantime, Cassio managed to wrap food into a half dry rice paper.\r\n \r\nCourse #6. Bo Moi Chai Grilled Beef Sausages - Sausages mixed with spices grilled over charcoal to perfection:\r\nNew hot water bowl served. Cassio concluded, \"The wet rice paper is definitely easier to wrap.\"\r\n \r\nCourse #7. Bo Nuong Sa Beef Grilled with Lemon Grass - Delicious charcoal grilled tenderloin rolls topped with peanuts and lemongrass sauce: \r\n\"I LOVE THESE THINGS! I'D WRAP ALL MY FOOD IN THESE ALL THE TIME!!\"\r\n   \r\nCourse #8. Chao Bo Beef Rice Soup - A rich flavorful beef rice soup:\r\nCassio tried to wrap the soup, but failed. Instead, he wrapped whatever was left over in rice paper and dipped it into the porridge.\r\n\r\nI made sure to keep the rice paper away from Cassio when he was eating a Beard Papas. Unfortunately, we could not keep Grace from dipping her cream puff into the fish sauce.", "author": "Connie C."}

I made sure I had a light lunch to beef up for this beefy meal. \r\n\r\nThe highlights of the 7 course beef meal was actually not the beef for me, but what enhanced this meat.  \r\n1) this salad of julienned and sweet pickled cucumbers, turnips, carrots, with thin slices of beef, was topped with chopped peanuts and pieces of FRIED GARLIC.  yumm!\r\n2) hotpot-cooked thin slices of rare beef, wrapped in rice paper, with lettuce, mint, cilantro, pickled carrots and turnips, sliced cucumbers, and bean sprouts.... the star of this dish... Vietnamese fish sauce (this has a recurring role for tonight's performance, as i used it in everything I ate tonight)\r\n3) shabu-shabu style grilling of different meats: thinly sliced chicken, beef, calamari, shrimp, and ONIONS... all about the grilled onions.  Then you, again, serve this with the rice paper roll and veggies from course #2.

You can eat this by itself or in the spring roll format.\r\n7) the same browned sausages from #4, but this time, wrapped in some form of green leafy vegetable and grilled (not sure if this was mint)\r\n\r\nCourses 2-6 is a great way for your group to work for their food.\r\n\r\n((((my favorite: course #8 (because Yelp got the hook up): a lovely rice porridge/jook/congee/lugaw with strips of beef liver, chopped green onions, and GINGER!))))\r\n\r\nI didn't really feel like I had all that beef in me because of all the wonderful roughage served with the different dishes.

The first course was the beef salad was alright but failed to impress me . The second course beef carpaccio which was basically a beef fondue where you take the beef and wrap it in rice paper along with veggies to make your own spring rolls which you later dip in sauce . The beef carpaccio was pretty good ... the beef was very yummy . You can wrap the third , fourth , and fifth in rice paper if you wish to as well . The third course was the grilled beef lot leaf sausages which was alright . I forgot which course but there was one that was really good ... it was either the fourth course which was grilled beef lemongrass or the fifth course which was beef sausage . One of them is very good and the other is just alright . The sixth course which was beef meat balls weren't that great ... it crumbled easily and did not taste that great . The seventh course which was beef porridge tasted weird at first but ended up to be kinda good later on . I've never had the 7 course beef before so this was my first time . The name is kinda deceiving . I kinda expected more food because \" 7 course beef \" makes it sound like it would be a heavy meal but it's actually quite a light meal . I expected there to be more food ... I didn't expect 4 courses to be on one plate . Also , it does get a little annoying making your own food after a while . I would recommend trying the 7 course beef here if you haven't tried it before because it's definitely worth trying at least once . As for the food ... it was not bad but failed to impress me .

If you dine with 2 other people, you can just order 2 portions and the three of ya share.

I loved all 7 courses and it was a good group experience =) I've been there a bunch of times and almost always order the same thing. 7 courses of beef and Anh Hong egg rolls (which are already in the 7 courses...but they are just too good!) This is the only time I come to the TL! haha But, it's worth it. They DO get packed, so get there early. 5:30-6 is the ideal time to go....plus, you have a to look for parking. =)", "author": "Michelle C."}

Funny thing, I don't eat beef. But it was all OK because we ordered a plate of chicken and I just wrapped stuff with chicken instead and it was delicious. (the main purpose of the seven courses of beef is wrapping a bunch of vegetables and meat, amongh other things, in rice paper that you prepare at your table). I also sampled the soup, which only has a tiny bit of beef in it anyway and easy to avoid (or they dished me up less beef on purpose - either way, I barely remember beef in that). And I'm glad I did sample the soup because it was amazing, possibly my favorite part of the meal. The vegetables were *great* - tons of them, and totally fresh. My friends have been there a bunch of times, and apparently there are other great things on the menu. One of those places I don't think you can go wrong at.", "author": "Jen D."}

The waiter advised us to order more, but we told him we were not that hungry. Then the waiter went away for a couple of seconds and came back to tell us to order more. Again, we explained that we were not that hungry and we were fine with 2 orders of 7 course beef. My girlfriend came here before for 7 course beef and knows the portions. The waiter went away for a few minutes this time.  Then the waiter came back and insisted that we order more food. We left immediately.", "author": "Brad C."}

It's a no frills, get you in-and-out kind of place in the Tenderloin, but it's clean and the food has never disappointed me. Beef salad, sugarcane shrimp, and unlimited fresh herbs and greens to accompany your order. Almost as good as my grandma's food.", "author": "Aileen T."}

They refused to take two orders of 7-course beef because we were 6 of us and  three of us don't like beef.  So we I planned to order other food in the menu. They said we have to order at least 3 orders of 7-course beef otherwise they don't serve us!!!!!! We explained why we only want to order two of those because we want to order other dishes in the menue but they still insisted not to serve us if we don't order at least 3 orders of 7-course beef.  We swear we will not come back period. We were in disbelief and shock of how their disrespectful attitude- the tall waiter was so rude. We ask if we can have water because we didn't want any caffeine at night. He ignored us and never serve us water even when we ask the second time!!!! The food was bad and the price is over rated. I do not recommended to anyone if they want good service or good food.", "author": "Tai A."}

Good service overall- a great place to chill with friends- and they allow you to bring your own wine (not sure about corkage fee) Enjoy!!!!", "author": "Kaitlyn C."}

UM HELLO! I'M CHINESE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID ASSHOLE! AND DON'T MAKE COME IN THE KITCHEN AND CUSS YOU OUT IN CHINESE, ENGLISH, SPANISH AND VIETNAMESE!!!! but per my friend's request, i bit my tongue! we ended up ordering 2 orders of 7 courses since we were able to get her mom to join us who was right around the corner. halfway through the meal, the bowl of water for the rice wrappers had gotten cold so we asked for it to be refreshed as well as a refill on auntie's cup of hot water and our waters too! he came back with a refreshed bowl of hot water and that was it. we proceeded to wave someone down for the next 15 or 20 mins to get our water refilled. no luck. even though they was coming by to throw our food on the table, they acted like they didn't hear us about the water. FINALLY, she got someone's attention and asked him to refill CUP OF HOT WATER AND CUP OF COLD WATER! the waiter/owner came back with one hot water. so she asked again for her cold water. he let out a big sigh and came back with the called water and told her \"you tell me to come here too many times! you asked for hot water and then cold water and what else you need now?\" my friend calmly told him than \"no, i asked for refills on the hot and the cold water the first time YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME!\" then she told him in vietnamese that she's been asking for the water for 20 mins but everyone on staff had been ignoring our requests. \n\nauntie decided she wanted some porridge to go to, so we flagged someone down and got an order for her TO GO! the rude waiter/owner came with our bill and after reviewing it, my friend told him she ordered some porridge to go and it wasn't on the bill, so he took it back and fixed it. i thought that was nice of her cuz if it was me, after the service we got, i wouldn't have said shit! anyhow he came back the with the new bill and the porridge IN A BOWL!!! so my friend told him she ordered to go. he gave her dirty look WTF? she said \"i told him it was TO GO!\" asshole goes \"you tole him you not tole me!\" uh hello! shouldn't you and your staff be trained well enough to communicate with each other regarding customer orders! i shouldn't have to tell you how to do your job, you should already know how! should my friend have told everyone on the staff that she ordered porridge to go to make sure it was done right?! REALLYYY??!!!!!\n\nmy friend paid the bill, no tip, and she's a sweetheart and tips well, so for her to not leave a penny says a lot! and she made sure she wrote the above on the receipt too! we were just getting up to walk away when asshole came to pick up the bill. auntie said something to him in vietnamese. when we got outside i asked her what she had said to him, she said \"i tell him thank you for nothing!\" LOL\n\nnever coming back here, i don't expect asian restaurants to have good service, but i certainly don't expect to be treated that badly either! 7 courses great, but most of the courses are sausages anyway, so there's not that much variety and have to put it with that kind of service is not worth it! there are other places you can get 7 courses from that won't give you the stank eye!", "author": "Gaile C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-07-14", "description": "My girlfriend (who is from Vietnam ) and I went to the Anh Hong restaurant, San Francisco for dinner.The waiter directed us to a table in a corner next to a stack of children's chairs. The waiter didn't smile and said almost nothing about what was going on.  We noticed that there were paper placemats on top of the tablecloth.  My girlfriend moved the placemat to adjust her napkin etc. and found large food particles which were stuck to the tablecloth along with stains which were being covered up by the placemats. The fish oil or whatever kind of stain it was had come up through the placemats. We should've left when we discovered that.  However, we had seen this restaurant promoted on \"Check Please, Bay Area\". We decided to give it a chance.  We ordered our food which included appetizer, soup and main course.  Our food was brought all at once.  Not only that, the waiter leaned over my girlfriend while she was eating to get children's chairs and didn't say, excuse me or anything.  In fact he didn't say anything at all.  As he was serving us I accidentally grazed my bowl of soup with my chopsticks as I was moving them out of the way for him. I spilled a little soup and he didn't offer to help cleanup the spill.  In fact, he made a noise as if he was annoyed and said nothing. He finished serving us and walked away.  As our food became cold from sitting on the table before we could eat it, we realized that the raw vegetables weren't fresh and the greens/herbs were out of proportion to what we were eating. Our drinks were not refilled and our waiter did not return at all during the meal to ask us if everything was OK or anything. I went to the restroom to watch the fish oil off my hands and it was filthy.  Logic told me that if the table cloths and the bathroom were dirty, the kitchen must also be. We finally had to go up to the counter to pay for our meal because the waiter did not bring our check.  This was a very disappointing dining experience.", "author": "Jay F."}
