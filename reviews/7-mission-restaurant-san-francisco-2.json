I can order 2 plates and have plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day! \nThe restaurant itself is cozy - my husband and I will pop in occasionally to get away from the cramped apartment, or I'll stop by in between jobs for a fast and filling meal. The (male) host I've encountered is very kind and attentive. The Mongolian beef/beef with mushroom are my go-to's! Consistently flavorful. \nSome dishes are a little on the bland side, but nothing a dash of soy sauce won't fix! \nTheir crab rangoon filling is awesome with a garlicky touch.

I got Combo C Combo for $10.50 made of 2 egg rolls, fried shrimp, salad, BBQ beef and steamed rice.  I also ordered potstickers and thai iced tea.  Nothing disappointed me.  They were all hot to the touch, all fresh.  If you wanted hot, the combo had a mini spicy hot sauce cup along with the regular Vietnamese thin red vinegary sauce.  The hot sauce went well with the 2 big egg rolls(with bits of meat and full of noodles inside).  The 2 fried shrimp were well-battered.  The BBQ beef was small in portion but cooked ok.

Shrimp rolls\n\nThe pho broth was bland and tasteless. They didn't bring any of the fixins besides basil and bean sprouts, and the noodles weren't vermicelli-they were flat, wide rice noodles. Pho real?! The whole purpose of my order was for the pho.\n\nThe string green beans were also quite bland. I had to repurpose them to add more flavor. \n\nThe shrimp rolls had pork in it. This is not indicated on their menu, so when the delivery guy asked me if I was ok with eating pork, I said, \"no\" he took them away. I'm not sure why they wouldn't just call me prior to making or bringing the order to ensure I was ok with pork, if they are going to make the effort to ask when they show up (also twenty minutes late). I appreciate that the delivery guy told me though, instead of letting me find out on my own.\n\nI'm not much of a complainer, but when you're sick and you order something specific you want what you order to show up. I'm sure you can relate. At least the string green beans were decent after I added some spices etc to them.\n\nI was pretty disappointed with my overall experience with this restaurant and that I did not really receive what I ordered.", "author": "Shereen A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-08", "description": "I gotta say it's my favorite local hole-in-the-wall Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant! But you have to take it for what it is, stereotypes and all.\nI have tried: Combo Clay Pot ($9) MUST TRY, Combo Chow Fun, Combo Fried Rice, Hot and Sour Soup, Asparagus and Crab Soup. TBH any of their entries, noodles, rice, or clay pots are  winners. Avoid their soups or appetizers. I have not tried the pho yet but would caution against eating pho at a restaurant not dedicated to it. \n\n(1) Located on 7th and Mission-- there is literally no parking around in these SF streets. Also it's kind of a sketch area with odd characters. Stay safe!\n\n(2) Service is typically, nonexistent aka true badboy Asian style. It's family-owned and they're ALWAYS busy. Employees dress casually and are attentive however. But don't expect them to share the Specials of the Day or to engage you in friendly, caring conversation.\n\n(3) Food is on fleek-- homely, comforting, and tastes like chalkful of MSG/salt! I mean I downed my water so often but the chicken is always my fave protein FYI can't get enough of that dark meat mm. Beef is also chewy and probably velvetized/baking soda, but still tender.\n\n(4) Prices are reasonable ranging from $7 - $10. They have increased their prices to an additional dollar since last year though. \n\n(5) Delivery and Eat24 and Cards. They do delivery but always account for an hour and maybe longer during lunch rushes. They also take cards and don't have a minimum hallelujah.\n\nOverall, the quality makes me happy for a local mom 'n pop shop. It's more delicious and does not taste like Panda Express cardboard. But it's not high-end quality either and tbh sometimes the hole-in-the-walls make the best homely foods. Cheers to 7 Mission!", "author": "Donna T."}

I really want to give it \"4 stars\" but this place just falls short even for what it is.\n\nMy most disappointing moment came the other day when I ordered a usual favorite - the spareribs claypot. The spareribs had a strange unfresh taste to them that I really did not like - this is a dish I've ordered at least 5 times before. I really hope that this was an \"off day\".\n\nThe other dish I usually order is the pho, and I am also unsatisfied that the pho sometimes comes without jalapenos to spice up your soup.\n\nThe portions are generally huge, but the consistency is lacking. Sometimes dishes have come very salty, other times they're perfect. Sometimes things taste incredibly fresh - other days like my claypot it is so questionable if it was even safe to serve.\n\nThe problem with the slow service is largely fixed if you just walk up and pay. I have short lunches and I simply aggressively flag down a waitress, order, and when i'm done I flag them down right away or just walk straight to the guy behind the counter and pay - there's no reason to wait and nobody on the serving staff is going to be offended at this \"mom and pop\" hole in the wall.\n\nYour impression will improve also based on what you order. I recommend you stick to certain basic rice plates any Chinese place makes (mongolian beef, kung pao, etc), claypot dishes, and pho (in that order) if you want to leave happy. Ordering anything that doesn't get a lot of \"rotation\" is risky in my opinion, lol.", "author": "Doug R."}

The best Vietnamese chicken curry soup I've had so far is at Sunrise Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sunrise-cafe-san-francisco-2) on Bryant St.\n\n\n---- DRY DISHES ----\n\nBeef with Eggplant: 5 stars\nChicken with Eggplant: 5 stars\n\nChicken with Double Mushroom: 3 stars\nSauce has a weird artificial flavour.\n\nClaypot rice dishes: 4.5 stars\nDelicious and SO much food for what you're paying.\n\nFive Spice Chicken: 4.5 stars\n\nBBQ Pork with Imperial Rolls Vermicelli: 4.5 stars\nThe BBQ pork comes in thin strips reminiscent of bak kwa (Chinese BBQ pork jerky), but these imperial tolls are deep-fried, crunchy and packed full of good flavour.\n\nCrab Rangoon: 2 stars\nAll the crab here is imitation crab.\n\n---- DESSERT ----\n\nThree Colour Bean Dessert (Che): 3.5 stars\nThis is a layered drink similar to Filipino Halo-Halo or Singaporean chendol -- red beans topped with green (mung) beans topped with jellies in white coconut milk. Unfortunately, I grew up on coconut and bean desserts, so this does not meet my high bar. The green bean layer is delicious, but the jellies are too weak and disintegrate with no \"muscle\" in your mouth, and the texture of the liquid is gritty / chalky instead of the smooth coconut milk desserts I've had in Vietnam and Thailand. But if you're craving a Southeast Asian dessert then this might well suffice to scratch your itch.", "author": "Letitia L."}

I work about a block away and find this an easy option to satisfy my spring roll cravings which incidentally is what I order here almost every time. The spring rolls or \"salad spring rolls\" are unfortunately not that cheap or salads, but they're cheaper than any other meal I can grab in the area and just the right amount of food for a quick small lunch (for me at least). The dish (actually an appetizer) comes with 2 rolls that are cut in half each and filled with vermicelli noodles, assorted salad, shrimp, and some bbq pork (note: not vegetarian!). The rolls also come with a delicious peanut sauce that I like to add the chili sauce they put on the table. They're in no way life-changing spring rolls, but they seen fresh and hit the spot (and come on, this dish is pretty hard to mess up).\n\nI've also once tried their sesame chicken rice plate, which I do not plan on ever ordering again. The rice was bland and dry. The chicken itself was mostly fried batter and covered in a goopy yellow sauce that was extraordinarily sweet and otherwise flavorless. To be honest, this dish has pretty much discouraged me from trying any other plates. \n\nOverall this place was very mediocre. The restaurant itself felt cramped, dark, and uncomfortable which is why I have always ordered as pick-up. As a result, I cannot talk about the service. The sesame chicken rice plate was... worthy of a 1-2 star rating, but I keep coming back for their spring rolls so I guess I'll give them 3 stars.", "author": "Vivian L."}

Food dish on this planet is imperial egg roll vermicelli noodle bowl. This place got it the best that I've had so far. Details as follows for delivery:\n\nChicken Fried Rice (Instructions: white meat chicken only please and spicy please): this was interesting, it had the consistency of Japanese fried rice (fluffy, not a lot of oil and what oil used was peanut or a light veggie), it's was ok but there should have been some bigger flavors, there weren't, but I thought it was a pass. \n\nBBQ Pork and Egg Roll - Rice Noodle (or called imperial egg roll vermicelli noodle bowl): This place has the best noodles that I have ever had, now that might not seem like a lot, but to a noodle fiend like myself you can taste the difference. Theirs are fatter, thicker, and soak up sauce way better (plus they strain better so you don't have soo much water at the bottom). The BBQ pork was the most tender thing that I have ever ate, Mississippi smoked BBQ included. Honestly, my only beef with this is that the wrapping for the imperial rolls are not the glass wrapper dough (like they use for any salad roll). Easy way to tell this is if your eggroll is brown/tan it's normal wanton wrapper, it is a dirty white -- you got glass wrapper, which gets crispier. \n\nShrimp Salad Roll (2): IT HAS BBQ BEEF IN IT. They don't tell you that, I am. I liked it, my vegetarian GF did not (and it was her order), more food for me. The ravager wins again.  \n\nCorn and Crab Meat Soup: We both tried this and gonna have to pass, it's an egg drop soup with some imitation crab, and some veggies, stuff is in it, but not the most fantastic thing ever. But, then again, if you're a vegetarian you gotta be pretty much used to that now huh?\n\nEgg Rolls: Pork, carrot (nice addition), some dikon, with wan-ton wrapper. Good, and if you dip them in the vinegar chili sauce great addition.", "author": "Max X."}

But the family cooks with the type of down home earnestness rarely found nowadays. The food is not Michelin Star worthy, of course. But their prices are absolutely excellent (most menu items are under $7 FOR very generous portions), especially in comparison to some of the restaurants in Chinatown where the average dish is smaller but is priced at more than double, sometimes even quadruple the price of 7 Mission's dishes.\n\nThe place is not in the best part of town for sure.

I'm not sure it worth trying anything else.  I always get the veggie one and ask that they keep it in the oven a little longer to make the rice nice and crispy on the bottom (maybe it's a Persian thing and if you are Persian or know a Persian, you'll know what I'm talking about).  It's usually busy, both at the restaurant and the phone going off - these are all good signs when there are so many choices in SF.  The only warning is, sometimes a really crazy person might walk in (rare but I go enough that it's happened twice since I've dined there).  They have never been rude or disrespectful to the person but try to handle it the best they can.  Usually they leave without weirdness and I appreciate that.\n\nAgain, CLAYPOT.", "author": "Zin M."}

Although it's not 100% clay pot rice, I still liked it.  \n\nWe paid $7/pop for rice in a clay pot with your choice of toppings.  mine came with chinese sausage, chicken, and mushrooms.  Now in a normal chinese place, it would take up to 30-45 minutes for clay pot rice, so you can imagine my shock when it came out in 10 minutes! My theory is that they took rice, fried it, topped it, then put it in a clay pot and put it in the oven.  i can tell it was in the oven cause there was some rice sticking to the bottom of the clay pot and it was sizzling when it came out.\n\nMy other clay pot mates said it was good, and cheap, but not legit.\n\nI would definitely go back.  not for tube steak though. just for the clay pot rice", "author": "Ray R."}

I can't tell if the resto is more Chinese or Vietnamese as they serve both but their food is decent.\n\nSo far, I've had their Won Ton Soup w/Noodles, which was good but it didn't have pieces of chicken or pork like others spots serve it up but, it fixed my craving, not sure I'd order it again though.  I've also had their Salt & Pepper Pork Chop Rice plate.  For some reason at the time, it was served to me warm, borderline cold but the steamed rice was piping hot.  There was a good, lunch sized portion of pork chop, which was tasty, could've used a little more pepper and jalapeno but, that's just me.  Their Mongolian Beef Rice plate was decent, my only complaint, which is common for most every Chinese resto I've been to is that they load it up with veggies, the red peppers, green peppers, green onions, onions and just a few pieces of beef.  By the time I was done, all those veggies were what was left on the plate.\n\nThey serve you hot tea automatically but sometimes you have to ask for it.  I've ordered their Vietnamese Iced Coffee twice which was a nice treat to end my meal, not to mention, to keep me awake for the rest of the day.\n\nService, just like the tea, is hit or miss, but overall has been friendly.  The resto itself is seriously a hole in the wall, it's not somewhere you'd go with a group or celebrate a special ocassion, it's seriously just to eat and run.\n\nOverall, it's not the greatest Chinese/Vietnamese food out there but, it's a nice spot if your craving rice in this neighborhood.", "author": "Nick D."}

When you get delivery and they say it'll be there in 30 to 35 minutes, it actually arrives in about 35 minutes. In all honestly of ALL the places I've every ordered from in SF this is the only place that actually delivers in 1. under an hour and 2. delivers with in the time specified. The other week we ordered from a Chinese place less than a mile away (yes we were that lazy) and it was an hour and a half to get our food.\n\nSo yep this place gets bumped up one star for that.

With the crazy economy and some of my regular SOMA lunch spots disappearing by the week I've been frequenting different places to add to my lunch rotation.\n\nSo I've eaten here twice in the same week mainly because they've received some fairly positive Yelp reviews, and if just based on my two visits I don't think this restaurant makes anything that is super special, but they do make some basic Chinese and Vietnamese selections quite adequately with good flavor, good portions, very good service and very minimal MSG.\n\nI went the Chinese route on my first visit with an order of potstickers (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/9Jm1NnEVGg4_ivoKN0Bq4g/l) and a beef chow mein (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/CldM-w2MV-hFiYVOrxFmRg/l).  The potstickers had a very thin skin much like Japanese gyoza and were crispy on the edges.  The predominantly pork filling wasn't quite moist enough and was a bit oversalted.  The vinegar and soy dip definitely helped in masking some of that salty flavor.  I liked the chow mein more as the beef was only slightly tenderized and there was plenty of fat chow mein noodles.  I'm not a big fan of the thin, crispy Hong Kong style egg noodles so these fatter flour noodles were definitely preferred.  They keep the fillers such as onions, bean sprouts and shredded cabbage to a minimum so there was quite a bit of beef and noodles in the dish.\n\nFor my second visit I decided to try some of the Vietnamese offerings with an order of the deep fried vegetarian imperial rolls (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/t9nE6RWt7_BS4MfgXEGfww/l) and a vermicelli bowl [a.k.a. bun] with grilled pork (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/BKm8IHGphKxaXFbjXlyo1A/l).  The imperial rolls were quite good with its filling made up of silver noodle thread, shredded carrot and cabbage.  The rolls were fried up to the point where the cabbage was actually creamy.  They left out quite a number of ingredients from traditional bun dishes.  There are no bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro or fresh basil in 7 Mission's version.  The bottom layer is simply shredded iceberg lettuce.  The portion of cold vermicelli noodles was quite generous though and the grilled pork while sliced bacon thin was very flavorful.  Finely minced peanuts and sweet pickled carrot finished up the dish.\n\nThe service is very friendly, and while the food doesn't come out of the kitchen lightning fast the wait is quite short.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

With a mix of Chinese and Vietnamese dishes all for under $10, there really isn't much to complain about this place. Only waiting a mere 5 minutes for the food to come out, I was utterly surprised. Clean, cheap, & quick - that's all I ask for when I'm in dire need of food.\n\nOrdered the sweet and sour fish + rice dish minus the veggies (because all I really wanted was the fish) for only $6.50. The portion was large enough to fill up 2 people, and even though the flavor was nothing spectacular, it's definitely a bang for your buck. A tad overloaded with batter, the fish was only mediocre, but I was stuffed after just a few bites. They also offer combo dishes for about $7-8, which includes eggrolls, meat, and rice. Pretty good deal, if you asked me.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's a nice spot to check out if you're in the SoMa area and you don't want to throw down a lot of bills on dinner.", "author": "Michelle W."}

I was a bit surprised when the spring rolls came out with fish sauce (?) rather than the peanut sauce I'm used to. Then I looked at the spring rolls and I remembered that the rolls with the shrimp aren't considered vegetarian. Maybe fish sauce is usually served with vegetarian spring rolls? Oh well. They were still good, and so were the imperial rolls. Although the wrapper too, looked different to me - not as translucent as I'm used to. Eh, what do I know?\n\nBut I do know that my pho was a bit flavorless. I wonder if this is what people are talking about when they say \"no MSG, no flavor?\" I'm not sure if they use MSG here or not (no signs around indicating that they don't) but there was something off about the broth. The two baby pieces of shrimp, several fish cake and fish ball pieces, and imitation crab were so few and hiding beneath the noodles, I had to search for them to make sure this was the seafood soup I ordered. \n\nSince I did appreciate the great service, large glass of hot tea, and cheap prices, I would come back here.

And most respectable of all, the owner works on-site, in and out making deliveries, and when staff if preoccupied, you'll see him taking orders or refilling the tea. The ambiance is clear of ostentation: red and gold scrolls tacked to the walls; photographs of the food with handwritten descriptions lined against the booths; a glass case of soda; a refrigerator of the beer selection. A flat screen television hangs over the place, and plays small town football games, or at times home video gag shows. Without all the means, or cause, for arrogance, one might argue that it's not really the best they've had of Vietnamese cuisine. What the hell-- we've all had better of something somewhere, haven't we? But if I ever took the time to (learn how to) cook, I'd be very proud to be able to make anything on their menu. Yes, I've had better pho (Beef Noodle Soup) somewhere else, and I rarely order it anymore. But only because I've exhausted their recipe. Aside from what is traditional, they've also got some (of what I can make out as) inventions of their own: the Beef Stew Noodle is a sort of variation of the American, an interesting fusion. The Clay Pot Combo, as well as the rice plates, does not boast much, but are honest and satisfactory. (The Five Spices Roasted Chicken needs setting aside as some of the best I've had in the city, second only to that of Sunflower in the Mission) And for the price of it all, how dare anyone ask for any more? If you want to treat yourself, go somewhere else, armed with a considerably heftier wallet, and your peacock's pride. If you want to treat yourself to the satisfaction of your own modest means in the kitchen after a long day at work and save yourself the fuss or preparation and dirty dishes, this is the place to be.", "author": "Rho-p O."}

To be fair, the rice and vermicelli dishes looked fine, though the \"lunch special\" just seemed overpriced.\n\nAnyways, I am somewhat of a pho snob. After having pho in Australia, it'd be hard to give any pho place in the US five stars due to the quality of noodles used here.\n\nSo, here goes:\nsmall sized bowl -- deduction\nfresh sprouts -- good\nfresh lemon wedge -- good\nfresh mint -- good\nmissing jalapeno peppers -- deduction\nbeef balls -- good (the tasty ones)\nsliced beef -- not raw on top, deduction\nmissing tripe, tendons, etc -- big deduction\nbroth taste -- average, can't tell if there's MSG or not, so that's a good thing, but it didn't reek of beef flavor\nbroth temperature -- hot, good\nnoodles -- standard fare and loosened, good\n\nBased on the pho only, I would not ever go back.

Also since its a veitnamese/ chinese combo, I was hoping the pho would be good, no such luck.. i mean its not inedible but it isnt the flavor fiesta i expected, plus they use lemon instead of lime, whats up with that?

Even so 7 mission is a great spot of a filling fast lunch. They always have fast service, good food and prices easy on the wallet. 7 mission is my favorite place to eat in SOMA.
