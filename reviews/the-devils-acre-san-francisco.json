The door man (young African American man) was very nice for a door man (more like what you'd expect from a restaurant host), and even though he carded two people in our 40s, you can't fault a guy for doing his job! SF's alcohol enforcement unit ain't getting nothing past this guy, haha. He even thanked us for coming in when we left, which again, is more friendly than door people I'm used to on the East coast. Both he and the bartender were friendlier than the employees in Vesuvio Cafe, which is why we quickly left that place and were looking for somewhere else to hang.\n\nThe bartender (young white male, brown hair) was totally friendly and helpful with our drink selections. \n\nThe jazz quartet all had great chops. The drummer had to be in his 70s or 80s, but he was a real pro and delight to watch, and the guitarist later told us he was a legend on the local jazz scene.  [Side rant: I hope the young, techy residents of SF appreciate what they have in their jazz musicians - it's a dying art, notoriously underpaid, and the men and women keeping it going are both more cool and talented than you'll ever be. Don't buy the latest Google glass or whatever; support your local musicians, ya dopes.]\n\nThe decor was outstanding. I want that wallpaper.", "author": "Haltone H."}

(There were only two people sitting at the bar and two at a table when we walked in.)\nOur reservation was for 5 pm.  Dinner was at 6pm around the corner.\nConfused, I walked up to the bar thinking maybe they weren't open yet. (They opened at 3pm)\nI told the barkeep we had a reservation and asked where we should sit.\nI thought maybe they had a designated area for larger groups.\nHe didn't even look up and gestured with his hand to sit anywhere you wanted.\nWe sat at a table that could accommodate six people and waited for a server.  I was told the last time that there was a server for people at tables.\nAfter 10 minutes, I went back to the bar and ordered drinks from the same barkeep.  He told me that the server starts at 5pm.  A server \nnever showed up and we were there until 6pm.  He could have cared less.  \nHeavy drapes were partially closed at the windows to keep the bright sunlight from coming in where the tables are located.\nThe only other guy working there (barback?) decided to fling them open which caused us and other people to move to different tables because it was so uncomfortably bright and warm.  We asked him to partially close them a bit to get the sun out of our eyes and he said, \"No\" and walked away.\nAgain, this one too could have cared less.  \nIf you live in SF, you have likely experienced this attitude that seems to permeate the service industry here.

The bartenders look very cutting edge--they all have the requisite shaved head, full beard, and extensive tats.  They also know their craft.  I've been to plenty of big-city speakeasies and these guys compare pretty favorably in terms of pure mixology.  Their custom cocktails are imaginative and the ones we had were all delicious, though they ran the gamut from light to 'spiritous' and  the server was very precise in describing them to us in detail.  \n\nThe only place they messed up is that we had a bigger party so we called for a reservation.  When we got there, the only person visible in the bar was the bartender, who didn't know about the reservation, and every table had a sign that said \"reserved\" on it, so we didn't know where to sit.  The bartender didn't know either, so we commandeered a few tables and pulled them together.  When the server showed up she said it wasn't where they wanted to put us but they weren't going to move us either.  \n\nNot a big deal, nobody died or went to prison, but not quite the 5-star performance.  I'd definitely recommend it though.  A nice place with a good vibe and great drinks.", "author": "George R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "Located in the hustle and bustle area of Columbus and Broadway, Devil's Acre has been blessed to be setup in a surprisingly large space. They take reservations and a table for you and your group shouldn't be too challenging to secure even without one on most evenings. Although there is plenty of shoulder room between tables, you're going to have to fight to be heard over other potentially louder tables.\n\nAs for their drink menu it looks and tastes splendid(based on two visits thus far). If you're a fan of bourbon, I recommend you try Three Sworn Enemies(bourbon, vanilla syrup, angostura & orange bitters, gold dust). \n\nPrices are quite reasonable, and between the large space and quality of libations, I can comfortably recommend this joint if you're in the North Beach area looking to wet your whistle.", "author": "Dennis W."}

For the 3rd time this week and it's only Wednesday. \n\nYou trip on that last flight of stairs, spilling your $10 Blue Jamaican Philz coffee on your favorite shirt. \n\nYour mom calls you and leaves you a voicemail saying: \"surprise! I'm in town and I'm at your apartment getting to know your new gf!\" \n\n* Is this day over yet? * \n\nEveryone has bad days but the Devil has obviously picked you to be his guinea pig today. No worries, everything is cured with cocktails at the Devil's Acre.\n\nThe space is impressive and is layered with that old Barbary coast feeling: from the apothecary look of the menus, the massive wooden bar shelf, vintage decor and private space for parties at basement level. I dig it.\n\nFrom the extensive amount of choices (you can even order sodas and phosphates like the good ol' days!) more than a few stand out. The Devil's Manhattan made with rye, sweet vermouth, bitters and a splash of champagne is supreme. It's everything you'd expect in a classic cocktail like this: it takes the flavor of whiskey and lets it shine, with an extra fun element of bubbly. You'll also love the pearl topped stirrer that is served with your Luxardo cherries.\n\nThe Bijou is what they call on the menu -- a period specific cocktail from the 1900. It has gin, sweet vermouth, green & yellow chartreuse and orange bitters. Its crisp, herbaceous qualities make for a fine drink on a cold winter night.\n\nFor Barbary Coast history buffs and cocktail fans, The Lauchlan's Antiscorbutic is a stiff cocktail that's sure to cure what ails you. In 1867, Lauchlan Rose patented a method where in he discovered that sulfur salts acted as a preservative agent for perishable juices. Rose's Lime juice cordial was born and you get plenty of lime flavor in this drink, along with vitamin C to cure scurvy. I mean, nowadays, if you had scurvy you would go to the hospital, but probably helps to pre-game with this cocktail before hand ;-) I'd probably choose the Paramour over anything else at this bar since it has Campari and the pretty pink color makes me happy every time I order it here. \n\nThe Devil's Acre is suitable for date nights, small group gatherings or even post dinner meet-ups in North Beach when you don't want to burn money and go to the nearby Strip Clubs. Plus, in this town where people with disposable income have a Devil may care attitude in spending cashola, I appreciate the fact that the cocktails are still an affordable $10 each. To that I say, hallelujah!", "author": "Janice C."}

There's a single person bathroom upstairs and me and two girlfriends went in together. Girls go to the bathroom together all the time, it's harmless. Well, while my friend was on the toilet, security comes banging on the door screaming for us to open the door. He was yelling pretty aggressively, we thought something bad must've been going on. He forced us to open the door while my friend was exposed and mid pee, and made two of us leave the bathroom because it was 'a single use bathroom.' Not okay!! \n\nUnbelievable.

So much thought and creativity was put into it. They listed the original creator and year a drink was created, and many popular choices similar to old fashioned drinks or gin, juniper and fruits were created in the 1800's. I noticed some of the drinks had over 10 ingredients! \n\nI'm kind of a whiskey on the rocks type of girl, but man. Whether you like strong or girly cocktails, just get any cocktail. It's a waste to get whiskey on the rocks here.\n\nService, however, falls a bit short (hence my giving 4 stars instead of 5). Our cute waitress with short black hair, bangs and black glasses (who seemed super not enthused to be there) seemed to really dislike patrons asking for drink suggestions and possibly has never smiled in her entire life.\n\nMy fiance figured this bar would be like the other craft cocktail/speakeasy type bars where bartenders are eager to surprise us with a nice, strong drink based off the tasting notes we like. I guess that was our mistake. I don't think this is that type of bar lol. \n\nHe asked that the mixologist make whatever they thought would fit him best - something strong and bourbon/whiskey based, kind of like an old fashioned but with their own twist. They gave him a watered down old fashioned...\n\nLucky for me, I ordered Three Sworn Enemies based off other Yelp reviews. It had Evan Williams bottled in-bond bourbon, grand poppy, vanilla syrup, angostura and orange bitters, along with a few pinches and spritzes of other things. Last but not least, there was GOLD DUST! I sparkly and high just looking at it. Not a single ingredient was overpowering. They all complemented the other flavors in the drink, including my bourbon.\n\nIn a bar that's so passionate about their craft drinks, I feel that all staff members should be friendly, welcoming and helpful in choosing one of their many unique drinks. The vast majority of all craft cocktail bars we've visited have very upbeat, knowledgeable and helpful staff. \n\nRating breakdown:\n\nDrinks - 4.5/5  \nService - 3.5/5\nAmbience - 4/5 (it can get really crowded and loud, but still pretty cute place)", "author": "Ivy C."}

I was really excited to try this bar so let me explain the 3 stars. I probably would have given it at least four if the service was better. \n\nWhen we walked in it looked like there was only one bartender working, though the bar had a decent amount of people at it. We chose a table and studied the menu for a bit. We figured there was no table service but the bartender came over to us and immediately said \"I need to see your ID's\". No hello first or anything. So right there the service was pretty annoying. We were told we'd have to go to the bar to ordered (which we figured) so after deciding my friend and I went up to the bar to order. At this point the bartender was very friendly and let me even try the sherry before ordering the Sherry Cobbler. The drink was SO good. The amount of effort that went into making it was great. It was beautiful and delicious. My friends gin drink was also good and my husbands Three Sworn Enemies was not only beautiful it smelled and tasted amazing. \n\nAfter we finished those drinks my husband went back up to the bar to see if they would make him a Penicillin to which the bartender stated \"NO\". He felt like she was pretty rude and thought the customer service was terrible. He came back with 2 beers and was pretty disappointed. Also, by this time the bar was getting more and more crowded and still they only had one bartender. We didn't see another bartender come until almost 5:00. So, that woman was behind the bar for two hours serving everyone herself. I think she was overwhelmed and understaffed which is too bad because while the drinks were amazing and wonderfully crafted the service was lacking. When you're paying $10+ for a drink you hope the person making it is friendly. \n\nThe service didn't completely ruin the experience by any means though and I would definitely come back in the future.

But when we were sort of edging into the seating area, the guy at the door got our attention and let us know we should wait for a seat--kindly.\n\nThe hostess was super friendly when she came over--it looked like she was handling the entire floor on her own so the delay was totally understandable. And the service was also really quick once we'd been seated. My husband ordered a beer with a name he couldn't pronounce (it was a lager, and it was very different, and he really liked it).\n\nI ordered the Three Sworn Enemies, which was AMAZING. It smelled like fresh oranges and vanilla, tasted like excellent bourbon, and had gold shimmer in it. The glassware is gorgeous, if you're into that sort of thing.

Or I may be covered in cat fur searching for something decent to watch on Netflix. Who knows? \n\nNorth Beach on a Saturday or any day of the week is now vastly improved with the newly opened Devil's Acre, the newest and shiniest watering hole from the Future Bars crew. Like everything they do, this place is a real stunner. Gorgeous and imposing carved bar, amazing sconces and chandeliers, and grand windows facing Columbus. Like all of their bars, the light is low and the attention to detail is fine.\n\nYou can peruse the many pages of the Devil's Acre 'almanac' to pick your poison. The Barbary Coast Originals section and the Period Specific Classics were my go to categories, but there are some period appropriate non-alcoholic tonics at the back of the menu including an Ammonia Coke with aromatic spirits of ammonia. Say what? So much to learn. The Golden Era, a perfectly perky refreshment of gin, applejack and dry vermouth with orchard syrup (don't know what it is but I like it) was my favorite of the evening, but my sweetie's Paramour, a gin, Campari and chartreuse offering was a treat too. Our friend even had gold dust in her cocktail called Three Sworn Enemies, a bitter bourbon drink apparently fortified by little flecks of gold. \n\nWhile all of these elements would lend themselves well to an intimate speakeasy, the Devil's Acre was oppressively loud. Granted it was a Saturday and it is North Beach, and password protecting your bar is like so three years ago, but I was expecting something a bit more low key and less noisy. We came to catch up with friends but ended up having to do most of it later after leaving. But, reserved seats through Seat Me allowed us to have our own table of four at a prime time, and for that I was grateful.

When my group of friends arrived, we went down the street to Comstock Saloon where we had tasty drinks (far too many!) and food and were treated with humor and grace.\n\nI don't know what the door man's deal was, but the shoe thing was ridiculous. More likely he just didn't like the look of me. Perhaps I hadn't dressed feminine enough? It's a reminder of what being on the receiving end of discrimination feels like, though also a reminder that I have the luxury of avoiding it by changing my appearance if I want to. I hope others aren't getting the same treatment for things they can't as easily change.", "author": "Andrea F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-25", "description": "The Devil's Acre is another excellent creation from the Future Bars team; this particular one goes with a Barbery Coast theme. The venue has a very large upstairs with a bar and plenty of reserved table seating. Unlike Bourbon & Branch, it's fairly easy to get weekend table reservations for various group sizes even for the same day. (There is also a downstairs bar area, but I have yet to try that one out yet.)\n\nThe attention to detail in all the aspects of the bar is so remarkable! The (lengthy) drink menu is designed as a period-specific almanac and even has period-specific advertisements in it. The drinks are served with cloth napkins. The skewers used for drinks with fruit toppings have pearls on them. Oh, and the table lanterns are fully functional with a knob to adjust the flame height. I think we had a little too much fun with the lanterns on our first visit and earned a warning from our server...oops!\n\nThe drinks themselves are quite amazing. I'm still working my way through the menu, but some of my favorites are the Bourbon Crusta, Call a Treuse and Three Sworn Enemies. You must try Three Sworn Enemies, which is made with gold dust, for an additional visual treat!\n\nOne tip: as the wait for drinks can take a while, plan ahead and order your next drink before you're done with your current one. That said, the wait has never been excessive on any of my trips here and the quality of the drinks makes it well worth the extra time.\n\nSimply put, this is one of my favorite places in the Bay Area to grab a drink with friends.", "author": "Rodney G."}

Another solid cocktail bar by the B&B team, though I personally like most of the other bars better.\n\nI had the Three Sworn Enemies, with bourbon, Grand Poppy, vanilla, angostura, and gold dust.  I was stunned when the drink came out - it was liquid shimmery gold, and literally looked like a teeny bopper Bath & Body Works product.  When I finally mustered the courage to take a sip, I couldn't pinpoint any flavors in particular so I'm guessing the Grand Poppy was the dominant flavor.  It was definitely interesting, and visually unlike any drink I've ever had, so I'm glad I got it.  That said, I've had more spectacular drinks at B&B, Tradition, W&W...  \n\nI do want to mention the \"remedies\" that you can add to either your cocktail, soda, or water for $2. My friend added the digestive remedy to the devils manhattan so they stirred up the manhattan, then added a few drops of the remedy tableside.  I wish we had been able to try the drink with and without the remedy, though I'm sure it elevated the drink.  I was initially hesitant about champagne in a manhattan but it was just a splash - just enough to impart a grape-y brightness without being classified as bubbly.  Overall I enjoyed my friend's drink better than mine.  My only worry with the remedies though, is that while the concept is cool, it relies on the customer to know what flavors pair well together and also runs the risk of making an overly complex drink muddled in flavor.\n\nThe drinks are $11-12, but then they tack on tax and healthy SF which is kind of annoying.

In fitting with the apothecary theme, all cocktails are presented as \"remedies\" on the menu. Very fun and inventive. Collectively, the five of us ordered about 15 drinks total (it's a miracle we didn't black out). But anyway, those definitely worthy of a mention were the The Golden Age, Pisco Punch, Bourbon Crusta, and Three Sworn Enemies. All were well-executed and well-balanced. I was particularly taken with the Three Sworn Enemies, not only because I'm a complete sucker for old fashions, but there's actual edible gold dust in the drink. Gold, son!! Complete novetly, I know, but c'mon who doesn't love shiny things? \n\nTo cap off the evening, I went off menu asked for a spicy gin-based cocktail. SO GLAD I DID.

While, speakeasies were during the 1920's-early 1930's, the Barbary coast was from 1860's-early 1900's.  \n\nThey have 2 seating areas:  The main one on the ground level, and a smaller one downstairs.  You will need reservations for the ground level seating area, but the downstairs is open seating.  There is also a bar on both floors.  \n\nI started with the burbon crusta, which had burbon, lemon, orchard syrup, orange curacao, maraschino, and banker's bitters.  This was quite a refreshing and delicious drink.  The cost was $10.  Side note: The recipe for this cocktail also came on all the coasters.  I also shared the sherry cobbler (sherry, lemon-lime syrup, pebble ice, fruit and mint), again another $10 drink.  This one took a few sips to get use to (could be because burbon was the last thing on my palate), but then it became really really good!\n\nThe service was great.  Quick to your table, and had some great suggestions.  She even helped to spruce up my burbon crusta cocktail halfway through by adding some Love Potion to it, to help change the flavor of it.  \n\nWhen we went the soda machine was still being installed, so couldn't try some of their elixirs/sodas.  But I do want to go back and try them.  You can use them to create your own cocktail.  Choose an elixir and then a liquor.

The place is dark and classy, a little loud, but you can still hear the playlist - other patrons even started singing along when Tiny Dancer came on.  \n\nThe menu was so cool!  Its a rather wide book (compared to a typical one-pager), and even had ads for other bars in the area.  My friend and I enjoyed reading the horoscopes in the menu as well.  \n\nThe drinks came out and were very tasty, but again, I was most impressed with the finishing touches.  I had a cocktail up, and my friend had one with pebble ice - only she got a coaster.  Also, there was a pearl at the end of the toothpick holding fruit in her glass!\n\nWe only stayed for one drink, but this is certainly one place I will come back to - maybe when Tosca is too crowded?", "author": "Beth V."}

Came here last friday around 11. No line or wait, but once we got inside, we saw it was PACKED. Luckily, I had a clear path to the bar and was quickly addressed by the lady bartender (sorry, I don't remember your name!). Me being me, I chose the drink that had bourbon and GOLD DUST-- \"Three Sworn Enemies\". I was kinda disappointed when I got the drink and I didn't see any gold dust.. but second time around from the downstairs bar, there was plenty of gold shimmering in my glass :) I got another drink that night too but can't recall.... I just know everything I sipped on that night was tasty, not watered-down, and cheap!\n\nAnyway, the upstairs is good for groups (big groups--make a reservation) because it's more lively and loud. However, if you sneak down the stairs to the side of the bar, you'll find a much quieter chill vibe. Better for one-on-one time, they were playing some old school music that night. There's a small bar, a few small tables (open seating) and maybe 10? stools along the walls.\n\nP.S. I was told I totally messed up by not trying any of their sodas.

Our waitress upstairs was a little ignorant and took forever to take our order. But when she did, she was helpful in getting me a drink that I needed customized. Over a time span of 2-2.5 hours we tried the Bourbon Crusta, St. Croix Fix, the Dealers Choice (customized ) and Cruzan rum with Coke.

When we told him he said it was closed at 12, he came up with \"everyone has to be out by 1145.\" A contradiction of what he said earlier...\n\nWith that he watched us from less than three feet Away finish our drink.

Except that I prefer Devil's Acre to Bourbon branch for the following reasons: \n\n+ So much more space! Seriously, you can bring a date (make a reservation for one of those cute tables) or a group of friends (hang out downstairs in the smaller bar area or upstairs near the bar which has tons of standing room as well) and either way, you'll be pleased.\n+ Amazing and large variety in drinks! The menu itself is long (but also really interesting, the art and design of it itself took a few minutes to take in) so be sure to try a bunch of different options if you're in a group and as always, the bartenders are extremely helpful in choosing drinks! The handcrafted cocktails get even cooler with the apothecary theme - watching your bartender make your drink is a treat in itself. \n\nAnd with both these benefits, you STILL get delicious drinks! I tried the Golden Era, which was an interesting gin based drink with applejack, plus rye, bitters etc. I loved the sweet & sour flavors and for $10, I thought it was a pretty good price for a bar by the same owners of B&B!  \n\nVerdict: Worth a visit if you're in North Beach. Not as crazy crowded as B&B / other cool bars and you still get delicious drinks! \n\nTips: \n+if it's too crowded upstairs, take your group downstairs where you'll find another room you can all mingle in (plus tables, so be on the lookout to snag one) \n+if you like gin, get the golden era! \n+definitely make a reservation if you want to sit with your date/friend because there are tons of small tables but only available by reservation", "author": "Anu P."}

I tried their take on a cream soda and root beer. Neither were syrupy or overly sweet, and both had a nice amount of herbal flavor. The rest of my group was more fun and tried some of their bourbon and gin based cocktails. We were most impressed with the Three Sworn Enemies (it had gold dust in it!) and Golden Era, which was an interesting mix of gin and applejack, along with some other ingredients. The Devil's Manhattan also got good reviews.\n\nService was friendly, though it did take awhile to get drinks on a Friday night. I recommend everyone ordering at once, as it takes a long time to make cocktails like these (a few of us finished a drink before the others have even ordered).

We used the downstairs space for a private party and the rudeness of the manager on duty and lack of professionalism from the staff in general was appalling. The night started off by the manager rudely dismissing us when we arrived as he claimed we were early. After some discussion with my girlfriend, who had rented the place for her birthday, it was clear that there Devil's Acre had miscommunicated the arrival time. Instead of owning up to their mistake like anyone who knows the slightest thing about the hospitality and service business would do, the manager made the situation extremely uncomfortable by fetching the contract the terms and sticking it in my girlfriend's face claiming they had not agreed to open the doors until 9pm. Way to treat a paying guest that's bringing you four figure business on her birthday--bravo! The horrendous behavior of the service personnel did not stop there, unfortunately. The music they played sounded like some dystopian horror movie orchestra from the 60's that they didn't change until an hour into the party, the bar tender never informed the guests that a 20% gratuity was already included on the bar minimum--thereby greedily collecting extra tips from unknowing guests--and to top it all off, they sent everyone out and closed off the place more than an hour before pouring ends. Guests who were forced to end the party early ventured upstairs (if they hadn't left for home in disappointment) where Devil's Acre didn't let their business count against the bar minimum!

I arrived to meet friends after 10 pm last night and the place was jamming. I was hoping the reason to make reservations was to alleviate and avoid situations of having a stuffed bar.  Much like the vibe Bourbon and Branch has.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case and the place was popping at the seams (at least around the bars) There were an inordinate amount of impatient customers last night and the temperature of the venue didn't help that at all. The whole point of a speakeasy (at least I thought) was that it would be easy to speak but it was not. It was difficult to hold a conversation. After a round of fighting for drinks and trying to chat we gave up our table and left. \n\nI can't totally bash the place as it's still in it's infancy. The theme and the space is still one I adore. I just hope that in the upcoming weeks they can manage the reservation system to benefit the guests or do away with it and simply become a bar not trying to be a speakeasy. The positives were when you finally get to a bartender they are amazing to deal with and are charming and witty as hell. Sadly the population they allow through the doors hampers the whole experience. I plan to return in a couple months to see if the growing pains subside.", "author": "Joco F."}

The majority of the group came straight from the Houdini Escape room, pumped from the excitement of the task but also  absolutely sober, and arrived at the bar around 10:30ish. The place was pretty mellow and it took a little while to get the drinks situation sorted (multiple waiters, all wanting to have credit cards etc) but when the first drinks arrived they were amazing if a bit pricy. So far, so good. \nMore friends came and went but the group never was bigger than maybe 15 people, chatting away on the far end of the room. At about 1am it became interesting, the waiter just came around for the last order of drinks and a few people went outside for a smoke, including the birthday boy. \nFor whatever reason the bouncer decided not to let the party back in even though the jackets, wallets etc were insight. When we tried to communicate with the folks outside another bouncer came to our table to ask us to leave immediately even though they just brought the last round of drinks (it was about 1:10am at that time). When asking 'why' the bouncer got rather rude and tried to push people. \nWe gathered our belongings and made our way out of the bar. One of our friends tried to reason with the bouncer and his colleague to at least let us finish the drinks (please picture, he was standing with is hand behind his back, non-threading and trying to have a conversation) but he didn't want to hear of it. \nI took my full glass and went to the bar to ask for a refund, which I actually received after some grumbling. While at the bar I overheard one of the barmaids (I assume the manager) on the phone to the police explaining that my friend who was having the conversation with the bouncer is violent and needs to be removed. I first thought I got this wrong but she described his appearance quite detailed. I cannot believe that behavior. I have never been treated like that and I don't think I will ever come back to that place.

Had the Bourbon Crusta which was amazing and my wife had a Mezcal drink which she loved.  Speaking of Mezcal, Eric (the bartender who looks Irish but isn't) is your go to guy for Mezcal. He is a super dude. Has his own company in Oaxaca called Puro Burro.  Over two cocktails, in which he poured us tastings of at least 4 different Mezcals, he taught us a ton about the Agave plant (not the Agave cactus=Tequilla). The other bartenders are super chill and all very knowledgeable. They just got their music license and plan to have live music in the near future.

The first time we stopped by on our way out of town after a long day drinking bar hopping adventure and it just wasn't the same as when I could examine the wide variety of drinks and learn about them from the knowledgeable staff.  We each ordered a different drink and sampled them all.  Surprisingly I liked three of the four and only didn't like the fourth because I'm not a fan of bourbon but it was beautiful and sparkly (Three Sworn Enemies: Cyrus noble bourbon, grand poppy, vanilla syrup, angostura and orange bitters, gold dust).  I don't like a sweet drink which is why I ordered Lauchlans Antiscorbutic which was a mix of three gins and lime but the Pisco Punch was also tasty and it wasn't too sweet.  The strangest one was Dr. Crawfords Pick Me Up which had caffeine, rootbeer flavor and a spritz of smelling salts.  I'm ordering this next time if I need a bump.

We ordered two drinks at $23.00 and was given our bill since they were closing. 10 mins later no drinks but got a 10 min warning from the referee (aka bouncer). 5 mins later we eventually got our drinks. We asked the bartender if we had time to drink our drinks or if we had to chug them. She hesitated but said yes. Not 5 mins later the referee came to tell us that we had to leave. We told him that we just got our drinks but told us \"thanks for coming\" and proceeded to hover over us like a fat kid on a cupcake until we finished our drinks and left.

I walked in with two other friends, the bouncer wasn't at the door so we walked up to the bar and asked for a table. The server is great and starts to take us to the table when the bouncer then runs over and says we are kicked out. It turns out he wasn't at his post when we walked in, and he's nervously trying to fix the situation by kicking us out. Simply asking for our IDs would have been fine. I politely asked for his name and he told me his name was Johnny Appleseed....i understand you made a mistake, but it super easy to fix, just check out ids and let us have the table. At this point he says \"if you don't leave I will make you leave'. Feeling physically threatened we went to the door where I asked for the managers name or number, which he refused to give me. All I wanted was to be able to follow up on why I was kicked out of a bar with 3 friends who are meeting for a going away celebration. Not sure who the doorman with the powertrip is. Wears a fake diamond necklace, and 3 piece suit, keep an eye out this guy is a real jerk. Don't waste your time here this bar is trash.
