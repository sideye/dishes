The place serves typical traditional American fare such as burgers, sandwiches, omelets, salads, and pancakes. I came here for a cheeseburger once while on my afternoon stroll and enjoyed it quite a bit. There's nothing particularlly amazing about it, but all in all it is very good for a standard cheeseburger with mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles. Its taste is somewhat similar to that of an In-n-Out burger, but with a feeling of more substance and fresh flavors. At the end, the best thing about this place is definitely the charm, feel, and view. Seeing all the boats parked at Pier 40 with the ferry going by, birds in the air, and a nice breeze is very soothing and relaxing. Even hearing the sizzles of the cheeseburger patty on the grill adds to the atmosphere.\n\nIf you're looking for some delicious traditional American diner food right by the bay, Java House is definitely a nice charming place to be!", "author": "Joshua M."}

What I expected.  \n\nThe shack is broken up into two main sections.  A bar area and a grill with maybe 2 or 3 tables.  There are also a few tables looking out onto the bay outside.  I opted for one of these.  \n\nThey have a school directly below that gives lessons on how to navigate mini race car type sailboats. Arguably comical.

If what you are looking for is a sinfully delicious breakfast, I would not recommend JH. Yes, the scenery is beautiful and the atmosphere is one of a kind. It is rare to find a place in San Francisco where you order from a menu of under 10 choices (all of which are essentially 3 eggs with 1 added ingredient) and where a woman from a different room calls out your name and waits for you to fetch your order. However, if I would have gone out of my way to have an omelet here I would have been very disappointed that all I was getting was 3 eggs and the wierdest orange synthetic cheese. Maybe the pancakes and bacon would have been a better options so I will give this place another chance when the weather is nice enough to sit outside.

The owner, Phil Papadopoulos, and his family are incredibly welcoming and always thank me for my business. On my second visit, the woman at the counter apologized when she had to ask me to remind her of my name. It is the perfect place to sip a savory cup of coffee or a cold beer and pretend like you're on The Wire (complete with \"The Greek!\"). \nAs for the grub, I live 3 blocks away and have eaten here several times. I always order the wheat toast to save face when I get a bacon omelette, but secretly I get the toast because they serve it warm and slathered in  butter. I guess the food is pretty average, but there's just an element of homness to it that you wind up craving.
