I was brought up in Taiwan eating fresh grandma-made moon cakes so I have a high standard for these addicting things. It can get really annoying for other people when I am so picky about Chinese food, so I just go search out the goodies and then bring my friends to approved places. And I'm so happy to say that I found a place that makes awesome moon cakes!\n\nBought a box of red bean, mung bean, mixed nuts and lotus moon cakes all with yolk inside. Couldn't wait and took a bite out of the red bean then green bean cakes... oh was I in heaven! The outside layer melted in my mouth, perfectly textured, not rubbery like the imported ones. The bean pastes were done just right, not too sweet, and I can taste the flavor of the beans nicely. Looks like I'm gonna have to go back next week to grab another box. \n\nI also bought 5 of the bbq pork buns and they were big and warm, filled with pork and had great flavor. The buns themselves were soooo soft and yummy... so glad I don't live close by. I'd be stuffing my face with this every day!", "author": "Mei W."}

Giving it three stars because their cakes are good and fluffy which is why I like buying my cakes here. My favorite is the mango and the cakes have fruit on them so I feel very healthy buying them haha. BUT I was talked in to buying a chestnut cake last week and it wasn't all too great... I needed a smaller sized cake for a small group of friends and they only had 6in. cake in chestnut. The lady at the counter said it was good but I shouldn't have trusted her word. Next time I'm considering walking down a few blocks to Schubert's if they run out of mango cakes. \n\nAnyway I'm still bitter about the chestnut cake as you can tell but generally their breads are good too. The only thing that bothers me is how they try to sell you more than what you intentionally came for. It's just annoying but stand strong and don't cave in!", "author": "Debby N."}

The bakery might not look like much, but the workers here are very nice, accommodating, and professional. \n\nI came in to set up a time for cake-tasting. The master baker wasn't there, so the workers provided me with their portfolio to flip through and suggested I call back. When I came in for the cake-tasting, I was provided 6 different flavors to try from--mango mousse, coffee mousse, chocolate mousse, tiramisu, strawberry mousse, and sponge cake w/ strawberry cream filling. I loved that none of the cakes were overly sweet, perfect for me and the primarily Chinese guests at my wedding! We chose two flavors since we couldn't decide on just one :)\n\nTo book the cake, I had to place a 50% deposit plus a $100 deposit for the cake stand, which I got back after returning the cake stands, and pay the remainder of the balance one week before the wedding. I dropped off my cake topper to the bakery the same time I paid the balance. It's just one less thing for me to worry about. I text the master baker, Eddy, the design I wanted. And he did such a great job! I loved how elegant it looked and all my guests loved the cake too--both the look and the taste! Too bad I'm not getting married again or I'd order another wedding cake from here. The good news is, there are many birthdays and other celebrations to come.

She turned around and blamed me for not stating it clear enough to her from the beginning and make her re-do the work. Come on, what's so difficult to take out a tart and put it into another bag? All I can say is she is too lazy to even bother doing it for her customer, and even worst to put the blame on me. She was so persistent too in arguing with me, after a few exchanges where I can tell she is not gonna give up, I just stay quiet so that she can shut up.\n\nAlso, all the ladies at the store have the tendency to talk you into getting more stuff than you originally want to get.\n\nEver since this bad experience,  I have not been back to get anything for myself.

You have a choice of 2 types of fruit, canned fruits or fresh fruits. I like both, but I think the canned fruits one is a bit sweeter. The fresh fruits cake is more expensive too.

Walked in and was greeted by a very nice and friendly gentleman working there. They were almost out of cocktail buns which I had come in for, so he recommended the buttermilk bun (new favorite it's amazing!). They have a few tables and chairs for people to sit and eat, the place is very cute and clean. Food is delicious and the prices are very fair. Just make sure you bring cash because it's cash only.\n\nWe live about 45 minutes from San Francisco and don't go into the city that frequently. So the next time we came into SF we made a special trip to come back to cherry blossom bakery because I wanted to share this place with my family. Sadly I was disappointed. We were greeted gruffly by a woman who asked what we wanted. We needed some time to decide what we all wanted. She asked us 2 times if we were ready seemly rushing us and seemed annoyed like we were taking too long to decide, even tho there was no one in line behind us. As I said, we don't come into SF much, so we just wanted to take the time to look at everything they had to offer and try some new things. When we had decided she had gone to the back, so I politely called out to her to let her know we were ready to order. Waited a bit and no one responded or come to the front. We waited a bit more, and then I stepped to the side where she had walked off to see if I could see her. She was standing there organizing a tray of buns and I again politely said hi we've decided. She didn't acknowledge me or stop what she was doing. When she had finished organizing the tray she came up and said what would you like. \n\nIt felt like we weren't customers but more a an annoyance. This experience was disappointing because there is no shortage of Asian style bakeries in SF and we had made a special trip and brought our repeat business to this specific bakery. \n\nBottom line, the food is good, the prices are good.

I knew it would stink because I tried Durian ice cream from Polly Ann, so I was prepared somewhat. So I got a cake that fed 4 people that costs about $23. I was impressed with what it looked like because it was pretty looking and looked like a normal cake. it was very light texture cake that doesn't weigh you down like typical  American cakes would. The durian fruit is on the bottom of the cake and is yellow. Texture reminds me of a mango sort of I guess with some resistance to it? Hard to describe.  Yes, it did stink and you have to make sure you close the kid of the box tight or the smell will permeate throughout your fridge and in the room. LOL All in all it was an interesting and enjoyable experience. another foodie experience to cross off my bucket list! oh I did buy a hog dog bun and it was really good and fresh tasting. The dough was so soft. If you have a sweet tooth, you may enjoy the coconut bun. Next time I will try the pineapple custard bun and the egg tart and what other yelpers recommend.

I really didn't think that my white boyfriend would know what made a good Asian bakery, but the man knows his pastries, and this place is no exception.\n\nIt's exactly what an Asian bakery should be: super cheap, highly delicious, and a danger zone for bakery fiends like me, meaning I will probably definitely buy one of each thing in the display case.\n\nI desperately need to figure out when they get their cream cheese buns in, because those things are fantastic. They will let you know when the cocktail buns are fresh, and they are sooooo worth it. Also, I needed a last-minute cake for father's day last week...and I was able to get a full round tiramisu cake with writing on it for the low low price of about $22. And I didn't have to pre-order. It's just something they happened to have in stock at about 4pm and that is amazing considering I don't actually know when they close.\n\nThis place is cash-only, so be sure to visit an ATM on the way. $5 will get you all the things you really need in life when you go to Cherry Blossom Bakery: two cocktail buns, a walnut cookie, a cream cheese bun, and a slice of walnut pound cake. (Actually, that came out to $4.) You won't see the pineapple bun in the display case, usually, but you should absolutely make sure to get some, especially if they're fresh.

Not the steamed kind with the white exterior and the yolky interior.  Also not the \"pineapple\" crusted baked bun.  I was looking for a very specific \"nai-wang-bao\" that was oblong-shaped, baked, and had a large circular pattern drawn on top of the shiny golden brown dome.  I knew this thing existed because I had seen it before!  But previous attempts to actualize this bun in various shops along Clement street met with unfortunate quantities of \"pineapple\" topped custard buns or steamed custard buns.  \n\nAlso, I'd seen it in Sheng Kee Bakery for about $1.10.  \n\nOn the last day of last year, I bravely walked past Good Luck Dim Sum and kept on walking.  Past that crazy clothing store \"Get Thee To The Nunnery.\"  And wandered in here.  \n\nI saw some small buns that looked like it could be the custard bun.  Upon inquiry, the lady told me they were \"Mexican buns\" and did not contain anything.  \n\nBut then.\n\nIn the case.\n\nThe golden domed top.\n\nThe swirl pattern.\n\nThe oblong shape.\n\nAnd, of course, the sign: \"Custard Bun\"  \n\nFINALLY.  My rudimentary recognition of Chinese characters confirmed that I was calling it the correct name.  My Chinese recognition software in my head is like face recognition software.  It matches patterns without actually \"reading.\"  Heh.  \n\nThe cost was $0.80.  I got 1.  And I ate it in the dark.  By my self.  In the closet.  Covered in my shame.  But it was so good.  The bread part did not intimidate the custard part.  There was a good proportion of both.  Each bite had some bread and some custard.  \n\nThe next day I got 3.\n\nI was so desperate to find this bun that I was going to either stop eating all inferior imitations or make it myself.  Luckily for my oven, my family and my stomach, I won't have to attempt to make Asian Bread.  Because what the eff is that cooked paste thing they start with?

She didn't mentioned she would charge for the bags. It is not like she is giving us a discount on quantity purchase...we paid(or were going to pay) full price anyway.\n\n So if every customer that comes in to buy 1 pastry at a time, are they going to  ask them to wait for the next customer so they can put both their pastries in one bag?

We were blown away by their freshness and price. We went with a 3-tier cake with another sheet, which served about 400. Delicious! Sweetened just right! Gone by the end of the night. Since then, we've been coming back for cakes for birthdays and special occasion.", "author": "Dr T."}

We used to buy bread from Napolean because of the low price and okay quality.  After it changed to Cheery Blossom, we feel the real improvement of the cakes.  There're so many varieties.  So far, we have tried the following cakes: -\n\n1) Mango Moouse which is the best one there; a lot of mango (though sometimes the one on the outside seem dry), moist and just the right sweetness.\n\n2) Princess Cake which is a bit too sweet for the almond paste but it is really pretty; it's my birthday cake that my hubby bought me.  The cake was pink and I have received so much compliment on the appearance.\n\n3) Chocolate Moouse Cake offers a good portion of chocolate flavor, not too heavy, not too light.  Even my parents who don't really like chocolate like it.\n\n4) Tiramisu is not too outstanding but also good in taste.\n\n5) Fruit cake contains a lot of fruits and it's really tasty.\n\nThis bakery recently raised quite a bit on their breads, 10%+ but it's still not too expensive as compared to other bakeries in the same area.  They also introduced mini versions lately such as mini hot dogs, mini cupcakes... My son loves the mini cupcakes and min cakes which he can finish one on his own.  He feels happy that he needs not to share with his sister, haha...", "author": "Roserrele W."}

It isn't just the little buns that I have a penchant for...it's the overall serenity of the shop that I truly appreciate. That sounds somewhat silly but Clement can get hectic and it's a fragrant, tranquil refuge that is so comforting. I don't know what it is - every time I go in there the people are sweet as can be and it's nice and quiet and it smells so good - I just want to start bringing a blanky with me and hang out for awhile. That being said, this is a great place to come if you are hungover, starving and broke. Three bucks and you're Cherry Blossom Bakery rich. My favorites so far are the not so adventurous ham and cheese bun, the mini pork buns (great snacks for your friends too), and the scallion bun.

It used to be a small Chinese deli (chow mein, chow fun, take-out food, etc) but now it's a quaint little Chinese bakery.  The 2 young female employees were really friendly & bilingual.  I bought 4 items to try:  Curry beef pie, coconut bun, baked BBQ pork bun and scallion/pork bun.  \nI was disappointed by all 4.  The curry beef pie had a mushy filliing and you could barely taste any meat but the curry flavor was good.  The outer pastry wasn't flaky enough for me. I still think Alex's Bakery, further East on Clement makes better curry beef pies with a great flaky crust.\nThe coconut bun was OK, but you'd be better off buying it from Sunset Bakery on 9th/Judah.  The BBQ pork filling was OK, but for some reason the dough is consistently bad for all their baked products.  It's soft, mushy and doughy tasting.  I didn't care for the scallion/pork bun either (it's better at Sunset Bakery) where the initial bite tasted sweet when it's a savory bun.  Prices were reasonable.  Their business card has a picture of a wedding cake, which I gather means they make those too.
