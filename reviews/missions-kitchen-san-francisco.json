They don't speak hipster so simply stay away. I recommend The Little Chihuahua. I wrote a comprehensive review of the Lower Height location in 2010. Check it out.\n\nWe came in on a Sunday morning around 9:00 AM and there was a booth in the window waiting for us. How nice is that? We both ordered water and coffee while we looked at our choices.\n\n# Chilaquiles: This is a simple classic with tortilla chips, eggs, and salsa. I always ask for my egg over easy, however, the classic is scrambled. Everything in this was just how it should be. Difinately give it a try.\n\nOur server checked in often and our coffee and water were always full.", "author": "Justin S."}

Most people eating there are Latinx. \n\nFood is no-frills Mexican comfort food and incredibly affordable for the area. Where else can you get brunch for less than $10?\n\nI got the Chilaquiles and loved them. The refried beans had a nice richness and depth to them. I like the sour green Chile sauce that complemented it. I ordered it spicy and it was actually quite hot! An excellent brunch dish for a hangover.\n\nService was great.

It's also just down the street from the 24th Street BART station, making it in an ideal neighborhood to walk around and explore on any given day after your meal here.\n\nWe walked in on a Sunday a little after noon for brunch. The place was bustling but we were able to immediately get a seat in the back. The demographic was pretty mixed with young people, families, and seniors. The waiters seemed to know a lot of the regulars and were having super lively conversations with everyone inside. Overall a super neighborhood-seeming spot that made you feel welcome the moment you walked in.\n\nThe food itself was also a huge hit. We go the chilaquiles with refried beans and rice and the Mission Omelette with sourdough toast and hash browns. The chilquiles were topped with delicious queso blanco and the sides were a great filling side. The Mission Omelette was absolutely stuffed with ground beef, mushrooms, onions and bacon, making it almost overwhelmingly filling. Overall the portions were incredibly large and overwhelming in the best way.\n\nThe price also can't be beat! For a two dish brunch including tip and tax to come out to just over $20 in San Francisco is quite amazing. We'll definitely be coming back weekend after weekend.", "author": "Jenny D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-15", "description": "Sure, there are plenty of taquerias in the Mission but what about true greasy spoons that serve breakfast plates in the evening? I think they're severely underrepresented in the 'hood. Jim's is still around, but that formica-laden Sambo's-wannabe closes at 3PM (review: http://bit.ly/1NhE5O7). What good does that do me if I really want Joe's Special after work? That craving comes every so often, and instead of making it at home like any normal person would do since it's ridiculously simple to make, I go out to an appropriately working class diner, and it looked like Mission's Kitchen fit the bill (photo: http://bit.ly/1PectYy). It looked like the kind of spot that attracts hungover hipsters although 10PM seems early for that target clientele.\n\nIt was almost empty when I entered except for a slight Asian woman in the next booth who looked like she ordered half the menu. Speaking of which, it looked like a Denny's knock-off with a Mexican twist with dishes identified in English and descriptions in Spanish. It took me a while to figure out that the $9.95 Mission Scramble was their take on Joe's Special with scrambled eggs mixed with ground beef, onions, bell peppers and cheese. It was more on the greasy side and just a tad overcooked, but it did come with a crispy flat of hash browns which to be truthful was probably what I was really craving (photo: http://bit.ly/1hcHDVM). The Mexican twist came with the choice of tortillas instead of toast for those who want to turn the dish into a burrito.\n\nI must have been in the mood to replicate the deal at the Soma Inn Cafe where you can get their Joe's Special with pancakes. So of course, I went for a $5.25 Short Stack which came dusted in a hefty amount of powdered sugar (photo: http://bit.ly/1Mt8Al2). They had maple syrup, but I was intrigued enough by the condensed milk that I poured some on. Didn't care for it as it made the hotcakes far too sweet to enjoy as a side starch. The waitress came by periodically to see how I was doing, though I noticed when a couple of their regular customers came in, their attention wavered. But I guess that's a key part of the greasy spoon experience as you have to be a regular to get the \"Hiya, hon, whatcha' havin'?\"-level service.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...true diner fare in the Mission with a Mexican twist, but it falls short\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...yep, it's a diner alright\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...reasonable, not quite indifferent\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if you crave Joe's Special with tortillas, here ya go", "author": "Ed U."}

Their Mexican frittata is great, though watch out for the jalapenos if you're not one for surprise heat in your morning meal. Most (if not all) breakfast dishes come with a meat or potato side and a bread (either a tortilla or sliced bread, in most cases).

Why? Because there is no reason to! I can have an AMAZING Latin breakfast for $2 less! \n\nI was irritated that Curt failed to mention that:\n\n1) They have cute waitresses!\n2) They have a jukebox!!! (I LOVE jukeboxes)\n3) It is freaking cheap! \n4) The portions are massive\n5) It's ran by Latinos, frequented by Latinos and they play Spanish old school music\n6) They have an entire Latino breakfast menu (huevos divorciados, chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, Mexican frittata, Central American breakfast)\n7) They close at 10pm, which is a fucking rarity in this side of the Mission\n\nIt's been a few months and the honeymoon stage is still going strong. By now, Cristina, Lourdes, Miguel and the rest of the gang are part of my food family. \n\nNow to be completely fair, if I could change something about this place would be their drink selection, I wish they had fresh squeezed oj or at least Martinelli's apple juice because I dislike fountain drinks, but really, once I see my delicious huevos divorciados or beautiful chilaquiles (for $6.95!!!)

As we our eating close to finish my husband noticed a hair in his rice , so as anyone else would do , my husband lets the waiter know and shows it to him , the hair strand was thick and black , who knows if there was more in the rice . So as regular people we didnt make a scene and we didnt make a big issue about it , so the waiter says \" we will make you another plate \" , so we where ok with that , we waited less then 5-10 min and he arrives with the second plate , then he proceds and ask my hysband if he would like toast  , and he said yes , white pls .... as we seen the menue many times and since we order the samething everytime we go there , we know preatty much the price and what our order comes with , my husband couldnt finish his plate , and i was preatty muh done with my plate we where just about ready to pay and be on our way , well as we are waiting pateintly , husband ask for coffee , and for some odd reason the waiter is tottaly ignoring us and from this point , it just looks like we where not cared for anymore , he ask another waitress that was at the cash register doing nothing for coffee and all she does is calls the next waiter to serve us , and he never came as well , so my husband and i decide to get up and pay to and be on our way , well it took them 5 minutes to notice that we where leaving and the waiter quickly gets the bill ready , AS AM REVIEWING THE BILL I NOTICE AN EXTRA CHARGE , i tell him that , that was not on our order , then he gets a lil red and says to me that he charged 2.95 for extra toast , then i said well the bill doesnt say \"toast\" and when did we order extra toast ? , he told me that since he had to make another plate , he had to charge for extra toast , but keep in  mind there was a hair in the plate , and the plate comes with toast , so i left it alone and piad the bill, well my husband wasnt to happy , and goes back in and lets him know that the plato centro americano comes with toast and why would he charge extra ? ,  well he says , since we didnt charge for the second plate , he charged for the extra toast !!!!! What !!!!! you still have the nerve to say \" we didnt charge for the second plate \" when there was a hair in the food , you have to be kinding me , i think if he would of never try to charge for extra toast i would of left ok , but after finding a hair and being ignored after the fact , yeah i think anyone would also be upset", "author": "L P."}

I especially love Carlos and Mario would always provide good service and always check on you even if they are packed.  \n\nThe food is reasonable, delicious and always fast.  I recommend the Huevos rancheros and las chilaquiles.  I sometimes opt for the breakfast special which consist of T-Bone special with enchiladas and arroz y beans.\n\nkudos to La Mission kitchen", "author": "Isis L."}

Who else can I turn to when I'd rather eat a giant, grease laden, $3.00 breakfast burrito, and sleep standing up rather than actually work?  Gracias Tio!\n\nI have officially downgraded Mission's Kitchen.  Denada.   Because of the steel wool that I found nestled in my burrito about half an hour ago I shant return.

It does, however, have the feel of a new kid in school - shy and  a little unsure of itself but at the same time overly eager to please.\n\nMy breakfast was basic, but big and tasty enough to bring me back. On my second visit I ordered something in the south-of-the-border vein, and it was even better.\n\nMy third trip was a nooner - for lunch. A basic cheeseburger. No complaints, but my real reason for going back was to confirm the name in order to write this review (yesterday, I tried searching Yelp for \"Mission Kitchen\" and without the apostrophe s... nada).\n\nI had to explain their own menu to them, which was a funny little adventure: \"It says here that I get a choice of fries, soup, salad or mashed potatoes with my lunch, so...uh...\" But I habla no Spanish, so the response was a blank stare. Another waiter came over and the two of them consulted for a few minutes. Then, with everyone on the same page, I chose the soup.\n\nIt was fine, but I'll stick with their breakfast from now on.", "author": "Shawn S."}

Big fat sucky mistake.\n\nThe service was extremely s-l-o-w.  The servers were pretty nice but somewhat inattentive.  Was it because we sat in the nook in back?  Unsure!  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my friend had the huevos rancheros.  25 minutes later we got some lukewarm food that tasted sort of meh.  You know, meh.  Okay, not wonderful - not even \"ok.\"  If it had been the temperature food is supposed to be served at, maybe it'd be \"ok.\"  Because we were hungry and pretty thankful we finally got something plunked down in front of us, I think we just shut up and ate it.  But I ate mine somewhat angrily.\n\nWould I go back here?  Heck no buddy.  It is cheap so if you're broke and don't care about that which you ingest, give it a go.  You'll understand what I mean.  Next time I think I'll force my friend to walk the extra little bit.", "author": "Katherine P."}

Little Mission's Kitchen occupies the same space of the long-running John's Diner, a place known for a really sweet hostess who treated you like family and served up eh-OK food. Flipping the script, the food is now really great and the service, though totally friendly, sadly for crap. But with it being an unrepentent diner, and not say another damn celphone store, that's still right around the corner from my house, I want to love M's K more than I actually do.\r\n\r\nMexican and American breakfasts at around $5-6, standard diner luncheS and dinners are $6-10. Huge plates. Delicious home fries. On the minus side, me and buddy-pal watched as our toast cooled visibly in the toaster, an additional waffle never materialized at all. Yet still my Chilaquiles were pretty good (if a little damn too spicy, which I don't often say about anything) and buddy-pal's Huevos Rancheros looked great. \r\n\r\nAs inept as the CS was, I'll be back, if only in the hopes that Mission's Kitchen (Mission Diner anyone?) eventually overlaps their quality of service with their inexpensive traditional fare.", "author": "Jeremy W."}

I remember ordering the salmon scramble and the french toast with fruit that first time, and I've \"been a fan\" ever since.\n\nWhen I took Kota Bear here for the first time, she ordered the pancakes and they fixed them so that they were shaped like Mickey Mouse's head. I didn't even notice until she pointed it out. Now whenever I watch Kota on the weekends, we have breakfast here almost every Sunday and it's become our spot. I think she's hooked on the Pops cereal :-)  \n\nThis past Sunday we ordered chicken nuggets, Pops, and a breakfast burrito and it all came out to about $13. It's a good deal for all the food you get, but stick to their breakfast. I've come for dinner and it's not as crackin as their breakfast.

I give it 3 stars for quality of Food, Service and Atmosphere - an extra star for price.\n\nThe food is pretty standard diner fare for San Francisco, but offers several nice hispanic twists.  I am a big fan of the Chilaquiles (fried tortilla chips with eggs, green salsa, and peppers).\n\nThe service is mostly attentive and very friendly.  I love that when leaving the whole restaurant - line cooks, manager, and all say goodbye.\n\nThe atmosphere is standard diner booths/counter.  Clean, a little snug in places, bright and not too loud.\n\nOverall, I think it is a 3.5 star spot.
