This small, homey restaurant feels just like being in someone's living room, with eclectic decorations and mix-and-match furniture. The someone, though, is someone who makes super fresh and super delicious Asian food.\n\nPlease be kind to the owner, Eugenie. It's a wonder how one can play all the roles of a restaurant without getting frazzled. Yes, the wait will be horrendously long, but can you imagine having to handle multiple stove burners, ovens, blenders, and whatnot all by yourself? Think about it this way; if one person at the table orders baked spaghetti, another orders fried rice, another orders soup, and the other orders clay pot, how many simultaneous pots/pans will she be having to deal with at the same time? Then imagine that times 5(?) for the number of tables in the restaurant. \n\nThe wait is super worth it though. If you come ~5pm you may be one of the first groups there and will have less of a wait. The food was tasty, well-portioned, and fresh. I saw all the photos of the entrees topped with melted cheese and I knew I had to be there. It definitely did not disappoint! This isn't some food that is quickly slapped together; most of these dishes do require intensive preparation!\n\nDefinitely enjoyed coming here and recommend it, but eat a small snack beforehand if you're starving! And order dessert at the same time you order your entrees.", "author": "Brittany L."}

If you look through the negative reviews, you'll see that most of them are taking issue with something totally unrelated to the food quality (like not having free open internet...I know this is SF, but c'mon, it's a restaurant not a WiFi router).\n\nPortions aren't huge, but I think Americans just need to get used to the idea of having a smaller amount of really high quality food.\n\nMy friends and I ordered the ramen with brisket and beef tomato broth (divinely deep, umami flavors) the pork belly clay pot (juicy, flavorful pork with greens and tofu and an egg) and the papardelle with brandy cream sauce (so, so much lighter, more restrained, and more scrumptious than I was expecting). \n\nFor dessert, we had the cha cha bowl (hot coconut milk with black sticky rice, adzuki beans and an outstanding, but solitary, piece of black sesame-filled mochi) and an ice cream pillow (ice cream wrapped up with a crepe--too much whip cream, but the ice cream and crepe combo was perfect).\n\nSuch lovely ambiance.

On a Monday night at 7pm, the place was initially packed but everyone seemed to leave at once and it was very quiet. The prices were on the higher side. \n\nI was surprised to be eating spaghetti, LOL. We ordered the spaghetti bolognese, a vegetable curry with rice, and the clam cream sauce with rice. For dessert, we had mango pillows and a sesame paste + tofu bowl. The spaghetti was pretty good and I finished mine quickly. The rice dishes seemed\nenormous. I want to go back to try the spaghetti with the meat leg everyone's posting about. The pillows were good as well. It was my first time trying the sesame paste and I liked it! I guess I expected something more Asian but my friend said the influences Hong Kong had experienced had led to this. \n\nThere was only one server working and things got a bit slow. The bathroom broke after one person used it. Something negative is that a friend of ours wanted the Portuguese dish, and they ran out, so she took more time to look at the menu. They didn't come back to take the order until 25 minutes later, and had said they also ran out of spaghetti (the rest of us were already eating by this time). My friend had to settle for rice and ended up eating when we all had finished. :/ When they brought the plate out, they had the nerve to say \"You ordered late, expect it late.\" ??? imig\n\nWe ended up paying like $20 per person and honestly, I can get better food for $20 but it was nice to hang out with my friends.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-31", "description": "It's been a while since I've entered the strangely mystifying realm of Mango Medley and decided to embark with the boyfriend into its magical, perplexing kingdom. To my surprise, this visit (probably my 4th or 5th on ever) was the best out of any of them.\n\nSome changes had been made since I last visited Mango Medley. For one, the dining room is the only place you can enter into now. Before there was another room that overlooked the kitchen, past a counter, with a huge menu over it, that made it confusing as to where to stand and wait for a table. That area is now blocked off, making the walk-in process much more straightforward, though now I'm not sure where you'd stand if all the tables are full. Probably outside.\n\nSecondly, rather than have any sort of server, the owner and chef was the one to seat us and take our order. We came in at 9:30 on a Thursday and there were only a few tables besides us. Even still, service had a bit to be desired. I was very happy that this was the first time I actually felt taken care of, though, service-wise.\n\nThirdly, the menus for Dinner and Dessert have been updated. My go-to Salmon Pineapple Bacon fried rice is now \"Pineapple bacon fried rice with choice of meat\" (no salmon option, *sadface* ). And no more avocado or taro shake, (also *sadface*). The menus are so extensive, though, that it's easy to try a new thing every time you come in. And with their track record for good food, it wouldn't be a mistake.\n\nTHE FOOD (!!!) as always, and maybe even better than what I remember, was so so good. Mango Medley always has a homemade quality with personal touches to it, everything I've ever ordered from here has been delicious. This particular evening we had:\n\nBeef Brisket Soup\nSeafood Curry w/ Rice\nSoy Ginger Drink, LG\n\nI couldn't decide between the Oxtail and Beef Brisket soup, but ended up going with the brisket as it came with noodles. Added egg for $1.50 extra. The flavor of the broth was out-of-this-world rich and gratifying. The meat was tender and flavorful and just like the most succulent pot roast out of a slow cooker. The addition of Asian greens and mushrooms added complexity and good texture. Yum.\n\nSeafood Curry came with some shrimp, mussels, and pieces of fish in a yellow curry sauce. Rice was extra, $1.50 or $2 I think, but you gotta have it with your curry! This dish was also delicious and we both were able to get one mussel and a couple shrimp each when sharing it.\n\nThe hot Ginger Soy drink we ordered to go after paying, and it was delicious. Very spicy, warm, and sweet without being overpowering. The perfect way to end a nice night out walking into the cool evening. \n\nAlthough the service is still left to be desired, this has got to be my smoothest experience at this strange but delicious little restaurant. Much more likely to come back sooner than later based on this most recent visit.", "author": "Megan D."}

I was craving some dessert and convinced the hubby to come here.\n\nAs I recall, the place is tiny.  Therefore, if you're coming with a large group, seating is limited.  Also, if you're claustrophobic, this may not be the place for you.  \n\nWe ordered:\n\nMango Delight - Slices of mango with grapefruit that wasn't very good. Both \"A\" and I  had it before here in the past and enjoyed it but this time something was definitely off.\n\nCreme Brulee - It was cold and not hot like another Yelper mentioned.

We spent a good 5 mintues waiting to see if the waitress would come by so we could ask her for a spoon to no avail, so we ended up just taking one from a cup of spoons on another table.

By this time, all the surrounding tables we found were OUT OF SPOONS. We managed to scavenge one up, but one of my friends had to eat his doufu fa with chopsticks. Yes, chopsticks. You can all imagine how well that worked out for him xD. I tried some of my friend's mango doufu fa, and I thought it was a bit weird mixing the mango with the ginger, but she liked it.\n\nLast but not least came the cream pillows.

Now, that's not a bad thing, i love me some crepes, but I wish this was explained a bit more.\n\nThe waitress herself was nice and she joked with me a bit when she was taking our orders.

My main purpose here was to try some yummy desserts. \nMango & Ice Cream Pillows 4/5\nBlack Sticky Rice with Mango and Coconut Milk 5/5\nSweet Tofu with Mango 5/5\nKumquat Drink with Grass Jelly 1/5\nJasmine Tea that we had to order at the end 1/5\n\nWe notice they have many rules and charging tea by how many head count is stupid. What if one person want Jasmine tea and other person want another tea?I didn't like how they put the tab when were still eating our dessert and she never bother to take our order until we had to go looking for her. This dessert place has good desserts but I wouldn't come back again. If someone doesn't care for your business , I shall take it else where. It's funny how this place charges things from to go box to plastic bags to reusable bags but why not provide better customer service so you can get more tips.", "author": "Miri L."}

The first thing that comes to mind when people hear Mango Medley would be anything related to mangoes and henceforth people would easily believe that this joint serves only desserts with mangoes. However, Mango Medley specializes in desserts specifically mango ones but caters to everybody's needs and serves entrees and non-mango items as well.\n\nMANGO FRAPPE ($4.25): Very thick in consistency almost like that of a milkshake as mentioned by the name; Very strong and deep mango flavor; A bit sweeter than I'd like - extra sweetness tasted more like it came from syrup than naturally from the mangoes themselves\n\nMANGO BLISS ($6.95): Presentation was nice - bowl supported by a stand almost like a tall wine glass; Contained mango chunks, mango puree/juice, coconut sauce, and mango ice cream; Didn't have this but bro seemed to enjoy it immensely - thought combination of mango components meshed well with coconut sauce\n\nHK-STYLE MILK TEA ($4.25): Seemed decent but folk had nothing to rave about; Nice how they took our request of taking out grass jelly and red bean into consideration; Not sweet; Probably wouldn't come here for a non-mango item\n\nORGANIC MANGO HOUSE MADE TOFU-FA ($5.50): Great rendition with a nice addition of mangoes; Not sweet in the least bit \n\nSERVICE: Service was a bit slow considering how many people were waiting for our table though only one lady was working though the place is quite small with approximately 6 tables \n\nDECOR: Pretty unique and quirky place; Very quaint and cozy; Felt like it had previously been a Japanese restaurant\n\nMango Medley exceeded my expectations since every dessert we ordered was strong. This place really knows how to do their mango items well so if you stick to that you'll have a great first experience here. They use as many organic ingredients as possible so they really distinguish themselves from other Asian dessert places.", "author": "Jacquie H."}

It felt a little awkward since we just stood in this small area unsure of what we should do and people would just stare as they are waiting to get their orders taken. Later, we kind of just sat ourselves while some people left because her communication with us was horrible. We decided on what we should get a couple minutes later.

I've noticed that many people say not to expect any type of good service here, but the reality is, the service isn't just bad, it's straight up RUDE!! \n\nI had my uncle and cousins coming in from out of town and I decided they should try their ice cream pillows. Well, everyone ended up ordering different items and when the food came, my uncle asked the waitress why there weren't mangoes in his dessert. The waitress/owner (a Chinese lady in her 40-50's, I'm assuming she's the owner since she's always the only person there running the whole restaurant) replied in the NASTIEST tone ever \"that's what you ordered.\" My uncle then said, \"I thought mangoes were included because that's what the menu said.\" Then, we get an even nastier response \"How do you not know the name of the restaurant of the place you're eating in?\" (This entire conversation was in Chinese.) ---OK PAUSE. I told everyone we were going to a place called Mango Medley, it's good to note that I never mentioned to anyone the restaurant's name in Chinese because I don't know what it is, it was also late at night-- pitch black to be exact, and because we had a party of 8, everyone just chatted and followed my lead into the restaurant. \n\n1. If someone is a tourist, they might not know all the different names of streets and places they are visiting or eating at because the locals are their tour guide.\n\n 2. JUST because I'm Chinese, or Asian for that matter, doesn't mean they know the ^%*king CHINESE name of every Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area. \n\n3. If I'm hungry, am I not allowed to go into the first restaurant I see so that I can order something to eat? I think if I'm starving, heck, I'll stumble into the first place I see for a small appetizer, snack, and whatnot, I wouldn't probably give a cow's dung on what that restaurant was called until after I'm not starving...\n\nAnyway, bottom line, the waitress/owner could have just explained that the restaurant named a vast majority of their items \"mango whatever\" and not necessarily have mangoes in the dish. There's no need to be a beezy about things. \n\nThe dessert was actually not that good either, the quality for the ice cream or just plain cream pillows-- it's just like sweet crepes but wrapped into a pillow shape instead of the typically cone shape or spread out on a plate...NOT A BIG DEAL. I think the crepes in Japantown taste better and the people there appreciate the business they get. \n\nThe aftermath is that I am never coming back to this place, I don't need someone to ruin my mood over some mediocre desserts that's like $5-8 bucks.", "author": "Denise L."}

Every time I come here, the setting changes and the prices increases more and more. It's pretty ridiculous because they used to give unlimited self served tea (free-of-charge). Then, they served tea in individual cups and now, they charge for tea. That was one thing that made them different from all the other Asian dessert spots.\n\nIn terms of desserts, they have good mango cream pillow and mango delight. The strawberry cream pillows (in my opinion) does not taste as good as the mango ones and they stuff the strawberry pillows with extra whipped cream. I also ordered the Roti as an appetizer and it was okay. The peanut sauce as the curry tasted a bit weird. Maybe it's because I usually order the Roti at Banana Island so it couldn't compare. \n\nThe service is extremely slow since they usually have only one server and sometimes two workers. In the past, I waited an average of 40 minutes to get the mango pillow dessert so I would come here to have long chats to catch up with people. Luckily now, I only have to wait 15-20 minutes for my desserts.

I love the asian greens with pork belly and I also love the kimchi fried rice with pork or chicken.  These two dishes, enough to serve two people come to $18.  Bargain!  The pork belly is always so tender and delicious, I never wish to share.\n\ngood things to know:  \n--If you live in the area, call ahead and order takeaway.  It's quick!\n--No alcohol :(  (another reason to take away)\n--If you want to eat in, go early when it's slower\n--Don't sit by the door.

Kelley.\n\nThis place is so underrated.  It is excellent.  The food feels lovingly home-cooked with subtle flavors. All of the desserts are exquisite, especially the mango pillows (every slice of mango is perfectly ripe - how the f#$% can they keep this up?), but the food is f#$%ing stellar too!  This is an authentically transplanted Hong Kong cafe; anyone who's familiar will get taken right back and newcomers will learn what to look forward to.   Although the new layout (post city inspection) isn't quite as charming as it used to be, the essence is still there.  Prices are very reasonable.  The one lady (who seems to be the owner because she is always cooking and sometimes serving) has great energy and obviously really cares about the quality of the service.  I guess people complain about that but i haven't had any problems - I love this place and recommend it to everyone!\n\nTry the pork belly and the vegetable soup with mushrooms and noodles.  \n\nThe highly successful Mission Chinese food is great but the food is rich, fried, super spicy... it hits you over the head with flavor.  Mango Medley is the opposite, it's light, subtle, soft, home-made, can be eaten again and again.  We go back often.

Of course we didn't wanna pay because its the stores responsibility for customers' safety. Besides, we didnt even have time to eat because the shelf fell. A customer who saw the incident then came out and told the manager it is absolutely ridiculous that they are asking us to pay because we could sue them. It's their fault that the shelfs weren't properly installed. The shelfs are tied with a cable which is not even safe to be placed in the store behind customers' head. \n\nOkay beside that, the more ridiculous thing is that they chased after the other group and tell them to pay for us. Of course they refused to pay because it wasnt their fault either. We were about to call the police to solve the issue and they got scared and said: the bill is on us, thank you for your time!

I've always experienced great service and personal attention from the time of my first visit, and the owner has a great, sassy attitude that is really endearing when you meet her there.  \n\nThe menu is unique and special, and a rare vision of the cliche 'Asian fusion' variety.  There is a rotating base of seafood, rich mixed beef cuts, and wild mushrooms in a selection of bases ranging from curry to soup to awesome, comforting and unique noodle and rice bakes with or without cheese on top.  There is also a great menu of what I understand as classic Asian desserts that I've seen many come in to enjoy for their own sake, though I've never tried them.  I often stop by while walking my dog to put in an order, and when I get back from the beach the food is hot and ready to enjoy.\n\nI've taken many people there, and every time I have someone new there they comment on the uniqueness and depth of the food.  When we eat in, it's always an intimate experience in a homey place.  \n\nThe prices are very reasonable.

They served us a hazardous dessert and demanded us to either purchase another item that can potentially make people sick or pay $4 for no reason?!?!  RIDICULOUS!! \n \nOf course, we refused to pay the minimum charge, so a lady with a MESSY and BLACK ponytail (the hair's owner?) barged out from the kitchen and THREATENED to call the police on us.

When we first walked in, Mango Medley looked more like a coffee shop then anything else.  It's a bit small, but it does have a cozy type of feel to it.  \n\n    They did have a regular food menu, but we didn't really look at it since we were only there for dessert. Typical rice and noodle dishes. However, I did notice that they have daily set specials and Happy Hour specials after 9pm.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nMango Medley Delight  $5.95\nGrass Jelly+Almond Jelly+Mango Sauce+Fresh Fruit  $4.95\nPanna Cotta Bowl w/mango $4.95\n\nThe portions were a bit small for the price, but I was quite happy with my dessert. The panna cotta was rich and creamy, and the mangoes were just the way I liked them.  Not overly ripe, but firm, sweet, and with tart undertones.  I was too full to try the desserts my friends ordered, but they claimed it was good.\n\nThe only hiccup was that my friend's Mango Medley Delight took forever to come. Literally half an hour after the other two desserts came.   This was a bit odd considering the restaurant was pretty much empty at the time.  \n\nPros:\n\nGood mango desserts\nOpens late ( until 1 am Fri. nights, 12am Sat. nights)\nFriendly service (albeit a bit slow) \n\nCons:\n\nA bit pricey for what you get\nCash only\n\n\nI would come back here to try their other desserts:)", "author": "Anna C."}

The waitress actually came up to us to say that we were only at $7.70, but we had to spend $8.

What else could we say if we didn't want to order anything else? \n\nThe restaurant was not crowded at all, but it still took awhile for us to receive our desserts. It didn't make sense to me to have 2 people taking our orders from each side of the table; I felt smothered. One was writing it on a piece of paper, and the other was using an iPad.

I doesn't know whether it wants to be a cafe, a restaurant, dessert house, or a storage room and office space.  \n\nUpon walking in, you notice a cafe-like counter serving teas, coffee, and Asian drinks.  I asked if we order at the counter or take a seat, they told us to just sit wherever.  Walking down the stairs into the dining room, you find a cute little loft setting for a dining area with picture of San Francisco, and some art piece on the walls.  \n\nThen I noticed the oddities.  There was a wooden screen semi-blocking a computer, desk, chair, boxes and a bike.  Hence, my curiocity of it being a storage area.  But oh well.  Haha.  \n\nFurthermore, Mango Medley is confused between being Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, and Indian.\n\nThe appetizer section had options ranging from Japanese Gyoza, to Vietnamese Spring Rolls, to Indian Roti...you get the picture.  For entree's it ranges from Hong Kong Baked rice and spaghetti items, Pineapple Fried Rice, Katsu...and a section of vegetarian options. \n\nWhile Mango Medley is diverse, and has a picture menu of options, it was a bit difficult to decide on what to order.  \n\nHowever, my little sister and I had came here after dinner with our folks at Dragon River, so we were only in the mood for dessert.   \n\nWe decided on the Mango Medley as of course the name of the place implies, as well as the Mango Ice Cream \"Pillows.\"  \n\nBoth were disappointments.  Not only were the not visually appealing for dessert, but they both really lacked any other flavor and creativity.  The Mango Medley was blended mangos, with Jello pieces of Aloe, cut up apple pieces and mango on top.  Eh...thats all I can say.  Nothing special at all.  \n\nThe Mango Ice Cream Pillows, if you are wondering what these are, is pretty much a Crepe pancake wrapper with a scoop of mango ice cream, wipe cream, and a piece of mango inside.  It was just alright, I would've preferred it to have been a little pan-fried on the top drizzled caramel and more powderd suger.  =X I'm so bad.\n\nI would definitely prefer to come back here for dinner or lunch sometimes as their regular menu seems to be pretty interesting with all of the diverse options to chose from.\n\nService here stinks!  Slow as hell, and definitely put me to sleep.  Our waitress walked around in her flip flops and oversized jeans that dragged on the floor, and literally walked as if she just woke up.  We waited 45 minutes for our dessert.  There was only one person cooking, as we noticed while walking out.  \n\nWe asked for tea to drink to our surprise, it is literally like a little \"self serve\" place, somewhat.  You get your own tea, water, forks, spoons, napkins, hot sauce, soy sauce, etc, at a little station.  Interesting.  \n\nOverall, desserts are really mediocre here.  I will skip next time.

After waiting for 45 minutes before the appetizer comes and 1 hour before the main entries comes, I almost made up my mind to give this place a 1-star rating. \n\nI mean, it is not that the customer service was bad or anything, but they just keep you waiting forever to the point you want to leave. Here is how this works. You walk in there and find an available table if you are lucky enough. After 15 minutes of endless wait, the waitress comes over to take your order. It takes another 45 minutes to 1 hour for your order to come in. As a matter of fact, my wife made multiple suggestions to leave during the waiting process, and I am glad I was able to resist the constant temptation to do the same. However, couple other people left within the first 20 minutes, from our observation. \n\nAnyway, after 1 hour of waiting and transformation from hungry, to very hungry, and finally to not hungry at all, our main order came. Boy, the food was soooo good that I have to say it was well worth the wait. Only if the wait can be cut in half that I am willing to come to this place more often. Trust me, if you can wait for that long, the food won't dissapoint. Not sure if long wait if part of the restaurant's strategy to differentiate itself from competitors, but it is definitely not a very good strategy for turnover and profitability. \n\nAll in all, if you are not the type that can wait, this is not the place for you. Otherwise, bring a book or magazine to read with you and make sure you are not too hungry going in. Good luck!", "author": "Jun W."}

This place may be hard to find since it's on a pretty dead street. I ordered the Mango Bliss with grass Jelly and my girlfriend ordered the Taro Bliss with tofu-fa. The portions were HUGE for the price however the dessert was only OKAY. It's a bit too sweet for my taste.\n\nService was kind of SLOW because we literally have to snipe down the waitress to order. The dessert took a little over 15 minutes to get here when there were only 2-3 other tables in here.

You walk in and just see boxes of mangoes stacked by the cash register - always a good sign. \n\nWe ordered a Mango Bliss with Almond Jelly, a Mango Bliss with Panna Cotta, a Mango Panna Cotta Bowl, and 2 Mango and Ice Cream Pillows. \n\nMango Bliss has TONS of fresh mango, ice cream, this coconut syrup thing, mango puree, and your choice of base. Almond jelly was really good as a base cause the almond taste balances the sweetness of the ice cream. The panna cotta tasted like cream cheese and was really filling (but I love cream cheese so it was okay). \n\nThe Mango Panna Cotta is basically the Mango Bliss without the ice cream and topped with this jelly stuff. It's pretty good but again the panna cotta tastes like cream cheese.\n\nThe cream pillows are really rich and you cannot eat a lot of them.

Was recommended by a friend, loved it, never ordered another thing. Came in all the time, the owner sort of remembered me, so I felt at a point that she knew my usual.\n\nI knew of the policy. The policy is that you have to know what you order, because there is no re-dos. I UNDERSTAND. It's a hassle. It can be a long wait if there's a lot of people. I haven't had a huge problem yet. I've waited over an hour for food once. I never had a problem because I UNDERSTOOD HOW THIS PLACE WAS MANAGED. So I respected it ... Until.\n\nOne night I ordered a Mango Bliss, my usual. The owner didn't ask what Base I wanted, which is Panna Cotta. I assumed she remembered since that's all I ever get. My food comes, and I had NO IDEA what came. I asked the owner if she gave me the wrong dessert. She said no, and that I ordered a MANGO MEDLEY and there were no re-do. \n\nI know, for a fact, 100%, I swear on my dead Gameboy's grave that I DID NOT ORDER A MANGO MEDLEY. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT DESSERT EXISTED. \n\nI just ate it. It wasn't bad though, but I still ate in frustration. I understand the policy. But that's only valid if I KNEW WHAT I ORDERED, not WHAT THE SERVER PUT DOWN ON THE IPAD THEY USE. Fortunately, the Mango MEDLEY was slightly cheaper.

When it fills up, you'll have to put your name down and wait.  What is interesting is all the posters around the restaurant, it is decoration but a series of rules and fine print charges.  If you buy food and hang out in the side walk they charge you $2, if you want additional boxes they charge you, if you need to use the restroom before you order they charge you, if you need additional utensil more than what you order they charge you- WTF?!?!  I thought it was a joke at first but am pretty sure it is not.  The servers are a little rough too, I came in with a party of 3 and there are 3 seats on the counter while other tables are full.  We asked to sit at the counter and the waitress said no we cant sit there.  Then this other waitress came and said, here sit at the counter, we told her that someone else said no and her response is, I'm the boss here, I said you can sit here. Ok.....sit here we will.  When ordering food, I asked for a couple accommodations or subs and they said no to everything.  When asked to clarify something on the menu, she looked at me like I was from another planet. The environment itself there is just very strange.\n\nAs far as desserts go, I love durian and love that they have a ton of different durian desserts- it isn't that common to find generally.  So does it taste good?  Yea, but not because their concoction is amazing, it is because the durian (previously frozen and then thawed half way only) is delicious.  Basically they put a scoop of ice cream with ice or condense milk and throw in a large chunk of frozen durian and charge you $7 for it.  There is nothing inventive or innovative about their menu. I guess you can say their pillows are creative but it is a crepe folded differently with ice cream and again, chunks of frozen durian. Durian tofu-fa, same thing, it is good but yea I could have gotten my own tofu-fa and got durian and thrown it together at home to get the same thing. \n\nIf I'm craving for a durian dessert, I would come here, simply because they have it.

The salmon toast was FISHY as can be, the muscles tasted like some weird combination of vinegar and ripe cheese, the eggplant had some chunks of sausage or bacon or something, and the salad didn't taste fresh at all. Every bite seemed worse than the last. \n\nI've never said \"this tastes weird\" so often in my life. After eating maybe 1/3 of the appetizer dish, the waitress brought out my girlfriend's salad. The prawns were ok, but the rest of the salad was just a strange mix-match of fruit and vegetables that seemed completely random, and the sauce / salad dressing didn't add anything whatsoever.

It sounded so promising that I thought I might have another desert spot that I can come to for Asian deserts.\n\nWhen we got here, there was only 1 waitress.  The location is like two store fronts where they tore a wall down and it was very awkward.  We didn't know where to go to find the waitress or where to sit.  When finally seated, the awkward bench seating was hard and uncomfortable.  I guess there were waters in the middle of the restaurant that were self service which we had no idea about until another couple went for it but there was no mention about it from the waitress.  Kinda important don't you think?\n\nIt took at least 10 minutes for the waitress to come and take our order and another 45 MINUTES, 45 MINUTES!!!! How long does it take to put some panna cotta in a bowl and pour mango syrup over it?!?!?! The only redeeming quality that makes this place earn 2 stars is the mango desert was actually pretty damn good.  Mango chunks with mango ice cream and mango syrup.  The panna cotta was buttery and creamy, a little rich after awhile but the first couple bites were delicious.  K was equally happy with her desert but damn, that customer service.  Atrocious.\n\nFix the service, make a desert as quick as any other Asian desert place in the city and you would have so much more business and RETURN business but until then, terrible.", "author": "Brian C."}

Grass jelly and almond jelly w/mango: Light, flavorful, good for sharing. \n4. Mango bliss: It came in a goblet! Mango custard with mango sauce with mango ice cream with mangos.

Their minimun order posted on the menu for $3. After ordering she said they uped their minimum order to $4 per person. We thought it was unfair since they didn't post it, what to stop any restaurant from making up rules when you decide to dine. We told her we only brought so much cash and it wasn't posted. She told us either order more or she'll charge $4 for each instead. So we basically took the overcharge out of her tip.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-14", "description": "Believe it when everyone says that service is SLOW.  It's ridiculous!  I didn't think it could be THAT bad... so I gave it a chance.  Came here with 10 people tonight for some dessert, around 10pm.  The place really only holds 20 people max.  It's very small.  Luckily for us, there were 2 really nice people who offered to move tables for us so that we could all sit together.  (THANKS if you're reading this!!)  Don't come here with a lot of people.  \n\nThe menu is pretty extensive, and has no real identity... we couldn't tell what culture this restaurant was supposed to be...  We all ordered different things, but they all came out one by one... like 20 minutes after an other.  It was ridiculously slow. \n\nMy friend tried to order vanilla ice cream by itself (he doesn't like asian desserts) and the waitress looked at him as if it was the most absurd order EVER.  After a bit of convincing, the waitress said regular vanilla ice cream was fine (for $3.25! - I mean come on! They serve red bean paste over vanilla ice cream but we still had to convince her to serve regular ice cream?!?! LOL)\n\nWe also ordered the Roti with squash curry dipping sauce (NO MANGO ROTI EXISTS!! =(  I asked ), Mango Medley, Mixed fruit panna cotta, mango tofu-fa (sweet tofu), corn pancakes, chicken and rice, purple yam and red bean pillows, thai tea latte, and creme brulee.  For Happy Hour (some daytime hours and after 9pm on weekdays, for #1-8 on the HH menu, you get additional choices of buttermilk panna cotta, tofu-fa, or coffee.  So I got the panna cotta with the Roti.  \n\nThe food was good, but again, the service was SOOOOOO incredibly slow that we wanted to cancel half our orders... and even then, we couldn't get the waitress' attention.  I think she goes and helps the person in back cook.  We felt bad for her, but seriously... hire another person!! \n\n We also ordered Kimchi fried rice, but the waitress got the order wrong and brought out this tofu, eggplant fried rice.  When we told her it's wrong, she told us there was no more rice, so she couldn't re-do the order.  How pathetic!  My friend was so hungry that she took it anyway.  It tasted good, but seriously, get your act together!\n\nOther than that mishap, the mango puree that accompanies most desserts is absolutely delicious!!!  The mangos were ripe and sweet.  The panna cotta had too much of a cream cheese flavor, I would have done without it.  The Tofu-fa flavor was strongly masked by the mango puree.  You couldn't taste the tofu-fa at all unless you ate it by itself, and even then it wasn't as sweet as you thought.  But it's still good.  The corn pancakes were different from any kind of asian pancake I've had.  You can tell it was made from scratch.  Very tasty, but SOo hot when it comes out!  The Roti came with 2 roti cakes, and the squash curry sauce.  The sauce was a little spicy, but it went well with the Roti.  It was actuallly very delicious!  I would definitely get that again if I ever go back... The Thai tea latte was hot, and tasted really good.  It also reminded me of the thai tea latte that i have in packets at home.  The pillows took the longest to come out (around 11:40pm).  There were 4 pillows--red bean and purple yam bits with whipped cream wrapped in crepe-like wrapper into the form of a pillow.  It was good, but would have been better if the stuff inside wasn't cold!! and if it had more powdered suger on top.\n\nOverall, good food but terrible service.  It's not fancy inside, so don't expect the plates/cups/utensils to be fancy either.  Set aside a good 2hours if you want to come here.", "author": "Diane L."}

The food here are way too overpriced, just changing an ice cream flavor to another has a 75 cent surcharge. I used to be a frequent customer to this place, some times I would wait over an hour just for 2 simple orders. But, the service here is really bad. I understand the workers uncaring attitude, sadly even the owner doesn't know how to make things right. I always say hi to the owner and talk to the owner here and there, brought tons of friends over. The owner always has this \"poker face\" and beat it attitude, she doesn't know how to treat frequent customers better. She never once be like \"hey ! I see you coming here a lot ! Here's a little bonus for always coming back\". She's always like, \" you dont like the surcharge ? You got any complains ? Beat it, I can't help you. Once my friend dirtied her floor accidentally with food,  she complained I didn't clean it up for her or informed her to clean it up. Really? It is not my responsibility to keep your restaurant in check.  I don't need this kind of attitude from an owner of a business.  You know what ? Now a cup of tea cost money!! Seriously? A cup of tea! When you are thirsty from the long wait. In this economy, I would rather spend my money else where, cheaper and I am treated way better.\n\nUpdate:\nThis place is just beyond comical now. They have large sign on the bathroom saying, you will be paying to use it if you are not a customer LMAO ! Their water is now bitter lemon peel water ! When you ask for the key to the bathroom, the owner gives you a hell of a time. If you sat down and do not order, you are asked to leave, even though all your friends ordered. They used to be packed with customers to now only several tables at most. Haha I will have the last laugh when this place close down.

I think the kitchen only has 2 people working in there. Someone who's starving and waiting 20+ minutes for their order to come out can be very very aggravating. On top of that, the portion of the food here is pretty small considering the price they charge you. At times, the wait for seats can be very long as well.

We came on a Tuesday night around 8:30pm, and the place had about 3 tables.  We sat ourselves and picked up menus on the empty tables to decide what to order.  Since we had already read the reviews we kind of expected to do a lot of self-service, which was not a problem with us.\n\nAfter spending a good amount of time going through their extensive menu (as we could not decide what to order, so many items!), I settled on the bacon and mushroom spaghetti with ground pork, and ordered an organic sesame soy milk.  Hubby chose the baked seafood spaghetti with a tomato-based sauce, with Mango Medley deluxe as the dessert.\n\nThe food took a long time to come.  It was very delicious, however.  The bacon and mushroom spaghetti had a light, onion-flavored cream sauce, a right size portion to eat in one sitting, with fresh mushrooms and topped with cheese.  The organic sesame soy drink was great as well; the sesame was ground very finely, and not too much sugar, which was to my liking.  Hubby's baked dish took longer to come since it was baked, but it was good as well, with right amount of seafood, light tomato sauce and al dente spaghetti, topped with cheese.\n\nThe Mango Medley deluxe dessert was also pretty good, with many slices of sweet mango.  It's served with a mango slush underneath with bits of coconut jelly.  The slush was very smooth.\n\nOverall, we liked the food there a lot and definitely will go back.

I know places like to give variety, but it's just easier on me if I knew which were the decent options.

But anyway, I visited here twice.\n\n1st time: It was around the time the place first opened, so I think that's why the staff was nice back then, I'm not sure how they are now. I ordered the honey chicken garlic spaghetti (which I think is now discontinued) which I thought was pretty good. The chicken had strong honey flavoring and the noodles were garlicky but not oily. I usually picked out the zucchini, onion, and red pepper because they came in large chunks it felt weird chewing on those at the same time. Since it was a cold night, I had their honey ginger tea which was okay, made my stomachache go away at least.\n\n2nd time: I was nauseated and I really didn't feel like eating but the bf really felt like getting dessert so I brought him here. I just ordered tea and he ordered the red bean soup. We know red bean soup is usually reddish and purple in color, but this particular one came in a faded purple color with black colored beans. WTF? Looked and tasted like it was refrigerated. And since there was like a $3 minimum/person rule and we were 25 cents short, she suggested I order a 50 cent cookie (from the Costco pack). I should have just given her 25 cents for free.\n\nOh yeah, my bf really had to use the bathroom and but couldn't use the one here. Something about the stench and the dirtiness, maybe the last guy couldn't stomach the dessert either. He's gone before in Safeway and gas station bathrooms but said no way to this one.\n\nAnyway, I think the cooked food looks alright to try, they seem to like experimenting.

The chick with the ugly pixie haircut that knows only how to utter phrases such as \"Uh yeah\", \"No\", \"Leave it\", \"What is that?\" has thee worst customer service EVER. Reasons for this are as followed:\n\n#1) My friends and I walked in and the place was empty, but what do you expect it's a weekday around 11pm so I wasn't expecting anything. But  I DID expect to see a waiter or waitress or someone at the cashier --NOPE. We seat ourselves anyways even though it looked like it was closed, but we knew it was open because we had called earlier. I shout for hello a couple of times but STILL no  one is there. We get the menus ourselves and we figure out what we want, and granted that it's our first time there we aren't sure if maybe we're supposed to go up and order? So we do. Finally the short haired chick \"waitress\" comes out of god knows where since the place is so small, and we ask if we order here. She replies \"No.\" Okay this chick is getting on my nerves already for the rude and blunt customer service. MINUS ONE STAR\n\n#2) We seat ourselves yet again and she finally comes and takes our order. I order the mango medley delight. Then my friend orders #24, the \"waitress\" responds by saying \"What is that?\".. UH, how do you not know what is on the menu? And even if you did not know, don't be rude and act dumb.  Are you serious?? Rude service yet again while not knowing about your own work establishment, i.e., the MENU when youre a waiter for pete's sake, are you kidding me?! MINUS ONE STAR\n\n#3) We get our food after about fifteen minutes or so, and my friend receives her spicy tomato fried rice first. Then comes my mango medley delight. I was really excited it came because I was getting a little hungry. I take one bite and I actually like it! Take another one, and it's pretty good! Then BAM! It's not even one strand of black hair, its like THREE OR FOUR TANGLED OR CRUMPLED TOGETHER LIKE A KNOT in the middle of my dessert! At this point, I'm pretty annoyed.  I go up to the counter because obviously if I called for service earlier and she doesn't come, why try again for the third time?! So I go up there, and there she is, in the kitchen with some other lady that I assume is the cook. I wave to her and say \"hello\" she just LOOKS at me and turns her head away continuing to talk to the other lady. UH HELLO?! I shout again, she doesnt even turn her head this time. But a moment later she just comes up to the counter, no response. I tell her there is a piece of hair knot in my dessert and she just goes \"Uh.\" And walks back to the kitchen. I'm standing there like WTF. She comes back and says \"Uh yeah\" and I go... \"Do i leave it here?\" And she goes \"Leave it\". WOW.  MINUS TWO STARS\n\n#4) She comes back a few minutes later, which was obvious to me that she probably just took out the hair and dumped a bunch of mangoes on top. She doesn't even say sorry or ANYTHING to me. And apparently she was snickering while giving it to me. I'm pretty annoyed at that point and I in my normal voice just vent out the horrible customer service and how she probably just gave me the old one. I know she heard me but she doesn't even care. I eat the mangoes on the bottom and don't even finish half of my dessert. I don't even bother leaving any tip because WHAT SERVICE WAS THERE?! She doesn't even come to give us the check when its been an hour and not ONCE does she come check up on us. We just walk up there and my friend tells her we want our checks separately. She mumbles something under her breath, who knows wth she is saying. I was thinking about arguing with her but I had no valid proof that she gave me the old one, just my voice against hers. \n\nMango Medley has got to be the worse asian dessert customer service that I have EVER encountered. I know every other asian dessert place in SF is whatever on the customer service for the most part, but ARE YOU SERIOUS MANGO MEDLEY?! To be frank, where did that knot of TANGLED BLACK HAIR even COME FROM? It was all stringy and black while the waitress had obviously dyed her hair and the cook in the back had brown hair too, SO WHERE DID THE HAIR EVEN COME FROM? \n\nThe food is not bad, don't get me wrong, although the hair is questionable in it's own right. My friends and I could have easily dined & dashed because this chick was seriously ABSENT, and when she was there, she was so rude and dumb. I'm never coming back here, EVER! That little turd, she's lucky that I did NOT go Korean on her ass because I was pretty damn furious. And I'm still thinking right now as I'm writing this review, why I did not fight with her.

The SERVICE is slow and  non existent. I never get a greeting when I come thru the door. Sometimes it takes 10 minutes for the waitress to bring me a menu. Then another 10 minutes to take my order. If you think that is long, wait till your food comes out. I ordered a strawberry jam toast one time and it took 30 minutes for it to come. REALLY? For cooked food, it can take even longer.\n\nThe environment is strange to say the least. Most of the chairs dont match - coming in different shapes, and sizes. The place color scheme is weird. There are artwork paintings and then there is also kid drawings hanging on the same wall. I just don't understand what theme the place is going for. It's like they don't have an identity.\n \nSo why do I keep coming back here? Well, the place is only a couple of blocks from where my parents live and they love it. They also open late. I admit, the quality and taste of the food is superb. The horrible wait time and strange d\u00e9cor is the real turn off.", "author": "Ace C."}

The food was amazing, but the thing that kept it from achieving more than I can give is the waiting period for the food. It was about 20 minutes or so and I was cranky and starving! It's really small and you can fit maybe 15 people, tops! It might just be the fact that I probably went there when there was only two people in the whole restaurant and that's reasonable for the wait time, but I'm judging by my experience for this evening!\n\nMy fiancee and I came here after a long process of deciding where to go for dinner. We ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice and the Chicken Curry Noodles. I was amazed at the quality of both and the portions aren't big, but it was enough. The Kimchi Fried Rice came with a sunny side up egg and beef flank. It's not spicy at all! I definitely recommend this! The Chicken Curry Noodles is essentially Thai Green Curry with noodles. It's a different take on curry and it was surprisingly awesome too! Curry has that sense of spiciness, but it wasn't too spicy (slightly more spicy than the Kimchi Fried Rice to me). \n\nI would come back again, but not when I'm excruciatingly hungry. The wait is definitely not for hungry people or those with little patience. It's a small restaurant too, so everyone can practically hear you. Oh, another important note: BRING CASH!! It's cash only!\n\nAnd another useful note is that tea and napkins are self-serve (so it seems). I can see that since there was only one waiting staff for the evening and one chef in the kitchen.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

I finally found an Asian restaurant that is local who actually cooks the food homemade, MSG free (double plus) and it is organic, which explains the price being high. However, I am very disappointed with their service, never answer their business phone nor having any people skills. How can you run a business (especially where it is located in that type of neighborhood) without any people skills and poor customer service? In the past, I always order my favorite chicken soup there to go and went back there today to see if I can have it to go. I believe the waitress is the owner, tells me they don't take food to go anymore. Given the fact I was standing inside for awhile and was never acknowledge that I was waiting. I understand she is busy with another customer taking down their order, but if you see another customer standing inside your restaurant waiting, at least acknowledge that customer and say you will be with them in a sec or even greet the customer. Every time I go in there, not once do I see her smile or seemed friendly. Finally, when she was done taking down the customer order, she already knew what I wanted and I'm sure she remembers me, since I used to always order the same dish to go. She replies to me, \"we don't take anymore food to go\" and rudely walks away. There was no sign posted anywhere or even outside to say that they don't take food to go anymore. If that is the case, isn't it common sense to advertise that about your business, so customers don't have to waste their time? This wasn't the 1st time something like this occurred. The 2nd time, my boyfriend drove down to this restaurant and try to have food to go, and the same lady gave him the run around and waste his time. First, she told him they only accept cash, which is true because there are signs posted saying that. He goes out of his way and walk to the 7/11 nearby to pull out cash. He comes back in to the restaurant, than that same lady tells him they are out of the food he wanted. Why couldn't she just say that to him in the first place, rather than making him go out of his way to the ATM and pull out cash? Just completely wasted his time. Not only that, there is no customer service skills and just totally unprofessional. If she want to open a restaurant like that, might as well open it in Chinatown instead. Every time I pass by that place, since my favorite organic store and other restaurants are in the same neighborhood, I barely see it get busy in there..and you wonder why?", "author": "Eron C."}

Just the name alone got me excited. A medley of mango delights? Count me in!\n\nThe place was packed with Asian teens that all seemed to be absorbed in their anime and Asian pop magazines. I felt kind of old as I sat down and looked around me. After taking in the menu, I realized Mango Medley offers more than just snacks and desserts. The extensive menu includes vegetarian entrees, noodle dishes, rice dishes, a huge dessert menu and lots of Hong Kong-style drinks. \n\nThe \"cream pillows\" on the dessert menu sounded intriguing. It turns out they are pillow-like mini crepes filled with things like mango, cream, purple yam and adzuki (red bean). True to the name, they were pillow shaped and creamy delicious. \n\nA lot of the items on the dessert menu needed explanation like black sesame paste with glutinous peanut dumplings, fresh mango grass jelly and almond fungus with pear. \n\nThis is definitely a place for people who aren't afraid to try something new and out of their comfort zone.", "author": "Lee H."}

They're not cheap on ingredients either. The dish is filled with shrimp, scallop, salmon, and fish. The baked portuguese spaghetti is cooked in a similar to curry-sauce. \n\nI always finish off the meal with the mango delight dessert, because it is the only dessert that includes mango ice cream. I always choose the panna cotta as the base. It's topped with mango puree and mango slices. \n\nWhen I first started coming here, it was a one woman show. But I believe they've hired some help now.

When eating at a mom n pop cafe place, expectation's of course not very high, but the food we got were all very delicious!\n\nWe had:\n-roti: probably the worst of the bunch.  It's the type of pancake that comes from the frozen packaging in Asian supermarkets.  My family gets that alot and make it when we're lazy, so would not recommend getting it here.  Although the sauce that accompanies the roti is super yum, curry flavor with a spicy kick.  \n-baked seafood rice with tomato sauce: super good, pungent on the garlic flavor, but we all thought it was yummy not overpowering.  It came with shrimp, scallop, salmon, mussel, tilapia.  \n-baked Portuguese spaghetti: almost thai yellow curry style but with strong garlic flavor again, but again, not overpowering, highlights the other flavor quite well.  \n-sesame spinach noodle: very thin and soft noodles, in a basic sesame oil sauce with eggplant and tofu.  Very refreshing, solid\n\nWith the 3 entrees, every time I try one, I feel like that's the best, but as I eat another, that one suddenly reigns supreme.  That must be a good sign right?  And we got their signature dessert to finish it off, it wasn't very impressive.  Surprisingly, I would say come here for dinner if you're in the neighborhood and want something simple to go, but you can get better desserts elsewhere, esp in sunset.   \n--------------\nThey offer such a huge variety of foods, from HK style baked pasta/rice, to thai/indonesian plates like curries and fried rice, they even have Korean pancake, ramen, Vietnamese spring rolls, and roti (the thin crepe like appetizer that everyone and their mama get at Banana Island).  We seriously could not stop staring at the menu for 30 minutes, just admiring each picture, booked our next dinner date because we MUST try this place.  \n\nThe desserts were ok, I had the panna cotta with mango  and its pure.  It's actually like a soft yogurt custard, sorta weird.   The ambiance resembles the perfect cozy neighborhood spot.  One thing though, it seems like a 1 person team, the service is EXTREMELY slow.  We only ordered 4 desserts, none of which requires real cooking, but it still took her at least 30 min. to bring it out.  But for such a small place, I'll overlook that for now, and dream about the explosion of flavors in my mouth when I actually eat here.", "author": "Christina D."}

Me and my other friend ordered two different things and when they came it looked and tasted pretty much the same.  The dessert was mediocre, mango bliss (rather go to golden island).  Overall, the meal took us maybe a hour and forty five minutes, because the service was so bad (we got one dish at a time 5 minutes apart).

Shortly after this lady comes out and starts clearing the table.  (Mind you, nobody has acknowledged that we've come in.)  So as she's cleaning one of the tables I decided to go up to her and ask her  a question since I was confused about how we were to order since it's been a really long time since I've been there.  \n\nSo I got up to the lady and stand in front of her.  I know she sees my presence but she continues to clean.  After about ten seconds of just standing and doing nothing, I decided to interrupt her.  I said, \"Excuse me miss...  I'm sorry to bother you...\"  And her response was a huge sigh as she slowly stopped what she was doing and finally looked up at me with a nod and bulging condescending eyes as if to say \"YESSSS??\"   What a BIATCH!!!!  At that point I should of just said never mind and left but my friend was back visiting and she likes the restaurant.  So I asked her still politely if we were supposed to order in front or if someone will come by to serve us.  Her response was \"Well I'm BUSY cleaning right now.  Once I'm done I can come and take your order.\"  \n\nI've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before!  Least to say we didn't stay.

We seated ourselves since there was no greeting which is not a problem. Then the nightmare begins,  We waited 20 minutes before kindly asking if we can get our drinks.  The chinese short lady with the short hair that looks like a boy replies.  \"I'm too busy I have so many ppl I'm waiting on and you just seated yourselves\"  errrr what??? its my fault for seating ourselves when the place was open and no greeting??  Why bother being open for business if your going treat your customers this way.  \n\nHappy Hour menu: prices are reasonable on the menu but here's the problem.  The short chinese boyish looking lady doesnt think that way mentally. She writes down on the menu roti: $4.95 but mentally she's saying my dish is worth $8.  Why is that? Well here's the catch...if your bill comes out to $13.  She will not come by to pick up the $20 bill you left because she doesnt want to give you the change back.   I had to go up to the register and ask for change and she would give you this  horrendous attitude that \"what I have to give you change back?!\"    Yes I want my change back! You expect me to give $7 in tips for this despicable attitude and took 50 minutes for the food to arrive at our table????  If you ever decide to come here make sure you carry $50 bills or $100 bills, that way you can \"actually\" justify getting your change back...pathethic isnt it?\n\nI'm definitly going to be advertising about this place to many many friends to \"NOT\" come here ever!!!!  I'm sure that short boyish looking chinese waitress/owner is pissed off that I've exposed how this place really is!

Well, thats what happened to my girlfriends and I at Mango Medley. We came here on a Friday night. From reading the Yelp reviews, I already expected slow service so no suprise there. However, there were only about 4 other patrons there at the time. 2 uncleaned tables, 1 of which still had money and tips on it. We seated ourselves on one of the dirty tables, hoping that the server can come and take away the plates. We sat there for a good 15 minutes. No one walked out from the kitchen. No greeting. Zip. Zelch. Nada. \nFinally, a lady emerges from the kitchen and approached the bigger party to see what else they wanted. She then walked over to the dirty table and took the dishes. She walked by us without acknowledging us at all. My friend flagged her down and asked her, nicely, \"Excuse me, can you take these dishes away?\". She said to my friend, \"Why do you guys have to sit here? Why can't you sit at the other table that I'm cleaning? If you guys are adamant about sitting at this table, then you'll have to wait until I clean the other table.\" With that said, she walked away. \nI'm not one to tolerate that type of service. First of all - we were sitting at a small 4-person table. She was cleaning a big 8-person table. All she had to do was pick up the dirty plates (and money!) on our table. Second of all - her attitude stinks like the towel she was holding in her hands. \nWe got up and left, and we will never be returning.", "author": "Nancie T."}

I recommend coming here for dessert especially if you like mangoes. Their mangoes are fresh and they have tasty dessert choices. I also looked at their regular food menu but haven't tried it yet(looks interesting). If you come here, treat it like a home. You have to grab your own tea and water which I don't mind because its not like they charge you up the ass for food anyway, besides I don't expect much from chinese dessert houses because service is about the same. I like the idea of self serve tea, because I drink a lot, so I don't have to feel like I'm annoying the shit out of a server. Overall, I will be back, mainly for dessert.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-31", "description": "I've been coming here for the last 2 years - at one point, I was coming here about once a week because the food is so good! Sure, the wait sucks (I've waited more than an hour for my order on a couple of occasions) and Eugenie may not be the friendliest waitress (she's a busy lady - just know what you want to order so you don't keep her waiting), but just know and accept that going in - the food is totally worth it! EVERYTHING I've ordered here is tasty and amazing, and I've tried almost half the menu. Tons of vegetarian options! The only thing I didn't like was the eggplant sandwich - the bread was overtoasted and too hard. Here are my recommendations (sorry, I'm a pescetarian, so no meat suggestions):\n\nAppetizers:\n1) Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls - so fresh and delicious! Shrimp is tender and not chewy.\n2) Seaweed Salad with Tobiko - so good! Wakame, lettuce, tobiko, miso dressing, and sesame seeds - pretty standard but done right.\n2) Vietnamese Spring Rolls (Vegetarian) - yummy veggie alternative to the shrimp ones (tofu and shitake mushrooms instead of shrimp).\n\nEntrees:\n1) Ramen with Mixed Mushrooms in Soy Broth - the best I ever had! Even better than Japantown. Fresh, crisp veggies and a variety of mushrooms. Broth is tasty and noodles are perfectly done.\n2) Spinach Noodles with Tofu and Mixed Mushrooms - my old standby. Flavorful and filling.\n3) Rice Wine Tofu and Mushrooms over Rice - great light dish if you aren't that hungry. So very tasty!\n4) Tamarind Tofu and Veggies over Rice - my bf's favorite! Lots of flavor and just the right amount of spiciness.\n5) Garlic Basil Linguine with White Wine Sake Sauce - So yummy! If you need a garlic fix, this is for you!\n\nDesserts:\n1) Panne Cotta with Fruit Sauce - light, refreshing, and delish!\n2) Mango Crepes (I think they are called mango pillows) - yummy! Pretty simple dish - ripe mangoes, whip cream, crepes - but oh so good!\n3) Mango Bliss (buttermilk panna cotta and mango sorbet version) - tasty, refreshing, and fruity - a must if you love mangoes.\n\nDrinks:\n1) Hot Ginger Honey - my usual order, a definite must on a cold, foggy day/night. Fresh pressed ginger juice, water, and honey - oh so good for you!\n2) Hot Milk Green Tea with Soy Milk - my go-to drink of choice if it weren't for the calories. Yummy milky goodness!\n3) Hot Chai Latte - so tasty! Maybe not as authentic as the chai tea at Golden Gate Pizza and Indian Cuisine down the street, but still a tasty blend of spices and milk.\n\nThe parking sucks, as are the wait and service (hence the minus 1 star), but as I said before - THE FOOD IS WORTH IT!!!!

The food was ok, it was definitely an interesting taste, not like the other baked Portuguese at Macau and Friends.  It wasn't too creamy, but not like watered down spaghetti sauce.

I have not got this pillow skin long time. Bring me some good memory. The only thing i don't like is the service is VERY SLOW and we need to get the water by ourselves. Anyway, will go again when i have 3 hours for a meal.", "author": "Michelle Z."}

Prices are reasonable and everything we ordered was good and you can tell they use good/fresh ingredients. Just to warn you though.. it's a small place and they only have few people working there so depends on when you go you might have to wait for your food. They do have great magazines and great music playing so we didn't mind waiting and just hanging out. \nWe went 2 times while visiting SF and here are what we ordered. \n-Seafood bake dish wok fried rice--- this is the best seafood bake HK style I have ever had!!! there were good amt of fresh shrimp, scallops, fish and veggie and the fried rice was sooooo good with the sake cream sauce. \n-kimchi fried rice- very good with good amt of kimchi and taste- trust me.. I have eaten lots of kimchi fried rice (I am korean! :)\n-steak platter- my hubby loved the steak which was so tender and tasty\n-ramen with grilled chicken thigh - oh it was sooooo good. i thought it was way better than ramen i paid $12 in japantown. Mango medley's was only $6.95 wtih a drink!!!  what a steal \n-seafood with spinach linguine!!!- very good tomato sauce and again lots of fresh seafood. \n- my favorite drink was the white chocolate whipped coffee\n- green tea ice cream was delicious and mango pillow was to die for.... \n\nI wish seattle had a mango medley. Cute, comfortable place with good food and drinks... I can't wait to come back to SF and eat again at MM!!!", "author": "Shy z."}

Yeah, I've tried to eat there several times and everytime I've gone its like I'm invisible. I mean, what do you have to do to get someone to take your order besides reminding the waitress and staff numerous times? The last time I went (because I wanted to give them another shot) the place was messy and crowded. They had this one table that looked like someone's office, papers and junk everywhere. It was a definite turn-off. I say, \"Don't believe the hype...\"", "author": "Marilyn W."}

I love the waitress. It's always the same one, i think she might be the owner too. She pulls no punches. If she doesn't think you will like something you are ordering she will tell you, I like people like that. I aways go there alone and sit by the window and bring a nice book to read while i wait for my meal. The food is always worth the wait, especially their desserts. Their sticky rice with Mango is to die for.  Best thing yet, your wallet wont have to go hungry, at all.", "author": "Dios L."}

I would give it a 5 star rating, but slow service, i have to take a star away. my hubby ordered the chicken fettuccine with garlic and basil.....tasted very good, it's like a party in my mouth. the cream sauce is just right, the flavor has different layers..... worth coming if you are not in a rush!", "author": "L L."}

We ordered three small dishes a dessert and an iced Jasmine Tea drink.  The food was very flavorful and very different from most things we tasted. The dessert--banana puffs was very simple yet delicious. The Jasmine frappuccino exceeded my expectations, I can honestly say that it was the best green tea frappuccino I have ever had! Other than the mediocre service, it was a great experience.", "author": "Alina O."}

They make every dish individually and I like that, very home-cooked and thoughtful in taste, never flat. I love the linguine, and the spinach noodle. Never really had their desserts, but everything else is pretty good. Good and consistent, save bet; just don't go there if you are very very hungry and demand food NOW.", "author": "Lulu M."}

The food was wonderful and it captured a bit of the old spirit of the Sunset near the beach.  In fact, this little block of Judah is an awesome casual spot for a weekend brunch / lunch\n\nYes it is small and the idea is to hang out while you wait for the one waitress - who might be cooking as well.  No matter - fire up your laptop or read a magazine.  I had a curry noodle dish that was absolutely delicious and homemade.  The menu has all types of noodles including some italian dishes and tons of Asian fusion ones.", "author": "K O."}

In this little charming restaurant you can experience the art of cooking in a direct, unpretentious, totally down to earth and honest way. Every dish is created by the two owners who are inspired by various Asian cuisines as well as a great love for culinary originality. If you are looking for freshly made, gourmet quality, low price dishes with the best ingredients that make your eyes, tongue and palate gow WOW, Mango Medley is the place to go!!!!! It's only a few blocks from Ocean Beach, right on the N-Line. And if you are craving a hot, delicious, totally chocolaty not too sweet Mocha, you will also find it here. You can sit at Mango Medley for hours chatting with friends, spending the afternoon. Yes, the service is not the fastest, due to the fact that two women run everything alone, which keeps the prices so affordable, but if you keep in mind that the food is actually being prepared from scratch while you wait, you just bring an interesting conversation topic or a good book.", "author": "Ursula S."}

Yes I know their service somewhat slow, but the food is pretty good.  I think my favorite is the mango pockets...sounds like the wrong name but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about...it's the mangos in crepe skin with cream.  I didn't think the ice cream one was as good cuz I got mixed up and ordered it wrong once so i got to try it....but hey, if ice cream is your forte then go right on ahead and order this.  They've got a happy hour during lunch and late night I think and you can order cheaper items from the menu.  I took my vegetarian friend here and she was pretty content.  And yes...self serve for things like utensils and tea.   Atleast you don't have to wait for that.  Setting is pretty simple and cute with overpriced paintings and photos on the wall...(i really don't think anyone will pay 100 bucks for a chicken painting.)  Milk tea is good too...have yet to try other drinks...if you guys wanna came here faster, drive down sunset instead of 19th avenue.", "author": "LittleBird 8."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-19", "description": "Nice selection on the menu (though the photos are kinda blurry), and I love that they have coffee drinks with Asian snacky snacks. The decor is Ikea cozy, but the bathroom is lit by a dim purple light, which sets a great mood....if it weren't in the bathroom. The roti was pretty good, and the Korean pancakes were yummy too (but my friend thought they were too potato-ey? hah). I had the shrimp and spinach noodles, and even though it looked like they were in plain ol' marinara sauce, it's a tomato sauce with basil and possibly fish sauce, which I suppose makes it \"Asian fusion\" to some extent. They had a lot of veggie (and even some vegan) options too. The one pitfall of this place is the service. I don't know if we caught the waitress on a bad day or what, but she didn't smile the entire time we were there. We brought in a dessert to eat afterward and almost weren't allowed to eat it (even though we had ordered appetizers, drinks, and a meal!). It's still worth checking out though.", "author": "Tami H."}
