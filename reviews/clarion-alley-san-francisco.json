I don't know how lot of these murals are still intact (not defaced or anything) after a few years of being painted!\n\nOverall cool art with predictable political messages embedded. A good place to get the exact same photos that a thousand other people have for your Instagram. If you're a tourist, go for it. If you're from the Bay, I'd personally recommend trying to be a little more creative and capturing other parts of the city that haven't been done over and over and over again.

The city has lots of murals scattered around but this is the place to go to get the most bang for your (Instagram) buck! It's a long alley completely covered with amazing murals from all different artists. My boyfriend and I stopped here on a tour we were on and I was able to snap photos of many of the murals.\n\nA lot of the murals in Clarion Alley have a political theme to them, which can make for a great conversation starter. I am not sure how often the murals change, but the ones we saw were all incredible with the level of detail and artistry. It would be fun to go back in the future and see which ones have changed. I wish I knew who the artists were so I could look them up and tag them on my posts. When we were there it wasn't crowded at all but I imagine it could be busy at times. I was really glad we got to stop here and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys art, social commentary, and thought-provoking material.", "author": "Katy C."}

Several friends that really know what I like highly suggested I check it out, but it ended up paling in comparison to street art I've encountered in places like LA and NY.\n\nMuch of the work at Clarion Alley was too amateurish and devoid of compelling features. The political \"art\" largely lacked substance and seemed more like a parody of someone trying to make a profound point, thereby trivializing the issue they intended to spotlight. Not everything was a complete miss though - there were a couple of unicorns.\n\nI will acknowledge that just about any public art is subject to a short shelf life due to others constantly painting over things, so it's possible I \"caught them on an off day\" and there will be better stuff if you go in the future. And it's possible that those that gave it 4 and 5 stars walked into an alley that looked a lot different than the run-down one I was at in early August of 2017. \n\nTo give a place 2 stars when you're not even paying money though, that says a lot.", "author": "Brandon C."}

Clarion Alley kept appearing in my searches, so my friend and I drove up to the city to check it out. \n\nLike any alley way, Clarion was a little difficult to find unless you know exactly where it is. I decided to park nearby where our maps located the alley. Walking made it much easier to find it. There was plenty of meter parking on the street. A lot of other alleys have artwork near the area as well so it might help to park in the center of where you want to go and walk around the mission district on a beautiful day. \n\nI can't remember how many murals there were because they were all interesting.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-07", "description": "The hodgepodge of colorful, often provocative art has been on the walls since 1992 under the guidance of the Clarion Alley Mural Project, a group of volunteer street artists that have ensured a forum for free expression on an open canvas of fences, garage doors, and building exteriors in this one-block alley between 17th and 18th Streets spanning Mission and Valencia Streets. The best time to come to the alley is during an event like Sunday Streets or the Summer of Love Festival where they close off Valencia Street.\n\nThis allows people to flow freely into the alley to admire the over fifty rotating works on display. On my most recent visit during Sunday Streets on Valencia, there was a salsa band playing near the entrance (photo: http://bit.ly/2obqulE) with more avant-garde characters deeper in the alley (photo: http://bit.ly/2nNfEi4). I believe I was watching artist Mel Waters put the finishing touches on his painting, Ghost Ship (photo: http://bit.ly/2nURPWp), though his most memorable work is a profile portrait of Prince painted just after his death (photo: http://bit.ly/2oOsscA).\n\nThere are, of course, more politically charged statements like Stop the Corporatocracy (photo: http://bit.ly/2o83VfT) and Tax the Rich (photo: http://bit.ly/2oSq5ma). Several are colorful renderings of the immediate neighborhood (photo: http://bit.ly/2nNe7Zt) or celebrations of local heroes like tattooist Dean Dennis (photo: http://bit.ly/2oStEsv).

Everything was just so big and vibrant! \n\nI really had never even known about Clarion Alley before Yelp, so thank goodness for Yelp because strolling down Clarion Alley really helped make my last San Fran trip that much more memorable! It's an unusual and stunning sight to see so I highly recommend checking this kaleidoscopic backstreet out.\n\nThe only downside to this was, well you know, it's San Fran so good luck finding parking but besides that it was awesome and I loved it!

We strolled through the alleyway, stopping to admire the beautiful, creative, unique, and colourfully painted murals. The street art was interesting, diverse and incredibly detailed and intricate. The photo opportunities were fantastic! The building walls on both sides of the alley were completely covered in murals. Many of the murals displayed thought-provoking quotes, political messages/statements and support for certain causes, which beautifully highlighted our freedom of speech and expression.\n\nThere were a few homeless people in the alley, but their presence did not make me feel uncomfortable, and they were either sleeping underneath tarps and blankets or sitting up against the buildings. My mother and I started chatting with one very sweet-natured homeless woman who told us her life story. It was quite humbling and inspiring to hear about her positive outlook/perspective on life, despite her circumstances. After our conversation, we gave her some money so that she could buy herself an ice cream, which she mentioned was something that she was desiring to eat. I enjoyed being able to connect with this local woman and share a laugh and a conversation.\n\nThe alleyway was not super clean and there were broken and empty alcohol bottles laying on the ground as well as some garbage, but I enjoyed the grunginess of the alley and the stories and character that it portrayed/told.

There we met up with a tour guide. This is where the real adventure begins, some may not agree, this district seemed like the soul of the city. And boy it was sure a beauty, murals galore displayed all over the neighborhood.\n\nOne alley that spoke the loudest among others was Clarion Alley. The art pieces were vivid and symbolic. The common theme was gentrification, these murals did not hold back and touch everyone differently. Even had the luck of being yelled at by a local and be accused for being part of gentrification. Don't worry, the guy was harmless, it does show you how sensitive topic it is.\n\nThere are a couple of other mural allies but out of all of them, this one has the strongest presence.

Even the tagging can be pretty neat -- there was stenciled graffiti on the ground shaped like squid and tall ships and Frida Kahlo. \n\nWith how often the walls get repainted with new murals added every few months, it's like going through a gallery with an ever-changing collection. It's all the more motivation to get over there to see a piece before it's gone.", "author": "Christine A."}

Ruggy J. explained it perfectly - there is a clear difference between graffiti and tagging and what you get to experience here at Clarion Alley (for the most part - some of the pieces are vandalized over, unfortunately), is the former.

I'm sadden by the fact that people don't realize how much time and effort it takes for an artist to do what they do. Then there's people who tags over them. Such a waste of great art. Overall the art work was amazing to look at and admire. It's a shame that it was so short. I wished the alley was longer. \n\nParking is a huge PAIN! Finding this alley is also a huge PAIN! Its like neatly tucked away where youll have a pretty hard time locating the street sign. Luckily when my bf and I was driving around i decided to read reviews again cause we were about to give up. ****[its between 17th & 18th street & mission & Valencia]****. We finally just decided to find parking and search my foot.\n\nIm not giving this alley 5 stars because its pretty short. There wasn't totally a lot of art work to admire due to the tagging/graffiti . At most it'll take you a good ten minutes. It took us at least 30+mins to find parking and the alley itself. We saw a small group of people hanging out so it made it even more difficult to admire the artwork. Since they are blocking our views. \n\nFYI: There's actually people who live on this street and upstairs on the buildings/walls. Bring coins for the meters. The area is a little ghetto.

The murals are excellent and really spruce up the whole vibe of the area. \n\nBad: On most nights there are random people that flood the place with good cheer and by good cheer I mean drugs, sex, drinking and urination. Fist fights and people rummaging through the recycle bins at 4 AM. will put damper on your sleep, but you get used to it. It kinda becomes like one of those wave radios that lulls you to sleep with the sounds of the ocean.

Doesn't get out much, so I set up some regression therapy comprising drinking, playing Xbox 360, eating, and more drinking. On the fringes of this brutal regimen, I tried to ensure that he got some culture.\n\nClarion Alley was the last stop on an afternoon walk we'd taken from my apartment in Twin Peaks which included Dolores Park, lunch at Tartine, X21, Borderlands Bookstore ( sigh - no Ripley), and the Pirate Store. It was a beautiful day, and the alleyway was crowded with people checking out some new work on the walls. As we sauntered East toward Mission, I noticed some furtive movement on the right side of the alley about 25 yards in front of us. There was a guy pressed up against the fence, slightly stooped, looking for all the world like he was either stuck to, or merging with, the boards.\n\nTurns out both were true. There was a little hole in the fence that he was trying to cram 'himself' into.\n\nNow I have seen a lot of things in my 43 years on this planet. But I have never seen anyone work so desparately to achieve carnal bliss with a FENCE in broad daylight, and with an audience. \n\nI mean -- there is just no protocol that I know of that provides any helpful guidance on dealing with a situation like this. It's a bit of a conversation killer.\n\nSo we walked along in silence, both appalled and maybe a little amused, and tried to give this guy his privacy. However our friend -- let's just call him Woody Woodpecker -- wasn't having ANY of that . I guess he hadn't quite worked that knot out of the wood (if you know what I'm saying), because he stopped in mid-saw and began to berate us for, all jokes aside, \"interrupting my nut\". He yanked his pants up and strode purposefully up Balmy Street in the direction of the Mission police station.\n\nAh, San Francisco, city of art and culture. And carpentry!\n\nWe were glad to get back to the relative calm and sanity of the Castro.", "author": "Karsten P."}
