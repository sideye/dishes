If you've ever been in this particular part of San Francisco then you know it's not exactly packed with places to eat.\n\nRight away, I was drawn in by the sports pub ambiance;  warm, friendly, full of locals, tattered memorabilia, a pool table, and teeny tiny restrooms.   It was a definite working class feel- empty Hamm's cans and all.\n\nThe food was nothing foo-foo or exotic; just your typical bar food served fast and hot.  I had the Italian dip, vinegar and salt fries, and a half pint of Belgian style ale.  Very tasty and filling.  \n\nThe wait staff seem to genuinely enjoy working with one another (or else they are just good at faking it) and that contributed a lot to the convivial atmosphere.  When I am back in Potrero Hill, I will definitely stop in again.", "author": "Tammy D."}

Since it's just blocks away from daughter K apartment and were early for the Giants game I decided to pre game and get some drinks. The bar was full but managed to get the last barstool at the end of the bar. The bartender quickly took my order of Crown Royal and a bowl of New England Clam Chowder. There are tons of beer specials and it's dog friendly. Their clam chowder is good with lots of clams. The bar is a nice friendly vibe and a long history of being a drinking establishment in San Francisco which is documented on the back of their menu. Being a part of Red Sox nation and them having the best record in the MLB this year, it was important for me to find a Boston sports bar to watch the 2018 playoff run.", "author": "George F."}

I have so many favorites here so I'll just get into it.\n\nFirst is probably the green chile mac--add some hot sauce to it and it's that perfect combination of cheesy/creamy and spicy goodness. I also love their entire brunch menu. Particularly, they used to have this breakfast bowl thing where it would come with fresh fruit and homemade cinnamon toast crunch croutons! Honestly, that dish made me fall in love with brunch as a concept. Their breakfast sandwiches are great too, and I don't even usually like sausage. In terms of cocktails, I like their Irish coffee. Last time I ordered it, it came with actual coffee ice cubes, which I thought was a nice touch.", "author": "Claire C."}

The bartenders were grouchy, the tables a bit sticky, and the food was good bar food.  The outdoor seating area was a great place to enjoy the sunniest neighborhood in San Francisco.\n\nA few years ago they revamped the menu (and perhaps ownership), and I am continuously amazed at how delicious every item I've had there is, time after time.  The chef and cooking staff clearly care about every little bite and detail, from garnish to main dish.  The items range from the classic burgers they've always had (though updated) to newer things like Tofu tacos - and every recipe reflects that same attention to detail.  My go-to is the fried chicken sandwich, though the Goddess Salad with chicken is also great.\n\nThis place is worth not only a visit but also a regular patronage.

Just from the outside I was impressed - while it looked like a great neighborhood bar, the outdoor patio was gorgeous. My friends definitely had a solid neighborhood spot.\n\nSo after some hanging out and day drinking, we decided to hit it up. I got some flack for my hat but no sense that they messed with me or my food. They have the bar in the front, plenty of table seating for groups or families, even a pool table in the back. The loud guests and New England memorabilia made me know this was a legit Boston Bar. \n\nSpeaking of the bar, they have a solid beer selection as well as cocktails. They also let you sample before ordering. I ended up getting an Imperial Red, but they had lighter beers like a gose, and darker to a stout. \n\nNext up is the rotating menu - some items have changed with the relatively new owners, the Pour Guys. A lot sounds delicious and I went with some basics:\n\nNew England Clam Chowder - while not as thick as my preference, the soup was flavorful but best about it was the amount of clams! Nearly every spoonful came out full of clams. Can't beat that!\n\nYankee Burger - after all the drinking, needed some protein. While I love a provolone burger, the bacon leek fixing sounded awesome, as did the aioli. I got mine Rare but next time would go medium rare, but the burger was juicy and full of flavor. The plentiful fries sopped up much of the juice.\n\nI would gladly come back, but probably not during football Sundays.", "author": "Michael C."}

My friends and I have been LOVING the new menu. We dance at the Metronome around the corner, and this has become one of our go-tos for a drink and some bites after class. And my doggie loves the patio. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars: One or two recent games days, when the place really packed, service became chaotic... Food and drinks came very slowly, our server was dropping curse words right and left, we could hear her screaming in the kitchen from our table, and drink runners and bussers were visibly harried. With better staffing for major sporting events, I'd give it 5 stars!", "author": "Carolyn B."}

I've always found it hard to find other Boston loyalists in the bay and finally hit the city of gold.

I recommend their half rack of ribs, which comes with mac-n-cheese! 5/5 stars for taste and flavor!! Meat falls off the bone, and is cooked perfectly. I also tried the Cobb salad and cheeseburger, which are both pretty good. For the salad, they used a zesty lemon dressing, and include bacon, tomatoes, avocado, and cheese. Chicken or steak can be added with extra cost. The cheeseburger was okay, nothing crazy, but I didn't try their specialty burgers. They have a bim-bop burger and a fried chicken burger. \nThe place is very relaxing and laid back. Customers can seat yourself and the menus already at the tables. There is a bar at the front, pool table in the back, and small outdoor seating area too. Service is good, but can take longer when busy.

As you may know blueberry pancakes are a religion in Maine so if you bring someone from Ogunquit you gotta get those right. Aunt says they are right if the blueberries are coated in flour before they are put in the batter. Looks like that trick might have been taught at the Yankee. My mother ordered the spaghetti and she was really happy with the straightforward meal and enough food on the plate to justify the price. I really enjoyed the clean white dishware. Made the meals very appealing. \n\nI would stay away from the Arnold Palmer unless you are a fan of Crystal Light. Maybe a Shandy would have covered up the saccharine taste but ice tea couldn't do much. Might have to work on that because usually any woman who orders an Arnold Palmer when everyone else is ordering a Bloody Mary is giving a tip off that she has a bun in the oven. \n\nAll in all, the Yankee put my Aunt in a good enough mood so she would come with us to a National League Park at ATT.

I  found it to be more of a dive bar (an abused term in San Francisco where any neighborhood tavern that hasn't been redecorated since the seventies is called one).   I went in for beer, saw there was a kitchen, and when I was told that the calamari was fresh (not frozen) ordered some.  Damned good calamari.  The breaded fries were better than In N Out, but that's not saying very much as In N Out's undercooked fries are as bad as their burgers are good.  Mostly the fries here tasted like an vehicle for cooking oil delivery.\n\nThen, someone came up to pay for their negroni.  Negroni?   I would NEVER order a Negroni in a neighborhood bar---even good restaurants often don't make a good one.  So I ordered one...\n\nIt seems that the key to success with a drink built from an equal measure of three ingredients is to MEASURE the damn ingredients.  Which the bartender here did, and the result was that sublime flavor that delights the senses.  It turns out that square ice blocks or toasted orange peel isn't what makes it.  This was a fine Negroni (unlike the one I had afterwards, on Polk street, where the bartender poured the campari without measuring it [measuring the gin and vermouth only] and which, thus unbalanced, fell short of sublime).\n\nThe crowd, unlike Blooms up the hill, seemed to be something other than local (from the neighborhood), but I'm not sure about that.  Blooms' crowd had a distinctly working class feel (was that an accurate assessment on my part?) while the folks here had a more white collar feel---rather odd given the dive-y atmosphere.  It seems both folks live on the hill as boutiqued houses seem to be balanced by quite a large number of original structures under faded or peeling paint.  I don't seem to fit in anywhere I go, so nothing seemed out of place to me, and the staff was quite useful and friendly.\n\nI'd go back.  I'll have the calamari over the fries.

We decided on Connecticut Yankee because of it's close proximity to work and within walking distance. Service for the most part was friendly. \n\nFast forward to a week later and I happen to be going over my credit card statement. I notice the charge is $2 more than what I know I wrote down for the final charge. Yes, I bet you're thinking \"This girl is raging over a $2 overcharge?\" YES. YES I AM. Because of the principle that I TIPPED GREAT and they had the nerve to take advantage of my kindness and add MORE money to the final charge. On a bill that totaled $97.XX (before tip), I was too buzzed to do that math and know for a fact I wrote a final charge for $120 compared to my statement that says $122.  (that's a $22+ tip on a ~$98 bill) Of course I disputed this charge with my bank, and when I called and asked how it would be credited back to my account, the representative told me that the bank would most likely just reimburse the amount because it's so small. It upsets me that this bar is going to get away with taking advantage of my kindness. \n\nAnd what pisses me off more now with this revelation is that while I was closing my tab, I noticed they overcharged me by one shot of Jameson. (I purchased 2 but they charged me for 3) I didn't make a huge stink about it and didn't bother to dispute the charge. NOW I WISH I HAD. \n\nThis could have been a great after-work bar that I would have visited more frequently, but not after this dishonesty.", "author": "Jenna H."}

I pride myself on being polite to servers as I was one in a prior life, but this particular server made every food and drink request appear to be a chore and inconvenience.

The menu is as fantastic as ever (with some great new changes), their sangria is off the charts, and we had a wonderful dining experience and fun time as always. Last but not least, all of the authentic, original MLB memorabilia (original Babe Ruth batting lineup sheet, anyone?) has been moved from the original cramped, dark entranceway to a large wall inside the restaurant, showcasing it in all its glory as it deserves to be.  It is refreshing to see a new ownership come into a historic place and desire to not only retain but enhance the rich and beautiful history of a landmark San Francisco location.  \"Bob, the Waiter\" who has been a steadfast fixture for years remains as upbeat, festive and \"saucy\" as ever.

It's a cute little spot with a very chill and laid-back vibe; nobody is in any particular rush...which can be a good and bad thing.\n\nI only had drinks but it looked like they had a decent pub menu. The drinks were relatively cheap (beers for $4.50). The large back room is great for a big group, and there's also a back patio. I was there at night, so I didn't head out to the patio but any place that has outdoor seating is great.\n\nWhen I was there on a Saturday night, it was pretty quiet; seems like the kind of place you would go to have a beer with a pal or to maybe watch games (a number of TVs around the bar).\n\nGenerally, it's a fine place though there's nothing that particularly stands out about the spot.", "author": "Wendy L."}

I loved the outside patio (although you cant smoke) This location is in a warmer part of the city so the sun was abundant!! Between all of us we tried several dishes. The pork Sandwich was good (not to dry or saucy). The Wings were ok, but i have a thing about wings tasting like Tabasco. The chicken strips were more fried in a Panko, and was very good, but kinda small. The taco salad was order and it was LARGE(worth the money). Other salads were order and all were good size and flavor. \n\nThere was a Margarita that everyone keep ordering of the special drink menu, they were done nicely. I will say that I ordered the Bloody Mary, and hated it. It was too peppery, too spicy, not enough vodka and frankly a disappointment.\n\nALL-N-ALL: I would go back, great for large parties, food was de-lish and not too expensive, and the Patio in itself was worth the trip!!", "author": "Heather P."}

It has history and a nice outdoor dining area in a part of town without a lot of other similar choices.  I work nearby so I've been there several times for lunch.\n\nThe food is OK, if somewhat greasy.  The \"S\" sauce (ask for if not at your table) is pretty decent and a welcome change from the usual condiment options. The salads are kinda on the large size, the burgers and other sandwiches on the smaller side.  The fries are pretty good. \n\nThe service, however, is dismal and the main reason we don't go there for lunch unless we are absolutely sick of everything in the area and don't want to drive.  Nearly every time we've been there someone in our group gets snapped at by a waiter for what we think is a fairly trivial (if any!) offense.   Or we get forgotten for a half hour.  If we ask for an extra fork or something you'd think we just asked them to swim to china to get a new one for us.\n\nI've been working in the area for over three years now and we buckle down and go there about once every six months thinking, surely the service is better now.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-29", "description": "I have a friend who lives a few doors down from Connecticut Yankee.  I have parked directly across from the bar on numerous occasions, and I have always enjoyed pretending not to peek at the patrons seated on the patio.  Still, I never had a reason to drop by and check it out for myself.\n\nHowever, last weekend the four of us had a minor dilemma: we wanted to watch the Cal/Stanford game and the Oregon/Arizona game at the same time.  What turned out to be the biggest problem of them all, the Cal/Stanford game was on Versus, the exclusive, elusive channel available only to Comcast subscribers.  Following an all-out Yelp/iPhone offensive and what could only be described as a sports bar scavenger hunt throughout San Francisco, we found ourselves at Connecticut Yankee.  Yep, we visited three sports bars in SoMa, 2 sports bars in North Beach and called a dozen more only to end up 1/4 of a block away from where we started.  If only I were kidding.\n\nBy the time we settled in for an evening of Pac-10 football, we were tired, annoyed and hungry.  We didn't even care that the Cal game was on a big TV that was far from our table, and the Oregon game was on a smaller TV perched atop the bar.  We were watching two games, and the food was on the way.\n\nIt's a good neighborhood bar with friendly service and decent food options.  As a Yankees fan, I found it a bit difficult to ignore the \"vote for Papi\" stickers and the framed newspaper article entitled \"FINALLY!\"  I knew it was a Red Sox bar, and I can respect that. You probably won't see me watching baseball games here, however.  To be fair, they did have a photo of Babe Ruth in Yankees uniform, as well as a beautiful photo of Mr. Steinbrenner, Reggie Jackson and Thurman Munson.  Not bad for a New England bar.\n\nDriving all over San Francisco left us downright famished.  While my friends opted for the Wade Boggs (chicken breast, of course), I was on a mission to find something that did not have a cute Red Sox name.  Enter Saturday Special: prime rib dinner for $19.  I complemented it with a green salad with vinaigrette for $5 more.  The prime rib dinner was surprisingly good.  Granted, my expectations were really low, but the prime rib was much better than expected.  It was at least a 20-oz piece of prime rib, served almost medium rare.  It wasn't \"steakhouse quality,\" but it wasn't \"bar quality\" either.  I finished all of it, along with the mashed potatoes and string beans.\n\nA couple of hours later, I ordered a brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  I would advise you to skip this, since this dessert had more sugar and fat than flavor.  For $5.50 it was also not a good value.\n\nWe left the bar right after the games ended.  At about 8:30, some band began preparing the stage for their 9 pm performance, and the lead singer was blocking our view at times.  Can't speak to the quality of the music, but I am sure it was quite wonderful.\n\nGiven the proximity to my friend's house, easy parking, numerous food options and a nice patio, I could definitely see myself going back to Connecticut Yankee again and again.  I promise to leave my Yankees hat in the car.", "author": "Yan G."}

Have you no decency, or just no sense of smell and an amazing ability to control your gag reflex??!\" But mostly I just wanted to get out of there, ASAP- the 2 guys with me even reacted the same way, so I know it wasn't just my amazing female sense of smell picking this up.

The lunch left us feeling very underwhelmed to say the least.\n\nOne Star for outdoor seating - which is nice to take advantage of in SF when it's actually sunny and hot out.  One Star is for the salads on the menu which are actually good.  \n\nNow for what was bad:  3 of my colleagues ordered specials of the day which you would hope would be something great.  Well surprise, they were terrible and expensive!\n\nOne coworker ordered the special linguine dish for $11, another the fish and chips for $10 and another the french dip for $10.  The fish and chips arrived and looked like store bought frozen and battered fish that had been fried.  The french dip arrived with no accompaniment and the pasta arrived in a small bowl (like your standard small dish at home about 5 in diameter) with no accompaniments.  When asked about accompaniment for french dip waitress said oh, i'll bring your fries (10 min later).  We didn't ask about the pasta but we did ask for bread which she brought (10 min later).  Typically when you order a special you would expect to receive something little more such as grilled veggie, side salad, french fry or bread at a minimum - it wasn't like it was a huge dish of pasta, not adequate.  Meat in the french dip was also not very appealing and not easy to eat.  When coworker told the waitress that he could eat about two more bowls of pasta (not very big see pic) she replied with oh...people usually say it's the perfect amount.  Somehow I find this hard to believe.  I also think the guy in the kitchen may have been a little off.  Seems like the dishes were missing their sides with staff not caring or knowing.  \n\nGood for beers and burgers and sunshine - salads good too but not much else and $$$ for what you get.", "author": "Shannon B."}

There is plenty of seating so if you are looking for a bigger alternative to the Boston Sports Bar, Buccaneer, and also a place for food, The Connecticut Yankee is a great spot.  It's more of a sit down and eat/drink place than a standing and yelling at the T.V. every time Brian Scalabrine gets the ball type bar.  For a standing and yelling at the T.V. bar, the Buc is your best best.\n\nThough I wouldn't go to The Connecticut Yankee just for food, it's very good for bar food.  If I had to rate the food here like a restaurant, I would give it a solid three, but as far as bar food goes, it's a four rating.  The chicken tenders, nachos, and burgers are all good. \n\nI had a chance to try brunch today at The Connecticut Yankee during a Celtics game and was impressed by some of the choices on the menu.  I ordered the stuffed French toast, which I enjoyed though not for the calorie counter as there might have been the equivalent of a small stick of cream cheese inside mixed with raspberry jam.  The potatoes were also nicely seasoned.  I would order both dishes again.  \n\nFor eating, drinking, and watching Boston sports, The Connecticut Yankee is a great spot.", "author": "Josh K."}

I just went here tonight to watch a UCONN (ie, University of CONNECTICUT) basketball game, thinking that there MIGHT be a good vibe going on there or something.  I walk in and see the TVs everywhere, and I think \"cool, this is a sports bar like I thought\".  WRONG.  I was expecting something of Old Pro (palo alto) caliber.  WRONG.  I go to a waiter and ask where I can sit to watch the game.  They (the CONNECTICUT yankee) said \"what game?\".  I then point to my UCONN jacket.  and they go \"oh, I don't know which TV it's on... lemme see\".  Turns out all the TVs in the main room have the sound off, and everyone's just eating dinner in the main room.  WTF?  The sound is only on in the BACK room where they try to hide the people there to watch sports.  All THREE of us.  So I take this in stride.  There was also a distinct lack of New England pride going on....\r\n\r\nThis alone I can deal with.  I sit down and open the menu.  I see a chowdah.  So I order a chowdah.  IT SUCKED.  ALL cream, not much sherry, not much clam, not much spice... NOT MUCH but cream.  BIG thumbs down.  The tuna salad I got was OK--quite huge, and did a good job of filling me up.  Tuna could have been less dry--cooked a little more rare, but oh well.  Next time I'll just get a \"Birdger\"\r\n\r\nSo the food was decent, except for the crappy chowdah.  They had a good selection of beers on tap (though nothing like Amnesia or the Toronado), but there was no CT vibe...  yes, it looked like a New England bar, but... it wasn't someplace that should be called CT yankee.

The outside design, the long tables inside, pitchers of Sam Adams, and Patriots and Red Sox gear from top to bottom give this place an eerie realism that's only appreciated by someone who actually lived in Connecticut.\n\nNow some of you may be saying, \"So what, there's tons of New England-themed bars in this city. What's the big deal?\" Very true, but there's a world of difference between New England and just Connecticut. New England represents all kinds of stuff. From the Lobsters up in Maine to cheese in Vermont to Cape Cod and Boston in Massachusetts, it represents quite a large chunk of Americana. Connecticut, however, represents a couple of Indian casinos and a plot of land that you have to drive through to get from Massachusetts to New York. It's the land of Martha Stewart, Joe-mentum and crooked game show contestants.\n\nBut enough cracking on the Nutmeg State. Truth is, we kid because we love. The Connecticut Yankee may be puzzling to someone who's never spent summers in West Haven scarfing down lobster rolls or traveling from city to city just to find out what they call big sandwiches there (Could be a hoagie, wedge, roll, sub, grinder or poorboy), but that's the charm of it. This is a theme bar that transports you to a place you had no idea you ever wanted to go to but should. It's a big fat slice of the suburban northeast right in the middle of San Francisco, which is weirdly interesting when you think about it.\n\nService and beer selection are average at the Yankee, and if they were any better it would take away from the authentic Long Island Harbor feel of the place.\n\nSo take a trip back east by stopping off at the Connecticut Yankee (especially this fall when Pats games start up). It's like all the fun of Stamford without having to drive through Bridgeport to get there.", "author": "Andrew L."}

I'm a Red Sox fan, though B&R in the City (parents from CT) and I'll come here several times during the baseball season and usually once or so during the off-season, just to chow down when I'm in the hood. \n\nThe food's a notch above the sports bar average and they stock quite a few beers. I'm alright with the prices as well. The memorabilia is great, as you can really spend 15-20 minutes looking at stuff. Back in the day this place used to stock ChinMusic, an awesome baseball and punk magazine (example: Billy Beane interviews Johnny Ramone). That it did so kind of explains a lot about the place: rock and baseball come together. It should be noted for the record that this place has been around a while - 20 years or so - and was doing the Red Sox thing long before it became trendy. \n\nThe service is definitely inconsistent, but over the years (I've been coming here for about 8 or 9 years now) I've figured out a few things. \n\n1) The staff are usually locals and are not Red Sox fans. That doesn't mean they hate the Red Sox, but you gotta take that in mind. \n\n2) The staff seem to be largely artist types, people paying the bills while they play in a band and kids paying their way through college, so they don't really want to be here. That doesn't mean they're going to be a huge dick to you, but you need to remember they aren't your servants.\n\n3) This place gets a pretty diverse crowd..so again, not everybody is going to be a Red Sox fan.\n\n4) A lot of times Red Sox fans come in, drink water, and don't tip. Seriously. So you might be getting grouped in with the bad apples, but be cool, polite, and show em you're not going to sit there and stiff them and they get much nicer.\n\nBasically, if you come into this joint with a laid back, indie rock and tatty baseball (preferably Sox, Giants or A's) cap viewpoint on life, you'll like this place and you'll probably get along with the waitstaff and everyone else.

The draft been selection was good and one girl with our group said her bloody mary was excellent (I'm not a fan of bloody mary's however, so she'll have to be my authority on that one). And once we got our food it was quite good (although the \"Carolina\" barbecue sandwich was a mustard based sauce which is not traditional barbecue - well, maybe in South Carolina, but I'm an NC boy which is clearly the authority on good barbecue - but the sandwich was good regardless, so I'll let it slide).\n\nThe unfortunate part about this place was the service, but I don't really think they care. There was an air of pretentiousness to the staff, it seemed as though only local regulars were welcome. To be fair, there were other people that joined our group late and pulled chairs from another table into their pathway to other tables, which can be frustrating, I'm sure, but we were not an obnoxious group and the latecomers apologized for taking the chairs and they sat at a separate table.  It also took a long time for our food to be ready and our order was in, before our other group arrived.\n\nWith that being said, I'd go again (preferably with a smaller group) because the food and the ambiance were great and the prices were reasonable for the amount/quality of food.

Sure, there is a salad or a burger, but being in San Francisco I'm used to more veggie variety.\n\nThat being said, this is a fun sports-y bar located somewhat-conveniently in Patrero Hill. We were able to walk from the UCSF Mission bay campus in less than five minutes. Entering Connecticut Yankee, you may be a bit overwhelmed by the sports paraphernalia, a few \"yankee\" style decorations, and some more random pieces like a hanging bicycle. Once you get seated (in front of one of the four televisions airing some kind of sports game, if you're lucky), you will not be bored by the eclectic patronage, no matter how boring your own company may be.\n\nThe menu provides a few soup and salad options (the large salads are very large!), as well as some particularly meaty sandwiches (think meatballs, reuben, etc), and a few random selections such as pasta and quiche. Be sure to check the white boards on the wall for daily specials, today was a salmon sandwich and seafood fettucine. \n\nAs far as prices, it is somewhat overpriced for a sports bar (salads $6-8, sandwiches/entrees $8-12), and the serving sizes are decent, but not grandiose. I went with the vegetarian burger and fries, and was satisfied but I won't be writing home (or does yelp count?).\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn't seek the Connecticut Yankee out, but I wouldn't avoid it either.", "author": "Erin M."}

He explained to us that it would be iffy for us to receive and eat our food, but that he'd try his best. And so the food did come out pretty quick.\n\nThe cons about this place:\nWe were not freakin acknowledge for the longest time after walking in. The guy just stood around, walked away, stood around, walked away and then came back. But that was after we stood and starred and stood and starred. \nThere was probably some kind of confusion when I ordered my steak. I had the garlic steak and asked for it medium-rare, then medium. My friend was suggesting medium-rare, so I don't know what he ultimately put down. But my steak came out to be more like medium well to medium. And there was a bunch of fat on the side, which I hate, hate, hate.\nThe clam chowder sucked ass. It was too milky, but not creamy. It had almost no taste, besides from a milky one. No good.\nThe bathroom is old and small and eww.\n\nIn-between:\nThe fries were really fried, but my friend liked it. I'm more of a meaty fries girl, and this place didn't quite deliver. \nThe bread for my steak sandwich was pretty good actually. \nThe sour dough bread wasn't bad either.\nThe gumbo was alright. The shrimp in it was good, but the overall portion was way too small for being $15.\nThere was another order the BIRDGER (something like that) and it was said to be alright.\n\nThis place is a bar, so do expect it to be loud. Do expect a tv with baseball or other sports on. Do expect the place to be old school and everything to be somewhat worn out.

I had a delicious poppy jasper amber ale and my friend had the full sail brewmaster's special Belgium blonde (or something like that).  The food was pretty good for bar food.

The back patio is great and definitely deserves a glowing mention (although if they don't have heat lamps as some reviewers have suggestion, I could see that being a disappointment) and the bar is decent-sized.

The one complaint would be that for a place with that many TV's, they sometimes aren't showing the big games unless you twist somebodys arm. Cool place though", "author": "Nick R."}

I had heard so much about its New England love. There was a big game on, so the bar was pretty crowded. That said, I was sitting right next to the bar and it still took 20 minutes to get a drink. The food was alright, typical bar food. The staff was extremely rude and the bill came on 4 separate pieces of paper so when we paid what looked like the the total we were chased after (all the way down the street) and were told that we were $200 off. Wonderful way to end a terrible visit to this bar. After the Pats lost the bartender cut us off and we were asked to leave. We were with a pretty large group of people, but were not causing any trouble or acting out. I was terribly disappointed and will most definitely never be returning.

Nice old school feeling, good sports bar, decent (order simple stuff and you won't go too wrong) food, good beers on tap.  The questionable thing has always been the service, it's hit or miss.  They have some nice folks, and they have some old coots that think they can bully a female or someone who \"isn't like them\".  I've been barked at on more than one occaision by bartenders there. (as though they're doing me a favor by serving me), and last night REALLY pissed me off to the point where I decided to only have one beer, no food and not go back.  Not only was the bartender rude when I asked \"do you have Anchor Christmas beer?\" (they don't) but then when I ordered a regular Anchor on tap, he opens the cooler, takes out a pint that has been sitting there and serves it to me.  I give him a look, and he says \"I poured it 2 minutes ago\".  Then he puts one measly squirt of fresh beer in and demands $5.  I said.  \"really?\"  He repeats \"I poured it 2 minutes ago - $5 please\"  I paid him and drank the beer but I drink alot of beer and it was indeed kind of flat.  I didn't want to make an issue because I was there with a friend celebrating her birthday so I drank my quasi-flat beer and didn't tip at all.

The blue awning with the red \"Red Sox font\" lettering outside the front door was inviting. \n\nWhen i walked in it was less than 30 minutes before the start of the Celtics' and Bruins' games so, having visited Sonny McLean's in Santa Monica on a similar type day last year, I expected a slew of Green and yellow jerseys, at least based on what I've read and heard. Instead, there were 4 people in the entire bar (I didn't look onto the back patio), including the bartender, who was dressed in one of those SF Giants' Hawaiian shirts. \n\nHe was an angry old man, who seemed to hate all Boston based sports' fans, even though I was under the impression that they were the bar's \"target market\". The walls did have a bunch of Boston based newspaper articles, but they also had a Terrell Owens' Philadelphia Eagles' jersey and a Vikings helmet hung up as well. \n\nIt was slightly confusing to someone who had been told by various sources that this was supposed to be a Boston transplant's \"bar away from home\". To kick it off, they didn't even show the Bruins/Canadians game, tuning into the Rangers/Capitals game instead. When I asked about it the bartender replied with, \"what you see is what you get, we ain't got no hockey package - it's baseball season.\"\n\nNow, the place, w/o the idea that it was supposed to be a targeted toward Boston transplants, seems like an awesome dive bar. The atmosphere, the comfort, and the beer - all great. Hole in the wall, of the beaten path, dirty, and old - all great attributes for the perfect dive bar in my opinion. The issue was that it's being marketed as, whether the bar owner is trying to or not, as a Boston transplant bar and it's a far cry from such, at least based on my one visit. Hell, throughout the first half of the Celtics/Bulls game only two fans walked in. \n\nThe meatball sub was great though, highly recommend it if you need to visit the place for yourself. Just don't go in with the expectations of being greeted with open arms as a Boston transplant. If anyone knows of such a place in the Bay area I'd love to hear about it.", "author": "Adam H."}

You can always catch a Red Sox or Pats game here, so if you're a fan of either team that's a good thing.\n\nBut the Yankee is a bit like one of those childhood friends whom you've stayed friends with out of laziness and habit and not because you still really like the person. In fact this friend can be really annoying and rude sometimes. But what the heck, he's got a big screen satellite TV that gets all the games, he's got really cool sports memorabilia on the walls that you like looking at (good thing, because that keeps you from getting really pissed off when your friend is rude or ignores you), he has a pretty good variety of beers, and he provides decent snacks for the games.\n\nThat's how I feel about the Connecticut Yankee. And clearly that's how they feel towards me. They just seem to tolerate me. Doesn't matter that I'm frequently there with a big group of people from Red Sox Nation spending A LOT of money on drinks and food. Or that whenever someone asks me where they should go to catch the game on TV that I always say, \"Give the Yankee a try.\"  They don't care that the burger I ordered would probably be better if it was still hot when I receive it or that if they had brought me my beer when I asked for one 30 mins ago that I'd be ready to order another one now (thus putting more $ in their pockets). Nah. I'm an old friend. No need to go to any trouble to keep my friendship.\n\nI used to think that I had one of those relationships with the Yankee where my regular patronage (and the fact that I got here regularly with a big group of local Sox fans) would translate into the Yankee wanting to keep me and my group coming back. I've tested this theory a few times now:\n\nI tried to get them to put the sound on for the game the last time I was there.  Response: No.\n\nI wanted to pull three tables together to accommodate the big group of us who were going to be there. (Contrary to Matt P's review, we did not take it upon ourselves to do it -- we actually asked permission, as we have every other time before that when we've been to the bar.) Response: a lot of exasperated breathing and eye rolling from one waitress, followed by some passive aggressive behavior -- making us wait a long, friggin' time for service.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Every once in awhile I actually do have a pleasant time at the Yankee. But lately there are more bad times there than good.\n\nI tried to reserve the back room for a recent group gathering. They told me that the room is first come first serve. And yet when we were there a couple weeks ago in the back room, they kicked us out because another group had \"reserved\" the room.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-04-26", "description": "At the bottom of Potrero Hill sits this tavern filled with east coast sports nostalgia. Ideal pre-show chill spot when travelling to Bottom of the Hill or The Parkside. Only a few steps from those two houses of rock, at Connecticut Yankee you can avoid the crowd and the wait. An outdoor seating area with picnic bench seating is desirable and the heatlamps are key for the chilly bay area evenings. Full menus for brunch, lunch and dinner include a couple veggie options (veggie chili, veggie burger) but I can't comment because I've only ever eaten fries. The \"live music\" on the weekends are of the jam band variety (to be avoided, imho), but it won't be heard if you sit outside.", "author": "Alex D."}

The food is above average pub food, but still that, pub food.  Their hot wings are good, lean with a damn tasty hot sauce.  I ordered the 'Wade Boggs', which is a chicken sandwich with cheese, lettuce, pickles, and tomato with fries. My girlfriend ordered the 'Fowl Play', a dish that is pretty much fried chicken with mashed potatoes and some greens.  I must say that I wish I could have traded.  I am a sucker for crunchy chicken.  The beer was fresh and cold, ( I had a Guinness from tap) with little head.  The bartender had no problem switching over the station on a t.v. closer to where we were sitting, so the viewing experience while eating was good.  I enjoyed the memorabilia-based decor being a Red Sox fan, so the atmosphere was great.  The \"3\" star decision could have been helped by our waitress, who we witnessed acting differently to all of her tables.  Why couldn't we be treated a little nicer?  I was born and  raised in NE, so I don't buy the \"hard\" personality concept one of the other reviewers mentioned.  Due to the nature of the bar (read baseball fandom), i will of course go back for the post-season fervor and neighborhood feel of the place.", "author": "TJ D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-05-19", "description": "Until recently, I thought I would continue to patronize the Yank due to it's fantastic atmosphere, great food and superb beer selection.  However, SOMETHING HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED SINCE JAN/FEB 2006.  Not only did the wait staff shrink to only a few regular guys (there used to be a good mix of male and female servers), but the guys that are there are absolutely the RUDEST and WORST people I have ever come across in the restaurant industry.  What would you do if you ordered something totally different than want was brought to you by the waiter only to have the waiter say, \"well...SOMEONE ORDERED IT!!!\", drop the food in the center of the table and walk away (and not even say \"I am sorry\" or attempt to bring something else)?  Or have the same waiter, on a totally different day, not bring an entree out at all and simply ignore your table all together (even after repeated requests for drinks and the entree in question)?  Or, have the barkeep, whom may also be the owner, tell you that they are \"too busy for common courtesy\"?  Well...I'll tell you what you'd do...you would find a new place to hang out and spend money (there are just too many other places in San Francisco to run a restaurant/bar like that).  Maybe someday, when the ownership changes, I'll go back, but until that day, I'll walk across the street to Park Side or up Connecticut to Goat Hill Pizza - which are both equally as good.", "author": "Justin L."}

I have to say though the waitress was terribly rude. I showed up later after my group of friends had already been there for a while. When the waitress came to take a round of orders, I ordered a Cosmo and she said \"what kind of Vodka?\" I said \"what do you have?\" She named them all...  I asked \"what is your well?\" She said \"Absolute\" I said \"oooh, that sounds good, I'll have that\"  She rolled her eyes at me  and said \"if you can spare the dollar, you can have real vodka, Absolute is crap!\" I was shocked! I looked at her in utter disbelief - I said \"no, I'll just  have the absolute\" She rolled her eyes again. I looked at my boyfriend who didn't hear the full exchange, I then looked at her and she said \" if I was you, I'd splurge, spend the extra one dollar bill and have a real drink\" I said something like..\"Do, I have to order again?, I want it with Absolute\" . This is when everyone at the table started to hear us. The waitress began taking more orders and then walked off. My boyfriend asked me why I was so rude to the waitress? I then had to explain to him the rest of the story and I was really pissed by this point!  I could not believe it! Not only was the waitress extremely rude and unprofessional, she caused a conflict between my boyfriend and I. She tried hard to make me feel cheap in front of a group of people - whom btw - I didn't even know very well. You can never know someones background. She didn't know that  I used to live in Sweden, when she said Absolute I immediately got nostalgic thinking about my friends there and the year I spent living in Hultsbruk.  I will never go here again! And I will most certainly tell this story to anyone thinking of going there, or who asks me if I've ever been there!", "author": "lydacious p."}
