It's spacious without bumping into other people AND not too many people crowd into here like boogaloo's AND their prices as usual are great for the large plateful of food they give you!!  They have large round tables so it's great for groups and families.  \n\nAgain, do NOT come here for gourmet food, the freshest, the bestest, etc.  It's just the usual decently cooked Chinese food, but if you're in the area (because you have to deal with Social Security or go to SF City College's 22nd St branch) and afterwards are hungry for hot prepared food quickly, it's a great choice for the budget conscious and for anyone who doesn't like feeling pressured to eat fast, pay fast, and leave fast for the next crowd to come in which I hate from other places!! Across the street is a parking lot if there's no street parking.  I come in the daytime when the young waitress is there and she's HELPFUL!!  She works way harder than a lot of employees I've seen at many restaurants, even Asian ones.  \n\nThe food is as usual LARGE PORTIONS as I enjoyed chomping my way thru my Everest mountain of hot cooked well-flavored BBQ pork rice and I was definitely HUNGRY!!  Their Korean chicken was a tummyful, so crispy & tasty!!  I asked for hot cautiously, but when I got it, it wasn't too hot.  It was more sweet than hot.  The heat was pretty mild.  \n\nTheir lunch specials have more rice than actual rice/veggies so if you are NOT especially hungry, go for the discount lunch special.  If you're definitely hungry, go for the separate meals/fried rice/noodles OR try 2 lunch specials.  \n\nFor sure, if you have 2 people, if you just order 1 order of fried rice and an entree meal, you can half them for you both and it will be less than $20.  If you're only 1 person ordering them, you'll for sure be taking home a doggie bag of food!!", "author": "Frugal C."}

The service was friendly and timely, so no complaints about that.\nWhenever I try out a new Chinese restaurant I always try their Wonton soup and their Egg Foo Young (if it's on the menu) as those 2 dishes seem the easiest to F'up and I've had the worst experiences with in the past.\nThey DO serve EFY but it's veggie, and I made the mistake of adding chicken. Clearly, their chicken is pre-cooked and they just add it to dishes when ordered, so this resulted in tough, dry pieces of meat in my dish (-1*). It would have been amazing w/o the chicken.\nMy first bite also included a piece of egg shell, as did my second and 20th or so bites. (-1*)\nNext, the wonton soup. \nThey have Wor Wonton which has everything in it, so I went for that. The flavor was great, the soup had more ingredients than ANY other WW soup I've ever ordered, but the wonton wrappers were SUPER pasty and soggy (-1*).\nSo overall, I would eat here again. \nTheir prices and portion size are commendable in this ridiculous market, and the flavor was good overall. If not for some consistency and careless additions, it would have garnered a higher rating.", "author": "D C."}

(Los Angeles doesn't have many amazing options unless you want to take an hour drive). I decided to trust help and ventured into the mission district with my Chinese food craving. I'm very happy yelp directed me to this restaurant. The venue was large and my group and I were seated by the windows at a round table. The staff was efficient and brought our orders out in a timely manner. Everything tasted excellent. We ordered the salty fish fried rice, broccoli beef, cashew chicken, cashew nut prawns, chicken chow mien and a couple other items that I can't recall. It was all very good and our bill came out to $14 each (including tax and tip) which was fantastic. I recommend trying this spot if you are in the area.

There are lots of Chinese restaurants in the city, we came here as a second option when my bookmarked place was closed for vacation. It doesn't look like much that's for certain. But it was very busy so it was a good sign. It was $28 or so for three of us to eat with plenty of leftovers we actually had to give to a homeless person because we weren't going home. Food was very good in quality and flavor. I could tell what kind of meat I was eating, which is very hard to come by in Chinese cuisine. I was kind of disappointed that on the combo plates for one they don't let you do half rice half chow mein, but my friend and I just gave each other a little bit of each. The Szechuan shrimp was sooooo good, I loved the flavor of the sauce, the batter made the shrimp a little soggy but it was still good shrimp. I wasn't a huge fan of the Mongolian beef, it was very salty and missing somewhat sweet flavor that I actually found in the Szechuan sauce so I took a scoop of my friends plate and mixed it with my Mongolian beef.

The food and decor is simply not trendy enough for the Valencia St crowd and that's okay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-26", "description": "Even though I spent some of my best childhood years growing up in the \"Mission District\" (us prehistoric originals never call it in Google hipsterese \"I'm so cool I live in \"The Mission,\") I usually avoid eating in the neighborhood I grew up in, thinking of it as kind of the SF version of \"The Occupied West Bank\" and my original Latino Homiez and their families as the Frisco version of The Palestinians, driven out of their homes by new settlers who claim that the new Google gods gave them the right. But I was invited to have lunch there by an old neighborhood friend who said that he has been eating here at Heung Yuen for 30 years, since he was 2. I should have known better, especially since he's 32 and can hardly walk already, and his right leg is permanently asleep due to poor circulation. But I wanted to see him, so here I was, feeling like I was walking through \"occupied Hebron\" in \"hipster territory\" heehee, amid the new \"invisible checkpoints,\" the $100 bistro tabs, designed to keep the original locals out, and among all the $20 coffee \"boutiques\" and Birkenstock wearing \"loungers,\" acting like they owned these streets, the hallowed grounds where \"Los Siete De La Raza roamed\" (Google it for more info haha, Google again, such irony,) and the 24th St Boyz held sway, finding my way to Heung Yuen. I sighed when I saw that this place truly hasn't changed from the outside, (and inside) since my childhood, but now, oddly out of place amid the slick themed bistros and bars around it. So anyway, I seldom talk about \"health\" in these reviews because the assumption is that if my butt is in that chair, it ain't gonna kill me (or you.) But this time I have to  seriously consider my own (and your) mortality when I talk about Heung Yuen, and especially that often reviewed  \"sent from heaven\" conqueror of the yelp universe, superhero \"Korean\" chicken. Which btw, truthfully is not really \"Korean\" or associated with real \"Korean chicken\"'in any way shape or form. Those of you that are Korean (from The Big K,) or second generation, and know about this, or If you're under 30 and don't know, ask your parents about \"Pelicana Chicken,\" in Korea, the original, who pioneered and commercialized this type, (deep fried glazed,) the template, the \"real\" no lie, and always the best, and you will know that Heung Yuen's (although yes, crunchy on the outside and yes tender inside,) version's flavors are off, no balance between hot and spicy. An amateur overly sweet snd gratuitously unhealthy, wanna be knock off. A Cantonese cooks mistaken impression of what Korean chicken \"must be like.\" So seriously my hipster settler heroes. Since you put so much money and effort into driving my Latino homiez and their families out of their Mission District homes, and changed its character with your google salaries, then maybe you should start saving some artery space from now on so you can enjoy it, by avoiding this place. So I'm not gonna run with the pack on this one. Two stars max for cheap prices. POSTSCRIPT: After lunch there, I sat on \"the throne\" all afternoon and into the evening and night, and no I ain't the dang Last Emperor. Haha, very funny.  I swear I can tell the noodles in our bland, greasy tomato beef chow mein, were fried in lard. Yes, I can tell the diff. Cuz I'm the noodle (and sushi) king, no lie. \"Noodle G\"?\" Nah that sounds kinda stupid. Anyway, truthfully, after eating here, my toes and fingers were numb (bad circulation) till the next day. So, if you're a twenty something, you ain't gonna be listenin to me about what you put in your body past your tastebuds anyway. But if you're around 40, then you'll know after the first few bites, that you ain't got no biz eatin this stuff, and putting your body through this, unless your BFF works in the ER and your second BFF is a paramedic to get you there.

Our All time Favorite is the Korean Chicken.. Haven't found any other restaurant that can make them like they do.  We also love there Won ton soup, Broccoli Beef, Sweet and Sour, ect.. ect..  Now, we have had the chance to bring our kids to this restaurant and tell them the story of how excited we would get every sunday cause sadly yes (we didn't like going to church.. really bad I know), we didn't mind because our mom would treat us to this place.

Having not to settle for fast food, or fried chicken, I looked up Chinese food and Heung Yuen was only a block away from the USBank building. Upon arrival, I still had to wait an additional 20 minutes for my food, after calling in for pick-up, and purposely walking-slow along 22nd St. Are you kidding me?! Although, it was affordable, I didn't like the style of service of an open kitchen door open for guest at the dining area to see. \n\n(A personal preference of mine - I don't like seeing my food prepared. Especially at hole-in-the wall places like these.) \n\nI sat down, and waited for my food. Checked in on Foursquare, checked my Twitter, and Facebook - and still no food. I seriously bet, they didn't start making my order until I arrived. -___- \n\nAlthough the uncomfortable wait, the food was delicious, like any other Chinese place. I was super hungry -  and everything I ordered was perfect. Nothing new. But satisfying enough..", "author": "Tiffany M."}

Wanted to venture out of my comfort zone (aka The Sunset) and try something in the Mission. The staggering drunk guy outside Heung Yuen should have been the tell-tale sign to turn around and leave. But despite my first ominous sign, we continued. We were seated next to a table of young foul mouth teens (yes, I've turned into a grumpy old man) and this one girl would not stop swearing... every other word was something harsh and terrible - f-bombs, N-bombs, etc. So that's strike two, if you're keeping count. \n\nOnto the food. Ordered: Korean chicken (boneless), string beans with beef, salt & pepper pork chop, mango shrimp, and seafood pan fried noodle. The food was eh.... definitely had better. Portions were good and the prices were definitely wallet-friendly. \n\nTheir service had mixed reactions. Overall great but at the end of the meal one of the servers started clearing people's plates even though some of us were clearly still eating. I was getting livid but held my tongue cuz I know once I go off, I go off! Granted I think he was clearing the table so that we can cut the birthday cake we'd brought. But by that time we were just ready to leave this place behind us. \n\nI can see the appeal to this divey Chinese restaurant. It's low-down-dirty-Tuesday-night-I-don't-feel-like-cooking-I'm-ordering-Chinese-take-out kinda place. It's really a quick stop for the locals.

Yelp reviews were raving so much about the Korean chicken I had to try it. Only ordered the Korean chicken & pot stickers (since everyone seemed to rave about that too). \n\nBoth were jus ok for me. Since the korean chicken is fried & doused w/ all that spicy/sweet sauce, it really needs to be eaten right away (I did take out & was 15 mins away from home) by the time I got home the chicken on the bottom was soaked & soggy. The top pieces were ok, kind of a greasy dish over all. My husband  said it had that duck seasoning kind of taste that he didn't really like. Not a good dish for leftovers either. \n\nThe potstickers didn't come w/ any special sauce so I made my own (vinegar, soy sauce, cilantro & threw in a few chili slices). They were pretty small & expected more for a $5 appetizer. \n\nFor these 2 dishes, paid $12.37.", "author": "Janel H."}

If you don't like greasy Chinese noodles, maybe you think the Italians put too much garlic in their food  or Mexican food overdoes the peppers. \n\nGo to Chinatown; look for a place where just Chinese folks are eating, with no English menu handy, go in, sit down, try to cope with that strange smoky flavor in the fried rice, the pepper that burns for a second then leaves wonderful after tastes, really fat chow fun noodles and then maybe, just maybe, you'll begin to acquire a little actual \"culture\". \n\nThe prices at Heung Yuen are modest, the servings more than generous, the staff more than willing to help you explore what they offer, even to creating special dishes for you.

The place is a good size for a divey place.  Two dining rooms.  Service is not the best and had to wait for a menu and to order.  Prices are definitely on the low side.  The tea had a hint of of either tea bag or sink water after taste.  I guess i got used to it.  I got chicken won ton soup without noodles.  It was less than $6.  You get a small bowl with more than enough wontons.  I didn't like the bock choy though.  They left the ends on and they looked brownish/yellow which i take as either aged and unfresh.  Ends should be white.  If you want a full meal definitely get the soup with noodles, it might fill you up more.  I decided to order a rice plate to-go which was the curry chicken.  For dinner, I reheated the food and it was good.  White meat with a curry sauce that is very good.  Not salty and not too rich.  A lot of onions as usual but cooked right.  One thing that i didn't like was it lacked veggies.  I was looking for carrots at least but it had green peppers.  Potatoes would have been nice.  I'd have to say it was better than the soup.  I don't know about the 4 stars but I guess its all about the Korean Chicken everyone is talking about.  I did  notice the guy in front of me order it.  I may go back just to see what the hype is.  Until then the hype is just Ok and mediocre to me.  Just another average asian restaurant.  Not bad on the pocket though!", "author": "Chris S."}

Per the rave reviews, we ordered the Korean fried chicken boneless and got a side of white rice and their Chef Special chow mein. Yes the chicken was yummy! I felt like it had more breading than meat, but that's what makes it so good, right? The chicken was fried just right, making it crispy and juicy. And that sauce. Omg that sauce is killer! I'm wondering if they'll share that recipe with me so I can whip it up at home and slather all types of meat into it. I think it's just honey and some sort of spicy sauce and crushed red peppers. The chow mein was fine. It was pretty oily and they were stingey when it came to meat and vegetables, but we still enjoyed it.  \n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive. It's certainly not a place where you'd wanna take a first date to (it was obviously a Mexican restaurant in its past life), so you can call in your order for pick up if you prefer that.

The Korean Chicken is probably the best thing on their menu, but everything else doesn't fall too short behind it. It doesn't get a five-star review because the food here can be a bit overpriced, but it doesn't stop me from coming here at least 2 a month. Everyone here is very friendly and never fail to smile at me. Always recommend this place to a friend.", "author": "Sheryl F."}

I could only bring myself to write this right after I ate their takeout because it would be unfair self torture otherwise! I looooove this place. My family has been going to this spot since I can remember.  When I say family, that includes my huge collection of grandparents, aunts uncles and cousins. The service there is the best because they treat you like family. In fact, when I arrive, they always tell me something like, \" Oh, your uncle came earlier and we made him a great clay pot,\"  I have not glanced at a menu in years because the lady who takes our order remembers exactly what we like or she suggests something we haven't had before. When my dad goes, my dad just says, \"I feel like having something seafood\" and they whip something up in the back for him so good that it makes no appearance in the menu. \n\nEverything here is good, even if it's not the most glamorous of places, you know people come here for the food. In all the years I have been going there, this place has changed very little as far as staff and surroundings go.... It's definitely a place of comfort.  I keep going to other places but nobody beats their yummy food, prices and service . Good place to go with the family and not worry about making a mess.", "author": "Irene A."}

Last thing I need is gnarly mudbutt.\"\n\nThis chicken is amazing, for about 8 bucks you can get more rice and chicken than you can eat.

The food isn't that great as I expected from the past reviews, and everything I ordered was covered in loads of \"sauce\" which didn't make it any more appetizing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-11-10", "description": "An ok place. Unfortunately, better than most the Chinese alternatives in this area, so I find myself going back there occasionally in spite of myself. Someone really needs to start a consistently good Chinese take-out restaurant around 21st-24th and Mission and put all these mediocre places out of business.\n\nThe food is uneven, ranging from decent to unacceptable (e.g., noodles that are partially raw, deep fried chicken that is sufficiently undercooked to have dough oozing out of it when you bite into it, etc.).\n\nThe service is likewise inconsistent. One guy is incredibly smilely and nice, while another guy acts like you're an idiot when you can't read his mind (to know, e.g., that they're out of an ingredient or closing 15 minutes before their stated closing time).\n\nI find the potstickers to be ok--worth getting if you're there, but not worth going out of the way to get them. They're just kinda normal potstickers that you'd get in a restaurant--certainly above frozen quality, but nothing to dream about.", "author": "Jared B."}

I love the shrimp wonton soup, but they use so much msg that I can't eat it. Otherwise, the flavor is authentic. If you really want to eat real Chinese, don't order the typical American stuff like kung pao chicken or sweet and sour pork- that is NOT Chinese food. Order the steamed fish or vegetable for the day with a simple garlic or oyster sauce. I wish they had brown rice. The employees are responsive and very genial. I come here any day I feel like having a decent meal and to be served.
