The decoration on the wall has a lot of comic art on the wall. This place isn't too busy there are tables and solo seating (35 worth of seating). I finish ordering and the burger isn't as pleasing as it looks or taste. I asked what's usually good here? The cashier with the nose ring gave me a non enthusiastic reply of \"oh the cheese burger are good obviously\" \n\nI end up getting a bacon cheese burger with no mayo or ketchup with fries totaling at $13. After waiting not to long about 8mins my order arrived.\n\n The meat feels dry and no flavor and guess what they didn't even add my bacon I ordered. I end up leaving after taking 2 bites of my burger and ate 4 pieces of fries (which I have to say is also no flavor and poorly selected for freshness). Due to 1 I felt like the atmosphere was not pleasing to eat and lost my appetite. 2. The order was not correct (missing bacon and told her no onions but still placed it on the plate). 3. Only 3 customer in the restaurant can't even make me feel welcome. \n\nOverall: DONT GO here please it's really mediocre. The burger is bland, employees don't want to work there.

This solidified during the mad cow disease scare in the early 2000s, when I gave up beef but then made exceptions if I could find it from Niman Ranch or Marin Sun Farms. Burger Joint's posted menu says their hamburgers come from Niman Ranch. (It doesn't actually say this for their cheeseburgers, which are listed separately, so it would be nice if they clarified that.)\n\nSome friends who are partial to Big Mouth, 5 blocks south, recently convinced me to give Big Mouth a try instead of Burger Joint. But a visit to Big Mouth tonight convinced me that Burger Joint is quite a bit better, and deserves 5 stars. If you want to do the comparison I did, order a cheeseburger cooked medium on a whole wheat bun, with a salad (instead of fries, offered at both places as an alternative). I usually just drink free water in a cup, but Burger Joint has tasty Juice Squeeze sodas too. Burger Joint won easily. The burger is always juicy and delicious at BJ. It was similarly tasty but a bit drier at BM. Wheat bun is fresh at BJ, but was stale and hard at BM. Salad at BJ has fresh greens and tomatoes, and is available with tasty balsamic vinaigrette. BM's salad is kind of a dry caesar with cheese. And the BJ meal is a bit cheaper in this comparison. Service is quick and reliable at BJ, but I found it a bit slow at BM. Although Big Mouth is closer to my house, I think I will stick with Burger Joint. If you like more menu choices, burgers with different names and so on, go to Big Mouth.

They offer vegetarian burgers, sweet potato fries, and options ranging from the healthy to much less so.

The quality grass-fed beef, the delicious shakes and a soda from the fountain to get the real deal coke with that burger to satisfy that craving. Yum!  \n\n  I have to admit- I had not eaten there in quite some time. I had become a fan of Urban Burger on 17th and Valencia, lately, but some genius closed it down and opened yet another taco spot. what were they thinking!? So I walked the couple of extra blocks to ease the burger craving I was having.  \n\n  When I walked into, bj,  the place had a completely different feel to it. ...EMPTY....\nI ordered my burger, payed and went to the RR. Then, I noticed a couple of huge bags of PROCESSING POTATOES laying there on a pallet right next to the RR door. In my mind, I kept saying to myself, *They don't use those for their fries!*  Those are the type of potatoes they use for filler. That is the stuff they use in canned foods like Hormel chili and gross stews and even dog food. Yech!!!  They are hideous things, full of chemicals and growth hormones, probably produced by Monsanto. \n\n I came around front and sat down looking at the art. The same decor from happier times. I noticed the lack luster staff. Everything started hitting me all at once. I noticed the thick cut potatoes and saw that they fit the length of the ones sitting in the back on the floor next to the filthy toilet. I saw the cook ball up my hamburger in the white wrapper and tie the ends together. my order was up.\n\nI bit into my burger, it wasn't bad... and it was not good. it was a burger without character. Bland. Something I could eat if I wanted and forget about soon after. I tasted the fries. they were even more horrible than I remembered. I never was a fan of the thick cut BJ fries.\n\nI said all of this because I thought it was curious how a business could promote the image of selling organic meats and then turn around and sneak in the cheapest and most gross vegetables- their fries. I guess that's why they're free.", "author": "CM B."}

I used the restroom and it was plenty clean and well lit also.\n\n   Unfortunately, the hippie liberals have blackballed any big chain joints from building in the city (not like they needed those jobs or anything)  so there are no IN &  OUTs, no FIVE GUYS, and no JOHNNY ROCKETS. So if they whine about this place not being that good or being too expensive (as some reviews do) it's their own damn fault they cant buy a better burger for the same money. Also, it's San Fancisco DUH!! These places are paying OBSCENE rents so they have to charge a lil more to cover that. A similar burger in the East Bay is a few bucks less. \n\n   So there ya have it.

Both were friendly when I asked advice for parking outside, and when I came back to order, service was prompt and with a smile.  Bonus.  \n\nOn to the food...  I ordered a \"Mini Cheeseburger and Fries,\" $6.95.  Okay, you might think that's a little pricey for a \"Mini\" (tack on another $1.50 for a Standard size Chee'burger), but these aren't frozen Costco patties they're serving.  The Niman Ranch beef was tender, flavorful, and cooked-to-order on the plainly visible (from the counter) grill.  The toppings were as fresh as could be - green leaf lettuce (no iceberg here!), dill pickle chips, red onion, fresh tomato, and mayonnaise applied without excess...a definite plus.  The french fries were thick, steak fries and were nice and crispy.  Not too salty, not bland, either.  \n\nMusic soundtrack seemed pretty diverse, but the important thing is that the volume was not cranked up to ear-bleeding levels.

Our expectations were pretty high considering that the restaurant has won some local awards for the best burger in San Francisco, but our experience with Burger Joint hardly competed with your average burger at chain restaurant like a Chili's or TGI Fridays. As you walk in to this very small place, you're immediately confronted with the counter to order your food, so if there are more than a few people waiting to order, they have to stand out the door.   I ordered and the service was friendly, but I wouldn't say that their goal here is memorable customer service, however, the girl brought our food to our table when it was ready.\nNow for the bad part...Unfortunately for us and everyone else that was eating there at the time, employees kept going into their \"back room\" where I would expect that they store cleaning supplies and possibly garbage to be taken out because a very strong odor of rotting garbage would fill the room each time someone opened the door.  Imagine trying to eat while sitting in an open sewer vent.  GROSS!  This made eating our lunch rather unenjoyable considering the dining area is very small and even with the front door open, venting out the nauseating odor wasn't happening.\n\nOverall, if you live within walking distance of this place and are in the mood to spend a little more than you should on an over-rated burger and fries this is the place for you, just make sure you at least get it TO GO unless your into claustrophobia, the smell of decaying garbage or a backed up toilet.", "author": "Maggie G."}

The burgers are cooked to order, either regular or mini-sized, and the fries are not too greasy.\n\nNiman Ranch meat is more expensive, and worth the price.  I don't eat many burgers, but when I do, I'd rather eat the happy cows from the cheese commercials instead of the cows who live miserably in the hot Central Valley (have you seen that place down I-5?

Small, diner like decor.  Typical diner setting, bunch of tables and a few booths.  They are simple, they offer, burgers, hot dogs and fries.  The burgers offered are the following: cheeseburger, hamburger, chicken burger, veggie burger.  In addition there are hot dogs and french fries.  The cheeseburger comes in a mini size also ( equivalent to a McDonalds Cheeseburger size) which is good if you aren't willing to up your cholesterol too many points in one day.  \n\nThe burgers and dogs are made with Niman Ranch meat.  With that knowledge you then expect a higher quality burger and taste.  To be honest, my first bite was delicious, but then the following bites started to get salty for me.  Too salty for my taste.  Despite that though I finished the whole mini cheeseburger, so it wasn't that bad.  Don't let my comments fool you.  The french fries were the thick kind.

You get the usual fixings on your burger--lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and mayo, and a slice of cheese if want it--and a small bag of fries to go along with it. The difference is that the quality of the burger and fries are so much better than your usual fast food place. Each burger is made to order so you may have to wait a few minutes before you get your meal, but that beats eating assembly line food any day in my book.\n\nOn the negative side, a full meal will run you about 10 bucks so it's not quite competitive with the prices you'll get at average quickie food places. Also, the service is somewhat hit-or-miss. The attitude of the employees towards store patrons is \"So whatchu want?\" more than \"Can I help you?\"; not necessarily rude, but somewhat apathetic. The burgers are supposed to be front-and-center at BJ, so if all you really care about is your meal, then how helpful they are shouldn't matter at all.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily call Burger Joint's burgers fantastic enough to warrant a cross-town trek, but if you're in the neighborhood it's certainly worth the few additional bucks to get a meal here than at any of the McDonald's or Burger King branches on Mission.", "author": "Raffy E."}

Like somehow the deaths of Niman Ranch cows (who are apparently accompanied by their ranchers to the slaughterhouse and only killed once they are \"calm\")  incur less of a karmic debt for my palate and colon.  Not sure if the Dalai Llama would agree...\n\nBut the fries, ooh I love me their steak fries.  No question His Holiness  would totally nom some of these bad boys.  Only once were they not perfect (a little undercooked), and if I was able to keep track of how often I go there, I'd let you know what percentage that was--somewhere in the 2-3% range, at most.\n\nI also love that the burger is big, but in a \"flat and wide and plenty of bites\" way and not in an \"unhinge your jaw to get your mouth around it\" way, which can be annoying.

The rest of the stuff is fresh and works well. The thick-ass fries are not the way forward: fries are all about maximizing the fried-to-potato ratio, and there is way too much potato here. The prices aren't bad for the quality of the meat -- it's expensive for a burger, but really good value for a steak.\n\nThe place is gleamingly clean and the service is fast, but both of those things may have to do with the way the place is totally empty.\n\n3 stars for great food quality.

But don't get me wrong, I love smaller menus...it allows the cooks to focus in on making particular dishes great, instead of making a trillion things ok. I skipped the coke (those things will kill you!) and ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  My meal came out very hot and very quickly and  the fries were thickly cut and pretty good.  The burger was tasty (although my meat was a bit too pink for my liking) and the ingredients were fresh.  $7.50 for a burger and fries (without the coke) IS on the pricey side, especially for a place that calls itself a \"joint\" but I enjoyed my meal and would go back.", "author": "LaSha G."}

I ended up limiting myself to no more than one a week. I know that sounds gross but what can I say? I was pregnant and hungry all the time. One time I  called my husband at work crying because I was so hungry and didn't know what to do about it. He was already driving home so he couldn't bring me any of his scrumptious and delightful food, so at 11:30 at  night he stopped to get me some tacos in the mission on his drive home. (He was a very good daddy to be) Anyways despite his attempts I was really kinda disappointed that it wasn't a burger. I later convinced him  to do burger wed. at work. So besides my husbands burgers, Burger joint burgers are in my top three favorites. They use Niman ranch beef, they get the temperatures right, and the fries are some of the best in the city. And for the ladies trying to watch their waist line, or for the kids, they have mini burgers and  fries that taste just as good but are a smaller portion. I also enjoy the atmosphere, with the red booths, the stenciled walls, and the juke box-ish music. A modern version of an all American fifties diner. Love it.", "author": "Esa Y."}
