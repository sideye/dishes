Surprisingly, there was not a long line at 2pm on a Sunday, and despite only having a few drip machines, they processed orders quickly while making conversation and complimenting my friend's attire.  \n\nMocha 4.5/5: This was by far one of the best mochas I've had recently.  I've become used to finding a thick glob of half melted chocolate residing at the bottom in a swampy goopy mess.  This was not the case with Ritual's mocha which stayed a perfect consistency and light frothy milky smoothness even though sipped it slowly until it cooled down to room temperature. I liked that this mocha was not overly sweet, and I did not have to ask to have the sweetness lessened.  \n\nAmericano 4/5: This was a decent chilled drink, but like all iced coffees in my experience, tasted a bit watered down.  This may just be a personal preference, but in general, I find that iced coffees without a lot of cream or sweetener are just very plain and the brew is not strong enough to bring out a good flavor in the drink amongst the ice.  I do have  a tendency to drink slowly, so this probably exacerbates the wateriness.\n\nMaybe I'm used to high priced coffee in SF nowadays, but the price of their drinks was exactly what I expected for Hayes.  In addition, it's nice that they advertise their fair trade environmentally friendly processes, doing their due diligence in being San Franciscan.  The day I was there, it was overcast and too cold for Smitten ice cream, but still acceptable weather to be hanging out outdoors by the food truck and park in the area.  \n\nWould I come back? Sure, when I'm in the neighborhood.  Ritual is a great place to go for coffee after a weekend brunch or lunch when you want to socialize, but don't really have any plans in mind; I wouldn't necessarily make the trek here just for coffee though.", "author": "Kathy T."}

But it didn't stand out among the other coffee I've had by much. I got a latte. They made a pretty design out of cream on the top of my drink, which I appreciated, but taste-wise it wasn't as ~life changing~ as I expected. I should note that my cashier was fairly friendly and willing to recommend drinks, with me being a first timer and all.\n\nThe interior was minimal and airy. It had very high ceilings which make the space feel huge. As for seating, there was a fair amount, but the place was super crowded so I ended up having to stand at the \"bar\" area. Although some may like that set up, after walking around in the rain all day, all I wanted was a place to sit.\n\nBasically, I would recommend trying this place because 1) the coffee is totally fine and 2) it's another cafe you can put under your belt.

There you'll see that Ritual Coffee Roasters has popped up and taken full advantage of the lengthy vertical counter space to make artisan hand-brewed cups of coffee one at a time. It's a more relaxing set-up than Smitten because they scattered white patio furniture all around to make it feel like an outdoor lounge. On this particularly wintry afternoon, it felt more like a gulag prison yard, but the intent was spot-on.\n\nThey serve all the normal caffeine concoctions and four of their fair-trade blends described in detail on one clipboard sheet. I went for the most premium, the $5 cup of El Silencio from Colombia, which sounded like what I was looking for, a moment of solitude to sip my brew after a hearty burger at Chez Maman West. It was indeed \"candy-like\" as billed because it was infused with grape lollipops (no kidding), currants and vanilla. The sweet taste was subtle but nice. My heart still belongs to Philz for these kind of one-off coffees, but it's good to see an alternative to the line that forms just a few yards away down Linden Alley for Blue Bottle. Good stuff.\n\nCOFFEE - 4 stars...silky smooth, subtly sweet and hand-dripped for an eternity\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...I like the use of space around here, very communal yet private\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a perfect spot on a Saturday for lollygagging with your Kindle", "author": "Ed U."}

It was coffee with a fruity hint... maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to appreciate this, but it just tasted a bit strange to me.

It looks like a bungalow of some sort that opens up?  Interesting concept.\n- I kind of dig the little seating area.  It's very low maintenance - just a bunch of little chairs and abstract tables on a gravel surface", "author": "Cecilia S."}

Well, I decided to take a shot at proving my strength, jumped up for the bars, and promptly smashed by bloody shin into the steel frame hinge. I collapsed from the shock and pain, pulling my hand from the injury to see the skin imprinted and purple. I needed some ice, and fast!\n\nRitual Coffee came to the rescue, even bagging the ice for me and tying it off with a bow. Thanks to their compassion, I was able to sit curbside with the compress to my leg, and enjoy a deliciously crafted latte. Smooth espresso and densely foamed milk plus the cold pressure brought me back to life, and I was up and running through the grass field in a jiffy. \n\nMy boyfriend said that as he was waiting in line for the ice, the woman in front of him leveled a complaint at the barista. Customer: \"I ordered a soy latte.\" Barista 1: \"That is a soy latte\" Barista 2: \"Dang girl! That's a soy latte?! You are getting good!\" That's right folks, she steamed the milk so perfectly that the customer could not believe it was soy. Bravo Ritual Coffee, bravo.", "author": "Mars W."}

There was a short line, which gave us adequate time to check out the menu. My group of 4 ordered one macchiato, a cappuccino, and 2 drip coffees. I opted for the 75 cent increase for the more premium espresso in my cappuccino- which proved worth it, because it was sublime. So sweet and decadent it required no additional sweetener. The milk was rich and frothy and I loved the delicate foam art on top. \n\nWe loved the method they use to brew coffee. My husband and our pal stood and watched their coffee being brewed with amazement. The coffee was smooth, full bodied, and full flavored. I love the honest approach.\n\nThe interior was cute- sparse, modern, but with small touches of warmth. I highly regret not taking home a pound of their coffee. Southern California is so lacking in micro roasters like these. I ask you to step outside the norm and reach for something better in your cup, Ritual will not disappoint.", "author": "Sheena M."}

I must have been late to the party and didn't know exactly how to drink this coffee. First, it took forever to brew a simple cup of coffee, I don't like my coffee too complicated, but really? do I really need to watch someone pouring water into the grinded coffee bean ever so slowly? then I put some sugar in my coffee (big, big mistake), it didn't seem to taste like the coffee I normally had. I put more sugar in there, and it tastes the same. then I started to really enjoy the coffee with all it's fruitiness and flavors, which has been over-shadowed by the sugar and cream. but it's still there. \n\na few weeks later, I was attending a meeting at a building I don't normally go to. I was getting coffee before the meeting and saw somebody making coffee just the same way Ritual was and he offered to make me a cup to lure me to give up the peet's that's been sitting there since this morning. sure, why not? then this guy started to tell me all about coffee and for the first time I tasted coffee without cream or sugar, and it just totally reminded me of ritual and made me really miss it.

The surrounding area of boutiques, bars, and restaurants, trends to attract all walks of life for the delicious coffee. Not that I drink coffee at all, but the few coffee nuts I know swear by this place. The infamous Blue Bottle of the Bay area put to shame by this small time up and comer. \n\nAnyways the staff is pretty awesome. Very friendly and knowledgable and are cool to talk to.

Used to drinking $1-$2 coffee, I was alarmed at the prices of Ritual's pour-overs. $5 for a cup of coffee?! Absurd, I thought!\n\nBut I have come to realize that Ritual is worth every cent. I have tasted pour-overs from Blue Bottle (San Francisco), Four Barrel (San Francisco), Intelligentsia (Chicago), Bow Truss (Chicago), Gaslight (Chicago), and more, and the conclusion is always that Ritual is the best. The pour-overs are always light, subtle, and perfect. Ditch your sugar and cream, because you won't need or want it. Yes, they take awhile to make and yes, it's more expensive than Starbucks or Peet's, but the quality is the best. And if you're really in a rush, you can always go for one of the espresso drinks. I prefer pour-over, but the espresso-based drinks are good too.\n\nThey always have three pour-over options at three price points - $3, $4, and $5. The current coffee brews as of September 2013 are the Sibera ($3), El Angel ($4), and Los Ananos ($5). My favorite is by far El Angel, and due to the price, I prefer Sibera over Los Ananos.

I think Blue Bottle has an edge in espresso, but Ritual is a better place to sit down with a brewed coffee. Both do good pour-overs; I think Ritual uses Hario cones and Blue Bottle uses the Bonmacs with the small holes (easier to use if you want to pick one up for home use). Ritual also offers a rotating selection of single origin brewed coffees and espressos; I haven't noticed similar options at Blue Bottle. Blue Bottle sells smaller bags of beans to take home -- a good thing if it takes you a while to get through a bag.\n\nTry both. Get some ice cream as a palette cleanser.

The coffee is rather tart. They use the standard 'pour over' method, which is what I have been doing since Melitta sold the cones and filters in the '80s. Like any other filtered coffee, it lacks the richness that coffee oils impart, because the filters filter out those oils. The lines are long and other customers tend to just stand in the way while waiting for their coffees to be poured. The stand is in the middle of a parking lot with only a few outdoor seats. It is around the corner from Smitten, also packed with hipsters trying to get freeze dried ice cream. The beans themselves are splendid.

Which brings me to one suggestion:\n\nSignage.\n\nYeah I know we're going minimalist but a simple \"Order Here\" sign would be welcome and certainly would help the newbs figure out where they should begin a line.  Maybe even a request to step to the back would help said people from stacking up in front of where everybody else is trying to get their coffee.\n\nThe other gripe comes in that the drip coffee takes forever.  Not because it's drip coffee, mind you, but organizationally things are a bit off.  My pals on Valencia seem to be able to crank out my joe pretty swiftly regardless of crowd.  Here it took at least 15 minutes if not longer with the same amount of staff.  I actually nearly bailed on my order because it was taking so long.\n\nThe coffee thankfully is still top notch.

The lack of pretentiousness of this little Ritual Coffee Roasters stand was endearing, but maybe the in-your-face red color scheme just bothered my subconscious. I know that it's part of their brand image though, so this was just my subjectivity at play this time. I did appreciate that everything (staff appearance, equipment, cleanliness) seemed to be very orderly and neat though, so yay for the appearance of a well-run stand.\n\nStaff: 4/5. There were two people working there when my 2 other friends and I visited. The lady there greeted us warmly and proceeded to describe their unique coffee blends from different countries after we told her it was our first time. The guy there then proceeded to make our coffees and was nice enough to do some coffee foam art! (see picture :)). I always suspect it's ultimately the barista's choice when making an effort to create coffee foam art, so I'm always pleased to see it in my cup. It's definitely about appreciating the little things especially when I know the barista could've just whipped up any sort of formula & served it however he desired.\n\nMocha:\nBg: Since I try to only drink one cup of coffee a day on my off-days, I only had the chance to try their mocha. I knew I really should've tried their drip coffees and I was especially curious to taste Hondurian coffee beans again, but I just craved a mocha at the time. Here's the run down...\nRating: 3.5/5. My first impression of their mocha was a 2/5, but I later realized this was due to coming off the fresh trail of drinking the extra chocolatey mocha at a La Boulange the other day. Slowly sipping, I decided that this was a very well-made mocha because it's subtle and doesn't try to overwhelm you with the I'MMADEFROMCHOCOLATE/LOOKATME reaction. And if I were to drink mochas often, I think I would prefer to drink the one at Ritual more often than La Boulange's. And maybe with a more objective onset the next time I visit, I'll bump up the rating to a 4/5. It's not perfect, but it was still delicious.\n\nRandom comment: I noticed that the paper cup was completely unadorned w/ any kind of branding and in a weird way (is this how hipsters think... -__-) I appreciated it because it made them at least appear humble... making my wanting to support them as a local business.\n\nOverall: 3.5/5 w/ great willingness for a few more chances.

Strong but not over powering. Had some flavor to it too. The macaroon on the other hand had an awfully strange texture. Almost a little too moist but the coconut was toasted around it so good that it was all I tasted for about 15 minutes. It was great. I might just come back in the morning for one of those.", "author": "Greg G."}

Grab a duo cup and sit in the small seating area, or cross the bike oath and enjoy the park. Proxy is a fascinating temporary food set-up; let's hope it stays for a long time.", "author": "Greg P."}

Their teas are also good especially the elderflower one.  Their whole bean coffee brews great at home.  The ambiance in the coffee shop is great for hanging out, studying, or chatting with a friend.", "author": "Julie B."}

It was also nice to have a tea option. Like others have mentioned the signs can get hard to read if people are milling about the ordering area. There are a few tables nearby so you can relax over there and out of the way. Drip coffee always makes me feel a bit \"watched pot\" if you know what I mean. Swing around the other side to Smitten for ice cream. Nothing like hot and cold to set your teeth on fire.", "author": "Phoebe R."}

Looks good and always soooper smooth but lacks the punch of bb Hayes valley or some of the sight glass blends. Will keep trying though. Love their contribution to the Hayes valley neighborhood.", "author": "Rachel H."}

The Libertad sold me on a return visit I tried the Sao Benedicto. Subtle, medium body. Prepared to perfection. No burnt or acidic aftertaste. Friendly prompt service.

I was however disappointed by the coffee!  I am somewhat of a coffee snob and found their coffee barely drinkable after paying $4 for a cup.  If I go back to work, I might stick to just the pastries next time.", "author": "Elana R."}

Okay, I guess this will be a really good cup of coffee,  These guys pride themselves on their knowledge.  Well, SOMETHING went wrong. The cup of coffee was like bitter water. It looked like they used about 8 beans to make 12 oz. of coffee. I literally threw it away. It was that bad. And it made me really mad. Not what I want from a cup of coffee first thing in the morning! Three dollars down the drain.", "author": "Doug N."}

It is not enough to say \"the architects\" don't want trash collection in the common spaces, it's a matter of community responsibility.   While as a long term resident of Hayes Valley, it's great to see new businesses in the community, the people you serve have no interest in keeping our little park free of coffee debris.  And no, they are not going to bring their emptry paper cups back to you to dispose of.  Please use some common sense here and put out trash bins.  The architects have been contacted and there will be discussions.  In the meantime, a trash bin of your own, please.", "author": "Emerald O."}
