It's also hard for me to give less than 4 stars because I freaking love wine.  So unless they're pouring from a grackel of Gallo or tapping a space-bag of Franzia, I'm probably going to be happy no matter what.  So, 4 stars for Wine Bar & Shop.

We were looking to talk about wine and do some tasting and compare notes. I agree with the Roderick that this place has a distinctively Starbucks feel to it. For a place so generically decorated, the wines to taste were more diverse than I'd thought they'd be. I'd been in a few times before just to look at the wine and was surprised that they didn't carry more labels. That said, one of my companions found a French wine there that she'd been looking high and low for.\n\nWhen I walked in, I feared that there's be an 'attitude' and I'm the kind of person that will sometimes respond in kind. I was pleasantly surprised that the service had a softer edge to it. Our server wasn't sommelier level by any means but he was enthusiastic and shared opinions when asked. I wanted to try a wine that he hadn't had before and I had some questions. He went back for answers and tasted the wine himself. Well handled.\n\nNothing I tasted knocked my socks off and it wasn't up to the tasting experience that I've experienced at The Wine Steward in Pleasanton or at K&L but location counts! It's worth a try if after a long day at the office, you're too tired to shout over the drunk frat boys at Royal Exchange.", "author": "Brian B."}

Four hours she had to browse \"where I come alive after five\" lists, but when I met up and asked the inevitable question, she said, \"I guess I took you at your word when you said we could just wander around and find something.\"  Ooooh, crap, I did say that didn't I?  Not to worry, I know this wine bar.  \n\nAs mentioned by Alissa K., a certain friend of ours who lived for about a year in San Francisco \"became familiar\" with the guy who owns this place, but I didn't put two and two together.  Since I'd never met him it wasn't weird but I had a lot of fun surreptitiously enjoying the  surreptitious glances between Alissa and this guy.  Funny stuff.\n\nOh, you want to know about this place?  I forgot, sorry.  Full of very loud  30s something chicks.  Wine list is pretty good but kind of pricey.  The bar is made of white marble with yellow veins and its underlit so it kind of looks like its supposed to be white but someone smeared a bunch of weird stuff on it and it dried that way.  Alissa's glass was dirty.  My haut medoc was good and fun to say.  \n\nI'd avoid this place on a Friday after work if you want to have any semblance of a conversation.

But the big storefront-like windows out front give the place lots of great light, and there are a few tables out front to enjoy the weather on those nice SF days.\n\nThe menu has a good selection of wines (some pretty darn expensive ones and other more reasonably priced ones), and a nice offering of apps - cheese plates, meat plates, etc.  I found the service to be good but nothing particularly spectacular.  The place is quite roomy inside and tables are aplenty, so it's a good low-key place to meet up with friends (unlike the more hectic and/or tiny wine bars).\n\nWhile I just ordered a glass of wine, I hear that they have a great selection of wine at retail prices.

If you are looking for a place to put something decadent in your mouth while in the area, then go for it. But this is by no means a destination. \n\nHowever! They have a badass cheese plate. It's expensive as all get out, but if someone is treating then definitely try their array of cheeses. They switch out their offerings often, which is terrific. Currently their cheese choices are as follows:\n\nEmmental - Produced in Bern (valley of the Emme river), Switzerland this caved-aged cow's milk cheese is widely-known holes. A mild, yet full, nutty, fruity flavor finishes with a characteristic savory bite. Recommended with light fruity reds, but would pair well with a rose from Bandol.\n\n***Lamb Chopper - A new organic sheep's milk cheese from one of our favorites - Cypress Grove in Humboldt County (think Humboldt Fog). Several years in development, this cheese is aged for 3 to 4 months creating buttery, nutty and creamy flavors. Try this cheese with ripe, acidic white wines and fruity, light-bodied reds.\n\nPoint Reyes Original Blue - In production since 1959, this classic farmstead cow's milk blue from the bucolic Point Reyes, California is made within hours of milking and aged for a minimum of six months. The cheese's mild sharpness balances a sweetness that is the perfect foil to ripe and sturdy red wines, especially Zinfandel.\n\n***Morbier du Livradois - With a meadow-sweet aroma of nuts and hay this raw cow's milk Morbier by Livradois is most famous for incorporating both the morning and the evening milk of the cow, separated by a layer of ash. The rich taste and smooth texture are well suited to full bodied, aromatic white wines.\n\n***Ubriaco - The name itself literally means \"drunk.\" This delicious cow's milk cheese (pronounced oo-bree-AH-ko) is created by farmers in Piave, a region of Veneto. The unique Italian delight is preserved by immersing it in fermenting wine, bathed hours in the sweet mixture of Merlot, Cabernet and Raboso grapes. This cheese has a firm texture and a sharp, nutty taste scent. Perfect with just about any red, and of course, Merlot or Cabernet!\n\nPierre Robert - A rich triple cr\u00e8me cheese, invented by Rouzaire, is named after Robert Rouzaire and his son Pierre. Similar Explorateur-from the Seine-et-Marne district near Paris, Pierre Robert is made in a small wheel and ripens to a perfect buttery texture with a tangy bite not often found in this style of cheese. Perfect with any wine from Champagne to red Bordeaux.\n\nNot bad, eh? If cheese and wine is your thing, and money and ambiance is no issue, then Wine works. Oh, and you can always find a seat.

It felt more like a small coffee shop than perhaps how a wine bar should feel like.  I had the opportunity to taste a couple of wines, and did find the Two Angels Sauvignon Blanc to be very tasty!  When I asked the gentleman serving this drink, he was knowledgable about this wine, and knew offhand how much it costs and how many they have left on-hand.  Since we were going somewhere else after this place, I decided to just look up the wine later.  Then after checking bevmo online, I had found it at BevMo for about 75% of the price there.

It's a lot of what you want in a fun, professional-type wine bar, and leaves behind most of the ridiculous pretense that can plague a wine only establishment. \n\nWINE has three big things going for it:\n\n1. It's never overly crowded. This is an extremely under-rated attribute, especially in a wine bar where you WANT conversation to be easy and audible. There is also enough staff to handle your needs and actually take the time to explain nuances between wines or cheeses while you converse and decide. They have tables for larger groups and the bar itself, depending on what you need. This is a great thing for people who like the area and the atmosphere around Royal Exchange but want something more intimate. \n\n2. It has good wine. Both in volume and in quality, these folks know what they are talking about and what to pour. They also have numerous tastings and samplings (is that a word?) so you know what you are getting when you order. They also recommend well priced and good tasting wines, not just what is most expensive. I have been encouraged to try a $25 bottle over a $60 on more than one occasion because the staff felt it was of a much better value and taste. They are also getting new bottles in every week, the wine list is ever evolving--this makes it nice for people who want to learn about wine, not just get wasted one night. \n\n3. The staff is unbeatable. Mark, the owner, has done an excellent job in hiring staff who know their stuff. The proof is apparent when almost all of them drink at WINE during their time off, tasting and researching the new wines for when they are back on the clock. They are also friendly and outgoing, making a possibly stuffy atmosphere fun and light. If you are truly new to the wine drinking business (or have just never taken the time to research), ask for their personal recommendations, and let them walk you through the possibilities. Furthermore, all are willing to stay late and share a glass instead of adhere to a strict closing time schedule (i.e. you will never here the line \"I'm off the clock, so try to finish up\"). \n\nWine will be great for 80% off the wine drinkers out there. 10% will think the decor/space not quite \"professional\" enough or the wine selection quite extensive enough, the other 10% wouldn't know a good wine place if it wasn't a box of Franzia at a Frat house kegger. For the most part, this place gets it exactly right.  \n\nAs for its faults, they need a dedicated bathroom for both men and women.

The owner was in and chatted with us a bit. Our crisp white wine and cheese plate were perfect on a rare hot SF day.\n\nSecond visit was a touch off. They were out of one of the wines we orders and one of the cheeses. But they comped us for the replacements. So no stars lost there. I did, however, knock off a star for the tiny, tiny glasses they use for the tasting flights. Tiny bubbles=good. Tiny glasses=not so much.(Hadn't noticed it the last time because we ordered full glasses.)\n\nSo on my third trip, we popped in for a glass of wine before a movie. It was kind of busy but definitely not slammed, and there were three people working the bar. We sat for 20 minutes without being acknowledged, finally grabbed menus from a nearby table, and eventually went to the bar to order. Even then it took awhile to get our drinks. It was like we were bothering them. There were no apologies for the shoddy service. Same deal when we wanted to pay and leave. We had to flag someone down. \n\nIf the place were really fabulous, I'd give it another shot, but it's just mediocre. Given the numerous fantastic wine bars in the city, there's no room for just okay. Wine has a decent wine list and nibbles, but in a coffee shop atmosphere with very spotty service. No thanks.

Easy to get a table, even for a group of 4. No reservations needed.\r\n\r\n2. Volume level inside is moderate..  easy enough to carry on a conversation without yelling.

Large selection of wine to choose from either by the bottle, glass (6 oz.), taste (3 oz) or flight ($40-ish). Low $12 corkage fee if you select a bottle from their wall of wines which range from $15 and up.\r\n\r\n4. Location and parking are easy. If no street parking is available, you can always park in the Golden Gateway garage across the street for about $6 for 2 hours.\r\n\r\n5.

This was the second time I have gone wine tasting at this wine bar.  The first time I went was a couple months after the merchant opened; I was not impressed with the prices or the services.  However, since I was meeting my friend briefly I figured we can stop there since it was a block from her work.  Usually the first impression says a lot but I gave this place a second chance and again wasn't so impressed.  My sister experienced a rude server when she was waiting for my friend and I to show up advising the table she was sitting at was intended for a party of three or more to sit at.  My sister made it clear to the server she was expecting two more people.  Well when I got there my sister told me what had happened, I checked my phone to see that my friend had text me advising she would be running 15 minutes late.  As a courtesy my sister and I decided to sit at the bar.  I had a hard time figuring out what type of red I wanted to order for a tasting; I couldn't stop looking at how much the prices were for a 3 oz tasting.  Some of these prices for a tasting I could purchase a glass of wine at any 'fine dining' restaurant.  My sister also thought about purchasing a bottle of wine thinking we would save on the tasting however they Wine Bar and Shop charges a $12.00 cork fee; um this is not a restaurant where you bring your own bottle of wine.  You're actually purchasing their wine and they charge a cork fee?  I'm sorry I don't think so.  When my friend showed up, we sat back the same table where my sister was originally sitting; we all order two different tasting.  Our bill was over $30.00; very annoyed I realized I can't come to this place anymore.  The LWB located in the Fugazi building was always a delight to go to.  Unfortunately they are no longer in business.  The prices were better, the service was fantastic and the energy was all good.  The next time I decide to go wine tasting or drink a glass of wine I will go to the Wine Merchant at the Ferry Building, the service is great; they're helpful and knowledgeable about the wines.  They even ask you for help and check up on you after you have order to make sure everything is okay.  Plus I would get more for my bank than I would at The Wine bar. I was disappointed with the atmosphere, the energy, and the prices.", "author": "Liz D."}

That being said, I've never been more irritated and put off during a night out than I was at Wine this past Thursday. We decided to get a glass of wine before catching a movie at the Embarcadero, and after arriving at Wine, sat around waiting for 20 minutes for someone (anyone) to come over to our table to take our order. The bar was neither crowded, or understaffed. In fact, there were three guys behind the bar, but they seemed more interested in chatting with their friends or doing whatever the hell else they were doing. I finally got fed up and went to the bar to place my order. We received our order shortly thereafter to the credit of the waiter who served us, but the cheap ass wine glasses that are reminiscent of first class on an airplane are hardly the best choice for enjoying wine. Maybe I'm missing something here, or maybe it's just some stupid kitschy thing I'm missing out on, but when I drink wine, I'd prefer to have it in an appropriate glass. In any case, thanks to the shitty indifferent service, I doubt I'll make a return visit anytime in the near future, and I'll be sure to tell my fellow wine-loving friends to save their money for a place like Hidden Vine or Hotel Biron where service actually matters. \n-------------------------------------------\nOLD REVIEW: Have been here on several occasions - and it has never disappointed. Perfect for a glass or two of wine before or after a movie at the Embarcadero Theatre. They have a good selection of by-the-glass wines from various regions, and the atmosphere is mellow and allows for good conversation.  They also have a section where you can buy wine by the bottle, which is perfect if you happen to enjoy your menu pick.", "author": "Chris B."}

Wine, beer, yummy cheese plates and other tasty food to nosh on while you sample different wines or beers. They sell wine by taste, glass or bottle. You can even buy a bottle to go. Which came in handy during the holidays last year while looking for a nice gift for the boss. On my last visit they were so busy, we found a seat along the curve of the velvet couch. Our waiter was really nice. We opted to try Chardonnay. It's starting to get a better rap lately. My friend tried a buttery oak type, I tried a non buttery oak type from a steel barrel that I actually enjoyed. No sasafrass, just simple and clean (like the wine bar!). It was crisp just like our waiter described. He let me try a taste first, and when I decided to order it, brought me a fairly large goblet. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but it was nice and refreshing and not too fruity as I'd feared.  My friend and I wondered if that was the proper glass for white wine for a split second but who cares? It was a nice night! I'd visit again for sure!", "author": "Christy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-15", "description": "I adore this place first and foremost because it is so unpretentious (hard to find in this town) and secondly because they always feature an interesting selection from which I've tried many new wines I'd have never tried otherwise. It's where I had my most euphoric un-oaked Chardonnay experience, actually. The service could be better and they could lighten up their bar bites. But this isn't a Michael Mina enterprise, just a lovely little after-work haunt you might find in any town in any part of the country and I guess that's why I like it so much.", "author": "Sheri E."}

Really - like a lot better.  Let's start with the service.  Words that come to mind are: indifferent, inconsistent and distracted. None of those are good words when associated with service people I think you would agree.  Then there is the atmosphere which as other reviewers have pointed out is very shopping mall store front.  The weird thing is that this is so obviously a shopping mall storefront you would have thought the owners would have *tried* to go with decor choices that juxtaposed that? But no, they went with light wood veneers and industrial tables and lighting - sort of Ikea on steriods.  So the resulting atmosphere is cold and store-like (it IS indeed a store as well, so whatever) and a bit loud and offputting.  The new outdoor seating section is a tremendous improvement as far as I am concerned and maybe will improve the feel of the place.  But all that being said, I am glad it is there because 1) the wines are diverse and interesting if not always knock it out of the park fantastic, and 2) it is a great place to have a glass, some rocking cheeses (did I mention the cool cheese plates - I do like those very much) AND then pick up a bottle to go to the dinner party you are your way too.  A great addition to the Embarcadero Center choices which tend toward the chain restaurant direction and lack any style whatsoever. I would take this place over many of the neighborhood options any day. If they solve the service issues, I would bump this to a 4 star no problem....", "author": "Kirsten M."}

The friendly, knowledgeable staff are spot-on with what they think I'll enjoy so I always let them choose the wine for me. It is a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for with the generous pours and fabulous cheese plates. Ask your server to suggest a cheese (or two or three) to pair with your wine and you won't be sorry! The tables are nice for conversation, but if you're alone or in a pair, sit at the bar and learn something you didn't know about wine or join in with the ever-present witty banter between the servers. If you're in a group, sit at the comfy, round loungy table next to the bar and enjoy a little buffer from the noise as the place fills up with the after-work financial district crowd. Don't like the music playing? Tell them what you want to hear and they probably have it no matter how obscure the request. Wine's a great spot. Give it a try and maybe I'll see you there!", "author": "Jen G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-27", "description": "I have been coming here since it opened. It is not perfect, but it has 40 wines by the glass or half glass that changes each week. Other raters here said that it is too small, but it is bigger than most wine bars in San Francisco. 70 people could fit inside and about another 20 outside. It is very nice inside with paintings and usually pleasant music. I have seen people denounce the Press Club for being too big, at 9,000 square feet. \"Wine\" is at least average size for a San Francisco wine bar. Also, it is near the Embarcadero BART Station, and major bus lines. Also, one gets FREE parking for 4 hours with just a $5 validation which is almost unheard of in San Francisco.", "author": "Howard S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-12-07", "description": "Ok, my review may be somewhat influenced by the fact that a very big (and somewhat neurotically pushy) group of wine lovers were gathering at this venue the first night I tried it out.  But other patrons notwithstanding, the space is not nearly as warm or inviting (i.e. stay for hours and forget the time/date/year) as the LWB.  They did have a good wine selection and I can't complain about the cheese plate (plus the vegetarian antipasto plate was a welcome and worthy recommendation).  There are some Hayes & Vine flashbacks but it is an alternative for those who want some drinky drink but aren't willing to battle the Royal Exchange/Harrington's happy hour madness.", "author": "Anjali K."}

Ever since Greg and Gretchen have left the place is not the same.  The new management is not friendly and they have raised the prices.  The wine selection isn't as good as it used to be.  There are a lot of wine bars in SF that are a better choice (Local Kitchen and Wine Merchant when Carl is working).", "author": "Heidi H."}

The wine and cheese selection is fabulous.  I came here for a glass of vino before I took the GMAT and I think it helped me get an awesome score.  They validate parking for the garage underneath, so this is a great spot to visit if you are driving into SF from the burbs.", "author": "olivia s."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-11-12", "description": "10 person wait staff and nobody would respond to my frantic waving from the bar.  Finally,a haughty waiter with a frown to match appeared bothered and bewildered.  Wine list was predominantly foreign.My friend and I tried to get a second glass of wine, to no avail.  Getting the check was equally as difficult.  When I asked one of the wait staff (our waiter had since disappeared) for our check (as we were trying to get to a movie), she told me \"Relax, this is a wine bar\".  Ok, but we still need to pay.  The place caters to private groups tucked behind a short wall  and customers buying wine.  I will not return as there are far superior wine bars in our town.", "author": "lori f."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-11-13", "description": "I have been here a few times after work with friends and each time I am less impressed.  They do have interesting wines and a large number open to taste.  However, the prices are very high.  I guess that is a function of the real estate.  The service is very poor.  Sometimes you can wait 20 minutes just to get the wine list.  Surprised no one else seems to have mentioned this, but in the evenings when the place can get full the noise level is outrageous.  The place is nothing but hard surfaces and the sound bounces around and never stops.", "author": "Alan R."}
