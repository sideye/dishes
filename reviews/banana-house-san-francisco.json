Granted it was Labor Day, so that is to be expected, but luckily Banana House was open. They greeted us at the door and were very friendly and attentive. We shared the Pad Thai with chicken and upgraded to a combo which comes with a salad, rice and egg roll. Then I added peanut sauce, because I like to dip things in there. The portion was generous enough for us to share, and we pretty much finished off the plate. The Pad thai had a good taste, but was not spicy. We could have added more heat, but ended up incorporating the peanut sauce, which was delish. The peanut sauce had a smooth consistency but packed a good peanut flavor. The egg roll was tasty too. Overall it was a good place to stop by for lunch.", "author": "Sandra V."}

I always have super high expectations for desserts since I have such a large sweet tooth, but I typically raise my expectations for any mango dessert because... well mangoes are amazing and are my absolute favorite fruit!\n\nAll in all, this mango sticky rice wouldn't be something that I would pay for again. Maybe if they decreased the price (I honestly expected a bill of $4-5 max for a dish that small, but I was charged almost $8 not including tip!). My main issue with this dessert is the price though. The actual dish tasted fine - mangoes were sweet, even though it was a small portion size, and the sticky rice was perfectly cooked and had a really nice marriage with the coconut milk that it was mixed with. Again, I have to stress the fact that the small portion size and the fact that the dish wasn't THAT extraordinary made me think that it was not worth the price that I paid. \n\nIn terms of the restaurant experience, it wasn't bad. Servers were prompt and polite, though not the friendliest group. There's lots of seating in the restaurant, so I'd expect there not to be a huge wait at any time.\n\nOverall, there just wasn't super memorable about my experience at Banana House.

I've had this place, along with several other Belden Place establishments, bookmarked for months.  Although they were busy, I was determined to tough it out and try their lunch takeout. \n\nFirst of all, they are available on the Eat24 app.  Yay!  I'm a big fan of punching in an order and having it delivered or ready for pickup.  (Next time I'll remember this!)  The takeout ordering area is pretty much non-existent, so online/app ordering is certainly the way to go.  After I placed my order I stood outside to make way for dining room patrons.  There really isn't a waiting area option here.\n\nMy order was taken promptly and my takeout order popped up in about 7 minutes.  \n\nWhile I waited, I watched the line chefs and wait staff frantically buzz about.  These folks are quick and on the ball!  I did overhear a frazzled single dining-in customer complain about slow service and other takeout customer complain about long wait times.  Personally, I wasn't in a rush, so I found the entire process to be fair.  \n\nI went with #31 with chicken, param with steamed chicken, broccoli, and carrots.  The peanut sauce was packed alongside rice (choice between brown or white) and a small salad.  The sauce was excellent and the steamed meal was even better.  In an area filled with authentic speedy Asian food it was such a welcome relief to find a mean that wasn't fried, drenched in oil, or overly heavy.  The tiny salad on the side was a nice touch.\n\nI will certainly be back for pad see ew, curry, papaya salad, and pad thai.

Preferably a quiet place, but not empty, and with seating. This was the place, and the fact that it was Thai I considered a bonus.  \n  \nThere was one other customer inside, at a window table. He was a middle-aged businessman, engaged more with his phone than anything else.  He left before he finished. It seemed like a work-day kind of place, unpretentious. Un-touristy.  \n  \nThe menu was printed in plain text on a white laminated sheet. Numbers next to the names of the dishes. I was offered a cup of ice water. There was no beer. I ordered #35 Pad Kra Pao (ground chicken in spicy garlic sauce with beans, onions, bell peppers, basil) because I wanted a meat dish, and I was looking for some inspiration for what to do with ground chicken at home.  \n  \nMy phone battery was dipping so I mostly watched the traffic go by while I waited. Nobody else came in during my visit and the staff talked among themselves while the cook worked. The street is interesting, short buildings with tall office towers rising behind them from the other side of the block. An adequate supply of pigeons.  \n  \nThe food arrived shortly. The ground chicken with vegetables were in a small bowl with the sauce, and a mound of rice was presented on another dish. I pressed down the mound and added the pad kra pao to it for each bite, and found it a satisfying meal. The sauce was delicious, I wanted more before I was done. At length I ordered a Coke to supplement, and it was served as an unopened can with a cup of ice.  \n  \nOverall I had a good experience here. The menu had something that interested me, it wasn't too busy, and although the presentation was basic, it advertised itself as Thai food, and it tasted like Thai food. I got the feeling there might be a restaurant in Thailand that would not be too dissimilar to this one.

The restaurant is cute: white table clothes atop little tables, wood walls, big windows. The wait staff is nice, fast, and attentive.\n\nI get the lunch special Green Chicken Curry and my friend gets the Duck Curry, both are very good and filling. The meal starts off with a small cabbage soup, then comes your plate with salad, brown or white rice, and your main dish, full of bell peppers, tender chicken, green curry sauce, eggplant, and basil. They have chopped peanuts, chili peppers, and hot sauce to add kick to your dish. I like to add a little hot sauce to the cabbage soup since it's kind of mild and bland.\n\nKnocked off one star because it's a little pricey for an Asian-style lunch special (I'm used to $6-$8 for lunch spesh): around $11 per meal, but since the food is good and likely healthier than getting a sandwich or pizza, it's a go-to spot for me. Lunch takes around 20 minutes or so once you're sitting down, so plan accordingly if you're like me and have a measly half hour for lunch.", "author": "Crystal C."}

I feel like boba places and other restaurants are very heavy handed with the sugar or syrup that is in the teas. I didn't even have to ask this place to half the sugar.

The thai curry was pretty good, and being their only customer, service was fast!\n\nYelp did not have check-in's back then, and I did not really care to remember where I ate. Three years down the line, I suddenly remembered this place, but couldn't, for the life of me, figure out where it was and what it was called. I only vaguely remembered the interiors of this place, but knew absolutely nothing else about it.\n\nWTF Yelp, why can't you get into my head and tell me about the restaurant I am thinking of! Their search team needs to get their act together and index my brain!\n\nAnyways, last week, as I was making my way down to Enjoy Vegetarian in Chinatown, a sudden pang of laziness directed me into the nearest decent-looking restaurant, and lo and behold.. I had finally found it !!!\n\nI consider music and restaurants to be things that people associate memories to, and then irrationally like or dislike based on how their lives were going when they initially encountered it. For example, I really love Rainforest Cafe in Fisherman's Wharf because I had first visited it whilst on an epic vacation with my friends back in 2008. I don't care how bad or overpriced their food might be today, that place will always be one my favorite places in the city because of all the great moments it can remind me of!\n\nSimilarly this place takes my mind outside its current petty worries and tribulations, and make it consider the past 3 years of my life as a whole. As they say, fruit flies like a banana! A lot happens over 3 years, and most of it seems to have been for good!

You're not going to ever stop me from going into a Thai place. It was decent inside, standard decor, but I'm ready for the fare.\n\nWe started with their spring rolls, which were very different from any other place. The texture was similar to an a Filipino Lumpia, very crepe like. It was surprising, to get that instead of the traditional fried or fresh rice noodle wrap. I had a bite of the pad thai, which was good, rich in flavor and having it's own unique touch from this place.\n\nHowever, I concentrated on the dish Traffic Jam. It's a dish that has all three curry styles; regular, red, and green.  What's wonderful about this dish is that you can literally go from one curry flavor to another and each time refresh your pallet with an amazing new flavor. It's genius! One minute, I thought green was my favorite, then it was red. Amazingly confusing to have them side by side like that. For several bites, I was loving the green, it's a little sweeter and tart compared to the other two, but when I switched back to red, I'm sold, throw in the towel, I'm a red curry kind of guy. This was so much fun to eat. The regular curry flavor was my least favorite, that's not to say it wasn't good, just not my favorite compared to red.

It's spice level was perfect and exactly what I would expect from a Thai dish, just enough to sizzle your tongue a little but not enough to over power the fresh Thai basil and peppers.  I should mention that I love spicy food.  If you're sensitive to spice, you might find it very spicy. \n\nI made the order a combo for $4.50, which comes with a side of thai salad, an eggroll, and a drink (I got Thai tea).

After several minutes of awkwardness they ended up charging me the right price. But the damage had been done. \n\nWe brought our food back to the office and it was bad.

Reservations for five at Banana House is what we come up with.\n\nTaking advantage of their Weekday Lunch Special (any order of curry or Banana House plates come with an order of rice, fried wonton skins, and a side salad with peanut sauce), I had the Pumpkin Curry, soft pumpkin in spicy red curry sauce with tofu ($7.95), as recommended by Kam O.  It was tasty and had lots of pumpkin and tofu in this dish, with a nice spiciness to heat it up as well.  I think if the pumpkin was cooked a little longer, it would taste even better.  It wasn't exactly what I call \"soft pumpkin\".  \n\nMy colleagues had the Gang Dang, red curry in coconut milk with bamboo shoots, bell peppers, and basil with tofu ($7.95); Yellow Curry, yellow curry in coconut milk with onion, carrot, and potato with chicken ($7.95); Prik Khing, sauteed string beans in spicy sauce with basil and bell peppers with tofu  ($7.95); and the Seafood Curry, prawns, calamari, and mussels in red curry in coconut milk with basil and bell peppers ($8.95).  There was also an order of Thai tea ($1.95) as well.  Everyone finished their lunch, or took home the leftovers.  It was a nice comfort food for the dreary weather outside.\n\nMy colleagues arrived at the restaurant before I did and were seated downstairs.  As I made my way there, the waitress handed me the menus and directed me to bring it to my table.  Wtf?  Too lazy I guess.  I orders arrived VERY quickly and we appreciated that, especially with it being a weekday lunch.  However, soon after our dishes arrived, our check came too.  Now, we all know what that feels like.  They just can't get rid of you fast enough, I guess.  It wasn't super busy for a 12 noon lunch, and there was plenty of seating still available downstairs when we left at 12:40.  \n\nWe were actually very surprised with how quickly our food arrived and how fast we finished lunch.  With 20 minutes to spare, we took our time heading back to the office.  They also play Wild 94.9's Wild Workout at Noon downstairs, so I wasn't sure if I wanted to eat or dance around.  Maybe that's why we ate so fast, with music like that, how can you not?  Then again, this place has made me want to do my power walks at noon again.  Now, if only I can find one of those Walkmans with radios! \n\nTotal bill, tax and tip included: $53.00\n\nUpdate! 12.05.07 - Went back again, but this time I had the Gang Keaw with chicken ($7.95), \"green curry in coconut milk with eggplant, zucchini, basil and bell pepper with chicken, tofu or prawns.\"  Pretty tasty stuff, and lots of eggplant and tofu.  I like to pour out all the curry on my rice so I can enjoy all the sauce!  Mary C. had the Pad See Ew ($7.95), \"pan-fried rice noodle with egg and broccoli; choice of chicken, pork, beef, or tofu.\"  I enjoyed this dish too, and usually Mary C. has leftovers, but this time she finished it all herself!  Good stuff and loaded with broccoli! \n\nIt does get busy around the 12:30 mark, so head in there early.  It's hard to get the waitress's attention when you're sitting downstairs as well.  But the food does come out quickly and it's a pretty good deal.  Can't beat that for a weekday lunch!\n\n(You can find pics of our recent eating in the business profile!)", "author": "Teri C."}

Unfortunately, the crepe was not fresh but rather hard around the edges, difficult to bite off -not soft as one would expect for crepes.  Plating was also sloppy and there was only 1 other couple in the restaurant besides us - not a full house.  The Pad Woon Sen was very tasty but very spicy, and I thought how odd that the waitress did not bother to ask how spicy we would like our food.  The best dish for the entire evening were the mangoes, which were fragrant and just perfect in ripeness!  They covered up for the sweet rice that fell sorely flat, a clump of mess, a day or two old and embarrassed to be next to a delicious fruit.

A full day's worth of interview pretty much drains anyone emotionally, but we are kind enough creatures as to offer a decent lunch to people whom we might decide to hire.   One of my coworkers suggested Banana House since I veto'ed Osha Thai before anyone even had a chance to mention the name.   Since I'd never been here before, I was happy to acquiesce.\n\nThe decor leaves a helluva lot to be desired.  This place, with a small and very crowded upstairs and a slightly more spacious downstairs (though beware if you're claustrophobic because you're eating in the basement!)  We took a table downstairs and I ordered the Gang Traffic Jam, a curry combo with red curry, yellow curry, and green curry.  I made it a combo lunch, which includes a Thai Iced coffee and some egg rolls.\n\nI must say the dish was very tasty, with extremely generous portions, and I think the quality is far superior to what you get at Osha Thai.   Next time I'm looking for good Thai food for lunch I'll certainly be heading this way from now on.   In short, if you're into decor and trendiness, go to Osha Thai.

It is one of the few places we have found in the financial district that can ALWAYS accomodate our group of 10, without any wait.  The downstairs seating area is their secret weapon in being able to do this.\n\nI really have no complaints about Banana House.  The food is pretty good, and the prices are reasonable.  The service is decent, although their kitchen seems to be on the smaller side because we are usually served two plates at a time, every couple minutes or so, until the entire group is served.  It takes a little while, but they have been very consistent over our many visits.\n\nFor entrees, I'd recommend the Yum Talay \"Salad.\"  It's a refreshing salad of silver noodles and a tangy chili/lime dressing, served with pieces of calamari, mussels, and prawns.  I've also enjoyed the Chicken Cashew Nuts, as well as the standard Chicken Pad Thai.  An added bonus is when they play old episodes of Mr. Bean on the downstairs television.", "author": "Tim N."}

Mostly doing a lot of waiting.\n\nSee, compared to many of the lunch spots in the area, Banana House is painfully slow; We waited around 25 minutes between ordering and eating, and it's even worse when your table is right by the entrance to the kitchen area and the waitresses walk by you with plate after plate of food. They almost appear to want to say to you \"Check out this steaming plate of Pra Ram Chicken that someone else is going to enjoy! And I wonder who's gonna get this delicious looking Pad Thai? Not you! Sorry!\"\n\nWhen your food finally arrives, you may find that they make a pretty good plate of Pad Kee Mao, plenty spicy and a less greasy than you'll find at a lot of places. The basic chicken salad isn't anything out of the ordinary, except that they make a tasty peanut salad dressing. \n\nI could be persuaded to come here again.

And, having sampled pumpkin curry at many Thai restaurants, I think the pumpkin curry at Banana is, well, solid (there's that word again).  I always order the pumpkin curry with tofu, because frying tofu is something I think they do especially well at this establishment; it's perfectly braised and tender with a thin golden skin.  \n\nAdditional solid menu items include: spicy catfish (actually spicy!), pad thai, pad see u, and, as mentioned above, the pumpkin curry.  I'm curious about the fried eggplant and the papaya salad, but I've somehow not gotten around to trying these things, though I'm sure I will since this place is on my lunch venue circuit.  That tells you something there.\n\nThe appetizers are not worth it here from my experience- they're basically a selection of things straight from the freezer to the fry basket, and despite the dexterity shown with the tofu, the fried calamari and fried corn patty appetizers (more patty than corn) are seriously OILY, a sensation I think caused by the oil not being hot enough during the frying.  And this is coming from a person that likes oily things.  Really.\n\nIn closing I'd just like to say that this is a satisfactory lunch time eating experience.  It is not, however, THAI FOOD TO DIE FOR, nor is it as good as Osha.

It's all really more than a simple cowboy lawyer ought to be able to ask for.  Case in point: in law school, I met a woman who was an Ivy League grad, former political science professor, and now a classmate.  And she worked with me in the hallowed halls of the DOJ (local division), trying to make the world a better place.  And she LOVED Thai food.  They serve a lot of that in Boston, apparently, not so much back where I come from.  She made it her personal mission to educate me about the wonders of Thai food, and in the course of several dozen lunches, I became a fan.  We had our last Thai lunch when she was amazingly pregnant, and before I moved (never to see her again), I got to meet her daughter, who was at that time 5, and who apparently loved Thai food as well, likely from all the neonatal doses ingested by her mother in my presence.\n\nBy the way, that story makes me feel old just telling it.\n\nMy standard for measuring Thai food is the duck curry.  If the restaurant doesn't have it, or has only mock duck, I'm dubious right out of the gate.  Banana House has a great duck curry, and from that I deduce that they have other great foods, although I've never had anything else, because when you can have great duck curry, why have anything else?\n\nAnd it is the blessing (and curse) of the particular functioning of my memory that every time I sit down to a big bowl of delicious duck curry, I think about Robyn, and I wonder how big her daughter is now, and I remember where I was in my life when we first ate duck curry together.

With lot's of deli choices this seemed like a good option for a warm and filling lunch in the FiDi. However, a trip to this restaurant had to be meticulously planned. The service is very slow so even in the off hours. If I planed on eating in, I didn't bank on making an hour turn around for lunch. For take-out I have to call ahead, even if the restaurant is empty. When I've order a dish with a sauce base, they gave me the sauce and the veggies/ect. in two separate containers so I had to have a bowl or other dish to mix it together at my office. \n\nAll this planning just wasn't worth it as the food is way greasier than it needs to be, the noodles are always over done and stuck to each other, the veggies always seem a bit soggy and the tofu is mushy and either cooked in too much oil or not drained well enough. \n\nOn an upside, it's clean and reasonably priced and the chicken satay is good.", "author": "Arela R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-02-28", "description": "This place is for people who were born without tastebuds.  That's the only reason I can think a body would want to give this place repeat service.  I am not complaining or angry or pissed at them.  I am just out and out horrified.\n\nIt's not that I'm a snob.  Ok, maybe just a little.  But I came to this place expecting perfectly mediocre thai food.  Which I sometimes crave.  And knowing it's going to be perfectly ok, I expect nothing, and sometimes I am slightly surprised.  I thought, hmm... thai place I always pass by on the way to work, cute decor, looks like they have a lunch crowd, looks like they've got repeat customers, maybe I'll finally check it out.\n\nSo I did.  Got a mango curry special with an offering of miniscule extras:  pixie sized bowl of soup, iceberg slathered in peanut \"dressing\" and a single spring roll.  Spring roll, very mediocre, as per expectation.  Maybe a little crispier than I thought, but taste wise, a study in the mundane.  Iceberg in peanut sauce... pushing the border from mediocre to just plain bad, but whatev, I like peanut sauce, even the boring kind.  But the curry?  OH DEAR GOD!   What happened?\n\nFirstly, people, curry is not rocket science.  You grind a bunch of choice, very specific ingredients in a food processor or mortar and pestle if you wanna get hardcore, but either way, the hard part is all done once you got the curry paste.   After that, you got your shallots, palm oil, fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, maybe a kaffir lime leaf or two, and your motherf---kin coconut milk.  Coconut milk is like the mother of all excuse ingredients.   Flunk your final?  Pour some coconut milk on it.  Accidentally piss in the soup?  Pour some coconut milk on it.  Coconut milk is like god's creamy creamy jizz.  Seriously people, this sh-t is not EASY to f--k up.  IT'S HARD.\n\nGranted, I have a very good palate.  But it's very tolerant of other flavors that are not so interesting.   It appreciates the good that often comes masked in the very bad.  But this- salty, bland, oily, utterly devoid of any kind of flavor?  WHAT DID YOU DO?  I want to know so I can recreate this to splash in the face of my enemies.\n\nOf course I was hungry, so I tried to swallow my sorrow and eat around the curry.   You know how you're usually supposed to try to eat things WITH curry?  I picked out my veggies, shook them off, and made do.  I will say this.  Veggies and tofu, perfectly acceptable.  Mango chunks, actually of exceptional quality... well not exceptional... more like the harry and david's of mediocrity.  Yeah.. couldn't eat that curry.  Good thing there wasn't much of it.  And between that and the rice, I was actually able to eat my way to not hungry anymore.  If there had been delicious curry I might have even considered it a meal worth eating.  I also forgot to mention that I got a somewhat bland thai iced tea as part of the \"combo.\"  Unfortunately, the service... kinda poor as well.  Didn't get any water till i asked for some at the end of the meal.  I, personally, don't really care much about service, but maybe somebody will.\n\nWell.   That concludes this review.  I have covered just about everything.   I hope this will convince you not to go.  It's not that eating bad thai food is such a horrible experience.  It's that giving repeat service to an actual bad thai food place is incredibly unnecessary when there are so many perfectly mediocre thai places around.  Heck, maybe someday you may even want to upgrade from mediocre to good!\n\nOh and for those of you who love this place, I am especially sorry.  The world is so much more interesting when you can taste things.", "author": "Zoobs L."}

These dishes come without rice, by the way.\nI thought my boyfriend's chicken tasted kind of bland, but maybe that was because my dish was crazy salty.

I guess I am used to \"normal\" places where they have normal sized containers. They charged $1.50 for rice, but came out to $10.25. I guess you can't expect too much eating downtown.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-08", "description": "Banana House's menu impressed me, but its execution disappointed me.  The well-organized menu contains quite a variety of dishes and combinations beyond the standard Thai options available in the Bay Area, plus they have specials, and the descriptions leave your mouth watering.\n\nThe taste of the food, however, left something to be desired.  I ordered cashew chicken, which is my barometer for judging a Thai restaurant, since this was a favorite dish to eat while in Thailand and Thai places around Asia.  \n\nIn Banana House's version of cashew chicken served to me, some of the onions were undercooked, while the others were nearly flavorless.  Several hours later I still tasted the onion in my mouth.  Also, BH used white onion instead of the red onion that normally comes with cashew chicken.  \n\nThe presence of chilis in the dish added no perceptible heat, which was disappointing.  Pineapple was also added to the dish, but it didn't add much taste because it was either overcooked or came from a can.\n\nAs for the sides that came with my lunch special, the salad dressing was far too sweet.  The fried wonton wrappers were my favorite part of the meal: thin & crispy, almost to the point of melting in your mouth; however, these were provided more as a garnish, not in a quantity sufficient to thoroughly enjoy.\n\nOn the plus side, Banana House does have fairly ample seating (we found a seat for two at 1230pm), and isn't too loud or chaotic, so you can meet here, sit, and have a conversation while you eat.  Good for friends and same-level colleagues.  Not too romantic, but space is cozy, so you can easily end up in close proximity to your companion, if that's what you're after. \n\nOverall, very average California Thai.  2.4 stars.", "author": "movinon .."}
