Our waiter, Viento, welcomed us and provided us with the specials for the evening.  He took our order for beverages and shortly we were given olive oil with warm bread.  He came back with our drinks and explained he would put our appetizer order in first and would wait until he saw we were almost done with it before putting our entree order in.  We watched as he handled other tables with the same ease and charm.\n\nOur antipasto tray arrived and it was delicious.  We were able to enjoy this  without feeling rushed and we could talk without having to raise our voices even though the restaurant was very busy.  When our entrees came, I was positive I had gone to heaven.  The chicken risotto was creamy and hot.  My husband's veal was tender and good.  My husband ate all of his meal, but I was unable and was very happy to take a doggy bag.  Dessert - oh yes we did and we shared although I know I got more than my husband.\n\nWe had a wonderful meal and evening.  If you want to get in and out, this is not the place to go.

I really loved the prosciutto and baratta plate. It had some fig jam on it too and was yummy. The salad was good, normal. A bit on the small side but tasty. \n\nThe entrees were a bit disappointing. I got the spaghetti and meatball, the sauces and noodles were food but the meatball was not good. I mean really not good. \n\nWe also go the chicken risotto on the specials menu, this really tasted like nothing. We added salt and it was still very bland. \n\nCheesecake is mediocre. It was lemon with raspberry. \n\nI had a great time dining here but I just wish the entrees were better. The salad was okay. The dessert mediocre.

Booked a reservation through Resy, and the table was ready by the time we arrived. Overall, the service was stellar with very friendly and attentive staff who refilled our water cups and took away our plates promptly. Although food was also prepared quickly, the food was overall okay, nothing too memorable, but also nothing to complain about. \n\nWe started off the Prosciutto and Burrata with Fig Jam, Eggplant, and Bruschetta. The Fig Jam balanced out the soft, creamy Burrata so well, especially when paired with the complimentary house bread. Bruschetta was nothing too remarkable - just a crisp garlicky bread topped with pretty flavorful diced tomato mixture. \n\nFor our main course, we all got pasta. The favorite was definitely the Carlesimo. I made that dish vegetarian by taking out the Pancetta and didn't feel like I was missing anything because the mushrooms provided ample flavor to the creamy tomato sauce. The Il Diavolo was another favorite - a Spicy tomato sauce topped with a creamy cheese. I heard the Vongole was too buttery, and needed more lemon to cut through the heaviness. The Short Rib Pasta was decent, but nothing outstanding. \n\nSince we told them we were celebrating my brother's birthday, they brought out a complimentary slice of tiramisu with a candle and sung him a birthday song. Really love restaurants that do this!", "author": "Jacqueline T."}

I've been to twice Trattoria Contadina. This is a classic Italian restaurant with an excellent pasta selection. The first time I came I got the vongole. The second time I got the special shrimp penne pasta. \n\nI'd say ALWAYS order the vongole (my mom had the  vongole and wish I just stuck w that). It is delicious and though you might feel like you just ate an entire stick of butter, just don't think about it and savor every moment of the delicious lemony goodness. The clams are good and the pasta is fresh. \n\nThe shrimp penne had less of a wow factor - it was good but nothing special. \n\nThey try to be speedy with the service, which I appreciate since we came HUNGRY. \n\nDefinitely book in advance, you can try walk ins but probably unlikely on a weekend.

We started off with the prosciutto and burrata which was absolutely perfect! the prosciutto didn't have a slime texture and was very lean with a delicious favor! the burrata was perfect, you could tell it was fresh! the arugula and fig jam gave the dish depth with that bitter and sweet adding a much needed complexity! we ate this dish both alone and with bread. \n\nNext we landed on the cheese ravioli and the pasta and the ricotta was very fresh. i honestly think this was some of the most vibrant pesto i've ever had and the tangy-ness and chew from the sun dried tomatoes was a good contrast to the soft ravioli! \n\nWe ended it all with a small shot of espresso! \n\nThis is a great, intimate old school restaurant that great for a romantic date or catching up with friends! the service here is attentive and warm, Nancy was our server and there was a slight hiccup with our order but we didn't mind since she was so kind to us that we understood that mistakes happen!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-02", "description": "Finding a quality and above average Italian restaurant in San Francisco can be trickier than you might think. In a city that offers an abundance of fine dining locations, I come to the source where Italian food dominates and that is none other than the touristy North Beach neighborhood. Having been born and raised not too far from here, I know this is where you will find family owned restaurants and delis. Which takes me to \"Trattoria Contadina\".\n\nLocated directly on the corner of Mason St. and Union St., this place has been serving up locals and tourists dating back to 1984. Since this is in a very busy, dense part of the city, it is highly encouraged to arrive here via-Uber/Lyft, Muni bus, or taxi. Since my lady and I are out-of-towners (from Sacramento), we luckily found parking just a block away which was a rarity on a Saturday evening. \n\nWe came here for our anniversary which was the perfect end to our evening. Keep in mind, reservations are highly encouraged. Our reservations were made through OpenTable which was set for 7:30pm. The entire process was painless from the time we entered to the time we were seated. The interior of Trattoria Contadina is very small but adds to the quaint homely feel. At times, you may feel a little too close to the neighboring tables which for some can be a drawback. However, the high ceilings give it more of an open airy feel to it. And finally, they do have an upstairs area that can be reserved for a larger party. \n\nWe both decided on ordering a bottle of their \"Chardonnay de Tarczal\" wine (for about $40). If you do decide on bringing in your own wine, their corkage fee is $25 a bottle. We were given warm a loaf of their sourdough bread complete with balsamic vinaigrette/extra virgin olive oil. Since I am more of a red sauce fan, I decided on their \"Polpettine\". This consisted of spaghetti pasta complete with Rocky's homemade meatballs and tomato sauce. She went with their \"Pavarotti\" which was fusilli pasta w/chicken, prosciutto, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, & spicy tomato cream.\n\nThe restaurant was consistently busy; even at 7:45pm when we ordered our food. By 8:00pm, both our entrees finally arrived. The presentation on both our plates was very well executed. My Polpettine pasta dish was absolutely heavenly as I tasted many amazing spices that balanced out each savory bite. And the homemade meatballs (which they did not skimp on) had wonderful seasonings including garlic, oregano, and Italian spices that made this a truly wonderful dish. I also sampled a few bites of her Pavarotti dish as it was creamy and delicious. \n\nOverall, \"Trattoria Contadina\" is an above average Italian restaurant that I highly recommend if you're a local (like myself) or an out of towner that has never had authentic Italian food before. And the location has more of a hidden feel (a few blocks away from Columbus Ave.) where you won't be in the heart of the touristy areas. Do keep in mind that this place is exclusively a dinner restaurant as they're only open from about 4-9:30pm. All in all, with the service, quality, location, price, and experience, I give this place a perfect five-stars.", "author": "Donovan H."}

The meatballs were delicious--we chose the classic tomato sauce, and our server topped it off with a heap of freshly grated cheese. I'd never tried eggplant caponata before, but I loved it! The ingredients worked together so well, and they were neatly piled atop a crispy piece of garlic crostini. The flavors were wonderful, and the contrasting textures were perfect.\n\nFor pastas, we went with the ever-popular Vongole and Carlesimo. Both were incredible--very different but each equally delicious in its own right. The Vongole tasted more like many of the pastas I'm familiar with, but it was just executed so well. The combination of lemon, butter, and garlic was just right, and let's be honest, I've never been one to walk away from a seafood pasta. The Carlesimo was unlike anything I'd ever had before, and I loved it. It was creamy, just a little bit spicy, and perfect with the crispy pancetta. In both pastas, the noodles were cooked just the way I like them. I couldn't get enough of either of them, and we spent the entire night swapping our giant pasta bowls across the table.\n\nIt was definitely too much food for two people, but it was worth the food coma. I wouldn't change a thing, except that maybe next time I would also add dessert. :)\n\nI would recommend this spot for so many different occasions--I saw couples, co-workers, friends, families, etc. The ambiance works for anything, and the food is just SO delicious.

This place is always packed and deservedly so. The food, service and atmosphere is all warm and definitely classic. Please, make a reservation and prepare to have a lovely evening.\n\nThis review will be for my most recent visit with A though I have been before to celebrate a friend's birthday and had an equally wonderful experience. A came in for an 8pm reservation on a Friday night and were sat promptly though there were people waiting in the (tiny) restaurant for a seat. Every table was taken; they really pack people in here. We decided not to start with any appetizers since we knew we wanted to order dessert. Since it was a Friday, I wanted to celebrate a little and the waiter was able to recommend a glass of wine that paired perfectly with my entree. We had:\n\n-Veal Correnti ($32): This was mine and it was GREAT. I normally don't love cream sauces but I wanted to avoid tomatoes. This cream sauce was super flavorful and the veal was cooked perfectly. The Chianti that as recommended was a great match. A could not stop stealing food from my plate.\n\n-Carlesimo ($19): A got this dish and really enjoyed it. He also doesn't normally order cream sauce but liked this since it had a bite to it. I tried some and really enjoyed it as well, enough to maybe order next time.\n\nWe also HAD to have the Spumoni ($8) that we saw on Yelp and we were not disappointed. Seriously, if you come here and don't order the Spumoni, you are wrong. I was ready to order a piece just for myself after we polished off the first piece but A stopped me...something about self restraint and nutrition.\n\nAnyways, why 4 stars instead of a perfect 5? The service is...spotty. We saw our waiter three times: to order, to drop of the wine and to pay. We had to wait a long time for refills on water and didn't get a refill on bread when requested. We also waited a while for a check. I understand they were busy but I think the service aspect could be refined.\n\nTrattoria Contadina is a great meal though and definitely worth the stop. We are looking forward to coming back and working our way through their menu. Hopefully the service will be a bit more attentive next time, however.", "author": "Carrie W."}

HH was still going on so we opted for some drinks - house wine, old fashions, and a martini. Everyone was pretty happy with their drinks. \n\nWe started off with a few appetizers - Bruschetta, Meatballs and Marinara, and House Salad. This was the biggest bruschetta I've ever had, large slab of bread with a mound of tomatoes on top. The meatballs were highly recommended on yelp and they were delicious, two meatballs was enough for 5 people to sample. \n\nI ordered the Inverno Verde - Conchigle pasta, fennel sausage, arugula, with pesto cream. I was sold on the fennel sausage and the pesto cream. This dish was great, I love the choice of the conchigle pasta, it holds the sauce very well. I also got a taste of the Fruitti Di Mare - Spaghetti, clams, mussels, snapper, calamari, prawns, scallops, and tomato sauce. Also very delicious and a great sample of seafood. \n\nOverall we had a wonderful experience, we were able to book a reservation the day of and it was definitely the way to go.

I will go as far as to say this is the best Italian restaurant in SF. \n\nI've now been probably 7-8 times and haven't had one meal that wasn't outstanding. Typically at Italian restaurants I'll find one dish and order it every time. Here, though, I've been encouraged to try so many different dishes and loved all of them.\n\nMy favorite dish of the moment is the Il Diavolo. It's this creamy penne with some spice topped with buratta. I've said this before and I'll say it again: I will without a doubt order anything on a menu with buratta. This dish will never disappoint.\n\nI also recently tried the Inverno Verde. I don't usually order pesto pastas, but this one comes in a close second to Il Diavolo. The creamy pesto is served with conchiglie noodles and sausage. \n\nBeware: these pasta dishes are huge.

Caesar salad totally underwhelming, even the anchovies seemed stale, my wife's shrimp was completely overcooked - you can tell with the super white color even before you put it in your mouth, my Il Diavola was a spicy dish, but it honestly tasted like mashed up pizza with very regular pasta from a box.

Came here on Saturday evening reservation and we were seated a couple of minutes early.

The Vongole is a more traditional dish, but it was probably the best white wine sauce and seafood spaghetti dish I've ever had. Other restaurants tend to make it too watery due to the clams, but Trattoria Contadina cooked it perfectly. The Rigatoncelli was very heavy (perfectly al dente and chewy) as the pasta itself was large and the sauce was tomato cream, but still DELICIOUS. I savored every bite of both pastas and would order them again in a heartbeat. \n\nFor drinks, I got the Bee's Knees cocktail and the bf got a Barbera red. Both were delicious!

Came here on a busy Thursday evening (yes, it was busy even on a Thursday evening) without any reservations and we had to wait 20 minutes or so, but the wait was worth it. We ordered one entree of pasta between 2 of us, so the total didn't turn out to be too large, but the pricing was definitely on the higher end. The bruschetta was $8 but came with only 2 pieces, which was a bit much. Don't get me wrong though, the food was wonderful and worth the money.

I wanted convenience to our evening show of \"Beach Blanket Babylon.\" I got all three in Trattoria Contadina. The excellent no-nonsense service and warm atmosphere was a bonus.\n\nAfter discovering Trattoria Contadina on Yelp, I called twice to get a reservation -- but short notice means no luck. So, we made plans to go somewhere else before our show. The other place didn't take reservations, so when we walked past Trattoria Contadina, I poked my head in just in case. The hostess greeted us warmly and said she'd had a couple no-shows, \"So let's do it!\" We were seated immediately and quickly had bread and attentive service. I was happy -- even happier moments later with wine poured.\n\nWe split the trio of meatballs -- solid 2.5\" orbs of meat with choice of sauce (we had the classic tomato). I had a cup of minestrone that was good but not special. My gnocchi were excellent and a large portion. I judge an Italian restaurant by its gnocchi, and these were denser than I prefer but still very tasty in a creamy tomato sauce. A crew of attentive staff ensured we always had water, bread, hand-grated parmesan, fresh pepper and a clean table. We skipped dessert because of the show time, but I am confident that the menu of Italian standards would have delivered just as well as the other courses.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm and inviting, with friendly people waiting on you -- and things moved quickly. Two families with small children enjoyed meals nearby, as did other groups, and it was clear this is a place with a loyal base of local customers as well as tourists who stumble on it via guidebooks or Google.

We've lived down the street from this place for 6 years and have never been in; we always talk about going, but then get distracted by shiny new restaurants. The rainy weather had me craving some warm Italian food, so we decided to head over around 5:30. We got sat in the cozy upstairs section, which was already half-filled with diners. Our server was incredibly bubbly and personable; she  recommended a bunch of her favorite dishes and even let me sample one of the wines that I was interested in. \n\nWe ordered the special burrata dish which featured persimmons and prosciutto. It was honestly one of the best burrata dishes I've ever had, and I will definitely try making this for our next dinner party. My husband ordered the special tortellini dish. The pasta was stuffed with beef and was covered in a pea and prosciutto cream sauce. It was incredibly tasty and I loved the nutmeg flavor. I ordered the the polpettine (spaghetti and meatballs) and was very impressed with the dish. I tend to judge most Italian restaurants by this dish, because it can be very hit or miss. The meatballs were delicious, and the tomato sauce had a lot of flavor. My one complaint was how much garlic was in the meatballs; I felt like the garlic was coming out of my pores three hours later. \n\nI can't wait to come back here for dinner.

Instead of a cream sauce, the sauce was super thin and there wasn't much of it.

The joint itself has a nice d\u00e9cor inside and has a \"family feel\" to it with lots of people just enjoying company without being obnoxiously loud. This joint has a lot of energy from the servers all the way to the patrons and it was a nice setting. \n\nThe table decided to order a bottle of red which was delicious and then a bruschetta, the special risotto, the polpettine, the carlesimo, and the gnocchi. After ordering, they were prompt in bringing out the bread and the vino and off we were. The bread comes out in ample amounts and provided with olive oil and balsamic of course. The bruschetta was solid, simple, and classic being a nice way to start off the meal. I will make this simple for those in a hurry to just get to the punch line. All of the food here is hearty and just plain delicious. This joint focuses on bringing delicious pasta that is cooked well to the table. The risotto was pretty good and I loved the mix in of the pesto mix to it. It was not overcooked or watery like a lot of places can get wrong so solid. Each of the pastas had its classic feel to it but just simply done well. The polpettine was delicious and classic and easy to finish off. The Carlesimo was made really well and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The pancetta added a nice flavor to the sauce on top and this was delicious as well. The gnocchi was of course to no surprise delicious as well. All of the plates were delicious and the sauces were the perfect compliment to the carb heaven on the table.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid and delicious joint in the north beach area. They provide delicious food and a good vibe to all patrons. This is definitely a solid place to check out and definitely delivers on good food without being overpriced.

They have quick service but servers were not too friendly or social. \n\nWe ordered the clams and mussels as appetizers and it was nicely done. Very tasty; there's a garlic taste but not too strong that it takes away the taste from the seafood. We also had the chicken ravioli in a cream sauce. It's a super simple dish, but their special cream sauce made a huge difference. The chicken inside the tiny raviolis are so soft and tender and it goes well with the sauce. Last but not least, we ordered the \"carlesimo\" which is just simply pasta, peas, and sun dried tomatoes, but they did a good job. It's in a semi spicy tomato sauce.

Going to any other block requires me to \"think outside the box\", and I'm the type who worries too much about what I'm missing inside the box. Lemme inside the box... PLEASE!! Thank goodness someone was kind enough to drill a big enough hole in my box to let me out. But enough with the Container Store analogies since four of us came here to dine on traditional Italiano off the tourist track in the residential area at Mason and Union. If you want good eats for hearty appetites, they got 'em right here. Ba da bing, ba da boom.\n\nSo I came here with my friends Stephanie, Robbie and his lovely wife Betsy, all fairly recent transplanters to our fair city from points east and south. Yet the irony was that they already knew this place was a find, while I, the supposed expert on local eats, was in the dark probably overly focused on the latest eatery to show up in 7x7. This one's been around since I put mousse in my hair and wanted to be in a Duran Duran cover band. It definitely looks like it was decorated back then but in a very simple, back-to-basics way (photo: http://bit.ly/Nda7iH). No velvet paintings of clowns steering gondolas, no lava lamps. Just classic. I started with one of their $8 signature Negronis because I needed it (photo: http://bit.ly/1eVtgM9).\n\nAnd it did the trick. You could bend me like a pretzel for the rest of the evening now, especially with a chaser like a glass of the 2011 Brunelli Rosso di Montalcino, a lively sangiovese with a fruity finish (photo: http://bit.ly/1eVtmDf). OK, time to eat. I started with the $9 Insalata Barbabietola, a festive plate of arugula, radicchio, beets, goat cheese and pistachios, all of it doused in a light vinaigrette that didn't need much coaxing to bring out the flavor (photo: http://bit.ly/Od0mlN). It was delicious and devoured in all-too-common haste. My entree was the most extravagant pasta dish on the menu, the $25 Fruiti di Mare, a nicely portioned plate of spaghetti saturated with clams, mussels, calamari, red snapper, scallops, prawns, onions, and peperoncini, all of it lightly tossed in a fresh tomato sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1l0hybn).\n\nJust the type of seafood extravaganza I wanted to enjoy with relish. Not pickle relish, I mean gusto. Good stuff, nothing artful but pretty darn tasty and filling. But who doesn't want to share in a little dolci to cleanse the palate. The four of us shared two of the $7 specialty ice cream pies - a slice of the Mocha Fango, layers of fudge and and mocha almond chip gelato on an Oreo cookie crust blended with chocolate chip and almonds and a slice of the Spumoni, a Neapolitan combination of vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, and strawberry ice cream - both drizzled in a dark chocolate sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1feWwU8). And did I mention the $8 mug of Irish Coffee with Jameson whiskey and a whopping dollop of whipped cream (photo: http://bit.ly/1feWDyW). Delicioso. Heavens to Betsy. Oh wait, she's here...and most heavenly.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good, old-fashioned Italian well executed with no frills\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...classically nondescript with nary a red checkerboard tablecloth in sight\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...not too intrusive though a bit on rote\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely for those tired of inhaling the gas fumes at the sidewalk tables on Columbus", "author": "Ed U."}

As you walk in, you will be promptly seated by the host/hostess. You will notice photo frames of famous celebrities (that I presume have been customers of this place).\n\nThe memorable ones of the night include:\n\nCarlesimo: rigatoncelli noodle, mushrooms, peas, sun-dried tomatoes and spicy tomato cream sauce. This was delicious! Absolutely flavorful and definitely a must-have if you come visit! (5/5)\n\nPavarotti: fusilli noodle, chicken, proscuitto, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes and cream. This is probably *THE BEST* cream I have ever had in my history of Italian pasta cravings. The cream isn't too heavy and contains the vital elements of flavor and consistency. You must order this if you don't normally eat tomato sauce pastas! (5/5)\n\nInverno di Mare: Cavatappi noodles, clams, mussels, scallops, roasted peppers. The ingredients are fresh and delicious, however I prefer the previous two pastas more. (4/5)\n\nTIP: The cheapest parking garage near this place is for $10 (a few blocks away). Otherwise, you may need to find street parking, which can be a bit annoying during dinner hours.", "author": "Eva L."}

It came with polenta and spinach that was literally swimming in butter. The lamb was not well seasoned and not cooked long enough because it was a little tougher than other lamb shanks I've had at other restaurants.

On the way back to our car which was parked at Ghiradelli Square, we were thinking of where to eat at 7pm. We looked at yelp and were craving some really good Italian Food. My brother found Trattoria Condtadina. The reviews were exceptional, the foodie pictures looked phenomenal and so he called in. The guy who made reservations for us was a lifesaver. He managed to squeeze the 3 of us in for dinner. It was the best decision on both parties, because now I know where to go when I visit San Francisco. This place is not located in Little Italy, and it's located in the neighborhood where you would at least expect it. There's no competition for this restaurant and I feel most of the customers are local near by neighbors. Once you get in, there is limited space to wait inside. But it's definitely worth the time waiting, when you get inside the restaurant eat some really good Italian Food. I had orderded the seafood penne. It was supposed to be spaghetti, but I asked for a penne substitute. My mom and brother had the same but stook with the spaghetti. It was a delicious dinner. I wish I could've added more penne. We also started off with an appetizer of Mussels, and clams. It was definitely a great way to start off the dinner. I also had lemonade as a drink, My mom and brother had wine. The environment here is very romantic and Italian-Family feel to it. We ended the night with tiramisu and cappucino. The tiramisu was to die-for. The cappucino was really good too.

In some instances you want food delivered quickly but when you go out for a nice dinner it's okay to wait for a few.

But let's start from the beginning of this experience.\n\nCame in here because wife wanted a nice sit down place.  Seated suitably fast, although in a corner.  They were nice enough to bring crayons for my daughter, ok, so far so good.\n\nBoth of us thought the bread was cold, so that could've been better.  Olive oil was meh... So, not off to a great start, the Mista salad was your standard mixed green salad. Nothing spectacular, for $9.5, 5/10 on the honesty scale, my daughter.\n\nOrdered the spaghetti with meat balls and the Carlesimo.  And when my daughter said: \" am I ever going to get my dinner.\"  I was ready to knock off another star.  Luckily, dinner came here seconds after that.  \n\nThe portions were relatively tiny for the pricing they were charging,  Bucca had better size.  So, I was expecting something quite out of this world as far as the pasta is concerned.  The spaghetti with meatball was just plain, so not really special.  The Carlesimo was something other yelpers raved about, but I thought the noodles were a little too tough.  They did get the spices right, so wasn't a complete disappointment, overall, I would hope if the noodles were boiled a little longer, it would be just about right.\n\nMy overall opinion of Italian restaurants is that they were either mind blowing in terms of quality or they overwhelmed you with portions.

I have eaten at Trattoria Contadina a few times with my family and have really enjoyed the food. I picked this restaurant this evening as my three sisters and I were celebrating a birthday.  I brought a bottle of wine and the corkage fee is $25 which is comparable to many restaurants in the city.  My sisters ordered the meatballs and thought they were very tasty (I'm a vegetarian).  Between us, we ordered the primavera pasta, eggplant pasta,  pasta with clams and mussels, and the swordfish.  All dishes were substantial and we left our plates empty.  We were also served bread with olive oil and vinegar.  For dessert, we had cheesecake which we also enjoyed.\n\nA few things to note.  We had a problem with several fruit flies at our table.  I had forgot that we had this problem when I had been there several months ago.  We brought it to the attention of our waiter but there was not much he could do while we were eating.  We ate at a table for 4 at the far end of the restaurant.  I have to say my sisters and I thought the busser was much more attentive and friendlier to us than the server.  Our waiter was busy helping a large party celebrating a 90th birthday but he just didn't seem \"in tune\" with our table.   Lastly, on the way out of the restaurant, my oldest sister commented to the host about our problem with the flies. He said they were going to spray as this happens when the seasons change.

We started off with the meatballs (with freshly grated Parmesan might I add) which were perfect and served with the best tomato sauce. Secondly, I had the Carlesimo pasta which was my absolute favorite. The sauce nearly melted in my mouth. Lastly we had tiramisu which tasted like it did when I had it in Italy!

It was the only item that I may not try again-- the lamb was a bit gamier than I hoped and the saffron risotto was disappointing - tasted like white rice with cream sauce unfortunately. \n\nThis being said, Trattoria is officially my favorite Italian in the city so far!

Period. You want fake or real Italian? If it's real and authentic Italian you want... Look no further. \n\nI came across this little piece of heaven when I was on the hunt for the best Italian around town. The reviews and pictures really caught my attention.

We almost ordered another plate of meatballs but really wanted to leave room for the entree. The burrata.... Ok... How do I explain it... There are no words! It had some kind of sliced meat (prosciutto?) under with the burrata on top and pesto on top of the burrata. That combination was just perfect. It melted in your mouth. There were four pieces. It was just perfect. Can't go wrong with either appetizer!!\n\nI ordered the ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Carlesimo. Both of those particular pastas are made in house which is exactly what I wanted. Made from scratch pasta. And that's what I got. My ravioli's were great. It had a hint of some sort of sweetness to it which I didn't love because I personally don't like my food sweet unless it's dessert! My boyfriend didn't think it was but his palette is different. His pasta dish was just amazing. All the different ingredients came together to make every bite better than the last. The sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms were my favorite part of the dish. \n\nOverall: would I recommend? Absolutely. No doubt about that! Would I come back? Yes! I would recommend eating light in the day and planning on going to the gym the best day but certainly worth it. They definitely filled my Italian food fix I was in search of!

It is a cute little restaurant with dim lighting and string lights hanging from the ceiling- perfect for a date night.\n\nI tried the Carlesimo, which is a pasta with \"rigatoncelli, pancetta, porcini, peas, sun-dried tomatoes, spicy tomato cream.\" When I ordered this, the waiter smiled and told me it was their signature dish. I was blown away by this pasta. It was absolutely delicious. The sauce was perfectly creamy, tomato-y, and the pancetta and porcini really gave it a rich meaty flavor. Pasta was fresh and chewy (though I felt it was a tad bit too \"al dente\" and could've been cooked a bit longer..). Overall, would order this again and again. \n\nThe boyfriend got the Vongole, which is a pasta with white wine, garlic, clams.. etc. This was only meh... and paled in comparison to my dish. We wouldn't order this again. \n\nWe also got the Caprese which was also good. The heirloom tomatoes were really sweet and flavorful, and paired well with the burrata cheese- it all tasted very \"fresh\". I do wish it had maybe a pinch of salt though, as I feel this would balance the flavors of sweetness from the tomatoes and the sour from the balsamic vinegar. I've tried a caprese salad from another restaurant that had some kind of pesto aioli and I really liked how it made the dish savory, sweet, and tangy.", "author": "Kathleen Y."}

Little did I know that she would one day become my wife.  So this place has a special moment in my heart when I look back on it.\n\nI walked in early because I knew I was eating solo and this place is very small.  I was able to grab a table with no reservation.  There is always someone at the door to greet you too, which I love.\n\nI was seated at my table with ex-Bear Ron Rivera...yes there was an autographed picture of him sitting right next to me and being from Chicago I felt like I was at home.  He was not very talkative...I asked him if was picking the 49ers or the Saints and he just kind of hung around there and froze! \n\nI was delivered some bread which I immediately dipped in some olive oil.  I was very hungry and needed something solid.  I also was feeling pasta and meatballs but did not want to be so basic.  So I got a starter of meatballs and then a half order of Linguine and Clams.\n\nI really enjoyed the meatballs and the best part is that I did not have to share them with anyone.  I had the young lady grate fresh Parmesan cheese all over them.  I also dipped my bread in the sauce and I was in heaven.\n\nNext came my pasta with clams.  The clams were good but I was a little letdown because 3 of the 11 clams were full of sand.  I honestly do not know if that is normal or should I expect that in a restaurant.  We cook with fresh clams at home and we make those suckers spit out ever last piece of sand before we throw them into there boiling death.  So I do not know if I am being unreasonable but a mouth full of sand is not fun!\n\nThe pasta with all of the ingredients was very tasty.  I also like that they offer half orders.  I was able to get a nice half order and not feel like I have to eat the whole thing.  It is so hard being Sicilian...we are taught to clean our plate.  So the half order saves me all of those extra calories and carbs!\n\nBy the time I left almost every table was taken...so I am glad that I got here early and got my dinner before it was too late.  \n\nHopefully next time I will have to have dinner with that amazing woman here again!!!", "author": "Anthony M."}

The place seems to get a lot of traffic, and you will in fact not be seated without a reservation (Hooray, Opentable!). Our dining experience affirmed the place as a \"must try for anyone wanting Italian in San Francisco\" -- it was amazing.\n\nTo start, I split an old fashioned (from the very stocked bar) with my wife while we waited for our table. It was super great and used good bourbon. When we were seated, the server brought us some fresh bread and olive oil, as well as freshly grated parm and black pepper at our request. The bread was nice and warm, and the parm was amazing. I'm glad they don't skimp on that either -- some places with fresh cheese tend to not be so generous.\n\nDeciding on what to eat was a hard choice -- every option was amazing. Many have tried the Carlesimo, but I opted for the Gnocchi. I saw on Yelp the ability to order this with pesto and opted for it for the looks... and then I fell in love. This is simply the best gnocchi I've had. It is actually made with ricotta cheese rather than potato, so you are getting a more velvety, creamy texture from the pasta. My wife went with the Carlesimo but subbed the noodles for risotto because of her gluten allergy. They were very accommodating, and the result was also amazing. We kept fawning over our food selection several times, and ultimately opted to save half of our dishes for later (the risotto-fied Carlesimo actually lasted two more meals!). \n\nI am 100% returning to this place to try all the other dishes ... all around it seemed everyone enjoyed their food and that the kitchen only served fresh stuff.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-25", "description": "While visiting SF, the four of us ate here last Tue night, with a local guest.  This is a very nice cozy Italian place!  Nice corner location, & very nice feel/ambiance.  Having said all this, I don't exactly enjoy eating dinner SO close to other patrons - you can easily hear their conversation & vice versa - even when they're/we're speaking softly - but I guess this is what you get in most places in SF (\"when in Rome...\").  As I sat down to order my drink, I scanned the wines-by-the-glass selections.  I noticed right away there were no options for Cab or Merlot, my favorites.  I thought I might be looking at the wrong section of the menu or something.  There WERE bottles of these 2 types...but again, no single glasses.  As my wife & guest were already enjoying their glasses of white wine, I had no one to share a bottle w/ & I certainly didn't need four glasses to myself.  I asked the waiter if I could sample some other red selections - he said the maximum I could try is two (!), so I sampled the Pino Noir & two others (he let me try a third when I didn't like the first two).  Although he did return impressively fast w/ these samples...I didn't like any of them, so I went w/ a Diet Coke.  So this is a ding - how can a SF Italian restaurant (so close to Napa) NOT offer a Cab or Merlot by the glass??  To add insult to injury, I JUST checked the menu on the pictures section here - apparently, there IS a Cab option (Sean Minor, Napa) by the glass - why didn't this waiter offer it to me???  Very strange!  Oh well.  As a group, we ordered Bruschetta - I'll tell you right now, this was probably THE best Bruschetta I've ever had.  The bread was crusted perfectly; the heaping tomatoes were bright red, firm & fresh - every bite was wonderful!  I then ordered the Valdostana as my entree.  Very nice dish - the chicken was moist, but the sauce was fantastic.  My son (14) ordered the Caprese salad & nothing else (he had a BIG lunch), but he loved it.  My daughter had a penne dish & thought it was just OK.  I'm part Italian so my heart wants to rank this a 5...but I have to be honest here.  The lack of wines-by-the-glass is a bit shocking, esp after again, seeing the wine list here.  Also, to be told, RIGHT off the bat, \"You can only sample 2 choices\" (aka \"No soup for you!\") is also a bit stern, stoic & surprising.  The five of us were laughing a lot & we definitely enjoyed ourselves, & the staff (bartender, busboy), esp the bartender, was super friendly.  The next time we're in SF, I hope to try this again.", "author": "Terran S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-01-01", "description": "As you can tell from our previous (5 star) review, we've been coming to Trattoria Contadina for years now. We make it out here around 3 times a year and we've always have a great meal. I always order my Di mare and my wife always the Carlesimo. This has been our favorite meal that we always look forward to because of 1. the great food and 2. the good memories that we have.\n\nMy brother-in-law's family was visiting us for the holidays and we decided to end his trip with dinner here. We ordered the vongole, dimare, carlesimo, w/peppers + mussels appetizers. When we got the appetizer, my brother-in-law took one bite of the mussels and immediately sensed something was wrong. We each took one to try and the pungent smell was overwhelming. The mussels were clearly bad. We sent it back and told our waitress. She was very nice and asked if there was anything we needed to make up for it. She also explained that since it was new years, the seafood was older than normal. She also asked about keeping the dimare since it also had mussels. We thought if they could correct it, we would have it. Maybe just throw out the bad batch and give us fresher ones.\n\nWe all were definitely a bit upset at that point. The smell had spread around our table and it reeked. When we got our entrees a bit later, the mussels in the Di Mare were bad again. The server was really nice and understood. She told us that the meal was on the house, but really the damage had been done. We had 2 out of 4 dishes. Even though the Carliesimo and the Vongle were fine, we already had the terrible taste in our mouths and we had to divide the dishes between the 4. The food should not be brought out if quality can't be delivered. The chefs could have just easily cooked up a single mussel to see if was bad or good without putting the customer through the same thing TWICE. Despite the experience, we left tip cause the waitress genuinely felt bad and was accommodating. However, we do feel the ownership should be placed on the kitchen and manager. It's better to be upfront and to deal with bad food than to make your customer the guinea pig.\n\nWe came here on new years for good memories and good food. Not a great way to start the year. The free entrees at the end were not what we wanted. Will be hard for us to come back especially since my wife and I were the host and wanted to deliver good experience. It obviously didn't happen.\n\nUpdate: just changed from 2 stars to 1 star. My brother in law eyes are swollen and his wife threw up after they got home. This is 100 unacceptable. That seafood must have been really old or not properly refrigerated. It also means the clams (which we thought were okay) were also not good.\n\nIn Response to the Owners Post: First of all, I have every right to come on to Yelp to give you guys a review. Just like I came on a gave you guys a positive review after the first few times we went (You certainly didn't have a complaint about that). As a owner, you should take 100% ownership when customers get sick to the point that they throw up and have swollen eyes. Simply saying we got a free meal is BS. My family got sick so we lost something out of it. They had to board a flight sick. You only got some scarring from a poor review. If you couldn't get fresh food delivered, then it's also 100% your responsibility. If quality is your top concern than don't serve seafood and/or don't open on days that you can't get it. YOU took the risk of serving the older food. This bad review is peanuts in comparison to what we had to deal with on the days after. Lastly, you weren't even there that night, so don't tell me who-said-this-or-that. Take the bad review and move on.", "author": "Christopher K."}

Generally, I'm more of a citrusy drink sort of gal (think mojito) but the Manhattan here uses blood orange bitters so I decided to give that a try. The drink was lovely. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the bitters really added an extra level of depth to the drink, definitely endorse it.\n\nFor appetizer, the waiter recommended the Pepperoni Arrostiti. It's essentially baked cheesy bell pepper in a spicy tomato cream sauce. The pepper itself was fairly nondescript, but the sauce, oh the sauce!! I could dip bread in a tub of that goodness all day and be a happy girl. My dinner companion seemed to share my opinion and threatened several times to lick the plate. Good thing he didn't because he would have to fight me for the privilege!\n\nFor entrees, I had the Melanzane alla Mozzarella -- eggplant covered with cheese. I thought it was tasty, but unspectacular. My date didn't make any orgasmic noises while consuming his Carlesimo (rigatoni in tomato cream sauce) as with the pepper sauce in the appetizer round, but I assume he enjoyed it.\n\nAll in all, Contadina has a neighborhood place feel.

This place is my favorite Italian restaurant (that I've been to yet) in the whole Bay Area! I bring my local friends and family who visit here. My favorite dishes are the house made raviolis. I eat meat but my favorite dish is the cheese ravioli in the red sauce. The service is nice. The establishment is a little bit off the beaten track from the Little Italy district which I like. The environment is cozy. Recommended!", "author": "Angel B."}

While we did not have to wait, there is not much free space inside for standing, so I highly suggest bringing a coat in case you have to stand outside to wait for your table.\n\nWe wanted to order the salumi and cheese appetizers (2 separate, they don't have a combined plate) and our waiter talked us into the pepper with melted cheese instead of the cheese. That was my least favorite thing of the night. The salumi plate was very tasty though and good amount for 3 people.\n\nThe wine list is heavily Italian (surprise, surprise) with things like Tuscan, Super Tuscan, Tuscan Blend, and a similarly baffling list of Chianti's. Pricing is varied so we just picked one in a range we felt comfortable with and chose one at random without guidance from our waiter. It was delicious and went very well with our food. \n\nAlthough they say family style, the portions were definitely served individually, and it was up to us to exchange plates and bites. I ordered the fruitti de mare which was very good. I was extremely happy with it and hesitant to share ;-)\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the pavarotti which was DELICIOUS! Amazing blend of flavors and tastes. The sauce is creamy which makes it very rich so I highly advise sharing this one and getting something lighter to balance it out.\n\nMy friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. I thought the sauce was the highlight of the dish. The meatballs were flavorful, but so dense. Maybe it's more authentic? I'm used to a lighter meatball. Still really good though.\n\nService was very attentive. It was a bit loud at our table by the kitchen, but in a weird way it adds to the charm of this place. We had a great dinner mostly made by the amazing pasta. \n\nDress is casual. My friend, who is Canadian, was thoroughly enjoying the 60 degree weather and showed up in shorts and flip flops. While I do not recommend this and he did get several odd looks from patrons, the restaurant did not turn us away based on that. Most people were wearing jeans, corduroys, or khakis.", "author": "Rachel E."}

I had been here once before a long time ago (think I was only 14-15 years old), but I still remembered the place pretty well once we walked in. It is a one room restaurant with maybe enough space for 20 or so tables. There is a small bar near the front door and lots of window space. Even at 7:30 PM in the summertime, there was quite a bit of natural light coming into the restaurant. \n\nTo start, I had a glass of Slovenian white wine which was not quite a pinot gris, but pretty close. Semi-dry and smooth on the palate. My fiance had a Chianti and it tasted pretty great too. Their alcohol prices if you're splitting a bottle are better than what I've seen for similar restaurants in the DC area. We also ordered a side dish of warm olives which went pretty quickly.\n\nI had the spaghetti vongole (clams in a white wine sauce with capers). It was the perfect portion size and the clams were done well. Definitely one of those dishes where I wish there were seconds allowed!\n\nAlthough I wished their main entrees were a dollar or 2 less than advertised, everything was cooked to order and we had no compliants. This is a great place for both visitors and locals to rub elbows and enjoy some great Italian comfort food.", "author": "Christina P."}

It was rich, flavorful and nearly a mean all in itself. Then it was on to the breadcrumb stuffed and fried artichokes. They were alright, but a bit heavy on anchovies. Shortly thereafter, the main dishes were served. I decided on the Vongole. The sauce was perfect, very flavorful but not overpowering. Had the clams been a bit better quality, this dish would have been perfect.  The wine was delicious as well. \n\nThe Cons: The place was packed and pretty small. At first a waitress told us to take a seat upstairs and when we did, another waitress told us she was about to close it for the evening. Once downstairs, we were seated in pretty much the only available table in the place, which was jammed in a corner where the door and window were for all who walk by to see us. The service was not the best for several reasons.

To start off, the olive oil/balsamic they provide with bread in the beginning of the meal is extremely low quality. It's not worth eating at all, butter would have been better. We ordered gnocchi to start with, the sauce was good but the gnocchi was very tough. We had the lamb for the main course and it was HIGHLY under seasoned. Actually, I don't think the cooks used any salt and pepper before preparing it. We had to use table salt and pepper and it was still crappy. I have never had to salt and pepper my own food at a restaurant!

However, she was very hungry.\n\nI suggested that we go early at 8:00 pm and see if they could seat us. When we first arrived, it was full. It is a small place. I did not hold much hope for an early seating. However, the hostess said a table was clearing soon. We went to the bar. I ordered a beer. Within about five minutes, we were seated.\n\nFirst, the place is charming. It is just one of those little neighborhood restaurants that ooze with character. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.\n\nOur server came over quickly and introduced himself. He provided a lot of information about the menu and told my dining companion his favorites. I actually ordered one of them. A little later he was also very helpful in selecting a wine. And it was a very nice bottle of red. I wish I could remember the name. If it comes back to me, I will edit the review and add it.\n\nSome wonderful bread and some very nice olive oil was also provided.\n\nWe always mix up who selects the food and we always share everything.\n\nIt tends to work like this. If it is a eastern style restaurant, she does more of the selecting. If it is a western style restaurant, I do.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\nStarters:\nI selected bruschetta (Toasted Italian bread slices topped with fresh diced tomatoes, basil, garlic and ricotta salata cheese).\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/4yobct5\n\nI selected meatballs in tomato sauce.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3kszcu7\n\nSalad:\nWe selected Caprese Salad (Fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese with slices of fresh tomatoes, basil, pesto and a side of mixed greens).\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3wwaztq\n\nPasta:\nI selected Melanzane (Rigatoni pasta with saut\u00e9ed eggplant with Roma tomatoes, onions, olives, melted mozzarella cheese and homemade tomato sauce). This was a half order to be shared.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3nl5wao\n\nMain:\n\nShe selected Agnello (Lamb chops, rosemary, balsamic vinegar, wine, garlic, seasonal vegetables, rosemary roasted potatoes).\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3rw3qrw\n\nI selected Valdostana (Saut\u00e9ed chicken breast, layered with smoked mozzarella cheese, prosciutto, oregano and sage, served with a Madeira wine sauce, saut\u00e9ed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes).\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3kv396e\n\nI am not going to break each dish down.

Mm-mm to creamy mozzarella! \n\nLamb - These were very good lamb chops. You could really taste the lamb. It seems like so many places now serve lamb that tastes like beef. This had a real distinct lamb flavor without knocking you out with gaminess.\n\nProsciutto - It really made the chicken dish pop.\n\nHonestly, there were not really any low points to the meal.\n\nI will also note that the portions were large. Even with a half order of pasta which we shared, there was still a lunch or midnight snack of leftovers to take home.\n\nAs usual, we pretty much shared everything.\n\nService and Ambiance - I will just note once again that the service was superb. Everyone was so friendly. The room is delightful. It almost feels like you are eating in someone's home. The restaurant was full of people who were very glad to be there and everyone was thoroughly enjoying the experience.\n\nOverall - Great food, service, and ambiance. I would not hesitate to return.

The menu isn't too big but not so small you feel there's nothing you like. We got the bell pepper appetizer, which was seriously to die for! Service was fast and attentive. Our meals took about 25 mins, but there was a big party ahead of us so I knew they had to make their meals first. Our food was delicious! We got the Pavarotti pasta and vascadona chicken. Everything was delicious! Tasted very fresh. The only bad thing is the two top tables are very close together and we got sat next to on both sides. Its just a little awkward. But as small as the restraunt is, its understandable. I had such a good experience here and would definitely come back!", "author": "Madelynn M."}

Great food!  \n\nI ordered the Carbanara off of the \"specials\" menu.....One of the best I've had!  A friend ordered the Carlesimo which was really tasty too.  I'll be ordering that next time I'm there.  Also good off of the \"specials\" menu is the risotto..... yummy flavor!  My husband ordered the Fruita di Mare, which was your average fresh seafood dish.  We also tried the meatballs and carpaccio.  Both were ok.... Nothing special about them.  \n\nThe customer service was great.  Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I appreciate his recommendations off of both the food and wine menus.

We also shared those as an appetizer.  Service was initially slow. It took 15 minutes to get a cocktail. The bartender was in absolutely no rush- even with a full restaurant!  People sitting at the bar were without drinks too.  It kind of irked me to watch him work.  He wasn't even aware of his own lack of any work ethic or speed. \nThe linguine with shellfish, red snapper and prawns wasn't too good. I ate 2 bad mussels.  Very fishy. Yuk. I didn't eat the other 2 and my fingers are crossed that I don't get sick. The linguine was overcooked.  I opted for the red sauce and it eventually became incorporated with the fishiness.  I was unable to dunk my bread as I usually do because the taste of fish was too powerful . It's difficult finding good Italian food in SF.  My favorite is still Lupa in Noe Valley. \nMy partner had the veal scallopine and thought it was ok.  The veal should have been pounded down more and less sauce would have been better.  It was swimming in a brown sauce.\nBottom line : great spot, cozy venue, full house, cable cars going by, good service (except for the bartender), but the food was just so- so.

But I better be stuffed after I spent $53 by myself...\n\nYou start the adventure of Trattoria Contadina by riding your car up and down the steep streets trying to find parking. It was similar to a rollercoaster ride but with the annoyance of having to look for a place to stop and not just enjoying the drops. After 30+ minutes of doing that you start the next phase of trekking blocks and blocks to the restaurant. If you're coming here on a weekend you better make reservations otherwise you'll walk away pissed off that they can't accommodate you. \n\nNow comes the good part: the food was great! I started off with an aperitif of Aperol Citrus and the Zuppa special which was a butternut squash soup. My main course was the Cacciucco special which was a seafood stew that had halibut, mussels, clams, in a rosemary tomato broth. The serving was so big that I couldn't finish it and I'm a fairly big eater. The meal was topped off with a latte that perked me right up. \n\nOur party of 11 sat upstairs and that created a cozy and intimate setting that felt like we were at home.

Randi N. and two other gals to enjoy a fine Italian meal before we jet off to Italy in a few months to study abroad. Originally, we made plans to eat at another restaurant but it was closed on a Tuesday (Weird? or do I not know something about Italian restaurants?) My trusty yelp app led us to this place, and we were seated right away.\n\nWe ordered and split the following:\n1 bottle of white wine\n4 pieces of bruschetta (priced at $3 a pop)\n1 large bowl of rigatoncelli (the first pasta listed on the menu) ($17)\n1 large bowl of chicken ravioli ($17)\n1 order of the picatta ($27)\n\nI would definitely avoid the bruschetta. They provide ample amounts of free bread, and so you're basically paying $3 for some tomatoes, a bit of cheese, and seasoning.  I would've been happier with a meatball (priced at $2.5)\n\nThe rigatoncelli was the standout of the night. Mmmm tomato cream sauce. It was delicious, and it made me really excited about our upcoming trip.  The picatta was also good, but the menu said that it was served with \"seasonal vegetables\" and we just got broccoli.  I'm not even sure if it's in season. I was thinking we would get asparagus or artichokes. Broccoli is nothing special.\n\nI had a few bites of the ravioli before my friend complained about the undercooked ravioli. I replied, \"Really? I haven't had a problem with it. It's good!\" JINX. The next two bites were SO HARD. I didn't touch it after that. I probably should've sent it back but at that point we had divided everything by four. \n\nAfter all of that, we each chipped in $30 to cover the bill, which wasn't bad considering the alcohol. We were also pretty full, even though it didn't seem like we ordered a lot. Pasta and cream sauce is heavy. (It also didn't help that I ate four slices of the free bread. Please don't judge me.)\n\nI agree that the tables are close together, but the place itself is not the biggest so I wasn't surprised. The servers were knowledgeable and attentive. No qualms about the service!\n\nOne of my dates pointed out a signed poster of Bill Cosby on the wall. If it's good for Bill, it's good for me!", "author": "Jenn C."}

The burrata appetizer was also a nice surprise (mixed with peaches and prosciutto).

Our second visit, however, was pretty disappointing.  We made reservations using OpenTable and were about five minutes late.  The host made us feel pretty bad about that (although there was a long line waiting for tables).  The host sat us at a table about a foot and a half from the door and about three inches from the next couple.  It was a horrible table.  That probably tainted the entire night. \n\nThe food was just ok and was barely worth sitting next to the cold door.  We ordered roasted peppers for the appetizer.  It was just mouthfuls of cheese.  The cheese also did not melt well and clumped together. Overall, heavy, greasy and boring. \n\nFor entrees, I ordered gnocchi  in a tomato cream with which was absolutely perfect.  The gnocchi was soft and pillowy and the sauce was sweet and delicious.  The gnocchi  is the only reason I gave this three instead of two stars. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  He liked it ok, but it was nothing special.  \n\nWe cannot remember if we ordered dessert (and ate there a week ago), so I think that speaks for itself. \n\nI hope this was an off night. We will probably return, but make sure to ask for an interior table and steer clear of the pepper.", "author": "Mary N."}

I would suggest a reservation on a fri or sat night for sure unless you want to wait at the tiny bar.  We walked in at 6pm on a Sunday and were offered the last 2 top that wasn't reserved.

I ordered the Carlesimo pasta dish.  Everything in it was fresh and perfect.  The consistency and flavor of the sauce could not have been any better.  I kid you not, and I can cook well so I really get that stuff.  My fiance ordered the Fruitti di Mare.  He was also very happy and ate every bite. It had nearly equal pasta to fresh seafood.  All the pasta had the taste and consistancy of being fresh, if not homemade.  We also split a side of broccolini prepared in olive oil, chili flakes, and lemon.

The locals and the tourists seem to really love this place... and now I know why! \n\nIt's a small quaint Italian restaurant on a corner where the cable cars pass by. You can even take the bus there because it stop right out front! Parking is street only for 2 hours because it's permit parking for the residents. Sundays you can park for an unlimited time, but good luck! This place is right off the main strip in the heart of \"Little Italy\" so on the weekends it is difficult to find parking. \n\nWe called ahead of time to see if we could get a dinner reservation (which is recommended) the earliest we could get in was 5:30 with 9:00 being the next open reservation. Since we were out and about in the city that day, we found 5:30 to be too soon. We unloaded our car after a good day of shopping and thought \"let's stop on by Trattoria to just SEE if we can a seat. It was pure luck because a bunch of people were leaving and the hostess was able to fit us in!. It was around 6:15 PM which is still early for San Francisco diners. We felt lucky! \n\nThey have 2 portion sizes that they offer so that was nice. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. The food was tasty and refreshing! I always love it when they put lemon wedges in the water glasses. The tables are set with linens but this is still a kid/family friendly restaurant. I noticed they had a supply of color crayons for the kiddies. However I tend to think that this is a nice place for a date and small groups. It's a small establishment and not meant for huge gatherings. Even the co-ed restroom is very small. Be sure not to open the door abruptly or else hit someone coming out of the kitchen! \n\nI would definitely go here again when I am in the mood for Italian food at a reasonable price!", "author": "Christine D."}

But myself, being somewhat of a foodie, and not wanting to eat at some dumb Italian tourist trap found this place on yelp. At first I was worried because the pictures of the plates made me think, it was cheap and touristy. But the reviews were so solid we went. \n\nWe got there early, because we were starving. When we walked in the waiter asked if we had reservation... Reservations? ok this was no tourist trap. We said no but he quickly found us a table. They had a decent wine selection but none of us were in the mood for a drink. We started with the meatballs, which put my homemade creations to shame, they were delicious!! The sauce was creamy and robust, and the fresh shaved Parmesan made it that much better. Needless to say they didn't last long. The bread they give you worked perfect to sop the excess sauce left over by the meatballs and tasted wonderful.\n\nFor dinner my Boyfriend got stuffed chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes, which was delicious. The best thing on his plate was the combination of those garlic mashed potatoes and the creamy white sauce on his plate. Half way though his meal though the sauce broke, but delicious none the less. My little sister got the summer carbonara, which was also very yummy. The corn, peas, and shallots were perfect together. I got the pasta special, which was also delicious. Everything was made fresh and the kitchen is open but not loud or chaotic. \n\nTo top off our night the three of us shared a piece of tiramisu. which was so yummy. \n\nAll and all it was amazing but I have had better in So Cal!!!

The thickness and freshness of the pastas, combined with the sauces and fresh ingredients, really sets the place apart from everyday Italian.

They use fettuciine noodles, which is fine. They have corn and peas. Okay, sure, whatever. I just couldn't enjoy it without the egg and parmesan, and because the dish came out barely warm. I apologetically asked for a new dish, the Pavarotti pasta, which was fusili served with sun-dried tomatoes, red peppers, zucchini and chicken in a creamy pesto sauce.

But there is one that has never disappointed. \n\nFor the past several years this has become my \"go to\" restaurant for out of town guests who are looking for that quintessential North Beach San Francisco experience. But even for us locals there may be no better choice than TC.\n\nThe star here are the pasta dishes. Fresh, al dente and perfectly prepared sauces make any menu selection here a winner. If you're thirsty? They offer a full bar and complete wine list that includes selections in all price points.\n\nParking as you would expect is a pain the royal ass. Over the years I have spent hours looking a spot within a 1 mile radius and I don't even want to think about the amount of gasoline I've burned. But there are a lots just down the street which helps take the stress out of eating here. \n\nTrattoria Contadina is that one special place just off the main street and hidden away in on a corner. The menu is simple, but the food is amazing. The service outstanding and the atmosphere unlike no other. This all adds up to one hell of a great night out.", "author": "Rene C."}

Even with the parmesan cheese, EVOO and capers, did not have a good beefy flavor to it.\n\nInsalata:\n\nCaprese - the tomatoes lacked flavor.  They were big meaty portions of a variety of tomatoes, but did not taste like tomatoes\n\nSpecial Salad of the day was some argula and asparagus salad - no wow factor\n\nPasta:  All lacked flavor - even with the parmesan cheese and fresh ground peppered offered.  The only plus side was our meal came to our tables piping hot.\n\nMelanzane - sauteed eggplant with tomatoes\nCarlesimo - pancetta, porcini mushrooms, peas, and sundried tomatoes\nPasta of the day - some pancetta based pasta with cream sauce - close to a carbonara\nVongole - clams with the tomato based sauce (they give you options of garlic, butter, wine, or tomato sauce)\n\nMain dishes \n\nThe veal chop of the day - was okay\n\nGlad we tried them, but was not overly impressed when there are so many other Italian restaurants to try in San Francisco.

The spiced sauce definitely hit the spot.\n\nI like the fact that you can choose your portion size, so you can try more things in one setting.\n\nFor dessert, we had the blackberry cabernet sorbet.

My super-Italian friend, Vince R, told me that I had to try it.  And when a genuine Italian gives you advice on a must eat spot - you listen. \n\nWe got an early reservation this busy Valentine's weekend, and totally lucked out by catching a parking spot half a block away.  The restaurant is TINY, maybe 12-15 tables in the L-shaped dining room.  We sat under a wall of autographed photos from various celebs and athletes that had been there.  We enjoyed some Pinot...\n\nBeing it was our Valentine's Dinner - we decided to splurge and order 4-courses.  We ordered the Bruchetta and a small order of Gnocchi to start us off.  The bruchetta arrived first, and I was disappointed to see it was only two pieces.  While it was ok, it was easily the most underwhelming portion of our meal.  Immediately after, the gnocchi made its way to the table.  It was solid, served in a great creamy tomato sauce and topped with fresh grated parm.  The dumplings could have been softer, but overall it was rock solid.\n\nFor the main course I ordered the Chicken Santi (chicken breast, pancetta, white mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, penne pasta in a vodka cream sauce)... and the wifey ordered the Pavoratti (chicken, pancetta, sun dried tomatoes, zucchini, fusilli pasta in cream sauce).  Those too arrived in a flash - my wife immediately had remorse when she saw my Santi.  While she liked hers, she really loved mine.  I let her pick away at it, but if it weren't Valentine's - she would have lost a hand!!  It was perfection!  Even the lady at the table next to ours actually asked what it was that I had because it looked so good.  The Santi was the highlight of the meal.\n\nFinally, we enjoyed a little White Chocolate Covered Ice-Cream Heart, with a Strawberry Sorbet filling for dessert.  It too hit the spot.\n\nOverall, like many other North Beach spots - 5 stars.  It is my wife's new favorite spot, however Firenze By Night remains my #1 spot.

We sat near the door (ask for another table in towards the back you make reservations) .  It was a colder winter night and I wore my coat all through dinner.\n\nBeyond that, the food was so delish and the service was right on par.   I ordered a seafood with spaghetti dish.  That is my usual choice at an Italian restaurant, so I can be picky.  Their dish was great - seafood was cooked properly and their sauce complemented it well.  My boyfriend ordered a pasta & sausage dish, which he loved  (he cleaned the entire large sized plate).    Based off a Yelp review we ordered the Peppers appetizer and it  did not fail to meet expectations.  It's a relatively simple app.  It's pepper sliced in half and laid on its side (you only get one half) and then filled with several cheeses.  While it would be tough to match it's level of deliciousness, I'm inspired to recreate it at home.  \n\nI would recommend making reservations as the restaurant itself is pretty small.  We saw a larger party go through a door, so I'm guessing there is a back room, but I never saw it.   \n\nOh! And also watch  out for the parking situation if your driving.  We went super early with plans to walk the area for 20-30 min before dinner. That def didnt happen because we were circling for parking that long.

While cutting through the middle of North Beach, my biggest fear occurred when my companion whined \"I'm hungry, I want to eat now!\"  I quickly pulled out my Yelp for the Android and looked for a highly rated restaurant with 100s of reviews.  BINGO!  No tourists, no [obese] family sized portions, no manicotti and no lasagna!  This place serves homey food without the North Beach clich\u00e9s.  It's no Quince, but great casual food if stranded in that neighborhood. \n\nPepperoni Arrostiti: Roasted yellow pepper with three cheeses and some tomato sauce.  Simple, yet very tasty.  A much more exciting way to get your cheese fix than through a typical mozzarella and tomato salad.  Around the same price as many of the pasta entr\u00e9es, so definitely an indulgent anitpasto.\n\nCarlesimo: If meatballs are too commonplace for you, this is your dish!  Thick pancetta bits, porcini, peas and sun dried tomatoes offer a complexity of textures and flavors to this dish.  I especially enjoyed how the peas added a fresh pasty contrast.  The creamy tomato sauce added extra indulgence, almost like eating liquefied cheese.  The rigatoncelli seemed like it was freshly made rather than from a box, always a plus in my book.\n\nGnocchi: These gnocchi were little squares of ricotta that were chewy and hearty.  I don't think there was any potato in them since I never sensed a overly starchy center.  It was simple and I liked it.  Same nice sauce as with the Carlesimo.", "author": "Adam B."}

I was in the mood for Italian food and with a group of four I thought this was the perfect place. A nice warm homey atmosphere, I was impressed by the posters of the best Italian boxers, football and baseball players. To start off..nice warm french bread accompanied with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\n\nFor appetizers, ordered the antipasto plate ($16), a platter full of flavorful cured meats, cheeses, sun dried tomatoes, roasted peppers and warm olives. Yes, warm olives. The chianti was a nice addition to the appetizers. \nMain entree ordered was the Vongole large dish ($18), linguni pasta with sauteed clams in shells with linguini noodles cooked in al dente. The sauce was a lemon, butter, garlic and wine sauce. I like garlic but the garlic was a little too much because it shadowed the taste of the clams. \nIt was kinda nice because the waiter had made a mistake with one of the dishes and he left the dish of Carlesimo, an entree of rigatoncelli pasta with pancetta, porcini mushrooms and a flavorful cream sauce.\nI like the fact that their are two sizes on the pasta dishes-small & large.Very good service, worth coming back to.", "author": "Jim D."}

I had been looking forward to going to this restaurant for weeks. I planned a special night for my husband and myself. Unfortunately, our schedules are crazy so I wasn't sure what time we'd get there. Therefore, we were not able to make a reservation.\n\nAs we walked up to the restaurant we saw that it was very busy and were anticipating a long wait. I was totally fine with waiting, until the front door seater (who I think was also the manager) made me feel like we should leave. First of all, he told us we were looking at an hour and a half wait. This seemed a little exaggerated since there were very few people actually standing around waiting for a table. But it was the way he said it that bothered me. He really made us feel like there was no point in us waiting. We decided to wait nonetheless. We walked up to one side of the bar and he told us we were in the way and could not stand there. So I found a seat and my husband stood behind me. But no more than 5 min later another couple stood where we had just been and he offered them free drinks because they had a reservation and it wasn't ready on time. I asked him why we weren't allowed to stand there but they were and he was tongue-tied for a good reason. Naturally, I am pretty upset at this point. During this whole thing we had been waiting for one stinking cocktail from the bartender for at least 15 minutes.\n\nSo we've already wasted 30 minutes at this restaurant and we're seriously considering leaving, but we decided to stay because we have heard such good things about the food and I didn't feel like searching for a new restaurant at this point. We ended up being seated after only 40 minutes, which I knew was more likely than an hour and a half. To top off the experience, the food was utterly disappointing. We had the Gamberoni and the Carlesimo. Both were just not up to my standards of great Italian food. The wine was good but I was honestly just drinking it to numb the pain of a terrible restaurant experience. \n\nWe still tipped generously because I know it was the front door guy who really made this a 1 star experience, but needless to say, I will never come back to this restaurant.", "author": "Elizabeth V."}

The seafood in the frutte di mare was uneventful and the spaghetti seemed to have been twice-cooked instead of made to order - an old mass prep food technique.  They're obviously not going for top tier dining, but as long as they've been in business and with the prices what they are, I think they can step up their game.  The tiramisu too, it was pretty good and unusually sour in a good way, but not fabulous and the plating looked like a bomb went off in the flour pantry.\n\nNothing I can say will dissuade the die hard fans, the place is a mini-institution, and if you're a tourist or just want the real North Beach experience you could do worse.

My only complaint would be that the food is a tad on the bland side, but still enjoyable.   If you like olives, you have to try the hot olives as appetizer.

It's very small so a reservation is almost necessary if you're going to eat around peak dinner hours. We had a reservation for two at 7:30pm on a Monday but ended up waiting about 20 minutes until a table was ready. This wasn't an issue since we just ordered a bottle of wine and enjoyed some of that while talking near the bar prior to being seated. \n\nAfter being seated our waitress apologized for the wait and told us that we would receive a free order of bruschetta (which was delicious btw) since it took a little while to be seated. The food came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and looked/smelled as good as we both hoped.\n\nThe. Food. Was. Amazing.\n\nMy date ordered the Carlesimo and I the Salvatore. It was one of the most flavorful dinners I've ever experienced and after we each took one bite we decided that we would be returning to Trattoria Contadina again. While both dishes were surprisingly delicious, I enjoyed the Salvatore the most.\n\nThis is a great spot for a date but don't tell too many people or else it will get too busy !", "author": "Jeff D."}

We were seated right away although we came without a reservation even though the restaurant was pretty packed. One minus: the tables were pretty close together and I felt like I was sitting in the lap of the dude next to me. You're welcome, dude.\n\nWe ordered bruschetta as well as two pasta dishes and a meat dish. I can't remember the names of the pasta, but one was some sort of chicken ravioli and the other was rigatoni with peas and other tasty things. The meat dish was veal with prawns, and was served with veggies and potatoes.\n\nI liked both pastas, but the rigatoni was the standout. Unfortunately, a couple of my dining partners bit into hard ravioli (I'm not talking al dente here, people). I didn't have that problem, but still found the ravioli less exciting. The veal and prawn dish was nice, although not thrilling by any means. \n\nContadina really deserves 3.5 stars but I'm rounding up to 4 because the service was on point.

Luckily, Trattoria Contadina was able to accommodate my girlfriend and I at the last minute. And I am glad they did! We started with delicious drinks (featuring some of my favorite spirits from St. George's), such as their Martinez. My girlfriend, the expert on such matters, said it was better than any other she'd had. We also started with a couple of delicious appetizers, the Mushrooms and the Pepper. The Mushrooms were good, but the Pepper stole the show - as you may have read in other reviews, the spicy tomato cream sauce is amazing, and it paired very well with the roasted bell pepper and delicious cheeses. For our main dishes, we had the Carbonara and the Gnocchi (with the prosciutto, peas and Point Reyes blue sauce). Wow! We'd had some Italian a couple of days before, and it just did not compare to this pasta. The blue sauce was very tasty, and the gnocchi were very well executed. Similarly, the Carbonara hit the spot. We finished off with some Fig gelato. I should also point out that our server made recommendations throughout the meal that were spot on. Thanks!\n\nAs we left that night, we noticed that the restaurant got busier after we arrived, so I'm not worried about this place sticking around.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-10", "description": "We have been patronizing this restaurant over 20 years now. Most recently, we had a fantastic experience with a large family gathering for our daughter's 16th Birthday party. It made me realize again, what a amazing gem this place is.\n\nWe had originally planned to meet at Capo's.  I was seduced by all the buzz and couldn't wait to try it. But, between their cash only policy, largest available table for 10, and then a draining experience of trying to navigate their ridiculous reservation policy (or lack thereof), a final conversation with their manager made me realize this place was just not interested in accommodating their customers for larger parties or special occasions. But, I digress a rant for another forum.\n\nWhen I finally capitulated on Capo's, after banging my head against the wall trying way too hard to make it work, I was all the more impressed with Trattoria Contadina. They called me right back, and were just amazing in collaborating with me to make our experience wonderful all around. They willingly set aside their upstairs section for my party, they agreed to let all the guests in 10 minutes early, before they were scheduled to open, and they were amazing in staging the guests in the area and then escorting us up to the party keeping the surprise perfectly intact.  Where I couldn't even get Capos to take any interest in helping me whatsoever, Trattoria Contadina went way above my expectations to set up a wonderful surprise family gathering. The night unfolded with everyone thoroughly enjoying themselves.\n\nThe service was top notch.  In addition to the arrival accommodations, without even asking, the restaurant had offered parking tips for my guests and offered us in advance our choice of a fixed price menu or diner's choice. They arranged for a dedicated server for water, dish removal service and other misc. requests. And, our waiter (Jesus) was professional, friendly, responsive and insightful with respect to the menu. \n\nAcross the board, all the dishes were fantastic. My family spent nearly four weeks traveling all over Italy in 2012, and I can assure you the food at Trattoria Contadina was authentic and as good as what we experience while in Italy. With the large party, we sampled many items from the menu. Just to touch on a few: 1) my brother couldn't stop talking about how tender and tasty his veal was (he said he can't wait to come back and order the exact same thing); 2) my daughter said her Gnocchi was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the best she had ever had (including her time in Italy); 3) the pesto risotto was to die for;  and, 4) the Caprese and Bruschetta brought me right back to my summer last year in Italy. Desserts were equally enjoyable with a particularly light and nice Tiramisu and, for the chocolate lovers, a Torta di Cioccolato that was rich and amazingly smooth and creamy to satisfy any chocoholic palate.\n\nEveryone left in good spirits and completely satisfied. And, as we were leaving, the manager (owner?) even passed on fond wishes and blessings on our daughter's special occasion. After having such consistently great experiences at this restaurant over the years and experiencing such wonderful and attentive service more recently for our special occasion, I can see why this restaurant remains so highly rated and has been such a great asset to San Francisco for so many years now. Capo's may have the buzz now; but, if they are to endure the test of time, they could take some lessons from Trattoria Contadina in the kind of customer care and authentic Italian hospitality that makes for a successful, enduring  establishment through the years in a highly competitive market. I may still try Capo's some day; but, after tonight, my true loyalty will always be with Trattoria Contadina.", "author": "Jeff M."}

The service is always fantastic - those dudes are ON IT. \n\nAlso, they are absolutely on top of accommodating my dietary needs.

It is also refreshing I don't have to explain what it means when I say gluten free. That can be a real bummer sometimes. Everything is fresh, the portions are quite generous - and I LOVE those darn roasted potatoes. :) Great wine selection too.\n\nI absolutely recommend this place.

There were no complaints on any of the other dishes.   We were seated on time and all the dishes were delivered hot and together.  The atmosphere and vibe from all the employees was warm, welcoming, and friendly.  Our waiter  offered a nice smile and excellent service throughout.  The restaurant is very well run.

If you don't get their tiramisu you certainly will regret it.  So very light and the flavors are devine.  Tiramisu is not one of my husband's favorite desserts, but he raved about this one.  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive.  Service all around was commendable. \n\nRestaurant is small and intimate so reservations may be a good thing.  Window seating is great for people watching..it is located on a residential corner.  We really wanted to take the cable car (runs right there on Mason) back to Union Square.

Although the general rating of this place is 4 stars right now, it just doesn't do it for me. \n\nEnvironment: tables are tightly packed together with barely and room to push your chair out. There is a small bar and upstairs about seating for 20 more. It actually seems like an illegal fire hazard to have seats so close and a staircase so narrow used to get upstairs. Oh and by the way, you pass an outside bathroom sink on the way. Overall clean though. \n\nFood: \n-small spinaci salad - was enough for 2, but nothing special \n- Carlesimo - indicated as a house specialty on menu. Tasty, creamy tomato sauce with mushrooms. Better of the two pastas ordered. \n-Salvatore - homemade chicken ravioli. Ravioli itself had good flavor, but the sauce was lacking flavor and depth. Made a pretty good sauce for myself by dipping these raviolis in the Carlismo sauce! \n\nDrinks: Pretty pricy and on the high side considering the prices of the food. House cab by the glass - $9. \n\nParking: Harder than normal since the cable car is nearby as well as the hilly areas surrounding the location. \n\nOverall: Not really worth it for the prices. Not bad, but not great. Not likely to return. There are many other Italian restaurants in the area that will give this place a run for its money.", "author": "Rachelle T."}

Caesar salad had wonderful dressing.  This review only gets 3 stars because our main entrees were \"just OK\".  Chicken Marsala and veal.  For the price, there should have been more on the plates.  My veal wasn't tender (had to cut it with a steak knife ) and the brocollini was cold.

The pesto is magnifique (insert correct spelling, cheesy accent, and kiss ur finger tips)  Service is great, ambiance is cozy (more like snug), and if you don't mind practically cuddling with the patrons sitting beside you, then the setting is quite charming.  I quite enjoy ease dropping on other people's first dates, drama, and topics of convo, so this suites me just fine.\n\nI live about three blocks away, so not only is it incredibly convenient, but in my opinion, the best Italian I've had in SF.  Perfect date spot.  I once heard a friend refer to this place as the \"closer\".  So guys, if you want to make a charming first impression, take a date to this place and you will be recognized as a man with good taste, romantic style, and intriguingly  humble in his selected surroundings.\n\nThe only reason I didn't go with a 5 star, is because the bread sucks.  In my opinion, the bread bowl at Italian restaurants is a staple that makes a tasty impression, which should give the diner a promising feeling for the upcoming entree.  Just like chips and salsa at a Mexican spot.  But the bread at Trattoria Contadina has that rock hard crust that doesn't exactly melt in your mouth, no matter how much oil you douse it in!

It also made me realize that unless you are a tourist, why would you eat at a traditional Italian restaurant in SF, when there are SO many other great restaurants? Everything I ordered came EXACTLY how I expected and everything was good, but nothing was mind blowing. \n\nI ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and a beet /arugula/pistachio/goat cheese salad. The gnocchi tasted fresh and was very traditional (no new American spin on gnocchi) and the sauce was good, but nothing great. The salad was pretty good, but after all, it's just a salad.\n\nOverall I think Trattoria Contadina is WAY better than most of the Italian Restaurants in North Beach (most of which are not very good and very touristy) and if you are looking for traditional Italian food in North Beach, I would recommend this place.

They wanted to go to this place because we all really enjoyed it last time we were here. \n\nWhen we arrived at Trattoria  Contadina,  there was a private party going on, taking up the entire restaurant.  The hostess told us that someone should have informed us when we made the reservation that there was a party going on (they didn't) and that they were bussing our table and it would be ready momentarily.  15 minutes later,  they were apparently still bussing our table, my parents and I were standing outside (we couldn't go inside because the private party was inside) waiting for our table, and the hostess was making absolutely no attempt to help us in any way.  In fact, she was busy talking on her cell phone trying to secure a private tour of the Whitehouse for her mom.  \n\nSo now we've been waiting for almost 30 minutes,  it's my parents' anniversary, and we are standing outside waiting for a table that never materialized, and no one is trying to help us at all. We couldn't even go inside and sit at the bar.  So we left.

I was trying to do something nice for my parents and the was night completely ruined.  Thanks Trattoria Contadina. I have never been so appalled by such awful service, and I do not recommend this place to anyone.\n\nNot to worry, I believe the hostess managed to secure that private Whitehouse tour for her mom.", "author": "Nicole G."}

When you walk in, you immediately realize that this classic american-italian eatery is snugly tucked into a room the size of  a neighborhood corner bar. It's small, tables are close together, and it's pretty warm in there. That being said, it's effectively charming rather than unpleasant. The service paces the meal well, and is attentive and friendly.\n\nThe food is ok. They have all of the heavily sauced and cheesed items that you'd expect. (quick up-front tip: don't take anybody here who's shy about veal; there are like nine veal dishes on the menu and veal stock is prominently featured in the sauces for several others) \n\nThe pasta doesn't taste freshly made, especially the ravioli which had a nice nutty cream sauce, but a little bit of a gluey chew to it. Penne with tomato sauce was weak. Veal scallopini was good, but came out drowning in a deep rich sauce. \n\nOverall: The atmosphere is charming, the wait staff is attentive, the flavors are predictably okay, but nothing mind-blowing, and \"fresh\" won't be the word foremost in your mind on your way out the door.", "author": "Bo J."}

I helped pick my sisters plate out, the Pavaratti - prosciutto, chicken, zucchini in a cream sauce. Also very delicious and light. The pastas come in half or full dishes which was a nice touch because I hate being defeated by large plates of food. My mom got the halibut which tasted wonderful! The whole experience was great especially because the restaurant is so loving and well taken care of. It's a family run restaurant with a bunch of family photos.

The parking experience, that is. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could since parking is not their fault but since it directly affected our experience, I feel I have to address it. We had reservations at 7:30 and after circling the area numerous times, I called to let them know we would be late. They were not able to accommodate our tardiness and pushed our reservation back to 9:00. It left me with a not so great feeling but whatever. We ended up having to drive back to our hotel since there was no parking ANYWHERE (even the garages were full, we were willing to pay extra to make this reservation!). My husband and I had a few drinks at the hotel bar and then cabbed it back to make the 9:00 reservation. \n\nAs soon as we walked in, we completely understood why they couldn't seat us. I had no idea it was that small! People seemed to be crowded in as tightly as they could and I was immediately excited -- couldn't wait to taste the food that would cause people to cram into each other so! We were promptly seated and as the hostess took us back, I discovered she was taking us upstairs to an even tinier room where we were sat in the corner. The ambiance was so lively and animated that I didn't mind being in the corner one bit. \n\nWe quickly ordered a bottle of their house Sangiovese and celebrated that we had finally made it and were about to start our meal. I ordered a Caesar salad to start and my husband ordered a stuffed pepper. The Caesar salad was very good, I could definitely tell the dressing was made in house. It was not the best I've ever had but I would order again. My husband's pepper was stuffed with A LOT of cheese but he loved it and the tomato cream sauce was outstanding. For our main courses, we asked the waiter what pastas, if any, they made in house. He mentioned the raviolis, gnocchi and meatballs were all made fresh in the kitchen. So my husband ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the meat ravioli with tomato sauce. The gnocchi was very tasty but as with any gnocchi dish, became somewhat boring of the same taste & texture over and over again. He finished about half and I think if we come again we might order the small and split that dish. The meat ravioli with tomato sauce was the clear winner. The sauce was light and fresh and clearly had wine in it. I fell in love instantly. In my head, I quickly tried to figure out how to tweak my own tomato sauce recipe to mimic theirs, that's how good it was. The meat ravioli itself was prepared well and seemed to be cooked and seasoned perfectly. You could definitely tell it was fresh pasta.

We took other yelp suggestions and tried this place and could not have been happier.  It is a small hole in the wall type place and the food was excellent.\n\nThe quarters are a bit tight, but that is how real Italian places usually are.  The food was great and they allow you to pick your size plate so you don't have a huge amount of food wasted.  We did a Caprese salad for an appetizer and it was great.  The pasta dishes have great selection and if you like Veal Scalapini you have tons of choices.\n\nDesert we did a sorbet and tiramisu...very good dessert.\n\nOverall we recommend this place. The staff is very nice and could not be more personnable.\n\nFor a bottle of wine, three entrees, two desserts, coffee and one appetizer the total came to about 145 before tax and tip.  Not bad not great but overall the food and experience was wonderful.  The bar is expensive if you plan on having a drink before you eat.", "author": "Chris M."}

There were so many good looking dishes, it was hard to choose. One of my favorites is eggplant parmesana. Every time I order this at any other restaurant it is breaded pieces of eggplant with some type of marinara sauce and pasta. I thought their melanzane was going to be perfect, but it turned out to be nothing more than pasta with little chunks of eggplant. Pretty disappointing.

They were a little slow coming to give us bread and take our order initially, but the food came up quickly once we ordered. Everything, from the bread to the pasta itself, was delicious. I had the salvatore and thought the larger size was perfect - but then I was hungry. Less hungry people were happy with their smaller portions. I'd brought cupcakes to share afterward, and we weren't sure we'd be allowed to eat them in the restaurant. They were in fact very accommodating and even offered us plates for them! Hence the 4.5 stars.\n\nUnfortunately they lose a star for asking us if we were done because people were waiting for our table. We'd paid the bill, but we were still finishing up our conversation, and it was a bit jolting to be asked if we were \"just about finished.\" I don't know if they felt like we should leave since we'd eaten an outside dessert, but if so they should have just told us we couldn't eat the cupcakes inside. That said, I would definitely go back as the rest of the experience was good.\n\nPS. I called beforehand to ask about parking, and they recommended a lot on Vallejo and Powell...it's $3/hr, cheaper than most.", "author": "Emily W."}

The owner greeted me and gave me some meal suggestions.\n\nI ended up getting the half order of caprese salad which was tasty. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was fresh. Your meal comes with fresh baked bread with butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I chose Carlesimo as my entree. It was delicious. The dish had a lot of pancetta, peas and sun-dried tomatoes in it. It wasn't just pasta.  The spiced tomato cream sauce is what makes this dish. \n\nI opted out of getting dessert even though the selection looked amazing. However, the owner and I got to talking about work and traveling and I was given a delicious dessert drink. It is a must. It was a warm tiramisu cocktail.

Prior to dinner, we enjoyed a martini at Capp's Corner (major old school Italian character) and should have stayed there for dinner. Here it goes...\n\nThe special salad of Burrata & Speck was lovely (pretty sure the main components are not made in-house). The Antipasti Meatballs were under seasoned with a texture of boiled meat. The sauce was watery. A plate of sin that had us debating on canceling the next two courses. The beautiful Brunello kept us in a hopeful mood. The Carlesimo Pasta was not in a spicy creamy sauce as stated on the menu. It was loaded fatty pancetta. The pasta itself was perfectly al dente but NOT made in-house. The grand finale had my Italian boyfriend envisioning a roman rolling over in the grave. The Veal Saltimbocca was overcooked and topped with partially melted mozzarella. It floated in a pool of marsala water. Simply awful. The broccolini was barely cooked and the garlic was raw. We ate one bite and started chugging our vino so we could leave. I did mention that the Saltimbocca was \"not good\" and the waiter was too busy to apologize. We paid for that dish. Our bill was over $350.00 bones and we are still seething a week later. \n\nThankfully, the rest of the trip was filled with amazing eats. Sadly, we did not eat another Italian meal.", "author": "Staci W."}

I usually go to Yelp as a rule when visiting a new city. For the most part star ratings are fairly accurate. Trattoria Contadina was very good overall. I ordered the bruschetta, peppers with creamy tomato sauce and the pesto dish with chicken and zucchini. The bruschetta and peppers with creamy tomato sauce were both outstanding. The pesto dish was good. My wife thought her dish with the eggplant was OK....We both thought the prices were in the high side. Also, their online menu shows half portion prices as well as full. That turns out to be old and outdated. There is only one set price for each dish.  The prices on the online menu are less than what the actual menu prices are as well. Overall a good experience.

After some pre-dinner drinks @ Vesuvio on Columbus, we were happy to see that this restaurant is a bit off the beaten path of the rest of the cat calling restaurants on Columbus as you enter North Beach (beyond Stinkin' Rose). \n\nThe place probably seats about 40 max, so reservations are definitely recommended. We arrived for reservations at 8pm, the place was packed, but we got seated immediately.\n\nMy wife had called ahead to say that she was vegan, and had asked whether they could accommodate her. Although Contadina is not a vegan restaurant, it is definitely vegan friendly, and the owner was adamant that we should come, and they would assign a \"vegan-aware\" server to our table.\n\nThe service was impeccable. They indeed took care of us, and our quirks, and were super nice and friendly as well as accommodating. \n\nThe bread they serve is absolutely divine. Some sort of amazing home baked sourdough bread which isn't too sour. Absolutely delicious (with some garlic infused olive oil... yum!).\n\nWe ordered the anti-pasti (which was meh, btw. The cheese is pretty blah, and the meats, well... I'm very peculiar and have very high standards when it comes to cold cuts, having had the privilege of indulging on some of the best hams (bellota) in the world). This is where I take off a star.\n\nThe mains however, were fantastic: the veal saltimbocca was very rich, but also very good ! The asparagus it came with were perfectly cooked, and the veal was soft and tender. The other veal dish was the Correnti, which consists of pan saut\u00e9ed veal scaloppini topped with a porcini mushroom cream sauce and served with saut\u00e9ed Swiss chard penne pasta, it was absolutely divine.\n\nThe fresco is an awesome option for vegans/vegetarians. It was explosive w/ flavor, but mind you, you gotta like the garlic, and accept the fact that there will be a 3 meter radius of empty space surrounding you for the next few days.\n\nThe one additional sore mark in the dishes we ordered are specific to the Linguini Vongole, which consists of linguini pasta with saut\u00e9ed clams and a lemon, butter, garlic and white wine sauce. This dish was far to acidic and bitter, and we left it untouched. Thankfully, the service here is so good that they did not charge this dish to our bill.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic meal with some minor sore points, impeccable service, and a really warm, exciting atmosphere.

The food was great, but it was the experience as a whole that merits the five stars. \n\nArrived around 7:30 on a crowded Sunday night w/o a reservation. The two couples who arrived right before us both had reservations, so I thought we'd be looking at a long wait. Nope! The hostess was nice as can be when we said we didn't have a reservation (sometimes they look at you with derision when you dare to show up without one), and got us seated within about 5 minutes. \n\nThe atmosphere at the restaurant was very cozy and warm, but clearly in an urban setting. The front room was somewhat small, but we were seated in a hidden little room upstairs, which was wonderful -- out of the way and not cramped. Patrons were a wide mix of ages and types -- there was a group of 8 in their early 20s in jeans, alongside tables with very nicely-dressed couples in their 50s, and everything in between. The staff seemed equally nice to everyone.\n\nThe food was delicious. First, the bread -- yum! Served with olive oil, and there is balsamic on the table, which my husband thought was much tastier than normal balsamic. \n\nWe started by sharing the large size of the Caprese salad. (Note: they have multiple sizes of a number of their dishes, which is a really nice feature). There were three slices of tomato, a mix of greens, and the most delicious mozzarella I have ever tasted. We devoured it. My husband ordered the linguine with meatballs. The meatballs were delicious -- moist, perfectly seasoned.

Everyone I was with enjoyed the food and we all got the smaller portions, which was plenty.  The service was outstanding.  Highly recommend if your in the area as it could be the best italian you have ever had.", "author": "David C."}

The walls are lined with pics from celebrities who have dined there over the years.  It's got a nice mix of locals and tourists, which makes for great people watching.  It's also right on the cable car line so it has a fantastic San Francisco feel.  I've ordered many of the pastas during my visits and always come away impressed.  The stuffed pepper appetizer is particularly impressive.  The wait staff is very good at their job and the owners are visible and friendly.  It's a real family run operation.

They also have meat and fish plates.  Their salads are a high note, with good interpretations of the tried and true caprese and caeser salads.  The ambiance, however, is what bumps this place up to 4 stars.  It is set on the corner of Mason Street, so you get the dinging and rumbling of cable cars just outside the windows.  The requisite celebrity photos and cozy decor make this neighborhood place a good bet for an unpretentious dinner with folks you aren't trying to impress.", "author": "Aaron S."}

But I'm also beginning to appreciate the simplicity of homemade mac and cheese and a hearty beef stew much more. That's why this old restaurant has become my new favorite in North Beach--it's Italian comfort food in a comfortable, homey setting.\n \nMy friend and I began with the Impepata di Vongole e Cozze (steamed clams and mussels in broth), which would've been better if the shellfish were larger and there was more of them. For $15, I don't believe we even got 15 clams. I'll bypass this next time and try the Polenta e Funghi instead.\n\nNext we split the Gnocchi alla Napolentana ($16) and the Linguini con Polpettine alla Santucci ($17). These dishes were classic but squisita! Although the ricotta gnocchi was a little chewy, the tomato and cheese sauce was creamy good. The meatballs in the linguini were beautifully seasoned and the tomato sauce simply delicious. This restaurant does classic food right.\n\nService was nothing short of wonderful.

I'm glad we took his advice.  The seating is limited, so I'm also glad we made a reservation.  It's also tight, so be prepared to hear other peoples conversations(or them hear yours).  When we walked in, our table wasn't free yet, so we ordered a drink at the bar and waited for our table.  I ordered a Drakes Hefewiezen.  This was my first time drinking it, so I didn't know what to expect.  I wasn't a big fan of it at first, but continued to sip it as we waited for our table.  When we got to our table, the guy tending the bar, who I think was the owner, came over with a new beer from a fresh keg and notified me that the next Drakes he pulled was the last of the keg, so mine was probably flat.  The new beer was much better, and I'm glad he made the effort as I probably would have just finished my first (and last) Drakes. As we looked over the menu and eventually ordered, all of the staff was friendly and helpful with any questions that we had.  This place truly has that family owned feel.  On to the food...  We ordered the meatball appetizer and bruschetta (antipasti).  The meatballs were possibly the best Italian meatballs I have ever had, and the sauce that came with them was amazing.  The brushetta was also very good.  Then onto the main course, I had the Salvatore(chicken ravioli), which was awesome, and my co-worker had the gnocchi with asiago tomato cream sauce, which I tried and almost wished I had ordered that instead...Until I took another bite of mine.  The sauces were all wonderful.  After we finished our meals, we ordered desert.  I had the hazelnut gelato.  It arrived in a dish with much more than I was expecting.  I quickly noticed that some of it was very crystallized as if it was melted and re-froze.  Thankfully, the top two scoops were not this way.  They were rich and creamy as I had hoped for, and two scoops was probably all I needed.\nOverall, the food was great, the service was great, the atmosphere was OK.  The only negatives were the flat beer, which was corrected without me saying anything, and my desert, which I'm sure they would have corrected had I said something.  The next time I am in SF, I will likely try this place again (even with all of the other options)\nGreat Job Trattoria Contadina and thank you to the guy at the Giants game, who recommended this place.", "author": "Josh G."}

Is this perfect Italian food in San Francisco?\n\nBy george, I think it is!\n\nCame here the other night to celebrate my best friend quitting her job.  (A move that, in my opinion was at least 6 months in coming - definitely worth celebrating.)  We didn't have reservations as we ambled up at 7:15 on a Friday night.  (Yes, we were that bold, believing in our universe driven right - no - NEED to celebrate.)  The hostess politely told us that it would be a 2 1/2 hour wait.  Even seating at the bar wasn't available.  Well, we stood outside to talk it over.  (Really, I think we were incapable of moving any farther away from the maddeningly delicious scents wafting out the doorway.)  All of a sudden, the universe (having driven us here in the first place), in the form of the hostess, said to us, \"Come in.  I think those people with the reservations aren't coming.\"  And the next thing we knew, we were seated at a cozy little table near a window.  \n\nThe rest of a the evening is a delightful swirl of rich and flavorful food, wine and conversation.  We had the clams & mussels appetizer, with lots of bread to soak up the white wine sauce.  I had an enormous plate of pasta with chicken, sundried tomatoes, zucchini, peas and cream sauce (1/2 for lunch the next day, it was so large).  Best friend had pasta as well, with chicken, pancetta, and an amazing red sauce.  For dessert we split something we'd never seen before (but certainly plan to devour again at our earliest convenience): limoncella tiramisu.  \n\nAnd with that, our meal was complete.  Everything we had was incredibly flavorful (but not the same flavors, as can sometimes happen at lesser Italian restaurants).  The total bill, before tax was around $90.  Very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food.  Service was excellent.  Ambience was warm and cozy.\n\nI'd go back in a heartbeat.  But I'd probably make reservations.

Where we gonna hold the celebrating party? At Trattoria Contadina of course!! I am told by my sister that this place existed here even when I roamed the streets as a lad here, but I don't remember too much....  it's nice seeing the cable cars go by - big spacious windows - and of course SF Muni stops here also and noticed each and every passenger and those getting off at the corner bus stop look to the restaurant windows....  When I initially walked in, my senses were pleasantly overcome by the strong aroma of olive oil and garlic - lots of it! I thought I was in Spain or Italia again...  (no such luck). I ordered the swordfish with raisins and almonds in a light gravy, served with asparagus. Except for the usual obvious lack of salt a la americana, the swordfish was sooo delicious ~ I was not disappointed! I had a very nice slightly dry white house wine, and it went great with the fish. I noticed that unlike other restaurants I've been to since arriving in the states two years ago, this place was cooking with REAL garlic and not that bottled crap that's diced...  I saw and ate real garlic!! The asparagus was firm yet tasty and not hard. It was totally a very delicious experience and to make it more interesting, the couple who sat next to us had some time in a location when I was there at the very same time, plus knows of my little seaside town in Spain! wow!! The place was packed as we walked in, and quickly filled up after we sat. The unisex bathroom waaay in the back and to the left was tiny, homey and reminded me right away of Spain and/or Italia! Braaaavo!! If you turn around - or TRY to turn around - you may end up stuck or outside!   :-D  The only downside I can see of this tiny corner location were the tables were waaay too close for comfort to each other ~ BUT thar's an UPside to that: you can practically taste and smell your table-neighbors' entrees and perhaps what you'll be ordering on your next visit here!!

Not only was I SHOCKED to find swordfish here BUT in just a few minutes, it was served!! That's amazing, and the restaurant was packed!!!", "author": "Tony L."}

Food was good but $13 for a caprese salad?  The tomatoes were really cold and not very ripe, the dish overall not seasoned well.  Maybe I'm being a bit harsh because I just had a $13 lobster/burrata/heirloom tomato salad at Bar Crudo two nights prior but I felt a bit ripped off.\nPastas were both tasty and large portions, but again, $17 for linguine with sausage?  \n\nAll in all, good food at inflated prices...I love the neighborhood feel to the place (our hostess and waiter were both great) but doubt I'll be returning anytime soon...there are too many other good options for the price.", "author": "phil h."}

For most of the past 6 years, Trattoria Contadina has been my go to spot.  Why?  Because it's damn good Italian food without pretensions.  You can have your A 16's, your Delfinas, and your SPQR's.  My grandmother would not set foot in those places.  Ever!  Why?  Because they're not even run by Italians!!!!  My personal list of most hated Bay Area thingies goes: Delfina, A 16, and then the tree sitters.  See the connection?  They're all posers!!\n\nOn to Contadina.  I went there for the first time in a long time a few weeks with my girlfriend.  (If you LOVE this place so much, why have we never gone there?)  As usual, the meal did not disappoint.  If you are looking for specific advice on what to order, I'll narrow it down for you: EVERYTHING!  Oops.  That probably did not help.  I say everything because I mean everything is awesome.  If you have to pick just a few, I would go with the Rigatoni Melazane, the Gnocchi, and the Capellini.  The Polenta Funghi is a awesome starter.  How good are the desserts?  I wouldn't know because I have never had enough room after dinner.\n\nSo if I love this place so much, why not 5 stars?  Because it's crowded and often a little too hot inside.  I have never left there without a nice lather.  More than you needed to know about my sweat glands, but something you need to know if you sweat a lot.  Your first date might think you're a freak.  That's ok, because she will be impressed that you took her here for some real Italian food and not some pretentious low grade dog food at Delfina.", "author": "Chris I."}

I work in North Beach, and was wondering when I would find \"my\" Italian restaurant, one that I could go to incognito and never mention to the tourists I talk to all day.  This is that restaurant.\n\nI wanted to treat myself and a friend to an indulgent Italian meal one night.  I was poking around on Yelp when I co-worker told me about this place.  She said, \"This is one of my magical spots in the city.  This is where I take my mom when she's in town. This is where my boyfriend and I go when we want a romantic meal.  This is where my best friend and I go when we want to go out together and be girly and eat amazing food and talk girl talk over a bottle of wine.\"  Needless to say, I had to try it out.\n\nSo, my friend and I wandered over there, taking a welcome turn off Columbus and into the quiet side streets of North Beach.  There was a 40-minute wait when we got there, which we used to start with wine and appetizers at the bar.  The wine was divine, and the cantaloupe/prosciutto appetizer was an unexpectedly amazing combination.  I don't know if we actually spent 40 minutes at the bar, joking around with the friendly bartender, but it seemed like very little time went by before we had a table.\n\nI had the rigatoni with eggplant and tomatoes; she had the chicken tortellini in heart-attack-inducing cream sauce.  We got drunk on wine and shot the shit about work and boys and life in general.  We laughed, we cried, we came nowhere near to finishing our pasta dishes.  We left with take-out tiramisu for the co-worker who had made it all possible, plus visions of delectable leftovers for our lunches the next day.\n\nSometimes restaurants are okay.  Sometimes they are amazing.  And sometimes you have a meal that you would happily repeat every second of from start to finish, from the company to the food to the warm, garlic-and-wine-induced vibe in the room.  Trattoria Contadina gave me that meal, and I keep wondering how soon I'll be able to make it back.", "author": "Martha T."}

The menu has a nice array of vegetarian (or vegetarian-able) choices, and the wine list looked good (although we didn't imbibe).  The bread with olive oil was ok.\n\nWe came in early, when it seems the place is popular with families with young kids - the place was LOUD. The family next to us popped open a DVD player and put in Sesame Street and pumped up the volume and I began to wonder if I would be continuing my rude parents rant from Duck's Nest . If I had wanted to watch TV I would have stayed home, where I have a choice of what I'm watching (and hearing).  However, in this case, the business cares - we were promptly moved to a table where we could hear the music and not Grover and were treated with respect and understanding of our desire to move. \n\nAlso on the theme of the owners caring, staff was busy putting up covers on the air conditioning. I suspect they have heard about the overheated problem, so then installed air conditioning. However, the cold air blasts on the tables below, so now they are putting redirection covers on the vents.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-03-09", "description": "I've lived here for 11 years now, so I'm way past shiny bars and fireplaces to attract me to a restaurant. I'd dive into the darkest hovels of Chinatown if it served mind-bendingly great food. So for me, a place is all about the food - ambience takes second. Fortunately for Trattoria Contadina, they're getting rated on their food and not their decor, otherwise I'd bust them down to 2 out of 5 stars.\n\nThe pasta I ordered at first looked like a small portion, but that was deceptive. In the end, the portion was more than enough to stuff me. The problem was that the food really wasn't that good, and for a restaurant that's allegedly a 'go to' place, I'm failing to see how this place gets such good ratings. The pasta itself tended to be chewy and unevenly cooked and the ravioli tasted bland. The one saving grace was that the sauce was decent, although nothing I'd come back for. My girlfriend had a similar experience, so we ended up tasting one another's dishes to keep from getting too bored with our own.\n\nService: here Trattoria Contadina gets a meager 2/5. The restaurant was less than half full, and the hostesses were camping out at the bar chatting, yet nary a waitress was to be seen. I had to flag down a bus-boy to get my parmasean grated for me. Lame. The waitress also didn't even bother to offer me a pepper grind, but when the people next to us were seated, they got it. Pathetic. Just pathetic. I was also pretty hacked off that the bartender took a good five minutes to pour me a glass of $6 wine while he yacked away with some guy and casually took his time to make 2 martinis. Sigh. So much for customer service... I guess their work ethic is that they'll take care of me when they get around to it.\n\nHot tip to wait staff: if you want a tip of any kind, you have to give service... I work for my money and I don't give it away to random people I don't know unless they give me something in value in return, so you have to work for it too.\n\nPricing: There are two measures of prices for me: 1) what seems reasonable based on volume, and 2) what seems reasonable based on quality. For the volume of food, the prices were maybe a couple bucks above reasonable. But for quality, fah-getta-bout it! It's overpriced for what you get. And as for the wine... sheez... they offer up vinos in the multi-hundred dollar range and can't make a good pasta? My slow glass of Berenger White Zin cost $6... the entire bottle costs maybe $4.50 at Safeway. If the food was good, maybe I wouldn't care so much about that, but sheez. Any why a white zin? Because all the other wine by the glass is way overpriced... $8 and $9 for what they were serving? Ridiculous.\n\nDecor: unfortunately this is where I go into full-on ream mode. Trattoria Contadina looks like it got stuck in the early '80s and never bothered to look forward. Local charm for a neighborhood classic is one thing, but neglect and nasty-ass '70s wood paneling are something completely different. Given I have 8 bazillion choices for Italian food in North Beach, I can find a place with bad decor with better food, so if Trattoria Contadina can't compete on its food alone, I'm more likely to take my business somewhere else.\n\nOn the wall are fading photos of athletes long retired and disco stars like Donna Summer. Seriously, Donna Summer. I don't think I saw a single personality on the wall newer than Robb Nen when he played for the Giants. The wood paneled walls look like the living room from That '70s Show, and the sink in the hallway --- which ALL customers have have to squeeze by to get upstairs to eat --- is a really tacky touch. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that if you're looking for a place to impress with somebody with your culinary tastes or preference for nice decore, Trattoria Contadina strikes out on both counts, in big ways.\n\nWe both left very disappointed. We'll definitely be back exploring North Beach again - it's been years since I stomped around there. But Trattoria Contadina will not be on my list of places to return to unless Gordon Ramsay sweeps through and gives the kitchen and decor an enema. \n\nSorry, it's just not worth the ratings it's getting. It just isn't.", "author": "Gregg G."}

This lady, I think she said her name was Sebastian, saw me searching around the touristy area.  She recommended this spot, and I am very glad she did.  What a charming little spot.  We arrived around 5:45 pm.  The place was empty.  By the time we left, at 7:00, the place was mobbed.  \nI had the bell pepper appetizer, and was blown away.  The ravioli was just what I was looking for, and left me looking forward to eating here again.\nThe deserts were mediocre at best, but not the reason to go here.\nThis really is a cute \"date place.\"  Eat here soon.

We took the cable car and it let us off right at the corner.  Even though we were 15 minutes early, they seated us immediately.  The seating was really tight because we had a big group near us and another big group that hadn't arrived yet.  \n\nWe just went straight for the entre course because the meals we saw were huge!  My wife had pasta with a vodka sauce (I forget what meat and veggies were on it because I was way too into my own plate.)  Mine was sliced Italian sausage, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, and ear shaped pasta tossed with olive oil.  Luscious, fattening, and probably the best Italian meal I ever had.  We both had a nice Chianti with it that was under $10/glass.  My wife and I had to each take half home. Poor people on the cable car had to smell my garlic.  \n\nThe only downer was the big group was celebrating some business success and were very drunk, loud and annoying.  Everyone kept toasting and I got bumped a few times.  It was a bunch of 30 something yuppie looking people that didn't give a damn about anyone else in the restaurant.

It is a nice small place off the main streets, facing the houses, which helps me forget that I am in North Beach and just spent half an hour finding parking. The hostess asked us if we would prefer the window or the \"tapestry\", which I thought was a rather silly question (yes, the window thank you).\n\nInsalata caprese with sliced tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella was very refreshing, carpaccio was sliced very thinly indeed (can you pick it up cleanly? I sure can't). \n\nBut what struck my attention and what earned the stars it did was one of the \"special entrees\", a bistecca di calamari, a nice big hunk of squid dipped in egg and pan sauteed in butter and lemon and garlic. A quarter of a lemon if you can't get enough of that. Something I have never seen in an Italian restaurant in California, and something that suits my tastes very well. The squid was very tender and it certainly was the softest squid I have ever eaten, but not without losing its elasticity. The egg coating was evenly cooked all around, which shows that the kitchen staff has good skills. Did I eat the vegetables that came with it? I don't think so.\n\nRavioli with pink tomato cream sauce was also a very nice entree, but my squid was better. I don't usually go out to eat pasta, since it's sort of an annoying concept that it costs so little yet they charge you just like another entree. That and very rarely have I thought that I just had godly pasta in a restaurant. \n\nIn the end an absolute MUST is to eat their tiramisu. It is made in the house, and it is THE best tiramisu I have encountered. Do not try to be polite, do not make excuses, eat the damn thing. \n\nIt ended up being a very worthy place to know for such out of town guests as I had to entertain that evening. Got to drive over the hills, let them walk around silly North Beach, watch the cable cars, with a restaurant that keeps letting you know you're in San Francisco. A tourist's place that a tour guide wouldn't mind too much going to, which was exactly what I was that evening.", "author": "Daria J."}

Eggplant cooked just right, sauce so flavorful and tangy with the olive, luscious stringy cheese. Had my mouth watering for the main course!\nI had the nightly special of red snapper with artichokes in a red sauce, unfortunately it fell completely flat. The fish was clearly not fresh, with a very \"fishy\" smell, and way overcooked almost to the point of being gelatinous. The artichokes were straight from a can, tough and flavorless, the sauce was completely bland, probably so as not to mask the delicate flavor the fish was supposed to have, but it needed more to hide the fishiness. Served with roasted potatoes that were, well, roasted potatoes with no seasoning. The highlight was the spinach sauteed with garlic, which was very tasty, I wished I had more!\nBased on all the other reviews I think it's worth another try, just maybe stick with one of the everyday dishes they may have had a chance to perfect.", "author": "Mark C."}

I've been to Italian restaurants in NYC's Little Italy and Boston's North End, but nothing in recent memory has come close. For starters, I really like their menu. It's a good mix between comfort food and challenging dishes you wouldn't try making at home. The price range is extremely reasonable for Italian food and they have an extensive drink menu (didn't see any beer though).\n\nWe ordered the special of the day which was a pasta with many types of seafood along with spaghetti and meatballs and chicken marsala. The seafood pasta was hands-down the favorite of the table. The spaghetti and seafood pasta both had red sauces, but they both had their own unique flavors which was really nice. The chicken marsala was decent, but the chicken breasts were thick and therefore a little dry.  All in all, it was a really well-rounded meal. The waitress was really accommodating too. My parents are not big fans of cheese and they were able to make the appropriate accommodations. They didn't give us the look when we wanted to share dishes between us either.", "author": "Sutee D."}

I jump on a cable car, pose for some photos, reluctantly sniff some ass that is shoved carefully in front of my face since people need to stand outside cuz its just that rad (ok ok...I like standing outside too...). And see this place. Right on the corner of the cable car line, and not on Broadway...SCORE!\n\nThe restaurant is full, but there are only maybe 10-15 tables. So, if you want to go on a weekend...plan ahead (I went on a Monday)! I plop down at the 4 seat bar right away...one seat is left available.\n\nThe food is solid. Its not legendary, but its solid, and its pretty cheap. The best part was everything blended together nicely instead of one thing overpowering something else. Nice specialty drink menu too. None of that girly shit...they bring the classic liquor. Bonus points there.\n\nHonestly, what I liked most about this place, and what earned it the 4th star was the feel of the joint. It was super comfortable, but not divey. Its like being an invited guest in someone's house. The wait staff loves to talk to you, but they are ultra-attentive in their service without looking over your shoulder way too much. \n\nI'll be back because its a solid spot in a neighborhood that I need to know more about.

We didn't have a reservation, but the hostess easily accommodated us, with fair warning that she needed the table by 6:45.  \n\nOn the menu, there were two prices.  The waitress said there are two sizes, one that is more of an antipasti size and the other is entree sized.  We decided to start off with the Antipasti Contadina, and ordered the smaller Rigatoncelli alla Carlesimo, a smaller Fettucine con Salsiccia alla Vincenzo  and a dinner Fettucine con Salsiccia alla Vincenzo.  I had a peach margarita, which for $9, was much bigger than I expected.  \n\nThe Antipasti Contadina was quite a spread.  Meats and cheese, artichokes, peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, delicious.  The three of us finished it off just as the pastas arrived.  Well, I was certainly glad I got the smaller size.  The larger Fettucine con Salsiccia alla Vincenzo  was HUGE!  Both dishes were very good, but the Rigatoncelli alla Carlesimo was clearly the winner of the two.  All the flavors went together wonderfully.  I'm not the biggest fan of sun dried tomatoes, but the ones here, both in my pasta and in the Antipasti, were extremely tasty. We finished the smaller portioned dishes, but my friend who ordered the large portion was unable to finish everything.

Instead of bringing me to some super new, trendy restaurant, he introduced me to a precious SF gem that's been around for decades, tried and true by various city luminaries and generations of regular folks. \n\nI loved the locale, just beyond the crazed sidewalks of North Beach, on a quiet corner and positively packed with couples and old regulars. Romance was definitely in the air. My boyfriend and I are big eaters, and this place definitely delivered on hearty delicious, classic Italian food. \n\nFirst we ordered a gigantic antipasto plate, a killer spread of meats, cheeses, olives and marinated peppers, artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes. I was in heaven, it was definitely one of the best charcuterie plates I've ever had. Then I tried the cream of carrot soup with garlic croutons, a special of the evening. It was a perfect balance of light fresh carrots blended with cream and spices, it wasn't heavy at all. And the garlicky croutons really hit it out of the ballpark. We tried a meatball swimming in their house made marinara. The sauce was to die for, and while the meatball didn't rival the ones at Emmy's, it was still delicious. By the time we got to our entr\u00e9es I was pretty stuffed. Isaac ordered the veal scalloppini w garlic mashed potatoes. I got the creamy pesto penne with fennel sausage, sundried tomatoes and spinach. It was HUGE. I definitely ate only a few bites, and finished the rest the next day at lunch, and had garlic breath for quite awhile afterwards. They brought us their signature drink, a warm wine drink with steamed milk and chocolate. It was foamy and not too sweet, the perfect after-dinner drink. \n\nThe service was awesome, and I loved the open kitchen. It really gave the whole place a more intimate feel. Our server brought everything out to us at a perfect pace and the owner seemed to be greeting and bidding farewell to everyone that came in.

Here, I have to add that this is the only restaurant I've ever been to that will not substitute one type of pasta for another in a dish, so I was limited in my choices as I hate dealing with  (and tend to make a mess with) long, thin unruly pasta.  \n\nWhen only one of the appetizers came out we started contemplating how they must be specially configuring the meal based on the odd number of dishes ordered and expected it would certainly come out with one of the pasta dishes in the next course.  When the two half orders of pasta came out, we asked the server and he had forgotten about the other dish.  We decided not to get it.  So then the question became, was I expected to sit with no food while my boyfriend ate his veal chop?  I shared one of the pastas and lingered over the other so as not to sit plateless during the next course when they brought out the last dish.\n\nMost of the food was only okay and the service quite poor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-12-01", "description": "Trattoria Contadina is a bit off the main Columbus Avenue North Beach strip.  It's a corner place that fills quickly and is obviously popular.  The walls are studded with pictures of celebrities of long ago and celebrity wanna bees of long ago.  The place has a reputation for serving good old time Italian food.  \n\nI start with a small spinach salad that comes with feta cheese, walnuts, cranberries and vinaigrette.  It's an OK plate of food but for the non-too-crunchy walnuts, which must have been around a bit too long.  A half order of spaghetti with meatballs is immense, but not immensely satisfying.  The spaghetti is cooked a bit beyond al dente, the meatballs are dense but largely tasteless and the tomato sauce bland.  \n\nI finish with a grilled veal chop with a balsamic vinegar reduction, red onion and capers sauce, served with fresh saut\u00e9ed garlic spinach and creamy soft polenta.  The chop cannot stand up to the bitter ill-conceived sauce, the spinach is overly salted, but the polenta is OK.\n\nThe menu is strange.  Many main courses come with sides of pasta, making it necessary to skip these if you want a pasta course.  The food seems old fashioned without having the old time subtlety or depth of flavor.", "author": "David D."}

The oil did not have any added seasonings like many chain Italian restaurants do, but my husband was pleasantly surprised that the oil had an \"infused\" flavor (hard to describe, but kind of like salt and garlic). We both enjoyed the arugula, beet, goat cheese and pistachio salad for an appetizer. I had the halibut, which was served with a wonderful fresh pesto sauce as well as roasted potatoes and garlic broccolini. My husband had the saltimbocca, which was served with mashed potatoes and broccolini. Those sides are without a doubt his two least favorite side dishes, but he enjoyed them. This restaurant is excellent at seasoning their dishes. Everything had just the perfect amount of garlic and we did not leave there feeling \"garlicky.\" We finished our meal with coffee, espresso and a mocha gelato pie. We could not have had a better meal in North Beach and would go back next time we travel to San Francisco. Even thought we are tourists, this restaurant seemed to be filled with primarily locals which is another way to know that it's a well-liked restaurant.", "author": "Theresa C."}

That was on a Thursday night 7:15PM for 5.  It is a very small place and all the tables were pretty much full.  Parking can be tough.  We lucked out and found a street spot just up Mason but I guess there is some public parking ~$3.20/each 20 min. around the corner on Powell.  We were seated in a middle round table so there was a lot of waiter traffic going by.  My wife complained that her chair kept getting bumped.  If you can get a table by the window you will have a nice view of the Trolley cars going up/down Mason.\n\nThey have a good wine list and a full bar.  You are served fresh hot bread with oil and basalmic vinegar which was very good.  I had a hard time deciding what to order.  I wanted something savory but not too filling.  I chose the small portion Salvatore (Chicken ravioli with sun-dried tomatoes, rosemary, garlic and a marscapone cheese sauce) and I have to say it was very good but I was really dissapointed in the portion size.  It was VERY small compared to the other diners small portions.  I'm glad my wife and I split a large Spinaci Salad (Baby spinach with feta cheese, spiced pecans, sun-dried cranberries and a balsamic vinaigrette) .  It was a good salad.  My wife had the small Pavarotti (Fusilli pasta with saut\u00e9ed chicken, prosciutto, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes and a cream sauce)  I wish I had ordered her dish.  It was delicious and seemed like a much larger portion.  My 9 year old daughter ordered the small Gnocchi.  One of the best I've tasted!  I would order that if I go back.  One friend ordered the small Vongole (Linguini pasta with saut\u00e9ed clams and a lemon, butter, garlic and white wine sauce ) which looked very good.  She was very happy with that.  And our other friend had the large Polpettine (Linguini pasta with Rocky's homemade meatballs and a fresh tomato sauce)  I tell you, his plate was huge!  And it looked awesome.  He was very pleased with his choice.  \n\nFor desert we all shared an order of the Tiramasu.  Awesome stuff!  We each easlily had a couple of bites.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and attentive.

Bro and I picked this place for dinner, made reservations, and got a present for the 'rents.  Had drinks at the hotel, gave said present (they cried), and took a cab to dinner.  We ran late but called ahead, and they had no problem pushing the reservation back (no attitude here!).  \n\nIt was HOT, and there was no AC, but since this kind of heat isn't exactly typical for the Bay Area, I won't hold it against the Trattoria.  We luckily had a table by the door.  And a round of mojitos helped cool us \"kids\" down.  \n\nSo the food.  Oh, the food.  So tasty.  Enough in the portions to satisfy the boys, yet not too overwhelming for the gals.  We started with brushetta (yum!) and a caprese salad to share - the tomatoes were fresh and plump and tasty.  The cream sauce with the gnocchi was to die for, and I loved my bow tie pasta with veggies and chicken.  So often veggies are over or under done when tossed with pasta - but not here.  The BF scarfed down his veal (not my favorite usually but even I enjoyed it!).  \n\nWe cleaned our plates and headed into dessert - but as it was after a bottle of wine and the aforementioned mojito, things started to get a little fuzzy in the ole noggin.  All I know is that we ordered 3 desserts and each one was spectacular.  \n\nAt this point the friendly waiter must have overheard us toasting our parents, wishing them a happy anniversary.  He quickly brought over 2 little glasses of limcello (spelling?) for them, on the house, and wished them well.

We arrived fifteen minutes prior to our reservation, but were still seated immediately.  Fresh bread and first press olive oil were brought post haste and we enjoyed it a good deal.\n\nThe waitress suggested a nice Chianti and we ordered the Bruschetta, which was excellent.  For entrees, I had the veal chop with garlic spinach and polenta.  Spinach was perfectly cooked without being soggy and the polenta was rich and creamy without being too runny or chunky.  The veal chop was also delicious, though a bit overwhelming as it was smothered in salty capers and pickled onions.  Still quite enjoyable. \n\nMy lady had the egg fettuccine with onions, peppers, Italian sausage.  Pasta perfectly aldente, veggies fresh, sauce just right.\n\nA delicious housemade tiramisu finished the meal.  We will definitely be back for more.", "author": "Evel K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-11-14", "description": "My search for good, authentic Italian food in the Bay Area continues.\n\nI thought Trattoria Contadina would have put an end to this search.  I heard so many good things about it via Yelp that I thought SURELY, this would be the place where I could get a nice dish of chicken parmigiana with a side of pasta.  That's all I was looking for.  Well made food, tasty, classic.\n\nAfter driving around looking for parking for at least 15 minutes and failing miserably we decided to park in a lot nearby which cost $10.  It was frustrating from the start.  \n\nWe finally arrived, starving and excited.  We sat down at a corner table ready to eat our faces off.  We were brought bread and a little bowl of olive oil.  The bread was cold, crustless and one-dimensional (i.e., of extremely mediocre quality considering the PLETHORA of amazing bakeries that are generously peppered throughout San Francisco).  The olive oil was fine...nothing to write home about.\n\nThe waiter was pleasant and brought us menus.  I surveyed the options and found many favorites from my NY restaurant days listed, which was exciting.  No chicken or veal parmigiana which was disappointing and surprising but I was willing to go with something else, like the veal saltimbocca which was labeled a house favorite.  Thing was, it was served with veggies and mashed potatoes.  Now that's fine, of course, and totally normal; but when I asked if they could replace the potatoes with pasta, I received an absolute no.  Wow, I thought to myself....I've never experienced that in New York.  As a cook myself and a member of the food service industry, I understand and APPRECIATE when restaurants truly stick to their culinary choices.  But I've had saltimbocca with pasta on many occasions, and trust me, its not that unusual.  But ok, no big deal, I just figured I'd find something else on the menu that looked good.\n\nSince I was in the mood for pasta I ordered the one meat dish that was served with pasta:  the \"Santi\" which is (from their website) \"Saut\u00e9ed chicken breast, topped with white mushrooms, pancetta, shallots, and a creamy, sun-dried tomato, vodka sauce, served with penne pasta.\"  It sounded tasty and different and I figured hey, why not.  My dining partner ordered the \"Pavarotti\" which was \"Fusilli pasta with saut\u00e9ed chicken, prosciutto, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes and a cream sauce.\"\n\nOur food arrived in a short amount of time, less than 15 minutes, and our water glasses were always filled.  When our food arrived, both plates were sprinkled generously with curly italian parsley...which was just plain confusing.  Freshly grated cheese was placed on both dishes, a nice touch.  The issue came when we both tried our food.  Mine was rich, but needed salt and pepper, and was wildly overloaded with sun-dried tomatoes, pancetta and shallots.  it felt as though I was fighting those things in order to get to the pasta and chicken.  The chicken itself was cooked well and the pasta ok, but the sauce was mostly bland.  PLUS...it was supposed to be a vodka sauce but it was WHITE!  Vodka sauce is a mixture of tomato sauce and cream and vodka...its not a white sauce.  What's going on, Contandina?  \n\nMy friend's food, to be blunt, tasted like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  I thought she was joking at first, or maybe being a bit of an exaggerator, but when I tasted it I realized she was totally right.  Mac and Cheese.  Unreal.\n\nWe were both, needless to say, disappointed in our meals.  When we were finished we totally passed on dessert and got out of there as soon as possible.  The $10 fee for parking just added insult to injury.  I paid over $30 for an INCREDIBLY mediocre meal that I could have made asleep, blindfolded, and - likely - over a campfire.  \n\nDo yourself a favor; if you want really good Italian food, please don't go to this place.  You'll be disappointed.", "author": "Salaams M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-21", "description": "Not too much to add that hasn't been covered already in other reviews, but there is one thing which bears sharing.\n\nSo when our pasta arrived, the waiter made the customary offer of freshly grated parmigiano cheese, bearing a box grater and an impressive hunk of parmigiano roughly the size and shape of your average brick which he was grasping at one end. He then proceeded to grate with some vigor over my pasta, but within just one or two seconds, the grating ruptured a heretofore unknown hairline fracture in the cheese and sent an entire half of the hunk hurtling towards my face. It hit right above my lip, and let me tell you from personal experience, parmigiano is designated a hard cheese with good reason. So I'm sitting in shock with a hunk of cheese in my lap, little cheese gratings everywhere, and a vague sense that I had just gotten punched in the face.\n\nThe waiter seemed quite embarrassed about it, understandably. It did make for a less enjoyable meal, but it's not like I think it's something to blame on anything but a freak accident. They did comp dessert.\n\nSo the lesson to be learned here is less about Contadina (see other reviews about that), and more about the dangers of hard cheeses. Make sure you have a firm grasp on a reasonably sized block, and grate at an angle which precludes the generation of leverage sufficient to launch chunks of cheese at high velocity.\n\nGood pasta though.", "author": "Kevin L."}

We were getting a good buzz going and I realized that there was no way we would be able to make it all the out to the Richmond to eat at Shabu House. \n\nWe needed somewhere closer and my BF wanted somewhere we hadn't been before, and that's when he said, \"what about that place you've been talking about going to forever?\" So we spent another few minutes debating what streets it was at and then looking for the name on Google. \n\nLong story short, we figured it out, walked over (one block over and two blocks down) and got seated at a nice table by the door (great for the breeze since it was so hot last night). We started with cocktails and the eggplant, mozzarella, and basil appetizer. It was fantastic.\n\nThe waiter recommended a special pasta that had porcini mushrooms, a wine sauce and a few other things. The pasta was al dente and pretty good overall. At this point we had ordered another round of cocktails and were talking more then eating, but we enjoyed sharing the pasta (which was definitely big enough to share).\n\nOverall, this place is cute and feels like a neighborhood restaurant.

The star of the meal was actually the appetizer - we split the Pepperoni Arrostiti, which apparently they're known for - it was excellent!  It's basically a yellow bell pepper, roasted, layered with cheese, and simmered in a spicy tomato cream sauce.  It was so good we ordered extra bread just to dip in the sauce!  The waitress, on seeing how much we liked it, was kind enough to explain its origin - and even let us look at the recipe book so we could jot down how it was made!\n\nOur entrees were a mixed bag - one good, the other disappointing.

My dad's came with red sauce and was served with garlic mashed potatoes. Kind of odd. As he said, \"it was begging for pasta.\"  \n\nI won't be back here on purpose, but not will I run screaming if someone offers to take me.

Overall, I felt it was an average Italian restaurant.\n\nThe portions were generous - the Insalata Caprese was yummy and fresh, but the Frutti di Mare alla Fiore was only ok...huge portion, but the pasta was overcooked (tasted like leftover pasta) and the clams were overdone.  My husband ordered the Ravioli alla Salvatore so I sampled some of the ravioli - his dish was done better than mine...the ravioli tasted fresh and it was a generous size (it wasn't one of those ravioli dishes that had 3 or 4 raviolis...it was a bunch of smaller, but well-stuffed raviolis...too many to count!)\n\nService was a tad slow, too - we were going to order a dessert, but after waiting 25 mins, we decided to just ask for the bill instead.\n\nDespite my disappointing experience, I'm willing to try this restaurant again...the place was packed and seems to be pretty popular, so I'll give it another shot when I'm in North Beach.", "author": "T G."}

I eat there every time I'm in the city (like ~6 times a year), and I've never had a bad meal yet. \n\nIt's more of a locals joint, and even though it's right on the streetcar line, I rarely see a lot of tourists eating there.

We didn't have reservations but got a table within 20 minutes flat, since it was just 2 of us we were able to sit at the bar and have drink while waiting. It was late and I was starving! I had the Pavarotti, delicious fusilli pasta with saut\u00e9ed chicken, prosciutto, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes and a cream sauce....per the waitress suggestion.

This little place is what I would fondly call a little hole in the wall (term of endearment in the south) ... One of those small places you love and hope the crowds don't find out about.....unfortunately I think they already have!!  The gnocchi with pink cream sauce......is a must!!!!  I love that they offer different portion sizes of their dishes. Service is always wonderful.

It's a small cozy little place that can get really crowded so be sure to make reservations. Tables are set closely to each other so don't expect much privacy. The food is excellent though! I always get the bruschetta to start off. It only comes out with two pieces of bread so be sure to have more than one order if you have more people. Bruschetta is a pretty simple dish, but the perfectly toasted slice of bread that it comes with had just enough EVOO and the tomatoes were seasoned very well. 2 slices of Bruschetta = $7.00. Expensive, but worth it. The fresh clams and muscles steamed in white wine sauce is also another one of my favorites. The server once suggested that we get the Pepperoni Arrostiti, which was a plate of bell peppers stopped with lots of cheese. I didn't like it at all. Their entrees come in half and full size orders, which I love. I really enjoyed the Fusilli pasta with saut\u00e9ed chicken, prosciutto, zucchini, and sun-dried tomatoes. I've been here a few times and always left feeling full and satisfied. What I love best about this place is the coziness of the restaurant: dim lighting, candlelit tables, and the interior set up of the restaurant made it seem like I was eating in my own dining room.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-12-01", "description": "Given my exceptional skill in meatball-making, I am often tempted to try meatballs where ever I go to see just how much better my cooking is. Having been burned too many times, I've limited myself only to higher-end restaurants where there's a lower risk of the balls being god-awful. I am so sad to report that this place had god-awful meatballs and god-awful marinara and spaghetti to accompany. \n\nWhat gives? I thought this would be a slam dunk based on Yelp reviews. Boyfriend's family in town, nice cozy restaurant watching the cable cars pass just out the window after a long day of walking and sight-seeing. \n\nI played it off when the waiter didn't understand what was meant by \"fettuccine alfredo\" when my boyfriend's cheese-loving brother asked. It's cool, it's cool. My turn. I ask if they could make the polenta and mushroom appetizer without the shrimp (allergy). He goes to the back to ask and says yes, but since the sauce is premade, I'll have to have a different sauce. I ask to let the chef recommend something (another mushroom sauce that's in other dishes on the menu) which results in this man's blank page stare becoming even blanker. \n\nThey brought out unbaked polenta (with no sign of a mushroom) swimming in Ragu. Horrifyingly disgusting. I asked what happened to the mushrooms. He explained that they were in the pre-made sauce and so they swapped it with marinara. You can imagine the lovely thoughts I'm having about which small-brained animals must work in the back. The bruschetta was a knock-out, so I remained optimistic that my secret meatball challenge at the main course could still be a success. \n\nThe garlic and three-cheese pasta my boyfriend had tasted like Easy Mac and the excessive amoung of oil had pooled. The mushroom gnocchi his mom got was exceptional. The fettuccine alfredo is better at Olive Garden. My meatballs were personally offensive. My boyfriend's family owns and runs a restaurant and bar that serves meatballs. I first tasted naked meat ball sans sauce. I shook my head, certain I could have gotten a better meat concoction from a can. After the face I made at the rancidity of the marinara in the next bite, everyone insisted on trying it -- could it be *that* bad? Not only was it bad, but my bf, his mom and brother,  chefs and long-time patrons at their own family restaurant all agreed that they were restaurant supply meatballs that all bar-food places buy frozen. \"They're unmistakable,\" were her words. This would be cool if I were at a bar, drunk, paying bar-food prices, expecting in my intoxicated state that the frozen meatballs would be delicious. Not cool, Trattoria Contadina. \n\nThe tiramisu looked as though it was thrown frisbee-style onto the plate. It tasted better than Sara Lee, but it was nearly splattered. Nice. \n\nGreat. Thanks. At least I know the unmistakable taste of frozen Restaurant Supply brand meatballs now. Suck.", "author": "Remy O."}

My friend Susan addressed the hostess by her first name and within minutes we were led to a table upstairs. Our table was dangerously situated on a slant, but we decided a nice bottle wine would fix that situation, at least mentally we would think we were sitting on flat ground. From the outside, I always thought Contadina was really fancy, but sitting down amongst our fellow diners, I realized that it was really just homey with old Italian charm (you know, black and white photos of random famous people who've dinner there over the years). We were surrounded by tables of happy, boisterous families, which set the mood for a relaxed, unpretentious evening. I ordered a chicken and cheese ravioli in a creme sauce with sun dried tomatoes. When our food arrived, my plate lacked any hint of warmth. I looked across the table at my friend Danielle's plate of pesto, which was billowing steam off the top. I took one bite of a ravioli and decided to flag down the waiter. I really hate doing this, especially when the waitstaff is so sweet, which they were, but I didn't exactly want to eat a cold meal. He was great about it. He whisked my dish away and apologized, \"I'm sorry, we don't have heat lamps here,\" which usually means the food is really fresh and ready to go the minute it hits the plate. But unfortunately mine had been sitting for a while waiting for it's good friend pesto pasta to be done. He reappeared with my plate within minutes. The food was tasty and hot, and was accompanied by a lovely bottle of Barbaresco. It really wasn't my favorite meal ever, but I know this place could do better. I'm determine to come back and order a real winner. Suzy had a delicious meal of twisty pasta with scallops in this creamy sauce. She has been telling me about this restaurant for two years and she finally took me and felt kind of bad that my meal wasn't all she hoped it would be. So for her, I will go back and will learn to love it!\n\n****Update*****\n\nI went back last night and was treated to a steaming bowl of pesto linguine! It was absolutely delicious. This is a solid dining experience. The only problem is trying to flag down the servers to get the bill (oh, and the crying baby next to us. I'm working on liking the babies more, but when they're screaming next to your bowl of pasta it's hard to considerer them cute).", "author": "Sammy S."}

Some other reviewes I read on here were not very good but I thought this place was great. The food was very tasty and the service was beyond excellent. We were immediatley seated and served our drinks. We placed our dinner orders, I asked for soup of the day and coffee to come before my meal. We could not believe how quickly our waiter returned with the soup and coffee. I mean literally 1 minute after walking away from our table the waiter returned with hot soup and coffee. Our drinks and bread  were constantly repelensihed and out waiter checked in frequently to see if we needed anything. The prices were reasonable adn portions were large enough as pasta is very filling. 3 of us shared 2 entrees and it was more than enough food.  Other reviews also mentioned parking but we had no problem. There was a parking gargae within 1 block of the restaurant. I woudl give this restaurant a 4-5 star rating.", "author": "kim h."}

You also get the added benefit of not being jostled constantly by the other patrons as they inch by you trying to get to the one tiny bathroom shared by both sexes.  We shared a platter of the ethereal gnocchi in a tomato cream sauce and then went on to some wonderful salads.  I had a HUGE arugula and radicchio salad with pecans and Gorgonzola. Although it's pretty much a staple on the menu of many Italian restaurants, this one was much better than I've had recently.   Onto the entrees, which for me was a giant hunk'o halibut cooked with a tomato ragout with tasty grilled potatoes and an assortment of fresh veggies.  We told the cute and attentive waitress (who was rockin' the Gwen Stefani look) that we couldn't eat another bite - so she brought us dessert in a glass - some sort of Italian wine liquor mixed with hot chocolate and foam.

But there is good public transit all around including the Mason Street Cable car which passes the restaurant and would make a nice ride/destination for tourists. Also, buses on Columbus avenue serve well.\n  The service was excellent, so no complaints about that.\nThe menu presents with typical Italian protocol, antipasti, primi piatti and secondi piatti.  we chose prosciuto and carpacchio di manzo, both fresh and excellent.  Lots of capers on my carpacchio.  Two of us ordered the rissoto special with prawns. The prawns were nicely cooked and there were 6 of them circumferentially on the rissoto. The rissoto was OK, but I found I had to add salt.  One of us had the scallops which were fresh and tender and I'd recommend this dish over the rissoto.

Yesterday my wife and I took my parents out for dinner. it was my Dad's 67th birthday so I wanted to take him somewhere nice.  Having read the reviews and dined here one time about a year ago I thought this would be perfect. Well... it was a disaster. First we were ushered into a tiny, hot upstairs room full of screaming children. I asked the less-than-enthusiastic host to be reseated, perhaps by the window where there was a large table for four. After a few minutes we were led to another table downstairs, close to the kitchen. No window, but OK. We ordered the food and a bottle of wine. Half way through the meal I noticed something swimming in my spinach. It was a bug. Yes, a bug. Legs, striped back, whatever.. a bug. Not a small bug, but the kind that looked like a cock roach. I'm not an entomologist, but yeah... it looked like a roach. I alerted the waiter, he took the plate away, came  back a few minutes later and gave me a \"sorry man, it happens\". That's craptacular. We immediately asked for our check and handed him two Amex cards to pay the bill. He comes  back a few minutes later and says \"we were told not to take American Express\". So I say to him: \"So... do you accept American Express\"? He says: \"Yes\". So I say: \"But you were TOLD not to\"?  He says: \"Yes\". OK.. we're outta here. We gave him 2 alternate cards, zero tip and walked the hell out of there. So let me wrap it up: the food here is not that good. It would be somewhat impressive if you were in Fargo, North Dakota, but this is San Francisco, it was lame. The service was crap. The seating and ambiance is even worse crap.

However, review the label prior to corking because similar to Le Petit Laurent, the year may be off by a year.

The tomatoes had been chopped into conveniently-sized bits that did not make for slobber potential.\n\nThe main courses are very reasonably priced at $12-18 per plate.  This excludes meat dishes since we had only ordered pasta dishes, thus I cannot comment on anything else.\n\nThe Pavarotti played a soothing counter-balance of smooth mildness to the spicy and bold Carlesimo.  Both were well seasoned and the flavors in each dish complimented each other well.\n\nEach dessert is $7 (again, how can a 2-piece bruschetta cost $7 when you get a whole dessert for the exact same cost).  \n\nIf you've had dinner already and are looking for a super quaint off-the path of the hussle and bussle of Columbus, then come here for a dessert and an after dinner drink to cap off the night.", "author": "Kristina M."}

We were greeted warmly by the host (the son of the owner I believe...the third generation, a true family business). The place was busy but our table was ready right on time. I had gotten there a few minutes early and had a glass of wine at the bar. I wish the 'by the glass' selection was a bit more robust but the wine list in general was good and the prices somewhat reasonable. We started off with some appetizers, mostly antipasto. Very good but we were surprised that they didn't offer calamari. Excellent lentil soup which we ordered on the recommendation of our excellent server, Nancy. As a group, we were a bit loud and, fueled by a day that was not without beer, extra charming. I really love it when I go out with a group of people and we're having a good time and the server does not attempt to either be a giant buzzkill to register disapproval or, worse, be 'one of the gang.' Nancy was perfect. Excellent chicken parmigiana. It wasn't on the menu, only veal was but they did a great job with it. Wonderful sauce, just the right amount of cheese and the side veggies were flavorful. We were seated at 6:30 and didn't get up until 9 but never felt rushed. It was a reunion of sorts for a group of us who hadn't been together for more than 10 years. We had a fantastic evening. TC was the perfect place. Great vibe, great food and great service.", "author": "Brian B."}

I absolutely LOVE Italian food, and this did not disappoint! The atmosphere is cozy and quaint, a neighborhood intimate feel. The restaurant was crowded on Saturday night, but we were promptly greeted by the owner who found us a seat in the house in no time. For starters the Pepporoni Arrostiti was amazing! The creaminess of the different melted cheeses complemented the spicy tomato cream sauce to really bring out the sweet bell pepper flavor. The bruschetta tasted fantastic with the ripest tomatoes! We also tried the meatballs- which I am a HUGE critic of meatballs, and these were top notch full of flavor. So good I even ordered a side of meatballs to go with my pasta dish! For salad I ordered the caprese salad, mozzerela cheese was so fresh- beautiful presentation. For entree the Gnocchi was fabulous. Perfect pillows of pasta, fluffy and oh-so-yummy! Great flavor with the rich tomato cream sauce. The only downfall of the night was I ate too much (as you can tell by all of the food we had!) that I couldn't bear to finish the night off with dessert...but it sure did look good! Overall, great service, amazing food, lovely atmosphere, timely service, very polite owners. Perfect place for catching up with friends, spending a lovely meal with family, or date night. I will eat here every time I am in San Francisco!", "author": "Jennifer T."}

For our mains, I ordered veal scallopini with prosciutto, mushrooms and marsala with pasta and broccolini; my girlfriend ordered beef ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce (great size portion and tasty); and her sister got the \"house\" specialty: pasta Carlesimo. This last one was probably the best pasta I have ever tasted... very flavourful with a spicy finish, but not too much at all. Super tasty.

It was in a gelatinous sweet malty sauce; probably the worst rendition of the famous Italian dish I've ever had. Also the meat was pretty mediocre grade. I was almost taken aback when I complained about the taste of the dish and the waiter said that I shouldn't worry that they wouldn't charge me. I'm not going to force feed myself a $35 dish which tastes terrible and I'm more offended that they were going to charge me. I'm not going back.

The food was excellent and the staff was as well.  we have two small boys and despite this being a smaller neighborhood place, they were totally accommodating.  We each had pastas.  A cheese ravioli in a cream tomato sauce and a penne pasta with sun dried tomatos, mushrooms, and creamy tomato sauce.  Both were excellent.  We had the Arugala salad with balsamic dressing and figs.  This was a little disappointing.  The salty of the balsamic way overpowered the sweet of the figs.  I think they're striving for more balance because they seem quite dedicated to quality and customer service so if you're reading this Trattoria Contadina, try to adjust the salad a little. It has great potential but the balance our evening was a bit off.  They have a solid beer list with the usual suspects and some interesting craft beers.  The house sangiovese we had was solid.  No great.  But solid.  Bottom line, this was a wonderful evening.  Very good food and Excellent staff.  We would go there again when back in town.", "author": "dave c."}

I was here a couple of years ago and it was ok. Fun, good service but nothing special.  Now it is a step down from that.  The prices are pretty high and the food is rather pedestrian. Decent sized portions but no finesse to any of the dishes. We ate at 6:30p and ordered the risotto special.  Possibly the worst risotto I've had in a restaurant. More like a fried rice or a paella.  I was shocked that they could pass this off as risotto. Someone cooking in the kitchen has NO idea what a true risotto should be like (I'm not sure they even used arborio rice).  The tomato cream sauce was tasty but caters to midwestern and teenage tastes (I was with two adolescent boys and they liked it just fine). The red snapper was pan fried in a heavy sauce. Very old school.  Not bad, but not great either.  They also don't have a fryer, so no deep fried calamari.  Wine list had big markups.  In sum, the pastas are decent as long as you stick to the butter/wine/garlic sauce or you like rich cream sauces.  The rest of the main courses are hit or miss.", "author": "Priscilla C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-08-01", "description": "Disappointed!  I searched on Yelp for a nice pasta dinner in North Beach the night before the San Francisco marathon.  Overall the reviews seemed good and I liked the menu so I made a reservation for 2 at 6:00pm on a Saturday.  We arrived on time and the restaurant was about 2/3 full.  It is a small place, but they made the most out of the space.  The staff was friendly and we were seated immediately.  Water (which is important for a marathoner!) was brought quickly and our server explained the specials.  We went with a salad on the menu that had figs which sounded good. My dining companion doesn't like peppers and eliminating this from a chicken pasta dish while substituting a red sauce was easily accepted.  I ordered the seafood pasta.  So far so good.  Bread was brought along with oil & vinegar.  I was happy that the oil & vinegar was separate however the bread was really boring white bread served at room temperature.  If you've ever had the CPK bread it was only 1/2 step better.  Fortunately the salad was delicious!  We waited a bit for our entrees, but not terribly long.  However when they finally arrived they were warm, not hot.  The temperature of my pasta was a little hotter when I started mixing it up, although quite a bit of the seafood was lukewarm.  My partner's chicken pasta was not hot at all.  I have no idea why our food wasn't hot as the place wasn't packed and the servers seemed to be on it.  What was even more disappointing than the temperature was the flavor.  There wasn't a lot of seasonings in either of our dishes.  We were both truly disappointed!  In my opinion it is pretty hard to have boring marinara sauce, if you can't do anything else at least add some garlic, but honestly this was some of the worst I have had at an Italian restaurant.  My dining partner joked that we would have better off going to CPK. There were quite a few old pictures of celebrities on the wall which leads me to believe that this restaurant might have been better in another era. The entrees were around $17, not cheap - not expensive, but NOT worth it!  Fortunately the meal didn't affect my marathon time but we will definitely not be back.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

The ambiance was pleasing upon our arrival and our table was not ready for our 9 PM reservation so we went to the bar for pleasant cocktails made by a great bartender. Then we were showed to our table and asked to order. We ordered the antipasti and the best thing on the plate were the olives. They were out of the wine we ordered - the wine list was limited and overpriced. We were then asked to order. We have now been at our table for about 10 or so minutes. When we said we were not ready and were looking to take our time our waiter informed us that the kitchen was closing. This should have been our sign not to order and find another restaurant to dine at but we went ahead and ordered 3 entrees. Our antipasti arrived and we were about half through when a bus boy came to take our plates. We said we were not ready. He walked downstairs, came back and placed three dishes on a side table. He then came back over and said, \"I'm taking your plates now\". He did and served our entrees. The veal was rubbery, the pasta was overcooked and the risotto special was miserable. The pork was tough, all the vegetables in the risotto were undercooked but the risotto itself was like glue. We had a good laugh over this meal, but today I went to check my credit card statement and Trattoria Contadina generously charged my card twice for such an exquisite dining experience. Diners beware. Stay Away. p.s. I would give this place zero stars but the 1 star was for the bartender and the finely crafted pre-dinner cocktail.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

None of us had been to NB in quite a while, and the touristy aspect of it underwhelmed.  But going first to Cafe Trieste was just as I remembered it from maybe 15 years ago.  And Paul Kantner, of Jefferson Airplane/Starship, was sitting solo in a chair on the street the corner, reading a newspaper and smoking a cigarette, just waiting to be recognized.  But I digress.  Our reservations were for 6:00.  The downstairs was already full, but we were shown to the much cozier upstairs room, with a corner table.  The service was very competent, the bus person (woman) was especially noteworthy for her friendliness and attentiveness (water, etc.)  The food, however, fell short, if you are used to a more updated style of Italian food.  This was old school, indeed, as other posters have mentioned.  We had the prosciutto with melon, which was o.k., but nothing special (is this ever anything special at this point?  Maybe back in 1985 ...)  Also, the mellanzana.  Which was tasty, but that's about all I could say.  I had the polpettine, as I'm a sucker for meatballs, but while they did have some dimension to them, they just sort of sat on the linguini.  Or was it spaghetti?  The \"fresh tomato sauce\" was amazingly underwhelming, didn't come together with the meatballs, although I have to say it benefitted from sitting around until the next day, when I had the leftovers at lunch.  So maybe they should make these on Monday for Tuesday, etc.  My friends had the valdostanna, and while they didn't rave about it, they pronounced it good on a standby Italian old-school level.  The caramel gelato dessert was also a disappointment, though it sounded wonderful.  We all agreed that Contadina gets good marks for atmospherics (a block above Columbus) and that the food was ok, maybe even good, but old-school Italian.  And the prices!  Tab for sharing two appetizers, and then one pasta, a glass of wine and sharing a dessert was $49 (including tip).", "author": "Leslie P."}

Here its called the Linguini Vongole.  I'm not Italian and I didn't care to babblefish that so pardon my lack of knowledge.  Anyhow, we started off noshing on the bread in their super rich and almost butter like olive oil. \"You know its fresh when it tastes like buttah\" and old Italian friend's father once said.  It was all I could do not to fill up on that alone.  Next we split a great Caesar which came just the way I like it, a bit heavy on the dressing.  Romaine is pretty boring beyond the crisp sweetness so I like every piece with at least a little bit of that Caesar zing and some parm on there.  Perfect in my book.  Next was my aforementioned Linguini Vongole.  I got to pick each clam outta the shell and put it in my perfectly al dente pasta.  The sauce wasn't too wine-y or too oil-y or too garlic-y.

I've tried a few other places around North Beach for pasta, but I think this place is my new favorite! I loved all the dishes I tried! Really great pasta and appetizers. I had the clam linguine, and bits of the ravioli and another pasta I can't remember the name of, and all of them tasted great! For an appetizer I tried the eggplant dish which was really good too. It only had 3 pieces though, but there were only 3 of us so it worked out =) I will most definitely be coming back here! I think reservations are necessary though because I hear this places fills up. It's pretty small so I wouldn't doubt it. (We had reservations, so we were seated immediately). But I recommend this place as one of the \"must try\"s of North Beach. Located along the cable car (Powell & Mason I think) and bus routes (45 and 41?), so it's convenient to get to if you aren't within walking distance.", "author": "Nhi T."}

Only had pasta even though the secondi piatti looked very good as well. Bread was only average, but shared a great mushroom polenta. Prices are reasonable given the quality of the food. Pasta was cooked nicely al dente, but I wasn't wowed enough to give 5 stars, partly because of the sauce which I thought was nothing special. Service is pretty fast. Lastly, might not be the best place for a romantic dinner, despite the atmosphere, because tables are really close together - we spent a long time talking to the people at the table next to us - they were visiting from Boston - by CAR. 6-week trip. I went home and back to work the next morning. And cried a little.", "author": "Alexander G."}

I always forget to take that dang day off work, next year for sure.  I went meet a couple friends for a drink before heading to Trattoria Contadina and SURPRISE a former roommate had flown in to celebrate my birthday.  Things were looking up.  Did I mention that it was one of those really odd SF days  - 80 degrees and sunny?  I should have been amp'ed right?  What got me amp'ed was meeting up with a bunch of my friends and enjoying a really wonderous meal.  Everything was great - wine, apps, main and dessert.  I had a pasta with mushrooms, garlic, peas and sausage in a tomato cream sauce. Woah - sounds simple, it is and it was fantastic.  I need to get back there.  The service was really wonderful, they were kind and very accommodating to our large party.  The space is pretty small so if you have a crowd, all ahead.", "author": "cristina t."}

Good Italian is all about the simple produce that taste amazing on their own.. if you soak everything win sauce, if you overcook the pasta, if the antipasto only has canned pickles, canned artichoke and some yellow bell pepper and cold cuts, if your top your daily meat suggestion with a ton of unknown sauce.... that means you are not proud of your produce, you are hiding something. ..\nAgain, maybe the head chef was out for the day, maybe they had some leftovers, maybe...\nI will probably go back in a while and give it another try.

Don't get me wrong, the food and service was really good.  Perhaps their wine list should be better matched to the food and ambiance.  Simple Italian food, paper on the table, pictures drilled to the wall, brick laminated floors etc. etc.  Again don't get me wrong, comfy relaxed atmosphere, just a bit of sticker shock.  There are better meals to be had at that price.", "author": "damien p."}

I love Italian food and this place was such a good pick! It is a little on the tiny side, especially if you're seated uspstairs (note to the ladies wearing heels: be very careful going up those stairs, they are steep!) We had a group of 8, so I made a reservation a week before. When we got there, we were immediately seated and waited upon. The bread was really good and tasted fresh. The champagne was yummy. I ordered the Chicken Ravioli (substituted the cream sauce for marinara)...Oh my gosh! It was so good! That is possibly my favorite dish I have ever had! No joke, it was amazing! All the other people I went with loved their food too (One had the Capellini, one had the Halibut..don't remember the rest). We got the Tiramisu for dessert and I am seriously saying this...by far the best Tiramisu I have ever had! And I've had quite a few. It was perfect! I really wish I could have licked both my dinner plate, and the dessert plate. After dinner, the host helped us catch cabs, which was so nice of him since it was freezing and us ladies weren't wearing weather-appropriate clothing. The only negative thing...the bathroom. It is the tiniest bathroom and it is very dirty. But, the food and service definitely makes up for it! I think I will have to eat here every time I go to SF.", "author": "Nikki L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-05-13", "description": "I was somewhat disappointed with this place after reading pretty good reviews.  The place is small and cramped and there were at least 3 flies roaming the restaurant the entire time we ate there.  Hard to enjoy your meal when you are constantly swatting at pesty little bugs.   The hostess was lovely and seated us right away (despite being early) but our waiter was sub-par.  Drinks came out after the salads.  As for the salad, I ordered the \"buffalo\" mozzarella which was not all that special.  Thick slices of cheese that barely counted as fresh mozz.  I prefer my caprese to have creamy delicious cheese instead of something sliced right off the log.  Also, the bread they serve is nothing to write home about.  At least they provide olive oil because the bread would be too dry to eat alone.  We all ordered pastas for our main course.  I had the egg fettucini with fennel sausage and peppers which was good but not spectacular.  The pasta was clearly homemade which I love and the serving size was absolutely massive (I would guess three people could have shared this dish).  Overall, I would say mediocre food and ambiance but the price point is decent (particularly in the typically over-priced North Beach neighborhood).", "author": "Karen L."}
