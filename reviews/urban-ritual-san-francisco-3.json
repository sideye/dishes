The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e drink had a really rich and sweet flavor, but I'd definitely recommend getting the creme on the side because it's super sweet.

I actually really enjoyed the strawberry milk bar drink - it wasn't overly sweet and the boba perfect! The hojicha hot chocolate was not my favorite.

It's a spot that's out of the way for me, and I definitely wouldn't make my way out to Hayes just to get a boba. Also, I find their drinks really pricy for what they are.

I substituted the milk for pea milk, which could be the reason why the drink was thicker than expected. I chose pea milk because I've never tried it and it was the closest thing to \"soy/almond milk\" that they had to offer. \n\nboyfriend got the matcha toffee. they add in toffee bits to the top. he also substituted for the pea milk and said it made the drink thicker. \n\nOverall, we like the place.

So I decided to try it out since I was in the area.  \n\nI got the creme brulee drink.  It's a milk based drink with pieces creme brulee and boba mixed in.  There was also toasted sugar pieces sprinkled on top.  The boba was nice and warm!  After mixing everything together the drink tasted just like creme brulee, just with boba.  The sugar crystals added a nice crunch to the drink!  The con to this drink is that you can't change the sugar level.  I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't overly sweet. It was just at the cusp of being too sweet.  All the milk really help keep it from being too sweet.  If you aren't into sweetness then maybe this drink isn't for you, but I didn't think it was crazy week or under sweet. \n\nWould I get this drink again?  Only if I'm feeling like I want a dessert.  The other thing I didnt like about this drink was that it isn't a milk TEA drink.  It's just a milk drink.

I really like the layout of the shop. Felt very homey. I came here with my cousin and she got the Matcha toffee with regular milk and it pretty good but they probably could have eased up on the milk a little bit. I couldn't taste the matcha as much but it was still good. I got the creme brulee and I love how they have the option to substitute the milk with something else. The options were pea milk, oat milk or macadamia nut milk (all 50 cents extra). I got the macadamia nut because it gives it a little bit of a nuttier taste. I thought it was pretty darn good. It is pretty much creme brulee in a liquid form. It also comes with honey boba and it's one of the few places that actually makes it decent. Great texture but given the sweetness of my drink I can't tell if there was any honey on it. Overall it's a good place to get boba but it is a bit pricy. With the the macadamia nut milk my drink came out to be $5.75. I think most of the other drinks are $4.25, which is standard I guess.

Their drinks are definitely on the pricier side for the regular size. It came with a little container of toffee bits taped on the cup, so they let you sprinkle on the topping. Innovative idea that definitely draws in the Instagram crowd. Drink itself was a little sweet and overpowered by all the toppings. Each sip you get a bit of crunch from the toffee, egg pudding, and boba. Boba had a smooth texture to it, but it leaned towards the chewier side. \n\nThe shop is spacious, but there is still limited seating areas.

There were only a few drinks ahead of me.  I didn't notice that there were samples at the register, it was pushed more towards the side, so maybe something the cashiers could promote better.  I didn't discover this til I saw a few customers awhile after me sample and they were the drinks I ordered.  I ordered the Bae-Sil for myself and the strawberry milk bar for my husband.  I asked for a tray since I'd be carrying it back to him.  With boba my grand total $10.50.  The Bae-Sil is a strawberry lemonade with housemade strawberry syrup and lemonade topped with basil leaves.  The Strawberry Milk Bar is milk with strawberry syrup.  \n\nFor the prices they really should include loose leaf tea in all the drinks.  Why am I paying $5 for strawberry milk?!  After about 5-7 minutes my drinks were ready.  I'm not sure if they thought it would make it easier or if they were being cheap.  But when she handed me a tray she broke it in half because I only got two drinks.  Can someone tell me if this was supposed to make it easier for me to carry or was she just trying to repurpose the other half?  Both drinks had just the right amount of sweetness.  The Bae-Sil was nice and refreshing.  Perfect for a warm summer day.  The boba was just way too soft.  The Strawberry Milk has a nice not overly sweet strawberry milk flavor, but was a bit too faint.  It doesn't need to be in ur face sweetened with artificial flavors like Nesquik strawberry milk but for $5 give me more flavor and more things in my cup! \n\nFor the price, and better flavors I'd stick with Boba Guys.  Urban Ritual is in a better Hayes location though and does take Five Stars.  I like how they have different offerings you won't find elsewhere, and offer alternatives for those not wanting tea.  But I think for the price again like for the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and strawberry milk bar, include tea in it and offer it slightly cheaper for those who don't want tea in it.  IMO Urban Ritual is just a bit overhyped.  It's SF, there's better places.  2.5 stars.", "author": "Cat C."}

Probably from having too much boba before along with many other sources of calories. I heard this was the hot place to go for boba when I was sauntering through Hayes Valley on a recent evening. I was surprised and pleasantly relieved that there wasn't a line of Asian youth out the door, or as I like to call them...euthanasia. Otherwise I was worried that I had to dye my hair with motor oil to fit in. I have to admit I like the Chipotle approach of ordering here even if it challenges my small brain to track to the four steps I needed to follow.\n\nProbably too self-conscious to wing it in front of the young server, I stood toward the side and studied the choices like an eye exam at the DMV. I liked the fact that no matter what I ordered, it was going to be $4.25. I decided on a Hibiscus Herbal Tea with Oat Milk and No Sweet. Oops, the oat milk cost me an extra fifty cents, and oh, adding the Honey Boba cost me another dollar (photo: http://bit.ly/2v61i2P). Damn. It's like Trump's destruction of Obamacare where he wants to nickel and dime me to an early grave.

Helpful and they let you sample cool flavors like their house milk tea ($4.25) and Whitegrape Yuzu ($4.75).\n\nTea: 4 stars. The honey boba was cooked to PERFECTION. It was chewy and sweet but not too sweet and with each chew I just kept thinking about the bursting of flavor even though it wasn't popping boba. I tried the Matcha Toffee which came out to $5.25 with boba and tax. Less sweet was sweet enough, especially with the toffee flavor which juxtaposed the creamy matcha by providing a pleasantly surprising chewy aspect.\n\nThere is little seating and there are NO bathrooms. My friend and I ran a block away to Biergarten and used the bathrooms there.

Strawberry Milk Bar?!\n\nThere is a new boba spot in Hayes Valley serving innovative speciality drinks and it is a must try!\n\nUrban Ritual is located on the outskirts of Hayes Valley. The shop is small, but still spacious for a boba establishment in the city. Staff was friendly and atmosphere was welcoming.\n\nSince this was my first time at Urban Ritual, I had to try several of their drinks. For starters, I had their Matcha Toffee (matcha green tea layered with classic milk and bite-sized housemade toffee brittle). I was blown away by the deep matcha flavoring. Also, I never imagined toffee would work so well with matcha!\n\nNext, I had their Strawberry Milk Bar (classic milk with housemade strawberry syrup). I was looking the most forward to this drink and I was not disappointed. It was creamy and sweet, and reminded me of a strawberry milkshake. Can't be mad at that, right?\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the White Grape Yuzu (white grape oolong with yuzu honey). The flavors were subtle, not my personal favorite but it was refreshing! We also had the Cr\u00e8me Brulee (housemade cr\u00e8me brulee, honey boba, classic milk topped with crackling torched raw sugar). It was creamy and had hints of caramel. However, be warned that it is sweet. I recommend this to all my sweet tooth lovers out there.\n\nLastly, my boyfriend and I tried their House Milk Tea (house blend of black teas with house cream). Again, I was taken back by the roasted tea flavors. It was bitter and strong, but also creamy which helped balance it out.\n\nAll in all, I'm impressed by the quality of the drinks from Urban Ritual.

Most boba shops dilute their teas with too much milk or do not brew their tea properly, if at all, but I could appreciate the full taste of the teas miraculously!\n\nFrom the two tea flavors I tried that day, the tea definitely tastes freshly brewed and is definitely not from a powder, which I really do appreciate in a high quality boba shop that sells drinks for $5-6/cup.

While the rating is low, it really comes at the caveat that I didn't like my drink. I can definitely imagine other people enjoying it more than I do but my personal preference says otherwise. \n\nThat said, I ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was decent. I would say there are some minor adjustments that could be made that could really skyrocket the quality of this drink in my opinion. First there's the torched raw sugar that's supposed to mimic the top of a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. While in theory it makes a lot of sense and the sweetness levels for this drink were in a good range, the raw sugar could have been a little more flat. What I mean is the torched sugar was more like little cubes that added an odd texture to the drink. \n\nI didn't like the crunchy raw sugar that got stuck to the teeth and then getting a well made boba. It felt contradictory. Personally don't think the boba fits into the drink that well and could be excluded and added if desired. Also, if the raw sugar was more like the top of a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e where the sugar was like a thin film that was broken apart I would have enjoyed that much more. It's such a small change but it really made me wish it was the case so I can have one of my favorite desserts in liquid form. \n\nOther than those minor complaints this place is a nice little chic place. The decor is bright with ample lighting. There isn't a whole lot of seating, maybe enough for 12 or so people so come prepared but there is a small park nearby if the weather permits. Overall pleased, service was good and drinks were quick despite a line building up. \n\nTL;DR Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is decent but minor changes to the raw sugar cubes and option to add the boba would make the drink a true liquid creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e", "author": "Ryan F."}

Handful of tables for seating.  \n\nIncluding the two samples offered that day, I've tried the following (most fav to least fav): https://bit.ly/2jZF3FW\n\n*Bae-Sil: Strawberry Basil Lemonade w/ housmade strawberry syrup, basil, and lemon (sample): Incredibly refreshing and a perfect thirst quencher on a warm day. \n\n*House Milk Tea: Housemade blend of black tea w/ house cream (sample): Deliciously creamy and milky with good tea flavor and roasted notes. I love roasted oolong milk tea so this is something I will find myself ordering regularly. \n\n*Whitegrape Yuzu: Whitegrape Oolong w/ yuzu honey ($4.75 + .50 cents for lychee jelly): This was my co-worker's drink which she loved and after trying several sips, I can see why. Prominent tea flavor with great floral, sweet grape, and citrus notes.\n \n*Strawberry Milk Bar: Classic Milk w/ housemade strawberry syrup ($4.75). Growing up, I loved Nesquik's Strawberry Milk so this was nostalgic but I wished there was more strawberry flavor. \n\n*Cr\u00e8me Brulee: Housemade Cr\u00e8me Brulee w/ classic milk, crackling torched sugar, no boba, sub oat milk ($5.75): Ok, ok...I know this is one of their most popular drinks but I'm not a dessert person so not really my style. It does taste like a cr\u00e8me brulee in drink form (not too sweet as promised by the owner) and I thought the crackling sugar perfectly emulated the caramelized sugar crown in the classic dessert. If you're a fan of pudding in your milk tea, you will like this. I gave it to my boss who LOVED it. \n\nService is most excellent and the owner(s) are VERY customer oriented. Think In-N-Out and Happy Lemon but more personalized. They even bid us goodbye by name. I've been working in the same office with the same people for years and I still don't know half their names so that's impressive. \n\nAs much as I love Boba Guys in Hayes Valley, it's nice to have another great option for high-quality milk teas near work!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We ordered the caramel brulee tea boba and the earl grey hibiscus tea with boba. The earl grey hibiscus was just ok--I didn't feel like the flavor balance was there for me since there was a lot of hibiscus. The caramel brulee tea with boba was really decadent and actually tasted like the dessert itself! The milky tea was sweet and there were little cracked pieces of caramelized sugar at the bottom along with the boba. I enjoyed a few sips of this but ultimately it's really sweet so I probably wouldn't drink the whole thing.\n\nOverall, this place is cute but really known for their signature drinks! As a non-milk drinker, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't just order a passionfruit green tea with boba. I'd recommend if you're really into sweet drinks and milk teas since it's probably the best boba place in Hayes Valley.", "author": "Megan K."}

At first sip, I thought the torched sugar bits were a little weird, but they definitely grew on me and I found myself stirring the drink up to make sure I got all of them!

Kind of tastes like a strawberry milkshake/ice cream. Pretty sweet drink if you're craving for something refreshing on the fruity side. \n\nThe afternoon tea is such a bummer for me. It's a mixture of earl grey milk tea with cocoa powder to be their version of chocolate milk.

Since it's located in Hayes Valley, it's kind of a pain to get to in the city unless you uber or muni from Bart.\n\nAt first glance, the interior is clean and modern. They have a light wood aesthetic going on and a few small tables for customers to sit and enjoy their drinks.\n\nI ended up getting the pretty Toffee Matcha drink everyone was talking about. It was a surprisingly good combo. They put crushed toffee bits on the top of the drink that swirls in when you drink it. It kind of makes it taste like an Almond Roca candy bar, mellowed out a bit by the matcha. It is pretty sweet with the addition of toffee, so I would opt for a lower sugar level next time. Their boba was also perfectly chewy. \n\nThey have a couple cool features on the menu including the fact that you can pay a bit extra for oat milk in your milk tea.

My sense of humor, a light haze billowing from the black pearls!  Now that's my kind of PEA-spective in a cup.

Big props to the store manager, David for giving us exceptional service - we couldn't decide what to try, so he offered everything on the menu, even their seasonal secret menu drinks! They have 12 different drinks total including the 2 seasonal drinks, but you can put together your own as well. I will list my top favorites of the menu:\n\n- Strawberry Milk Bar: tastes like the ice cream bars and boy was it delicious, especially when you mix it with the creme brulee topping (additional $1)\n- Forever Young: sangria made with elderflower, lemon & berries - very refreshing and doesn't have the alcohol aspect of sangria. \n- Bae-Sil: Also a great refreshing fruit option if that's what you're feeling. Not too sweet and very light in the basil flavor vs the strawberry, which I liked. \n- Matcha Toffee: Matcha was a good flavor, but the toffee bits is what stole the show. I enjoy chewing on the bits along with the matcha flavored drink.\n- House Milk Tea: I feel like every boba spot should have this drink perfected and it was solid here at Urban Ritual. Not too sweet, and good mix with the boba.\n- Creme Brulee: My mom would love the bits of sugar from the torched part of creme brulee, but the drink tastes so much like creme brulee, that I would definitely order when I'm craving. This is a must-try if you're a creme brulee fan. \n\nThe two secret drinks for this season:\n\n- Hot Chocolate Hojicha: tastes all like dark chococlate hot cocoa and none of hojicha. Very heavy on the chocolate, a little too thick for me, but not too bad in chocolate flavor, just wish I tasted more of the Hojicha part.\n- Pumpkin Chai: not a fan of chai, and after tasting, the pumpkin flavor lacks  and is overpowered by thai flavor.\n\n\nWould recommend checking it out, but parking isn't the easiest.

The House Milk Tea was alright. We got it with less sweetness, so it had more of a tea taste, which I enjoyed. The Bae-sil is perfectly refreshing for a warm day. It reminded me of strawberry lemonade but minus the sourness and with a hint of basil. The boba was tasty too - probably one of my favorite places for their boba. It had a good texture. Finally, the Creme Brulee! It was probably my favorite drink of the 3. It even comes with pieces of creme brulee.

The Afternoon Tea tasted like chocolate milk. \n\nThe cashier was super patient and very knowledgable. I loved her recommendation of the Bae-sil. It definitely hit the spot for me. With boba added to it, the drink was $5.25 (16 oz). The boba was very soft and chewy and had a hint of sweetness to it. They give you good amount of boba. At the end of my drink, I probably had 6-8 boba balls left. \n\nI also took a sip of my friend's House Milk Tea. The tea flavor wasn't very strong unfortunately =/ It was just decent milk tea.

Also put in your phone number if I you want to collect points and get a free drink after 10 points I believe. I got the crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e drink since the cashier said it was their top seller along with matcha toffee. I also got the bae-sil for my boyfriend.

The matcha flavor was pronounced but not bitter. The toffee bits were crunchy, sweet, and salty treats whenever you got some in your mouth. They complimented the matcha pretty well. Regular sweetness works for the matcha toffee, especially because the toffee brittle introduces some extra sweetness.\nWe also ordered the white grape yuzu. I liked the yuzu honey. The grape oolong was not very strong, but maybe that's the nature of the tea. I might go up to 100% sweetness for this drink if I order it again.\nWe added honey boba to both drinks. Their boba is pretty soft and slightly chewy. The honey is pretty subtle. They were still warm from just being made.\nIf they have samples out, be sure to try them to get an idea of their regular sweetness level because urban ritual definitely tones down their sweetness. The sample of the basil lemonade was good - something I might come back to order.", "author": "Christine L."}

If you're a first timer, or Boba veteran your bound to enjoy drink.", "author": "Abigail S."}

The freshness of the tea and the deep flavor can be enjoyed in every sip. The quality and sweetness of the honey boba pearls are such a great compliment to the creamy black tea. You can truly tell they don't use powdered tea and it shows. Be sure to compliment David and his awesome staff as well.", "author": "Zack K."}

Almost comparable to Boba Guys in quality in the tea and milk they use. Got the Matcha Toffee and it was strong in macha flavor with the little bits of toffee. Never had anything like it and I was impressed. The drink was more on the tea side and wasn't as milky which is how I like my milk tea. Would come again to try their other flavors cause the flavors here are very unique.", "author": "Chloe J."}

I forgot what used to be here but R says he remember an ice cream or fro-yo place in it before. Either ways, yes, parking is terrible here but honestly, Hayes Valley doesn't have the best parking. I recommend you either park afar and walk over or take the bart/muni and walk a bit. The place is not very big but it's rare for boba places to be big in SF though. I usually get to-go. They have small samples of different kinds of tea in the front that you can sample. The menu isn't full of your traditional boba that you've seen at other stores. I only like their jasmine green milk tea. Their boba is soft and chewy, so that's good. I had the strawberry milk tea before and it was super sweet. Their strawberry syrup was pure sugar. And the milk interacted weirdly with it. Beyond that,  it can be pricey but it is Hayes Valley. It's still nice to grab boba later in the evening instead of heading far out for some.", "author": "Michelle R."}

I order my drinks with minimal sugar and toppings. Often times, the addition of sugar can mask the flavor of the tea or whatever else (non dairy creamer additives) gets thrown into your drink as \"milk tea\". This place, however, passed the test. I got the Jasmine milk tea with less sugar and it was honestly the best boba drink I've ever had. There is a strong tea flavor while being equally creamy. Everything was just right about this drink. My friends ordered the white grape and matcha with toffee. Those were also very good. Highly recommend!", "author": "Chinh N."}

I usually go to Little Sweet for boba but wanted to switch it up a bit. I ordered the matcha toffee with honey boba and my fiance ordered the creme brulee. Both drinks were pretty good but the creme brulee was my favorite. I'm a huge sucker for texture and the torched pieces or sugar put in a nice touch to the drink. It was also the right amount of sweetness without needing any changes. The matcha toffee was good after I asked them to add a little more sweetness to it. I enjoyed the toffee bits in the drink as well. Reminds me of the matcha gold ice cream from Garden Creamery. The honey boba was also a good consistency. I thought the prices were a bit steep for what it was.. especially since the cup sizes were just a standard small. But it does make sense since they're located in a pretty pricey neighborhood. I'd definitely come back when I feel like splurging on boba.", "author": "Antoinette T."}

The store was really roomy with some tables and benches in a corner for people to wait on for their orders. Their menus are really simple to read and to the point and very cute ! I ordered the \"Bae-sil\" (regular sweet) which Is pretty much supposed to be a strawberry lemonade drink. I was really excited to try this but after I took the first sip, I think I regretted not going for the other specialty drinks. It wasn't completely bad but it definitely wasn't worth the 5 bucks for such a small cup. It didn't taste like strawberry , it didn't taste like lemonade. It was like a watered down slightly sweet and sour tea with a somewhat earthy taste to it. On the bright side, the boba was really really good. It was a good soft chewiness and it was sweet from the honey which I enjoyed a lot. I would definitely love to give this place another try, but maybe go for one of the more popular reviewed drinks like the matcha toffee.", "author": "Mandy C."}

The tea quality is really on point and the recipes are innovative and original. I tried a bunch of interesting options off their menu, but settled on the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was fantastic. The custard was very well made and on par with creme brulee at many restaurants. The boba was a great consistency with a solid, noticeable amount of honey flavor. The tea was very delicate and let the other flavors of the toppings shine through. The use of crunchy, candy-like toppings like burnt sugar and toffee was especially interesting and provided nice flavor as well as great contrast with the soft boba and custard. All around, it was great boba, but my only complaints would be the size and the price. $5.25 is way too much for such a tiny cup, even boba guys with its extremely inflated prices doesn't charge that much, and offers a larger size.", "author": "Jay P."}

Immediately as I approached the front of the line the employee offers me samples of 2 different types of drinks and says to let her know if I have any questions. I make my order but unfortunately they ran out of the torched sugar and it wouldn't be available for another 30 minutes. Since I don't frequent SF often I really wanted to try it anyway and asked if I could get a discount if I ordered the drink without the torched sugar. The girl asks the other two guys making the drinks and they give an ok to the discount. I ordered my drinks at normal sweetness with boba which came out to less than $9 and waited about 5 minutes for the drinks to be made. Both drinks satisfied my sweet tooth but I think next visit I'd tone down the sweetness a bit because the sips with toffee and I'm assuming the torched sugar along with the pudding would send it a bit over the edge.
