I was at the Museum, with some free time, in between lectures, and wandered down here for a casual (order at the counter) sit down lunch.\n\nInterestingly, the menu changes along with the featured exhibits. For example, since Casanova spent some of his earlier years, there are a couple of Italian dishes on the menu. I ordered a vermicelli glass noodle dish with pork. It had a very strong Vietnamese slant, with a profound taste of fish sauce. In fact, if I closed my eyes, I would've sworn I was eating this dish at a Vietnamese restaurant! It was pricey, but really, really good. In fact, this was my second time enjoying this dish here. I wanted to have it one more time, before they removed it from their rotating menu.\n\nThey also serve a variety of desserts after they stop serving their full lunch menu.\n\nThere's also outdoor seating available in an outdoor garden-like setting. Only problem is those warmer days are really rare in SF, especially in this part of town.\n\nI definitely wouldn't make a special trip to come here, as I'd say it's definitely overpriced for what it is, but I usually always do lunch here whenever I do a \"museum day\" here.", "author": "Lori N."}

Downstairs, along with restrooms, a gift store and some smaller exhibits.  We thought the menu very excellent and the food very good, but the prices are high.  But given the location, the quality of food, perhaps the prices are somewhat justified.  Out lunch, two grilled cheese sandwiches, bag of chips and two sodas was $49.65.  Now that I see that in writing, it IS very expensive.\n\nYou go through a cafeteria line with a tray.  Order, pick up your drinks and chips grab a number on a stand and then make a gallant try to find a table.  It was crowded on the weekend we were visiting.  Fortunately, some of the tables occupied by one or two people will, European style, allow you to sit with them.  Otherwise...you wait.\n\nImpressive menu.  The grilled cheese sandwich is with mushrooms and truffles.  Pretty fancy and very flavorful but at $19 each, better be.  There are salads at $13 - 15, quiches at $13 and chicken pot pie for $14.50.  Sandwiches $12 - 19 and a hotdog is $7.50. \n\nBut it is clean, well kept up with table clearing and the staff is very nice.  A-OK.\n\nAnd if you think you can go elsewhere to eat, forget it unless you want to hike to your distant car, drive  into the surrounding area and then return?  Nope...you are a captive audience, so just bite the bullet or your truffle grilled cheese and consider it another way of supporting an excellent museum.", "author": "Mitch K."}

I saw that the cafe was offering a tea service during lunch (to go with their Houghton Hall exhibit) and, so Anglophile that I am, I chose to partake in that.  I didn't even bother to look at their regular menu.  My husband, on the other hand, chose from the regular menu and I'm so glad he did!\n\nI ordered the White Peony tea and let it steep for a few minutes, as suggested by the server.  Sadly, the tea was not that fragrant.  It really didn't have that much of a taste.  I was really disappointed with that tea.  I probably should have ordered a different one.  My sandwiches and sweets came shortly after the tea arrived.  The sandwiches were just okay.  I have had better.  Not the same quality as The Empress Lounge at the Mandarin Oriental in DC and the Rotunda at Neiman Marcus, two of the most recent tea services I've had.  The salmon sandwich was the best out of the four.  The others were a little dry and tasteless.\n\nAs for the sweets, they came on a small pedestal server.  So cute.  The plain scone was a little dry.  My husband ate the other scone which had dried fruit in it, so I didn't get to taste that.  The poppyseed loaf was okay.  I had a small bite and gave the rest to my husband.  I also let my husband eat the slice of raisin bread because I just don't care for raisin bread.  I liked the French Macaron, the the cakes, and the muffin with blueberry cream on top.  \n\nMy husband ordered the Croque-monsieur and it was delicious!  It looked so good the way it was presented!  It had a generous amount of ham and the cheese crusted bread was so good!  He was kind enough to give me a couple of bites of his sandwich.  If you find yourself in this cafe, order that.  You won't be sorry!\n\nWe ate outdoors.  It was cloudy, but it wasn't too cold.  It's actually quieter outside too.  Just be advised though that birds, lots of them, may descend upon your table and environs as you're having lunch.

We happen to be at Lands End hiking when my wife got hungry and wanted to get something to eat. Found a trail that led up to a road which led us to the Legion of Honor. We checked in our bag and the lady that we spoke to told us there was a cafe, so we grabbed a bite to eat. Food was good and I polished it off with a cold beer. We sat outside since the weather was amazing and had a great ambiance. You order at the counter and then seat yourself with a number to place at your table and they bring your food items out to you. Good idea to have an in house cafe since we ended up spending 4-5 hours in the museum.", "author": "Nathan G."}

My belly is so distended that my ribs hurt and my back aches.  I ate a chocolate-dipped coconut macaroon between 10:45 and 11:15 a.m. at the cafe, and symptoms showed up at 3:30 p.m.  I know it must have been the macaroon because I had nothing else to eat this morning, or this afternoon until 3 p.m. - I was in the middle of my lunch when the bloating first showed up.  I have not had anything to eat since then, either. \n\nThis is not the first time I've had a problem here.  Somewhat over a year ago, I had the quiche for lunch, and got food poisoning, which I identified as Clostridium perfringens per the UC Wellness home medicine book.  Again, the quiche was the Only thing I had eaten that day. \n\nI do not know whether any of the food is prepared on site - I doubt it.  The cafe's own web page indicates that it comes from a caterer.  Perhaps the food is not being transported at the proper temperature, or perhaps it is not being stored at the proper temperature on site, or perhaps a cook is not following proper hygienic practices in food preparation.  All I know is that Something Is Very Wrong. \n\nI agree with reviewers who have said that the food is pretentious and overpriced.  But that doesn't bother me so much - I am not a good cook, and I have the means to eat out A Lot.  However, another fault is not enough variety of choices.  I got the macaroon because there wasn't anything else that appealed to me at that time of day.  Little did I know that macaroons usually contain egg whites.  I am not allergic to eggs - far from it, I eat them Every Day.  But combined with what happened with the quiche, it seems to me that egg dishes in particular are not being handled properly at this cafe. \n\nIf you do eat at the museum cafe, limit yourself to tea, coffee, bottled beverages, and packaged chips.  Don't trust anything else.", "author": "Carlisle H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-18", "description": "I suppose my stomach is pretty strong because I didn't experience what a lot of people in these Yelp reviews experienced. No vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that so I suppose I can at least throw them one star, but I'm afraid that's all they get.  \n\nI don't object to the pretentiousness of the menu, since I'm somewhat of a foodie myself, though what I do object to firstly is the choices, which are pretty limiting.  I think there's just four items on the lunch menu: some overpriced 8 dollar \"tomato bisque\", and then a kale salad.  It's already been scientifically proven that everybody hates kale, though restaurants are still behind the times on the trend.  Guys, that's so 2011 to late 2012. We're over kale now, and don't even think about quinoa. We like mixed greens and baby spinach. Stick to the classics.  The two other items were: a veggie burger. Just, no.   There's no point to veggie burgers; if I wanted a patty that tasted like meat, I'd eat a hamburger. Don't dress up a mixture of greens and add flavoring to it. Vegetarians: you made a point of avoiding meat, I'm sorry but you can't cheat! Just like Diet Coke.. if I wanted to drink sugar water, why would I drink syrupy water with fake sugar and tastes worse? Anyway.  The last option was something called a \"Cavalier Chapman\". I don't know what that means and I'm sure it's supposed to coincide with whatever dumb art they're charging people to see at the museum, but this is a very ill-conceived concoction.  I did order it because it was the only thing with meat, but the description even sounded weird.  \"A mixture of beef, pork, and turkey\" with some lettuce and some special sauce on some bread.  I don't need that much meat, but okay, I'll give it a day in court.  It turns out that it's this sort-of stew of meat and crunchy carrot bits slopped in between some bread with like 3 arugula leaves and some sauce.  I swear, there's no way this thing is designed by a chef.  It's made up by mental patients in cooking therapy class. Once you try to lift the sandwich, half of it spills out from the bread and all over your hands, and once you bite in to the hard, crusty bread, even more spills out on your lap.  After wiping myself off, I had to just try to eat the rest with a fork.  Okay, so the taste wasn't actually bad.  It was kind of spicy and had some other good flavors going on, including the sauce.  It's the consistency that made me very cross.  I hate the mess that it makes and I hate the chunks of carrots that weren't cooked.  Raw carrots are delicious but they're all wrong for a stew, or a stew sandwich in this case.  Plus, this sandwich was fifteen bucks plus another buck fifty for an avocado.  Throw in an orange soda and then taxes and a tip and I spent over 20 bucks for this disappointment.  \n\nI guess my problem is that I don't know exactly what to expect from a museum cafe in terms of quality.  Usually, you can just get a pressed panini sandwich with chips or maybe a potato salad and some soup for around 3 dollars a cup.  I don't know why they need to charge as much and why they need to come up with weird menu items and then have to fail at them so badly.  Like I said, maybe there's not a common practice amongst all museums , public or private, but as long as they don't try too hard they should be a decent place to eat.

I enjoy the floor-to-ceiling French doors on the outside wall.  I enjoy watching people enjoy the sunshine on the outside patio.  I enjoy looking at the lawn outside the end of this long dining room, which itself could be a gallery.  \n\nUpon entering the cafe, it appeared that we were facing a take-out counter.  This was not the whole story, though, as the menus in our hands testified.  Ordering off the menu would rate us table service, and after we had ordered, we walked to our table with our number in hand.  \n\nWe ordered a Reuben sandwich and a Caesar salad, and carried our own diet Coke and tea to the table.  A buffet-style serving station along the inside wall provided the hot water for the tea.  The Reuben was mild, with something like a jack cheese in it, and the Caesar had large, crunchy croutons and Cardini dressing.  Even though we did not order chicken breast on the Caesar, and were not charged for it, we were served it, a gift from the Cafe and from the Universe.  \n\nThe service here seemed a little absent-minded, which was the same as my impression on previous visits.  Outside of a museum or a hotel, I'd flinch at the $26.04 price.  But that, you see, is part of the experience.  It was good to relax fearlessly, and to feel rich.", "author": "David D."}

We arrived at 1:35 and were informed by the too-cool-for-school maitre d' that we had to come back at 1:45.  I most certainly had an incredulous look on my face as I looked at the bountiful empty tables.  What difference does 10 minutes make?

Or, God forbid, 1:46...would we have missed our reservation because we aren't anal time keepers?\n\nBread basket - Cheesecake Factory has better bread.  Butter - well, it's hard to mess up butter.  Fruit in a bowl - uninspired.  Mimosa - I've had better in, gasp, Laurel Heights.  I had the Florentine and the most over-seasoned salad in the world.  I wanted to wash my lettuce in my water.  The toast under my over-poached eggs was hard enough to sand a deck.  The pot de creme was mediocre.  The shortbread was okay.\n\nThe service was pretentious and sloppy.  For $53, I'd prefer not to have my dishes thrown down on the table like they didn't matter.  Then again, the waiter probably knew how crap the food was so treated it with the respect it deserved.\n\nAnd as I sat there ingesting all the salt in California, I had to ask myself what the kitchen actually did.  This is going back to the \"come back in 10 minutes\" thing.  I would have understood if they needed to keep things spaced out for the kitchen if things had to be made to order for everyone.  But honestly, the only things the kitchen actually had to make were poached eggs (badly), a crab frittata (didn't hear anything about it), and steak (though I didn't see any coming from the kitchen).\n\nTake your $53/head and spend it on food that's made and served with more love and care.

AND they didn't tell us that we had to go down to the cafe, talk to the manager, and obtain our ticket there for the exhibits.  He was very nice about it, and 5 minutes later we had a sticker that would allow us into everything.

The poor kids waiting tables here just seemed overwhelmed and the restaurant wasn't even busy.  It took a really long time for them to come take an order and after we flagged him down he was flustered and dropped his order slips on the floor, whoops.  And when our food came out of the kitchen the servers clearly weren't sure which table to bring it to, so we just waved at them.  In their defense, at least they apologized to the next table for their food being so late.  And I forgive them for bringing our folio with our credit card in it to the wrong table, although that could have turned out badly.\n\nTonight we had a rare dinner at the museum as we were at the Legion for the supper club after hours exhibit (which, incidentally is really the best way to see a popular exhibit without the crowds and see a movie to boot).  One of us had the frisee salad, which, strangely enough came with a fried egg (I've only seen them poached) and the greens weren't frisee, but a leafy lettuce.  We had the fish and chips with the aioli and spicy ketchup.  Yum.  Yes $17 is pretty steep for fish and chips but it's the most convenient place to eat when visiting the Legion.   They had a fun special cocktail for the evening also.\n\nI had a slightly better experience service at lunchtime during my last visit.  I think the servers are just much more accustomed to the lunch service system where diners order at the counter bring their number to their table so they need to practice more for the dinner events where they have to take orders and remember which table placed them.  \n\nNote that for supper club evenings they do take reservations.", "author": "Don L."}

As a Green nut who works for the Sierra Club, this made me pretty happy for my own reasons.\n\nAs to the food itself -- I had an awesome salad.  I am not the type of person who normally considers a salad to be a suitable meal.  The greens were varied and fresh, the balsalmic dressing was tossed in with a light touch (not swamping the lettuce).  There was thickly cut, not too salty prosciutto mixed in (more meaty than fatty, yay!).  Also mixed in was goat cheese and some great seasonable fruit, nectarines and some plum pieces.  Excellent blend of salty and sweet.  My boyfriend had a standard chicken Caesar, which I was surprised to taste was actually garlicky and not tamed down for the masses.  They prepared it right there instead of making us get the pre-stocked ones by the register.  \n\nAmbiance as also great, the terrace there is gorgeous on a clear day with the ocean views.

Finally, I ended with a Scharffen Berger Chocolate Pot de Creme, which was the best chocolate fix I've had in months.  My brunch mates tried the other variations on the menu: smoked salmon frittata, poached egg with dandelion greens, and rhubarb tart.
