Whether it's cold or warm outside, or if you're feeling a little under the weather, or if you're about to rage all night and need to refuel, or if you're just plain hungry, a Jasmine Garden bowl of Pho is perfect any time. On the rare occasion that they go on vacation, I have to add it to my calendar and I count down the days until they re-open. \n\nNot to mention the familial service that you'll get from the owner and employees. When you step into Jasmine Garden, they treat you like family. \n\nSingle diners are just as welcome as large groups. Avoid the lunch and dinner rush to have a more relaxed atmosphere to enjoy your meal. \n\nI can only wish great things for this place, and many more years of success. \n\nWhat to order:\n\n- Pho Noodle Soup (any way you want it)\n- Crunch Roll\n- Beef Carpaccio \n- Vietnamese Ice Coffee\n\nCheers and I hope you enjoy your meal!", "author": "Enzo N."}

Located its location in the Duboce Triangle, where there isn't really a large Vietnamese community, I had pretty low expectations for authentic food. While the restaurant, decor, and wait staff definitely has more of an upscale vibe than classic Vietnamese restaurants I've been to (I did not leave the restaurant deaf and emotionally abused), the food was really, really delicious. \n\nWe got the shrimp spring rolls to start, and had the pho ga (chicken noodle soup) and bun bo hue. The hue noodle soup came bubbling hot and spicy, and the pho ga was a classic comfort food. I wish there had been a bit more chicken, but the bowls are gigantic with generous portions of soup and noodles so you'll definitely leave stuffed. \n\nWhile the prices are a bit higher than other Vietnamese places, it is still cheaper than the majority of restaurants in the area, and the ambiance is a lot nicer too (it's a nice casual place to take parents, or for a date). I will definitely be back!", "author": "Denise L."}

This place is amazing. They are owned by a cute Vietnamese family and have legit bowls of noodles, rice places, and rolls for the Castro. Service is speedy quick and when you become a regular they treat you like family. \n\nThe first few times I came here the waiter reminded me that their bowls don't have tendon/tripe and that their bun bo hue has no pork blood. I guess we Vietnamese people look out for each other :p If you need these in your noodles, this is not the place for you. \n\nHighly recommend the imperial rolls, pho, bun bo hue, and bun rieu. Also love the bun thit nuong cha goi with pork (leftovers the next day just as good!). Portions are great and food is authentic, flavorful, and delicious.", "author": "Christy L."}

If I could, I would give this place a million stars!!!! I AM IN LOVE!!!\n\nI know a brutal honest truth about SF 'diverse' cuisines: it has indeed diversity however, not authentic. Everything pretty much whites out. I have tried many places; have my favorites and many of those that not make into the list...this place has my top vote. This month is my mother's birthday. I can only talk to her on the phone. I miss her so much! To remind me of her cooking, I've been eating out at Vietnamese restaurants all week. Been to my regulars as well as new places. Jasmine Garden is the very first place that has the Sweet and Sour fish soup, which has the closest flavor to my mother's cooking style. She is the influencer of my love for food so this is huge.\n\nOf course, they could make it a little sourer still, I almost cried while tasting the very first spoon. Oh my damn, it is so good. I felt that I was actually at home *sobbing*\n\nThis is not the most affordable restaurant. Having said that, with the friendly and super fast customer services; clean, cozy atmosphere (though quite noisy as it gets late); super delicious dishes - many hard to find dishes& fresh ingredients-you can tell with the fishes; it is worth the paycheck!!! Plus, we usually spend this much on a dinner out ($30/each) anyway. With Jasmine Garden, we ordered 3 entrees, 2 main dishes, 2 extra jasmine rice and it costed us the same---the portion was large so...I totally dig it.\n\nWill come back as much as I could.

I would recommend this dish.\n- Jasmine Garden clay pot special: chicken, shrimp, and mushrooms in a delectable sauce. Plenty of rice. Only downsides were the dry chicken and wish there was more sauce.\n\nService was exceptionally good and friendly.\n\nVerdict: pretty good. Imperial roll and the service carried this rating.

I came to Jasmine Garden about twice in the past two weeks. It's located in a very convenient location in the Duboce Triangle area, and is a great dinner stop before going out to drink at the some nice bars around the area. It's right next door to Last Rites, which is a newly-opened really cool tiki bar, but that's another review.\n\nThis place has a \"veggie pho\" soup which is really cool for vegetarians, since to my knowledge a lot of pho places don't really have vegetarian options that don't use chicken broth. I tried this veggie soup this first time I was here because my stomach was feeling a bit unwell, and it was really well done - light but flavorful - perfect if you just want a soup that's not too heavy. The second time I came here I tried the Bun Bo Hue, which is the complete opposite of the veggie pho but was also super delicious. \n\nAnyway the cool part is they have a Banana Flamb\u00e9 dessert which I got the second time I came here with a friend for her birthday which is literally a banana with ice cream that they SET ON FIRE. Ok I know that that's literally what banana flamb\u00e9 means (I think) but I've never had one and neither had my friend and OK IT WAS REALLY COOL. So highly recommend if you want to see a banana set on fire. The rum flavor is really strong though so idk though that wasn't great.\n\nAlso the service here is super nice. We didn't tell the servers that it was my friend's birthday but they either overheard or inferred it was the case so they celebrated my friend's birthday which was super cute.\n\nLastly - parking - I know this isn't really an SF thing, but I was able to find parking here the last time I came around - so it's doable in this area if you're wondering about it. However, if you can take public transportation, literally every Muni Metro line comes around this area so that's still probably the better option.", "author": "Brian W."}

There's two types; one with no service, condiments and utensils on the table and the other with table covers, glassware and service.  Jasmine has various Vietnamese string instruments on the walls and fans on the ceiling fans.  This is different from handwritten specials taped to the walls on most Viet restaurants in the TL.\nDecided to come here because we were tired of the variety in the TL which we frequented because it was walkable but a 7 minute drive to Jasmine was well worth it. \n\nQuality, price, and ambiance was better than I expected.  Food better than what I've had in the city at about the same price as the first type of Asian restaurants mentioned earlier.  Quality ingredients for a good price is worth coming back for.\n\nFor me if a restaurant has banh xeo there's no need to see what else they have unless it's their specialty.  Their's is the best so far I've had in the city.  Crispy, flavorful, and packed with chicken and shrimp.  All the veggies that accompanied it looked fresh; lettuce, mint, Thai basil, cucumbers, and carrots.  The sauce is not as light as what I'm used to but good nonetheless.  \nMy partner got the pho ga.  Clear broth with plenty of noodles and chicken.  With slight food poisoning over the Holidays it was the only thing he could stomach with reluctance and he said it was pretty good as is, no hoisin or sriracha to mask the blandness.

A was looking for Pho and I wanted something light, but flavorful. After checking Yelp, we trekked over. This place was really busy at 8:30PM on a Sunday. It is not a small restaurant and I am pretty sure we got the last available seats. It did take a while for us to get our menu and to order but that gave us time to appreciate the smells wafting out of the kitchen. Once we did get our menu, we were somewhat overwhelmed by the choices as everything looked delicious and was very reasonably priced. We also noted the really cheap alcohol so if that's your thing, definitely stop by. Anyways, we decided not to imbibe but we ordered:\n\n-Imperial Rolls - This is our favorite guilty pleasure and Jasmine Garden's did not disappoint. They were perfectly spiced and I liked that these were miniature so they could be handheld. The sauce served with it was addicting.\n\n-Beef Carpaccio - This is what I got and it really hit the spot for something light and healthy. It was spiced well and the textures worked well together. I did find it really hard to heat, however, especially with chopsticks.\n\n-Beef Pho - This is what A got, as planned. It was fine and he seemed to enjoy it. I am not really into Pho but it was good.\n\nOverall, we would definitely come back. A lot of their noodle dishes looked delicious and we would love to sample more appetizers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-20", "description": "I'm a bit torn about Jasmine Garden due to the fact that it's claims to be \"authentic Vietnamese cuisine,\" but in fact I found it quite inauthentic.  Although this place has a Vietnamese owner and some of our dishes were tasty, I am docking one star (what would have been a 3 star review) for the authenticity part.  I dined there twice for lunch recently and what kept me going back was the Bun Rieu soup.  The soup base seemed authentic and I give them that.  \n\nThe location is right across the street from the Church St. Muni station, so it's easy to get to via public transportation.  It's also across the street from the Castro Safeway.  I don't imagine there to be many other Viet spots around the area, so Jasmine Garden might be your best bet if you are craving some pho.  However, I feel that because it may be the only Viet restaurant in the area, the owners have Americanized the traditional dishes quite a bit (and maybe also to cut cost).  \n\nFirst visit eats:\n- Beef Carpaccio:  I'm not a huge fan of raw beef, but my friend wanted to order it so I tried two slices.  It looked really nice presentation-wise and would be a great starter.  The beef was topped with a lot of fresh cilantro, red onions and peanuts.  Everything was fine until I took my first bite and one of the peanut pieces was so hard like a piece of gravel.  Maybe a bad bite.  I tried another piece and the same thing happened.  I swear I could have broken a tooth.   \n- Vietnamese Crepe (Bun Xao): The crepe was nice and crispy without being too greasy.  It looked great with all the accompaniments (fresh lettuce, mint, cucumber, shredded carrots and fish sauce).  The crepe itself was filled with a ton of cooked bean sprouts, but had very little shrimp and chicken.  The shrimp were cut in half, so very skimpy.  The taste itself was completely bland.  There was no seasoning whatsoever on the bun xao and you have to rely on the fish sauce to give it any flavor.  Very disappointing.  \n- Vietnamese Seafood Soup (Bun Rieu):  Traditionally, the bun rieu's main ingredient is crab.  However, at JG there is no crab at all.  Nor was there any pork.  They give you a huge bowl of thin vermicelli noodles but there's very little in the way of proteins.  There's mostly fried tofu, drop egg and maybe 4 shrimp if you're lucky.  The best is the soup.  That was layered with flavors including strong lemongrass and a rich tomato base.  It's just misleading bc this is not real bun rieu.  \nTotal tab was $42 including tax and tip.  Pretty pricey for what it was and what we got.  I thought the soup was the best part aside from the clean restaurant and good service.  \n\nSecond visit eats:\n- Vietnamese Crepe (Bun Xao): Thought it might be better this time.  Wrong, it was just the same as the first time - bland and skimpy on the meats.  \n- Vietnamese Seafood Soup (Bun Rieu): Again, very similar to the first experience but I did go for the soup. \n- Bun Bo Hue: Again, I hate to be the Debbie Downer here, but definitely was not authentic.  The soup was great (lemongrass and beef spicy broth) and that was the only thing going for this dish.  This is a classic Viet noodle soup that uses Hue noodles.  JG does not use hue noodles, instead they use the same thin vermicelli that is in their bun rieu.  The underlying theme is you get a huge bowl of noodles and not much else.  They serve the bun bo hue with 5 thinly sliced pieces of beef.  There was none of the traditional beef meats in this bowl such as the beef shank, oxtail, pig's knuckles or congealed pig's blood.  \nTotal tab was $45.  For the noodle bowls to be priced at $10.50 each, I would expect more proteins.  Instead, you get a huge bowl of noodles.  The only saving grace is that their soups are really tasty and flavorful.  \n\nBy no means is Jasmine Garden authentic.  I have to disagree with their signage of their storefront.  It might be the best Vietnamese restaurant in the area as there is little or no competition, so they raise the prices and skimp on the expensive ingredients (meat).  That's my theory.  Or maybe they think they can fool people who don't know much about Viet cuisine that their food is authentic?  Don't get me wrong, this is a nice family own restaurant and some of the food was tasty.  I think it's just not for me.  When I see Bun Rieu or Bun Bo Hue on the menu, I expect to get what it's supposed to be.  At JG,  they didn't deliver that so I felt disappointed especially after taking a trek across town.", "author": "Liv A."}

Served w/ three sauces.\nBasically a smorgasbord of all the appetizers that Jasmine Garden offers.  This is a great starter if you're eating a group of folks.\n\nSalt & Pepper Prawns --  http://bit.ly/1fG2yc6\nPrawns lightly battered then fried and wok tossed in salt and pepper, garlic, butter and chili.  Served with garlic noodles.\nThis is my favorite dish there.  Garlic Noodles and Fried Prawns?  Yes please!!  \n\nDancing Beef --  http://bit.ly/1fG29X9\nFilet mignon cubes work tossed in garlic, butter, black pepper and served with organic mix green salad.\nI've had Bo Luc Lac at other Vietnamese spots, but Jasmine Garden's seems to be one of the better ones I've had.  Even way better than Thanh Long's.  They give you a very generous amount of beef and it was cooked just right so that the cubes stay flavorful and not dry.\n\nCurry Fried Rice --  http://bit.ly/1liX6kM\nFried rice with prawns, chicken, onion, garlic and curry powder\nFried rice with a slight kick.  It was a good choice to pair with the Dancing Beef.\n\nSo yeah, everything has been very solid and I really have no complaints here.

We found parking right in front and we were seated right way. Win! Jasmine Garden is located in the Castro and parking is all street parking and can be quite difficult.\n\nThe restaurant has better decor and is cleaner than your typical pho restaurant.

The bo tai chanh was delicious and just under $10, but the portion could have been bigger. The bun bo hue was disappointing however. The soup was tasty, but it was served with vermicelli noodles vs the thick round rice noodles and rare beef slices vs the traditional pork knuckles and pork blood. It didn't live up to the expectations we had. The wife did explain that they used to serve pork blood and pork knuckles but most of the patrons did not eat it and they ended up wasting a lot of the pork blood and knuckles so they substituted it with the rare beef slices.\n\nService was superb for a pho restaurant.

The three of us ended up ordering the BBQ pork with imperial rolls and all with rice instead of vermicelli.

It came along with three miniature rolls of fried imperial rolls that cannot disappoint. It was extremely crispy on the outside and that's the most important part! Lastly, the rice was super moist and fluffy just the way I like it! The portion was huge but it was so good that I ate the entire thing in one sitting. I had no regrets though, and you won't either!\n\nI also had a thai iced tea that I felt was sweetened perfectly for my sweet tooth and the dish and the drink totaled to be $14!

I first heard about Jasmine Garden from a friend who held the restaurant in very high esteem so I was pretty excited to try out the place.\n\nDid it live up to my expectations? Yes. Yes it did. \n\nWhen you first get to the restaurant, it really doesn't look like much from the outside. I expected a very small restaurant with minimal space, but it's actually quite large and nice on the inside. Clean and very presentable. \n\nWhen I got the menu, I immediately ordered the pho ga (chicken pho) and the garlic noodles. Within 5 minutes of ordering, my food was in front of me. I first tried out the pho ga and I really just have to say that it's definitely 10/10. I've been to a lot of pho restaurants and Jasmine Garden has some of the best pho I've ever had. The broth actually tasted like beef bone soup unlike at some pho restaurants where the pho is really just noodles sitting in a salt water bath. After trying out the pho, I tried out the garlic noodles which were just as amazing as the pho. I'm not a big fan of garlic flavored things, but the garlic noodles had just enough flavoring to make it taste really good.\n\nWith the garlic noodles and pho, my total came out to $16 which was not bad considering the amount of food I got. If you are nearby the Castro area, I highly suggest you stop by Jasmine Garden to try it out for yourself. Great food at a great price! :)", "author": "Derek L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-11", "description": "Jasmine Garden is located in The Castro district of SF. I was looking for a new pho restaurant to try out and this place popped up as highly reviewed and popular on Yelp. It isn't too far of a walk from my apartment so I decided to try it out.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at this establishment once.\n\nFOOD: I ordered the Pho Dac Biet. It contained thin sliced of tender beef, flank, and beef ball in a beef broth. The noodles and soup was delivered to me very fast and came out piping hot (a very important quality to me in good noodles and soup). The soup was absolutely delicious and I was quite full upon finishing. I'm used to getting Sriracha and BBQ sauce which I normally mix with sugar for a very good dipping sauce for the meats in the soup (I highly recommend making it for yourself) but I wasn't given any. I'm not sure if they were out or if that's more of an American add-on to pho but I did wish they offered any. I think I would have enjoyed the meal more had I been given some since I've become very accustomed to having those condiments with my pho.\n\nDRINK: Jasmine Garden had a small selection of alcoholic and fountain drinks. I ordered a beer and a glass of water to go with my soup. It's a pretty small place without a bar so I wasn't expecting a huge drink menu.\n\nATMOSPHERE: This was a very traditional small Vietnamese pho restaurant. I went a little later in the evening but I could imagine it gets pretty crowded during prime dining hours. If the traditional Vietnamese restaurant style is very important to you when enjoying pho I think you'll enjoy this spot.\n\nSTAFF: I don't expect much conversation at traditional pho places. I grew up in Philadelphia going to several and normally my only conversations with the staff were ordering and then paying. I would have been fine with the same treatment this time had I not wanted to ask for Sriracha and BBQ sauce. Other pho restaurants I go to normally just have it on the table so you don't have to speak to the staff after ordering. If you are expecting a lot of staff interaction I don't think you'll find that here. But that's not a problem for me since I find it's expected at a place like this.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nI enjoyed my experience at Jasmine Garden. There are other pho places closer to my apartment that I will probably frequent more often than this one but I'm totally open to going back if I'm in the area. If you are in The Castro and you love pho definitely check this place out.", "author": "Christopher D."}

I knew this place existed but never gave it much thought since I already have my favorite Vietnamese restaurants that are closer to my home. But I decided to give it a try when I had a free evening. Conveniently located adjacent to the  Church Street MUNI station and inexplicably decorated with strings of blue Christmas lights (...or maybe they were Hanukkah), it looks to be quite a popular spot since a lot of the tables were filled by 6PM. They also seem to do quite a takeout business since there were several people on chairs staring at their iPhones as they were waiting for their food.\n\nI was seated at the table nearest to the front door where I could see the comings and goings of the staff and the customers. I was starving, so I started with the aforementioned Spring Rolls, a tad pricey at $6.50 but quite gargantuan and tasty to boot with poached shrimps, lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, sweet basil and rice noodles wrapped in translucent rice paper and served with peanut sauce (see photo). They were deliciously crunchy, and those baskets were empty in a near-flash. I was in the mood for pho, which they don't have on their dinner menu - but the waiter didn't even pause or try to talk me out of it. He simply rushed to the back to give me a lunch menu to decide on which one. I went with the $7.50 bowl of Bun Rieu, which they dub the Sea Noodle Soup because of the shrimp, I guess.\n\nThere was egg drop (instead of the usual omelette), fried tofu, and vermicelli noodles in a tomato-based chicken broth (see photo). It was a bit greasy on top, but I enjoyed slurping it. You'd think that would be enough, but I also ordered a $3.50 side of the Sauteed Green Beans topped with ground peanuts (see photo). It turned out to be a great additional ingredient in the soup . So was the hefty basket of steamed rice as I scooped it into the broth as well (see photo). I was getting full, but I still powered my way through the food which overall, was pretty darn satisfying considering I didn't know what to expect from a Vietnamese place in this part of the Castro.

I see it as a 3-star place with at least 4-star familial treatment for its regular customers.\n\nI'd only been here once before and wasn't recognized this time, but nearly everyone else was greeted and / or seen off with a hug, kiss, knowing phrase, etc.. The staff seamlessly unpaused what were obviously running conversations with most of the diners, and new talks were taken up with out-of-towners. Side note: if you don't want your personal life aired out, don't get too intimate with the workers. Their conversations with customers were very audible. My own service got off to an uncertain start, but by the end of my meal I too got a chat with the man and a holler 'n' wave from the woman. I honestly understood maybe 40% or less of the man's English during our talk, but what counts is the staff's social nature.\n\nThe dish I ordered, like numerous others on the menu, was labeled \"(spicy)\". Rather than specifically request hotness, I had my dish as-is to gauge this restaurant's baseline spiciness. My threshold for heat is so low as to say it's pretty much nonexistent. Given this, even I say my dish wasn't spicy at all. Maybe I would've gotten some zing out of biting the whole red chilies that were mixed in, but the sauce, the food itself, the scattered flakes of pepper... nothing. It didn't bring the ruckus. If you want heat, I suggest explicitly telling your server to turn up the spice. Or do what my friends and I do - take out a thermometer, point to the top, and be like, \"My food better be like THIS okaaaay?\" Kidding. Don't do that (unless you're dining with us).\n\nAlso, the amount of food was small compared to those of similar restaurants and prices. Was this a lunch thing? I'm almost never in restaurants before nightfall, so I wouldn't know. I'm not a big eater, but I don't expect cooks to read my mind and respond by giving me less. Had the portion been any smaller, it would've entered the range of tapas. I'm not exaggerating.\n\nI'd say the realest minus of my experience was that two of the three specialty Vietnamese drinks listed on the menu were unavailable. This was a graver tease than when I saw servers wearing Hite (a Korean beer) aprons in a Japanese restaurant that didn't have Hite. Incidentally, the conversation that the man started with me concerned the missing drinks. The clearest parts I caught were that, around here, they're only available wholesale and not many customers ask for them. Otherwise, I would've considered the hard-to-find beverages a reason to come here. I'll have to check back in the future.\n\nIf you're going to eat here, I suggest you do so while they still have the Christmas decorations up. Included are stuffed animal chicks or ducklings sitting in stockings and wreaths. They're something to see. One even sits in a wreath above the prayer altar at the front of the restaurant.\n\n(Mini) Chapter Two: A Prior Visit\n\nAre you one of those pranksters who sneaks meat onto the plates of vegetarians and vegans, telling them it's soy / seitan / gluten / whatever? Well, this place pulls the opposite on you. I was here in a group of 3, and one person ordered vegetarian / vegan rolls. The person bit into a piece, analytically chewed, then told the group they thought the rolls had meat. The other 2 tasted pieces but couldn't tell. Asking the man (the same man from today) revealed that what tasted, chewed, and seemed like meat in the rolls actually was faux.\n\nOne of the people in our group spoke a little Vietnamese, which probably didn't hurt the level of service we got. So if you have Vietnamese-speaking friends, consider bringing them along.\n\nEveryone liked the food. I ordered the \"Fresh Coconut\" drink, which literally was a coconut with the very top sliced off to insert a straw. This kind of thing needs to be done by more establishments, such as airplanes for when I fly to Vietnam to score the missing drinks from today.", "author": "Dan B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-29", "description": "\"Peter!....Peter!.....Peter?\"\n\nAs soon as my friend and I walked into Jasmine Garden today, we were graciously welcomed by one of the owners thinking that my friend was \"Peter\". With puzzled looks on our faces, the owner quickly realized that my friend wasn't \"Peter\" and nicely ushered us in to sit at a table. Apparently, \"Peter\" is a regular with the same fohawk and dresses in a suit every time he comes in. But anyhow...\n\nF O O D:\nThis is not your typical Pho restaurant. Although they do have Pho on the menu, they also have a variety of Buns (noodle plates), Com Dia (rice plates) and Cac Mon Thit (entrees: chicken, beef, lamb and seafood). They do have Roasted Crab but you have to call in advance to reserve it. \n\nI rarely venture out of the TL, Richmond or Sunset to eat Vietnamese food but I was pleasantly surprised at this Mom & Pop restaurant. I told the owner/waitress that I'm sensitive to MSG and she kindly put in a request to have my food prepared without it. \n\n*BO TAI CHANH - Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio w/ Mint, Basil, Cilantro, Red Onion, Crispy Shallot, Fried Garlic, Crushed Peanut & Fish Sauce ($7.95):  A MUST ORDER!!!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5DeL87rp02kT8xHn1CJS1g?select=VDaa_I9rXKZh6xmy_FtoRw\n\nEach bite was like a refreshing BURST of various flavor and texture profiles! You get the soft beefyness from the silky carpaccio followed by the freshness of the mint and herbaceous basil, red onion and cilantro combo. You then get a sweet crunch from the fried shallots and garlic while the crushed peanuts gave it a nutty crisp. The fish sauce completed the dish adding a sweet, savory and tanginess without overpowering the star ingredient. \n\n*COM TAY CAM DAC BIET - Vietnamese Rice Clay Pot w/ Chicken, Shrimp, Chinese Sausage, Mushroom, Garlic & Ginger ($7.50): YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5DeL87rp02kT8xHn1CJS1g?select=RZHhae2kjKmXSKLPTTO3ig\n\nPresented by the Chef and served in a sizzling clay pot, the ginger and garlic aroma from the claypot permeated into the air. Inside the claypot was the white rice which had caramelized on the bottom and the sides of the claypot to a delicious crispiness. The Chinese sausage was rich and savory, however, the chicken and shrimp were a bit overcooked and dry. The sweet, savory sauce was packed with bold flavors and had infused into the rice and proteins making each bite full of garlicky ginger flavor. I love ginger and there was no shortage of ginger slivers which gave the rice layers of sweet aromatic flavor with a subtle spice. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nThe husband and wife duo are extremely hospitable and accommodating; very atypical of your ordinary Asian restaurant. They periodically checked on us to make sure everything was ok and my water glass was never empty. Btw, I loved the mint infused water which was very refreshing. \n\nOur orders came out fairly quickly; 5 mins for our apps and while we were still eating our apps, our entrees came out. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nA bit more upscale than your typical humble Asian restaurant but very simple nonetheless. Tables were well-spaced out and everything was clean. \n\nP A R K I N G:\nI would normally drive but since I was on my lunch break, I walked to JG because I'm a complete noob when it comes to public transportation (I missed the F-Line twice and then took the wrong bus so I threw in the towel and walked there).

However, being so close to the F-Line and the Church Street Station, you may want to take public transportation instead.\n\nIf you're craving Vietnamese food and don't want to go the shady TL, JG is an excellent option.

I recommended this place to my friend because I vaguely remember that it was good, and that...well, Yelp said so\nThe moment we sat down, the waiter asked if we're ready to order. I get it, if you're a regular (which we are so not), maybe you know exactly what you want the moment you sit your ass down?  Or...or because we look (and are) Vietnamese, we innately know what's good? OR, we already yelped the menu ahead of time and know exactly what we're craving for? Well, if you run a business, DO NOT assume those things! The two waiters kept returning to our table every half minute asking if we're ready to order, giving us nasty looks when we said we were not. And keep in mind, there were not a lot of customers in the restaurant at this point.\n\nFood: what a disappointment! I ordered a simple bowl of Bun Bo Hue. Nothing in the bowl spoke Bun Bo Hue: the noodles, the meat, the vegetables, the broth, everything was wrong! Either they're trying to be creative (not really), or they're cheating their customers by using cheap, convenient ingredients and call it something that it's not! When you call yourself \"authentic\" Vietnamese foods with Vietnamese decorations and television everywhere in the restaurant, you need to keep it authentic! It cannot be a Bun Bo Hue without its key ingredients, even if the broth is good.\nMy friend's Hu Tieu was so insignificant she didn't even finish it. \nI think 2 stars is very generous for the appetizers' cute decoration.", "author": "V\u00e2n P."}

Fine if you're letting people order over the phone (or god forbid online), but your website is obsolete and you're not answering the phone because \"it's busy.\"?! Hire more people.

I told her that I did not tell him to add extra vegetable, that I specifically ordered vegetarian bowl with tofu, and that's what I said. She said well that's not what the server told me. Your server was wrong, and so is your approach when you insisted that that's what he said that I ordered. The cashier didn't even bother to listen to me but rather she was talking over me. I don't mind paying for my meal, but to over charged someone wrongly, and not even listen your customer, is poor judgement and extremely disappointing. To top it off, after she overcharged me for something that I didn't order, in which I paid for in full, the cashier sarcastically says have a good day! What nerves you have.

I try to open the door with extreme difficulty, and then attempt to bust the door open with a forceful shoulder but to no avail. A guy inside, standing nearest to the door, clearly sees my struggle and ignores me. Thanks, dude. We walk around to see if there's another entrance, and there obviously isn't, so my friend tries the door and finally gets it open. \n\nThere's a bit of a wait, but we get seated within 5 minutes, but with no menus, so I grab a few paper menus. The waiter swings by almost immediately, grabs those away from me and plops down proper (and really nice!) menus. As my friend and I rifle through the menu, WE DON'T SEE ANY PHO. Um... I thought this was a Vietnamese restaurant? And why is it that both our neighboring tables all have noodle soups? We literally sit there for another 5 minutes reading and rereading the menu. Nothing. Finally, I scrounge up the courage to ask one of our neighbors what they ordered. That's when they tell us THERE WAS ANOTHER MENU! And that they went through the exact same struggle as we did when ordering. So I get back up, and grab the paper menus again. And like magic, the same waiter swings by as soon as I sit back down, grabs the paper out of my hand, and plops down an identical looking menu, but with completely different items inside. Why would you give me only the rice plate menu in the first place?? \n\nAnyway, we finally order a papaya salad to share, and I went with the bun bo hue.  The salad was super delicious, and the fresh shrimp was an extremely nice touch. Also, I loved how they put the spicy fish sauce on the side without us having to ask (especially since my friend can't handle heat). And now granted, my dish wasn't a true bun bo hue with all the bits and goodies you would normally find, and they just used the regular pho noodles, but the sliced beef was fresh, and the broth was full of flavor and nice and spicy. Very filling. \n\nNow the other amusing thing was, during our dinner, both our neighboring parties left and their tables were refilled with some new patrons. And both tables were also obviously wondering where the pho menu was. The couple next to us were whispering and pointing at our soups, and I heard one of them say \"is there another menu?\" That's when I did the neighborly (read: busybody) thing and shared our story with them. The other table didn't bother with the other menu, but I heard one of them say \"what is she having?\" and he wound up ordering my same dish. \n\nThis is probably one of those had to be there moments, but overall a very amusing dinner and the food was pretty good.", "author": "Veronica C."}

I love eating the bottom of a bibimbap where the rice is slightly burnt and crunchy which is exactly what was served in this dish. The lamb was really good and I say this because I DON'T eat lamb because of that funky smell it has, but the one bite I had didn't have that taste at all! \n\nOverall, this place is run by a couple who is super sweet and seems to love their restaurant and their customers.

It was also served with a side of lettuce, fresh tomato, pickled carrots and daikon, and the fish sauce for the rice. The meal was very filling and really tasty.\n\n    My bf ordered the vermicelli bowl with BBQ pork and imperial rolls (deep fried egg rolls). The rice noodle portion was very large, but the pork portion was smaller than the pork portion I had for my rice plate. So, if you prefer more meat, I would suggest the rice plate. Both dishes were priced at $8.50. The imperial rolls were very crispy, savory, and tasty.\n\n   We also ordered BBQ pork spring rolls as an appetizer (~$6). Two spring rolls (each cut in half) were served in little woven baskets and served with a fish sauce. I usually prefer the peanut sauce, so I requested the peanut sauce and the lady happily brought us some. This appetizer was just okay. The peanut sauce was really yummy.\n\nService is really wonderful!

If this is your first time, get the imperial rolls!!! \n\nThe pho was a let down. They have one size which makes no sense to me. You only get one selection for meats which is your typical combination. The bowl they have was about the size of a large so I guess $8 is worth it. \n\nThen I tasted the broth. It was mediocre. Nothing weird about the taste, just more watery than anything. The noodles were stuck together in a hard ball that I had to yank apart. They gave a decent amount of meats. I say decent because I've been to many better joints who were way more generous. Nothing wrong with the meats. In fact they were pretty tender and soft. \n\nSo if you're looking for a basic place to get your pho fix, it's not a bad choice. But if you're like me who's searching for a spot you can frequent, then maybe this isn't the place for you.", "author": "Sean B."}

The mixture of the cilantro, peanuts, and fish sauce made these tender raw beef slices amazing.\n\nChicken & Shrimp Salad =\nThis was okay. There wasn't much flavor in this dish -- had to drench it in fish sauce.\n\nShaking Beef =\nThe Shaking Beef here was tender, but the flavor was a bit off. It was still good, just a bit sour from the vinegar in the sauce.\n\nDeep-Fried Shrimp w/ Garlic Noodles =\nShrimp should have been a bit more deep-fried, but the garlic noodles were EXCELLENT here. \n\nSea Bass over Glass Noodle =\nThis dish was just okay. The sea bass was a bit TOO flaky and the glass noodles were too garlicky. It went pretty well with white rice (since there was so much pungency from the garlic), though.\n\nRoasted Quail =\nExcellent quail. It came out bursting with flames (from the Bacardi 151 that it was doused in) and had tons of flavor.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nJasmine Garden is one of the more authentic Vietnamese restaurants I've been to in SF.

Their pho is the best in San Francisco hands down. You can always tell by a restaurant's broth, and there's is amazing. I docked them one star for service. Although they are attentive, they can also be very slow and frazzled since there are the same 3 or 4 people that are running around the restaurant to help the customers. They should also add a waitlist or a spot to add names.

One of the few Vietnamese places near work (TL's a bit of a trek).\n\nFirst impression: Friendly servers who actually smile (How many times have you gotten pho and get Mean-Mugged for no apparent reason? Or if you haven't decided your order within 30 seconds of being seated?) and very clean restaurant.  They don't leave the condiments out by default, which can actually be a good thing since it can make things messy/smelly.  If you need something, just ask and they are very accomodating.\n\nThis place is a little more \"starter\" Vietnamese, forks are the default, not chopsticks - the Beef Pho contains a variety of meats and if you want to edit, you pare down the selection.  It keeps the menu uncluttered unlike a lot of pho joints which will have 15 selections of pho on its menu with only minute changes (#1 Rare beef, #2 Rare beef, flank, #3 Rare beef, flank, brisket, you get the idea).  So I got the pho with everything.  The broth is a little mild, almost sweet, but I just asked for some fish sauce to make it more savory.  Wasn't the best I've had, but it was super reasonably priced considering we're in SF and they gave gigantic portions (I probably waddled back to work), I will definitely return if I have a lunchtime craving.  Again, the friendly service boosts it up a notch. 3, but leaning to 3.5.", "author": "Alan W."}

This last time was one of the worst take out experiences ever, and I will not be returning.\n\nWe ordered from their dinner menu, which is from 5 pm - 9:30 pm Monday-Thursday (they are closed on Tuesday and open 5 pm - 10 pm Friday-Sunday). Being a vegetarian and seeing that vegetarians apparently go nuts for this spot I decided to go with the Crispy Egg Noodle With Seafood vegetarian version this time. I had previously tried the vegetarian pho which was mediocre. I tried substituting the shrimp, calamari, and scallops for soy chicken. They did not allow me to do this and charged me $2.50 for it, which I thought was ridiculous. My boyfriend ordered Beef Caparccio under the Pho section. The man who took our order was rude on the phone and hung up right before we asked how much it would be, without any estimated time for pickup. Several minutes later he called back informing us they were out of egg noodles. Ok...so I ordered the Vegetarian Chow Fun. However, this also came with a ton of seafood but only broccoli. My boyfriend asked if there were still veggies in this dish. He said not a lot, since my original dish had mixed vegetables we asked if we could still have that in this dish. He replied \"it does come with mixed vegetables.\" Making sure he understood what we were asking we asked again if there would be mixed veggies. He said \"That will be more money!\" Ok this is ridiculous. After some convincing he finally said he would add them. \n\nMy boyfriend went to pick up the food and brought it home. He looked at his dish which was definitely not soup. Confused, he went back to see if maybe they forgot it, luckily it was right down the street. They told him he did not order a noodle soup and that it was a mistake on their menu that they haven't changed. My bf still wanted pho so he ordered it, which came out pretty quickly. They still charged him full price for their mistake, which does not seem right. $40 spent and definitely not worth it. \n\nHow this restaurant got 4 stars is beyond me.

It's a fusion-type Vietnamese place.\n\nWalking in to the restaurant, I was anticipating myself for a full blown Vietnamese feast.  It's really hard finding a good Vietnamese restaurant in SF.  I guess growing up in SJ (and having mom's Viet cooking) makes me spoiled. I liked the decor of the place, it's very cozy and intimate.  It's also pretty authentic, as they were playing Vietnamese music when I walked in.  They also have Vietnamese import beer, which was pretty cool.\n\nI ordered Bun Bo Hue, and was expecting a real good bowl since I was already convinced this place was the real deal thanks to the music and Viet beer.  Then I got my bowl.  It was NOT Bun Bo Hue.  Don't let the title of the dish fool you, because my dish was not what I was expecting.  Why are the noodles so thin?  Where was the pork blood?  Pig's feet?  Why was there bo tai in it?  What da heo?!?\n\nIt looked more like Bun Rieu than Bun Bo Hue.  Not to say that it wasn't decent, which it was, I was just a bit shell shocked.\n\nThus to the average no Viet food connoisseur, it might look good, but just heed the warning that if you were raised on Viet food, this place might not be for you.", "author": "Andy V."}

The place is owned by a nice couple who would come out occasionally throughout our dinner to make sure everything tasted right. The interior of the space is well decorated, and there was a flat screen TV on the wall that constantly broadcasted people eating delicious Pho, which got me even hungrier than I already was.\n\nFor appetizer, we got the salmon spring rolls. The presentation was really unique and creative. They used an upside down wine glass with the rolls displayed on top and the salad covered by the glass on the bottom. The veggies were  fresh and the salmon was flavorful. \n\nFor entree, I got the roasted crabs, which came with garlic noodles. Note that if you want to order the roasted crabs, you must call in at least the night before to make a reservation so that they can prepare it in advance. Again, the presentation of the dish was really cute. The garlic noodles were put into the shell of the body of the crab, and the legs were stacked on the side. In the middle of the place, some veggies surrounded what appeared to be an egg omelette with meat. I later found out that the meat was actually crab guts...but...doesn't matter, STILL DELICIOUS! The shells were full of flavors, as you can get a taste of all the the sauce, garlic and onions.      \n\nFor desert, I got the banana flambe. It was my first time ever having it, so I was a bit amused to see it brought out in flames. Though I had nothing to reference on, the taste of it was pretty amazing: sweet but not overwhelming, which was just the perfect desert to a tasty meal.\n\nGreat food, thoughtful presentation, and excellent service; I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner, THANKS!", "author": "Lu H."}

I've definitely had more flavorful Pho, but for the price and convenience it's ok. However, after one successful delivery in the past, it seems they now don't deliver on weekdays. Funny since the last time I got it delivered it was on a Wednesday. They're also terrible at answering the phone and sometimes it's off the hook for the entire evening. Why offer delivery but limit when you do it? Lame. \n\nThe decor inside is pretty odd. There's a huge U shaped monstrosity above half the restaurant and they tend to decorate the place with tacky cheap stuff like Mickey Mouse cut outs and stuffed animals. It cheapens the place.

So I know a thing or two about pho. Even though it seems like this should be common knowledge by now in the diverse and food-centric bay area, I'm still surprised at how many people don't know that pho is not pronounced \"faux\", it's pronounced \"fuh\" like, \"huh\".  \n\nNow that we have that cleared up. Jasmine Garden is awesome. The first time we went there, it was on a random weeknight and the place was doing a ton of takeout business and the person answering the phone was taking orders loudly out in the eating area. Also the crazy mirrored decor and eclectic music choices were kind of off-putting. However, once we tried the food, we were hooked.  Nice fresh spring rolls, cute presentation.  \n\nOn to the pho- it's delicious. I don't always love weird meats, so I always keep it pretty simple with my pho, either chicken or beef. My favorite is actually vegetarian, but most places take a \"if they want vegetarian they probably don't like any flavor whatsoever so let's just pour water over a few steamed broccoli florets and call it good\" approach.  NOT the case here.  The veggie broth was flavorful and delicious, and the bowl was piled sky high with delicious veggies and tofu.  My husband's beef broth was off the hook, and my friend got one of the spicy broths that was also amazing. \n\nAlso, you can get a coconut water drink that comes in the coconut. Don't be put off by the atmosphere, and don't be afraid to ask for the pho menu at dinner time- seems like they only put it out at lunch.", "author": "Kari J."}

However, I must say this is definitely a gem in the city.  Lemon grass pho soup was the best I've ever had!  When I eat pho (or any noodle soup), I like to put lots of ingredients in it.  With this soup, I didn't have to put a dang thing with it.  It was perfect the way it was.  My only regret was that I kinda wish they gave me more though. :) The Carpacio dish was superb.  I couldn't get enough of it.  It is a must!!  The Beef Pho was also excellent.\n\nMy only (small) gripe was that the Calamari was a bit chewy but it was crisply cooked.  It would be nice to have another tangy sauce that comes with it instead of that typical sweet chili sauce, though.  (I may be biased --I'm a sauce girl and love trying new sauces on everything.) \n\nThe restaurant can get a bit humid as it's not a big place, but everything was clean.  Service was phenomenal.

Yeah, it's cheap because the broth is basically bullion-based, and the rest of the ingredients are pretty much out of a box.  \n\nI can only imagine that the folks raving about JG's Pho haven't been to PPQ, or Pho Ao Sen in Oakland, or any of the many other truly amazing Pho places in the Bay Area.  In really good Pho, you can tell how fresh the broth is by the way it smacks your lips together.  The noodles come apart easily and don't clump.  And the meat is fresh and soft.\n\nThat said, the rest of the food we had was pretty good, in particular the crepe and the garlic noodles.  And to be fair, Jasmine Garden doesn't specialize in Pho (in fact it wasn't even on the menu, we asked for it because of all the rave reviews).  So I'm not going to slam it in the rating. \n\nOverall, good option if you're stuck in the Castro.

We kept reading on yelp how good the pho is but we didn't see anything on the menu with pho on it.\n\nAfter we asked the waiter if they had pho, they gave us a separate menu.  Make sure if you want pho, you ask, since they have two different menu's apparently.\n\nWe started with the spring rolls since everyone on yelp said they were so good.  They were a little bland for me and nothing really all that special.\n\nI ended up with seafood pho and my boyfriend got the beef.  The beef was actually really good.  My seafood pho was also really good.  The noodles were very flavorful although not enough and there was nearly not enough seafood in it.  The menu said it was prawns, calamari, scallops and mussels.  All I got were 3 prawns, 3 calamari and 3 TINY scallops.  No mussels.  And for $17, I was expecting a lot of seafood at least.\n\nNone-the-less the pho was good, but left me still hungry.\n\n3 stars because there wasn't enough food and the service sucked!

That is when compared to your average pho place where almost everything is self serve (sauces, silverware, etc.) This place is all about serving you.\n\nThe decor is nice and the staff is very nice as well. We came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm with 12 people. They were able to accommodate us no problem. The menu is smaller than you average pho joint, but still has good dishes. I opted for the Bun Bo Hue and wanted banh pho noodles instead. The owner/boss lady told me that if i wanted. I can get the regular Dac Biet w/ Hue broth.. I was like WOW! So I got that instead. She said that they can do anything we wanted, so though the menu doesn't list much, you can alter your order as you wish. Now, depending on what you order, the waiters will bring you the correct silverware, for example if you ordered pho they bring you the chopsticks and soup spoon. Also instead of giving you a plate of bean sprouts and all that for everyone to share, they bring each person their own bowl of sprouts, basil, jalapenos and lime.\n\nAnyways, for once the Bun Bo Hue broth was actually pretty good north of San Jose. Still it was missing the usual pigs blood and pigs feet but the broth itself was spot on (from my knowledge anyways). With all this great service and good food. My bowl was a mere $7.50!! I expected it to be like $8-$9 but not even. Pretty impressive.\n\nI checked out the dinner menu and they have a lot of dishes that I miss.

Keep in the mind the dinner menu is completely different (more of \"entrees\" rather than the noodles), but you can order from the lunch menu at any time.  Just ask them.\n\nMy favorites:\n\n- Beef carpaccio.  One of my top dishes I've eaten...anywhere.  This is a crazy dish for the $8 they charge for it.  Thin slices of raw beef, topped with chopped mint, chopped cilantro, peanut bits, and fried shallots.  Drizzled with the sweet/sour/salty goodness of fish sauce.   It's probably worthy of a $20 appetizer price at a fancier restaurant.   Order it.\n\n- Lemongrass beef noodle soup.  Slightly spicy and very heavily flavored with lemongrass.  It's really good.\n\n- Beef noodle soup (pho).  Also very, very good.  The broth has nuances in flavors that show that care was given in adding spices/herbs rather than the normal pho broth that most places serve.\n\n- Bahn xeo (Vietnamese crepe).  A crispy, slightly coconutty flavored crepe filled with chicken, shrimp, veggies, bean sprouts, and some beans.  Really delicious.  I've tried it at various places, and this is the only place where the crepe itself is very delicate and not a thick soggy mess.\n\nI don't think you can go wrong with any of their dishes here.  Super friendly service too.", "author": "J M."}

It is way better than Sunflower, Zadin, or Bodhi for Pho and closer than driving out to PPQ or Kevin's.\n\n There are 2 main types of Viet places in my book: those that do Pho well and those that do everything else well. I can't speak to the rest of the menu here and I only ever get takeout, but...\n\n+ Jasmine Chicken Pho is perfect. None of that nasty processed white chicken or funky gristly stuff...just the good stuff here. Flavorful broth, noodles done right, generous amounts of basil + toppings.\n+ BBQ pork salad rolls are fantastic.\n+ Shrimp salad rolls are fresh, flavorful, and extremely well rolled.\n\nPeter is a sweetheart and works way too much.

But I mean, the guy literally just took our order, so how could he forget? \n\nAnd then we proceeded to wait for almost 25 minutes to get our food, but it was staggered so weirdly so that my friend got his food way before mine. And I ordered #15 which was some house special something-or-other, I don't remember because it was so forgettable. But I specifically asked \"Do not make it spicy. No pepper flakes or anything\" And much to my annoyance, I get the food with tons of pepper...WTH guys? I ended up barely eating any of it because I have a super low spice tolerance, and the food just had too much of their sauce and the seafood in it (the muscles especially) looked really weird. Some of them were normal colored, but some looked older and weird and orange? \n\nIf this place tickles your fancy, then go for it, my friend's dish looked really good, but mine sucked.

Good food, good portion, good price.\n\nAnd last, but not least, the appetizers here are GREAT.

I gave him the following three options:\n\n-Sushi Time\n-Jasmine Garden\n-Kasa\n\n(Clearly I was in a south and east Asian mood upon my Yelp reading)\n\nDue to the avalanche-like weather, we chose the Vietnamese place because a huge bowl of pho sounded amazing at the time. Although we were already at Church & Market, we had to cross 15 intersections to get to the part where Jasmine is located (directly across/in front of the 37 bus stop). We walked in and grabbed a seat against the wall with the windows.\n\nThe decor is interesting. I hate using the word 'interesting' because, as my friend Peter likes to remind me, it means \"less than expected.\" But yes, interesting suits Jasmine Garden. There's a random white cupboard-like thing that surrounds the top of the restaurant and it feels like it should have doors that open up... but it doesn't. They were playing some random new-age music but showing a video of these REALLY INTENSE female violinists. What I saw and what I heard was very clashy-clashy. \n\nWhen it came to ordering, I wanted a vermicelli bowl. I *thought* I ordered one. It had lemongrass beef and the description said \"noodles, beansprouts....\" and everything else that normally comes with a V-bowl. Soon as I ordered, the server asked \"do you want rice with that?\" \n\nMe: \"Uhhh...no thanks\" (wondering why this man wants to carb me up)\nServer: \"Um, are you sure?\"\nMe: \"Yes\"\nServer: \"You should probably get rice\"\nMe: (taking out the menu and pointing to what I wanted) Isn't this what I ordered?\nServer: Yes... but I think you need rice\nMe: Fine... I'll get some rice\n\nTen minutes go by and our food comes out. What do I have? A plate of beef and veggies and a side of rice. I SWEAR I ordered a V-bowl. I mean, I even pointed at it. So how did I end up with this? And why am I giving this place 3 stars? Because the food was pretty good. Sure I had my heart and freezing limbs set on one thing, but you can't help an honest mistake (on their part... I refuse to accept blame... it's a Taurus thing). \n\nThe moral of the story? If you're in the mood for pho, but secretly want something else, come here and order the pho and enjoy whatever you get.", "author": "Jared S."}

First off on the menu! There aren't many places around that serve those many types of dishes and still have it tastes so good. Of course everyone has their own taste buds and a taste for different types of foods so reading the negative reviews didn't make me doubt the restaurant. I had to try it for myself and I suggest the same for everyone. \n\nSecond: When you return, I suggest you try different dishes. I definitely enjoyed the many different dishes that I have tasted for the past 6 times I have been there. Dancing Beef, Sea Bass, Garlic Noodles, Pho, Appetizers, etc...

I've found a new dinner dish that I LOVE and it is the Grilled Rack of Lamb - Cuu Nuong).  I've also tried the Dancing Beef - Bo Luc Lac and the Garlic Noodles - Mi Toi.  If you like fish, you should try the Salt and Pepper Sea Bass.  For appetizers, my favorites are the calimari, the Imperial Rolls and the BEEF CARPACCIO (very fresh and well spiced).  On Saturday, I tried the Hue Noodle Soup...delish...  Also, there is a chicken stock soup that they have here that IS TO DIE FOR.  \n\nI remember going on a Friday evening and there was quite a crowd.

I realize that I am a hard critic when it comes to Vietnamese food given the fact that I grew up in Southern California - in the heart of Little Saigon - eating Vietnamese food every single day.  Of course everything fails in comparison to the home-cooked meals that I get when I'm home-home, so although I expect quality/authentic food, I do leave some wiggle room.\n\nWith that said, I've been on the hunt for good/decent Vietnamese food in San Francisco.  I was craving the claypot catfish and the hot and sour soup also with catfish, but our waiter said they were all out!  What the heck???  No more catfish??  Ok, I'll be flexible and try something else.  Italian boy and I ended up ordering fresh spring rolls, hot and sour soup with shrimp and the lemongrass chicken.\n\nfresh spring rolls ($6.50) - it comes with two spring rolls cut in half, so you get 4 pieces.  Overpriced for two spring rolls if you ask me!  It met the spring roll standards in terms of taste/quality, so fine I will pay more for spring rolls given this is San Francisco.\n\nhot and sour soup with shrimp - it was yummy, but a tad too sweet.  this soup generally isn't supposed to be that sweet.  the shrimp was nice and plump and juicy.  lots of bean sprouts, couple of pieces of pineapple and tomatoes, etc.\n\nlemongrass chicken - too sweet and overcooked.  i'd pass on this dish if I were you.\n\nMy general impression of this place is that it's not the typical Vietnamese restaurant in terms of presentation.  I give them extra points for trying to make Vietnamese food look classy.  However, the amount of time it took our food to come out was subpar.  Spring rolls came out rather quickly then came the soup then it took foreeeeeeever for the last dish to come out.  I was full off of soup by the time our main entree came out.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be a repeat customer.  The hunt continues...", "author": "Lynda N."}

Turns out, it is on the lunch menu, which you can still request during dinner time if that is what you want.  Good to know.\n\nI ordered the Hue noodle soup (Bun Bo Hue), which is somewhat of a risk, but I hadn't had it in a really long time.  Plus my past experiences here (with their sour soup and claypot catfish -- both extremely authentic) gave me more faith.  But I really should've ordered something else.  The Hue noodle soup here is basically just their pho in a different broth (that has way too much lemongrass in it btw).  The noodles are the wrong type and it just has the regular pho meat, not the stuff that should be in bun bo hue.  Alas.\n\nI took 1 star away, but I will still come back to this place because the other food I've had here has been quite good.

I am a loyal PPQ fan since i've been a patron there for over 10 years but after trying Jasmin Garden....PPQ is now 2nd on my list. *gasp*\n\nFirst of all Jasmin Garden is really clean. They have glass tops over their white table cloth and individual place settings. I don't even wipe down my utensils, plate, or cup (like i usually do at other asian restaraunts).  The two times I've been here, i never had to wait. It's usually not busy which is the strange thing for being such a great restaraunt.\n\nJasmin Garden is not a noodle house or strictly Pho restaurant. They are a vietnamese restaraunt so most of their items are entrees that you can share family style. However, their lunch menu has a small section for noodle soup and this where my obsession with their beef pho began.\n\nService is excellent. The lady (owner? maitre d? hostess?) is really sweet. I see her mingling with other customers and really chatting them up, recommending good dishes. The customers seem to really like her. The waiter is swift and refills my water often. He is friendly but usually  a man of few words. \n\nThe two times my husband I and have been here we were the only Asian patrons. Just something I noticed but it didn't bother us nor did we receive any lesser service.  \n\nTwo dishes you must have: the beef Pho and Imperial Rolls. I cannot rave enough about both. They are absolutely delicious.  I even drink the soup after I finish my noodles. A first for me since i'm paranoid about polluting my body with msg. \n\nThey also have garlic noodle. It's pretty good but you can really taste the butter. The five spice chicken is good but not amazing. They also have this spicy noodle soup that my husband tried but I still think the Pho is better.\n\nPrice is cheap/moderate. I think my pho was like $7 and the imperial rolls were $6.\n\nJust come for the beef Pho and the imperial rolls. You won't regret it.", "author": "Terry D."}

Better than having to wait, but it made the place pretty uncomfortable (and cold). We had the full attention of the waiter and the service was fine, although they refilled our water after every other sip, which I found unnecessary and annoying. Also, despite being the only guests at the time, our entrees were served 10 minutes apart.\n\nFood: We got spring rolls, the lemongrass beef and the five spice chicken. The entrees were meat-heavy and disappointing. Both came with only a minimal amount of vegetables (like, 4 green beans, 3 mushroom halves). Portions were on the smaller side, and for the quality of the food I felt the place was too expensive (we ended up with a $30 bill without drinks).\n\nI can't judge how \"authentic\" the food was, since I don't have much experience with Vietnamese. No pho on the dinner menu - maybe it's more of a lunch thing?\n\nI won't be coming back. The food certainly did't deserve the 4 Yelp stars we came for.", "author": "Carter D."}

From where we sat, I can see the kitchen which appears bright and clean.\n\nWe enjoyed the pork spring rolls, noodle soups, and especially the Flaming Bowl I tried this evening.  When the dish arrived, it had light blue flames going off from the bottom of the bowl and our waiter used a pair of super long chopsticks to stir partially cooked pork, onion, shrimps and tomato together in front of us.  It's obviously for show but it was quite interesting.  You are given 10 rice papers in stackable individual plates and lettuce, basil, mint, and other greens to make your own wrap.

Super tasty broth, fresh vegetables, and yummy fried tofu (amongst other bits of veggie goodness). Not only that, for $7, it is easily enough to feed me for at least two meals. \n\nI would also feel remiss if I didn't point out the fact that the \"lady of the house\" is one of the sweetest, friendliest people I have ever come across. She's always very attentive and happy and once let me order delivery below the minimum because they weren't very busy at the time. She is obviously really invested in the restaurant and I love that!\n\nSo what have I had? There's the garlic noodles, which are delicious fresh and hot out of the kitchen, but not so great for delivery because they tend to get gooey and stick together if not super fresh. Then the lemongrass beef w/ Vermicelli noodles for lunch--freakin' phenomenal! Also can't leave out the lemongrass tofu dinner (no noodles in the dinner entree)...very, very good. And I love that for the veggie version of things, you can choose between tofu and fake chicken (or is it duck) and I think maybe one other thing? Oh, and they will not fry the tofu if you specify it, which I think I will next time I get the pho. \n\nDamnit, now I am craving Vietnamese at 10 in the morning!", "author": "Jasmine F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-08", "description": "On a recent visit to San Fran, our wonderful foodie friend took us here for dinner. It was hard not to immediately love the salad rolls with shrimp, lettuce, carrots and rice noodles wrapped in rice paper, especially because they came beautifully (and creatively) presented in two little hanging baskets balanced on a miniature stand. The rolls were also extremely fresh and came with a delicious peanut sauce, and so they were a winner in our books. Our other favourite dish was the glass noodles with garlic, veggies and other assorted goodies. Absolutely delicious! The shrimp and papaya salad with a large assortment of shredded veggies in a light vinaigrette was also very refreshing and delicious. The only dish we didn't care for was the lemon chicken. I think we were hoping it would be skinless chicken breast in the lemon sauce, perhaps with other veggies, but the chicken came with the skin left on, which was unfortunately quite tough and chewy, so the dish was difficult to eat and not very enjoyable. However my friend and I enjoyed the glass noodles and salad rolls so much that we returned for dinner a second time during our stay. On that visit we tried another chicken dish which was very tasty.\n\nOverall, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is casual and comfortable, and the service is fast. We had to repeat a few instructions and questions to our server because of a language barrier, but overall the service was good. Also the TV was showing videos of traditional Vietnamese food being prepared, which I thought was neat. Definitely worth a return visit next time I'm in San Fran.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

Service is quick, albeit it seems that they focus so much on quickness that they seem to forget some other key points such as providing a welcoming environment. But other than that, they seemed to really know their way around running a restaurant pretty smoothly.\n\nOnto the menu and food, the selection was decent; nothing too special that you wouldn't be able to find elsewhere with minor modifications. I was kind of disappointed that there weren't any pho selections for dinner; only lunch. In fact, most of their menu, lunch and dinner, was comprised mostly of Chinese style dishes. I guess the part of it that would be Vietnamese would be the choice of ingredients, but even then it was mainly Chinese. Even the name of the restaurant suggests so. Anyway, I ordered the lemongrass beef. Apparently rice doesn't come with it; it's an additional $1 charge. The portion size was perfect for your appetite, average for your wallet. Other items also seemed fairly reasonable for the price, but again nothing too special. Flavor-wise, something seemed off. Perhaps the peppers were a bit overpowering when accompanied with the lemongrass? It wasn't bad, just average. Appearance was Chinese style. Rice came in a dim sum basket, while the beef came on a wok on a plate. Texture, the beef was okay. Not chewy, but not entirely soft. The beans came off a bit crunchy and didn't seem to fit the dish so well. Overall, my experience was slightly above average, only because of the swift service. \n\nMenu: 7/10\nFood: 7/10\nEnvironment: 7.5/10\nService: 9/10\nOverall: 7.5/10", "author": "Darren H."}

A secret menu with lower priced items?  Maybe I'm just paranoid and it's a lunch menu, who knows?  Either way, I just ordered the pho and a shrimp garlic noodles.  Wow, the pho was great and the shrimp garlic noodles were super delish as well (even though I could literally taste the butter that had been soaked into the noodles).  The waiter was great.

The Bun Bo Hue is delicious and full of flavor, and what a beautiful color! It definitely has its own kick to it but the waitstaff there are more than willing to give you extra peppers if you so desire.\n\nIf you only want to give Pho a chance, I recommend that too. They let the meat cook from the heat of the broth right in front of you, which is exactly how Pho is supposed to be served. And the broth there is so amazing I can drink the whole thing! I like the Pho here even better than most of the places in Little Saigon. That's why this place is a gem!\n\nFor appetizers, I always get the Crunchy Roll. It's not on the menu, but the waitress suggested it to us one day. It's your traditional spring roll with nuoc mam sauce, but instead of shrimp they give you pork, and they also put little peanuts around the outside that stick to the rice paper. It is simply delicious, and the nuoc mam sauce is awesome. \n\nAnother thing about this place is that they serve everything in such an appetizing way. Like order the Crunchy Roll and they serve it to you in a martini glass with shredded carrots. And the water they serve you has lemon and mint leaves floating in the pitcher.\n\nThey have lots of other traditional meals that remind me of my mother's home cooking, Banh Xeo, Catfish cooked in a clay pot, Chinese sausages cooked in a clay pot (OMG So good!), and Sweet and Sour Soup with Pineapple and Catfish. heaven...drool...\n\nSo, if you're looking for Vietnamese, this is definitely the place to try.

Nice!\n\ni read so many reviews and they raved about the delicious pho. Being in the Mission, you don't have many choices if you're craving that tasty beefy broth and noodles with thin slices of meat. I can't stand sweet broth at Sunflower, so I decided to try this place. 4.5 overall rating...must be good right?\n\nWRONG. IT'S LIKE A $7.33 BOWL OF MSG WATER.

If these are large portions for people, then they haven't gone to a real pho joint such as Pho Kim Long in San Jose. Now THAT'S a large portion--where there's so much soup, noodles, and meat that you can't finish any of them. Maybe all the meat, but then you're left completely stuffed with leftover noodles and soup. Or if you eat all the noodles, you're left with leftover meat and soup. Or if you eat all the soup, you're left with leftover meat and noodles.\n\nI got the beef pho. The meat is decent, but not the best I've had. It was nice to get ONE whole meatball (sliced in half to make you feel like you're special and you get two pieces of meatball)...I guess that was very generous. The noodles are fine. The broth has okay flavor, but it is definitely too MSGed. TOO TOO TOO TOO MSGed. One scoop of soup and I knew already that I would be dying of thirst and regretting drinking all that soup.\n\nI finished the whole bowl, and as anticipated, I regretted it. I know what you think: Why did you eat the whole thing if you knew you would be dying of thirst right after? I can't help it. I'm a pho monster.

The two times that I've been here, the soup has been lazy in flavor.  What I mean by this is that the flavor just doesn't go the extra mile.  It's mediocre at best and the ingredients seem bare minimum.  \n\nThe first time we went here, I ordered pho and it didn't have tripe or tendon, or beef brisket, nor did they have dandelion greens in the vegetable selection that usually accompanies the pho.  It's hard to ding them on this, since I'm sure the tripe and tendon issue is more of a \"catering to the white man's palate\" thing.  But for me, that's what makes a 5-star aunthentic bowl of pho.\n\nThe second time I was there, I had bun bo hue, and it seemed like they just took the pho, and threw in some store-bought lemongrass paste and substituted the pho noodles for bun noodles and changed the name.  My mouth was covered in orange chili grease after the meal.  It was kind of disappointing, especially considering the day before, I had the exact same meal at Mangosteen and it was delicious.\n\nThe sad thing is that I REALLY want to like this place, given it's location and the fact that the service is always super nice.\n\nEveryone seems to give this place a good review based on other dishes so maybe I'll need to try it again, but no noodle soup.  I'm willing to give this place one more shot, but for now, two stars is my rating based on my experience so far...  Third time's the charm???", "author": "Phillip H."}

I caught a cold and needed a day in bed, but I could rent my cupboards out for storage space at this point, they're so bare. I have a few favorite restaurants who deliver in my neighborhood, but I wanted something different than my usual go-to's, and figured Yelp would provide my new lunchtime delivery options. \n\nNoticing that everyone seemed to rave about 2 dishes - the dancing beef and the garlic noodles - I just had to go for it and try them both. I got 2 side orders of the garlic noodles so I could give some to my boyfriend later (he gets upset when I eat good Vietnamese without him), but I ended up eating it myself for dinner.\n\nThe beef was tender and sweet, and even presented well for food that came in a box. The noodles had those beautiful sear-lines indicative of pan-frying and roasted aromatic garlic bits that practically melted in my mouth.

So when I judge a Vietnamese restaurant, I'm judging the Bun. \n\nThe Bun at Jasmine Garden is pretty damn good. It'd be better if the noodles were a little less sticky and not so clumped together and there were more fresh vegetables and mint leaves piled at the top, but I must say the BBQ pork makes up for it because it is outstanding. Tender, juicy, clean, and full of BBQ flavor, I could eat their pork every day. The crispy spring rolls are also delicious. The combination of crispy, doughy, meaty, and leafy textures together in one bowl is delightful. \n\nThe service is fast, but perhaps a bit too fast. Every time my friend paused from her Pho, one of the waiters tried to take her bowl away. \n\nJasmine Garden is definitely worth going to, but I'm still looking for the best place in the city to find the perfect Bun.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-27", "description": "Jasmine Garden is a superb hole in the wall vietnamese restaurant focused on authentic vietnamese food with a mild bent towards chinese cooking styles. \n\nPho - For Jasmine Garden, this standard vietnamese dish is a walk in the park. For the diner, this is an excellent dish. The broth is complex and negotiates well between the salty, sweet, and lightness of a good broth. The noodles are a bit starchier than I was expecting, but not a big deal. The meat was excellent and the condiments were fresh. Really, the broth carried this plate.\n\nBun - The BBQ Pork bun is really where this restaurant shines. Traditional vietnamese executions emphasize the fish sauce heavily and as a chinese person, I find the result a little challenging on the nose. In Jasmine Gardens' rendition, the mix of the flavors very clearly have a chinese bent, which to me, optimizes for my palate. I'll take it.\n\nCrunch Roll - This invention should definitely be tried. Jasmine Garden takes a spring roll and wraps that inside a freshroll. The inventors of the turducken were quite proud. \n\nAn important final point to make is how sweet Kelly (the owner) is. She really goes out of her way to make your dining experience excellent. She is passionate about her food.", "author": "Andrew H."}

It's a completely new place with new menu, new staff, and new owners. The dishes are tasty and generously sized. At an average of 7 or 8 bucks each, they're competitively priced. The staff is extremely nice and accommodating, as other reviewers have noticed.\n\nSome noteworthy dishes: \n\n- the spring rolls: fresh, flavored with mint, classic. Healthy and delicious. And not the tiny wieners you get a Sunflower in the Mission either.\n\n- catfish claypot: the caramel sauce is out of this world in terms of flavor. The catfish morsels are tender and delicious. I've tried the chicken claypot and it's also as good. The veggie option is ok but not as good as the catfish\n\n- basil chicken/tofu: one of the better sauces in this category. Better balanced than similar dish at Thai Corner express nearby. Less overpowering than similar dish at Red Jade nearby.\n\nIf you're looking for a change of pace from Thai and Chinese, which are everywhere in the Castro/Duboce area, definitely check out Jasmine Garden. \n\nAn excellent new addition to the neighborhood.", "author": "Patrick S."}

(zero stars)\n- garlic noodles were some kind odd concoction of stuff you might be left with after making scrambled eggs and sauteing soggy noodles in the same pan, and then slathering on some 'buttery' flavored oil or margarine.  had an odd synthetic taste along with the garlic.  ick!!!!  (zero stars)\n- chicken in basil chicken was dry like left-over, re-microwaved chicken breast bits.  Not much basil and the sauce was just average. (zero stars)\n- they called my cell phone twice around 9:45pm to track down the information on the receipt that the driver had accidentally left with our order.

The spring roll and imperial rolls also taste like home for me. The fish sauce was just right, I love Vietnamese food, so this was good to me, especially when it taste like real Vietnamese food with no \"cheap\" ingredients. They're all fresh. The beef carpaccio was soo tasty, the was thin and fresh, didn't taste like those already cut beef that's sold at the markets, it came with a lot of cilantro =) made me a happy girl. The garlic noodles...oh man IT'S A MUST TRY HERE.....soooooo good....I love garlic and this was really garlic-y.....This was also my first time having the salmon spring roll and surprisingly it was pretty good...I like it...All the side salads were fresh. As for the seared salmon salad, it was created on the spot by the chef, pretty good to be a new dish from him, now you can tell he's a great chef if he's just putting stuff together and it taste great.

I have been to this restaurant twice and I haven't even tried their pho. Maybe it's because I come here to eat other Vietnamese foods, like Ca Kho and Canh Chua, I don't really think about the ordinary fare like pho as much. But seriously, this is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The waiters here are super nice, the owner is fun to talk to, and actually one of the chefs explained to me the basics of how some of the dishes are made when I asked. The ambiance here is nice and the plating is much better than most Vietnamese restaurants. Also, for the price, this place is a great deal. Oh and the dishes don't take long to come out! The inside of the restaurant is much nicer than one would expect from the outside, but warning! this place is very busy, so if you know you're gonna have a group, make reservations beforehand! Also, it's really hard to find parking, so be prepared to park a bit farther or just take the bus. Anyways, the food here is all awesome! I definitely recommend the quail, the lamb, and my favorite: the Ca Kho (catfish claypot). But I really recommend that people go out of their comfort zone. I know that most of the customers are not Vietnamese, so they generally gravitate towards what they know (PHO), but that is not the extent of Vietnamese food.

The service here is great for the simple reason they great you quick and are very friendly, they always thank me and shake my hand when I leave, and why would you want to rush when you can watch the amazing food markets of Vietnam playing on the TV?  The pork in the Bun is some of the best I have ever had, and the Pho Ga, is simply amazing, they do everything right, and really if you like fast service then just go somewhere, where all you are is money in the pocket and no one cares about you.

Everything we ate was incredibly good. The chicken pho was awesome. Somebody else on Yelp was complaining about MSG. While I am not positive the pho had MSG in it-- it didn't taste like it to me-- MSG, people, is god's gift to your taste buds, and the pho is, as well.\n\nWe also ordered calamari and shrimp claypot, which was also yum if a bit oily. The Vietnamese crepe was delicious. The papaya salad was good by itself by I preferred it with a dose of the sweet chili sauce they provide.\n\nTo top it off, THEY DELIVER, and the staff is very friendly. And I mean this in the nicest of ways: the woman who took our order over the phone spoke excellent English and I didn't have to spell anything at all, which I often find to be a problem when ordering. She was on it.\n\nDon't hesitate to eat here. It's great.", "author": "Nick H."}

I was too lazy to make food and was in the mood from some Pho so I Yelp'd Vietnamese restaurants on my iPhone and saw one across the street.  It was around 7 PM.\n\nWhen we went in, there wasn't a lot of people--it was a Tuesday--so the waiter sat us down and gave us his undivided attention.  I could tell from the decor of the place that the service was going to be good.  The waiter handed us the dinner menu but I didn't see any Pho so I was given the lunch menu and left alone to decide.  When the waiter came back, he poured our tea for us and I got the Pho Dac Biet and my girlfriend go the Pho Gai.  \n\nAnyone who knows me knows I always order the Pho Gai, but this time something in me wanted to go old school.  I remember my buddy in high school once took me to this Pho place on our lunch hour where I had Pho for the first time.  The Sriracha, the Hoisin, the bean sprouts, the Basil--I've never had soup I could customize like this before and I've been loving it ever since.  It was an enlightening experience.  Where am I?  Sorry.  Anyways, the Pho Dac Biet here is fantastic, just like I remembered it.  \n\nThe Pho Gai was prepared the way I've seen it in other Pho restaurants where the chicken was in strips verses cut up in pieces with the skin still on it.  I'm not sure if it's an northern or southern Vietnamese thing, but I usually ask about the chicken before ordering Pho Gai because I'm a fan of the pieces verses the strips.\n\nAfter the Pho, we ordered fried banana with coconut ice cream and this was fantastic.  It was a great way to end the meal and all this for under 35 bucks.\n\nI'll be back.", "author": "Steve Y."}

(quick tip #1)  all you had to do was ask!  what happened to customer service?  i asked if i can pay for the food, old dude snaps and says \"no! later. too confusing\".  wtf?  you don't want my money?  this turns out to be a blessing.  will go back to this in a bit.  moving on...\n\nman friend and i waited inside for bit admiring the awesome decor/lighting, watched several tables who arrived after us get seated, watched more people come in and order take out...we went out to smoke...you know just killing time while waiting for our food.  im thinking, \"man, this place must be good.  we can't wait to eat!\"  i mean, that's why people go to restaurants right??

I find myself often reluctantly lurching over to Sunflower for my pho fix, and leaving later feeling only... marginally satisfied, perhaps even a bit guilty, but full enough to be quelled until my next pho attack.\nEnter Jasmine Garden. Chow and Home are my usual go-to places when my parents are in town, but a few days ago they would just not have it. Tired of Western pasta and salad options, they wanted something delicious, soupy, and... well, Asian. I informed them sadly that, although the Mission was filled with all sorts of ethnic goodies, they strongly lacked in the Vietnamese and Chinese department. They sighed, seemed to give up, and we were on our way once again to Home when... what's this little street behind Home? Have passed by Jasmine probably a thousand times but in our desperation for something else we took one look at the menu, the prices, and the waft of lemongrass and thought, this is it.\nThe $6.75 bun bo hue was so satisfying--this is what I've been looking for in the Mission!!! This may be as or less authentic than Sunflower (Jasmine may be a hidden gem, but it's not the hole in the wall you would expect, a strangely classier place; on a more technical review of the dish, the bun was much thinner than normally used, they had no blood cubes or pieces of ham, but I actually prefer it that way), but damn is it good, hyphenated American or not! Spicy, fragrant, and super hot, it was just what I had dreamed of, plus a little more. Dad got the satay noodles, also excellent albeit not really traditional and a tad sweeter than expected, but still good. Mom went for the regular pho, and although the meat was a little less and not as delicately cut as its done in some of our favorite San Jose Vietnamese haunts, it was still quite good--that broth, most excellent!\nSunflower, good bye.

A lot of people kept asking about 'Will's, since this is the previous location. I don't really have anything bad to say about the food-cause it was delicious.\n\nNow, I love divey, dicey, cheap Vietnamese restaurants. Saigon Sandwich, PPQ and the random place at Taravel and 19th have my love for $3.50 bahn mi, $5.50 pho and for having 4 star delicious food at 1.5 star prices. They also have curry noodle stew...mmmm...curry. \n\nJasmine is more along the vein of Slanted Door; trying to be more upscale with pretty traditionally cooked dishes. We had the chicken shrimp crepe; a crisply fried coconut milk, rice flour, eggy pancake stuffed with meat, bean sprouts and served with fresh herbs, red leaf lettuce and nuoc cham. This was sooo good. The crepe was perfect and they gave us a ton of basil, mint, rau ram, lettuce and some shredded carrots. Reasonably priced at $7.50 and big enough for a meal. \nWe also had the caramel claypot chicken (which is charmingly called chicken 'nuggets' on the menu) which came with a steamy hot sauce that included; basil, garlic, dried chili peppers and onions. The chicken ended up being sliced breast meat. We also got a huge steamer of jasmine rice. Yay for Asians. \nFried bananas are the 'lumpia' version, wrapped with coconut shreds in eggroll wrappers and fried-but it's also the largest serving of ice cream we've ever gotten. Total bill was around $30 for two. \n\nSo the food is great, the service is totally attentive, polite and professional (I brought my coffee cup in and they didn't give me shit about it), what's my beef? The HUGE tv mounted in the upper front wall of the business playing Vietnamese karaoke videos. While it can actually turn into a conversation piece, (\"What are they doing? Ooh, she's MARRIED!\" or \"Wow, that sucks, her parents are totally trying to matchmake her with that OTHER guy in front of her boyfriend.\" or \"Sepia tone means they're in love.\"), it's pretty distracting. The neon lit specials menu is also sort of funky. It's a VERY minimal critique. I'm sorry for people that love this place; except for the tv, Jasmine Garden was pretty romantic. \n\nI'd go back to try the other dishes ($3.50 for garlic noodles? score) that people have recommended, but not before I hit up my ghettofabulous spots for curry beef pho.", "author": "Alexis W."}

The cha gio is served traditionally with vermicelli noodles, pickeled veggies, and lettuce to wrap.  $6.50 is a bit pricey, but I've paid the same or more and was not nearly as satisfied.  Overall a good dish.  The banh xeo was also as close to traditional as I've had in Vietnam. Was crispy and had a lot of flavor.  The only complaint was that the chicken was a little dry.  Moving on to the entrees.  We got the Pho Ga and Papaya salad.  Both pretty good.  The papaya salad with shrimp was excellent with the pho ga being tasty but not 100% traditional.  It was served with shredded chicken not sliced.  Looks like more chicken w/o being so.  The broth just didnt have the tradtional pho taste of star anise,cinnamon, and cardamon. None the less tasty.  On another occasion we got the garlic noodles.  Very good and def worth the $3.50.  Pass on the garlic butter fried rice at $3.00.  Not worth it even at that price.  I absolutely love vietnamese food and have found this place to be one of the better restaurants in the city.   Looking forward on tasting some more of their food in the near future.", "author": "K B."}

Since we had about 40-50 guests, David & Kelly offered to shut down their restaurant just for us!  They were so helpful and kind throughout the whole planning process & even put up some decorations for us!  All of the food was delicious!!!  They were so generous with everything that even after all of our guests filled themselves up, everyone was able to pack up their very own to go boxes!  Our guests were so impressed with the food & the presentation!  We couldn't have been more pleased ourselves.  At the end of it all, we were also very pleased with the bill; extremely reasonable for the quality & quantity we received.  They even brought in extra staff to make sure the event ran smoothly.  Whether going to Jasmine Garden for a romantic date, a small dinner gathering with friends or a large event like ours, you'd be pleased all around, from the food to the ambiance to the service and the prices.  Thank you so much for everything David & Kelly!!!", "author": "Elizabeth L."}

I had a Mi Xao Don Hai San, which was surprisingly very well seasoned--not too salty and the consistency of the sauce was a happy medium between thick and runny.   The scallops were perfectly cooked, though the squid was overdone.  The presentation was also very impressive.  My friend had the Mi Toi Tom and I must admit that I had a hard time stomaching this.  The noodles were overcooked and soggy, while the shrimp was too dry.  Eating this left not only an unpleasant garlic taste in my mouth, but a queasy feeling in my stomach.  It appears the chef haphazardly threw together noodles, some garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, and shrimp to cook and serve.  The wait staff was very slow at seating us, even though no one was there, and was quick to usher us out.  I'll have to come here on a better day to try another dish, but until then, only three stars.", "author": "Ben T."}

So my gay lover and I decided to hit up some pho and watch Grandma's Boy while snuggling under his brand new leopard print snuggie. If that's not the gayest thing you've ever heard, then i don't know what is ;) Anyhoo, I had the chicken pho and he had the veggie. Mine was absolutely excellent and he seemed just as delighted as peach pie with his! Be sure to add Sriracha sauce, good for the sinuses and good for the soul... probably not so good for ulcers, so know your ailments. I believe he ordered the Imperial Rolls (I'm not positive on the name), they had lettuce, some weird brown stuff and were wrapped in a \"soft\" rice paper wrapper of sorts. I put \"soft\" in quotes because, well, everything was just really chewy and tough and it had like no flava... even with the dippins... I haven't tried anything else yet, but am looking forward to it. If you have a hankerin for pho though, don't hesitate to get your pho-king ass to Jasmine Garden!!", "author": "Amanda S."}

Besides the food being at its best, the service couldn't be any better!!  First, the waiter greets you with a smile and then here comes his sister Kelly, the owner, the star of the show!  She's so full of personality & makes sure that you're comfortable & satisfied during your dining experience at their restaurant.  Behind the scene, from the kitchen, comes various aromas of sauces & spices of dishes off the menu that are prepared by the hands of Kelly & her husband.  Makes you want to join the other tables that are eating while waiting for your food to arrive. The saying \"your eyes are bigger than your stomach\" was written for me!  It never fails, I want to order everything on the menu.....and almost get away with it. One time, I was by myself & was craving roasted crab (which is to die for)......but then looked at the menu and the steamed sea bass was jumping all over the menu......and of course none of it can be eaten without the garlic noodles and a vegetable dish.  It was almost embarrassing as each dish was brought out & all the other tables with 2 or more people were starring at me sitting by myself.  I couldn't even act like I was waiting on anyone else.  Needless to say, I ate good the rest of the week on that order alone.

We started with fresh rolls, which were exceedingly fresh. The rice paper was toothsome but soft at the same time. Didn't taste like the rolls were made ahead. The lettuce and herbs in the roll were crisp and aromatic. The Bun Bo Hue was very fragrant and flavorful; however, not the best I've had. They do not use the traditional thicker rice noodle; instead, they used vermicelli. It's just not the same. My friend had the Seafood Chow Fun which looked and smelled very good. I had a bite and noticed that the seafood was not the freshest. The service was very good. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.", "author": "J W."}

I think this may be the fourth incarnation in the last eight years.  So Jasmine Garden has this legacy going against it.  Other detracting factors: tacky mirrored walls, huge flat screen TV in the dining area, and a fairly unwelcoming location sandwiched between George's Liquors and a crappy Chinese buffet (god knows why that place has survived!)  What might save this joint from a similar fate to the other mediocre Asian fare that's come and gone are the exceptionally friendly service and the solid (though not stellar) food.  The spring rolls are pretty excellent; the lemon grass chicken, fresh and tasty; and the pho, served with rare beef, flank steak, and beef balls, had some of the most flavorful broth I've come across in a while.  On the other hand, the spicy lemongrass pho, served only with rare beef, was on the acrid and oily side.  I'd say this place, while still tacky and unglamorous, is well worth a try.", "author": "bree z."}
