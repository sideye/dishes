When we moved to the sunset, I didn't think we'd be so close to one of those, until we found Gene's! Gene's is even better, in my opinion.\n\nBut yeah, I assume the guy who's always there is Gene, and you watch him make your sandwich. It seems like a lot of people who go there are regulars. Gene is friendly but not at all annoying or overbearing.\n\nThe sandwiches are HUGE, the bread is nice, and there are all the fixins for subs without being really expensive. Also, as a side note, I asked for extra cheese on my sandwich and Gene(?) is one of the only people I've ever ordered a sandwich from who actually puts EXTRA cheese and not just one little half slice on a gigantic sub. The secret sauce is also really good--it's like an Italian dressing but seems to me like it's more suited for a sub than a salad since it didn't make the sub overly soggy or weird. My boyfriend usually gets the atomic sub, and it's great for people who love meat.\n\nSo excited to have found my new go-to convenience store/sandwich place!", "author": "Claire C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-15", "description": "This sandwich does NOT follow the Little Lucca / Roxie's sandwich formula consisting of a hearty helping of meat (and everything else) on Dutch crunch bread. The amount of meat is seriously underwhelming, however the rest of the sandwich comes together very nicely. I'm usually a fan of cold sandwiches, a la hero subs of NYC, and this sandwich reminds me of just that (soft roll, oil / vinegar), only heavily toasted.\n\nThe picture below shows an atomic sub, made of three meats. There are 1-2 slices of each meat, making the meat flavor simply a complement of other flavors in the sandwich, rather than the focal point. For the price, this felt like a scam. But, the sandwich does set itself out from the rest due to it's unique flavor, which is heavily driven by oil / vinegar, mayo, and onions. Skip this sandwich if you don't like these profiles, or if you don't enjoy heavily toasted, flaky bread. Ordering these cold is just not worth it.\n\nHomeboy behind the counter is super cool, and I whole heartedly recommend giving him your business. Times are tough, rent is high, so I'm not trippin' too hard about a couple slices of deli meat.", "author": "Douglas Y."}

I've been meaning to write my gratitude for a while. The folks behind the counter have worked very hard throughout the years, and I have grown to consider them as part of my neighborhood family. Gene's sandwiches still have the same amazing taste since my first visit - the secret sauce promises a satisfying sour tangy kick. \n\nOf course, being a corner store, they carry a nice variety of snacks, ice cream, sodas, wine, beer, heavier liquors, canned foods, cooking ingredients, and a few essential items by the window. They also are selling Gene's Liquor merchandise now! I've bought a t-shirt myself! \n\nIf you're around the area, do pay Gene's a visit for an excellent sandwich experience. If you really want to treat yourself, I highly recommend the Atomic Sub (turkey, pastrami, corned beef) with added avocado, jalapenos, two strips of bacon, and extra cheese (please).

On Saturday, I found myself back in the neighborhood and decided to grab a sandwich and see if the magic was still there. It was!! The Gene's experience was just as wonderful as it had been back in the day. Don't let the initial appearance dissuade you. Yes, it is a liquor store. But damn, do they make incredible sandwiches!! The same two guys have been working there for years and they are always in good spirits. \n\nThey have a long list of sandwich options, although nothing too crazy or fancy. But really, when your secret sauce is that delicious, why overdo it? I always get a regular turkey with everything except onion, plus avocado. You really can't do wrong with an order like that. Their sandwiches are toasty, crispy, messy, and freaking delicious. Id' like to think of myself as quite the sandwich experience, and I think they make some of the best sandwiches in the city. They have a good drink and snack selection as well. Really the only thing missing is place to sit and eat, but with the various nearby parklets (as well as Ocean Beach), it's not that big of a deal.\n\nThe price is right, the sandwiches are filling and delicious, and the wait is never super long.", "author": "Regina L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-18", "description": "Among other foods, sandwiches always remain a heated debate between my friends and I. But no matter what, I consistently find myself keeping Gene's in my Top 5. An institution of some sort in the Sunset, Gene's Liquor stands unassuming on the corner. It may seem like a regular liquor stop, but the sandwiches here are great at its core. Simple, no frills, made from the same 2-level oven for years, these sandwiches keep the neighborhood and the surrounding schools satisfied.\n\nMy personal favorites are the atomic sub and pastrami sandwich, which I order 90% of the time. These two and most of the sandwiches on the menu come on toasted bread with the inclusion of mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and choice of pickles, peppers and secret sauce. This addicting and always dripping sauce is along the lines of an Italian dressing with a little kick. That straightforward combination make for a classic sandwich, no matter what meat is included. Of course, it is still is a liquor store, so it won't be hard to find your preference of chips and drink. Explore the short menu, but you will not be disappointed with the pastrami. Ask the multitude of hungry, after-school, high school kids that frolic and back up the line out the street to the Muni stop. They will tell you, especially since the average $8-9 per sandwich is a large chunk of their allowance.\n\nThe last thing I have to include is Hamik, the store owner and \"head sandwich maker\". He may give you that glazed look and seems like a disinterested liquor store attendant. But stop and have a conversation with him. HE makes Gene's what it is, and what makes this sandwich special. Once you become a regular, he'll remember your order, how many napkins you need, and even the Arizona tea flavor you always get. Maybe he'll make fun of your hat or ask why you're dressed so nicely. Almost 15 years later, Hamik still does the same for me. Sadly, shops like these do not exist anymore, making Gene's a must-stop in the Sunset.", "author": "Carlo D."}

I've had sandwiches from convenience stores that doesn't differ much from Genes appearance-wise. That being said, the sandwiches totally sets this place apart from the others! If it's your first time here, you must try their specialty atomic sub - perfect for meat lovers since it includes pastrami, corned beef, and turkey. Every sandwich comes with their specialty sauce but don't hesitate to ask for more if you like your sandwiches on the wetter side, or if you're just craving an extra kick of flavor. My only suggestion to you is to tell them to go lighter on their onions unless you don't mind that full-on raw onion flavor in sandwiches. Order the regular size if you have a moderate appetite, but go for the large if you're especially hungry or if you're sharing. \n\nOnce you try their atomic, I would also recommend trying their other sandwiches. I personally think their pastrami sandwiches alone are super satisfying, especially if you add avocado. All their sammies are about $6-7 which is reasonable for a good lunch. \n\nLunch times can get really busy. I usually call in and place an order so I can just pick it up and avoid long lines. However, sometimes (peak lunch hours), it gets so busy that they tell you to either call back or to place your order in-person. It'll be worth your wait though, so don't be scared of the extra 15 minutes you'll spend in here.", "author": "Regina C."}

I love that they take orders over the phone and sandwiches are normally ready within 10-15 minutes. BUT, keep in mind that they get VERY busy when there's a sports game going on.\n\nI love the service here; everyone is always friendly, welcoming, and funny. They are very enthusiastic, personable, and kind of tired looking. (Small private shops, it happens) I really didn't expect that from a liquor store, it's a great plus.\n\nThe sandwiches here are absolutely to die for. I love the salami sandwich with pepperjack cheese and avocado. It's my favorite combo!! The bread is always perfectly toasted and their secret sauce complements the sandwich so well. Definitely glad they give napkins cause it can get a bit messy.  \n\nThe regular sized sandwiches are a decent portion if you're not trying to food coma at work. If you're looking for sandwiches piled with a ton of meat, I don't think this is the place to go to. But even with that being said, I still think they give a fair amount for what you're paying. \n\nIf you're ever in the area or trying to have a picnic at the beach or something, stop by and try their sandwiches, you won't regret it. Unless you don't like sandwiches, then you should just opt for something else. :P", "author": "Rebecca T."}

The sandwich comes with mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and their secret sauce. \n\nI was questioning their bread choice, but I was most surprised, their bread works for their sandwich content.

Even smears of mustard and mayo and even the way he folded each slice of turkey was so pleasant to watch.  It was like he was doing laundry.

It looked like a cousin of Italian dressing, but I didn't taste any of that tang and herbs.  \n\nThe bread was good, but I hate to compare, it isn't SubCenter bread.

If you are not sure about the dressing, ask them to go light or maybe give you a side because they put a lot of it. I like it but maybe some may not like so much. I don't know if they automatically put Mayo but I asked that they do because a lot of places don't on this sandwich. So if you happen to order a Hot Pastrami and they don't put the mayo.. make sure you add it! It makes the sandwich like 10 times better.\n\nThis place is not exactly where you would expect to go for a delicious Sub Sandwich.

Hehehe.\"\nAnd thats how I fell in love with Gene's Liquor. Came here in the middle of a random day because my girlfriend wanted a taste of her childhood, so we got the atomic sub and a roast beef sandwich.\n\n-Atomic sub was pretty good. Salami, turkey and pastrami I believe. Might be wrong. I only got a regular size but it was filling. My main beef with the sandwich is the messiness. I know thats a lame complaint but I was eating it in the car and it gets everywhere and yeah. \n-The roast beef sandwich is amazing. Roast beef is my favorite type of sandwich and they do it justice. Long thing slices of roast beef piled thick on a warm toasted bun in vegetable layers that don't slide around. It was one of the better made roast beef sandwiches I've had. And I do consider myself to be a roast beef sandwich connoisseur.  \n-The secret sauce is delicious. Its some type of vinegar based sauce. Really tangy, but works well with in both sandwiches.\n-They SLATHER on the mayo. He scooped this HUGE dollop of mayo onto a spatula and paints it onto the bread. And I'm watching there, my mouth drooling but my muffin top horrified. Just be wary and ask for less if your love handles can't handle the love.\n-I asked for pickles and peppers which are complimentary but don't come with the sandwiches. But he also piles on the peppers. I love spiciness but I swear, every bite I was eating 2-3 jalapenos. \n-I like the toasted bread but sometimes, if you bite into the sandwich wrong, the bread will cut the roof of your mouth. I hate that feeling!\n-I think the total for two sandwiches was $12. Both were regular size and my girlfriend and I were both really full. So I can only imagine what a large would have done to our stomachs. \n\nTry it out! If you like sandwiches, Gene's Liquor has tasty varieties. Plus Hamik is really nice and its pretty cheap for what you get.", "author": "Aron L."}

I really wish this was true because as much as I like SC, I do admit that I feel their submarine sandwiches are expensive ($7-8+ !).  \n\nAfter trying Gene's, I must say that I was a little disappointed.  I placed the take out order Friday before making my way out to AT&T Park to see the Giants game (what better way to see the game than with my Gene's Liquor sandwich? :)  The bread was still crunchy from being toasted but the rest of it, unfortunately, got soggy probably from the Italian dressing secret sauce and was pretty messy to eat.  \n\nI ordered the large Atomic Submarine sandwich (which I thought was kinda funny since SC had their own \"Atomic Sub\" as well) and set me back approximately $8.37 (these are SC prices we're talking about!)!

He makes sandwiches with love and the others he are mentoring are getting there but will never reach his status. He is so awesome they should rename it Hamik's. Pastrami is the way to go. Prices are rising along with this recession. But come on now. Who can't help but love the bread, cheese, onion, tomato, meat, mayo, mustard, lettuce all toasted in less than 7 minutes. If you don't like something just ask.  I've been introduced to this place since 2004 and have been going on a monthly basis.\n\nAnd to add they sell IT'S ITS ICE CREAM. San Francisco's greatest invention ever. They sell chocolate, original, mint, and cappuccino I believe. A delicious mouth watering sandwich and an SF delicacy. Truly an experience. \n\nJust go on a weekend or during the day when the high schoolers are still inside and nowhere to be found because when they get out it's a rush for some Hamik's Sandwiches. At least when I was in high school, that was the place to go.", "author": "Philbert K."}

One would think you can usually find a deli sando pretty much anywhere when you live in the city, but Parkside is a little limited.

I always ask to lightly toast my sando (they get pretty crispy otherwise) and after a while, he learns your preferences.  Hurry though......he about to raise his sando prices!!", "author": "Scott N."}

One day my friend introduced me to Gene's Deli, and I was hooked.  They taste just as good, if not better, as the Submarine Center.  Sandwiches are always hot, fresh, and made to order.  Hot pastrami with everything is my favorite.  They can get kinda messy when eating, so get some napkins.  Pricing is decent, $5 for a regular, and $6.50 for a large.  I remember the days when a regular was $4.50 and a large was $6.  But either way, the sandwiches are still worth it.  It's been years since I've gone back to the Submarine Center...

When I walked in and saw the sad little \"deli\" right next to the cash register I almost walked out. But I said to myself, \"No! Do not run away like a Frenchman!\" So I didn't. I, as you all suggested, ordered the Atomic Sub. A large one. I must say it was much better than I would have guessed. Pretty large, generous toppings, plenty of meat, nicely toasted. But nothing to make a special trip for. If I were on that corner at lunch time I would get another one but I will never make a special trip to go back there. It is an okay sandwich for a little bit too much money (a large Atomic costs $8.85). If you are on Taraval or in the vicinity I would highly recommend heading up to Guerra Meat Market and getting a much higher quality sandwich for less money.

Sadly, I was only able to finish half since I was on the go as well. It was unfortunately because it was effin delicious!
