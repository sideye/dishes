{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-06-07", "description": "Right off the bat looking at the menu you notice the biggest downside to this restaurant - the prices. \n\nI have a lot of positive things to say about the rest of the experience. It's nicely decorated, the staff is way nice, there's outdoor seating, and the food is really tasty. The prices, though, are up toward the $20 mark for most entrees. I'm sure that's why their sandwiches are so popular. \n\nIf you come in during happy hour (like I did), $2 off beer, wine, cocktails, and tapas helps...their mango cocktail (which is super delicious) is a very solid drink for that price. Even with the discount, the food is good (not amazing). But combine happy hour with a five stars $2 off deal, and you can get 2 tapas and a cocktail for $23...not too shabby. \n\nAs you can see, I'm all about the discounts, and it really helps here. Combining $6 in happy hour discounts, $2 in five star, $10 in allset, I still paid $40 for 2 meals and one cocktail. \n\nI got a the steak, which was my favorite item, it was cooked perfectly and served with some really good mashed potatoes and a very tasty salad. I added two tapas, which was more than I could eat. The truffle Mac and cheese is super generous, although it suffers from the same curse as many american dishes with truffle oil - the truffle oil is PROMINENT and doesn't leave a lot of room for other flavors. The empanadas are super good, and a bit unique in style. \n\nTop it all off with the hot sauce, which is delicious but not very spicy... use copiously. \n\nSo yes, this place solidly hits the mark of good food I'd come back for, I'm just not sure it's worth the price...outside of happy hour, I'd definitely skip.", "author": "Chris S."}

They have good Happy Hour and agua fresca made fresh.\n\nMy go-to is always the quinoa kale salad with stead added on top. Over the years, the price of this crept up and became a $20 salad! However, the flavors are great and it's healthy, and best of all, the portion size was good (a lot of quinoa and kale that has been seasoned and massaged in oil, and a sizeable portion of steak).\n\nUnfortunately, this place either got a new owner or something happened to quality. I ordered the same salad (via Caviar) and was very disappointed. Instead of kale, it's mixed greens, a little bit of quinoa, and this ridiculous topping of fried hominy which is too dry to swallow. Worst of all, the steak was cooked well-done (almost burnt) and I had requested it to be rare. The portion of the steak was awful, maybe half the size of my very small palm of my hand. I had unfortunately ordered two portions and both were equally terrible.\n\nThere is no substance in the salad now that it's mixed greens, which is all \"air\" so it was sad to know I paid $20+ for this salad (in addition to Caviar fees).  Caviar was nice enough to reimburse me for the added cost for the steak and also gave me credit for my next order.", "author": "Mai T."}

It was so yummy just by itself but it also came with this amazing sauce that I can't really describe other than to say it enhanced the sandwich. It was bold and full of popping flavor. They already won me over with the delicious sandwich but then I got a free treat out of it too. I found this place through Yelp and it had a little advertisement that said if I checked in I could get a free brownie. I ordered it to go and picked it up. They were so polite, prompt and my food was spot on. I'd expect a free brownie to be small and not particularly amazing but they blew me away with a very large, rich and perfectly cooked brownie with a side of homemade whipped cream and homemade caramel or butterscotch or buttered toffee sauce. Whatever that stuff was I'd buy it by the jar it was so good and not too sweet.

The ceviche was tangy and fresh, perfectly paired with crispy platano chips. The yuca fritas was yummy with the two sauces that came with it, one of which was garlic cream similar to ranch dressing. \n\nNo five stars given only because it's kind of pricey.

I take out your jicama salad with shrimp skewers probably twice a month. The shrimp used to be plump and succulent- and I'm pretty certain there were 6. Now there are 4 puny dried out shrimp....for $8.99!! And there used to be two containers of dressing. Now there is one and it's not full. The lettuce and jicama is $10.99.  Now my nearly $20 salad is pathetic. Last week I thought it was an anomaly. But tonight was a repeat of the same.\n\nGoodbye Artesano!", "author": "R. P."}

Overall, it was a pretty tasty light lunch. Nothing special, similar to a Panera  bread steak sandwich. But $14.99?! That's way more than what the quality of the food justifies. The meat was charred and well done (overcooked for my preference), but it had good flavor. \"Garlic aioli and zest chimichurri sauce\" is a pretty generous description. It was pure mayonnaise, I could not distinguish anything special about it. Mayonnaise on a $15 steak sandwich?! No thank you. Mayonnaise on a $9 steak sandwich seems a little more appropriate. The redeeming factor was the bread, it didn't validate the price, but was quite good. Light and airy, not doughy, and crisp golden-brown exterior, not too chewy. For my side, I opted for the \"Organic mixed green salad,\" instead of the fries. One of my biggest pet-peeves with salad is having excessive amounts of dressing applied BEFORE serving. Let me choose how much or how little dressing I prefer. The salad was DROWNING in oil. It could have been good, could have been bad, who knows?! All I tasted was thick oil and couldn't stomach more than a bite or two. \n\nI would love to come back and be proven wrong, but the price does not match the product. I would love to see prices reduced on the more commonplace entrees, or step up the quality of the product to justify the $$$. This place has potential to a be a boogie, artisanal, Latin specialty dining experience, OR a local dig for reasonably priced, quality bites. But it CAN'T be both.", "author": "Ryan D."}

I work with a bunch of doctors and surgeons so I had to make sure I ordered something good. \n\nFor the retirement party, we ordered the Ceaser salad and the chopped salad. It was really good and the portions were just generous. Then for the meal we had the unpulled pork and the chicken Artesano. I remember it because really juicy and tender. The were spot on with the flavors. Then we got the shrimp skewers. Everyone had a hard time taking the shrimp off the skewers. I mean it's not rocket science, but the shrimp did not budge. \n\nFor dessert we had the brownies which was just ok and the tres leche which was completely melted because they had the hot items on top of the desserts. \n\nBut when we ordered it recently for our Staff Appreciation Day, we ordered the Caesar Salad, beans, rice, and the Artesano Chicken. Everything was good except the Artesano chicken. It was so salty!! Everyone was complaining how bad the chicken was. \n\nAlso, when we had our food delivered for our staff appreciation day on March 6th, they gave us a to-go menu. My co-worker and I ordered food. The menu said the Ceaser salad was $7.99 and the 2 piece chicken Artesano was $10.99. So the bill should of been about $19.00. They have raised the prices in less than a week or someone is passing out old menus. \n\nToo cheap to reprint new menus? \n\nAnyway, when we picked up our food, the workers must have been so lazy.. Our salad that we ordered had the lettuce sticking out of the container with the lid already closed. So unsanitary..", "author": "Darlene M."}

In the evening they now do \"sit down service\" - more traditional restaurant style order at your table.\n\nI have been here a handful of times for both lunch and dinner.  The menu is the same for both.  In addition to the food offerings they have beer and wine - including Agave wine cocktails. \n\nOver the past year I have sampled about 10 different items on the menu.  They ranged from good to very good.  For the starters I particularly enjoyed the Yellowtail Ceviche and the Albondigas as well as the Black Bean Soup.  The Quinoa and Kale salad was flavorful and healthy - two things that don't always go together.\n\nFor the main meal item I usually get a sandwich (often because I am getting it to go or I am there for lunch).  I enjoy the Cubano - while I have had better elsewhere (Miami, L.A., Buenos Aires), I haven't had a really great one in the SF area.  This is probably the best I have had so far in the area (Note: I have not yet been to Parada 22).  I also have to say, I have been getting Cubano sandwiches long before the movie Chef came out - seems everyone says that since they saw the movie the need to order them.\n\nThe Albondigas Sandwich is good, but I think I prefer the meatballs on their own as served in the starter item. I also enjoy  the grilled fish sandwich, though I think the sandwich masks the more delicate flavor of the fish.\n\nFor main plates I prefer the Grilled Yellowtail.  The steak has been ordered twice - once very good and once it was sort of tough.  \n\nSo overall I would say that it isn't my favorite place in an area filled with plenty of good options, but it is good enough and convenient enough for me to keep coming back on occasion.", "author": "Jeff H."}

They have happy hour every day (even weekends) with buy one, get one free drinks and great deals on appetizers. Try the Chicken Artesano (I get this dish every time and love dipping the chicken in the spicy red Artesano sauce) which comes with beans, rice, and a salad (which has a great flavorful dressing) and the Yucca Fries which come with dipping sauces; I also like the Caesar Salad, Ceviche, and the Grilled Shrimp Skewer. I also love that they have desserts, which I'm sometimes in the mood for--I've gotten the Tres Leches Cake and the Dulce De Leche Brownie, and both were delicious. The prices are totally reasonable and many of the dishes can also accommodate healthy diets. The staff are super friendly, give very full wine pours, and are great with kids (my friend brings her toddler, and the staff always interact with him, don't freak if he spills something, give him crayons and paper to color on, and a little wax toy to play with, etc.). They also do takeout and offer delivery through Caviar. And, not like you need any more enticement to go, but they often have 10-20% off Groupon+ Deals. They're in a pretty low-key location that I think gets passed up a lot, so it's typically never crowded. But they're open seven days a week, near a bus stop, and also have free parking in the back of the restaurant. Check it out--you won't be sorry!", "author": "Christina Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-17", "description": "Went to check out Artesano just a few days after its opening. I was pretty excited at first reading the reviews, then after carefully looking at all 6, it seems like only a few of them are \"legit\" reviews. Which made me a little nervous since they weren't as complimentary as the other ones. \n\nFood: Food is okay. If I lived around here, then I'd probably stop by more often. However, not living in the area means I probably won't come here again any time soon. \nSignature Chicken Dish: Disappointing. LIke another reviewer said, it was dry (shocking considering it's dark meat) and not particularly flavorful. It didn't even look nice-- had this pasty white look to it. \nUnpulled grilled pork: pretty good. I would order this again. It was much more tender and pulled apart more easily than the chicken. Surprising that the rice that comes with it is \"sticky\" and not as grainy.\nYucca fries: Standard. Nothing special but it's not horrible. The dipping sauces were weird though.\n\nService: Considering it's brand new, the service was pretty good. It was a little bit confusing because when I first went in, a hostess/waitress asked me if I were dining in or getting takeout. I said dine in... and she started walking towards a booth and I wasn't sure whether to follow her or not. Instead I stood around awkwardly and just asked her whether they seat us or it's first come first serve. she said to grab our own seats, but later I saw another guest being seated by a waiter. Our waiter often checked in on us, which is nice, but it was almost excessive. I know it sounds nitpicky but when you're trying to have a conversation with someone it gets annoying to be interrupted often.\n\nSummary: If you're in the neighborhood and hungry, by all means try Artesano (but not the chicken). Don't go out of your way to try it though. Much prefer paying a little more for Limon Rotisserie or La Fusion.", "author": "Nanette W."}

You are first greeted by the perky patio furniture, which has such a colorful and minimalist design that it could be a subliminal iPhone 5c commercial.  Inside is a fun, casual atmosphere.  The high ceiling is crisscrossed with strings of lights, and the open kitchen spans the length of the restaurant with an accompanying bar stool seating area.  The modern stainless steal chairs are comfortable, contrasting the rustic wooden tables (fusion ambiance?!)\n\nService was friendly.  I don't think I've ever encountered a server respond in such a courteous manner when I asked for water.\n\nAfter much thought, I ordered the Pollo Guisado, $13 (slow-cooked chicken with vegetables, pineapple, and fresh chipotle sauce, with side salad, beans, and rice).  I expected the chicken to be more memorable, but it was rather bland.  There wasn't much to it that would categorize it as Latin comfort food; the cooking style was homemade but closer to American-homemade than secret-recipe-from-Latin-America homemade.  The salad was fresh and the balsamic dressing was tastier than the standard out-of-the-bottle salad dressing.  Nothing special about the beans, but it's healthy and fills you up.  The rice was meh.  Not only are there no options besides white rice (yes I am one of those health freaks who is adamant about brown rice), but they don't even cook it correctly.  It's sort of mushy and in aggregate clumps.  Other than the rice, the food is not bad, but I would expect something more unique and/or organic.  It came out to $14.40 total, which I consider a pricey lunch, even in SF.\n\nOverall it's a nice place, and casual enough that you could probably even stay to do work like at a cafe.

The first time was a disappointment but since I love Cuban food I decided to give it a 2nd shot.\nThe 1st time I ate here, I ordered the Cubano. Absolutely nothing special. It was actually burnt a little on the bread. The meat was not tender and tasted plain.All foodies know that Cubanos aren't supposed to be burnt at all. And for over $13 you would think that would include a side salad or at least have organic ingredients , but no such luck here. I guess you need to go to Miami to eat a true Cubano sandwich.\nIn addition to this first sandwich, the guy at the register forgot to bring me my fresca drink and completely ignored me when I stood waiting for a good 6 minutes to ask for water.\n\n2nd time I ordered a fish sandwich.  It took forever for them to get it to me. Then I noticed it just lying there on the counter. By the time I ate that fish sandwich it was pretty cold, and very soggy. It was actually soaking. The liquids had completely soaked through the bread and it was a hot mess. Not appetizing in the least.  And for over $14 a sandwich , again one would expect a side salad or fries without any additional charges.\nThis place is over priced but not that good.

I've come mostly for their salads which are delicious and healthy. I had a kale and quinoa salad and their chopped salad - both were out of this world delish and I love that you can pick a meat to add. I've had their chicken which is fantastic, but their steak is super flavorful, juicy, cooked perfectly, great quality, and they actually give you a reasonable portion for the price. SO AWESOME! And their black bean soup is really flavorful and wonderful as well. I've come at lunch and received my food quickly, and at dinnertime - well let me just say dinnertime is the time to go. When everyone else in SF is getting gussied up to grab an uber and wait for a seat at their favorite restaurant, Artesano has the space for you to hang out or get takeout. Totally worth it and I sure hope they stick around!", "author": "Celeste R."}

The reason for rounding down instead of up, is because of the arrogant service.  Our server seemed annoyed of us the moment we walked in.  I understand that everyone has a bad day, but jeez, this guy needed to lighten up. \n\nAside from that, Artesano (now open for about 7 months), was pretty enjoyable.  The atmosphere is cozy and vibrant, with a warm fireplace at the entrance, perfect for those chilly San Francisco evenings (aka perfect for every evening).  The food was also pretty good!  The bf and I ordered the ceviche for our appetizer and the jicama salad with yellowtail and the pulled chicken sandwich as our entrees.  The food was nothing to call home about, but it was good enough that I will definitely come back to eat again.\n\nIf you are in the mood for a relatively quick, casual dinner that will leave you feeling satisfied, then Artesano is your place!", "author": "Juliana K."}

Beans & rice just like they serve 'em in Central/South America- basic black beans and rice.  \n\nAll in all, I'm very excited to have this place in the 'hood.

The Lomo Saltado was delicious, but I don't know if I'd pay $17 for it again.

And an unbelievable price point for SF (wine, apps, entree and dessert under $100 for 3 people!!). The food is NOT over spiced like so many Latin restaurants in California. Instead they depend on good ingredients to bring out the flavor.\n\nWe started with yucca fries (an absolute must) and mixed ceviche. The fries came with 3 sauces: one sweet, one smoky and one creamy. The yellowtail in the ceviche was very fresh and perfectly paired with crispy plantain chips. For entrees, we had the Churrasco steak, chicken and non-pulled pork (muy sabroso!)... All three were very rich and tasty on their own but we were BLOWN AWAY by the spicy/sweet table sauce. If the owner is reading this PLEASE START SELLING THIS SAUCE NOW!\n\nWe finished with the best tres leches I've ever had in California. My friends (native Califns) hadn't had it before and we ended up having to order another cuz one wasn't enough. \n\nI've had good South American fare in California and its usually pricey and/or too intricate.

Upon entering I was greeted by a smiling waiter and chief Jeff Gambardella and owner Doug Mathieux on my way to the hostess stand.  She cheerfully greeted the party of six that walked in before me to eat in and informed them that in the evening they offer table service and promptly showed them to a wonderful  communal table near the front window.  Very good vibe for a very casual dining space.\n\nWhen I was greeted by the hostess I let her know that I had only noticed this place last week when driving by and wanted to stop and check it out for take out.  She let me know that it had only opened 3 weeks ago and offered me a sample of their yucca chips.  \n\nI ordered the char grilled steak served with a zesty chichier sauce and the gulf shrimp grilled with coconut lime glaze. The order was prepared promptly and smelled great on the way home.  Unfortunately when I got home and was about the split to the two orders to share, instead of the gulf shrimp grilled with coconut lime glaze I ended up with  fresh grilled line-caught yellow tail served with homemade pineapple salsa.   Since I had worked all day, then had spent 2 hours in the gym, I was in no mood to hop back in the car to return dinner.  So,  I divided up the steak and Fish along with the rice and bean and we have it a try.\n\nWhile the steak was cooked to medium rare I think it may have been sliced incorrectly with the grain as it we VERY tough and was also under seasoned.  It needed a lot more chimichurri sauce than what was provided and I felt the sauce was also under seasoned.  The grilled yellow tail was well cooked but also under seasoned and while the pineapple salsa was very good there was not enough of it to make up for the under seasoning. \n\nI think we will give it another try as dine in.

I loved how there were menu booth options - so much more comfortable!\n\nThe menu is huge and has tons of pesce and veggie options! We weren't TOO hungry, so we decided to split the chopped salad and the black bean soup. I was very happy that the chef was able to split both the salad and soup into two separate bowls / plates. Most restaurants won't go through this hassle and will just give you an extra bowl/plate and have you do it yourself. Presentation was great and the portion was just right. I can't imagine that I would be able to finish an entire salad or soup! I loved how much crunch the salad had and the plantain chips that came with the soup were AMAZING! The soup itself needed a little more flavor, but the salad was just perfect and I highly recommend it. I asked for croutons to be added to the salad (do it - they're homemade and delish). Also, their homemade hot sauce is amazing. Next time I come here, I will definitely have to ask for a little to go! \n\nService was excellent! Everyone was extremely nice and very helpful. I loved the decor of this place. The mason jars all around the restaurant are a great little decorative touch. This place is very healthy, which is an added bonus. My friend and I were both very full but didn't feel as though we overate after dining here! I'll be back!", "author": "Anastasia N."}

The food is high quality and fresh and they provide ample portions. (Note: One of my pet peeves is feeling like I should eat before I go to a restaurant so I either don't end up feeling hungry or demolish my bank account.) \n\nOne of their salads with steak on it will cost about $18, which is considerable for a salad. However, they are serving you high-end restaurant quality food. And it's a full  meal. This isn't a grab-and-go salad like you'd get at Whole Foods. Their combinations are less expensive and range from $12 to $17: you order the entree and get rice, beans, and greens on the side. They also offer quinoa instead of white rice. \n\nIf you have dietary restrictions, their menu makes it easy to customize exactly what you'd like for your meal. And there's plenty here to satisfy everyone (vegans, vegetarian, meat-eaters, gluten-free types). I passed on their desserts, but my dinner companions confirmed that they were exceptional. \n\nThe decor is casual and fun. I love how mason jars are used for wall sconces.", "author": "Louise L."}

Since having 2 kids - I've become even more selective of the restaurants I choose to dine at - weighing in the time, cost and the \"can I make this at home?\" factors. I was unsure of this previous Asqew Grill spot - but my husband said he'd heard this place was similar to \"Sol Food\" in San Rafael. My hand was already opening the door before he could finish his statement. \n\nWe feasted on the below (4 adults 1 child):\nApp: Plantain Fritas  - my 2 year old couldn't get enough of this with their cilantro lime crema. Works for me - she was getting her daily fruit, calcium intake with a lil bit of greens \nApp: Yellowtail Ceviche - Anytime there is a ceviche on a menu I must have it. This was light and fresh with a perfect amount of flavor. \nUn Pulled Grilled Pork - My mouth salivated as my fork easily cut a bite sized piece. Amazing flavor and texture. This was so good I shut my mouth during the meal to avoid having others ask me how my dish was and want a bite.\nPollo De Artesano - For once I was delighted my daughter didn't finish her dish (the kid's (likely too many plantain fritas) - this was delicious. How do they get the chicken so tender? My mouth didn't know which to devour first between this dish and the UnPulled Pork.\nCuban Sandwich - The hubs and his dad had this - honestly I was just trying to keep him away from my unpulled pork, my daughters chicken and my ceviche. I took a bite of his sando but I'd stick with my dish or the lil ones.\nGrilled Fish Sandwich - I didn't try this - but my mother in law, who only takes 2 bites of any dish she orders ate this whole sandwich. \nThe sparkling Limonade was refreshing and we enjoyed our meal at their communal table. \n\nGiven the factors in my restaurant selection - I felt Artesano was well worth the time, cost - and I definitely couldn't make these dishes at home. As for comparison to Sol Food - dare I say that chicken combined with the special sauce that's on the table - oh and the beans and rice - definitely rivals theirs. I'm happy I don't need to drive across that GG Bridge to get my fix and this place offers more variety in their menu.

Dinner was delicious, though I will say that the chicken thighs/breasts were a bit dry and overcooked, something the sauce generally made up for.

I'd been resisting trying this place since it opened several months ago, I guess because of the strip mall setting. But now I regret that I didn't try here sooner! The plantain chips, kale and quinoa salad, \"un-pulled\" pork, and mango agua fresca were all totally solid--the dulce de leche brownie was out of this world. Our 10-year-old loved it, too... We will definitely be back. We ate in this time, near a cozy fireplace, but will try taking out soon.", "author": "Julia N."}

I had expected this casual little joint to be fine at best, but it far exceeded my expectations.\n\nWe started with the fried plantain chips, which come with three dipping sauces.  The chips were good (light, not too greasy), but the sauces were amazing.  For my entree I selected the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of black beans and rice.  All I can say is wow!  The chicken was moist and tender and it was coated in a wonderfully flavorful, complex sauce.  I may go back again this week for another round!  \n\nMy husband had the veggie guisado de calabaza, and he loved it.  I think he told the waiter three times, maybe more, that the dish was fantastic.  He also liked the sparkling agua fresca.  \n\nWe didn't opt for dessert , but we'll give it a shot next time.\n\nOh, the service was totally pleasant and quite proficient...I'm not sure I understand the nitpicky reviews.   \n\nGive this place a shot.", "author": "Megan C."}

I went in and tried to order at the register  but said it was for here and he said I would have to order through someone else and then handed me a menu.  Maybe I'm just used to asqew even though I only went there twice but the layout is awkward. So I decide to get it to go - ordered the 2 piece chicken with rice and beans - it came out in 30 seconds and tasted pretty good - wasn't blown away but would eat there again, just not a spot that will be added in the rotation.  I would suggest they pick an identity - fast casual and order at the counter and grab a number or full sit down and cook to order - fast casual will save some cash which I think this spot will need - hope I'm wrong", "author": "Tim G."}

We were a group of 10 with 4 small kids.  When we arrived the space was very empty since it was early.  When we asked one of the servers on how we can be seated she was very rude and non-accommodating.  She basically said she could put something together outside but not inside.  Luckily a gentleman who was sitting alone at the large common table offered to move which was very nice of him.  Then the same rude server proceeds to talk shit about us to her co-workers for making the man move.  When she turned around I confronted her and asked if there was a problem.  She said no and continued about her business.  The place was empty.  We had 10 paying folks.  You could be a bit more accommodating to families.  Thanks for the awesome experience and service.  I will not be back and I will tell all my friends with kids not to go to your restaurant.  You messed with the wrong family lady.  I will say the rest of the staff was very nice, but it only takes one bad egg to screw up the bunch.  Being there in Laurel Village you think you would be a bit more accommodating to families given the neighborhood.

The manager was very helpful with reserving a table, pre-ordering food, and making sure the event went smoothly. The only glitch was that I pre-ordered dulce de leche cakes and tres leches brownies. When I arrived for the party, they had tres leches brownies and macarons, which I assume they bought at a neighboring restaurant. This was disappointing, but they threw in fried plantains and non-alcoholic drinks for make up for the last-minute change.  Everyone was happy to have the drinks and salty snack in addition to the sweets, so this change worked out fine. All in all, I would host an event at Artesano in the future.", "author": "Jen Y."}

As for my order to-go with my boyfriend, I was a bit disappointed. I wanted to order my artesano chicken with my salad replaced with the quinoa and they didnt let me, and my boyfriend's order of chicken guisado was delicious but didn't let him change his salad to rice either. Talk about bad service... the food was good but the service was bad. Not only did they not allow us to swap out our sides (even if we didn't mind paying more), they were slow and took too long to get our orders, and the people who took my order at the counter seemed super unhappy too (which also put me out of the mood to eat there too). Also the mango orange fresca was carbonated and delicious, and probably would've gotten a better rating if it wasn't for their service.

The fries were too salty and just average.  His ceviche had way too much lemon and was almost I edible.  Furthermore please train your runners to know what dish goes to what table number . Don't ask is if we ordered something that we clearly did not. Read the ticket please! This place was overpriced and a rip off.

The place looks great, with vibrant colors.  Kitchen is open so you can see the cook making the food.  The place was busy has everyone was looking forward to check the new restaurant.  Met the owners which made the experience very personable!  Very friendly too!  Sat down at a booth and the waiter explained what Artesano was about and then I got to sample the food (Ceviche appetizer and Pulled Chicken sandwich), both excellent!  A great start on the first day of business.  You can tell the owners are trying really hard to be successful.  And I'm sure they will.  Remember folks, they just opened!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-12", "description": "My 2nd update as the owner of Artesano was so lovely and insisted on sending a $20 gift card to encourage me to try the restaurant again. Generally, I feel uncomfortable with this sort of thing for it feels like a business is trying to buy a better review. And indeed, it is awkward as I went back to Artesano last night and still did not have a stellar experience. My recent experience was far better than my initial 1-star, but I really can't honestly say it was better than a 3-star and a good portion of the bump is due to the owner earnestly caring about my experience and trying to make it right. Yet, the service was still slow and awkward (too much attention at the wrong times and not enough at other times) and the food was good, but not great (smallish portions for the price and the fish was overcooked). We had a child with us and no kid menu. It wasn't until we asked the waiter about one that he told us there was a $5 kid's plate not listed on the menu (this should be on the menu or offered verbally anytime a kid is with the party). The section near the fireplace is too hot to sit in and the rest of the restaurant is so cold they need unattractive space heaters. The lighting is also way too bright. All things that need to be considered for the prices charged. Again, I hugely appreciate the effort the owner has gone to try and \"right the review.\"  There are a lot of businesses that just don't care and clearly this one does, but the concept and formula still aren't 5-star for me.", "author": "Kristin S."}

But, have I mentioned the wine? I'm a vino tinto drinker, and although the selections aren't Merlot, Pinot or Cabernet, the wine is delicious and cheap!! $7 or $8 per each generous glass, accompanies equally generous plates of food. I, who am always on a diet, ordered the jicama salad, and it's definitely meal-sized. And they put six (!) grilled shrimp on for the add-on. It was delicious. My husband got the grilled yellowtail tuna for about half what we've seen charged in other places.

I had a bite of my friend's tres leche cake and wish I would've started THERE, but that is my sweet tooth talking.

Latin-flavored dishes prepared with imagination, served promptly and with a smile.  Hubby had the flatiron steak, I tried the unpulled pork after reading the rave reviews.  Both were absolutely delicious.  Rice and black beans are the standard sides;  when mixed with the spicy sauce (a bottle is on each table), the result is heavenly.  Portions are on the small side but that's OK, you'll  want to leave room for the tres leches cake which as far as I'm concerned is THE best dessert on the planet.

I hope this doesn't cause the chef here to have a scene like Jon did in the movie when he lost it with Oliver (I'm not a popular blogger, so probably won't matter much except to yelpsters). Hence, I was severely annoyed when my food came out less than mediocre. Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish, but the shrimp on skewers dinner was horrid. HORRID. The shrimps were way overcooked and just about inedible. I had to pick off the black carbon on the shrimps and the edges of all pieces of shrimp were hard as rock - inedible. The rice tasted really funny too - can't quite put my finger on it but it tasted funny. The black beans were ok though. I was so frustrated towards the end of the meal, I threw the last piece of shrimp on my plate in disgust. I would have eaten it since I was still hungry, but it was just too upsetting. Maybe I should have ordered a salad. Guess I will have to run to the Mission for Cuban food. The waitress was nice though. I should have known that it might not have been great given the empty tables there - when I walked into the Inner Richmond later, both Burma Superstar and its sister B had long lines out the door.", "author": "Frank S."}

Although the waiter instructed me that this was not pulled pork but more like a steak , it would be so tender you could pull it apart as though it was. So disappointed that this meat although spicy  was in large part fatty and tough. My knife and my teeth got quite a workout!  The rice and black beans were plain but the salsa on the table was very tasty and I used it on them. The salad was just plain greens that you pull out of a plastic bag at the market, nothing special about the light dressing either. The cucumber cantaloupe fresca was pretty looking and served in a huge jar for $3.00.  I could only drink 1/3 of it.  It could have been sweeter.  For $17.40 plus tip I kept thinking about El Faro where I have ordered the most delicious pulled pork, rice and beans for 1/3 of the price.
