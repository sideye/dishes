Customer service is with a smile as they continuously make their culinary delights. This place is a gem!!!\n\nToday I tried the new Whole Cakes Creamy Nut Butter, made with *peanuts, *walunuts, *honey, sea salt, and *maple syrup (* = organic). This is a perfect nut butter blend. The combination of the rich nuts with the subtle flavor of salt and natures sweeter (maple syrup) is a great way to satisfy your hunger. Consider putting Whole Cake's Nut Butter on toast, a Nut Butter and Jelly sandwich, or just out of the jar, you'll be smiling the whole time!", "author": "Scott P."}

Sonya was very pleasant and if you have any question, she's the one to answer your inquiries. For cake orders, they recommend 48 hrs in advance but took care of mine in less than 24hrs! =)\nIf you come in the morning, you'll also get to see fresh pastry or muffin by the window cooling off! They also  have cookies and coffee (get their stamp card for buy 10=1 free drink).\nI ordered the Chiffon Matcha with fresh mango 8inch cake, while expensive at $55.00, you pay for the quality and great taste. You can request writing such as happy birthday on it, which is different than your normal cake shop because the writing is on a very thin chocolate and looks very appealing. The cake is light and fluffy, cream is on point and everything about this cake was worth every bite & dollar! If you're nearby, they can also deliver to your business or office for a small fee.

The slice of chocolate-based cake I bought seemed similar both in texture and in taste, as Betty Crocker's chocolate cake mix.  The 2 small cookies were good, but for $2 each, I would have expected again, something more than what seemed to have come from a good cookie mix.\n\nService:\n-2 stars\nUnfortunately, the customer service was what really shocked me about this place.  I get it, we're in San Francisco, your cakes on display are almost always only made to order, so you think it's annoying and worth ridiculing that I even asked if they were available for sale in slices or whole.  The unpleasantness was the attitude of the staff when I asked what was available.  They let me ask 1 by 1 if each item was available instead of simplying saying they were out of stock in everything, except for 3 slices of chocolate cake.  After they said nothing else was available, I asked about 2 trays of what looked like crispy bars (?) and the male staff member looked over (noticed that they were indeed, not sold out of that) but simply replied \"mmm . . . but then we'd have to cut them.  No. Those aren't for sale.\"  So you'd rather let a customer walk out today so you don't have to cut them, and sell them unfresh the next day?  I proceeded to get the slice of chocolate cake and 2 cookie flavors they had available.  \n\nFor those of you who are familiar with this joint, there is an area with 3-4 bar seats and a bar counter in the shop.  The staff were unpacking boxes while I was in there, which obstructed all the chairs and counter space.  Being busy is understandable, but no one bothered apologizing or addressing for the fact that there was no counterspace available to actually eat your cake, and the staff allowed me and my friend to just stand and eat at the corner of the shop by the door.   \n\nAgain, I know this is San Francisco, a city with a shortage of custom-made cake joints, but for the price you charge, you can do better.", "author": "Colette C."}

The Whole Cakes name must refer to the fact that there are very few slices for sale.  A little troubling for the casual afternoon snacker, but what I was fortunate enough sample was quite tasty.\n\nDouble Chocolate Cake: Not sure where the \"double\" comes from.  There's fluffy chocolate cake, whipped cream and some raspberries and strawberries.  Compared to those buttercream frosting cake places, this felt very light.  Guess it's perfect for when you want something sweet, but not too heavy.  Though when you do want something indulgently heavy, you'll feel a little disappointed for $6.\n\nCrepe Layered Cake w/ Mixed Berry: Now this is the cake slice you need to get, if it is available.  Why settle for one measly crepe when you have tons stacked on top of each other with only a thin layer of whipped cream and berry bits between.  Each forkful separates off a host of little crepe bits for a texture experience unlike anything you've had before.  Seriously better than the traditional cakey cakes here.\n\nSignature Green Tea Cake w/ Mango: I can see why this is their signature, it's unique and delicious.  The cake is heavily infused with matcha, giving it a nice roasted umami flair.  The mango floating in the whipped cream layers add an indulgently sweet contrast.  No buttercream frosting regret because this flavor combo is never found at buttercream-centric cake shops.", "author": "Adam B."}

I came here to purchase a small 4 inch cake and found a really cute strawberry cake. The cake is basically ALL frosting/cream. There's a thin middle layer of cake and another thin layer on the bottom. The frosting is not too sweet but the breading is sweeter so it balances out. Frosting was light and creamy whereas the breading was a little dense.  It tasted like any regular cake. I didn't find anything special about it. \n\nThe reason for the 2 stars is because 1) I felt like it was so overpriced for such a small cake. It was $17 flat for a 4 inch cake and 2) when I got home and was getting ready to light the candles on the cake, I found a piece of hair on the frosting!! It was so gross. I had to scrape off the whole top layer of frosting because of the hair because I didn't want to let the cake go to waste since I paid so much for such a tiny cake. \n\nAll in all, I didn't find anything special about their cakes even though I've read so many great yelp reviews about it. Maybe I just got the wrong cake. Who knows, maybe one day I'll decide to give them another chance.", "author": "Anna D."}

The layer of cake on top was moist but only because they put some liquid (the owner was very adamant it was not simple syrup.....) in there.

I love the concept of using all organic ingredients, and quite frankly, I have no issue shelling out more money for higher quality BUT when the taste is not on par with the high price tag it loses all justification. I've ordered cakes with them in the past and sometimes it's good sometimes it's not. The inconsistency has left me questioning if I should order any more birthday cakes here on out. If I'm buying a $60+ cake for a special occasion it better be damn good.\n\nMy recent visit happened last week when I placed an order for two cakes: one crepe cake, the other black sesame. I LOVE crepe cake. Not too many bakeries carry mille crepe cake. In fact, the only other bakery I know that specializes in crepe cake is Anton SV Patisserie in SJ. Despite not opening on weekends, I purposely planned a surprise birthday get-together during the week so I can pick up a fresh crepe cake from this bakery. To my surprise, the crepe layers were too thick and the taste of dough overpowered the filling. What made it worse, the second cake I ordered was very dry and bland. It had almost no hint of black sesame in either the cake or frosting and could've used more sugar. I was pretty disappointed in both cakes.\n\nI feel like I've given Whole Cakes many chances to improve the taste and quality of their product but the wow factor for each cake falls short every time.

I ordered a crepe cake, a special request from my son on his bday.  I should have had it shipped from Lady M but decided to give this a try. Their version doesnt have a caramelized top, the edges of the crepe cake where showing.  I was very very disappointed when I got home and got a first look. It looked so sloppy.  I requested them to put a special  Happy Birthday decoration on the cake.  I was hoping they would decorate it similar to what they have pictured online but no they did not decorate it at all.  All they did was a measly Times Roman lettering \"Happy 15 Chris\".   They forgot to write birthday.  It should have been Happy 15th Birthday!  They went extremrly minimalist with nothing but just small letterings.  It was pathetic and very disappointing for the amount of money I paid.  I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking at celebratory cakes, no creativity.  All they got going is the \"organic\" theme.

And now that I have had the opportunity to try two different flavored cakes, I have a better review to give. \n\nFirst story: I came in this store three weeks ago (after previously stopping in front of this facility several times) to try a slice of the green tea cake ($6). One thing that stood out was how light the cake was, which I favor because that's what I grew up on for every birthday. The flavor was very subtle, and contrary to what some people have noted, it wasn't dry at all. After asking the sweet girl at the counter about the different types of Asian-like light cakes and getting them sufficiently answered, I made the decision to come back soon.\n\nSecond story: This past Monday after work, I came into this store and asked Sonya for an 8\" Very Berry Blueberry cake ($45), initially for Thursday for my coworker's birthday. However, upon finding out the day before that she would be off on her actual birthday, I rushed over to the store the next day in low-key panic mode to ask Sonya if she could have it ready by this morning (Wednesday). Rather than refuse me on the spot or even charging me a rush fee, she told me that she would have it ready by 11am today. \n\nAnd sure enough, at 11:25 the sweet girl (note to self: GET HER NAME) called me saying that the cake was ready! \n\nThank you Sonya for coming through when I needed it. \nAnd while I promised you that I wouldn't be coming back again...I just want to say that I lied.\n\nI'll probably be back next week, if not sooner.

They are located close to my office so for convenience, we started ordering cakes from here earlier this year. This first cake was the blueberry. Everyone liked it, so we decided to order from them for upcoming birthdays in the office. The second cake we bought was the chocolate cake with the raspberry. It was just meh. The cake itself was dry and the cream had a little bit of a weird texture to it as if it wasn't fresh. We still decided to give them another chance because it could have been an off day.\nWell, the third order is what prompted me to leave this review.\nI called on a Wednesday to order the strawberry vanilla cake for pickup on Friday - our office only celebrates birthdays on Fridays. On Thursday, a lady called from the store saying that they've been waiting all day for me to come pick it up. I informed them that it was to be picked up on Friday and not Thursday. She said my mistake I'll see you tomorrow. After I hung up I had this gut feeling that I should have called them back to make sure that they'd be making a fresh cake for me on Friday,but I didn't call because I expected that they definitely would not want to give me a day old sponge cake. \nWell, lo and behold, I arrive on Friday to pick up the cake and I could immediately tell this was the day old cake, so I asked the lady (I think it might have been the owner) if it was the same cake they made the day before and she said yes it was. I asked her why they didn't make a new cake for me and the lady said that they typically make the cakes the day before for all pre orders and that it was better for the cake to sit for a whole day for the cream to set... Now i'm not a baker, but this sounded a bit sketchy and lazy to me. \nI noticed some of the strawberries on the outside of the cake were rotting and browning. I pointed it out to her as I do want to bring back a cake with rotten fruit to the office. She told me that they have some quality issues with their fruits because they are organic... hmmm, I believe it was because she just left the cake refrigerated all day Thursday and Friday and organic fruit doesn't hold up well. She exchanged the two rotting strawberries with new ones and gave me the same cake. I took the cake because I had no other choice, but this didn't sit well with me at all. I googled about sponge cakes and it turns out they are to be sold fresh, not a day old, and that they are not to be stored in any regular refrigerator if you want it to stay tasting fresh.\nI am very very disappointing with how they handled this situation, especially for a place this pricey. They proudly serve day old cakes for people who pre-order and expect a fresh cake baked that morning. If she bakes the cake a day before, that would mean they sold me cake that was baked on Wednesday. Expensive places should deliver better quality and service!\nTSK TSK.", "author": "Mamie S."}

There were a few times that the cake itself was too dense to a point we thought it didn't cook through. I called to complain but didn't receive any apologies. I didn't bother to bring it back as I had no faith in their customer service. And this time they really lost me as customer. Because I called Friday morning to pick up a cake that's available, I requested them to write a happy birthday sign on it. The girl who picked up the phone just told me no and refused to check with the chef. I knew the chef is always in the store. It would only take her a min to write the letters in jam. She did it before, several times. But they just couldn't do it and the answer was without empathy. I'm not entiredly mad because of the no.

The service was not overly friendly and the coffee tasted a bit bitter.\n\nI went in a second time and figured I should try one of their baked goods, as that seems to be what they are known for. I went in around 7:40 a.m. on a weekday, which doesn't seem super early to me; however, they had very few baked goods to choose from. I tried some sort of citrus pistachio cupcake that was $3.50. I literally ate the whole thing in 1 bite. It was more like an extremely expensive brownie bite compared to a large muffin. The flavor was OK, but the price and size was what disappointed me.\n\nAdditionally, their small menu states they have COLD BREW COFFEE; however, I waited for at least 5 minutes as the workers frantically searched for ice. They couldn't find ice, so they served me luke warm coffee with cold water added to it. Needless to say, it tasted gross.

I have a birthday event for 10 this weekend so thought I would wow my party with this wonderful chocolate cake. I called to order and asked if they have the same cake as the pieces that they sell and they said yes they do how many people? I answered 10 people so she said I will need an 8 inch round which they do happen to have. I asked again..this is the same cake as the one that you sell the slices of. Yes. Go to pick up the cake that afternoon and am surprised that the height of the cake is half the size.I say is this the cake? She says yes.. I say its so short..she says well..\"We make a larger cake (which is really just a normal sized cake) for the slices because we charge 6.00 per slice\"? Ok...I'm thinking..I'm paying 50.00 for half the cake that I thought I was. So I pay (my bad as I should have said forget it) and go on my way. Looking at the cake when I get it home and it just kind of bothers me..Yes, it is the same cake but not a normal size cake.So, I call this morning just to tell them that I really didnt think this was right and suggest that they inform people in the future but never got a chance. She was so argumentative from the get go that I never even got to finish my point..It does make a HUGE difference, especially for a special event. All she wanted to do was argue the point that \"it is the same cake\". Hmm..not really...\nI finally hung up because this woman does not know how to listen. She calls me back to tell me that she wants to do the fair thing which was to make an 8 inch full size cake sometime next week and then I should come in to see her to compare the size. REALLY?? Shall I save a piece of my already too small cake to bring with me to get an accurate comparison?.\nHow is that being fair? She says well..\"You said it doesnt taste the same! I say..well if you were really listening you would know that I never said any such thing. The cake is still sitting in my refrigerator because the event is not until tonight so I have not touched it! More arguing..I finally hung up again. Wowie, zowie! Done with this place. I will never step foot in there again. All I was trying to do was give them some good business advice. From now on when somebody orders a chocolate cake or any other cake that is only half the height of the slices they sell they should let them know beforehand.. So, I recieved \"half\" the cake that I thought I was getting and paying for AND it is not enough for party of 10. I now have to go buy something else. Anybody who wants chocolate cake you should buy the slices..otherwise you will get a very tiny short piece and I'm kinda guessing they wont be as good because I dont believe you can get the same taste out of a 3 inch cake!!!

I have not tried their food and quite frankly do not plan to. \n\nContext: I desperately needed to buy a birthday cake by the end of the day and saw on yelp that this place was close by. I stopped by during the afternoon. (I myself am a short teenager who had my backpack with me).\n\nI walked inside and was quickly greeted with a simple \"Hi\"--great. There were two people behind the counter (the cake chef herself who was frosting some cakes and a cashier person doing some stuff in the back). I looked around and realized that the cakes were smaller than they looked on their website. There were a couple 6\" cakes lying around in the counter--some frosted, some not. I asked the chef if I had to order cakes in advance and whether a cake could be made by the end of the day if I ordered one at that very second. She stopped what she was doing and gave me the \"up and down\" look and very sharply replied \"No. We carry some of most popular cakes for walk-ins. People have to order 2 days in advance.\" Her attitude and tone was very unpleasant and I felt quite uncomfortable--okay, I really need to get a cake so I'll just get one of the small cakes they have on shelf. They kept their eyes on me as I looked through the glass counter. \n\nA couple seconds later, an adult couple in their twenties walk in. The chef and the other staff's  attention quickly turn towards them. The staff greeted them very politely and asked if they needed any assistance. Both the staff made chit chat with the couple and described to them all the goodies they had. I was left alone, just hanging out behind the counter looking at cakes by myself. No ugly stare was given to the couple and the attitude and tone of voice of the staff changed from snarky to super friendly and nice. \n\nWHAT?!?! Their customer service changed completely within the course of less than a minute. After the couple left, I was still by myself just looking at cakes. The cashier person then asks \"Are you going to get anything?\" very abruptly. DID SHE JUST SAY THAT TO ME? Flabbergasted, I walk out of there hearing some faint remarks about me as leave the bakery. \n\nI am in disbelief about how they treated me compared to their other customers. Would not recommend this place to anyone (even if their cakes are out of this world).", "author": "Anna H."}

They only had one cake in the size i wanted and that was not the kind of flavor i was hoping for. I had read great reviews and had planned the whole birthday in my mind, from flowers, to cake to dinner in my head that when I saw that they didn't have any other options that i'd like, available -  I just stood there dejected and sad. Like really sad with a sad face. ( I know, over-dramatic!) \nAnd I think they realized that too, the sweet sweet girl behind the counter asked me if I could come back an hour later, I asked why? She said, she bake one for me!!!! Imagine that!\n\nShe asked me what kind of a cake did I want - I said chocolate and berries. She said sure. And Finicky that I am, I asked to ensure she didn't put any black or Raspberries in there. She said sure! I was still kinda wary if she'd be able to do that in an hour or not. I told her to make sure it was ready in that hour since I had to catcha bus home. Not a problem, she said! An hour later, I went back in. And lo and Behold! The perfect Cake I wanted for my hubby dearest!  \nHe loved it, said, it was one of the best cakes, he'd eaten in a while! And the fact that it was specially baked for him!  The taste was perfect, the decoration - impeccable like their other cakes!\n\nBut what bowled me over, was the fact that she saw that look on my face and told me she'd bake a cake and get it ready for me - even when she didn't have to!!\n\nGirl, you've got a customer for life now!!", "author": "Twinkle T."}

In that way, it's very compatible with some Asian palates. I like getting the slice of chocolate cake that has raspberries and whipped cream ($5). It's a little bit like a black forest cake. I've also gotten a whole cake for my friend's birthday. They always keep a few around so you can just walk in and buy a whole cake without pre ordering. However, if you want a particular cake and a name written on it, you have to order at least 24 hours in advance. A friend also ordered cupcakes from here for her birthday and they were amazing. The frosting was not buttercream, but not whipped cream either. It was somehow lighter than buttercream (which can be a little heavy because it's just butter and sugar), but had more body and depth than whipped cream. The quality of these cakes is very high and the rent must be high as well, so expect to pay accordingly.", "author": "Cat M."}

So far I have had the coco-nib banana muffin, the cheesecake, the oatmeal choco cookie (I am butchering this), and the strawberry shortcake.  Muffins change often.\n\nI first came in a few days after they first opened to get a coffee after Special Xtra had closed.  I have returned here almost daily since.\n\nFor those around 1st and Mission, this is a great place to buy your coffee in the morning.  The service is friendly, and De La Paz Coffee is smooth.  They give both a single cup drip option and a pour coffee option.  Both utilize different beans, and having had both, I have recommended them to others.  There is no option for espresso because Starbucks has a moratorium on espresso based drinks within a block - if you want those you have to go to Special Xtra (which I still frequent),  That said, I try to come here as much as I can - because we need good options for downtown, everything has been great, and I want this place to succeed.\n\nLast, for those of you who are looking for a birthday cake for your co-worker or boss, this is the best option I have found.  I have had cakes from every shop in the vicinity - Tart to Tart, Cafe Madeleine, Miette, and Anderson Bakery.  This is by far the best I have had around here - not too sweet and made with great ingredients.  An added plus for the Financial District - they are reasonably priced.", "author": "Kapeli M."}

I want to like this place, I really do. \n\n5 stars for Chocolate Raspberry.\n3 stars for strawberry vanilla.\n1 star for price. \n\nAvg. 3 stars. \n\nSuggestions: \n\n1. Your packaging looks sublime. But 50 cents out of my $5 is likely going towards it. Try using something cheaper. \n\n2. Have a credit card min. to encourage people to use cash. \n\n3. Don't price in tax.\n\nbetween 1, 2, and 3, you might be able to get your cost down to $4 or at the very least avoid the $5 sticker shock people have when they see a 1 inch slice for $5. \n\n.", "author": "S G."}

Sonya was amazing, helped come up with a design that made my boy say 'wow!' and our guests of all ages heading back for seconds! We had the double chocolate cake with strawberries and raspberries. Based on the number of people who asked where it was from (& the fact that the platter was practically scraped clean), it was a HUGE success. Thank you Sonya & family - you helped make this birthday very special!!", "author": "Meghan C."}

You generally expect only the cake to be amazing, but from start to finish the entire process was amazing. The owner/chef is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet and truly cares about her customers. It was really simple to place the order and she personally delivered the cake to us. \n\nThe whole family loved the cake, even though some family members don't always eat desserts. The cake made my mother's day special! \n\nThey're opening a store in the Mission soon and I can't wait to visit.", "author": "Saad S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-15", "description": "I was surprised to see how small a $35 6-inch Sweet Potato cake is in person. The cake is simply decorated and so short. Each layer is about 1-1.5 cm high and the cake had 4 layers total -- 2 layers of cake and the top and middle layer of filling. The chunky sweet potato paste is starchy and slightly sweet. The chunks might be softened nuts or bits of sweet potato? One surface of the cake was dipped in almond flavoring. The taste is interesting and great for those who don't like sweets. I had planned to try the other unique cakes, but after seeing how this cake was constructed so sparingly, I don't plan to return anytime soon.", "author": "Ann H."}

So much so that two weeks later I have now placed my 2nd order for a cake from Whole Cakes.  The cake the first time was the basic vanilla cake with fresh strawberries and it was DELICIOUS!!!  I highly recommend it.  I'll try the second one soon and i ordered the triple choclate this time which Sonya told me is her best seller.

Whole Cakes are light, fresh tasting, not-too-sweet, full of flavor (chocolate with raspberries in this case) and beautiful.  All organic. No dyes. Whipped cream frosting instead of that icky, greasy fake stuff on most bakery cakes.\n\nThe adult crowd at the graduation party where our cake was served absolutely raved.  \n\nAdd to the cake itself, the service and delivery were flawless and working with Sonya (the chef owner) and her staff was a delight.\nHence the 5 stars.  Whole Cakes makes pretty much the perfect cake.", "author": "M. G."}

This is the second time I've bought a cake from Sonya and I can always count on her to create beautiful, delicious, and perfectly balanced cakes.  This time it was for my sister's future sister in law's birthday and the future in laws' entire family (grandma, aunts, uncles and more) were going to dinner with all of our family for the first time.  High stakes so I knew the only person I could count on to impress the future family was Sonya and she exceeded our expectations. We received so many compliments around the green tea chiffon cake being so light yet flavorful and moist...most people could not believe there was no butter! \n\n\nIn addition, Sonya has amazing customer service. I am often changing logistics last minute and Sonya has always been very kind and accommodating to my strange schedule. The online order system is also fantastic and so easy to use.

I don't want to love their muffins, but I am weak when faced with their tastiness.   Light, fluffy, yummy, omg - so good.  \n\nI work a couple of buildings over from their new (pretty & light) shop.  Some of the people I work with have brought their goodies in---   I've tried some of their cake slices - YUM! but, I can usually resist cake.   \nThen their muffins were brought in... \nAs I said - light, fluffy, tasty & totally addictive.   The first one I tried was a Dark Chocolate Walnut muffin.  What?? This has less sugar and less butter? How is it soooo good? Must be magic.  Tried their Yogurt Oat muffin.  It was good, but I like stuff in my muffin, so it didn't do wonders for me.  It was good - I just wanted more.    Today I stopped by to pick up our Friday muffins & they were so nice!  We had two new ones -- Dark Chocolate w/ Cacao Nibs  & Blueberry Oat...   Amazing!   \n\nI don't know how she does it, but they are just so darn good!

I work in Financial District and the reviews for Whole Cakes were very good. I called them and said that she is a chocolate lover and what would they recommend - they said the double chocolate raspberry. This had good reviews so I said sure, ordered it and paid for it. Showed up at agreed time the next day to pick it up and was told \"Oh, we sold your cake - someone came in and needed one. Can you come back in an hour.\" WTF? I bought and paid for it, they made it, and someone came in and they took the \"Happy Birthday Justine\" lettering off (it was on pieces of white chocolate) and sold them my cake?  I could see the lettering in their display case.  I could not come back in an hour, I had meetings the rest of the day. They offered to deliver it by 4:30, so I said OK - what else am I going to do at that point?\n\nIt was delivered, I took it home and my fiancee did like it. The cake was actually pretty tasty, very much to my liking (not too sweet), but was not very chocolately - not sure where the double chocolate comes in. The cake I would probably give a solid 4.5, the shop was cute, the packaging very nice, the price what I expected. But selling a cake I had already bought and paid for to someone else? I was totally put off for the rest of the afternoon- did not need my stress level raised at that point.", "author": "Richard K."}

I ordered 2 cakes for the holidays (for both my immediate and extended family). I am particularly picky about the quality of the cake I eat, from the texture to the flavor, and Whole Cakes did not disappoint. I initially looked at all the other reviews, and seeing that the company got almost always perfect reviews, I decided to go for it even though I was hesitant of the cost. Do NOT get deterred from ordering from Whole Cakes because of this BECAUSE it is worth every penny from the cake to the service. The cakes themselves are delicious and OH SO BEAUTIFUL (like art basically). I think that Sonya, the owner, makes sure that they look beautiful and that her clients are happy. Every time I contacted her, she replied almost immediately and also quite friendly. I also love love LOVE her mission to make healthier cakes and I am all for it! She is super sweet with a great mission, so I say if you have doubts, just go for it because you will not be let down. She even sent me an email asking if I have suggestions to make it better (and thats when you know that she truly does take clients' feedback seriously). My dad who normally stays away from sweets ran to the fridge to grab cake because he too LOVED it! Even my grandma (75 and going) loved it and enjoyed that after eating the cakes, she didn't feel heavy or weighed down. My family is definitely going to order cakes from her for any and every occasion!", "author": "Sophie D."}
