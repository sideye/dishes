Visiting this incredible little gem will leave your entire being suffused with fresh oxygen and an uncommonly grand high from the terrifically humidifying Divine botanical specimens!! No sweet leaf needed, heh heh. Olde Ozzy Osborne song....  Each room has its own version of plant paradise, with scented and unscented flowers and other showy hot-to-trot plants that I had never seen in person before. I could spend hours in here wandering around reading, writing, playing my flute, praying and praising and traipsing around, were it not for the other visitors who sometimes make it difficult to move around. Not their fault for having the good 'scents' to come here! \n\nSo very inspirational!!! I truly think that a place like this raises your vibrational frequency.\n\nThis domed dream may be no big whoop to people who are not that interested in horticulture, so please don't drag them here. There are plenty of other things to do and see in Golden Gate Park! \n\nThe people who work here have been brainwashed by the plants to take on a kinder aura. \n\nOrchid delights abound ici! \"Orchid\" was one of my favorite Crayola crayon colors when I was a kid. I'm one of those women who loves shades of purple. Okay, I will stop rambling now.", "author": "Chanda M."}

The all-white landmark becomes a canvas for an illuminated spectacle of beautiful flowers and various art and it is way cool! This all happens outside the Conservatory!\n\nLights. Cameras. Action! This year's summer installation called \"The Surrealistic Summer Solstice\" was produced by Dawn Holliday with the musical direction of Dan \"Lebo\" Lebowitz. The various flower displays were just awesome eye candy! We thoroughly enjoyed the series of scenes on display and had so much fun admiring the art, recording video, setting up our boomerang shots, and snapping selfies. All for the gram!\n\nThe installation was first launched in honor of San Francisco's city-wide celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love in 2017 and it now runs nightly from sundown (around 7:40pm) to midnight through August 28, 2018.

This place is located close to Golden Gate Park, at Inner Richmond aread. Once you enter the area, you will be greeted by a large, green stadium where you will be making a right turn where you will see flower area right in front of the building. Such a nice spot to take some afternoon walk, or just to snap some pictures. \n\nInside the building is more like a green house filled by mostly tropical plants, orchids, tropical flowers, potted plants, and the most sought flower, the \"corpse flower\". There is some interesting history behind this corpse flower. When we visitted the corpse flower, it was not very smelly. And one of the worker also gave a brief history about the corpse flower. \n\nParking is on the curb, not too busy during weekdays. But it could be hectic during weekend.", "author": "Maureen M."}

You walk through several sections of the large greenhouse to see different varieties of plants. Depending on the time of year, you get to see different flowers. If you aren't too interested in flowers, it might be a tad bit boring.\n\nI've been here several times. One time they had a butterfly exhibit where beautiful butterflies flew around inside one section of the greenhouse and you could walk among them. Some even landed on us.\n\nToday, I went to see the rare Suma the Titan, commonly called the Corpse Flower because it smells like a rotting corpse when it first blooms.

It's been ages since I've been inside and I had been wanting to visit for a while now. Now that I no longer live in the city, I had to pay the $9 non San Francisco resident entrance fee. I thought that was a little steep but with every type of cost in the city on the rise, I should not have even been surprised. Still a little high for my liking. \n\nI really enjoyed the plants inside the structure and the displays outside. Golden Gate Park is beautiful and evokes many memories of my childhood. The Conservatory of Flowers is certainly a landmark most are familair with at GGP. It was especially nice that Sunday as JFK Drive is close to public vehicular traffic. Everyone was free to roam on their bicycles, roller skates and skateboards.\n\nThe Butterflies & Blooms exhibit was awesome. It was cool to see all the butterflies about to come out of their cocoons and the ones inside room where they could fly about in safety. Very cool display. I also liked seeing the orchids and lily pads. The landscaping outside and the Dahlia Garden is also really cool. The flowers they have in that section are beautful.

Still, let's be forthright here, I can only take about an hour, or less than, of delight in such a place -- and a lot of that time is used to compose the perfect future Facebook picture. There are connected rooms, but there's only so much square footage before you've seen the whole place. I cannot find my spot and sit in tranquility, as I might have hoped, because there were too much bumper to bumper groups of people walking in front of me. I did find my one spot where I might have spent five minutes, but it's also easy to get fidgety here and I was back up on my feet. That's just me, maybe.\n\nSince the Conservatory is found in the Golden Gate Park area, it is always a bit chilly, a bit nippy on most occasions. Yet it is too darn warm inside the atrium because those temperatures are needed consistently for most plants to thrive. So do come to the area with the proper layering of outfits, a sweater you can take on and off. If there is an added bonus of glee to the experience, it is the rolling lawn out in front of the premises. #goodtimes", "author": "Sean C."}

Walk around the outer gardens of the Conservatory and you'll find selfie heaven with lavender and red flowers.\n\nIts cool how you can experience several microclimates walking among the rooms - it'll get hot and humid in the tropicals and then cool and pleasant in the aquatic plants section.

One enters the sort of forechamber where the pupe, resembling little dead leaves, are hanging on wee sticks behind glass in the hut. Their camouflage helps make them look less appealing to hungry predators & undiscerning visitors. The standing area in front of the hut shows 3-D information on how butterflies come to be. It's both eye-catching & informative.\n\nStep beyond the mesh 'doors' and be transported into a warm & cozy area with piped-in ambient sounds of nature mixed with soft strains of music. Its over all effect is calming. There's a koi pond in one corner and a variety of butterfly-friendly plants flank the walk space. The butterflies are everywhere one looks.

The lotus exhibit at the very back of the building is my second-favorite because of pretty lilies growing in a pond. \nI gave it a 2 star because they didn't have my favorite butterfly exhibit, and also they feature lots of greenery (which is still interesting!) but I'm a flower-person. I love wisterias, peonies, lotus sutra, ect., but the Conservatory of \"Flowers\" mainly consist of greenery and species of orchids. However the staffs are always helpful and very educated about every plant there, the place is very clean (no more on-going construction) and there are a quite a few interesting plants you never thought of. Not until I know that there will be a butterfly exhibit, I'll be hanging out at the CA's Academy of Science. \n\nIf you want to still be surrounded by butterflies, you can visit the California Academy of Science's Osher Rainforest.

Into my mind popped a vision of my oldest son here, trying in vain to think of something, anything, to say about the plants and flowers he'd be viewing on the most silent first date in history.  I not only don't think this is a first date place; I think it's a place best enjoyed solo.  \n\nBut that's just me.  \n\nThe Conservatory of Flowers is pint-sized when compared, say, to the botanical gardens in Rio.

Coming here high wouldn't be a wholly bad idea.  \n\nHaving walked in the park for a couple of hours prior to coming to the Conservatory I was in the right mindset to enjoy it for what it is.

Well, bring proof of being a SF resident, a senior, or a student and you can gain entrance at a reduced admission price which might leave you more enthusiastic.  \n\nIf you're in the right mindset the Conservatory is a great place to visit but not a great place for a first date.", "author": "Tracey A."}

The next exhibit on succulence will open a few weeks later. \n\nThis is a very cute and quaint place that would be great for a date because taking some chick to Dolores park after eating at Ike's place is so 2013. The flowers are pretty and I like how it smells in here. You feel inspired to create your own luscious gardens if God gave you a green thumb. We need to support these types of industries. \n\nIt's very easy to walk around here. No drinks allowed so make sure you finish all of your bubble tea before throwing it away in the trash can to your left as you enter.", "author": "Jerry B."}

Ordered from England as a kit and assembled and given to the city, it's been a landmark since 1878. A team of volunteers lovingly maintains this building and everything in it. Don't touch the plants! It's SO HARD not to but you understand why they say it. With as many visitors as it gets, they would be ragged. Kids, touch with your eyes.\n\nNot unusual to find oneself freezing in San Francisco, a group of us headed here one weekend to warm up. Sure, you could sit in a bar and have a drink, but it isn't as magical as entering a tropical wonderland. It isn't a huge place, you can be done with it in an hour, but everything is so artfully arranged that you'll spend that hour in awe at the beauty of nature. It's worth noting that it gets hotter in here in accordance with the outside temperature so in summer there will be more blooms but it will be much hotter as well.\n\nIt costs $8 to get in or $5 for seniors, students and S.F. locals with I.D. There is a small snack cart outside but basically this is a standalone experience. The gift shop has a few items of interest but won't detain you. What might is the smashed penny machine in the lobby that attracted quite a bit of attention when we were there.\n\nPhotographers -- this is a fantastic place to take photos! Colors, details, patterns, textures. Incredible light. It can be a little crowded on weekends but people are very accommodating and polite in the calming presence of plants.\n\nI saw a pineapple growing and cocoa pods on a cocoa plant, two things I'd never seen. I didn't know pineapple was a bromeliad! So cool. The last room has a changing exhibit and this trip is was How to Survive in the Tropics ala Gilligan's Island. It was so fun and whimsical, I really loved it. Totally entertaining and educational. \n\nThis room has a resident turtle who poses for pictures on a rock and goldfish who gulp air in unison. I thought this was really cute until I Googled it and found that it indicates water with too much ammonia from fish poo in it. UGH! I don't like any animals in captivity and while they're cute, I'm not sure the conservatory needs these fish. Volunteers -- please investigate!", "author": "Angelique L."}

The inside has about 5 rooms with different climates and an array of plants. I like how well-marked all the plants are, and some even have signs next to them so you can learn more. The stand-out for me was the giant lily pads that are apparently so strong that a child can stand on them! Lots of other interesting flowers and plants to see as well. I just wish it was a bigger conservatory. My boyfriend and I got through it in less than an hour, which was a bit of a letdown, since the greenhouses at my college are bigger than that. The nice part about this place is that it isn't too crowded, but it's so small that I don't think they could accommodate more people.\n\nI forgot my student ID so it was $8 for me, but $6 for my boyfriend. Sadly, I don't think this place is worth all that money. Not to say it's a waste of time, but I would definitely recommend it more if it was $5 rather than $8 for regular admission.", "author": "Katie H."}

Located in the Golden Gate park lies a white colored green house called the Conservatory of flowers. There is a admission fee which isn't too terrible. First off before you go in, realize where you are about to enter is NOT San Francisco weather at all! More like tropical/warm weather. So take those clothes off! ( I meant just your jackets not everything because this is not a nude colony).\nThere are 5 sections here. First is the middle section which is a amazonian type forest. It is a circular room full of trees and lush plants.\nHeading to the right from walking in from the entrance will take you to the rain forest setting. This room is more of a archway and the plants are in the middle of the room surrounded by two walkways on each side. These plants are unreachable due to them coming from one floor lower than the walkways. You might get some water misted on your face so do not freak out, the conservatory is not on fire. \nHeading into the room directly in front of you will be Asia settings where there is a giant pond chest knee high packed into a pool like structure. The plants are far more close by than in other rooms therefore giving you better selfies with plants (make sure get their good side!)\nBack to the main entrance going to the left this time. This room is an open room connecting the main room unlike the others where it is divided by a door. This has a neat little garden area with a circle structure with plants surrounding in where you can look through the other side of the room. This room becomes fairly crowded here so depending on when you come there might be a lot of people.\nNow for the fifth and final room! This room depends what exhibition is going on at that time so make sure you look it up if you are interested in that particular area. Between the 4th and 5th room is their small gift shop where you can buy magnets and whatnot.\nI went during July so that was where the butterfly exhibition was going on. There are a few rules here and the workers get really touchy about these rules. For the butterfly exhibition only!\n1. Don't touch the butterflies as your oil on your hands will kill them\n2. Don't startle them\n3. Make sure to look around your clothes to see if they are trying to escape with you. \n\nBecause of the space constriction, this room is severely smaller than all the others.\nIf you love flowers are interested in a photo shoot , this place is an amazing area to get it down.\nI highly recommend visiting this place!", "author": "Jason H."}

Perfect area to pack a picnic and settle in the garden area for a snack or a nap.\n\nEasy to find the entrance and pay. Purchased a map of the park for an additional $3. Made for a great souvenir for the scrapbooker in the family (my wife). Entry is a great deal at the student rate of $6 person.\n\nUpon entry into the conservatory itself are instantly hit by the feeling of a rainforest. That is a great feeling in terms of the visuals you get (gorgeous, brilliant and lush flowers with pops of color as far as the eye can see). That is NOT a great feeling in terms of the wave of humidity that greats you at the door. This was expected due to the nature of the venue - flora don't tend to thrive in cold dry environments. I was prepared for my humidity filled experience but happy to leave the building for a breath of fresh, crisp air at the end.\n\nThe area is separated in 3 large sections. Going through all at a reasonable pace would be around an hour. Factor in additional time if you yourself are a shutterbug or you enter with a shutterbug. The additional time spent photographing flowers and plants is well spent as there are so many breathtaking flowers that stop you in your tracks.\n\nThe growth (overgrowth) makes navigation difficult as the pathways are small and you need to focus on not touching the plants. It makes it a challenge to maneuver in some sections.\n\nOrchids were rampant as presented in a plethora of colors and hues I had never seen before. Hibiscus as large as your hand! The sheer volume of the flowers and plants is incredible - every inch of the building is packed with a botanical wonder!\n\nThe ticket offers in and out privileges which makes spending time in their easier. Exploring one area and then stepping outside for a brief respite from the humidity makes the adventure more delightful!\n\nIt's a great respite from the constant bustle of the city - a small space of calm amidst the chaos. \n\n*Small gift shop located on the left hand side for those seeking souvenirs!", "author": "Sabrina B."}

It all begins with a ticket purchase... You then enter a huge room of tropical wonder, and the building branches off from here. There are separate rooms for different types of plants that need different  temperatures to thrive, and thrive they do! There must be an army of hidden elves that keep this place up and running because I only noticed 3 employees the entire time I was there.\nThere are a total of 5 different rooms: Aquatic Plants, Highland Tropics, Lowland Tropics, Potted Plants, and a Special Exhibit. The special exhibit while I visited was called Stranded Tropical Island Survival. They do offer free tours through some of the rooms, and the workers will walk through and inform as many people as possible the tour is about to begin so anyone who wants can partake. Maybe I should have done the tour, but I passed on it. Little regrets...\nI'd have to say my absolute favorite room was the Potted Plant room. There was such a variety of plants and flowers in this room, and the flowers were vibrant and plentiful. I believe I spent most of my time in here with the potted plants. There are a few benches in the room and if you can take the time to sit for a few minutes as the other visitors wander about eventually you will find yourself in the room alone, and only then can you really appreciate the beauty and the hard work it takes to keep everything alive.\nSome items that will keep me coming back to the Conservatory are the fact that they have a variety of flowers on the front lawn, so it will likely be different each time I visit, and it's always beautiful. They have different flowers in bloom at different times of the year, so that can make for an new experience each visit. Last, but not least, I'm a flower nerd.

It's also free the first Tuesday of every month and you can check http://freemuseumday.org/sf.html for other free museum days. \n\nWhen we first walked inside, it was really humid. There are three rooms filled with plants, flowers, and fish. There were a lot of interesting plants I had never seen before including a giant lily pad and carnivorous plants. There is also a room filled with butterflies and a box full of caterpillars. We watched around 5 caterpillars come out of their cocoons and become butterflies which was interesting to watch. We also took several pictures of the butterflies in our hair, on our clothes and on our hands and legs which was fun.

Opened in 1879, it's one of the finest examples of Victorian architecture in San Francisco. Not only is it the oldest building in the park, but it's the nation's oldest municipal wooden conservatory. With a central dome rising nearly 60 feet high and arch-shaped wings extending from it for an overall length of 240 feet, it houses an important collection of exotic plants. Sitting atop a gentle slope overlooking Conservatory Valley, it features projecting gables on its central rounded roof, stained-glass windows along the first story cornice, square Gothic corner towers and Oriental roof line.\n\nAt the beginning of each summer, the glass windows are white-washed to keep the UV levels down and protect the delicate plants against bright summer sun. Colored glass window vents around the building add variety to the tints of plants and flowers as the sunlight shifts during the day. The unique Victorian construction gives the greenhouse a whimsical feel with almost two thousand plant species represented in its floral displays (see photos). Even though the beauty of the exhibits can be astounding, the focus is really on conservation, illustrating the rapid changes in tropical habitats worldwide and spotlighting efforts currently underway to conserve these special places. \n\nJust finished there was a special exhibit recalling the the legendary Playland at the Beach. Now there's a new special exhibit that just opened this month and will continue through October, the Plantosaurus Rex. It's a replication of what plant life was like in prehistoric times with giant ferns, spiky horsetails and primitive cycads. There are model dinosaurs like the armored Stegosaurus foraging for the vegetation they loved best while learning about the symbiotic relationship between ancient flora and fauna. Obviously the Conservatory is putting in a lot of effort to broaden its appeal beyond seniors and wedding parties, and it's definitely worth the $5 admission for San Francisco residents ($7 for non-residents).", "author": "Ed U."}

Well, this place has your answer. Botany is the science of plants. I went here on a stroll through the Golden Gate Park after a morning in San Francisco, and my family decided to take a look at this place. The building itself is not really big, about the size of a really large house, but you could spend more than a couple hours here just looking at some interesting plants and learning about butterflies. \n\nThe butterfly exhibition was really cool. I haven't seen a butterfly in years, so it was great to see some butterflies fly around the building. I also got to learn a little about metamorphosis again, which is the natural process of a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. This place has a large collection of chrysalises (the \"transformation\" stage), so you can possibly observe a new butterfly coming out of its cocoon. \n\nAs for the plants, the fascinating plants that I found interesting were the ones from the Amazon jungles of Brazil and the jungles of Papua New Guinea. The lily pads and the flowers were really nice. You may need to be careful when you walk around, because you don't want to slip and fall into the small pools they have. There's a nice unique and fresh smell, which gave me the slight feeling that I was in a jungle somewhere. I also got to see some somewhat \"freaky-looking\" carnivorous plants, which are these plants that eat insects. These plants were called \"pitcher plants\". \n\nOverall, if you are really into looking at exotic plants and butterflies in a city like San Francisco, this place is a pretty good choice. Although I am not really that interested in plants, it was cool to get glimpses of exotic plants that I probably won't see for a really long time. It's also a great place to learn some facts, and it makes me wonder if being a botanist is really that fun.", "author": "Ambrose C."}

It makes sense in order to keep the flowers and greenery alive, but I would recommend to avoid coming during a warm day (not that you have to worry about that in SF for most of the year). ;) \n- No bathrooms inside the conservatory, only public bathrooms shared with park patrons are located outside. \n\nTip\n- Come on a weekday to avoid crowds, take your sweet time, and easily snag a parking spot right outside.", "author": "Tracy T."}

We met in San Francisco, we spent a lot of time in Golden Gate Park, and the Conservatory of Flowers was the perfect choice for a venue that provided beautiful views, an outdoor feel, and an iconic San Francisco landmark for our guests to enjoy. For those of you looking for a shorter review know this; our wedding reception could not have been more perfect. If we could go back and re-do our wedding 100 times we would always choose the Conservatory of Flowers over any other possible venue. \n\nThe Conservatory Manager of Special Events, Samantha Ordway, was an absolute pleasure to work with as she was extremely professional, provided excellent communication, and was attentive to everything we wanted for our wedding reception. She went out of her way to help coordinate the entire event and everything went off without a hitch. This went a long way in relieving our stress with wedding planning as we knew we could rely on her/her team's execution to get everything done just right. WE EVEN HAD PARK RANGERS PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THE EVENT!  \n\nOur rental included the entire Conservatory greenhouse for the cocktail hour as well as the Orchid Pavilion for our four hour reception. While we did not get to enjoy that much of the cocktail hour (busy taking photos), our guests raved about how beautiful all of the exhibits were and many remarked that it was the most beautiful wedding venue they have ever visited. We were very fortunate to have superb weather on the day of our wedding which made the photos we took out front of the Conservatory come out incredibly gorgeous. The setup of the Orchid Pavilion was ideal for a wedding of our size. We had enough room for all of our guests to sit comfortably while also fitting our taco bar, DJ booth, bar, and photobooth. All in all, we could not be more satisfied with our choice of wedding venues. The Conservatory of Flowers provided us an experience that felt authentic, unique, and was just a fun place to visit for all of our guests.

It showcases mostly tropical trees and plants, including an aquatic section. It's pretty warm and humid in there because of the tropical climate so make sure you dress in layers so you can peel them off. The walk paths are somewhat small and there are branches, vines and leaves everywhere, so it can feel a little claustrophobic. \n\nAll joking aside, there actually are other types of flowers in the Conservatory, but they're less obvious and can be hidden by the dense foliage. I was less impressed by them and more so by the giant Amazon lily pads and carnivorous plants.

It was a hypnotically chill place to spend a couple hours, and I am most certainly impressed.\n\nThe Conservatory of Flowers is composed of five rooms, each containing a varied array of plants.  They're in various stages of growth and bloom, from various parts of the globe, and the temperature of each room takes you from climate to climate.  In the first room there's a delightful little pond full of delightful little koi, but it also contains numerous plants that you may have encountered in your daily culinary adventures.  Banana trees, different kinds of palm trees, ginger, cacao, and vanilla beans are to be found all along the exhibit, some plants tiny and colorful, and other plants with leaves easily the size of an adult human being.\n\nBut it goes on!  There are plants named for their appearance, plants named for their region, plants named for the taste of their roots or fruits - exquisite plants, simple plants, large plants, small plants, aquatic plants, deadly plants (per their current exhibit) - I can honestly say I never got tired of looking at plants while I was there, and that's kind of remarkable for someone with my attention span.  \n\nI do wish that some of the plants had been marked a little better, as there are still some flowers of which I couldn't locate the names.  But I think that's also part of the charm - you're in a controlled wilderness, and barely-ordered chaos has never looked so beautiful.  I found myself itching to take pictures \"a la tourist,\" and just when I thought I might be getting tired of flowers, my eyes grew wide with the sight of something even more unreal and fairy-tale-like than what came before.\n\nIf you're into botany or horticulture, this is your place.  If you're not and you just want a place to kill a few hours, this is also your place.  It's a wonderland of green and heat and information, and you would be remiss to pass it by.", "author": "Becca S."}

Iconic from the outside ; and on the inside, a beautiful tropical oasis.\n\nBeing a native to the bay area I wanted to find the perfect place for my wedding.  After looking at various spots from around the city, we decided on the Conservatory.  \n\nEverything was perfect.  The venue, already filled with luscious plants and exotic flowers it doesn't need decorating.  Our wedding day in July was misty, cold and foggy, but our guests walked into the vestibule and entered into a different world.  There was room for people to wander and enjoy but not so big that people got lost.  There is an event tent nestled off to the side that you don't notice when wandering in the park, but is a great space that can be transformed into just about anything.  \n\nMorgan, the Special Events Manager was great.  She was helpful in working with us and our vendors and making sure that our questions were answered.  We found out months in advance what special exhibit would be up during our wedding (it was the Wicked Plants - poisonous plants in a Victorian setting, we loved it).   \n\nWe even got a chance to see the Conservatory at night.  Night time inside the Conservatory is dark with accent lights, the sound of crickets and slightly humid and warm which you never get in San Francisco.  This was one of the most magical things we suggested to all of our guests to experience at some point during the reception.  \n\nIf planning a wedding or other event is not in your future, do find a reason to go to one of their after hour programs - or go to the Gala in November - always fun and supports the Conservatory.", "author": "Jeanie M."}

Be sure to check out the Dalhia garden outside next to the building during the summer months. It has breathtakingly beautiful flowers. I honestly didn't know that flowers could be that large and colorful in real life. It is like they jumped out of a child's imagination into reality. So pretty. If you go early in the morning (or any day when the fog is still hovering over the plants) each flower will be covered in dew drops. *sigh* so pretty.\n\nInside the Conservatory is just a breathtaking. Each room has a different theme. I would caution against going on a particularly hot day because this IS a green house and it can get VERY hot and humid. So it is nice to be greeted by a cool breeze when you exit. Be sure to stop by the lily pond in the side wing and the orchid display in the adjoining room.

The Conservatory of Flowers  is expansive and impressive and quite easy to get to by many forms of transportation in the city.  The CoF houses a collection of rare flora which spans from simple foliage plants to rare orchids to bog and pond species.  If you are fan of visiting Conservatories, then this one must be on your bucket list.  They have neatly divided up the various wings to control the environmentals to support and encourage the plants to grow as if in their native habitats.  They do offer a guided tour which you can join at no extra charge if you arrive at the right times or you can choose to browse around solo.  I found the tour informative as the guide knew a lot about the history of the plantings but afterwards, I lingered to photograph some of the great items in the collection.

The more exotic, the better - they showcase their colors and naughty bits like nobody's business.  And I like it.\n\nSo, I decided to join my friends for a walk on the wild side with the Chomp exhibit.  \n\nOn the approach to the Conservatory, you definitely feel like you are in Kew Gardens, which is what it was modeled after.  It was constructed in 1878 and is the oldest building in GG Park.  I've been to Kew, and I have to say that the plants in our conservatory are healthier than theirs.  It is fair to say that the structure looks huge from the outside, but is pretty contained on the inside.  Still, she is a grand Victorian lady with a world of wonders underneath her skirt.\n\nNote that it is humid inside and strollers must be left at the door.  On a cold and cloudy day like today, feeling the moist, warm air was a welcome sensation.  Yes, I said moist.  And just like in a high-end strip club, you may look all you want but NO TOUCHING.  \n\nThe inside is divided into sections, such as Lowland Tropicals and Aquatic Plants.  There are descriptive signs and docents available to give explanation about the origin of the various species.  \n\nTo really enjoy the offerings here, make your eye like a zoom lens and look close.  Focus.  Look closer.  The architecture of nature is amazing.  The flirtatious flutter of a petal and the beckoning curve of a stamen serve the purpose of drawing you in, just like a happy little bee.  (see photos)\n\nDon't miss the display case of found exotic items to see the double coconut that looks just like an ass.  Or whatever you see, I'm not going to put any ideas in your head.\n\nThe Chomp exhibit is not full of giant Little Shop of Horrors man-eaters.  The carnivorous plants are small, but nonetheless interesting.  Attach yourself to a docent and learn about what they do, and how they do it. \n\nIt doesn't take long to walk through, and a ticket is $5.00.  A picnic on the lawn is a nice way to supplement your visit.\n \nIt's appropriate for anyone of any age, and good, clean fun.

It was hot and sunny out, I had been on my feet for hours, and the sign said butterflies. \n\nThe landscaping out front was covered with wedding parties doing photographs. It's a very San Francisco backdrop I suppose, but as I watched more than one bride hike up her skirts to get better leverage on the Bear's Breeches, my own resolve to elope in Reno (not vegas) some day was solidified.\n\nThe conservatory of flowers is the oldest public conservatory in the US, opened in the late 1800s. Thus it's more than a place to see plants; its tropicle jungle species crawl and bloom history. While not large, the old victorian structure is just beautiful, and strolling along the walkways between all the ancient and new plants it's easy to imagine people from all era's enjoying it here. It also has an Adams Family quality and could be a great setting for a man-eating plant story. Displayed notes from long-ago botanists, their specimens, and cases of indigenous plants add to the sense of science and adventure that's gone into this place for such a long time.\n\nIt was a hot day so the tropical environment inside was initially a little rough, but the moisture of the Amazon-type jungle helped. I've never seen such strange and beautiful orchids, and there were plenty of peaceful places to sit and rest. I did not see any butterflies; someone said it was too hot. Initially I thought it would be too stifling to stay long but even if you don't know anything about plants, the more time you spend the more interesting little things you'll notice blooming in the nooks and crannies. There weren't a ton of things blooming on first impression, but then I started noticing the green flowers and some super exotic blossoms which were camouflaged more like alien forest creatures. Wow! Read about the Amazon lilly, which invites hoardes of beetles in for a snack and closes on them while they perform sex change surgery on it!\n\nIf you're expecting a super slick highly funded exquisite botanical museum I'd say you need to ratchet your expectations, but it's apparent people have loved this place for nearly 150 years, and that some of the plants may have memories that long of their own.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

The only thing about the conservatory is that this place closes quite early. I believe we got there at around 3:10 and they closed at 4. It wasn't too bad because the greenhouse was only about 4-5 rooms wide so you can easily walk it in less than an hour.

I think the walk to the Conservatory is really relaxing.\n\nOnce inside, you get to explore the plants and you feel like you're one with nature :)\n\nIf you're not familiar with certain horticulture, it's okay because once you get to the main event (in my case, it was the carnivorous plants) you'll learn quite a bit simply by reading their stories.\n\nI had no idea that Abraham Lincoln's mother died of a white snakeroot!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-01", "description": "I went today because it was the monthly free day (first Tuesday of the month--otherwise it's $5). Unlike many other places that have free days, the Conservatory closely monitors how many people are inside at any given time, so it's never very crowded. This does mean you might have to wait a few minutes, but given that there were probably 40 people in front of me (including a camp group of 20 or so middle-schoolers), my 15-minute wait was very reasonable.\n\nInside, there is so much to see. There are five rooms: one for special exhibits (right now, it's butterflies--more on that later); another which highlights seasonally potted plants, such as they would have been presented at the San Francisco 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition; a third for plants from the lowland tropics (i.e. lianas, coffee trees, cycads), which is kept quite warm; another for highland tropics (such as ferns and orchids), which is kept relatively cool to be like a cloud forest; and finally an aquatic plant room, with all sorts of waterlilies, orchids, and carnivorous plants.\n\nThe current \"Butterfly Zone\" exhibit is great, both for adults and kids. There are many different kinds of butterflies and moths (though there were really only five or six that I saw more than one of). If you've ever wanted to know what kinds of plants butterflies like, this is the place to go. I was especially intrigued by the fact that many of the butterflies and moths really like to hang out on the glass doors. Also, there's a neat case that houses the chrysalises and cocoons of a number of different species. If you're lucky, you may get to see one open.", "author": "Katie I."}

But if I had to give a one-word review, it would be: underwhelmed.  The building itself is  interesting and beautiful, as are the grounds, but the actual botanical garden itself is extremely limited and small.  I mean, this makes sense, because it's all in that interesting, but small building, but I was *really* underwhelmed by the gardens.  I know I'm comparing this in my mind to other cities' botanical gardens (behemoth in comparison), which is unfair, because, fundamentally, this conservatory does a different job.  But really, it's just a very small experience, both in size and scope.  I saw a special exhibit there (the wicked plants one), that was well-designed, but (again) largely underwhelming.  Was it worth my $7?  No.  Did I begrudge giving my $7 to a flower conservatory no matter how underwhelming?  Not really.", "author": "Tarah D."}

I was a bit put off by the name, which makes it sound like a boring, stuffy place for older folks to hang out at on a Sunday afternoon. But it ended up being one of the highlights of our trip!\n\nIt's basically a giant terrarium, and you get to go inside! Being a science/plant/animal nerd, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, as did the significant other. We are both avid photographers and took easily a hundred pictures in there.\n\nRight away when you enter, the wave of humidity hits you (dress in layers and prepare to strip down!). I'm always cold so I rather enjoyed that part. I also really loved the fish pond that's there when you enter. The first thing many visitors saw that day was me, crouched by the pond, saying, \"Take a picture! Take a picture!\"\n\nThe orchid room was awesome. I've always wanted to grow orchids but haven't yet figured out how to turn my house into one big terrarium. When I do, it will look like this room does.\n\nThe aquatic plant room was cool, too. I saw those giant lily pads I've only ever seen on Discovery channel. Some of them are strong enough to support a child! (We read this, haven't tried it yet).\n\nThe potted plant room was really exciting to me, too, since my house/yard consists of potted plants in every nook and cranny. I've heard they rotate all the plants out so you see them at their peak. Everything we saw did look really nice.\n\nChomp! Carnivorous Plants was the rotating display when we were there. We saw more pitcher plants than you need to in a lifetime, but they were super cool. My favorite piece of trivia from the day was that rodent skeletons have been found in large pitcher plants! How can you say plants are boring after that!?\n\nAnyway, you don't have to be into plants or flowers to like this place. If you do, though, it will be just that much more awesome.", "author": "Jenny S."}

It was a good deal and I've always wanted to check this place out so we decided to go a few Saturdays ago.\n\nWell, first off I love the history of this conservatory, and the classic look of the building.  It's essentially a giant palace shaped green house : )  Many tropical flowers and plants, including those that are air plants and aquatic ones.  \n\nI loved the overall charm of this place... however I must say I was a bit disappointed to find out how small it was.  The green houses/domes at botanical gardens in my home country are ginormous.  I guess it was unfair for me to compare an older, classic structure as this one with those that are made of modern materials that could handle a larger size though.  \n\nSo yeah, I love that this place is still around, and I think it's super cute... but we pretty much finished looking at all the exhibited plants in a matter of 10-15 minutes... if we had paid regular admission of $7 per person, well, that money kind of burns up fast at this place.  You are welcome to sit on the benches inside and chit chat... however, this being essentially a green house, it was super hot and humid inside lol so we didn't feel like sitting around too much.\n\nThey also have a miniature SF/Thomas train mini model exhibited right now... it must be great for little kids but I've wondered how much more plants they could've fitted in that hall where they had placed Mr. Thomas lol.\n\nSo yeah, I can see it's a good place to go with your family.

I remember a time after I picked up a camera that I was fascinated by the tunnel in front of that white building but still, nary a visit within. Yesterday I went with a friend and made history by entering its mysterious glass walls, just a few decades late! It was sunny but nippy outside, so I kept on my jacket and I swear I never felt a sweat drop while inside, but I was \"slightly\" occupied. While I suffer from allergies from many things that include flora of all types, I did not have a problem. Recovered from my loss of voice while in Australia just a week ago, I was able to talk to the flowers to incite them to pose willingly for my camera. There are separate areas within the conservatory and as I explored each with my friend, I/we snapped many many flowers, as did many others. \n\nPHOTOGRAPHICALLY SPEAKING: No tripods allowed so don't take one. A nice zoom with a maximum of about 300 (which I use) will get you spying everything very nicely. Lots of unique colors and species so you won't be bored hauling your camera about. The only area you should worry about is the tropic area which has a high humidity level, which will fog your filter/glass in about 2mins after entering. I removed my filter as the fog will enter the space between filter and lens glass. Bring a soft glass-cleaning cloth to carefully clean your optics which should be okay about 10-15mins after your entry. Perhaps if the lens glass were \"heated\" by putting your camera within a warm spot (perhaps wrapped under your worn sweater/jacket) will warm the glass sufficiently so this won't happen? If you try this, please let me know if it works. I found myself using a ISO of anywhere from 400 to a high of 2500 to snap flora in the various areas with light, less light or none.\n\nTake a very careful look in each area - there are delightful small/big flowers at every step. There's no time limit so come early to enjoy the sights...  you won't regret it!!! Though the conservatory closes at 5pm, the very last entry is allowed till 4:30pm; don't wait till the last minute though: if you enter at the time you'll not have sufficient time to view all of the fascinating flora so go early!!!\n\nThere is presently a train exhibit, the 2nd Annual Golden Gate Express Garden Railway, that will please kids of all ages. While the train is standard fare, the train landscape is not. It consists of recycled materials to build a \"City\" named San Francisco. It features just about all o the SF landmarks - all created with recycled things!! This special exhibit continues through April 18, 2010. More information at http://www.conservatoryofflowers.org/atconservatory/special-exhibits\n\n$7.00 for Adults\n$5.00 for Youth ages 12-17, Seniors age 65 & over, and College Students with ID. \n$2.00 for Children ages 5-11 and FREE for Children ages 4 and under\n\n***Discounts available to all San Francisco City and County residents with proof of residency (i.e. bill, ID, etc)***\n\nOpen on Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, and until 2pm Christmas Eve.

It doesn't take too long to walk through all of the rooms, probably an hour at most.

We easily spent a couple hours strolling around and taking pictures until we got kicked out when they closed.  I left wanting to come back again soon to show friends this beautiful place in SF that might get a little overlooked in GG Park amongst the other museums.  I liked the low-key vibe here and the ability to find butterflies on almost every plant inside the room.  I'm also a fan on their facebook page and want to keep up with their new exhibits and activities.    Definitely a worth-while, relaxing activity in GG Park to be experienced, photographed, and enjoyed by all ages.  A great change of pace here if you need a break from the hustling city vibe and its tourist attractions/crowded museums.  Sidenote, lots of butterflies looked battered but not sure why.  Despite signs everywhere, I saw many children (AND adults too) touch and pick them up- Shame on you people!  I don't know why people can't just leave them alone to do their thing.", "author": "Alexandra P."}

We saved the best for last to go thru the wing with the Garden Railway.\nI took visiting family here specifically to see this exhibit and so glad I did.  It was amazing.   A model train, cable car, streetcars and more wind their way thru a landscape of dwarf plants and past mini replicas of the city's landmark buildings.\nGhiradelli Square, Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Chinatowns Dragon Gate,  PacBell Park, & Palace of Fine Arts are just some of the landmarks crafted from recyled and repurposed materials.  Creativity abounds in the artwork and in the plants that surround this mini city.  A couple times a day they have special effects with an earthquake and some fog that rolls in under the Golden Gate bridge and envelops the city.\nFirst Tuesday of the month is free.

On a sunny day I love sitting on the grassy slope facing the Conservatory and just admiring the scene (of course while music on my iPod kills the traffic noise on JFK Drive).  The outdoor displays are hit-or-miss; if you visit on a day they are changing the plantings you'll see nothing but roped-off mounds of brown dirt...but hit it when the bulbs and plantings are at high bloom, and the display of color can be beautiful.\n\nI am always impressed with the two \"artwork\" displays made of flowers on the sloped hill in front of the building.

The room with the orchids was ok, there were a few very beautiful flowers in there. However, there were also pots that had been knocked over and not righted, plants that looked like they had simply been chopped off in the middle, and plants that simply looked like they were about to die. The special exhibit room with the carnivorous plants was the biggest let down. It was half empty, and the plants that were there were smaller and less healthy than ones I've seen at hardware stores that sell plants.\n\nI can't help but wonder if the reason for all of this is the rude, disrespectful people that can't keep their paws off of the plants. There were kids running around sticking their fingers in the pitcher plants and squeezing the fly traps shut, and I even saw an adult lift one of the lily pads out of the water to take a look at the root system as if she didn't read the sign on the door that said \"don't touch\".\n\nBottom line though, is that my friend and I spent more time in the gift shop outside than in the Conservatory itself.", "author": "Vanessa R."}

For only $6 per person with Student ID, and kids 3 and under free, the $12 for us was worth it. There are several koi ponds that my 2.5 year old loved to watch. Beautiful orchids and other flowers abound as well as a variety of unusual exotic plants that I've never had the opportunity to see in person until now. We especially enjoyed the special exhibit with the model train set. It is true what their website says about no strollers. We had read that ahead of time and left ours in the car. However the place where they ask you to leave your strollers is indoors and there is an attendant there at all times. Had I brought my stroller, I would've felt comfortable messing it there. As soon as you enter the conservatory, it is clear why they don't allow strollers. The walkways are very narrow and frankly I'm surprised this place is considered wheelchair accessible. I think anyone in a wheelchair would find navigating the narrow passageways a challenge. Thankfully we arrived early and we're able to find a good free parking spot on the street right in front of the conservatory but those spots certainly go fast and I believe there is a 4 hour limit even on weekdays.

The one that is in the big white building, with all of the flowers out front, yeah, that one is the Conservatory of Flowers.

Its like a sauna and will melt the pounds away, especially if you pair it with a nice walk in the park and avoid all of the hot dog and ice cream vendors set up out front on the sidewalk. \n\nThey have orchids in here, many varieties of them, and mini Japanese landscapes built on slabs of marble. They also have carnivorous plants, but they will not eat the fat off your body so do not try to add that to your weight loss plan, those suckers only like water and insects. If you are lucky you will see an insect slowly dying inside one of the plants as it devours its lunch. They also have fruit trees, but you can't eat the fruit, even with the price of admission, so bring your own. \n\nSometimes they have a butterfly exhibit, but not while we were there. The price of admission is $5 with or without the butterflies so I felt a little jipped, but a random stranger asked me to be in their happy anniversary video card and I got to make out with my boyfriend next to a cool fern or two so I suppose it was a fair trade. If you don't get to do the latter two I would demand the butterflies, or, unless you are there to lose weight, it might not be worth the price of admission.", "author": "Drue C."}

Looking across the ridges and towers, one can see the influence of the Empire, in the echoes of Buddhist wats in the decoration.  One can see the British seafaring tradition, in the boxy bay window extensions in the odd corners.  One can see a sense of spirit as the white glass rises to a dome in the center.  One can see a sense of pride and craftsmanship in the hand-made detail.  \n\nThis palace was once destined for San Jose, but through a political affront was redirected to San Francisco.  It became a symbol of urban elegance, a jewel in the collage that inevitably appeared on the postcards tourists sent home.  The setting is positively European, and it looks much larger on the outside than on the inside.  \n\nThe interior is a collection of sealed chambers, presenting foliage from different tropical climate zones.  It is warm and humid in there, regardless of the weather outside.  \n\nThe Conservatory was destroyed in a wind storm in 1995, and lay abandoned until its restoration and grand reopening in 2003.  I was one of the thousands of contributors that funded the restoration, and I am very proud that this heritage landmark was not allowed to disappear.  \n\nThe plants inside are vibrant and alive today, including some of the originals.", "author": "David D."}

It made the exhibit almost like a hunt, not to mention we learned about the species we were looking at.

I like to sit on the pretty steps while my mom takes my picture. I even liked the nice Australian dudes that asked my mom out, although she was not impressed, I did let them pet me. I do have one bone to pick with you. I do not like the children who have enough space to run after me on the lawns. It is unecessary as I am only 7 lbs. (please refer to photos) I'd rather them pick your flowers or jump off your pretty little bridge.\n\nThank you.\nWeezer.", "author": "LJ S."}

While the space itself and its collection may seem small, several things expand the Conservatory beyond these bounds...\n\nFor one, almost every plant is a trip in itself.  If you look closely at an orchid, or a banana flower, or a venus flytrap, you'll keep asking more questions than you started with.\n\nSecond, the programming here is really great.  Go to their special events, especially the night time ones with catering and music, and don't miss when they have really wild stuff, like the blooming corpse flower!\n\nFinally, the architecture and design are totally charming.  The price of a year's membership is so cheap, I recommend just getting that so you can stop in whenever you're at the park... it pays off almost immediately.", "author": "Jessica M."}

From the outside, it's a slice of Victorian England; and when you step inside, you're transported to a tropical jungle. An adult ticket is $5. It's not a big place, but it's worth taking a long and leisurely exploration of the plants and flowers.\n\nI most recently visited on a Saturday. At the California Academy of Sciences across the way, there were long lines to enter the museum and to see its rainforest exhibition. The Conservatory of Flowers is less dazzling technically but more satisfying than the crowded exhibit in the CAS.\n\nUntil April 19, 2009, you can view the \"Golden Gate Express\", a model railroad that runs along some cleverly and whimsically designed models of city landmarks such as Coit Tower and the Ferry Building.\n\nThe Conservatory was nearly destroyed by a windstorm in 1995.

The interior of the building is very small, dated, and looks dirty. Windows are not clean, actually they are filthy, and the floor is cement and cracked. And when I went some back doors were propped open exposing trash and other throw away items behind the building.The plants themselves are nicely arranged but everything else just overshadowed that in my opinion. The staff seemed friendly and available. But it's just not worth paying anything to go here. Don't bother. Frankly, I was shocked by the condition of this place. And that Chomp exhibit that was on display when I visited was nothing special. It was just bunch of plants thrown in a dirty, dark corner of the building with some sound effects and large paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 props that looked like they were made in a high school art class.

Perhaps my visions of a Willy Wonka like room with flowers (instead of candy) as far as the eye could see was too much. \n\nI walked through the conservatory quickly as a once over (it is pretty small) and then waited for one of the free tours so I could get a more thorough understanding of what I was seeing. The conservatory certainly has a variety of very interesting plants, many of which do have flowers, but many which don't (or at least, they're all not in bloom at the same time, which is understandable). I think it is laid out very nicely, with a different theme for each room. Some of the orchids are very delicate and lovely - the bat orchid is very cool. I'm glad I took the tour because the tour guide pointed out things I wouldn't have noticed otherwise.\n\nI did also go to the Wicked Plants exhibit which was there and I didn't like it very much. I found it over-crowded, a bit too theme-y, and I was annoyed by how much text was on the signs. Each interesting plant had this whole story and all I really wanted was a clear sign that said what kind of plant it is and how it could hurt you.

But, they won't even land on your measly little harmless finger.  They're only going to be there for a limited time, so what are you waiting for?\n\nAll-in-all it was a nice little trip.  Everyone should go once, atleast.\n\nMikey says it's cool.", "author": "Steph and Mike A."}

It was a way of feeling the sophistication of being world traveled and exotic. Expeditions were sent out with botanists in tow, to gather plants, and as a result many plants were identified and named. Much of our taxonomic knowledge, and the start of modern botany owe some of their modern form to the worldy aspirations of 17th century europeans. (Zoos began in very much the same way).\nThe Conservatory of Flowers, built in 1878, is a gorgeous (and restored in 2003) example of the beautiful greenhouses that were constructed during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries to display exotic plants and flowers. This one is built in a dramatic victorian style, and is one of the architectural highlights of the golden gate park. It's a must see.\nVisitors notes: It tends to get hot, so going on a hot/humid/crowded day may not be the most pleasant experience unless you layer. The carnivourous plants and orchid exhibits were extremely nice.\nParking in golden gate park is restricted/annoying, so just be paitient and try to find something in the Haight.\nMore historical information here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Park_Conservatory_of_Flowers\n\nFree first Tuesday of every month.\n\nThis buildling made the 2007 Best 25 Buildings of the American Institute of Architects", "author": "Kat C."}

I don't know why I never went before. ( I had been on top of the conservatory many times usually between the house of 1am-3am in a drunken stupor, but that's a completely different store that I won't tell here) Anyway, I've just finished taking a photography class and now I've joined the monthly Salon group. Each time I Say I'm going to get my butt out there and take photos so I have something to share and each time I show up to the group empty handed. The next group is in two weeks so I thought I'd give the conservatory a shot (you can see some of the photos I've upload in the photo section.) It's $7 for adults and $5 for students. The place is rather small, it only took us about 35 minutes to go through the whole exhibit. And we tried to take our time. In that 35 minutes I was able to take around 125 photos. we went on a Saturday around 4PM and it was pretty busy. Lots of other people try to take photos, so sometimes I had to wait my turn. There were a lot of great photo opps and I enjoyed my time there. Not sure I would go back anytime soon. I think one time is plenty unless they change the exhibits.

Since he doesn't talk and he can't really move around much on his own, we basically just need cool stuff to look at. His mom told me about the Stanlee Gatti exhibit at the Conservatory. The photos on the website made it look grand indeed. So we ambled over to the park with bottles in hand and high hopes in our hearts.\nI've seen window displays at Pier One that were more inspiring than Gatti's sparse, contrived, over-the-top minimalist \"exhibit\". It's competing with the Metreon for the title of Biggest Waste of Space 2006. However, the rest of the Conservatory was out of this world entertaining for the midget and I. We asked for cool stuff to see and the Conservatory knows how to bring it. It's on the small-cramped end of the spectrum but the historic relevance of the site and building add a very charming touch. The water plants room rocked us hard and little munchkin totally had a few \"moments\" in there where he just stared at the water and grinned to no end. The potted plants room is appropriately located next to the Gatti/special exhihbits room and was only a little more exciting than the window-box herb garden in my mom's kitchen (sorry, mom!). It can be skipped.\nThe staff were extremely helpful and kind and the tours sounded like they were informative and substantial (though we didn't do the guided tour). There is stroller parking (as strollers are not allowed in the conservatory) and the staff are super nice to miniature visitors. I won't dock them more stars for the whole Gatti shenanigan.

Something about all the orifices, the colors the shapes---you get the picture.  And then you have the room with the butterflies fluttering around drinking in the nectar with their proboscis'.  They use this spiral, straw like appendage off of their head to suck in the sweet juices.  Me and a couple young kids were held captive by some hatching butterflies.  They came out learning to flap their wings.  Their cocoons were amazing.  Some looked like little jewels and others like leaves.  Nature creates the most wondrous things...\nBut practically speaking:\nInside it is warm---and humid!  The space is not very large but does the job.  I don't really like huge museums because I find them overwhelming.  This one you can visit for about an hour and still feel like there are new things to discover upon your return.  The architecture is odd to me because it seems to be grand from a distance but once you approach it and get close the roofs are actually not that high. The whiteness of it is pretty and makes me feel as though I am traveling through one of the first world's fair exhibits or that I am in candy land.

We are interested in a one stop shop for both ceremony and reception, anticipating guest list to be ~160 - 180 ppl.\n\nFirst off, I am a huge fan of the conservatory, it's uniqueness, San Francisco history, and flowers in general.  The conservatory was one my first thoughts as a potential wedding venue.  Luckily, my inquiry was a few days before their annual gala and I was able to check the venue out at night.\n\nThe pros:\n- The night lighting is exceptional.  The conservatory looks absolutely magical all light up in GG park.  Fairy tale for sure.\n- Uniqueness.  Love the idea of a wedding venue that functions as something else by day, and there really is nothing else that comes close for flower lovers in the botanical sense to the conservatory.\n- Photo ops.  Countless upon countless photo ops with the gorgeous array of plant life and the conservatory structure itself.  Not to mention GG park.\n- You aren't allowed to being many plants, etc, into the conservatory itself (which is understandable due to potential insects etc), but this really isn't an issue because the conservatory is already so decked out in plant life you really wouldn't need to bring much into the structure for decoration (although the orchid gallery is a different story).\n- Morgan, the rental manager is very sweet and totally helpful with event inquiries etc. \n\nThe deal breakers:\n- Capacity.  Only ceremonies of 50 ppl or less can be accommodated within the conservatory structure.  Supposedly the new orchid gallery can accommodate 150, although it seems like that would be tight once you consider a dance floor and bar.  Anything over this and you're looking at jerry rigging some tent to tent action which seemed complicated.\n- The grates in the walkways.  Ladies, am I glad I toured this space in my stilettos as I was on my tiptoes the whole time to avoid falling into the grates which line the walkways through the conservatory.  While this was noticeable, although not un-do-able for an hour, I think this would get super old for my guests, if not outright dangerous, especially after a few cocktails.\n- The narrow walkways and the dripping humidity in the gorgeous room with the carnivorous plants and lilly pads.  This is my favorite room as a visitor to the conservatory, yet when viewing from a bridal perspective I was ultra sensitive to the condensation water drops from the ceiling every few minutes.  Water spots on your gown = not cool in photos.  Also,  I could not really imagine navigating those narrow moss laden walkways in the other rooms in a large gown.\n- The port a potty bathroom situation and the walkway from conservatory to orchid gallery.  This was the ultimate deal breaker for me.   I drink a ton of water and have the frequent bathroom visits to match.  I expect this to be a legitimate issue while in a constricting and large gown on the big day.  This would be a huge headache here, even though the bathrooms are on the nice side of the temporary scale, I really don't know how this would work.  Additionally the port a potties are totally visible in the walkway from conservatory to gallery as are recycling bins etc.  This area needs to be better disguised for sure.\n- The \"theme-parky\" feel.  In the classiest, most original and unique way possible, the space still emits a bit of a \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" Disney-ish theme parky feel.  Still upclass and gorgeous and memorable, but ultimately a bit too themey to me for a wedding.\n- Price.  Not cheap enough to compensate for these issues.  Rental fees for site for 150 ppl for 6 hours ~ $8,900 without beginning to explore possible tenting necessities, back up options in case of rain to an outdoor ceremony, etc.\n\nBottom line: if you have a small group, a gown that's no worries to get around in, are laid back in terms of bathroom options, and have friends who fear stilettos, then the conservatory is quite exceptional in ambiance, flowers, and photo ops so you should check it out.\n\nAlthough I love love love the Conservatory of Flowers, ultimately it wasn't the best fit for our wedding due to the above deal breakers.  I will continue to enjoy it is a botanical museum as it is exceptional on that front.", "author": "Kristen T."}

After my visit here I went to the De Young and it was a perfect excursion for the day. I loved entering the rainforest and looking at the tall banana trees, gradually making my way to the aquatic plants. The beautiful pond was decorated by lilies and plants with fragile stalks that stood with strength and grace. It's definitely full of nature's wonderment and unique botany. If you get a chance to see an exhibit this winter, \"One; An earth installation by Stanlee Gatti,\" is really special.", "author": "Kim G."}

They have a lot of different types of orchids and tropical plants such as cocoa, vanilla, coffee and spices. I wouldn't recommend visiting here on a hot day because it is pretty warm and humid inside (for the orchids) and frequently steam showered! There are about 5 salons where you get to see different plants. Currently, there is a special exhibit on butterflies and a room reserved for them. It is pretty cool to have butterflies flying around you...The outside is also great, you can just lay down and enjoy an afternoon on pretty gardens...", "author": "Burcin T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-02-05", "description": "First of all, get to the conservatory of flowers by February 26th, the last day of the \"Modern Art of Orchids\" exhibit. The collection of orchids is impressive to say the least, and the exhibit has been designed to highlight the beauty of these diverse flowers. Orchids of all kinds and colors cascade throughout the room, and the room smells so sweet and delicate and unlike all the other smells you are likely to experience in San Francisco. As for the rest of the conservatory, it is a great haven. Still and silent, (aside from all the irritating fake-shutter noises from the digital cameras of aspiring nature photographers) each room offers a different kind of escape. I especially like the aquatic plants room; the water lilies are in bloom right now, and you can see what rice, papyrus and taro plants look like.", "author": "Kathleen B."}
