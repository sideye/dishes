I was skeptical at first, but my SF colleague convinced us to have the order placed, with her glowing endorsement. \n\nI don't know the cost. I do know that everyone in the room devoured that pizza as if we we had been fasting for 3 days. Or sleep-deprived and hopped up on espresso, somehow trudging through my meeting with relatively good cheer. \n\nThe crust was more like a naan bread, neither thick nor thin, and nicely complementary to the delish bits of tandoori chicken, cauliflower, and a cheese that went surprisingly well with it all!! I dipped my pizza into the provided tamarind sauce. There was also a thicker raita-looking sauce, but I didn't have a chance to try that one. \n\nI want to get this pizza again!! What a delightful true winner of the fusion games!\n\nBetter than bargain-basement average pizza joints, kind of boutique, yet not too 'precious', either.\n\n Oooohhh, my mouth was not on fire. {Sing to the tune of that KOL song.} I'm sure you could specify your heat level.", "author": "Chanda M."}

A few friends and I decided to try some place new and heard good things of Zante's so we decided to make the drive down. It's on a busy street, but there is plenty of neighborhood parking if you're okay doing a few minutes of walking. \n\nThe people who work at the restaurant are kind and helpful. There is pizza ready to go for those who want a quick grab, and on the other side of the restaurant are seated areas. We decided to go for the Indian style pizza since that seems to be the thing here. We did extra large pizza for 5 of us, and it was the perfect amount. And ordered half chicken masala sauce and the other half paneer masala. To be honest, it seemed like just an ordinary pizza, and couldn't differentiate much of the Indian flavor on the pizza. And there wasn't enough chicken and paneer on either half of the pizza. But the bread on the pizza was delicious! \n\nCost was very affordable for the 5 of us..only $8 each (for the extra-large pizza)!

However, I ended up with no onions and no extra sauces. They said we never stated anything in our order about the sauces and said we weren't going to get any. We checked after receiving our food and it clearly says in the special instructions that we wanted extra sauce.\n\nOn top of that, they tried to make us pay again in cash.

I took a piece and the cheese didn't seem right.  I've tried almost every vegan cheese out there, daiya, follow my heart, kite hill etc., this looked and tasted like regular cow's milk cheese.  I was suspicious but my brother assured me that he had ordered it vegan.  I HAD HEARTBURN FOR 2 DAYS, one of the many perks of being vegan and no longer consuming animal products that upset my body, is that i do not get heartburn anymore.  \n  So today 5/27/2018 my brother decided to order from them again but a different pizza flavor once again VEGAN.  We get home and I'm like what is think stuff on the pizza?  It looks like ham or chicken.  We give a piece to our non vegan brother and he tries it and says it's chicken and that taste like regular cheese.\n   Okay so there can be misunderstanding right but I called them up.  I told the man that answered that we ordered a vegan pizza and received a regular pizza w/chicken.

Whether you choose tikka masala or paneer, drizzle the sweet tamarind sauce and a spicy green cilantro dressing on top of your pizza and you can't go wrong! \n\nThe stand out show to me is the pizza dough which resembles tradition naan that you can order at any Indian restaurant. Some may complain that the pizza is too doughy. However, I would have to disagree. The pizza dough was downright delicious and I thought it was perfectly baked. \n\nIf you enjoy the flavors of Indian cuisine and are looking to eat something different, I highly recommend giving Zante a try!", "author": "Briana H."}

I found the multitude of ordering mechanisms (two websites, one backed by EatStreet and another by some whitelabel solution on another domain, and phone) confusing, frustrating, and full of misinformation if they worked at all. For instance, EatStreet provides delivery information for the restaurant, but at order time, delivery is never an option. But you can actually order through EatStreet and then call the restaurant to deliver that order. Sadly, each of my three orders from the restaurant were later than the delivery commitment time, even when I scheduled it several hours in advance, and the last time was over 45 minutes late. I will likely order again, but never when my schedule demands precision, and that's usually why I would order out instead of cooking myself in the first place.", "author": "Arthur Z."}

My pizza was delivered to me in an hour (which isn't terrible in my opinion-- I'd call 45 minutes in to check up on my order). It wasn't a problem personally because I was busy sipping on champagne and watching the Grammys.\n\nAnyway, THE PIZZA. My friends and I ordered a large pizza, half chicken tiki masala and half paneer...... plz excuse me as I clean up my drool from my desk. Both were extremely tasty and I cannot recommend one more than the other, eat them both! I was worried about how the mozzarella cheese would taste with the indian flavors... it was great! The cheese wasn't overbearing and the hints of paneer and tiki masala shined through. The crust was naan... yes, i know! The pizza came with a green and red sauce.

Indian curry is quite the aromatic elixir.  It reminds me of home.\n\nThey almost got the order right, w only a few flecks of spinach.  I asked for none, but what have you.\n\nThe chicken was bone dry & the paneer was absolutely tasteless.  \n\nMy man wouldn't eat the chicken, he actually picked it off.  I picked off the paneer.\n\nThe saving grace was the curry sauce.  Most notably on the paneer side; it was rich & spicy.  The flavors were pungent & the spices shined through.  Delicious.\n\nNaan as pizza crust.  Great in theory.  And who doesn't love naan?  But overly doughy is not an adjective you want in your pizza crust.  Right?\n\nFinally, it was an oily pie.  Much more so on the paneer side.  Curry can be oily.  It happens.  But it shouldn't be.  And it doesn't make a good pizza. \n\nI love Indian food.\nI love pizza.\n\nNot sure I should have them together.\n\nI would no doubt devour roti, puri, or naan dipped in their curry sauce though.\n\n2 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

There's nothing like this in NYC where I came from. Let me tell you how the experience replayed in my head.\n\nI walk in on a Friday afternoon wearing my famous little red backpack, owner looking guy (I'll call him Zante uncle) looks and me and says %*+#\u00a3&@\"... I look at him confused. He repeats it again and then asks,\n\n\"Are you indian?\" \n\"Yes I am..\" \n\"Where from in India?\" (Note the ordering of the words hehe)\n\"I'm from the South..\"\n\nZante uncle sighs and walks away without a word. In a stern tone he asks \"what pizza you vant?\" I say I would like I try a chicken tikka masala slice (I became white for a second y'all!) to see if I wanted to buy the whole pizza. So he prepared a slice for me. He said it was complimentary, which was very nice of him because Indian people never do that. I took the slice and sat down to eat. The place was empty. Apparently folks never sit down to eat. They might as well cut out the sit down part of their restaurant and just do pizza take out and delivery. Just sayin. Anyways I continue. I call a waiter uncle to ask him what the difference between the paneer and chicken masala pizza is... \n\n\"Excuse me-\"\n\"Hindi @*&#^$...\"\n\"huh?\"\n\"You please say it in Hindi..\"\n\"I don't speak Hindi...\"\n\nHe gave me that LOOK like \"you younger generation peoples are fucked up, don't know your language, don't have indian identity, just all whitewashed!!!\"\n\nSo I gave him this LOOK back like \"listen uncle, Hindi is NOT my native language, never was, never will be. I am a Tamil girl and I speak MY language, Tamil. Fluently. For the record, not all brown people are indian and not all Indians speak Hindi. There's a reason why my people rebelled and rioted against this language, which is why most of us don't speak it. If you uncles come to my state with that Hindi, racist terms like \"Madrasi,\" and bogus stereotypes from Bollywood propaganda movies like Chennai Express, y'all would get your asses kicked. Figuratively of course. We are a peaceful species :) \n\nIf you have seen indian soap operas, you know that one LOOK and a flash of thunder and lightning can communicate quite a lot. Hehe\n\nSO. The chicken one was not horrible except for the chicken part (had no flavor), so I asked to order the paneer one instead. Waiter uncle suggested a half and half of saag paneer based veggie and the paneer tikka masala pizza. So the pizza overall was ok but NOTHING like CanAm Indian pizza from Seattle. CanAm is in a different league. They set the bar way too high for Mr. Zante to jump over. I am giving this place 4 stars because I strongly support the concept of Indian Pizza. And I took off one star because it's always that annoying kid who gets an A++ in everything that ruins the bell curve for everyone else. And Indian pizza from India (like Chicken tikka chili cheese pizza from Pizza Hut) will crush this place like Godzilla sitting on San Francisco.

I'm so glad it does though because they just put my two favorite things together. First off the costumer service was great. They were very friendly and it seemed like a family owned restaurant. My boyfriend and I followed all their recommendations from their beer to the pizza and it was all good. We did a half and half of the Chicken Tikka Masala and the meat pizza. Comes with 2 different sauces that compliment the pizza very well.", "author": "Eileen G."}

We ordered an extra large pizza and portions was enough for 5 people. They did provide some sauces with the pizza that were out of this world but with skimpy toppings, the pizza itself was nothing special. Service was really great with an attentive waiter and as we went in on a Tuesday, there was plenty of street parking. I do recommend Zante's but overall not much of a wow factor in a city worth so many good good options.", "author": "Tabita P."}

This was our last stop in my most recent trip to San Francisco, and found out about this place from a you tube food critic. I was excited to try their chicken tikka masala pizza, and wanted to try the spinach (vegetarian) as well. I ordered over the phone for pick up, verified I wanted chicken tikka masala and vegetarian spinach pizza, half and half. When I picked up my pizza, I was shocked a large was 34 dollars, but that's San Francisco I guess. I figured I'm paying for quality. Get in the car, and find out the whole damn pizza is vegetarian, and it had BIG areas missing cheese and sauce. So, I paid 34 dollars for lightly seasoned dough. I got paneer chunks instead  of chicken on the tikka side, which was so very dry of sauce.  What the hell is going on? What a slap in the face. Bummed, I ate two pieces, one of each side on our long drive home, and regretted my decision that I should have ate somewhere else. At least the dipping sauces were good. But, I didn't pay 34+ tax for freaking naan and dip.", "author": "Raquel A."}

Relax!  The people at Zante Pizza won't bite, and although your living-room floor might look cleaner than Zante's dining-room anything, you can't make pizza like this on your living-room floor, so cut them some slack.\n\nIndian food and pizza aren't a combination unique to San Francisco or even the Bay Area, but a few places here seem to do it particularly well, and Zante is at the top of that heap.  Order whatever you want on your pizza.  You may think this doesn't go with that, or that doesn't go with this, or this definitely doesn't go with this; but you'll be wrong.  Hopelessly and blissfully and fortunately wrong.  If you're not a teetotaler like I am--if you're more like Pam after a long flight--you might fancy a glass of wine with your tikka-whatever pizza.  Even that unlikely combination will pair up right, strange as it may seem.\n\nMy one criticism of Zante Pizza is that its chairs can be uncomfortable, especially when you're sitting in them for what seems like hours listening and contributing to reminiscences of harrowing workplace moments past and even more distant past.\n\nI also wish it were closer to me, but it is only a longish 24-Divisadero bus ride away, and I can order delivery too, although I rarely do.  The ambiance is part of the charm, especially when you're bringing someone here for the first time.  You'll see her eyes go from bright with anticipation to dull with disappointment to bright with surprise, because good things sometimes come in shoddy-looking packages.\n\nColorful pizza isn't always good, but every pizza I've had at Zante has been good.  So there.\n\nThanks for reminding me about Zante Pizza, Pam!", "author": "John S."}

The place clearly does most of it's business from take-out, but they have a dine-in area as well. It was quite warm inside, and when asked if they could switch on the overhead fans, we were told no-- it would mess with the oven temperature. Overall the decorations looked liked they'd been there a looong time (which, since this place opened in the late 80's, they probably have. We are vegetarian, and came for one thing and one thing only: the Paneer tikka masala pizza. \n\nYears ago, when we first moved here, we went to Golden Gate Pizza in the outer sunset after a friend recommended their Indian fusion pizza. Intrigued, we rented a zipcar, drove ourselves to the edge of the city to try it out. They had a vegetarian Indian pizza, and a vegetarian masala pizza but they would not let us put paneer as a topping. This confused/enraged us beyond belief. We liked the pizza, but we knew had we only been permitted to put paneer on top, we'd have loved it. \n\nBack to our dining experience. We ordered the extra large Paneer tikka masala pizza for the four of us and that's it . We loved it (paneer on pizza is a slam dunk) but surprisingly, we enjoyed the crust of this pizza more than anything. The crust was perfectly bread-y but not overwhelmingly so and tasted delicious doused in the chutneys they provided. \n\nWe could see ourselves taking out a pizza from here in the future-- this is definitely a craveable pizza. The service was fine -- a single waiter took everyone in the restaurant's order, we saw another guy flipping the dough and topping the pizza and everything ran just fine.", "author": "T K."}

Oh, they also have \"regular,\" i.e. not-a-pizza style Indian food, and the paneer (or shrimp) tikka masala and palak paneer are both awesome.

I had been looking forward to trying it, but didn't really have any expectations when I walked through the door. I've eaten good Indian style pizza at places all over the Bay Area, so I was not expecting to be blown away by this place, even if it is the birthplace of Indian pizza. \n\nI was wrong. The Indian pizza was amazing. It is definitely the best that I've had. I tried both the masala pizza and the spinach curry pizza. The owner recommended the masala pizza over the spinach, and it was indeed superior. It came with some green (mint?) chutney on the side which definitely enhanced the taste. The spinach pizza was good, but the level of spiciness drowned out some of the other flavors. Next time, I hope to try the paneer pizza. The pizza is sold by the slice but you can also order a full pie. There are only 2 of each slice in the display case at the front of the restaurant, but they have more in the back!\n\nThe decor and ambience are nothing special and just prove that you should never judge a book by its cover. This establishment has a 3.5 star average rating on Yelp at the time of this review being posted. If you base your restaurant choices entirely on 4.5- 5 star average Yelp ratings, then you'll be missing out on this spot. (I can't speak about the quality/timeliness of their delivery or their regular Indian food because I only had pizza at the restaurant) If you do go to Zante, then you're going to have some great pizza.

They need to get more drivers or use services like Postmates or Eat24 or ubereats Etc. As a result they deliver cold pizza after 2 hours has passed and when you call to ask where the driver is they subsequently come up with excuses saying they are very busy. This food is not worth waiting 2 hours for it to arrive cold. The main manager says he's the boss and talks down to people when you call them. He also talks over people when you call to ask where the driver is. And then he will say cancel order? I don't understand why everytime I call I need to give my phone number and address again each time. I think they must hand write everything which is not very efficient and they refused to get more drivers. They blame everything on the driver when the owner or manager guy who answers the phone obviously does not know what he's doing as a business person. They are extremely rude and the food is not that good to deal with the rudeness. The next time I receive cold pizza I'm contesting it with my credit card company. They threaten to cancel my order because I asked for the driver was more than once. They said I could cancel the order and I wouldn't be charged but they had already charged my credit card. I do not recommend this place even though the food is good sometimes especially for delivery. As many other people have said on here they give you a window of 45 minutes to an hour even when you ask them to verify that and then they show up 2 hours later if you're lucky. They won't call the driver and will tell you the driver is 10 minutes away when you can clearly hear that they're talking to the driver. All around. They are not very honest and are extremely rude. The manager blames the drivers but the drivers are always nice and a clueless that you've been calling asking where they are when they arrive.", "author": "Joie R."}

For $40 I got a pint of chicken Tikka Sag, a pint of chicken Tikka Masala, a mini container of basmati rice (about 1 cup of cooked rice) and one large piece of onion kulcha (naan). Oh, and a coke because i was jonesing.  What the heck man? The Sag was OK, nothing to write home about and the tikka was the most bland I have ever had.  Both dishes included 4 chunks of chicken in them.  4. If that's not bad enough - the tikka was the weirdest I have ever had.  It was super thick and really pale in color and tasted REALLY bland.  My guess is that they LOAD it with cream, but that wouldn't be cost effective, and it also didn't congeal the same way creamy sauces do when refrigerated, rather, it became the texture of peanut butter.  When I reheated it, the oil leeched out of the sauce and it was SO GROSS, in a 1/4 cup portion of sauce, HALF of that was oil!  My guess is that they are using some sort of stable oil emulsified into the sauce to give it body - maybe this helps it stand up to baking it on a pizza or something. I don't know but it was gross to know I had eaten that much straight up fat in the form of emulsified oil.  The food was not horrible and the delivery service was friendly, but I don't think I would order from them again because of the oily-ness and blandness of the tikka masala.", "author": "Emma H."}

Still good flavor but my friend ordered the pizza to be delivered but it took them double the amount of time to arrive that they told him & it was completely cold :(.

The tamarind and cilantro sauces were not only delicious, they were necessary to both add flavor and mask the rancid smell.  I can't tell if Zante changed how it makes its pizza or if my memory screwed me over, but that was it for me and I hope other places that make Indian pizza will be worth checking out.  \n\nTwo stars: kind and attentive server, food came promptly, and thank god for those sauces...", "author": "Susan B."}

AN HOUR AND A HALF later, our pizza had not arrived. I called and was told it would be arriving any minute.  20 MINUTES LATER (after feeding my kid a sandwich for dinner) I called AGAIN to check on the order and was put on hold while someone \"checked on it\"....I was on hold for 10 minutes! 5 minutes into my hold, the pizza arrived; the delivery man was apologetic, and told me the people at the restaurant always tell everyone who calls for delivery that the wait time is 45 minutes, no matter the actual estimate! He told me to call the restaurant and they would probably reduce the cost of the pizza...I explained I was already on hold. I waited 5 more minutes on hold to complain, but nobody ever picked up to speak to me again, so I hung up. The pizza was no longer hot and arrived fully an hour after estimated.

Oh yah, and so does tandoori, curry, and tikka masala. YUMS! \n\nWith Italian food, I think of carbolicious simplicity: crisp Neapolitan pizzas and al-dente pasta lightly dressed in mouth-watering sauces. MANGIA! MANGIA!\n\nCombining the two? PURE. EPICUREAN. GENIUS. \n\nZante's birthed this culinary genius in the late 80's calling it: The Indian Pizza.

It tasted exactly as it looked: bland and excessively doughy (good for pigeon feeding though). The Indian gene wasn't as apparent as the toppings got lost in the dough. The very little tandoori chicken was dry while the lamb was mia. The bharta (eggplant), aloo palak (spinach), garlic, and ginger infused some savory spice but wasn't evenly distributed; neither awakening the taste buds nor redeeming the bland pizza. \n\nLike most babies, the Indian pizza left a surprise in my mouth: nice, crunchy prawn tail shells. MmMmMm, FERTILIZER! Yeup, they use prawn shells for potato fertilizer in Norway. NOW, I just gotta bag me a Mr. Potato Head!\n\nOTHER NOTES: \n*Friendly service\n*Quoted pick-up time: 20 minutes but was ready in 15 minutes \n*Wooden railing divides the divey pizza oven area and the more formal crisp white linen table dining room \n*Small parking lot (entrance on Cortland) otherwise difficult street parking\n*$15 min for CC's", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I tried to explain that I don't have the menu and I'm on a video shoot he told me to order online and hung up. So I had to take a snapshot of the menu and called back. He was rude again and kept trying to rush me when I had never ordered there and I was trying to figure out what the size differences were. \n\nWhen I had called back I finally had to tell him either he wants my business or I can order somewhere else as he was going to hang up on me again. That finally got his attention and he was more patient. I ordered and when he delivered I never got the check he said it was in the bag but it wasn't. The check which I needed so the business could comp the meal. \n\nNow a few weeks later I'm trying to call him back and get the check from him and I told him the date and time... What do I get again? Him telling me what I ordered... As if I remembered that... That's why I needed the check!

I've ordered the best Indian pizza and the chicken masala pizza several times. Quite tasty and unique. \n\nTheir website has one of the worst user interfaces I've experienced... it wasn't even state of the art in 1995. It says they have a mobile friendly menu... I've never braved looking at their site on a phone. It's already hard enough on a lap top. If you can be patient enough to deal with the clunky interface to find the section on ordering an Indian pizza its not too bad. \n\nTip - after you submit the order you will get a message that says \"Call us to confirm your order if we don't call you within 10-15 minutes\". I've ordered from them more than 10 times, I think maybe once they actually called and confirmed the order, maybe I'm not sure. So just plan on calling them in 10 minutes and make sure they are working on your order. Also no matter what they will ALWAYS tell you that your pizza will be delivered in about 45 minutes. Sometimes it has arrived 15 minutes after I called, sometimes an hour but the one thing that is certain is they will tell you its going to be 45 minutes. \n\nLook, delivery generally sucks in this city, especially at any decent pizza place if you place an order during peak hours like I always do. So Zantes is like everyone else. What it gets down to is the food tastes good and it's a fair price. What more do you expect in this town?

That would have been perfect timing for my family as we usually eat dinner at about 8, and the kids were hungry! Thought we would splurge and order out that night to treat ourselves after a really long week. \n\nAt 8:10 the pizza had not arrived so I called Zante to ask if the pizza was on its' way, and the man on the phone abruptly said \"ok, ok, 5-10 minutes.\" then hung up on me. By 8:30 the pizza still wasn't here so I called again. The same man answered and said the same thing, 5-10 minutes. At this point in time we had to make breakfast for dinner as we were all so hungry. \n\nFinally get a call at 9:17pm that the pizza guy was outside. So I go out to get the pizza thinking that maybe we could have it for lunch tomorrow being that we had already eaten, and the guy says, \"look, my boss gave me the wrong pizza, but do you want it anyways?\" Holding back tears of frustration I asked what kind of pizza it was, \"chicken\" the guy replied. \n\nWell Zante, I am a vegetarian and so is my whole family, so no, no your chicken pizza that arrived 2 hours and 17 minutes after ordering would not do, nor will it ever.

I ordered the Indian vegetarian which comes topped with spinach, eggplant, cauliflower, ginger, garlic, onions, & cilantro. The delivery came a little after the estimated 40 minutes (~1 hr) but I was kind of expecting as much so I was still satisfied. The aroma wafting from the box was definitely the traditional Indian spices. \n\nI was impressed by the pizza, I've have \"Indian Pizza\" before but in the past it has usually been a combination of my typical Indian fare (i.e., Saag Paneer or Tikka Masala) poured onto a pizza crust. The Indian Vegetarian plays more like what pizza would have been like if it was created in Indian. I thought the blend of veggies, sauce, and spices was excellent. It is of course different than your typical pizza or Indian food and of course hybrids never live up to the standards of either of the components.

I always get the vegetarian Indian pizza, of which you can find a photo and ingredients on Zante's website.  \n\nI think the idea of Indian pizza kind of speaks for itself.  It's brilliant.  Often when it comes up, people assume that this must be a pizza made on naan bread, which it is not, but this turns out to be a good thing in my mind, because who wants to fill up on a thick crust?  I also appreciate that even though Zante serves Indian pizza - an obvious signature dish - they don't let themselves slack on the other more conventional Indian food on the menu.  I mean, it's not the best Indian food you've ever had, but it's solid, and some dishes are legitimately spicy.  \n*Tips: (1) Order papadum; it is spicy and good, and you will get chutneys with it that you can put on your pizza.  (2) Most importantly, order saag, dip your Indian pizza in it.  \n\nI have actually never been inside Zante and, despite having always gotten it delivered, have never been the one in charge of placing the order, so I can't really speak to other folks' complaints about that process.  My friend who always takes care of the ordering says that it is best to do it online.  It's true that it can take a hell of a long time for your food to show up, but if you know that, you can plan around it.  I still think Indian pizza is worth it.", "author": "Josh C."}

It took my friends twisting my arm to give it a chance, and that chance was granted reluctantly and with a bit of sulking. I am so, so happy I took them up on this place, though: Zante's is awesome! There's a lot to love about traditional pizza and traditional (if Americanized) Indian food, and the combination is something that really does work quite well. \n\nI came here with three friends, and we ordered the a medium indian pizza and the Pure Vegetarian Thali. For about $12 each plus tax and tip we got a metric asston of food. That's four standard buttloads. The pizza was wonderfully aromatic. The crust reminded me more of naan than of the Sicilian style crispy goodness that I grew up with, but the toppings balanced that out with a fiery yet mellow flavor profile. \n\nOn the non-pizza side of things, their Samosas are excellent. It had that crispy, almost crunchy texture that I felt was missing from the pizza. I enjoyed their Raita over the salad they provided; I felt its mellow coolness really complemented the pizza's zip. The stand out to me was their Chana Masala, though: chickpeas, spice, and pure unadulterated comfort. Their Kheer was an excellent end to the evening, and I got to eat most of it because everyone else was stuffed. \n\nThe moral for me is \"don't be so cynical\" and for anyone reading this? \"Go try some Indian pizza, 'cause you won't be sorry.\"", "author": "Aaron Y."}

Janette and I finally got to try this after seeing Michelle and Eddie check in here a bunch of times.\n\nMango Lassi - a must order if you like anything mango. Pretty much an indian mango shake. Its similar to Mango Calpico, but thicker and more yogurty. This thing absolutely wrecks any mango shake (boba, ice cream, calpico, etc ), and its such a great order to cool down any spicy foods.\n\nIndian Pizza - insanely addicting. I swear, Zante's tricks you into eating veggies with how good this pizza is. Stand a lone, you're getting a spinach, cauliflower, chicken tandoori, some shrimp, mozarella over a spinacy sauce and curry sauce layer. The pizza dough seems to be doughy, yet light (maybe Roti dough is thrown in), and have a yellow color, probably from tumeric. It is amazing. If you like a garlic pizza (similar to garlic clam pizzas), this is the pizza to get. While there is a lot of masking of flavor (the garlic is over powering at times, the tandoori is chopped so that there aren't many large chicken chunks or huge tandoori flavor), it just tastes freaking good (then again I can eat a ton of garlic).\n\nThe key to the pizza - ASK for spicy and sweet sauce. The spicy sauce is a cilantro/pepper cream based sauce... that is seriously crack. While hot stand alone, the heat actually goes away when mixed with the pizza and adds another layer of flavor, though it also heavily emphasizes the garlic. The sweet sauce appears to be a tamarind based vinegar/sugar sauce, which also adds a layer of complexity when combined with the pizza.\n\nI can't emphasize how ridiculously addicting this pizza was.

I ordered the  Medium size Best Indian Pizza (non-vegan thank you very much) for delivery and was GREATLY saddened by tonight's experience!! First off, this is the 3rd time I've ordered from them and have had no problems up till now. Granted, they have to travel quite a few blocks to get to my apartment but still, no excuse for this:\n\nordered the pizza (remember, the one with everything on it: vegetables, lamb, tandoori chicken, and shrimp) and figured it would be around 40 mins for it to arrive based on previous experiences. Fast forward to AN HOUR AND A HALF later= no pizza. So we call asking where the pizza is and get some lame excuse : \"the system was broken\". Uh, what system? Your system for charging credit cards? Well, that worked super fast. The buzzer to the door outside the apartment? 'Cause directions on how to ring someone up are posted on the box where you push the buttons to call someone. Oh, and we gave you our apartment number and PHONE NUMBER TO CALL when you arrived. \n\nShenanigans, Zante! I call shenanigans on you.\n\nSo we end up waiting another 15 mins outside the apartment to make sure the delivery guy sticks around this time and when he does arrive, he takes his sweet time getting out and giving us the pizza!! What the hell?! We asked if he tried calling but he brushed us off and left.\n\nI'm a nice and rather lenient person, but not when I've waited a long ass time to eat. And it pains me to be mean to Zante 'cause they make delicious pizza and I've had good experiences before (especially eating at the actual establishment; they let my group bring outside wine!). However: late pizza, unapologetic pizza guy, lukewarm pizza, and SCANT/NO shrimp= mediocre review and a metaphorical slap on the wrist. (let us take a moment for that missing topping...*tear*)\n\nWill I order again? Probably, but I'll be super detail oriented and give them directions on what to do once they get to my apartment, 'cause apparently they need it.\n\nDamn you Zante, if only your pizza wasn't so yummy I'd be more self-righteously angry.", "author": "Amanda C."}

I checked quickly on Yelp and saw it had 4 stars and the first few reviews sounded reassuring, so since it was already 7:30pm, I quickly ordered several things, including an Indian pizza, of course.\n\nIt wasn't until AFTER I placed the order that I kept browsing the rest of the Yelp reviews out of curiosity.  And to my dismay, I saw the numerous reviews describing poor service, horrible delivery times of 2 hours, cold pizza, and mixed up or lost orders.  I get a sinking feeling in my stomach.  Our late dinner was going to become a very very late dinner....\n\nOr so I thought.\n\n7:33pm - GrubHub order entered.  Estimated delivery time 8:23pm.\n\n7:35pm - GrubHub confirmation email received.

The guy who answers the phone asks for my address, then quickly says \"Yeah, we got your order.  It's leaving now.\"  short pause. \"It's almost ready, it will leave in a few minutes.\"  Since it has only been 18 minutes since I put in my order, and since I've seen all the other Yelp reviews, I think to myself he must automatically say that for every phone call.  I ask him to read my my order.  He reads the items.  At least they really got the order.\n\n7:56pm - Husband arrives home.  I tell him I ordered food but warn him we might have to wait a while, really worried that I ordered too quickly before doing thorough Yelp research....\n\n8:04pm - Cell phone rings.  It's the delivery man.  He says he's downstairs.  I'm suspicious, thinking this is too fast to be real.

Finally, I got a chance to try it for myself last night.  OMFG.  \n\nIt may look like a pizza, and you may eat it like a pizza, but that is where the comparison ends.  The crust really isn't like any pizza crust you have ever had.  It is fluffy and buttery and naan-like. (My friends recommended the veggie version instead of the meat version.)  We ordered a veggie Korma dish and a spicy eggplant dish, along with the traditional spicy green sauce and tamarind sauce that I spooned onto it as well.    It was unbelievably good.  Just unbelievable.  The crust just soaked up the sauces and the flavors and the cheese was just enough to add a mellow richness.  \n\nFantastic.  Our friends brought lovely bottles of wine - a Syrah and a Zinfindel.  Corkage is only $2.00 and they open the wine and provide wine glasses. \n\nBoth wines went well with the pizza, which stood up well to a good bottle of red.  I love San Francisco.  If Austin, TX, opened up a place like this (I'm from Austin), there would be lines out the door and around the block.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

At first I was reluctant to try this place out, I figured what do Indians know about pizza?  Apparently they seem to know a lot, because the slice of vegetarian Indian pizza tastes good.  It was probably one best slices of vegetarian pizza I had in recent memory. The pizza smells like a Indian buffet and the indescribable toppings looks like it also came from it. The pizza was warm and the crust was crunchy. Service was fast and efficient. The place looked nice and clean. Indian pizza slices starts from 3 dollars and up. Meat can be added to the pizza slice.  I also tried the Indian meat pizza, that had Tandoori chicken on it. It was pretty good.  \n\nSince this place is an Indian restaurant, it will be closed from 3 pm to 5 pm, so they can be prepared for the dinner rush. This is definitely my first choice for non Italian pizza. \n\nThis is much better than Taco Bell Mexican Pizza! I look forward to trying the pizza again when I am in the neighborhood.", "author": "Hiroshi K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-26", "description": "In some cultures, it is customary to haggle over prices on just about everything, not just cars. So here is how to have a predictable, good experience with Zante's:\n\n1. 2 hours before you wish to eat, call Zante's and order your pizza. They will tell you it will be there in 45 minutes, they are lying.\n\n2. after an hour and 15 minutes, call and politely ask where it is, they will tell you \"5-10 minutes away\". more lies. Don't be discouraged if they simply pick up the phone and hang it up again. They do this when they're really busy. Keep calling until they'll talk to you. This step is crucial as you need to go on record at least once as complaining that your pizza is late.\n\n3. at 90 minutes after calling, pre heat your oven to 350 and wash your hands.\n\n4. at 2 hours, their driver will call you saying he's outside. when he hands you the pizza, but before giving him any money, open the box to confirm it's correct (they've been known to mix up pizzas and orders) and if it is yours, stick your finger in the cheese to confirm it's temperature (cold). Then tell the driver he's an hour and a half late, and the pizza's cold, and you'll give %65 of the price. He'll apologize profusely and accept your offer. In my case an X-Large Veggie indian pizza list price before tax and tip was $27.99, so this is a good one because you can basically whip out a $20 bill and say \"take it or leave it\"... they're not stupid and know that if you refuse the pizza it's a total loss, especially since you just stuck your finger in it. Don't feel bad about not tipping the driver, just like you wouldn't tip for crappy service in a restaurant.\n\n5. take your pizza inside and transfer it to a baking sheet and put it in the oven for 10 minutes, and enjoy. Their Indian pizza is really delicious after all.\n\nBottom line is their service sucks, and seems to get worse every time. There is no reason we should be expected to take it from them just because they have a one of a kind delicious product that no one else in town provides. Get the Pizza you want at the price you want to pay, and if you plan ahead, you can actually have it when you want it, not 2 hours after. If they want to start getting $30 for their pizzas again they can hire more drivers so they can get them to us in a timely fashion.", "author": "Lars S."}

But as things stand, this is not a business that can be trusted with your money or your order.\n\nZante has been our go-to place for getting pizza delivered for the last year or so, but the number of problems and errors have brought us to the breaking point.\n\nIf you're lucky, you'll get your pizza in about an hour.\n\nIf you're less lucky, you'll get your pizza in 90-120 minutes.\n\nSurprisingly often, you'll get the WRONG pizza in 2 hours or more, sometimes cold.\n\nThey may even forget to deliver your pizza, and require you to nag them several times on the phone just to get it delivered in the first place.\n\nThey never straighten things out when you call them to deal with a problem. They may offer you a refund or a free pizza, but you never actually get it. They may also just hang up on you.\n\nIf you do order from Zante, do NOT pay by credit card. Pay by cash, when they arrive. Check the pizza before paying, to make sure that it is the right thing and that it is still warm... and send it back without paying if it isn't. Also, have a backup plan lined up, and don't expect your pizza in anything resembling a timely manner. You'll be sorry if you're not prepared. Does that sound like a ridiculous hassle for ordering a pizza? We thought so, to... and that's why we won't be ordering from Zante any more, after being regular customers nearly a year.\n\nTheir pizza is actually pretty good, but that is no excuse for the way they treat their customers or run their business. And both the timing of the delivery and the accuracy of the order are a total crapshoot.\n\nSo we are saying goodbye to Zante. They could be good, if only they'd get their act together.

The different flavors: curry, chicken, and other things that I don't know, but I know it all went well together. \n\nFor my past birthday I decided to go there and expose my friends to the taste of this pizza. \n\nParking is kind of hard if you don't want to pay the meter. The place is kind of bigger than I expected. There was table cloth and everything, kind of weird. I was expecting beat up wooden tables, so not that.\n\nWe had made a reservation, haha, there was no need to do that, they didn't even know what I was talking about, and the place wasn't busy.\n\nThere were 8 girls. We ordered the Chili Cheese Naan to start and the XL Great Indian Pizza. On the menu you can read all the ingredients to the Indian pizza. Don't be scared, you can't taste the lamb. The naan was served with a red and green sauce. It was good, and spicy. The pizza was big (I took a picture for you guys). It fed all of us and we were all okay after. The flavors were better than I remembered. Like Indian food on pizza. GENIUS! Some of us ordered the mango lasse, that was alright, not as thick but it still tasted good.\n\nThe wait staff  were all really nice. Refilled the water (which I needed) and I think my friends told them it was my birthday and they came out with a dessert on the house with candles in it. So nice!

Some days it is absolutely delicious - thick soft crust, w. lots of cheese and tasty sauce.  Other days (like last night), it's just a blob of dough oozing w. too much sauce and not enough cheese.  I can't fault them for the fact that sometimes the slices are kind of old - that's understandable.  But it shouldn't be such a COMPLETE CRAP SHOOT every time.\n\nThe Indian food itself is pretty boring from what I remember.  Not particularly flavorful.

Zante's perfectly executes Indian-Italian fusion with a spiced-up crust and cauliflower, garlic, cilantro, and chutney as toppings.  Zante's is this little Indian cheese-lover's dream come true - it's the best of both worlds and satisfies many cravings at once.  Also, it's not as heavy as regular Indian food (except when fatty also gets a curry on the side and dips said delicious Indian pizza into the curry for extra Indian-y goodness) so it's great when you feel like Indian food but don't want to feel totally crappy afterwards.\n\nI highly recommend asking for the chutneys on the side when you order the Indian pizza and dipping your pizza in the chutneys.

It is a one of a kind recipe that they serve Indian style pizza which comes with Plum sauce to boot. My only warning is to beware of how many slices you consume because the pizza sat heavy in my stomach for a few hours after I wolfed down four slices. Maybe 2 or 3 slices at a time would be my recommendation. Now as far as the inside is concerned, I think Zante's could use a touch up on their tables and carpets (it felt old & traditional).

The notion that East and West could successfully be combined in a single pizza seems obvious - but has been elusive for millenia.  Even today, the serious Indian Pizza places are few and far between.  I couldn't find it in Contra Costa.  Once the buzz got to me, the only question was \"Where?\"  Zante in Bernal Heights comes up over and over when inquiries are made and searches executed for the best of bay Indian Pizza.  Tonight, for my birthday dinner after the Giants game, we went to Zante.  Four of us ordered an extra large Chicken Tikka Masala Pizza, chai, and I had kheer for dessert.  (I haven't passed-up kheer since I had wheat kheer for breakfast in a Gujarati village).  The Indian Pizza was quite good and Zante executed it well.  The basic structure is pizza.  The spices and toppings are Indian, other than the cheese - which was typical of pizza (a rich mozzarella it seemed).  The service at Zante was prompt and the pizza was delivered in less than 15 minutes.  It comes with the traditional mint and tamarind chutneys, which are essential.  The chai was average and the kheer was the type that is more like rice pudding and less like sweet porridge.  I'm a sucker for rice pudding, though, so if someone tries to make another dish but ends up with rice pudding, I still like it.  I'll need to have more Indian Pizza to comment on the subtleties.  For now, I'll leave it at this:  Indian Pizza has a future and Zante does it well.  I look forward to this culinary art being perfected and to avoid the difficult choice between \"Indian\" or \"pizza.\"", "author": "Jeff M."}

I am throwing my dog's 3rd birthday party, and if I were to serve INDIAN pizza, I'd have to know for myself if it was edible.  \n\nMy husband and I tried the vegetarian indian slice and a normal cheese slice.  It looked weird, but after biting it.. it wasn't so bad.  Now, I would appreciate a normal slice of pizza.. with you know, cheese, pepperoni, mushroom etc.. but this is something different.  It tasted like exotic bread.  The cheese slice was a big hit for my husband.  He is a bit particular about the texture of the dough.. and this one had just enough crunch.. and it wasn't soggy.  Soggy pizza is an automatic negative for him.  It was pretty inexpensive too.. $6 for 2 slices of pizza and a canned soda. \n\nSo.. in the end..

Seriously, every time I have it (whether homemade or from a restaurant) I wonder why I ever bother eating anything else.  Still, for some reason it remains a cult dish, and few restaurants bother to make it, let alone perfect it.  Fortunately, at Zante's the pizza is the signature dish, and you can tell right away that they've honed it into a masterpiece (with dough that would be the envy of any traditional pizzeria, I should add).  \n\nThe only thing I was shocked too see is that they only make one kind of indian pizza (even the vegetarian toppings are just a subset of the regular toppings).  What, no \"chicken pizza masala\"?  No \"saag pizzaneer\"?  No \"pizzalu gobhi\"?  They clearly have the skills to make these if they tried, so I have to dock one star for lack of ambition.

I have been told that the climate here is great for the much cherished sourdough bread, but for similar reasons it is terrible for pizza dough. I have no idea whether that is true or not, what I do know is that San Francisco's pizza, whether we're talking about the cheap by-the slice variety, or the more bourgeois gourmet style, are both fundamentally terrible forms of pizza.\n\nEnter Zante's, with its pizza composed of Indian ingredients. Does it really count as pizza? Not really, just as Chicago deep dish pizza isn't really pizza either. Is it better than any other pizza place in the city? Absolutely.\n\nThey also, of course, have Indian food here, which I've found to be unexceptional. Come here for the pizza. They also have \"regular\" pizza here too, but I don't think I have the guts to see how that is. They also have ridiculously cheap pitchers of beer, so actually going to the physical establishment is a good idea.

Don't order online. I'm not sure why they have this feature on their website. They don't check it. If you forget that you ordered it online, then so will they and you will be hungry.\n\n2. All versions of their Indian Pizza taste exactly the same. Extra sauce? Tikka Masala? All the same. Don't think too hard.\n\n3. Ask for extra red & green side sauces. They won't remember to bring them, but that's cool. If you don't order them you'll wish you had, and at least now you know you tried.\n\n4. Be high when you order. It's fun. Not just from the usual \"it's fun to be high\" perspective, but because you have people offering you Indian Pizza on the other end of the phone, a proposition who's full impact can only truly be appreciated when you're three millimeters of impulse control away from deep-frying batter-dipped chocolate chip cookies. \n\n5. Get at least a double order of pakora. Small servings, and the part of you that is demanding deep-fried food will be satisfied. \n\n6. Put on a movie. No matter how long the movie is, the food will arrive exactly at the midway point, ten minutes after you start wondering just where the fuck your food is.\n\n7. Double check your order when it shows up. Like I said, they won't have the green & red sauces you ordered, but let it go, let it go. Just make sure your mango lassi made it from the driver's car to your house. It didn't, and you need to call them to have them call the driver and tell him to turn around and bring it to you. This conversation will take a little while, because they won't initially believe you.\n\n8. This is a superimportant one: don't eat the whole pizza. Stick what's left in the fridge. In the morning, scramble & soft-cook a few eggs with whatever's left of the green & red sauces that you hopefully didn't actually drink, and then bake the remaining pizza with the eggs on top.\n\nKeep these things in mind, and you will have a fantastic experience. I promise.\n\nUPDATE:\nI'm totally deep-frying batter-coated chocolate chip cookies.", "author": "jason l."}

GREASE!!\n\nAn order from Zante Pizza often seeps through its foil wrapped container, through its paper bag, and even through the table on which you place it.  Once in your mouth, that grease goes on to seep through your stomach and through your chest creating a vaguely opaque, grease-laden window to your very soul upon which your most secret passions are forever revealed to the public, and those passions cry out into the darkened universe, \"FEED ME MORE!\"  'Cuz despite being greasy, Zante's is good!\n\nComplications abound, however.  If one orders their food \"as hot as you can make it\" that person's soul too often finds itself plummeted into the Hellish depths of spice.  A single bite can feel like a punch in the mouth, but with a flavor that leaves you clambering for another...and another.  The spices are so hot, yet so tasty you'll find yourself shuffling a scalding morsel around the interior of your palate as you simultaneously inhale air in quick huffs to make the the entire experience somehow barely tolerable.\n\nHellish though it may be to the soul, however, Zante will forever have a place in Heaven.

Meals that turn out poorly make me cranky, but my Zante's delivery experience was somewhat entertaining, it was that bad!\n\nBack when I still lived in Santa Cruz, I remember being compelled by Zante's Indian pizza. I mean it's two great worlds colliding, and it was decent back in the day. However, I rarely hear people saying anything good about the regular Indian portion of the menu. The yelp holiday party called for a mid-week, pre-finals party trip back to SF. After we fought the crowds at the party and got a bit sauced, we decided to grab a cab and head home for some Project Runway (I know, my life is tres exciting, no?). We were feeling peckish and enjoying some wine when we decided to call for Indian delivery. Spicy Bite was closed and we wanted somebody to bring us some spicy CTM fast! We spaced on Al Hamara (Not my favorite anyway, good Indian delivery in the Mission/Bernal area is hard to come by) and ended up with Zante's b/c it was still open. \n\nI think this qualifies as the worst Indian meal I've ever eaten, and that's saying a lot b/c tipsy people aren't the hardest to please. We ordered CTM, some chana dal, naan, and rice. The Chinese style take-out containers were double reinforced with foil...but it was no match for the epic oil slick fighting to emerge. We dipped the naan in the CTM sauce and watched in amazement as the oil seeped out of the container through the  double layer of foil and formed a huge oil mass on the coffee table. I normally enjoy unctuous meaty foods, but this was something new. The most puzzling aspect, was that the 4 dry, white chicken chunks in the CTM surely were not the source of the oil spill, so what was the root of origin for all of that lipid matter?\n\nYeah, not much more to say about it.

You might not see the cost effectiveness of ordering a case at 2.99 a bottle, but getting a couple of Kingfishers with your chicken tikka masala and naan wouldn't be the worst proposition in the world, would it?\n\nFurthermore, the website is set up to let you order delivery without picking up the phone.  You get some pictures, and then you can click to order.  Not bad, not bad at all.  They usually call to confirm the order, so if you're a strange-number-so-I-won't-answer kinda person, you should be anticipating an important call about your food after ordering.\n\nThe food is pretty good.  Not super exciting, but I'd give it a solid 3.  I have no idea as to how far they will deliver to, but if you live in the Bernal Heights, Outer Mission, Glen Park, Noe Valley region, you should check it out.

No; just yesterday I ate bacon-wrapped scallops, sausage, and a poached egg with bernaise for breakfast. The vegetarian and meatitarian pizzas aren't particularly exciting, I've found -- but their vegan pizza is a delicious pile of yummy seasoned veggies with what is probably yesterday's bengan bartha, saag, and aloo gobi on top. It is SO GOOD. I have served it to lots of people and just about everyone thinks it's great. If you really want meat, it's particularly good with some sliced up chicken sausage on top.\n\nI've also had them cater a 10-person dinner party.

Zante Pizza won.\r\nDidn't end up ordering the pizza from there (which I now understand may be pretty damn good based on the reviews below here - then again you people also liked the supperclub and Luna Park so what do you know? ;-)).\r\n\r\nAnyway...I ordered....Lamb Korma, Nan, a drink and Kheer.\r\nThe guy who took my order had some severe A.D.D. and once he had eventually gotten my order down he hangs up. I call up and ask that I would like to pay with credit card upon which he replies, and I quote;\r\n\"Come on man, it's only twenty dollars..\"\r\n\r\nI found some cash and went with that.\r\n\r\nFood arrived 40-45 minutes later.\r\nNaan: Soggy and cold.\r\nLamb: Bland and the pieces of meat were not well cut.\r\nKheer: Frigg'n weird - more like wallpaper glue meets porridge.\r\nDrink: It was a coke. It tasted like coke. They did a good job on that one at least.\r\n\r\nWill I order again? Well I do want to figure out if the Indian Pizza is any good but the bad experience I had tonight will most likely prevent me from trying it out.\r\n\r\nTwo stars and three 'yucks'.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: Tried the Indian Pizza. The flavour was good but as with anything you order from these guys it's LATE and COLD and served up with some shitty attitude.\r\n\r\nNo more business from me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-19", "description": "This review has a very specific scope: the so called \"Best Indian Pizza\".  I haven't had any of their other food yet, so I have nothing to say about anything but their pizza.\n\nFirst I'll say that I like Indian food, and I also like pizza.  This doesn't necessarily mean that I'd like them together, though.  (For example - I like dry diced chicken from San Tung on Irving, and I like pearl milk tea, but although I've never had it, I suspect that I would not like milk tea with diced chicken bits in it, if you know what I mean).\n\nSo when the idea of getting an Indian pizza was put out there, I wasn't sure whether to be excited or nervous.  \n\nAfter watching a PBS special, though,  where two guys out ice climbing on a glacier somewhere in South America got separated from one another, one of them falling 150 feet down onto the ice, crashing through it and falling 50 more feet into an icy crevasse, getting stuck there for a day or so and finally crawling his way out of there and pulling himself across 5 miles of treacherous ice, over boulders and back to the camp with a compound fracture in his leg, to rejoin his buddies who had already been mourning his certain death for the previous 4 days, I figured it would be rather wimpy to avoid trying a pizza just because it seemed like the toppings might be outside my normal comfort zone.  \n\nAnd I'm really happy to say that like those ice climbing guys, but very likely with a good amount less bravery, I went for it, living on the edge.  The Best Indian Pizza, topped with spinach, eggplant, cauliflower, ginger, garlic, green onions, cilantro and tandoori chicken was really, really tasty.  I loved the spiciness of the toppings and the way the flavors complimented each other.  I'll definitely have the pizza again, and even though it seems that other yelpers have had less than stellar experiences with the other food here, I'll probably give it a go next time just because I liked this pizza so much.  \n\nAlso, I took the pizza out so have no opinion about the service or decor.  More on that at a later date . . .", "author": "Chris S."}

I was the only person inside at the time.  Someone who was going to interview me for a radio show said she might have been coming, and she did.  But she only stayed for about 10 minutes and left again.  I got this odd feeling that I was in the mafia...I don't know why...at any rate, I enjoyed the pizza.\n\nLater, when I was moving into the Bernal Lowlands, my mom went to Zante to pick up some pizza.  Someone started telling her all about everything on the menu, which she found annoying.  Then, the staff started saying that she shouldn't listen to him because he's just a customer.  Then this customer apparently starts trying to pick up my mom by asking her to have a cup of coffee.  My mom goes into this long explanation of how if she drinks coffee, she'll get really sick.

Rice and nann are not included but we got them anyway. Since I don't like lamb, I can't say whether it was good or not.

The only reason I \"4' star'd it vs \"5\" starrin' it was because of price and parking IF you decide to dine in.\nAhem...now then...the reasons I love this place?\n\nYUMMY pizza...and I mean, your typical pizza pie, with everything on it...very yummy crust and generous with the toppings!  Also, they make INDIAN pizza with spinach and tandoori chicken and other yummy seasonings! Definitely worth a try yelpsters! Even if you order a regular pizza and then a slice of the Indian pizza! You will not be disappointed!\n\nREALLY YUMMY Indian food! I love love LOVE their Chicken Korma! Creamy, slightly spicy sauce, tender, white meat hunks of chicken...I'm salivating as I type this!  Also try their Veggie Samosas, and their Saag Prawn...basically lovely creamed spinach with spices and nuts and PRAWNS!! DEE-lish!!!\n\nYou know what else I like to do?? MIX it UP!!! For instance, a really divine meal involves ordering a cheese pizza and then an order of Chicken Korma and then dipping said pizza slices into the sauce!  It's a departure from the Naan bread you would normally use to sop up the yummy sauces (though this place has GREAT naan..I recommend Plain or Garlic Naan)\n\nI have had no problems with ordering over the phone...in fact, one of the owners, Tony, who is totally hot by the way, knows my VOICE now! and my favorites!    Hot! Hotter! Hottest!! (~_~)   Yes, sometimes when I call and Tony's not there, you might get someone who speaks with an accent, but we can understand each other enough to give/receive a dinner order!   I agree with other posters who mentioned, this place surely is NOT the Four Seasons in terms of decor..it's a Pizza-Indian place in the Mission, are you that surprised this place isn't like a scene from a dinner party in \"Brideshead Revisited?\" BUT..they have cheap pitchers of good  beer, (TAJ Mahal? KingFisher anyone?)  plenty of room if you have a big group or someone has a kid in a stroller or someone's in a wheel chair (I run with a wild crowd (~_~) I dunno, all around this place is a winner,  I wish the prices were a tad cheaper AND I do wish they had parking!  It's a very busy area, the nearby corners are almost ALL bus stops, you may circle 5-10 times before finding a space 3 blocks away!  You could \"bus\" it there if you're into that sort of thing...they do have a parking lot in the back  (Enter on Cortland Ave) but it's kinda dark and narrow and scary...always filled with cars (of the workers) or delivery guys...so it's almost a \"why bother\" shrug type thing...oh well.

My roommates and I ordered pizza from here this weekend, and we had pretty high expectations based on the reviews we'd read - especially the one comparing eating Zante pizza to receiving a blow job from God (personal favorite).  \n\nThe pizza did take about an hour and fifteen minutes.  No foul here though, since we were anticipating a long wait based on the reviews - and accordingly ordered about an hour and fifteen minutes before we wanted to eat.\n\nThe pizza arrived, the smell was awesome, it looked delicious, and I was officially \"amped.\"\n\nOn the first bite I was still in pretty high spirits, but the more I ate the more I felt that this pizza was just \"ok.\"  \n\nNow, I've decided not to add any points for being unique - though I think others could feel justified in doing so.  Nonetheless, once you move past the fact that this is truly something \"different\" what you are left with is simply mediocre Indian food on a mediocre pizza.  \n\nAlso to be fair, most of the reviews that make a specific recommendation for this place suggest the veggie pizza - whereas we had the \"Best Indian Pizza\" specialty.  Maybe we should have stuck with the veggie pizza, but tandoori chicken sounded delicious.  \n\nAll and all, not bad.  I'm sure we'll try it again just because there is no other place like it.

Their delivery times are usually reasonable.  I've been ordering from them for a few years but on 11/11/11 they seriously screwed up.  Some colleagues of mine and I decided we wanted their pizza for lunch, so I placed the order online about ten minutes before they opened.  25 minutes later, I called to confirm.  The man who answered put me on hold and left me there.  I called back, again, to confirm the order using the confirmation number I had.  He angrily told me they had no orders and hung up.  Wha-wha-what?  So I called back and asked for the manager.  He claimed TO BE the maanager!  This atrocious customer service is the giant screw up I speak of.  He had insisted that I place the order again, after my bank had sent me a text message that my debit card had been charged.  It took two of my colleagues three more calls to sort it out - a total of 5 phone calls to sort out a minor error that should've taken 1 call, if any.  The pizza we ordered at 10:50am arrived at 12:41pm, leaving me 19 minutes to \"enjoy\" it before a meeting.

The food is not spicy (at best, one can hope for a mild tang that hints at peppers being somewhere in the restaurant), more Indian places are now delivering, and, in my last (as in, final) order from Zante, the manager repeatedly lied to me about when the food would arrive.  It was a dark and stormy night, and my wife and I were taking refuge in the solace of an evening at home with some tasty Indian takeout.  The manager at Zante told us that the food would be about forty-five minutes.  An hour later, I called and was told that the order would be another fifteen minutes.  No problem, I thought, the weather is terrible, and lots of people are probably ordering from Zante.  Half an hour later, I called back and was told that it would be another fifteen minutes, which turned out to be true, and our lukewarm, bland Indian food finally arrived.\n\nAs a former pizza delivery driver, I can certainly attest to the misfortune which can befall one's food, but the job of the manager is to ensure customer satisfaction, and part of that job is setting expectations appropriately.  If I had been told the truth initially about when my food would arrive, yes, I probably would have ordered from another place, but I might have ordered from Zante again later.

We ended up deviating to some other cheap eats.\n\nThe contestants:  Lers Ros Thai, Fritzj, Adobo Hobo, Pizza Hacker, Gumbo Cart, Lumpia Cart, Bi-Rite Creamery, El Farolito, Bacon Dog Cart, Pho Garden, Zante's Indian Pizza\n\nThis review is about Zante's Indian Pizza.  It was somewhat interesting how we got to eating at this restaurant.  When we were talking with all the food cart guys and swapping good eats, one guy mentioned that a place called Zante's was incredible for Indian pizza.  Of course this piqued my interest as I love Indian food AND pizza so I made a mental note of it.  Then towards the end of our weekend of cheap eats, we were going to finish off the night at a place called the Limon Rotisserie but apparently it was too far out of the way for a friend so she recommended a place called the Front Porch in case we didn't have enough grease.  When I called in to make a reservation for 8pm, they weren't able to accommodate us right away so I hunkered down for the wait.  That's when a completely different friend mentioned that there was a supposedly great Indian pizza restaurant nearby called Zante's!  Apparently this place always had a wait but we figured we might as well wait for it and if our rezos at Front Porch came along first, we could just walk over.  Well, lucky us the manager was willing to seat us right away!  \n\nWe ordered an extra large Indian pizza, some curry that was supposed to be just like chicken tikka masala, chicken tandoori, samosas, naan, chicken and vegetable Pakora.  The Pakoras were a hit!  The samosas and chicken tandoori were only okay unfortunately because I LOVE samosas but by far the most disappointing item was the chicken tikka-like curry.  It was pretty darn bad is all I can say.  That teaches us to order curry when the restaurant is famous for its pizza.  Now for the pizza.  The first words to fly out of my mouth were that is was interestingly GREAT!  I don't even know what was all in the pizza because there were so many toppings but it was great and all the ingredients all worked well together.  I remembered the shopped shrimp being a delightful surprise.  Well worth all the other obstacles (bad curry) to get there.  One thing to note was that I did not feel too great when I got home.  One of the girls I spoke with later told me that when she went to the bathroom during dinner she saw mouse droppings all over the staircase!  I personally didn't see it but that would explain my queasiness.  That being said, what I didn't see didn't really hurt me so I would still go back to try out the pizza again and see if it is still as good as I remembered!", "author": "Susan L."}

What could possibly be bad!?\n\nWell, they took over an hour to deliver for starters. Maybe they were busy, not sure, but it's definitely a reason to knock off a star. I ordered a small vegan pizza, and an order of chana masala. The pizza was stone cold, the crust soggy with condensation. Not dripping wet mind you, but enough to make (what I think was supposed to be) a normally slightly crunchy crust become chewy. No worries, I just stuck a couple pieces in the toaster oven, it happens right? The chana masala was still warm, as they covered the paper container in foil to keep the heat in. However, the paper container was completely soaked through with sauce. The normally white box, was now red. I was surprised that the entire thing didn't just dissolve. Anyhow, I poured it out of the container into a bowl, so at least it was salvageable. \n\nMy pizza slices were done in the toaster oven and they've actually toasted up nicely. I dished up my chana masala, and sat down to enjoy. Well, I would've enjoyed had there of been any flavor at all. I was expecting a flavor *explosion*! All it tasted like was they put un-seasoned saag all over some bread. I had to put salt on it, and I rarely use salt especially on my pizza. I also had to cover it in cock sauce (sriracha) to give it some sort of flavor. I thought that I might be able just to dip it in to the chana masala, but alas that was almost just as flavorless. I asked for medium, and it was as mild as it could get. I had to add chile to it as well. I wasn't impressed  by their selection of vegetarian curries either. \n\nThe service, aside from them taking forever to deliver, was ok. The delivery man was nice and cheerful. I did have to call and confirm that the order went through on line though, after not hearing back from them 1/2 an hour after I placed the order, but the guy on the phone was nice.\n\nI would maybe go back if I was in the area (I rarely am though) to try it there.

Also, the chicken tikka masala is significantly less greasy and heavy and more delicious than at many Indian restaurants in the city- notably, Naan and Curry. The chicken pekora does vary depending I guess if they just deep-fried it for you, but if they did, it's one of the best things ever, particularly with the spicy mint green and sweet tamarind dipping sauce. Perhaps the pizza isn't that great, and the atmosphere could be classed up, but the people are very nice and the Indian food, for the money, is consistently very good. It has a nice, homey vibe and it's usually not hard to get a table. Plus the delivery has gotten a LOT faster lately. I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants in the city, and I always go back to Zante for an tasty, affordable and dependable meal.

In general, they were pretty stingy with the meat toppings.  The sauce was decent, and just about the only good thing about the pizza.  On another occasion, I ordered the Chef's Special Thali.  The idea is better than the execution.  It's cool to be able to sample so many dishes in one meal, but not when half of them suck.  Free delivery is nice and all, but both times I ordered from here, it must have taken over an hour to get my food.  Additionally, a lot of stuff was spilling and the cartons were smushed.
