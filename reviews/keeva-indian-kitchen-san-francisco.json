We were in a rush but the restaurant accommodated our schedule and we were able to get the food and eat quickly.\n\nFirst thing you notice when you walk in was that even though it's a small-ish place, there are really cute decorations everywhere. It's a great neighborhood spot.\n\nThe food is pretty affordable as well. Most of the curries were in the $12-15 range. I was going to get a curry until I found out about the special of the night, which was tandoori fish ($25.99). I've never seen this dish before so decided to try it out. The fish they used was pompano.\n\nBefore ordering, I asked if it was spicy and they assured me it wasn't, but I have extremely low spice tolerance and it ended up being a little bit too spicy. I still managed to eat it though, just slowly and with plenty of rice. They only give one small scoop of rice to eat with the whole fish, which isn't nearly enough. I ran out of rice about halfway through the fish, especially because I was eating extra to balance out the spicy flavors. Also, I wish they had mentioned the price earlier when telling us about the special, as it was pricier than expected.\n\nPresentation was really nice though, especially given the casual and home-y environment of the restaurant. That was a pleasant surprise.", "author": "Dianna H."}

Indian is my comfort food when feeling a little delicate, so I decided to get delivery for dinner. I placed an order on Saturday, March 17th at 6:24pm. It arrived at 7:01pm. I live in Outer Richmond. Even though I was dining solo, I asked the roommate what he wanted and ordered for him as well.\n\n*Samosa: Puff pastry stuffed with potatoes and english peas ($6)\n*Breads ($2.75): Garlic Nan (+$0.75) x2, Onion Nan (+$1.20)\n*Chicken Tikka Masala: Tandoor grilled chicken cooked in creamy tomato sauce with smokey flavor ($13.95)\n*Chicken Vindaloo: Spices soaked in vinegar cooked with spices, a goan delicacy ($13.50)\n\nI adored the chicken vindaloo. So much flavor. And it had a good subtle heat. I tend to like my tikka masala a little creamier, so I didn't enjoy this one as much as the vindaloo. Judging from the pix, maybe I should have had the butter chicken instead. The naan was soft with a nice chew. But I didn't get much onion or garlic flavor in either one. Still, a good vehicle for the curries I ordered. I'm not eating fried foods at the moment, so I couldn't try the samosas. But the roomie seemed to enjoy them. Especially with the vindaloo. I used the mint chutney for my curry and nan.\n\nI've been wanting to try Keeva for some time, so I'm glad I finally did. Their vindaloo is excellent! I've read good things about their tandoori chicken. Next time the Indian craving hits, maybe I'll try that.", "author": "Elena N."}

After walking from Ocean Beach to Golden Gate and then across the bridge and back in that day's lovely weather, my friend and I were exhausted and ravenous. We still had some time to spare before the restaurant opened so my friend parked at the edge of Golden Gate Park which is a great stretch of road to park on because you don't have to worry if the space is big enough so that you're not blocking anyone's garage. From there we walked to Clement. \n\nI ordered two of my favorites: Palak Chaat and Mattar Paneer. The Palak Chaat was very gratifying with each bite full of texture and flavor. I am still in awe of this way of preparing spinach. The portion was the perfect size for me. The Mattar Paneer had an intense sunflower seed flavor that left a strong impression. It was a little disappointing that there were only two or so slices of paneer. And I would have preferred a thicker consistency. That and the lack of paneer made the Mattar Paneer more like a soup. I did end up being quite full and satisfied from what I ordered.", "author": "Lauren H."}

Unfortunately we felt let down and left with a broken promise.\n\nHere's the dig. All the best Indian restaurants are in South Bay. You need a sizable Indian diaspora to demand high quality and adequately spiced Indian food and not a concept of Indian food or fusion Indian food.\n\nThe service is great - super friendly and chatty. Prices are 70% higher than South Bay, but you can't put a price on really good food -except this wasn't worth the premium.\n\nWe tried a bunch of entrees after seeking recommendations. First off the biryani was over cooked rice and lacked flavor. Although we were spoilt by Hyderabad Dum Biryani and other South Bay staples, this one fell flat. The next best place is India Beach restaurant near Half Moon Bay.\n\nWe tried the paneer (cottage cheese) dish and the paneer was rubbery. The dish was so under spiced that we wondered if this was closer to hospital food than Indian food - OK that's a bit of a stretch but you get the drift.\n\nThe challenge isn't that the food was terrible, it wasn't, we just had high expectations, esp, since we have been exposed to a lot of great Indian food in the US and on our trips to India. \n\nI wouldn't go there again. The prices and food quality do not justify a second visit, however they may be having a bas day, so you may want to take a chance and convince us to go again.", "author": "Sam K."}

Positive vibes! \nThis place is well suited for both a quick work day dinner and/or an evening dinner date. Its like a Patagonia R2 midlayer - good for travel, running, the mountains and for work! You don't have to be formally dressed up to go here. But you may be underdressed if you forgot your trousers at home. \n\n-Chicken tikka masala: Melt in your mouth perfection. it was not perfectly balanced, not heavy. it was not greasy. portion size was just right. Nailed the seasoning and the spices. I can have this all day long, every day. 6/5 stars. yep 6/5 not 5/5.\n\n- Ambience: The best part about this place is you can walk in and walk out without your clothes smelling of grimy oily fried curry powder, unlike other Indian restaurants. well ventilated, Ambience 5/5\n\n-Chicken Biryani: Long grain rice/oily/ ummmm.... but wait......................where's the chicken, there's only rice here? 2/5 stars\n\n-Malai Chicken Kabab: Under cooked, under seasoned, huge pieces. It was served when I was almost done with my meal. 2/5 stars. Very disappointing. \n\n-Naan: Soaked in butter, but soft. Could do another 10 seconds more in the tandoor and a whole cube less of the butter, 3/5 stars. \n\n$55 is reasonable for SF standards. But the food is not really cheap either. especially when it can easily be executed and timed to perfection. Why did the malai kababs come out when i was almost done with my meal? That's a rookie move and one messes up the entire meal. \n\nThink about it, the main course comes out - piping hot and tasty. you start eating and then the appetizer arrives when you're almost done - huh ? wait should i pause eating the main course, let it get cold and dig into the appetizer ??? uh, i don't think so.  \n\nI was not offered a cancellation on the malai kabab despite leaving the full portion and all pieces on the table. this cannot be boxed up and eaten the next day because its best had fresh from the tandoor. \n\nI like this place but I left with an unpleasant feeling of having wasted ~ $15 on those malai tikkas.

It rates four stars...perhaps even 4.5 stars, which we cannot award due to the limitation of Yelp.\n\nSoup:  We found the Ginger Pepper Chicken soup flavorful, with a good amount of depth, and the chicken morsels were tender and juicy.\n\nThe samosa was not the usual breadcrumb-filled bland mouth-drying affair found in so many Indian (Bengali, Pakistani, Sikh etc.,) restaurants.  This samosa is juicy, with a moist interior filled with vegetables and very flavorful.  The outside was crisp, with its own unique flavor but not doughy\n\nThe Lamb Roganjosh was outstanding along with the Aloob Gobi Masala (cauliflower and potato in tomato ginger).  The lamb is NOT the usual bony lamb, nor does this lamb even hint at gristle so often found in cheaper cuts of lamb so often encountered elsewhere.  You'll find the meat dishes here plump, tender, juicy and tasty.\n\nA real winner is the Indian Eggplant in Salan sauce.  Shaped like large Jalape\u00f1o peppers but darker skinned, the Indian Eggplant is succulent, with a touch of firmness, yet soft and inviting to bite into!  Now, add the salan sauce, and coupled with rice, makes a fabulous mouth-watering treat.\n\nThe nan is also excellent...a touch greasy on the outside, but moist, tender, with just the slightest hint of crispness here and there.\n\nFood is spiced as follows: Mild, moderate and hot.  We found the mild to be easy to eat, perhaps maybe a touch too spicy for those whose palates are very sensitive.  Another visit, and we chose \"moderate\"...which was a touch spicy for us, but not enough that we were craving water nor needed to mop our brows.  Moderate was in fact, just a touch hotter than mild, which really isn't that hot.  (We've been to places where moderate would have you exhaling flames).  \n\nThe decor isn't fancy...it's kind of diner-restaurant like, but the place is clean.  On a scale of 0-10, it's a 5-5.5.  (2 or less would be a dump, which this establishment is clearly NOT).  We found parking outside easy, never parking more than 1/2 block away.  We are unsure of what transportation is nearby.

Keeva is pretty much the greatest thing to happen to Clement St since we moved to the Inner Richmond. It's a truly family-run business (as in it's normal for Rita's daughter to be running around the restaurant on a weeknight) and Rita is so open and friendly it almost feels like you are a guest in her home. The entire staff is just wonderful to be around, and the whole environment just makes me happy.\n\nThat alone would be enough for me to frequent this place, but on top of that I think it might legitimately some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Each dish is so thoughtfully crafted and presented you really can't go wrong, but if you're looking for recommendations the tandoori chicken and the biryani + ANY of the curries are the foundation of a fantastic meal. The biryani is usually enough for like 4 people and it's the most exciting rice I've ever had.\n\nI want Keeva to thrive and be there forever but I'm just dreading the day when I inevitably have to stand in line for 2 hours because everybody in SF found out about our favorite Indian place.", "author": "Daniel B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-08", "description": "I love it! An Indian restaurant recently popped up in the Richmond district, which has hitherto been a Chinese, Vietnamese or Thai stronghold. It is for sure a welcome addition to the dining scene on Clement. For a change, try some biryani instead of fried rice! Keeva took over a Thai place without much fanfare. The d\u00e9cor was not overdone but tastefully designed to be simple, clean and adorned with some fine artworks on the walls. Against the right wall was a long wooden bench with attractive cushions that were wrapped in exotic Indian-colored fabric.\n\nThe menu listed a few \"starters\" (oh so British!). Pakora ($6) seemed the most popular. Traditionally, pakora were served as deep-fried snacks like fritters. They caught my attention although I'm not even a big fan of fried foods. Keeva's version using a chickpea batter gave the pakora a unique crispy and nutty coating.  I personally liked that. The deep-frying was done almost perfectly without much grease but some pieces were still a tad soft and soggy. A duo of dippables, a dark colored tamarind and greenish mint chutney, were an awesome complement. (4/5)\n\nIt is rare to come across Egg Curry in a restaurant's menu. Perhaps it is now regarded as home style cooking. Nevertheless, it ranks high on my list of comfort foods. It is my favorite when I don't wish to have any chicken, meat or fish. I was told that Keeva's version is North Indian and I'll bet there are as many regional differences as there are egg sauces. Keeva is not about to disclose their recipes except to mention that the sauce is housemade with fresh tomatoes and onions. You can see why! The curry sauce was delicious and the heat level can be adjusted in accordance to your personal preference. The negative? Only 2 hard-boiled eggs lightly fried to form a delectable crust but at a steep price tag of $13.50! How much is the price of an egg nowadays? But the fact remained it was good....in fact damn good! (4/5) Cute name too \"Bang Bang Egg Curry\".\n\nChicken Tandoori (half $12.50; whole $24) in Keeva is a notch better than most. There was a fragrant crispy crust on the surface and blackened char on the edges and bones; the meat was moist, luscious and savory.  I would have preferred the chicken to be served on a hot sizzling plate with the chicken nestled on a bed of yellow onions and bell peppers. This way, the chicken would be kept warm while the tantalizing aroma filled the dining room. (4/5)\n\nI always have this preconceived notion that Indian food is rice and curry. In my mind, a perfect ending to an Indian meal would always be Lamb Vindaloo ($14.50), which is my favorite. The curry had a hint of sourness from the nuanced vinegary marinade. This is the Goan style that Keeva was attempting to replicate. A potpourri of Indian spices contributed to the complex and robust flavors. It was tongue tingling perfect, and scrumptiously memorable served at my desired level of heat.  The potatoes were firm and crunchy to the bite and the lamb was \"melt-in-your-mouth\" tender. (4/5)\n\nUnfortunately being located in a nondescript strip mall on Clement among the Chinese and Vietnamese cheap eats, the prices in Keeva do appear relatively pricey. We are of course comparing apples with oranges but there are people out there who don't care two hoots! Kudos to David G for his spot on review and I'm glad I tried all the dishes he recommended.", "author": "Geoff G."}

I ordered delivery (thru UberEATS) last night, and after my first bite of samosa, I already knew this is my new go-to for Indian. SO GOOD. Very flavorful. I also ordered the tikka masala, this was excellent as well. I made the error of ordering medium spicy. I definitely should've chosen mild (medium was just a little too much burn for me - I guess I got a little ambitious), but that's my fault.

I used to love that place on Haight and Fillmore years ago before it changed owners.\n\nWe had no place to go for Xmas eve and all the usual suspects were already fully booked.\n\nI searched Yelp for Highest rated indian food in SF, and this place popped up with about 87 reviews and 4.5 stars. I had never seen it before, and it looks like it has only been open about 2-3 months. I called to see if they were busy of if there was a line - \"nope\" they said.\n\nWe go there around 6:30, only one other table occupied. I had perused the photos and menu from the Yelp photos and had made my choices. Many reviews said they got free pakoras (They said they were no longer doing that but brought us some anyway) They were good enough that I would happily order them again. Kinda like onion rings but made with cauliflower, zucchini, some onions and other veggies.\n\nI told the owner about an indian restaurant I loved in the south bay: https://www.yelp.com/biz/satkar-indian-cuisine-sunnyvale\nhe said he had been there too - that he is always checking out other indian food restaurants to get ideas. He is a good guy and is really invested in his businesses success, this place is definitely a labor of love for him.\n\nWe ordered the samosas, the chicken tikka masala & the eggplant in peanut sauce, one onion nan and one garlic nan. He brought out our orders - PLUS a generous sample of a dal and an okra dish...both were also really good.  There were photos of a rack of lamb on Yelp - that he says some doctors from UCSF had been begging for, he hopes to put it in the menu permanently at some point, let me know I wanna try it!!!\n\nWe bought a bottle of wine we could not finish - but he had saved the screw top so we took home a lot of leftovers.\n\nThis is the kinda place you want to be a regular at - and after one visit - I feel like I already am, they were so generous. I would put money on the guy remembering us - even if it takes us a few months to get back there!\n\nI sent my man out for pastries from anywhere on Xmas morning - he came back empty handed saying \"everything was closed\", so we had leftover Indian food, might have been even better the next day and quite a festive Christmas breakfast!", "author": "Amy W."}

The two eggs are hard boiled in a flavorful, slightly sweet, curry sauce.  The grilled shrimp comes with a tiny salad, and are about medium in size.  The chana masala is more savory, and darker in color, than the other ones I've had in the past.\n\nIt's a little on the pricey side.  The average entree is around $13.95, including the egg curry.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-10", "description": "When deciding to come here yesterday, I was thinking to myself - what's up with all the \"hands down\"\n\nShredy wrote a review that said, and I quote, \"Hands down the best indian food\" - and Janet wrote, again to quote, \"Hands Down the best Tandoori place in the bay!\" and so on. My work colleague said it was \"hands down the best saag (Indian spinach dish)\" he has ever eaten and traditional in style (not that creamy buttery mess that most places have). \n\n5 min drive from my place, easy parking on a rainy day in the city when people stay in --- all right, why not, let's try it.\n\nMy wife is raised in Delhi and her father is a tremendous cook. My Mom is an off the charts Indian cook. Our bar is pretty high. So I don't expect much either from Indian restaurants -usually I go to Indian places as \"comfort food\" - it's fatty but yummy, fills you up, you feel happy, you go home, you pass out. Given all the \"hands down\" I was hoping this place wasn't going to be that. So we ordered:\n\nStarter:\nHara bara kebab\nIt's relatively rare to find this appetizer. It's simple sounding but hard to make well. This was the best I have had in many many years. WOW. Perfect texture. Perfect balance. Practically melted in my mouth upon first bite. Amazing. Now I had high hopes for the rest of the meal.\n\nDish 1:\nGoat Curry Classic\nMy wife gew up eating goat and not lamb. She never orders goat at places since again, master chef Dad makes insanely good goat at home. We ordered it here. Fantastic. Flavorful. Spicy but not too spicy. Spot on.\n\nDish 2:\nTandoor chicken half\nSTAR OF THE SHOW\nWhat in the freaking world? Are you kidding me? On Clement street? Did this just happen?\nPresentation was lovely. Side chutney paired perfectly. Chicken was cooked absolutely perfectly, and that is the FIRST time in SF I can say that about tandoori chicken. Reminded me of the best of Delhi actually. I will likely order this every single time I come, it's just that good\n\nSide smaller dish:\nAloo Matar\nSimple dish, but again, it's all about authenticity and freshness and they do it well. \n\nDessert\nRas Malai\nSmall light dessert, but the presentation was unique, I've never seen it like that. They had this foam on top of the ras malai itself (high end restaurant dessert style influence?). Creative!\n\nPRICES:\nI put this in caps since I think people have it all wrong. \"It's a little expensive for Indian\"  seems to be in some reviews. That's like saying Californios (Michelin Star, 4.5 Yelp review) is \"expensive for Mexican food\" -- dude, not all food from a culture is created equal!!! Nobody goes to Kokkari and says \"this is expensive for Greek food\" comparing it to your local lunch spot that serves gyros.  Yes, if this was cream heavy, butter heavy, not so fresh typical Indian takeout at $10 a dish, sure, it's a few bucks a dish bit more than that. But for the quality and presentation, it was worth every penny and I think actually their prices are beyond fair for the quality, vs some Indian places at $8 a person I find over priced for the quality. \n- tl:dr version --- you get what you pay for, and the quality to price ratio here is an A+\n\nOverall, I walked out knowing we will be back, having had the best tandoori chicken I've had at a restaurant in decades (sorry, Amber, you're not even close), feeling like SF finally had an Indian restaurant that I look forward to and don't feel fat the next day after eating. You must try this place ASAP and my hope is that it's super successful so I can be coming here for a long time.", "author": "Sai S."}

What a gem of a find in the Inner Richmond! \n\nI visited for lunch with co-workers and had one of the most well-balanced meals in terms of size and variety in quite some time. Even with the limited options ((1) a vegetarian combo or (2) a non-vegetarian combo), we were satisfied with what was offered and came away pretty full.\n\nI recently ordered delivery and thought, certainly, this would be the test. Often restaurants are great when you dine-in but flub it up when it comes to delivery or takeout. That was not the case. My meal arrived on time and piping hot, and all of the items that could have potentially spilled (sauces,  mango lassi) were tightly wrapped up in saran wrap so as to prevent any messes. I ordered the chicken biryani, samosas, an extra side of biryani rice, tandoori naan, and mango lassi to split with my partner. Everything was delicious, well-seasoned, and the chicken in the biryani was SO MOIST (none of that bland white meat to be found!). We had enough for two meals and can't wait to go back for more.\n\nGlad to have a nearby Indian option that's tasty, affordable, and not going to make you feel gross/greasy at the end of it.", "author": "Bianca P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-01", "description": "I come and visit from Socal often, and try to make it to Keeva's while I'm up here if possible. \n\nIn my opinion this is honestly one of the better Indian restaurants I've been to states side. A major complaint I have with a lot of Indian restaurants in the US is that the curries start to all taste like variations of Tikka Masala with too many creams and too much liquid. Dishes at Keeva have all been very distinct tasting to me, with their iteration of Chicken Tikka Masala itself really standing out for having the spices more pronounced than an overflowing amount of bland cream and sauce. \n\nFor me so far though, the real stand out has been their Dal Makhani, which has a delicious creamy, buttery texture but the spices and lentils tasting strong.In fact all of the vegetarian dishes have been surprisingly really stand out, such as Aloo Gobi Masala and I really recommend even the most ardent meat eaters to consider trying them. That said though, the Chicken Vindaloo is also delicious. The presentation of all of these dishes has been consistently wonderful as well.\n\nI haven't tried any of the Tandoor Kebabs yet though I really want to.\n\nI have to give particular note to Keeva's lunch special as well. A simple choice between a vegetarian or non vegetarian set of 3 sampler curries or paneers, a small bit of salad, and some rice and naan. For someone who likes meals made up of samplers like myself, it's a great and simple lunch.\n\nI could maybe understand the criticism I've seen a few times that the food might be a bit too light for people who want heavier (and some would say more traditionally Indian) spiciness as the food's default is a little more of a locally palatable heat, however it is possible to ask for the spiciness of something to be upped upon ordering.\n\nService has been consistently friendly, prompt, and relaxed.\n\nAll and all, I really recommend giving this place a try if you can, as I believe it has the potential to be a local stand out in the Richmond area. It already stands out in a sea of bland cream curries.", "author": "Maximillian F."}

We walked in to Keeva, and, !Surprise!, the previous owners of Saffron Grill (on Divis) have opened this new restaurant!  \n\nThis is a brand new place, so the menu has changed, but what I loved about Saffron Grill is still present at Keeva Indian Kitchen.  My entree (palak paneer) had a distinctly fresh quality that I always loved at Saffron Grill (saag paneer there).  Delicious naan, mango lassi, plenty left over for lunch the next day.\n\nWe'll definitely be back.", "author": "Jessica A."}

My husband and I have come here at least once a week since we first discovered Keeva, and it's not even in our neighborhood. My honey ALWAYS orders the palek paneer. I rotate between a chicken dish or lamb roganjosh, and usually add in a third veg dish of bhindis, eggplant, or the aloo gobi. They are all fantastic. In the world of SF Indian food, I used to be a devoted Guddu follower (Guddu de Karahi, and Lahore Karahi back when Guddu still owned it). When Guddu closed shop in SF, I thought I'd never find Indian food I consistently loved again. Well, thank goodness that problem has been fixed! Additionally, I must give mad props to the staff at Keeva who - each and every visit- make us feel at home & provide prompt and attentive service. The price is higher than your tenderloin Indian restaurant classics, but the quality of the meat and veggies is well worth it. 10 Stars!", "author": "Jen H."}

For instance I was presented with spinach-samosa starter which tasted amazing and looked even better. The chef has a very creative approach for adding new fragrance and taste to the authentic indian dishes which is a big challenge since its very difficult to change the popular dishes that indians have been eating for a long time. The presentation of the food is world class, wont lie but even better than some Michelin star restaurants I have been to.

So I finally decided to order pick up for lunch through Eat24. There were only 2 lunch specials, a non-vegetarian and a vegetarian option. I went for the non-veg option since it comes with chicken Tikka Masala! It also comes with cumin rice, Chana Masala, and a salad. It was $11 for this lunch special which was not too bad. As I went in to pick up my order, I was surprised to see that it was completely empty since it was during the lunch hour. But I didn't think too much of it since it is a newer restaurant and it has good Yelp reviews so far. I picked up my order, which was ready to go and brought it back to my office. My order was packaged inside a plastic black container and it was huge! I was surprised how much food there was and it smelled delicious! The chicken Tikka masala was juicy and packed full of flavor with the spices. This went great with the rice. The Chana Masala was also very tasty. And the salad was very refreshing. I was so full by the end of my meal, that I didn't eat dinner until almost 9pm. Lol. Anyways the lunch specials are definitely worth it and it can probably last you 2 meals! I only wish that they had more options for their lunch specials. Regardless, my coworkers now want to try out this place too.", "author": "Mary C."}

New-ish place on Clement Street and so glad that we came here.  We received a warm welcome when we walked through the door and had our choice of seats since it was still early evening.  They had nice pillows and table settings and the atmosphere was very homey.  They were also very accommodating to young kids.  The woman who greeted us and took our order (i'm assuming one of the owners) was awesome. Very friendly and came with paper and pen to occupy our hungry little ones while we waited for our food.\nWe ordered the Samosas and the Vegetable Hara Bhara Kebab for starters. Both dishes were delicious. But our favorite was the Hara Bhara Kabab. These were little crunchy fritters made with spinach, cheese and potato.  Every bite was delicious! My kids couldn't get enough of them so we ordered some to go.  The samosas were also wonderful, the crust was perfectly crispy and the filling was full of flavor and had a nice consistency. Not dry but not mushy either.\nFor the main course we had the Lamb Korma, Bhindi do Piazza (okra), Malai Tikka Kebab, Rice, Plain and Garlic Naan. \nThe Korma was creamy and thickened with cashews, delicious! The lamb was tender and flavorful and not at all gamy.  My son couldn't get enough of the sauce, he scraped off every last bit with his naan.\nWe love okra and originally wanted the Cripy Okra but they are not currently making that at the moment so we went with the Bhindi do Piazza.  This dish was stir fried with onions, tomatoes and spices. Very good and had great flavor.  \nThe Malai Tikka Kebab surprised me in a good way.  We ordered this just in case the kids didn't want to eat the other dishes, but we all ended up fighting for the last piece.  It is boneless chicken in a creamy marinade and grilled to perfection.  It was juicy and full of flavor.\nWhen the naan was brought to the table my kids both gasped because it came still steaming and gleaming with butter/ghee. they were chewy and crispy at the same time and great addition to the meal. \nGive this new restaurant some love and go here or get delivery.  If we still lived in the city this place would be a staple weekly meal.", "author": "Maria B."}

Not only did the owner and her family welcome us in with open arms but so did her beautiful children who were playing in the back (an added bonus in my opinion!) We felt as though we were at a friends house for dinner and the food was great. I think it was the best Lamb Korma I have ever eaten and that's including the Indian restaurants home in NY. Not only was the food great but we started up a conversation with the owner who took it upon herself to map out the rest of our trip with help from a nearby table of regulars.

Basically flash fried spinach piled high on a plate with drizzles of cream and another (cilantro or mint?) sauce, sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.

We usually go to Roti in West Portal for Indian food. \nThe food portions are very generous. I would have rated the food four, but my wife did not like much of what we ordered finding the fish too greasy and some of the vegetarian dished with\nthings that did not taste good.\nThey show pint beer servings and the price is set accordingly.  A pint is sixteen ounces but\nthey serve beer in eleven ounce bottles.  That is a ripoff and probably contrary to the law.\n\nThey show a number of fish dishes on the menu. However, they only had some fried, farmed, fried tilapia which was a very generous portion which my wife found to be too greasy.\nThey claimed they didn't like to buy fish because they never knew how much to order and they didn't want to over order because they would wind up throwing it out.  They have one of the best fresh fish markets in San Francisco right across the street from them that is even open on Sundays.  Their prices are 30-50% below shops whose freshness and quality are hard pressed to meet.  It wouldn't be that difficult to walk across the street and pick up fish once guests order.\nThey need to get their act in order and run this as a business or they will not be around very long.", "author": "michael s."}

It's great to finally have an Indian restaurant in that neighborhood, which is dominated by Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese cuisine. Our server was really personable and even recommended some of the dishes we ordered over others we were considering. She seemed to tune into our tastes that night. They were fairly busy, so service was slightly inattentive, but they really made up for that fact with the tastiness of the food and the friendliness of the staff. We ordered the veggie hara bhara kebab (her recommendation - delicious and satisfied our fried craving), the palak paneer (their paneer is to die for, so creamy), the veggie biryani and the garlic naan with a side of raita.

I have frequented most of the Indian/Pakistani places in SF and other parts of the Bay Area and being an SF resident I wouldn't always want to drive all the way to South Bay or Fremont/East Bay for some \"good desi khana\". With Keeva setting shop in my neighborhood I can say that my hunt is over. \nThey have the right mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The appetizers would make you want more, especially their Veg Hara Bhara Kebab. On the main course I would highly recommend Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Chettinad. And if you are craving for some tandoori then Tandoori Chicken and their special Tandoori Wings are must haves. We also had a chance to try their Channa Masala and Crusted Cumin potatoes and we were for sure not disappointed. The biryanis are great too and if you become a regular or have small parties then Ajit (the owner) and the chef can whip up some special items on request. We once had Chicken Dum Biryani on request-to-order and it was really good. \nKeeva is a must try for anyone who yearns for some mouth watering Indian fare.

I have a bias against most Indian Restaurants as i have incredible Indian cooks in my family.  Every dish my family and I tried at this place was fantastic.  Appetizers, Main Course and Dessert, all were fantastic.  The owner even made a few dishes for us that were not on the menu.  Seriously taste and quality of food drive my family of foodies and this is our favorite Indian restaurant in the city.", "author": "Piyush P."}

We asked if they had a specific lamb dish on the menu, and they did not, but the chef/owner made it for us.    The tomato/cilantro soup was amazing.   Great restaurant!", "author": "Vicky L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-15", "description": "This little gem offers some of the tastiest Northern Indian cuisine in the city. Tucked away on Clement street it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood! It has a cozy atmosphere with some very cool and colorful artwork and decor. I went there yesterday with a friend of mine and we started off with the pakoras which were very tasty. I ordered for myself the butter chicken along with garlic naan. The sauce was so flavorful along with the tender chicken. I had to order more naan to sop up the rest of the sauce! My friend ordered a vegetarian dish of lentils (which I forgot the name of) along with some rice which he said he enjoyed. We also shared a half order or tandoori chicken (also comes in whole) and that bird was so juicy! The spices and flavors were spot on but I was was really impressed how the tender the chicken was. The chicken also came with a spot of salad on the side which was enough as a refresher. The service was great and Rita, our server, was so friendly and helpful with the menu. Overall Keeva is a great Indian restaurant and if you're looking for some tasty and spicy comfort food, this is the place. I will definitely be a repeat customer there!", "author": "Jeffrey N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-18", "description": "Absolutely awesome! This is my favorite Indian restaurant in all of US, no other Indian restaurant even comes close. I avoid going to Indian restaurants in SF, most of them are below average, especially because I can make great Indian food at home. We had the classic lamb curry, bang bang egg curry, pakoras, amritsari fish, lamb biryani & naans on two different days. They are well spiced, delicious and not over the top. We are regulars now, we love this place.", "author": "Sujata M."}

Amidst a city of Indian buffet lunch options, it's a treat to have freshly prepared, bright & colorful, aromatic and tasty Indian food and at a comparable price. Everything was delicious and the presentation was top notch. My wife and I each ordered one of the lunch selections (veggie or non-veggie) and shared. Each came with a green salad, basmati rice, pakora, naan and three (yes, three!) dishes.  So nice to have this addition in the neighborhood. We also enjoyed chatting with Rita, the owner. Very friendly! We look forward to our next meal at Keeva.", "author": "Toby S."}

The food was so fresh and it tasted very home made, which we hadn't really discovered with other Indian restaurants.  We ordered a spinach dish that was such a bright shade of green it seemed like they had just harvested the spinach!  And it was so delicious!  Everything was amazing.  I can't wait to eat there again.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Keeva!", "author": "Nikki C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-02", "description": "We are so delighted that this restaurant has come to our neighborhood. Clement Street is well known for having many terrific Asian options, but the addition of an Indian restaurant provides some welcome culinary diversity, and we went to try it with high hopes; we were thrilled by the food. We went with our 8 year old and found the place to be very friendly for children. We ordered Pakora, Chicken Curry Chetinad, Eggplant in Salan sauce, Dal Makhani, Vegetable Biryani, and a Mango Lassi. Every dish was fresh, interesting and delicious, and the eggplant was a particular favorite. I would recommend everything we ordered. The flavors were unique and distinct from other Indian dishes we have tried, and we have lived in many cities. The Lassi is the perfect size for a child, and was also very tasty. The service was prompt, but also friendly and relaxed, and the atmosphere was cozy and simple. It is the sort of place where the waitress might offer to hold your baby, and her daughter might stop by to say hello. We look forward to returning to try more dishes.", "author": "Maya V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-18", "description": "Disclaimer to the 2 stars: the food was very good, but our delivery experience was awful! We ordered a large order (naans, curry, biriyani, pakodas) on Friday evening and were really excited to try Keeva because of the great ratings and proximity to us. We ordered via ubereats. An hour later ubereats delivered someone else's order to us from Keeva! We called the restaurant to clarify and they admitted that there was an order switch during pickup. While they tried to help us get our original order back, neither uber nor the restaurant could help us. We had to end up eating some one else's food which was way spicier than we like it and far less in quantity than our original order. The 2 stars is because the restaurant mentioned on call that this kind of switcheroo has happened before. If this is the case, both uber and Keeva need to address the issue ASAP! Such a shame, because the food we ate, while spicy, was still really good!", "author": "Supriya G."}
