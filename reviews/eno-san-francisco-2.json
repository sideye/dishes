It's modern, charming, somewhat intimate and moderately priced.\n\nI took a date to ENO last week and we were seated next to the window by a charming server who was happy to answer questions about the menu. He provided us both with a taste of his favorite wine on the menu and gave recommendations for others that may be more up our alley -- we ended up ordering a glass of Zinfandel and a red blend. \n\nFood-wise, we both ordered the prosciutto, pesto and arugula sandwich. I thought it was delicious, and judging off my date's empty plate, it's safe to say he did too.", "author": "Bryan D."}

Last week, I finally got the chance to try it out, and I would say my initial assumptions were mostly correct. \n\nThere's a long list of wine flights, from whites to reds to sparkling. There's definitely a lot to choose from, and the typical flight is ~$20. Since my friend and I were starving, we ordered the flight and decided to splurge on the Eno Experience, Baked Brie, and Coppa Flatbread. \n\nThe wine was okay but I didn't really have any favorites in the flight I chose (a New Zealand flight of two reds and a white). Usually, I have at least one favorite. The food is pretty expensive. For the ENO Experience, you get a couple small cheeses, some slices of salami, and ONE chocolate. How are you supposed to share just one chocolate?? At least give two.. \n\nThe baked brie was not as runny as it should've been, and the flavor of the brie and jam were too subtle. There definitely could have been more fruitiness in this dish. The flatbread was probably the best part of the meal, but even that could've used some more flavor. This place is nice to people watch and have a nice conversation, but the quality of the bites could use some work.", "author": "Sophie W."}

I had always been eying our ENO, and finally got my chance to try it out today...and I'm glad I did! Located in the heart of Union Square, this place is easy to get to by bus or Bart. If I could describe ENO in 3 words, I'd describe it as cozy, romantic, and chic. The interior is invitingly modern, with just the perfect amount of light for the perfect date night or hang out spot. I'd say that ENO exudes the Danish concept of \"hygge\" (coziness).\n\nMy friend and I both shared the portobello flat bread, charcuterie platter, and one of the chocolate plates. Portions are kind of small, but enough to fill you if you have a small appetite. It was enough for my friend and me since we weren't the hungriest. Plus we were enjoying our food and wine, so we got fuller faster since we were eating slowly. We both did a wine flight each. I did the End of the World wine flight-- I wanted to sample some red wines from the more isolated, remote area of the world. The three wines were from Humboldt, Patagonia and Margaret River. At first, I felt that the wines didn't have much character, but as I continued sipping and airing them, their flavors came out more boldly. They paired well with the charcuterie plate, so I'd recommend this wine flight with it! \n\nThe service here is friendly and attentive. We were looked after graciously, asked the wines/food were, and were refilled with water throughout our dining experience. \n\nI'd like to come back here to sample some more wines!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-14", "description": "As much as I like that fancy feeling you get when holding that delicate wine stem, and gingerly sipping on an Argentinian wine I am less of a wine-bar kinda girl than I am a beer bar kinda girl.  I like wine - I really do, but I'd rather be hunched over a beer with a craft beer any day.  Regardless, the wine bar was an experience that I wouldn't have passed up.  Had I the energy, I'd likely have gone to some other wine bars in the city, but as this was the closest one to my hotel, my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to wander in here.  We actually tried to come to ENO once before our dine-in, but were unable to enter due to there supposedly being a \"private event\" going on...funny, I didn't see anyone except the workers in the shop during this so-called event.\n\nOn the second time that we tried to come to ENO we were allowed in, and sat by the window on a nice spring night.  Upon walking through the wine bar I admired the tranquil, laid-back feel it was attempting to encompass, but I couldn't help but feel out of place.  No matter, that is more of a personal opinion - what truly matters is that the lovely lady serving us was extremely kind and helpful in offering wine pairing suggestions.  There's a descent variety of wine offerings, though I would have almost expected more.  With that being said, there were plenty of wines found on this list that I have not found elsewhere.  While I enjoyed a delectable Argentinian wine, my fianc\u00e9 indulged in a red wine from New Zealand.  Both were very robust, yet drinkable, though I think that is the general line for all their wines here at ENO.  My complaint is with the price; there's simply not much to say other than ENO is a little over-priced.\n\nThe same story goes for the food, which mostly consists of cheese and charcuterie boards along with chocolate and other finger food.  To me, it seemed as if they had simply thrown together some cheese and meat, knowing that people would consume it while drinking wine, instead of deliberately choosing and pairing legitimately good cheese, meats and crackers.  To put it simply, I was underwhelmed by ENO.  I did not hate the food, but I've had better.  The wine was definitely good, but I would prefer to drink my wine at home and my beer when I'm out on the town.  Now, just a note - if you want to enjoy the food with your wine, make sure you get there by 10pm (I think) because that is when they stop serving the food.  \n\nENO is in a very convenient location, and therefore attracts more tourists (myself included), but I would actually make an effort to travel further out of your way to some of the other wine bars that exist in San Francisco.  This is a fine business, but it's not my favorite.  Sorry, I've still not converted to a wine bar fanatic at this point.", "author": "Lauren K."}

My friend suggested we meet here because of its proximity to Union Square, but also because of it's ambiance. She chose well - from the moment I stepped into Eno, I relaxed and enjoyed myself. We had a cute (small) table by the window, with a nice view of people bustling by.\n\nOur waitress was very nice and super knowledgeable. She gave us more than enough time to be indecisive, but answered every question thoroughly. I picked the champagne flight and a flatbread. I had no idea I was picking so well!\n\nFirst off, the bubbles. The flight was not the same as in the menu, but I don't care because it was awesome. Every single glass was delicious, although my favorite was the Kreinbacher Furmint Brut. Or maybe it was the Iron Horse Rainbow Brut! All were great.\n\nOn top of that, my flatbread was delicious. Coppa (salami), caramelized onions, and Gouda. Whoa!! Perfect. I will probably dream of this meal when I'm home, far from SF. Maybe I can make it back before I leave...", "author": "Deb G."}

We wanted to grab a drink before dinner and we strolled in at about 4:30 PM on a Friday. It was fairly quiet with only a few tables occupied. Our host greeted us and led us to a table by the fireplace. \n\nWe sat around for about 10 minutes wondering if someone was going to bring us menus or give us water. After some irritation, I walked up to the bar and asked for menus and brought them back to our table. \n\nThey have a vast selection of wines which pleasantly surprised me, and ultimately was the saving grace in this case. \n\nMy mom decided to go with a featured wine flight and I opted for the bubbly flight. \n\nAfter having to approach the bar in search of service once, we figured they'd get the hint and be more attentive to us - but no. This time my mom headed up to the bar, where servers were hanging out, and proceeded to give them our order. \n\nOur flights were delicious and the pours are generous. I loved the champagne on my flight so much, I wanted to purchase a bottle there, but couldn't stomach paying $60 for champagne with them after service was lacking so much. I did a quick search online and was able to find the bottle for $20 cheaper online- score!\n\nOverall, I definitely loved their selections and the variety of wines they have available. If the wine selection wasn't that good, my rating would be much lower.  Service could be improved tremendously though, and I hope it does. I may back if in the area for a flight, and hope to encounter better customer service.", "author": "Lainey L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-29", "description": "Who knew that there was a place where you can get away from all the madness outside that is San Francisco's Union Square and it's right on the first floor of the legendary Westin St. Francis Hotel? Well Eno Wine Bar might just be the perfect place to calm yourself and get away from it all, whether it be with a friend to converse, a intimate escape with a loved one or a place to cool off on your own. Eno Wine Bar has that smooth and sophisticated atmosphere of a wine bar in the city and then some with its two dimly lit intimate rooms, one that has a sofa and fireplace and the other a little more restaurant-like with a collage of wine bottles decorating the walls. I had never heard of Eno before, and obviously never knew it was a franchise in quite a number of posh venues around the country, so to get to try this place on a weekend afternoon was a real treat.\n\nI was out with friends who were looking to avoid all the shopping madness when we arrived at Union Square on a Saturday afternoon and my friend suggested we try this place out because she had only walked by before and realized this location was no longer the clothing store it once was and she always wanted to try it out. Thankfully we got there at noon on Saturday and it was just in time to see them open for business. I was game but also it was early and I didn't want to get too tipsy and I wasn't very hungry. She suggested we go for a chocolate and wine pairing tasting and our server Joel happily obliged us. Meanwhile a friend who accompanied us was really not into drinking at all so he went with a bottle with the non-alcoholic Lurisia Sparkling Chinotto Orange Citrus ($5).\n\nThe normal Port and Chocolate Pairing they serve at Eno Wine Bar ($39) normally contains three different types of Port (LBV, Tawny and Vintage) served alongside three of their truffles (Champagne, Caramel & Sea Salt and Dark Chocolate Madagascar). This time my friend really wanted to try a sweet wine like Moscato. So Joel accommodated us with Moscato, a Madeira from off the coast of Africa, and a 10 year old Tawny Port served with Salted Caramel and Almond Butter Chocolates made by NeoCocoa and a Madagascar Dark Chocolate made by Recchiuti Chocolates. Everything from the presentation of the chocolate served on a plate with a heavy dusting, which included the Eno name spelled out in big bold letters, to the flavors of the Ports and the wines were truly exceptional. I just wish there was more chocolate and wine to consume that afternoon. Eno represented a great place to unwind as if it were a local watering hole to meet your friends after a busy day. Sure it's a bit pretentious and a smidge overstuffed, but that's what living in the big city is all about and with Eno now firmly planted in San Francisco there is no better place to wind down.", "author": "Jason F."}

Loved the ambiance and the whole vibe of the place! It's kind of like a hole in the wall but more like a mini Napa on the street. Entering the place my friend and I felt a little underdressed but the waiters all were friendly and nice not judging us at all with our casual attire. Although i have never been carded twice before but I guess it's just standard since my friend and I look so young. It was a rainy day and wine was just a nice pair to the mood so my friend and I thought of coming here to have a catch up date. \n\nFor the wine: definitely go straight to the wine flights if you don't know what wine you absolutely love. I find their wine flights names so cute and punny. In the end my friend really likes white wine so we shared an alpine white wine flight. The waitress was so nice with explaining what each wine was and not judging us for our naive knowledge of wine. We loved two of the wines that came with the flight which was the far left and right. The middle wine was a bit too earthy for us, reminded me of a distinct smell you smell in a garden. \n\nFor the food: we just ordered a starter of bread that comes with olive oil and a few pieces of grapes. The bread went well with the wine. \n\nOverall: will definitely come again!!! Maybe with friends or with my boyfriend. This place really has a romantic and cozy vibe to it.\n\nPS.

We were able to get a nice table at the window which is always a plus because there such great people watching in Union Square. We ordered some food and I decide to order a champaign flight. My husband was excited to order from the \"bucket list\" menu because there were some interesting old world reds that he wanted to try. The food wasn't bad as the charcuterie and salad were tasty. The flat bread came out pretty quickly and it was nothing more than a reheated frozen pizza. \nMy hubby suspected that the wines he tasted ( half glass of each ) weren't consistent with he ordered and he brought this to our server's attention. She reassured us that the wines were indeed what we ordered by bringing over the bottle. He was very skeptical about the entire show but I thought he was just being picky so I told him to chill out. Then the bill came out. The bill itself was correct however the suggested tips were outrageously wrong.  Our total before tax was $125 that makes 18% tip $22.50 with tax out total was 135.94 and 18% of that would be 24.45. Their suggested 18% tip was 32.58! That's $10 more than it should be.

I recommend the nearby parking structures (specifically the one on Sutter/Stockton St) or taking pubic transit to get to this area.\n\nWalked in on a Saturday - early evening - and there was no wait. Found ourselves a table and seated ourselves (where we liked, of course!). Bottles of wine line the walls as a decor.\n\nPlenty of wine choices on the menu. You can order by the glass or pick the pre-fixe wine flights they have to offer. They also have cheese flights and chocolate flights to pair with your wine flights!\n\nWe ordered the Urban Legends wine flight (red wines from the Bay Area) and the Pesto Flatbread to share. Pesto flatbread was cut into 8 pieces and served with garlic oil - tasty!\n\nThe only thing was our server wasn't super friendly. We would say 'thank you' when he came by to set our table, refill our water, give us our check, etc., but he wouldn't say anything back.

Chicago, Coronado, Laguna, San Diego, Washington D.C. and, of course, San Francisco.\n\nEno's SF location is great - just off Union Square.  Its a 3 block walk from the Powell Street BART, but that walk is a bit uphill.  The space is modern and well-lit, with a fireplace in the back room.  One negative on the space is that the two bathrooms are right one wall in the larger room and everyone knows everyone else's bathroom business.  A little curtain might be a good idea.\n\nThe wine list is amazing!  They have a wonderful breadth of wines in each category.  Highly recommend the wine flights to try as many of their unique wines as possible.\n\nOur server was incredibly knowledgeable, but perhaps stayed at the table just a tad too long sharing their knowledge.

My husband actually went to an Eno Wine Bar in Chicago and had such a great time there, so he really wanted to come here.\n\nWe first went there at 2:30, only to be informed that it actually opened at 3pm. When it was 3:05, we went back and were told that it actually opened at 3:30. At this point, our friends wanted to have drinks at Cheesecake factory but it was going to be about a 25 minute wait. While we were waiting, we though well if we are going to wait the same time for Cheesecake, let's go back to Eno. Thankfully, they were open.\n\nThey didn't have three of the Nebiollo (bottle and glass) options from the menu (disappointing), but the waitress mentioned why not do the Nebiollo tasting. When we pointed out that one of the Nebiollo choices (which came in a bottle version and one we tried to order) was not available, the waitress than said, oh we have another one. Okay...\n\nThen, we ordered several cheese plates and asked if one choice was the soft cheese, as indicated on the menu. The waitress than told us the kitchen decided to swap it out because...well the kitchen just decided. Okay...\n\nAll in all, this is a great romantic place and love the concept. But it felt like this time, there were just too many things missing, not available, replaced etc... without us knowing which was...annoying and disappointing for a wine bar. In fact, my husband said that the Eno in Chicago would tailor each cheese to a wine making the experience very personable. So overall, an a-ok experience for me.", "author": "Charlotte W."}

Eno Wine Bar is a lovely, cozy bar with a great menu and wine selections. They had cheese, wine, chocolate and even deviled egg flights which was a fun way to try everything. The d\u00e9cor was classy and cozy, perfect for catching up with friends. \n\nFood:\n1. The flatbreads are AMAZING. Seriously, you have to get one in every flavor because they're all so different but so great. The bacon and goat cheese flatbread was hands down everyone's favorite, but the tomato flatbread was addictive too. The flatbreads are crispy and down right umami, you will not regret getting this.\n2. The appetizer platter - I quite enjoyed this. The cheese, bread and meats were all delicious, but I might not order it again as it was good, but not a standout. (Probably would just get more flatbread)\n3. Deviled Egg flight - give this a miss - each of the deviled eggs tasted like a regular deviled egg with topping on it which really wasn't worth $3 a half egg. If you really want delicious deviled eggs, District has fabulous siracha deviled eggs which are worth paying for.\n4. Wine - we picked out a bottle of syrah that was served chilled (!!) for some reason? We didn't absolutely love it, but it ended up growing on us later in the evening. I would definitely come back to do a chocolate and wine flight tasting the next time :)\n\nAll in all, I had such an amazing time at Eno Bar and wouldn't hesitate to go back. The only downside that made me take off a star was the snobby service. When we got into Eno at around 6, it was still pretty quiet, we asked if we could sit in the back and the waitress very rudely waved us off and said no they were full. I went to the bathroom a few minutes later and saw lots of people in the back, seated cozily by the roaring fireplace :/ Strike one.

There is such a thing! \n\nEno is a glittery gem on this not-so-glamorous strip of Geary. The neighborhood is quasi-Union Square, quasi-Tenderloin, but you'll forget all those distinctions once you're lounging by their fire, popping truffles into your mouth, and washing them down with sparking Malbec. Indulgence is the rule here. \n\nThe wine list (no, book!) is impressive, with lots of flights and glasses to choose from. They seem to have a good balance of easy-drinking wines, and a few obscure ones. That way, they're not isolating any wine novices or disappointing any vino nerds. Like any pro wine bar, they'll bring you tastes to help you find the perfect glass before you commit. Huge rounds of cheese and pretty painted truffles fill the refrigerator, so you're likely to say \"yes\" to a pairing. \n\nEno is more of a slick wine lounge vs. a rustic wine bar, but not in that \"trying too hard to be cool\" way.  There are two rooms: one feels like more of a cafe, the other more loungey and intimate. I suppose it's nice to have options, but we felt like the cafe side was a little less luxurious. \n\nIt's a classy joint, but not too classy to deter you from coming just as you are.

As I sank into my seat my heartbeat settled down and I went into relaxation mode.\n \nPRICING: Very reasonable at $15 for the wine flight and $12 for the cheese flight. The three wines we had came with lots of information and it helped me mentally prepare my palate for each first sip. And you really can't go wrong with gourmet cheeses, plus the assortment was well rounded.\n\nSERVICE: This is where Eno won me over because the two handsome servers we had were excellent! You could tell they were true wine geeks and gave us so many great suggestions. We felt very well taken care of and we learned a ton about the wines we were drinking!\n\nIf you love wine then you'll feel right at home in Eno Wine Bar. Can't wait for my next jaunt to San Francisco and another nightcap or two or three at Eno!", "author": "Emi H."}

I had the chance to taste some similar wines that were different in their own special way.  I loved pairing it with their suggestions of cheese.

Unfortunately the people working that night were having a hard time, they were very frazzled.  For example, the three or four people working there were having a very hard time with the number of customers in attendance.  Yes it was a Saturday and yes it was busy, but these employees seemed to not know how to handle the stress of front of the house operations.  They actually turned away business more than once instead of telling people to wait 5 minutes for other guests to leave.  By the time we left after one flight (almost 10pm), the couch in front was open and so were a couple tables.  These could have been filled again if they hadn't turned away the business earlier.\n\nNever-the-less, the atmosphere is very comfortable, dark and relaxing.  The wine selection is rather vast and the flights are reasonably priced.

The soft one I didn't care for as it was hardening and a bit too firm for a soft cheese.

Yes, you may notice a few tourist feet walking their way inside, but the room is intimate enough that it shouldn't bother you :)\n\nThat said, a TON of great wines on the menu.  More interesting is to talk to the owner, Joel, about where he sources his wines.  I mean, variety is the spice of life, but it doesn't get more local than this.

I had hoped to find a happy hour with a friend or two, but everyone seemed tired so I went out on my own. I love wine and cheese (known for it actually) and wanted to discover a new place nearby. Eno was just a few blocks away & had great reviews so I went.\n\nI ordered a wine flight & a cheese plate. The wine came within a few minutes. The cheese plate took over 20 minutes (I had texted someone when I ordered so I knew how long). I had tried to not drink a full glass of wine because I was obviously waiting for some food to eat with it. I felt pretty sad & pathetic waiting by myself in this wine bar for some cheese that wasn't coming. My waiter was nice though and apologized a few times, and took the cheese plate that eventually came out off my bill.\n\nIf it wasn't for him, I would have given a horrible review & definitely would have never come back.

There is a whole back story behind each glass within the flights, and part of the fun is hearing the details of each drink. Some are much more full-body than others, some are more fruit-forward, but that's what wine tasting is all about: there usually is a progression from weakest to strongest in the series.\n\nI've been here twice so far, trying a different flight each time: \"The Hills Have Vines\" the first time, and \"Cotes to Coast\" the second. The Grenache in their Cotes to Coast flight hits the nail on the head beautifully.\n\nAnother nice element of this wine bar is the simple ambience of the atmosphere.

Eno is a delightful reminder of what I've been missing down in LA.\n\nLA is many things, but the unrepentant divas who staff their service establishments wouldn't know customer service if the Apple Store Goddess branded it on their foreheads with the iPad of Truth.\n\nThat being said, Eno has one of the best wine selections I've seen. Not in terms of sheer quantity, but in terms of innovation. It's refreshed often, and the selections all have a purpose and should open your wine palate to something you haven't considered.\n\nUsually most wine bars have a pretty generic selection, it's just a generic mess of NorCal tasting grapes and tannin after a while. But these selections should revitalize your tongue.\n\nTheir kitchen is also open until almost closing. Union Square unfortunately is pretty dire in the food situation, being the tourist trap that it is. You won't get a 24 oz ribeye here, but there's a selection of small plates that were very interesting.\n\nIn San Francisco, I expect proper service since that's where the bar is set. And Eno didn't disappoint. Friendly, professional, and attentive. We weren't left waiting to place orders for additional glasses, or to close out. Nor did I feel rushed despite it being a busy Saturday during which they could have surely turned over more tables.\n\nIf you're in Union Square, and you have wino blood, definitely check it out.", "author": "Rishi G."}

Make sure to try their flights: 3 generously poured half glasses of nicely matched wines. Just wonderful if you don't exactly know what you should get.\nAlso their food menu deserves to be mentioned: whether you like cheese, chocolate or hearty snacks, you can get it all. The menu could use a few more nuts though. But we tried their truffles and they were excellent. Looking forward to another night at this place!", "author": "Daniel W."}

Great vibes and place to unwind with some friends at the end of the week.\n\nI ordered one of the red wine flights mainly because the description said the wines included were illegal in 48 states, only to find out that it wasn't true. That little disappointment aside, the wine was decent. We ordered a cheddar cheese plate too which was ahhh-mazing. Complemented the wines so seamlessly.\n\nEno has a prime location too, right next to Union Square, which is perfect for relaxing after some shopping/dinner. It is pretty small (which is why their bathroom doors completely blend into the walls like camouflage!) but they've done a lot of smart interior designing to open up the space which I appreciate. If you're looking for a meal they also have some basic options like the sandwich my friend ordered and also sell wine by the glass or bottle if you'd like to have it with your meal so it's a place of many dining possibilities.", "author": "Junes S."}

My partner and I came in here after a busy day sightseeing and it was the perfect place to recharge and sip on some amazing wines.  I opted for the \"Grumpy Old Vines\" flight and he chose a lighter and fruitier flight.  However, I was immensely pleased with my selection.  The Rimbert 2010 \"Carignator\" from Languedoc, France is the most pleasant wine I've had for my taste, and its floral scents are tantalizing.  The service is also very warm and friendly, which was a nice break from the crazy rush everyone seems to be in around Union Square.

The ENO team is passionate and knowledgeable, truly going above and beyond to ensure you have an enjoyable experience. This very mantra was put to the test last night as we hosted a full buyout event for 200 people. The quality of the food and drink along with the stellar service did not waver despite the number of people being served. The staff was always friendly and professional and all of our guests were extremely pleased with the food and wine spread. \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend ENO for a casual glass of wine to unwind or as a venue for your next special bash.

I searched on yelp and Eno came to the rescue. It's apparently a new place and it's already charming many San Franciscan and tourists alike. \n\nFirst of all, the ambiance is really nice! I love the wood, the lighting, the big people watching windows and the fireplace. It's very classy and relaxing. Definitely not a \"scene\" bar, but a place where you can have a good conversation with a date or friends, or even enjoy yourself, like I was doing today with my work. Oh, and they have wifi, so I could comfortably sit down at a table next to a plug and get hours of work done. Nice touch!\n\nI was amazed by the good selection of world wine, as opposed to most wine bars in the region which focus more on the local Californian ones. I chose a nice red Italian. It was bold and spicy, just the way I like it, and I savored it throughout my whole time there. Oh and did I mention that the prices were very good? I took a look at the food menu - and the dishes people were ordering around me - and they all seemed really nice, albeit limited. They have a couple of salads, a couple of sandwiches, a charcuterie plate, different types of bruschettas, and cheese and chocolate flights. I had just had a big lunch and skipped it, but will definitely nibble on something next time I'm around.\n\nThe service was super nice and although very attentive, I never felt rushed. He even brought me a taste of another Italian red when he noticed my glass was almost empty.\n\nLooking forward to coming back for a flight and some of that cheese and chocolate! :-)", "author": "Simone W."}

The presentation was beautiful; the chocolates had the name of the country written on them and \"Eno\" was written in chocolate shavings on the plate. Each glass of wine in the flight came with a little card with information about the wine, which I thought was a great way to do it. I've been to another wine bar that had a binder full of lengthy descriptions about the wines and it was too bulky and awkward to flip through while you're enjoying your wine.

But it's not the same as California wine. They are both good in their own right, and living in the UK means we don't get good Californian wine. Or we have to pay ridiculously for it. So when we're in the states, we make an effort to try to drink a lot of wine.\n\nEno Wine Bar really helped with this. We came in after finishing our Christmas shopping on a Wednesday afternoon. And we stayed way too long. They offer a variety of interesting (and interestingly named) wine flights with a variety of wines to try on them. And wine flights aren't as common in the UK it seems, so it's nice to have a chance to try a lot of wines while we're around. We did gravitate toward the California selections, but they have a great selection of European wines as well.\n\nBut, not only do they do wine and have an interesting selection of it, they do cheese flights as well. Usually cheese plates are a selection of different cheeses. But at Eno they seem to do a selection of similar cheeses for you to try with a certain type of wine or wine flight. A cheese flight with a wine flight. it's a brilliant idea. They also serve a bit of other food, the duck bruschetta had us intrigued, but since we had a big breakfast and was meeting a friend for dinner we stuck to the cheese.\n\nThe service is great too. Of course, it was fairly empty when we were there, but the general manager was chatting with us about wine. Of course it helps that the other half throws his wine knowledge around, but it's seem to impress people on several occasions. Plus being able to talk about Chateau Musar was also a bonus.\n\nIt's also nice because it's right off Union Square but is fairly low on the pretension scale.

To my surprise, when I finally arrived half my team was already being helped to wine, beer and tasty treats! They welcomed us all with warm open arms, great wines and beers and like I said tasty treats. The fact that we gave them no notice, the atmosphere was awesome, they still took care of every other customer that walked in off the street while still making everyone feel like we were all the only ones in the place.\n\nThe service is top notch and they actually really care about every person that walks through the door.

The idea of one glass of wine turned into the Eno Experience and an additional glass of wine. The Eno Experience is 3 cheeses, 3 meats, 1 piece of chocolate and 1 glass of wine. Easily shareable between two people. The experience was fun, loved sitting by the window and people watching. What better place to do so then the center of San Francisco?!

No problem.\n\nThe wine flight preparation was excellent with the description cards facing you so you could read along as you drank.  While people may not care much about this, I found the placement and marketing of the wooden plank, and the white note cards to be PERFECTLY placed, plus if you liked a wine, you could perforate one of the cards and stick it in your wallet and it's now a wine reference card, and their business card.

The selection was really good too, however I would have liked to see more Central Coast representation.

Was surpised there was no bar to sit at once we walked in but loved window setting, the place is big with plenty of cool spots to people watch, along with couches and a fire place in the back which made it a very cool and inviting atmosphere. We had ordered the Go Green or Go Home Flight, all organic, all perfect. After tasting the flight I chose the first glass and my girlfriend preferred the second out of the three. We were in a hurry as we were on our way to a art show but glanced at the food which I believe was cool because they also offered flights of cheese, bruschetta , and meats, which we will definitely be back to try. Upon leaving we noticed chocolate and instantly assumed they were from Cocoa Bella, but our server explained that the chocolates were from other local venders, which seemed just as good. I will definitely be back in regards to the wine, food, hors d'oeuvres, ambiance, style, and of course the acknowledgeable customer service!", "author": "Manuel H."}

I was in San Francisco on vacation last week and we came across what seemed to be a great combination bar, cheese and chocolate paired with wine! Sounds great! I ordered the dessert wine flight paired with the nostalgia chocolate flight. The wine was absolutely terrible. I am a huge wine fan and I couldn't even bring myself to finish the small amount that my glasses had in them. The chocolates were mediocre at best. My boyfriend ordered a cheese and red wine flight. You would think that at a cheese bar they would be able to handle lots of cheese orders, however, we sat there staring at our wine for maybe a hour hour before his cheese finally came out. We saw several people come to the bar looking for their cheese and one table had to even cash out and leave before their cheese came. When ours finally arrived, they apologized for the delay and said there was a cheese rush. How could there possibly be a cheese \"rush\" at a cheese bar?? We left very disappointed.", "author": "Mandi R."}
