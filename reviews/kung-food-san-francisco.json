Be one happy Panda! \n\nWow! What a bargain at $8.50 + $1 fried rice upgrade for a tasty Chinese lunch with no MSG! \n\nI've been to Kung Food a few times since stumbling upon it in the Western Addition. Hey, its \"almost\" as good as Disco and that funky song! Such a cute name and a cute panda logo! Dare I say it just might be my go-to lunch spot in the city! I had the sweet & sour pork and loved it! Soup included. I had the lemon chicken and loved it too. I've had other lunch specials since then and all fresh, all good. \n\nKung Food is a casual caf\u00e9 style Chinese restaurant specializing in Cantonese food. Of all Chinese foods I'd say Cantonese is my favorite and probably due to my low tolerance of spicy. I'm just used to it! \n\nI guess if I rated Kung Food after my first, second, third visit I'd give them a perfect 5-Stars! Yet, on my last visit my experience was closer to meh, for starters the food didn't seem on point (different cook?), the chubby hostess seemed melancholy lol, and after my meal I didn't get my Fortune Cookie *sad panda* Hmm so 4-Stars, I guess! \n\nIn the end, I'd still recommend Kung Food to anyone in the Western Addition area. And of course, if you just can't get to Chinatown. Kung Food offers a nice affordable alternative if in Western Addition. Again, go with the lunch special! Just remind the waitress of your Fortune Cookie later... she just might be more into Billy Chin or worse... Chinese Morrissey!\n\n\"Everybody was kung-food fighting...\"", "author": "Eric R."}

When I'm looking for Chinese restaurants, all I really care about are two things: quality of food, speed, and price, and Kung Food hits all of those three.\n\nThe restaurant itself isn't too large, but when we came around 5pm on a Sunday, we ordered and got our food within 10 minutes.  As with most Chinese restaurants, the menu is pretty extensive, which means that there are some great items, but also some worth avoiding.  We ordered the chicken fried rice and the Hunan chicken.  The fried rice was great -- classic and nothing too fancy.  I wouldn't recommend the Hunan chicken; it came with a lot of sauce but nothing too distinguishing in flavor, and a random assortment of vegetables which wasn't too appealing to me.  Still, looking at some of the other dishes at nearby tables that looked delicious, I think we just made a bad call on ordering it.\n\nOverall, good Chinese restaurant and probably will become my go-to takeout place in the area.", "author": "Kelsey P."}

I certainly didn't think so. But that area has change positively every day. \n\nI also heard and read on our beloved website, that this restaurant has really good lunch specials. And you thought that I rely heavily on a burrito and an Oscar Mayer bologna sandwich (not all on one serving) for lunch!?! \n\nI was here last month and twice within a week, both times checking out the lunch specials.  The lunch specials range from $7.50-$9.95. My first visit, I was hungry and ordered the Mongolian lamb over rice. For $9.95, the spicy dish has lean and grilled lamb meat, spicy peppers, onions and extra heat. Every lunch specials comes with a complimentary egg roll. You can also choose white rice, brown or fried rice, both at extra cost.   I like any spicy Mongolian rice dishes, the restaurant's version is very good with the grilled lamb a difference maker. This dish is classified as spicy, but this dish is tolerable for wimps. \n\nI also ordered a side of chicken wings. The chicken wings were just okay with overly excessive amount of batter. Plus, it was an overkill with the hefty and large rice plate. They say, \"my eyes are bigger than my stomach\" It definitely shows. But I struggled and finished both dishes anyway. \n\nMy second visit came a few days later. I ordered Dragon beef over rice. For $8.95, the beef was slightly fried with a hint of Hunan-blended spices. The dish is very mild with a tangy taste of Hunan flavor. I also like this dish too. \n\nThe restaurant is really small and is located on the McAllister street side and not the busy Divisadero corridor side.

Change the U to a double O and a D to create the words Kung Food? Oh it's a done deal. The Shaolin monks, themselves, would approve of such mastery. \n\nFirst of all, Chinese takeout is usually pretty greasy, laden with MSG, and not of the greatest quality; however, it fills the belly and it's cheap. \n\nHere at Kung Food, you get the freshest ingredients AND affordability. \n\nI highly recommend their lunch specials. You get an entree with a side of steamed white rice or for an extra dollar you can opt for egg fried rice, veggie chow mein, or brown rice. Soup and an egg roll are also included for free. All of this for $8.50. \n\nEntrees that I've tried here thus far:\n\nMongolian Beef - tender slices of beef saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers and green onions along with whole red chili peppers. This dish is especially good because the sauce is not overpowering and the meat is cooked to perfection. The veggies are not served limp, and they remain crisp and light with every bite. \n\nCurry Chicken - I ordered this as spicy, and it came out surprisingly balanced. The cuts of chicken were moist and the curry flavor was prominent without being overwhelming. \n\nHoney Walnut Prawns - These babies are so juicy and plump, they pop in your mouth. The sauce is creamy, slightly sweet, and savory, yet not heavily doused in oil. The candied walnuts dusted with sesame seeds played a supportive role in rounding out this dish. \n\nOrange Chicken - Citrusy with a hint of tangy and a touch of sweetness, I was relieved to see that this common dish was not over-fried and dry.  \n\nKung Food promises outstanding Chinese cuisine, excellent service, and friendly staff; all of which I have personally experienced and can vouch for. \n\nWhen it comes to cheap, Chinese takeout, I thing Kung Food is definitely a game changer in the definition of how this food can be perceived. \n\n5 Stars!", "author": "Ann S."}

It says on the menu that it includes 2 of each of the items, shrimp dumplings, pork buns and siu mai. So we were expecting 2 shrimp dumplings, 2 pork buns, and 2 siu mai. Imagine our surprise when we found 4 shrimp dumplings, 2 siu mai, and no pork buns! Another big no-no!\n\nLet's not even take into consideration that if this is take-out food, you will probably want utensils. None was to be found!\n\nOK, now let's get into the food itself. The dimsum was just OK, our expectations completely ruined by the discrepancy in the actual items.\nThe walnut prawns was not bad. But remember what I said about the location? Take a walk down to Wonderland and you will find much better walnut prawns.\nThe Hunan tofu was decent, probably the best dish we got. The Yang Chow fried rice was so-so. Again, I've had better, probably Red Jade.\n\nOverall, I think if I rate the food itself, it's probably 3.5 stars. But the service was definitely subpar. Remember, this is San Francisco, competition is going to be stiff at best.\nWe will probably not get food from here again.", "author": "S K."}

Their lunch specials are great and come with a yummy homemade sweet and sour soup, egg roll, rice + main dish of your choice. This time around I tried the Dragon Beef w/ chow mein ($1 extra). What I love about this place are the little things:\n- It's really refreshing to have both the soup and egg roll served HOT, and not luke warm and have your main dish come out just as hot.\n- The cuts of meat they use - whether it's tender pieces of beef in the Dragon Beef or white meat chicken in the General Tsao.\n- Their service and passion for the food served. \n\nDragon Beef lunch special  was really good. Nice and crispy amongst all pieces. Sauce was well balanced between spicy, tangy and sweet. The dish came our nice and saucy so the chow mein could soak up all that goodness. I also love the use of mixed veg in the chow mein - not just bean sprouts or onions like most Chinese lunch spots. \n\nIf you're looking for a solid Chinese-American spot, look no further.

If you're looking for a great atmosphere and surprisingly great food for the pice, this is your joint. The menu is pretty diverse, with a great selection of soups, meat dishes and really good veggies. After trying a large portion of the menu, some of my favorites are the won-ton soup, basil chicken, bok choy beef and dragon chicken/beef. The won-ton combination soup is some of the best I've had. The broth is thick and the mix of the fresh vegetables marinating into it gives it a great flavor. I would recommend it with shrimp. The prawns here are thick and delicious. My second suggestion is to try the basil chicken. It's nicely seasoned, light and the vegetables are fantastic. Even as a meat lover I find myself cleaning the greens off the plate first here. Even for people that don't like a lot of heat, the spicy plates are not to be avoided. They have a great balance of spice and flavor that won't leave you sweating.\n\nThe customer service here is incredible and I always try to dine in. Andy is the man and will take complete care of you. He's always making sure that his patrons are satisfied and is as personable and friendly as they come. I've also never seen food fly out of the kitchen so fast. Oh, and you'll need a take home box. These portions are big.

I enjoyed eating here the first time I visited and would have said this is a 4- or 5-star establishment after that experience. And I would still consider eating here.\n\nBut their delivery service is *horrible.* I placed an order yesterday via eat24 and was told to expect the order within 90 minutes. At minute 95, I called to ask about the food status and the woman who answered the phone was unapologetic and curt, but told me it would be in the next order to go out. After another half hour -- by which point we're talking more than 2 hours after I placed the order -- I contacted eat24, and they reached out to the restaurant and were told the same thing, that it would be in the next order out. Another 15 minutes went by with no delivery. After about 2.5 hours, I was both late to an event and still had not received my order, so I canceled it. \n\nIf you cannot get a delivery order out the door in 2.5 hours, you're doing something very wrong.

It's not gourmet and doesn't do anything trendy or innovative (like Mission Chinese). BUT it's great for an everyday very affordable take out place. The portions are HUGE and cheap, the dishes with veggies have lots of veggies (i.e. Tofu with green beans), and everything tastes pretty well seasoned and good. There are no gloopy mystery sauces in anything. They don't put too much sugar or hoisin sauce in their sauces like some places. It feels good to me that their food doesn't taste like it will suddenly give me diabetes (although some on Yelp might complain about stuff being bland).

I ordered their beef chow fun and the noodles were very stuck together so that the sauce that should evenly spread only covered the outer parts of the noodles that were exposed. The clumps of noodles that were completely white from lack of sauce unfortunately made the dish bland and lack flavor. It would have been a great dish if it was cooked more thoroughly.\n\nSecond the salt and pepper pork chops- I usually love this dish although it's super greasy.. The cook did not know how to rid the smell of pork from the meat. Usually when you cook pork you hope that they were able to use garlic or ginseng or whatever other method to make sure it won't smell or taste the distinct smell that pork meat has -- or maybe the meat itself wasn't fresh.

Unfortunately, that was not the case.\n\nI ordered the orange chicken lunch special with a side of fried rice and an order of vegetable pot stickers. The pot stickers were deep-fried, which was unexpected but I was curious to try. They were rubbery and flavorless. The fried rice was so salty I could taste nothing else. The orange chicken was tough and dry. I could only stomach a few bites of both. Just because I was hungry doesn't mean I was going subject myself to that. I didn't try the soup that came with the meal out of fear of what it might taste like. The only decent thing was the free egg roll.", "author": "Angee R."}

It's a pretty typical American Chinese place and definitely does a good job of that. I recommend the walnut shrimp, crispy dragon skin (beef), and general tso's chicken. Their chow fun is also good though a little greasy, and their Singapore fried noodles are also good with lots of meat. Salted fish fried rice is good too.\n\nCustomer service is friendly and fast.

We were craving chinese so decided to stop by and when we walked up the scent of delicious Chinese food surrounded us. There was a small line since the restaurant in its self is small. I would definitely not recommend for more than 4 people. They have only a handful of tables and most of the time they had to put them together for larger parties which would cause a larger line. The food was good and flavorful. While you are waiting in line they let you order so that by the time you are seated your food is ready. Thankfully when we finally got seated after 30 minutes our food showed up within 5 minutes. You could see that a lot of locals love the place by the memorization of their names by the hostess. Many people ordered for delivery or take out which is probably what we should have done. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend to try out.", "author": "Melanie B."}

Do you have to choose any 2? \n\nAt 1 pm on a Saturday My Love and I walked in.  It was calm and quiet, unlike the construction up the street, which we hardly heard inside.  It was uncrowded, unlike the southern cafe down the street, where 14 people waited patiently behind crowd control cords.  Casually, we picked an empty table in one of the windows and accepted the staff's immediate attention.  \n\nThe room, which seats 20, was decorated in lacquered wood, prosperity cats, and lucky bamboo.  The menu was nicely bound in hardback.  It was time to try the food and see what was up.  \n\nMy Love chose the sweet & sour chicken, and I decided to try the cumin beef, because I hadn't heard of it.  Cumin is a primary ingredient in most curries, and I knew this would have a distinctive, wake-up twist.  As advertised, this was not your classical Chinatown fare.  The names were the same, but the grease was gone.  The cumin beef was billed as a hot dish, and I did find plenty of peppers in it.  I managed to keep the heat down to something my tongue could cope with by setting the peppers aside, but it was still tasty and it still gave my mouth a buzz.  \n\nIncluded with the main dish were sweet & sour soup, steamed rice, an egg roll, tea, and a fortune cookie.  Seriously.  A fortune cookie.  \n\nSomewhere in the middle of the lunch I decided to order a diet Coke, which helped me manage the heat of the main dish.  \n\nAll of it was great!  The attentive waitstaff was great!  Not hearing the construction outside was great!  Watching people on the sidewalk, as they peered through the window to see what this place was like, was great! \n\nI was thrilled with the food and service.  Anxiously I anticipated the check.  Would it be $60? $70?  But no, it was just $18 + tip!  For 2 giant delicious lunches!  That's great! \n\nSo the answer is you can have it all!

Not only is the owner an amateur Chinese rapper who serves amazing Chinese food, this restaurant plays some pretty neat contemporary hiphop Chinese music.  \n\nMy wife and I ordered the Black Pepper Steak. The steak was amazingly flavorful, cooked to a masterful perfection of medium rare tenderness. Chinese people can be very serious about the selection of prime cuts and how steak is done!! We also ordered this meatless dish (String Bean with Meatless Prawn) to see how this restaurant accommodated to the needs of vegetarians. Simply amazing; even an infamous carnivore such as myself finished all the string beans. The vegan prawn tasted like prawn despite being made from flour (no pun intended).  \n\nFinally the owner greeted our table in a very cordial manner and introduced himself.  He explained how it took him nearly three years to realize his dream of opening his very own restaurant, and that he has two passions in life--food and music. This restaurant is a paradigm example of one of those hole-in- the-wall restaurants dispersed throughout SF. This genre of owners have other passions in life besides unscrupulously operating their businesses to maximize profits and $$$$. I believe when one operates a business out of passion and in pursuit of other dreams in life, the products and services are always exceptionally remarkable. Kung Food is clearly different from large chain restaurants that only want your $$$$.\n\nOnce in a rare blue moon, I experienced the warmth of dining as a welcomed and cherished patron. People always talk about one of those renowned hole-in-the-wall Italian Restaurants in SF and its unusually hospitable owner. Well now we have a new Chinese version of such a restaurant.

My boyfriend had the Kung Pao Meatless Prawns, which was also very good. It came with lots of sauteed veggies (peppers and onions) in a light sauce. The meatless prawns looked like actual prawns, which always freaks me out since I've never eaten seafood, but they were really good nonetheless.

No meat, but add eggplant, bamboo shoot and basil to my veggie chow fun.... Amazing!  I loved all the veggies they put in!  Noodles were wide, flat, soft and fresh!  Yes, some noodles stuck together it I liked that there wasn't too much soy sauce on it so I can taste the veggies.  The only thing I wish was that it had the wok cooked flavor.  4.5 stars!\n\nBasil eggplant, chicken and prawn:  lots better than I thought!  Eggplant was cooked perfectly, chicken was soft juicy white meat slices and huge prawns!!  (Most Asian places charge $3 extra for any dish adding shrimp... And they add 2-3 small sized shrimp to the dish.). Looks oily, but it didn't taste it... Most of what looks like oil is the liquid from the eggplant. 5 stars!\n\nKorean style chicken wings:  this being take out I wanted to make sure my wings stayed crispy so I asked for it dry and the sauce on the side.  Chicken was perfect... Crispy outside, juicy tender meat inside.  Sauce was yummy but way too much!  (I hate wasting food and ended up dumping about 90% of it). Only complaint is I requested extra spicy and the sauce wasn't spicy at all.  Really wish they kept the garnish in the sauce so I still got that flavor..

The Sweet & Sour Chicken ROCKS, the Basil Tofu will go to any vegetarian's heart, and the Combination Plate is where it's at. Beware that portions are HUGE: I stuffed myself at dinner with my friend and evenly split the leftovers with my boyfriend the next day. It was awesome. \nThanks for being a great staple in the neighborhood! I'll definitely be going here any time I crave Chinese food.", "author": "Eileen T."}

The chicken chow mein and sesame chicken were well executed with good flavor.  Also was a very hearty serving!\n\nUnfortunately, the korean chicken wings are where expectations fell short.  I'm hoping it was just an off night, but the wings were sooooo salty!  I was hoping for a sweet/spicy combination but all I could taste was salt.

My first thought upon seeing the burgandy sign post of Kung Food was, \"F yes, no more Popeye Tuesdays!\" \n\nBefore I could even mention about the place to my coworkers, they were already talking about going there a second time, saying that the food was great and the price was absurdly affordable. Great and affordable, in this area? That hardly computes given the hefty sum I would have to pay from Bi-rite and Faletti's to satiate my appetite. Ever the skeptic, I went with two coworkers during lunch break to see it for myself.\n\nWhat I expected: A small business with take-out boxes lined up to the ceiling, with buffet-like counter reminiscent of Panda Express and people meandering through single-profile line with barely any place to sit down. Maybe some \"NO PANDA ALLOWED\" signs for kicks\n\nWhat I got: A snug little place by the bus stop with just enough seats for twenty people, a nicely lit table for four by the windows, and a menu with more dishes and choices than 90% of the Chinese restaurants I've been to. No pandas sighted, what a relief! The interior design was simple but didn't feel empty. The menu was INSANE, definitely affordable for the portions serviced. The service from owner and waiter, Andy, and his sister Jaime, were on point, efficient, and professional while their attitude and approach were cool and friendly.\n\nI could go on about the quality of the food and the service, but that would be a bit overwhelming, and one of the earlier reviewers have already done a very constructive critical analysis. So I'll just say, it was a lot better than what I expected. I have great hopes for the restaurant's growth potential in a place ruled by cheap fast food and expensive and decent-to-good edibles.\n\nCome and experience it for yourself. This is not Panda Express, but pretty close to real Chinese cuisine.", "author": "James L."}

The owner is young and stylish and wants patrons to enjoy a comfortable dining experience. \n\n\nThe food tasted great without excessive grease or any sign of MSG. Also, don't forget to try their friend banana dessert. \n\n\nI will definitely return to this restaurant again both for the food and dine-in experience.

First off, San Francisco sucks for food. I know everyone says this is a great place for new culinary experiences but no. You get jipped on everything. (Since when do I have to order rice separate of my chicken tikka masala?! Sacrilege) However, this place reminds me of what it was like ordering food in New York - you actually get a complete meal without going bankrupt. My personal favorites are the sesame and general tso's chicken. They always include a side of steamed white rice free of charge, whether it truly is included or I guess I'm nice enough to get some free rice? Regardless, they've always been lovely to me every time I order. And the food is really good. Every once in awhile I try to break free from my boring healthy habits (I blame you, Barry's Bootcamp) and give in to my cravings. This stuff definitely hits the spot. \nIf you dine in, it's quite cozy. As in, there's only a few tables.

Right downstairs from where I currently live too.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty small, so I would imagine it getting cramped if I visited at a busier time. I'm sure the workers can handle it, but it looked like they had their hands full with orders and attending to customers. They had old Teresa Teng songs playing in the background during my visit, so that was a nice touch.\n\nThe folks running the restaurant are very nice and kind. Based on how they treated the other customers waiting for takeout, they seem like the type that will go the distance to make their guests happy. I hope they can keep it up and prosper.\n\nThe prices aren't Oakland Chinatown prices, but the food is good and the portions are very hefty. I expected the restaurant and menu to be all hipstery because of the area, but it had a good balance of urban and traditional. The beef w/ scrambled egg felt like home. Not salty but not bland, just the way I like it. They gave me enough for 2 and a half meals. I'll be coming back to try more of my usual dishes but so far it seems like it is one of the better places in the city.

My mom rewrote Indian food. Kung Foid rewrites Chinese. Kung Food makes Chinese food with fresh veggies and from scratch. I loved the black mushroom veggie dish we got and the crab Rangoon is fresh and made from scratch. They are generous with their portions. This is why there's a delay on orders. They do need to run their businesses more systematically to handle volume so I hope they'll see that the feedback here at yelp will help them succeed. There's limited seating and they need to get rid of the carpet in the dining room but it's nicely decorated inside. This neighborhood needs restaurants like Kung Food.", "author": "Priya S."}

My favorite was the rock cod - the flavor was really delicate and the bean sauce wasn't overpowering. The string beans were great - not overlooked and still crunchy. The cumin lamb was flavorful, but could have used more cumin (just my personal preference for cumin). The chicken wings were hot and crispy, and a little sweet. And the crab rangoon was surprisingly good, with real crab bits. Note that the space is tiny - it probably seats about 25 people, so anticipate a wait for dinner time on a weekend.

He was quick to say yes to any requests we had, he was friendly and very personable. He cared about our experience at the restaurant which makes it even better. The food was also amazing! We had the pork fried rice (add pineapple in it) and it was so good. Not too salty and perfectly cooked. The dragon human beef was AMAZING! It had a little kick to it but if you don't like spice you can handle this (I promise). You can also add broccoli to it which made it more colorful and healthier. The hot spicy homemade pickled sauce is probably the best spicy topping I've ever had in my life. I can't wait to come back here next time I am in the area!

I opened the kung pao, and it looked healthy. The chicken was cut into flattened non-bite-sized pieces and there were hardly any peanuts, there was, however an astounding amount of (red) onions and (green) peppers. I literally think there was an entire red onion in this item, and btw, kung pao doesn't typically even have red onion...I picked out all of the onion (after a first serving not doing so and getting onion in every damn bite), and the green peppers which i don't like to begin with but wanted to see how the kung pao would come without any special ordering. By the time I'd picked out all the remaining onions and the green peppers, it filled HALF of the container it came in. Therefore, i paid almost 10bucks for onions and peppers. Also, the spicy could have been kicked up a notch. I dared not order extra spicy having never ordered from them before, but I'd advise the \"extra spicy\"if you are going to order from here and want some spice :)\n\nThe mu shu was okay, but showed up cold despite the quick delivery. \n\nI wish I could recommend kung food, but i can't\n\nGuess I'm still on the hunt for good chinese food delivery.

I'm guessing that's the result of one of two things (or both): 1) people seem to be so excited there's finally a Chinese food spot in NOPA they overlooked the process of actually critically considering the quality for the food and went straight to the review OR 2) the people reviewing this place simply have not had top quality Chinese food before.\n\nI agree, the owner is a super cool, friendly guy, but unfortunately that doesn't automatically make the food top quality. Its pretty bland, watery is some cases and just not very tasty unfortunately. I've tried this spot a few different times hoping it would be better but it just hasn't happened, yet. It's certainly NOT BAD Chinese food, its just not very good either.\n\nThe Kung Pao chicken, a pretty good benchmark dish, was a perfect example- the large chunks of chicken, veggies etc need to be chopped up into smaller pieces and more importantly the dish needs more taste, better sauce, be less watery etc. Very bland dish. The Orange Chicken was also not very good. Way too bready, weak sauce, not crispy and just poor quality.  \n\nI'm rooting for these guys b/c I live around the corner and I like the owner (and the name of the place) but this is just completely average/below average Chinese food at the moment.", "author": "Dusty M."}

As a vegetarian, I can only speak to the veggie dishes, but they're always quite yummy. I often order a dish to go and then make my own rice. One dish can last a few meals!", "author": "Jessica M."}

As a broke student who never has time to cook, this place is amazing! \nThe lunch specials are the best (served 11-3 i think)\nyou can get a great meal for 7.25 and there is a HUGE selection for their lunch special! I think there is at least 20+ dishes to choose from. Im going to get a different one each day for lunch\nThe owner is super smiley and nice! \nMy new fave Chinese Restaurant. \nDefinitely give it a try. I got two dishes from there and the food was flavorful and fresh!", "author": "Yasaman M."}

The owner Andy delivered my food, and he was so incredibly nice. I had the mapo tofu, black mushrooms with baby bok choy, and beef chow fun. All were good. They promised delivery in 45 minutes and came in 30 (I am not far, but not super close - if I were, I'd have picked it up myself.) I'll order from them again. It's high time we had a decent Chinese option in the neighborhood!", "author": "CC L."}

The owner apologized and I think even offered to re-make the dish, but the dish they prepared for me instead (chow mein noodles) looked great so I ate it.  As a way of rectifying the situation, they even offered me free green onion pancakes.  The food overall was really great, and I'd come back here again.  You can't beat the prices, and they have lots of vegetarian stuff on the menu too.  Seems like a very well-run, small neighborhood restaurant that cares about their customers.  For what it's worth, the chow mein noodles were some of the tastiest noodles I've had!", "author": "Zach S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-14", "description": "I don't see a \"vegetarian's go nuts for this place\" sign here but I think there should be. My bf and I used to come here all the time when he lived around the corner, and I was so happy to finally find a Chinese place that had the fake sesame chicken that I love! We usually would go for the lunch specials as you can get a ton of food (enough for leftovers for dinner) for pretty cheap by SF standards. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that sometimes when I went there (and this is a very few compared to the times I loved the place) the food could be disappointing and not as good as I remembered, but the next time I'd go back it was back to being good. So it can sometimes be inconsistent with that, and sometimes the waitress could come off a little withdrawn and rude. Overall, though, these never detracted from my experience, and these weren't the norm so I'd definitely recommend this place!", "author": "Zoe H."}

Wanted to have a local go to restaurant, but will need to leave the hood for take out. Sesame chicken was so dry and tough couldn't eat it. Pot stickers tasted doughy. The Mongolian beef was at least edible. Calamari was really bland and the fried rice had no taste. Not up to SF standards.", "author": "mike w."}

So i decided to get take out for lunch instead of fighting off flies the whole time. I ordered prawns and lobster sauce with chow mein...  I got prawns and snow peas with white rice... I hate peas and white rice. Getting one thing wrong was an honest mistake, getting both parts in the order wrong seems intentional. So basically I'll be avoiding this place for now on.", "author": "Tom L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-20", "description": "This place is by far the cleanest Chinese Restaurant I've been to. According to the owner Andy Yang, that his sister Jamie did the interior design all on her own. Never been to a Chinese restaurant that has the ambiance and atmosphere is similar to an Italian Restaurant. Their General Tsao chicken and Hunan Dragon Beef are real tasty, but the dim sum was just average. To my astonishment that the owner Andy Yang is one of the well known Hip Hop artist in the Chinese community. I have been to many of his performances and concerts. It made me feel so special to be served by this genuine and humble Hip Hop Artist. My bestie Grace was in love with the Garlic Lamb and Dry saut\u00e9d string Beans, and she was impressed by how profoundly the Chef works with his spices. We ended up taking 5 huge boxes home with honorable Blue Bag. I really wish their place was a bit bigger, so we could stretch out! Good luck Kung Food", "author": "Yueqi Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-11-19", "description": "After seeing the great reviews, I decided to finally check this place out the other night. Wasn't really happy with the food. The service and friendliness was great. Everything else was great. Very clean, very tasteful interior. I really wanted to like this place. I wanted to try something really good and was fixated on the Chef's special page for a while. I asked the guy what he recommended. He asked what kind of meat I like. I said chicken or beef preferably. He proceeded to recommend the Chef's special, Butter Beef. I'm not sure why that would be recommended given how unsavory it actually turned out to be. The dish was pretty much just cubed beef with some garnishments that didn't add a whole lot to the dish and the sauce. The actual cut of beef wasn't even remotely good. It tasted to me like a cheap cut of cubed beef marinated with excessive amounts of tenderizer. Tenderizer does not improve the taste of the meat, just makes it soft and that is exactly how it tasted to me. Tasted like super soft low quality beef chunks. The Worcestershire sauce flavor must have only been in the marinade because I didn't pick up on that flavor at all. This dish needs a lot of work if it's going to be the chef special. I may have gotten a poor batch, but I was not impressed at all. Honestly if I wasn't starving at the time and wasn't dining in with a big beer from next door to force the food down with, I probably wouldn't have eaten it. Total came to $20 with steam rice and tip, so not bad if it tasted any good. Also they have beer on the menu but no liquor license so you'll have to go next door to grab your own beer and bring it in. They were very accommodating of bringing in your beer from next door and actually suggested I do that when I tried to order the beer. The other thing I wasn't impressed with was the waiter (probably owner as well), who was very nice, but he consistently tried to predict what I was going to say and say it for me instead of listening. I didn't like that at all. He asked me what I thought of the dish, I said that I liked the sauce but the cut of meat was a bit fatty for my taste and that I'll probably try something else next time. He then said that I probably need well done (it was cooked about medium, which is generally what I like). When I was going to say that wasn't the issue he interjected to say, \"you probably like crispy, crispy. Try Beijing beef next time\". I thought that was funny because of course no one is expecting tenderloin or top-sirloin at that price point ($13), but if it's the Chef's special, it should probably be a little higher quality so as to be tolerable. Very fatty and unflaverful cut of beef with excessive tenderizer is the only way I can describe it. Anyways, I don't recommend the butter beef chef special. Maybe the other food is much better. I'll likely stick to going to Wonderland for cheap chinese, or Wonderful in Millbrae if I crave the spicy authentic good stuff. My suggestion for the owner if he/she wants to maintain the good ratings established to date; focus on quality and consistency. Don't try to overly impress or try to trick people into a higher opinion of your place. Be open, be truthful. People come for the food, make sure that is consistent and good. Make the adjustments. Don't get greedy Use quality ingredients even if you don't think patrons will notice. Charge a little more for certain dishes if you have to or reduce the portion size. Integrity always pays off in the end.", "author": "Jeff W."}
