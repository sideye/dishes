And between me and my family, we've probably paid for several dozen burritos' worth of money in additional guacamole charges, only to end up with no guacamole in the burritos. Not exactly sure what's up with them and their cooks, but this has happened for a long time now. Even when you explicitly tell the person on the phone to make sure they get guacamole in your burrito.

Their site says they charge an extra $1.50 to get your burrito smothered, but Forkable didn't note that extra charge. I guess that's better as they smothered my burrito with green chile instead of the red sauce. Was a little bummed because of that.

Let's be clear:  I'm not suggesting that The Little Chihuahua has authentic Mexican cuisine nor am I asserting that their offerings are \"the best of\" across the board.  I wouldn't know, having had only one item.\n\nBut when you leave a place imagining how soon you can come back for the same thing you just ate that counts for something.  As you drive home across the bridge thinking how you can't wait to come back here with your friend, that counts for something else.  \n\nWhen I ordered The Little Chihuahua's Tostada Salad ($10.95; with carne asada $1.50 extra) the friendly guy at the counter asked \"have you had our salads before?\"  then told me that I was \"in for a treat; they're really good\".  \n\nThat man speaks the truth.  \n\nI ate at the Noe Valley outpost of TLC 5 years ago and - because I assume my yelp review was accurate - ordered the exact same thing as I did on my visit to this location.  Even though I thought this menu offering was quite good in 2011  it's clear that some things do improve with age.  TLC has had 5 years to achieve perfection and, with their Tostada Salad, they've done so.   \n\nThe Divisadero location isn't much to look at so it came as a complete surprise to find something so satisfying inside.  Looks don't count for everything though and when you see, then taste, this salad all other views will dim in comparison.  \n\nLooking for a best in class salad?  The search is over.", "author": "Tracey A."}

After picking my copy of Rupi Kaur's Milk & Honey from The Booksmith, we were hungry and looking for a Mexican restaurant in the area that would satisfy our cravings. I had The Little Chihuahua bookmarked and had heard great things about it. I had heard that it was not only a little hipster but also healthy, organic, with a focus on offering sustainable and wholesome Mexican food without sacrificing taste. That was something I could get behind!\n\nWalking in, the ambiance and concept of the restaurant was lovely! I loved the dimly lit lights and the whole atmosphere of the place. The place can get crowded on weekends and nights, but make sure to order before you take a seat! We ordered the al pastor and garlic shrimp burritos and a large serving ($1) for chips. \n\nI loved the salsa here. If anything, come here for chips and salsa!! The salsa flavors are incredibly dimensional and delicious. There's even labels and spicy levels. I really enjoyed the roasted one and the green one. You can really taste the difference in these tortilla chips. They taste healthier, cleaner and less oily, which I loved!!\n\nAl pastor burrito: I enjoyed this one more than I expected. The flavor was alright but it wasn't ohmygod amazing like so many other places Mexican places I've been to. The meat was probably the standout part of this dish but it still wasn't spectacular. The flavor didn't strike me as unique or flavorful. To me, it was actually kind of bland. The overall taste of this burrito was just average, nothing that I would ever crave or return for.\n\nGarlic shrimp burrito: Okay, I really really wanted to like this one. I love garlic and I love seafood so this was right up my alley. The garlic flavor hits you immediately but that's really all I tasted from it. The burrito overall was quite bland and I felt like I was just chewing a mush of ingredients without any prominent or spectacular taste coming from it. My tastebuds were not impressed. \n\nEspecially at the price point of $25 for about two burritos, I expected a lot more from this place. As much as I tried to, I couldn't bring myself to really fall in love with either of burritos we got.", "author": "Nancy T."}

It's a small, self-seating restaurant where you order up at a counter and they bring your food out to you. The salsa bar is wonderful - our favorite was the roasted tomato salsa. The pico de gallo wasn't bad either. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and they were pretty good - a tad bit sweet, but overall, good. I ordered the guacamole enchiladas - three enchiladas with a side of beans and rice. The enchiladas ended up coming out without the guacamole inside (as did one other persons in our party). Once we brought it to their attention, though, they were very quick in calling a manager out and remedying the situation. It wasn't a big deal so we told them not to remake the enchiladas. They brought out bowls of guac instead - just as good :) Their guac was delicious, their enchiladas, were delicious, and the rice and beans were flavorful! Overall, I really enjoyed this place and highly recommend it for a quick mexican meal!", "author": "Ritu D."}

I decided to get a burrito to share with my BF since we had both been snacking quite a lot and were already pretty full. I got a shrimp burrito +guacamole to go for $13.50 and went back to our friends place feeling pretty good about our purchase.\n\nOnce we got back and pulled it out, we realized it was less of the giant burrito explosion we had expected and looked a little more like the frozen burritos you find in convenience stores. Undeterred we excitedly cut our burrito in half ready to eat. The first thing I noticed was there was a lot of shrimp which was good, but the shrimp was also completely unspiced. It tasted like someone threw it on a wok for a few minutes and added salt. There was also a glaring LACK of guacamole in the burrito. The rice and beans were at least the right texture, but it was pretty flavorless. In the end, most of the taste came from the shit ton of salsa that we had to pile onto our burritos. \n\nI'd give this place a 2.5 stars but the fact that they didn't give me my guacamole is effed up and pushes them down to a 2. I'd probably never come back here again because you can get waaayy better Mexican food for way cheaper pretty much anywhere else.", "author": "Melissa Z."}

It's about 1.5 blocks from the Divisadero Touchless Car Wash.  The line was a bit long and the tummy was grumbling loudly.  Just one search on my Yelp app and, voila!\nThere are tables for self seat dining  but many just hung outside on the steps to enjoy the summer weather.  The dining room was about half full as the cashier called out names for order pickups.  After a quick study of the menu, I ordered a Super chile verde chicken burrito with pinto beans, hold the sour cream (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=wCxMiOHLg6UAzmhLreEXrw) with a side of chips for an extra $0.50.  Needing to rush back to the office after this, dining here was not an option.  While waiting at a nearby table, I noticed their salsa bar which had six or eight flavors to choose from.  I chose the pico de gallo and the ranchera sauce (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=nzXz2mO9kPvvDpdlMIgOrg) which were perfect contrasting flavors for my need.  I'd have tried every flavor if time wasn't a factor.  After about eight minutes, I walked towards to counter to inform him that I would be back after picking up my car, but, guess what, he handed me my order instead.  The food ranks a three plus as I am spoiled with La Corneta being my go-to spot close to home.  The big pluses are for the sauce choices and the speediness in filling my order (+0.5 star).  Didn't know that this is one of many editions of restaurants and the prices are a bit higher than I'm used to ($11.00 and change before tip).  Sold 3.5 stars, rounding up to four.\nIf I'm hungry again while waiting for my car to be washed, this is probably where you'll find me.", "author": "Mike C."}

Not totally alot of room for the seven of us on a Friday evening.  \n\nYou just order at the counter, and then they will serve you the food, otherwise you bus yourself when you are done. \n\nI went with my sister's family for dinner. We ordered alot of different items.  I started out with the TORTILLA SOUP.  It was piping hot, with spicy chicken broth (but not alot!) served w dice chicken, avocado, queso fresco, fire roasted corn & tomato. Garnished with Pico de gallo, tortilla chips, and guajillo chili's. This soup was AMAZING!  I have to say at least half of us ordered the soup.  Next I ordered the GRILLED SHRIMP TACO, with cabbage salad, sliced avocado, garlic & tomatillo salsa chopped cilantro and onions.  That was OK. However it was lacking in flavor. \nWith our meal I had a Watermelon Agua Fresca to drink. It was quite refreshing. \nFor my main I ordered THE SIGNATURE LITTLE CHIHUAHUA TOSTADA SALAD, diced chicken, organic mixed greens, avocado (a quarter) , Pico de gallo, quesco fresco, black beans, cucumbers, mango salsa, & roasted bell peppers with a lime-cilantro dressing served on top of crispy tortilla shell.  While it was good, and huge, I think the flavors were a bit off. I'm not sure if it was the mango salsa or what.  I didn't think I would be able to finish it, but I did manage to eat a good chunk of the salad (minus the crispy tortilla shell bowl). \nTLC also has a salsa bar with about 6-8 different salsa's. I think my preferred salsa was the Chipotle salsa. I liked the smokiness. Their chips are average, served warm.  Our whole table ordered some Guacamole & Chips, a little watered down for the Guac, not what we're use to. My sister & family ordered burritos, tacos, enchiladas, along with the Mexican rice & beans. They thought it was pretty good, however, laking again, that punch of flavor. Like I said, not very authentic mexican, but not a horrible dinner either. \n\nTLC is super casual.

This city has a rich Mexican heritage, and the food testifies to it. But no taqueria has failed to meet my expectations as much as this place. To be clear: this is the worst Mexican restaurant I've eaten at in San Francisco.\n\nLet's start with my drink: a margarita. All wrong. These are the classic elements of this beautiful drink: tequila, triple sec, and lemon/lime juice. When mixed together in the right proportions, they are fantastic. My margarita tasted mostly like lemon juice and sweetener (maybe agave syrup). If that sounds like lemonade to you, it's because it tasted like lemonade to me. Served in a tall 16oz glass filled to the rim, I couldn't detect the tequila because the cocktail had been so diluted. This is amateur hour. Not to mention that it took a good 10 minutes for my boyfriend and I to even get our drinks in the first place--after we were served our food.\n\nOh yeah, the food. My Al pastor burrito was a mess. While the pork was marinated, it had such a weak texture that it might have been microwaved. Served with a heavy dose of refried black beans and rice, there was nothing stand-out about a burrito that cost $12.\n\nI'm lucky that I didn't order the quesadilla. My boyfriend had a chicken quesadilla filled with sauteed onion slices. The chicken was bland.\n\nThe restaurant tries way too hard to present an upscale ambiance. It's just pretentious. It's like the owners walked into Troipsue\u00f1o and decided to copy everything except the delicious menu. This overpriced establishment can't compare with Nopalito, which is less than a few blocks away, or El Rancho Grande, which is worth the walk from here.", "author": "Robert F."}

TLC uses higher quality meats and compostable takeaway containers. More recently, they began charging for chips because they're made from organic corn and were probably tired of people just throwing them away casually, wasting precious food. \n\nWhile I get that people are pissed 'cause this place doesn't have the same price points as a lot of taquerias, TLC's business practices are more environmentally conscious, while the classic Taqueria model is more conscious about cultural preservation. Not knocking either, I'm from San Diego and love classic Taqueria food. But it's reassuring to know that the meat you're eating is from animals who were grass-fed and pastured and that the containers will be easily broken down in the composting process.\n\nIf you want to spend less $$, you're still going to get tasty food, but it will be with lower quality (i.e. factory-farmed) meat, accompanied by a bunch of plastic that's just going to get thrown away. Again, not knocking either option, and many people do not have financial access to places like TLC, but if you have the money to spend on quality, at least once in a while, then why not?\n\nI've frequented the Divisadero location far more times than this location, but have gone twice in the last two weeks because TLC on Valencia is closer to my work.\n\nMy favorite thing to get has always been a regular salmon burrito with black beans. Eat that thing with tons of the roasted tomato salsa, because it's the best I've had in the city. The past couple of times I've come to this location I've gotten the Ensenada fish tacos and they are so good and crispy fresh!

Their eye for quality ingredients touches every piece of their food and I love how they prioritize local sources.  Particular favorites for me are the chorizo nachos (DANGEROUSLY good), carne asada enchiladas, and any kind of burrito.  Their chipotle salsa is also excellent - we regularly take a little bit extra. :-)\n\nThis place is small, so expect to be seated very close to other diners, but the atmosphere is very relaxed and everyone is eating delicious food, so the close quarters doesn't seem to bother anybody.  Everything is wooden, which adds a nice rich note to the atmosphere.  Service is friendly, if slightly brusque - this place is busy even at random times in the early afternoon, so the cashier (who doubles as a waiter) has time to listen carefully to your order (including dietary restrictions) but not enough time to chat.\n\nOne more great thing about Little Chihuahua?  They're *great* at gluten-free, even for celiacs!  They have a small kitchen, but they are very careful and knowledgeable about cross-contamination if you let them know that you have a medical reason to avoid gluten.  Almost everything is gluten-free to begin with - the only danger zone is the flour tortillas for the burritos, but they will happily make things on separate pans for you to be extra-safe.  Also, gluten-free tortillas that don't instantly fall apart!\n\nIt's a staple for us Lower Haighters!  Thanks Lil Chu!", "author": "Erin S."}

I'm a \"purist\" when it comes to my quesadillas, preferring just the carne and cheese for the most part with that perfect buttery tortilla. Don't get me wrong, I love pico, guacamole, etc. but I like for those to be outside the quesadilla for dipping/adding because otherwise it makes the quesadilla too soggy. And a big part (for me) about the perfect quesadilla is how each quarter of the quesadilla has ample or roughly equal amounts of meat and cheese. You know what I'm talking about...there's some places that put their meat and cheese mostly in the middle of the quesadilla and then when you cut it into four pieces, you're left with the two outside pieces being practically nothing but tortilla and maybe a sliver of cheese? A good quesadilla for me has four pieces that are hearty, yummy, and gooey. The downside with Little Chihuahua? My quesadilla came with 2.5 good pieces, with 1 piece basically almost completely tortilla. Not impressed. \n\nThe other negatives:\n-At $10.45 it's one of the more expensive carne asada quesadillas, especially compared to the ones on the Divisadero corridor\n-50 cent charge for small bag of tortilla chips, $1.00 for a large; it's not expensive, but it's not free like the others on Divisadero are (El Rancho Grande, El Burrito Express)\n-The chips themselves were not great \n\nThe good:\n-Salsa bar with 5 different salsas, including tomatillo, habanero, chipotle, and pico de gallo\n\nVerdict?

Also my first time using the Yelp app to find what's nearby :D.\n\nI had time to kill and do not come to this area very often as I do not want to bother looking for parking. But since I was parked at the DMV nearby I decided to walk here and try it out. I was having trouble finding this place because I was looking for a red rectangular store sign based on this photo (just noticed now that this photo was uploaded in 2009 -___- totally forgot to check): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-little-chihuahua-san-francisco?select=EGRMmpSgG64-EmycJ_CirA#CjWaCEH9G73j0mRHt5WYrQ\n\nI was just right across the street from it but did not notice it because they change the rectangle to a circle (no recent photos I guess :p). The entrance was quite small but the place was packed with people on a Thursday afternoon, nice ambience. Ordered a garlic shrimp burrito, as I saw recommended on the Yelp app. First thoughts, this is some quality aluminum foil lol. The burrito was alright, they didn't skimp out on the shrimp and it had quite a good kick on the spice. Also kind of dry so be sure to have something to drink. After finishing the burrito realized I totally forgot to get some salsa for the chips. sadface.jpg", "author": "Hui L."}

It also came with mushrooms [NOT LISTED] which he hates. The guac, pico, and sour cream [NO CABBAGE SALAD IN THERE] was piled in a corner of the container and made the quesadilla mushy.

My friend's burrito seemed like the perfect size, so the regular burrito must be massive! My salad was huge! A giant bowl filled with lettuce, diced chicken, a quarter of an avocado, and black beans at the bottom -- it was one tasty dinner! The lettuce was lightly dressed, just the way I like it and the chicken was flavorful. I didn't think I would but I pretty much finished a good chunk of the salad (minus the crispy tortilla shell bowl). My friend devoured his burrito and had some of my salad.\n\nThe chips were just okay, but the salsa was REALLY good. I like spicy and they had some really spicy salsa! \n\nWhen we finished up, we bussed our own table and were out the door! I thought the prices were average, so I don't really see the savings of having customers buss their own tables, but I'm not too bothered by it.

Not doughy suburban white people a la Chevy's, but pasty white people a la The New Mission. I had been in the mood for Mexican food, but I didn't realize that this spot was 'Mexican-inspired.' Not knowing anything about the ownership or style of this place, as I was eating my food I thought 'this spot has got to be the brainchild of an Anglo hipster.' And I wasn't wrong - as I later found out from an episode of 'Check Please! Bay Area,' on which the Noe Valley branch of this restaurant was reviewed. \n\nThe shrimp enchiladas were fine (not phenomenal), ingredients fresh and quality, and the salsa bar and chips were pretty OK. However, the test of a Mexican place for me is tortilla soup and I was SO not impressed with their version - almost a clear broth (tortilla soup should be reddish and in many cases is thick), fatty chicken thigh (granted, I'm a chicken breast snob), and not much 'tortilla soup' in this tortilla soup. Granted, I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob, having been raised on it and my adopted mom being from Guadalajara and throwing down real Mexican food, so there is that, but I have just so little patience for 'nouvelle (insert ethnicity here)' cuisine of any time - I raked some taco place in Silverlake over the coals for that shit, too. It was just all very guero to me and i pushed it aside after a few bites. Le sigh. \n\nThe place was filled with ironic facial hair, glossy young tech recruiter types, and a preponderance of smartphones - a chilly, disconnected vibe. I disliked the 'bus your own table' bullshit, not because i mind doing it, but because your average restaurant patron does a piss poor job of it. \n\nIf you're looking for fresh, clean, 'Mexican INSPIRED' food, by all means, have at it.

The restaurant is definitely a nicer, more \"upscale\" mexican restaurant, especially compared to those hole-in-the-wall taquerias in the Mission. \n\nYou order at the cashier first and then are given a basket of chips to go find a seat and sit down while your order is being prepared. I loved the habanero(? it's the spiciest one) salsa and the pico de gallo, but the chipotle (or whichever the medium salsa is) seemed suspiciously thick, almost paste-like, for it to be called a salsa. Nonetheless, the salsas I tried were good, for the most part. \n\nI ordered the Garlic Shrimp burrito, and I have to say it was decent, but not amazing especially for the higher price tag compared to taquerias. It was pretty flavorful and had a clean taste, and the garlic taste did shine through, but I felt that the burrito was mostly rice and very little of every other ingredients that went in. For the $12 pricetag on the burrito, I would've appreciated a bit more generosity with the shrimp and maybe avocado, since I found myself taking multiple bites that seemed to just all be rice. (That, or either distribute the ingredients better because i had maybe 2  bites where it should just be all the shrimps that were in the burrito)\n\nMy friend ordered the breakfast burrito, and she also said it was okay, but not worth trekking out to this area of SF to spend $10-11 on. \n\nIt's not the most authentic mexican place I've been to and again, I think the price is a little discouraging seeing that you could probably get an authentic taqueria burrito in the Mission for half the cost with more well-distributed and plentiful ingredients. But, I think the flavors were mostly there, so I feel like I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I would stop by if I happened to be in the area and was craving mexican food.", "author": "Judy B."}

There's a few branches of TLC and we stopped at this one on our walk to Golden Gate Park. We've now encountered lots of places with this style of ordering - go up to the counter and place your order, then grab a seat. I was in the mood for tacos but didn't realise the only served soft shell ones, so that was a disappointment. I had shrimp (camarones) and chicken (chile verde chicken) which came to around $11 - reasonable value for lunch. I also like that they have complimentary tortilla chips and a counter of dips/sauces to help yourself to. \n\nThere's something about a soft taco shell that I don't really like -\u00a0I think it's just a bit too bland for me. So I mostly stuck with the filling and was impressed with the portion sizes. All in all though, they were just ok -\u00a0not packed with flavour, could have used more coriander and needed sauces added to it to pep it up.

What intrigued us was the interesting sounding \"plantain\" burrito. Another option aside from meats, beans and rice? I'll give that a shot!\n\nWe came in on Saturday, a bit after 1 pm and the place was packed, despite the later lunch hour. I wasn't even sure we'd get a seat, but we managed to get a separate table. There's several shared table options if you don't mind rubbing elbows with strangers or if you come in with a larger party. Our order consisted of a chicken burrito and the plantain burrito with a side of chips. \n\nThere are several different salsas of varying heats available for the free chips you get with your order. I actually found the pico de gallo hotter than one of the others, which seemed odd. One of them was an amazing garlic-flavoured salsa, and there was also a smoky chipotle sauce that I tried but couldn't handle the heat from. Combined with the fresh chips, it was definitely a good appetite whetter. \n\nOur burritos came out pretty quickly given how busy it was. The plantain one was actually pretty large, especially in comparison to the chicken burrito! I unwrapped and dug in with excitement. \n\nThere's not much I can say to it other than \"wow\"! There was a huge range of flavours and it's not a lie to say that there was a party going on in my mouth, and I couldn't quite figure out what the hell was going on. The not-overly sweet plantain mixed with tomatoes and beans and cheese and chiles and who knows what else. It was such a unique flavour experience, I was literally blown away.\n\nThe chicken burrito was also a hit. We finished off as much as we could, then cleared our table and headed out. \n\nWe didn't eat for quite awhile afterwards, finding that these burritos were extremely filling and long-lasting. I think we started craving dinner around 7:30 pm. \n\nWhen the plantain burrito made it onto one of the Bay's lists for burrito places, they weren't lying. This is worth going to and checking out if you're looking for a unique taste sensation. Happily two thumbs up!", "author": "Cassandra J."}

The place is very small, so don't be fooled by the fact that it says it is good for groups.   Because we showed up early for dinner, the man behind the cash register was kind enough to let us sit before ordering. Other customers sat in the middle of large tables, which made seating a bit of a hassle, but fortunately for some considerate souls we were able to connect 3 smaller tables together. So be prepared to forage for seats if you have a larger group.  \nOn to the food.  Being from So Cal I was skeptical that we would find anything better than the delicious caliber of Mexican food we are used to.  Sadly, my skepticism was confirmed.  We ordered a variety of burritos, a chicken tostada, and the tortilla soup.  It wasn't terrible, but was very mediocre. I am sure we will not return because this place is way overhyped in what apparently is an authentically Mexican food starved city if this is so highly yelped and loved.\nSo I guess the bottom line is this: if you're from a place that has many great Mexican eateries, you most likely will not be impressed.\nBTW one stall dinky unkempt restroom for those who like such details.", "author": "Deb L."}

To be fair, He is not as particular about his Mexican food, and I could tell he enjoyed it.

It's an intimate setting where couples flock to and I would recommend coming with a no more than three other people because most tables seat two and it's possible to combine a couple of them to seat four. Still, four might be pushing it. This place is great for take out because you order in line before you nab a table and they'll bring your food to you and you bus your own table afterward. So for these type of quick places, this is definitely a fancy one for its caliber. \n\nThere's a great salsa bar and I loved every one, though the chipotle salsa was probably my favorite. I liked the smokiness of it. I got a tostada salad because it was written on the board outside so I figure it had to be good. You get a choice of meat and I went for the carne asada of course. I don't think there was enough carne asada on it, but it was pretty good still. The salad part of it was composed of arugula and other mixed baby greens that seemed fresh. I also liked that there was about a quarter of an avocado on it. The tostada wasn't hard and very crunchy. They give you a large bowl of chips and they were still warm, so that was a nice touch. We think they keep them under a heat lamp or something.  The sangria was super delicious! It was just the right balance of fruit and wine. It was the best sangria I've had in a while. The horchata was not as great. It was nice, light and refreshing, but threading closely to weak.

The tacos I ordered were large versions of the normal tacos one expects when they go to a Taqueria; $5 for a taco would seem like too much until you see how massive these things are, and they don't skimp on the meat! The seating is interesting since it is mostly dining tables with a couple of two-seat tables on the side, so if you're by yourself and it's at a busy time you might have to occupy a single seat at the larger tables.

Although, the food was not by any means bad, I just felt that it could have had more flavor, particularly the chicken. It costs about $11 for the quesadilla, which I think is a little overpriced.

The Little Chihuahua also felt authentic.\n\nI ordered a regular toasted flour burrito with pinto beans and grilled vegetables. It was well wrapped, packed with flavor, and just generally sensational, especially with the accompanying yerba mate. It took about eight minutes for my order to be delivered, which seemed like just the right amount of time to efficiently prepare a burrito, and for me to settle in at my place.\n\nMovement here is kind of difficult. With tables framing the central walkway to the order counter, the restaurant feels really narrow: at first the organization doesn't make any sense.

A friend that lived nearby recommended this burrito spot after hearing some good reviews. We ordered up an assortment of burritos. I asked about Horchata, the unknown dairy-based beverage that I only hear about in songs. When the cinnamon-sugar concoction was exposed, I knew it had to be mine. Weeks later, we still go back every Sunday for a tall glass of horchata, with light ice, and pair it with one of the super burritos, stuffed to the max with your favorite ingredients.\n\nWhat stands out at the Little Chihuahua is the great music: every evening we hear our favorite tunes including the Strokes, the Killers, and many indie artists you only imagined were available on your secret Spotify playlists. Beyond this, the service is great. We've adopted the name \"Horchata crew\" and love connecting with these guys; from the friendly people up front to the kind guys that are serving it up on the grill.\n\nTheir salsa bar is one of the best in the city that I've tried; even better than what's down in the Mission. You have to try their Chipotle BBQ salsa, a bold flavor addition to any burrito or taco.

I walked down from a friend's apt I'm watching while on spring break after finding this restaurant on Yelp to fulfill my hankering for a taco. A great vibe awaits with several long tables that seat 8 on one side and a few 4-squares on the opposite. It's small, casual, and inviting. It was pretty full and I happened to catch the 'tween time when everyone else already had food and seemed to be near the end of their meal.  I ordered two tacos:  one wild mushroom and one carne asada. Yes, the organic menu grabbed me too. 15-minutes later a plate was practically tossed at my #44 as I patiently waited for food and wrote in my notebook. No pleasantry, just a \"Here.\" with a seeming harumph as the 20-something woman walked off.  What lay before me looked OK, but not even as yummy as most of the taco trucks around SF. Two open-faced, double tortilla tacos with some lettuce and lime slices on the side. (The usual fare for a street taco.) The meat was a little tough and the wild mushrooms didn't have much flair. Both were served with a heavy hand of tomatillo sauce, so I skipped the yum salsa bar that everyone has raved about. (Too bad that.)  These were not tacos that I would recommend nor return to.  If I'm out this way again, I'd rather head over to Nopalito (also in the neighborhood) with more quick and welcoming service and tastier food. However, if one of my pals insists, I would look over the more stellar reviews and say \"I'll have what she's having,\" while pointing to one of these 5-star notations. Oh, and the prices are quite decent at $4.50 and $5.45 per taco depending on the ingredients.", "author": "Dana J."}

The food was delicious, the service was friendly and fast, and the ambiance is like a cute little cafe you can hang out at and chill with some friends!! Five stars in all categories!!\n\nFood: \n1) Carne asada nachos: Best nachos EVER!! I loved the tender cubes of carne asada that they generously sprinkled throughout the dish! The cheese was so flavorful and the chips, guacamole and everything else was just the bee's knees! I couldn't get enough of this!! \n2) Garlic shrimp burrito: not that this was not good, but relative to everything else...this burrito totally got overshadowed! If it was the stand alone thing that I got, it would think it's SOO good but because I had all the other dishes to compare it to, it just didn't step up to the plate to be as good as the other dishes! Still a solid delicious choice to order though!\n3) Tortilla soup: SO FLAVORFUL and filled with soooo many ingredients!! There were cubes of chicken and cheese (that looked and tasted like tofu), and so many other things! I was totally digging this soup! \n4) Tostada salad: Served in a big taco bowl shell, it was the perfect mix of greens and salad dressing! I often don't like my salad drenched in too much dressing, but this place did it right. Salad at it's best (presentation and taste wise!). \n\nAmbiance: \nLike a cute little cafe that you can hang out and have a cup of coffee with a friend and just chat for hours...but it's a restaurant, not a cafe. Just gives you that feeling like you don't have to rush and you can just hang out and take your time. The decor is really bold and artistic! Very fresh vibe! \n\nService: \nYou just order at the counter and then they serve you the food but otherwise you bus yourself when you are done. \n\nPrice: \nFor food this good, it was totally worth it.

Chalk up another taqueria visit, because this is my first time to Little Chihuahua for a place I've heard that they make a Plantain Burrito. For a somewhat Burrito-enthusiast like myself and recent obsession with Plantain Bananas on almost anything, I was enticed to try the unique burrito. \n\nFor $7.95+ tax, I get the usual filling that I find in a standard burrito. But instead of the meat, I get the Archipelago sweetness in my \"silver-bullet\". I'm used to burritos with meat-overload, but the sweetness of the Plantain tasted awkward with the other key ingredients. Don't get me wrong, but I think the restaurant has created a great burrito for other people. But for a burrito-lover like myself, I might pass on this special burrito. \n\nJust like any little Chihuahua(dog), this is a very cute place with limited seatings, in which I'll be back and try other foods.

Juicy shrimps, organic mixed greens, black beans, avocado, tomatoes, cheese, cucumbers, mango salsa, bell peppers, lime, cilantro... am I missing anything? It was sooooooo good, just soooooo big. I tried my best but I probably only finished half of it in one sitting (though it didn't really look like I made a dent in the crispy tortilla shell bowl... which is also delicious btw).

And it's basically shared tables. I had chicken enchiladas. The cheese never melted inside, so it was chunks of warm chicken, with balls of cheese, wrapped in a cold tortilla, slopped over with a room-temperature red sauce that tasted like it was dumped out of a can of Ragu sauce. I don't get it. My partner had mushroom enchiladas, and was convinced that they were \"reconstituted\" mushrooms (I have no idea what that means - oh wait: he says - \"dehydrated and then reconstituted with water\"). Even if they were not reconstituted, they tasted like they were. Two people, two enchilada dinners, two non-alcoholic beverages: $26 (excluding tip). So far, this was our worst meal in San Francisco.", "author": "Morris R."}

I was impressed by Little Chihuahua when I moved down here last year. Too bad they weren't on that 100 best Burritos list a while back - they are way better than some of the places in the Mission that *did* make that list.... The salsa bar is nice too.  I do prefer takeout here though - when it gets busy, and you have to bus your own table, which is fine, and then sort out compost, etc. you might want to wash your hands afterwards, but the bathroom is way in the back where you order and very crowded...  Maybe the layout could be better but the food and atmosphere is great!\n\nUpdate 4/25/15:\n\nRecently tried the carne asada burrito, which is very tasty, but not that much carne is included. More recently I ordered this again, and added extra carne. I was told it would be a $3.75 upcharge, and agreed to it. My girlfriend ordered a plantain burrito with garlic shrimp added (also very tasty), with a $2.50 upcharge. I guess what we didn't realize was the initial price of these items as it was a phone order, which was $11.50 & $11.95, respectively. Didn't get the total over the phone, which ended up being $32.31, with the SF surcharge - and the guy at the counter didn't make the prices up - so a $3 tip, so basically, $35. For two burritos. I asked for one of the larger plastic containers for some salsa to go, and then the guy that just rung me up says, \"Well technically I'm supposed to charge you for tha....\" I took the cup and said thank you very much. \n\nNot really sure what to say about it.

More like a tequila sunrise. They use some sort of juice (orange?) and agave wine, I believe. But that being said, it is absolutely delicious and I'm a bit of a margarita snob.\n\nEverything comes with chips and the best part is that the CHIPS ARE GOOD! Usually places like this come with crap chips that taste like cardboard and are a waste of calories but not here. Crispy, crunchy, light, salty, and free. It's genius.\n\nThe salsa bar is awesome. Go for the Roasted Tomato salsa. It has a healthy kick but isn't too spicy (I LOVE the spiciest ones, but this one has the most robust flavor and it'll satisfy you even if you want something that burns your mouth off).\n\nMy friend raves about the tortilla soup and it looked really good. I got the tostada salad with wild mushrooms and it was DELICIOUS. Light, great flavor combos, good sized salad. It was really great.\n\nThe interior is great, only not-ideal part is that you might be sitting at a big table with tons of people right next to you, so not very good for private conversations.\n\nAlso, someone asked us to leave yesterday. I totally understand that they were really busy and people needed to sit down. But being at a sit down restaurant where I'd spent a good amount of money, it still feels weird being asked to leave.

This place rocks and they make the best plantain burrito, as others have pointed out.

I just want to say that the tomatillo (roasted green tomato) sauce rocks my world, it's simply awesome. Most places are content with an onion-y green liquid, but at LIttle Chihuahua you can see the slightly burnt pieces of tomato that make the whole salsa just work. It's sweeter than most, so change your expectations and stop eating that stuff from jars or canned Goya-like stuff; I, for one, haven't had this type of tomatillo salsa anywhere else! Their pico de gallo and other salsas are great too and made fresh all day!  \n\nAnyway, the place itself is realllllly itty bitty small, with community tables (so if you're not into sharing tables, you need to get out more often) and one TINY bathroom.

The green salsa was thick and good tasting, albeit not very spicy. The staff was friendly, I actually made the girl recommend me a meat choice and she didn't seem to mind.\n\nCons: The habanero salsa is way too sweet! I understand trying to counterbalance the spice but this isn't the way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-13", "description": "The menu at The Little Chihuahua is straight forward and simple, but not. Burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos and salads make for a seemingly basic offering of \"mexican\" fare. And while the ingredients for these include staple items found in almost all mexican dishes (tomatoes, avocado, cilantro, onion, etc.) the quality of these ingredients is what makes Little Chihuahua a pretty good deal in a great location. \n\nI got the tostada salad, with half a serving of grilled vegetables and half a serving of carne asada. That they were accommodating in my wanting both without having to pay an extra fee for each is noteworthy in the customer service category. The carne asada was tender and juicy, and the vegetables were well cooked and well-seasoned. I downed that salad!! Accompanied by a mix of their wonderful house salsas, the cilantro-lime dressing also gave it a good kick. Arrriba!\n\nThe chips here are decent, but a little too airy for my taste. And the sangria was a disappointment, to be honest- hardly fruitful and not even mildly strong.\n\nService is quick, though, even when busy- and that everything is made to order this is an impressive feat, because they sure do seem to get busy!\n\nOverall, I think there is a hype surrounding this place that isn't quite justified. It serves good quality, well constructed, basic mexican food at a good price, but it isn't blow your mind outstanding. I have not yet had a burrito here, so maybe that experience will sway my final verdict, but for now I'm sticking to my guns that says you won't be disappointed, but you also don't need to wait in line 20 minutes just to place an order.\n\nAlso, be mindful of the limited seating. You might get lucky (like us) and find a table for 4 clearing up right as you're ready to sit down, or you may find yourselves unfortunate as the group of 6 who ordered after us and were forced to either spread out or half sit and half stand.

I don't know what they serve here but as someone who grew up in a Mexican household I can tell you it is not Mexican. I decided to try Little Chihuahua because it's walking distance from my place and after walking by so many times I figured why not. I had a feeling it wouldn't please my taste buds but I didn't want to pass judgment without actually trying the food. I will say that they only thing they've got going for them is the guacamole. After eating it, I understand why they ran out and why people kept asking for it. Like most places on a Sunday, it was crowded so we took our food to go. I ordered the Chorizo quesadilla that was cut up into four pieces. The first three pieces had little to no cheese and just chorizo and onions, the fourth had all cheese and hardly any chorizo. The chorizo tasted fresh and had flavor which I appreciated but it didn't make up for the lack of cheese. My mom ordered the Fajita burrito (chicken). When she unwrapped, it was burnt and you could smell it. It should've been called the onion burrito because there was more onion than chicken. We also ordered Pozole rojo because we were curious as to what it would taste like (good Pozole is hard to come by in the city). For the price they really don't give you that much. I've paid the same amount at other restaurants and one owl can easily feed two people (with generous servings) and is full of flavor. I opened it and it smelled bland. I took one taste (I didn't want to review it without trying it) and it was even worse. I had to spit it out due to the lack of flavor.

And I must say, that in the 4 square blocks immediately surround my present location, posses more culinary delights than arguably the whole of San Diego. \n\nOne of the jewels is this cute little Mexican joint I hereby dub, \"a little slice of heaven.\" I started my culinary experience with the chicken tortilla soup. I don't typically like large chunks of dark meat nor cubes of cheese, but somehow the roasted chilies, the white maze, the chicken, avocado, assorted spices, and whole garlic made the dish devilishly delightful... guess no one will be kissin' their honey afterwards... unless your honey also have this soup, in which case, it's fair game.  I didn't think my meal could get any better, and seriously considered not eating my specialty garlic shrimp burrito in order to keep myself from the inevitable disappointment that always follows a dish of perfection. \n\nBut me, I can't resist food if it's in front of me... so I broke down and bit into my burrito... the taste explosion just blew my mind. WOW. The roasted tomato salsa, the spicy garlic shrimp, the beans, the avocado... holy guacamole... seriously died and gone to heaven. \n\nIf there were six stars to be given, I'm sure this place will be bestowed the honor.

Table space is much harder to come by. I have been faithful to this place for 2 years of frequent burrito runs and weekend brunches, and it has never let me down. \n\nOne day I'll get through the whole menu, but it's so tough with the opportunity cost of the utter craveworthiness of their burritos. The meat is high quality and always tasty. The burritos always have the perfect amount of moist sauciness. My favorites are the carnitas and the shrimp, but the carne asada and the chicken are delicious too. \n\nMy favorite is their tostada salad. The tostada is crispy and delicious, not stale tasting like at other places. The greens are fresh and it comes with mango and a huge hunk of avocado! There's the perfect amount of yummy cilantro dressing. Even though I love the meat, I like the salad with their tofu which is marinated in a delicious green sauce. \n\nI could write a whole paragraph about the salsa bar. Their roasted tomato salsa is the favorite (according to a poll of my friends), deliciously sweet with chips. Salsa verde is tasty and not bitter at all but probably my least favorite. The chipotle salsa is delicious with a little heat and a punch of smoky flavor perfect for dousing on my burrito. And the ultimate is the habanero salsa (which I mix with a little pico de gallo) which is sweet and flavorful and almost ridiculously spicy. \n\nMy most recent discovery was their arroz con leche. Seriously delicious rice pudding, even better than the loving cup (sorry!) with liquor-soaked raisins and delicious cinnamon cookies that are even better when they get soggy and flavor the pudding. \n\nThis is my absolute favorite place for cheap, delicious, relatively healthy food.

In a duel, plantain and black bean would win). But don't make the same mistake I did. Go for the tacos! Particularly the chile verde chicken. If you're feeling frisky, mix and match with a carne asada or maybe a grilled veggie (I know grilled veggie taco sounds weird but just go with it). Now if you're looking for typical mexican street tacos, you're going to get the opposite of that. One taco contains 2 corn tortillas topped with a mountain of whatever you choose. Two tacos is the perfect meal....unless you're a giant. You can eat them taco style (2 hands required) or with a fork (don't judge). And don't forget to hit the salsa bar.

While a carne asada super burrito here is a little pricier than your average Mission taqueria, it's made with quality ingredients and its size is pretty comparable to, say, El Farolito or Taqueria Can-Cun.  The nachos here are also large and there's no skimping on sour cream, guacamole, beans and meat.  However, be warned that \"smoky chile sauce\" is served on top of the nachos, which has kind of that weird chipotle flavor.  I don't like my nachos to taste like someone just poured liquid smoke in the beans, so I always ask for no sauce and am cheerfully obliged.\n\nBoth the agave wine margarita and sangria here are available by the glass or in carafes and are so ridiculously delicious that I'm considering stopping this review mid-sentence and going to get my drink on.  The agave wine margarita is particularly tasty.  Since it's made with agave wine rather than tequila and comes with orange slices mixed in, it takes on a more subtle, sweet flavor than a traditional margarita, which is a refreshing change.  At $18 a carafe, which works out to roughly four glasses, that's less than $5 a drink for you and your friends -- or, if you're like me, just little old you, relaxing at 3:45 p.m. on a weekday, savoring each sip of margarita and each bite of burrito.", "author": "Christy J."}

The salsa bar with pickled jalapenos, chipotle, habanero, roasted tomatilllo and roasted tomato salsas.   Sometimes I would get greedy with the salsas and take too much.  The carne asada and carnitas burritos.  The horchata.  The $2 pints of Anchor Steam (now #3...boo.)   I would bust a gut every time!\n\nThen I got bored.  I stopped and went back to Cancun.  Then I came back.  Then I went to Cancun.  I ran back and forth for awhile and one day I came back and it wasn't so good.  Then I left.  Then I ate Papalote.  Then I came back.  Then I had Green Chile Kitchen- I thought, YES! Hard shell tacos.  Then I had a couple bad meals there.  Then my roommate and I started coming to LC to eat together (he'd get enchiladas and I'd get chicken baby burrito.)  I loved it again.  Then the salsa bar got kinda so-so.  \n\nThen people started cramming in the place like nobody's business.  It got noisy and crowded.  So I would just call in and take my food away to eat at home, all spread out on the living room coffee table, watching old firefly and simpsons episodes on dvd.  then i would go and try something new and not like it.  (ie the salad, the fish tacos, some of the burritos are so-so)  Then I left again.  Then I came back and got re-addicted to the carnitas baby burrito (which is still amazing but you know it's the fast track to heart disease and obesity.)  My boyfriend got addicted to the rice pudding which is awesome...so awesome that we'd sometimes make a late night run for 3 or 4 servings of it to share with friends.  \n\nTHEN, I started eating the plantains and black burrito and I am totally and completely smitten.  It is heavy.  It's not for everyone as it is sweet and kinda on the mushier side with smoky sauce, rice, sour cream, cheese, onions and pico de gallo.  But oh, my, god.  It is amazing.  I will always come back to Lil Chihuahua for that burrito.  And their great chips and salsa.  Just like I will always go to Cancun for their vegetarian burritos and spicy green salsa or La Taqueria for their carnitas or carne asada or GCK for their hard shell tacos and ground beef (with green or red sauce) or Publico Urban Taqueria in the Trader Joe's plaza in SOMA for their chicken chile verde (that's right!)", "author": "erin k."}

I've been in the neighborhood a long time and have lived through all the other bad Mexican places that occupied this space. The worst was the one that was there back in 2000 called El Rico's or something like that. It was run by two middle eastern guys who used to make salsa with parsley instead of cilantro. I tried to talk to them about it a couple of times but they just shrugged me off. I even ran into one of the guys at K and J produce across the street one day and showed him a bunch of cilantro. I said, \"Here, use this CILANTRO in your salsa, not PARSLEY. I would know, I AM LATINA!\" \n\nAnd he just looked at me like I was a crazy person. Oh well, I tried. And then there was Loco Taco which was a huge step up but not great. Around that time a great little joint had opened up in Lower Haight called Las Mesas so I would just go there. Loco Taco was average, but not great and I definitely never craved it.\n\nAnd then the skies parted and god shone his heavenly light down to earth and blessed us with The Little Chihuahua. Contrary to it's silly name, they don't actually serve chihuahua meat there. Just Neiman Ranch Beef and Fulton Farms Chicken. \n\nEverything on their menu is scrumptious, fresh and amazingly delicious. They are not super traditional Mexican, but they are still more Mex than Cali-Mex or Tex-Mex. How do I know? I brought my Mexican-food-snob-sister here and she loved it too.\n\nWhen I'm in a veggie mood I order the plantain burrito (but in a bowl because flour tortillas are the devil when you're trying to keep your waist slim) but when I want meat I get the beef tacos. Nothing like that Bay Area hippie meat! Tastes great and is practically guilt-free!\n\nI like their salsas but I don't LOVE them... same with their chips.

You bite into it and it's just heaven without overly relying on cheese / guac / sour cream to get there. It is a normal size, so don't expect 3 pounds of rice and a tablecloth-sized and -tasting wrap. They are about quality over quantity.\n\nI love the veggie burrito. The chef sautes the fresh veggies while you wait.. even does the ignite-the-pan-oil flambe flip move to give them a nice char. You won't even miss the meat. Major props for doing that one right and not just as an afterthought.\n\nOther highlights include the super healthy, light and delicious tortilla soup. I enjoy the horchata, not the best on the planet but made fresh daily with a nice little grit to it. Fine little beer and wine selection too, stuff I actually drink.\n\nBut watch out, the tacos were really disappointing. Just a pile of meat on some cabbage. High quality meat, but very mildly seasoned and quite bland. And with the notable exception of the super fresh pico de gallo, the salsas were also bland. And I don't mean I need them to be hot and spicy, but they just lacked flavor, which was surprising given the quality of the ingredients.\n\nBut if you're careful about what you order, this can be a great place when you're in the mood for potentially healthier Mexican made with high-grade ingredients.

They even have a Baby Burrito option for a dollar less than the standard one; for someone who often faces the full-after-two-thirds-but-eats-the-last-third-anyway dilemma when ordering a burrito, this comes as a godsend.\n\nTheir tacos fall shorter; rather than a burrito in miniature, they place upon your two soft tortillas nothing but a tartly-dressed cabbage salad, a choice of meat, and a smattering of pico de gallo salsa. Your money is best spent on other choices.\n\nSalsa options aren't lacking -- they have five different choices ranging in style and spiciness -- but nor are they remarkable. Most of them lack flavor or savoriness; I never thought I'd call a salsa bland, let alone five of them, but that's exactly what they are.\n\nThe ambiance is clean, bright, and slightly sterile. Fortunately, that means that the place feels decidedly clean and sanitary, especially for a taqueria. Unfortuately, it's a less-than-cozy place to take refuge on a cold San Francisco night.\n\nAs the only Mexican place on Divisadero, Little Chihuahua serves its neighborhood well. I intend to return for many a burrito more, and eagerly await the day they improve their salsa.", "author": "Christian P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-26", "description": "I'd been craving some Mexican food lately.  A big burrito of carnitas, full of all sorts of bad goodness for your cholesterol and probably arteries.  My friend was coming up to the City and wanted to grab dinner.  \"You up for Mexican?  I've been craving it.  Or do you have any suggestions??\"  She didn't and said Mexican was ok.\n\nI was on Yelp looking up places and came across this place.  I downloaded the menu and I was drooling as I was reading it.  Plus it didn't sound greasy and fatty.  The pics looked cute and it was reasonably priced.  I sent her a text saying we should go to the Little Chihuahua.  She said \"Can we sit down there?\"  I said \"Yes, it's The Frijolito in W-Ville, you can sit down, or get it to go.  Except it looks better!\"  \n\nShe picked me up and said \"I'm starving.  I'm sorta craving Indian right now ...\"  Blah, whatever.  She said Mexican was ok, so there's no going back!!  We arrived and she got a salad and I decided to be good and get a regular burrito of carne asada on a spinach tortilla, with veg black beans (not re-fried) with no cheese, no guac and no sour cream.  I really wanted carnitas, but I figured fried pork is something I could not order for once.  I also got an awesome horchata.  I love those things.  So freakin' yummy.  Our food came out and the regular burrito was big!  Her salad was yummy looking and we were both happy kids.  Sadly, I ate the whole freakin' burrito, but it was good.  As other folks have said, it wasn't greasy so that's nice.  My friend said \"Ok, you were right about the place, it's good and better than the Frijolito.\"\n\nWhen we had arrived, there was only one other guy in the place.  It was about 6pm on a Thursday, so people were still heading home.  By the time we were finished eating, the placed had filled up.  There are about 10 tables or so, all enough for 2-4 people to sit.  It was nice seeing a dad out with his daughter who was reaching up to eat her cheese quesadilla from her chair.  At another table, a family of 4 was sitting down for dinner.  It was really refreshing to see parents out with their kids having dinner, talking with them.  You don't see that as much anymore.  \n\nIt's a nice little place, borderline hole in the wall, but super cute inside.  The service was pretty quick and you bus your own table when you're finished.  I'll definitely be back, but to stuff my face with a regular burrito of carnitas, cheese, guac, sour cream and re-fried beans on the highest calorie tortilla they have!!  I also saw one of their specials I think when ordered was arroz con leche.  Totally reminded me of my grandma when I was young and she would make it for me when I had a craving.  I was so tempted to try it.  A must next time when I'm dying for some comfort food.  They also had something up about homemade cupcakes ... *drool*.\n\nGreat place to stop if you're in the Lower Haight or heading home out towards the Park as it's just off the Haight 71 bus line.  I wish this place was closer to my hood.  \n\nThanks Little Chihuahua!!!", "author": "imelda j."}

When you walk in, you figure the place will be good. But the food's just all right, and every time you come, you forget just how all right it is--it's right in the middle of all right, mediocre. It is slightly better than Loco Taco was, and the pico de gallo tastes really fresh, but if you're expecting anything really good, don't get your hopes up.\n\nI live pretty close to this place, so I sometimes come because I'm just lazy. But if you're willing to walk a little, there's always Zona Rosa in the Upper Haight.\n\nFor the Divis old schoolers out there, this is also the former location of L-Rico, possibly the worst of the three incarnations of this place (at least since I moved to SF in 2003). But I did like L-Rico's setup better.\n\nGRATUITOUS-MEAT ALERT:  They use bacon in their refried and whole pinto beans.

The owner is really nice, as is everyone else who works the register.\n\nUPDATE:  9/16/08\n==============\n\nI'm dropping The Little Chihuahua down to two stars again because I just realized that it's completely wheelchair inaccessible.

Sustainable Mexican food seems to be all the rage in SF (really, a surprise?) and this place is hitting the sweet spot. My favorite Mexican place this side of Market.\n\nThe food. Enchiladas are great. Burritos are juicy and a healthy size. My Brazilian girlfriend is especially picky about her steak, beans, & rice, that being her staple meal back home, and she loves the enchiladas & burritos here. Definitely take two of their salsas to try with your meal. I go with the roasted tomato and the habanero (sparingly).\n\nThe place. It's a cozy little spot with a few 2-person tables, 1 4-person table, and a couple long, family style tables. Patrons are encouraged to sit down and get acquainted with their fellow Lower-Haighters, I believe. If you stay, you actually get to eat off of real plates with real silverware! Imagine... If you taking out, you may want to call ahead. It's a little bit of a longer wait than the average taqueria.", "author": "jim o."}

I would always come to this place when it was Loco Taco.  Since then I have moved out of the neighborhood but have managed to eat here on two separate occasions.\n\nThe first time the food was ordered with a large group of people by phone.  I was not there to look at the menu or ask any questions.  I simply ordered a Super Vegetarian Burrito, I shouldn't need to ask any questions, right?  My burrito comes and I am starving.  I took about two bites and realized that there were actual vegetables stuffed in and poking out of the burrito.  Granted I have nothing against vegetables but when I order a veggie burrito, all I want and all I expect is the simplicity of beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, hot sauce and on occasion some lettuce.  If I wanted corn, carrots and whatever the hell else was packed in there I would have damn well specified it.  I had a few more bites and couldn't eat anymore.  I was no longer hungry at that point.\n\nFor my second attempt a friend of mine suggests we eat here.  I was skeptical.  He tells me I should try the Fried Plantain and Black Bean burrito when he himself hasn't even tried it.  It was tangy and sweet which I was not accustomed to.  The red sauce was pretty spicy which I liked.  Half way through I had to stop and save the rest for a late snack.  Overall it was just alright.  I'd probably try it again. When it came time to pay my friend who picked the food up I found out the burrito was $8.95.  I think that's pretty absurd in the burrito world.  \n\nGoing back here will be a chore that I am just not ready for.", "author": "Patrick D."}

I would call it a taqueria but it is obviously a guero enterprise. And a good one at that. The prices are high but WORTH IT. \nHonestly this place is what I've always wanted in a burrito joint.\nI get the Baby Burrito with no meat (note: skip the marinated veggies). \n\nSo here are the major perks:\n1. fresh Ingredients. No sysco..\n2. top notch meat . Niman Ranch for the carnivores. Note that this is usually the weakest link with Taquerias especially the over-hyped ones.\n3. salt it yourself. They go easy on the salt here which I LOVE. If you find something lacking flavor add salt or dip a chip. You will be pleased by all the flavors awakened by this step.\n4. Love for the chili. Everything here is infused with roasted chili goodness. The kind of flavor experience you remember for life. This, to me is probably the most important and often overlooked aspect in this type of cuisine. It is all about the chilis.\n5. Every time I go into this place, Sabbath is playing. Instant comfort for me.\n6. Two blocks from home. \n\nI'll give you five stars if you'll just turn a nice profit and stay put.\n\nUpdate: April 08\n\nThey have new chips! And they are much better. They are what a chip should be: tortilla fried in oil. They remind of the handmade chips at this mexican place my grandmother used to take my brother and I to when we were kids. I can almost smell the rum and camel non-filters breath...wafting in under the light and crispy corn oil flavor. \nGrandma? You sure you should be driving us around town in your Cadillac after all those rum and cokes? Grandma! Careful with that cigarette, you almost burned me again...\n\nWhoa, went back in time there for a sec. RIP Grandma. You were ahead of your time in punk rock-ness.\n\nAnyway, the cool thing about the chip revolution is that the proprietor read a review on yelp, already knowing that this was the one real weakness on the menu, knowing that he couldn't fry his own and found something that works. \nThe fresh ingredients, the free range meats, the focus on the dynamic flavors of chile peppers, the recycling efforts and the nice receptive folks make this probably my favorite little family owned place in SF.", "author": "Derek O."}

And although I have tried to expand what I eat there, I am always drawn back to something containing plantains (which they will reluctantly put on other things besides the burritos).\n\nBut, although the price is a little higher than say El Toro, the food is better quality. Totally worth it. \n\nThese guys really take their food seriously, and want you to like it. The service (which is why you are paying more here than CanCun for example), is exemplary. It's pretty hands-off until you have a problem, then they are right there to help. An all-around great place!", "author": "Freud R."}

AND yay for a good mex place with FREE chips and $2 beers (I'm sold right there).\n\nWell we've tried a few things. Some OK. Some stellar so see below:\n\nPlantain Burrito- THE BEST thing we've tried thus far.  Super duper good.  Lots of flavor.  Good size. A definitely must to try.\n\nRegular steak burrito smothered- eh, go for the plantain or get sour cream and guac.  This burrito was missing something.\n\nGuacamole enchiladas-  Not bad. Not bad at all.  Still prefer the plantain burrito but these were pretty good and came with your choice of beans and rice.  The black beans had something about them that were pretty good.\n\nTostada salad-  This was also decent.  We got the chicken one and it came with lots of avocados and a crispy yummy shell.\n\nSo in conclusion Plantain burrito is awesome.  Everything else is ok BUT the salsa bar is a-ok and the beer is a GREAT deal", "author": "Rachel S."}

If you don't live in the Mission, or if you want your SF burrito to be sustainable and cow-friendly, the Little Chihuahua is the place to go. It's a little yuppified, this is true. And there is a kick missing in the flavor of the SFB. But I always feel a little healthier when I eat here. =) Except for when meals involve the pitchers of Sangria. Also, it's hit or miss with the crowds: I've been on a Monday night at 8 and it's been so packed we couldn't find a table. I've also been on a Tuesday night at 8 and 3 people were in the restaurant. It's a small space, so be prepared to wait at popular times. \n\nMy favorites: the chips and salsa (gratis, try the tomatillo), carne asada $5.95 for a nice-sized \"baby burrito\"). \nMust try: so they have their \"famous\" black bean and plantain burrito ($8.95).

My Super Carne Asada burrito was warm and toasty. They grill the tortillas. The Neiman Ranch steak inside was tender, juicy and full of carnal flavor. The rice, ..and this is important... the amount of rice to meat ratio was right. Not an all rice carbo bomb that you get at other burrito joints. There was only just enough rice to fill it out, letting the steak be the star of the show. They have refried black beans too. which was nice. And the salsa bar was just a small table of a half a dozen or so salsas, jalape\u00f1os and such. But that is all you will need. I have never had Tomatillo salsa this good! It is thick and rich.. and super tasty.  The haba\u00f1ero salsa is hot and good too.\n\nI am going back to try the other goods on the menu.

They also provide a water dish for those thirsty pups.  Very thoughtful for their animal loving patrons.\n\nIt's a small establishment with \"first come first serve\" rules.  You'll probably wait in line to order at the counter during the regular meal hours.  If you come with friends, you're not allowed to reserve seating until you've placed an order.  Seems harsh for a popular joint, but it's understandable considering the size of the restaurant.  For those busy hours, you can order to-go or call in for pickup.  If you decide to dine-in, you're asked to bus your own table after you've enjoyed your meal.  They have a bus station where you separate recycling/compost/and trash.\n\nThe food is delicious.  They have very large portions filled with extremely flavorful, healthy, organic, locally supported, fresh ingredients. They prepare everything as its ordered so you know nothing has been sitting around under heat lamps all day.  They're also vegetarian friendly providing tofu substitutions.  Their alcoholic beverages are delicious and strong.  I recommend their agave wine margaritas. Split a pitcher with friends, you won't regret it.* But they also have a variety of nonalcoholic drinks, including homemade horchata.  Lastly, I must mention their salsa bar.  I love condiments, and they don't disappoint.  They have everything from salsa verde, to habanero that first starts sweet and then brings on the flames.  Taste a little of everything, you'll love it all!\n\nAll in all, The Little Chihuahua will provide delicious healthy flavorful food and drinks that you'll absolutely enjoy, as long as you don't mind waiting a little while and busing your meal.

I'm new to this neighborhood, and I can tell that I will become a regular. \n\nI came here first when I was [practically] on my death bed...the tortilla chicken soup brought me back to life. The chicken itself was incredible. Definitely not that flavorless, rubbery stuff you usually find in chicken soup. The veggies were perfectly cooked, the broth spicy and flavorful. \n\nI came here again and got a carne asada burrito, and let me just say Papalote could learn a lesson from the Little Chihuahua. It was moist, tasty, the ingredients clearly very fresh. \n\nI docked them a star because of the price (I guess that's an SF thing to charge $10 for a burrito), but the food is near perfection.

I live a block away, uphill on the way there, downhill on the way back. They are a temptation no one should have that close. I love the sustainable proteins, the garlic shrimp queasily ( haha that was the spell check version) quesadilla and the amazing plantain burrito- due to overexposure in CA (Central America to all you californiacentereds) i don't eat fried banana or plantain unless here or at Zazie. \nBack  on track, my phone has upgraded LT to a \"favorite\" without asking so that shows the love. BUT twice recently i got a shrimp quesadilla and only had  two shrimp on one half, that sucked!  Unfortunately i really have to say since it got popular - the consistency is def a bit sketchy.\n Being the fan and I do mean fan, that I am and that I eat there a ton I mentioned it good naturedly and the guys behind the counter were awesome and responded they would send me a coupon or something in the mail for a discount or something.  I dont care about a free thing or a discount I just want my shrimpers. Never got either the shrimps on both sides of the quesadilla or coupons in the mail- whatever they were .\n\nhat was a bit disappointing, especially since i doubt shrimp or coupon got lost in the block between my house and the LT.\nLast time I ordered the Shrimp Quesadilla I asked for extra shrimp, that cost me $3.50 and sorry but  the shrimp was not much more at all than what I usually get. \nDamn I love you all but are you saying im eating too much shrimp? 8-9 (that's including the extra) shrimp  on a quesadilla for $ 13.00 was pretty disappointing. \n\nAs I said I do love you so i may just order today, but im hoping someone else will read this rather than the very friendly dudes who listened to my bitching before.

But Little Chihuahua is at least a substantially better joint than what it replaced, El Taco Loco. It smells better and it tastes better. I found the variety and taste of the four salsas to be better as well. When it was Taco Loco, the green sauce was sometimes flavorful and sometimes tasted like it was missing ingredients. Some days spicy, other days not.\n\nI ordered my usual -- super carnitas burrito with black beans -- and I thought it was great. It wasn't ridiculously juicy and fatty like the previous folks prepared it sometimes. The serving of chips (when taken to go) comes in a dinky little paper bag, though -- a glorified handful.\n\nPrices aren't down near the competitiveness of the Mission, but now I feel like I'm getting what I paid for.

The Camarones quesadilla is super good, as well as the burritos, which also conveniently come in a 'baby,' size if you're not starved. The beef is Nieman Ranch and they have no problem scoopin' out the sour cream. Store is clean and they put lots of tasty veggies into their food. Can;t give a five because when compared to Lap Palma on 24th and Bryant or or my all time fave , el Farolito it's just not as divine, but still, pretty damn good. Bravo!", "author": "Steve l."}

But today I looked inside and saw all of the carved wooden chairs, the cozy homeyness of the place... I went back to try their fried plantain and black bean burrito. O.M.G. The flavors were so perfect I ate the entire thing in one sitting, savoring every last bite.  Washed it down with some cheap red wine and I was in absolute heaven. The chipotle salsa was rich and scrumptious too. The space is tight and awkward for maneuvering around in, but the service is hard-working and extra nice.  :)", "author": "ella j."}

It seemed as though the burrito wasn't as tasty as it used to be. And it seemed as though the people not as friendly.

The chips are all-you-can-eat, so don't be afraid to ask for refills. The burritos were nothing out of the ordinary. They don't taste bad, but they're definitely not superb as well. The steak doesn't really have a special grilled taste, nothing was extremely aromatic. I loved the salsa and condiment bar. Self-serve and you can take all you want without feeling embarrassed. That's a plus, since most taquerias and Mexican joints nickel and dime you with the sauces and extras. The chips were a bit stale, but good since they weren't drenched in oil.

But by the end of our meal the tables where packed and their was a line to place your order.  Try to come early to avoid the wait.  The restaurant is on the small size and can get claustrophobic and hot due to the kitchen.  At first I was a bit confused on the ordering, either \"A\" do I sit down and they take my order or \"B\" go up to the counter/kitchen area and place the order.  The answer is B you make your order at the counter grab your number and pick a table. Just like Farolitos or a Tres Amigos whole in the wall restaurants.  I wasn't expecting that here, since the restaurant looked more nicer then a Farolitos.  After placing your order and picking your table you can then go to the small salsa bar. Get your salsa of choice and your utensils and enjoy with your free tortilla chips.\n\nThe food came out fast and hot. I had the two enchiladas in red guajillo sauce rice and black beans.  When I first saw the enchiladas, they looked smaller then regular size tortillas but that could of just been an optical illusion?!... anyways. One of the enchilada was grilled chicken and the second was carne asada.  Both very tasty meat moist and enough cheese in the enchiladas.  The red guajillo sauce had a nice spice which lingered in every bite from beginning to end.  I love having that spice through out my meal.  The black beans where a nice side, a bit creamy and went well with the rice.  My friend had the carne asada burrito, whole wheat tortilla.  I had a bite of the burrito and to my surprise it was very tasty.  Next time I will opt for the burrito.  Don't forget to wash everything down with their home made horchata.  It was spectacular! Not like you would get at any other Mexican place.  It had a fresh taste and the cinnamon was not over powering, a bit thicker then most horchatas but not as sweet, very tasty.\n\nOne thing that I did notice eating at Little Chihuahua is that for once I was the minority in a Mexican/Tex Mex restaurant.  From start to finish of the evening every customer coming in and out of the place where caucasian.  Oh and yes I do think this is more Tex Mex (Americanized) Mexican food.  Thus adapting to the caucasian crowed.  Nothing wrong with that.  It does give boring/regular everyday Mexican food a twist.  Which I enjoy every now and then.  Would I return to Little Chihuahua? Yes I would!  One thing I did not enjoy are the bulky chairs, its so hard to move around, pull in and out of the tables.  I'm thinking its the tile and the wood that are not getting along.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-04-26", "description": "This place is overrated and overpriced.  Unfortunately, this is the only carry out burrito joint in the neighborhood so they still get my money.  Burritos are small.  Get the baby burrito - it is almost exactly the same size as the adult version.  For some reason they like to cook the crap out of the tortilla so it is crispy with little burn marks on the outside.  I don't like this.  They do the same thing at Taco Bell.  Also, when you aren't paying attention they will put shredded cabbage in your burrito.  Salsa is pretty meh...  Good atmosphere inside with the exception of the generic concrete/spray paint art for sale on the walls.  The staff normally have a pretty hip taste in music.  Long story short - this is the best burrito in the neighborhood but not nearly as good as something in the Mission.  Expect to pay a little more for the convenience.", "author": "James C."}

The area has been hurting for a good place like this for over a decade.  My family is very picky when it comes to Mexican food and for me the shrimp burrito is the bar-setter. Little Chihuahua not only nailed it but as I ordered they mentioned the garlic shrimp burrito which I tried the second visit.  Both were good but the garlic shrimp had a little extra kick that really hit the spot.  My son loves the carne asada burrito which is prepared to order and not slopped out of a bowl.  My wife tried the plantain and black bean burrito and loved it.  She's not a big burrito eater and prefers tofu tacos which she felt theirs could have been better. \n\nOverall this place is a gem in the neighborhood.  Freshly cooked meats, organic ingredients, good portions, the list goes on.", "author": "T M."}

The crowd there, at least that Sunday, were pretty laid back and normal- the service was very fast and friendly. We bussed our table and left and it was taken right away- but I didn't have the feeling that the table vultures were hovering and hungry. Just happy to get a timely seat.

At first I thought there wasn't even any cheese in it but there was, just barely any. And when I get nachos I want helluv cheese.  The service was really good and the new owners have cleaned up the place quite a bit. Now this \"ambiance\" everyone is talking about is actually the exact same way it was when it was the Loco Taco.  Now I understand that I need to try something besides the Nachos and actually sit down in there to eat it right off the grill to see if this is actually above the taco shop level. But the food seems about the same as it was before, just more expensive. Since I live a block away I'm sure I'll end up eating there more and will adjust this review if necessary.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-10", "description": "I have loved this place since it opened, and it's definitely a perfect addition to the area. Lets face it, there are great taquerias in SF, tons of them, mostly in the mission. There is \"authentic\" Mexican food, (is it just me or do only white people ever actually gripe about the authenticity of their Mexican food?), there are Americanized joints, and all number of other manifestations built around beans and tortillas. Little Chihuahua, in my experience, occupies its own distinctive place as a taqueria, so any review that tries to talk about what it SHOULD be fails to realize that they SHOULD have just gone to the place that serves that type of food.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I ate their food was how boldly the tomato flavor stands out in the sauce on their smothered burrito. I've had spicy, mild, watery, red, green, but I don't think I've ever had a sauce that really brought out the flavor of the tomatoes that form its base, and I love it. Aside from that, they have several salsas at the bar, nothing totally spectacular or rich in flavor, but I do like the particular tart-zinginess of the habanero salsa.\n\nThe menu isn't huge, but the ingredients in everything are a notch above your typical taqueria faire. If you order a carne asada burrito, you'll be surprised to find not some leathery brown strips of meat in there, but juicy, tender slices of neimann-ranch steak, still a little pink in the middle, seared just right on the edges. Similarly, the shrimp burrito is stuffed with large jumbo shrimp, bursting with flavor. Their tostada salad is a nice light option, emphasizing the salad and dressed with zesty lime, piled on a fluffy, crunchy tostada. \n\nThere are only really two things I can complain much about. First would be that I'm not a huge fan of their chips. I'm much more of a fan of the greasier, sliced-up-corn-tortilla style chips you get from most taquerias. The other would be (and this is perhaps both a function of how many times I've been there, and the fact that they are still just starting out) that they are sometimes a little inconsistent. Most of the time, the food is great. The first few times I went in, I was more than impressed. But there have been a few times when it didn't live up to what I know they're capable of. Whether the shrimp ends up being slightly over(or under)-cooked, or they are maybe in a bit of a hurry and don't throw enough of something in the burrito, I've been disappointed maybe 2 or 3 times, only once where it really diminished my appetite for the food. That's out of several dozen times eating there, though, and nobody's perfect.\n\nStop in. Get a carne asada burrito, or a shrimp burrito. Make sure it's super and smothered. You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Cooper B."}
