And I don't mean because coins are virtually useless, only good for chucking at pantomimes, but because this park is awesome!! My infrequent trips to San Francisco have been brief vacations, because even with how fast I drive, San Francisco is not a convenient weekend getaway! It's a good 5 hour drive, minimum. Sure, when I was young, no kid, no wife.... Hell, I used to make it from LA to Seattle in 18 hours. But, once again: young, no kid, no wife. But wives need to eat. Kids need to poop. Both get all grumpy otherwise. Wives and kids don't understand about \"making good time!\" It's all moot now anyway.... I'm old. No way I drive 1,200 miles in 18 hours again! Maybe I should get back to the review.....\n\nYou could easily spend an entire day at Golden Gate Park. Possibly two! There's just that much to do. To me, it's reminiscent of San Diego's Balboa Park, in that it's a huge, sprawling oasis of activities and attractions. LA has much the same features, but they're all spread out individually over a wide expanse, and getting from one to the next takes an hour in traffic. So, it's nice to have everything condensed, like GGP or Balboa Park.\n\nThere's a variety of gardens and picturesque spots to wander around. There's a variety of museums to explore. There's a variety of sporting activities you can partake in. And if you're into people watching (which is rather voyeuristic, and therefore you should be imprisoned, you pervert!) there's a variety of people to watch. There's a little something for everyone in a more relaxed atmosphere, away from the hustle and bustle and assorted commotion of the City by the Bay, whoa-oa-oa.", "author": "Michael H."}

The park itself is beautiful and this time we went to the Japanese Tea Garden which we loved, it's not too big so we went about an hour.\n\nBEWARE: Do NOT park on Martin Luther King Jr. Dr.. We had our car broken into; the back window was smashed open and my backpack was stolen. Nothing was visible from the exterior of the car but I think they knew they could reach through to the trunk from the back window. We saw several other cars with back and side windows smashed in. We called the police and they wouldn't send anyone out; instead we had to do the police report over the phone and it sounds like they out source that. I spoke to a local walking with his baby, he says its been happening for the last few years now due to the increase in homeless and just overall crime. If you go to the park please park somewhere else that has more traffic although Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. seemed to be a high traffic street to us. I'm just going to avoid the park all together until they do something about the crime but I think overall the crime has increased in San Francisco. A local we saw at a gas station said his car was broken into near his work too.\n\nI just hope this review helps someone avoid the terrible time we went through.", "author": "H. K."}

For tourists it's just too big to walk between places on weekdays, they do offer shuttle rides on weekends and major holidays though. \n\nWe came here on a Monday so there was no shuttles at all, and the De Young museum was closed too. We weren't interested in the science museum so we just walked around a bit. The rose garden was so small with no blooming roses, and we were just too tired to walk more. Some fountains were dry so they weren't too pretty to look at. So basically coming here was a complete waste of time for me, I should've just gone back to hotel to take a nap! At least sister enjoyed it and took many photos. \n\nI don't recommend this park for tourists, it's huge and it will take too many hours to tour the good places like Japanese tea garden, windmills, tulip, rose gardens, the lake and some more. It's not worth it to spend that much time here in my opinion!\n\nBut if you have enough time, by all means come here to spend half day or even a whole day to enjoy this beautiful park!", "author": "Mimi L."}

The park itself is not the smallest park, so a heads up on that note. As for parking, expect the typical SF madness, but the museums offer underground parking at a decent hourly rate (My recommendation). \n\nAs mentioned before, expect a full day here if you have the time as this park is easily walkable, but has many attractions to explore. My favorites are easily the de young museum and the main flora (and various fauna) that is well maintained throughout the park. Other attractions include the famous California Science Academy, Japanese tea garden, aquarium, botanica, etc. You can totally picnic here, so I'd suggest a nice and sunny day so you can really take in the people watching or nature views. With that said, there are also other food options nearby outside the park that are pretty phenomenal, so it really depends on what you want to do. \n\nWith all of that said, easily a must stop if you are looking at this from a tourist perspective.", "author": "Ryan A."}

There were many places to hide away from crowds even though there's many attractions scattered throughout this park to attract them. We actually rented a bike and traveled as much as we could from east to west. There were many sidewalks to share with walkers, but most of the time we cycled on the road and felt relatively safe due to the slow speed limits.\n\nSOME THINGS WE SAW\nHalf the areas inside the park require an admission price such as the Science Museum and Japanese Tea Garden while others were easy to just enter and view such as the bison enclosure, the Dutch windmill, many playing fields and playgrounds. \n\nRESOURCES FOR A VISITOR\nThere's a few areas to grab a snack or drink, but not open as late as some attractions. With many trails and relatively calm roads, you'll run into many joggers and cyclists.

Cherry blossoms, bonsai-looking trees, koi fish etc.\n\nWe also ventured over to the Rose garden (Free) next door and found nothing to be in bloom unfortunately. \n\nWe then took a stroll to Stow Lake where we saw some herons, ducks, and turtles in the lake.\n\nWe revisited the park later on in the day around 6 pm to watch the sunset by Ocean beach, by the Dutch Windmill and Tulip garden (also free) and was blessed with ample parking and a gorgeous view.\n\nWe also did a quick drive to Bison Paddock but they were hiding in the back. :( Overall a great experience and I'd come back to do the remaining half of the park!", "author": "Christine H."}

I'll start by saying that I'm not sure if parking is allowed along the main roads anymore. Upon entering from Sunset Avenue, I saw a sight that read \"No Parking 10:00 am to 6:00 pm everyday\". I don't know how old that sign is, but I believe it is not that old. I got there before 10:00 am, but didn't wanted to get cited and parked Lincoln Avenue.\n\nHaving grown up in S.F, I took for granted how lucky I was to have such a huge park in the city. It was only recently that I've been looking at it with a (amateur) photographer's eye. It is truly magnificent and on sunny mornings I am reminded why it is so special. Writing about it simply does not do it justice, so I took a few pics.\n\nThere is something so wonderful about being there in the morning. The only folks around are joggers and people walking their dogs. With sun peeking between the trees and a few birds singing, it feels like you're a thousand miles away from the city. At that time of the morning it is pretty quiet and very, very peaceful. The light is fantastic and creates dramatic shadows. If you're lucky, there might be some fog that has started to dissipated in sun.\n\nThis past Sunday I was there with my commuter mug of coffee and my camera and I simply wanted to stop time. I've driven along Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and noted how beautiful the light is at that time and promised myself I would stop one day and shoot what I see. The area in particular is Mallard Lake and Elk Grove Lake. This is a must-see for Bay Area natives or out-of-towners alike.

Even though it's so close to where everyone is, it's kind of like its own escape into nature. It's just so lush and peaceful there, and the pond always reflects the light so well. If you go there when it's foggy out (which is my favorite time to go), I'd kind of liken it to being in like the rainforest exhibit in a zoo. \n\nMy only gripe about the park is it's more crowded than you would expect, especially if you're around the Conservatory of Flowers on the weekend. For such a big park, you'd think people would spread out, but there are just too many people. And people love walking without purpose, so it's sometimes hard to just cut through the park if you're actually trying to get somewhere quickly. But I realize that I hate slow walkers more than most people, and this is a pervasive problem throughout the city, not just here.\n\nJust a warning to people not from here: this place is not immune from the classic SF charm.

It is over three miles long east to west, and about half a mile north to south. 13 million people visit this great park annually. Tho in the Summer of '69 their was perhaps half our hippy nation here spreading peace & love with the Grateful Dead & psychedelic poet Timothy Leary. \n\nToday, it's a park for all to enjoy. Popular attractions include: The Conservatory of Flowers (est. 1879), the \"twin\" Dutch windmills (est. 1903), The Ornate Carousel (est. 1914), Stow Lake & Falls (1890's), Bison Paddock (est. 1891), California Academy of Sciences (est. 1853), De Young Museum (est. 1893), Japanese Tea Garden & Tea House (est. 1894), Garden of Shakespeare's Flowers (est. 1928), and the Children's Playground (est. 1888) where the Carousel can be found too. \n\n\"If you're going to San Francisco\nBe sure to wear some flowers in your hair\nIf you're going to San Francisco\nYou're gonna meet some gentle people there...\nIf you come to San Francisco\nSummertime will be a love-in there...\"\n\nWell almost.

This year was a doozy of a year, with some incredible moments. Probably some of my best. And although the year isn't over yet, I know for sure that my favorite moment from 2017 was a picnic.\n\nPicnics are incredible experiences. You take the best of the indoors (food, duh) and bring it to the outdoors. Everything tastes better. Everything is more beautiful, more vibrant, and even the simple ingredients are elevated. Cheese. Bread. Mustard. Salami. Grapes. These are the staples of a good picnic.\n\nI did not picnic at Golden Gate park, but while driving through recently I was reminded of how badly I still want to. It's been months and months since I had a picnic--since that favorite time of the year--and I really wish I was still picnicking across the country. Is that a job? Is that a life? Can we just do that? Picnic across the country and make every day a favorite memory?\n\nGolden Gate Park is the perfect picnic spot. It's got huge bits of lawn, walking trails, massive trees, but it's also extremely accessible from all sides, so you can grab a sammich at a local spot and get there quick. Blue skies, foggy skies, I don't even care (though you'll have more crowds on a bright beautiful sunny day) I just want to have that picnic life.\n\nI've spent some time in the park before, but usually it was with friends who wanted to go disc golfing. It's my favorite DG course in the world, and you should definitely put it on your wish list. \n\nIf you're not lucky enough to have a picnic partner who's into the life, or disco golf buddies, you can use the park for plenty of other things: walks, runs, people watching, botanical gardens, a tea garden, the windmill, the De Young Museum, flower conservatory, playgrounds, arboretum, a carousel, an aquarium, and really, so much more. I want to picnic here and explore it all, please.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

My 200th was for Point Lobos in Carmel; I wanted to pick another special place for this review. Golden Gate Park (GGP) is the king of all parks. With 1,017-acres and numerous things to do and see, GGP is phenomenal. I spent several hours on my last day in California and only got to see a small portion of this enormous iconic park.\n\nThere is just too much to mention in one review and I also didn't see everything. So, I am simply going to recommend my favorite part from my visit. Stow Lake Waterfalls & Park is a wonderful place to relax and take photos if you're into photography like me. I saw squirrels, birds and I swear I even spotted a fox! Of course, there's also the gorgeous waterfalls and Chinese pagoda. Strawberry Hill is included at Stow and it allows you to see a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\n*Tip--I saw plenty of parking around the lake and this was on a Saturday.\n\nI didn't know until today when I was researching for this review that there is a free shuttle at GGP. It would definitely be helpful when trying to cover such a vast area. Here is the link: https://goo.gl/Dtyqw2\n\nI'm not sure that I will visit on my next trip simply because there are too many places for me to explore and too little time, but if I ever move to the Bay Area, my feet would eventually cover every last inch of GGP.

If you look on a map or gaze down from any of the view spots in the city such as Grand View Park, you can truly appreciate how magnificent this park is. It pretty much takes up a huge chunk of San Francisco, and from an elevation, all you will see is dense forest engulfing the city. \n\nThere are a number of entrances into the park, and subsequently, you can park yourself in any of the many parking spots scattered around Golden Gate Park. Even on the weekend when all the kids come out to play, it IS possible to find parking if you are patient. Just remember where you parked and that the limit to stay is about 3 hours!\n\nThere's a number of maps scattered around the park which will help you navigate to where you need to go. Honestly, I'd suggest you just get yourself lost and come across new destinations! Or, if you are intent on exploring much see places, check out De Young Museum, Cal Academy of Sciences, the Japanese Tea Garden, and the many lakes!\n\nMy favorite part of the park was probably the short hike up to Strawberry Hill. It's not too strenuous, and you get a great glimpse of the city. I wish there were waterfalls and a cleaner lake, but it's still a great experience!\n\ntl'dr Golden Gate Park will cater to most people's interests. That's how awesome it is.", "author": "Bryan W."}

The Presidio is the park that adjoins the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park is located about four miles from the bridge.  Confusion aside, for someone wanting some exercise, there is a bike path/bike lanes that connect both of this lovely San Francisco parks.\n\nRegarding the Golden Gate Park, there is a lot to see and do in this park.  It reminds me of San Diego's Balboa Park or Washington DC's National Mall given the monuments, museums and gardens sprinkled throughout.  There are a lot of paved paths and sidewalks here that are perfect for walkers and joggers. Cyclists, whether causal in jeans or serious in spandex, should use the bike lanes.  Although you could quickly cruise through the park in a car I recommend stopping to smell the roses and buffalo, or maybe just the roses. There are various statuary and monuments that are worth a look too. Other big destinations in the park include California's Academy of Sciences (a science center, aquarium and natural history museum all housed under one roof) and the de Young Museum featuring a variety of art.", "author": "Courtney K."}

Here is our experience.\n\nWe started from the Northwest corner at Fulton & Great Highway. There are two main streets: John F. Kennedy Dr and Martin Luther King Jr Dr. We took John F. Kennedy Dr all the way to Stow Lake. It was too far for us to go all the way across. There was so much to see on John F. Kennedy Dr. There was the windmill, the bison, several beautiful lakes, two waterfalls, a river/stream, and finally Stow Lake. There are several restroom points all along this street.\n\nWe looped around Stow Lake and took Martin Luther King Jr Dr. back. There was really nothing on this street to see. There were minimal restrooms along this street.\n\nTIPS:\n-The streets run with the paths for the most part. People on the paths and cars on the road.\n-On the path there are several spots where a map of the park is posted knowing where you are.\n-John F. Kennedy Dr is far better for sights and picture taking.\n-Parking is free throughout the park if you can find a spot.\n-Uber/Lyft drivers hang out in the park for a quick ride out.\n\n\nPersonally, this place is great for everyone.  The natural beauty is breathtaking and amazing. I think the next time we come, we would drive through the park rather than walk.", "author": "Sam N."}

That said, my favorite urban parks are not American, but Canadian.  First on my list is Parc du Mont-Royal and second is Stanley Park in Vancouver.  In my mind, these are 5 star events ... the first for crowning the mountain in the middle of Canada's most interesting metropolis and the second for hugging the promontory at the peninsular end of Vancouver's downtown core.\n\nHowever, Golden Gate Park is still an incredible city park and a destination in and of itself.  It seems to stretch about half the western half of San Francisco, though it's not particularly wide, and touches the Great Highway at the Pacific Ocean.  It is almost fully rectilinear, much like New York's Central Park.  With that in mind, it does not cover any of the hilliness that is part and parcel of San Francisco, though it is near it.\n\nThe variety of landscapes in the park is nevertheless something to behold, with lakes, ponds, monuments, recreational amenities, forests, the funky windmills, and other points of interest.  I would have to say that my favorite things in Golden Gate Park are some of the lakes and the Conservatory of Flowers, for its being a beautiful landmark and for the incredible color show put on by the flowers and plantings.  \n\nPlease be aware that, even though the park is heavily used, relaxing, and just a great place to be, do not leave valuables or personal objects visible in your car.  There are sometimes waves of \"smash and grab\" incidents and that would be a sad way to have your visit here sullied. (Incidentally, finding parking is doable ... most of the time.)

You can literally get lost in this huge maze of parks, museums and gardens (and on a recent ACRONYM trip, luckily our trusty leader Jessica T. navigated the way for us!) Make sure to take some time to visit the individual gardens or one of the in-park museums, but note that although the park itself is free, the museums and gardens are paid admission. However, I highly recommend the Japanese Tea Garden, and they offer free admission when entering the gardens before 10:00am on Mon, Wed, Fri. In addition to this, you can find a tulip garden, Shakespearean garden and botanical garden within walking distance. \n\nFor museum visits, you'll find the California Academy of Science and the De Young Museum. But if you want to stay outside to enjoy the sites, check out the buffalo, carousal or tennis courts or one of the many green spaces. Plus, you'll find a lovely children's playground on site to help get some wiggles out of your young ones.

The Middle of the park consists of lots of dog friendly trails that wrap around a lake, and you can even rent row and paddle boats if you're in the mood. Too lazy for physical activity? Well you can sit and relax and feed the ducks then, since there are park benches about every couple hundred yards apart facing the lake.\n\nThere was even a water fall that you could choose from taking a stone path across the base of to a gazebo, or the stairs that climb beside the sides of the water fall to another trail at the top.\n\nYou can also find the De Young fine arts museum here which is extremely affordable for the classy type ($10 for general admission and $6 for students) or if you're a free loader like myself, you can just go to the top of the museum which gives off a 360 degree view of the city and park all around, and the best part is it's free to everyone.\n\nJust a couple of steps across from the De Young is also the Academy of Science museum. Admission with student ID can still be a little pricey ($30) but it's definitely worth it! \n\nMost of the museum is pretty much a giant aquarium, ranging from a large quantity of sea and fresh water fish and marine life, with a few science exhibits at the base of the first floor, and a giant indoor terrarium rainforest that you can go inside and observe free flying birds, butterflies, African leaf cutter ants, and plants. In the center of it all is a pond filled with alligator gar the size of a full grown man just swimming around like \"yeah no big deal!\" But keep in the mind the indoor terrarium is extremely hot and humid!!\n\nAt the very roof of the entire academy is an outside deck with a view of the entire park and rooftop ferns. \n\nParking is little bit of pain, but the golden gate park is something that was 100% worth it!

Our itinerary consisted of:\n\n-Japanese Tea Garden ($8 adults, $6 for Child 5-17)\n-Picnic on top of Strawberry Hill (Cross the bridge and follow the trail)\n-Admired the waterfall on the other side of Strawberry Hill (Sprinklers might be on so it gets a little muddy)\n-Pedal boated around Stow Lake for an hour ($35 flat rate for a 6 seater, lots of birds)\n-Rose Garden (FREE)\n\nApart from the activities listed above, the park also is home to the DeYoung Museum and Cal Academy of Sciences...That being said, there is literally so much to do here. You could spend the whole day. \n\nWe parked in the garage below the park and I spent $25 for 5 hours...not sure if that's the all-day rate or not, I missed the sign with the prices. But there is free street parking in the surrounding area that you can also look for. \n\nI encourage a visit here at least once. Spend a day exploring every crack of the park.", "author": "Melanie B."}

Today, though, I couldn't spend enough time here. The difference between the two visits is clearly my maturity level and attention span. As a young, mischievous, hyperactive, child I found the museum, and most museums, relatively boring. As such, if the purpose of your trip is to focus on and appreciate the collection of art, I wouldn't recommend coming with young children. Actually, infants should be fine, but children who are old enough to complain will (I speak from experience) and the trip will be less enjoyable for all. However, there are certainly lots of families at the park and if you're just looking for a place to relax with your family, this place is ideal for that as well.\n\nThis trip, I found the trees relaxing and the statues aesthetic. There is a dome that was the gifted to the park that is great for pictures, and there is a beautiful sculpture of Francis Scott Key that is sure to be enjoyed by art connoisseurs and history buffs alike.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-05", "description": "I've been to Golden Gate Park a few times. This is a huge public park, encompassing over 1,000 acres (approximately 3 miles by 0.5 mile) in northwest San Francisco. There's a bunch of green space, trees, and facilities for indoor and outdoor sports and activities of all sorts including golf, tennis, track and field, polo, archery, football, soccer, baseball, ultimate frisbee, disc golf, and more. There are playgrounds for kids, museums, a concert venue, gardens, a flower conservatory, a botanical garden, multiple lakes, and plenty of paved trails, hills, and scenic views. In a population-dense city like San Francisco, it's hard to ask for more.\n\nThis is a popular and busy park. One of the main highlights is the Music Concourse. Most first-time visitors to the park probably stop by this area. One reason is because the tourist buses stop here regularly since there are a lot of attractions in the immediate vicinity. They include a fine arts museum (De Young), the California Academy of Sciences, and a five-acre Japanese Tea Garden. The Japanese Tea Garden is the oldest Japanese public garden in the country. Note that even though it's public, there is an admission fee (unless you go before 10am on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday).\n\nI recommend checking out the Music Concourse because it's a great place for hanging out, taking pictures, and having a picnic. Sometimes, food trucks will park nearby. The area is scenic because there are tons of pruned trees which give the oval space a really cool and unique look. There are benches to sit and relax on and multiple fountains to gaze at. There are picnic tables and restrooms located behind the classic, grandiose-looking Spreckels Temple of Music (where bands play). Sometimes, food trucks park behind the temple. It's a good place to stop and grab a bite to eat. This is where I tried out the Annakoot Indian food truck from Berkeley. This area is also the meeting point for the park's Segway tours.\n\nThe golf course isn't a full-fledged 18-hole championship course. It's a small, 9-hole, par 3 course. It costs about $20 to play a round. San Francisco residents get a discount. There's a driving range and golf instruction available too.\n\nFor a public park, I think Golden Gate Park is satisfactorily maintained. There are public restrooms scattered about. They aren't in the best condition, but they aren't filthy dirty either. Some of the restrooms do not have toilet paper or paper towels (or hand drying machines). Some parts of the park have a lot of litter. There are bunches of homeless people too. It's not uncommon to smell weed while walking through the park, especially when you're at or near the Haight St (surprise) entrance.\n\nGolden Gate Park-goers are an eclectic bunch from young to old, locals to tourists, runners to break dancers.\n\nIn the end, this is a fine large urban park. San Franciscans are lucky to have it.", "author": "Daniel B."}

We also noticed people racing their toy sailboats around Spreckels Lake. \n\nIn terms of recommendations, I would recommend stopping by the rose garden. So many beautiful roses to smell and look at. I also really enjoyed visiting the two windmills in the park, seeing the bison, and going geocaching. My favorite thing though that I've done in the park is definitely the Conservatory of Flowers, which is the oldest Victorian Greenhouse west of the Thames. I still feel like there is so much more for me to see and I cannot wait to return.", "author": "Samantha A."}

We walked passed the rose garden, saw the entrance of the Japanese garden, and rested at this area across of the Japanese garden that had a stage.  The best moments were laying on the grass and staring up at the sky.  The cloud or maybe it was fog, moved so fast!  There was a Chinese man dancing randomly to Chinese music.  It was hilarious but he has a lot of guts to be dancing the way he did in public.  There's stands available such as pretzels and hotdogs.

I've played here a couple of times now and really enjoy the course.  It's very well maintained, has beautiful, descriptive signs to guide you to the hole, and is all around an excellent course.  It's challenging, but not too bad.  I've been playing for about a year and feel I could par it with a couple more visits.\n\nThe one thing that is frustrating is the waits.  A lot of new people play here, which is fine, but if you are a new, slow group, PLEASE let others play through you.  When 2 people are coming through and driving 200+ feet per throw, your group of 4 or 5 throwing 20 feet at a time needs to kindly offer to let them play ahead of you.  It's a small annoyance, but should be noted.\n\nIf you see a big backup on hole one, start on hole ten.  Then once you get around to 18 just go back to one.

Also not sure if this is a common occurrence, I doubt it is, but after my friends and I found parking, we saw a whole row of cars that had their windows broken into... in broad daylight which is insane and actually didn't make that much sense to us since there're quite a few police cars patrolling around the place.

I unfortunately have not participated in either of these, but if you are new in town they may be worth a try. \n\nIf you are weirded out by homeless people (which you shouldn't be) you should know that they are everywhere in the park.

Major features in this park include Spreckles Temple of Music, De Young Museum, Academy of Sciences, the Japanese Tea Garden, the Conservatory of Flowers, Botanical Gardens, Stow Lake, active Windmills, Bison paddock, a Carousel built in 1914, the Rose Garden, and various trails for hiking, jogging, or simple leisurely walks. \n\nThe abundance of plant life that exists here is astounding! There were many times I felt like I was frolicking around Jurassic Park! Every so often I would wonder whether a pterodactyl would peek its head out from around the overbearingly tall trees.

I would recommended a solid full day to get around the area. \n\nMy first impression of the park was excellent since we stumbled upon Bay to Breakers which is an am run proceeded by a huge costume party/sun worship in the park that lasts nearly all day. In full San Fran style we saw every costume; and lack thereof; imaginable.The park is a great place to host an event like this  with wide open lawns, secret garden pathways and large trees to chill/sober-up under.\n\nWe saw only about 1/3 of the park since we were walking and decided to stop in the flower conservatory and the Japanese botanical gardens rather than hoof through straight to the bridge. \n\nThe flower conservatory is a nice, historic building with five flower rooms recreating various tropical zones. Pretty orchids and nice ponds make for a pleasant tour.\n\nThe Japanese botanical gardens is obviously a tourist hot spot but luckily we got there after lunch so it was relatively empty. The Japanese garden grounds are beautiful, well-maicured and full of sculptural treasures both plant and bronze. The little tea house serves a nice selection of snacks and traditional Japanese treats. With a view of the pond, it's a nice place to sit and sip.\n\nThe wild areas of the park are lovely, big California-style forest make for a peaceful stroll in the afternoon.\n\nHighly recommended, the Golden Gate Park is a great spot for a sunny afternoon break from other tourist spots.\n\nT.", "author": "Tara M."}

Many of the smaller trails are not marked, so keep that in mind when walking or biking. Overall it's a nice park to check out if you're visiting San Francisco.", "author": "Matt P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-08", "description": "Golden Gate Park one of my favorite places in San Francisco.\nIt's probably the main reason why I can go months without realizing I haven't gotten out of the city.\n\nIt has many things I like:\n - It has lots of trees. I'm from the Pacific Northwest, and I get cranky when I'm not near enough trees.\n - It's a big park, and all those trees help block out the city and makes it seem like you're getting away from it all\n - At the same time, you're never too far from food or public transportation.\n - It has many open meadows for picnics and paths in the forest for exploring.\n - There are plenty of moderately clean public restrooms throughout the entire park.\n - It has a ton of bike paths. On Sundays, one of the main roads is closed to cars.\n - It's mostly flat, so you can get pretty far on bike or running without tiring out.\n\nIf it's your first time there, the best way to see the park is on a bike. Preferably go on a Sunday, when they close the road. Even if you go when cars are allowed, the bike lanes are pretty nice.\nStarting from the entrance near the Panhandle, you get the colorful Conservatory of Flowers, the \"Skatin' Place\" (happens on Sundays afternoons; you'll know it when you pass it), and that area with all those museums and the guy playing saxophone under the bridge. Once you pass under the highway, cars are allowed on the road and you're stuck in a bike lane, but it's a much quieter part of the park. There's a lake with huge miniature boats, a bison paddock, one of the windmills, and the Pacific Coast. If it's a clear day and you've made it this far, I recommend walking north to the landing outside of the Cliff House and look down the coast. Amazing!\nThe first section of JFK can get crowded on nice days, but it's wonderful seeing so many folks enjoying the park: children on tricycles, rollerbladers, runners, a guy pushing a grocery cart, bicyclists in fancy pants, a family on scooters.\n\nThere are also some nice places along MLK in the south, but it's not quite as wonderfully bike-friendly as JFK. The bike lanes are nonexistent at points and Highway 1 barges through and ruins the illusion of being away from the city.\n\nOnce you've done that, just check out the hundreds of little paths all over the park.", "author": "Jessica S."}

On this visit, we entered from the Great Highway, parked on the street and meandered thru on foot to view the windmills, Bison, Spreckles Lake and the soccer/polo fields.  There is ample street parking at 10:30 am on a Tuesday- just remember where you parked.  Its easy to lose your bearings here.\nOur next stop was Strawberry Hill and Stow Lake.  Time was limited so we drove there and easily found street parking.  Wandering around here will take you to a man made waterfall, lush vegetation and Chinese Gazebo. The waterfall is not powerful enough to spray you, but there were water sprinklers going during our visit making the ground wet and muddy in spots.  Stow lake offers recreational watercraft rentals.  \nOur last stop was the De Young store and cafe for lunch. You could probably walk from your parking spot at Stow lake to the De Young and Cal Academy.  By the afternoon, street parking close to the museum was limited.  Museum cafes are a favorite of mine- although the menu is limited and pricey, they usually offer something different.  This time we dined on a salad with salmon and purslane (an edible weed), roasted poussin ( the tiny French cousin of a Costco roasted chicken), Bratwurst and a deli sandwich for about $60.  Order from the menu or pick up a sandwich/salad from the refrigerated case.  \nFood trucks were also parked nearby the Academy. \nA nice way to spend 4 hours...\n\nGood to know:\nIts very chilly here in the mornings- bring a jacket.\nPark entrance is free, street parking is free.\nThere was no fee for all the places we visited, but most others charge admission.

After copping a 16 hour flight from Melbourne, we checked into our hotel; freshened ourselves up and made our way to Golden Gate Park. We thought we'd walk on Haight St and check out the shops first (it's along the way so it'll be alright!) - bad move soldier! We'd taken the train (in our defence, we were told to do this by hotel reception so... not entirely our fault!) which got us to 16th Mission I think so we walked for ages before even getting to Haight-Ashbury! \n\nBy the time we got there; we were exhausted and it was about 5 in the arvo as well so of course, we wouldn't have been able to see all of it - not a chance!\n\nAnyways...

However, this wonderful spot of natural greenery has its own claim to fame as one of the main places to visit in SF.  \n\nIn terms of the general layout, the actual park consists of an amphitheater at one end, a stretch of trees and fountains in the middle culminating in a statue at the other, encircled by a road for bikes and pedestrians.  On a good day you'll see plenty of tourists, skateboarders, seagulls, and tandem bicyclers.  Facing each other across the park is the Academy of Sciences musem and de Young Art museum, each of which I would recommend highly and could take up a day or more.  Behind the amphitheater is the bike rental place, and the four person bike I rented with my friends was largely serviceable but had a few glitches.  Lots of fun exploring the nearby trails.\n\nMultiple flower gardens exist nearby, from the Japanese Tea garden (which costs money to enter and is to some degree worth it) to the Native Plants area to the Conservatory.  \n\nThe Golden Gate park also borders the Sunset district where a great selection of restaurants can be found, including Ebisu which is one of my favorites.\n\nParking is wherever you can find a spot on the street which can be kind of a hassle so practice your parallel parking skills.

But I can't get enough of this place. After ALL these years, Golden Gate Park still has that magic it had for me as a child. There was a period of time where my mom and dad took me here almost every day for the first 3-4 years of my life. \n\nAt Stow Lake, I had my duck, seagull, pigeon, and cootie friends (eww, who has cooties? lol). I got to be fearless captain of a boat and lead a rampage across the high seas (of a lake). I had my very own special treehouse that I climbed. Years later I observed that the treehouse was not more than a 2 foot incline. I must have been REALLY small when I claimed the treehouse as my fort! In the last couple years, a bad storm took down my solid fortress and left us with just a dash of trunk. I was sad.\n\nThe magic continued at the *original* California Academy of Science. I can't even remember its previous name. My dad took me to visit every Tuesday! I loved going with him to look at all the various aquarium tanks which were much more spread out, the endless taxonomy (stuffed animal) exhibits that were designed as snapshots from the real world of nature and history, the dinosaur land which was a dream come true because we could climb on the rocks with the moving dinosaur models and it felt so real. And finally there was the planetarium, which didn't require call times and waiting in line. The pendulum blew my mind, how it would change \"orbit\" just so slightly and continue to adjust until it made a complete circle. Even though I went on at least 10 school field trips here, I never tired of it.\n\nThen there were the Golden Gate Park Stables. These are no longer there, but I feel I must pay a tribute. I spent hours at this topnotch English riding academy every weekend and at summer camps. I helped out at camps for younger kids so I could get more riding lessons. There were amazing horseback rides that forged through the park to Ocean Beach. Beach rides are still relaxing and invigorating. My sense of smell adapted so that after awhile I couldn't tell that horses stank. Years later, I find myself becoming surprised when I can actually detect the smell of horses.\n\nAnd I can't leave out the Japanese Tea Garden, Botannical Garden, and Conservatory of Flowers. All contributing to the stunning beauty of Golden Gate Park. It's impressive that a park that was 100% manmade is so gorgeous and can bring so many people peace and inspiration.\n\nThank you for all the memories, Golden Gate Park!

You can either spend money by visiting places like the deYoung Museum, the Japanese Tea Garden (which is AMAZING), the Academy of Sciences, and more!  Or you can pay NOTHING and spend time walking through the gorgeous, expansive areas, fly kites (which we did!), have a picnic, or do some people watching (we happened upon a group of locals who were rollerskating and dancing to all kinds of disco, dance, and hip hop - too cool!).  There is a baseball field, an outdoor stage, an AIDS memorial, bike paths, etc!!  So much to do here whether you want to relax, be active, or take in the sights.  \n\nThis is easily a place you could spend an entire day - or weekend!  We unfortunately only had a few hours, but I had an amazing time here and I wish that we had had the chance to really dive deep into this park.   I am also bummed out that I missed the bison range!  Bison?  In the park?  Seriously will need to check this out on my next visit.  I love bison.\n\nIf I lived near here, I would come to this park every single day.  Unfortunately, Seattle is a little too far away..... :(", "author": "Sonya L."}

Sundays, when it is closed to traffic, feels like your own private garden.

However, when it's unusually sunny and warn in the city, it's nice to know that work people DO let you go outside to enjoy it.\n\nAfter several trips to this fine city, I've discovered that there are certain neighborhoods that are consistently warm and sunny, while others are generally shady and cool. Golden Gate Park is probably somewhere in the middle. It was very sunny the other day, but also significantly colder than it was in the Mission. Considering the size of San Francisco, this is a little bit odd, but nothing that would keep me away from the park. Also, it was very cool to watch the fog roll into the park at around 5 pm... we don't see stuff like that in the Midwest!\n\nWould love to come back and have a picnic or play Frisbee with friends, as this is a local gem for sure! Golden Gate Park - I'll be back!", "author": "Abby S."}

The view is absolutely picture perfect. \n\nMy friends and I have only touched on a little part of the whole area this past weekend.

Everything seems very well taken care of, and it was not at all trashy and polluted to my surprise. \n\nWe got to roll down the beautiful grassy hills together and raced across the field to the multicolored flower bush. It just felt so nice to be a kid again, even if it's just for a while. \n\nDid I mention it doesn't cost a thing?! Yeah. I know right.

The different species and collections are really cool. You'd never expect to see such a great canopy collected in one area of SF, but its really awesome to walk under. I really loved all of the paths we found through the far end of the park we were in. It was absolutely gorgeous.

They have food vendors on the path for the perfect bite on the go. Along with all the nature to look at you can also visit a variety of attractions that happen to be in the park.

Golden Gate Park is among San Francisco's beauty and treasure, with lush and diverse selections of plants. We even found some bamboos at some point of the park! \n\nThe park is suited for many occasions: biking, outdoor sports, picnics, bbq, dates, photography, site seeing, ghost hunting, exploring, and much more! Yes and I have done all of the above. hehe\n\nUrban Legend(s): There are two urban legends I know of for this park. One would be the lady who haunts Stowe Lake. She drowned her own baby and committed suicide there and now she haunts the park looking for her child. There's a statue with a lady holding two kids, some say if you gaze into the lady's eyes, she will move! There are different versions to the story but this is the one I heard. \n\nThe other urban legend would be the phantom police car. Many cars have been followed by a police car but once they are about to leave the park, the car disappears. \n\nIf you do decide to come here at night to explore, ghost hunt, or whatever, just be very careful. There are some creeps at night, my friends and I have experienced first hand one time. Luckily everyone was safe due to our strength in numbers. \n\nIf you explore Golden Gate Park, you will also find some unique sites, such as the museums, man made water falls, statues, interesting architecture, and more.

If you go to the De Young museum you can go to the top of the tower and get absolutely beautiful views of the surrounding landscapes and city views. It was a wonderful area to walk around and explore. Between the De Young museum and California Academy of Science is the Music Concourse, it is stunning architecture. The day I went there, they had food trucks behind the concourse, I don't know if they do this regularly or just the day, but it was pretty cool. Also, they had a Twirl and Dip truck nearby, the ice cream was pretty good, check out my review of the truck if you want to know more.

We parked less than 100 yards from the California Academy of Sciences yesterday and had any items of value out of sight and covered. When we returned to our vehicle 45 minutes later, the passenger door window had been broken out and items had been stolen. Even worse, we were 1 of 3 vehicles that had been broken into in a very short period of time! Closer inspection of Nancy Pelosi Drive revealed many piles of broken safety glass on the ground next to the road. A museum employee/volunteer walked by, shook his head and said, \"I'm sorry; it happens all the time!\" If this is such a well-known problem, why are there not more frequent patrols of the area? Why are no signs posted warning visitors of the danger? When we called the police to report the crime, we were told that a car wouldn't be dispatched and there would be no investigation because there was no homicide! What? We even visited the local police precinct office where we were told that even if we could trace any of our stolen items (ourselves, of course!), all the police could do would be to go to the address and ask if anyone there had our items (whatever happened to reasonable cause?) While we were there, another policeman came in whose garage had been burglarized. He told us that even if the perpetrator is caught, getting a DA to pursue the case is next to impossible. Moral of the story -- don't park on the streets of Golden Gate Park unless you are willing for items (especially electronics and jewelry) to be stolen and receive no help in their recovery", "author": "James F."}

I did not miss a game at Kezar Stadium (1965 -1970) in the park when the San Francisco 49ers played there. Does anyone remember getting a free ticket by clipping off a coupon from a Christopher Milk carton? I also learned how to play golf at the Golden Gate Park Golf Course. It was also cool to see the Jefferson Starship and the Grateful Dead perform together for free at Lindley Meadows in 1975. Worked at the Boathouse at Stow Lake and learned how to cast for fishing in the park. The California Academy of Sciences admission was free up to the early 70's and remember the alligators not moving for hours with coins on top of them. A good way to protect money. \n\nOn Saturdays, immigrant men from Greece (including both of my grandfathers or papou in Greek) used to play Pinochle (and gamble!) in the park to escape from their wives for a few hours near Hippie Hill. The hippies chased most of them out in the late 60's. The hippies moved on to be \"The Establishment\" today.  Kezar Stadium was demolished and replaced with less seats for football and track meets.\n\nI still enjoy buying popcorn at the Boathouse at Stow Lake and feeding the ducks. The island on the lake is called Strawberry Hill and offers great views of \"The City\" at the top.\n\nBig Rec, near Seventh Ave. and Lincoln Way, has two full sized baseball fields and had indoor/outdoor racquetball courts. I used to play handball there which is similar, but gloves were used instead of racquets.\n\nI had a secret way to get into the park at 15th Ave. and Lincoln Way where a gate was installed but not locked. The Botanical Garden is located inside the fence and offered fast access to the Japanese Tea Garden, de Young Museum, and the rest of park. \n\nI recently suffered a medical condition and was told by the doctor to walk at least a mile a day. I started my rehab by walking around Stow Lake which brought back memories.

This loser!\n\nIt's my 300th review and while I could share my razor sharp insights regarding my local drugstore or mall, it's nice to occasionally branch out and review something different and more...wholesome.\n\nMy first experience was around 6 years ago when I ditched a course in DC for the weekend to go visit my little sister in San Francisco. A picnic in Golden Gate Park was kind of one of the highlights! We weren't dining on caviar (gross) and champagne, but I felt like I kind of belonged in the city. We chatted and lounged on the grass near some water, just watching the world go by. It was joyful.\n\nFast forward a few years and I'm back to SF but this time for the little (grown up!) sister's wedding. We were staying in an apartment in the Richmond by the park and she was getting married there.\n\nYou'd think that it was kind of risky to go back. Things are never as wonderful as you painted them in your memory. Except GGP. It's an oasis in the city. I ran there every morning and it was just blissful. I really felt like I was miles away from everyone else. You get to hear the birds, run on trails, explore new areas, run around lakes, smell the flowers. I ran further than usual just because I was actually enjoying what I was seeing!\n\nIt's ridiculous how much there is to do too in a way. The carousel, the de Young, Science Museum, Japanese  Tea Garden, Botanical Gardens...days of activities. Or just do nothing. Sit on the grass and make daisy chains. Stare at a lake or fountain. Watch people do an exercise class while you luxuriate. \n\nThe little one got married in Fuchsia Dell. It's not the manicured wedding venue some would go for and was therefore perfect. It was pretty, natural, a little bit private and extremely special. GGP will forever hold a special place in my heart because of that day, and also because of the peace I felt each time I entered through the gates.\n\nTips:\nIt's easy to get lost if you don't head straight across using the cross roads. I did a lot of running in the wrong direction!\nAs we discovered on the day of the wedding, it can be very very difficult to get parking inside the park on a Saturday.

First there's the places you must pay admission to visit, The deYoung Museum, Japanese Tea Gardens, California Academy of Sciences and Conservatory of Flowers, among others. Some of them worth the price of admission, (Japanese Tea Gardens) to others that aren't exactly worth the full admission price. Especially when they often offer deals for certain days.\n\nThe real beauty of Golden Gate Park is when you drive into it's serene wooded entrance (or walk if that's your thing), it feels like you're instantly transported from the hussle 'n bussle of The City. It's an oasis within my favorite city in the country. If I were an SF resident, I could easily find a way to waste many a day here.\n\nGolden Gate Park is especially memorable for me since it's the place I spent my first date with my great love. Exactly one year ago today, on 05/31/12 she changed my life with this one singular day in the park. We went from being friends to something much more meaningful, and everlasting. Just laying there on a blanket talking and holding each other is a moment I will never forget. I wish we had brought a picnic because we spent nearly the entire day there. Although this wasn't the original plan, it just worked out to be that way, losing track of time in each others arms. It shows you how easily you can spend an entire day here, yet not even notice the time flying by.\n\nIf you ever have the chance, do visit during the pre-daylight hours. The place is eerily quiet with a Silent Hill type fog rolling through. Now I see why the majority of the bums in SF like to call this place \"home\". After spending yet another day in the park with the woman of my dreams, I returned extremely early the next morning. I thought she had lost her watch here while we were horsing around. I couldn't sleep while thinking about it and the fact it might be my fault. I woke up early, hopped in the car, and drove back here to look for it. When I arrived around 5am it was quiet and beautiful. There were very few people out except for a cyclist and a runner or two. I didn't find what I came here for but I found a new appreciation that I would drive 45 mins away to look for something for someone only because I knew how much it meant to them. It was a small price to pay for the chance to put a smile on her beautiful face. Even with the scant chance I might find it in the dark while wandering around with a flashlight. In the end, I found the watch a few months later behind the bed when I was cleaning. I still laugh when I visualize it hiding there the whole time. I'm still, happy I drove here as I was able to see the park, as well as myself & my babygirl in a whole new light.\n\nWe'll be back here soon as the park holds several great memories for us.

Unfortunately, we didn't read the fine print.  It's closed off only in one tiny section of the park.   And the rest of the park contains highways.  Yes, locals use it to cut through to other streets.  \n\nBikes are not welcome on the sidewalks.  Bike lanes are not provided.  Cars are parked on either side of some streets, allowing for narrow to no shoulders.  Cars are driving by at 55 mph.  How exactly is this park bike-friendly?   \n\nThe park itself does have some interesting places to visit -- museums, a flower conservatory, etc. which we didn't get to.  I loved the tranquility of the AIDS Memorial Park.  The park also provides access to the Pacific Ocean where you can (once you cross the busy street), ride your bike along a path next to the beach area.  \n\nI guess I was picturing something totally different from what I read about in the guidebooks, though, and that was a put-off.  I pictured something along the line of Central Park in NYC that's totally blocked off to traffic where bikers can ride safely throughout the entire park.  I didn't enjoy dodging cars and white-knuckling it.  I probably wouldn't rent bikes here again, but I would check out the other areas of the park that I missed.", "author": "Eric K."}

Stepped into BART, got off at Glen Park and took the bus up the Park. \n\nThis adventure happened on what any Las Vegan would expect to be a typical 100 degree July day but first-timers, beware, San Francisco summer is equivalent to wintertime in Vegas so bundle up. I went up there with a jacket on and two thinner layers beneath it. Fog blanketed our uphill journey by bus and visibility was low. Rain began to drizzle and temperatures plummeted down even further. I asked around for directions and this one lady on the bus pointed where the bike rentals were on my map.\n\nBy the time I got there, it was already 5pm and the rental place told me that they stopped their service at 5:30pm. So instead of going back, I explored the park on foot. The California Academy of Science and the de Young Museum were already closed and the fog was so low, I could hardly see the street signs. Therefore, I had to make use of whatever was in my hands to navigate my way through the park. The Botanical Gardens were also closed but one attraction remained open, and I'm glad it did - The Japanese Tea Garden.\n\nPeaceful zen and all too familiar beautiful Asian scenery kept me in the Gardens for nearly an hour. Bonsai trees were delicately shaped, koi fish swam alongside the well-trimmed trees, pagodas stood tall and rock bridges connected pavements through the ponds. For $7, I would go back again. Sure I didn't see any birds that day nor did I get to check out the museums but simple things like feeding squirrels and making wishes with pennies made this trip worth it.", "author": "Kirstie M."}

It's nice to see people jogging early in the morning and families picnicing and playing games.  Dogs are out on walks, prancing about happily.

They're roaming around, and eating grass without a care in the world. Head out to Ocean Beach and you'll see those giant windmills facing the Pacific Ocean. They have been weathered through time and their glory days are behind them, but don't let that full you. Underneath that one windmill is the Tulip Garden. When in full bloom, it is a sight to behold. \n\nThere's plenty of places to play a catch of football, baseball, frisbee or let your dog play a game of fetch. Hey, I even played flag football with a bunch of Yelpers a couple of months ago. (I played with the East Bay team; go figure?) If archery is your thing, they have that too. This is also home to the famous Conservatory of Flowers. If you're a tourist, you've probably picked up postcards of that place. \n\nI haven't even gotten to the best places yet.

This huge and gorgeous green space is clearly the place for picnics and frolics, weather permitting, and is utterly vast comparatively to the size of the parks in the UK. It's a clear and obvious choice for a romantic stroll, healthy jog, little amble with a dog and as I perambulated to the work picnic I was attending whilst out here I was instantly jealous that for all the Yorkshire greenery we don't have one of these. (Of course, one brief trip to Otley Chevin once home and I was satiated!)\n\nI think the thing I was most jealous of was the eerie mist. Akin to the vibe of a Hitchcock thriller, the most glorious mist flowed in from what seemed to be inland, and in less than sixty seconds the tendrils curled over the tree tops creating a new and almost tangible sky. I'm not sure there's a word for this yet, and I'm a word-geek so I have looked, but it was one of those situations where somehow real life reminded you of a film, or a painting. It's sort of \"life imitates art\", only trees and skies and other such things to my knowledge don't act but simply are.\n\nStrange how real life and real experience can bring about a de ja vu for something stuck in time, like media.

Sure there are tons of houses along the park, but in many areas the park isn't very easy to access directly from the street.  They should have a clear entrance every block or two at minimum.

We only made it a quarter of the way through and that was only in a straight line - we missed a ton of stuff on the way.\n\nWe walked through (one of the many) entrances and were surrounded by bums everywhere. I kind of regretted that we were going to spend our last day in San Fran hanging out with bums who somehow had a ton of weed. (The amounts could have rivaled a frat party.) But as we walked further and the weather got nicer, the bums seemed to dissipate. \n\nI wanted to go to the Japanese garden which was our first stop. It's free on certain days of the week but of course not on the day that we went. $7 per person. Cash. Exact change requested. It was a cool little garden - fairly small but fun. Go on a free day though. \n\nWe then walked around one of the lakes which was a beautiful walk. We saw sketchy people hiding behind bushes...probably wouldn't be super safe to go alone here at dark...but who would do that anyway?\n\nAfter the lake, we also hit up the California Academy of Sciences - check out my review! \n\nCool park - a must see while in San Fran. \n\nOh, and there's a shuttle that's $2 per person...you can cruise around to a dozen of stops around the park.

I used to poo-poo it and cross the bridge to Marin for outdoor recreation at every available opportunity. But right here in River City, right in my own backyard, there is plenty of recreating to be had.\n\nOld timers say that GGP used to be manicured within an inch of it's life, every bit of it. Poking around under the overgrowth, you'll find a lot of \"water features\" that have ceased to be. The stables are crumbling and the horses moved out except for a few police horses, who live across from the bison. \n\nMuch of it is pretty scruffy, with a bare bones gardening staff trying to keep up. Old timers also have their own names for places in the park, so if a native is directing you, feggitaboutit. There seems to be some sparkling new signage for roads and places so navigation may get a bit easier. \n\nA lot of people live in the park. Some of them are very nice, and have done things for me like return a lost cell phone. Some of them are not so nice and have a menacing air about them and leave a lot of garbage behind. There are feral cats and the odd coyote, hence the lack of bunnies and other smaller critters. \n\nThanks to my part-time pooch Roxy the Wonder Dog I am often in the park at daybreak and dusk, and I can't think of a better place to be. Out here in the fields, you can see the stars at night too, unlike center city. People who live in other neighborhoods are convinced that it is always foggy and cold here. We hope those thoughts keep you warm and in bed and out of our way.\n\nEvery year Michael Franti has a day long Power to the Peaceful concert in Speedway Meadow, and Warren Hellman hosts a multi-day extravaganza called Hardly Strictly Bluegrass and god  I love that man for this incredible free gift.

I came here with some friends last weekend; we took the train from South Bay and took the lightrail (N Judah) from the station to the park. It's only 2 blocks away from the last stop. You can even walk to the beach if you want to.\n\nI saw something about the free shuttle online...when we got the park we weren't sure where to go. We were by the Murphy Windmill, so we decided to walk along Lincoln to get to the visitors center/the Beach Chalet Restaurant. The guy at the front told us the shuttle would go to the parking lot by the beach (other side of the street). The shuttle runs every 15-20 minutes, but we got lucky and flagged down the shuttle just as it was going through the parking lot. We asked the driver to stop at the Rose Garden for us to get off...it doesn't seem like the shuttle has any pre-determined stops. This is kind of odd because it would be nice if people could count on the shuttle to stop for them to get back on after walking around a certain area...the park is huge so you don't want to walk the whole thing. The shuttle is a good idea though, I hope they keep it around.\n\nWe walked through the Rose Garden, which was beautiful. Then we walked over to the Japanese Tea Garden...alas, you have to pay to go in. We skipped it. There was a bride and groom taking pictures outside...it's a nice and serene area. We walked around the area surrounding the CA Academy of Sciences...you're surrounded by nature and statues of philosophers. We stumbled upon the Twirl and Dip soft serve ice cream truck too! It was a really nice day out, so there were quite a few people in line.\n\nNext time, I would drive to the park to spend the whole day there. It doesn't look too difficult to find parking in the park itself. This way you can get out, have a picnic, walk around, and go to the other end of the park easily.

There's a lot of wildlife in Golden Gate Park.  When I was there I encountered raccoons, squirrels, fish, ducks, and various other species of birds.

I've been going to this park ever since I was a little kid and til now this place never gets boring. There is so much to do in this park that it takes at least two days to get through the whole park. Today was my first time going on the sightseeing tour bus and I love it. Its worth every penny because they take you around San Francisco and you can hop on and hop off whenever you want to. They have certain stop points and the next bus would come back every 20 minutes to pick you up to the next destination. The tour usually takes about 2 hours if you don't get off at any stop. Quick tip that I learned today is that if you want the bus to take you through the Golden Gate Bridge you would have to go before 3pm because after 3pm it hits traffic so instead it'll drive by it. If you're looking to just roaming around SF and nothing else in specific, riding the tour bus is definitely something you should do!", "author": "Maii H."}

We got to see what she meant, a squirrel would slowly approach her dog and right when the dog would try to catch it, the squirrel would run up a tree.\n\nAs we were leaving we saw a festival for Holland, so we stopped and checked that out (it was located next to the archery field, which was also awesome.

It's funny that I've been to the Fisherman's Wharf, Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz, but I didn't get a really solid San Fran vibe until I stepped into this park.\n\nKeep in mind that you have to spend a few extra bucks to get into the museums or the Japanese Tea Garden.  Don't fret though; the park itself provides enough free sights and sounds for you to enjoy.  \n\nIf you go into the De Young museum, go into the elevator on the far right side and go up to the top floor.  There you'll find a tiny gift shop and a 360 panoramic view of the park.  I highly recommend this for photos and just to get a feel for everything.\n\nNearby the California Academy of Sciences, you'll see a bunch of artists outside with their work trying to sell their wares.  It was pretty neat checking out the different artwork and having conversations with the artists themselves.\n\nI would also recommend walking around Stow Lake.  The long leisurely stroll leads you a beautiful waterfall, a small dock where you can rent rowboats/paddle boats, and benches where you can sit and chill for a while.

We arrived early at 11.00 am so we can get a spot Kezar drive. It was challenging to bike to JFK drive with my 8-yrs old daughter since traffic is heavy on holiday.\n2. Once we reached JFK dr, it was so fun sharing the road with other cyclist, runner, family on 4-wheeler bike and road bladder.\n3. You can get to de Young on the bike from JFK and explore the museum and Cal Academy of Science. Please remember to bring a bike lock so you can secure your bike. We stop to enjoy the Musical band this time but will come again for CAS.\n4. Along the route, we stop at Rose Garden, the skate park, Water fall and even Stow Lake.\n5. We have to continue on JFK to see the Bison and traffic is very heavy plus there are many drivers who double park to drop passengers and goods which make the road not safe for kids. Google maps indicated that it is Bicycle safe road but not with cars rushing to get parking spots and opening doors without checking for other road users.  Not a good experience here.\n6. No bicycle allowed on pavement because there are pedestrians and family with strollers. We decided to use the \"bike\" trail to return back to JFK drive and have to avoid dogs which is safe than cars.\n7. We stop at the Conservatory of Flowers on the way back and it was educational and interesting.\n\nOverall, it is great park for family and we highly recommend JFK drive on Sunday when it is closed to traffic.

For example, every time I meticulously map out a run in the park, I get lost. It's partly because crossroads are almost never labeled (although the online maps on sites like myfavoriterun give names for the smallest dirt paths). It's also because, as I'm convinced, Golden Gate Park is magic. Whatever I do, I can't predict or replicate runs here. One moment I'm running along, convinced I know where I'm going, and suddenly I find myself surrounded by bison, or in the middle of the polo fields, or in the midst of tunic-clad yeomen clanging swords or shooting arrows. See? Magic.\n\nBeyond running, there's something for everyone at Golden Gate Park: the DeYoung, Academy of Sciences, Japanese Tea Garden (one of my favorite places), Prayer brook Cross (?), the conservatory of flowers. \n\nSo despite my regular frustration here, this place is great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-04", "description": "There are some people/places/things in the world that consistently deliver, that always make you happier than you were before, that give you reason to care.\n\nGolden Gate Park is one of those places for me.  I think that when you find something that adds a little more magic or calm or *insert anything positive* into your life, you have to go with it and get as much out of it as you can.  \n\nSo, Golden Gate Park.  Here's my story, written as part-advice, part-autobiography of a San Francisco native.  \n\n+ Botanical Gardens.  On Saturdays when we were little, my sister and I used to go with my grandma to feed the ducks and the squirrels here.  From the Inner Richmond, you walk through the Rose Garden, cross John F. Kennedy drive, go up the hill, past some Cherry Blossoms, and you're there.  We brought the ends of bread loaves and packs of peanuts for the animals.  The ducks, pigeons, and seagulls would swarm around us, and then a few minutes in, would all fly away together, in a frantic rush, only to return a minute later, ready to eat more.  The squirrels, they come right up to you and take the peanuts out of your hands.  If you're a little girl, stuff like that is thrilling, enough to make you squeal.  My suggestion: Go with your family or friends, bring some food, and sit on a bench feeding the animals.  Life moves slower for a while, and it feels right.\n\n+ CA Academy of Sciences: On Friday afternoons, my dad and I used to rush from my Kumon classes over to the California Academy of Sciences to catch the last half hour of the museum, which was open for free during those 30 minutes.  I had a mortifying moment once, when we were at the tide pool area, and my dad was pointing out to the white woman next to us all the different animals sitting in there that we Chinese people like to eat.  \"That's a sea cucumber.  It tastes really good in black bean sauce.\"  The Academy is much different now, but here's my advice: Bring your kid to it often.  Curiosity is something that people lose as they get older, so make sure that you stimulate your child's curious heart with as much life and science and animals and wonderful things as you possibly can, and maybe when they're 23 years old, they'll also write about their childhood memories at the museum.\n\n+ Sunday in the Park: On Sundays, a lot of John F. Kennedy Drive is closed to traffic so that families can bike, walk, roller-blade in the park, without worrying about traffic.  We used to roller-blade and bike in the park, getting our exercise and catching the folks doing Lindy Hop on the bridge or roller-skating and dancing by that area near 6th and Fulton.  It's good for people watching, taking in some sun (at least 15 minutes of sun a day is required to produce enough Vitamin D!), and getting some fresh air.  Here's my advice:  If you're near, make it a habit to come out to GG Park on Sundays to either get your exercise (it's a good place to run), or to just relax and walk around people-watching.  The people in this city are interesting, you'll never get bored watching. \n\n+ Conservatory of Flowers:  The building is beautiful, and it's a greenhouse in a city.  How awesome is that?  But even more awesome than the building and its contents is the area outside of it.  My advice:  This is a good place to walk around with older people.  Take a Sunday and bring your grandparents here, let them walk around all the flowers.  You'll enjoy each other's company while walking around leisurely.  Life moves too fast, take it slow, walk with grandma.  Also, if you have kid sisters or brothers, or one of your own, the grassy hills across from the conservatory are perfect for rolling and tumbling down.  It's good, simple fun.\n\n+ The Bison: Because where else in the city or anywhere in the state, really, can you find random bison roaming around.  I generally jog or bike around here every now and then.  Advice: If you're biking past, just take a minute to look at it, laugh, and then move on.  It's nice to have that brief  \"hehehe\" moment in any day.  Then continue on your journey towards that little windmill and the ocean.  \n\n+ Other worthwhile things to see: Polo Fields, Stow Lake, paddle-boating, the DeYoung Museum.\n\nFinal word: You can't really complain about a place that's free, fun, friendly, family-oriented.  \n\nI think it's fantastic.  Golden Gate Park, thank you.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Both have great exhibits and can appeal to anybody, really. Also, in that same vicinity is the Japanese Tea Garden, which is one of my favorite places. The garden architectural landscape is amazing, and there are many paths to wander and enjoy. Also, they have a Japanese tea house where you can buy snacks and tea while looking out over the beautiful view.\nYou really can't go wrong here. Definitely worth it for a tourist, but really appeals to the non-tourist as well. Highly recommended.", "author": "Azinda M."}

The purpose was to showcase San Francisco's mild winters and state's abundance.\n\nAfter 110 years later, Golden Gate Park is nowhere what it once was. The City-owned park is still the most beautiful park in the planet. The city needs to eliminate the homeless hiding and sleeping in the bushes.\n\nMatt and wifey took advantage of the Sunday road-closure and ride our bikes in the park, on our way toward Ocean Beach. The closure of the park is an excellent idea for those who come and ride your bike, jog, roller-blade, or sashay your metrosexual self in the park; but can be a nightmare for nearby residents, who faces traffic along Lincoln Blvd. Matt loves the idea of the closure of GGP on Sundays and hoping to take more advantage of it.", "author": "Matt G."}

Continuing on, you'll approach Spreckels Lake where you can either turn left into the stadium area or go straight. Here's where the bison hang out. Yes, you read correctly.

And if you're looking to have a bit of fun on the water, there's paddleboats for you to rent as well. \n\nOther GG Park treats... the Conservatory of Flowers (w/ a dahlia garden to the right of it), the Botanical Gardens (you get free admission if you're an sf resident! w/ such small crowds, it's like your own private park), the small bison paddock, the charming windmill, Spreckels Lake (where people race their remote control mini boats), the frisbee golf course, the De Young & Academy of Science museums (my favorite sf museums), and Kezar Stadium (perfect for doing stair workouts). \n\nI really feel like I've fallen in love w/ this park over the last few months and have found a new appreciation for it.

Some of my favorites include singing opera with my friends during the annual Opera in the Park celebration, running through during Bay to Breakers, assembling at the Windmill with other runners during marathon training, and every single visit I've made to the deYoung museum.\r\n\r\nSafely tucked away inside this inner-city oasis you'll find the Shakespeare Garden, bison grazing and plenty of space for picnics and BBQ's. On Sundays, a big stretch of the park is closed to cars and that's when you'll find parents teaching their kids to ride bikes, folks dancing on roller skates, runners, cyclists, skate boarders - there are even swing dancing lessons at 12:30!\r\n\r\nWe San Franciscans are truly lucky to have Golden Gate Park in our fair city.", "author": "Miriam W."}

The Academy of Sciences is here too. The one big drawback for me though is feeling unsafe when walking from the outer edges of the park toward the populated areas. Last spring I walked to GGPark from Union Square. I saw a trail at the beginning of the park and figured I would take it instead of walking down the road to the garden areas. 5 mins into the walk this mentally unstable man walked up and starting gibbering about something or other. He was the size of a twig so I wasn't really that worried - I was basically ready to pounce if needed - but he was so out of it I was wondering what craziness he was pondering. After that I kept walking and saw a lot of packs of homeless people hanging out on the trail. That's when I decided to go back and walk on the street to the main entrances.", "author": "Isabella L."}

The glorious weather made me want to really take Little Red out for a long drive - she's endured many patient hours waiting for me in cold lonely airport parking lots and I knew she'd love the chance to show me her German heritage on the wide open 880 freeway (it's true, there was hardly any traffic!!!)\n\nSo, off we went - thinking - hmmm, let's go up to the San Mateo bridge and cross over to the Peninsula and go to Costco in Mountain View!  Little Red would have none of it and soon, we were breezing past the Colisseum (Boo! Raiders!!) and approaching what appeared to be a hearty lunch in Berkeley.  Again, Little Red said no and on 580 we stayed, past the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and into Marin county, past San Quentin and onto the 101 where I had been only yesterday on my way to Santa Rosa with the guys!\n\nLittle Red now led me southbound on the 101 and I knew she wanted to see the Golden Gate Bridge - ah, ha, tricky little thing...  I've always been a sucker for these flashy German types in flashy red garb - today was no exception!\n\nExit Sausalito and a nice little drive to the foot of the GG Bridge and an exhilarating view of the city across the Bay!  Little Red was purring with excitement - and curses!  I did not have my customary camera so had to make do with the weak-a$$ iPhone camera to capture the moment!\n\nThen drove across the GG Bridge into the city and decided to go to GG Park.  I've never been here before and after Central Park last week, I was eager to see what San Francisco had to offer.\n\nGolden Gate Park is a real gem!  I need to spend more time here but I drove through the park, past the Japanese Tea Garden (how beautiful...  can't wait to go back and see it up close), the baseball and soccer fields teeming with kids of all ages and all the way up to the Dutch windmill.  Then, I drove back to the picnic area and spent about 2 hours on the grass, making myself a sandwich out of some good crusty bread and interesting cheeses I had picked up earlier in Mill Valley before crossing over.  And, shhhh, a nice, not-so-chilled Pinot Grigio...  ahhh, a perfect spring afternoon.  I was kind of impressed that I actually had a blanket in the trunk of my car (no doubt a result of some drunken evening with the SBC) so I was able to make quite a decent picnic out of it.\n\nI can't wait to get back!  Fantastic afternoon - great weather - I'm happy that we have something here to compete against Central Park (which is still very near and dear to my heart :)\n\nImpromptu outings like this rock - it makes for that much more fun since things just unfold as they happen - and you go with the flow.  A simple lunch, good wine, fabulous weather, a short nap and I was off, back home to the South Bay.\n\n5 stars to the park for making this day perfect - it was the almost perfect finish to an already awesome day.

I really tried my hardest to not detour and go into the botanical gardens because I knew that once I'm inside, it'd probably take all day just to find my way out (it happened once already)! As I was walking north on MLK Jr Dr. I made a slight left onto South Dr. Lots of greenery to stare at and some plants and trees had tags on them with their names. I won't lie. I picked some flowers and lavenders along the way and pressed them in my hardcover book, The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch. haha :P I saw bits of the de Young Museum and the Japanese Tea Garden, lakes, giant trees, people jogging, and lots of cars driving on the roads too! \n\n10:10am: 20 minutes later I got to 19th Ave (Crossover Dr.) and crossed the street to continue on my journey towards the volunteer area that was southwest part of the park. I would stop every now and then to stare at the green grass and clovers! I was in search for a 4-leaf clover! I was determined! I think the walkers/joggers must have thought I lost something in the grass because I was scanning the ground and concentrating so hard to find the unique clover. \"Oh, is that a 4-leaf? Aw, nope. Only 3...\" =\\ I continued to look at nature as I passed by Elk Glen Lake. Walking westward on South Dr/MLK Jr Dr, I just happened to find a 4-leaf clover!! I couldn't believe it! haha That made my day! Patience is definitely a virtue! \n\n11:30am: I passed by Sunset Blvd and Chain of Lakes Dr. By the time I got close to my volunteer meeting spot I still had half an hour to kill. The road forked. So I decided to go towards Kennedy Dr. It was kinda creepy walking by myself cause on the left there were these abandoned buildings with graffiti. I totally thought someone was going to jump out of the bushes and strangle me. But the area was woodsy. Just before you get to the paved parking lot and sports field, you will see this nice bed of clovers! You could hear the faint sound of the ocean in the background as you stare out! I felt really relaxed and quiet. I almost felt at peace. Forgetting about the chaotic world outside and not thinking about the problems.\n\n11:50am: I headed back to MLK Jr Dr and right when I walked out onto the road a volunteer coordinator saw me and asked me if I was one of the volunteers. haha Dang, that was quick! They found me too soon!\n\nGolden Gate Park is a lovely park to have some \"Me Time\" or get some exercise. In the spring time go to the windmill and see the tulips in bloom! Visit the de Young Museum and Cal Academy of Sciences! Lots of nature to see! Take a deep breath and inhale the nice SF air! sigh... :)\n\nP.S. Don't wear jeans if you do plan to walk more than a mile in the park. Your legs will feel itchy after. =\\ Layer your clothes. It gets chilly in the shady areas of the park and some parts it's really sunny and hot! No flip-flops. Only good walking shoes. Bring some snacks and water along too!! No need for a map if you have the time to get lost! :D Have a little adventure and some fun exploring the park! And find a 4-leaf clover, too!", "author": "CeCe C."}

We were lucky enough to find parking inside the park, and we decided to visit the Conservatory of flowers and the de Young. \n\nThe conservatory wasn't as interesting as I was hoping; we saw a lot of interesting plants, but it was kind of a letdown. Admission fee was somewhat high as well, since we were only in there for about half an hour.\n\nThe de Young Museum was much more interesting, and we were there for almost two hours. The King Tut exhibit looked really cool, but we decided to just get tickets for general admission instead.\n\nThe stroll around the park itself was quite nice, and it was refreshing walking around in the afternoon. Will definitely drop by again for another visit, and perhaps visit the Japanese Tea Garden and some of the other places in the park.", "author": "David L."}

I cannot even be somewhat cool and say that \"I got them when I was a teenager which was (sigh) back in the nineties and I still have them.\" Oh no. They are all of two years old. (I bought them when my endurance running FUBARed my knees). However, I feel like less of a loser after finding another rollerblading Yelper who is also trapped in the nineties. I'll keep him anonymous because he may not be as openly uncool as I am.\n\nBut on Sundays at GGP, you can rollerblade freely with other losers who are also trapped in the nineties. The traffic is blocked off for skating. Be sure to stop and catch the roller dancers. GGP provides great scenery and people watching. It is an easy MUNI transfer from Powell (because we all know I hate driving the stick shift through SF). And if you still think I am a loser for blading in GGP, then I pity you for being ignorant of the free and exhilirating feeling that can you get when you coast through the cool city breeze in this beautiful park.

My trek up to the top of Strawberry Hill was so meditative and enjoyable, it was only fitting to come across one other person up at the top, deep in meditation.

My 11 year-old son and I were playing our version of handball in one of the enclosed courts, the ones with wire mesh over the top to let in air and light.  All of the other courts except the one next to us were vacant.\n\nOur version of handball employs not the regulation small hard ball used by professionals, but the large light plastic ball you can purchase for $1.49 at the 99 Cents and Up Store. (What's with this concept anyway? Aren't all stores 99 cents and up?) Anyway, we take turns hitting the ball with our hand and then running out of the way.  It is great fun and auditorially very satisfying as the ball smacks off one's hand and resounds into the wall. If it is very low against the wall, near the floor, and impossible to return, it is called a \"baby.\" If the ball is high and slow, and sort of dribbles straight down the wall, is is called a \"waterfall.\"\n\nA half hour into our game, two park rangers began rattling the door to get into our court.  We let them in and they told us we had to leave. I asked if someone was waiting to play, or had a reservation, and was informed by the young man ranger that we were violating park regulations by using the court in this way. I explained that we were using our hand and playing with a ball, handball, and that no one else was probably even considering using the courts as it was 89 degrees outside. He said that we weren't playing handball the proper way and had to leave. His ranger companion, an elderly woman who is well-known to dog walkers in that part of the park, stood by the door and said, \"Get out.\" I told her that she didn't need to guard us and that we would leave as soon as my son retrieved his shoes that were in a corner in the far end of the court. She said again, \"Get out.\"\n\nMaybe it was the heat that made her cranky. I don't know. Just make sure you bring a handball handbook with you if you ever decide to visit these crumbling WWII era courts.", "author": "jeff s."}

Though the pedal boats at Stow Lake can get tiring for some people, it can also be very relaxing to make your way around the lake. For those who love flowers and plants, make sure to check out the Conservatory of Flowers, Strybing Arboretum and  Botanical Garden.  Enjoy :-)!\n\n\nGolden Gate Park\nby Celeste L.\n\nG igantic trees and green\nO pen spaces, with\nL ovely flowers, birds and\nD ucks, in ponds and lakes.\nE ven the bisons are\nN ice to see, though should be set free.\n\nG ather your friends\nA nd spend a Sunday afternoon\nT ogether playing baseball or frisbee, and\nE veryone will sure be happy\n\nP eople have plenty to do\nA t this wonderful place, but\nR elaxing is the best or flying a\nK ite with the rest.", "author": "Celeste M."}

Since I'm a SoCal girl, having a HUGE park is something I don't usually see in my natural habitat.  You can walk around and easily get lost appreciating nature or just people/bird watching.  Besides exercise, this is a great photo opportunity too!  We came here on an early weekday afternoon and the weather was cool and brisk, great for a morning jog.  Unfortunately, since I was in vacation mode, exercising is against the rules for any vacation!  Though Irvine's Great Park really wants to be as appealing as this park/NY's Central Park, I still commend the real OGs of parks.", "author": "Janey Y."}

It has quite parts, louder parts, cracked out ghetto parts, beautiful scenic parts, etc. \n\nIf I were to judge the place by the entrance and first part at Haight and Stanyan then I'd probably be giving this place two stars. Seeing washed up ass runaway kids trying to nickel and dime weed sacks and scrounging change together for 40's of 211 got old when I was 15. It's just plain sad now.\n\nOn a much brighter and positive note I've had some awesome times in Golden Gate. Finding a nice open space to kick around a soccer ball with out of town friends, stumbling across a random Malaysian day festival and even spinning drum n bass records on top of hippy hill to lots of stoned folks dancing, these are just some of the many unforgettable experiences I've had at this big beautiful park and I haven't even begun to cover all of the ground in this bad boy!! \n\nThank you Golden Gate Park for being one of the reasons I thank my lucky stars that I get to live in SF.", "author": "Tommy P."}

It's one of the top reasons I moved to the Outer Richmond, and *the* reason I moved across from this park. It's amazing, everything about it - and not just for the dogs. The shear size of it, concerts in the late summer are stunning, walking the park down to Ocean Beach is an experience of pure joy (not just the dog's joy either), the museums are right there... everything.

We will have hopefully brought some cookies, fruits and afternoon munchies with us before we set out on the quest through the epic park to exercise off our breakfast.\n\nThis includes stops at the Windmill, the Bison, a polo or soccer game, the botanical gardens, stow lake, the conservatory of flowers, the japanese tea gardens, etc.\n\nThere are a few things I don't like about golden gate park. I don't like that you cant' find bathrooms, that there is no food aside from beach chalet and the golf course, that boat rentals only go until 4pm, and that the de young museum houses contemporary art (rant to be posted under De Young Museum).\n\nBut despite all these things, it's the perfect place to go with a group of friends and the perfect place to go on a date. You can see the view of everything from the top of strawberry hill, participate in a drum circle, lay in the sunshine, have a japanese tea ceremony and get lost for hours in a park that's in the middle of a city.

Since I can't post twice about the same place, I'm splitting the review into 2. Shakespeare Garden is our wedding ceremony and standing reception venue. After visitng several garden like places, we liked Shakespeare Garden the best. There are plenty of grass.  The space can hold up to 200 people according to Park Services.  There is electricity that you call Park Services a week in advance to turn on.  You can reserve 4 parking spaces in front of the garden for a fee. I think it's $50.  You can have finger foods at this venue just not a full sit down dinner. The rental rate is quite reasonable. It's $500 for 2 hrs and $50 for each additional hours.  Of course, you have to rent your own chairs.  A 10 watt microphone is allowed.  There is public bathroom behind the band shell. The public bathroom is actually quite nice for park bathroom, spacious. It's about a 5min walk from the garden. When you walk into the garden, there is some construction going on in the left, so there is a fence with green tarp.  Not a pretty sight, but there are plenty of space in the garden to take beautiful pictures. There can be more flower planted in the brick area, but overall the garden is well-kept. It has a walk path, so it's set apart for main thourghfare , so pretty private. I'll update my review after our wedding.\n\n\nApril 2007 Fuchsia Dell\nThis review pertains to Fuchsia Dell gardens. It's located a northeast of the Conservatory of Flowers.  I was checking it out as a possible wedding ceremony site.  This is one of the spots that can be rented out in Golden Gate Park for private events/weddings.  It has lots of grass and it's semi-private.  It's definitely more private than the Rose Gardens, which can be rented out as well.  There is a paved path that cuts through Fuchsia Dell from Conservatory East Drive to the Conservatory of Flowers. If you have your wedding on Sundays when JFK drive is closed, this spot might be difficult for your vendors to get to, especially if they are trying to unload chairs.

On the map, the west side of the city was compressed, so the park looked almost like a square near the beach. \n\nMy friends said this was not the case, so I decided to have a look at this \"largest city park in the world.\" I read that it was 4 miles long, and since I was a good boy scout, I decided to take a hike and see the entire thing.\n\nThis was one of the better decisions I have ever made. \n\nI went by my self (essential) and I brought my ipod. I started at the eastern most point, and ventured into this amazing world. I hate to admit coming from LA, but it is important for you all to understand that I had never seen anything like th sights I saw that day. All the different types of people, from the hippy-bongo playing-frizby throwing-dog having loungers to the yuppie picnickers to the runners and walkers and bikers and boarders. I saw people who looked like they spent their entire lives there to people who were on vacation, walking in wonder as I was. \n\nI walked and walked. I hiked up hills and down into wet meadows. I crept through bushes, crossed fences, and ran from bison. I played with dogs and I helped photograph a swan. I daydreamed as I walked, down, down down the road toward the setting sun.\n\nLakes and trees and feelings of prehistoric times. People out like I was enjoying the day. There was real peace that day. I was by myself, in a meditative walk. Exploring inner and outer worlds (I am so cheesy-zen).\n\nWhen I got to the beach, the sun was about to set. I crossed the same PCH as we have in LA, San Diego, and everywhere between here and there. I stood with a bunch of people at the wall, looking out over the water as the sun went down. I was just in time to see a beautiful sunset.\n\nDid you know it turns a shade of light green right before it winks out of sight? It is because the atmosphere blocks certain wavelengths at that angle and we see green.\n\nIt got cold, and I went to get a sandwich at the store.

It is an oasis from the concrete jungle, and full of magical little secrets (as well as some magical people who have an altered view of the universe, but hey, this is a city after all...)\r\n\r\nHere are some of my favorite ways to enjoy GGP:\r\n\r\n1/ Stow Lake \r\nBy some feat of physics, the path around Stow Lake is the EXACT distance that my dog will tolerate on a walk.  See?  Magic.  You can take the outer (safe) path or the inner (view from a desert island) path.  Paddle boats and canoes available for rent.  Crowded on weekends.  If you love birds, there are plenty of ducks etc in close proximity.  If you hate birds, my dog will chase them away for you (that was for you, Kirsten F)\r\n\r\n2/ Toy Boat Boathouse.  \r\nI think that this is the cutest thing I've ever seen.  The lake for sailing toy boats is across the road, and early in the morning there are people who like to practice Tai Chi there.  \r\n\r\n3/ Japanese Tea Garden\r\nI *thought* I gave this a separate review, but apparently I just imagined it!  I love this tranquil spot of manicured trees and exotic plants, with the little tea garden in the middle.  Sure, the gift shop is a bit touristy, but go for the ambiance.  The bridge near the front entrance is a climbing challenge and makes a great photo.  My favorite image is the deer in the bushes, at the very back behind the tea garden.\r\n\r\n4/ Bison Range\r\nI think some people might be mad about bison caged up in the middle of the park?  All I know is that when I used to drive to work this way, I would stop and say hello to the bison every day, and it made me feel good.  I usually take out-of-towners here for the shock value.  They (the bison) always look pretty pissed off, but I think they're just bluffing.  We saw a fox in there once.\r\n\r\n5/ Botanical Garden\r\nSooooooo pretty.  Makes you want to write poetry.  \r\n\r\n6/ Sharon Meadow \r\nThe site of Opera in the Park.  I KNOW I reviewed this separately!\r\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/hYaaFPl19yti-sAFmFAbkA?hrid=MfkwPgjXCm9iDqYXKz-7bA\r\n\r\n7/ Unnamed open areas\r\nThere are so many places to set up your picnic, bbq, soccer game, etc.  You can just find a spot and not feel crowded.  I had a particularly great time one Sunday with my brother and his radio-controlled airplane.  You can just do your thing, be it roller disco, croquet or playing the bongos.  \r\n\r\nI also enjoy the DeYoung grounds and just generally driving around the park.  In the wee hours of the morning when the sprinklers are just turned on, it feels like the world is being covered with fairy-dew.\r\n\r\nWhen you want to feel happy, go to the park and play.

I've been here for an outdoor concert in amazing weather, been on bike rides through the park (and was able to avoid going up hill more than down hills), the modern play ground, tea garden, museums, etc etc.\n\nThis is such an amazing place. The music concourse may be one of my favorite spots in the park. Its flanked with amazing architectural structures--the CAS (Piano) and de Young (HdM) and a stage, where I've seen live fire spinning shows. Right by the deYoung on the street, on sat/sun, roller skaters perform and practice. On a nice clear saturday, there were artists posted out around the fountain in the middle of the concourse, selling art. Got to talk to one metal artist who made great shadow pieces.\n\nAnother favorite location of mine is their play ground. Its not your everday swings and monkey bars jungle gym that we all loved from our elementary school days, but there were modern day installations, such as this thing that looked like cat-tail and you just swing around on it.\n\nI love that there is a buffalo running ground, a casting pond, a lake for row boats, an asian pavilion, horse stables, a botanical garden that is semi-reminiscent of the crystal palace, and just fields everywhere.

I always make sure to take a break in front of the museum and soak in the view. \n\nEven at night, it's one of my favorite spots in the park. I have an affinity for the trapezoid-like tower engulfed in brown metal netting, the Roman arch and pillars that are constantly being renovated, the new museum across the way, and the field of palm trees in the central paved area. Plus, the Japanese Tea Garden is only a few feet away and there are statutes of philosophers, poets and artists scattered throughout the circle. \n\nAnd this is only the tip of the iceburg. You get the Conservatory of Flowers, the water bison, the wooden windmill, the hundreds of secluded pockets (perfect for picnics and volleyball), hippie hill and Kezar Stadium... all in a park that spans almost half the length of our city. \n\nI often bitch about living in the Outer Richmond, but one of the things I'm thankful for is how close Golden Gate Park is to my apartment and that I actually take advantage of that proximity as much as I can.", "author": "Jared S."}

So I've made it a habit to do a long Golden Gate Park walk on Saturday mornings. I take off from either the Mission or Hayes Valley, head to the Upper Haight, into the park, randomly walk all over the park until I'm tired, then walk out and down Haight Street in the direction of where I came. I'm all plugged into my ipod so I really disappear into my own world.\n\nThe cool thing about it is that every week is a little different. There are so many different environments within the park. I always notice something new and never take the same route. Especially on the nice weather days, it's a great opportunity to disengage from the hectic reality that normally surrounds me and soak up some sunshine while breathing in the freshness of vegetation. It's also a proven hangover cure for me.\n\nThe only part that sucks is the grungy guys bumming around the park looking wasted and acting offended that I don't respond to the random things they say to me that I can't hear anyway since I'm listening to my freaking music.

Boy, oh boy, did I discover what I was missing, and I can't wait to come back and have more time to go adventuring in the park.\n\nI didn't have a plan at all when I went.  I simply set aside 2.5 hours to wander the park by myself.  I took a book, my camera, and a sweatshirt because it can get a little cold.  There were random trails to walk through feeling like you were on a hike.  There were quiet spots in the park where different people claimed a spot of grass as theirs.  The botanical garden was fun to roam around.  Then I found myself at the Rose Garden, and I took the time to smell all the different types of roses and read my book.  The roses were beautiful and most smelled good.  Sadly I'm a person who hardly has time to stop and smell the roses, but this trip I took the time and it will hopefully encourage me to slow down.  What else?\n\nStow Lake was a part of the park I had never been before and I thoroughly enjoyed this discovery.  It may not be a secret to you, but for me, it was a whole different part of the park that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I walked around the island part finding myself climbing dirt stairs higher and higher, and before I knew it I was face to face with a waterfall that I didn't know was there.  Then I saw people taking little row boat rides through the lake.  I definitely wanted to come back here with some friends.  How fun?!  \n\nI know, I know.  I must sound like such a dork.  You're probably thinking, \"What's the big deal?  It's just a park.\"  But I truly appreciate these big outdoor parks more than I used to when I was younger.  Maybe I'm getting old?  I don't know, but bottom line is that I would like to return to Golden Gate Park because I know there is far more to explore, it's relaxing and fun to walk around getting lost along or with friends, and it's great way to get exercise without feeling like a caged animal on a little treadmill.  Try it some time.  You won't regret it.  Don't be like me and wait until your 50th visit to San Francisco.", "author": "Nicky C."}

What else can you ask for?\nThe only bummer is that the far end of the park, by Ocean Beach, used to have a whole little theme park (very similar to the Boardwalk in Santa Cruz) way back in the day, it also had an ice skating rink years back, and now it has a giant soccer field (it is actually several soccer fields, I think)-- which is basically the same as saying that it just has a giant patch of empty lawn. Don't get me wrong, I like to go there and read a book once in awhile or let my dog run around or play catch with a friend.... but I still think that space could be put to way better use.

And if one could spend the afternoon here- meandering through the paths and discovering each flower after flower and plant after plant- its a journey that will enrich your life forever.  \nThere were many times I came here- and shed a few tears  to find hope coupled with calmness.

This is a place where I have been comforted as well as comforted a  friend in need.  \nI wouldn't be surprised if people get married or engaged here, find their loved one here and well even find themselves here- its truly a place rooted  deeply in unifying, and if you listen carefully,  the very breeze that echos through the rustling leaves were the prayers that met their answers ~ here.", "author": "Arissa C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-01-30", "description": "I think so many people in the US and those who hear about SF in the general media as just being some \"gay\" town or just a place that has alot of crime and deaths in the recent few years just doesn't see it through the eyes of many good natured people who've grown up here. Golden Gate Park to me is one of the most unique and beautiful FULL parks I've ever seen or been to. It reflects the true nature and beauty of the city. I've grown up in this city and since I've been forced to move to the DC area I've only heard about how much they hate the place and how they think it's nothing special and I gotta tell them each time, don't speak another word until you've actually been here and lived here and seen all there is to see. It's more than just a place for gay rights but SF would like to represent a place of where EVERYONE is entitled to their own beliefs and life as well as to be respected for their uniqueness and beauty as well as diverse history. I know there has alot been alot of negativity surrounding the city, such as bad school system, violence, kids jumping other kids, and the extremely high living costs thus resulting in such a huge homeless population not to mention cops who just aren't doing the city proud I would still like to believe theres still something about SF that you won't find anywhere else. Overall it's not \"San Francisco's\" fault. After all SF is just the city itself and the scenery and the historic beauty that is has is only being buried by all the bad media attention and portrayal and it's making me very sad, because though I currently don't live in it anymore, my heart has never left the city by the bay and it never will. I love the CITY and all it's beauty even though I've come to resent and be angry with many of the negative people who've been trying to turn it into something it never deserved to be known for. I can assure you all that when it comes to the food especially the Asian cuisine NO other city or state in the US compares, and I've personally tried many places in my current area and neither have done it for me. We truly have the BEST selection of food anywhere besides maybe NY but we're both unique in that with so much diversity comes all this GREAT food. Golden Gate park is a sacred place to me because it's where my family used to be a family, where both my mom and dad used to take me for strolls in the park, and seeing all the beautiful flowers and plants and waterfalls was like an adventure to me. It's so big that you just feel like your in a forest. I even enjoyed walking my dog here and just laying on the grass on a \"rare\" but warm and sunny day with my doggy laying his chest on me and just feeling a sense of warmth inside my heart, knowing that to me this place always and forever will be simple known as home even if the only place i could afford to live in were the park itself. (as sad and real as it may sound) it's the only reason why me and my hubby were forced to leave. =(", "author": "Petra S."}

This morning I tried something new. I woke up early, went for coffee, and since the coffee shop was too crowd, I decided to go to the park. The Botanical Garden (one of my favorite park locations to enjoy leisure strolls) was not open yet. So I ventured to the field where I often see people play soccer, baseball or simply walk their dogs. Well, this morning, I sat down at the bleachers, pull out my book, and read. Coincidentally I was reading about meditation from the book Eat, Pray, and Love, and it was quite a meditative experience sitting there, engaged in my reading as the sun rays beamed down on me.

She loved being amongst tens of thousands of people listening to music in a park.  She loved the oddity of the Bison.  On the way out, Rachel and a friend were walking between the trees on the way to where they had parked when Rachel noticed something strange.

You see, we don't have anything like Golden Gate Park in L.A.  Sure, Griffith Park is nice, and there are plenty of other parks and museums throughout L.A.; however, none of it compares to Golden Gate Park.  Also, as nice as L.A. weather is, it doesn't compare to the warm, but not too hot, San Francisco weather.\n\nThere's simply so much to do in Golden Gate Park.  Want to go for a bike ride, go running, or go rollerblading?  A pedal boat trip around a man-made lake and past a waterfall?  Horseback riding?  Check, check, and check!  Do you want to see a vintage Japanese tea garden?  How about a herd of buffalo, scratching their backs against tree stumps?  Check and check.  You see, Golden Gate Park is so huge, and yet, each of the individual attractions so intimate, that you'll find something totally relaxing and worthwhile no matter what you're in the mood for.\n\nMy favorite spots in Golden Gate Park are the windmills on the far West side near Ocean Beach, Stow Lake (hey, I used to come here as a kid), and the Bison Paddock, where it is always nice to spend a few minutes watching the buffalo.", "author": "Andrew D."}

We started out at the Japanese Gardens which were really nice.  The one steep bridge was a great photo op, and the tea house was a great experience at 4 dollars.  A \"geisha\" brought us each a pot of tea and a bowl of cracker and cookies in a lovely hut atmosphere.  We also had a third member join out party--a fearless squirrel who went from table to table trying to get scraps.  \nAfter the tea gardens we headed to the Bison Paddock.  What is a paddock you ask?  As large open space.  And this one had 5 bison on it.  Unexpected sight in San Fran for sure.\nWe drove a bit farther down JFK Drive until we came upon the Windmill.  Unfortunately the tulips were not out, but the flowers that were around were lovely.\nThe last thing we wanted to do in the park was the lawn bowling---but we couldn't find the lawn bowling area or the free lessons!  Disappointment.\nThere is much more this park offers, if I was a city dweller I would frequent this place often.", "author": "Katie F."}

Come meet up with us and bring all toys, beers and food to share.' \nBy 2 we were all in the park, at Spreckles Lake meadow. We had bocce ball, smashball, frisbee, racer 5's, wine and loaves of bread, cheese, salami, tomatoes, chips. We had a picnic table, blankets, additional chairs - everything we needed (besides a nearby bathroom which after some racer 5's and jumping around became an issue). \nThe afternoon sun was abundant as we all know who experienced SF this weekend. We were playing like little kids for hours. Our neighbors were playing volleyball, dodge ball and the like. \nIn the 6 years I have lived in SF, I still continue to unveil new offerings from this park, things I have not yet seen.

There are so many amazing things throughout the park, I cannot even fathom running out of things to do there.  Simply lounging on one of the countless grassy knolls is often where I can be found, probably including a picnic with friends.  The flower conservatory (even just the building itself) is beautiful.  Ocean Beach is at the end of the park, just a quick bike ride away.  There is stuff for kids to do, dogs, adults.  The De Young is amazing too!  Golden Gate Park is a wonderful oasis that should be explored by all.", "author": "Lauren H."}

I have been to the park for events like the annual AIDS walk, or for outdoor shows, but its beauty shines through even brighter on a calm weekday afternoon, if you can manage it. And it has more on offer than you can explore or digest in a single visit. \nThe best part is that there is something for every age, mood and personality. Formal pruned rose garden? You got it. Arboretum? Check. Wooded trails? Uh huh. Japanese tea garden? Hell yes. (Oh, and by the way, if you do visit the tea garden, try and do it when it's raining. There are few things more beautiful than sitting under the pavilion sipping steaming jasmine tea, looking out at the leaves elegantly dripping moisture.) \nGot some energetic kids with you? We've got you covered with a kids play area and the coolest carousel ever. And if you're with a mixed group looking for some variety, take a turn at the bocce ball lanes or paddle around Stow Lake. \nAnd if it's just you, looking for an escape from the city, walk, walk, walk everywhere. Take a break at the De Young museum to get re-energized (or if just art doesn't do that for ya, stop by the museum cafe). \nI could go on and on, but then, you need to get out and go explore this wonder for yourself.

There will still be the periodic attempt to sell you weed, but it is a minor annoyance or convenience depending on your tastes.   The park is sprawling and offers something for everyone.   I passed by the art center, soccer fields, miles of trails, dog parks, memorial groves, science/history/museum, aquarium, conservatory, tennis courts, raquetball courts, play grounds, nursury (they have their own), and lawn bowling facility and I only made it a short way into the park.

It is so wonderfully expansive and jam-packed with attractions both hidden and famous that it almost seems its treasures will never be exhausted.  Every time I go, I find something I've never seen or noticed before.  It's not the point to list them all, but I can't resist enumerating a bunch of the best and/or most interesting.  Of course there is the Japanese Tea Garden, which is just beautiful and serene, and the Conservatory of Flowers and the Arboretum (a recent breath-taking discovery).  In addition, however, there are (not one but) two bocci fields, a working vintage carousel, a stable of riding horses (which I think can be rented),  a fly-fishing society, about a dozen head of live bison, an archery range, the expansive polo fields (which host the entirely free Not So Strictly Bluegrass Festival every October), the Rose Garden (with more varieties of amusingly-named roses than you ever thought to see), a 9-hole golf course, the National AIDS Memorial Grove (inevitably sad but also lovely and inspiring), baseball and soccer fields, the off-the-beaten-path and charming Shakespeare Garden, a restored windmill with a gorgeous flower garden at its base, and countless winding paths with small hidden wonders of all descriptions around every corner.  Somewhere in the middle of it all is the marvelous Stow Lake--from which you can rent various pedal-powered vehicles for exploring the park--and its towering island-hill in the center, complete with a pagoda-like structure and a lovely waterfall.  Perhaps best of all is the view from the top should you make the climb--though largely obscured by trees, on a clear day the vista will show you an awfully large portion of the city and the Marin headlands to the north.  San Francisco is incredibly blessed to have such a generous swath of green space within its boundaries, and it's one of the wonders that makes living here a real privilege.", "author": "Michael T."}

The wonderful trees and free parts of the park are as good as some fee gardens.  My only complaint - and for me a pet peeve - is the very, very poor wayfinding signage. The Park has some attractions like a great children's playground, conservatory and botanical garden (reviewed separately). But  finding these attractions, or anything else is a challenge to say the least. I've never needed to ask for or been asked for directions any more than at this place. The maps and directions provided by the park are nice, especially when they give you a street address... but then, the streets aren't signed so you have no idea what street you're on much less which one you've found. And once you're on the paths and trails, you'll need a compass or a guide 'cause there sure aren't any or many signs.  I'm no fan of signs, but at a place as large as this one, they are critical. Especially if you're on a limited schedule like we were and looking specifically for an attraction that's closing in an hour...  Still do visit, just leave plenty of time for going in circles and looking for 'you are here' signs.  Good luck!", "author": "Geoff T."}

I'm not going to lie .. sometimes it's just nice to take a walk through a park full of trees , bushes , and grass . It's very soothing and relieves stress ( not to mention , easy to get lost too ! haha ) . It's just wonderful . It's a nice place for photography too . Inside Golden Gate Park , there's some parks , museums , and the Japanese Garden in Golden Gate Park . It's a great place to go biking on Sundays because I remember reading on the website that one area is cleared of traffic on that day just for that purpose . Only thing I don't like about Golden Gate Park is that last time I came to do a photoshoot , I got mosquito bites all over my leg because there were just so many mosquitoes in that one area !! You can still see traces of the bites on my leg ): Also , I remember my friend driving through Golden Gate Park late at night when we were high . I might've been high but I swear .. I saw owls behind every tree !! I got so paranoid !! I'm sorry to be a hater .. but I HATE owls . They're so ugly and creepy looking with their big heads , big eyes , 360 degree turning heads , and glowing marks on their tummies !! I know they are endangered and all .. but I just don't find them cute or cool one bit . They don't even seem like animals .. they seem more like creatures with magical powers . Haha , maybe I watched too much TV as a kid . Hey , that's what TV and movies do to you haha . So now I'm paranoid when my friends choose to drive through Golden Gate Park at night because I'm scared of seeing owls !! I think it's only in that one area though ( I forgot which one it was ) because my friends take a different route through Golden Gate Park so I never saw them again since that night . Oh , and there's a lot of stories about Golden Gate Park such as the one story about the cop who died on duty inside Golden Gate Park and that comes back occasionly to pull people over .

When my family went, I remember seeing lots of pretty flowers, and when I was here three years ago, I remember visiting the Japanese garden (at least I think it was) and sticking my foot in the pond of some green growing on the top of it, just because I wanted to disperse some of that green stuff...gross, but the water wasn't that dirty.", "author": "W W."}

I'm just a short walk away from GG Park and we go out here to jog around the polo field or walk around the duck pond.  I really do need to find out where to sign up for horseback riding out here...I always see people riding through the park.  If you know, let me know.  You can also go to Stow lake and either rent a paddle or row boat or rent the 2-3-4 person bikes.  Alot of fun ways to enjoy our \"mini central park\" on beautiful SF days.", "author": "Mary H."}

Then stopping at your soccer field, getting a steak taco from the dudes with the small cart, and then reading the entire newspaper. You also provide nice access to the Ocean.

This famous park, from childhood right on up to today at 27, is still my favorite park.  As far as kids are concerned, they have playgrounds with various types of equipment for all ages.  The speedway is also cool for getting your drive on.  I always loved and still love renting peddle boats in Stowe Lake, which I have not done since I was a kid; the lake is fvery peaceful, allowing you to take in the tranquility and sounds of birds chirping.  The carousel was another favorite of mine growing up, always going on it for multiple rides with all of horses going up and down and that classical carousel music.  The park, like all parks, has expansive lawns, picnic tables, and barbecues for picnics and functions.  I love the Hajuara Tea Garden in which it is even more serene with waterfalls, a bridge to walk over when walking around the garden, and a guy that plays the fleet outside of the garden; I love eating all of the traditional Japanese cookies, crackers, and sweets and drinking all of the traditional tea that they offer.  Being under an enclosed area shaped like a Japanese curbed roof is all the more authentic.  It is all the niblies and tea that you can eat and drink.  The park also features tennis courts and gulf courses if I am not mistaken.  Depending on the time of the year, they always outdoor concerts, as well as festivals like the annual A La Carte A La Park festival in which you can try different foods from all of the different restaurants in San Francisco and around the rest of the bay area; there is everything from American to Vietnamese to please every ones' pallet.  Needless to say, I love walking through the park, just watching and listening to the sites and sounds of the busy, bustling park.  There so many trees throughout the park, that it is almost like you in a secluded area, taking a break from the hustle and bustle of the city.  This will definitely an institution for years to come.  Keep up the good work City of San Francisco.!", "author": "Brian S."}
