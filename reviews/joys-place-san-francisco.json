Instead of coffee though, I found the sweet potato latte which sounded interesting so I ended up giving it a try.\n\nThe sweet potato latte was pretty good, but it is a bit on the sweet side. It tastes a lot like blended sweet potatoes with whole milk, heated up really well and sweetened. The sweet potato itself is already pretty sweet, so if I had to do it again I'd probably ask that they don't sweeten it in any way.\n\nIt is a bit heavy of a drink though, since you're getting the calories from the milk, sweetener and the carb-heavy sweet potato. So the drink itself can be quite filling.", "author": "Tyler T."}

The shaved ice came out super quick (I just finished paying, and it was ready)! The shaved ice was meh - it's literally a bed of crunchy ice topped with green tea ice cream, red bean, some mochi and peanuts and I believe condensed milk and caramel (could be wrong). Even though I wasn't impressed with the shaved ice, other items on the menu seem good! I would try the waffle or honey bread next time! \n\nOn another note, parking in this area is actually quite difficult (it's located in downtown SF).

Three types of shaved ice desserts, because why not?  And a lot of other sweets that look too fancy for a coffee house.\n\nGreen Tea Shaved Ice: This was so refreshing on a warm-ish day in San Francisco.  Flavored ice (vanilla?) that is shaved thin.  Then comes a really sweet glob of red beans.  A very rich matcha green tea scoop of ice cream on top of that.  And some little mochi pillows to add a chewy texture.  Once I ate all the solids, I had what seemed like a bunch of ice cold matcha-flavored cereal milk leftover.  No shame in slurping that up!\n\nHoney Bread: It's basically three thick slices of crispy toast that are drenched in butter and honey then covered with loads of whipped cream.  And, of course, there is a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side and another mound of whipped cream for good measure.  I really appreciated the simplicity of this, like a dessert you could put together at home when you don't have any traditional desserts.  It did feel a bit too carb-y about half way through though, so probably best to share.\n\nGreen Tea Latte: This was just ok.  A little light on the matcha and heavy on the sweetener.

I was intrigued by the concept of \"Honey Bread\" which from the painting in the store looked like some kind of pound cake dessert. \n\nThe honey bread took them about 15 minutes to make, which I was not expecting because Joy's Place is a coffee shop and they rarely produce that kind of wait time.\n\nThe honey bread is actually 3 slices of toast with butter, cinnamon, sugar, whipped cream, and nuts, served with a side of ice cream. There is no actual honey.  It's actually a substantial amount of food, so you get your $7 worth and it explains the wait time somewhat.  I was quite surprised, however, since I was not expecting this kind of dessert.\n\nI think it's a good dessert for those who do not want something too sweet and who don't mind carb loading - the flavor does not fully permeate the bread so you have some plain bread alongside the sweetened bread.", "author": "Nicole R."}

I saw her picture for an ube latte in Maui and immediately wanted to try it.  However, a 2300 mile distance was a bit of a challenge and to be honest, a hot drink probably isn't what I would go for when it is 80-90 degrees outside over there.  So when she told me she was inspired to try that ube latte after having the sweet potato latte in SF, I knew I had no excuse not to cross the bridge since I didn't have to cross the ocean for this one.  After indulging in French pastries and croissants at Les Gourmands, I needed a non coffee chaser and immediately thought of that sweet potato latte.  \n\nA cute hangout for locals including families especially on a weekend morning, honestly I would have walked past it if I wasn't specifically looking for it.  You can really taste the sweet potato puree with each sip of the latte and in some instances, even small pieces of the pulp.  It was a perfect treat for this non-coffee drinker.

I read about this place a few days before and the first mention of sweet potato latte had me at HELLO (!!).\n\nI walked into the shop and I got the impression that this was the spot to hangout for the college-aged group and people who need a place to get work done at night.  They are open past midnight and this is a cute space to hangout -- especially if you're like me and have late night cravings for sweets.\n\nThey have a big menu board display and ordering is fast and easy.  They quickly whipped up my latte and I was on my way in a matter of minutes.  Thankfully so because any minute sooner and I probably would've been tempted to eat one or two of the cakes left in their dessert case.

They open until midnight on most if not all days of the week, making for a nice spot for night owls to flock to. The 10pm crew of patrons usually consist of individuals, either single or in a cohort of others, working on laptops. There's the occasional small group of those there for a late night hangout.\n\nTheir coffee was quite good. I had the iced latte that was equally strong and aromatic. I'd definitely order it again.\n\nIt is indeed like a sauna here. Come in layers and expect to peel down to a tank top.", "author": "Cici T."}

Since it was super warm there, and my friends and I were heating up, and SUPER parched, we wanted to grab some ice cream or drinks. We walked over, so I couldn't comment on the parking, but it seems like it would not be super fun, since it is SF. Anyway, we arrived at around 10 pm, and the place had maybe half the tables full with people working on their laptops. Seemed like a chill place. Very cutesy interior and menu drawn on a wall that is basically a large chalkboard. As we ordered the green tea shaved ice, we were told that they were out of vanilla ice cream, and that they would have to substitute for matcha ice cream. Not a big deal since I love green tea! \n\nAt $5 for a small sized shaved ice, it is a bit pricey, but again, I get that it is SF. It is probably as big as a regular sized boba cup (not those regular-sized-auto upgrade-to-a-large cups). I was also a bit sad that they didn't fill the shaved ice and fillings to the top of the cup, and then overflow it with the ice cream that they add to top the dessert off. Instead the entire dessert was as tall as the cup itself. But it is what it is. The green shaved snow comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream usually, red beans, mochi, peanuts, and condensed milk. The shaved ice itself is pretty good--I like that the ice pieces are really fine compared to other places, but it's not quite on the level of shaved snow. The scoop of green tea ice cream was also good! It was creamy and complemented the shaved ice well. Overall it was good, but I still wish the portion was bigger for the price. Maybe we would have gotten more value for the large at $9? But then again, I feel like it would need more than 2 people to finish that comfortably. It definitely looked at least twice as big as the small.\n\nI would rate this place 3.5/5, but rounded up to 4/5.", "author": "Cindy M."}

It's cozy, that's for sure. Lots of people saying it's a good study spot. Personally, I like space. So if you don't mind being pretty close to someone, then Joy's Place is a cute cafe for you! It's a slightly quiet atmosphere. For conversational reasons, it may not be a great idea to be talking too loud or anything too personal.\n\nMenu is simple. Drinks an dessert. No real food though. That can be a pain while studying hungry. I ordered their Affogato. DELICIOUS! The espresso was very strong so the ice cream worked well. It's more of a dessert than a drink though. So beware. \n\nI also ordered a Honey toast w/ green tea ice cream. Presentation was pretty. The first bite was super sweet with a second taste of butter. Yes, too much butter. The toast began to be very very soggy. Not sure if it was due to the whipped cream or butter on top, but it went through all three layers of the toast. Not a super big fan. I like the thicker toast which is crispy from beginning to end. In the end, I felt like I was eating honey bread instead. \n\n\nNot my ideal place for coffee in S.F. area.

We found Joy's Place and it turned out to be a nice cafe with a really chilled out vibe. They had free WiFi and were playing R&B slow jams from the 90s and 2000s the entire time we were there. Bonus points for that. A couple of Asian guys seemed to be running the place and they were both really friendly. \n\nI'm not a big coffee guy at all and I learned more about the various preparations of coffee from their illustrated menu board within a few minutes than I ever knew before haha. A bunch of us just decided to share a few of the their desserts. \n\nAffogato - It's like a root beer float, except with coffee. And they gave a double scoop of ice cream...I like their style.\n\nRed Bean shaved ice - This was way bigger than we thought it would be. It was a good thing we were all just sharing it. This reminded me of a Filipino dessert called halo halo. It was basically plain shaved ice that's sweetened with sugar and then a ton of different types of toppings thrown on it. At the very top they threw on a scoop of vanilla ice cream too. The sweetened shaved ice was my favorite part. It created that sweet/cold combination without being overly rich like ice cream. Despite the name, I wasn't really a big fan of the red bean part of it. I just wanted to eat that shaved ice with those little pieces of mochi mixed in. \n\nHoney bread - Talk about a decadent dessert. I'm pretty sure these slices of bread are basically just soaked in butter and then toasted. You really do taste the butter in every bite. It's simple yet so delicious. Butter soaked bread with whipped cream and ice cream on top? Yes please. \n\nOverall Joy's was a nice cafe with a cool vibe, great music, and huge tasty desserts.", "author": "Mike M."}

The bread isn't much grilled.... it's more a soft squishy grease sponge and it's just not the right bread for this sandwich. If I was rating the sandwich alone it would be a regretful 1 star. I think this may be the only meal lately where I ate my salad first. I tried to eat the grilled cheese but the texture actually made me gag. I didn't have the nerve to send it back though. That's the problem with food that looks tasty but actually isn't.\n\nI should've gotten the waffles (which I also had recently when there and was determine to order food but never again a sandwich).

But not in Joy's Place! \n\nI tried their Red Bean Bingsoo (small $5 and large $9) and it was soo good! They dont overload your dessert with ice, they were generous on the condensed milk, redbean, mochi and ice cream! Real good deal for $5\n\nThis is a cool cafe to study too!

I don't have to go all the way to the Inner Richmond/Sunset to fulfill my craving for shaved ice?  Great hours and location serving a niche.  But, with that comes high prices.  The large green tea bingsoo cost a hefty $9.  Sure, it was delicious.  Green tea heavenly ice with deliciously creamy green tea ice cream, topped with almonds, red beans, condensed milk (basically the magic ingredient in all Asian desserts), and mochi (chewy rice cakes--trust me it tastes much better than it sounds).  When our order came out, I noticed it did not have mochi...which is like the most important bingsoo topping ever.  Thankfully, when I asked the servers about it, they gave us a cup of mochi because a mochi-less shaved ice would be so sad.\n\nI was pretty surprised by how crowded the place was around 11:00 on a Friday night.  But, it's smart for them to stay open late.  Now I know where to go to get my late night shaved ice fix without having to drive too far!

I adore this place! The environment reminds me of those cafes you see in Korean dramas. I couldn't stop marveling at the decor when I paid my first visit. It was like stepping into someone's house for a cup of coffee/tea. I couldn't help but compare it to YakiniQ Cafe but there's some differences. \n\nJoy's Place is quite small so the seating is limited. Also, like most Korean places, you get your own utensils and water by yourself. It's a good spot to get some work done or catch up with a friend or two. \n\nSWEET POTATO LATTE: Love it! Definitely my new favorite drink if I don't need coffee for the day. It's not too sweet and has small bits of sweet potato in the drink. \n\nHONEY BREAD: It's good when you have your first few bites. Then it starts to get sweet and will end up as leftovers if you don't share this with at least three people. My friend and I only reached halfway. It's a heavy treat as it's served with whipped cream and a side of vanilla ice cream. Probably won't order this one again... Once is good enough. \n\nGREEN TEA BINGSOO: I've had my fair share of bingsoo and this place tops all the other places I've tried. For $8, you get a massive amount so it's definitely worth the price. I couldn't stop plowing my way through this dessert.. Makes me want another one right now. It's also aesthetically pleasing so pictures were definitely taken. \n\nDo check this place when you can!

We had a sweet potato latte and patbingsoo. Both were good at the time but so sweet we were in a coughing contest afterwards. \n\nCame back another day, this time a Friday night to hang with a group of friends. Everyone around us was loud with chatter, and the sound system was blaring so we had to talk loudly to communicate across the table. After a few minutes we got a hang of the volume, so we finally could hear each other, had good laughs...but then came the lady shusher. She walked up to our small cramped table and shushed us and glared at our backs!! If this was a library, it would have been more appropriate. Of course, it was so loud in there I couldn't hear what she was saying, but my friends relayed that she's telling us to be quiet. After some time, another guy came - this one looked like he worked at the shop - the man shusher. He came over and shushed us :( He was rude and condescending...and when we got quiet, the other groups around us were being super loud. ..but we didn't see the man shusher running up to them and acting rude to them. I guess it was even ruder, since they pick and choose who to yell at.\n\nBeing nice and courteous to your customers go a long way. Based on how oppressing the experience was, some signs that need to go up: SHHH!, No laughing allowed, no cash allowed, no joy allowed.

The current location is now on winter hours, meaning they will close at 8 pm instead of 10 pm for the next few months.  One regular attendee suggested Joy's Place since they stay open late, so I checked it out earlier this evening.  As others have noted, it.s small, clean, quiet and charming.  Unfortunately, as at least one other reviewer pointed out, they keep the room temperature up high enough that you feel a warm blast as soon as you step inside.  That's probably okay if you're planning to be there for 10-15 minutes worth of snack and drink.  Unfortunately, it would be impractical for a Meetup where every attendee was planning to get at least two hours of work done.  Hopefully I can find a recommendation for downtown cafe that stays open until 9 pm or later, with maybe at least one large table where a pretty quiet group can get together on Thursday nights.", "author": "Dean L."}

This is a story of royal ninjas and RBFs.\n\nCame here on a Friday night with a group of friends to grab a hot drink and chill for a bit.  I ordered the sweet lemon tea which was actually pretty damn good, too bad the cashier couldn't be bothered to change his chronic RBF.  Pretty ironic considering the name of the establishment.  \n\nI was surprised how crowded it was for a cafe at 10:30 at night; all the tables were taken, and we waited for one to open up for about 10 minutes which we were happy to do.  It was warm and cozy, and there was a lot of chatter with some kind of loud radio on the entire time as well, so obviously it didn't feel like a place we needed to be quiet.  After we were all sitting and chatting, about 6 of us, this ninja lady dressed in all black comes and tells us we're too loud and to be quiet so she can have a conversation with her friend....they are across the room mind you.  This took me off guard because she was really unfriendly about it, GURL, if you're going to ask a group of people to do something for you, at least smile and don't be so aggressive ok?  Hell maybe even throw a \"please\" in there! Because she was acting like a princess we were taken off guard and did try to quiet down for her majesty.\n\nWhat was so weird is that she was ACROSS the room, and the people that were actually sitting next to us didn't seem to have any problems with us, they were carrying on their conversations just fine and weren't staring at us or anything like we were being too loud.  It was just ninja lady who literally kept turning around to give us a death stare like 20 times.....wai??  \n\nThen we realized she was buddy buddy with the staff. OH OK I SEE.  I SEE WUTS HAPPENING. She's friends with the staff, or staff herself so she feels like she is the queen of Joy's Place.  Ok Ok. I see this conspiracy. \n\nSo 10 minutes pass and one of the other cashiers comes over and tells us to be quiet, again majorly lacking any sort of courtesy or hint of customer service. But this wasn't the least bit surprising after my initial interaction with RBF cashier # 1.  We seriously were barely louder than anyone else in the cafe.  We felt super disrespected and unwelcomed so of course we left shortly afterward.  \n\nWONT BE BACK EVER K THNX BAI.", "author": "Christina L."}

Joy's place, aptly named, was my haven during my stay in SF. \n\nRight around the corner on Taylor, sitting on Post, Joy's is a quaint little spot with high impact coffee and humble decor. The right side of the cafe includes chalkboard drawings, a coffee diagram, and a simple menu. Cafe lattes, cappuccino, drip coffee, mocha, pour over, 3 sandwich/panini options, and dessert. \n\nThe few times I was there, I ordered the pour over (option: Guatemala beans), soy lattes, and the honey bread. Admittedly, the coffee art needs some help, but the coffee itself was expertly brewed. \n\nIt might've been only 9:30am, but I ordered the honey bread. It's part of the dessert menu and what a dessert it was. It came with 3 slices of thick honey bread toast, topped with whipped cream, sliced almonds, dusted with cinnamon, and drizzled with melted butter. As if that wasn't enough, on the side was more whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Added my soy latte and I was in heaven!\n\nOh yes, the left side of the cafe was decorated simply with a bookcase and a few glass vases of wall-hung terrariums. Simple and humble.", "author": "Lily C."}

Buuuuut, it's adorable inside and nobody complained that there were a group of us cackling in a corner.\n\nWe tried the Strawberry Shaved Ice and the Hot Chocolate. Definitely worth it to upgrade to the large shaved ice because it's humongous for only slightly more moneyz! We easily split it between 5 of us and couldn't even finish it (albeit we had already gorged on dinner only an hour earlier). I wish that the ice were fluffier and had more fruit (more like Taiwanese Shaved Ice I've had in the past), but all the ingredients were pretty tasty.

Ordered Americano. Prices for coffees and lattes aren't too steep but desserts and food dishes seem a bit more pricey than the norm. \n\nHighly recommend this place as a alternative to Yakini Q if huge crowds and slow internet is not your thing.

They actually put Korean sweet potato in it and you can slightly taste the sandy texture, but not in a bad way. It's sweet but not overly so, and just very warm and comforting. \n2) The yujacha (citron tea) is super good as well. An extremely simple drink that many Asian families make at home (yuja preserves + hot water), but I love that I can order this at Joy's Place.

I got this at the suggestion of the fellow Yelpers and I'm glad I made this choice! It was moderately sweet and a little tangy at the same time. A+\n-Waffles\nMy friend got this one and looked great! It was 4 slices of waffles (apparently homemade) with a scoop of ice cream, whipped cream, and almond slices! It wasn't anything too hearty so it complimented our warm drinks.\n-Green Tea Latte\nSuperb. I saw the barista use one of my favorite matcha powders, so I knew if this drink went wrong it would be her fault... But luckily it wasn't! Warm, creamy goodness is what it was.\n-Caffe Latte\nDidn't get to try this personally, but my friend liked it!

I have got to say tho, it tasted amazing!

The patbingsu was delicious, perhaps a little too sweet for my taste, and probably would have fed 2.5-3 people (all for $9).

She also had the tuna melt, which seemed to be decent, very tuna-ey (in a not-unpleasant way), but nothing to write home about.

I was excited to try out a Korean shaved ice place in SF, but it all just boiled down to disappointments.. I went tonight and the place was packed with mostly people on their computers, which I didn't mind. I ordered the green tea shaved ice in large and it definitely did not look like the picture everyone was posting nor was the portion size the same. The order did come out very fast though.. but with no bowls and spoons. So I asked the girl working if there were any bowls and spoons and she just turns around and tells the dude working to help that girl out in Korean. So this dude turns to me and just stares at me.. so I ask again are there any bowls or spoons since I was sharing and he said we don't have bowls, but we have these coffee cups.. and I was like and the spoons? Which he replied they're right behind there. The whole time I was there I got no thank yous, even after ordering, no just a moment, no sorries, and just flat out no good customer service. I wish this was it... but it's not. After we sat down on a table after waiting for a while to clear up, the dude that was working the register stepped outside, pulled the door wide open and started smoking a cigarette. The smoke was coming inside the cafe, which was not pleasant. After he was done and came back in, I did not see him wash his hands. The girl working fixed her hair as well and did not wash her hands either.. nasty. I saw the 98 health score, but I think they definitely deserve less.

We were willing to walk for that shit. The experience was kind of like a self-introductory passing through the city's heart of tourism, wiring together the circuits of the SF map in our minds. Ever since then, we've taken the same path to get there, so we always pass the hotels on Post that look better than your home, or your second home, or your second home in your dreams. The lobbies look red-warm, and I've always wanted one of the guards at the front door to look at me. I don't even care if he nods in acceptance. Just so long as he acts like this is where I belong. The first time at Joy's Place I tried the green tea shaved ice, since fancy and shaved ice usually never dance together, just sit along the walls of their high school's auditorium. While shoveling in all the red beans, I noticed a wall painting that was possibly made by one of the international students I tutored at school once. It's a hella detailed painting of a cup of coffee with her name (I swear) scribbled on the bottom, and I wish I could go back to that appointment and maybe think of her as something other than a student struggling to learn our broken-glass-ball language. The other time, I ordered the honey bread and no one helped me eat it. My girlfriend has this habit of extracting enjoyment from forcing me to finish what I start. Specifically food. The leftovers sat in the fridge of our temporary home in Sacramento, where we stayed with a very welcoming family. It was a cold, soggy dessert that soothed me as I searched craigslist for a permanent home in SF, or Oakland, so I didn't have to commute 2 hours for grad school. Or maybe I ate it while I was buzzed and pleading craigslist for a hit. Either way, it was an impossible search. But I always took the same path.", "author": "Logan E."}

Once on a week day and it was pretty empty. The other time was on a weekend, and it was almost full of people working on their laptops and doing homework.\n\nWhat does a good coffee shop need?\n- Good coffee: check (on par with Blue Bottle/Ritual)\n- Free Wi-Fi: check\n- Good music: check\n- Lots of places to sit: check\n- Food: I haven't tried it, but the pastries look like they are from my favorite bakery in the city (Gerhard Michler in Dogpatch)\n- Large windows: check\n- Clean bathroom: check\n\nIt could use better signage though. It is sandwiched between other establishments, so unless you stand right in front of it, it's pretty hard to spot.", "author": "Eugene O."}

Unfortunately I was disappointed. \nMaybe it was the time of day or the full moon, but it was full of loud kids, un energetic staff, pretentious coffee, and the red bean shaved ice was pricey and not tasty to my palette. 4.5 stars makes me think I should go back on a better day. \nWish it was a rustic and bistro style spot with fantastic coffee.

The Wi-Fi connection is great, the place has good music and not too loud so one might actually get some work done.
