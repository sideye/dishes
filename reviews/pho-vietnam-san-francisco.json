It's a very casual environment. Nice, clean restaurant. We decided to try this place out since it was on the way home. I ordered the chicken pho (pho ga) which I thoroughly enjoyed. It was a perfect size and the broth was just right. My husband enjoyed his vegetarian pho & my son loved his shrimp veggie stir fry rice plate. We also ordered shrimp spring rolls, per usual. I will say the peanut sauce was super yummy but the spring rolls (you could tell) were not freshly rolled as the rice paper was a tad hardened.. but I really loved their pho ga. \n\nI ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee which was made perfectly strong (not mediocre-like strength as some other places). The staff was nice & welcoming as well. We didn't feel rushed out by any means like some other reviews have said and I thought the price was fair considering the area.", "author": "Ruby V."}

Rather than a traditional beef pho, I opted for a noodle soup dish with pork wontons, ground chicken and slices of pork. When the bowl came, I was pleasantly surprised that it came with the side dish of bean sprouts and basil branches. With the egg noodles used in this dish and a light chicken stock, I thought the noodle soup was meh.\n\nI prefer rice noodles myself but didn't want to pay an extra $1 for this change. At $11.75 for this dish, it's pretty pricey. I'm sure there are better places for Vietnamese noodle soup but if you're in the area and need a pho or Vietnamese food fix, this is probably you're only option.\n\nOne thing though, this restaurant has a lot of choices for noodle soup; not just beef pho.\n\nService was very casual. The owners wave you to sit yourself at a table when you come into the restaurant, drop off the menus once you're seated and promptly give you the bill when you're close to finishing.\n\nLunch time today was pretty busy so there were a lot of workers who seem to be from the area and neighborhood locals getting a bite to eat.\n\nIn a pinch when I have a strong urge for Vietnamese food, I'd come back to Pho Vietnam. Otherwise, I probably would want to try somewhere else where the dishes have more flavor and are less expensive.", "author": "Joanna T."}

I can also pick out certain ingrediemts easier since there's no broth to hide them. This dish has a lot of protein in it with the ground turkey and seafood. \n\nAs for the bun bo hue, no surprises with this dish, your typical spicy soup dish.\n\nThere are a bunch of options and i intend on trying their raw beef dish because it looks so flavorful in the photo.\n\nRestrooms are for customers only but they tend to get a lot of random walk ins from foot traffic on the strip.", "author": "Laura Y."}

Won't be back - I'd rather walk a few more blocks than to waste stomach space and eat below average pho.\n\nAt around $11 for a bowl of pho, Pho Vietnam isn't exactly a cheap bowl of pho. I ordered the brisket and rare flank (asked for it on the side) pho and though the portion was sizeable, the flavor left something to be desired. The broth tasted very fatty but lacked both the beefy flavor and herbal notes I wanted from pho. They gave a lot of meat, but I prefer quality over quantity...\n\nWith a good bowl of pho, I never add any condiments (hoisin/sriracha/lime/jalapeno) into my broth because I want to conserve the original flavor. But here I found myself giving up on trying to find goodness in the broth and just dumped everything in. \n\nOh AND I found a bug in my soup.

If you want good quality Vietnamese food then please go elsewhere.\nThis place was big enough to fit our group of 11 people, but they didn't seat us at tables next to each other or move tables together. One table got all their food and were practically done eating before the other table received their food.\nI got Bun Bo Hue which lacked in flavor and the noodles were cut up into 2-3 inch length pieces...I definitely prefer my noodles being long and normal length.

The broth is just YUM!! Not only is it super flavorful but the broth somehow magically stays the perfect hot temperature the whole time! Growing up, my sister and I were always taught that food has to be piping hot when served and to remain hot while you eat it. This both is exactly this!! Such a minor thing but huge in my book. \n\nI highly recommend getting the #7 pho dac biet. Not only does it have all the fixings including tendon and tripe (YAASSSS) but it is practically double in size compared to a regular bowl of pho for only a $1 more! Talk about a deal!\n\nI love the Vietnamese ice coffee here as well. I love that it comes still dripping into the condensed milk and that you have to stir the coffee and condensed milk before pouring it over ice. Any food/drink that I can interact with is a win in my book.\n\nThis is my go to spot for when I'm craving some noodle soup. The hardest part is limiting myself and not going every day!!", "author": "Sabrina D."}

In this case, Jamie W. and I just took the California Street cable car over Nob Hill and jumped off at Polk to get here. Thank goodness, as the pho at Pho Vietnam is merely decent. What makes the difference between great and middling pho is the broth. Turtle Tower, at least the original one on Larkin, does it right, while others not so much. I'd put this pho in the middle of the pack. Good enough to slurp but not enough to remember for a return visit.\n\nPart of the problem is that the waitress refuses to crack a smile here. Not sure why the frown, but it made us feel like we were being sent to our room for our supper. Things started on a promising note with the $3 half order of the Vietnamese Spring Rolls (Goi Cuon) which were crispy-fresh with the standard combo of shrimp, lettuce and vermicelli noodles accompanied by a thick, dark peanut sauce (see photo). What was weird was that I thought I ordered the full portion for the both of us to share, but we let is pass since more food was coming. Jamie felt he took a wrong turn with an order of the $8.75 Grilled Pork with Imperial Rolls (Com Thit Nuong, 3 Cha Gio), which turned out to be blandly generic in flavor and execution (see photo).\n\nHe also went for the small $3.50 bowl of Beef Ball Soup (Chen Bo Vien) but couldn't quite get over the rubbery texture of the balls for reasons that were all too clear (see photo). So I was the one that went for the pho, the big $8.25 bowl of Pho Dac Biet with all the meat fit to eat - the rare steak, the well done flank, the brisket, the tendon, the tripe and the beef balls (yes, me too...) And of course, it came with the thin vermicelli noodles, the snap-ready bean sprouts, the basil, the lemon wedges, and the pepper slices (see photo). Everything was there that you would expect from a combo bowl of pho, but the beef broth was just too diluted to lend any flavor impact. That was the most disappointing aspect to my dish, and uncharacteristically, I left most of the broth in my bowl. Oh well, it was worth a shot. And please smile, will ya?\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling Vietnamese fare would put it somewhere near the DMZ, wouldn't it?\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...large, sunny space but...\nSERVICE - 2 stars...unhappy, unsunny people serve here\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I'd walk a mile for good pho, so I better keep walking to Little Saigon", "author": "Ed U."}

Nope, not this lady.\n\nA bowl of fishcakes with 2 tiny shrimps and 2 pieces of squid were presented to me with the tiniest amount of brown noodles. Brown noodles? In pho?

For some reason, I instinctively took the roots in my hand and started snapping them off like I was in the kitchen of a Korean restaurant making appetizers again. \n\nOverall, this place blows.

Once I finally get her attention and show her the culprit, she asks me if I'm vegetarian... [Umm, we went over this quite well when we first met, I thought?] So I say yes, to which she clarifies, \"So no meat at all?\" I reply, \"Yes, for 10 years.\" It is at this point that our brief staring contest begins. She is just silent. No apology, no offering to get me a new bowl of soup, nothing. She just stood there. To break the awkward moment I slide my bowl toward her edge of the table and politely say, \"Okay... Well, I'm done with this now.\" And she just walks away and leaves my bowl. Only to return several minutes later with our check--that also did not show any sign of courtesy by perhaps having a discount on my meal that I didn't even get to fully enjoy. \n\nSo I left feeling robbed. $10 [yes, I still tipped her] for a half-eaten bowl of vegetable soup and the hopes of not getting stomach pains later from meat contamination. \n\nBut what really sucks--for them and for me--is that I knew I wanted come back to try their curry once I saw how beautiful our soups were.

Conveniently located on Polk Street between California and Pine, Pho Vietnam is the perfect place to stop in for a quick bite when running errands or carry-out after work. Their Pho has also been known to magically cure hangovers and the flu, like all good Pho should. \n\nPho Vietnam is open everyday from 10am -10pm and run by a nice family who seem to always be at the restaurant. The service is friendly and the food is served fast. The restaurant is minimally decorated and screams neighborhood gem. I don't think the interior has been updated since the restaurant was first opened sometime in the 80's (or at least that's what decade the decor is from). The photos on the walls of different palces in Asia are good eye candy and quite entertaining if you've traveled there before. \n\nThe Pho really is fantastic. My favorite is the chicken broth base the beef broth is a close second. Each Pho comes with a bountiful side dish of bean sprouts, mint, jalapenos, and lemon slices.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-07-09", "description": "2.5/5\n\n\"Good enough\" pretty much captures the essence of the Pho and of this restaurant. \n\nThe atmosphere is clean and functional, you get in, sit down, and order fairly quickly. The service lacks warmth, but is prompt. \n\nI ordered a standard beef pho, it was delivered rather quickly. This place is a bit odd in that they only have one size, and that all pho of that size is about $7.25 ($7.94 after tax) -- the size is moderate, a little smaller than most places mediums and a little larger than most places smalls. However, most places mediums are at or below this price, which makes this not the best value in the world. They get 2.5 stars for the portions.\n\nThe beef is averagely cut -- the knifework at both Pho 2000 and Pho Tan Hoa is better, but the cut is a bit above Turtle Tower. The quality of the meat is okay, but it was not particularly memorable, and the portions were a little light (partially because the bowl itself was not very generous). They get 2.5 stars for beef.\n\nThe broth could have been a bit hotter, and was a bit light on the flavor, probably bit heavy on star anise or cinnamon, and it doesn't really capture all the flavor of the beef. It was alright.  They get 2.5 stars for the broth. A star is then deducted because I saw a hair in my broth. No, I don't think it ruins or pollutes the pho in and of itself, but it hints at less than professional cooking, and heightened the \"less than average\" overall experience of the visit.\n\nI didn't try any of the drinks -- when I go to have pho, I usually only get pho, no spring rolls, no frills, no detours-- straight to business. So, this review doesn't comment on those.\n\nIt's not great, it's not amazing, it's not spectacular, but it is definitely \"good enough\".\n\nWhile it would get 2 stars, I will give it 2.5 for a very simple reason -- the hours. It's open until 10 and it's near me. Most other good pho places close early (as they are in the TL) so this means when I get a random 9pm craving for pho, and nothing else will work -- I have this. So that's something.\n\nI'll check out a lot of other places and give this place another go in the future to see if it was just a bad night.", "author": "David H."}

Upon entering you see this very cafeteria like atmosphere with unflattering lighting, numbered tables, and there were only 2 other people sitting down.  A little skeptical at first, but sat it out.  Started with the imperial rolls which were good, a little greasy for my liking though.  We both just got rare steak pho for our entrees, and when they brought out the acoutrements we knew we were in for an experience.  There was a large pile of sprouts, a quite skimpy basil selection, some jalapenos and 2 lemon slices.  The veggies seemed a bit tired, not the fresh delicious ones I'm used to.  And lemon??  I guess I don't know what is authentic but I'm used to limes and this just caught me off guard.  \n\nOn to the soup.  One size fits all, and also a bit more expensive than you'd expect.  The broth was alright... it had a hint of something I'm not really used to and didn't really hit the spot.  Lets just say that I wasn't drinking the remaining broth after finishing the solid goods in the bowl as usual.  The meat was subpar as well, it was pretty tough and there was also a shortage of total meat supplies in both of our bowls.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-11-29", "description": "there are a few things that makes a good bowl of pho; the broth, the noodle, the meats, and lastly the green basil. My biggest gripe was the noodle, it was way overcooked and too soft. I forgot to taste the broth before adding my sauces, so i can't give an honest opinion. They skimmed out on the meat combination, so i was left with mostly overcooked noodle (which cost next to nothing). Another biggest thing that disappoint was the basil. Most people don't know this but the basil isn't just a garnish, it's what makes 1/3 of the pho flavor. The basil should be fresh and abundant as possible. It's the small things like this that show if they have any consideration at all.\nThe basil was wilted and seems like ready to be thrown out. Considering they are the only pho in the nob hill/van ness area, i wouldn't come back if i have a choice. The service was also only okay.

Ok, it still sucks.\n\nWhy would anyone eat here when Little Saigon is a few crack infested blocks away? I have to say I was extremely confused about all the great reviews on this place.\n\nThe super basic \"Fresh Spring Roll\" was not fresh in the slightest. The bean sprouts were brown and tasted rotten, the smell was so bad I couldn't bring it to my face. The shrimp? Well I won't even go  there... and the rice paper was most definitely not homeade.\n\nThe Pork and Vermicelli bowl was so salty, I had to assume it was covering up something.

Just because it is in the nicer part of town, doesn't mean you should waste your time. Grab the pepper spray and brave Little Saigon. Its well worth it over this joint.\n\nAnd as a final note, the service was atrocious. I don't know if they just hate gays or what, but we were super polite and quiet, non-demanding and appreciative... yet they practically threw our food at us.

All it takes is for me to see something from Vietnam, or to look at someone eating soup, or to see a pair of chopsticks for Christ sake  and the seed is planted and I'm screwed. The idea of this soup crawls around my head until it gets what it wants. It literally has a mind of its own so I'm really not kidding when I say I take my Pho seriously. So seriously I'm telling you now, find somewhere else to get it than this place. Ouch, I know. I'm sorry, but I have to tell you exactly why this place should only be a last resort when you wanna feed that noodle soup addiction.\n\nIn my neighborhood, Pho Vietnam is the only Pho place within walking distance (that I know of at least, and believe me we've looked). I know people say that you can go down into the TL and try Turtle Tower, but that is a completely different kind of Pho. That's a no plum sauce, no beef balls no anything I recognize Pho to be kinda place; you'll see that review soon from me I'm sure. Pho Vietnam is where you go when you have no bus money, no cab money, no gas, no car, no friends with a car, no bike, no scooter, no skateboard, no unicycle to go to Kevin's in the Sunset or Pho Garden in the Richmond. You go here if it's been a while and you forgot how much it sucks so you give it a second or a third chance and get beat right back down again. Sure it suffices for a hot bowl of soup on a cold, foggy SF day, but have some standards! You can always go heat up a cup of water at home!\n\nWhat makes a good Pho place (as many of you know) is the broth. This place has some seriously bland broth. It's missing some spices or something. I made broth at home for Pho and it tasted better alone than theirs will ever. It's like they took a little Hetch Hetchy and splashed some anise pods in there and called it broth. The meat is super tough, like it's the cheapest they could buy and it just tastes sloppy and watered down. The portion size is wonderful, but when you don't really want to eat what's in front of you what's the point in handing me a giant bowl of it? Their appetizers are so-so as well. They don't taste home made, in fact they taste like they bought it at Trader Joe's in the frozen section or something. But every time we go here, we have forgotten how much they suck and always end up ordering the imperial rolls as a swift reminder not to get them again. Man we are suckers for convenience. \n\nThe restaurant itself is really not that nice. Everything is a little outdated and with the Florescent lighting it always looks some kind of dirty in there. The staff is nice enough, in fact they're getting two stars only because of the location and their staff. I've never had a problem with any of them it's just the recipe that sucks. Kinda a big thing to have suck but its true!\n\nAnyways, we used to eat here all the time not knowing that what we were having was an inferior noodle soup. If you are a super fan of this place than more power to you my friend, but I BEG OF YOU, try Pho Garden or Kevin's, just to see that for a cheaper price you can get a bowl of Pho that makes you feel like a kid again. The right broth and meat cuts make me feel like I'm wrapped in a giant blanket snuggling on the couch and I'm playing hooky for the day watching movies in the rain. It's so good, its that kind of good. This place just doesn't give me that feeling, ever...and honestly I don't think it ever will.", "author": "Sarah L."}

Since we were running out of time, we decided to try it.  We ordered the spring rolls and I had the number 10 pho with rare steak and flank steak.  I didn't really like the flank so next time I will order pho with rare steak only.  Unlike other pho restaurants I've been to, they only had one size and it is a really big portion.  They also don't have this pancake appetizer that I've been craving.  (I've only tried it at this place on Larkin and Sutter but that closed down and it is now a Mexican restuarant,).

Asian noodle soups always have a bit of lovely, tasty fat floating on the top, if it doesn't, it's neither authentic or good.\n\n  Is it the BEST Vietnamese food ever? No. Is it really damn tasty? Hell yes. I've been to other Vietnamese places in my area by Chinatown and have had vastly inferior versions of various Vietnamese dishes, so I don't understand all the negatives about this place. Maybe there are places out in La Mission that I need to try, but whatever, this is still a great lunch spot.\n\n  No matter which soup you get, the broth is really flavorful and delicious. The pho broth is not a deep brown color (which means they don't use beef base), but still has great depth of flavor. Yeah, the toppings are pretty damn skimpy, particularly when it comes to seafood, but that seems to be the norm in SF, you can't get away from it. The broth has so much flavor that I'll forgive them for being like everyone else in town and getting chintzy with the toppings.\n\n  The spring rolls are also very good. Lately they have had a special grilled pork spring roll that had marinated grilled pork slices, green apple, crispy won ton-like pieces, lettuce, mint and cilantro in it with the obligatory peanut dipping sauce. Was it authentic? Probably not, but it was really damn good.\n\n  Also their Cafe Sau Da is the best I've ever had. I totally jones for it.

New Experience Tastiness - I LOVE curries, but many of them lack a certain depth of spiciness that I usually only find in a handful of Indian eateries. This curry had the consistency of soup, rather than a thick-ish sauce (which was a new phenomenon for me...I KNOW!...sheltered life!) and it was SO GOOD. It was spicy (but not too spicy), with bits of chicken breast nicely seasoned. Went well with rice, as all curries should.\n\n3. Speedy Tastiness - Dinner came quick. Very quick.

The place is bigger than most and seats a good amount. Theres a was about 3 tables already dining in after we came in so we expected service to be on point. I already knew what I wanted but I like to browse through the menu and see whats special about this place and the variety they offer. Nothing too out of the ordinary but its a good selection for what it is. The service was a little slow and it took some time to get someones attention. They didn't seem so friendly with us and just kinda took our order and forgot about us. Food took about 10min, all in minutes after each other. Which was questionable because we all order the same thing. Im not usually one to complain but most places have a big old cauldron of soup boiling back there so pho is usually up in a minute or so. The pho was not bad, but not the best that'll have me coming back for more. The broth was a little light than flavorful, there was a good amount of noodles but there was hardly any meat. Of course I ate it all but I've had better pho other places and nothing compares to some San Jose pho! After finishing, they cleared the table and I told the waitress we were done. We waited again, thinking they would come back with the check but we had to flag them down for it. Upon receiving the check the guy stood at the table waiting for us to pay. Have a little courteously and let us figure out our money without someone starring at us uncomfortably. I know asian restaurants are not best on service but I know they got some common sense.

Popular reasons/ excuses I can think of off the top of my head: illness, hangovers, lack of funds, super duper hunger, cold weather, sore throats, dental issues, exposing a wimp to something new/ familiar. So yeah, hooray for pho in general. \n\nI'm erring for 4 stars because although it's a solid three and a half establishment, turns out its a popular establishment for solo diners therefore I can justify the extra half star. I came here at around 8 o'clock on a Saturday and at least half the occupied tables were taken up by parties of one (myself included) dining on big bowls of pho. \n\nSpeaking of the pho, it was above par but not as inexpensive as plenty of other similar establishments throughout the entire Bay Area. The menu offers a nice selection of pho, including a vegetarian pho that's serving size is larger than most fishbowls I've owned and basic broth and noodles, which I'm sure could come in handy on a horrific first post flu day. I got a #13, which had a healthy amount of a steak throughout it. The noodles needed a healthy spear chucking session (yet another feeble attempt at using chopsticks) to be separated before consumption. Actually I'm glad I was by myself because after adding all the sprouts, chili, pepper, lemon (no lime) and salt to my heart's desire, my bowl looked like a mini operating table with chopsticks, a fork and drowning spoon as my clumsy instruments of terror. The portion size was good for the quality of the ingredients but not as big as some small servings in the South Bay. Still, it was nice to leave the establishment contently full instead of  \"oh geez, I'm going pop\" bloated. I did take a peek at several other tables orders of the popular imperial rolls and made a mental note to come back and try them.\n\nThe interior is modest but bright and clean inside. The service is quick and I don't think I saw a single table wait more than ten minutes for food to start coming out. I had a couple of members of the waitstaff ask if I liked my meal so that was a nice touch to my filing meal.

I am addicted to their food, the staff is very neighborhood friendly, and everything is consistent.  I eat here about once a week (have only ordered the chicken pho) and crave it probably more.  The pho on the streets of Vietnam was good and this makes me feel pretty darn close to it.", "author": "J N."}

I usually only get the regular pho with rare steak and the fresh spring rolls which are AMAZING!!! So that is the only thing I can speak of. good if you just wanna pick up they give you plenty of sriratchi sauce and the other brown sauce. The bean sprouts are always fresh.", "author": "Cynthia M."}

What else could go with Pho?  Pho Outback!  Pho Burger King!  But this is good Pho and lots of it at a great price.  Perfect for a cold SF day or night.  Also good are the grilled dishes--I recommend the grilled pork strips on vermicelli.  The grilled dishes come on a bed of lettuce and tiny cucumber bits with grated carrots on the side.  I know it sounds weird but try it.  I also like the big bowls of steamed rice that they give you for $1.\n\nAnd unlike lots of Vietnamese restaurants in this low price range, this place is clean clean.  I like that--I've had enough stomach pains and toilet runs from down-and-dirty places to last my lifetime.\n\nSo try Pho Vietnam.  Why not Vietnam Pho?  Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho........Chi Minh.  They beat our ass but they sure brought good food over here.", "author": "Murray S."}

When you crave pho, especially when you're having the worst hangover of your life, you want the pho to be done just right.

Must be because they don't have adequate ventilation in the back because the hall way to the bathroom and the bathroom itself feel like being in inside an oven.  \n\nThey actually have a computer register system.

Pho Vietnam helped me make that call for my current pad. Good, solid, pho. Not exceptional, but it hits the spot when you're craving a bowl of Pho Dac Biet with extra cilantro on the side, especially after a night of heavy drinking. The flavor of the broth tends to range from time to time- sometimes it's savory and packed full of flavor, other times it tends to be a little watered down. It's the folks that work here that keeps me coming back- they're friendly, quick, and appreciates their regulars. I have a crush on the grandmother (I call her Ma Vietnam) that works here, she is the most energized and feisty woman over 60 I've ever come across! Always hustling with a harassed expression on her face, she definitely keeps the show running. Thanks Ma Vietnam for all of the care you put into my pho!", "author": "Alice P."}

We passed by a well-lighted Pho joint that I haven't seen before.  We're always looking for a good Pho place in the City.  Since we're both hungry and thought that Pho will be quick, we decided to stop.  \n\nLooking into the restaurant, we were encouraged by the number of occupied tables at around 7PM.  We ordered, the Goi Cuon (Spring rolls) for 2 and a bowl of Pho Tai (rare beef) and an order of Bun Cha Hanoi.  The food took a lot longer than we anticipated.  The Goi Cuon was adequate, but the bean sprouts were brownish, probably sat around for too long. I took out the sprouts and ate it anyway, hate to waste food.  Then came my bowl of Pho Tai, the broth was a little sweet and a bit heavy on the star anise for my taste, I would rate it a 2 out of 5, not a total disaster, but I wouldn't go back here for Pho.  Next is the Bun Cha Hanoi, which is a northern specialty - grilled pork with vermicelli dish, if done the right, this dish is heaven.  However, Pho Vietnam butchered this dish in a way that I've never seen or tasted before, anywhere.  The broth of fish sauce was way too salty, the meat was pinkish (unrecoqnizable), they put some kind of cabbage in the broth that's too weird to describe.  We tried 2 pieces of meat and left the rest alone.  The older waitress came by and asked why we didn't eat, my better half flashes her a smile, then she asked if we wanted to take it home, again another smile, the waitress looked puzzled, but took our plates away.  We paid our bill and left the Pho Vietnam for our intended destination, Nick's Tacos where we should have been in the first place.", "author": "Kevin T."}

I've gotten the bun with shrimp here a number of times when in a pinch and every time I leave thinking I'm not coming back.  The noodles always seem a little too sticky, and the whole dish is a little too greasy and sweet.  Also not a fan of the fried onions they top it with.  On the positive side, the servings are huge.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-12", "description": "Pho Vietnam serves authentic, delicious, cheap Vietnamese food.\n\nI go to Pho Vietnam not for their pho, which I've only tried once and would give 3.5.  The broth and noodles were good, but I wasn't too sure about the beef in the pho tai.  Perhaps I'll try it again when I have a hankering for pho.\n\nInstead, I've tried several other dishes (generous portions) that are delicious and upon which I base the 5-star rating.\n#6 chicken salad (goi ga):  Fresh veggies (mainly uncooked cabbage, not lettuce) with fried shallots, ground peanuts, and boiled chicken.  Add some red chili to the fish sauce (nuoc mam) and then pour that over the salad.\n#29 spicy noodle soup (bun bo hue): Thicker rice noodles, beef (I think brisket), and tendon in a spicy broth.\n#17 wonton noodle soup (mi hoanh thanh):  You get at least half a dozen wontons filled with pork.  In addition, the broth contains thin slices of pork and ground pork.\n#31 grilled shrimp over vermicelli (bun tom nuong):  Pretty generous # of shrimp over cold, thin rice vermicelli noodles.  Don't forget to pour the fish sauce (nuoc mam) over the shrimp and noodles.\n#32 pork shish-ke-bab with rice (com thit nuong):  The pork isn't really in the form of a shish-ke-bab, but that's not the point.  It is very well-seasoned in the manner that \"thit nuong\" should be.  If you feel so inclined, try ordering the fried egg with this or any other of the rice dishes that feature pork.\n\nI also like that soft drinks are served from a fountain rather than from a can, and you get a large glass.\n\nThe restaurant isn't located with most of the other Vietnamese restaurants in the heart of the Tenderloin, so I don't feel uneasy eating here at all.  Service is fast and friendly.  The decor is not anything to remark about except that it's very clean.", "author": "N C."}
