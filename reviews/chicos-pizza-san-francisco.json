I ordered a pizza that should be half cheese and half with a toppings of Canadian bacon and pineapple. That cost about $14 and some change. But you guys gave me a WHOLE Hawaiian pizza. A whole Hawaiian pizza cost about $16.50 if I got that right. But I wanted just half of it yet you didn't give me what I ordered.\n\nI also ordered a mozzarella sticks. It was slightly warm. Not sure if that should be enough reason why my mozzarella aren't soft anymore.

Now, if you're buying more than two slices of pizza, I recommend buying a whole pizza because you'd get a better value for your money. Depending on the pizza you get, you pay $5-$6 per slice; whereas a whole large combination pizza is $23. A whole pizza offers about the same slice size comprised of about 8 pieces. And no joke, these slices are LARGE. Equivalent to Shaquille O'Neal's hand. \n\nIt's better to pay cash rather than card because they do charge a dollar fee.\n\nDelivery is available if you don't want to venture into skid row. \n\nPizza here is really tasty if you enjoy thick crust pizza. Made fresh daily. Open super late too. For you late night munchers, find solace that this place stays open until 3am on Friday and Saturday, and midnight every other day of the week. \n\nHere's to being the Aladdin of pizza joints!", "author": "Ann S."}

During our time waiting, we witnessed several crazies come in and out of the place several times. At one point, one of the staff members had to raise his voice at a lady who was going all crazy and yelling weird things. I felt bad for them, being that this area is filled with homeless and mentally ill people. This area borders Tenderloin and is definitely a social economically depressed area of SF. At night time you can only imagine it gets worse, and that's when we were here. \n\nThey made our wings in a timely manner and provided several small ranch containers for us. The wings were honestly very basic and didn't have much flavor, but since we had the drunk munchies, they probably were better than we thought they were. \n\nI wish we had tried the pizza, but I give credit to these guys who have to endure all the BS that goes on in the neighborhood with the local bums coming in and starting a raucous. \n\nProbably won't be back anytime soon, but this place is worth a shot if it's late and you're craving some pizza and a show!", "author": "Andrew P."}

I've been ordering from Chico's for at least 15 years .  I always order delivery but tonight I was walking home and figured I would stop in .  They guys are the same ones that worked there for years and they recognized me all was good.  Placed my order .  True like my previous review the neighborhood which is bad has gotten much worse .  Can't blame them. A long 30 min sitting inside and got my food said bye guys and went home upon arriving I noticed that the pizza that was given to me was not what I ordered at all .  I always order the chicos special with extra meat,  Well what  I got was a cheese pizza with a few pepperonis on .  Mistakes happen so I called down there .  Told the guy on the phone what happened he told me i was wrong ? I know what's in front of me he says hold on .  I can hear him taking orders and doing. His job and let the phone just lay on the counter 7 min goes by he picks up the line and acts as if he is hearing this for the first time . I explained again and he was not listening to me because he kept saying what was that again. He puts me on hold again and 3 min of listening to him help other customers I just hung up .  I've been going there a long time and i even gave them a decent tip and I picked it up !

Then we see Mike standing in the corner, and she drops her camera and it keeps rolling. Remember that classic freak-out scene? I think that would be a typical evening at Chico's Pizza, only nobody would pay attention since you're more than likely to hear somebody screaming on that adventuresome block of 6th Street anyway. I guess I must be Mike in this allegory since I took my life into my own hands, walked briskly from Mission and decided to get a $5 slice of anything. I pointed at the Pepperoni Pizza (photo: http://bit.ly/1bdF0Ow) and smiled nervously, even though the staff here is amazingly cordial.\n\nWhat I thought was semi-amusing is that I didn't ask for it to go, but they packaged it up in a box anyway figuring I wanted to get the hell out of Dodge. No, I like to live on the edge and decided to eat it at the empty counter toward the back wall. That was me standing in the corner. Did the Blair Witch possess me and make me wait to be murdered? Not really. The pizza was searingly hot and pretty good really. Thin crust, plenty of pepperoni and cheese. Four-star good?

This place is always packed and has a good deal on slices. Will even make slices to order if you take out. Their spinach salad is a staple and a healthy size for the price!\n\nIf you're getting delivery, be sure to get ground sausage on the pizza. De-lish! No experience with their other offerings. I get pizza from a pizza place, theres a sandwich shop practically next door if I want a sandwich(also by the name of Chico's). \n\nI never understand the people who go to an X restaurant and order Y&Z just to complain. If they were a sandwich shop, their name would be Chico's Pizza and Sandwiches. But it's just Chico's Pizza, it's yummy, but keep it simple.\n\nTip about the Neighborhood:  If you know anything about 6th street, this will fall on deaf ears, but if you're unfamiliar with the area don't: look around like ur lost, leave ur belongings unattended or do anything else that would otherwise make you look like a walking target. Walk like u know where ur going and dont be afraid to smile and say \"sorry\" if asked about something you dont want to pay attention to. Don't stop walking and don't entertain getting a \"deal\" from someone on the street. Unless you a dude that actually has street smarts, its just easier this way.", "author": "Sasha G."}

This is the kind of cheapie place you go as a bachelor because you don't have any food in the house and want a sandwich or slice of pizza. \n\nI just got a sandwich there for the third time and want to be very clear about what these folks fail to do. The menu says the sandwich comes with lettuce, tomato and onion (and jalapano although I can live without that). First time I order one, it was prepared with none of those. Hmm, well ok, I was hungry and whatever. The second time I ordered a sandwich I made a point of asking for the lettuce, tomato and onion since I really enjoy a sandwich with those things. However, on getting home there were none of those things. Tonight, and maybe it's my fault for continuing to go to this lousy place, I once again ordered a sandwich and asked with what I thought was a loud and clear voice for lettuce tomato and onion  On my way home I thought maybe I should look and see if they managed to put those simple things on my sandwich and of course they did not. I walked back and pointed this out to them and they stood around like a bunch of idiots as though they had never even thought that making a sandwich the way the menu offers or the way the customer requested was something a restaurant might do. Naturally I will not go back a fourth time and neither should you.", "author": "Sean F."}

It's 24/7, which is great... because I. WAS. HUNGRY!!!!!!!!!  \n\nI was pissed off because 3 guys walking in before me and one of them was one of those indecisive mofos that sits there going \"uuuuuhhhhh... ummm...\" for like 10 minutes. So his friends ordered real quick. This gave me time to decide want I wanted: Pepperoni, and the Supreme one with bell peppers sausage, pepperoni, and all that. \n\nSo Now I'm hungry and even this guy's friends are like \"Come one man just decide....\" and the two guys behind the counter are like \"Just decide.... please we have other customers waiting...\" So finally it was my turn and I ordered and I got the pizza slices (which are huge by the way), and a Snapple.I like the fact all the drinks are in the fridge and they are ICE COLD.  It came out to a little under $10, so the young man said, I' going to add the $23 cents to make it an even $10. At first I was \"Huh?\", but then I was like whatever... plus I understand and most places have limits anyways... and businesses get charged for every card transaction so...whatever.  If that bothers you, pay cash. :) But I brought $4 with me on this whole trip, lol. \n\nThe pizza was hot and I could've even stayed to eat and watch tv on a booth but I just decided to take my food and enjoy it in my room across the street. :)\nIt came in a cute little pizza box and when I got back to my room and sat on the bed and ate that pizza, and drank that ice cold Snapple I was in heaven. The cheese was very gooey and good. It is not the healthiest... I mean it is pizza! But it really hit the spot, so thank you Chico's pizza. \n\nAnd... why are people complaining about the neighborhood. I'm getting tired of it on every page that belongs to a SOMA business.

Whether you are trying to just buy a quick slice to go, a whole pizza, or even a full pizza, sandwhich, salad, desert, and a drink for a party Kaleel is the pizza king with a wonderful set of staff that always will come through to make a masterpiezza worthy of being placed into a museum of beautiful pizza. Not only is the pizza made by true artists, but the quality of the ingredients are top quality. Finally the most important quality is the dough and crust, which comes out crispy on the outside, puffed up to a huge easy to hold size, holds the pizza together great, and is soft and fluffy on the inside with the most delicious crust taste.\n\nI usually just get a pepperoni slice, but if I want something really dank I pay the extra to add extra pepperoni to end up with those crispy delicious pepperonis. I might even add salami on top too. The chicos special is quite a delicious combo, but I am a bit finicky and don't eat the veggies. When I get a whole pizza I order Eat24 and get the X-large three topping special with pep, salami, and mushroom asking for more pep than salami and more meats than mushroom. The pizza always comes out beautiful and bomb especially after I do the final touch adding herbs, parm, salt & pepper, and finally adding just a touch more of herbs that I let sit and become cooked in, melted, and delicious.\n\nThis place is also just a great spot for the community. Sixth street is not the nicest of areas yet that doesn't stop chicos from being a place with wonderful atmosphere. Besides Kaleel and the rest of the friendly staff making sure that your experience is the best it can be in what little space they have available to work with. Surprisingly there is somehow space for a bathroom for customers if needed and the store itself is decorated with sports memorabilia as well as chicos pizza history.

And I am not speaking of the thin anorexic-crusted scantily dairy-clad versions of this Italian favorite.  \n\nI'm speaking fondly of the thick Chicago style, robust and Pavarotti powered with a crisp and crunchy crust, prim on the outside, but busty and loud on the inside with a slightly sweet and fluffy consistency in the bread.  The toppings here are large and not handed out with the Capitalist-anal-conservatism in mind.  Quite the opposite.\n\nI usually order the combination, which comes loaded with pepperoni, thick clusters of Italian sausage, mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, and black olives.  This large slice comes with the easily affordable price of $3.00.  I usually then sprinkle red chili pepper flakes and a lot of Parmesan cheese.  My boyfriend has tried their Hawaiian slice and it was a gooey but lovely mess of melting cheese, thick slices of Canadian bacon and the entire savory piece rounded by the sweet chunks of pineapple.\n\nThe counter staff have been the same persons for the past several months and each time, service has been quick and friendly.  I always ask for a knife and fork since these pieces are too thick and bulky for the Victorian priss in me to not open my mouth like a basking shark walking down the street the Off Market theater, but then again, not much needs to be shaped by table side courtesies since I walk by an Adult video store on 6th and the Thai massage parlor on Mission.\n\nQuestionable neighborhood once the light fades, so if you can make it there before 7:00, grab your cheap but tasty slice by the crust.

I admit that I only order from them via delivery but I have entered the place at least once or twice.\n\nThe first time was when they still had the arcades. I remember losing all of my quarters from Street Fighter. The employees are nice and they're really committed to giving their customers a quality pizza. One slice and I was hooked.\n\nA second time was when they moved to a much cleaner place, albeit, smaller than the last one. It was also not too far from where they originally where. I mean, literally, they were like a crosswalk away from each other. The pizza is still fresh and delicious.\n\nNow, ordering from them is simple. They have a website up and you can pretty much pick out what you like and make a list of what you want to order. Just give them a call and they'll prepare it for you just the way you like it. I've tried their pizzas and calzones and I never get tired of it. But you must try their wings! That's the kicker of this review. I enjoy their hot wings and they don't kid about that stuff. It's seriously THAT good.\n\nI must have ordered from them at least a dozen times within the past two years. I believe that they keep track of their phone orders so that it could be quicker to process. The employees are friendly and courteous. It also helps that their delivery time is right on the spot, sometimes maybe even earlier.\n\nPros:\n* Variety of pizza selections and other menu items (calzones, salad, sandwiches)\n* HOT WINGS\n* Friendly employees\n* Convenient prices\n\nCons:\n* Might be a difficulty for those not nearby Downtown\n* Small place to eat and chill\n\nSo if you're looking for a quick bite to eat, try this place out.

I called Chico's from Yerba Buena island and asked for a delivery to which they replied, \"Please call back at 8pm.\". That was all they had to say.  So, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and called back at 8pm, 2 hours later. Thankfully the friends I was with had some snacks.  The same Chico's employee answered the phone, somehow immediately recognized my number and told me they were not delivering to the island any longer that night.  I guess that was all he had to tell me so he hung up. I've heard that their calzones are great, just not on Saturday nights when you're on the island.

At my former place of employment we were buried deep in the bowels of Hayes Valley.  Now don't get me wrong, I love this location, but the food selection is kinda of slim there. After suffering uncountable gastro-intestinal tragedies from the $10 hamburgers at Flippers or realizing that living for 2 years off of food bought from the corner store, one tends to turn to delivery for their at work dining options. \nSo one day I wander in to work and find a Chico's menu sitting on the door. I ignore it. I don't know who Chico is, but I'm betting he can't make pizza for shit. \nWeeks later a co-worker finds the same menu that someone had brought inside and orders up a pizza. Two hours later the pizza arrives. I'm starving by this time so when I taste the luke-warm pizza it doesn't really surprise me that it's good. I had been eating paper 20 minutes earlier to try to leech some vitamins out of it and that tasted great too. \nWe order again a few days later. Or maybe it was the next day. We like pizza a lot and we're don't care about our health. Anyways. This time it shows up in about an hour but it's still hot. This is when I realize that this pizza is just like I like my women - never showing up on time, comes for under $20 and is covered in warm cheese. \nAfter ordering from this place tons of times I realized that I only ever see one guy delivering the food. So I ask him about it and it turns out that they only have one delivery person. Yes, one. So that explains the taking for fucking ever to get there thing. \n\nGood, cheap pizza delivery.

Rather than disposing of it like I do with other pizza crusts from other pizza places (*cough* Little Caesar's *cough*), I had to eat the whole thing. The blend of the ingredients is a good look if you like those ingredients. The prices of a slices range from $2.00 for cheese and $3.00 for the other ones. The prices or a whole pizza seems the same as in any other pizza place. The owner of the place seems pretty amicable even if the place closes late night and the location is in a place rampant with crackheads.
