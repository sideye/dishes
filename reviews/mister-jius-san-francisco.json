Usually I'm pretty skeptical of Asian fusion but this place proved to better than most other spots. Growing up Chinese , you eat tons of family dinners at Chinese restaurants and this place has a ton of familiar dishes. \n\nWe started off with the baked cha siu bao, it was very similar to Tim ho wans version with a crisp top and a ton of juicy char siu filling. If there's one thing to get, it's this bun! We also tried the mapo tofu and sad to say it was a sodium bomb, extremely salty and not really spicy at all. Stay away from this dish! We also tried the sea urchin cheorng fun and it was extremely silky, smooth and the sea urchin surprisingly went really well with it. The real star of the meal was their version of a Peking duck. It's a bit on the pricy side but it was extremely tasty, the skin was crisp and not too fatty. Unlike some Chinese restaurants they serve buns to go with it, you are given wrappers and bit of the foie gras makes it so delicious and decadent! My mouth is watering just thinking about that duck! \n\nWe ended dinner with a black sesame cake, it wasn't a dense cake, it was fluffy and had really good sesame flavor. It wasn't overly sweet nor was it too large. It was the perfect way to end a meal! \n\nOverall, we had a pretty decent dining experience minus the tofu. Other than that would definitely come here again for a casual dinner or for a special occasion!\n\nTotal for 2: $170", "author": "Stella J."}

Highlight of the dinner was the whole duck, absolutely a must! \n\nHighly recommend to anyone looking to try something new.

Their wine list is not expansive but has some good choices, such  as wine from Spain and Piedmont Italy. I tried the grignolino from Piedmont and it's delightful with a hint of floral. \nFoodwise, the tasting menu is divided into two sections, dim sum, then entree with fried rice. The dim sum is a bit disappointing, you can easily get better items from other dim sum places, and putting uni on cheong fung is not that technically difficult either, so I wasn't touched. The entree items are well executed, albeit common, dishes. \nFour star for the service.

Would not recommend. They don't make it easy for you to make your peking duck rolls/buns. Hard to share as well and the duck doesn't taste that great, pretty bland. For dessert, don't get the soy custard, i'm sure some of their other desserts would be better than this one that's quite bland.\n\nI'll definitely be back!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-23", "description": "3/3/18\n\nVery likely the very best \"traditional\" Chinese restaurant in America.  Yes, I realize \"best\" is super subjective, and you're probably questioning why I used the word \"traditional\" since clearly this is a high-end trendy restaurant...\n\nFirst off, \"best\" in this case means most carefully prepared, most complex, most imaginative and clever use of ingredients and techniques, yet managing to stay true to traditional flavors and ideas--think your favorite Chinese foods, or perhaps those extra special Chinese things you'd rarely find this side of the ocean, but all made more special, more complex, more delicate, and more beautiful than you'd find at a typical high-end Chinese seafood restaurant.  And of course excellence doesn't end with the food--as you'd expect from a Michelin star restaurant the service ie exemplary, and your surroundings would also be just as enticing.\n\nAnd so about \"traditional\"... sure, it's a trendy, modern restaurant, but that doesn't mean that they're making everything all \"fusion\" as you'd normally expect.  Exact opposite actually.  Every single dish we had was very clearly rooted in Chinese origins.  Typical \"fusion\" silliness like tacos and burgers, with ethnic ingredients substituted, you'd not find here--there's none of those \"cheap\" tricks.  Just traditional Chinese food, but made fit for Kings and Queens (and with somewhat affordable prices!)\n\nWe have another reservation coming soon, so I just want to present some of my old notes for now...\n\nThis menu was Year of the Dog themed:\n\n1. Happiness $13 \"gin, sour apple, gentian, jasmine tea, honey\":  The tea taste was very strong and took center stage, with alcohol supporting in complexity.  Subtle fruitiness.  Could be more balanced though.  7.5/10\n\n2. Year of Dog $13 \"rum, sesame, orange curacao, orgeat, pineapple, lime\":  It was kinda like a spiked lemonade with Chinese spices.  Maybe closer to a margarita.  7/10\n\n3. Liberty Farm Roast Duck (Half) $65 \"pancakes, peanut butter hoisin, cucumbers\":  It was the most extraordinary roast duck I've ever had; not the \"best tasting\" by my taste, but it was definitely the most carefully made and most complex.\n\nThe skin itself was drier than normal, and doesn't have that crisp savoriness.  I think maybe the duck was too lean, but my gf liked it.  Otherwise, aside from that, everything else was AMAZING.\n\nMy gf, who was from China, says the wrap was from a particular region as it differs from the typical steamed pancake.  The sauce was a ultra-reduced stock, to a silky consistency.  I also loved the ultra thin slivers of onion, and the pickles were great (my chef gf also noted the use of an ice bath was perfect.)  The pate was beautiful--the flavor was familiar but I could not place it.  Even the hoisin sauce was special--lighter yet with a fruitier plum taste.\n\nThe effort of it all was extraordinary (though perhaps not to my taste.)  9/10\n\n4. Potstickers $16 \"pork, fava leaves, black vinegar\": Unfortunately ours was inconsistent as one had thicker and hard skin, while another was more supple.  But neither had that great chewy and elastic skin.  The meat was a bit dry.  At least the flavor was good.  5/10\n\n5. Carrot 'Ma Jiang Mian' $17 \"mustard greens, chanterelle, sesame, bergamot\":  Interesting spin on noodles, which were thick and cooked to a perfect al dente.  I would say they could be chewier, more \"q q\" though.  There were lots of flavors though to keep it interesting.  8/10\n\n6. Chilled Beef Tendon $13 \"celery leaf, chili pepper crisp\"\n\n7. Hodo Tofu Skin $18 \"yellowfoot mushrooms, chives, cured egg yolk\":  Hands-down the craziest tofu skin I've ever had, out of thousands over my lifetime.  The bottom was silky, which the top was crunchy, and it was all so beautiful and loaded with flavor.  If I were picky though, I'd say it needs some more salt.  Definitely handmade, hence the extreme price.  9/10\n\n8. Steak Fried Rice $24 \"wagyu sirloin, crispy garlic, broccoli, tuna heart\":  The steak was ridiculously tender and juicy, and the fried rice was perfect.  Crap tons of flavors.  You want this.  9/10\n\n9. Eternity $13 \"vodka, gin, lillet, dill, crab oil\":  Gawd... amazing.  Even the frickin' olive was insane--hyper smoked, with like a beef jerky taste.  Tasted smoky as hell.  The liquid was ultra smooth, and that little drop of oil added so much savoriness.  So light.  So effervescent.  10/10\n\n8. Jian Dui $6 \"fried sesame balls, guava jam\": Kinda disappointing given how special the other dishes were.  This one tasted quite standard, except for that fruity middle.  The dough could be softer too.  4/10\n\n9. Bruleed Dan Tat $3 \"egg custard tart\": Okay, guessing dessert ain't their thing.  The crust was overly bready, and not like flaky and buttery.  It felt like mushy pie dough.  The custard itself was okay, a bit sweeter than normal.  3/10\n\nMmmmm.......... more to come... stay tuned for round 2!!!\n\n5/5\n\n#contemporarychinese #traditionalchinese #fancychinese #sanfrancisco #michelinstar", "author": "Dean C."}

The proteins and the carbs dominated this meal. Some dishes were innovative. Others took me straight back to when I was a child eating my mom's home cooked meals.\n\nReservations - 6:15PM Saturday. $69 for the tasting menu. \n\nCrispy Scarlet Turnip Cakes - Had the perfect amount of stiff, crisp texture at the end for perfectly shaped squares. Not much flavor, more about the texture.\n\nDutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns - Cinnamon bun with the small chunks of BBQ pork. It's more crunchy and sweet that the real thing. I loved the mixture of sweet and salty flavors.\n\nSea Urchin Cheong Fun - The urchin was harder to taste. The texture of the noodle roll was very good. Probably the best noodle roll I've had in terms of texture.\n\nSizzled Alaskan Halibut (oyster broth, summer squash, tatsoi, young ginger) - Brings me back to the fish I consumed during my childhood days at Chinese banquet restaurants. The fluffy fish crumbles nicely. The leeks and ginger were amazing. \n\nRoasted Wolfe Ranch Quail (sticky rice, MJ's lap cheong, cashew, figs) - The softest, most fatty, juicy, thick quail I've ever had. The sticky rice was a hearty compliment. \n\nSteak Fried Rice (wagyu skirt, crispy garlic, broccoli, tuna heart) - The best fried rice I've had in many years. Like the halibut, this dish transported me back to my childhood days. \n\nTendrils, Greens and Stems (meyer lemon, roasted garlic, smoked oyster) - Pass. Way too salty and greasy.\n\nLiberty Farm Roast Duck (pancakes, peanut butter hoisin, cucumbers) - A modern take on the traditional Peking duck dish. The combination of these ingredients made an amazing giant duck dumpling bun.\n\nAnnabelle's Choy Sum (black garlic) - Also too salty. Packed it to go. It was less salty as leftovers but more greasy.\n\nBlack Sesame Cake - Light and fluffy. Toppings were crunchy. Tastes bland at first but lingers in your mouth and stays. \n\nInterior - Gorgeous, yet not pretentious, floor-to-ceiling windows, open space, clean, and elegant. \n\nService - Excellent.

The restaurant was larger than expected and was decorated with Asian accents and mid century modern chairs. \n\nReading yelper's reviews we ordered:\n\nDutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns:  This was SO's favorite dish of the night. He's always been a fan of BBQ pork buns and this was crunchy, sweet and savory at the same time. I liked the crunchy bits on top.\n\nUni Cheong Fun: Regular cheong fun with bits of uni on top with soy sauce. I wished they had more soy sauce because the cheong fun is flavorless without it. But I liked the uni on top, it added a bit of creamy sweetness to the cheong fun. \n\nHot and Sour Soup (tomato based broth with fishcake and sliced cherry tomatoes): I thought this was just okay - hot and sour soup is always a good soup to savor but the tomato based broth somehow didn't work with this.\n\nGreen Beans with sliced turnip and bits of bacon:  I always like green beans, it had a kick to it and went well with the crunchy turnips and shallots.\n\nPotstickers (pork, fava leaves, black vinegar): I liked this, the flavorful skin was fried perfectly crispy and the temperature of the pork was nice and hot.\n\nSteak Fried Rice (wagyu skirt, crispy garlic, egg and scallions): I love fried rice and steak fried rice was something that was so comforting and delicious to me.\n\nAlaskan Halibut (oyster broth, bakchoy, zucchini, young ginger): I have always been a fan of steamed fish, and this did not disappoint. I loved the broth and the veggies made this super healthy. \n\nBlack Sesame Cake (black sesame cr\u00e9meux, ginger mousse, peanut, tamarind caramel): The one thing about Asian desserts is that they're not that sweet, and that's what I liked about this, it was moist and just a little bit sweet. \n\nFrozen Whipped Honey (pineapple sorbet, white chocolate): Pineapple sorbet was nice and light after eating so many plates. The whipped honey slices were crunchy which provided contrast to the sorbet.\n\nI didn't drink but SO said the drinks were really good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-30", "description": "Solo dining is so very different than dining with friends-- (1) there's way more time to contemplate the atmosphere and watch the dance that is waiters / waitresses serving patrons, (2) more time to think about the flavor in the food that you're eating, and (3) more opportunity to eat the food in a variety of manners to appreciate how food ordering may change food taste.\n\nThe closest comparison to this spot would probably be China Live on the other end of Chinatown. This spot is a bit closer to traditional Chinese cuisine-- focusing on only one regional cuisine (Cantonese), and using familiar presentation (e.g. BBQ pork buns or cheong fun (rice noodles)). Like China Live, the waitstaff is extremely racially diverse. Patrons were mostly non-Asian, though there were some Americanized Asians in the mix as well (being one myself). The views out of the windows were very reminiscent of NYC-- brick building facades.\n\nThe uni cheong fun (I noticed both waiters said this with the proper Cantonese intonation-- or as close as one might get) was tasty, if a bit soft. First, I tried the entire thing-- uni plus cheong fun, in one bite. The delicate flavor of the uni was entirely masked by the dense cheong fun. Next, I tried them separate. The uni was buttery and slightly salty, unlike sweeter uni I've had at Japanese spots-- I understand this was probably to match the savoriness of the dish. The cheong fun was limp and very moist. The soy sauce had orange and sesame oil in it (waitress told me that), but I really only tasted the sourness of the orange oil without any orange flavor. The sourness was a good contrast to the otherwise buttery and heavier nature of the dish. Arrived at a good temperature, though I wouldn't have complained if it were slightly hotter. 3.75/5\n\nPork buns arrived shortly after the cheong fun, and I had to do some mental calculus to figure out which I should eat first before everything got cold. I bit into the bun and found it to be steaming hot on the inside. Filling-wise, it could have used a bit more meat. When I ate the top independently, it was almost cookie-like in its crunchiness and sweetness. The bun on its own was unsweetened, so when blended together, provided a good level of sweetness. The bun was a bit thin for my tastes, though I admired that they were able to get the dough to be thin without falling apart. The bun was a bit dry for my tastes, but I think that went along with the thinness. The pork was only slightly sweet, mostly salted, and wasn't as sugary as other BBQ pork bun fillings I've had in the past. This was one of those dishes where all the ingredients are meant to be eaten in one mouthful. 3.75/5\n\nService was ever present, although there was a bit of pressure to order more (e.g. leaving the menu on the table, strongly recommending a look at the dessert menu). I would totally eat more, but as a single diner, there's only so much stomach room I have! Service was practiced polite (\"hope you have a lovely rest of the week\"-- with some struggle on word order), as opposed to a more heartfelt sort of polite, but I recognize this was one particular waiter only. Napkin was folded when I went to use the restroom. Would I come again? Only with a group of people who want to come, given the price point and necessity of sharing most dishes to make the experience worthwhile. \n\nRandom note: the bathrooms were so dark. I've been in dark bathrooms before, but I almost felt the need to turn on a flashlight in this one.\n\nI loved the attention to detail shown in the book selection in the bookcase, with nods to the the street they're on (Waverly / Joy Luck Club), as well as Bay Area food giants (Chez Panisse / Alice Waters, Bar Tartine Cookbook).", "author": "Nicole H."}

I liked the Prosperity a bit better, which was complex and fruity and had a beautiful ying yang on top.\nWagyu steak fried rice ($24): the best fried rice I have ever had. There were large chunks of tender steak inside, and the steak flavor was infused into the fried rice. Every bite was delicious with notes of garlic and egg.\nRoast duck (half for $65): this was amazing. Having just come back from Beijing, I had had very good Peking duck just several weeks earlier, but I think I like this duck better. The skin was super crispy and the meat was tender and flavorful. I like how they presented different parts of the duck - the breast, the leg, the wing, and the gizzard, and it came with pancakes, hoisin peanut sauce, fresh greens, and duck mousse. Making the pancakes was fun and the fresh greens helped cut the heaviness of the duck. We were completely stuffed though afterwards - this is certainly not a dish for anyone on a diet!

Mister Jiu's hits none of these points. However, that doesn't mean it wasn't a good dining experience.\n\nAt a high level, all the food was tasty. Nothing I ate felt like it was poorly made, and everything was flavorful. Uni rice rolls, string beans, pork buns, some sort of weird hot/sour but tomato soup, liberty peking roast duck w/ wraps (at the cost of $110, good god) - it was all good. But why does the fanciness need to come from the sheer cost of the ingredients? Why put uni on Cheong Fun? That felt like the choices were made for the sake of the text on the menu, rather than the taste in the mouth.\n\nOne thing you'll notice here: portions aren't large, but prices are HIGH. Not many of the dishes here are \"family style\" - even the fried rice was closer to individual portions (served in a bowl) rather than a large plate as you would expect to get at a chinese restaurant. For most things, everyone got to try a bite here and there so make sure you order a lot and have a credit card with a limit that can foot the bill.\n\nThe wine menu was very weak. We ordered a Ros\u00e9 to start, and then ate most of the main courses paired with a Pinot Noir. None of the wines were especially interesting nor did they harmonize well with the food. It was just... wine. Cocktails were decent. I wouldn't say any of the drinks are worth writing home about, but they were crafted with pride and had all the fixings you expect from a drink that costs as much as a lunchtime dim sum with friends would ($14).\n\nOther than the food, the service was great. We had reservations, but the table before us wasn't finished yet when we had got there. We waited for 30 minutes and eventually got the table, and they served us with some complementary shrimp crisps. Although this was not an ideal situation, they did extend their condolences and tried to make up for it. The waiters were always attentive with swapping out plates and silverware, something you'd never find at a traditional Chinese restaurant.\n\nThis begs the question, is it possible to make Chinese food fancy and well executed?

A very different vibe from your typical Chinatown restaurant. \n\nGiven that it was my mom's birthday + she's a bit of a picky eater, I decided to give Mister Jiu's a shot. Chinese food + a Michelin star, what could go wrong? \n\nThere was a bit of a wait to get seated, but other than that, it was smooth sailing. Good service + delicious food:\n1) Sourdough Scallion Pancake: A unique twist on the scallion pancake. We probably shouldn't have eaten so many pieces since we were very stuffed later on..\n2) Dutch Crunch Pork Bun: Very tasty & interesting take on the traditional pork bun. Nice mixture of sweet (from the bun) and salty (from the filling). I don't think I will be satisfied with a normal pork bun after this... \n3) Taiwanese Style Eggplant: I'm normally not a huge fan of eggplant, but this dish was done very well. The eggplant wasn't overly mushy and the flavor was on-point\n4) Wontons: 2nd favorite dish of the night. There's a bit of a kick to it, but nothing too intense. Even my mom who can't handle spicy dishes was able to eat it. Really enjoyed the squid pieces on top. Would definitely order again\n5) Peking Duck: Hands down my favorite dish from the whole night. Always a huge fan of Liberty Farm duck. Loved that they give you pancakes instead of buns. There's also a side of pate that goes with your duck. Would definitely order this again\n\nGiven that this was a $200 meal after tax, I am a bit hesitant to return. While the food here was very high quality, the price tag makes it hard for me to justify coming here again... I could get the same thing for 1/3 of the price with just one level down in terms of quality. \n\nOverall, it's a good place to try and to take picky Asian parents to.", "author": "Angela W."}

Even the \"nicer\" restaurants were still priced pretty affordably, and were anything but ostentatious affairs. The one thing you could count on though, was consistently delicious food.\n\nThat, really, is the real problem that I appreciate Mister Jiu's taking on, and why I wasn't throwing a fit when our bill came in at $90 a head for the some 14 dishes my group ended up trying: every dish we tried was consistently enjoyable, and each was better than most anything I can find elsewhere here in the city. Was it authentic? Eh, not really. Can Asia do better? Yeah, of course. For much less? Absolutely.

Came here for a 8:30pm Wednesday date night after trying to get a reservation for 3 months!\n\nVenue / Service: tucked away in a small Chinatown alleyway, Mister Jiu's is quite spacious on the inside.  The kitchen is open too so you can easily watch the chefs working.  Bit dark on the inside, but still loved the modern Asian accents throughout the room (like the chandeliers and large ink painting on the wall) that gave a cozy feeling not typical of some Michelin restaurants.  Service was on the higher end of the scale I've seen- waiters are very attentive and were very helpful in describing dishes and providing recommendations.  \n\nFood: they say 5-7 dishes for 2 people, but I think it depends on which size dishes you get and what you order.  We ended up ordering WAY too much, but will note that they still make some pretty good leftovers for the next few days.  That being said, we loved every dish we had for their more modern take of classic dishes without taking away from the tradition too much.  \n-- Dutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns (3ea)($11) - loved how the BBQ filling wasn't too sweet but was counterbalanced with the slightly sweet crunchy topping that also added texture to the dish.  Also appreciated how there was more filling vs. dough so you didn't feel carb-heavy.  \n\n-- Sea Urchin Cheong Fun ($16) - this probably was the least impressive of all the dishes we had.  The dish was very simple and clean (just urchin, simple sauce, and rice noodle), but thought there was a LOT of noodle vs. urchin.  Would have helped to have had a crunchy element to the dish since it was overall soft / mushy.  \n\n-- Oxtail Soup (bone marrow, horseradish, dandelion, lotus root)($16) - one of our favorites; much lighter than I expected, but still packed quite a flavor.  The broth almost had a cinnamon aspect to it, but was quite delicious.  Bone marrow was very slight but enough to add more richness to the dish.  I liked how the oxtail was also in smaller, very tender pieces so it was soft, contrasted with the crunchy lotus root.  One serving served 2 of us.  \n\n-- Steak Fried Rice (wagyu skirt, crispy garlic, cured tuna heart)($22) -- another recommendation by the waiter that was a good one!  Should be good for sharing between 3+ people comfortably and 2 people if you order less dishes.  Wagyu was cooked enough that it didn't feel too mushy (which is why I'm not a fan of wagyu) and the tuna heart added a tiny hint of phunk to the dish.  BTW, this is easily reheatable and still tasty if you have leftovers.\n\n-- Liberty Farm Roast Duck (pancakes, peanut butter hoisin, cucumbers)(half for $65) - highly recommended by the waiter, and another good choice!!  Wish we had ordered fewer dishes so we could finish this one completely!  Half of the portion is traditional roasted duck in Peking-style- the fat is beautifully rendered and skin was crispy, just like you would imagine Peking Duck!  They confit the other half, which surprisingly I preferred more than the traditional roast duck; the meat was very tender and I found it to be more flavorful.  Also surprisingly makes good leftovers.\n\nAll in all, we've been dying to come here and we weren't disappointed!  Perhaps ordered too much food for two people but at least we had some tasty leftovers in the end!  Takes a while to get a reservation, but for us, it was worth the wait.", "author": "Audrey H."}

We go to the bay area yearly to visit family, so I bookmarked it, made a reservation exactly 2 months in advance, and headed there on a Tuesday night.\n\nMr. Jiu's has an expansive menu, but not to diner level or anything. My husband and I had pre-gamed with west coast oysters at Leo's down the street, so we didn't want to over-order. We settled on 2 mains, a veggie, dumplings, and some pork buns.\n\nI was really excited about the acclaimed dutch crunch pork buns, but they were a little too sweet for my own personal taste in pork buns. We moved on to the broccoli romanesco, which was great. It hit all the marks in terms of salty, sweet, savory, spicy, and overall flavor. The steak fried rice was good too, with tender wagyu-style beef and delectable grains, though not entirely special.\n\nMy favorite dish of the night was easily the wontons, which came with Monterey squid. As an avid lover of Italian food, I appreciated the al dente chew of the homemade dough and the perfectly cooked seafood. This was really nicely done. Last but certainly not least was another highlight - the quail, which was stuffed with sticky rice and felt like fine French in its execution.\n\nI liked the open kitchen and the atmosphere of the buzzy restaurant, which is perched on a hill and allows patrons a nice elevated view of Commercial St. I also enjoyed the Sydney Hale bergamot and black tea candles wafting in the bathroom so much that I ordered one online on my way home.", "author": "Meghan A."}

The ambiance is beautiful - great view of Chinatown, beautiful decor and lamps, open kitchen. \n\nFood - for 2 girls , we ordered too much! It's meant to be family style so everything was shared. I numbered the dishes my by favorite from 1-6 (1 being my favorite). \n\n3) Pig's head: Cumin flavor, very beautiful\n4) Beef tendon w/XO sauce: Chewier than I wanted but that's tendon, great XO sauce\n5) Wontons w/squid: Squid was a nice touch, had a very chow fun flavor in the wok\n6) Uni cheong fun: Was the most excited about this and the least impressed. Great uni that is overpowered by the noodle, which is not stuffed. Sauce also overpowered the uni. \n1) Half duck: Half roasted half confit, great concept, with a soft tortilla like bun instead of the traditional. The liver mousse was a great touch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-14", "description": "According to Bon Appetit this is the 3rd best restaurant in America. I'm not sure I really agree with that, but... I do think the Dungeoness Crab Cheurng Fund ( rice rolls ) was the best I've ever had in America or Asia. The texture of the rice roll is just amazing. The dungeoness crab on top, honestly, I wouldn't really have noticed if it wasn't there. I think it actually might have been better if it was HOT and inside the roll.\n\nThat being said, Mr Jiu's was an extremely enjoyable meal. It was like the classic chinese dishes, only leveled up.\n\nFor example - baked cha siu bao now had a dutch crunch on top, but they were also twice as small as a regular cha siu bao. The cha siu was all pork, and a lot less fat than usual, which I appreciated, but I think these need to have a level of softness to the bun to complement. Nonetheless, good.\n\nSilken Tofu - ribeye mapo. Again, with that delicious silky, melt in your mouth texture, but was it really elevated by using ribeye? I personally don't think so, but it was still very good.\n\nSo I think you get the gist. We ordered a lot, so I'll break it down for you below:\n\nHere is what really stood out\n- Steak Fried Rice: wagyu skirt, crispy garlic, cured tuna heart. (yass, get this if it's still on the menu. Very flavorful, very tender beef )\n- Liberty Farm Roast Duckpancakes, peanut butter hoisin, cucumbers ( delicious... I can't say enough, other than I wish it didn't come out last...)\n- Silken Tofu - Ribeye cap mapo ( texture... amazing)\n- Tendrils, Greens and Stems - meyer lemon, roasted garlic, sea urchin (bright, crisp, and a little salty.. good, different)\n- Dungeness Crab Cheong Fun ( texture....amazing)\n\n\nHere is what I think is good here, but they don't beat the way the old classics are made, IMHO, but what do I know?\n\n- Shrimp Fried Rice: Brentwood corn, red XO, salted cabbage, egg, chives ( not enough flavor, but it could be because we ordered the beef fried rice too and that blew this one out of the water)\n- Taiwanese 'Style' Eggplant: opal basil, chili, fish sauce\n- Sizzled Black Cod - oyster broth, bok choy, young ginger, ( very good, but... very small )\n\nHere is what I wouldn't order again\n\n-Pork 'Lion's Head' Meatballs: pine mushrooms, nettles, cabbage ( not enough flavor, way better at your local good Shanghainese restaurant)\n- Dutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns ( fun, cute, but... as good as tim ho wan's pork bun? no)\n- Prawn Toast (great presentation, but lacked something..)\n\nAlso, unless you really don't know what to order, I don't recommend doing the prix fixe, I think we got a lot more food and a lot more variety and it ended up costing almost the same.", "author": "Vicky L."}

A year later, my company had our holiday party here and I was fortunate enough to try it.\n\nFor apps, we had this really good tuna on a rice cracker thing. So good would definitely recommend getting it. There were 6 different kinds of oysters. I didn't really like any of the oysters (but then again I don't eat much raw foods so don't trust me on this). Another app we had was some scallion pancake ball. Pretty good for a bite size app.\n\nMy thoughts on the dishes:\nMustard Green Salad: Your typical salad, neither great nor terrible.\n\nRed Endive Salad: I kind of liked this dish because of the celery root. If I were to choose a salad, this would be the dish I would order.\n\nSalt Baked McFarland Springs Trout: This honestly tasted like salmon LOL I really liked the sauce accompanying it. It also came with a side of roe. The fish was cooked well. Smooth but definitely needed the sauce.\n\nTendrils, Greens and Stems: Your standard cooked greens. The sea urchin sauce/dressing whatever was foamy and kind of flavorless.\n\nSteak Fried Rice: Your typical beef fried rice. Though I liked the flavor of it, I didn't really find it as an outstanding dish. Beef wasn't tough so that's always a plus.\n\nGlazed Berkshire Char Siu BBQ Pork: I liked the flavor of the bbq pork. I thought this was made very well.\n\nBlack Sesame Cake: Ginger was overpowering. The cake was also a bit dry.\n\nOverall this place was ok. The ambiance is definitely high class.

Absolutely fantastic meal, from service to decor, cocktails and food!\n\nYears of living abroad in Hong Kong and eating the best of Chinese food makes me weary of Chinese food in the US. Mister Jiu's somehow manages to elevate it to a level where I could compare the dishes to traditional preparations but also didn't feel like I needed to. \n\nThe restaurant space is beautiful. An old Chinese restaurant space transformed, with nice tasteful Chinese accents (those lotus chandeliers!). The service is attentive.\n\nThe food! Our server recommended us to order about 5 small dishes for the two of us. We wanted to try the Liberty Farm Roast Duck which is a big plate, so was only going to do two small plates with it. We ordered the Sea Urchin Cheong Fun and the Hodo Tofu Skin. Our server suggested an extra starch to go with everything so we went with the Wagyu skirt steak fried rice.\n\nSea Urchin Cheong Fun - the rice noodle roll was silky and thin, the texture and consistency on par with the best dim sum places. Uni on top? What an excellent idea! The sweetness of the uni melted with the cheong fun and the slightly citrusy soya sauce was perfect to bring it all together!\n\nWagyu skirt steak, crispy garlic broccoli and tuna heart fried rice - In hindsight, we might not have needed this extra starch because the pancakes that came with the duck was enough, but we have no regrets. The fried rice was very tasty and the grains had a good bite to it. Wagyu almost seems like a waste for fried rice but it was so flavorful and tender!\n\nHodo Soy Tofu skin with yellowfoot Mushrooms, chives and cured egg yolk - I'm a big fan of Hodo Soy and this Tofu skin was delicious. It was silky but had a nice soy bean flavor that was complimented by the creamy sauce. The combination of fried and fresh Tofu skin made for a nice contrast in texture. For some reason though, I wish this dish was served cold instead.\n\nLiberty Farm Roast Duck - comes with pancakes and condiments Peking Duck style, and also a Leg Confit with Duck jus and a mousse terrine. First of all, I recommend trying the Roast Duck on it's own without wrap or condiments. The flavor and texture will blow you away. Then move into the meat with pancakes and condiments. Try spreading some of that liver mousse in too... ugh, so good. I did however wish that the skin was a bit crispier and less charred. The confit portion was also delicious and the meat melted off the bone and into the jus perfectly.\n\nToo stuffed to try the enticing desserts we opted for the small Jin Dui with guava ham, which are like fried mochi ball munchkins covered with sesame seeds. Yum and just right. The Dan Tart (egg tarts) looks scrumptious... next time.\n\nOh, and the cocktails! We had the Weath and Wisdom both Scotch based drinks. Delicious. I'd come to sit at the bar and just have cocktails... or maybe I wouldn't cos the food would be too tempting, haha. \n\nIf you've tried before. you would know reservations are hard to get and booked months in advance. I did book mine more than a month ago, but noticed that there are quite a few spaces at the bar open for walk in and some tables opened up throughout the night. So worth trying for a walk on if you can't plan ahead or take that one and only late 10:30pm reservation.\n\nThere's also plenty of street parking after 6pm!", "author": "Vanessa K."}

I tried several different drinks and give them high marks for how good they all were.The only comparison I have in SF is Joey's brilliant work at SRO.

And what I mean by that is places that are so high in demand for reservations that I get a FOMO attack and have to go at the first available opportunity.  This time around it was late on a Wednesday, which worked out fine because parking was a breeze.  \n\nMy son surprised me by joining my foodie friends and I.  I think he's trying to expand his palate, or at least keep up with his mom.  Together we ordered MJ's classics menu.  While I do cringe spending so much on Chinese food, I did feel like it was money well spent.  The crab cheong fun was my favorite starter with the dutch crunch bbq pork buns a very close second.  I don't usually eat turnip cake, but the way they seared these was amazing and really elevated the dish. \n\nThe nice part of the menu is that each person orders their own entree between the quail and the fish.  It is served along with wagyu beef fried rice and tender green stems, which had an uni cream on top.  The quail was stuffed with sticky rice and was so good.  I just wish I went to town on it and used my hands more to get every last bit of quail.  \n\nFinishing off with the black sesame cake was perfect.  It wasn't too heavy or too sweet.  And I love me some black sesame.  \n\nNow that the FOMO feeling is gone, I can make future reservations in peace - which is exactly what I did as soon as I got home.

There is more than fried rice and egg rolls?  Yes, just like there is more to Mexican cuisine that tacos.\nFirst it a beautiful restaurant with a great city view.  Get there early for your reservation and pull up to the bar.  The drinks they are producing are very unique.  The bartenders are mixing up Asian fusion twists on some of the classics and investing some of their own.\n\nThe food is well executed and portioned right for sharing.  The dumplings that are on the cover of every food magazine are quite good.  I was in love with the orange chicken. It was the most wonderful balance between sour and bitter from zest (you know the flavor) and sweet.  There was a nice heat to it also. \n\nOur server was a bit \"sales pushy\" for me, but I think she was compensating for the fact you get a lot of people uncomfortable with ordering new types of food (see opening statement).", "author": "Neil W."}

I love the ambiance of this place....good start.  The service was on point and friendly. \n\nWe ordered the pre-fixe menu since it was our first time here. I thought the turnip cake was a bit salty and the crab cheong fun too.  I think one suggestion is to change the plate between the turnip cake and the cheong fun as the sauce for the turnip cake may have left some residuals when I put the cheong fun on the same plate.  The Dutch crunch pork bun was good..a marriage of bolo bao and pork bao...a hint of sweetness with the savory of the pork...it was good.\n\nI did enjoy the cod, vegetables, and the steak fried rice which were filling and the highlights of the meal.  All perfect and delicious.\n\nWhen the dessert came (black sesame cake), I was excited but the flavor didn't pop out as I would have liked.  I could hardly taste the black sesame in it.  \n\nOverall, it was ok with some hits and misses.  I want to come back again and pick from their a la carte menu.", "author": "James L."}

So, wanting to check out a new place with her and our other friend - I made a reservation for Friday at 9PM. \n\nWe arrived a little past 8:30 and were asked to wait in the lobby until closer to our reservation time, which was fine, it gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and decide what we wanted to order. Right on time, one of the hostesses came to walk us to our table. Before she sat us though, she turned to me and asked if we had a reservation. I was kind of baffled - clearly we'd been waiting for 30 min and we had checked in with them when we had arrived. She even asked me for the name on the reservation so she could go back and double check. It just made me wonder if they get a lot of guests trying to fake that they have reservations...and seemed like an odd way to start our night.\n\nOur server came over promptly and we ordered the 7 course set meal and also added on a half duck. Our cocktails came out a few minutes later and the Dutch crunch pork buns and turnip cakes came out shortly after. Both of these dishes were interesting but nothing special. The third starter, the sea urchin cheong fun, came out a little bit later and was the highlight of our meal. The sea urchin was fresh and the cheong fun was lightly seasoned.\n\nWe all had the halibut for our main course and agreed it was steamed well, but it wasn't amazing. The pea shoots came with a sea urchin dressing, which tempered the bitterness of the vegetables but was a bit overwhelming. We were also waiting for our fried rice for a while, and when it came it was a bit too salty and heavy. \n\nOur half duck came out at the end and there was just too much food for us to finish - we each made a duck wrap and then had to get everything packed up. While the preparation of the duck was good, it wasn't special, and the duck mousse was probably the most unique part of the dish. \n\nThe black sesame cake at the end was good, but there was another blip in service when another server came over with the dessert menu even though our dessert was included in the set.\n\nOverall, the food was average and the service wasn't great. At this price point, I just expected better. Probably won't be coming back unless another friend really wants to go.", "author": "Ada C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-22", "description": "Consider the scallion: its green stalk is a versatile ingredient that can add a kick to any meal.  Less stigmatic than its white counterpart, the green onion can elevate a meal without making you reach for breath mints or rush to the restroom with a travel-size toothbrush in hand.  Grilled, saut\u00e9ed, raw - the wonders of the scallion are on full display at Mister Jiu's, the brainchild of rising chef Brandon Jew.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Mister Jiu's, then you probably don't know that the restaurant has racked up the accolades in its first two years of operation: the restaurant received one star in the latest Michelin guide; it was voted as the #3 best new restaurant by Bon Appetit in 2017; and it was recently featured on an episode of David Chang's food documentary 'Ugly Delicious.'  Given this pedigree, expectations were high, and the restaurant somewhat lived up to the hype.\n\nJew's cuisine reimagines Chinese American staples by drawing upon quality California ingredients and traditional Chinese cooking techniques.  My friend and I ordered the uni cheong fun (rice roll), sizzling rice soup, hodo skin tofu, fava beans, wonton and squid, sizzling black cod, and jian dui (sesame ball).  Things I expected to like were underwhelming in their conventionality.  The uni cheong fun ($16), for instance, featured nicely steamed rice noodle with a generous portion of uni atop each roll.  But, the buttery texture of the uni blended with the softness of the rice noodle. And, a more even distribution of uni would have improved the dish.  Likewise, the wonton with squid ($22) seemed like it would offer a unique take by stuffing wonton skins with squid, but instead featured nicely grilled squid alongside pork wontons dyed black with squid ink.  It was good, but nothing revolutionary in terms of flavor or texture.  The standouts of our meal were undoubtedly the hodo skin tofu ($18), the sizzling black cod ($32), and the fava beans ($16).  Both the hodo skin tofu and fava beans were unique in that they transformed simple items - tofu and beans - into substantive dishes that rivaled their meatier counterparts in terms of flavor and texture. \n\nAs one would expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant, service was good.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and clearly pointed out how they could accommodate by dairy and peanut allergies.  Yet, my friend and I noticed how his personality seemed to warm up as the night wore on; although a little standoffish at first, he eventually started cracking jokes and making quips to us and adjacent tables.    Otherwise, the kitchen was a little slower than expected with certain dishes that seemingly did not require lengthy cooking times, but the relaxed pace ensured that we didn't overeat.\n\nYour enjoyment of Mister Jiu's will likely depend on your answer to the following questions: are these dishes still worthwhile even if they do not improve upon the original?  And, can ethnic food that has been repeatedly framed in the US cultural imaginary as \"cheap\" be reimagined as \"expensive\"?  I'm not not sure I have an answer to such questions, but I did leave craving Cantonese-style steamed whole fish smothered with scallions and soy sauce.", "author": "Greg T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-05", "description": "Tl;dr Visited twice, and Mister Jiu's disappointed both times. This is one of those experiences that point out the increasing arbitrariness and commoditization of Michelin stars, and how they are no longer a mark of a certain level of craftsmanship but instead one whose owners just pile on some ingredients they expect to be well-received (e.g. sea urchin and wagyu). My initial reaction was that--this isn't \"good Chinese food\", it's pretty inauthentic. Then I watched David Chang's \"Ugly Delicious\", where the first episode extolls on how \"authentic\" does not mean \"better\". I agree. Authentic doesn't mean better; but the problem with Mister Jiu's is that it is neither authentic, NOR, better. It's simply just barely average food, with subpar service, that tries to elevate it's dishes by simply throwing on \"fancy\" ingredients.\n\nWe ordered:\n1/ uni cheongfun (1/5)\n2/ steak fried rice (2/5)\n3/ gongpao broccoli (4/5)\n4/ salt baked trout (3/5)\n\nI've found it particularly annoying when certain establishments try to  mask the average-ness of their food by just putting on some \"trendy\" ingredients. Don't get me wrong, I love uni, but I hate when it is literally dumped on as a way to avoid creating something actually delicious. The rice-roll layers were way too thick and overcooked, and so when you cut in, they melded into one another and reached a mushy consistency, and that just isn't pleasant to consume--authentic or otherwise. You're going to get way too much starch gluing your mouth together, and just no sauce between the layers to even out the flavors. I liked the idea of a sour ponzu-like sauce given the richness of uni, but it was way too tart and the entire dish lacked depth. You get this burst of tartness that is too sharp and overpowering, and you completely lose the flavor of the uni because your tastebuds are occupied with this vinegar, and when that goes away, you're left with a mushy lump of dough, which  is just tasteless beyond the tart! I couldn't, and didn't want to finish it. How this is one of their most-ordered dishes, I can only attribute to the power of instagram and beautiful plating. Don't, be, fooled!\n\nI ordered yet another house favorite--steak fried rice. Yet again an attempt at elevating a subpar dish by adding an eye-catching ingredient--wagyu. Ok wagyu was cooked well, but the fried rice itself was again poor. I'll give it to them that there was the distinct flavor of wokhei (heat from the wok), but the rice was soft and mushy. What is with soft and mushy things in this establishment!? I hate it when my fried rice is served like that--you know they either cooked the rice for too long or added just too much sauce and wet ingredients. Flavors were also all over the place; for one, it was way too sweet. Why, is the predominant flavor I'm getting in my fried rice, sweetness? Ugh, it was frustrating because this was dish 2 and I had so wanted to like Mister Jiu's more (first time I came for a friend's large birthday and attributed the mediocrity of the food to having to cook for 16 people at once). But nope. I picked out the few pieces of steak, and no longer wanted the rest. \n\nThe broccoli was the one thing that I enjoyed. A little too greasy, but good flavors all around. Broccoli was NOT overcooked! It still retained its crispness. However, it was probably at the standard I'd have expected at a proper asian restaurant, and it tasted just like that. Nothing special, but a solid re-creation. \n\nWe'd actually visited this time because my boyfriend wanted the salt-baked trout he enjoyed at my friend's birthday. They changed the fish, and this time it actually just really tasted like baked salmon. It wasn't very good. All in all, the highlight of my meal, sadly, was the guava pate de fruit they served at the end. Nice, strong, guava flavor coming through, not too sweet. Ha, ha. I'm feeling sad just writing this.\n\nService was also pretty shabby. We came in and asked for the table by the window, but was told it was reserved. No problem, I didn't request that table. An older couple came in about 5 min later, and were seated somewhere further inside the restaurant (so they clearly didn't reserve the window table either), and we heard them ask the server if they could sit by the window instead (the table we asked for), and the server said \"sure!\" and directed them over. Excuse me, but what kind of system is this? \n\nAll in all, this meal left me pretty sad and disappointed. I love good food, and a great meal can make my entire week. I wanted to like Mister Jiu's, I wanted to pay $80/head and feel satisfied from the experience. I was left thinking I could've spent that $80 on half an omakase at ju-ni, and that would've made me way happier.I've enjoyed experiences at Michelin restaurants that have really impressed (like Atelier Crenn), but places like Mister Jiu's makes me question if I can still trust the mark of a star.

But this time, the hype failed me.\n\nCame on a Tuesday around 7 pm, which is peak dinner time. Even as a solo diner, I had to wait a little while. However, shortly after I arrived, one spot opened at the bar. I think this was pure luck, as another spot wouldn't open at the bar for at least another 30 minutes.\n\nSitting at the bar, you can still order off the full menu. The bar staff is friendly and helpful in taking orders. To start, I ordered the prawn toast and fermented cabbage. The prawn toast was delicious! Perhaps it was problematic that I started with the toast, as it only went downhill from there. The fermented cabbage was a little too fermented for me. However, I was willing to let this pass, as I could imagine this would be a delicious dish for someone who really liked fermented foods.\n\nNext, I placed an order for the ribeye mapo tofu, based off a recommendation of a friend. I added a side of white rice based on the waiter's suggestion, which was a good call! Even with the rice, the mapo was wayyy too salty! It was so salty, that I couldn't eat the ribeye or anything that had really melded with the sauce. The tofu was lovely and silken, but when asked what I thought about the dish, that was the only compliment I could offer. I think it may have just been a bad night in the kitchen, but the saltiness totally ruined the dish and meal.\n\nSince I was there though, I decided to power through and still try dessert as well. The bartenders recommended the frozen honey, which at first I found weird. However, as you slowly eat more of the dish, you come to appreciate how the flavors and textures blend. It's definitely worth a try if you want dessert.\n\nDrink-wise, I got Luck which was perfectly balanced and delicious. Definitely get a cocktail (or two) to accompany your meal.\n\nOverall, not worth the hype.

She said it was THE IT place in Chinatown right now and that Mister Jiu's had a Michelin star. Maybe I'm a traditionalist but I don't need a Michelin star for a Chinese restaurant to be awesome to me. So, we were curious about this place. \n\nNote: they won't seat you unless your entire party is there. \n\nWe all opted for the 7 dish tasting menu for $69 per person. I thought this price was fair, especially for a Michelen star restaurant. BUT, I just didn't think I was hungry enough. Didn't matter - the company on hand was what meant the most to me .\n\nWe tried:\n\nCrispy Scarlet Turnip Cakes:\n\n- Each person received one turnip cake. They were topped with mushrooms. The mushrooms tasted overly tart and sour. I didn't like them at all. The exterior of the turnip cake was nicely crispy but the interior didn't taste good. There was a dryness to the cake that I didn't like.\n\nCaviar Cheong Fun:\n\n- This was the fanciest cheong fun rolls I've ever seen. There were pretty microgreens along with the black caviar. The rice rolls tasted homemade. Girlfriend enjoyed this appetizer the most.\n\nOYSTERS:\n\n- The 7 course meal was to include their famous dutch crunch baos. Unfortunately, they ran out. So the chef offered to sub the item for either a small salad or two oysters. I can't remember the last time friend looked so mortified. He thought it extremely unfair we weren't allowed to pick any item off the tapas menu if they sell out of something. Both friends thought offering a salad was unjust. So, that being said, we opted for the 2 small oysters a piece. They were tiny oysters but tasted fresh and delicious.\n\nSIZZLED ALASKAN HALIBUT:\n\n- Each person could choose between the halibut or quail for their entree. I opted for the halibut. It wasn't a large portion and it didn't come out sizzling. The halibut tasted fresh and moist. I enjoyed the ample young ginger slices on top.\n\nROASTED QUAIL:\n\n- The stuffed chubby quail looked delicious. Friends said the meat tasted juicy and flavorful. What I personally liked was the sticky rice stuffed inside the bird. The rice was sticky and fragrant from absorbing all the quail drippings.\n\nTENDRILS, GREENS, AND STEMS:\n\n- The pea tendrils came out with the entrees. It was served in a large bowl for us to share. The tendrils were topped with a lemon sea urchin sauce. The tendrils were prepared well but they were over salted to a point of making this dish hard to eat. We weren't sure if the tendrils were at fault or if the sea urchin sauce was perhaps the salty culprit. Regardless, no one really touched this dish.\n\nSTEAK FRIED RICE:\n\n-  The steak was tender, juicy, and plain yummy. The rice was wok fried nicely and the crispy garlic added a nice aroma to this shared dish.\n\nBLACK SESAME CAKE:\n\n- You didn't get a choice for dessert. We all received the black sesame cake. I thought the black sesame cake tasted bland and the ginger too strong in the mousse. Friends thought the dessert was ok though. I gave my cake for best friend to take home\n\nmy food blog has more detailed review and pics\n\nService was ok. The first three course came out ridiculously fast. Almost too fast. We felt our each plate was taken away after someone noticed a last bite because another new dish would be placed in front of us so quickly. I felt the value of the 7 courses was fair but then again, I wasn't terribly hungry coming into this. Friend was disappointed overall with the meal but other friend thought it was a 'better than fine' meal for him.

I imagined some piece of overcooked fish with some strips of vegetables, arrange in some sculpture-like form with colorful smears of boldly flavored sauces on the plates.\n\nMr. Jiu's is a more modern, Californian-take on Asian (specifically, Chinese) food. I wouldn't call it \"Asian fusion\", but it certainly attempts to infuse Californian ingredients and techniques while still maintaining a respectable authenticity to each dish.  Highlights were the wontons, made with a squid ink black skin and covered in a spicy Szechuan-esque sauce; the dutch crunch pork buns that reminded me a bit of the Tim Ho Wan baked buns; the Xinjiang lamb chops with ramps and tokyo turnips which were extremely tender and flavorful. Cocktails were delicious, but the black sesame cake dessert we had was, unfortunately, a bit underwhelming. \n\nAll in all, this was a great meal, and I see how this place gets all sorts of accolades.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-14", "description": "So I am torn about Michelin rated places for Asian food as I feel within any Asian country, you can get legit homemade cooking for far cheaper prices and being truly authentic. As part of looking at any Michelin place for Asian food, I look for creativity in the dish and something to intrigue me and Mister Jiu's struck my attention as it seemed to keep the food traditional while offering just a slight enough twist to the entrees to make it interesting. I made a reservation for this spot and for drinks after at one of my favorite speakeasy joints in the city (Bourbon and Branch). This spot is located in Chinatown so parking can be a bit challenging. I ended up taking an uber to avoid the whole search process and showed up for the reservation.\n\nWas greeted promptly at the door and asked to wait a minute as they got set up. The entrance of this joint leads right into a bar with people able to grab food/drinks or just stand for happy hour to enjoy beverages. A few minutes later, was greeted and brought down the long hallway which led to a really open floor dining room. The room had a view into the kitchen so people could see the dishes being made live as they were making its way out of the kitchen and to tables. There were unique cocktails on the menu for around $13 a piece so ordered a few different ones and they all tasted great with a good amount of alcohol in them. After a bit of perusing, decided to order the Devil's gulch pig head, dutch crunch BBQ pork buns, Silken tofu, the steak fried rice, and a large format pork dish. The food comes out on pace and the service was good throughout the entire meal as expected with any Michelin spot. The pig head was out first and when it hit the table I was certainly confused by what exactly it was as the presentation was unique. With that said the meat was flavored and tender with all the accompaniments on the dish pairing it well making it a nice starting dish. The dutch crunch bbq pork buns were next and I love dutch crunch and bbq pork so there was limited ways to mess this up. They did a good job of not overfilling the pork bun but also having a nice bread to meat ratio to not make it overwhelming. The ingredients were clean and on point for the dish. After this the silken tofu came out next, which is just a mapo tofu with ribeye. The presentation was a bit just meh like the pig head but the taste was alright. It was not truly authentic of course but the tofu was nice and soft and the ribeye pieces being just a \"fancier\" version of the traditional dish. The steak fried rice came out as the final small dish prior to the large dish item. This dish comes with wagyu and the meat is quite tender and this overall dish is well made although it did seem a bit oily to me than I had expected. The flavors were still well packed into this dish making for a nice twist to the meal. The large format pork dish was out final which came with a few buns, pickled veggies, and some sauces including mustard. It was essentially a wrap dish where you put the pork into a bun to make a mini bun sandwich. The pork was really well made and quite tender but it didn't have anything really unique kicking into it. The buns were good as well but I was honestly so full by that point that it just felt like it was taking up much needed space for the protein. \n\nAll in all, the food and drinks were solid. The service and ambiance is Michelin worthy without a doubt. With all this said, the dishes weren't as unique as I was hoping for and felt just like a slightly enhanced version of Chinese food. I think the food is good so give it an OK rating being bumped up by atmosphere and service rounding it to 4 stars. This is definitely worth a try but not sure I would be back to pay for upscale Chinese food when I can get more authentic and still delicious food around Chinatown.", "author": "Dan M."}

We had the MJ's Classic tasting menu: \n\n1. Turnip Cake: this is SO DIFFERENT from traditional turnip cakes you can order at a normal dim sum place. Extremely crispy on the outside. YUM!\n2. BBQ Pork Bun: again, it is very distinctive from other baked bbq buns. It has a crispy flaky topping that is similar to some pineapple buns' topping but baked to dark brown so it has a nice caramelized flavor.\n3. Cheong Fun: alright, this is the first time I had cheong fun with caviar on top. Why so fancy lol. Also, I was expecting so sort of fillings inside of the cheong fun so I was kinda disappointed finding out there's nothing inside.\n4. Steak fried rice & Tendrils: The wait between cheong fun and the two dishes was long. Some of the tendrils are a little too old to be served so we weren't particularly impressed. The steak fried rice tho, OMG! Best fried rice ever!\n5. Sizzled black bass & Wolfe Ranch Quail: Quail is tender. There is sticky rice inside of it, nice surprise haha. Sauce goes well with the dish. Black bass is a little bit too oily for my taste.\n6. Black sesame cake: The tiny bits of candy reminds me of the candy I used to eat as a kid. My favorite dish, period.\n\nTL;DR: Great restaurant. The tasting menu is definitely worth trying. Also, the old couple on the menu is the owner's grandparents lol. So sweet", "author": "Ming H."}

But even if they were priced lower I wouldnt go back. Too SALTY. Theres a lot going on in the dishes and they had good flavors, but the only thing i can recall after each bite was how salty it was. Not even additional white rice helped the food go down because the meat and eggplant itself was so overly marinated, each bite made me cringe a bit. Also, when it wasnt as salty, it was DRY. The dutch crunch bbq bun and duck confit leg (actually pretty tasty not as salty as others) were less salty but were very dry. A real bbq bun is soft and moist (yes i ised that word). The dutch crunch wasnt a \"bun\" at all. It didnt have to taste like a traditional bun, but it had 0 fluff, just thin toasty crust that was slightly overtoasted with a little burnt flavor. \n\nI dont usually write reviews, but because of the price tag, i felt a bit cheated and had to share. I sometimes accidentally oversalt my food at home because im aftaid it wont have enough taste. Not something i expect from a 1 star Michelin restaurant. Liholiho and Benu are so much better! Liked State Bird better as well. \n\nAs an asian, I enjoy a lot of asian fusion and dont expect the dishes to be exactly as they are traditionally. We ordered 5 dishes and only the scallion pancake was easily edible without a lot of rice or water to swallow it down. The flavors were all very nice but it was trying way too hard to be tasty. And in case you think im overly sensitive to salt, I cant think of one restaurant in sf I didnt like because it was too salty. \n\nratings broken down below:\n\n2 stars Food (personally most important to me)\n3 stars Service\n4 stars Atmosphere\n\nNot sure why there are so many 4/5 star ratings for this kind of food. Saw the chef so its not like i got a special day. It is a unique concept for chinatown and appreciate what its trying to do but the food just needs to be good first and foremost.", "author": "Debbie Y."}

There aren't that many \"fancy\" Chinese restaurants. While some may argue that \"modernizing\" food is essentially catering it to the Caucasian palate, I did not feel that way.

This place offers a modern twist on a lot of Chinese classics - pork buns, dumplings, etc. The decor is modern and inviting.\n\nI ordered the BBQ pork buns and Prawn toast for appetizers and then the Carrot 'Ma Jiang Mian' as my main dish. Everything was excellent, especially the appetizers. The carrot dish was served cold in a cold, spicy sauce. It was good, though I was hoping for a more complex dish rather than just mostly noodles.\n\nI ordered their kombucha to drink, which is brewed in house (is a new addition to their menu). It tastes a little vinegary, but is good if you like kombucha. For dessert, I ordered the sesame cake, which is served with some yummy ginger mousse and crispy white chocolate. \n\nThe price is reasonable for dinner - I was expecting worse for a Michelin star restaurant. \n\nI didn't have a reservation, by the way.

I chose this place for my boyfriend's bday because he loved fusion restaurants which is generally not my jam. The food and atmosphere was not bad but not Michelin level in my opinion.\n\nFirst, I was really disappointed that many of the items I had wanted to try were either sold out or not on the menu. I specifically made this reservation because my bf loves oxtail soup which we don't be menu online. When we got to the restaurant, it was not there! I also wanted to try the pork crunch buns but we were told they were out. They had one bun left but would not give it to us to try even though we ordered the tasting menu... huge bummer. In addition, the restaurant was LOUD.  Not a great place to have a romantic dinner. Finally. They had all these exotically sounding teas so we ordered the teas... but they turned out to be regular teas.\n\nDespite the bad first impression, the food was pretty good. I normally hate beef tendon but they had a great spicy beef tendon dish. I also loved the uni noodle even though my bf thought it was more meh. He loved the turnip cake which I thought was more meh. The restaurant than seems to have forgotten our next course and gave us our mains instead of the fried rice and greens. Of the main courses, the quail was very meh because it was overly salty in my opinion but my bf's halibut  as very very well done. I asked about the missing dishes and we got the steak fried rice and greens. Can I just say the steak fried rice is AMAZING?! The beef is wagyu and you can tell... super soft and wonderful. It was by fair the best hint on the menu. The greens were good too, basically similar to your traditional snow pea leaves but with lemon! The dessert was a very well done sesame cake. All in all, there was a lot of food so you definitely get your bang for your expensive Michelin buck.

Sounds like a bad idea? Not so much! We were told it would be 40 minutes for a table but that bar seating could be faster, so we got some drinks at the bar and waited to see what would happen first. I started with the Prosperity cocktail -- a lovely vodka cocktail with hints of matcha and passion fruit, with a yin yang design on top -- and my friend got the Eternity, which is basically a vodka martini topped with crab oil (delicious). Bar seats popped up before we were even done snapping pictures of our photogenic beverages. \n\nWe started with the dutch crunch pork buns, which were very sweet and not something I would get again. More like a tea snack than any kind of chinese bun I've ever had before. Next up, the oxtail soup which was otherworldly. Rich broth flecked with bitter dandylion greens and tender oxtail, my friend and I were so tempted to drink it right from the bowl. Next, we ordered the miso black cod...this is where things went wrong. \n\nWhen the dish was brought to our table, the waitress said, \"miso snapper\" as she set it down. Snapper? Huh? The fish we got was snapper, which is very different from black cod and not something I would elect to order at $32 a plate. The fact that nobody came out and asked if we would want snapper, and instead it was just presented as if we had ordered it seemed like a surprising lack of basic good service. I tried the fish and it was dense and dry and just not great, certainly not $32 great. The bartender quickly offered to remove it from the bill and comped a round of drinks as well -- we tipped him on the original order, of course, because THAT'S how good service works. \n\nFinally, we had the tofu skin which was otherworldly. Creamy and rich with mushrooms and chives, it was kind of like a cream-based pasta but without pasta or cream. \n\nAll in all, I'll definitely be back to Mr. Jiu's, as there are a number of dishes I can't wait to try.", "author": "Maud D."}

The ambiance was lively, and the dishes creatively incorporated traditional Chinese and locally-inspired ingredients to create something unique.\n\nWild Mushroom Bao (3/5) - The dough was notably soft and flavorful, but otherwise it was relatively normal.\n\nCarrot Ma Jiang Mian (4/5) - This was an interesting take on a traditional Chinese dish. The noodles were very chewy and al dente, and the sauce was rich with sesame. The mustard greens were also a great addition, and overall this dish was a refreshing starter.\n\nSalt Baked McFarland Springs Trout (5/5) - The trout was flaky, tender, and packed with so much flavor that it could have stood alone, but the scallion sauce and the trout roe augmented the dish. This is definitely filling for two people. Ask for the Kohuho Rose Organic Rice to eat with this dish.\n\nChinese cuisine is generally a sharing experience, and Mister Jiu's is no exception.

The first visit was with 4 friends and we tried a great variety of apps, dim sum, entree, and large format entrees.   First of all, the space is gorgeous and the service was excellent.  The winner dish of the night was the whole quail stuffed with sticky rice.  It was poetry on a plate.  Not far behind was the truly aromatic wagyu beef fried rice.  Things went south from there.  We thought both the roast duck and the roast pork large entrees were just so so.  We were summarily disappointed with the updated dim sum with crazy up charges.  Particularly the scallion pancake.   Overall, considering the high price, the table rated the whole experience 3 stars.   Then I came back and just sat at the bar intent on the quail again.  The entire bar staff was truly outstanding in every way.  Bravo.  Then I saw the addition of a 7-course $69 tasting menu.  3 dim sum items to start.  Then your choice of either fish or quail for main course with 2 sides--wagyu beef fried rice and tendril greens.  Black sesame cake concludes the meal.  My gosh, what an amazing deal!!  Just the quail with 2 sides if ordered separately would cost $80.  Plus they do not serve smaller tasting portion quails or fried rice or tendrils or dessert.  You get the full-on portion.  So ya, of course I went with the tasting menu.  The Cheong fun itself is quite wonderful.  But it was terribly let down by fishy tasting uni on top.  Yuk!  The Dutch crunch bbq pork bun was all right.  The turnip cake sitting in soy broth was way WAY too salty and a total miss.  So far, a sad 2 Star rating for the meal.  Then Mr Jiu's totally hit his stride for the remainder 4 courses and 5 stars all the way.  Loved the smoked oyster cream that accompanied the tendril greens.  That is Chinese food properly updated and elevated.  The fried rice was even better this time.  Dessert was sublime.  My last quail I swore the sticky rice was packed also with little morsels of goodness.  This time just straight up sticky rice.  Maybe my memory errs, but I loved the quail slightly less this second time.  Still overall, thanks for adding this super value tasting menu.  Great times!", "author": "Randy P."}

Nothing too creative, nothing quite stand out. \nWe had the prix fixe menu. It started with turnip cake and bbq port bun, which are two staples at dim sum places, but only mister Jiu has them wrong. The bun has a milky crust which took over the bbq pork flavor by large. Then comes a uni cheong fun, which I was looking forward to, but man was I let down. Something that has such opportunity to be made stunning, but was not. It was plain, blend, and the sauce did nothing to elevate the uni. \nNow onto the main course. We had the quail, which deserved the 2 of these 3 stars I'm giving. Quail stuffed with sticky rice, very well done. Juicy quail has a very nice flavor and texture. \nService was warm, however when I checked in, I told them we are here for my husbands bday, they asked if we'd like a candle, I said yes.

I was already hesitant to begin with, because who pays $$$ for Chinese food?! It's supposed to be \"elevated\" Chinese food, but I was not impressed at all. Reservations are highly recommended, as they were packed for dinner, that is, if you still want to go.\n\nService was attentive, but the servers did not show much enthusiasm. There was another waitress tailing ours the entire time, whom I assume was shadowing her. It was just weird because she just stood there without saying anything, not even a hello or introduction. We were there to celebrate a special birthday and although the hostess was notified, there was no effort made to make it a special night. They couldn't even add a single candle to our dessert nor verbally wish a happy birthday.\n\nOn to the food:\n1) The best dish, surprisingly, was our first dish, Devil's Gulch pig head, the headcheese. The gelatinous fatty slices melt in your mouth and go well with the crispy cracker.\n2) The crab cheong fun aka dim sum rice rolls was nothing to rave about. A few slices of crab atop two strips of rice noodle in a bland soy sauce mixture.\n3) The dutch crunch char sui bao, by its name, implies a crunchy bun... Think again! The filling was tasty, but the bun was soft and there was literally no crunch to it. Lies.\n4) Butterfish was also delicious, but the serving was tiny.\n5) Tendrils, greens, and stem was a very strange dish.

But had I done a blind taste test I wouldn't have been able to differentiate the dumplings here vs. anywhere else. The fried rice with the wagyu was basically bland fried rice with tender pieces of beef, tasted fine but nothing to rave about. The supposed tuna hearts were no where to be found. The tendrils & greens dish was a pile of steamed greens with a melted/ dissolved sea urchin on top, not good.

Then seated with the glare of a millions suns reflecting off the building across the street, resulting in seared retinas for 35 minutes whilst being told repeatedly that it would go down soon. Hmmmm. Be aware of this if you're going for a 6:45pm reso. \n\nThe beetroot potstickers were as delish as I remembered but could have done without the sticky sweet orange chicken wings, which were just a lump of sugar. I was most looking forward to the wagyu fried rice again but to our disappointment, it was way too salty, as were the long beans. \n\nThe star of the show turned out to be the turnip cakes but even their magic could not overcome the audacity of Mr. Jiu's charging $3 DOLLARS for a dollop of chili sauce. Really? After tip + tax + your employee health care taxes (don't get me started with why we need to pay for this) that tiny squirt of hot sauce cost us $4!!! $150 later for party of 2, which would be fine if the food held up to their reputation but frankly, I think this place has gone quite downhill and the snooty service certainly puts a bitter taste in your mouth.", "author": "C Y."}

This one was fried so it's crispy on the outside and served with some sauce and some toppings on top (I'm not sure what it was, it could have been some olives? I know.... olives in Asian food? but who cares they were tasty!)\n\n- Orange Chicken Wings: okay this dish just reminded me of when I used to go to panda express. I was obsessed with their orange chicken. Well, Mister Jiu's version was 10x better than panda express because the chicken wings were fried to order. They were perfectly crispy and sticky and packed with flavors\n\n- Pig's head: one of my favorite dishes here. I don't know how to describe this dish. It tasted almost like mortadella but more gelatinous? I don't know.. just give it a try! It's a salty fatty goodness.\n\n- Steak fried rice: omg this fried rice was the bomb. The best fried rice I've had anywhere because they incorporated other non-Chinese ingredients such as cured tuna heart and/or bottarga, which brought this fried rice to the next level, and also the wagyu skirt steak was unbelievably tender.\n\n- Roast duck: delicious! The breast was served medium rare; they were were juicy but not bloody. The skin was amazingly crispy. The leg was cooked differently and it had different spices. Both were nice but the breast was the main star of the dish. The dish also came with a side of Chinese pancakes and condiments (including a duck pate!).

We chose potstickers, Dutch crunch pork bun, Taiwanese eggplant, steak fried rice and the pork dish. \n\nThe Dutch crunch roll was really great. It had a layer of sugar on the top and it was baked. it was sweet and it tasted like fall flavors.  The star of the show was the Taiwanese egg plant.  It is the definition of umami flavor,  just outstanding. The steak fried rice was was also very delicious and had a slightly smoky flavor and the steak was very tender. When The large-format pork dish that came out, we were surprised at how large it was. The pork was pork belly and sirloin. I preferred the pork belly but when you combine the two together in the steam bun that was provided it was delicious. The steamed bun was infused with scallions and it came with a few accoutrements which were pickled vegetables and a barbecue and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce really completed the bun.\n\nWe had a few cocktails. I would've given this restaurant five stars, however I paid $16 for a glass of wine and the pour on the wine was really light. My husband ordered a cocktail called happiness. it was really delicious. I would suggest this for anyone. I ordered a cocktail after my wine called wealth.

There were no reservations available for an earlier time slot (only 9pm and later), so we came in right when they opened and were able to grab a table then. They also serve their full menu at the bar, so that is definitely an option if you don't have reservations. The restaurant is really modern and quite spacious, and the seating comfortable. We tried:\n\n-Kavalan Taiwanese Whiskey Flight ($40): In this flight, we tried the Vinho Barrique (Honey, Raisin, Dark Chocolate), which was our favorite. It was very flavorful, and the smoothest out of all the whiskies. The Ex-Bourbon (Spice, Barley, Oak) had good flavor, but wasn't as smooth. Surprisingly, the least favorite was the Single Malt (Mango, Pear, Coconut)- although I liked the more tropical flavors, this was the harshest tasting of the three when drunken neat.\n-Prosperity (Vodka, Lotus, Lemongrass, Passion Fruit, Egg White, $13, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3542h7iltLAaWZCDOt3cyw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Solid drink, and one of the few cocktails that I actually liked.

The bbq pork inside were more like mini pork belly pieces, and I loved the ratio of fat to lean- recommended!\n-Crispy Scarlet Turnip Cake (4/$8, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DK0yrKIorTKyTDf9rg1tyg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok for me. There was a nice sear/crust to the turnip cake, but it was bland.\n-Potstickers (Pork, Purple Cabbage, Black Vinegar, $16, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sg72x2PhvGEllXi4A2otmA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The potsticker wrapper and filling didn't quite go together, and this was a very average potsticker- skip!\n-Wontons (Pork, Sichuan Peppercorn, Monterey Squid, $18, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ESATs3Ye2Kwntpn3NW6a9g&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I liked the wontons in this dish, but wish they swapped the filling for the wontons and potstickers. I didn't like the squid in here or the sauce they used (too salty), and I wouldn't get this again.\n-Steak Fried Rice (Wagyu Sirloin, Crispy Garlic, Broccoli, Tuna Heart, $22, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DcPdXyD4m4_qYVOu_g7vrQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Next to the BBQ pork buns, this was my favorite dish of the meal.

I also wished they served the duck with steamed buns instead of the pancakes. The duck skin was nice and crispy, but the flavors didn't quite work for me- skip!\n-Black Sesame Cake ($13, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uPJwNxGh2y0-igZBUZjSdA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok- this wasn't sweet enough (and I rarely say that), and there wasn't enough black sesame flavor. Skip!\n-Complimentary Pate de Fruit (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uW1LEbJw-bJUrs56SMHoPA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Better than a fortune cookie, but I'm not a fan of pate de fruit so my friend got them both.\n\nService was solid, and our dishes came out pretty quickly.

Given my background, I've always been doubtful of restaurants that serve expensive Chinese food because you can easily find delicious Chinese food at a reasonable price. So, more often than not, expensive Chinese food is just unnecessarily overpriced Chinese food (to me, even PF Chang is overpriced). However, when my husband told me he got us reservations for Mister Jiu's, I kept an open mind and thought \"hey, maybe it'll actually be really amazing Chinese food that's worth the high prices.\" Nope.\n\nI do not get the hype at all for this place...The food wasn't bad, but for the prices they charge, I had high expectations that were not even close to being met. Everything I ate, I feel like I could've gotten for a fraction of the price at a no-frills Chinese restaurant.  \n\nOn top of the underwhelming food, the service was friendly, but very slow. My husband & I ordered the 7 dishes tasting menu. The first 3 small apps came out very quickly but then afterwards, we waited for almost 30 minutes before the next dishes came out. \n\nReview of the 7 dishes tasting menu:\n1. Dutch Crunch BBQ Bun: it was okay. nothing special. I could've gotten the same thing at an Asian bakery that's 5x bigger and much cheaper. \n\n2. Crispy Scarlet Turnip Cake: same as the dutch crunch bun - not bad but...nothing special. I've had better at dim sums. \n\n3. Uni Cheong Fun: the only flavor in this dish came in the sauce. the uni itself didn't even have flavor, which actually worked for me because I usually don't like the fishy taste of uni, but this had no taste at all. \n\n4. Steak Fried Rice: yeah it's good but nothing special, and yet, for some reason costs $24 if you ordered it a la carte.  \n\n5. Tendrils, Greens and Stems: this was very good, but i don't understand how you can charge $16 for just some leaves saut\u00e9ed with garlic\n\n6.1 Sizzling Black Cod: This was my favorite dish - the fish was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.  \n\n6.2 Roasted Wolfe Ranch Quail: Meh. Was a bit dry. Not impressed and definitely not worth $38.\n\n7. Sesame cake: Black sesame is such a yummy delicate flavor, but all I could taste in this cake was the ginger. Why over-power it with so much ginger? This should've been called \"Ginger Cake\"\n\n\n\nTLDR: Save your money and go somewhere else.

By 5:15pm it was already dark and the lanterns lit up. My friend and I didn't have reservations on a Friday night (nothing left online). Thankfully for 2, they had the option of either a high top table. We opted to just stay at the bar. They don't serve food till 5:30 but I was more than happy to indulge in a nice cocktail. In case you're wondering, Prosperity has a yin yang symbol made with the egg white foam although thankfully the texture wasn't too creamy and had a wonderful earthiness from the lotus root.  \n\nWe had a pretty average appetite and although the server recommended 3 dishes per person, we went with 5 fairly light ones plus 1 dessert. The dishes are numbered below so you can keep track. \n\nMy favorite dish was the (1) Szechuan wontons with squid. I would order it again in a heartbeat because I'm a sucker for squid ink pasta and they were heavy handed with the Chinese black vinegar which was the perfect balance to an otherwise spicy, numbing and rich dish. A close second is the (2) prawn toast which was chocked full with shrimp flavor (via real shrimp pieces) in a somewhat dense but not greasy piece of bread. The roe topping was a winner. Other dishes were cheeky in their play on traditional Chinese dimsum but not worth a repeat unless it was a filler -- things like the (3) Dungeness crab cheung fun and the (4) Dutch Crunch BBQ pork buns just didn't match up to their traditional counterparts. Finally I would not order the (5) ma po Tofu with ribeye steak again as it tasted more like spicy BBQ chili meat than the true fermented bean taste. For dessert we got the whipped honey which was like honey sorbet with fruit and thin crisps of white chocolate and caramelized sugar (or honey). It was a nice, light way to round out the meal. \n\nTotal cost was $65pp after tax and surcharge.\n\nOverall, Mister Jiu's has tasty cocktails and some really stellar fusion dishes. Don't expect authenticity but do expect quality ingredients and cooking finesse. I thought it was moderately priced for the caliber of food albeit the servings were small (a $10 bite is literally a bite). I think where it was lacking was service which was friendly but decidedly casual (note I was sitting at the bar) and would be acceptable at any average restaurant. In the end, I would visit again as there were more interesting dishes than I could eat in one serving.", "author": "Tammy T."}

It was neither here nor there.   I would have preferred if they had just taken familiar dishes and really elevated them or turned them on their ear or given us something completely different.   In reality, it was somewhere in between.\n\nThe decor on the inside was nice, but nothing extraordinary.   They had us sitting at this tiny table in the hallway/transition area which I thought was a little out of place for a michelin star restaurant.   It ended up not being as bad as we initially thought it would be, but our table was SUPER tiny.\n\nThe service was attentive and pleasant.   We never needed to ask for anything.\n\nThe cocktails were also very good, but they weren't anything that stands out in a city full of exceptional cocktails.\n\nFood aka the important stuff:\n\nscallion pancake:   It was quite good, but it seemed like it was an elevated version of something you would get at a county fair that was fried that you dipped in fancy onion dip.\n\ndutch crunch bao:   probably my least favorite dish of the night.   There was literally nothing reminiscent of dutch crunch or a bao.   It was a thin shell that was sort of crispy, sort of not surrounding some pork.   That's it.   The pork had a nice smoky taste, but nothing about it was exceptional.\n\nHot and Sour soup:   hands down, the best dish of the night.   There was a certain umami earthiness to it that really made it very complex.   It wasn't viscous like it normally is when you order it at basic chinese restaurants.   It kept me wanting more and more.\n\nSummer Squash with scallop XO:   Also quite good.   I really enjoyed the XO sauce and I am not usually a fan of XO.   Had chinese sausage in it as well which added a lot to the dish.   Still, I felt like it wasn't exactly that memorable.\n\nCarrot noodles:   This was a good dish that I would order again.   Overall, it tasted more like sesame than anything, but the carrots were nice for texture and the noodles had a nice consistency with a little bit of bite to them.\n\nSizzling halibut:   This was underwhelming to me.   It almost bordered on bland.  The piece of fish was nice and fresh and was technically cooked well.   I just felt like the rest of the dish fell flat.   There was nothing special about the sauce or the seasoning.   I think there was some bok choy or something.....I don't remember and I just ate it less than an hour ago.\n\nOne thing that really disappointed me here was that there seemed to be a real lack of ingenuity here.    It was all way too safe.   There was no regional connection.   There was ZERO spiciness in any of the food.   It was not familiar, but not really unique or exceptional either.   I also didn't find it to be, with a few exceptions, exceptionally luxuriant either.   It seemed like this is like \"hey, look at me, it's chinese food, but with fresh, northern california ingredients\".  Like.....duh.    Farm to table in SF is merely a footnote at this point, and is no longer relevant as a concept.   If you want to spend a lot of money on chinese food, I would recommend Hakkasan over this place.

I will say that there is nothing you can really compare this restaurant to and it is definitely semi exclusive because you constantly have to be on the look out for reservations, good luck walking in. We opted for the prix fixe. All in all very delicious, minus the dessert. The dessert was beautiful looking but tasted very strange, maybe too many conflicting flavors.

It's decorated really on-trend (yet with Asian influence) and there are amazing views of downtown/Chinatown. Also, very odd to say, but I loved their bathrooms. (At least from what I saw in the women's). It's covered in this pretty pink tile with cool asian-inspired paintings on the walls. \n\nThis is a GREAT place to come for drinks and some apps, and I think the ambiance beats most restaurants in FiDi and I would dare say every restaurant in Chinatown. The cocktails are also innovative and refreshing. The vodka cocktail I got had a yin and yang on it--so cool!\n\nAs for food, I would say overall, food was a major hit or just \"ok\". Some of the apps were innovative, in terms of flavors and textures (the shrimp toast!) But I thought some things were\"ehhhh\" And considering the price and location (the heart of Chinatown) there isn't room to be just ehh. The menu had more than enough gems on it to keep me coming back \n\nHit: Shrimp Toast (MUST get)\nFried Rice with beef\nDutch Crunch Pork Buns (aka: the best pork buns I've ever tasted, in my life) \n\nMeh: Potstickers (tasted like every other potsticker I've ever had)\nWontons (was more like a dumpling? Wasn't fried like I expected. Overall not very flavorful) \nQuail (Was VERY dry) \n\nOverall, I think Mr. Jiu's is 100% worth coming to and coming back to again for the ambiance, amazing drink list, and food.

You can see how hard everyone is working including the Chef himself in the open kitchen. Service is excellent. This place just feels nice. \n\nStandouts included:\nhot and sour soup - I know it sounds basic, but every spoonful was a burst of intense flavor in a clear-ish broth with Dungeness crab meat, not your thick goopy hot and sour soup from yesteryear.\n\nsquid ink wontons - skin is al dente, meat is flavorful and not too fatty; the squid ink wrapper/skin gives it a nice briny taste, overall delicious!\n\ntender greens (tendrils, stems) - with lemon uni sauce - TDF! You won't be disappointed. I love Chinese greens, but I don't like how a lot of Chinese restaurants overcook or use too much oil/salt/msg/etc. The greens were cooked so that it still had its crunch and flavor. \n\nuni cheong fun - I wish there was more uni in it, but who doesn't wish that? So I doubled up my uni in a bite and left some of the rice/fun on the plate, and it was perfect. The texture of the rice noodle is the right combination of silkiness and bite. The sauce is lighter than what you get at a dim sum house and has some citrus/acid in it that really amplifies the dish.  \n\nThe only thing I was a disappointed in was the Dungeness crab prepared three ways ($58). The sticky rice cooked with the \"brains\" was overly sweet and had too much coconut flavor which distracted from the umami richness of the \"brains.\" The custard was decent. The salad was just meh.", "author": "Patricia L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-23", "description": "This has been a place we've wanted to try for a while now and we finally went last night. The restaurant is located in one of the back alleys of Chinatown, however, once you enter the restaurant, you will find a very modern design interior and decor which doesn't resemble a Chinese restaurant at all. The host was gracious and courteous. The waiting staff was attentive and checked in on us often.\n\nThe restaurant offers a modern take on Chinese cuisine.  The plates are designed for you to shared. My wife and I ordered Orange Chicken Wings and Sea Urchin Cheong Fun appetizers and Steak Fried Rice and Liberty Farm Roast Duck. The preparation and presentation are superb but regrettably, most of the dishes miss the mark in flavor. The Sea Urchin Cheong Fun sauce was very salty and you can hardly taste the sea urchin as the sauce overpowered. The proportion of the noodle to the sea urchin could have been smaller so that you strike a balance of the ingredients. The Steak Fried Rice was just ok and again salty leads the taste of this dish. Fortunately, the wagyu beef is tender. The Liberty Farm Roast Duck and the Orange Chicken Wings were the better dishes among the four. Liberty Farm Duck offered a duck leg confit and smoked tea duck pieces. The duck leg confit was bland and gamey which we did not like. The smoked tea duck was alright, albeit being salty.  The marriage of flavors from the duck, cucumber, scallions, cilantro, steamed pancake and the hoisin sauce helped balance out the saltiness and gaminess. However, Orange Chicken Wings saved the day which shouldn't have been. The wings were juicy and taste sweet and tangy. They can't compare to San Tung's wings but for the night, it worked out.\n\nWe left disappointed since much of the reviews have given Mr. Jiu's well rated. Unfortunately, we most likely won't be coming back unless a friend wants to visit. We are not too sure if we just ordered the wrong dishes but the dishes we ordered were highly recommended as well. It's sad to say that the highlight of the meal was chicken wings.\n\nWe would give this place 3 out of 5 for the food and 4.5 out of 5 for the service and presentation.", "author": "Joe J."}

I can see why people would like them (my wife did), but I tend to enjoy them on the sweeter side, so didn't love these.\n\nCrispy Scarlet Turnip Cakes:\nThe pickled mushrooms on top added a bit of unexpected zest, which was well appreciated.  I liked the twist, and would recommend ordering these.\n\nOrange Chicken Wings:\nWe received around seven wings, and they were reasonable.  I was expecting a heavier cross of chicken wings with orange chicken, which it wasn't.  They were a bit more like a normal wing (imagine San Tung, less sauce).\n\nOxtail Soup:\nI really liked the soup.  The flavor was quite dense, but the meat felt lighter, which presented a nice contrast.  I would get this again.\n\nBroccoli Romanesco:\nThis dish was great.  I don't usually do spicy food, and this had a kick to it, but the flavors were excellent, and there were these little glutenous squares which mixed up the texture.  I would recommend ordering this.\n\nWontons:\nAnother excellent dish.  The texture of the skins were perfect, stuffing was great.  They included some kind of Sichuan peppercorn, which added a kick, but it wasn't overwhelming.  I would get this as well.\n\nRoasted Wolfe Ranch Quail:\nI docked a star for this one.  The quail was underdone, and the sticky rice... I have *never* had crunchy sticky rice before.  Given the rave reviews, I was really looking forward to this dish, and was extremely disappointed.  We told our server, who took it back; she told us that the chef said it was the special brine they use. Sir, unless you brine your quail in week-old blood, it was not the brine.  Paired with the fact I had to grind through the rice grains, I assume the kitchen had made a mistake with the timing on this one.  Sad.\n\nLiberty Farm Roast Duck (half):\nThis was fun!  Tortilla-like wrap, confit duck leg, crispy skin, cucumber and various condiments (duck liver mousse!), and no complaints.  I loved everything about this dish, and definitely recommend it.  The portion size is generous, and everything was cooked perfectly.  My only regret is that we'd already ordered so much, and I was getting extremely full (even after setting-aside portions throughout our meal) so I couldn't eat it all.\n\nBlack Sesame Cake:\nThis.  My approach to this cake will be like that of SPQR's tiramisu.  I will detour to drop in and order this from the bar if possible.  The cake is perfect; the ginger mousse, black sesame, asian pear topping are all perfect.  Get this.\n\nDan Ta:\nCrispy bruleed top, light filling, this was great.  I personally like the puff pastry crust, and would love to see that make an appearance here. \n\nService:\nThe service was great.  Our waitress, Sarah, was really attentive; our cups never empty, and our food was well paced.\n\nOverall:\nMy wife and I came here to celebrate our one year anniversary, and the food was good.  We definitely over-ordered, and had a doggy-bag of leftovers for two.  It was a bit below our expectations though, as we'd been expecting every dish to be stellar, compared to the hits and misses we received (especially that quail).  We probably won't be back unless it's with a group of friends (or I'm getting that black sesame cake.  If someone finds out whether you can order that from the bar/to go, please notify me immediately.  Or for the sake of my ever-expanding waistline, don't.).", "author": "Allen T."}

I tried the Luck, which was a tequila-based drink with banana and lychee.

I have lived in Asia for a very long time traveling often to China so I'm very familiar with authentic Chinese food.\n\nI am gluten intolerant and their gluten free offerings were there certainly, but they had not managed to provide suitable options to tweak the best stuff on their menu to be gluten free. After reading reviews, I had hoped that the Bao, Dumplings etc could have been accommodated (with the rice flour skins) but this was not so. In fact, even amongst things that were tweaked to be gluten free, e.g the orange chicken wings, or the smoked tofu, the gluten free offering was not with substitutes but with lesser versions of the original. For instance, they served us the orange chicken wings without the main sauce that is integral to the dish. They could very easily have provided a similar gluten free sauce on it but this was not even suggested. Smoked tofu was suggested without 'the smoke'. It felt like the gluten free stuff was second best to their originals.\n\nThe rest of our dining experience was similar. My fav thing was the eggplant.\n\nThe crisped pork main, though quite nice was lacking flavour on the meat, and was highly overpriced. Also food temperature was inconsistent - the pork was served nearly cold. \n\nThe service was great though initially we had a waitress who took our drink orders and we never saw her again (she decided to serve the table next to us instead). Typically on change of servers there is a customary polite notification to the diners about this. In this case she just started ignoring us. \n\nWhen the bill was presented, it came with a mango fruit bar bite which was utterly delicious.\n\nWe are foodies, and eagerly await trying out new places specially ones that are as critically acclaimed as this.

High quality, local and seasonal ingredients.  No food coma or MSG hangovers.  \n\nThe food here is well thought out, really playing on everything I grew up with, but introducing new techniques, better ingredients and fresh produce.  \n\nI had the ultimate critic, my Chinese born and bred mother.

We discussed how a 10 course banquet meal runs about $50/pp at the nicer restaurants in the Bay Area, not far from the prices at MJ.  \n\nWe decided on the 6 course, as I am always wanting to try more, especially the first time around.  It was a hefty amount of food for 2, the meat dishes, ling cod and braised beef both came with fluffy round bowls of rice.  We barely touched it and was stuffed after 4 courses.  \n\nSnacks open the meal, shrimp chips, sweet walnuts, beef jerky, pickled radish and green beans.

The sweet crunch of the bun and the sweet bbq pork went together so well. So original. \n\nSourdough scallion pancakes: so good, came with sauce, scallions, and fried onions.\n\nDungenous crab cheong fun: definitely not what we were expecting. Rice rolls topped with dungenous crab over sweet soy sauce. It was different but so good. I was not surprised that I like the crab because I like crab everything, but I didnt think I would like the combination. Def an item I would come back for.\n\nPork wontons with squid: black pork filled wontons next to stir fry squid calamari.

Such an interesting mix but very good. \n\n1/2 Duck: confit-style and Chinese-style duck next to each other with sauce, a side of duck pate, and side of scallions/cucumbers/cilantro. Hands down made us melt because it was melt-in-your-mouth and fall-off-the-bone delicious. The duck pate was my favorite part and paired so well with the Chinese-style duck. \n\nIn addition, we got the clarity and happiness cocktails, which were so refreshing and beautiful. \n\nFor dessert, we got one each: the black sesame cake, frozen honey, and coffee crunch puff pastry.

Really, this place?\n\nJust came back from stellar food + service back East and we've had this reservation at MJ for almost 3 months...I wanted to cry as to how sad this experience was.\n\nFirst things first: the wait. We had a reservation for 8:30p. Did not get seated until 8:50. No thank you for waiting or profuse apologies. We weren't the ones late, you were!\n\nWe had the following:\n\nProsperity and Luck cocktails (nicely done..bravo)\n\nPork Bao  (too sweet of filling)\n\nHot and sour soup (best dish we had...flavor on point) \n\nCarrot ma Jiang mian: confused about this flavor profile. Mustard greens? Didn't taste it. And those noodles? Thought I was having an Italian dish. They must've chopped up the chanterelles into itty bitty pieces bc it was barely noticeable. Then the dish tasted \"flat\"...no salt. Do not get.\n\nQuail: now I'm REALLY confused. It was stuffed with rice filling. Made me think this dish was French inspired. The rice had more salt than any flavor from the quail. Maybe I just don't like quail. But rice was still too salty.\n\nThen we waited...and waited even longer. The mad rush of the first 3 dishes came simultaneously and then nothing. A bunch of nothing in between the rest of the dishes. Here's the kicker: the beef fried rice came last....LAST people!!! Who ever was planning our dishes dropped the ball on this one. And when it did FINALLY come, it was underwhelming with heavy sesame oil taste, too many scallions and Broccolini greens chopped up in there.\n\nIt was kind enough that they gave us gratis dessert but even that we couldn't finish and I always finish dessert. The kombucha ice cream cake thing was just ehh.\n\nThe service felt pressured, insincere and extremely fragmented. So many of the staff including manager were more busy clearing tables for new clients then seeing our unfinished dishes just sitting there. Or even coming by to ask us how the meal was. Typical hyped up place that grew too quickly in accolades to actually deliver for all their clients the caliber deserved.\n\nSo, Michelin star giver, I'm going to have to question what part of my dinner + service tonight do you think was star worthy?

We stopped by on Thursday, July 28th around 7:45pm. There were three of us and we managed to snag two bar seats next to the door. About 10-15 mins later, a third seat opened up.\n\n*Luck: tequila blanco, banana, lychee tea, lime ($13)\n*Wealth: scotch, rye, cardamaro, lapsang tea, apple ($13)\n*Glenrothes: Dealer's choice ($13)\n\nThere was only one scotch/rye/whiskey cocktail on the menu and my friend ordered it, so I asked the bartender to make me something dark and boozy, but not too sweet. He ended up making me a Bobby Burns. I've only had this cocktail one other time recently and the rendition here was more my style. Not as light and sweet.\n\n*Munchies: pickles, jerky, nuts ($8)\n*Wontons: Monterey bay squid, pork, garlic, chives ($8)\n*BBQ Pork Buns: char siu, pork floss ($8)\n\nSince this was our third stop, we decided to order some small plates. The wontons were my favorite out of the dishes we ordered. I don't normally like squid ink, but it gave the dish an earthiness that I didn't mind. The chat siu baos kind of reminded me of pineapple buns and had a hint of sweetness I didn't prefer. (I'm not a big fan of sweet and savory together.) The bun itself is really thin and flaky, so you may be disappointed if you like thick breaded baos. But I liked it since I don't like a lot of bread.\n\nThe Munchies were really just small little snacks. We actually got four items since they also gave us some kind of chip snack which wasn't listed on the menu. The snacks were okay, but it was weird seeing items that are normally paired with some kind of protein served as snacks. I felt like the meat was missing. When eating the nuts, I thought, where are the prawns to make the walnut prawn dish? And with the chips. Where was the chicken for the chips to sit on top of? And the pickled veggies reminded me of the free appetizer plate that sits on top of the lazy susan at family dinners. Other than the jerky, which was a tiny portion, most of the munchies felt like leftover items from other dishes.\n\nThe bar atmosphere of Mister Jiu's is dark. Kind of like a secret, down low bar. I only wish they closed the front door, as it ruined the ambience a little for me. And it made the bar cold with the wind blowing in. I was a little uncomfortable and cold sitting there. From the bar, I did spy a huge window in the dining room. I never went over to look, but I'd love to come back for an actual meal. It looked like a completely different feel back there.

However, Mr Jiu's proved my skepticism wrong. \n\nThis place is not your quintessential Chinese restaurant that serve exotic dishes like chicken feet and the likes.  Although the cooking technique is Chinese, Mr Jiu's takes the food to a whole new level by adding western influences in the dishes they serve. I did the chef's tasting menu and everything was excellent. Their crispy turnip cake and Danish BBQ pork buns are flavorful and they're my favorites. I would also recommend ordering  their chilled beef tendon. It was really amazing! \n\nWhat made my night memorable was the service that Garret, one of the bartenders provided. I sat in a bar table next to this rude, racist guy who was saying all kinds of rude remarks to me and to him that I almost left without finishing my food and this whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively)! But he handled it professionally and I admire him for that. As paying customer, we oftentimes think that waiters are at our mercy when we dine at a restaurant but we forget the saying that respect begets respect! Our society has been led to believe that customers are always right but I am a firm believer that it is not always the case! One thing I learned as a frequent diner is you have to be nice to your chef and waiters, they're the ones who serve your food. You'll never know what they'll put in your dish if you misbehave! lol (Sorry, I know this is a restaurant review.

You have either the option of going with 4 courses for $48/person or 6 courses for $69/person. My girlfriend and I opted for the 6 courses. Of the 6 our favorite dishes were:\n\n- Devil's Gulch Pig Head - for a \"salad\" dish there was lots of meat and I'm not even complaining. Excellent flavors with a little bit of heat. The meat was sliced thin and very silky.\n\n- Salt & Pepper Soft Shell Crab - perfectly crispy with lots of great flavors. It's not traditional Chinese food, but I loved the garlic aioli that came with this dish. \n\n- Roasted Quail - I enjoyed the stuffed sticky rice in this dish; it was a perfect carb to compliment the meat. The quail was moist and sweet and a perfect portion for two. \n\nOverall this is solid Chinese food, but for the price point, I didn't feel like there was a \"wow\" factor to bring me back again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-02", "description": "I'm going to be honest - I was skeptical and went to Mister Jiu's with the intention of debunking the hype. I'm a first generation Chinese woman and literally grew up eating Chinese food almost every day. How good could this upscale and overpriced Chinese food be? I was sure that the the food at Mister Jiu's would be, what the Cantonese would say - \u8cb4\u683c\u5514\u98fd (expensive yet not filling) and \u5443\u9b3c\u8001 (tricking the Westerners). However, I am happy to report that I actually had a great experience and meal during my visit!\n\nIronically, Mister Jiu's is located right in the middle of San Francisco's grungy Chinatown. My friends and I had reservations prior and were seated promptly. The wait staff had a good understanding of their menu items and were generally attentive. At about $13, the cocktails are average-priced for San Francisco standards. I opted for the Prosperity for the first round and the Happiness towards the end of my meal. The cocktails were good but if you're looking for more than a light buzz, you may have to opt for some of the heavier drinks.\n\nFood-wise, we ordered Crispy Scarlet Turnip Cakes, Fermented Cabbage, Tendrils, Greens and Stems, Wontons, Steak Fried Rice, and half of the Liberty Farm Roast Duck, and two of the desserts to share between four people. Portion sizes are definitely on the small side but I dined with three other girls with smaller appetites so the amount we ordered we sufficient and we were all able to walk away feeling satisfied. \n\nOut of the the items we ordered, my favorite was the turnip cake and the roast duck. The tendrils were also fantastic but for the price we paid, I could have gotten something very similar  (taste-wise) at a local Cantonese restaurant for half the price. The portion would probably be at least doubled as well. The tendrils are topped with a small dollop of uni sauce but I'm not sure that it did much for the dish.\n\nThe turnip cake was perfectly crispy and topped with a slightly tangy mushroom ragout of sorts. I think it may have been vegetarian but I could imagine how much tastier this would have been if they stayed a bit more traditional with it and added the Chinese sausage. \n\nFinally, the main attraction - at $60 for \"half\" of the roast duck, I was expecting it to be the best damn roast duck I've ever had. Was it? No - it wasn't the best roast duck I've ever had but it was still very, very tasty. However, I loved this dish because I feel like it was truly an elevated version of classic Chinese food. Since they use duck breast, most of the fat was able to be rendered out which allowed the skin to become nice and crispy. The other classic sides were included (cilantro, cucumbers, green onions, duck jus, and a homemade peanut hoisin sauce) but my favorite addition to this was the duck liver pat\u00e9. I generally love pat\u00e9 and thought that this worked very well with the other elements of the dish. There was even dollops of plum jam on top of the pat\u00e9, which paired well with both the pat\u00e9 and roast duck. \n\nAll in all, Master Jiu's definitely surpassed my expectations. Will my mom berate me if she found out that I paid this much for Chinese food? Absolutely. But I'd probably still come again!", "author": "Maggi K."}

Great drink, especially on a warm day.  Refreshing and not too sweet.\n\n- Hot & Sour Soup: This is the soup upon which I now compare all other hot & sour soups to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-27", "description": "First things first: throw your previous ideas about Cantonese dining and banquet menus out the door.  Because at Mister Jiu's those words have an entirely different meaning than any unsuspecting Cantonese diner looking for fancy cuisine would expect.  Second, I don't think there's actually a Mister Jiu unless it refers to acclaimed chef Brandon Jew that heads this modern and forward thinking reimagining of the Chinese food that he was exposed to through the Four Seas Restaurant. \n\nWe stopped by for a quick visit after our very filling meal at Barbacco and largely planned to hit the bar and sample an a la carte item or two.  \n\nFinding the bar relatively quiet at the early hour, we asked the hostess if they had any dining room seating.  As luck would have it, they happened to have a single seating still open and we were moved to the dining room. \n\nThe dining room is considerably brighter than the bar area and has a wonderful view of the open kitchen where we were able to see Chef Jew at work and you also have a full view of the dining room where definitely the beautiful and hip people of the SF are now dining.  We were sold. \n\nTwo small details: the first was that the a la carte menu I had learned about is only available in the bar area. Boo!  The second is that a banquet menu is only available in the dining room and it consists of $45 for 3 dishes or $69 for 5 dishes. \n\nSince we had already had a main dinner, I asked how large the dishes were and was told they varied but most were modest in size.  No problem, I thought.  I can do 3 dishes.  Our order:\n\nSalt & Pepper Monterey Squid - four nice portions of squid (and a mix of fish) were deep fried with salt and pepper.  While the description sounded traditional, the flavors were thoroughly more modern.  If I had to guess I'd say more spices (harissa?) are used because it's definitely excites the palate. \n\nDungeness Crab Custard - a very Japanese rendition similar but richer and creamier than chawanmushi.  Nice chunks of crab.  Small bowl for each guest. \n\nWhole Ranch Game Quail - single quail stuffed with sticky rice and a very delicious Mister Jiu's lap cheong that was more a touch sweeter and much more flavorful than your standard lap cheong. \n\nSo there you had it.  We definitely ordered more than we needed but the mini banquet of 3 small dishes would have easily left most diners hungry.  But at $45 for a 3 course banquet, I was happy. \n\nLast point: I missed it entirely but it turns out that the \"banquet\" price (unlike any traditional Chinese restaurant that prices banquets) is actually per person and is a \"prix fixe\" price.  Holy sh*#!   You mean those 3 small plates just cost us $90!!!  Wow.  I guess I'm not taking my parents here.  It's also why I can't give 4 stars as otherwise it'd be a shoo-in. \n\nOther than that snafu (and I should have known with all the beautiful people here), it was a solid meal. Fantastic drinks, gorgeous dining room, and delicious, albeit pricey, food.  Mister Jiu's is a place for a special occasion meal.  But perhaps not so much as a second bite on a food crawl unless you've got money to burn.  \n\nAs for me, next time, I'll be at the bar enjoying the a la Carte dishes. \n\nMister Jiu's accepts credit cards including Amex (of course).", "author": "Randy F."}

This place went from a 5 to 2 stars. I haven't been here since June and am definitely not feeling the change to their menu. Their hot and sour soup used to be the best hot and sour soup I had in my entire life! Very similar to Roister's hot and sour, not thick and corn starchy, perfectly balanced with a good amount of vinegar. Now the soup has completely changed and even though it's still called hot and sour on the menu, it actually tastes like a strange medicinal borscht with cheaper ingredients(no crab) for the same price!\nThe crispy pork belly is the strangest thing we've ever ate at a restaurant. The accompanying veggies were completely inedible and tasted like they were doused in behr paint. The pork was slimy and pink and the crispy part of the skin was rock hard like it was deep fried in kitty litter. The service was a bit off this time as well, we received our mains before the soup, very confusing.\nI hope they revert to the old hot and sour recipe and step it up in their Fall menu :(", "author": "Amy K."}

It nods to Chinese origins but isn't bound by tradition so don't expect your normal Chinese food done perfectly but instead new upscale takes on dishes.\n\nShrimp toast (4/5) - elegant presentation.

Hadn't ever had anything quite like it\n\nSizzling rice soup (5/5) - beautiful chicken consomm\u00e9 with a nice sizzling rice with great bite/texture accompanied by nice fresh crisp greens. I've had the traditional Chinese preparations many times and think this is the height of refinement for the dish\n\nRibeye cap mapo tofu (4/5) - the tofu is indeed silken and soft with just enough spice to make it interesting but not too spicy. The beef is a nice twist on what is normally pork in the traditional preparation\n\nWagyu fried rice (3/5) - nothing too special about this except the beef which was nicely cooked but perhaps cut into too large of a chunk\n\nOrange chicken wings (3/5) - nice crispy texture but the sauce doesn't have me begging for more. It had flavor but nothing outstanding or addictive.\n\nWealth cocktail (4/5) - clear craftsmanship in this stiffer but not stiff drink. Nice with Chinese food surprisingly.\n\nService was great. I sort of wished they stopped asking if we wanted to change plates and just did or didn't do it since I found it a little disruptive to the experience.

Located in the middle of SF Chinatown, it's really a bit of a diamond in the rough! My bf and I couldn't get last minute reservations so we just showed up right as they opened and we were lucky enough to get a table (but definitely make a reservation to avoid any mishaps)! The main dining room, which was beautiful by the way, doesn't open until 5:45 I believe and you do have the option of eating the full menu at the bar but we decided to just start with cocktails at the bar and then get moved to our table once it was ready. The cocktails were incredible! I believe we got prosperity and vitality and both were yummy. Props to the bartender! Once seated, we ordered the scallion pancake and the mushroom bar from the small bites menu and also got the smoked tofu, white peach salad, and the carrot noodle dish (can't remember the exact name). All of it was was delicious! I was so surprised by how much I liked the white peach salad. The savory from the radish and the peaches added just enough sweetness to the dish plus the pine nuts added great texture and flavor to the whole thing. The carrot noodle dish was also incredible.

It's modern but still has feels like well done Chinese decor without feeling fusion. I came in a group of four on a Friday night. We all tried a cocktail - 2 Wisdoms, 1 Tranquility, 1 Wealth. All fantastic. \n\nWe shared the beef tendon which we were a little skeptical about but were all blown away. It was refreshing and had a great kick. Next we had the dungeness crab custard - so good! Not much of a soup and definitely more of a custard. Every bite was perfect with a bite of fresh crap each spoon. That was followed up with the cheong fun. It was delicious and simple. Very light which was good because we also ordered the fried rice which was filling  and flavorful. \n\nThe best dish was definitely the roasted quail with stick rice inside, lapcheong and figs! Wonderfully done. Felt like a well done traditional sticky rice stuffed poultry but then it had a fresh new twist fig and jujube. \n\nWe were stuffed by the end so we shared the black sesame cake between the four us.

Based on the pictures, the food looks creative and well executed. However, nothing was impressive to me, except maybe the sour dough scallion cake. The 2 stars are for the great cocktails and yummy mochi-like scallion pancake. \n\nHere's what I got and why it was a disappointment:\n\n1. Hot and Sour Soup - The taste was good but no different than the powdered hot and sour soup packets you can buy for $2 at Asian supermarkets. The consistency was super watery, unlike the thick kind that Chinese restaurants usually serve. Also, $18 for a small bowl of soup? Really??? \n\n2. Caviar Cheong Fun - The presentation was beautiful, definitely Instagram worthy. However, I was surprised to find that there is literally nothing in the rice roll. I bit into the rice roll... and the inside was just... more rice roll. Even in the most basic Chinese restaurants, there would be some shrimps wrapped in the rolls. And EVEN if this is supposed to be a fusion dish, it still shouldn't be just a roll of gigantic rice noodle. At least put some cool stuff in there or something... like duck? truffles? ANYTHING? The caviar certainly did not add any flavor to the rolls whatsoever. \n\n3. Mapo Tofu - The flavor was acceptable but the presentation was literally like a bowl of diarrhea. I had to dig deep to find that tofu. I understand that they are trying to create a un-deconstructed mapo tofu (does that even make sense), but it did not look appetizing. At least scatter a few scallions on top or something...\n\n4. Duck - Ahhh... The famous duck. That cost $60 for half a duck. On first look, it looks amazing. Nicely charred on the outside and pink and juicy on the inside. When I bit into it, the skin was soggy and flavorless. And the meat was so dry. The worst part is that the wraps that came with the duck was literally EXACTLY the same as the tortillas used for soft tacos... I was at least expecting the same kind they serve at Peking duck restaurants... Or at least a homemade bread. Not something that came straight from Safeway.", "author": "Betty T."}

Aside from visiting relatives, I was dragged to Chinatown for my mom's Chinese association dinners, red egg & ginger parties, and wedding banquets; some of which took place at Four Seas, one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in SF.\n\nDuring a banquet at Four Seas, I remember one of my mom's relatives talking to us with food in his mouth. I sat there in disgust as food particles started shooting at us from his mouth. My mom kicked me under the table to wipe that Kanye look off my face. He gave me a red envelope at the end so...honey, you can shoot food particles at me anytime for $$$. \n\nBack in 2013, I read about Chef Brandon Jew's new Chinatown project. It took 3 years to come to fruition in the former Four Seas and when it did, I knew I had to support an SF native. \n\nMy friend and I visited Mister Jiu's during the soft opening last night (grand opening April 12th). It was walk-in only...so we thought. We arrived around 5:52 pm and was told they were \"reserved for the entire evening\". I told the hostess I read that it was walk-in only and I tried to make reservations but couldn't. She said, we could eat at the standing bar (no stools and apps only). I asked to put our name down in case a table opens up and she replied, \"There's no open tables until 9:45 pm\". \n\nWell, 15 minutes later, Jew's wife sat us in a 60% empty dining room. She's an absolute sweetheart and one of the highlights of dinner. \n\nLater that night, a couple seated next to us said the same thing happened to them with the hostess. Only when they told her that they were leaving the restaurant, were they offered a table. Understandably, you don't want to overwhelm a kitchen during a soft opening but both situations were poorly handled by the hostess.\n\nMister Jiu's serves contemporary Cantonese food served banquet style. Choose any 4 dishes from the app, soup, salad, and noodle section, and 1 entree for $69 pp. Small portions for \"banquet\" style.\n\nI appreciate Jew's concept of modernizing and elevating traditional Cantonese cuisine but the food was too fusiony and left me craving a real Cantonese banquet meal.\n\nB A N Q U E T  M E A L - $69 PP (portions shown are for 2 people so each shared course was ~$28 each)\n(1) Devil's Gulch Pig Head, black vinegar, black radish, watercress: http://bit.ly/1USxHlq\nBest dish of the night! Excellent silky and gelatinous texture with an explosion of flavor and a subtle lingering heat.\n\n(2) Miyagi Oyster & Clam Custard, lap cheong, garlic, fava beans: http://bit.ly/1oNL2gL\nThe custard had a wonderful velvety smooth texture similar to chawanmushi but the garlic's pungency overpowered everything. \n\n(3) Cold Noodles, dungeness crab, peanut, sesame, chrysanthemum: http://bit.ly/1qBAh2F\nRefreshing and light but the japchae noodles were refrigerator \"hard\". \n\n(4) Cheong Fun, medocino uni, sprouts: http://bit.ly/1VfoK64\nI adore uni but you couldn't taste it as the herbs overpowered it. The uni that was there was oxidized. \n\n(5) Fried Chicken, sorrel, mustard, chili: http://bit.ly/1TK1YSh\nMy favorite banquet dish growing up, I read that they used Four Seas' recipe. Four Seas never served good food but I remember their fried chicken being decent. Sadly, this fried chicken was more like baked chicken - there was NO crispy, golden skin. The shrimp chips didn't have much shrimp flavor. \n\n**Tea Smoked Liberty Farm Duck, 12-day aged breast, confit, gizzard, hoisin, pancakes (+$40 supplement): http://bit.ly/1TK2aRp\nGreat smoky tea essence but half the duck breast was inedibly rare (uneven thickness). I couldn't chew two of the sinewy, raw pieces so I had to spit it out. We sent this back and instead of cooking the several undercooked pieces, they cooked everything. It was later taken back and removed from our bill. Skip this if you're expecting Peking duck with crispy skin throughout (the confit looked like a russet potato with flabby skin and the \"pancakes\" were thick flour tortillas).\n\nD E S S E R T - $13 EACH\n*Frozen Soy Milk, jasmine granite, rhubarb, caramelized puff pastry: http://bit.ly/1VJPxG9\nReminded me of the pastry chef's honey and almond dessert at Mourad which I loved. Great varying levels of textures and subtly sweet. \n\n*Black Sesame Cake, rosebud mousse, strawberry confit, ginger: http://bit.ly/25SCg2B\nGorgeous presentation but the cake was mealy. \n\nService was professional; our server was great but spread thin. Dinner took 3+ hours. Again, it was soft opening weekend so it was forgivable. \n\nThe new space is unrecognizable. The dining area is on the first level past the trendy, illuminated bar. Minimalist decor and an open kitchen. Bad acoustics so it was incredibly loud.\n\nMister Jiu's was good to try once for \"curiosity sake\" but it was a poor value (none of the courses were worth the $$$$) and too yipster IMO.

The food, the atmosphere, the location - what a delightful experience!\n\nI describe it as the \"Petit Crenn\" of Chinese food. It's family style, comfortable, but also classy. I was expecting the food to be a bit on the creative, fusion-y side, but Mister Jiu's actually did the traditional cooking well, which was sort of surprising given that its crew had very mixed background, but much much appreciated from a traditional palate. \n\nWe got:\n- Lotus Root Salad: slightly complex flavor with sweet almond jello mixed with savory crunchy lotus root. There are two types of lotus root, one fried chips and one pickled. Both delicious. But I think we prefer the lotus root to be less pickled and letting its natural crunchiness come out a bit more.  \n- Fried Rice: so good! fried rice is the one dish that I use to judge a Chinese place, and this fried rice is very flavorful and warm. Not super delicate but definitely impressive. \n- Baby Bok Choy: charred, adding scallop and prosciutto was a nice touch. \n- Steamed Alaskan Halibut: such a nice piece of fish and cooked perfectly with ginger, scallion, shitake broth. Classic Cantonese style steamed fish perfectly executed. \n- Lion's head: Also so good. These are pork meatballs mixed with tofu, pan fried and then braised with picked mustard greens. Very flavorful and warm. \n\nI liked how they brought white rice to accompany two of our saucy dishes. \n\nOverall, I very much enjoyed the meal. I know some people might say Chinese food shouldn't cost so much blah blah blah, but for this level of taste, comfort and quality, I think it's great value compared to a lot of restaurants in SF. \n\nI really like the dining room. You pass by a very large open kitchen and it overlooks one of the busier streets in Chinatown.

And we were the very first table to be seated.  For such a high profile opening, I was pleasantly surprised that the scene was not a chaotic one.  Management slowly eased into filling the floor.  Props.  \n\nThe restaurant had people taking video & photographs all throughout the evening.  Other than Brandon Jew's presence, this was the only \"celebrity\" factor all night.  Nice & low key.  Props again.  It could have been a circus.\n\nAs far as table service goes, it was warm, professional, & all the right notes were hit.  The only hiccup was forgetting to bring the miyagi oyster custard out.  They missed it & brought out the duck entree instead.  When I mentioned this to the server, it was rectified immediately w an apology sent from the chef.\n\nThe break down...\n\nThe lotus root salad.  A nice contrast of textures, but a bit bland.\n\nThe crispy daikon cakes.  Would have liked them a bit crispier.\n\nThe cold crab noodles.  My favorite item of the night.  Flavors were well balanced.  A refreshing & comforting dish.\n\nThe oyster & clam custard.  I didn't appreciate the texture mix of the cooked oysters w the gelatin.  Of course, others might try this & think it's mind blowing.  I didn't.\n\nThe duck.  So excited when this was brought out.  But the confit was too salty, & the breast was not optimally tender.  \n\nThe dessert of black sesame cake was unique.  The texture of the cake was off, but that didn't bother me.  And I loved the strawberry confit & the rosebud mousse.  \n\nThe house offered us a complimentary dessert, for the oyster custard mishap.  I chose the chocolate.  Let's just say the desserts rocked.\n\nOnly one valet guy for the entire restaurant (?!) translated to a very long wait for my car.  Since I saw that my car was parked right in front, just 3 cars over, once the valet finally returned, I told him that I would just pull her out myself.  The valet guy actually thanked me.  \"You're REALLY helping me out by doing that...\"\n\nSee?  When the situation warrants it...\n\nGreat space.  The light that comes through the windows from the neighbor's business signs makes the lighting after dark straight up gorgeous.  #luck\n\nPresentation gets an easy 5 stars.

Upon being seated, a woman comes up and tells us our server has gone missing and is obviously very irked and says she will take care of us for now and took our drink order. She is obviously not happy about having to wait our table. \nOnce he comes back he takes over service and was pleasant and informative. I will say the food was all good and deserves 4 stars but here's where the experience was oh so bad- the 2nd drink ordered was a beer. 10 mins later still no beer (it needed to chill bc it was a new box opened) so we asked for a cocktail now the beer could come later when it was chilled. Just 5 seconds before first dish came out, the beer came, we barely got a bite in and the second dish comes to the table. We aren't happy with this as the second dish was a hot dish and these tables are tiny... Way too narrow but we don't say anything. Then the cocktail comes so he has two drinks in front of him and we've got two dishes crammed along with our plates. Less than 2-3 mins later the third dish arrives and they attempt to fit it on our table and I had to ask them to slow down the courses and hold off on the third plate (we haven't even had a chance to take more than 2-3 bites of one dish).I could go on and on but It really ruined the entire experience. Food became cold sitting there. Had the timing been better, I think the food was creative and good but I can't really even comment because the experience was such a disaster.", "author": "Piper W."}

Although if you're looking for your typical Chinese takeout....this is definitely NOT the place to go. Mister Jiu's is a jewel hidden in a little Chinatown street, with a rather inconspicuous storefront. Upon entering, the bar with trendy fish tanks and the chrysanthemum chandeliers really contribute to the setting. I highly, highly recommend trying this place if you can get a reservation! The only reason Mister Jiu's gets 4 stars is that deep down, I know I can get a great, traditional Chinese meal for about 1/20 of the price that I paid at Mister Jiu's. I just can't believe I paid $18 dollars for Michelin Star hot and sour soup when the real thing is like $5. \n\n[Food]\nI've been to Mister Jiu's on two occasions. The first time, I tried the tasting menu. My favorite two dishes off that were the endive, crab, and caviar salad, and the desert, the blood orange. However, I would recommend sticking to the regular menu and ordering off that so you can try more dishes. The portions are definitely on the SMALLLLL side. I HIGHLY recommend the Prawn Toast (probably my favorite dish off the menu) and recommend the sea bass (a fine dining twist on a traditional Chinese dish). The Mapo Tofu also received a classy upgrade. I normally hate tofu, but I couldn't get enough of this dish! Moo Shu mushrooms was just alright. The only dish I really had an issue with was the hot and sour soup. The For a hefty $18, you get to try an extremely upscale, TINY TINY bowl of soup. When it was brought, my table of four stared at the bowl and wondered how we were supposed to split it. Everyone got about three spoonfuls. It was tasty and sour though. \n\nDefinitely don't skip the desert menu. I had the frozen whipped honey and the silken chocolate. Both were delicious and incorporated traditional Chinese flavors into great modern deserts. \n\n[Cocktails]\nI really like the cocktails here! I also liked that the restaurant was donating the proceeds of a charity cocktail to the Chinatown Fire Victims. I've tried the Prosperity, Happiness, and Wisdom. I really liked the Prosperity - it comes with a cool yin yang design. \n\n[D\u00e9cor]\nReally loved the hidden location and the chrysanthemum decorations. \n\n[Service] \nVery friendly and attentive wait staff!

The food is also a modern rendition of fusion Chinese food. Every dish has a traditional element to the recipe, but also new twists..  unfortunately, the new flavors can sometimes seem jarring not fitting to the rest of the dish. Good dining experience but no single dish stood out to me. \n\nMushroom bao - the outside bun was good, but the filling was strange. It was some type of green vegetable (cabbage perhaps) with pickled mushroom, and at first bite it was a stinging flavor of the vinegar from the mushrooms.\n\nSalt-baked McFarland spring trout - a whole fish. I can see the appeal in this dish because there is fish roe on top and it was baked in a cool way, but the sauce is nothing special (a standard garlic based oil sauce). Any flavor from the salt and lotus leaf was subtle at most.. honestly could not taste anything remotely salty or lotus-leafy, which I thought would be the special features of this dish. \n\nCheong Fun (rice noodle roll) - with dungeness crab and caviar on the outside. But why? There was nothing on the inside other than a few strands of greens. The roll was completely flat, and I would appreciate this dish more if there was stuffing in the roll (the crab will do). Perhaps the crab outside the roll is for esthetics. On it's own the crab did taste good. \n\nScallion pancake - the pancake was made differently than classical scallion pancakes. It was good and fluffy, but there wasn't much scallion taste (not much inside the pancake) and I'm not sure about the tiny bits of green flavoring on top. Kind of like the green bits of MSG/green onion/chives that you get on chips. \n\nTendrils - tendrils with lemon/sea urchin sauce. Bitter sea urchin sauce, not a favorite. \n\nAsparagus w/ shiitake and tofu, peanut sauce - very salty dish, especially the shiitake mushrooms that soak up all the salt. \n\nSilken tofu - with ginger, black bean, yellow chive. Too ginger-y, it was overpowering.", "author": "K. N."}

Ambiance is really special and if you can, snag a table with a view all the way down to the Ferry Building. We ordered a good selection for two that left us not too full, but satisfied. The Dutch crunch buns are a bit overrated, a tad sweet too. They are semi hollow in the middle and lack the fluffy bread I wanted. They needed more filling or bread. The filling wasn't so good that I'd be willing to get the again. However the scallion pancake was really good, and came with an amazing onion confit. The shrimp toast was good, though quite small if you're sharing. The wontons with squid were a good pick, but I think they needed a tad more of the spicy sauce (I got some of the black vinegar that comes with the potstickers which helped). The true star of the meal was the absolutely phenomenal duck, which was just so, so good! And good for two, and worth the $65 price tag. The peanut butter hoisin is great, the herbs, and the amazing duck liver mousse too. I love the mix of perfectly roasted duck breast (still rare) and the confit leg. Truly exceptional. My only gripe is that for a dish with that price tag, I found it cheap that they charge you $1 extra per wrapper/tortilla that you order beyond the initial basket they give you. It's already an expensive dish, and it seems unnecessarily cheap for something that isn't super expensive to make, and not what I'd expect from a Michelin starred place. As for dessert, the rhubarb tart was good, but the whipped honey is really lovely and unexpectedly so. I like heavier desserts but this was really excellent and worth getting.

I wasn't sure what to expect for Mister Jiu's but heard good things about it, so I wanted to give it a try. Also, they got a Michelin star.  \n\nWhen I got there, I was surprised that it was such a big space.  It opens up to a big room in the back despite the small Chinatown store front. Parking in Chinatown after 8pm on a weeknight was actually very easy.\n\nCocktails: lots of lucky sounding cocktail names\n- Luck: tequila based, with banana and lychee tea - very fruit, not overly sweet, but also very subtle on the alcohol\n- Wealth: scotch and rye based, more spirit driven but a bit sweet \n- Clarity: not a ton of gin flavor (good since I don't like gin), a hint of bitter lemon; refreshing \n- Tranquility: scotch based with five spice tea, more fruit forward\n\nFood: We ended up getting the Classics menu ($69/person) and adding on some duck.  It ended up being a good amount of food, and we definitely had leftovers, so we may have been better off ordering more variety from the regular menu. That said, the classic menu had basically everything we had planned to order minus the duck.\n1. Turnip cakes: nicely fried, good sauce on the side that's acidic to cut the oil\n2. Dutch crunch BBQ pork buns: think of a sweet Asian \"pineapple\" bun with the sweet crust on top, then filled with char siu pork.  The top of the bun was the highlight in my opinion; the pork was standard\n3. Dungeness crab cheong fun: there was a good amount of crab on top, and it's Dungeness season (finally!).  The cheong fun was not stuffed - more like the pan fried HK style ones; the starch part on its own was a little bland, but it was better with some chili sauce. The crab was great, though\n4. Tendrils: super tender greens and stems with an interesting sauce on top of meyer lemon, roasted garlic, uni - the sauce looked rich but was actually quite light. It was an interesting combination for the greens, and I really liked the dish more than I thought I would \n5. Shrimp fried rice: lots of textures with XO sauce, salted cabbage, fresh corn from the cob, shrimp, egg, etc - I liked this dish a lot. Also good with some chili sauce \n6. Sizzled black cod: great crust on it, a pretty big portion for one person. The broth was light but flavorful, and it came with greens (bok choy, celtuce - hard to find elsewhere) and some ginger \n7. Liberty Farm roast duck (add on): a pretty good portion since duck is a bit heavier, but it also wasn't cheap at $60 for a half, $100 for a whole duck. The presentation was great - there was a le creuset dish of thin pancakes, a glass jar of peanut butter hoisin, a small dish of duck liver mousse, and some greens. The duck was cooked medium to medium rare and had a good skin on it \n8. Black sesame cake: with a ginger mousse and Asian pear. The cake itself was pretty light and a little dry; the other things on top were interesting in texture. If you don't like ginger, you may not like this, but I thought it was a pretty balanced dish \n\nThey were good about refilling waters, but one of our drinks got missed (though they ended up giving it to us on the house). Food came at a good pace. \n\nOverall, the experience was fun.  Definitely make a reservation. \n\nThe food is obviously more expensive than at a traditional Chinese place, but the ingredients are also higher quality.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-10", "description": "tldr; I recommend giving the bar a try first before trying to get reservations or waiting for the full table -- while there were a few dishes that stood out to me, the price of the banquet menu, which is $69/pp and you CAN'T mix and match dishes between you and your other dining patrons, leaves me underwhelmed by the variety of options you can eat. Food at the bar is cheaper and same stuff as in dining room, so that might be a better choice? okay Chinese food, might get better with time -- very much elevated Chinese food, but not to great execution yet.\n\nThe SO and I have been really racking our heads with this one. Mister Jiu's has been one of \nthe most highly anticipated restaurants in the area, yet we found the experience to be fairly underwhelming and disappointing. Part of it might be the high price tag that came with the meal coupled with the fairly simple dishes. We want to like this place because apparently all of SF does, but we're not seeing it. I think we'll try coming back to eat at the bar in the future which might improve our experience since all my favorite dishes are served at the bar for a much more reasonable price. \n\nWe came on a Friday night, walk in. The wait was actually not as bad as we expected -- about 1.5 hours, so we went to a bar nearby the area and killed time. The tables here are small. Not sure if just because we got one of the less desirable tall tables on the side, but they had a lot of trouble getting dishes to fit on our table. \n\nAs they'll tell you, Mister Jiu's is served banquet style -- which means you get a set menu to share. What's most disappointing is that you have to pay about $70/pp, but you can only choose one item that you are basically splitting and sharing with the people at your table. If it were $70/pp and we got to each mix and match our dishes, I think I would have enjoyed the combination a lot more because then it would have felt like we got to try double the dishes. \n\nWe got:\nSalt and pepper monterey squid -- exactly what you would expect. Also they said there were forg legs but I definitely didn't taste any -- basically just like a fried calamari dish, though admittedly, much much tastier\n\nDungeness crab custard -- very underwhelming and I think really didn't do justice to what egg custards are like in Chinese culture -- maybe our mistake for expecting the typical texture, but it was flaky and broken, a bit of crab, but completely lacking in flavor\n\nFried rice -- I can't believe I'm saying this, but this was my favorite dish. The strip steak was DELICIOUS -- so perfectly cooked -- so tender and flavorful, the elements of the fried rice were really composed, this was great\n\nBaby bok choy -- oh god terrible. If you're going to do gourmet bok choy, I think Crystal Jade is the best for this in the city. The bok choy here was extremely tough and difficult to chew... not what I'm expecting when I'm in a more fine dining establishment\n\nRoasted quail -- I really appreciated the innovation and creativity of this dish, and I hope Chef considers doing more of these -- what I think Mister Jiu's is really well positioned to do is to not just elevate Chinese food in SF, but to elevate it with more fusion elements. To take more traditionally non Chinese ingredients but to infuse them with things like sticky rice and lap cheong, that's the kind of innovation and excitement I appreciate. The quail was well done, but I think the execution of the dish was not as great as ideation -- the concept is dope, but at the end of the day, the quail was almost too much in addition to the rice and the lap cheong inside. Might be worth tinkering with this one.\n\nService throughout the night was extremely awkward an uncomfortable. Lots of very long pauses from our waiter, lots of dropped silverware, misplaced silverware... when you're going to charge a fine dining price, half of fine dining is the quality of the service that comes with it. Maybe this is just a problem because they opened so soon -- we went toward the end of April, so we'll see if service has gotten better since.\n\nFinal price tag was a bit under the $200 range after some tea and tip... so yeah. Very, very high especially when we don't get to get different dishes to try.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

We all love restaurants, obsess over where to dine and really enjoy our food and how it's prepped. \nThe restaurant is so pretty but this establishment is not only a disappointment because of all the reviews we had read, but even if you were paying half the price it's still not good food. I'm shocked at what we were served. And how tiny the dishes are. \nSuch a shame as we eat out a few times a week. Yes it's more unusual in terms of presentation. And it's great to see a gentrified Chinese resto here. But I'd rather have something delicious than something instagrammable. All round, we all really didn't enjoy this experience", "author": "Josie W."}

All dressed up and expecting a memorable dinner, we arrived 10 minutes prior to our seating and was told to order drinks at bar. Which we did. Bar tab could not be extended to our bill but we had to pay right then and there. We also had to carry our filled cocktails through the dining room. Michelin star? HA! Not feeling very special at his moment, the hostess was getting our menus to be seated and on the way seated another party and did not even acknowledge us or our drinks as we waited for her. I guess that party got a table in the dining room as we were positioned in the hallway. The hallway. After that, we were asked by numerous waiters whether we wanted water. Michelin star? HAHA! We replied no, and then got up and just left. We left the cocktails on the table in the hallway. What joke.", "author": "Matthew S."}

Some dishes came out cold, pork buns were clearly sitting around for a while, fried rice was very basic and the duck (served two ways) was tough on one section and significantly overcooked on the other (sous vide part).  Also had the uni noodle dish (can't recall the name) which was surprisingly flavorless, I've had better dishes at dim sum.  The cocktails were excellent but I almost count that separately from the restaurant.  The broccoli was very good as was the whipped honey dessert, nothing else really worth writing home about.

My boyfriend and I came to SF for a little mini vacation, and in doing so I stumbled upon this place while finalizing some airbnb plans. I believe booking even almost a month ahead on a Saturday I was able to reserve something a little late in the evening (945 pm). Most places such as these either have a tasting menu or the idea really is like tapas/small plates. With that said I still feel like the price range here on Yelp for this place over exaggerates it a bit ... or maybe I'm just use to the bougie scene in LA where even non Michelin Star restaurants have the audacity to charge around the same price :P  My boyfriend and I were told that 6-7 plates would suffice for 2 people which of course can definitely add up.\nThe items my boyfriend and I ordered were the following:\n- Prawn Toast (3.5/5) : lovely presentation; nice opening to our meal\n- Sea Urchin Cheong Fun (4.5/5) : possibly my favorite item; I'm a sucker for uni; the sauce was deliciously tangy and slightly sweet; the rice noodle rap was a little thicker than I'm use but still okay; but that decadence of uni ... ugh we should've ordered two\n- Hot and Sour Soup (4/5) : emphasis on hot; it wasn't necessarily a spicy taste but a nice warming sensation (different from just the temperature if that makes sense) with each sip\n- Wontons (3/5): kind of interchangeable with a 2.5 rating. There's just something about thick casings that I'm just not completely down for. It made this dish taste more like an italian seafood pasta than wontons\n- Steak Fried Rice(3.5/5): a bit heavy on the salt and light on the wagyu. Still possibly one of the most flavorful fried rice I've had.\n\nMy cousin recommended most of the items we got. We weren't able to try the scallion pancakes because they sold out within the first few hours of opening. He highly recommend the duck, but my boyfriend is not a fan of duck and with the price point of that dish he was more than happy to avoid trying it.

November 8, 2016 will become a national mourning day in a future American History 8th grade text book, very similar to how June 4, 1988 Tiananmen Square massacre became a date of remembrance. But Garrison Keillor said it best, \"We liberal elitists are now completely in the clear. The government is in Republican hands. Let them deal with him. Democrats can spend four years raising heirloom tomatoes, meditating, reading Jane Austen, traveling around the country, tasting artisan beers, and let the Republicans build the wall and carry on the trade war with China and deport the undocumented and deal with opioids, and we Democrats can go for a long , brisk walk and smell the roses.\" It's with his wise guidance, my girlfriend and I abandoned social media and embarked on a night of smelling roses.\n\nMister Jiu is heaven sent in crisis like this. It's straight out of picture book of 1930s Shanghai or 1980s Hong Kong. On an unusually warm summer like November evening, we took a leisurely walk from SoMa to Chinatown after work. It was already dark, and streets in Chinatown looked clean, nearly deserted, and inviting, with all the lanterns. Mister Jiu's is tucked way on a wide ally street. In the dark, one could notice only three things: 1. the sign. 2. the brick building. 3. the window facing the working kitchen, first the pastry chefs then the actual American style kitchen for an American restaurant, with the exception of the wok, or at least one assume a wok exists. As this is a Chinese restaurant, after all.\n\nMister Jiu's newly minted Michelin star status means the family style meal is a bit more pricy than before, though truth be told, I hate those family style meals as it forces me to eat a lot - and I don't need a lot of force to eat a lot. My waistline does not thank me the next day. So I was delighted to see that there are a la carte options. First of all, book reservations. If you fail to do so, show up at 5:20 and be seated at the bar, they serve full menu at the bar, though you'd miss the mystically majestic dining hall so pretty that you expect Maggie Chueng would sashay through from behind the curtains in her signature Qipao and throw you that look from In the Mood for Love that will make you heart break all over again.  Second of all, be open minded. This is not your Asian Fusion emphasize on Fusion restaurant, this is your high end Chinese restaurant with a little fusion thrown in in case you really want it bad (I suggest you stick with your Olive Garden if that was the case.) \n\nA few stand out: appetizers are delightful, get whatever you want. Moo shu mushroom is a must. Charcuterie is a hidden gem. Everything on it can knock one's socks off - you really don't care for anything else after that. But then you eye the chicken wings and the fish as mains.  When all the dishes were devoured, then try their dessert, which is not at all Chinese (at least not all of them), and it'll revise your opinion about Chinese restaurants don't dessert. It does, and can be done well.\n\nThis is an atmospheric restaurant in addition to serving excellent food. Though the audience is a mixture of business folks and Chinese food aficionados, I imagine beyond anything else this could be the killer date restaurant, with an exotic view into the Chinatown neon signs and street, it really feels like you ought to take your best looking date out about town here. It serves everything from soups to nuts, bar drinks and dinner, then dessert. To top it off, it has been awarded a 2017 Michelin.", "author": "Victoria E."}

The food was mediocre but the service was extremely disappointing. \n\nThe pork buns, eggplant and tendrils were tasty, but the pig's head, fried rice and lion's head meatball didn't stand out to me.  I'm a huge fan of hot and sour soup but this version was a let down.  I know it's not supposed to be traditional, but this was more like spicy tomato soup. \n\nService was SO disappointing and uncomfortable from start to finish.  We were seated upstairs at a round table where a plant was right in the middle of two seats.  One of the leaves of the plant was in my sister's face so we asked for it to be turned.  The server's response was \"Can't you just move over?\"  If she moved, it would've put her side by side with one person with an enormous gap on the other side.  Turning the plant is a simple task!  All through our meal, the servers were lackluster -- no enthusiasm at all!  The tip of the iceberg was when they forgot to put in the order for the MAIN DISH of the evening - the salt baked trout.  I didn't notice until the end because I thought the long wait time was to be expected.  When we finally checked in on it and found that the order hadn't been placed, the server asked if we still wanted it and if we did it would be another ~45 min wait.  Well, no, of course not because we had already finished the other dishes.  The server was not apologetic at all, didn't even bother asking if we wanted to order anything in it's place before going on his (un)merry little way.", "author": "Phoebe L."}

Much of it was bland and needed sauce(and we ordered many items). Positives: the decor and ambience are great, the shrimp toast and the duck were quite good, and the cocktails, once they arrived, are excellent.\n\nThe manager was sympathetic at end, after we asked to speak with him, and made allowances on our bill.

(https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_aSs5dSAabuwnXUGBPzASw) and Cherylynn N. (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg), two of my go-to sources, I was in no hurry to dine here.  I later learned that a friend had ties here and he invited me to try this place, but never found the time.  My cousin called me about a birthday dinner she was throwing for her dad, my uncle, which happened to be here.  On a cool San Francisco Saturday evening, we met here at 6 pm for our reservation.\n  My memories of Four Seas span from an upscale carpeted restaurant with a bar (only others were Imperial Palace, original one on Grant with a doorman, and the Empress of China) in the '70's to a decaying large party venue for family celebrations (Red egg and ginger parties or wedding banquets).  The chef Brandon, for whom this restaurant is named (Jew in Cantonese spelling), obviously had a vision when he partnered with the property owner in creating this new dining destination.  After leaving Bar Agricole, he toiled through the city's process in molding his creation here.  \nWith this knowledge, I tempered my expectations.\nHere's what my cousin ordered, all courses shared:\n\n1) Steamed Santa Barbara prawns, off menu, supplement (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MmEw0FpeZ4jrQBjnUPUrFg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Fresh and sweet tasting, but wished the dipping sauce was more bold.\n\n2) Devil's Gulch pig head (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sz8oxsO-X9ZDXQKlt3vb_w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - At first glance, one would wonder, 'what is that?!'  Once you start eating, your chopsticks keep reaching for more.\n\n3) Maine lobster custard (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=psQzHd0cixHBurkCVOM3xg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Think of a Japan chwan mushi jazzed up.  Yes, that's lobster there.\n\n4) Sizzled ling cod (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aYWmc8D7qNpkFSE6Ttgb7Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Few western restaurants perform this dish well and mostly it'll take a Hong Kong chef to perfect this.  This is pretty darn close to perfection.\n\n5) Roasted Wolfe Ranch quail (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mummduSEOwVBFbzMBGPHpg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Probably my least favorite dish as it just didn't wow me.\n\n6) Braised Holstein beef claypot (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VkCSd2YS1hmel6HaGG4xcA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - No need to look further for my favorite, especially with my appetite for quality beef.  The meat was perfectly tender and flavored while the sauce made me want to face plant that plate in licking the last drop of sauce.\n\n7) Smoked Hodo tofu (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SgcjV4il2kBalCxlEAPYMQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Good execution of in-season vegetables with the famed Hodo tofu squares from the East Bay.  \n\n8) Hand cut noodles (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=d_YVjfsGtUvFOegOnP8Piw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My first impression of hand cut noodles are generally a rounder egg noodle dish; think chow fun for those familiar with Cantonese cooking.\n\n9) Tea smoked Liberty Farm duck, half, supplement (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=g4-6r7DT_OtppTJFGi41qQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) -  condiments (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=II3Pc8-Fopd0lJyi4hSPBg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Impressive rendition of his play on Peking Duck, infusing the tea flavors for a drier yet tastier duck.  Served with the usual general accompaniments of pancakes (bok beng), cilantro, green onion, cucumbers, and Hoisin sauce (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=II3Pc8-Fopd0lJyi4hSPBg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q), you build your own burrito with this.\n\nOur waiter was very helpful in helping my cousin craft our dinner menu.  We had leftovers as there was plenty of food and then some.  We did not have dessert as my aunt brought a birthday cake for my uncle.  Service was prompt and efficient in filling drink orders and glasses and removing empty plates.  \nBack to stereotypes, my parents would scold me if I brought them here and they saw the prices.  They would automatically compare our meal to something they had ten or fifteen years ago or talk about what they would pay for this meal (of course, not of this quality) in the Sunset or Richmond Districts.  I would describe this restaurant as a western restaurant (service, ingredients and food quality, and ambiance) with an Asian or Chinese flair.  If you look at it that way, you'll get over the prices and enjoy your meal.\nI certainly enjoyed my meal here!\n\n***  Since this meal, Mister Jiu's was awarded one Michelin star.

Walking in, the ambiance is classy and upscale - there's a gorgeous bar at the front and a beautiful dining area at the back. This is the perfect spot for a date.\n\nWe started with cocktails and ordered Happiness and Harmony. Happiness quite literally is a tangy cup of happiness, bursting with tartness. Harmony had a nice minty-ness from the Perilla. Both drinks were very smooth!\n\nFor appetizers, we first ordered the Oysters that came with a Ginger Mignonette sauce to drizzle on top and a wedge of lime. The oysters were absolutely delicious - smooth, fresh, a touch of sweetness, and a nice ginger bite from the mignonette, which paired really well.\n\nNext up we had the Hot and Sour Soup with Dungeness Crab. I've had many different hot and sour soups and this one just burst with flavor. The soup had a silky texture and a perfect peppery kick at the end. The crab was cooked perfectly and, to my surprise, went really well with the silky soup.\n\nWe then had the Prawn Toast, on the server's recommendation. This was by far my favorite dish of the meal and I'd highly recommend it! It had this perfectly salty layer on top with the shrimp and some sesame seeds providing a nice contrasting crunch. The bread underneath was so soft that the whole thing just melts in your mouth. Yum! :)\n\nFor our mains we ordered the Salt and Pepper Wings and the Steak Fried Rice. The wings were outstanding with a crispy skin and a jalape\u00f1o bite, so be a bit weary if you can't handle your spice. How do I describe the Steak Fried Rice? The rice was silky smooth and also just melted in my mouth. The egg stirred in was perfectly cooked and the steak was tender and fatty.\n\nOverall, the food here was outstanding!

For the price, totally not worth it. But it was fun to try once. It was around $65 per person. We tried a bunch of dishes and I would say second best was the trout. Get the trout! It was juicy and there weren't that many bones to pick through. \n\nWhat you can skip: the duck. Don't expect Peking duck. It just doesn't taste nostalgic at all. \n\nIt's funny how they call some of the appetizers charcuterie like white chicken with chili sauce and sliced beef tendons. You can tell there's a modern twist to every conventional Chinese dish on the menu there..and I guess it's a good restaurant for people who aren't familiar with authentic Chinese food to gain more comfort having, but the restaurant just didn't have many dishes we were wowed by or wanted to come back for. As asians, we were disappointed and kind of surprised it earned a Michelin star. \n\nGood to try once just to try, but again, if you get anything there, get the wagyu steak fried rice!

While the food clearly has Chinese origins Chef Brandon Jew has gone far beyond preparing the standard dishes and has seemingly created his own cuisine.  That's right, it is not Mandarin, Cantonese, or Sichuan.  It is a fusion of different Chinese regions and cooking techniques along with western flair and class.  Mr. Jiu's food is spectacularly distinct and a cuisine of its own.  Smack me with a splintered ruler, but I am going to call it \"Jiu-ish\" (HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!)\n\nOK, Now that I got that out of my system, three of us came here and we ordered a dozen dishes or about half the menu that night.  I think the menu changes frequently.  All of us are veteran eaters of Chinese food and have dined in the finest Chinese restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New York, and SF so we ordered dishes which sounded reminiscent of our favorite Chinese dishes.  Seafood, claypot rice, vegetable, tofu, and dim-sum plates.  It was obvious that each dish was made with the absolutely freshest ingredients, thoughtfully prepared, and cooked with the greatest of skill.  Portion sizes were very generous, 3 people could share each dish.\n\nOur favorite dish was the trout.  It was uniquely prepared with lotus leaf wrapping and baked in a salt-based coating, a technique akin to preparing \"beggar's chicken.\"  The fish was served with roe, which added a crunchy texture, and a delicious sauce.  The trout was so delicious we savored every tender morsel.  The Dutch Crunch Char-siu Bao was the best bao we have ever had.  The crunchiness of the bread and the consistently delicious filling brought this simple staple to new heights.  The Claypot Rice with Duck Sausage was also divine.  The rice was cooked in a cilantro broth which gave it a unique and delicious twist. We loved each and every dish and even though we were stuffed to the gills due to the large portions we could not resist sharing a dessert - everything on the dessert menu sounded amazing!  We ordered the Whipped Frozen Honey which consisted of thin wafers of whipped frozen honey and white chocolate served in a bed of custard and sorbet.  It was an amazing finish to an amazing dinner!!!\n\nNow as strange as this may sound, we all drank water with our meal and even the water seemed to taste just right, served chilled, but not iced, in a carafe.  There is ample parking at the Portsmouth Square garage just two short blocks downhill.  Last but not least the waitstaff were very professional and courteous.  The total for our meal after tax and generous tip was under $100 per person and while this is not cheap we all felt that the experience was well worth the price and more!  We will definitely be back to experience more \"Jiu-ish\" food!!!!.", "author": "Ethan Z."}

If you do plan on dining at the bar you MUST walk to the dining room to check out the view looking east towards Grant St and the Transamerica Pyramid - absolutely breathtaking. \n\nThe bar has a limited menu, which worked for us as we pre-gamed at Wayfare Tavern before Mister Jiu's opened and only wanted appetizers and cocktails. \n\nThe cocktails are simply out of this world. I stuck with the gin concoctions - both the Harmony and Happiness are wonderful; my favorite being Harmony. My friend stuck with the Luck cocktail, which has a lovely smoky/sweet balance to it. \n\nApps we shared:\n\n-Salt & Vinegar shrimp chips: these were delightfully crispy and adequately salted. No real vinegar flavor was detected, sadly. And I am a huge salt & vinegar fan.\n\n-Potstickers with Riverdog Farm chicken and rainbow chard: these tasty little parcels were the savory app highlight for me. The wrapper was cooked well and the fillings were well-seasoned. The black vinegar with ginger dipping sauce pulled this together nicely.\n\n-Sourdough scallion pancake: this smelled fantastic and tasted....ok. It almost was a little too doughy for my taste. The scallion came through wonderfully and their take on a \"french onion dip\" - chives and fried shallots on top - was a nice addition.\n\nDessert:\n\n-Frozen whipped honey. OMG. Please. Do yourself a favor and order this. Pair with a pour of Lo-Fi gentian amaro. Send me a message thanking me for this wonderful discovery. Simply out of this world between the honey, jasmine jelly, grapefruit sorbet, walnut crisp, and white chocolate sheets. The Lo-Fi is light, sweet, and very botanical and highlighted the \"blink and you miss it\" whisper of jasmine jelly.\n\nSince we only interacted with the two bartenders that night I can't comment on the dining room service. Our bartenders were super friendly, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. Ashley in particular was an absolute gem.

We were seated immediately, but after that, our waitress would just disappear on us. Dishes were dropped off, but none were explained, and while the quality of ingredients seemed to be top-notch, the food itself only reminded me that sometimes you don't need to mess with the original to try to make it better. Green onion pancakes? Light and airy, but where are the green onions? It's almost a deconstructed form with the accompaniments on the side instead being in the actual pancake. Prawn toast? Flavorful, but the single piece of layered toast would've been just great without any roe or deconstruction of the original. Steak fried rice? The beef was incredibly tender, but again, there are broccoli florets and minimal egg in this dish. It's not really a fried rice. The duck was definitely the show stopper. It's seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the pancakes/tortillas that come with it cut the heavy handed salt. I liked the pate as a spread, but it would've been just fine with more scallions and hoisin. The black sesame paste dessert was also underwhelming and didn't carry any sesame flavor. Their daan tat is actually a poh tat, but it's super burnt and carries a smoky flavor that overwhelms the egg and butter that's supposed to come through; the temperature of the tat was also lukewarm.", "author": "Danny C."}

A few of our favorites were:\n\nDrunken shrimp\nFried rice with wagyu beef (how do they make their fried rice taste so good??)\nSteamed rice noodles w crab\nPotstickers (yes - believe it or not!) - amazing thin, delicate wrappers with delicious filling perfectly cooked\n\nThey also had a clever take on Brussels sprouts, which are almost too popular amongst restaurants these days - - but we still like to order them.

I am guessing it is the modern decor, because it certainly is not the food.  I did the \"tasting menu\" and the sauces on at least two of my dishes were salted beyond the point of tasting good.  On top of that, some of the base ingredients did not taste super fresh like the crab for example.  \n\nOn the service side, pretty much everything I saw lived up to some of the other reviews of this restaurant - bad service.  It is pretty much like you don't exist.  I even heard staff complaining about the Chef.  Also, my courses were super slow arriving.\n\nWith so many other great options in this city, pass on this one.", "author": "Chris C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-23", "description": "Been wanting to try Mr. Jiu's since it opened and finally got around to it.  I enjoyed the experience but wasn't really impressed by it. So, I'm going to say it was just ok. Here's why. \n\nMy GF and I arrived early when the bar was open but b4 the dining room was. My GF ordered the \"Luck\" cocktail and I had a martini. Took a sip of the cocktail; didn't like it but I'm not a cocktail drinker. My martini was ok; served very dry and cold but they didn't have my favorite gin and olives were too small for my taste. Also didn't like that they required you to close the bar bill (and didn't add it to the dinner tab) b4 being seated.  \n\nThe dining room was very nicely decorated in a modern style that reminded me of Miyamoto's in Napa.  I was particularly interested in the space because my wedding party was held there over 40 years ago when it was upper banquet floor the Four Seas Restaurant.  Didn't look the same, of course.\n\nWe were seated at a very nice but very small table next to the window overlooking Grant Ave; probably one of the 2 best tables (in terms of view) in the house; there was a similar table located at the other end of the room. \n\nWe didn't like the offerings in the tasting menu ($69/person) and decided to order ala carte because we didn't like choices on the tasting menu.  Another reason to order ala carte is that we both had to order the same thing; one could not choose the halibut and the other the quail for the final course.  We wanted to try both of these dishes, so the tasting menu wasn't an option for us for that reason alone.\n\nFor the opening courses, we ordered the prawn toast, the headcheese the won ton w/calamari.  Didn't care for the shrimp toast at all.  It was pretty to look at but it I just got toast and no taste of shrimp at all.  On the other hand we both liked the headcheese and won ton dishes.  The headcheese was sliced paper thin and was delicious but the dish didn't need the thin pieces of amaranth bread that topped and hid the headcheese on presentation.  The won ton skins were blackened w/squid ink and filed w/what tasted like a pretty standard pork mixture and that sat on a spicy bed of sauteed calamari.  Liked the concept and presentation but didn't find the taste all that memorable.\n\nFor the main dishes we ordered the squash, the halibut and the quail.  Loved the halibut, the other 2 dishes not so much.  The halibut (a very large piece) was perfectly cooked and was flaky and tender; it also wasn't overwhelmed by other flavors; the fish was the star.  Excellent!  \n\nUnfortunately the quail stuffed w/\"new my fon\" (the kind of mixed meat/veggie/spice flavored short grain rice that you often get for dim sum served in a banana leaf) unfortunately was overcooked; the quail was tough and the rice a bit mushy.  The flattened presentation of the quail however was very good.  The squash was served w/a topping of lop cheong, dried scallops, bonito flakes and xo sauce.  It was ok but nothing really outstanding about it.  We were also comped a bowl of the \"egg drop soup, which was a nice gesture; The soup was delicious with the sweet taste of fresh corn but it was more like a chowder than egg drop.\n\nLastly, we had the 2014 Pere Mata Cava Rosado \"Trepat\" sparkling wine w/dinner.  I like having sparkling wine w/dinner when I dine out at expensive places but they didn't have any that I was particularly drawn to.  \n\nOnly ordered the cava because it was the cheapest at $56/bottle.  It was ok but it was a rose, which I don't usually order, and came w/a screw top so the \"fun\" of hearing the cork pop was lost. They also didn't place the wine in an ice bucket next to the table.  Instead opting to recap the bottle and hold it in a wine cooler somewhere to serve as necessary. I would have preferred the traditional service approach for the sparkling wine \n\nTotal cost of the meal w/o the wine was $130.  About the same as it would have cost for the tasting menu but, as I mentioned, I think the tasting menu choices were too limited.  Don't care how great others way the turnip cake was, it's just turnip cake and I don't like turnip cake all that much to begin with.  Same for the cheong fun.  It's a very common dish;dressing it up doesn't make it any more interesting. Baked BBQ buns and fried rice also aren't things I care to eat. And the tendrils (pea shoots?) vs squash was a push.\n\nTotal cost of the bill w/drinks was almost $290 including tax, tip and the SF surcharge.  Would have been better to just skip the drinks which cost about $100 and focus on the food which is what I'd suggest others do.  Would recommend, the egg drop soup, headcheese and halibut. The won ton was just ok but worth a try.  Would pass on the prawn toast and squash but would give the quail another try and hope for better.\n\nOverall, it was an ok experience but can't say that I'm a fan.  Probably will not be back; too many other expensive dining options in SF for just an ok experience but worth a try if you haven't been there yet.", "author": "Martin C."}

We had a variety of dishes which were often overseasoned and there wasn't a single dish that was memorable or worth returning for.  We had the Dutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns, Moo Shu Mushrooms, Hand Cut Noodles, and Chicken Wings.\nI didn't really care for the service either.  Our server asked if this was the first time at the restaurant, but did not provide very much information after we answered that it was our first time.  The wings and pork buns came out and we were finished with these dishes for a good 15 minutes before the server bothered to check on us again.  He also dropped the ball a few other times - I asked to see the drink menu during dinner and that never showed up and water was never refilled unless specifically requested.\nDefinitely not worth the $75/person we paid for dinner plus one drink.", "author": "Gloria N."}

I'm going to start off by saying, I work in an industry, that's all about customer service... making sure that the client always leaves with an amazing experience. I didn't feel that way, neither did the 3 other guest that came with me to Mister Jiu's. \n\nIt started off at the bar. Myself and my boss got there before our 8pm reservation, on a Friday night (wasn't too busy) as we made our way to the bar to wait for our other two guest, we found two stools to sit on. Some time had gone by, and still, no acknowledgement from the bar tender... until my boss decided to speak up, and ask how his night was going. As his making our drinks, a couple walked into the bar area, and he immediately acknowledged them by saying, \"evening ma'am, evening sir!\" My boss and I looked at each other confused. \nOur other guest arrived, so we other more drinks. \n\nWe than get walked to our table, our server introduces herself. I noticed her tattoo, it looked similar to my, so I showed my tattoo on my arm looked like hers, and she seem to care less... and kinda continued with her script about the restaurant and food. The food was order, wine was order with the help of one of their sommelier. The wine came, the food started coming... the food I gotta say was amazing... the bottle of wine was good... but here comes the experience... with each dish being put in our table, we must of had 3 runners, and 2 sommelier... neither of them as they dropped off the dishes stop to say what it was, so we guessed each time. \n\nBy this time, we had maybe had a glass and half each of the bottle (only 3 of us were drinking) our main server comes to clear some plates, and knocks the bottle all on the side, and onto the wall. My boss immediately asked if she's ok... she's fine she says. Runs to grab something to clean with, and doesn't say sorry, but she said she will give us a complimentary glass... we all looked at each other, confused, she clearly dropped more than a glass... plus who says that? \n\nWe continue to enjoy our food, we had finished what was left of the wine... one of the sommelier comes us with a bottle, and 3 glasses and says, \"I heard your server had a bit of an accident and spill a bit of your wine bottle.\" My boss said, \"oh, it was more than a bit of wine, she spill it all over the wall and floor.\" He then argued by saying, \"oh no, it was a small spill!\" Who argues about that? To a paying customer. He proceeded to literally do the smallest pour of wine you can imagine. \n\nWe order a desert, our bill came... we didn't get greeted out, by anyone. By this time, I gotta say... the food was so amazing... I've been telling everyone I know about it... and a long with that... the terrible service we got that Friday night. Every single person that I've told the story to, have said. They should've not charge you for the bottle. It wouldn't have cost them anything. \n\nI would love to come go back, but for the money I would spend there, I almost don't want to chance it, if I get a similar service.", "author": "Cisco M."}

We got to eat and drink here recently for a special event, and it was tasty, albeit $$$.\n\nTHE OVERVIEW.\n- Service can be very spotty. While Brandon himself, should you run into him, is humble, charming, and a funny guy, some of the serving staff is downright snooty, and it can be an actual challenge to get service at the bar from some of the female staff. I had one of those experiences where I wanted to order more at the bar, but after our first drink order, my fianc\u00e9 and I were blatantly ignored, sooo no more $$ spent there \n~ Despite being a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, the patrons here are dominantly white. More of an observation than anything.\n- The cocktails are hit or miss, although it is clear that time and care goes into each drink. The yin-yang symbol that adorns some of the drinks is a classy touch. \n+ The food here is INCREDIBLE. We got to chown down on:\n  + SALT & VINEGAR SHRIMP CHIPS (genius and addictive)\n  ++ SOURDOUGH SCALLION CHALLAH (oh my god this was amazing and I love you,        Mr. Jew, for making it)\n  + EGG DROP SOUP (almost a more elevated version? still darn good)\n  ++ GLAZED BERKSHIRE CHAR SIU BBQ PORK (again, not the style I'm used to, but still ah-may-zing)\n  + RED BEAN CHOCOLATE BABKA (life-changing stuff)\n\nThe price point makes me hesitate at returning (we spent $150 for two people), but if I can get a good group together, it might be worth it!", "author": "Claire S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-29", "description": "The best thing about Mister Jiu's is the ambiance. From the wall art to the mid-century furniture to the alley view, everything about it is just perfect. It's a lovely mix of old and new. Also, I MUST have the round table with the integrated, seamless lazy susan. I MUST.\n\nYou have the option to choose from two meal sets:\n-3 courses for $45 per person\n-5 courses for $69 per person\n\nPLUS any supplements that range from $40-100. Because it's family style, your entire party needs to agree on the dishes to get and it'll be portioned out to your group size. The portions are very generous so I wouldn't worry about that. We ended up ordering 5 courses plus 1 supplement (none of them desserts), and it was WAY too much food. It was one of the few times I couldn't even force dessert into my belly. My suggestion for you is to either get 3 courses plus 1 supplement (if you REALLY want to try one of the supplements) or get 5 courses but make one of those desserts. It'll be tempting to try everything on the menu but trust me, not stuffing yourself here makes the food taste that much better.\n\nHot and Sour Soup - This is a creative take on the traditional hot and sour soup. The tofu is pre-molded into the bowl and they pour the soup into each bowl tableside. The broth has the same tart flavors, but they didn't thicken it with cornstarch so it has the consistency of a more regular broth. I liked it.\n\nSquid and Pork Wontons - One of my favorite dishes of the night. The dumpling skin is made from squid ink so it comes out black. It's also squid because you get squid with the dumplings. This dish also had a slightly tart, citrusy flavor.\n\nCheong Fun (Rice Noodle Roll) - Even though the caviar and salmon roe seems to be the most appealing aspect of this dish on paper, the actual rice noodles are the star. They're very thick and tightly wound so you get a nice big bite from it. I actually don't think the eggs add as much to the overall flavor as the sauce did. Also slightly tart. \n\nRoasted Quail - Stuffed quail is one of those dishes that you usually have to pre-order at Chinese restaurants so it was nice to get to eat this. There was a slight bitter finish at the end of each bite, and I couldn't pinpoint the source (whether it was from the meat or the sauce). It wasn't of serious concern but we mentioned it to our server anyway and they basically had a discussion in the kitchen as to what it could've been. There was still not real conclusion since the bitterness wasn't intended but I appreciated the effort on their part. That can easily be offset by taking a bite of the fig anyway.\n\nBraised Beef Tongue, Brisket and Short Rib Clay Pot - This was so good! It comes with rice (thank god) because the sauce is so good, you just need rice to soak it all up with. I like how each pot has different pieces of beef so you really do get a variety of textures.\n\nTea-Smoked Liberty Farm Duck - This is their version of peking duck, and something I had to order because it's one of my favorite dishes. I like that they serve it with pancakes (instead of mantou - steamed buns) because that's how it's done in China! Plus pancakes add a pleasant chewy texture. One of those in our group did want the mantou so they gladly brought out a few for him. What's most different about their version is that you get duck pate, in addition to the hoisin and peanut sauce, to smear onto the pancakes. It adds a really rich flavor and creaminess that isn't overpowering. You also get a few pieces of chopped liver that we just ate on the side. It didn't really make sense to include it in the wrap. While I liked some parts of this, it cost a whopping $50 for half a duck so I wouldn't recommend it unless you're dying to try it. This is one dish where I prefer the traditional version just because of the ultra-crispy, sweetly-glazed skin.\n\nI would be interested to see what older Chinese folks think of the food here. It was definitely fun eating family style and see some of my childhood dishes come out in a different way.", "author": "Shannon L."}

We weren't seated until 30 minutes after our reservation. Along the way the host told us that we would be seated in one minute, \"Don't order drinks from the bar yet, we're setting up the table right now\". Once we were seated, our waitress was awful. She had a ton of attitude and offered no help with the menu. When asked what else we should order and if we had enough food, she gave a complete non-response. She wouldn't even point out her favorite items on the menu. We ended up not having enough food and never asked if we wanted to order anything else...\n\nThe size of the tables were also problematic. We loved the big round table with a lazy susan, but our party of 6 was too small for it. We felt too spread out and wished we were at a more intimate table. This was really a shame because we had called ahead of time to try to add more people to our res, which seemingly could have been easily accommodated but never got a call back.

Honestly, the hot and sour soup would be reason alone to come back. For smaller plates, we shared the squid ink wontons (5/5), Napa cabbage (4/5) and the steak fried rice (6/5). The wontons were delicious and spicy with a nice combination of the sausage stuffing and calamari. The steak fried rice was incredible.

Now, honestly... I'm usually very skeptical of paying big bucks for *fancy* Vietnamese or Chinese food, but the flavors and quality of dishes at Mister Jiu's was great.\n\nI arrived a little earlier before my friend and the staff politely let me know that they would seat me when the party was complete--which was fine! Upon entering the dining area, we were exposed to all the great smells and sounds of the open kitchen. Some cute chefs too ;).\n\nFor starters we each ordered a cocktail, I got Happiness and I believe my friend got Wisdom. Boy one was enough to get me feeling it! The flavors were subtle and sweet--so good!\n\nThey didn't have the Cheong Fun with Sea Urchin so I was heartbroken :(. \n\n1. Prawn Toast - We started off with the Prawn Toast. This was AMAZING to start with. The texture was amazing and the prawn inside just takes you by surprise. The sesame on the outside was awesome and then your tongue is left with a subtle saltiness that wasn't overbearing. \n\n2. Pickles - included a large variety and even though I'm not a fan of pickles, we cleaned this dish right up!\n\n3. Chilled Beef Tendon - was another thing that I would NEVER order, but the chilled beef tendon sounded pretty gnarly so we gave it a go. They said something about it being braised for 48 hours and you could really taste the deep flavors. It was such a cool take on tendon and I ate all of it! I don't even like tendon!!!!!!!! Picture has been uploaded. \n\n4. Dry Aged Beef Tartare - was OK. Now I love tartare, but had a feel this wasn't a place to get it at. Also, there were no pictures of the tartare so check my photos for that. This dish was decent, but forgetful compared to the rest. The flavors were not as strong or complimentary, but the beef was of great quality.\n\n5. Dutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns - gifted from the Chef and we loved these. They tasted like chocolate chip eggo waffles with bbq pork inside! Sweet but definitely salty and savory. Awesome combo!!!! Great crunch/crisp to them too.\n\n6. Mapo tofu - this was FLIPPEN RIDIC. Such great flavors with a good kick to it. Lots of chili oil so stay away if you can't hang. Now, I usually complain about salty foods, but I was NOT complaining about this one! Get it with a side of rice cause dis stuff is SAUCEY. \n\n7. Smoked Hodo Tofu - this, unfortunately, was the loser of the night for us. It was the one dish that my buddy and I honestly just could not eat. We picked at the the tofu and eggplant, both of which we were not into. This ended up being packed up and taken home for my roomies. In comparison to everything else, this one just had to lose. They couldn't ALL be winners! (???right?????)\n\n8. Steak Fried Rice - this dish was yummy and a good rice dish if you don't want to stick to plain white rice. However, I wouldn't order this again. It was delicious--don't get me wrong, I just feel like I would be happier getting something else off that menu. Maybe I will try the noodles next time!\n\n9. Tea Smoked Liberty Farm Duck - AMAZING! FREAKING AMAZING DUCK. Best duck I've ever had. However, I was PISSED that it came out last because I was so darn full by then!!! LOL. Mind you everything listed here was shared between two people!! This definitely was the most delicious duck I've ever had since I've gotten back from Paris. The next time I come back, I'm going to request I get the duck first!!!\n\n10. Black Sesame Cake - Too much ginger :(. Not sweet subtle ginger either but a PUNCH YOU IN DA FACE ginger. \n\nOverall a great experience and I would love to come back and have my duck first!

I wandered in here on a whim, and dined solo, so I just had a cocktail and two appetisers. The turnip cake was delicious, with some extra umami favour added in there, with the addition of mushrooms or truffles that were on there. I also had the pork buns..which I wasn't a huge fan of, to be honest. I was not digging the sweetness that was mixed with herbs in the pastry for some reason. The party next to me ordered a whole bunch of different dishes, and let me sample their food-which was fun! I tried the duck, that came with a bit of foi gras and duck liver, and instantly fell in love with the deliciousness that was the fatty crisp and flavourful skin. It was fancy-assed duck, and I'm glad I got to try it. It was my fav dish, and I didn't even order it- awesome!\n\nThe food was delicious, and the atmosphere is definitely upscale. Lots of moneyed tech-bro dudes with stuff to prove and attitudes to match were dining here, and for some reason, the sheer number of them was unsettling. I should be used to it, but still....

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-10", "description": "Mister Jiu's is an upscale and modern Chinese restaurant located in the heart of SF's Chinatown serving gourmet Chinese food family style. \n\nI came with high expectations since I'd been hearing chatter from all around the foodie community ever since they opened their doors. The ambiance and crowd is definitely more posh and classy than you would find anywhere else in Chinatown but it is to be expected with the $$$$ price tag. They only offer a 5-course banquet style menu with the option of adding supplements at an additional cost. \n\nTurnip Cake - The texture is on par with the standard turnip cake you would find at the to-go dim sum joint down the street. However, it comes with a smoky charred (borderline burnt) flavor that can be a bit overwhelming. The flavor otherwise was quite bland and unoriginal. Each person is served 2 pieces of turnip cake which is far more generous than we were expecting. \n\nUni Noodle Rice Roll (Cheong Fun) - Bland. This dish needed more flavor and more substance. Each roll only came with 2 tiny pieces of uni and needed a heavy pour of sauce on the side in addition to what was provided.\n\nLion's Head Meatball - The meatball was tender and moist but had a slightly gamey flavor. Nothing special here. Pass on this dish. \n\nFried Rice - I tend to shy away from ordering fried rice at Chinese restaurants but the group unanimously agreed this was the best dish of the night. There were large chunks of scrambled egg and strip steak mixed into the rice which definitely made you feel like you were getting some value out of your dollar. The cured tuna heart shavings added very subtle flavor but would not have been missed. \n\nHalibut - The fish was served as a filet rather than a whole fish like you would typically find. The filet was flaky and tender with a hint of ginger and scallions. My only complaint was the thickness of the filet which muted the flavor. This was probably my second favorite dish from the five we selected. \n\nAt ~$100/pp after tax and tip, this was a very pricey and highly mediocre meal. Not sure if I would be back unless someone else was footing the bill.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

The decor is tastefully done, and you can tell that a lot of time and effort went into the planning and remodeling of the space. The bar area has its own atmosphere (and menu) from the dining area - it's far more dark and lounge-inspired than the bright, airy space in the back. All of the details are beautiful, from the light fixtures to the art on the walls. The staff is attentive and friendly; we felt well taken care of from start to finish. I came in a group of four on a Friday night and we never felt rushed or ignored. We each started with a cocktail. I tried the Wisdom, and thought the flavors were super well-balanced. Luckily everyone in the group ordered something different so I was able to try three other drinks. I also really enjoyed the Tranquility. \n\nAt first glance, we were learning towards \"safer\" items on the menu, but thankfully our server encouraged us to get adventurous with our choices. We opted for the five course option, which was $69 per person. Given how incredibly delicious the food was, and the portion sizes, I thought the price per person was very reasonable. I happen to love eating family/banquet style, so I was excited to be able to share all of the dishes with my friends. We ordered the following items:\n- Chilled Beef Tendons: Don't let the tendon thing scare you; they taste like calamari and the dish was DELICIOUS. The celery, pepper, tendon mix was crisp and refreshing. \n- Dungeness Crab Custard: By far the most interesting and tasty item that we ordered. There was a large portion of crab, and the custard itself was a great silky texture. \n- Cheong Fun: I was hesitant about ordering the noodle roll because of the caviar and roe, but the dish wasn't fishy at all and actually pretty light. \n- Fried Rice: Fun fact about me, I loveeee rice. I fought pretty hard about ordering the rice even though people wanted to go for something more interesting. To everyone's surprise, the fried rice was packed with flavor. \n- Roasted Quail: This dish was unbelievably delicious. The quail was perfectly cooked and the sticky rice just really brought all of the flavors together. \n- We opted for an additional shrimp dish, but everyone felt like it lacked flavor. \n\nWe left the restaurant full, happy, and excited to eat there again. It was truly a dining experience like I've never had before, especially in terms of the cuisine. I would recommend Mister Jiu's to anyone and everyone, and would encourage going in a group, as the banquet style is great for bigger groups.", "author": "Regina L."}

I was surprised to see how large and pretty the restaurant actually was inside - it's impossible to tell from the alleyway door. The waiting area around the hostess table was a little small and awkwardly shaped, though. We felt like we needed to hug the wall to stay out of the way while we waited for our table. Our server was competent, but not especially friendly. He recommended that we order, I believe it was 6-7 savoury dishes. I find a typical restaurant meal to be much too much food for me, so we ordered 5 dishes to start, and our server looked a little dismayed. We ended up ordering an extra dish in the end for the sake of trying it, but it was NOT necessary in terms of quantity of food. Five dishes was plenty. One of those five dishes was the steak fried rice, and it was a  surprisingly large portion, so maybe that's why we filled up so easily. It was a safe choice, but no regrets because we loved it. It was a highlight of the meal, along the Dutch crunch pork buns - what a cute idea, and so well done. We ordered the potstickers and they were good but not very interesting. We ordered the black cod dish from among the pricier protein section, and it was really good, but it was also a really small portion. I was a little puzzled by the inconsistent serving sizes. I was excited to see what a Michelin starred restaurant would do with a tofu dish, but we both disliked the one that we ordered. The details are fuzzy, but I think texture was one of my issues. For dessert I ordered a cake paired with pear, I believe, and I enjoyed it immensely. Two more things worth mentioning: 1. the cocktail with the sesame oil is crazy good. 2. We were sat at a high table next to a wall, and there is something about the way that the chairs fit into the table (they take up almost the entire width?) that was awkward and a little uncomfortable, especially for my tall husband. I would request not to be sat there if we returned. On balance, it was a good, interesting meal.", "author": "Kayla M."}

A friend of mine knows Mr. Jew, so more reason to go I guess. I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, I am not a total fan yet from my first dining experience here. \n\nWe arrived at 5:50pm for our 6:00pm dinner reservation and we politely asked to wait at the bar. Husband got a drink and we were just chillin. We noticed that the party that arrived before us were getting drinks at the bar as well. Then several parties arrived after us...they were seated. Later we saw the group before us was seated, then a few more groups arrive and got seated. It was 6:15pm and we weren't starving, but I was sure we were forgotten. Husband went up to the hostess and she was very apologetic. We got seated at 6:20pm. The restaurant was actually half empty inside, we think Bc they didn't have enough staff.\n\n**FOOD- 'banquet style' where you choose five courses to share for $69, beverage pairing +$45.\n*Marin miyagi oyster egg custard: duck egg, lap cheong (Chinese sausage), green onion, favas- first impression was that wow salty! Then when I paid closer attention, the dish is quite interesting, tasted like Chinese roast duck flavor actually.\n*baby Bok choy with housemade scallop/prosciutto xo sauce- totally disappointed with this. The xo sauce wasn't xo sauce-like or had much depth in flavors and the Bok choy though baby in size was very stringy, hard, and seemed 'old'.\n*cold noodles: Dungeness crab, beef tendons, peanut, sesame, chrysanthemum- like Dan Dan noodles but lacking a bit of spice and the peanut overpowered the crab. \n*Salt baked McFarland springs trout: +$35, with trout roe, charred scallion, mortared ginger, serves 2-3 people- favorite item of the night for sure. Had McFarland trout before and it was great, this was also very good, cooked perfectly, I also really liked the scallion/ginger sauce with this... I ate so much of this with the fish and the rice! \n*black sesame cake: rosebud moose, strawberry confit, ginger- popular dessert here, but I thought it was alright... Liked the strawberry confit but thought the sesame flavor could be stronger.\n*frozen soy milk: soy granite, rhubarb, caramelized puff pastry- most interesting dish of the night, reminds me of the Chinese dessert 'tofu fa'.\n\nSERVICE/STAFF\nPretty good service throughout the meal, though pace was slow. We waited quite a while for our trout and I saw other diners waiting for their entrees as well. A couple waitstaff came by to apologize for the 30 min wait prior to our meal and gave us a free dessert (frozen soy milk dessert) to make up for it; it turned out to be the better dessert that we had. So I am not deducting any points for that.\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR\nCool and modern. Space is open and I like their lotus flower chandeliers! Very pretty!! The bar area behind the check-in counter is a bit dark, but comfortable. Love their tables and chairs.\n\nOverall, the meal was good, but not as good as I expected...

While the food was generally good or decent I was not led to believe that it was any better than a hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant, nor did I feel that the quality and taste of the plates summed up to warrant the extra cost of being \"gourmet\" Chinese.\n\nFor our table, we settled on the fried rice, roasted quail, uni cheong fun, and dungeness crab custard. Each of us got 3 different desserts: black sesame cake, frozen soy milk, and chocolate.\n\nStarting with the teaser plates, the first sign of disaster were the shrimp chips - stale. The dungenss crab dish reminded me of Japanese chawanmushi and while this was good, it wasn't spectacular. The fried rice was a majority favorite, but I thought it was too salty and not really something I wouldn't be able to find elsewhere. The bright side of this fried rice was that it was plenty loaded with meat. The uni cheong fun was lacking any sort of uni flavor. I loveeeee uni, so this was a major disappointment. The standout dish was the quail which I thought they cooked very nicely. The stuffings were somewhat under-flavored, but that was welcomed after the over-salted fried rice.\n\nOn desserts: the chocolate dish was amazing. I think of all the dishes I tried that night, this one was the absolute best. The other two desserts I could have done without, and the frozen soy milk was just plain weird. I don't think anyone at our table liked it... and we're all Asian.\n\nI had to ask twice for hot sauce at some point throughout the meal. (BTW, their hot sauce is HOT! It wasn't my favorite; I might have preferred something I'd get at my local dim sum joint instead.) I'm not sure if asking for hot sauce was a faux pas, but for a nicer restaurant you'd think you wouldn't have to ask twice? But I guess in my experience Asian restaurants can't ever be known for stellar service...\n\nOverall, I think my friends and I enjoyed the meal, but were pretty underwhelmed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-11", "description": "This is a one-of-a-kind New Chinese restaurant in SF that's done right. I'm all for traditional Chinese food, and when there's a spin to it, I do get a little skeptical. But this one's a showstopper. The menu is entirely thought out, and a lot of their ingredients from the lap cheong (Chinese sausage) to the hoisin sauce is made in house. l love the concept of a banquet style menu because it makes me feel like I'm eating with family and brings communion regardless of who you're dining with. \n\n Drinks - Drinks are on point! We had \"Wisdom\" and \"Wealth\"; both drinks were delicious. \"Wealth\" had a smooth smokey finish to the scotch, infused from the lapsang tea. \"Wisdom\" was refreshing with use of all the right flavors from the passion fruit and lemongrass.\n\nCrispy Daikon Cake - It's hard to perfect this dim sum dish, but it had been done.  Usually restaurants skimp out on the daikon and put starchy fillers in place.  These cakes were filled with huge chunks of daikon, fried, and slightly drizzled with a shiitake mushrooms sauce, finished with fresh radishes. One of the best daikon cakes I've had in SF.\n\nSizzling Rice Soup - the BROTH was amazing.  I could probably drink an entire vat of this. This is a chicken consomme, with enough crunch from the water chestnuts, asparagus (which I thought would be a little weird, since I haven't seen this veggie in any traditional Chinese soups, but complimented really well), green garlic drizzled oil, and of course sizzling rice. I would say this is one of my favorite dishes. \n\nDungeness Crab Custard - The unique creativity of this dish attracted my attention.  This dish was made from the brains/guts of the crab, which I usually don't eat because it tastes weird and very fatty.  The texture of the custard was very light (like chawanmushi) but you can definitely feel the fat from the brains fill your appetite. The citrus juice didn't really cut the fat - what I really wanted was a bowl of rice to eat this with. There was a generous portion of crab meat that sat on top of the custard. I like the concept, of this dish, but it was a tad too heavy for my appetite.\n\nGlass Noodles - The majority of my table's favorite dish of the night. The glass noodles aren't your traditional thin translucent noodles.  These noodles were thick and chewy, tossed with sesame oil, peanut, and beef tendon.  This dish was a hit at the table.  This dish reminded me of a take on Szechuan flavors without that pepper corn linger that numbs your lips at the end. \n\nSteamed Alaskan Halibut - This is a classic dish, taken up a notch. It was very clean and the cut of the halibut was favorable. Nicely flavored with the shiitake broth and smoked oyster sauce.\n\nRoasted Quail - Who doesn't like a bird stuffed with homemade lap cheong and sticky rice! Beautiful dish, executed so well. The combination of the flavors from each component worked in sync with each other. Another favorite dish of the night and a must try!\n\nLion's Head - I underestimated this dish, until it rested in my mouth. This is my number one dish of the night! Moist pork meatball, sitting in a broth with fermented mustard greens.  Every component of his dish was rich in flavor and combined together - gastronomical. This is a MUST try.\n\nTea-Smoked Liberty Farm Duck - This was kind of a French take on \"Peking Duck\".  Delicious duck breast and confit leg.  This protein was accompanied with a scallion style pancake and hoisin sauce.  The concept of eating duck with the scallion style pancake was different and interesting.  The pancake kind of reminded me of a tortilla, and I was hoping for it to compliment the duck a little more.  Hoisin sauce was delicious and the duck was seasoned and cooked really well.\n\nChocolate Dessert - This beautifully plated dessert came with a candle for our friend's birthday.  The pastry chef's here really know what they're doing. I couldn't get enough of the chocolate caramel with red bean, and I wish there was more. The flavors didn't seem complex from the menu, but the finished plate left me wanting more.\n\nYes, the price is steep for Chinese food, but the creativity and craftsmanship in each dish was worth it. The combination of new and traditional Chinese concepts really came together and opened my eyes to this modern movement in Chinese cuisine.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

We were very excited and our server only fueled that excitement with her excellent recommendations and overall enthusiasm. \n\nSadly, from the very first bite, the food experience was disappointing. The turnip cakes had great texture but were overly salty and bland on the inside (Out the Door makes an excellent version that I would take over this any day). The Caviar Cheong Fun noodle dish was also flavorless; the promised dried shrimp was nowhere to be found, and the caviar was too mild to make much of a difference. I will say that the noodle itself was delicious and fresh. but the dish was not a success.

Softshells were delicate and fresh, made bold with a green Chile sauce. The egg drop was a bit of a twist for me and resembled a silkened corn chowder, but with whole corn for a nice contrast in texture. The fried rice, which I was least excited about, turned out to be amazing.

We were seated promptly and got a great seat right by the kitchen counter and I got a great view of most of the kitchen. I'd never been to the Four Seas restaurant which used to be here, but I definitely like the way Mister Jiu's looks! We had a few servers for the night but honestly the service here tonight was so on point, super friendly and down to earth. Definitely one for the books and probably amongst the top 5 on my list across all restaurants I've been to. \n\nYou can order 5 items for the banquet styled dinner (either 4 starters and an entree, or 3 starters, an entree and a dessert that each person can select).

Pig Head was was like a fattier (in a good way) prosciutto, the squid was fried PERFECTLY (light in batter, not too salty and the kumquat and fennel just balanced the tastes perfectly), cold noodles were tasty (however, I had 3 pieces of crab shell, which wasn't a huge deal breaker, but for what we were paying, I guess it would've been preferred to not have any), tea-smoked duck done in 3 ways (confit, slices of tea-smoked duck and duck pate) was tasty but the pancakes were homemade and I loved them! \n\nFor dessert, I will give one constructive feedback that I think would make the Gold Mountain taste that much better. I'd really like to see a thin slice or two of a candied citrus (maybe orange) which would give the dessert some color, add a different texture to the dish and pair really well with the walnut meringue. I really commend the innovation on this dessert! I loved the black sesame cake dessert. The bit under the bottom of the cake tasted exactly like those Glico Milky Flavored Pocky sticks with the texture of those Astronaut freeze-dried ice cream things kids can find at science museums.

The trendy mid-century modern decor made you feel like you had entered a time capsule into your Cantonese grandma's kitchen.\n\nOriginally planning to do the 3-course menu, we quickly switched to the larger 5-course meal once we debated the menu and couldn't settle on just three dishes to try. The larger meal definitely left us feeling full (we ended up bringing some home), but I don't know if the 3-course meal would have filled us up.\n\nWe got the:\n1) Turnip cake - my favorite dish, and I'm not usually an olive person! Crispy yet dense, these were little bites of savory goodness.\n2) Lion's head - essentially beef meatballs with pickled veggies. These were good, but a little on the salty side. You definitely need the rice they come with to counter balance. I probably wouldn't order these again.\n3) Fried rice - I mean, fried rice is usually a win in my book and this was no different.\n4) Quail - my husband's favorite dish. Cooked really tender and stuffed with moist sticky rice and lap cheong! I was full by the time this came out, but my hubby happily devoured my half.\n5) Black sesame dessert - it's as good as the other reviews say! Subtle flavor for though who like their sweets not-too-sweet.\n\nOverall a great experience and will definitely be back!", "author": "Vi N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-11", "description": "Perhaps the bathroom tiles inside Mister Jiu's reveal more than words ever could. The restaurant stands out like the squashed blue hexagons that line the dimly lit bathroom walls they adorn. \n\nIf I could use one word to describe the restaurant, it would be conscious. Every thing about the restaurant seems to be aware of itself and its context, that's what makes it such a compelling experience. It's like a person who's confident in their own shoes. \n\nLet me start of by saying that this staff may have been some of the most accommodating that I've ever encountered. I went with my family, and we live about an hour out and over the Bay Bridge. We hit Friday traffic, so we were incredibly late--50 minutes late to be exact. We called, and the ma\u00eetre-d was incredible friendly, saying that we could show up when we can and they will figure it out.\n\nWhen we arrived, one of the beautiful hostesses chatted us up, inquiring about the occasion and my impending trip to Italy. It was not forced, but instead truly curious. The same kind of service was mirrored throughout the dinner: new napkins, no rushing, and constantly full waters and teas. The most surprising thing though is that unlike a lot of restaurants, each of the staff maintained their own personality. The constraints of the restaurant did not homogenize them; instead, it enabled their personalities to peek out, which made the entire experience feel very human.\n\nThat's not the only thing about the staff though. It seems as if the owners went deliberately out of their way to employ an almost completely Caucasian staff. I saw only 2 asian staff: a far cry from the other restaurants in china town (and asian restaurants in general).\n\nThe restaurant is nestled inside Waverly, an unassuming alleyway with chinatown signs that could be 80 years old. This is in bold contrast to the modern monotone fa\u00e7ade of Mister Jiu's that's looks as if its a contemporary rendition of a dada movie theatre. A large white 28 marks the front of the restaurant. \n\nThere's a strong use of modern type faces--Avenir, I see you-- and a positively trendy color scheme. I swear, the turquoise is right off the wall of that coffee shop that just opened in SOHO. \n\nIf I fell asleep and woke up in this restaurant, I'd assume i'd been magically transported to Portland. This was only confirmed by the unreasonable number of non-intimidating arm tattoos, thick frame glasses, and the overall easy going vibe. \n\nOkay, finally, we get to the food. At first, the menu is a little confusing -- albeit totally original. It's a set price, and you as a table, pick 5 dishes that are scaled up to the size of your party. You can pick from any of the categories. You can also order \"supplements,\" which are tacked onto the bill at the end, or extra dishes at \u00e0 la carte prices. \n\nI think this cuisine is most accurately identified as \"Modern Chinese,\" not \"Chinese\" as yelp suggests. If you came here expecting traditional Chinese food, you'd leave incredibly disappointed. In general however, the food is not this restaurant's strongest point. Although they're doing some very exciting things with lots of concept and experimentation, I'd say that the modernity in most cases is at a lack for really delicious and satisfying food. The halibut's sauce wasn't quite strong enough. The bok choy was a little too salty, intense. et cetera.\n\nIMHO, if you're going to try to change a traditional cuisine, it should be better that the original. In this case, it's not, though I think if the kitchen continues to push forward and improve the execution of their beautiful creations, they could get there. I'm really excited to see where this restaurant goes. It's still early for Mister Jiu's.", "author": "Aaron Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-10", "description": "During the years I volunteered as an extra for Chinese operas, I had dined many times at Four Seasons after the productions. I'm glad to see that Mister Jiu's erased all traces of Four Seasons and turned the location into a stunning space. Since my aunt was visiting from Hong Kong during the holidays, I made sure to grab a reservation quickly for us to check them out. Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with both the service and the food. \n\nHere's why:\n\nUpon checking in, our icy host told my mom and boyfriend that he couldn't locate our reservation. *cue awkward standoff* I was certain that I had made a reservation since I literally had to set 3 alarm reminders for myself. Luckily, the reservation was eventually found.\n\nThen came the annoyed hostESS who made us feel like such an inconvenience to her since we were a whopping 15 minutes early. I tried making eye contact with her to let her know that we'd wait outside, but she snapped without letting me speak to tell me that we had 5 more minutes till our reservation time. We were finally summoned and brought to our table about 5 minutes after reserved time. Not exactly the first impression I was expecting at all.\n\nLuckily, our server was much more of a sweetheart. She was helpful and attentive even though she did forget about one of our dishes. \n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n- Crispy Scarlet Turnip Cakes - meh. It's a little greasy and not too flavorful. Call me traditional, but I like my turnip cakes packed with goodies like Chinese sausage, dried shrimp, scallions, etc. \n- Cheong Fun (rice rolls) with Dungeoness Crab - Hands down, the best of the night. The rice rolls were silky smooth and filled with crab meat. This dish kicked so much butt that it almost makes up for mediocrity of the rest of the meal. \n- Potstickers - These were interesting. It was so brown that it looked like they were burnt, but didn't taste burnt. I wouldn't say that they're bad, but not really great either. \n- Steak Fried Rice - Second best of the night. The friend rice was flavorful and not salty at all. \n- Sizzled Black Cod - A little bland and the cod was not quite as soft as I've experienced before.\n- Tea Smoked Liberty Farm Duck - This is probably the biggest deal breaker of the night. This is absolutely not Chinese smoked tea duck that I'm used to. It was chewy, gamey and salty. \n\nWe also ordered a veggie dish that's a bit forgettable. To top things off, our cheong fun dish (and their saving grace) was forgotten and only came out when we had to ask our server. It could be that I came with high expectations or that I'm not part of their intended audience. Either way, Mister Jiu's fell short in my opinion and it almost made me wish Four Seasons was still around.", "author": "Tiffany U."}

I really enjoyed the overall experience but I would have liked a little more server attention. It was hard to get the server to come to our table, not because he didn't care but because it seemed like they were really short staffed and he was running from one table to another constantly.\n\nNow about the food: 4 stars: Turnip cakes are excellent. Well fried and flavored. The dutch oven bread with pork was really great too. The crudo was a disappointment as were the chicken wings. The wings were crispy but I would have liked more flavor. It was almost great but not quite.\n\nThe fried rice was good and the Hot n Sour soup we had was also really good, albeit a little pricy for what it is. Mooshoo mushroom was insanely good - simple and flavorful.\n\nI highly recommend this place. The cocktails we had were excellent as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-15", "description": "What an amazing experience!!! \n\nThe ambiance of Mr. Jiu's was relaxing yet ever so slightly elegant.  The food was clean, pure, and light.  The service was subtle and unobtrusive. \n\nThe bar area is cool and the cocktail that I ordered (a negroni, of course) was done perfect.  The Dinning room was amazing.  When you look out the windows you really feel like you are still part of the hustle and bustle of Chinatown but secluded in a safe space (kinda like a VIP section of Chinatown).  The mid-century style chairs and tables were comfortable and continue the minimalistic flavor and flow.  \n\nFor the amuse-bouche Chef Jiu sent out a tea smoked quail egg with aspic.  The smoked quail egg had an incredible deep and complex flavor. The whole dish was Amazing!  \n\nFor my first course I had the pigs head - This dish seemed like a twist on the Headcheese.   The dish was sprinkled w/ what I remember was called something like \"7 spices\".  Whatever those spices were, it complimented this dish amazingly.  I couldn't have been happier with this one! A must have for anyone who enjoys charcuterie.\n\nMy second course was the Crackling Rice Soup - This soup, was super clean.  The idea is that the crispy rice would get served with the soup and then dropped in when set on the table and the rice would crackle.  It was fantastically prepared and was perfect for stimulating the appetite.\n\nThe third course was the Cold Noodles dish - Two words, F-ING NUTS.  This was so good.  The sauce was creamy and the noodles were the perfect texture. The dish had an extremely complex and deep flavor. I have no idea what ingredients were used but they were pure and clean. \n\nFor the Fourth Course I had the Roasted Duck - By this point I was getting pretty but the duck couldn't have been cooked more perfectly and the intense Tea flavor was great.  I believe they did it two ways, one style for the breast and one style of the leg and thigh, with the breast being med-rare and the leg and thigh being fall off the bone.  It was served with a duck liver pate (AMAZING).  The pate was prepared with a hoisin sauce and that added a previously never tasted combination, I was floored.   \n\nMy desert was what I think was called Gold Mountain (apparently this is what San Francisco was nick named during the gold rush)  - At first, I was a little surprised at the flavor; by the end I was in love.  When this was served I was stuffed but the flavors were mild and not sweet.  \n\nI couldn't have been happier with the service, food and ambiance during the first week of opening this ground breaking Chinese restaurant.", "author": "Chad P."}

Many people were dining at the bar so the hostess made room behind her so I could put a drink order in. Ordered two drinks and before the bartender started to make the drinks he asked me if I wanted to keep the tab open or close out. I said I wanted to close out so he rung up the check and handed me the bill....before he even started to make the drinks. I kind of stared at it and he asked me if there was a problem. I said that I usually get the drink before I've served with the bill. This just totally caught me off guard. I think I had the \"Luck\" cocktail that wasn't super sugary like some cocktails with lychee can be and the tequila was smooth.  \n\nMy group of five ordered the Moo Shu Mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, steak fried rice, duck and trout.

When we sat, our server was incredibly helpful - we let her order everything for us and she nailed it. We had an excellent and massive selection of menu items and each one was remarkable. Everything felt like an expert interpretation on traditional Chinese dishes. The fried pork buns, dumplings, trout, and duck were standouts. I  highly recommend visiting this place when in SF.

I met up with my BF there last night for dinner.  I was driving in from work and had trouble finding parking so was 10 minutes late.  When I walked into the restaurant, I remarked to the hostess that I wish they had valet parking and she curtly with an accusatory tone told me \"that's why people take Uber here.\" Seriously!  She is criticizing me at the entrance of the restaurant, the paying customer?! Such rude customer service! Why not empathize and say something pleasant instead.  Don't you think I know Uber would have been better!  \n\nThe food was ok.  Quality ingredients but no unique items on the menu and no unique flavors.  We had steak fried rice which was very salty but just like another other fried rice.  Brussel sprouts with peanuts which also was very salty.  The orange chicken wings were crispy but flavor was not good, actually strange tasting (and not a sophisticated strange).  Orange chicken at any other normal Chinese restaurant in chinatown would have been better.  The dutch crunch BBQ pork buns were the most unique thing but the filling was very dry and again the BBQ meat would have been moister and more flavorful at any other Chinatown restaurant.  Chilled beef tendon had no flavor. Char Sui BBQ was roasted very well and tasted good. But it had too much fat and again didn't stand out compared to any other restaurant. \n\nOverall, food taste was 4/10. Wait staff service 8/10. Hostess service 0/10.  This restaurant is NOT, I repeat adamantly NOT worth the extreme prices.  There is absolutely NO \"wow\" factor in this restaurant!\n\nIf you want a tasty, worthy Michelin star experience, I would recommend Plumed Horse in Saratoga.

I know a lot of people don't love here for various reasons (lacks authenticity, doesn't appropriate capture all of the same \"tastes\" as Grandma, it's expensive Chinese food, etc.) but to be honest, I really had a great time.  Coming here for dinner with four people is ideal since we were able to cover a good amount of the menu.  If we had a table of two, I probably wouldn't have been as complimentary.  In any case, we had some really awesome dishes, with the winners of the night being the quail, the fabulously dished soft shell crab, and the Devil's Gulch Pig Head.  Sure it's a pretty penny to eat here, but I definitely felt like the amount of food we got for the four of us was well portioned, and we also had space for dessert.  I would definitely like to come back and stretch the boundries with a table of 6 and see if we can cover more ground on their delicious looking menu.", "author": "Lisa I."}

This restaurateur successfully showed us that Chinese food can be fine and elegant (and most importantly not necessary to be low priced commodity). \nServices were 5 stars. Hostess and waitress were super friendly and courteous. \nFood was 4 stars I would say. (The sauce had been in the heavier side that overtaking the freshness of the meat/seafood flavor)\n\nMinus most stars for having a raw piece of chicken (ate it, and spit it out immediately).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-26", "description": "We decided a few weeks ago that with all the buzz about Mister Jiu's, we HAD to check it out.  We weren't able to make a reservation for a party of 4 so we showed up at 5:30PM (when they opened) in the hopes of getting a table.  We felt incredibly fortunate to be going TODAY, on the very day that the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Mister Jiu's had just been awarded a Michelin Star.  A Michelin Star!  As we were seated at the bar, we kind of shrugged and said to ourselves, \"It's ok, it will be fine at the bar rather than at a table, they got a Michelin Star -- it will be awesome.\"  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  When you sit and eat at the bar, you are treated like the ugly stepchildren.  The main mission for the people behind the bar is to make drinks, so serving food to the ugly stepchildren simply isn't a priority.  When it comes to ordering anything (yes, even including drinks -- because remember, we're the ugly stepchildren), you have to beg to get any attention.  This applies to ordering any food, getting empty water glasses filled, getting additional drinks, getting ANYthing, etc. -- it's as if the ugly stepchildren don't exist.  We figured, well, we'll get through this, because you know the food will be awesome, they just got a Michelin Star.  A Michelin Star!  Sadly, THE FOOD WAS HORRID.  We ordered lots and lots and lots of plates to share among the 4 of us, and every single piece of food had a very prevalent common thread:  salty (VERY VERY VERY salty), very very dry (REALLY REALLY DRY), and utterly flavorless (IN SPITE OF ALL THE SALT!).  EVERY SINGLE THING THAT WE ORDERED.  We kept thinking, well certainly this will get better, maybe it was just a misfire on THAT dish.  Nope.  Every single dish was ghastly, one after another.  You wonder, did the Michelin Star people sit at the bar?  Did they order the same food we ordered?  Because if they did, they certainly wouldn't have awarded a Michelin Star.  We spent $100 per person and came away hungry (the small plates were, well, really quite small).  We also came away with a really bad salty aftertaste that continues to annoyingly linger.  You can go to any Chinese restaurant in San Francisco and get delicious authentic Chinese food at a small fraction of the cost that we paid at Mister Jiu's.  At Mister Jiu's, what you get is dry, salty, flavorless crap.  I am shocked beyond words.  To the owners of the restaurant:  (1)  Since you've made a conscious decision to seat people at the bar, don't treat them as an afterthought.  Not at these prices.  (2)  The Michelin \"star-givers\" are very exacting people, so I have to believe that the food that they received was extraordinary.  The food that we had was anything but extraordinary -- it was salty, dry, and devoid of flavor.  I highly recommend you work on quality control.  We've been looking forward to going to Mister Jiu's for several weeks.  What a disappointment.", "author": "Thomas M."}

Knew getting a reservation was slim and didn't even know if we could get a table just for dessert. Upon arrival we were greeted by two friendly hostesses you of course said no tables were available but by all means we could sit anywhere at the bar. Bar is long and appealing with muted lighting and colors. Lucky for us, two seats were open and we grabbed them. My dining partner was still hungry and once he saw the menu had to order the beef tendon and pig head. It was very tasty. I had the Harmony cocktail and forgot which one he had. They were both very balanced drinks. I preferred my choice tho. Bartenders were very attentive but very busy so no chit chat. Then desserts came. Chocolate, frozen whipped honey and Hong Kong sugar puffs they were perfect!  The frozen whipped honey was so light and refreshing. TheChocolate was amazing.

However, what overshadows both of these elements is the price of this restaurant compared to the value you get.  Unfortunately, the model at Mister Jiu's is set on a price fix menu of 3-5 courses, plus add-ons for certain menu items such as the duck, shrimp or specials, leaving you in the range of $60-$125 per person for food alone. Tack on items such as dessert, drinks, taxes, etc. and you're easily in the realm of $150-$250/person.  I would normally consider this the price point for special occasion restaurants, which Mister Jiu's is not.  The vibe of the place is a little pretentious, the service is efficient yet not spectacular nor warm, and overall Mister Jiu's leaves you feeling like you somehow just paid for another overpriced dinner, no matter how good the food is. \n\nIf you're looking for something trendy, by all means go to Mister Jiu's.  If you're looking for something special, my advice is at this price you're better off going to a number of other restaurants in the city.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Art B."}

This is a high-end, farm-to-table, eat-it-and-mean-it kind of restaurant. You wouldn't think twice about plunking down $80 - $100 per person for multiple courses of flawless food and a cocktail or two at any of the trendy SF restaurants, so expect to do the same here. \n\nIt's a special place. \n\n(That said, you could settle in at the bar and try a dish or two, if that's what you're looking for.)\n\nI love the banquet/family style model, because it's fun to agree on your five dishes ($69 per person), and then share them all around -- the portions grow with the number of guests, and we had plenty of food for everyone (and I'm an eater). It's a convivial way to enjoy your dinner and each other's company, being served up course after course, drinking, laughing, and Snapchatting or Instagraming because the food is so damn photogenic. Expect to be there for awhile - relax, settle in, take a deep breath, and enjoy the easy pace. It's not a turn-and-burn situation.  \n\nEverything we tried was simple and elegant and delicious. The menu changes often enough that you're going to find something new to try every time, but the standouts for me were the sublime lobster custard with duck egg, and the \"tendrils, greens, and stems\" (with this marvelously pungent sauce that I'm still thinking about). I was ambivalent about ordering a fried rice dish, and I'm so happy I was out-voted; the fried rice with beef sirloin and cured tuna heart flakes had stunning, in-your-face, flavor.\n\nWe added in the tea-smoked duck, and holy crap, it was life-changing - perfectly rare duck breast + confit legs, a little jar of duck liver pat\u00e9, and scallion pancakes to wrap it all in with a bit o' peanut hoisin to drizzle over the top. \n\nWe tried several desserts, too. They were ridiculously rich and delicate and inventive.\n\nThe cocktails rock, the wine list is unique and extensive, the open kitchen and decor are gorgeous, and the staff seems to know how to make you feel like you're experiencing a dining occasion. \n\nYou're so lucky to have this gem of a place in your city.

I tried at least 6 or 7 different ones, one sip each, and they are sweet but light and often infused with interesting ingredients like jasmine tea.\n\nThe food is shared family style, which means that the five of us had to agree on which five dishes to get.  That's very difficult.  And the portions were often so large that we couldn't finish.  I really wished that we could order more varieties, considering there were so many interesting choices on the menu. \n\nFood itself was good, but not good enough that I'd think about it or crave it days/weeks after.  I took the beef stew home and it was still tender and flavorful after microwaved more than once.  My six year old son said it was the best beef he's had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-07", "description": "Would give it two, but I'm going to evaluate it for what it is as opposed to comparing it to something else.\n\nFirst off, it is Chinese inspired cuisine, and most definitely not Chinese food. They do have an interesting interpretation of the cuisine, revolving around food items you wouldn't usually see in typical American fare (duck, soft shell crab, tofu). From a business standpoint, it makes sense to separate yourself from both the fine Western cuisines and other great Chinese places. You get things like fried rice with bacon and the soft shell crab with garlic aioli - not typical Chinese fare.\n\nInteresting menu, but way too salty. I appreciate that you need salt to flavor it, but when the salt burns and parches you, that's a bit much. \n\nPrice wise, I don't think it's good value for money. You're stuck with the 3 dishes for $45 or 5 dishes for $69, with certain dishes a standalone cost. You could buy cheap vegetables or a quail, so it's hit and miss with what you get for what you pay. You can definitely get better food for that price, or the same for cheaper - Trestle and Gary Danko come to mind.\n\nMay go back for the bar, but most definitely not the food.", "author": "Peter T."}

It's set in a little alley in Chinatown, which adds to the charm of it all, given the significantly different Chinese restaurants immediately adjacent.\n\nService was both flawless and friendly, conducted by a hip, attractive, and stylish team who were refreshingly warm.  I have a broken leg, and Amanda, our server, really went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable.  At the end of the meal, Anna Chet Jew-Lee, the wife of the chef and the charge d'affaires of the front of the house, came over and truly engaged us.  She seems to take great pride in the quality of the experience she and her husband produce, and when we told her how much we enjoyed our meal, she positively beamed!\n\nNow for the food...\n\nThe format is simple.  3 or 5 course meal that you mix and match, served family style.  We started with the soft shell crabs.  These were probably the best soft shell crabs I have ever had.  They were cooked with such a light touch!  Upon finishing them, we immediately ordered a second round as a supplement.  Next came hand-cut noodles, pork and squid ink won tons, and a flawless roast duck, served in the traditional style (pancakes, hoisin, etc.) but with the addition of a pate of the duck's foie which really popped the dish!\n\nWe were so impressed with the meal, that when it came time for desert, we ordered all of it.

Just FYI the first time I went, they had a different menu - you pay 50-69/person depending on how many dishes you want. I think we paid 60 for 6 dishes shared with my bf. You were able to choose between appetizers, meats, rice/noodles, desserts, basically any 6 dishes you wanted. However, they have recently transitioned to the standard pay-per-entree style you participate in for most restaurants.\n\nOverall, I really love this restaurant. If you come here expecting traditional Chinese food, you will be disappointed. If you come here wanting modern Chinese food, or Chinese fusion, you will be in heaven. Ambiance is very unique - the restaurant is in Chinatown, but they completely renovated the space of the restaurant, creating a modern and fresh take, yet also preserving some parts of the neighborhood or Chinese culture. For instance, for the larger group tables, they have the round-family tables with a lazy Susan but it's fancy and embedded into the table. The lighting is also dimly lit, and the lighting focuses on the outside street where businesses are blaring their bright lights.\n\nService was excellent. The first time we came, it felt like they were rushing our meal. However, the 2nd time we came here, it was paced perfectly. I will give them some slack since they were pretty new when we first dined here.\n\nFood - highlights below. The menu items also changed slightly from my 1st & 2nd time.\n-Cheong Fun w/ Caviar - WONDERFUL. The noodle was made perfect IMO. Usually cheong fun's can be overcooked and too soft. However, the one here was not overdone and thus slightly chewy in a good way. Loved the sauce it came with. Also loved the caviar....yum.\n-Dutch crunch BBQ pork buns - very good. Literally a combination of a typical brown BBQ bun, with a crispy dutch crunch top. Loved the flavor too - very sweet BBQ pork. Fun twist on dim sum. \n-Moo Shu Mushrooms - mushrooms that are crunchy, slimy, and flavorful with the jicama. You put them in the wrap, kind of like a taco. So good!\n-Tea Smoked Liberty Farm Duck. The duck was FANTASTIC. However, they took the Beijing duck interpretation, where you eat it with the wrap, hoisin sauce, onions, etc. When you mix the duck with all of these things, the excellent quality of the duck gets lost, unfortunately. I instead loved enjoying the duck (cooked medium rare) by itself. Yums.\n\nCocktails/drinks:\nThey have EXCELLENT cocktails here that should not be overlooked. I got the Happiness (gin, sour apple, gentian, jasmine tea, honey, lime) and my bf had something else and we were both pleasantly surprised. They're $13/each but crafted with high quality so you get exactly what you are paying for. \n\nDesserts:\nBlack Sesame Cake and Frozen Whipped Honey were great.

Our neighbors were shouting at each other - so we asked them to lower their voices and they continued their spirited ranting. We told our server, the owner and the receptionist about the noise level- over 80 decibels and aside from apologies they did nothing. We will not return.", "author": "Helen M."}

Prawn toast nice too, but the standout was the chow fun, really good taste with an unusual and definitely non-traditional blend of ingredients.\n\nIf the bar food is anything to go by, it seems that their approach is to have a sort of fusion-y take on Chinese food but done in a traditional/classic manner, at least, presentation-wise.

But, unfortunately we had a really bad dining experience.\n\nIn short, all of our food just tasted like we were eating pure salt. We both took one bite of our soup and couldn't eat anymore - and the duck was way too chewy with a grayish appearance. It felt like a factory with different waiters just throwing plates down to any table they thought needed the next course - it was unclear who was really taking care of us, and we finally just asked for the check so we could leave. \n\nThe price was not the issue - we knew how much it was going into it and as people who have made a hobby trying all the best restaurants in the city - we were so excited - but after the experience, we both felt like we had literally been robbed $350.

It is hard to eat when your dining partner has nothing for 10 minutes.  The waiter was either brand new or had never been adequately trained!  The food was the big disappointment though.  The portions were very small and bland-the crispy pork buns were not crisp and were very doughy.  My daughters comment about the potstickers was that Costco's are much better!!  That's sad.  I would never go back-it is smack in the middle of Chinatown and not one Chinese person was in the dining room so we should have taken that as a clue!!!

I'm used to waiting a bit past my reservation time - but we were waiting for almost 45 minutes after to be seated. Luckily our cocktails were just as excellent as I had been led to believe by my coworker. I particularly liked the bitter melon with gin in the Clarity cocktail off of their list. Their cocktail list is modern and adventurous-- and clearly inspired by Chinese and Japanese ingredients (I saw perilla and sesame as well... very interesting!) I do agree that more communication from the hostess would have been appropriate in a restaurant of this caliber. Luckily -once we were seated, our server Charlotte was both prompt and patient with our ordering. I can't begin to explain how wonderful it is to be able to enjoy Chinese food when you have celiac disease. I tend to assume I can only eat a seafood dish with some rice safely. We started with a few very fresh miyagi oysters. We moved on to their fantastic turnip dish (I will be coming back for this dish for sure!) and the crispiest (& gluten free!) chicken wings, thoughtfully seasoned. The dipping sauce served with the wings reminded me of Marmite (a good thing for me). The texture of the turnip cakes reminded me of housemade yellow soy tofu I've had at nicer Burmese restaurants. Firm, but creamy and as savory as can be. I would eat this dish again right now, the morning after! Next we had the silken tofu with morel mushroom. My husband found this dish to be bland. I love chawanmushi -- and appreciate the mildness and clarity of such a simple style \"custard\" dish. The Cheong Fun noodles were fantastic! Luxurious and so incredibly fresh. We both fought a bit over that dish. The crab was cooked perfectly and was genenous in proportion to the thick noodle. We finished with the sizzling halibut, my only disappointment of the evening. Unfortunately the fish was overcooked. Our server was so pleasant and accommodating (it was also getting to closing time at this point) I admit I simply did not want to complain. The broth was delicious. I think my only overall negative observation was that I would have liked more ginger and other aromatic accents to the dishes in general. One other item I noticed: the cocktails are so strongly imparted with flavor - the dishes can get lost in contrast. I switched to the Gamay by the glass with most of my meal. I generally prefer reds in the evening, and was pleased when it was as light and flexible with the variety of dishes we had in pairing as expected. We were disappointed to discover they were out of the dessert my husband wanted (it was his birthday) - but again, this gives us another reason to come back. The view, the decor, the atmosphere is so very warm and inviting, a pleasant contrast to the industrial elements of the bar.", "author": "Brigid S."}

We first started by ordering 2 glasses of wine before food. Then about 5 minutes later our food. Waited 15 min for our first course and our drinks still hadn't arrived yet. They came a few minutes later. Not the biggest deal. Onto the food: the pigs head was pretty good. Loved the texture. The salt n pepper calamari was a miss. Had more fennel and fried kumquats than actual squid, which was overly cooked and super chewy, not tender at all. And pretty salty so I refrained from using the dippin sauce so I wouldn't blow out my palate. Crispy daikon cakes were good. Little bit boring but simplicity is nice sometimes. The crab noodles were my favorite. Would have loved a tiny bit of lime or acid to round out the dish. The duck was also good. I'd give it a 7.5/10. But one breast and one leg for $40 is steep. Next, the dessert was $13 and was the tiniest thing I've ever seen. Four bites at most. $300 later (including tip) we felt a little upset. I liked the vibe of the place and the service was attentive but I couldn't help but feel like I just payed a good amount of money for some high end Chinese food.

While the amount of food was plentiful, I was underwhelmed by the quality. For the price we paid, I was expecting mind-blowingly delicious Chinese food. Instead, what I was served was above average, at best. Like many other yelp reviewers, I thought the cheong fun lacked flavor.

The cucumber was very crisp and the avocado puree at the bottom was so good! Do not get the truffle bao! This was the only dish the server did not recommend. You could barely taste the truffle and it was just bland. It was also very expensive $24 for 3 small baos! I repeat do not get the truffle baos! I got Wonton for the entree and it was delicious and spicy, so be warned! For dessert, I got the frozen whipped honey which is basically a froyo with pineapple chunks.

I paid $200 for having to cancel 47 hours before our reservation time. And to be clear - I cancelled & they send me a cancellation notice.  And they still charged me.  I would have given the dinner to 4 homeless people to enjoy if I knew I was paying for it anyway!   \n\nWhat Happened: I made a reservation online & had to cancel. Reservation was for 9 pm Friday, and so went I got home Wednesday night (the day I found out friends couldn't come) I went online to cancel & it would not let me (at 10:00 pm).  So the next day I called at lunchtime & left a VM about cancelling & asked them to call back.  I got an email saying it was cancelled, so I thought it was taken care of.  Then the next Monday I got the $200 charge on my card.  I called them & they said I had not cancelled in the 48 hour time.  I told then about the online not letting me & he said 47 hours is not 48 hours & there was nothing he could do but he would pass the message on & they would call back.  They never called.  I called them & left a VM, they never called.  \n  \nBased on this, I will never go in.  If they care this little about the Bay Area people, I can't imagine them really caring about the food.

They're located in SF Chinatown in a side street. Pay attention when you're finding the place because you'll miss it if you blink:P We came in a large party so we're seated in a large round table with a lazy susan in the middle of the restaurant. They encourage us to do family style, so we went with the 4 dish family style. While all of the food was pretty good, a few people in our party had dietary restriction so we couldn't order some of the dishes that I want to try. My favorite of the evening was the beef in claypot. Only complaint is that they definitely did not give us enough rice for 6 people. Each person got maybe 2 large spoonful of rice. Honestly, if you're going to serve this dish with rice, I think there should be at least a bowl of rice for each person. Otherwise let people order rice separately. They also don't have brown rice as an alternative so it's a bit unfortunate. Overall, it was a great experience, and the food was great. My fianc\u00e9 and I are already planning to come back, but probably just us two this time. Because they are family style, I would recommend anyone visiting to come with people with similar taste in food:)", "author": "Sharon L."}

It's what a Chinese chef would make if he was making fun of the American palate.  It's what a Chinese chef would serve Trump if he was trying to make a political statement.  It's what would happen if a Chinese chef was kidnapped by the Campbell's soup company and forced to make dishes that incorporated their products.\nDish A: Hot and Sour Soup:  No. Tomato soup with Mushrooms. And not done well (see: Campbell's Soup)\nDish B: Prawn Toast: No.its an warm ice cream sandwich filled with prawn flecks\nDish C: Turnip Toast.  Actually not bad.  They must have ordered takeout from New Asia and microwaved it.   Then tossed a random mushroom on top.  b/c that mushroom fools you into paying 6x the going rate.\nDish D: Pork Buns: Not pork buns.  Its a poopy seed bagel stuffed with pork.  Yes that spelling is correct\nDish E: Tomato Salad. Fine.  Didn't totally disgust.  The wife disagreed with me however\nDish F: Halibut.  Someone from Campbell's provided a concentrated sugar sauce that would win at a Kindergarten eating contest but is not totally at home on a $39 plate\nDish G: Peking Duck :  Shockingly flavorless.  And fatty.  And someone threw Campbell's peanut butter in the Hoisin sauce -- just cause.  In case you are wondering, Peanut butter and duck is not a thing you need to spend $200 to experience.\n\nOn the Plus side, the drinks are creative and fun looking.  The desserts are good too.  Not remotely Chinese but good.  Hopefully the pastry chef will realize she is 6 blocks south of North Beach and pick up shop and go find a cuisine suitable restaurant.", "author": "Brian S."}

When a chiropractor recommends me a place- I have to go. I mean who gives food suggestions while their cracking your back unless it's super good? \n\nHe described this place to me as a restaurant deep in the roots of Chinatown but where there were barely any Chinese diners and no Chinese waitstaff. That alone made me highly suspicious as I'm Asian myself and eat at Chinese places on the regular. You know what they say, if you don't feel verbally abused and have to question the health rating of a restaurant, the better the food- more authentic right?? \n\nI'm so glad this restaurant came to change that whole vibe. Great service and ambiance that found out how to modernize Chinese cuisine without losing its essence. Loved the quail stuffed with sticky rice and the duck. It was the most unique and a complete party in my mouth.

They were perhaps a tad greasy for the first thing to go in one's stomach all night but they were worth ordering. \n\nWe then had soups -- I had a custom prepared vegetarian soup (without the chicken consomm\u00e9) and yet it was also good.\n\nThe cold noodles (sans crab) were absolutely delightful. The peanut/sesame sauce was rich, fatty and flavorful.\n\nThe smoked hodo tofu was revelatory -- one of the better tofu dishes I have had in recent memory. Exceptional dish -- nicely spicy and the garlic chives also worked well.\n\nThe silken tofu main was totally different from the hodo tofu but still fantastic. It was the only thing I felt didn't necessarily fit cohesively with the rest of the meal. The notes were less bright, and the tofu felt delicate, and almost ashen in a way, whereas the rest of the meal was much more explosive flavorfully. It was a good dish (on its own) but with the other four items I had, I'm not sure it was the right fit.\n\nAlso - the wines are fantastic and more than fairly priced: I highly recommend the California wines (the Ghostwriter, the Renaissance (both the red with dinner, and the dessert wine, were fantastic) here, as they're good values and also pair exceptionally with the food.\n\nOverall, great space and atmosphere as well -- super friendly and accommodating service.

I'm usually very stingy with awarding 5 star reviews but for this place I thought it was the appropriate rating. \n\nThe service was excellent and attentive without being overbearing. We arrived around 9 with no reservation on a Saturday night and was seated immediately which is unheard of in SF. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and it looks like the restaurant has organized its staff so they assist each other to ensure a seamless experience.\n\nThe food...yes let's talk about that. \n\n1. Shrimp chips - great interpretation of the typical chips but with a perfect vinegar and salt pairing.\n2. Harmony cocktail - like its name the ingredients harmoniously complimented each other\n3. Chicken wonton soup - this was my least favorite. I get that the dishes are expected to be interpretations of traditional Chinese dishes but this probably went too out of the box. The wontons were fine but I think the broth and selection of veggies was the weakness in this dish. The bone broth was really dark n salty indicating and overuse of soy sauce. The veggies did not pair well in the broth. \n4. Rice rolls with uni - this was a huge success. The use of uni as the filling was a welcome change to the typical shrimp or beef fillings. The rice roll itself was super soft and delicate, texturally superior to what you find at typical dim sum\n5. Greens with uni sauce - the veggies themselves were seasoned and cooked similarly to what you would expect but the uni sauce added a different but complimentary flavor pairing. Dish was well executed but may not be as exciting as the other menu options. \n6. Tea duck - their interpretation of Peking duck. The duck, perfectly cooked and served with pancakes...finally a place that doesn't use those doughy buns! Also included pate and hoisin sauce w peanuts...does very well with the duck. This is an extremely successful dish and the only suggestion I would have to make it perfect is to make the skin on the duck crispy like in traditional Peking duck.\n7. Black sesame cake - when you have a great meal you want to cap it off with a great dessert. I'm very picking when it comes to desserts and I tend to shy away from super sweet desserts but this was perfectly executed and one of the best desserts I've ever had. The sesame cake was light, moist and mild. The persimmon sauce provided the perfect amount of sweetness. We paired this with a pot of table tea...it was just perfection. \n\nPricing is very reasonable and we walked away spending less than we expected for a meal n experience that far exceeded most of our more recent experiences.", "author": "Mai C."}

If you love authentic Asian food like me, you're probably the same way and this mindset prevents you from visiting Mister Jiu's. I'm writing this review in the hopes of convincing as many people to try out the restaurant, especially those Asian-food-purists out there.\n\nMost dishes were absolutely delicious - listed in order of deliciousness.\n\n1) Cheong Fun\nPerhaps their most iconic and delicious dish on the menu. The Chinese flavors are juxtaposed perfectly with Western influences - the caviar and salmon roe adding a whole new experience to your typical rice noodle roll. This is a must try.\n\n2) Salt & Pepper Soft Shell Crab \nThe simultaneously softest and crispiest soft shell crab I've ever had. Just an explosion of flavors. \n\n3) Roasted Quail\nCooked to perfection and extremely juicy.  An explosion of flavor follows each bite, and the savory stuffed rice perfectly balances out the sweetness of the quail. \n\n4) Chilled Beef Tendon\nA simple, well-cooked dish. More faithful to original Chinese style, which might be refreshing to some. Not one of their iconic dishes.\n\n5) Crispy Daikon Cake\nDelicious, but nothing novel. Doesn't taste or feel much different than the turnip cakes you'd find in a delicious hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant.\n\n6) Hot and Sour Soup\nInteresting take on a classic. Does not really taste like hot and sour soup, with a heavier emphasis on cilantro + soy sauce flavors compared to the traditional flavors. Fun if you're trying something new, but not life-changing.\n\n7) Smoked Hodo Tofu\nThis is the one dish I do NOT recommend. I don't think I quite understood concept behind this dish. I could tell the ingredients were fresh and well-cooked, but the sauce added little to no flavor. Very underwhelming dish.\n\nOverall great experience, wonderful service and food.

The concept is interesting; you don't expect a place this upscale in the middle of SF's Chinatown. \n\nVery cool restaurant; the long, thin, and dark bar area opens up into a much brighter dining room that has a lovely view of the city. The dining room is small enough to have the restaurant retain and intimate feel, however. As a party of six, we were seated at a large round table with a built-in lazy susan. The noise level was loud, but not so loud as to be uncomfortable; still, it was sometimes difficult to hear people on the other side of our circle.\n\nService was mixed. At the beginning of the meal, our server was downright chilly. She wanted to do business and nothing more. As the evening continued, however, she warmed up--not sure if it was that we were a nice table or simply that things got a bit quieter as the hour neared 10p and she de-stressed a bit. By the end of the meal, she was providing service more fitting of the price point.\n\nMenu was appealing--one page of snack-sized smaller plates, a middle page of noodles and noshes, and a last page of larger entrees. We ordered to the server's direction; it was probably one plate too many, as the portion sizes were generous.\n\nThe food was paced appropriately. At the end of the meal, we had that very happy conversation in which you cannot agree which dish was best because they were all so good! These are definitely modern interpretations of Chinese dishes, influenced by the best of California. We all enjoyed the scallion pancake, the wontons, the chicken wings, the friend turnip, and the pickles. The only thing that didn't stand up to others was the friend rice, but that was because the others were so good. The cocktail list, while small, focused on quality, and everyone loved their drinks.\n\nA really enjoyable evening--I anticipated it would be good, but I was very impressed by the quality of the cooking and the flavors. Would definitely recommend.", "author": "Craig P."}

The interior design style has a romantic old chinatown vibe with the city lights visible through the main dining room windows.\n\nThe menu and dishes were not your normal Americanized Chinese dishes.  I've had the Chef's food back at Bar Agricole where he was the chef before.  He brings a similar approach.  It's bold on the presentation and flavors, and augments classic chinese dishes with fresh, California farm ingredients.  The duck is pure dope.  The braised fish dishes are sublime.  The fried rice and vegetable-oriented dishes are perfect.  Definitely a modern and California cuisine take on Chinese food, but will still appeal to core Chinese food lovers.\n\nThe cocktails are unique, and go well with the cuisine here.  The gin, tequila and whiskey drinks pair well with the flavors of the meats and sauces.  The bar is a nice place for a quick bite and great cocktails. \n\nOverall, I'm really happy that there's a great place for dinner and cocktails in Chinatown.  I think this is the beginning of a good trend for SF Chinatown.", "author": "steve j."}

My husband and I had the most romantic date here and are already talking about when we can make it back in! We were early for our reservation and the hostess (super cordial and pro) suggested we have drinks at the bar. I'm always in for a good cocktail, and their bartender Danny Louie does not disappoint! We had Happiness and Wisdom, both delicious fresh and unique. I LOVED the Wisdom! Lemongrass milk, Martinique rhum, and passion fruit in a tall frosty Collins glass, yes please!!!\nWe also loved that they have big brain goldfish tanks at the bar! After our drinks the hostess brought us into the dining room. The sun was just starting to set and we sat under a beautiful brass sculpture. The dining room is totally stunning! I appreciated all the indoor plants. Our server, Charlotte, was super sweet and knowledgeable. She had an answer for every question! I especially loved the sizzling rice soup and sesame crab noodles! I want those noodles everyday! We had the black cod for our entree and it was exactly what I always want: simple, clean, and flavorful. I especially liked the julienned ginger. I could go on, I love this place and I'm excited to come back! Well done Mister Jiu's!!!!", "author": "Anna L."}

It's always a great story when somebody tried to recreate their childhood in their own ways. Chinese food was also one of the toughest cuisines to be modernized. What I'm used to might not be what you are used to. There is a thin line before you cross over to a new dish, and lost the original definition of that dish.\n\nThe four dishes that we ordered were:\n- Devil's Gulch Pig Head: It was delicious and flavorful. A bit heavy on the spices, but overall a good dish.\n- Sizzling Rice Soup: It was flavorful and fun.\n- Shangainese Rice Cakes: 4-6 pieces of rice cakes, soaked in sauces. This dish failed in my book. For the record, he didn't claim he is making a Shanghainese rice cake, he was making Shangainese (If his intention was to create a Shanghainese dish, please fix the dish, and the spelling error!)\n- Baby Bok Choy: XO sauce is supposed to be have that kick, but this homemade XO sauce was blend. \n- Heart Arrow Ranch BBQ Pork: There were so many wrongs with this dish, from the bbq pork to not so sweet and sour pork, and the bun.\n- White rice: was too dry and overcooked. How can you screw up steam rice?\n\nOur server gave us a complementary dessert because the pork came out late. They realized that they were not equipped for the crowds. For that I would give them a star. One more star is for the dessert, which was probably the highlight of the meal. One star for the effort.\n\nAll in all, I hope Mister Jiu keeps evolving, for better. Until then, I'll be satisfied with cheap Chinese food.", "author": "Victor S."}

The truffles were so overpowering, it ruined the dish.  I've eaten dishes with truffles at many Michelin star restaurants, and they are always added in moderation.  Furthermore, what kind of low quality truffles are they using if they can layer on SO MUCH yet not reflect it in their pricing?\n\nSecond: this is a nit, but their deep fried squid and frog legs are almost all batter and no frog leg meat.  Please buy other frogs because the dish was lacking.  No one wants to buy deep friend batter only\n\nThird: their frozen peach (or apricot, can't remember) dessert lacked flavor.  It looked cool, but it tasted like \"air\"....left us disappointed.\n\nThe good: best fried rice I've ever had, great meatballs, great crab soup.  I hope they fix the other issues in their menu. If they do, I would give this place 5 stars.  I really want to return here once they figure out their menu so I can enjoy all my courses, instead of sending some of them back.", "author": "Sajit J."}

It's a rare day that I have one cocktail, let alone two, but the Bar Director, Danny Louie, at Mister Jiu's, along with Chris and Ashley, who created this sophisticated but very comfortable and friendly bar atmosphere made me two delicious drinks named after the Chinese Fortune symbols.  This place is a feast for the senses.  Music, fragrant and delicious drinks and a beautiful, chic and cosmopolitan atmosphere in the middle of Grant Street in the heart of San Francisco's Chinatown.  Fragrant and delicious.  Seriously.  Take a moment to smell the fragrance before sampling the drinks' divine flavor profiles. My first drink, Destiny, tasted like vanilla but had a very unique finish with the dill that was very refreshing and smooth.   My second drink, Harmony, with green tea and ginger, was also fantastic and fragrant on my tongue..\nMy friend's first drink, Happiness, was packed with citrus punch flavor and freshness -- such a great pre-dinner choice.  And then I sampled her second drink, Wealth, which was amazing and reminiscent of a whiskey sour but with a smokiness that was delightful and wow, hints of caramel, oh so delicious.\n\nSo next time you feel like a fabulous night out, be sure to try this place.  Mister Jiu's has great food and a superb pastry chef, whose Black Sesame cake was amazing .  A wonderful place and romantic date location smack in the middle of Chinatown.", "author": "Karen A."}

The stars more reflect the food which require some extra tweaking and work but I must say that I was impressed by the service and ambience. \n\nLet's start with the good stuff. The service was great. But what my friends and I were raving about is the dining room! They converted a loft space into a nice ambience dining room that reminded me of a New York Soho loft with grand windows and views of the buildings behind the restaurant. \n\nThere were hits and misses with the food. We ordered the hot and sour soup, squid, cold noodles and bok choy for appetizers and the pork belly for the entree. The squid and bok choy were fantastic. The squid was extra crispy because they sliced it so thin and the bok choy flavor notes were elevated by the pork in it. The hot and sour soup was really sour but was best described by someone at our table (who is French): French attempt at hot and sour soup. I thought the cold noodles were not salty enough and lacked something - but the service provided me with hot oil which we added to enhance the flavor. The pork was ok but what the real travesty were the steam buns provided with it. They were dry and disintegrated like saw dust the second you try biting into it or breaking off a piece. We gave the feedback on the buns and the service were really receptive of it so we hope they get it right next time. \n\nI would want to come back when they change up the menu.", "author": "Kai C."}

The ingredients were top notch and the preparation and service extremely competent. All in all, and for the price, we expected more of a \"Wow.\" We had 1-1/2 memorable dishes out of 4. The custard, currently made with lobster, was spectacular. The other really good dish was the quail. Perfectly boned and prepared but not as original a flavor as the custard. They let the quail \"speak for itself.\" We also had noodles that were tasty but not so distinctive that they stood out in flavor from the best chow fun noodles you could get for a fraction of the price elsewhere in Chinatown. I think if you hadn't experienced a Chinese banquet before, you might find some revelation in the flavors here. But we didn't find much that was so outstanding in taste to justify the high price.\n\nA word about the \"banquet style\" service. You're given a choice of 3 or 5 dishes ($45 and $69 per person, respectively) and told they will be served banquet style. However, 2 of our 4 dishes were served at our small table at the same time. Also, the server made it clear that, not only could we order from the offered supplements, but they could also add just about any other dish off the menu for about $20 or so. That suggests to me that the prix fixe pricing is something of a gimmick; more like a cover charge to get in the door rather than a system required by the food preparation process.", "author": "Christopher W."}

I was impressed with the house-made plum sauce!  We all thought each dish was delicious and creative.  Couldn't finish everything and got to-go boxes!\n\nFor dessert, we chose the sweet rice cake (not our favorite, a little bland), black sesame cake (yummy dessert, voted our favorite) and chocolate cake (very good and crunchy- hard to explain).  The complimentary tiny almond cookie and chocolate truffle was a nice gesture.\n\nI would like to go back to try some of the other dishes.  It took approx. 3 hours to complete our meal.

All of them were incredibly delicious! Two of us don't like eggplant, but we both loved the flavor of the eggplant dish. One in our group doesn't like fish, but she ended up taking two servings of the trout. The presentation of this dish is exquisite, and the charred scallion sauce was so delicious! The roast duck is pricey, but there is a generous amount of meat. It was roasted to perfection, with an amazing blend of seasonings. The leg, especially, was so tasty! Everyone raved over the steak fried rice! We also loved the turnip cakes, smashed cucumber salad, potstickers (purple!), heirloom tomatoes, and summer squash. The sweet ending was the frozen honey dessert, which was almost too gorgeous to eat, and so delicious! All of us were in awe of the perfect blending of flavors, the freshness of each dish, the beautiful presentations, and the overall wonderful dining experience. Knowing that they make their own sauces, including the oyster sauce, peanut butter hoisin sauce, and XO sauce; shrimp chips, and lop cheung, added to the enjoyment of the dinner. This was by far the best Chinese dinner I've had, and I grew up eating delicious dinners cooked by my chef-like father and going to many Chinese banquets in Chinatown.

Seriously the only thing that could have made this meal better is if I hadn't waited so long to ask for the frozen honey dessert since by the time I went to do so I was too full to make it! Thing to note... this restaurant has four $ on it. Ok... for CHINESE food it is expensive. But they aren't selling Chinese food exactly. They are selling an elevated or updated and more refined experience.

Unfortunately, we found both the quail and the BBQ pork were lackluster.  The quail was gamey and overlooked; only the sticky rice stuffing saved the dish from being a complete fail. Don't bother with the very fatty BBQ pork (additional $35 to the $69 pp for the 5-course meal); my favorite part about the dish is being able to make a lettuce cup to lighten the very heavy entree.  \nAs for the ambience, I loved the three lotus flower chandeliers and the view out of the floor to ceiling windows overlooking Chinatown and The Financial District.  \nService was attentive and courteous.

Then the first course (Bok Choy with Pancetta and Green XO Sauce) comes out, and I ask the server, because I'm curious, \"What is in the green XO sauce?\" because I've only ever heard of red XO sauce. He answered, \"Oh, it's the pancetta.\" BUZZER-wrong answer, buddy. Next time, try \"I'm not sure, but let me find out from the kitchen.\" At this point, we still don't have our drinks. So, I try to get an employee's-ANY employee's attention, but they're all buzzing around without actually scanning the tables. Finally, a waiter exits the kitchen and stops by our table, his back to us. I politely tap him on the shoulder--and he walks away. WTF? Keep in mind that our food is on our table this whole time. Finally, I start waving my napkin to get a woman's attention. She comes over and I tell her we never got our cocktails. She departs and returns a few minutes later with our drinks. While she's gone, our waiter stops by and inquires, \"Your drinks never came out?\" Um, no. The second course (Salt and Pepper Soft Shell Crab) arrives, and it's good. The third course (Stuffed Quail) comes out and the server (not the same as before) says, \"I'd like to tell you a bit about this dish.\" We pause our conversation, expecting to hear about the dish, it's ingredients and it's preparation. She continues, \"It's boneless and you can tear it apart using the spoon,\" then she walks away. Wow, thanks for that insight. We ordered the duck add-on, which was delivered by the woman who brought our long-lost drinks. She was super-polished and explained the ingredients that she had set on the table, and suggested the best way to eat the duck and experience all the flavors. She was excellent. So, clearly, there's some service training that needs to be done before this place is actually worth what they're charging. I mean, for $110/each (including drinks, tax, health mandate, and gratuity), each diner at our table got ONE soft shell crab, ONE-HALF a stuffed quail, ONE SERVING of bok choy, and TWO small duck \"tacos\". All was prepared nicely, but paired with the bad service, it just wasn't worth it. If I go back, it will be to sit at the bar and have a drink. There are too many other good restaurants in SF to drop that much change here again.", "author": "BG S."}

I was quite excited to try the place, based on reviews and descriptions.  My two companions arrived before me and it was suggested they have a drink at the bar while waiting for me. The cocktails looked reasonably intriguing.  They would have ordered them if they had been able to get the barman's attention in the ten  minutes they were sitting there, but no luck there. When I came we moved went to the table (ready on time, it has to be said) intending to get a drink there while we figured out the menu.  About ten minutes later someone finally showed and asked if we wanted a drink.  My wife had a question about one of the cocktail ingredients.  No clue, the waiter disappeared to find out.  Several minutes later he came back to take the first drink order.  We're now about 25 minutes in and drinkless.  I got a beer reasonably quickly.  The cocktails, now ordered, make no appearance; we are told they are being prepared.  Meanwhile, we're trying to figure out the menu.  It's a very strange menu.  There are various categories (salads, soups, vegetables, fish and meat, rice and noodles and desert as I recall).  They have a three-dish meal for $39, and a five-dish meal for $69, per person.  But it's not really per person: the table chooses the three or five dishes, but they have to be for the table, meaning the whole table eats the same three or five things.  Annoying, but obviously easier for the restaurant to handle.  We order.  Ten minutes later the first thing arrives, noodles.  Looks like a portion for one person, but it's the portion for three.  They're OK, pretty greasy, above average Chinese noodles, but remember, this plate has cost about $40, if you average out the  costs of the dishes.  Still no cocktails, although it's getting pretty late for them.  Eventually the cocktails come, so late that management agrees to comp them.  They taste like what you would expect \"Walmart Daquiri Mix\" to taste like, sweet and barely alcoholic.  Switch to beer.  Next come the green beans.  Again, a single regular plate for three people. I ask the waiter: \"so if I were here alone, I would get a dish a third of this size?\"  He says that would be the case.  They're pretty good, better than the average green beans/ground meat thing at your local Chinese restaurant.  Then comes a smoked tofu dish, nothing special, and two meat dishes, some kind of beef cheek thing swimming in a tomatoe-ish oily sauce, and quail, both of which are OK, quail even could be called good.  All the dishes were pretty greasy.  Basically you're getting a somewhat better than average Chinese-ish meal for $69 per person (so, close to $100 with tax and tip) and that's with no wine and no dessert (if it's not in your three or five selection).  We had three beers and got out for exactly $100 a person, no desert, tea or coffee.  I just don't get it.  Contrary to most reviews, the service is pretty bad and lacks assurance, although it picked up a bit after the first dismal half hour with cocktail fiasco, but it's certainly nothing special.  I've had worse meals, for sure, but the format is irritating and it may be the single worst value meal I have ever had.  So maybe we went on the wrong night and chose the wrong things, but I would never go again or recommend it to anyone", "author": "Andrew G."}

The food here was indeed great and meticulously plated - however, this goes to show that a single worker's inappropriate comment can ruin an entire group's dining experience. A server delivered a dish noting that this was complimentary from the kitchen. We were so excited (and somewhat confused) as this was unexpected. As we were all about to dive in, he said \"hold up....are you guys not from the restaurant industry\" and after we looked confused, he immediately pulled the dish away as my friend was about to take a bite and said \"sorry, we only do this for folks in the industry\". I tried to talk to the same server who delivered the dish again asking for clarification, but he just said \"sorry about that\" and walked away as I was in the middle of talking to him. I complained immediately to the manager to let him know that their staff needs to be better trained on overall professionalism. I'm not sure if anything was done in response to this, but I'd like to send a message to the restaurant team that a great restaurant of this caliber should not be hiring staff with no customer service skills. Unfortunately, my group and I cannot recommend this place given our extremely poor experience. That said, I'd like to give two big thumbs up on the overall culinary side (except the desserts), restaurant decor (except poor ventilation as we all smelled like grease after leaving the place).", "author": "Sus T."}
