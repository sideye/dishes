Ambiance, Taste, and service. All really good! I got vanilla bean latte, which was pretty damn good, and a caramel/butterscotch glazed cake/bread! It's displayed in the front of the cashier. That cake was just amazing. It tasted even better with the vanilla bean latte. I like it very much when my drink and pastry just blends in well! \n\nThe owner was very friendly and so was the barista. I think its usually just the owner and one worker working together. I've been here twice. It also seemed like most of the customers here are regulars. \n\nAs a tourist, i highly recommend coming here for a grab in the morning and find a bird (scooter) and go inside the golden gate park! It's what i did and remains as the favorite part of my trip!", "author": "Mike K."}

The shop fits over what you'd expecting looking from the outside. Anyways, the coffee was a great pick me up, we decided to pick up the vanilla bean latte and the butterscotch latte.

Plenty of metered parking nearby & a local interior design store next door. \n\n- Customer service is above average.

Coffee and vanilla are my two favorite past times, so I was set on trying the vanilla bean latte after seeing this on the menu. It sounded better than it tasted, i'm afraid. Since the price point was a bit steep, I expected something a bit more outstanding. Okay fine.. It's a latte with vanilla bean.. Simple ingredients. The texture was buttery and smooth and specs of vanilla bean harmoniously blended with the espresso. It was alright. Nothing too crazy though. I instantly downed my cup in less than 5 minutes because I needed to get out of there.

Seating is limited and lining up for drinks necessitates some squeezing around the milk bar, but the interior is calm and inviting. Or so I thought.\n\nI got a matcha tea latte and my partner got a loose leaf tea latte. My drink was delicious, with nice warming spices and just enough grassy flavor from the matcha. My partner's tea latte was not so great and mostly tasted of warm milk (even after 20 minutes of steeping). We were sad that the simple drink was such a big miss.\n\nIn addition to the sad drink, one of the main reasons I'm docking stars is due to the conversation the employees were having. I'm just wondering, was it really necessary for then to go on a very loud and very extended diatribe about how sexual assault claims are \"overblown\" these days? Is it really necessary to claim that a woman could have been paid off to come forward about sexual harassment? And is it really necessary for employeed to describe in detail a woman's sexual harassment claim, only to then dismiss it because she \"could have left\"? If these are your opinions, do they need to be shared so loudly at work when there are lots of patrons? It made the atmosphere go from cozy and welcoming to \"wtf.\"\n\nAnyway, reader, you may not find this kind of talk unpleasant, and I'm sure not every employee at Hollow feels the same compunction to share their views about sexual assault so loudly.

We stopped by here before breakfast for something warm and sweet. The store is such a nice quaint space. It's small and intimate, and the baristas are friendly and helpful to new customers! \n\nI tried their regular latte, their cinnamon bun biscuit, and their banana bread on my first visit. The latte was absolutely delicious! Their espresso has a strong rich flavor that isn't too bitter or overwhelming. It's perfect without adding anything, and compliments their pastries well! I can't rave about how much I loved their little treats. I hope they're made fresh in house! They even warm up your pastry for you in a little toaster oven if you want it hot! \n\nThe next day I couldn't help but come back, it was so good! I didn't get a pastry this time since they're a bit pricey, but I did decide to try their flavored lattes. My friend and I ordered a vanilla bean latte and a butterscotch latte. I love coffee shops that use fresh ingredients to flavor their coffee rather than sugary syrups, and that's exactly how they do it at Hollow. The vanilla bean latte had all the delicious flavors of their original latte with the hint of vanilla bean, flavored by what I assume are vanilla bean shavings. The butterscotch however was my favorite. I didn't order it myself because I was worried it'd be too sweet, but I was kicking myself when I tried my friend's. It was delicious! The best butterscotch latte I've ever had! The flavor wasn't too sweet or overly artificial, but enough to fill your tastebuds with that nostalgic butterscotch flavor. \n\nI recommend all coffee connoisseurs to give hollow a try, you won't regret it!", "author": "Krystyl C."}

The latte was different than anything I've ever ordered, it was great, but not the greatest.

Overall, the spice adds a kick, but I would have definitely preferred more matcha. My boyfriend's mocha was also pretty good, but nothing to write home about. \n\nService: The main reason for the four stars, along with ambiance. The baristas were super sweet, friendly and helpful. We aren't big coffee drinkers (I strictly drink tea), so we're a bit ignorant when it comes to ordering coffee. They were super helpful and patient with us... and I truly appreciated that, because the cafe was pretty busy at the time.

When you go inside, it's almost like stepping into a secret room, away from the city. It's perfect for meeting a friend for coffee and snacks on a cold, drizzly day in SF.\n\nIt was a freezing, drizzly afternoon in SF when I came to Hollow. After reviewing the menu, I had a hard time ordering because I wanted to try many items. I ordered the butterscotch latte because it was one of their house-made specialties. I was afraid it was going to be too sweet but it wasn't. It was subtly sweet with just a light taste of sweet and salty butterscotch and espresso. \n\nI also tried the matcha green tea latte which I didn't quite like. To be fair, I don't like green tea lattes in general (at any coffee shop), so it's not surprising to me. It had a strong matcha and cardamom flavor. If you like green tea lattes, matcha, and cardamom, you might like this latte. \n\nThe vanilla bean latte, one of their other house-made specialties, was deliciously strong, but had a very faint vanilla bean flavor. This might be because it was a large (which comes with two espresso shots), where as the other two were small size (which has one shot). I would have liked a little more vanilla bean flavor in the large latte because the extra espresso shot over powers the vanilla bean taste. This was probably the prettiest of all the lattes though. My favorite out of the three is the butterscotch latte (taste-wise). My friend tried their empanada and liked it.\n\nAll the lattes came with beautiful latte art! Everyone at the tables around me were also taking photos of their coffee. The drinks were a tad bit pricey though.  Small butterscotch latte was $4.25, large vanilla bean latte was $5.25. The size of the coffee is pretty small as well. The staff was pretty friendly. There was only one worker when I ordered so the service was a bit slower as she was doing everything (cashiering, preparing drinks and food), but someone came to help later. There is a small room in the back that provides extra seating and has plenty of cute sundries (cards, sweets, kitchen gadgets, etc.) for sale. \n\nThe name Hollow reminds me of a hollow tree trunk, which is kind of what the inside of the store is like.

It's not really a working cafe though as I didn't see any outlets and there's no wi-fi. It's great for a pitstop when you need a coffee fix or for sitting and doing some reading.", "author": "Audrey L."}

The organic ambiance creates an escape from the suburban sunset district. I myself enjoy environments like this but not for too long. The ceiling was low and I couldn't help but feel a bit enclosed. But sitting by the window and enjoying my vanilla bean soy latte changed my mindset. My friend enjoyed the bench seating against the wall and we sat and talked to our hearts content. \n\nThe vanilla bean soy latte wasn't too sweet with bits of vanilla bean inside. It was smooth and warming to the heart. The soy cappuccino on the other hand, is one of the stronger ones I've ever had. It was robust and hit the right spots.

Now, consider me a willing victim.\n\nA 2 shot Americano here is $2.50 (when I first walked in I thought my drink would be $4 based on the menu...but $4 gets you 4 shots!). That's Starbucks prices, guys. And the Americano here is hands down the BEST I have ever had. I've been a fan of Ritual coffee beans for awhile now but not every coffee shop serving them knows how to handle quality beans. Well, the folks at Hollow know what they're doing. My drink was rich and smooth, with floral notes and no acidity. Perfect.\n\nI also got a chance to try their spiced matcha green tea latte with soy milk and it was heavenly. The price was hell but you get what you pay for in this case. I know the next time I want to treat myself good, I'll be coming here and trying out their in-house butterscotch and vanilla bean lattes!\n\nI don't normally rate my cafes based on ambiance, but Hollow delivers in this department too. It's photogenic without being too Kinfolk and I love the woodsy decor and the delicious baked goods on display. There aren't a lot of places to sit in the front but they recently expanded the back so that there is more seating.\n\nFinally, the service is warm and friendly too. None of this hipster vibe/coffee snobbery or credit card only shiz.

Although the store was quite small, it was very comfortable and cozy. Don't expect to find a seat right away considering the shop's size. There were only 3 tiny tables and they were all taken when I got there so I had to get my coffee to go. \n\nFor drinks, I ordered the vanilla bean and my parents ordered the matcha latte. \n\nVanilla bean latte: 2.5/5 \nI ordered this drink expecting the typical sweet, creamy taste of vanilla but received what roasted pumpkin seed would taste like instead. Because it was hand-made, I was able to taste the crushed solids of the bean in the latte, which would explain the nutty taste of the drink. Despite this unexpected flavor, the taste of the espresso was prominent and smooth. If you're like me and have a huge sweet tooth, I would not recommend this drink. \n\nMatcha latte: 3.5/5 \nMy dad is a huge fan of matcha and takes matcha shots every morning in place of coffee for energy in the morning, so when it comes to any food that include this ingredient, he is highly critical of the taste. When he took his first sip of the drink, he was quite disappointed that it did not have the green tea taste he expected. Instead, it tasted more like a chai tea latte, leaving us confused on whether we enjoyed the drink or not because it tasted great (if you're a chai tea fan) but it wasn't what we expected. We didn't realized it was spiced before we ordered the drink but still enjoyed it! It was a fantastic twist to the drink and recommend it anyone who enjoy the comforting, nutty, and soothing taste of chai or any kind of spiced tea! \n\nOverall, I would definitely visit this coffee shop again and look forward to the next drink to try on their menu :)", "author": "Priscilla P."}

Having lived in Europe and Australia for many years, I am extremely picky about my coffee - the aroma of the beans, the density of the milk in comparison with the coffee, the texture, the temperature and the aftertaste. I have settled for this quaint little coffee boutique with a slightly rustic decor after being disappointed varies times with Blue Bottle and Philz Coffee.\n\nWinner: Soy Latte. Pungent, earthy, nut-like aroma. Perfect acidity level. Smooth, velvety and rich texture with a mildly pleasant aftertaste. \n\nRunner-up: Artisan Dark Chocolate Mocha. Similar to the latte but with a strong shot of chocolate. Perhaps the chocolate was a little too prominent - slightly masking the aroma of the beans.\n \nSecond Runner-up: Titanic II. A good Saturday afternoon nerding session rescuer - robust bitter-sweet latte topped with a gigantic homemade vanilla bean marshmallow. My only complaint is the price ($8.25 for a large.)\n\nThird Runner-up: Butterscotch Latte. If you have a sweet tooth, this one is for you. I personally prefer my coffee to be more on the piquant side of the intensity spectrum. Unfortunately the texture was lacking - more watery and foamy. The butterscotch was overpowering - more of a sugary beverage, not a pick-me-up coffee. \n\nOverall thumbs up for this place.

I doesn't have a strong matcha smell or taste to it... Instead it has more of a spicy/chai taste to it. The aftertaste is when the matcha actually kicks in. Every time you sip in to the latte, you get this interesting jump to it which made me think it was spicy in a chai way (LOL does that make sense?). My mom got the Vanilla Bean Latte and she said there was nothing bad that she encountered while drinking it. Instead, she said it was pretty good. Their latte art is typical but has more detail than a few latte art places I know.

Intrigued.  And I read about their Titanic II.  More intrigued.  \n\nI got a parking spot right smack in front of the entrance.  #meant2be\n\nIt was a typical summer afternoon in SF.  Which is exactly like a typical autumn afternoon most everywhere else.  Read: it wasn't exactly sunny, & it wasn't outright grey, but it was chilly.  The test is whether or not I can put the top down.  I did not.  Sucks to be driving your convertible around getting wind blown w cold air.  And I do not like people that drive with the top down when it's cold outside.  #posers.  Don't be one of those people boys & girls.  I also had to leave my jacket on.  Sigh.  But...typical.  And perfect latte weather.\n\nThe barista was personable & just a gent.  I ordered a matcha green tea almond latte (what I drink almost daily), a butterscotch almond latte, & a mushroom gorgonzola empanada.  To go, to share w the man.  I was told that their Titanic II is like a meal.  So I opted that out for another time.  Breakfast maybe.\n\nI've said before that I'm a real aesthete.  Hollow is an aesthetes dream come true.\nDare I say perfect?  Yeah.  I'd say Hollow hits every point in spades.  Shabby chic.  Rustic, but elegant.  There's elegance in simplicity.  The colors, the wood...every detail perfectly harmonizes w the others.  Ever been to the restaurant @ Manka's Inverness Lodge (before the fire)?  This is what their cafe would look like if they had one.  Really, the space just begs for a magazine lay out.\n\nThe lattes were lukewarm, but I take responsibility for that since I didn't test mine before leaving.  It's also an easy fix.  I tasted the butterscotch & it was wonderfully different.  Because I do matcha lattes almost everyday since about forever, I'm a tough critic there.  This one was good, but was a tad bitter for my taste.  But, that's also an easy fix.\n\nThe empanada was delicious.  I vote for a bit more filling, but it was delicious nonetheless.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-15", "description": "It is impossible to fairly rate Hollow, because it is 5 stars uniqueness, 4 stars menu, 3 stars location, 2 stars seating, and 1 star price.  Before you jump to any Elitist qualms over a 3-star Elite review, I suggest reading the whole review because 1) it is well written and 2) your experience depends on how you weigh different factors.\n\nHollow is a very quaint coffee shop--\"cafe\" is not even an appropriate category, as there is no scene of a bustling morning rush hour or UCSF coffee camper students slaving away on laptops.  Stepping from the commercialized Irving street into this nook, you would suspect floo powder to have teleported you into the heart of Diagon Alley.\n\nThe ambiance is indeed wicked in many ways.  It almost seems to have sprouted out of the ground or carved out of the woods because the nature theme is so permeating and wholly complete, almost magical.  The furniture is composed of unvarnished wood, the coffee and tea are stowed in metal jars, the treats are on glass platters, imaginative trinkets are everywhere, all the writing is done by hand, it is shrouded in dim twilight lighting, and it is complete with a mysterious unlabeled alcove in the back.  Overall, wickedly awesome.  The lost-place-in-the-middle-of-a-fairytale feeling is further conveyed by the interesting music, which can be considered borderline creepy but adds to the curiosity.  (Omg, is the name derived from the Legend of Sleepy Hollow?!  My mind would be blown if I ever find out I solved this mystery)\n\nSo far it sounds either counterculture hipster or very oldschool, right?  Well it's kind of the best of both worlds, because it's whimsical oldschool without a limited oldschool menu, and hipster cool without a hipster snob attitude.  Service was very friendly; the lady took the time to strike up a real conversation so that I wouldn't be awkwardly staring at her make my drink (it's a small place so awkward silences do get awkward, especially with the peculiar background music).  \n\nI love the specialty drinks on the menu, such as the BUTTERSCOTCH LATTE and DARK CHOCOLATE MOCHA.  It takes quite a bit of courage to spend $7.75 on a cup of coffee, but I was fascinated by the TITANIC and decided to splurge to see whether it would be titanic in awesomeness to match the titanic price.  \n\nThe titanic is a dark chocolate mocha topped with a house-made marshmallow.  Not that I am knowledgeable about marshmallows, but the fluffy vanilla marshmallow drowned in bittersweet chocolate and rich espresso was unbelievable and redefined my concept of mocha and marshmallows.  I just wish it could have been more melted because a layer of colloidal marshmallow infused with mocha would have made the priciness worth it.  The unmelted marshmallow was awkward to eat because it's a huge cube.  Very photogenic (I shamelessly took 4 photos) and abstractly captures the essence of the sinking Titanic but not too practical and I was clueless on how to eat it.  Drink all the mocha first?  Nibble on it?  I ended up stabbing it with a coffee stirrer, which was a beautiful delicious mess and probably gave me a marshmallow mustache.  (One-up hipsterness factor I guess)\n\nWas it worth $7.75?  For that one lifetime experience, yes.  I'll probably be back to try the more affordable butterscotch latte and dark chocolate mocha.  The mocha in the titanic was an intense chocolate paired with some fancy coffee--it makes Starbucks mochas taste like icky hot chocolate.  Besides the luxury titanic, there are complaints about the price because their small is a tiny and their large is a medium.  However, I can assure you that the large has the caffeine equivalent of a large.  Even in the context of my copious coffee consumption during finals week, I had to save the rest of it for the next day.\n\nIn case you haven't already noticed, this is definitely not the place to study; it's best for bringing a book or catching up with a friend.  Seating is frustratingly scarce, with only two small tables (though round wooden tables and latte art make excellent Instagrams).  There's also a bench, which doesn't have the best privacy because it's pretty much in the middle of the store.  I would recommend getting your coffee to-go in case your seat gets stolen, and also since I love the paper cups with a slanted signature stamp.\n\nThere is my very complex review for this very complex coffee shop.

Hollow has easily claimed a spot in my trinity of best coffee spaces in the city, joining Sightglass and The Mill. By best coffee spaces, I mean I'll never ask for my cup to-go at any of these three; I'd want to stay a while and soak in the surroundings. Sightglass is large and industrial, The Mill is bright and airy, and Hollow is small, quaint, and cozy. \n\nLocated in what looks to be a multi-level home's garage, Hollow has three tables with two seats for each. Despite the lack of space, the owners have definitely put a lot of thought into using it efficiently. The result is a comforting little getaway reminiscent of fairy tales and hobbits. I was mesmerized by the spread of items for sale, random things adorning the wall, and a menu that is built into a window pane. Every nook and cranny here is so terribly photogenic that I temporarily forgot where I was.\n\nEspresso-based drinks only here, but they do it well and use Ritual beans. For first-timers, I'd suggest trying their specialities, such as a vanilla latte or a butterscotch latte. The butterscotch latte did wonders for my salted caramel-loving taste buds. The ingredients behind the flavoring are all made in-house.\n\nTime seems to move a little slower here, though not in a bad way. The barista wasn't talkative but he skillfully crafted the drinks behind the bar. He saw that I was taking a picture right in front of him and, instead of telling me my drink was done and to take it, he silently walked off and placed it on my table. He really didn't have to, but it was a nice gesture. A great cup of coffee from a teeny coffee shop that doesn't require getting on the freeway...my prayers have been answered.", "author": "Olivia V."}

The narrow space made lining up rather awkward, and I stood between two white people waiting for the one person of color working as a barista to take my order. However, when my turn came, the barista asked who was next and looked instead to the white man after me, who seemed like a regular, and chatted with him.

I'd order it again, but not all the time - a little on the pricey side.\n-Peppermint Rose Tea. Refreshingly light peppermint taste with a very subtle rose. Also $3 for a little pot of tea which was equivalent to about 4 cups of tea. \n-Guinness Beer Cupcake. I thought the cupcake was very sweet and moist - great for you sugar and cake lovers!

Even authentic sipping chocolate in Santa cruz with beans that were imported was cheaper than that or the place near Palo Alto that house makes their marshmallows was also cheaper. Even someone ridiculous as me who would normally be willing to dish out a couple extra dollars to try things was not willing to try that. I instantly silently judged everyone I've seen who has tried the drink LOL. Welp, oh well. I had asked the cashier if they could make the spiced matcha just a normal matcha (so without the cinnamon and whatever else) and he didn't hear me so I let it go. I opted for the butterscotch latte because I'm a huge fan of butterscotch flavor anything. Upon receiving it, it was lukewarm at best even though I got it right when he called it out.

They have a few baked offerings as well, standouts are the cinnamon roll biscuits and the Guinness cupcakes. There's also a pretty big selection of extra-fancy locally produced chocolates, that are kinda pricey but worth it if you're looking to buy gifts for your extra-fancy chocolate loving friends. \n\nSo why only four stars and not five? The service was really spotty. Some days I'd be greeted with a smile and a bit of chat from the barista on duty, and other days I left the shop feeling like I was interrupting the B.O.D.'s personal solitude party. I get it. I hate dealing with most people basically always, and for sure gave the guy working the counter that day the benefit of the doubt, but had the same experience when I went in the next morning. It wasn't enough to keep me away (see the first paragraph, it was literally down the street from where I was) but definitely kept me from ordering anything more than a basic iced coffee from there on out, at the risk of spending more time inside the shop than necessary and thus prolonging the winsome barista's return to peace and quiet.", "author": "AuraLee P."}

The first time I came with my friend, we ordered their butterscotch latte and vanilla bean marshmallow latte.

My friend and I both really enjoyed that drink . It also wasn't to sweet. \nVanilla Bean Marshmallow Latte ( 3/5) \nButterscotch Latte (5/5)\n\nThe second time we went to hollow, we ordered their   Chai Green Tea Latte and it was amazing. You could taste the green tea and it was to sweet, it was just right . The latte art was also really beautiful! \n\nFor our third visit, I tried their dark chocolate mocha and my friend had their chai spiced matcha latte again.

We were being tourists in the area and my husband was craving a latte, so we popped in to check it out. Upon first glance it is absolutely adorable, like something out of a fairy tale, but it is TINY in there -- there were maybe three tiny tables in the front area and you felt like you were right up in the lap next to you, it was close. But it seemed like there may have been seating down the hall (we saw some people leaving after we came in) so that may help.

From the wooden interior design to the outside of the shop. I just love the simplicity and minimal look of the cafe. I got the vanilla bean latte. It was pretty good, but not memorable. This would be my ideal place to sit and read a book or even work a little. My main purpose coming here today was actually to work. However, upon entering, I didn't feel welcomed. There was almost his awkwardness to the guy that was there today. A few minutes later another worker comes in. She gave me this look as I was trying to take the perfect picture to share with the world to show how cute their coffee shop was. I really couldn't get out of there fast enough. I finished my vanilla bean latte and snapped one picture of the outside and left. I may come back at a different time hoping it's two different employees, but I've never felt more uncomfortable at a coffee shop in my life. I was so excited for this spot that I was rushing to get here just to make sure I get a seat. \n\nI'm a customer service nut and what was shown to me today was not up to par. Coming from the food and restaurant industry and years of customer service experience, if I was an undercover customer trying to scope the employees and business out, they would not pass in my book.

The expressionless face, with a hint of subtle annoyance, when you ask for coffee to-go is enough to make you feel like you're asking an im-too-good-for-this teenager to help you set the table. Deeeelightful.\n\nSuggestion Hollow? You are a neighborhood cafe, begin focussing on your customers with a genuine, warm, authentic disposition.

I went in with a big smile on my face, looking forward to checking out Hollow for the first time, and I left with my little cup of Americano and a gray cloud over my head.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I am a super low maintenance customer, very easy to please. I had a question about one coffee description on the chalkboard. It was long and sounded wonderful, but I wasn't sure if it was just one kind of coffee or if it was a couple of different kinds. (Butterscotch, bourbon, other yum words...) I asked if it was all one coffee or a couple. She looked at me as if I were an idiot, and she said it's one. I felt a little dumb, but said it sounds delicious and I'd love a cup. She coldly told me it takes a long time to make that. (Yeah, I know, it's drip, been there, done that.) I said I was fine with that. She gave me an icy stare, so I said if she was busy -- she had two other people she was making coffee for, and I figured some people get stressed out easily -- I'll just have an Americano.\n\n \"It's your choice. What do you want?\" she said. If she said it in a nice way, I'd be like, \"The butterscotchy special, please, I'm in no rush!\" But she said it in an icy, condescending way that made me feel like I was a stupid dork, which is not at all a normal mode for me. \"I'll have the Americano. I need to get out of here.\" I said it pleasantly, as if I had to go pick up my kids, so probably no one but me read into it. \n\nWhile waiting, I heard her being rude to the next customer, who asked for almond milk in something. So even then, I knew it wasn't just me. But reassuring to see the other one-star reviews. \n\nI give it 2 stars bc it's a very cute little place. Whoever owns the place put a lot of love and thought into the design. He or she might want to think again, though, about who they hire. I will definitely not be going back. (Please tell me the woman who served on April 18 was not the owner!)\n\nOh, haha, the coffee cup it says \"Hollow: Never take coffee from strangers.\" Just thought that was mildly ironic in some way. ;)", "author": "Maria G."}

I've been there 5 times. \n\nOne time I told them I wanted cream and sugar on the side to go because I didn't know what the people I was getting coffee for wanted. They were very annoyed and they didn't have any small containers for that so they poured cream into a regular sized coffee cup and scooped sugar into another. There weren't even lids on them. They didn't say a word to me the whole time, just slammed it on the counter. They wouldn't even look at me. Also I had to carry multiple cups in my arms because they don't ahve those holders for multiple cups. Every time I ask a question they act as if I'm the stupidest asshole in the room who is just inconveniencing them even though the place is always empty when I'm there.

Clever?\n\nGiven the intimacy of the shop, the barista is someone you'll probably get to know as you become a regular. She has an amazing way of putting you at ease. I can't imagine her yelling :D \n\nWhen I asked her to dump ice in my hot black tea (I wanted an iced tea but they don't cold brew) she told me it wouldn't be good in that wry, impish sorta way that just made me have to have it*.\n\nFor those attracted by the glitter, there are all sorts of slick doodads for sale -- artisanal soap, rustic wood-and-steel wine openers, copper salt shakers, etc. I'll probably buy some for my apartment, but I think the intention is to signal quality.\n\nAs a side note, after my friend tasted his Vanilla Bean Latte, he let me know that this was his FIRST TIME DRINKING COFFEE EVER**. I couldn't believe it at first, but he explained to me that coffee is completely avoidable -- there's no peer pressure in college (unlike, say, alcohol) because by ubiquity (it's a completely unregulated drug) we all assume everyone has tried it already, and you can easily sidestep with a tea or a cocoa at a cafe. So there it is.\n\nFour stars for intimacy, service, and hipness.\n\n--------\n\n*It wasn't bad, and I would get it again. My buddy and I decided to call it Revelation 3:16.

I'm not sure if Bible-thumping is quite the phrase at least from a literal sense: they used it as a book, not a prop.***\n\n**Unwittingly, it seems. He thought the vanilla bean was supplanting the coffee bean, which is reasonable.\n\n***Although they are ministers, so from a figurative sense this would work. That's a discussion for another day. I'm not sure if this note even deserves its own indirection, since it is so closely related to the parent and hardly any more parenthetical than the original. In fact, it doesn't deserve it's own indirection, and I'm sorry for writing it this way.**** There is such thing as bad style. Quality.\n\n****I once got in trouble in Jr. High for using footnotes (like, for using them at all)  My teacher may have been under the impression that giving parenthetical thoughts a platform steals the limelight, and leads to general discursion, although what _isn't_ discursion, i.e. so why stop at door #1? This is why I was never a straight-A student, but thankfully my parents were more interested in my personal salvation than my report card, which makes you really stop and think about what this whole thing at a pretty young age.

To start, the coffee is great. The espresso shots are consistently perfect and smooth while the cold brewed iced coffee is a delicate dance of chocolatey deliciousness. The space is small, but I don't think a coffee shop owes it to its customers to be large. When I get a table I feel like I scored, and when I don't, i just go back to my classroom.\n\nThe objects for sale are all out of my price range but I like to look and dream that someday I may buy every slingshot, camping mug, and herb infused soap that my eyes fall upon. I'm a sucker for beautiful things and this place has many of them. It really is excellently curated. \n\nNow the best part, the baristas. It seems some folks have found them unfriendly  which I'm truthfully kind of shocked by. They are, in fact , quite friendly, just not in an insincere corporate kind of way.

I went in wanting to try the Titanic II but seeing as the price was $8.50 (could just get lunch for that price) I opted for the butterscotch latte. And though I wasn't expecting it to be an overwhelming sweet caramel taste it honestly tasted like steamed milk, could barely taste the butterscotch and even had my friend try it to double check. My friend got just a regular French press which wasn't anything extraordinary that you couldn't make in your own kitchen. So for $4 and a \"small\" which was essentially the size of a water cup, I wont be coming back.

Since I'm only living in SF for a few more weeks, I made sure to stop by.  The place itself is really tiny, so don't plan on meeting a huge group of friends here.  But if you just want a cozy, quieter place to catch up with one friend, this may be the place.  \n\nThe menu seems a bit hidden if you're never been before, it's behind the counter and against the back wall.  They have pretty standard coffee house offerings, and I went with one of my favorites- the vanilla latte.  I chose a small and it cost $3.75.  It definitely is on the smaller side, but it's tasty and I prefer quality over quantity.  The drink was not the best vanilla latte that I've had, but definitely worth trying.  On the menu, it says \"house made,\" so I think that means that they make the vanilla syrup/flavoring there (?).  I saw lots of little black specks in the latte, so I'm assuming that it was vanilla.  The latte was on the sweeter side, so even if you don't drink coffee or like coffee that much, I think the drink is pretty good.  I appreciate the attention to detail and hand-crafted-ness of the drink.  Plus, the barista made a pretty foam art piece on top.  Barista was not overly talkative, but he was very nice.\n\nWhile you're waiting for the drink to be made, there is plenty to look at as well.  Soaps, candles, stationary, wine openers, lighting fixtures- there's a little bit of everything.  The store is small, but they do have a lot in there.  There are a couple of tables inside, but it was a nice day so I chose to sit at the one table outside of the shop. \n\nP.S.

There's also really nice smelling soaps, candles and perfumes that would make nice gifts. It's so easy to walk out of this coffee shop spending $30 instead of the $4.\n\nThe only con is that the cup sizes weren't consistent for me. The first time I went, the server asked me what size, and I said Medium. He pulled out two cups and said those were the only sizes he carried. The second time I went, I ordered a latte again and they automatically assumed I wanted a small. I let it pass because \"the smaller cup\" was what I got last time -- and guess what?

I actually passed it the first time and had to drive back around, but was really excited when I saw how cute it was. They sell  cute, but expensive little knick knacks. \nThe  employees could use a course in customer service. They were unpleasant and very dry, verging on being a little bit rude. It made me feel uncomfortable to be in such a small space with them. The girl broke a glass vase and I was getting sugar for my coffee, and pieces of it hit me in the leg (which didn't hurt me at all), and she gave me the driest, least genuine \"sorry\" I've ever heard. Like I said, it didn't hurt me, but I work in customer service and I would have at least sounded apologetic if I had done that. Furthermore, when my friend paid for his coffee she set the iPad to the side and didn't say anything to him, as he walked away she said, \"do you want to sign this?!\" ....Okay lady, you could've asked him, as the iPad was not placed in front of him. \nOnto the coffee: I ordered the Titanic. I asked her what was in it and she dryly said, \"it's just a dark mocha\" ...so I ordered it. It was $8 for the \"large.\" Their \"large\" is probably the size of a small anywhere else. The titanic isn't terrible, but it's definitely not worth $8. \nThey also leave some of their pastries out right under where you order, so you're breathing on them and talking over them as you order. This is the season where everyone is sick, which means a lot of coughing and germs. Gross. \n\nCute place and I'm not opposed to paying these types of prices, but I don't like the atmosphere and I don't like paying a lot for coffee and being treated as though my business is insignificant or unimportant.

And it's probably mostly amazing (given the reviews). But, my experience today was very off-putting. Two reasons, both very important ones:\n\n1) The coffee (French press) was brewed against a timer, and--again--judging by the ambiance and hype around this place, it should have been delicious. However, my cup tasted old and lifeless. So, no matter how fancy and coffee-aficionado-friendly this place looks, they can't win me over with stale beans. \n\n2) Most importantly, the barista was a surly, miserable jerk. Tall guy with a fresh face and dark hair. He was: unfriendly (from the beginning), unwilling to be (to act, to pretend to be) helpful. I ordered a large French press to share and he put it in one cup even though I said it was for two people. My friend came back to him after he served the cup and ordered a second, which he never made. When I returned to ask about the second cup he angrily informed me that there's a line and that my friend didn't pay anyway. So he never told my friend that-- he just ignored the request. We weren't cutting in line or trying to-- each of us just wanted some coffee (and we were the only customers when we ordered it).\n\nSo, two stars, because the barista's attitude was completely uncalled for.

There's something special about the foam.  The nonfat latte is rich, smooth, deep in flavor and almost creamy. However, it only comes in one size ($2.85), and it's TINY.  It's the smallest latte I've ever had.  I guess the size matches the size of the shop. Much as I loved the latte, it's so small that I can't possibly get through the morning with just one of those.\n\nI spotted cookies (e.g., cashew, chocolate chip) and handmade truffles (made by a friend of the owner).  I tried a Meyer lemon shortbread, a delicate cookie with a hard glaze.  I noticed a tiny bit of lemon rind but the cookie didn't have much lemon flavor.  The Madras curry truffle was creamy with a soft, milk chocolate ganache center but it didn't have curry flavor.  I liked the Meyer lemon truffle better.  It had a thin shell and a soft, creamy white chocolate ganache center.  You can taste the lemon but the flavor isn't overpowering.  \n \nThere are two tiny tables inside for coffee drinkers.", "author": "Lolia S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-09-05", "description": "I live around the corner from the Hollow and have bought coffee, such as lattes and cappuccinos, as well as pastries for several years since it first opened. The coffee and pastries are delicious.  I am reluctantly giving the Hollow a two-star rating because of the painfully slow service the caf\u00e9 provides. I understand that the caf\u00e9 is a small business and the coffee takes time to prepare, but the employees working the coffee machine and cashier are unreasonably slow in serving customers, almost to the point of unprofessionalism.  Today, I was the first person in line, but I noticed that the cafe was packed with sitting customers. The cashier essentially ignored me standing in front of the cash register while she spoke to someone else for about five minutes. The barista started chatting to a few customers who entered the caf\u00e9 after me and also ignored me. The last straw, and what caused me to leave, was that I noticed a lot of empty cups near the coffee machine that indicated outstanding coffee orders that the barista had yet to fill.  I have very little time to wait for my morning coffee, so I decided to just walk the few blocks to Andronico's and get my coffee there. I have spoken to the owners a few times, and I wonder if they would appreciate the lack of service their employees are providing their customers.  At this point, I am reluctant to go back to the Hollow, and, instead, will buy my coffee at the Starbucks or Andronicos, although I would say the Hollow has better coffee. The quality of the coffee simply does not make up for the poor customer service at the Hollow.", "author": "Faye D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-06", "description": "This place is the epitome of San Francisco hipster. It is a small, hole-in-the-wall type of coffee shop that also sells organic soaps, candles, and other useless trinkets. When I first walked by on the street, I wasn't even sure this was a cafe. Nearly every inch of counter space was covered with superfluous wares for sale, when all I really wanted was a cup of coffee. The poor barista barely had any room to work and only had about a 5 by 5 inch square of counter on which he could serve my drink. From the customer side, the general layout of this already small space was confusing, because there is no clear area for ordering and paying. I understand that Hollow is trying to be unique and hip and cool, but I don't think the overdone decor was worth the compromise in functionality. I think to be a true fan of Hollow, you really have to buy into this contrived image of the \"alternative\" cafe. \n\nNow on to the actual coffee, I ordered the Titanic II, which is essentially a dark chocolate mocha with a giant handmade marshmallow floating in the center. This drink was served in a bowl - no handle. I guess I was suppose to drink it Asian-style, which is fine, because I'm Asian (duh) and drink stuff out of bowls all the time. I just didn't expect it coming from a bona fide cafe.  And to be honest, it felt a little weird sitting outside holding a bowl up to my face. Overall, I was satisfied with the quality. The dark chocolate in the mocha was delicious and it was not too sweet, with a nice balance of coffee and chocolate. A pet peeve of mine though is that the drink was lukewarm, whereas I like my coffee to be piping hot. \n\nThe takeaway: Good coffee at reasonable prices, especially for a cafe in the city. This is why I give Hollow 4 stars. However, I could do away with all the extraneous decoration. It did not make me feel cool. It just made me feel like a phony hipster.", "author": "Lina Z."}

Little did I know that when I was told this was an obscure spot did I realize it after I passed it 5 times. Hmmm, peeped in the window to see if it was open, how cute and charming was this place. I walked through the green door, it had little planter boxes outside, no sitting area on the inside or outside and I will explain why after the rest of my encounter. The inside is narrow and rustically dark, very European country side with knick knacks such as garden items, boutique perfumes (ingenious because after you smell each perfume, your nose palate gets cleansed by the surrounding coffee smell), soaps and candles. Think Harry Potter country side store without the actual magic, but this place was in itself magical as it is. \nNow to the things I came here for, what do you think of when you think of \"decaf\" coffee, flavorless, blah, similar to non alcoholic beer, wtf is the point? The coffee that was made is comparable if not BETTER then blue bottle, I shift you not (yes, I meant to say \"shift\"). I see that this place is environmentally conscientious as it had a little spot for your cream and sugar, no sugar packets or plastic stirrers and all the items were recycled except for the coffee lids which is understandable. The coffee is made with thought and care, for decaf, it was DELICIOUS, I almost drank it before it got to its intending consumer. I also got a Guinness cupcake, I don't know where they purchase it but someday I'm going to get the recipe, it's moist and delicious and the frosting is cream cheese goodness, not butter cream crap(not a fan). \nOk, so the reason for no seating inside and or outside is to preserve the quality of the coffee, think about it, no loiters or people waiting impatiently for their coffee while crowded amongst the loiterers, it makes sense. Retain the quality of the coffee and retain the loyal coffee drinkers, this is almost like a hidden gem, too good to talk about yet I have to relay the goodness.

There's something extra satisfying when that very same location has just opened, and you feel like you've *discovered* something. I suppose that's a large part of the appeal of Yelp to me. I remember the thrill of having first post on at least one place on this site. Maybe it's a similar instinct that drives people to leave graffiti on a pristine wall, or to take the time and effort to write \"first post\" in the comments section of some on line video share sites. Whatever it is, the excitement is palpable, and apparently runs as a crosscurrent throughout humanity. It is with that same excitement that I am writing about Hollow.\n\nLast weekend, walking to Underdog for lunch, we passed a new storefront right next to the hand rolled cigar store, and across from the red brick Chinese seafood emporium. Stopping in for \"just a peek\" turned into a substantial visit that warmed my heart to the point of being inspired to review after having taken many months off since even logging into this site.\n\nMy gf and I enjoyed chatting with the proprietors who were both in the place making espresso drinks, tea, and serving good local pastries. I forget where they were from, but having 2 wheat-free (and one gluten free) pastries was a big plus for me. I liked the macaroon and peanut butter chocolate chip blob. My gf said the maple glazed scone thing was awesome. Both of us are caffeine-phobic, yet the smell of the Ritual coffee upon entrance was enough to inspire us to try it. We both shared a single latte. I was pleasantly buzzed, without any sour stomach aftereffects. While chatting and complementing the coffee, I learned form the barista that Ritual certifies and trains the business that serve their beans. That apparently includes something about how long the shots are pulled, in order to get maximum flavor and minimum bitter.

They roast Ritual coffee, which I've been hearing about, and the owner was super nice so I decided to throw caution to the wind and try a cup of coffee after 3pm today.  They only brew espresso drinks, so I went with the Americano.  DELICIOUS!!  Ritual coffee certainly lives up to the hype, and this is the place to get it if you don't want to deal with snobby coffee roasters (which is what I've heard about the location in the Mission).  Parking is on the street, but it's incredibly easy to get parking in that neighborhood.  Not sure if there is outdoor seating in nice weather, but I sure hope so!", "author": "Cori D."}

Bottom line, fine coffee, caring owners, a top-notch experience at a tiny neighborhood coffee joint. \n\nGuiness-beer chocloate cupcake induced a sugar high I'm likely to remember for some time to come.\n\nSince its unlikely I'll ever live the dream of running such a shop myself, I'll freely dispense some advice: the euro-kitch does create ambience and coziness... but the balance tips slightly towards clutter: lose a few items and/or widen the geographic scope of the offerings. If it was me, I'd say focus on countries/cultures that supply the coffee you so ably serve up; perhaps by toning down the extraneous decor a bit you could add another table or a small counter since part of the joy of this venue is the cozy, local atmo; add one or two different coffee options for the espresso aficionados who might like to try a 'flight' and compare... the husband half of the owner team clearly knows his stuff and, like a vintner, could educate visitors on the differences between beans, roasts, and geographic sources;  add more tea choices; wander past the pastry aisle at Rainbow Foods and include a few of their home-made, healthy, locally-micro-produced products in your spread...they'd complement the nice items you already have.\n\nThere is something also pretty cool about the fact they're right next door to a cuban cigar factory. Now, what can we do to create some kind of unprecedented (unnatural?) sybmiosis between these two places?!", "author": "Michael H."}

Vegans would be happy with the huge selection of desserts here!\nI am coming back to get an empanada next time, they looked delicious. \nThe owner is extremely pleasant to talk with, and she knows coffee well! She prepared an excellent cappuccino for me, and even put together an ice tea for my friend-even thought it wasn't part of their menu. \nThere is also Red Blossom tea, which is definitely my favorite tea in the bay area! \n\nI hope local residents continue to visit and support this lovely cafe!", "author": "Alexandra a."}

Part of its charm is the closet size space, so that I will leave alone.  There needs to be a tiny bit of uncluttered counter space by the register to place drinks on, or pehaps sit my purse down while rifling around for cash.  I'm not  really sure if there is a good way to prevent bottle necks, but the milk and sugar at the back make for a little cluster fuck if anyone else is at the register trying to balance their hot drink, while shoving change into their wallet  and waiting for you to fix your. shit and get out of their way.

I'd had a chance to peek inside a couple times before (they were also closed president's day) and had been interested by the  kind of second-generation-hippie woo-woo vibe(as opposed to the openly hostile environments of most chic mission coffee houses). Mostly I just needed badly to be able to get a decent cup of coffee in my neighborhood. Its a small space, longer than it is wide (which is nice, i like that) that has just two tables right up front (the front one is like exactly perfect for people watching in my opinion[if thats your thing]). There are a lot of... things, for sale. I agree that it reminds of Paxton Gate; a bunch of things that I either think are really stupid or completely awesome (Holy s---, they sell BATS, C, come look at this they sell bats I'm getting one, we need a bat, its not FOR anything, its... its a bat) that no one actually needs and I don't have the money to get any of this anyway why did I ever even come here... I hate that bat. \n\nI will say it is a very thoughtfully selected collection of stuff and definitely establishes the P.O.V. for the place (If you have ever been to Vashon Island, WA then you've got a pretty good frame of reference) I will even admit to briefly deciding I needed a pair of salt shakers with tops shaped like animal heads and then C talking me down. Anyway, you've got to walk past all these things to get your coffee.\n\nC ordered a Gibraltar (which is not something I would ever do in a new place like this because what if they don't have the cup and get embarrassed or think I'm an asshole or or???). My anxiety disorder and I ordered a latte. We all decided to share a vanilla cup-cake.\n\nSince we were the only ones there I can't speak much to service except to say that the man and the woman were very professional and welcoming, our drinks were prepared swiftly.\n\nWe sat at the table that wasn't the one that was right in front of the window and perfect for people watching. This bugged me but the table we were at was actually still pretty good for window watching and I was probably just being childish.\n\nThe coffee was good, the cupcake was good and both had prices that made sense.

The owner (I am assuming/same guy as in the picture) is friendly and helpful.  The Americano was among the best I've had with a thick layer of crema on the top.  And though I did not partake, Hollow has a nice little selection of bakeshop sweets that look every bit as delicious and high quality as the coffee.  Although I worried about the lack of patrons during my time there, I plan to keep going back with the hope that others will too.  This place reminds me of the kind of shop one might find on the tiny streets of the Marais, not on the somewhat tired stretch of Irving between 19th Ave and Andronico's.  But with the opening of Underdog, King of Noodle and now Hollow, I am beginning to wonder if this is a temporary flurry of delightful new additions to my neighborhood or the beginning of something new in the sleepy Sunset.  I am hoping for the latter.", "author": "Christopher M."}

And in the 'Set?!), but the merchandise is cool, and the owners are always friendly. Yeah, like others have said it's on the smallish side, but I kinda like it that way.  Makes it feel like you're the first person to discover it...", "author": "Nate H."}

I would advise people to start going now, and get to know the friendly owner before they get too many customers to be able to know each one personally.", "author": "Nora O."}

This is the perfect place to get a cup of well-made coffee and feel inspired by the surroundings. They carry fun and reasonably priced curios/small home accoutrements. It's a small, but cozy, space. The interiors will relax you. It reminded me of petite curio shoppes in Scandinavia. A real gem - I'm proud to have them in the Sunset.", "author": "C L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-25", "description": "Hollow is such a great addition to the neighborhood.  The owners, who as I understand are husband and wife, are both so very friendly; and they prepare the drinks so very well.  I can't order a latte at most cafes, because most cafes burn the milk.  You can't really blame them since so many people ask for their drinks to be \"extra hot.\"  Seems to be the norm.  The point is, Hollow is not most cafes.  The milk is steamed to a perfect temperature and it always looks beautiful.  This is all not to mention the charming, for lack of a better word, \"trinkets\" that are for sale--from strange bird cages to candle sticks mounted on driftwood; from uniquely crafted coffee and tea mugs to metal, animal-shaped drawer handles.  It's all great stuff, nothing tacky.  The place almost feels as if you're entering the owners' home, which seems to give even the most out of touch customers an overly respectful demeanor.  This all adds up to five stars some how.  Go check out Hollow.", "author": "Gregory H."}
