Reservations are strongly recommended as this is a small restaurant. \n\nService was slow. The wait staff seemed understaffed and somewhat stressed. The kitchen is partially visible, and looked to be manned by two cooks. They were hustling, but had a hard time keeping up with the full dining room.\n\nWe started with fried calamari. The calamari was heavily battered and deep fried. It is served with a small side of spinach and some grilled artichokes. It is a huge portion that was enough to be shared by a party of four or more. A little overcooked, I thought this appetizer was pretty average.\n\nI ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs. The presentation was lovely. Three large meatballs with a generous pile of pasta. I thought the meatballs were yummy, but the marinara gravy was just okay.\n\nCesario's wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here. It is convenient if you are staying at JW or Donatello.", "author": "Paul C."}

My party is accustomed to eating here prior to theater events at the Marines Memorial.  In the past we have had only good experiences.  Tonight we had a 6:30 reservation.  Everyone was there and seated at 6:30 (this becomes important later).  We received beverages and ordered food at 6:45, including an appetizer.  At 7:40, we had not received even a moment of staff attention.  We had no food, and our beverage glasses were long empty.  As we had theater tickets next door for 8pm, we inquired when our food would arrive.  The waitperson chastised us for asking, saying that the next table were seated before us, and they didn't have their food yet, so we should not complain.  A manager came over and told us that because 2 members of our party arrived 15 minutes early, that \"threw the kitchen off\" and that's why we had no food an hour after placing our order.  Shortly thereafter our food arrived.  All of it was severely overcooked, particularly fish and chicken items.   The added indignity is that all five entrees were cold.  One person with an allergy had asked if a dish had a problematic ingredient, and was told no - only to receive a plate including copious amounts of it.  The appetizer never arrived at all.  At no point did anyone apologize for the wait, the service, or the food issues.  When the bill arrived, it was for the full amount, including the appetizer that we didn't receive.  Voices had to be raised in order to get it removed from the bill.   Epically poor experience.  Any house can have a bad night - it's all about how you handle it.  Not recommended.", "author": "scout s."}

We reserved a late dinner so I did not bring my wallet because I don't like walking in a new city, at night with it out. When I was not asked for my ID when looking at wine and asking for wine pairing recommendations, I assumed she did not need it as she noticed I was old enough. I was flattered but very annoyed after 20 minutes or so of choosing a wine and her bringing us different bottles that she then asked for my ID. Wasted my time, but understandable. \n\nNow, the service did not match the prices on the menu unfortunately. The host did not welcome us and we saw no smiles or enjoyment in their work. It was a small place and full as it was, there was plenty of staff for the service to go smoothly. The \"house bread\" was soft but served cold. When our food came out, my penne was undercooked, chewy and stuck to the roof of my mouth. \n\nThe ambience was off at that point and my birthday dinner went down the drain. So, we asked for boxes and a bag- I told her the problem and that we would like to have the check and to leave. After that, EVERYONE was rude to us. She rolled her eyes at us, they did nothing to rectify the nasty dish or take it off the check. Our waitress seemed annoyed at us for a problem they created. My husband still left a 15% tip at least.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this restaurant because the prices do not match the food that is cooked nor the service that is given. Find another restaurant or you will be just as disappointed as we were.", "author": "Kallista T."}

The half bottle tasted like the stuff they would serve to people at a timeshare informational. The seafood paella risotto was anything but like a paella or a risotto. The seafood looked like it was rejected by Costco and ended up on the conveyor belt of a sushi train place for demo before it came to the kitchen.  \n\nThe dessert which was complimentary was the best part by far hence the two star rating. The owner/manager asked us to move because there was a bigger group coming and therefore they gave us dessert as tribute for moving. The servers and everyone working was very nice and friendly which is why they got more than just a one star rating.

There were three of what I would call cutlets of breast meat that would seem to be of that size due to pounding them which would have made them more tender. So I'm not sure why the chicken was a little too firm. But the Marsala was so delicious that I was able to put that aside and enjoy the meal.", "author": "Susan C."}

When I entered the restaurant it smelled great and there was a line to get in.  Once the folks ahead of me were seated I saw an open table for 2.  The hostess/manager came up to me and when I told her the table was for 1 person, she told me it would be a 10 minute wait.  I  agreed and waited.  Shortly thereafter, a two-top became available at the window.  Two men in back of me entered the restaurant and one walked up to a waitress and said - you remember me right?  Can I have a seat by the window.  He had not been waiting in line but he had been there before and the waitress remembered him.  She sat them right away as I still waited.  Suddenly 4 tables were available and then a party of 4 walked in and got seated.  At that point I was not happy at all.  It's taken me a long time to get comfortable eating as a party of 1 and I was not being treated like parties of 2 or more.  I complained to the hostess/manager and she said the party of 4 had been waiting next door.  Still doesn't explain the party of 2 that was seated ahead of me.  Plus there were many open tables and I was still standing.  I have been in the hospitality industry for over 30 years and this was not what I would call being hospitable.  After I complained, I walked out and found a fantastic restaurant that had no problem with a party of one.  Maybe one day I'll taste the food here - not sure I want to try again though.", "author": "Robin R."}

Luckily, we got there about 6:00, because we were seated right away.  When we left at 7:00 it was packed.  The place is very small, but the table arrangement is very well done to maximize seating without having the tables super close.  Additionally, the staff is attentive and very efficient, as everyone pitched in to help serve, bus, etc. and you didn't have to wait for *your* server when you wanted something.\nI had the clam chowder and bruschetta - both were very good.  You could taste the clams in the soup (maybe some would say it was fishy - I liked it) and the bruschetta was fresh and tasty.  My husband had the Cappellini Gamberi, also very good.  The cream sauce was very light - not like an alfredo.\nFor dessert we had the cannoli.  OK, the outside was a little TOO hard and crispy, but the inside was excellent.\nFor the price, overall it was excellent.  It was much less expensive than some of the other places we looked at, and they would have had to be WAY better to justify the price hike.", "author": "Lydia C."}

I asked the waitress if my dish was vegetarian since I am a strict vegetarian and always like to double check. She assured me that the dish I chose was vegetarian. I had a tasty dish, nothing super special, but when I started into the last third of it I saw what looked like a piece of meat. I had my boyfriend try it and he said it was unmistakably bacon. I lost my appetite but sucked it up and ate a couple more bites in order to try to not to be wasteful. \n\nWhen I informed the waitress of the kitchen's mistake, she apologized but brought us the check for the full amount. I was surprised because, though this doesn't happen often, whenever I've been in a similar situation at another restaurant, they have always gone above and beyond to make things right. Even in cases when something is slightly off, the restaurant will usually offer something to make up for the customer's displeasure. For example, a month ago I went to one of the other Italian spots I frequent in this neighborhood and noticed that the sauce on my pasta was different from the previous time I'd gotten it (there was a new chef and he/she didn't make it quite as well). They not only gave me a replacement entree at no additional charge, but to my delight also gave us a free dessert. I had only asked if the sauce had changed and had not even made a complaint nor expected any reparations, but the restaurant still made sure we were fully satisfied. \n\nI was very disappointed when I received the check for the full amount. I then asked the waitress to remove the charge for my entree, upon which she looked surprised and turned to the manager, who questioned the legitimacy of my claim and then proceeded to begrudgingly offer a 10 percent discount. To management: I live just a couple blocks from the restaurant and could have become a frequent diner. Imagine if you found something you find unappetizing in your food that you specifically asked not to have. Even if others might enjoy it, it really ruins your dining experience, regardless of whether you find it at the beginning or the end of the meal.", "author": "Lilia T."}

The customer service was okay, although our waitress had really strong accent, so some things she was saying were hard to understand.. I don't know how restaurants can hire someone to serve their food when the staff can not speak clear! They offer a 10% discount but it's a trap!

The ambience is great, service is excellent, the portions are the right size, and the pricing was within expectation for the portion sizes. \n\nFor vegetarians: this place has excellent vegetarian options. It has a large number of vegetarian pasta selections, a large number of vegetarian appetizers, and a few vegetarian entrees. \n\nI ordered a fettuccine with pesto, and requested that mushrooms be added on top (and they had no problem accommodating that request). The pasta was absolutely delicious - really well made. In addition, I found the risotto that I ordered to be excellent as well. \n\nService was fantastic as well - really courteous throughout. I'd note though that the seating is very close together (this doesn't affect me, but it might be bothersome for some)\n\nNote: I would call this more of a low $$$ than a $$ restaurant - expect to spend about $40-50 in all if ordering an appetizer/dessert, an entree/pasta, and wine.", "author": "Rohan S."}

The manager had the fucking decency to tell the customers to hurry up because there were people that were waiting for their table. I really like this restaurant but the guy didn't do shit. He was just standing there looking around. The custmores on the other hand were done with their food, only their waters were on the table. I swear to god if next time this happens again i will go inside and do something about it. We were there to celebrate our mom's birthday. I am just so angry. If my mom didn't keep telling me not to go in there and if we weren't there for her birthday i would have gone inside and gave guy a piece of my mind. The fact that he didn't tell the customers that we were waiting pisses me off even more. I work in a restaurant too, i get it, it gets busy but if there were custmores who were taking a long time and someone else needed the table i would go up to them and tell them in a nice way \"hey guys there are customers who have been waiting for a table for a long time do you think you can hurry up, they need it\". I would have the decency to do that. But it just pisses me off so bad. I haven't gone to this restaurant in so long, i work practically every day managing the restaurant when my boss is not there, i don't get the time to spend that much with my family and i was really looking forward to it tonight.", "author": "Marina F."}

My bf suggested we walk a block and see what's around. He randomly picked Cesarios Fine Dining. He said we should just go in since they didn't look busy at the time. \n\nLooking from outside, I saw a few old people and 1 young couple. I looked Cesarios on yelp and I wondered why it only had 3 stars in total. I was shy/hesitant to go in because it looked high class but I thought just give it a try. \n\nWe walked in and immediately an elderly mannered man greeted us happily and sat us down. I was very pleased. One of the waitress who didn't seem to know much English smiled happily and asked if we wanted water.\n\nAnyway getting to the point, our waitress was very nice and friendly but it seemed like she didn't know much about the appetizers and entrees. I asked her what was their popular appetizer and she told me the bruschetta. I asked more about it because I really didn't know but she didn't really explain. I asked her about the clams and she told me it was really good. I just went with my instincts and I ordered the clams. My bf ordered his favorite carbonara and I ordered my meat lasagna. \n\nOur appetizers, clams and soup of the day arrived at a good time. I liked their soup but after awhile it tasted like too much flour. The clams tasted ok at first but the sauce made it taste a little bitter. When our entrees arrived, it looked really delicious! I loved how it was nicely plated. I dug into my meat lasagna and the crusty cheese on top was really good. As I started to eat the middle part, I didn't like it. I don't really know exactly how lasagnas are made but this tasted like it was pre-made and then cooked or something. I don't know?!  The texture was hard and it just didn't taste right. I was a little disappointed. I didn't want to be mean so I didn't say anything. I took only a few bites. His carbonara was not bad. The sauce was pretty good but again heavy/floury taste. The bacon was salty. His was better than mine. Decent price but the food isn't as good as it looks.\n\nI was going to give a 2 star but because staff was very accommodating, respectful, nice and friendly, 3 stars will do.\n\nI would really love to come back after they make changes to the food :)", "author": "Sharmaine M."}

While wondering around after a few drinks at Bobs bar we were looking for somewhere to have dinner. We found the place right next to the Marine memorial club. It was Cesarios. At about 4 or so there was only two people in there but we decided to look at the menu anyhow. It looked promising. So we went in. I had the baked halibut and the wife had the chicken Marsala. I was very happy with both the taste and the portion size of my entree. The wife liked hers as well. The bread wasn't sourdough but was more like a Portuguese sweet bread. The dipping sauce was pesto in olive oil. It wasn't what I expected but was very good. We both had dessert. So 2 entrees, 2 cocktails, 2 desserts and coffee with tax came to less than $85.

The man taking my order on the phone was horribly rude but I thought once I went down to pick the food up it would be fine. I went down and there was a woman there who gave us the check but completely ignored making eye contact or greeting us. My husband tried to joke about eating the cheesecake on the counter and she rolled her eyes. We got our food and went up to the room. The mussels and clams were bland and tasted  fishy. I love mussles, I can rarely say that I have had bad ones. The pasta we got was absolutely awful. Plain pasta noodles with generic tomato sauce. It literally tasted like tomato sauce out of the can without seasoning. No garlic, no salt, no pepper. Nothing. So disappointed. From the service to the food.", "author": "D T."}

The waitresses were very helpful and efficient in taking our order and explaining the menu. The environment was warm and fun with lots of Christmas lights and pictures on the wall. The food is not at all bland as some other reviewers claim if you want classic Italian food. We had clam chowder. Then spaghetti and meatballs- a large portion split between my daughter and I which was very good.  My husband had ravioli Florentine which was much more delicious.

If i dislike the service or food from a certain place i simply don't ever go there again. However, today i had one of the worst experience that I've ever had in my life when it comes to dining at Cesarios Restaurant. I decided to invite my best friend out for dinner as a birthday celebration which was a complete failure due to the customer service we received. We arrived at the place and the waitress did greet us and asked how many of us were to dine in. We told her it was 2 of us and she said there were no tables at that time but the wait time was about 15 min. We agreed to wait as we were the only party waiting for a table at that time. Minutes later a couple (two American  women) arrived and the manager seated them immediately although we were still waiting and they had no reservation. Then again another couple who looked American arrrived to the place and the manager managed to seat them before us too although they had no reservation either. It was then when i decided to question the waitress and told her that we had arrived first and how come we have not been seated yet. Her response was that they both had reservation and then thats what got me pissed and i  told her that i was standing by their side and had heard that neither of them had reservations. Then she responded that it was her manager who was sitting the people and she didnt know what he was doing! Then the manager came and i told him that we had been waiting  to be seated and his ignorant response was \" I'm sorry they were seated because they  are regular customers\"    are you kidding me?? So no one else but the regulars have preference. Honestly, this has been one the worst places i ever have even dine in. And the manager is one of the rudest persons i have ever encountered in my while life. My advise is if you dont want to be  targeted as a nonworthy customer, then dont dine here because everyone that works here especially the manager is RACIST.", "author": "Manuela R."}

Let me first say we did not have reservations and got the last available table. I personally  find the bread served with meals to indicate the quality of food to follow. The Italian bread did not fit my standards;  it was not crusty and was over processed. We had a fried calamari appetizer and it was ok-nothing special with canned artichokes and a clump of wilted, undressed mixed greens. We were seated next to the kitchen and smelled someone cleaning something in the kitchen area--instead of an aroma of garlic and olive oil, we smelled Clorox---not appetizing!  I ordered penne melanzane --penne was perfectly done to al dente but sauce was sweet. We also had pasta carbonara which was  too creamy, bacon instead of pancetta (although menu did say bacon) and cheese used was not the Romano cheese I know.

We picked Cesario's because it was the only place nearby, but it looked really cute and we've walked by it a few times since we both worked downtown.\n\nThe waitress who I guess was Russian, was actually really nice and attentive to the both of us. She suggested a nice white wine for my boyfriend that was too sweet for me, but he thought it was tasty. She kept refilling my water cup and playfully asking why I didn't want to drink any wine! It was an awkward exchange, but I think she was just trying to make pleasantries throughout the night.\n\nI ordered the Linguine Smoked Chicken and it was really delicious. It's hard for me to finish a whole plate of food usually, but in this case I like... devoured everything. Boyfriend got the \"Gambretthi\" or something like that, which had some yummy tiger prawns and a creamy white sauce.

I can't remember the name of the dish my friend ordered but it was spaghetti noodles with sun-dried tomatoes and shrimp in a \"light cream sauce.\"\n\nThe polenta alone took 20 minutes to come. Very annoying. And four pieces for $7? Ugh, I was expecting more. Oh well. It was too hot and burned my tongue but once I let it cool down, it was pretty standard fare.\n\nAnother 10 minutes and our food was there. My chicken parmesan was the best I'd ever had, to be perfectly honest. Good consistency for the meat and the marinara sauce was just right in terms of flavor. Vegetables were steamed well. One thing that was strange was that my mashed potatoes were under my chicken--what? Oh well.\n\nService was kinda hands-off--our waitress didn't come by to ask how we were doing at all. She was pleasant though, and the place was busy, so it's not a big deal.\n\nFor two dishes and an appetizer we were set back $55. I guess that's standard for a place that advertises itself as having \"fine foods.\"\n\nSure, the food was good, but the service didn't live up to my expectations.

I'm not a fan of salt, so this place was good in my salt meter.  Some days you just want a big bowl of pasta, so this is the place to have one.  The service was slow in the beginning, only because there are only two waitresses in the whole place.  Can't fault them for that.  They were attentive and came back to ask if we needed any and water was filled.  If you have a big party, make a reservation or else be patient in waiting.  Such a small place doesn't make you want to stay too long.  I'm amazed that they put a table right next to the door (that's how cramped they are), but you just get really good Italian food!

We found something good and headed that way, figuring we'd be OK without reservations on a rainy Saturday night.  Wrong, there was a long wait.  They suggested the hotel concierge could assist, he recommended another Italian restaurant.  Alas we didn't Yelp...\n\nIn stark contrast to the first restaurant, Cesario's was not even half full.  We soon found out why.  We ordered beef carpaccio and two fish entrees.   We waited and waited.  Finally the two fish dishes arrive.  We asked about the carpaccio.  It was another server, she said she didn't know about it.  We said, it's fine, we'll just skip it.\n\nThe seared swordfish was incredibly overcooked, the salmon was also overcooked but not quite as badly.  The waiter did not come back to check on us, no one did.  After a while I decided to try and eat the swordfish as I was really hungry.  Still not once did anyone come by.  After eating the vegetables and the thicker parts of the fish, which was difficult as it was cut very thin (1/4\" or so - I'm not exaggerating) I stopped.   Someone finally did come by to ask if I wanted a box!  \n\nI said I didn't want a box, I wanted to see the manager.  We waited and waited.  Finally he came over, it was the man who had taken our order.  He apologized about the missing carpaccio.  We said that was fine, accidents happen, but the swordfish was way overcooked.  He said we should have said something, I said you didn't come back and no one else checked on us and we were hungry.  He said that  he manages two other restaurants and had to leave.\n\nHe then made a big deal about not charging us for the carpaccio.  How generous not to charge us for food we hadn't been served!  I said that was not the issue, the overcooked food and poor service was.  As someone who greatly values both I was quite offended that he wasn't concerned about our dining experience. \n\nSadly, it was only when I mentioned that we weren't tourists, we were locals and it was important to do a Yelp review that he seemed to care at all.  Then he offered to take the swordfish off the check. \n\nI see that Cesario's has a three star rating on Yelp which is generous.  I just looked up the other restaurant  he went to check on Persimmon and I see it has two and a half stars, that's probably generous too.", "author": "Kara H."}

All I can say is that I have been here a few times now and just appreciate everything about it. The location, the neighborhood feel, the friendly staff, and of course the consistently good food.

Unfortunately we didn't do our research ahead of time and kind of got lost a bit looking for parking and ended up in the Union Square area. After looking on yelp for some close by restaurants since by then we were starving, we ended up here at Cesario's. \n\nOur reception and service here was very cold first of all. I think our waitress never did crack a smile and neither did the host. The waitress was efficient but not welcoming. I felt like I was intruding in the restaurant even though I was there to give them patronage. Super weird. At one point we removed a huge candlestick in the middle of our table since we couldn't see each other when we were talking, and the host came back a few minutes later noticing it was moved and without saying anything or asking us if it bothered us, he just moved it back. \n\nThe food was tasty and satisfied our carb craving at the time. Albeit a bit pricey, we came in here knowing that we would probably be forking over more money for the location of the restaurant than for the price of the actual food, and of course we were right. \n\nWon't be back even if we end up lost in Union Square again. God willing next time we will plan our city adventure better and look up where to eat ahead of time.", "author": "Saliha B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-10", "description": "The decor was extremely nice, a throwback to Sinatra's time.  The maitre d was polite and seated hubby and I quickly.  The waitress was quite efficient, but put in the wrong order for hubby simply because I'd asked him if he didn't really want that.\n\nUsually, you can tell a good Italian restaurant by its bread.  And, while not bad, this was grocery store cheap bread.  In a city renowned for its bread, this in and of itself is almost unforgivable.  But even worse, the bread was served with butter, not seasoned oil as is also customary in good Italian restaurants.\n\nOur calamari was both a bit rubbery and undercooked.  But the homemade \"tarter\" sauce was quite good (and doubled as a salad dressing for the assorted greens that came as a garnish).  The breading seemed fine, crispy and not overly salty.\n\nNow I'm not an Olive Garden person.  In fact, I flatly refuse to go to one.  And there are extremely few Italian restaurants even in the Seattle area that I will go to.  Still, it's also hard to compare to Grazie, a fantastic Italian restaurant not only in Tukwila, but in a strip mall in Tukwila!  But in a city like San Fran with a big Italian population, I really thought it'd be gotten right.\n\nSo I actually really loved my meat lasagna which also had spinach in it and was served with the subtly but nicely flavored veggies, apparently cooked in white wine.  But hubby said it was like a giant ball of cheese.  And his frutti di mare, which, despite my dislike of most types of seafood (apparently with squid one of the exceptions), I thought had a delectable finely tuned sauce, albeit as thin as soup, which sat upon the linguine like a fine watercolor, each color distinguished from the other, but subtly blended together.  In a bowl worthy of a large serving of pho.  Hubby, while he did like it, did not like the soupy sauce; it pretty much ruined it for him.\n\nLastly, the cheesecake, served with strawberries, whip cream, and drizzles of chocolate, was good.  Not great.  But good.\n\nBut, really for these prices, I can't in good conscience highly recommend this place.  Tourists, venture out away from this neighborhood, disregard the 10% savings (which is at least what one hotel provides for its guests).", "author": "C B."}

When our server came back we ordered a variety of appetizers and entries. Everything was delicious, seasoned great, and just the right portion size. Now when our bill came it was almost  $200. So my friend and I split it, and he said \"let me leave the tip.\" As he makes way more than I do. So I agreed. I drew a smiley face on the tip line, as I had a wonderful experience. Now the BAD!!! And this will be the only reason I am writing this review. I checked my bank statement while I was on vacation, and I noticed that who ever closed my ticket, added a $27 dollar tip to my half of the bill. So then I called on my vacation, talked to some who took down my name, number, credit card info, and a quick note of the incident. With no response within two days to fix the problem, prompted me to warn others. Be careful eating here, because they will obviously tip them selves whatever they feel they want.

We even had Gwyneth tell the cook that this was the best Chicken Parm evah!! \n\nIf you're looking for a full-bar they don't have it, just beer and wine.

I loved the dressing, but the waitress should have mentioned the size.\n\nThe veal was excellent, with a balanced flavor of wine and lemon.  My compliments to the chef!  It was served with a wedge of very flavorful polenta and steamed veggies.\n\nThe only drawback was the limited selection of wine by the glass.  Since I was by myself, there was no way I could drink a whole bottle for dinner then function the next day.\n\nPrice wise, it was moderate.

They were out of garlic? Yes, an Italian restaurant that ran out of garlic. Even the aforementioned waitress was surprised by this fact. \n\nSo she brings out the wine and in true fine dining fashion, pours a taste in my glass for my approval, and then pours us both glasses. I love that. The food came out in a timely manner, and my gnocchi was delicious. Given I have never had gnocchi before, but I loved it. It was even missing the garlic so I could only imagine how much better it could have been. She enjoyed her ravioli dish, I tried a bite and it was pretty good but I loved mine so much more. We finished, and she tried her best to sell us on some dessert but we had to pass, drinking had to be done.\n\nAll in all it was rather expensive but I do suppose it is a tourist attraction more than a local spot.

I don't really know but the salad (again, looked like a side dish to my meal, not an additional $8.50 plus tax) was small and when i went to eat it, it had a very unnatural and un-ceasar salad like oily coating all over it.

It didn't have an overwhelming truffle flavor and I liked that the Gnocchi was stuffed and the cream sauce it was served with wasn't too creamy. I wish there were some more greens with the dish, as Gnocchi can taste pretty rich without something to cut that flavor. The Chicken Marsala was very unimpressive. It was bland and lacking in flavor. It came with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes which were also lacking in flavor. So I think this place is a toss-up. My guess is that the pasta dishes are pretty decent but the other dishes should probably be avoided.", "author": "Priyam D."}

Well-situated spot to leer at tourists, derelicts, and old-school sf washed-up elite milling around on the street (sutter @ mason).", "author": "Scott C."}

I was promptly seated and given a menu, but it took another 10 minutes before my order was taken because 6 - 8 couples came in after that and the waiter seated each of them and gave them their menus before he came back to me.   I had a Chicken, Pear, Gorgonzola salad which was good.   I didn't like that it included tomato as the taste, in my opinion, doesn't go with the rest of the ingredients in that salad.   I also had a side dish of angle hair pasta with pesto.  I didn't think it was going to taste good because it was not very green in color (thinking not enough pesto) but surprisingly it was very good.  It had a pesto-cheesey-garlic flavor as I recall.  The server never brought my check so I got up and paid at 1 p.m. and walked back to the hotel next door.  I was late for my class after having an hour for lunch and going to the restaurant next door.  That was disappointing.   The restaurant is located at the corner of Sutter and Mason next to the Marine's Memorial.  I thought it was okay and would try it again.", "author": "Debra G."}

The place looked alright, I mean, the decor could have been better, but I'm there for the food.\nTo spare you stories of me and my roomie, I will bullet point my problems with this place.\n\n- Over priced\n- The waiters were only rarely at our table and there were less then 10 people in the restaurant at the time.\n-The food was not at the level I had payed for. I mean really if I am going to pay $12 for a small salad it had better be the best salad ever.  But on the plus side, you can eat the food.\n- The food's presentation reminded me of the presentation of food I have seen in my school's cafe. If I wanted school food I would have gone to my school.\n- We got 4 slices of bread. You would think that for what I was paying they would have kept the bread coming.\n- The bread was tasteless.\n- Although not normally one to care much about ambiance, the plate my food came on was very distracting, and didn't look anything like the one that my roomie got. What did they buy the plates at Ikea?\n- Small. Now there is something to be said for cozy, but this was not cozy, this was small, and felt cramped to me.\n\nWhen I entered Cesario's I was thinking of having desert, by the time I got my dinner I couldn't wait to be done and out of there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-03", "description": "I like and recommend Cesario's, 3.8 stars.  I've been for lunch and frequenly for dinner as it's on my way home after work.  Note, they also serve breakfast.  I can tell it's a place for local/neighborhood residents.  Though near the theater district and Washington Square it's really not touristy.  Cesario's is off the beaten path of my usual, FiDi, Mission or Lower Haight stomping grounds.  Though not as exhastive as a menu like you might find in North Beach, ie- 15 different chicken dishes in every pasta and sauce combination known to man, Cesario's offers a solid selection of traditional, reliable Italian dishes.  I regularly have (descriptions are from the takeout menu): Caesar's salad (not bad but tastes a little different than other Caesers's I've had, can't explain it) $10.50!, garlic bread (good), Penne alla Bolognese $15.25 (good) and Ravioli all Florentina $14.95 (good).  I agree with previous reviewer (\"Jason D\") that they are a little pricey, $17.95 for Pollo al Marsala and $22.00 for Scalapini di vitiello al Marsala.  My guess is that the prices are aimed at tourists and loyalistas like me.  A good option is their nightly specials though not sure if the specials are nightly/weekly.  The staff know what I like and often recommend something from there.  Another thing I like is the view, two sides of the restaurant have huge windows and they are often open especially during lunch.  Gives a nice open air feel to the place, plus mild ppl watching of the neighborhood peeps.  The staff are from various countries (soothing to listen to their broken English accents) and are all very friendly and accomodating.  If you want something slightly different from a dish on the menu just ask and they'll probly make it for you.  They can accomodate larger groups but probly best to make a reservation or you may have to wait for tables to clear then put together to accomodate.  This is a good date place or for small parties of four to six, maybe parents in from out of town.  Worth a visit, just pls don't be in my regular seat when I arrive after work at 6:30pm!

I might not know that much italian, but I ordered for the dish with the eggplant in it.  I even pointed it out to the waiter/owner.  When the food came out, I got this pasta dish with spinach and mushrooms in it.  Where's the eggplant!!  I called the waiter and told him that the order is wrong.  He said, \"No, that's what you ordered.\"  I asked him to bring back the menu so I can point out the dish, and when I pointed it out to him, he pointed to the other dish and said, \"No, that's not what you ordered, this is what you ordered.\"  Don't you think that someone would have remembered what he/she ordered?  I guess eggplant and spinach is the same (vegetables I mean), but the fact that the waiter/owner did not admit he's wrong is what bothers me.  And by the way, I was nice to let this go.  When he insisted that I ordered the spinach and mushroom dish, I said, \"Ok, fine.\"  But don't expect me to be going back there again, no matter how great the food is.

Unfortunately we did not realize that Ottavo was not open for lunch on Sundays.  So, we decided to take a walk and see what presented itself to us.  Up comes Cesario's only 1/2 a block away.  It didn't look bad, nor did the menu.  It only went downhill from there.  The service was passable, but the food was far below even sub-par.  Chef Boyardee is gourmet compared to this place.  Even a basic joint like Fusio easily trumps this place.  The other Yelp reviews here certainly capture the true essence of the garbage that they serve here.  We started off with the mussels and spinach with goat cheese and red pepper salad.  The mussels were over-cooked and the broth, or lack thereof, was very salty to cover how old the mussels were.  I pratically could use them as a rubber-band sling-shot.  We snickered when we saw another guest display a look of disgust with their own mussels.  The salad was below expectations: the dressing did not mix with either the roasted red peppers or goat cheese.  The came our pasta.  Bleh!  I do better on a bad day.  I had the ravioli stuffed with ricotta in a tomato cream sauce.  My fiancee had the bolognese.  Not only was my sauce super sweet , there was nothing fresh about this dish.  The bolognese sauce had absolutely no body; the ground beef and lamb would serve better as packaging material.  We, of course, passed on dessert, and were out of that joint in a flash.

The owner appeared to be a leprechaun-like older Italian man shouting \"Ciao, Bella\" at a departing diner, giving the place some authenticity.  When we arrived around 9 p.m., the restaurant was fairly crowded, but I have a suspicion that was because it was one of the few restaurants open in the area.  The waitresses were a little awkward but very nice, and the service was fast.  I got the pasta with Gorgonzola sauce for $15 and a glass of mediocre red wine that wasn't worth the $8 it cost.  The bread and whipped butter could have been a lot better, given all the great bread they make in San Francisco.  My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak, which looked all right.  He did not give it rave reviews, but he was hungry, so he did not complain.  He did complain (to me) about the lemonade, which was not fresh.  We shared a glass of biscotti-flavored port for dessert - a nice touch.  The whole dinner cost $69 (plus tip), which wasn't bad at all.  I would recommend this place if it's a Monday night or other off-time and you're looking for a decent meal in the area, but the ambiance was just all right, so I wouldn't make a special trip to come here.", "author": "H.
