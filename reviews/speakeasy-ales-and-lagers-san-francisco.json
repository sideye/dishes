WORTH IT!\n\nFinally made the trip to Speakeasy Ales & Lagers this past Sunday and was completely blown away by the experience here. My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to take a nice bike ride out to Speakeasy to see what all the buzz was about.  Located south of the Dogpatch near the loading docks and old Piers Speakeasy is a bit off the beaten path.  Luckily, we came on an afternoon when they were holding a cool fundraiser and we were greeted at the front gates with blasting jazz music, people dressed up in 1920s style costumes, an outdoor magic show, oh and a bounce house! I was instantly hooked. From the moment we rode up the property the staff here was out of this world friendly.  The door guy greeted us and said we could safely lock up our bikes by the entrance of the brewpub and even suggested that they would be safe overnight (if we indulged in one too many). \n\nThe property of the brewpub is quite large, a massive outdoor space with picnic tables, high tops and some corn hole to keep you occupied while sipping on some great beers.  Inside, this spot has a truly authentic 'speakeasy' decor.  Dimly lit bar with old wood paneling and some mix-matched vintage chairs and couches to lounge in.  The bar itself is quite small, only about 8 seats so get there early if you want to snag a table.  The bartenders inside were incredibly friendly, immediately handing us menus, answering any questions we had about various beer styles and all chatting/having a good time at work. I always like to see bartenders that actually look like they enjoy their job and this group of guys had a smile on their face all day, joking, chatting and having small talk with all the customers in the bar during the day. \n\nFor beers we had the Vendetta IPA ($6), Blind Tiger Imperial IPA ($6), Tallulah Extra Pale Ale ($5), and Double Daddy DIPA ($5).  All were fantastic.  Speakeasy has a rotating selection of about 10+ drafts and you can purchase a handful of their limited release bottles at the tap room to take home and enjoy. Speakeasy also has a shuttle service on Friday of Giants games (with proof of ticket) you can grab some (more affordable) local beers before headed to the game in the complimentary shuttle. Also, they are part of the SF Brewers Guild Beer Shuttle - every third Wednesday the free shuttle takes you to a handful of local breweries including hosting events like meet the brew maker, etc.  A truly enjoyable experience at this gem of a tap room this weekend. Speakeasy has quickly become my new favorite brewery in the area and I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Kelsey B."}

Before that I was a naive and stupid girl who drank Heineken because that's what Asians usually bring to parties. I was not living until Big Daddy came into my life. Ever since that, Speakeasy has been my favorite brewery. \n\nSomeone took me here for my first visit as a surprise and from then, I fell more in love with the brand. The bar, though small, is quite nice to chat with new people who love the beer as well. There's awesome decor. I wouldn't really recommend this place as a \"first date\" place, save this for a few dates in. Two communal-like room or for big groups then only a few seats in the bar area, but the outdoors area is open when there's an event!\n\nI really like the option of having tasters. 5 tasters for $7 or so. Good way to taste all those beers you're on the fence about buying a 6pack/giant bottle over. \n\nThere are a few snacks you can order, I haven't tried any yet, except a sample of the pretzel once.

There was a hot dog cart if you were hungry. \n\nCame in for their Friday happy hour, dollar off (already great prices of their beer). Parking was plentiful and pretty easy. It's more in the industrial part of Bayview so you don't have to worry about any riff raff hanging out on the corner. \n\nThe taproom isn't that big and since there was a warriors game it got crowded quick. The only women there were the bartenders so it was a major d.....ude fest. I mean, I went to the only all boys high school in the city so I know how that goes. Most of my friends then were from the Mission/Vis Valley/Excelsior/Cow Palace area (not exactly the Marina) so I'm used to kinda hoodish crowds. Here the crowd just wasn't my vibe, some were even more hoodish and some.... yeah just not really my crowd. \n\nSpeakeasy is kinda in the middle of nowhere and more of a destination, you can't really barhop/pubcrawl from it but I might return to do a brewery tour or when they have live music in the summer.", "author": "Earl G."}

We rode the MUNI out to Hunter's Point from Union Square.  It's about 45 minutes by bus so if you have alternate transportation, take that.  We were dropped outside the building and walked up.  For a Saturday afternoon, the place was still empty but I imagine that's because it's in the middle of nowhere.  They have corn hole out in the parking lot if you're so inclined, and the tasting room and bar area is dimly decorated.

The entrance leads you into their Tap Room which I loved the love decor of. It has cool wallpaper, decorations, and Speakeasy elements like a sliding peep hole in the front door and a red emergency buzzer in case of a raid.

The bartender mentioned that someone called in sick, so when we asked where we should go for the tour, it was news to him that there was even a tour. He ended up leading it and it started quite a bit late, which he said was usual since most people don't arrive on time. \n\nThey have Happy Hour on weekdays from 4-6 pm with $3 pints for their flagship beers. They also have some of their seasonal and specialty brews on the menu. \n\nYou can bring your beer on the tour and you'll see the staff all have a beer in their hand while working.

There are a few semi-private tables where you can enjoy a beer with your lovah, or a group of friends.  There is also a nice bar area where you can chat with the friendly and knowledgeable bartenders.  A lot of the pictures here on Yelp are from before the remodel.  It no longer has the \"industrial\" look that appears in the photos.  \n\nDespite what people say, I don't think it is hard to get to at all.  There is a bus stop across the street, and the muni station is only .5 miles down the road.  I didn't feel unsafe walking around in the area at all.  Plus, there is plenty of parking (if you actually own a car in SF).\n\nThe beers are all good, but I didn't think any were a stand-out great beer.  They are all something I would drink if available, but not something I would seek-out. \n\nMake sure to check the website for the hours before you go, they are only open limited hours- mostly in the afternoon/early evening.

A lot of what I picked up was because I arrived early & stayed well after the Yelp party was over.\n\nGetting in early, I went to their taproom. Decked out in deep rich wood accents, this is the type of taproom that Ron Burgundy would admire. With a few featured beers being on $3 Happy Hour special, it was a place my wallet took a liking to as well.\n\nAfter the Yelp event in their brewhouse, which makes a fine event space, I ended up talking to some longtime regulars of Speakeasy. It seems the handsome taproom is relatively new & part of recent expansion. Growth can be good.\n\nThe regulars also reminisced of a simpler Speakeasy where taps were only in the brewhouse & how there was a token system for getting beers to drink. The beers were cheaper back then too. Growth can have some growing pains.\n\nFrom the stories of back then to what I experienced of the now, I think Speakeasy is heading in a good direction. Ideally, they add some kind of permanent on-site food option (it's OK to bring your own food) while keeping the $3 Happy Hour beers.", "author": "John M."}

They have a nice selection of several different beer varieties, but in my view the strengths are the IPAs (the big West Coast thing these days) and the dark beers. My personal favorite was the chocolate milk stout, but all were excellent.\n\nBest of all, we were there in the middle of the day, and happy hour is $1 off all beers from 1-5pm Tue-Fri, which makes it an exceptional deal.\n\nMaybe next time I go I'll take home some 22 oz bottles or a growler, because the beers are seriously good and most of the groceries around only have a small selection.\n\nDefinitely check it out.", "author": "Brent W."}

So as an east bay resident, I've wanted to check out Speakeasy for sometime now...but for one reason or another (ahem, bart fire, cough) I have been halted in the process to make it there.  I was poking around on the speakeasy website (which, btw, is goodbeer.com .  AWESOME!), and saw that they were hosting their upcoming 16th annual blockparty.  Sat Sep7, 1-6pm, $35 unlimited pours...well that there is a no-brainer, but add in live music and food trucks? Sold.\n\nWe found out you could buy tickets at the door (good to know next year) and that they were in no way going to sell out of GA tickets (VIP admission however had sold out.)  So anyway, we parked in the shade nearby a little after 1pm and saw that there was a line to get in.  Hubby was none too pleased, he hates a line.  so we got in line and it didn't take too long to get in, so no big deal.  One dude checking IDs and distributing bracelets, it was all pretty smooth.  Also, if you do bring kids, they will charge a Designated Driver type price/fee, which is kinda bogus but I guess keeps the adults partying and kiddies at home :)\n\nSo we get our tickets scanned, a second wrist band (weird), and our 6oz tasting glass.  They were super cute glasses with the 16th annual block party logo plastered on it.  We would be on the hunt for leftovers later!  Got in and went straight for a beer tent...they had 3 total, some with different offerings than its counterparts.  New beers I hadn't tried in the past were... Buthertown Blake Ale (Black IPA):, Witness (witbier), a new SFBG Common (lager), Double Daddy Imperial IPA, Big Daddy Wet Hopped (IPA), and a Tellulah Extra Pale Ale.  The old standby's that were yummy were their Payback Porter, Prohibition Amber, and Big Daddy IPA.  No stout, and their Vendetta Red is coming out mid-Oct, yay! \n\nWhat a glorious day, 5 hours of drinking enjoyment (last call was shouted around 5:40pm).  The only complaint would maybe be the length of the beer lines...thankfully they moved super quick, yay.  The tap room was awesome as they had it setup for live music that penetrated (yeaaah) the entire brewery/parking lot.  Lines for the porta potty as well, but also moved quick.  It was a warm September afternoon in SF, but at hunter's point it was breezy and pockets of shade to help get you through the hot afternoon.  But by 5:30pm it rapidly cooled off and it was so wonderful.  They also had some really cool schwag/merch to purchase so that was cool.  Water for everyone to keep hydrate is always appreciated.  4 food truck/tents to choose from, but nothing really stood out.\n\nSpeakeasy, you'll see me next year...but hopefully much sooner and more often now!", "author": "Sara W."}

I prefer to keep it discrete. This was a whole other thing, though. Molly was probably the naturally nicest bartender I've ever met. She helped us through the beer problem, too.

I like their beers, especially the Big Daddy IPA and the Scarface Imperial Stout.\n\nGayle later posted an outside picture of me on Facebook with the following comment: \"Naturally, we are the oldest people here. Waaaay oldest!\" Not entirely, although maybe my relative impatience with beer lines might be age related. Plus Yelp crowds are always fun, and I enjoy the conversations, whether I've met folks previously or not. It's also enjoyable to have Gayle with me, as my writings often put her in an \"famous\" light for those who read my reviews. \n\nThe Speakeasy facilities are a little funky out in this light industrial part of town. And all during my visit, I kept putting on my professional hat and wondering how these guys do when the Fire Marshall or Cal-OSHA show up. It's definitely a labour of love here, the quality of the product speaks for itself, and after Gayle made me zip my compliance comments, I decided that their safety commitment was just fine.\n\nThe first 8 ounces (or so) was free, and maybe in hindsight we should have gone to the pay line and cut the suspense short. The color ticket system for the Brewery Tour was also a little confusing, although we enjoyed the table where the various hops and grains were on tactile display and tasting. Also available were related goods for sale, and a food stand with some decent looking BBQ. Speakeasy was also smart to provide some Security as a couple hundred young adults and beer don't always mix together smoothly. We found everyone working the event to be friendly and helpful.\n\nAll in All, it was a pleasant event and well worth the drive over from the East Bay. Many thanks to Jessica and Ruggy for making this event possible and to Speakeasy for opening their doors and their kegs for many of us to sample and enjoy.", "author": "Eric B."}

Loved the vibe of the bar- dark, a couple rooms with tables for larger groups, fun decor. There was a solid group there that day, but not so crazy that you couldn't sit or easily get a beer. The 4 of us each got a beer and we headed outside to enjoy the weather and grab a barrel table. After 15 minutes it was time for our tour. We were with a guy that was doing just his 2nd tour ever. He was a fun, laid back guy. Sometimes he wasn't super confident about what he was telling us, but he'll get better with each tour he gives! It was neat to see their facility and we were able to grab a couple empty cans to take with us. After that, we had 2 tastings (a stout and an amber) and we were done! We grabbed another beer and a picnic table and stayed a while. They had a DJ out there and some corn hole sets. Overall, a nice way to spend a couple hours on a Saturday!\n\nOH, they also had a BBQ place there selling chicken, pork & ribs.

The bartenders were warm and even gifting us 4 oz tasters so that we could toast and sing \"happy birthday\" to the 3 birthday folk.

We arrived around 4pm and stayed until about 830pm-9pm. The area is safe as it's located in an industrial part of HP. I appreciated that they had their own parking lot, which is convenient. It's pretty easy to locate and the outside is clean and the landscaping is well taken care of.\n\nGeneral Info: The bar itself does not sell food, but there was a food vendor outside. People are welcome to bring in the food and eat inside. The d\u00e9cor matches the image of the beer-dark, mysterious, yet comfortable. They have a couple nice nooks and benches to be more intimate. The ambiance is casual and the crowd is laid back. The restrooms were clean the entire night and the bartenders used clean towels. The bar itself was also very clean, which is important to me personally. \n\nThe customer service: The bartenders were super friendly! They enjoy their job and engage in conversations with customers. They do not get stuck in one conversation and ignore other customers completely. They were very attentive-clearing glasses, checking in, and describing the beer and brewery. They were knowledgeable, but not arrogant. \n\nLast but not least: THE BEER. My group and I tried every single one on tap through flights. They were all delicious and aromatic! I am not a beer guru of any form, but I know what I like. My favorite has to be the Prohibition Ale. It was soft, yet flavorful. I also enjoyed their Tallulah Seasonal brew. Their beer is delicious and they have something everyone can enjoy. \nIn closing: If you like supporting San Francisco, enjoy craft beer, and are looking for a laid back ambiance-this is a great choice!", "author": "Natali R."}

Possibly outside of Portland and San Diego, there are more delectable suds flowing from our little slice of California than just about any other part of the world. And while most of the local beers you'll find on tap are coming from places in the Russian River and other surrounding areas, Speakeasy is one of **8 breweries doing the deed right here in our own backyard, and they might be one of the best of the bunch to boot. \n\n**The others are Magnolia, Beach Chalet, Gordon Biersch, Anchor Steam, Social Kitchen & Brewery, 21st Amendment, and Thirsty Bear... just in case you're curious. \n\nTell me a brewery with more refreshing libations, and I'll treat you to a swift kick in the rear to get you out of my face. Their libations taste like 1,000 John Tesh's have arrived on my palate to serenade my soul. Some of the standouts include their black IPA, their signature Prohibition ale, and a whole host of delicious special releases that always prove to be winners.\n\nAt the actual brewery itself, they just started doing a series of Friday night parties where you can head down to Lo-Do (new microhood you're hearing here first...

I've been there a few times over the past year and always had a great time. The bartenders are nice, and the \"Medicine Cabinet\" is always stocked. You can get bombers and growlers - the growlers are especially convenient for those limited edition beers on tap that you can't otherwise get. Though they don't have food on-site, they have a food truck schedule on their beer menu, for those of us who like to snack when we drink. However, if you're there during the week, be sure to grab a burrito or something in the Mission on your way out there! Otherwise, you'll be SOL.\n\nI'm not giving it 5 stars because of its location and my latest experience there. It's in Bayview, in a spot that feels like it's in the middle of nowhere. Getting there by bike is somewhat of a chore, and I can't even imagine having to take public transit there. For those of you with cars, it's no big deal. \n\nI went this past week with a friend for a couple of drinks. Normally, the bartenders call \"last call\" well before they close, but they didn't this time around. I couldn't recall if they closed at 8 or 9 on weeknights, and since my friend was able to order us each a beer at 7:45, I assumed they closed at 9. I was wrong. At exactly 8 p.m on the nose, the bartender started making comments about us leaving and them closing. I was forced to basically chug an almost-full beer (with help from my friend) and scoot out the door before the bartender literally pulled the stools out from under us.

Their happy hour is such an incredible secret! Every Friday, 4-9, $3 tokens to get a 12 or 16 oz pour (depending on ABV) of one of the approximately 8 selections they have on tap. There's food available, but why waste valuable belly space on food when you can drink delicious beer? I tried the Butchertown Black and the Prohibition Ale, both excellent and quite strong. I also sampled the red ale (I forget the name but it was excellent) and the Betrayal (free!) upon the urging of the President/CEO, Forest.\n\nBut the beer's not the only great thing. Everyone in attendance - company employees and the varied crowd - was extremely nice, very open, and fun to talk to. There was a real sense of community and pride in the operation.

Visiting the brewery it was nice to see that I could enjoy the old favorites as well as some new exclusives.  The Butchertown Black is a limited black ale that drinks like a hoppy stout.  The Sutro Stout was addicting and flavorful.  The Vendetta, an IPA brewed with orange, was also incredibly enjoyable.  \n\nYou know you're getting quality beer when you come here so let's look at the other facets.  The vibe is chill and laid back.  People from professionals to families to people just looking to start the weekend right are here enjoying suds.

(I don't need anymore random beer glasses!)\n- Unsuspecting location and very casual. \n- Indoor, real bathrooms. \n- White Lightening beer. \n- 4505 Chicharones are sold here sometimes!\n- It's every week, not just one a month! \n\nMy biggest gripe:\n- There aren't any signs with names and descriptions about the beer. There are some special taps that the guys pouring the beer could be better about talking about. They just expect you to know what you want.", "author": "Rachelle T."}

People were nice; one great thing about SF (as opposed to the south bay) is that there's all kinds of people at every event. The beer was new, refreshing and relatively cheap.\n\nSo $10 for a Speakeasy pint glass and two beers? That's pretty good. I tried the White Lightning and Prohibition first. Both were good. Tried some Big Daddy (hoppier than I like, but I'm not an IPA person) and whatever the porter is called, and both had distinct, refreshing flavors. The bartenders were helpful and very patient.\n\nDid I mention the free popcorn? How about the random stand selling mexican snacks?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-15", "description": "The legend of the infamous Speakeasy Brewery Friday Happy Hour from 4-8pm had been on my brain for a while.  This event promised to be the stuff legends were made of.  \n\nImages of cherubim fountains spewing streams of beer and joyous folk diving headfirst into frothy pools of ale and lager billowed through my mind.  I fancied myself sipping a pint whilst comfortably lounging on a fluffy cloud of wort.  \n\nPerhaps it was the delicious pint of Hunters Point Porter that I drank the night before at Broken Record still coursing through my veins, but on this particular Friday the draw of Speakeasy was unavoidable.  My future existence in the world was contingent upon it.  When I woke up in the morning, I knew that today would be the day myth would become reality.\n\nAfter kidnapping workaholic Lauren Y., tying her up with duct tape, and shoving her into the hatchback of my PT Cruiser (with the help of Brooke G.), I started driving furiously toward Hunter's Point.  Successfully dodging a number of lovely Bayview gentlemen driving \"cars\" with busted out windows, licking their lips and honking at us all the way down Evans, we pulled up to the Speakeasy warehouse around 5:00pm.  Greeted by the creepy Speakeasy eyes and the glorious stench of beer and cardboard wafting through the air, we walked through the door and saw beer boxes and kegs as far as the eye could see.  \n\n                                        :::queue angelic hymn::: \n\nThe signature happy hour special is 3 pints + 1 pint glass for $10.  Sweet deal!  If you're a lightweight, you don't have to drink all of the pints that same day.  The bartender administers casino chips that can be redeemed for your choice of brew anytime.  Also, for you lightweights, they have a popcorn machine so you can put a little something in your stomach if you opt for the Double Daddy (double hops, double malt, 9.5% ABV) and feel yourself getting a little tipsy. (*cough*Lauren Y.*cough*)\n\nThe atmosphere was so refreshingly casual - you're free to roam around the warehouse, chill at the bar, go outside, whatever - and everyone was hanging out, enjoying some GREAT beers, and chatting.\n\nBesides the really phenomenal brews (I was VERY impressed by the complex, strong flavors, high alcohol content, and well-balanced taste), the highlight of the whole visit was something that could only happen to four 20-something girls drinking pints of porter.  Amen to that! Some guys also frequenting the happy hour invited us for a ride on their Burning Man, chick magnet, 4-seater bike/surrey/contraption/definitely-not-street-legal (even if we were sober) \"vehicle,\" complete with chain-link cup holders.  While dodging buses, laughing hysterically, and pedaling as fast as my legs could handle with my two best friends and a beer close at hand, I thought to myself \"How could my life get any better than this?\"\n\nBig thanks to the stellar brewmasters at Speakeasy.  I'd also like to thank the geeky LARPer engineer who built the \"contraption,\" his hippie Seth Rogan look-a-like friend, and the creepy old guy with the double-pierced ears.", "author": "Erin L."}

I didn't know about the Ken Burns documentary. I just wanted people to think I watch PBS. I was really just looking for a place to hang out on a Friday with some good beer. Luckily, Friday nights at Speakeasy Brewery fits that description. On Friday afternoons starting at 4pm until 9pm, Speakeasy Ales & Lagers opens its doors to the public to enjoy their beers. We didn't get there early enough for the tour, but the warehouse looks pretty small, so I imagine that the tour is fairly short. \n\nSo we showed up around 7pm and the place was packed! Parking in the lot was full, but there's plenty of street parking around there. Look for their trademark neon eyes staring down at you, daring you to order a Bud Light. Don't be confused. You'll be drinking in the warehouse. Nothing fancy. You walk in and buy some tokens for the beer. $3/token for a 12-16oz pour, or for $10, you get a Speakeasy pint glass and 2 tokens. I personally loved the pint glasses. They also have plenty of branded clothes to take home as a souvenir. Trade in the tokens to try out some of their brews like Prohibition Ale or Big Daddy IPA. They also had a few of their lesser known beers like the Double Daddy and White Lightning. I would have liked to have tried some of their specialty brews, though.  In terms of food pairings, they have a popcorn machine popping out batches of buttery popcorn and a small stand selling Mexican food (flautas and stuff?). Popcorn's free (woot!), Mexican food is not.\n\nThe crowd is surprisingly mixed. More kids than I expected, but you got your after-work 9-5ers, saggy pants Giants fans, skinny jean hipsters, and possibly local SF City College kids. All milling about on the brewery floor. A few tables and chairs are spread out, but most people are standing. I would say it's a cool place to hang out with a group of friends who are into the Speakeasy beers, maybe not so much for meeting that special someone. \n\nPassword not necessary to gain entry into this Speakeasy, but you'll need an ID.", "author": "Saunders C."}

Make sure you've got plenty of time to grab a pint and then get in on the 4pm tour where you can learn how they make all of their oh-so-wonderful beers.

Wander the eclectic crowd...have some interesting conversations. \n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you get kicked out at 8pm.

In that way it's cool - you can show up on a Friday and get to drink all the beer you want for $3 a pint (or 2 for $10 plus a free pint glass). \n\nI liked their probation and brown sugga beers, and my girlfriend loved their IPA and Double IPA (big daddy and double daddy). They only have about 10 or so beers at any time, since it's a smaller place, but they really cover the different kinds of beer and the different flavors. Most breweries I go to have a lot of the same type of beer, and focus on doing what they do. If you don't like that kind of beer, you won't like the brand. But Speak Easy doesn't do that - from their IPA's to their Wheat to the Brown Sugga, they run the beer gambit and do a pretty good job at it.\n\nIf you have never been and are a beer purest, I think you would enjoy checking out their brewery on Friday nights.

Yes, you can walk around on your own and check out the bags of mystery ingredients (diatomaceous earth?) and the whiteboard keeping track of how much beer they made this week (now that's the job for me).\n\nAt the bar they had the usual beers for $2.50 a pint, plus the \"Street Sweeper\", a brewery-only, 10.5% ABV wheat beer that's really more of a barley wine.  As I was the DD, unfortunately I had to stop drinking after just one of those babies.  You can also just pick up any of the cases of beer laying around and buy it.  Oh, and there's also free popcorn, chips & salsa.  When the salsa bowl ran dry, we had the following exchange:\n\nMe: \"Hey, you guys got any more salsa?\"\nBartender: \"Yeah, there's a big jar of it in the fridge in the office over there.\"\n\nSo, I get to go into the office and fetch the salsa.

Do not show up to this place expecting an actual eating/drinking establishment. This is a warehouse. With beer. With people who make beer. WIth people who enjoy drinking beer. With people who enjoy standing in warehouses drinking beer. Dress accordingly.\n\n2. Brush up on your washer playing skills. Hint to the uninformed: Much like the game of horseshoes, but with washers. Rules can be amazingly complicated for such a basic game.\n\n3. Brush up on your aim with said washers, as when thrown while drinking $2.50 microbrews, the pitch can be a bit wild and dangerous.\n\n4. Dogs like to chase washers because they are playful and excited about running around in a warehouse. Bring some sort of treat for the dogs to entice them to return the washers so you don't look like a complete ass in front of your date when chasing these playful suckers around the warehouse to retrieve your washer.\n\n5. Enlist the aid of a designated driver. When delicous beer is $2.50 and there are happy people, dates and dogs you can get carried away.\n\n6. Bring some type of food. Popcorn provided, but really, how impressed would your date be if you randomly pulled out some spectacular cupcakes that you baked specifically for the beer drinking occassion. Nothing says \"let's get it on later\" like beer and cupcakes, am I right?", "author": "Elissa D."}

As much as I love the current lineup of bottled beers: Big Daddy IPA, Prohibition Ale, Double Daddy Imperial IPA and the Untouchable Pale Ale (and the elusive Godfather Barleywine), it's the keg-only and the dearly departed brews that made this brewery tops in my book.\r\n\r\nKeg Only:\r\nThe Bootlegger Black Lager holds up to the classic Sapporo Black and the archetype of the style: Kostritzer Schwartzbier. Malty and a little sweet, but also refreshing. There's a reason they're commonly called black pilsners.\r\n\r\nThe Shylock Maibock is also a great example of a German spring bock beer. Strong but balanced with a sweet malty character.\r\n\r\nEven the Satchmo Stout, which should be bottled as there is a real lack of good local stouts, is a fantastic beer... nice and roasty and proof that stouts can aspire to be more than a Guinness.\r\n\r\nHowever, the three best, most unique beers are ones that are unfortunately not being made any more.\r\n\r\nWhite Lightning - their attempt at a berliner weisse, a sour beer that had undergone lactic fermentation. Even though it was a pain to produce and a bigger pain to clean out of the tanks and pipes, it was an amazing beer when stored and served properly (the trick was to make sure some live yeast made it into the glass like with a Belgian beer)\r\n\r\nCommon Beer - The San Francisco Common Beer was quite possibly the best beer produced on the west coast when it came to pairing with food, and it's a shame that restaurants all throughout the Bay Area didn't stock it. Maybe it was the name, or maybe the restaurant industry lacked the vision to pair a domestic beer with food the way they do now with Belgian brews. Either way, it is sorely missed.\r\n\r\nFinally, the best of the bunch: Untouchable Lager - a perfect Maerzen beer, and possibly the best California-made lager I have ever had. This beer was fantastic, but unfortunately suffered in sales because the local market is biased towards ales.\r\n\r\nThe city is much better for having Speakeasy supplying its bars with fresh, local brew.", "author": "Avery G."}

A pint of one of their flavorful ales or lagers is a cheap $2.50. And if you dare to drink Double Daddy's all night (or day since happy is from 4-8) then prepare to spend only about $5-$10 to get wasted. \n\nI've never had a dull time at the Speakeasy but keep in mind, it's just a warehouse with a bunch of packaged kegs.

Avoid the happy hour crowd downtown every once in awhile and hit up Speakeasy.", "author": "Law C."}

I can't wait for Friday's to enjoy Happy Hour at Speakeasy's. $3 beers you CAN't go wrong with that, and don't forget to bring your growler or buy one. Fill up the growler for beer at home :) Pet's used to be allowed, but are now banned (boo) Kid friendly spot, which is a plus for me (yay) Please watch out cause after  2 beers, seriously only 2 you are feeling the alcohol. Awesome!", "author": "Monica O."}

We took a group of 20 from my office, and started out with an awesome tour given by the head brewer himself. According to one of my coworkers it was \"ten times as detailed\" as the Anchor Steam tour. The pints are super-cheap for quality beer - you can get obliterated for less than $10. (Particularly if you're drinking Double Daddy - watch out for that one.) They had burritos and taquitos when I was there, which were decent for what you pay. Minus one star for being in such a random, out-of-the-way, close-to-sketchy-places neighborhood. It is not a great place to have to drunkenly find your way home from. (Somehow we thought we could get off the T at 24th street and walk to the Mission...oh wait, those are projects. Oops.)", "author": "Kristen B."}

Speakeasy brew beef for enthusiasts nationwide, and limited-production boutique crafts for local consumption by those in the know. The brewery is run by a team of no-nonsense barley and hops specialists, Californians through and through, that clearly love doing their job and doing it well. In-house tastings on most Fridays. Call in advance for reservations.", "author": "Michael P."}

On Fridays they have an Open House Barbecue from 4:00pm-8:00pm, with a live band usually playing!  The Speakeasy crew are really welcoming always willing to answer someone's (mine) stupid questions about the whole brewing process!", "author": "Cassie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-16", "description": "The beers are good.  The guys are cool.  They have very chill happy hours with good Speakeasy beers, a basic bbq and cool merchandise.  Speakeasy hoodies, bumper stickers & thongs, oh my!  Unfortunately the happy hour is only  a few hours on Friday nights, but it is still really good. They also have the harder to find beers on tap on those nights.  Also, you can get a case, growler, keg or pint.  I have a growing collection of Speakeasy pint glasses from these nights.  And a few Speakeasy poker chips. And the hoodie... and of course I've had plenty of the beer.", "author": "Heidi P."}

They have a very good happy hour on Fridays and when there is live music it is a unique venue.  Good cheap Mexican food to soak up the beer and free popcorn doesn't hurt.  Some people bring their kids which is....different and a little disconcerting when kids are running around people drinking.", "author": "Matt B."}
