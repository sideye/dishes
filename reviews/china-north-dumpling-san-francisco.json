My friend recommended China North Dumpling, and as it was just a short drive away, we decided it would be a good second choice. \n\nFor a party of 4, we ordered the pig ear appetizer, napa cabbage and pork dumplings, the sichuan boiled fish, and the deep fried eggplant. \n\nThe pig ear appetizer was actually quite delicious. The texture was almost like the squid in a cold cut platter. I like that it was mixed in with red and green bell peppers, which made it super refreshing. \n\nEverything else was pretty good, but my favorite was the deep fried eggplant. The eggplant is skinned and battered before deep frying, giving it a texture similar to a well done potato fry. I probably could have devoured the whole plate by myself! :9\n\nOverall, it was a selection of guilty pleasure eats, but while delicious at the time, I definitely felt the (gross, bloated) effects of the food hours later. That being said, this would definitely not be a restaurant I would frequent, however if I ever have a craving for greasy kung pao chicken, I know exactly where to go!", "author": "Sherry L."}

My favorite dish is still the spicy red sauce dumplings that swims in the sauce.  I used to come here for just dumplings.  The chives with prawns is good but I like it pan fried then dipped in vinegar.  \n\nRecently I've tried the dinner dishes that goes with rice which I thought was mediocre.  it doesn't give me a wow factor.  I've tried the lion head meatballs which are flavorful with the sauce but not wow inside the meatball (have had it better elsewhere).  The tofu seems nice and colored but wasn't spectacular in flavor either.  My favorite of all the dishes were probably the (non-spicy) eggplant dish.  They only have 3 types of eggplants.  If you ask for non-spicy that's the one I like.. I remember trying their dry one before and it was NOT good.  The last dish I've tried is the \"saliva chicken\" if you say it in Chinese.  It's a cold served chicken but the flavor here isn't as good as other places i've had it from so overall I'd give the dinner dishes a 3 star.  and a 5 star for my favorite dumpling dish and  around a 3 and a half for the other dumplings.  \n\nService: \n\nFrom what I remember there appears to be trouble getting the attention of the servers.  English isn't understood really well for the most part as long as you could point to the list of food or pictures you're ok, but they probably have to fish someone in there to speak English to you if you need to ask for recommendations or have questions.  I think selective workers speak Cantonese and more so speak Mandarin so if Language is a struggle for you then, try to be sure of your food selections prior to ordering.  They also make mistakes too which is normal , but from my experience they made it sound like we changed our minds on the order when it came out instead of them taking the order down wrong.  No apologies either.  \n\nI didn't have too much expectation for service so I wasn't too disappointed, therefore the overall score for food and service it averages out to about 3/5 star for me so far :)  Hope to see changes in the future.

There's something about Chinese food in the sunset district I can't exactly describe, but once you've experienced a few places you'll start noticing it's different in style and taste than Chinese food elsewhere in the city. \n\nFor food, we got the egg flower soup- pretty good, light and with carrots and peas, like ones from a bag in the frozen aisle. Didn't mind them, though.\n\nThe braised pork looked dark and deliciously glazed and braised in the menu, but when we received it it fell below expectation. The sauce was brown... not dark like soy sauce. It didn't have the classic soy braised pork taste. The sauce also penetrated the bok choy underneath, making it oily and not super palatable.\n\nUnfortunately don't have good things to say about the pig ears either- definitely one of the worse ones I've had, and again, I think it's because the sauce they used wasn't the typical red chili sauce. The sauce looked paler and tasted more bland.\n\nThe dumplings though, they got right. It takes a while to cook, but they're plump, juicy and a big portion of meat filling.\n\nI've been here one other time, and the chicken and mushroom was delicious and tasty but was full of tiny chicken bones. Their beef noodle soup was really not good either, the meat was pretty tough. So all in all, the highlight was... the egg drop soup. Really?! -__-", "author": "Ke C."}

Green Onion Satay Beef - I'm a satay fan and this dish does not disappoint. All of the flavors are on point. Beef was tender and there wasn't a disportionate amount of onions. So good. $9.95\n\nM12. Leaves Spareribs - skip this dish\nI was intrigued by the name of this dish and when I asked what this was, the waiter who spoke limited English couldn't really explain it. He was able to point to another dish and said it had the same sauce. Well the dish is basically braised (and chopped) spareribs with bell peppers. Why is this called Leaves Spareribs?? The spareribs were surprisingly tender but it didn't have an amazingly distinctive flavor like the other 2 dishes we ordered. $10.95 - would not recommend this\n\nOverall I loved eating here.

Wanting to finish watching a Warriors' road game on TV, we met here around 8 pm.  The dining room had only four filled tables so we can the pick of tables, opting for one near the window.  We waited briefly for another friend before ordering and said friend arrived when the second plate of food was served.  Here's what we shared:\n\n1) Northern homemade colorful mix (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=J6JHHF1I8c3LOF1JsP57IA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Very colorful presentation and flavors were pretty good.  Just a notch below Great China in Berkley in terms of quality.  Nice to see this offered someplace not needing me to drive across a bridge.\n\n2) Chive dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LLhKurwJagJ0BHUGBJ-hSw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Probably the best dish from our menu.  The pastry was served piping hot as the skin had a nice chewy crisp texture.  The filing of chives and rice noodles were flavored on point.\n\n3) XLB (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tneyGwKsjm8cFETQy2fN5Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Decent rendition of the dumplings as the skin weren't too thick.  Wished there was a little more soup in the dumplings.  Generously sized and nine to an order.\n\n4) Dry fried chicken wings (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BEa1pacYDDtxBl6sXL8kYQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Visually appealing with a good crunch to the batter.  The flavor was just a bit off with more of a tangy than sweet flavor here.\n\n5) Beef noodle soup (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VP8r_kzBkQsyS_oDTTOVoQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Again, very large portions and no shortage of beef here.  The meat is a bit on the chewy side, but it is lean and had decent flavors.  \n\nThree of us shared the above food and finished most of it.  There were leftovers of the chive dumpling and beef noodle soup which I saved for a future meal.  There was only one waitress working the dining room, but not sure whether it was due to our timing.  \nWas it the best?  No, I wouldn't put it in that league.  \nHowever, if you have a craving for dumplings or noodles while in the neighborhood, this is certainly a good option.

As the name of the restaurant would suggest, order dumplings. But do NOT get the xlb (that's a Shanghai/HK staple, not a Northern Chinese specialty).\n\nDo get the jiaozi, a whole list of which can be found on the first page of their menu. They are able to make most of the jiaozi boiled or pan fried. My personal preference has always been shuijiao over guotie; my favorites here are the pork & cabbage and the shrimp & chives (the classics, baby!). I love that they serve black vinegar instead of soy sauce because that really is the superior way to enjoy dumplings :)\n\nThe noodles here are hand pulled and I am a huge fan of their beef noodle soup. I think it may be my second favorite in the entire Bay Area thus far (there's a couple places near Parkside I may have to try first though). \n\nTheir best non-dumpling dish, however, is probably is their braised eggplant. I always take people here to try this and they're always surprised that what they're eating is eggplant! Even non eggplant-fans may like this and it's always a favorite among our vegetarian friends. There's no words to describe the texture or flavor--except that it's ridiculously delicious!\n\nMaybe my standards are different than most non-Chinese, but I've always found the service here to be good. Not stellar but definitely better than most of your average Chinese restaurants. If you dine-in, you also get unlimited amounts of salted peanuts and kimchi as a free appetizer.

Garnishes were few and far in between so basically, we were just eating two types of noodles tossed in soy sauce. Hm. And though the steamed dumplings were pretty good, it was disappointing that they didn't serve it with the ginger/vinegar garnish. They only had a little spout of vinegar that you could dispense for yourself.\n\nLastly, this was more personal preference but because we sat on the adjacent space (the additional room) there was less of a presence from the waitresses.

Get them pan fried for a little more flavor!\nSpecial Beef Noodle Soup: I was rather disappointed by this dish. The noodles were soggy, the soup was bland, and the overall execution was poorly done. \nShanghai Style Chow Mein: I rather enjoyed this dish - the flavors are a little on the heavier side though so it's a little salty and oily. The noodles are very well done however.\nString Bean: This was done as you might expect - nothing surprising about it but nothing disappointing either.\nHot & Spicy Boiled Fish: Despite how big this bowl was, ours barely held any fish in it! As a heads up, the overall dish is not as spicy as it looks. Avoid the chilis by scraping the majority of it off of your pieces of fish and vegetables, and it makes for a pleasant heat.\n\nOverall, I will probably be back to give a few of the other dishes a try. My overall impressions were that the dishes were average, but being close to my current workplace it is definitely convenient. Prices are fairly reasonable and portion sizes are quite good, so you can definitely get full off of one dish here.

There was a lot of broth inside, and the size is great for the price. Also loved their Shanghai Thick Noodles. The only 2 complaints were the green onion pancake: some pieces had way too much green onions and other pieces had just specks of green onions; Salt & pepper chicken wings should be renamed to Salty chicken wings. While the wings were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, the amount of salt was overpowering, and there was no zing from any peppers. \n\nPrice was very reasonable. $82 for 9 dishes.

Although they do offer a few dishes from other Chinese cuisines, China North Dumpling (as its name suggests) focuses mainly on Northern Chinese dishes.  What does that entail, exactly?  Noodles and dumplings galore!\n\nWhile it may be disappointing for some not to see a favorite like Xiao Long Baos on the menu, China North has plenty of other great dishes to offer - about 160+ in total?  It's impressive that they can offer such an extensive range of appetizers, cold dishes, noodles, vegetable/tofu dishes, soups, seafood, and, of course, numerous types of dumplings (other than XLB).\n\n-- GREEN ONION PANCAKE...$4.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#hqTKQ18DOMPJXD0N6zHPpw)\nIt was thicker than I typically prefer (thin and crispy), but the outside had a nice crust.  The center was pretty good too, as it was slightly chewy and not bready, and the fresh green onions helped to add a lot of great flavor.\n\n-- NAPA CABBAGE WITH PORK DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#4yE81GGRooZiWYQGK_gaFg)\nAlthough they weren't as tasty as others I've tried (still good), it was awesome how they were so packed with filling.  I wonder if the ones with mushroom or chives would have been better, but these were still solid overall.\n\n-- PAN FRIED DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#kpMtuyZ3pdrTKGisPAFoEw)\nLike with the dumplings, every one of these was loaded.  In this case though, the filling was both savorier and juicier.  The bottom crust was the highlight though - the skin had the perfect consistency and the bottom was so nicely browned!\n\n-- SHANGHAI STYLE CHOW MEIN (with Hand Made Noodles)...$7.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#egMPX5J2nxWtfAjLDl3R1w)\nEven though they aren't very long (perfect for kids though), the hand made noodles are a plus.  They had just slight bite to them, and the sauce on the noodles was terrific.  A little more meat would have been nice, but it was just fine otherwise.\n\n-- HOUSE SPECIAL PORK...$8.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#e6PEnwsgThYMy4kZcdF8Tw)\nWhile all of the other dishes were good, this one stood out the most.  It was simple (pork belly, bok choy, and their house sauce), but well done.  The bits of pork were cooked perfectly (soft and tender) and I thought the sauce added a slight tartness to the dish.\n\nConsidering the three of us were able to try five things for a measly $40 (with leftovers), it's safe to say the portions at China North are both plentiful and cheap.  Which is a good thing too since between the various types of hand pulled noodle soups (particularly the spicy beef noodle soup) and all of the dumplings, there's plenty more to try!

If you want a real breakdown, it then varies from northeast to northwest by hand pulled noodles and the buns but I digress.\n\n- Northern China = colder climate which = limited range of food that can grow. As a result = pickled goodies (think garlic, scallions, leeks etc in oil and vinegar) \n\n- meat consumed is primarily beef and lamb\n\nSo for you noobs who order garlic cucumbers and whine about oil, don't come here looking for chow mein or fried rice either.  CHINA NORTH IS NOT SHANGHAINESE. There are NO XLBs here noobs!\n\nComplimentary peanuts and pickled cabbage upon seating. The pickled cabbage is spicy and tasty. \n\nChina North Dumpling does indeed have a variety of dumplings. They offer them steamed or pan fried. My friends and I took so damn long we decided to order the 3 vegetable dumplings [fried] and the mushroom and pork dumplings [steamed]. \nDon't let the 3 vegetable dumplings fool you, it is not vegetarian because there is shrimp. China North only offers vegetarian dumplings on the weekends. \n\nThe dumplings (both steamed and pan fried) were executed beautifully. Generous amounts of filling in the mushroom and pork especially. \n\nWe shared an order of the beef pancake wrap. I was a little disappointed there was no sour cabbage inside of it (that's a-ok w/ me it's just what I've grown accustomed to) but happy that there was no cilantro. The pancake itself looked delicate because it was so thin, but it held up the beef and hoisin sauce that was already inside pretty well. The pancake was crispy. Definitely order this.\n\nI had the spicy beef noodle soup w/ hand made noodles. Oh man. They gave me plenty of beef and there is PLENTY of noodles. The handmade noodles are thick and starchy (duh) and so filling. I LOVE THEM. They are cooked perfectly al dente and the spicy beef noodle soup broth is excellent. A good amount of cumin (totes normal for northern Chinese) and definitely hit the spot. \n\nI had a few bites of my friend's sesame handmade noodles. This is a cold noodle dish, and served with sliced cucumbers. Very refreshing but also filling because of the hand noodles. It would probably be best to share with another person. \nMy other friend had the dumpling noodle soup (also with handmade noodles) which was good and plentiful. The dumplings in his order had minced shrimp in it so I didn't try. \n\nTotal damage was about $50 and we had leftovers. \n\nI'm coming back to try more dumplings.

It truly makes me question his dumpling palate. \n\nI've experienced my fair share of delicious dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. This place doesn't make the cut.

I rush straight home to find ALL of the dishes I ordered to be luke warm. It's one thing to wait for perfection. But to double my wait time and bestow me with luke warm food is undeserving. \n\nPrices are good for the dumpling portion.

And instead of the regular boiled ones, we decided to get the pan-fried ones because I hadn't had that elsewhere. We ordered the Beef/Celery and the Fennel/Pork Dumplings. For a main dish, we wanted something not too meaty, so we got the Egg Surface Tofu. And to pack on them carbs, we got Dalu Noodles. \n\n1. Beef/Celery Dumplings: This was a very interesting combo. I've never had beef dumplings before, so I was pleasantly surprised by the tender meat inside. \n\n2. Fennel/Pork Dumplings: The fennel had a pretty sensational aftertaste that lingered in your mouth. Who knew dumplings had that kinda power?\n\n3. Egg Surface Tofu: This was the crowd-pleaser among my friends. It supposedly required 40 minutes to make, which I don't know if that is true because I feel like it was ready in 20. Anyway, it was silky and had a layer of crunchy batter in the middle. Yum.\n\n4. Dalu Noodles: As someone who has eaten a ton of noodles, I've never had noodles quite like these. They were thick, but not super doughy. Also the gravy that topped it was really nice.\n\nThe service, of course wasn't great. We were kinda rushed to order our meal, and my friend said the workers were \"mean-mugging\" us the whole time.

The flavour is awesome. It's not on the regular menu, you have to special order it. They make great Dumplings here of course. The Shanghai Noodles are great & so filling. They serve everything with pickled cabbage. Stick with what they are known for - their staples - such as the dumplings. The pots of soup and noodle dishes also are quite good. I tried their food for a take-away and ordered some basic Chinese staples the first time round, cos I was craving Chinese food - and it was just okay. I had some Trader Joes dumplings in the freezer so I didn't order dumplings here but I did order a soup and a few a la carte entrees and they were just average.

The wontons hit the spot and was sweeter than I expected (then again I eat Shanghai+Taiwan style more often). Spicy beef noodle soup was more of a meh for me (Too used to San Gabriel Valley and legit Taiwan night market stalls). Wasn't spicy enough to get my eyes watering and nose runny. Beef was slightly overcooked, but the noodles were pretty damn good. It's hard to find really good beef noodle soup in SF so I guess this will pass for my tastes.

The restaurant itself have ample space, basically has space right when you enter (left side) and if you turn right, there's larger seatings available there.

First, the pepper salt chicken is amazing, came with lots of red chili peppers (fried extra crispy) which can be spicy, so be careful. I love spicy food so it was alright to me. This order of chicken was better than San Tung chicken to me, It was soo delicious that I can eat this once a week! haha, well that's my fatty inside splurting out crap. So, next is the spicy garlic eggplant.

With a name like China North Dumpling, one should hope that dumplings are their specialty but take a look at the menu and you just might realize you were wrong.  \n\n- Green Onion pancake: large, thick and fluffy = very filling!, unlike the thin fried pancakes commonly found in Shanghai restaurants; had adequate amount of green onions and flavor.  \n- Chives pancake: 95% minced chives, 5% eggs, I swear there's supposed to be pork in this; flavor is a-ok if you like chives chives chives.  \n- Special beef noodle soup: pieces of beef and tendon atop thick noodles in broth; came to our table only a minute after we ordered so I assume this was pre-made and the waitress did tell us that the beef is added on after the noodles are done; noodles by itself were nothing special and I had to add hot sauce to keep from getting bored.  Beef was ok on its own, the tendon was soft and gelatinous the way I like it.  Broth was not bad, maybe a little msg in it?  \n- West lake w/ Prawns Fried Dumpling:  What's West Lake, you ask? Oh, just zucchini.  High expectations for this because of its unique ingredients. This was very lightly fried and the dumpling skin seemed fresh and thin.  The interior, however, was disappointing; very little filling (grated zucchini and prawns), bland and soggy, maybe slightly overcooked.  When you cook zucchini, it tends to become a shrunken watery mess if not done right, and this probably contributed to the lack of flavor.  The prawns were diced up to a size smaller than my pinkie fingernail and each dumpling only had maybe 2 of these tiny pieces.  \n\nThere was a significant wait time between finishing the first 2-3 dishes and getting our dumplings.

The Soup was BLAND, like almost drinking water and a little msg.  \n\n-Third, we also ordered the Mu Shu Pork (Something we normally don't).  Anyway, the \"stuffing\" for the wraps came, and it looked like in was baked in soy sauce, totally dark and salty.  Chef poured in way too much soy sauce! They also forgot to bring the wraps for the mu shu pork, so what did one of the waitress do?  She bought UNCOOK egg roll wrappers to give to us for the mu shu pork.  We all gave her the WTF look!?\n    \n-Our last item, the \"Napa Cable with pork dumpling\" ..... they bought chives and pork dumpling to us instead.  The dumpling place next door makes better dumpling you can buy to bring home to cook.  \n\nAnyway, the last place that opened up in this spot went belly up not too long.   This isn't going to stay in business very long either with they way it's run and way below par food.", "author": "Guess G."}

I thought the noodle soup was decent but bf said it only tasted like MSG. Dumplings were bland. No xlb at this place for those xlb lovers like me.", "author": "W W."}

They were very good.  I'll have to go back on the next trip to the museum to try out the onion cake and other dishes which looked very good -- I always look at other people's food.  The smells, which contribute so much to the taste of food, were also very good.", "author": "Jane W."}

Only $20.95, get to pick 3 dishes from selected menu, comes with sour & spicy soup and rice.  I got the beef with green onion, spicy fish, and eggplant with garlic sauce. It was plentiful for 7 people.  The spicy fish was surprising good.  I was just expecting fillets with chilly sauce over it, but to my surprise, it was deep fried fillets with dried crush pepper and red whole chilly peppers.  It was delicious!  Other food are ok, dumplings are fresh, green onion cake is flavorful.  Potstickers and noodles are just so so.  Overall, very good price for decent food.  However, food are served pretty slow.", "author": "Jen C."}

We always order a feast when we dine here - reminds us of our many trips to China. Service is excellent; the girls are very nice and attentive (and multilingual - they speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin, plus other dialects too!). Highly recommend the pancakes, crispy spicy chicken, Shanghai style hand-pulled noodles, walnut prawns, egg and tofu, lamb noodle soup, and Shanghai dumplings. You can have the dumplings steamed or fried like potstickers - I recommend getting them fried. All super yummy!  Highly recommended - thumbs up!", "author": "Christine S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-04", "description": "Very fresh dumplings. The chef is from the Shandong area in China. Their name is translated \"water dumpling\" For those less knowledgeable, their specialty would NOT be XLB, which is a Shanghainese dish. \nThe Mushroom with Pork Steam Dumpling was very fresh, had a good amount of quality filling and a good skin. The garlic sweet vinegar gave the correct \"ethnic\" touch to the dumplings. You can request black/Chinkiang vinegar, but not surprisingly, their garlic vinegar was the better match. The black vinegar imparted too much of its own flavor and \"unbalanced\" the dish. An excellent selection!\nTheir Chicken w. House Special Brown Sauce also used good, fresh ingredients. Good spicy flavor with a bit of Sichuan Pepper. A touch too much oil, but still very good.\nThe more pedestrian MuShu Chicken (in this case) had good ingredients, did not flood the plate or wrappers with a ton of liquid, and was not over salted. The wrappers were the correct, very thin Popiah variety. A good choice, even though it is not a dish from their region.\nThe Green Onion Pancakes were not great. We saw them making them fresh there, but they were just not light enough. Good if you wanted a heavy dish, but sadly, not a good example of what they should be.\n\nService was ok. Friendly but understaffed at first, but as more wait staff materialized, it was pretty responsive. In summary, I absolutely would go back. Good quality, unigue dishes with an enthusiastic and polite manager.", "author": "Art Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-26", "description": "My friend and I found this place by chance.  It was between this restaurant and another restaurant a few doors down and we selected China North Dumpling.  That was a few weeks ago and we have been back at least 4 or 5 times.  The food is absolutely delicious.  For appetizer we've had both their green onion and sesame pancakes-both delicious.  The pot stickers which are house made are plump and juicy.  However it does take the kitchen about 20 minutes to prepare them and the server was nice enough to let us know.  For cold platter we had the slice cucumber which is recommended if you order a spicy dish. For meat, we had the crispy salt and pepper chicken which was not greasy and had a little heat.  The cumin lamb is my favorite but be careful and tell the server to tone down the heat..  For vegetables we have had the spicy cabbage but my favorite is salt and pepper tofu.  Instead of rice, try the Shanghai Style Chow Mein.  The noodles are hand made in the restaurant.  Also, if its not on the table ask your server for their house made sweet chili sauce.  Great for the pot stickers or the tofu dish.  We've become almost regulars here and we look forward to our next visit.  Maybe we will try something new like their wonderful house made dumplings.", "author": "David P."}
