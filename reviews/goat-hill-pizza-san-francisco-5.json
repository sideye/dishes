I'm very easily persuaded, I know. \n\nThis time, I actually walked over to the shop to place and pick up my order for a fresh slice. You can add up to 3 toppings to your slice, which isn't bad. It was a pretty big slice too so I felt like my $5-something was worth it. I think the wait was somewhere between 5-10 min. The pizza came out piping hot and the crust was baked to perfection. Oh, it was GOOOOD. \n\nAll in all, GH did pretty well this time. I'm only giving them 4 stars for now because I haven't quite forgiven them for the delivery fiasco of 2016. My heart just can't heal that fast. And I'm definitely NEVER ORDERING DELIVERY AGAIN.

It looked like garage and I'm sure it was. Even though I already ate, I had to grab a slice. I got the slice of the day which was chicken, mushrooms and green onions. \n\nFor a slice it took about 5 minutes to get and I have to say. It didn't blow me out of the water. I love the sour dough crust but it didn't really do it for me here. I love cheeseboard's sourdough bread but this place it was very too crunchy. After I picked up my slice, the pizza cracked in half and it was a big mess. The reason why the pizza's shouldn't be super crunchy is to prevent issues like this. It should be a bit soft so you can fold it and eat it. I literally had to eat this with a fork and the toppings was not the best. The chicken was bland af, mushrooms was okay but the red sauce tasted like it sat in the sun for days. It just wasn't the best. The crust itself was good but just a little bit too crunchy. I probably won't be trying this place again. If you want good sourdough crust, head over to the cheese board in Berkeley.", "author": "Andrew T."}

WTF..?!?   Why didn't I know about this?  I drive down that street to get to work countless times and it all looks like warehouse space or apartments -- I had no idea.  The only place I was aware of was Escape From NY on Harrison & 3rd and they can make a decent slice, but they are SO inconsistent with the quality.\n\nGoat Hill has always had a great reputation in Potrero Hill so I went in today to this SoMa location sitting on a street under the I-80 to get a slice and noticed that this tiny location doesn't just have pizza (like Escape From NY) but actually has pasta, which I couldn't pass up, especially ravioli -- but, then, knowing how ravioli can get easily screwed up, I lowered my expectations.\n\nDidn't have to -- this is some really good ravioli!   I think mine was filled with meat & spinach -- it was perfectly 'al dente' which is a major criteria for me for rating pasta and had a wonderful flavor -- and the marinara?  Excellent!   Then there was the garlic bread.  Garlic bread.  Garlic bread is garlic bread, right?  Of course, no, most of us know it's not -- and this ain't no lame garlic bread.  Large piece, hot, crunchy, just the right amount of butter & garlic -- and one other ingredient I can't quite place that gives it an extra great taste.\n\nSo, next time -- pizza slices.  My coworker went there (he's the one that ran into it by mistake) and loved his slices, so I know I have something to look forward to.  I'm just very very sad that I only found out about this today.  All those years of great meals I could have had.\n\nAll I'll say to Goat Hill Pizza -- great job, folks, but maybe it's time to do a refresher on your advertising for offices/businesses around you so they know what they've been missing.", "author": "Merrick W."}

It gets extra points for being so close to work. What I loved about this pizza was that it's on sourdough. I personally love sourdough, but I do know a fair amount of people who think that sourdough is too strong. Goat Hill Pizza manages to make a pizza that has the sourdough complimentary, allowing it to work harmoniously with your precious pizza ingredients.\n\nThis location is a down the Stillman alley. It'll look like you're in the wrong place, but you can order from the window and your pizza will be done in about 5-10 minutes depending on your toppings. I went with sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms on one. I realized I didn't know how big the pizza was, so I decided to order a second with spinach and chicken. I think the chicken took a little longer, so there's a heads up for you.\n\nWe took the pizza up to the roof at work and it was super tasty! The toppings were on-par, and yes, they do have goat cheese if you request it. If you don't like sourdough, or you're a slow eater, you may want to steer clear of the crust. I've noticed that this crust gets tougher and tougher the longer you let it sit, so definitely try to eat it quickly or eat it first...or don't eat it at all if you don't like sourdough. Personally, I loved the crust. That was straight up sourdough goodness! I will definitely go back for lunch.", "author": "Robbin A."}

I'll be honest it's not the best pizza I've ever had but it's still pretty darn good. After having tried delivery from many other places Goat Hill by far has been the most consistent and best tasting. One thing I LOVE is they make their Ranch dressing. It's probably just from the dry packet but it tastes so much better than the bottled stuff. I know, this has nothing to do with the pizza but if you like Ranch and like to dip your crust in Ranch this is the joint. \n\nI've tried several other places but I keep coming back here.

It tasted like there was too much yeast in the mix, or it hadn't been allowed to rise fully. The result was a chewy, leathery, heavy bread under the body of the pizza, even if the outer crust was a bit crisp.\n\nThe cheese was pretty average, and just a bit hard even while the pizza was warm - I don't know what that indicates, but combined with the leathery crust, it made for a pretty dull experience. It didn't give off much of an aroma, and chewing was a chore. Pizza shouldn't make one's jaw tired.\n\nThe garlic cheese bread was nice. A lot of places give you something that seems like it's just pizza dough cut a little differently. This was an authentic, well-made cheesey garlic bread.\n\nThey also deliver IBC Root Beer at a reasonable price. That's a great change from the usual soda + bottled water choices.\n\nDelivery time was as estimated, to the minute.", "author": "Brian M."}

Unexpectedly, we received close to 20 pizzas from Goat Hill Pizza.  Nobody had ordered the pizza...Goat Hill Pizza donated this food to feed all of us, the disaster workers busily taking care of the injured.  \n\nWe were all so touched and grateful by this kind gesture from our community restaurant!  I would give them 10 stars if I could!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-03", "description": "Ordered the Mediterranean. High expectations but honestly I was disappointed. Basically received a generic tasting, run of the mill, cheesy, soggy pie. The type that can be found in most run of the mill pizza places. That's ok but not when they're more expensive than those places. What should be expected is unique original flavor from the dough and sauce however the primary taste came from the baked red onions and bland mozzarella. I expect that from Pizza Hut except Goat Hill is 3 x more expensive. Very disappointed!", "author": "Ron P."}

Goat Hill is usually our household pizza parlor of choice for these events. They have a unique sourdough crust that goes great with the watery ranch sauce they provide. I also love their hot wings. They're not deep fried, but drenched in sauce and tender. The pizza is a little expensive (usually costs us around $30), but it completes a night of football or hockey.", "author": "Angela L."}

I called that number and ordered my Pizza, for delivery to Bernal Heights. The next day I noticed I had been charged an outrageous $4.50(!) for the delivery service. No employee at either location explained this NEW FEE or procedure. Besides that, I was disappointed in the quality of the Pizza, the crust was too thick & doughy & the cheese was weird... I want my delivery charge refunded, so I can go to Arinell's Pizza for a great slice of Pizza!", "author": "Chris Ellen M."}

I had never heard of this place but work decided to have a pizza party and the pizza was from here.  The meat lover's and combo ones were very good.  Did not skimp on the toppings, very fresh tasting.  The crust is nice too.  I would definitely order from here again.", "author": "La C."}

Just ordered a XL for the crew here at work.\nPizza is delicious, as expected and hot!\n\nThis location appears not to be a sit down restaurant.  Back door on Stillman is a perfect take-out location for SOMA.  \n\nmmmmmmmm :)\nRob Jaron", "author": "Robert J."}
