Ask for two shots of Jamo and she poured the shots into tiny shot glasses instead of the normal cup of Jamo.   People right next to us who had just finished their shot were given a cup.   Beyond the bartender shorting us on the shot, she was incredibly stand offish.  No thank you or any kind of kind gesture which a bartender should do.  Lady decided she didnt like our group before words were even said.  Frankly, the bar needs to address this.  Left immediately after the shot issue.  It was incredible how blatant this treatment was.  Lady deserves to be fired for treating customers like dirt.\n\nUpdate: bar owner knows exactly what I mean when I mention the cup shot vs tiny glass shot.   Instead of apologizing for poor service he denies he's ever heard of shots being served in cups.    Not only is the service terrible, but they have no intention of trying to improve.   Do yourself a favor and go anywhere, but this dump.   Chestnut has a lot better to offer.", "author": "Justin S."}

This place goes back to 1934 - One of the Post-Prohibition Bars.  It is one of the best low key bars on Chestnut Street in the the Marina District.  Given the neighborhood, this is a pretty unpretentious spot to grab a beer or two when you're in this neck of the woods.  This is a drinkers bar.  I am by no means a regular, but I can tell that there is a high regular presence.\n\nThey have a nice pool area in the back with two tables.  It sorta reminds my of Gino and Carlo.  I usually just catch a Giants game or some Football.  I have recently fallen in LOVE with the NBA and I just noticed they are a Celtics Bar, which is my adopted Eastern Conference team.  I may propose that they institute a $2 discount if you wear Celtics gear.  (Just bought a Jae Crowder jersey shirt on Clearance since he's now a Cavalier)  So, they got that going for them, which is nice.\n\n$7 for a Beer is too much.  It's also The Marina, so at busy times it can lurch towards Marina-ee pretty quick.  But, given that statement, this bar gets voted least likely to go Full Marina Obnoxious and feels the most San Francisco of the spots in this area.", "author": "Adam S."}

After my group decided to stay for another game, I went up to the bar to buy another beer and was told by the bartender (didn't catch his name) that it was \"annoying\" that I had already closed a tab and was back to buy another drink. \n\nI understand the concept of opening tabs and get that it's slightly inconvenient that I came back to use my card at the bar for a drink after closing out - but I was taken aback at his reaction considering that I had tipped accordingly on my previous transaction. That bartender needs a lesson on the basics of customer service.\n\nIn short - great location, cool atmosphere, reasonably priced/stiff drinks, but the service could use an upgrade.

So I asked for my card back to  close out my tab and the bartender had the nerve to circle the tip amount she recommended just after asking us to leave. We left a nice little message on how we felt about her and the establishment on the receipt along with a big fat tip of 0. There are plenty of way better bars in the Richmond anyway.

I have never experienced anything like what happened last night at the Horsehoe Tavern Bar.\n\nA few friends had just joined our group and we immediately made our way to the bar to order a round of shots. Long story short, we order the shots and as we stood there talking for about a minute (no joke,) out of nowhere the bouncer informs us that the bar tender demanded that we get kicked out. Completely clueless of what was going on, we asked the bouncer why we were getting kicked out but refused to answer and proceeded to push us out the door. My husband notices, walks over and gets in between us and the bouncer and asks again why we were getting kicked out. The bouncer flips out, starts pushing him roughly and begins to yell at the top of his lungs to get out of his bar while random customers hold him back because it looked like a fight was about to happen.\n\nOnce outside, we find out the details from a kind customer who witnessed how it went down. So apparently, after our friend ordered the shots, she was asked twice by the bar tender to pay the tab and because we didn't hear her and pay fast enough, the bar tender found it necessary to go to extremes and have us kicked out. With the music blasting, it didn't even occur to her to perhaps tap one of us on the shoulder and let us know that you wanted the bill paid asap? We didn't move at all from our original spot from when we ordered while two of us were still holding the shot glasses in our hands and your kicking us out for not paying fast enough? \n\nLet me add, that while we were getting informed of the reason for the unnecessary incident that had just happened, my husband walks over to the bouncer and asks again calmly why we got kicked out. He said, \"Let me get this straight. You want me to ask the bartender why the girls got kicked out? You've asked me 4 times now and the answer is no. I'll do it when I have the time,\" and just stood there with a cynical smile on his face. I mean, really?\n\nAfter all that, we happily took our group of 17 people to another bar where we would be treated respectfully and rationally.", "author": "Leslie S."}

It is a sports bar, so like any bar you're experience will really depend on the crowd that shows up on any given night. Over the years I've typically had good experiences here. The bartenders have changed over the years, but it's awesome to still have Stef involved (yes, he's the former Yankees pitcher and all-around cool dude).\n\nThe place is littered with TVs and some game is always on - no matter what sport you're into, it's on at some point. There are a couple pool tables in back (with the obligatory missing ball or two that have substitutes) and a jukebox with a selection that hadn't changed for years last I checked - it's all definitely part of the Shoe's charm (seriously). The bartenders have ALWAYS been awesome and friendly, and if you become a regular they will take extra good care of you. The place gets PACKED on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you don't like crowds, this isn't your spot.\n\nWhat else can I say? It's just a great spot to come catch up with people, get out of the house, blow off steam when you need to, or wind down after a long day at work. I've seen all sorts of people come through here over the years - sailing crews celebrating after a race, softball teams pounding down brews after a game, Giants fans having a couple before and after games, people drowning their sorrows, drunk fratboys and the legendary Marina girls, and then non-locals that ordinarily bash the Marina who show up wanting so badly to be accepted as a Marina local. \n\nIt's all good - it's what makes life interesting, it's how you meet cool people and have some fun. For my drinkin' money, there's no better place for this than the Shoe. God love it.\n\nOh yeah, don't show up hear wearing ANYTHING with a Dodgers logo on it! :-)", "author": "Gregg G."}

Nothing really special but it's perfect after work for some pool shooting and few beers. It's always been fun until last night. After most of our coworkers left 3 of us (girls) stayed to finish our drinks (me and one of the girls shared a beer) and the other had her drink (full, since she just got it). As we talk my friend with the full drink had a sip and placed it on the armrest of the bar. The bartender (Cory) told her that she'll spill it so she should put it on the bar. She told him not to worry since she's not one of these people who spills or knocks their drinks off (keep in mind that we also work in the food and beverage industry and have seen plenty so we know how to behave and where it's safe to put drinks and food without making a mess). Obviously, he didn't like that and got mad. He took her drink and dumped it. Then looked at my other friend and said \"In fact, I don't like you either!\", took her beer and dumped it too and kicked us out. Not fair at all. Being an asswhole is not the way to keep customers coming. Or was that because of the alcohol amount he drunk?", "author": "Kristina K."}

To make life easier, we decided to just stay in the Marina and go some place where the guys wouldn't have any problem getting in (and where there wouldn't be any line issues at all).\n\nWe decide on Circa which is a reliable place to grab drink...but there was a ridiculous line.  When i say ridiculous, I mean almost to the end of the block (which I think is fair assessment).  The line isn't moving at all...and we weren't wedded to Circa, so we decide to hit up my friend's favorite dive in the neighborhood, Horseshoe Tavern.\n\nAs soon as we walk in, I realize that it is all guys...and I mean all guys.  There were probably just under 10 ladies there that night....and a bar packed with men.  So if you're looking for a place to pick up on guys (or have them pick up on you, rather), this is the place.  I can understand why too - the drinks are pretty cheap, the bartenders are fast and there are a number of TVs around the bar.  Clearly, they are trying to please both women and men - Oprah (or Dr. Phil?) was on in one corner and Sports Center was on in the other.  There are pool tables in the back, though the lights are a little too bright back there...too, too bright.  If you don't mind being pushed and shoved at the front of the bar, then you can stake a claim within eye contact of the bartender.\n\nThe night was definitely better than it would've been across the street, and the place and the crowd were certainly more entertaining.

Two of the funnest baseball players I have ever met and I have met quite a few. You tend to know when they are headed out if you are on their tweet list and chat regularly with them, they warn you they are headed to where ever and you better get there before they do ha! Anyway, on to the review this is not a Giants review. The place is pretty big and can crowd up quite fast. It may get crowded but you do not miss getting a drink by going dry, the bar staff keep a close eye on you and when you are a \"chug\" away they have a new drink waiting, this has gotten me into trouble many a time lol.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-08-27", "description": "This is a tough review to write because my expectations are so low for a Marina bar and in some ways Horseshoe fully met those low expectations.  \n\nFor example, it took waay too long to get bar service here.  I would say 8-10 minutes and that was before Anyone on my end of the bar received service.  It wasn't even that busy!  So, management.  Bring in either another bartender or a significant barback.\n\nSecond, the crowd is no better than anywhere else in the Marina.  Meaning, I feel old at 27 and very mature.  Dudes were friendly enough but not buying drinks of course (see: immature). \n\nThird, some bitch pushed my friend for some inane reason.  Honestly, I don't remember, but this chick seriously open palm pushed her.  I think it may have been because my friend was a little stumbly, and I could support an elbow or dirty look, but shove?  (see:immature)\n\nSo, the decent level of stars goes to the bartender that actually ended up taking care of us.  Not only did he almost completely remove his shirt at my request (it was a joke, but I appreciate a man who continues a joke).  He also bought us a round of shots.  Probably because I was coherent and nice to him, had eye contact, you know.  \n\nSo, bartender, two stars for you!", "author": "laura g."}

Of course, as soon as we walked in the joint, we were made aware of the fact that it's a Patriots Bar....Everyone was totally cool, and let me stay and didn't dump their drinks on me.  In fact a few of them even sent drinks over to us....and I am here to write about it so there couldn't have been anything too bad in there.\n\nVery impressed that there was only 1 bartender on site, but she knew her way around the bar and no one was thirsty.  Also,  think it's the perfect size  with a good jukebox and pool tables.  And the bathrooms were clean.  Only downer is that they don't have food, but I guess you can order in.

The selection of spirits is OK.  Being a big scotch drinker, I am satisfied but not impressed.  If they added more snacks, I'd be happier too.  They don't serve anything else but beer nuts, that do come fresh in a bag.\n\nWhen you walk in, you definitely feel some sort of Marina history.

Lots of social clubs use the joint as meeting grounds so every night is a crap shoot for chill or for wildin' out.   \n\nOverall, great place to stumble into for a night cap or a beer.\n\nBathroom sucks.

The backwards baseball caps, baggy jeans, frat boy date-rape mentality are all prevalent at this annoying bar, which reminds me of the trite dives in Isla Vista where I went to college moons ago. The bartenders are forgettable, not there fault, they have to break up a fight or clean up jock vomit so much it's hard to retain friendly focus. So if you crave the obnoxious, crowded dens of your 19 year old fake ID college years, this might be great place to relive those senseless memories, start a fight, and maybe slip a girl a roofie, why my buddy who lives out here likes this place is beyond me, it gets more than one star because they do put up with drunken aforementioned buddy, who on reflection, maybe shouldn't be my buddy!!", "author": "Steve l."}

I've had few shots here, but most people I know who live in the Marina drink elsewhere.

The only thing distinguishing this bar is that it's in the Marina and a BAR-bar, when most of of the other places are swanky swank.  But it's too clean to feel like a fun dive, and the beer isn't even that cheap.  It would be just like any other bar on 99 in Washington or on one of the many interchangeable main streets in the South Bay, except at least in those bars it's fun because you expect to be bored and a little depressed lending to its air of authenticity.  The Horseshoe is all the boringness without the authenticity.\n\nPoints for being an okay bar in one of my least favorite parts of town, and the bartenders are nice, if a bit leery-eyed.\n\nBut it would be more accurate to just bill themselves as \"A slightly less douchey Marina bar.\"", "author": "Ashley B."}

The \"non Marina-Marina bar\" huh? I bet you could ask that as a trivia question in almost any other bar in SF and someone would know the answer. Yet the rest of their ads usually have some dumb statement that's straight Marina Boyesque so I can't tell you whether they're being cheeky or being assholes. It's kind of like how they sell shirts and pairs of choners for ten bucks (look above the bar). \n\nI've only been here a handful of times and I can tell you that have never set foot in there after nightfall. The looming threat of collars turned up, striped/pastel shirts keeps me a way. Even in the afternoon is unavoidable (hey, here's a fashion tip for everyone: if you are male and under 5'5\", a salmon Ralph Lauren polo shirt with its collar up is not a good look for you--it's not a good look for anybody). Last time I was here, John H. pointed out the chew drain along the bar which makes me believe that this bar was here before the Marina (as adjective) was. The divey feel is not too shabby. There are a few standard distractions (TVs, pool table, jukebox) and the casual mix of locals, tourtists and seniors during the afternoon is nice as are bartenders. 2 beers will run you out about ten bucks or so, which is a refreshing change in this part of town.

My friend and I had expected to go to a bonfire that night so we weren't expecting to be hit on (we were in sweatpants and shirts).. but god damn was every man there of every race, age, and stereotype there RUTHLESS. And honestly, you have to pay for the pool tables and fight over them with rude men dressed in silk skirts and scarfs (i'm bi so i totally respect the gay/tranny community, but honeslty, it was so ridiculous, I had to yelp about it), the bar itself was great, they were accomidating to everyones issues, but honestly, it was bullshit. I shouldn't have to fight over who gets next round when me and my partner have held it down all night, that's the rule of pool. Cute guys were everywhere, lack of hot women though I have to say, ladies let's change this for the hotties in their soccer cleats. very sports bar chic.. the guiness was pored amazingly, I would go here again, but with a body gaurd and an abundance of hot women.. because It's lame to have to deal with that shit solo when your tryin to have fun.", "author": "Katie M."}
