An idyllic Saturday for me is walking to the Farmer's Market, going HAM on seasonal produce, and then getting a couple of everything bagels toasted with garlic & herb cream cheese to eat while I sit outside & non-creepily admire how cute the kids in Noe Valley are. \n\nI am also lol at everyone complaining about the whitefish salad and how the coffee isn't artisan. Take a look around. This is not a boughie spot, this IS a spot that nails the bagel basics. There are no Jewish grandmas hand smoking the trout, there ARE hard-working and lovely Chinese bagel mongers that probably get the chip bags at the SOMA Costco because why not?

They are definitely worth paying $1 for when they come out of the oven like that, you cheapskates! With a little cream cheese, it's a meal for a couple of bucks. Come on!\n\nI particularly appreciate that they produce actual bagels here, like onion, sesame, poppy, plain, and salt. For those of you who don't know what an actual bagel is, they also sell some dreck varieties like Asiago roll, Whole Wheat roll, Cinnamon Raisin roll, and Blueberry roll. Those creations are not bagels, just flavored rolls with a hole in the middle, but I guess they gotta carry 'em in this market. \n\nAnd no, they do not have lox, it's nova, which is less salted and not as good.

We're so pleased that we can continue this every Sunday at Holey Bagel!  The bagels here are not bready, but just the right consistency and flavor.  I'm an onion bagel fan, but there are many other choices.  They also have the normal sides to take out and many folks order bagel sandwiches.....", "author": "Michael H."}

If you want yuppy atmosphere & soft round bread, go to the place across the street but these are the real deal. Ask if any flavors are warm now. They open super early & close at 4.", "author": "Paul F."}

I've been going to Noe Bagel down and across the street since it stays open later.  I have to agree with one of the reviewers that the plain bagel with lox trim and cream cheese that I just had tasted like dry normal bread.  It definitely didn't have that bagel kick to it like H&H Bagel NYC or some of the LA bagels that I've had.  There was only one type of lox offering and I was wondering if this stuff was Atlantic farm-raised salmon -- yuck, bad for you!  I much prefer Noe Bagel -- the plain bagel I had was fresh out of the oven, loaded with cream cheese (for those who want just the \"right amount\" -- just say you want less of it).  Isn't it better that Noe Bagel doesn't cheap out and instead offers you more cream cheese than less??  Noe Bagel also has 3 types of lox -- I get the less salty Norvegian lox.  Well that's it for this review.  I will not be returning to Holey Bagel.", "author": "M. J."}
