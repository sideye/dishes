The worker was really kind. He gave us recommendations and assisted us in choosing our glasses of wine. \n\nI liked their menu because they also included quick descriptions of what the wines tasted like. I appreciate that because I don't know too much about wine, thus always confused on what to order when no description is included. I tried the Pinot noir, Carmanere, and the Cabernet Sauvignon. The Pinot noir was first. Ordered it because it was light. Easy to drink but I think I prefer something more rich in flavor. My boyfriend ordered he Cabernet Sauvignon. I liked his more than my Pinot noir. Definitely had a thicker rich color and flavor. The last one the worker suggested the Carmanere to us because it's his favorite. It actually ended up being my favorite of the night as well. The carmanere was almost a hint of sweet and so easy to drink.", "author": "Annie H."}

I honestly don't know much about wine, but whatever red they had for the half-bottle was pretty good. \n\nThe food isn't bad either, but nothing really appealed to me that much. Everything's also pretty pricey for the amount of food and in comparison to the price of the happy hour wine. We shared:\n\n-COD SLIDERS ($10) - 4/5\n2 sliders with avocado, cilantro and sriracha aioli. Not bad. The cod was fried nicely and not too greasy, but the sliders were a little heavy on the aioli for me.\n\n-PESTO FLATBREAD PIZZA ($14) - 3/5\nMeh. Too cheesy it overpowered everything else. Rather oily too and while some pizzas still taste okay when they're no longer warm, this one didn't cool well.

Plenty of unisex bathrooms (this is my big thing - I can't do bars with only one bathroom, nope) that were clean. BTW, this is a vegan place so if you have vegan friends, this will be perfect. The food is vegetarian so if you have picky eaters, this is a good spot to find small, healthy bites. All of the wines are good and standard SF prices (ranging from $9-$14 per glass). They also have a few beers in bottle for non-wine drinkers, and fancy sodas.\n\nThey also host a weekly trivia night on Wednesdays, so I'm looking forward to kicking everyone's ass for that. \n\nI'm glad to find a non-pretentious, non-douche filled bar where I can find a table to sit down and talk to my friends at, so I'm looking forward to going back.", "author": "Logan The H."}

Its also busy enough that you can get distracted by the people watching when you don't have anything to say to each other. \n\nYou can also buy bottles pretty easily and cheap so that if you are in a worst case scenario you can just drink until you forget about where you are. The dark ambiance of the place is perfect and you can talk to you server about the types of wine and their best recommendations. They had a nice selection of sweet wines as well as white wines which are my favorites. \n\nIts not too busy on Market street on the weekdays so it is nice little place to duck into for a quick drink when you don't want to deal with a ton of people being around. There are locals and people on dates and it never feels overwhelming. There is also a back area that is dedicated to large parties and this is perfect place for those awkward tuesday night birthday parties that it is hard to get everyone out for. \n\nOverall Pause doesn't have many frills but it has wine and darkness.

I promise, I won't \"wine\" too much.\n\nBad puns aside, I mean, yeah. This is a legit little place. If you're a wino, I think you will probably fall in love with it. I usually stick to beer or a cocktail, although a nice glass of red is a sweet treat from time to time. This would probably be an excellent spot for Date Night. \n\nI came here for a meetup, and I was the second one to arrive. One waitress seemed a little snippety, although the man working behind the bar was exceptional. He seemed like he might be the owner or manager, or perhaps just a stellar employee. I would definitely order your vino from him, as he smiles and gives you a fair pour. Wish I had asked for his name. \n\nThere are a few happy hour specials on mini carafes of wine, but I just ordered two glasses: a Pinot Noir (from Momo) and a Rose (origin unknown, as I completely forgot). \n\nThey charge tax on glasses of wine, which is strange, as I've never gone to a bar that does so. I was slightly confused when the server told me my total was $14.14  on a $13 glass of wine... yikes. So the next glass of wine (priced at $9) was actually $10.... you get the idea. It's a weird system, but I'm sure it has to be some San Francisco regulation, because I don't know why else they would do so. \n\nHungry? There is a limited bar menu, but it is not a real sit-down restaurant by any means. If you want something substantial, I would suggest dining elsewhere before or after your drinks. I had some of the rosemary fries (sans cheese) and they were delicious! They were neither soggy nor twig-like, but juuust right. The vegan pizza also looked tempting, but I had just eaten a couple of hours beforehand. \n\nBefore you even ask, yes, I did my research and made sure that the wines I was drinking were vegan approved on Barnivore. One can never be too careful. I did appreciate that the owner had called the wineries and found out which ones were vegan, and even highlighted all of them for our browsing convenience! This was a vegan and vegetarian meetup group, so of course all of us were very appreciative of that fact. He went above and beyond and made our evening a success!\n\nI would give them a five, but I'm just not much of a wine drinker. It's nothing personal.

I was also lucky enough to try a sweet potato fry and a regular french fry. Yum! The brussells sprouts also looked amazing so I will 100% go back to try those and I was drooling over some of the flatbreads. Their entire menu is vegetarian, so that was slightly disappointing.

Radiohead's \"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\" was playing through the stereo and boy oh boy I was sold! Any bar that plays Radiohead has got my vote of confidence.\n\nChris at the bar took care of us and answered any questions we had about the menu, and chatted with us throughout our stay at the bar. Two half bottle choices were available for happy hour for $12 each (Chilean Sauvignon blanc & Carmenere). We got both, plus an order of the ARTICHOKE GRATIN ($12). The artichoke gratin took about 20 minutes to make. It had fresh fennel bulb and was sprinkled lightly with a dusting of bread crumbs on top. Quite good, but could have used perhaps a little more salt. We also had the MAC N CHEESE ($10). Melty and cheesy also with a crunchy bread crumb topping but not at all heavy or greasy. Really yummy. The HOUSE-MARINATED OLIVES were warmed and pitted and paired quite well with our wines and artichoke gratin. On top of all that, we were given a small ramekin of the HOUSE-ROASTED SPICED MIXED NUTS. A mildly spicy mix of almonds and walnuts - made for a nice crunchy snack between sips of wine. \n\nThe HH sauv blanc was just what I like - fruity, crisp, and on the drier side - not sweet or cloying. The Carmenere had a rich, full bodied, slightly leathery taste. I highly recommend the sauv blanc if you are looking for something smooth and easily palatable. \n\nThe decor was quite amusing - mural-size chalkboard renditions of a whale and swordfish scene graced the back wall, and smaller doodles of superhero cats and purple bunnies in hot air balloons danced across smaller chalkboard areas around the bar. We were promised that the next time we came, the chalkboard artist would have my favorite animal, the almighty blubbery manatee, chalked onto the wall. \n\nI loved this place and will most definitely love to make it part of my pre-show (symphony, opera, the Herbst, etc) circuit from here-on out.", "author": "Megan L."}

It's now operated by the folks over at Yield Wine Bar, another favorite wine bar of mine (where I happened to have one of the best glasses of wine in memory...check out my review) and they've done a fantastic job of offering a great selection of wine and eats in a cool setting. I was also impressed that they had a decent selection of beer available! Mind you the selection was small, but of course it's a wine bar, so you wouldn't expect it to be big. No, I was just impressed with the types of beers, specifically a few from North Coast, a favorite local-ish brewery (up in Ft. Bragg).\n\nI'll definitely head back here to try some different wines and enjoy the awesome space.", "author": "Melanie N."}

I'd looked into a dozen venues before we decided on Pause, and the reason we chose it was that the owner, Chris, was super friendly, accommodating, and flexible, and the entire staff was really nice. Also, for our particular date, there was no minimum or deposit required in advance which was great since we weren't sure how many people we'd have.\n\nOur group ended up being about 50 people, and Chris sectioned off the back portion of the bar so that we essentially had a private space. There was a big shelf for our friends to put purses and jackets, as well as plenty of seating for those who wanted it. We had a dedicated bartender (his name was Grant, and he was awesome), and they let us bring in our own cakes without charging an outrageous cutting fee. Overall, the whole staff worked to make sure we had a great time, and we did. Many thanks to Chris and crew! We'll definitely be back.", "author": "Julie C."}

Chris and the team have got the vibe and ambience right - interior design strikes a great balance between hip/industrial and warm/intimate wine bar.  \n\nWe had a couple of bottles of the Argentinian Syrah, which was very good and at a great price point.  Most wines on the list are organic, and all are from eco-friendly producers.  This is normally a reason for me to be wary, but having been offered tastes of two other wines on their list and being green crusaders, they did not disappoint.\n\nThe food was stellar - we had the warm olives, burrata with strawberries, and salmon fettucine carbonara... all of which were full of flavor.  The fettucine sauce itself was a little over-salty, but the use of cured salmon instead of cured ham/pancetta was a creative twist.  We finished with the chevre-stuffed dates with chili oil and molasses, which had a good balance of sweet, savory, and a peppery kick.\n\nThere was a birthday party going on in the rear section of the bar, which undoubtedly added ambience and energy.  That said, it's a great place to host a small gathering or birthday for around 30-40 people - the space is intimate yet private at the same time, and with no bar tab minimum I'll be looking to book it in the near future.\n\nService was personal, warm, and friendly; yet, unintrusive - a pretty tough balance for most places in SF to strike.

When I asked for a to go box for the one thing I did like, they said they'd run out. Not a big deal, but c'mon, get your shit together, little wine-bar-that-could. OH! And they really should get rid of the racist graffiti in the bathroom. \n\nThey need to professionalize some before I go back. The lack of polish is kind of cute at Yield, but not so much here.", "author": "Hopey N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-05", "description": "Had a really nice dinner. Relaxed atmosphere created by the soft lights, a food menu and wine list which are not very long but carefully assembled.\n\nLoved the mussels with hot pepper and Thai basis, a well balanced, flavorsome disk. The Chardonnay from Hawkes (Sonoma), also defied my stereotype of northern California  Chardonnay being big, flat and excessively round\n\nGood selection of mature cheeses to conclude.\n\nWould definitely recommend, especially for couples or a small group of friends", "author": "Lorenzo C."}

A bunch came out to before we headed out for an event nearby and the staff was super accomodating and chilled out! their happy hour deals are great with carafes and bites! go give them a shot, you will love them as much as we did, can't wait to go back :)", "author": "sue c."}

The place was buzzing but we managed to find a table soon enough.  The staff are delightful--young, knowledgeable, friendly--obviously happy to be part of the business.\n\nI usually ask for recommendations, and the petite sirah I was poured was big, bold and delicious, just what I had asked for.  We sampled several menu items--the trio of fish, the crostinis, the papas bravas, the artichokes...and the big favorite--the hiramasa crudo.  So good we ordered a second round.\n\nI've been to Yield, and love that neighborhoody, intimate, service-focused wine bar...and I am so happy the owners were able to translate the best of Yield to the larger buzzing Pause.  Already looking forward to my next visit at both places.", "author": "Kathy D."}

Sandwiched between Espetus and Zuni, this wasn't our first choice for the evening and we thought we'd stay just for some small plates but when we saw the prix fixe menu, we decided to stay.  It was wonderful -- the wine pairings were perfect accents to a well paced, well presented, delicious 4 course meal.  I especially liked the mouth watering tuna with the viognier.   I'll definitely return -- wonderful service too!", "author": "ellen r."}

The wine selection is pretty good, but the cheese selection is underwhelming. What I dislike about this place most is how dark and sterile the ambience is. It's also quite load, even though the tables are spread out quite well. Just a good neighborhood place to stop by after work.", "author": "Scott S."}

For the record, the stuffed dates are sublime.  The wine list, while not long, gave us plenty of new wines to try.  This is my new favorite spot.", "author": "Rhea H."}

I'd definitely go back but would also like to try their other bar \"Yield\" to see the difference, if any.  it's listed on the other side of the match books.", "author": "Carla F."}

The food was a little random but a few months ago it was amazing so perhaps they were just having an off night.", "author": "H N."}
