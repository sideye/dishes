I came right when they opened at 11 and there were already a few customers trickling behind me. I ordered the porchetta and the chicken grec. The porchetta came with arugula and a good amount of meat. The chicken grec was saucy and flavorful. I really appreciate the bread in the chicken grec, not too tough on my teeth, but soft and also crisp enough :). I tried the cucumber shrub which is a bubbly drink. My bf thought it tasted too similar to pickles, but I didn't think so. I liked the drink but would rather try their other flavors like guava! \n\nParking isn't easy around here. The entire block is metered unless you get lucky on the street (2hr parking w/o residential permit). I'd come back and try their other sandwiches. Everything and anything from Belinda is good and worthwhile. If you haven't, I recommend walking over to B patisserie!!", "author": "Debby N."}

Simplistic store that gives it a modern appearance. Accomplishes exactly what you look for in a quick stop for lunch. \n\nPork belly banh mi: big slab of fatty pork belly right in the center of the sandwich with savory pickled carrots and daikon. Topped off with a kick from the jalepeno and cilantro. Baguette was soft on the inside and crunchy on the out, but did leave a few sore spots on my palate typical in eating a banh mi. \n\nPorchetta: savoury, fatty, and moist. Pork was shredded in the ciabatta type bread and covered with an assortment of vegetables. \n\nReally impressed with the sandwich and keeps me wondering what the B stands for.

It's my go-to lunch spot in Pac Heights because it has more substantial food than the pastries galore at b.pat and is far more reasonably priced than the gluten-free pretentiousness of As Quoted. \n\nAs the name implies, B on the Go specializes in lunch items such as sandwiches, soups, salads, and fancy shrub drinks with a small but enticing pastry case of giant cookies, canales, olive oil madeleines, etc. For those who are really on the go, they have a basket of prepared sandwiches and boxed salads.\n\nThe CHICKEN GREC is a popular sandwich with rotisserie chicken and yogurt sauce sprinkled generously with dill for a pleasantly earthy dimension. The chicken was simple but good, succulent but without much roasty rotisserie robustness. Frankly I was more impressed with the dill yogurt sauce, which accompanied the fresh bread well.\n\nI couldn't say no to PORCHETTA ($10.75). It was the best of all worlds, with pork as tender as pork belly and crispy skin that reminded me of Chinese roast pork. The house ciabatta was wonderfully soft, and the salsa verde tasted like chimichurri. It could have used more arugula, but overall I think I actually like it more than Roli Roti because the meat is warmed on the grill and isn't as salty. \n\nThe GRILLED CHEESE ($8) was simple perfection. They cleverly use a flat bread and fold it over the cheese and mushrooms, so it's shaped like a quesadilla. The thin toasty bread is extra crispy, contrasting the melty filling made even heartier with mushroom duxelle.\n\nI think my least favorite item were the ROASTED BRUSSEL SPROUTS ($4), mainly because there was too much of a mayo-like sauce on top. (So much for attempts to be healthy) The lemoniness was a fitting addition to the Brussel sprouts, but again it was overpowering. It didn't help that I had decided to get this with the tomato bisque, so it was sour on sour. I am still a fan of the lemon/parmesan/anchovy roasted Brussel sprouts idea, but the execution definitely needs more balance.\n\nThe TOMATO BISQUE ($4) had good flavor, except it was scalding hot. I actually burnt the roof of my mouth trying to eat the hot, soup-soaked croutons so that they wouldn't get soggy. Oh, first world problems... \n\nAnother popular item is the ARLETTE ($3), apparently made from the same dough as the legendary kouign aman. It does indeed have a delightful flakiness, now in crispy form and tasting like cinnamon toast crunch. I do think it's a bit too sugary, but otherwise a memorable dessert. \n\nThe giant cookies are enticing as well, and I have tried a CHERRY OATMEAL TOFFEE cookie. It's quite sweet with cherries throughout and caramelized from the toffee, making a very satisfying dessert. You enjoy a nice texture from the oatmeal (also gives you an excuse because oatmeal is good for you.) \n\nThe ambiance is quite unique (and not hipster for once!) featuring wooden tables/chairs, an open-air kitchen, and a painting of a perky pig so cute that you will definitely feel guilty eating porchetta here :x There are even hoof prints painted on the other wall! \n\nService is friendly and the food is prepared within a reasonable amount of time, though it could take longer than expected due to mobile orders and catering. \n\n*Closed on Mondays, which is unfortunately the day most in need of grab-and-go gourmet lunches :3", "author": "Edna C."}

I've tried many well-known fried chicken sandwich (8 to 10 different) places in San Francisco. None of them even came close to the quality and price of the Fried chicken sandwich at B on the Go. Each sandwich came with a huge piece of thigh meat (1 to 2-inch-thick), fried perfectly (juicy inside) with a cheddar cheese and I think sausage gravy. They sold the sandwich at $10, which was a steal. Could have been sold easily for $15 (considering the mark up everywhere in SF). The Fried chicken sandwich would kill any competition in the city. I'm writing this review to give the chef props (I think it was the guy with the short mohawk). That fried chicken sandwich was d@mn good. Seriously underappreciated and could easily stand-alone by itself. I liked it as much as the cheese burger from Ricky Bobby when it did exist. I hesitated to write a review on the fried chicken sandwich because I thought it might become too popular and it would run out by the time I would get there on the weekend.  \n\nI went last weekend to discover the sandwich has been discontinued. Deeply sadden by this news. Please bring it back or encourage the guy to bring it back somewhere else so everyone else can enjoy it again. I think the fault was the marketing of the sandwich. You would never know it existed. Only if you walked into the restaurant and read it on a paper by the register.

The menu is simple and not overloaded, a couple of fairly conservative takes on classic sandwiches. The baked goods here are different and simpler than the flagship bakery. As a Viet person, banh mi isn't the same outside of a hole in the wall setting and doesn't quite ring right with high quality meats (cha lua is usually some mystery meat) or ingredients. b.'s take on it a simple, tasty sandwich that isn't a California fusiony watered down version. \n\nYou can also get the sandwiches as a salad for $1 extra. Chicken salads are as basic an item you can get, but b. is one of my favorite in SF. Rotisserie chicken was juicy, flavorful, perfect yogurt tzatziki sauce, right about of greens and other stuff. The only thing I would change were the tomatoes were those pulpy neutered flavorless kind that you throw on burgers. Had it been heirloom or more flavorful, it would have been the perfect salad. Love that the salad option is there to balance out the carb overload from the baked goods at the neighboring patisserie if you're as gluttonous as I am made stops at both :)\n\nI went at a slow time but impressed by the fast service. The food was out almost immediately after ordering. Props for that. Communal table, sunny atmosphere, nice service, pretty good price for a solid lunch or brunch option.

The porchetta ($11.50) had bits of crisp skin and nice moist bits of pork, but the salsa verde was too sour.  The salsa verde made me not want more than a few bites.

I would definitely get this if I wanted something really light to tide me over.  Friendly and quick service.

The bread was chewy and dense, not airy and crisp. The bread was slathered with gobs of American mayonnaise. There was some kind of caramel-fish sauce musk sprayed in one spot of the sandwich to clear my sinuses, and while it was mercifully absent from the remaining bites, so was any flavor apart from rice vinegar carrot sticks. The pork belly was well-cooked so as not to be chewy or rubbery, but its flavor was indiscernible.\n\nI may not be Vietnamese, but I've eaten enough banh mi to know that this was a really sad rendition of one.\n\nAdding insult to injury, they were blaring '80s music for the benefit of the 4 patrons suffering through our late lunches.

I think Belinda realized that the patrons of B Patisserie, across the way, were occasionally saturating their palates with so much sugar from her utterly magnificent desserts that their taste buds were begging for a savory balance. \nAnd it turns out that the woman is multi-talented: she can create a kouign amann that looks like a toasted golden flower and melts in your mouth like flaky, sugary magic AND she can create a filling, delicious, fresh-tasting sandwich. Do her sandwiches make my taste buds go into fits of ecstasy, like her pastries do? Nope. Are they the best sandwiches in SF? Not by a long shot (though take into account the pretty insane competition--SF might as well stand for Sandwich Fest). Do they have exciting, never-before-seen, creative options? Nope. Do they have amazing bread, considering B's baking talents? Nope. But are they definitely the best in the area, in a super convenient location where they have zero competition, in a pretty space with attentive, cheerful servers? Yes. \nThe best sandwich we have tried so far is the Chicken Grec, which has very juicy chicken and an herbed mayo that tastes garden-fresh. That's been the best thing about these sandwiches--very fresh-tasting ingredients that taste healthy in the top-quality, nutritious, fresh way rather than the low-cal way. They're also very good sizes--not too massive and not so small you're hungry a moment later. Their grilled cheese sandwich has gotten some hype, but it's only so-so. The bread for that one is pretty cool, though--it's a round, flat bread that looks somewhat like a crepe (though bread-like rather than pancake-like) and it works nicely. If you're a fan of the absolute, most traditional style of grilled cheese then you'll love this one. As someone more interested in a little pizazz, like exciting cheeses or the addition of roasted mushrooms, I was underwhelmed. \nAdded bonus: desserts from B Patisserie are on display as well, so you can get your fix there without waiting in line forever across the street--though the options are more limited. I'm really liking this place right now, and will perhaps love it once their menu expands into more exciting, original options and once it stays open longer--the short hours (11--4) sorta bug me.", "author": "Ali M."}

I was served the Brussels sandwich with the side of Brussels sprouts. But when I pointed it out they were quick to switch out for the porcetta I was craving.", "author": "Curt B."}

Especially since I think their pastries is one of the best, if not THE BEST. Was going to order the chicken grec, looks delicious from all the pictures. Changed my mind and got a banh mi. Definitely doesn't compare to a real sandwich restaurant like Dinosaurs. But nonetheless it was ok. Lacked a lot of the amazing flavors it needs. Girlfriend ordered the Cubano, which she was literally jumping up in down for, until she ate it. She said it was missing the tart taste of the mustard. Next time, I have to try their chicken grec to see what the bees are buzzing for.", "author": "nick r."}

I really recommend the potatoes, the chicken sandwich with yoghurt and cilantro sauce and the porcetta. The home made drinks are very tasty and refreshing. Make sure you leave room for a decadent cookie. The space is filled with intoxicated aromas and friendly staff.", "author": "Sonali M."}

But I had the tuna melt which was tasty (though it would have been nice with a small salad). And the bahn mi salad my fianc\u00e9 ordered was also great", "author": "Kaego R."}

BUT...S........L......O......W..... service..They need to get rid of mr. man-bun.... he is inept!!! It took 35 minutes for me to get 2 sandwiches togo... and these were not even the hot sandwich...The man needs to be retrained or move on to something he is more suitable to do. 1) There are 5 customers in front of me.... took me 15 mins just to get to the order ... lucky for him, the cash register crash and the manager-like lady took over... the line behind me grew to about 12+  people. In less than 10 mins, she shrank the line to just 1.... meanwhile, I am waiting waiting for my sandwiches... bahn mi and the porchetta. The man in front of me got his sandwich... 3 people behind got their sandwiches.... i am still waiting for mines..... finally, man-bun called me and another customer.... he gets ready to give me mines, but the other customer starts asking him for something..... he stops getting my sandwiches ready to give to me and tend to the other customer...WTF....... take care of the customer one at a time and take care of the one who was there waiting already..... his response ....\"i'm doing the best I can'.... if that is that best, then don't bother coming here for a quick lunch.... it will take at least 35 minutes to get ur sandwich ....... I get that it's a new place and they may be working out the 'kinks'.... standing there for 35 min, i had plenty time to watch the movement of the staff....everyone but one seems to move pretty quickly....", "author": "Jay S."}

The grilled cheese, banh mi, and chicken grecco sandwiches are all to die for. They are nice and quick and each sandwich is somehow better than the last. It wouldn't hurt you to add a madeleine for a dessert snack either. Enjoy! You can't go wrong!", "author": "Lindsey H."}

But, we were so disappointed!  We ordered the Mushroom Grilled Cheese.  After waiting 15 minutes, we were happy to receive our sandwiches, then so surprised when we discovered a soggy cold sandwich!  When we picked up half the sandwich, the filling fell through the soggy bread, and the sandwich fell apart. And it was not appetizing cold. I think they must have forgotten about the sandwiches after they took them off the grill. I know it's just a sandwich, but it was a huge disappointment (and almost $10 a sandwich).", "author": "P C."}

The yogurt herbed mayo was to die for.  Today I finally had it again.....and it was a bit different.  This time the sandwich had way more chicken and less of the yummy sauce. Wish it could go back to the way it was.", "author": "Robyn H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-19", "description": "Ate at B on the Go today. We ordered the Cubana, Tuna and Porchetta. The Cubana was great. The bread was soft and cheese melted just right. Great ham and pork and pickles and mustard. Perfection. The Porchetta needs a lot of help. The menu says it comes with salsa verde on the sandwich. I could find none. It was tasteless. The pork was extremely fatty and so grizzled.  Whoever is cooking the Porchetta needs to understand that the pork needs to be tasty and moist and just full of flavor. I was very disappointed. The Porchetta truck at The Embarcadero on Saturday's has a much better sandwich. Other then the disappointing Porchetta it was great. The staff is organized and the restaurant is clean and they have a good system for ordering.", "author": "Debbie P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-08-05", "description": "I really, really wanted to love this place since I work form home & live around the corner.  I was so disappointed with the amount of meat/lack of flavor in the Cubano sandwich - all you can taste is bread.  My friend also go the Chicken Grec, which had more filling but the taste was just ok.  There was just nothing to love or rave about, including the service.  I waited 10 minutes for my sandwich & wished so badly that they served espresso drinks.  When I asked about lattes, I was told (with attitude! perhaps they get this question a lot?) that I could go across the street to get one from the original location.  Say what?!?  Did they really just suggest that I go across the street & wait in line another 10 minutes during my lunch hour???  I can only get away from my desk for an hour at lunch-- maximum.  Do I want to spend my lunchtime shuffling from one shop to another?  Nah.  Not worth it.    Honestly, I don't know how they have gotten so many 5 star reviews.  The sandwiches are just average.  I expected they would be as good as Bi-Rite's, then I would definitely keep coming back for more.  The original B is fantastic, but so disappointed that this shop misses the mark on sandwiches, lunchtime atmosphere & friendly service.", "author": "Mika D."}
