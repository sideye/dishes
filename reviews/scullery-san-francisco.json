It sounds like my childhood. \"Yes, Mommy, I'm in the closet. I'm not getting crumbs on your chinchilla.\" This place showed up on the Yelp app as a place to have breakfast in the 'Loin. I figured it was going to be a greasy spoon coffee shop with a cigarette dangling from the cook's mouth. But no, it's a much classier affair with a marble countertop, white subway tiles, and reclaimed wood beams to sit at. The challenge occurs when there are more than four customers and you have to find an open place to take your order. Did I mention it's in the Tenderloin?\n\nThey serve Five Mountains teas, make all the usual suspects with Sightglass Coffee, and use Recchuiti chocolate in their mochas and hot chocolates. Fancy. I ordered a $3.50 Cafe au Lait which met my immediate caffeine needs (photo: http://bit.ly/2OVRct5). For breakfast, they serve nine different toasts as well as daily specials like English breakfast and pesto eggs. Toasts range from plain with salted butter to Smoked Trout to Welsh Rarebit with ham and chutney. I wasn't feeling entirely adventurous and went with the $8 Avocado Toast drizzled with garlic oil and rock salt (photo: http://bit.ly/2LbHnEJ).

Apparently Scullery had the best toast of SF! We took her word for it and walked up the street to Scullery's little hole in the wall. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you can appreciate the cute little shop (and its awesome logo!), you get wafts of the freshly delivered bread and you look to a chalk board to see what to order. Two friends and I each ended up getting different toasts. I got the smoked trout, another got the avocado toast and the other got a shakshuka-like toast with lots of  waterey tomato topped with an egg. We were all kind of underwhelmed to be honest. The trout was pretty dry and overly salty, the tomatoes really runny and making it uncomfortable to eat, only the avocado toast seemed decent. Maybe the basic toast was the way to go? \n\nIn any case, as soon as we were done, we kind of regretted not having our lunch at Bandit next door, those burgers looked amazing.", "author": "Jobye-Kyle K."}

And with the conflicting feelings of San Francisco gentrification and hipster revelation, I can't help but feel that (in a whisper's voice) it's kind of a cool thing that this kind of newness is taking over... minus any snooty pretentiousness or the drones of \"yo, bro!\" from crowds of yuppies, but of course. Oh no. Here at Scullery, you get a good blend of modern and easy coolness, an eclectic mix of earth and industrial. This tiny coffee shop is as neutral and as \"Can't we all just get along?\" as it gets.  \n\nHere is where Old SF and New SF can unite. \n\nMy order:\n\nSpicy Plum Toast - This toast was a thicker cut and served nice and warm. I decided on the spicy plum jelly, not too sweet, really delicious. Since the toast was warm, the jelly seeped right into every cranny. YUM!\n\nNitro Cold Brew - I like my coffee just plain black and bold, this was right up my alley. The sun was out and it was a bit warm, so the cold brew was refreshing. Great contrast to the sweetness from the spicy plum jelly.\n\nAvocado Toast - Fresh and filling. The avocado was ripened to perfection, not too soft and can stand on its own. The garlic oil and simple sea salt along with the cracked pepper were a perfect addition. This bread was also of a thicker cut. \n\nAmericano - I got mine with a quadruple shot. This did the trick. It was strongggggg\n\nService was quick and helpful. They do have some items that are rotating on their menu, so what may be available one week, may not be the next.

I didn't get my morning cup so I had to try some of their's. While San Francisco has a HUGE amount of good coffee shops, (I haven't even tried half yet...) this new one is worth going to more than once. \n\nScullery is located on Geary Street in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. The parking situation is mostly street parking. There's always parking in the Union Square Garage or the O'Farrell Garage. I always like the O'Farrell one just because they valet on each floor and that wastes less time. I like to get in and get out in the most minimum amount of time. (wasting time is a pet peeve of mine...hehe.) \n\nScullery is by definition a small room or part of the kitchen where washing up and preparation is done. That is exactly what the space looks like; except with some modern touches. (aesthetically clean.) This coffee shop reminds me of the ones in Manhattan, small enough to seat 4 to 5 customers. Customers can come and get a cup with a pastry to go. They brew with beans from Sightglass and feature pastries from Jane's. They had some huge chocolate croissants and plain ones which I totally wanted, but was still full from lunch. Next time! \n\nI ordered myself a Burnt Caramel Latt\u00e9 which seemed like an interesting flavor. I must warn everyone though that this latt\u00e9 is VERY sweet. It's more of a dessert-like espresso drink. I could definitely taste the caramel in it. For people with a sweet tooth, this would be a good pick for sure. I had to get a cup of water for myself.

The butter makes the center a wee bit soggy, but then the sugar kind of melted into it there and I could not complain. \n\nSo why four stars only? The hot chocolate. Of course this place is a coffee shop primarily and so it's understandable that the coffee is the priority. But for non-coffee drinkers like me, hot chocolates have become a go to option when friends wanna hit up a coffee shop. The hot chocolate here was waaaaaay too watered down, you legitimately can barely taste the chocolate. It feels like you're drinking warm chocolate water rather than hot chocolate and that's not a good look. Next time I go I wanna try to kombucha, and mention that they should maybe rework how they make the hot chocolate. \n\nOverall, super cute place with yummy food and good coffee. I think it's a great addition to the neighborhood!", "author": "Kristen T."}

They use high quality products (the chutneys), the bread is delicious with filled with seeds and other grains, and they have sweet and savory choices for the toast.\n\nThe place is really tiny with only about 8 seats so if you're planning to come here on a date or with more than 2 people, you may want to try somewhere else. There's not a lot of seating and it's all bar seating along the wall/window, so it's not somewhere to come and eat/do work for hours on end.\n\nIt's not necessarily cheap but the ingredients are all excellent, so it warrants the higher prices. The burnt caramel latte ($5) is made with Recchiuti caramel - you can find their shop at the Ferry Building and it tastes delicious - so unlike the syrupy, overly sweet caramel lattes you get at Starbucks. If you like caramel and coffee, get this latte - you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe avocado toast ($8) was really good - I liked the bread a lot: pretty hearty with seeds/grains for more wholesome bread. The avocado was sliced and there was a generous amount - it was tasty with the garlic oil, salt, and pepper. I'm still partial to the avocado toast at Jane because I love the pickled onions and the poached egg. But this is a close second or third to Jane -- I also like Provender in Potrero for avocado toast.\n\nI'll definitely come back here again for coffee and toast. Can't wait to try the one with cheese, and chutney - there are so many different variants to try. I'd give this 4.5 stars, taking off 0.5 stars because it's a little cramped/crowded and the food will take 5-10 min to make (so plan accordingly if you're in a hurry).

Still, the toast comes out well done and mine had a nice crunch. I had mine topped with raspberry jam and salted butter. There was a proper jam to butter ratio allowing for a great balance between the two toppings and the bread. The grain filled bread was the true star.

You order at the counter - menu has all the coffee drinks you'd expect but I usually go for a cup of PG Tips tea. If there's a stool free to sit at, say you want your order 'for here' and your hot drink comes served in a cute yellow cup and saucer with a little spoon that looks like it came from your granny's silverware drawer. If you're hungry do not miss a chance to order a Welsh Rarebit toast - and you get to pick from a half dozen yummy chutneys they'll add on top. They also have avocado toast and PB and J. Everything is quick and scrumptious. Totally recommend you stop here when you're in the neighborhood!", "author": "Sonya S."}

The suns' warm glare is shining through the window and leaves flutter outside.  I just had a cup of rich, full bodied coffee and a fabulously delicious, generously sized slice of fresh bread slathered in butter and cinnamon + sugar.  WHAT a lovely way to spend a Sunday morning.  \nScullery just opened it's doors on the floor level of my apartment building.  On the corner of Geary and Leavenworth, this cafe is an oasis in the Tenderloin.  I've only found two other really good coffee shops in the TL, and they're a significant walk away (too far for a lazy morning when I'm not ready to fully engage with the city).  Most cafe's in the neighborhood offer overpriced, Folgers grade coffee, and stale and underwhelming pastries (Egregious, really). \n\nThus far I've only tried their drip coffee and cinnamon sugar toast.  Both were amazing- the toast is on par with (maybe even better?) The Mill, Jane, Philz, Dottie's True Blue, etc. I look forward to trying every other thing on their menu.  Next on my list, the Tenderloin Cold Brew and Avocado toast. \n\nTo sum it up: Super Stoked (!!) this place is here.  Quality (and pricing) is competitive with the best and most notable cafe's in the city, honestly.  \n\nOwners: PLEASE offer larger sizes of coffee. Pretty pretty please. I will legit promise to buy coffee from you 3-5x per week if you begin offering a large size.  \n\nThank you! 5 Stars!", "author": "William M."}

Instead, it's because of the people that work here. The owners  work alongside their employees. Employee is the wrong word, because it like they are one big family. \n\nThe atmosphere here is like I've been transported to another country, but in a good way. \n\nCome support this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-02", "description": "My husband and I were excited to try The Scullery during our weekend getaway in San Francisco. We came across this quaint cafe while searching nearby breakfast spots on Yelp. It's a tiny spot in the Tenderloin district of SF (only seats about 8 adults) with a small, yet varied coffee/tea and toast menu. \n\nWe each ordered Sightglass coffee and avocado toast. Though pricy ($8 each + extra to add an egg), the avocado toast comes with a hearty portion of avocado with a nice hint of garlic oil and salt/pepper. The toast typically comes buttered, but I ordered mine without. I really enjoyed the bread from The Midwife and the Baker...yum! The coffee was well brewed. \n\nWe sat right near the area where the toast is made and could see that it was cramped quarters for the workers and looked a bit messy. I noticed that some of the products they use (i.e. almond butter) are Trader Joe's brand, which isn't a bad thing though would make me think twice about paying for toast I could make at home! \n\nOverall, I'm glad we tried it and a good spot when in the mood to splurge on toast.", "author": "Erica P."}

Happy to have a new place to get a good coffee and a quick snack on my neighborhood. The coffee was fantastic, and I really enjoyed Welsh Rarebit, especially with Allison McQuade's chutney (both her are her chutney are the best!) . However, I'm sorry to report that their Avocado Toast left something to be desired, mainly ripe avocados. The avocado was completely hard, so much so that I didn't want to eat it, and when I told them they didn't offer to make me anything else or give a refund. It seemed like they were aware of this problem because he admitted that they are still trying to figure out where to source their produce from. I hope they are able to figure this out soon because I am very hopeful about the place.
