Service prompt, portions good, soup great, but fairly horrible main dish. Oilier than Rockefeller, bland and very tough over cooked meat. On the plus side, 3 big steamed broccoli stalks to help clear it through the colon. \n\nPleasant decoration behind the bar, looks like several beers on tap. Plenty of seating- and with the quality of this food I'm not surprised much of it was empty. \n\nThe Thai place across Fillmore is pretty good, next time I'll not be sidetracked trying to find another winner.

I got my order to go- I wasn't expecting much, but I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as it was. I ordered the sesame chicken off of the lunch menu, which comes with steamed rice and soup. I started with the soup- I could tell by the smell that it was over spiced w/black pepper, and boy was I right. The taste of the black pepper over powered the soup. I couldn't enjoy it at all.\nThe sesame chicken was just as disappointing, if not moreso. The chicken was incredibly dry/tough, and the sauce tasted pretty off. The bed of greens the chicken was placed on seemed insanely wilted/old. This was not a result of being exposed to the heat. Even if it was, the greens shouldn't have seemed as wilted as they were. I went there shortly after they opened for lunch, and the food did not seem fresh *at all*. The only decent thing about the meal was the steamed rice and the fortune cookie (which isn't saying much). :|\nI typically will give places a second try if it doesn't move me the first time around but I don't see that happening here.

I'm not able to view their menu online without starting the ordering process which is a bummer.\n-I do remember the dish was decent and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was made to be imitation meat. It wasn't the best Chinese food I've had but it was fine.\n-Delivery was quick and ordering online was easy.\n\nRestaurant Experience: 2 stars\n-My boyfriend and I were seated immediately as there was only one other person eating in the restaurant.\n-We ordered the Crab Rangoons, Chow Fun with Chicken, and the Kung Pao Chicken. The Crab Rangoons were 90% cream cheese and 10% crab-still good but better described as \"cream cheese rangoons.\" My boyfriend said the Kung Pao was really good and tasted fresh but I was very disappointed in the Chow Fun. There was a sparse sprinkling of bean sprouts and green onions and it was pretty bland. Not terrible but not memorable.\n-Service was really odd. Our waitress didn't seem to understand what we were saying and when trying to order. When we were signing the check she came over, realized we weren't done, and then speed-walked away super fast.

The fact of the matter is, I have no intention of ordering from Wonderland again and I am pretty disappointed that they are going back on what they told me over the phone.

That's what John Mayer told me, but then he dumped me for Jennifer Aniston and it got ugly... wait a sec, am I mistaking my life story for a National Enquirer story I read once? It wouldn't be the first time. Anyway, this wonderland is more of a culinary adventure, the kind where Alice falls though the rabbit hole and turns into a vegetarian much to the contemptuous disdain of the Red Queen. This spacious place is pretty new with a prime location right at the corner of Fillmore and Haight, and like Eric's in Noe Valley, Wonderland reminds me of Eliza's when it was a good, fresh alternative to all those other Chinese restaurants with their nondescript brown sauces.\n\nI decided to go full-blown veg there and ordered the $9.95 Garlic Meatless Chicken. It was deliciously hearty with big chunks of I-don't-know-what (seitan maybe?) tasting quite savory with a nice texture that really made me not miss the real thing. The meatless chunks were mixed with peppers and leeks, and I just think it's prepared with more panache than you would expect. I complemented that dish with the $8.95 plate of Garlic Pea Sprouts, a favorite of mine that I can never seem to find at Asian restaurants (last time was probably a trip to Le Cheval in Oakland). Even though there was probably a tad too much sesame oil in it, the freshness of the sprouts really satisfied my craving (see photo).\n\nAlong with some brown rice, that was it for my maiden voyage to Wonderland with no sign of the Mad Hatter unless you count the knit-capped street guy who rolled by the window with his squeaky shopping cart. But I'm definitely coming back and bringing Jamie W. along so we can order the Walnut Prawns or the Roast Duck. But alas, what am I thinking with our flexitarian diets staring at our bellies? Guess I'll take a deeper look at the Healthy Food Options section where there's enough steamed vegetable dishes to choke Richard Simmons. By the way, the service is buzzsaw-prompt with quite a few staff running around getting ready for the incoming parties who came after me. I agree that a Chinese restaurant this good should be patronized and frequently.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...surprisingly satisfying meatless options served here\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...still quite new and pretty spacious for the area\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...highly attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...perhaps my body will be a wonderland if I continue eating meatless...in your face, John Mayer", "author": "Ed U."}

(I think). On the other hand, this place feels trendy, upscale, and even a little elegant.

When we asked about it, he said he thought we wanted a spicy soup and brought this one instead of the less spicy beef version (what?). Aside from that, the Chow Mian and Pork dishes were very good but also fairly standard. \n\nThe pork cutlet is served as chopped chunks on the bone, and cooked in a thick plum sauce. The Chow Mian seemed less greasy than a lot of places I've had it, and it had a nice variety of fresh ingredients. I'm not sure what soup I ended up with, but I did appreciate that the waiter portioned it out for us at our table. The tomato-based soup was spicy and pretty tasty, and I liked the chunks of fish.

I loved everything we got. I'm not sure if we just got lucky but it was all really good. I highly recommend this place. It's a bit more \"American-ized\" though so if you're looking for traditional this is not the place to go. The staff is really sweet and nice. It was easy to get a table around 7 on a Friday night. I didn't try them, but I was super surprised how vegetarian friendly this place was. They had a ton of meatless options. Parking though is a bit difficult I will say so if you muni it here, that's probably more ideal as it took me a long time to find any parking.", "author": "Julie L."}

Eating inside and takeout (both ordered online and through the phone) has always been delicious and satisfying. But we love going in to eat because the employees are extremely kind! I love supporting their business, they deserve it.\n\nWe've gotten to try lots of things here and there since its opening. Here's a rundown of my favorites\n\n1. Basil Eggplant w/ Prawns & Chicken - flavorful and a great combination!\n2. Walnut prawns - not a dish I recommend to have as your own plate because it is sweet if that's all you're eating (I don't mind it, but know others might). Wonderful in combination with  many other plates when eating with a large group.\n3. Dry braised meatless chicken - yummy and interesting flavor. They're like meatballs!\n4. Broccoli beef - classic takeout, always good.\n5. General Tsao chicken - crunchy fried chicken, very delicious.\n6. Vegetable Brown fried rice - THE BEST, we get this every single time.\n\nI love sticking to my favorites, and want to try some new choices soon.", "author": "Eli P."}

I have never had General Tsao's before, because I've been a vegetarian since I was 14. My companion ordered this dish and he said it was \"pretty close to the real thing\". The fake chicken wasn't too like real chicken, which for me was a major plus. Very big menu, which makes me wonder, but it turned out to be far and away the best meal we ate in San Francisco. We did order the side of rice (extra $) but it was really unnecessary. \n\nI ordered the kung pao fake chicken. It was quite good, but after tasting the General Tsao's I pretty much abandoned my dish. \n\nService was extremely prompt. We ordered the General Tsao's a few days later as carry out. My only complaint was that they were skimpy on the vegetables.

I thought the prices to be reasonable, portions are large, and the service is good - not a restaurant worth traveling across the city for but a good option for Chinese if you are in the area.  \n\nFood-wise two dishes I would recommend are the Sizzling Rice Soup and the Szechuan fish.  The soup was probably the most interesting dish of the night - they serve up with a bit of flair (the waiter comes by douses the puffed rice in the scalding hot soup) and it turned out to be simple but good.  Our next favorite was the Szechuan fish - the flavors were good, veggies crisp, and dish void of massive amounts of oil and msg.  \n\nA dish to avoid is the faux-meat Orange Chicken.  While the sauce is pretty good, the fake chicken leaves something to be desired, coming in heavily fried and very uniformly shaped spheres - I would not be surprised if they got the fake meat frozen or canned from May Wah in the Richmond.  I think what really throws the dish off is that each piece has too much fake meat and too little sauce - they need some non-spherical fake meat so that there's more nooks and crannies for the sauce to cling to.  Ahem...a higher surface area to volume ratio, if you will...that's right, I just dropped a little geometry in my review.  \n\nAll in all a decent choice for Chinese but my search continues for a great Chinese restaurant in SF!", "author": "Rosers M."}

'S Wonderland*.\n\nThis is an exceptionally good neighborhood Chinese restaurant in a neighborhood that has sorely needed one for the nearly 30 years we have lived here. Once the Lower Haight gets a top-notch, old-school Italian restaurant, we will become a fully contented and fully self-contained community of Hyper-Locavores.  \n\nThe top pick at Wonderland is Salt and Pepper Triple Delight, which is delicately battered and deep-fried shrimp, calamari and scallops - though it tends to go heavy on the calamari, which is the cheapest ingredient next to the batter.  On two visits, the dish was perfectly executed, served plenty hot and plenty plentiful. \n\nSpeaking of delights, we also were pleased with the special eggplant and shrimp, Beijing noodles, Mongolian beef, Szechuan lamb and dry-braised green beans.  Portions are generous and pricing is reasonable for a corner restaurant with white tablecloths, pleasant decor, always-cold beer and normally efficient table service. Though the pleasant servers sometimes get backed up on a Saturday night when the place is packed and the to-go telephone is ringing like crazy, we would rather wait a bit longer to pay the tab than be hustled though a mediocre meal. \n\nOn the subject of pacing, we found on our first visit that the food came blasting to the table nearly all at once - appetizers and mains jammed side by side with no space left on the table, our plates and our over-stimulated palates.  On the second trip, we asked to have the Triple Delight as an appetizer - as the green-onion cakes and pot stickers are not special enough to waste the dough on these dough-centric calories - and to bring the rest of the order later as our main.  \n\nThe waiter gave us a short headstart on the starter and we gobbled as fast as we could, but we still had to scoop the last bits of seafood off the serving plate to make room for the main course. While we will continue to encourage him to perfect his timing, nothing but triple-bypass surgery will prevent us from ordering the Triple Delight on every future visit. BTW, we fear this dish may not travel well for takeout and home delivery.  Get off the couch and dine here in person.   \n\nWhen we asked to meet the owner, Wayne, to thank him for coming to our neighborhood, he could not have been more pleasant.  He even brought us a pair of complementary mango mochis for dessert. \n\nEat well, be nice to Wayne and get a treat. What's not to like?

They even give you a slice of gum, too to save your breath, which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nSo far, I've had the Basil Eggplant with Prawns & Chicken, which was fantastic - and the Cashew Chicken, which was also delicious and came with a ton of vegetables.\n\nEvery time that I've come (for Lunch & Dinner), I've walked out with an entire meal to warm up later - the portions are great, the execution and service are spot on, and it is a pleasant environment to dine in - there is a little bar and some sort of water fountain somewhere - you do not feel like you are at a take-out / delivery place when you are there.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend - steer clear of Hai Sun and any other menus delivered to your door are not \"Yelp-vetted\" and head to this place!", "author": "Kimberly K."}

Two years later (really?), the green might be totally gone, but the red is as bright as ever, thanks to constant repainting.  I'm sad about the major change they've made to the sign, but that's about the only criticism I have of this place that doesn't affect my rating.\n\nThe food is excellent.  They offer fifteen different kinds of meatless chicken, and unlike most Chinese restaurants that offer so many options, Wonderland actually manages to make the different versions taste very different.  Or maybe I've just tried the six that don't taste like one another.\n\nI have liked everything I've tried from here except for the garlic pea sprouts.  This is mostly Ed U.'s fault, as he recommended them and even took a picture of them for his review.  But the garlic pea sprouts have two problems.  First, they're a major choking hazard.  I know I eat fast, but I'm not one of those people who doesn't chew or who is constantly spitting up water because it went down the wrong pipe.  No, I almost choked eating these things, and from that point on, I was extremely careful while eating them.  And guess what?  I almost choked two more times.  They taste OK, I guess, but they really do need to come with a yellow WARNING label.  Oh, and second, they're way too expensive.  Almost nine bones for what amounts to a garlicky opportunity for your girlfriend to practice the Heimlich maneuver on you just seems like a stretch.  Unless your girlfriend has one of those savior complexes.  And even if she does, does she really want to make out with you after you've just eaten and spit up garlic pea sprouts?  OK, maybe she's into that too, but your luck isn't my luck, so don't rub it in.\n\nDelivery is very fast.  They have their own online-ordering system, and while that annoyed me at first, it works well, and I've never had a problem with anything.  Overall, this should be a five-star review, but it's a little pricy for the portion size.  Other than that, though, go to town on everything.

I have tried many other places and have been greatly disappointed.  I usually walk to my nearby favorite Eliza's for takeout when I am having a craving but someone told me about Wonderland and how they delivered so I gave it a try.  The first two times I ordered food from there it was quickly delivered to my door in an imressive 30 minutes and I was very impressed with the food.  So much so that I told one of my buddies about this place and he has had delivery from them over 6 times in a month.... \n\nThis place lost a star from me last night because my experience was not as ideal.  The food quality was actually the best that I have had from them and would give between a 4 and 5 star rating  (I think we mastered our order).  However it took 1.5 hours to be delivered when we were told it would be around 45 minutes.   We called after an hour and was told it was on its way.  Since we live less than 2 miles away, after 20 minutes we called again when it hadnt arrived.  At this point we were starving and told them nevermind about our order, we were just going to heat up leftovers.  A few minutes later it arrived.  We were starving and it was delicious.  We called back and told them that our order had arrived and the customer service was polite and we were told that our wait time was not acceptable, which I appreciated.  \n\nNext time we have a chinese craving I will try them again because I do really like the food, I just hope it wont take as long to get to be delivered to us or that we are told an accurate estimate when placing the order.  I will then add an additional star!", "author": "Jessica M."}

Last night, I ordered the sesame chicken, singapore noodles, and brown rice.  I thought the deliver was quick and the deliveryman was very nice.  I also thought the brown rice was cooked well and so were the noodles.  However, the BBQ pork that came with the noodles was way over cooked and chewy, so I ended up tossing the pork and just ate the noodles.  I love sesame chicken, but the order I received was again overcooked and dry, some pieces were so badly over cooked that they had a texture similar to beef jerky.

Originally planning to grab some cheap pick-up and go home, we decided stay since the decor suggested a better-than-your-usual Chinese hole-in-the-wall restaurant. \n\nWe ordered the avocado veggie roll, General Tsao tofu, and veggie chow mein. The veggie roll was the best I've had. Crispy, tasty, fresh ingredients. Great flavor and texture for the chow mein. And finally the tofu was crispy, soft on the inside, and fun to pour the separate sauce over to create a custom flavored Chinese dish of tenuous etymology.\n\nThe service was also great. Our waiter Sammy was helpful and humorous with suggestions and honest about the larger portion sizes so we didn't order too much. \n\nTo conclude, best Chinese food we've had in our admittedly limited experience with mid-to-higher end Chinese food in San Francisco.", "author": "Jugal S."}

My boyfriend and I have talked about how there really needs to be a Chinese restaurant in the area.\n\nWe went last night, kind of before they were closing. They service was super friendly and fast. It's so hit and miss with Chinese places though. But this place was spot on. And I would say it's on par with Red Jade and Big Lantern. We ordered wonton soup, which was the best wonton I've had in the city amazingly flavorful. Kungpao chicken which is my boyfriends favorite meal, he said it was really good but not as good as Big Lantern. The green bean and chicken is my favorite and it was super tasty. We also ordered a curry dish, amazing. and a chicken with vegetables that came with a few sauce options, we chose basil which kind of reminded us of a plum sauce. \n\nI'm so excited that this place is in the neighborhood and is a decent walk from our house. I'm also excited about them delivering. Which I hope is faster than Red Jade and Big Lantern (60-80 mins delivery times) since it's a lot closer. I will definitely edit my post when I find out their delivery times.", "author": "Alice T."}

The delivery came quickly and the food was piping hot. The crab rangoon and potstickers (pork) were delicious and delightful! Their sauces were very nice -- a step up form standard takeout fare. I should have stopped there. The 2 appetizers would have made a sufficiently sized meal, but I was curious about the sesame chicken and brown rice I'd ordered, so served up a small portion. The brown rice was perfectly cooked. However, the sesame chicken was out of step with everything else; first, it was exceedingly sweet(!!); second, it had a curious, intense, bright-sour-acidic syrupy glaze that had the effect of making me grind my teeth--I've never experienced such a thing, and can't explain it better, but it was unpleasant; third, the chicken was cut in strips, which were very hard to chew--beyond rubbery.

It was about 7:30 on a Friday night, and it was busy, but not swamped, which was great -- we were able to get a table right away -- which I always appreciate (especially because I was starving!)\n\nOur server was attentive, well-informed about the ingredients in each dish, and very accurate with our order  -- he repeated it back to us before heading off to the kitchen, which was very refreshing for someone like me, who is a picky eater...\n\nThe food arrived quickly and piping hot. We had the avocado spring rolls, the wor wonton soup, the pork chow mein and the garlic chicken (with white meat -- not sure if it always has white meat, but we requested it). Everything was delicious!! The garlic chicken was my favorite. The portions were large, the prices were very reasonable. The service was stellar. \n\nMy only small comments, which are a bit nit-picky:\n-  the soup had more soy sauce flavor than I was used to with wor wonton soup. It was still very tasty, full of fresh veggies, meat and delicious wontons. I would definitely order it again for sure.\n- the veggies in the Garlic Chicken were a bit large (I believe it was leeks or giant green onions), which are hard to eat when you have no knife. But again, absolutely delicious dish that I will order again.\n\nI will definitely be going back (I live in the Marina but it will be worth the drive and parking challenge) and I will be telling all of my friends to try it out.  There are only a handful of Chinese restaurants in the city that I like, and this is now on my short list.\n\nThanks, Wonderland, for a delicious meal!!!", "author": "rachel s."}

I'd never had a problem up until today.\n\nToday I went into the restaurant and ordered meatless sesame chicken to-go. Took it home and started eating it. Halfway through I started noticing the food tasted and looked A LOT like real chicken. It was in strips, too. I stopped eating for a while and ultimately decided I was just worrying unnecessarily because this kind of thing has happened before and it's ended up always being fake meat. Nowadays, certain fake meats look and taste REAL. I decided to finish the food, assuming since Wonderland has such a large vegetarian section they are cautious with their orders.\n\nA couple hours later I started feeling sick and extremely nauseous. Partly because I couldn't help but worry I'd just ate chicken, but mainly because my digestive system wasn't ready to handle meat after all the meatless years.\n\nI called Wonderland later to complain, starting by asking, \"Is your meatless chicken cubed or in strips?\" They said it depended which chicken. I said \"the meatless sesame chicken,\" at which point the person on the phone said it was cubed. I told them I had gotten chicken in strips and had gotten sick because they gave me the wrong food. Instead of apologizing, the person on the phone proceeded to tell me that the server got confused, explained that the meatless sesame chicken was in cubes, and told me I had told the server I wanted real chicken. He then said, \"Okay? Have a good day\" and hung up.\n\nOkay... so I understand miscommunication can happen between the customer and the server and the cook. I've worked in restaurants before and have made similar mistakes. I definitely told the server \"meatless\", I've been vegetarian for a long long time. What frustrates me was that the person on the phone did not once apologize for the mistake they made, and told me I ordered real chicken to avoid blame. What if this had happened with someone who had some sort of terrible allergy and they got wayyyy more sick than I did? I understand that if you're a vegan/vegetarian at a meat-serving restaurant it involves taking risks, but it's just not acceptable for a place that has such a large vegetarian menu.\n\nI liked this place a lot, I'm just really disappointed with how they handled the situation and it didn't seem professional at all.", "author": "Caroline W."}

Placed the order online where they give you the option of choosing your delivery time.  We ordered at 5:15 with a delivery time of 6:15.  We waited the hour and we never received an order confirmation or anything saying the food was being prepared.  My friend called them and they said the driver was already on the way and should arrive any minute.  Another 30 minutes passes and no food and we are starving.  We weren't really sure what was up with the driver because we were told he was on the way.  My friend calls again and the guy says he will call the driver and see what's up.  A few minutes later the food arrives.  I'm like did you get lost because we've been waiting a half our past when we requested the food?  The guy points to the receipt and shows me it has a 6:45 delivery time on it.  I said no we requested 6:15 and he just kept pointing at he receipt saying we requested 6:45.  At that point I just said whatever and wanted to eat.  Sent the dude on his way and got down to business.  We loaded our plates and sat down to eat.  As I said we were already starving and then had to wait an extra half hour so we were looking forward to watching some jeopardy and getting our munch on.  I got about half way through my plate before my friend asked me if the chicken tasted funny to me.  I took a bite to check it out and noticed it had a kind of sour taste.  It was the same taste you get when you cook chicken that is going bad that's been sitting in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 days but is not quite spoiled yet.  I couldn't tell if it was this or the sauce they use.  Either way, not good.  The pot stickers were really thick and doughy but the chow main was good and you can't really screw up steamed rice.  The food was very average and the flavor of the chicken was sketchy.  Also the fortune cookies were the most bland and unappetizing I've ever tasted.  I will never eat here again and don't recommend it at all.  The food wasn't all that good and the guy obviously lied about the driver coming and then tried to blame it in us that he was late.  15 minutes after I was done eating I spent a good 20 minutes in the bathroom.

I know the outcome: it's addictive, it's rich, and it turns me into a woozy bloated zephyr. Caution to the flatulence then, because sometimes I need it like you need sweets. I'm far from a purist when it comes to food, and this place personifies that feeling: just dish me what this craving calls for: American Chinese food -- and fancy this: it's a nice place with nice people running it. There's a bar without drinks but it won't be long before we find ourselves stumbling into this place getting fat on the feature items & reconnecting with our plainsmen past.", "author": "Jon A."}

Their dishes are always really tasty and very interesting in flavor.  I personally am not such a fan of Shanghai style spices but other people who like it say this restaurant does it very well.  I really like their kung pao spiced dished.  Prices are really reasonable.  They also have nice large soups to share with your other dining partner/s.  We had a hot and sour one that was one of the best I've had to date.", "author": "Heather K."}

Excellent service, stylish decor. Sure, you can find finer Chinese restaurants in Chinatown -- gourmet and high-priced -- but most neighborhood-style Chinese restaurants offer poor substitutes for the classic dishes. This place offers the real thing at neighborhood prices. The Chinese broccoli is out of this world.", "author": "Douglas M."}

My friend and I were just walking around Lower Haight looking for something to eat.  With the great variety of foods down there, (not always good) she pointed out this new place right on the corner of Fillmore & Haight named Wonderland Restaurant. They had the copies of the menu outside, (which I find nice, so you can check what you are getting yourself into before hand) and saw we still had time for lunch. Lunch runs Mon.-Sat. 11-3:30 which we thought was great... and the lunch special items ran between $5.95- $6.95.  \nGood deal, but would it really be good? \nO.K. enough set up... it was wonderful. Fresh, fresh, fresh, from the tea which you pay $3.00 for a good size pot, (I know pay) but it is made with nice loose leaf tea, (we had a fragrant Jasmine but they have others to choose from) and the pot itself had a nice sieve so the leaves aren't floating around in the bottom and going into your cup. Truly, it was so nice even if I wasn't really hungry I may just stop for a nice pot of tea.\nLunch specials come with a bowl of soup, along with a salad included on the main plate. The salad is made up of fresh varied lettuce (no iceberg... thank you) that added a nice little extra to the meal. You have a choice of white rice, or a very good brown rice for fifty cents more, and they give a good serving. We both loved what we had chosen, she got General Tsao Chicken, and I had Basil Eggplant w/Chicken & Prawns. She had broccoli on her dish that was just freshly steamed or fresh from the wok (nice bright green) and an abundance of savory chicken. My dish had a good amount of fresh basil, (hate it when you order something with basil and only get one leaf of it in your dish) along with a really good balance of the other ingredients. \nNow this is the first time I have been here 7/27/12 but I liked everything, from the nice not tacky decor, the service, real dishes not plastic, real table clothes, real fresh ingredients, clean, even to the varied background music.  \nCan't believe it, I don't have one complaint, how often do we get to say that nowadays. Will be back soon. Thanks!", "author": "Liz D."}

It was a Tuesday night and we were headed to a show and we needed a quick bite. My friend really wanted some Chow Fun so yelp led us to Wonderland.  It was a slow night so we were greeted and seated immediately.  Service was very good but naturally it should be when it's slow.  We ordered a small bowl of Won Ton soup, Pot Stickers, and the House Chow Fun. The Won Ton was the star of the meal bar none.  We both agreed on that immediately.  Flavorful with a hearty broth.  The pot stickers were huge and very good as well.  But eventually we got to the chow fun.  The one thing we came for and were highly disappointed.  The dish seemed over cooked and the noodles seemed a bit small for chow fun.  Flavor wise it just tasted like overcooked stir fry with which we thought was a ridiculous amount of MSG.  Our tongues were literally tingling after a couple bites.  The sensation didn't go away for a couple hours.  Not a place I'd recommend unless you needed Chinese food in that specific neighborhood.  We were hoping it would have been great find on our part but alas it just falls to the wayside as do most average or below average Chinese restaurants do.  Just a reminder to myself that great Chinese food is something to be cherished. My friend put it best.  \"That dish was so bad it made me upset at 5 am. It's a WONDER that it didn't exit earlier.\"", "author": "Joco F."}

Wonderland definitely delivered! We ordered the Won Ton Soup, Mongolian Beef, General Tsao's Chicken, and the Eggplant with Garlic. All of the food was delicious! The chicken was moist and all white meat, the Mongolian beef was fresh and slightly spicy and the Won Ton Soup was delightful! The Eggplant was probably my least favorite because it did seem to have a lot of oil, but overall it was fantastic. We will definitely be getting food from them again.", "author": "Marisa W."}

It's nice that its down the street from my place and they deliver, too.

I sit down and the waitress brings us a menu and tells us the same thing. We promptly order. The  food comes all at once and  five minutes into it the man from behind the counter comes over and tells us the register closes at ten.So we put our forks down and settle up as they are stacking chairs on the tables around us and there are two other tables still eating as well. We ask for a to go box and I go to the bathroom. When I come back to the table the lights have been turned off and so has the music ! Seriously ? It was 10:08 ! All tables took the not so subtle hints and exited . The food was mediocre and the service was so rude from the get go. I have worked in the food industry for twenty years and understand the servers want to leave , but they all crossed the line.
