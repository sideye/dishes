But I guess that's just SOP. I used to pass by here after work years ago and grab the Korean Steak Sandwich for lunch. It was $8 back then. I left the Bay Area for a few years and came back to discover that the Korean sandwich is $13. Bummer but I'll still pay that price. \n\nWhat Didn't: This unassuming liquor store still makes some of the best sandwiches around! I was initially a bit worried that my high rating was somehow due to nostalgia, however, my recent return to Rhea's reminded me of why they deserve five stars. The ACME sweet roll was perfect for this application. I feel that bread is too often under appreciated in a sandwich and merely thought of as a vehicle to hold the fillings together. But here, that sweet roll had a nice crust, chewy texture, a kinda open crumb so there were enough air pockets that the aioli/hot sauce can fill with flavor, and the bread alone had good flavor as well. You know when you have a subpar sandwich that uses inferior bread? You reach the last bite where it's just the bread left and you're kinda like \"no thanks I'm good.\" Yeah. That doesn't happen at Rhea's. The Korean steak was hot, not too salty, and had enough ginger and soy. Garlic aioli was creamy and actually had garlic flavor. Acidity from the pickled onions helped cut through the richness of everything. There was enough cheddar and it melted just enough to act as sandwich glue. The entire sandwich was juicy, yet, had great structural integrity and didn't fall apart in my hand. Nothing in this sandwich was an afterthought. Nothing! \n\nExtra Info: \n-Their hot sauce is not actually that spicy. And that's fine. I'd like to enjoy all the other flavors in my sandwich rather than feel too much of a kick in this situation. Order the spicy if you want to actually feel any heat. If not, go with mild or medium. Doesn't matter which. They are practically the same. \n-Barely any seating inside. Instead, purchase some chips and a drink and walk over to Dolores Park to eat with a fantastic view of the city!", "author": "John B."}

It also had swiss cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, pepperoncini, ranch, honey dijon, and garlic aioli... all served on an Acme roll.

I heard about this place somewhere I think either here or on Check Please Bay Area or on Muni and thought I check it out! This isn't your average sandwich joint and is a lot more popular than a Subway Sandwich joint. Why? It's organic and unique. It's not everyday you would find this in the city of San Francisco. Organic sandwiches here cost a lot but are well worth the price. Unlike other sandwich joints this one is inside a liquor store. I really like this idea because you get to chose from a variety of side snacks ranging from candy to chips.  They also have a variety of drinks that you can try. I personally recommend the Izzle drinks or any kombucha. If you like your sandwiches with alcohol then take a beer and sandwich&go. \nDrawback: Due to popularity of the sandwiches service can be slow. Seats can be less. If you eat a lot, spend your money wisely", "author": "Michael W."}

The dutch crunch it came on was perfectly crispy on top and soft inside. Compared to Ike's, this sandwich was tastier, and the soy protein wasn't overly soy-tasting.

If you're a smaller eater like me, you can even split the sandwich and be full. Rhea's may be changing my mind about sandwiches! \n\nRhea's also has a large variety of drinks and chips to accompany your sandwich. We tried out the Kettle brand Korean BBQ chips.

When you enter, they have little forms on the table for you to fill out for your sandwich. \n\nSo far, I've tried the korean steak, the panda and the miss piggy. We wanted to order the chicken katsu today, but the worker said they don't serve it at this location anymore.\n\nMy favorite is the miss piggy because it comes with pesto sauce, mozerella, and it has really good flavoring. I ordered it based on yelp reviews and they didn't have it on the menu, but they knew what it was when I asked. I didn't know this was a vegetarian sandwich and I really should've double checked. Next time I'll be ordering this, but with dutch crunch & salami or some type of meat! BUT the sandwich itself was really good even without the meat, so I'm going to say it's still a win, lol.\n\nThe Panda was my boyfriends favorite, and it was pretty packed as well. The flavoring was really intense because there was a lot going on. It comes with pastrami, salami, pepperjack, pepperocini, roasted pepper aioli, & etc! You can see why it was so intense, lol!\n\nWe ordered two korean steaks the last time we were here and it was pretty bomb. It was filled with bulgogi meat, but the sauce had an interesting spice to it that I didn't really enjoy too much.

They are all so flavorful, and they use plenty of meat (unlike Ike's, these days...).  I prefer to order the spicy version of any sandwiches with spice ranges, although that's pretty spicy and maybe too spicy for some folks...  Prices are about right for the quality of the ingredients and the size of the sandwiches - they range from about $10-$12, in most cases.  \n\nService is pretty quick and the market has plenty of accompaniments for your sandwich - all the typical bodega items, I'd say.  Just make sure to go on the earlier side (they open at 11am) before they run out of Dutch Crunch.\n\nP.S. The Acme Organic Sweet Roll and the Dutch Crunch are the best bread options.

It was a sad moment for me when Mission Picnic was closed one random Saturday, so I went to Yelp and just picked the closest option for \"sandwiches\" in the Mission.\n\nI'd passed by this place so many times (and I think even shopped here once) and had no idea it was a deli in addition to a corner store.\n\nI liked both sandwiches but didn't love them. However, the quality was good enough that I'm interested to go back and find better sandwiches and be able to bump up Rhea's overall rating.\n\nTHE SERVICE: They will answer the phone, and they will give accurate estimates on the wait. I really appreciate that!\n\nTHE WAIT: I called ahead around 1:30pm on a Saturday and it was about a 30 minute wait for the sandwiches.\n\nTHE COST: About $30 total for 2 sandwiches.\n\nSee my photos for additional info!\n\n* Korean Steak - 3.5 stars\nThe flavors on this sandwich definitely pop. And if you ask for spicy, you get the real deal! They put in jalape\u00f1o slices which were actually too much for me. However, I found the quality of the meat slices to be low - they weren't quite lean, the texture came out a bit rubbery as it was rather fatty (and not in the good way that some meats can be). \n\n* The Valencia - 4 stars\nMuch more classic than the Korean, a little bland if you do a side-by-side comparison, but still very well done.

Rhea's has one of those giant overwhelming menus where each sandwich is named something completely arbitrary and also has its own individual verbose description that is just taped to the wall.  Like I am supposed to know your inside joke and naming system?  In fact, each sandwich has it's own 8.5X11 piece of paper that reminds me of a BINGO board.  So, if I eat five in a row, do I get a free one?\n\nI had the Judah St. sandwich and it was amazing.  Buffalo chicken, pesto, garlic aioli, red onions, baby spinach (I think or some kind of greens), mozzarella cheese, and tomatoes.  Oh my goodness, the combination was so delicious in my mouth.  I hate mayonnaise, but the garlic aioli was on point and it was not slathered on haphazardly but perfectly and thoughtfully spread.  We had a group of about ten people and almost each of us ordered a different sandwich and all of us were impressed with the combination of flavor and deliciously surprised by such an unassuming deli!\n\nTo go with your sandwich, you can also pick up some snacks and pretty exotic drinks from a mediterranean cucumber/mint refresher to leninade (some kind of soda inspiried by Lenin's politics) to authentic Chinese iced teas to your typical soda offerings.\n\nThere is a small counter space with about four or five stools to eat your sandwich but I'd recommend just grabbing it and heading to Dolores Park if it's a nice day.

As per the recommendation of some co-workers, a co-worker and I decided to give Rhea's a try on this sunny Monday afternoon in San Francisco. Unfortunately Rhea's does not have a website, which means no current menu, but luckily their Yelp page has their sandwich menu. After scanning the menu a few times, I debated between the Korean Steak or the 18th Street, which was personally recommended to me. \n\nWe were advised that Rhea's isn't a sit and eat kind of deli, so we called ahead for pickup. Once we arrived, both sandwiches were ready to go and although there was a small counter to eat, it's not the best place to enjoy your lunch hour. Besides the deli counter, it's your typical liquor corner store and not much else. My 18th Street sandwich ran me $9.\n\nWith it being such a nice day out, we took our sandwiches to nearby Dolores Park. As soon as you unwrap the butcher paper, the first thing you'll notice is the portion size. It's not terribly small but I had a feeling it wouldn't be filling either. I will say the sandwich packed plenty of flavor in between the Acme roll. The flavorful sandwich consisted of buffalo chicken, muenster cheese, bacon, baby arugula, red onion, which I opted out of, tomatoes, pickles and a chipotle aioli. \n\nEven with the abundance of flavors, nothing was overpowering and I enjoyed the sandwich without my usual splash of hot sauce.The recommendation on the sandwich was great and Rhea's is a great spot for a light and fluffy sandwich. However, I was disappointed in the overall size of the sandwich especially given that its coming from a corner store. I don't mind the $10 price point but I expected a bit more for my money. I do however agree with the consensus in that Rhea's makes one mean sandwich, just be sure to pickup some chips on the side. \n\nPros:\n+ Corner store with a full sandwich/deli counter\n+ Large sandwich menu\n+ Made to order sandwiches\n+ Quick and tasty\n+ Affordable prices\n+ General corner store with full booze lineup and snacks\n\nCons:\n- No website with full menu\n- Small portion size", "author": "Alexander E."}

I got it without cheese because I saw someone else's review that suggested it would taste better without it. The sauce that comes with the sandwich makes it moist and it comes with a spicy kick. You can get it mild, medium or hot. The meat was marinated and thinly sliced so the sandwich held together very well. The vegetables are fresh and complements the other flavors of the sandwich.\n\nIt can be a little wait before you receive your sandwich though.

Not the first time we've been there and certainly won't be the last time. The Korean steak sandwich is of course, Rhea's signature sandwich and for good reason. We got ours in less than five minutes (Wednesday, cloudy, lunchtime; your mileage may vary on a warm weekend when everyone and everyone wants a sammie to take to Dolores).\n\nIt's immensely flavorful, unique, and the flavors are well-balanced. You'll get notes of umami, sweet, salty, sour, spicy and creamy with each bite. The bread they use is excellent and the portions are hearty (again, we split a whole sandwich yet both of us were satisfied). We ordered it medium spicy and it was the perfect rendition of medium. The heat kicked in slowly but was never overwhelming. \n\nI've been a Rhea's customer for almost 17 years (as long as I've lived in the Mission) and I remember when it really was just a corner store (albeit a well-run one even back in the day). For several year now, it's been a corner store *plus* a fantastic sandwich deli. \n\nThe Korean steak sandwich is a go-to for good reason, but the entire sandwich menu is creative and worth checking out. Never had a bad sammie but when I explore other options, I always want to reserve the option of swapping half of whatever I'm trying out for half of the Korean steak and thus I always eat there with at least one other person.\n\nJames Choi is the fourth owner of Rhea's according to the Check Please episode that highlighted them (and I happened to walk by, back when they filmed that episode years ago; so fun to watch both the filming of it and the actual episode). His parents ran it before he took over and reinvented it a bit, for the better.

I was on the Chefs' Feed app and read Foreign Cinema chef Gayle Pirie's rave about it, so I thought it was worth us heading over there to try it. The place was swamped with customers waiting in line to order sandwiches, and much to our chagrin, they were sold out of the Korean Steak Sandwich. But instead of leaving in a huff - a specialty of mine - we saw there were quite a few sandwiches that sounded tempting. The challenge was reviewing the menu taped on 8 x 11 sheets in front of the sandwich makers because there was a queue of  hungry people in the way.\n\nI believe it was the first day for the young guy taking the orders at the cash register, and he was overwhelmed by the chaos. However, he kept a sunny disposition which I genuinely appreciated since a few of the customers were on the high maintenance side. Jamie ended up ordering the $7.95 Harrison Street, a hot pastrami and cheddar cheese sandwich with red onion, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, pepperoncini, spicy brown mustard and chipotle aioli all stuffed into an Acme organic roll (see photo). Hearty stuff and quite delicious. Mine was simpler and quite good, too...the $7.95 Boar's Head Roast Beef with spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato and mayo, all in a fresh Dutch crunch roll (see photo).

RECYCLE.\n\nRecycle? You ask. Yes. Recycle. The katsu (pork cutlet) was so dry it was the doppelganger of cardboard. The bread was the cousin of cardboard. It would've been put to better use recycled into something usable like paper. The slaw was ok but  overwhelmingly spicy even for someone who loves a good kick in their food.\n\nWith a 4 plus star rating you'd think they could've done just a tad bit better to live half way up to it's rating. That katsu was not served fresh and probably premade in the morning. My GF took a bite n threw it away while I managed to take 2 bites.\n\nAlthough this review does not reflect any of their other sandwiches which I've never tried yet... The fact remains that if someone can serve up something like that to their patrons, it shows how much they really care about their craft. I personally would never serve up something I wouldn't approve of. I hope they didn't serve me that sandwich thinking it was Ok. \n\nHow I felt: cheated of 10 bucks so they can get rid of old food.\n\nIf you're headed there maybe skip the katsu sandwich... You can't go wrong if they're just slicing meat n vegetables n slapping it on some bread I guess. Shouldn't be too difficult to serve up a 3 star sandwich.\n\nIf you happen to get the katsu n find it to fail your taste buds... Don't throw it into the trash. Help make it a greener world and throw that cardboard into the blue bin... Recycle. \n\nGood luck!\n\nI'm new to yelp kind of but you can see many more of my posts of amazing grub on IG colin_r2d by adding me.

The Deli counter is to the left with all the descriptions of their sandwiches.  However, you do order using one of their preprinted paper slips that are located next to the cash register (right next to the door), which is also where you pay for your sandwich.\n\nThe Korean Steak comes with 3 options of spiciness and I opted for medium.  I waited around for 10 or 15 minutes when they finally called my name.  It was difficult to find anywhere to stand while waiting and felt like I was constantly in the way of the workers and other shoppers.   I carried the sandwich home about 5 blocks and devoured it.\n\nThe flavor was excellent (not what I was expecting but awesome) but the bread had gotten all soggy with grease from the steak, which was a turnoff.  It also cost $11 which is a bit high for an average sized sandwich.  The medium spiciness was legit and didn't need to order it 'spicy' just to feel it.\n\nOverall they make great sandwiches without the bells and whistles.  I'll come back only if it's convenient though.  I fear a 40 minute wait if I don't show up when they open or don't call ahead.", "author": "Shane E."}

Really good stuff!!!\n\nJust take a look at these (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=IweGUk8obqiACeWXoMJT3w)  It's edible art!!  If I had to pick my favorite between the two, I probably would pick the Korean Steak simply because it had a nice blend of sweet and spicy flavor.  That's not to say that the Pork Katsu Sandwich was bad, that sandwich itself was delicious simply because I have a thing for fried stuff.\n\nThey have a huge menu of sandwiches as well and I would say that they're giving Ike's Place a run for their money.

Loved the crunchy organic roll. \n\nKOREAN STEAK SANDWICH ($8.99): \n  This is the \"famous\" sandwich that everyone talks about. It was tasty but nothing crazy and out of this world.\n I ordered this without the cheddar cheese. I prefer my bulgogi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi) without the funky taste of cheddar or any cheeses for that matter. The tender soy-marinated rib-eye had just the right amount of meat to lettuce ratio. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humRe1SGupNdDJUxEdDmMg?select=PRtK3t-9xVLzIEhCf8DHyw\n\nThe chopped lettuce, grilled AND pickled red onions, jalapenos gave the sammie a nice texture when paired with the soft beef. \n\nThe tangy garlic aioli had flecks of red chilies in it. It wasn't spicy enough for me, but it had a nice kick. Bulgogi in a bun, can't go wrong!\n\nPORK KATSU SANDWICH ($8.19): My favorite one!!\n Paul got this one and I managed to take a bite out of it. I like this one better than my steak sandwich since I have a hankering for fried meats. I only got the Korean Steak bc everyone raved about it. \n\nThe thinly pounded pork loin is covered in panko bread crumbs and fried to a golden crisp. Despite the thinness, the pork still retained it's moisture.\n\nThe katsu was topped with Rhea's homemade coleslaw (lacking mayo, which I liked), pickled red onions, jalapenos and a spicy aioli. There was also a light drizzle of their tangy katsu sauce. The katsu sauce reminds me of a sweeter version of Arby's bbq sauce.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humRe1SGupNdDJUxEdDmMg?select=5B9LBUEngWTYtuPAoHR9fg\n\nCHICKEN KATSU SANDWICH ($8.19)\n My friend Niki doesn't eat pork so she got the chicken version of the katsu sandwich.

So I had my doubts about going to Rhea's for their Korean Steak Sandwich, especially in such an unassuming place as in the Mission. But, boy was I WRONG. Don't be fooled because the Korean Steak Sandwich will be the best ORGASMIC sandwiches experiences you will ever have! Way better than Ike's...\n\nOn Thursday, December 30th, I came to Rhea's at 12ish after having just finished with a Dr.'s appointment nearby. \n\nUpon walking in, I was a bit confused on the ordering process especially when the directions on how to order was blocked by another person. So, I stood there for a good several minutes until the person left and I finally noticed the directions.\n\n1) Get a sandwich order form at the sandwich counter.\n\n2) Choose from their signature sandwiches like the Korean Steak and Chicken Katsu Sandwich or make your own by choosing your own bread, meat, cheese, and condiments. \n\n3) Give your order form to the cashier and pay for your sandwich (CC's accepted) before your order is processed.\n\nFree delivery is offered in the Mission area ($10 minimum) with a $3 surcharge past 9th street and Market towards Duboce streets.\n\nThere's a small counter for four in the market and a small bench outside to munch your sandwich. \n\nBeing the recipient of the 2010 SF Bay Guardian Best of the Bay Award, there was no question that I was ordering the much hyped Korean Steak Sandwich - Medium Spicy ($8.45). It's NO wonder that it won an award because the sandwich was K I L L E R!\n\nGrilled and marinated bulgogi piled over 2 inches high, layered with crisp spicy kimchi, sweet red onions, spicy jalapenos, chili garlic sauce, garlic aioli, and cheddar cheese sandwiched between a toasted Acme roll. The first bite was like an orchestrated symphony of flavors and textures in my mouth. The crisp and chewy bread led to the savory, tender and sweet bulgogi with a hint of gingery and garlicy goodness. The kimchi and chili garlic sauce added a fiery kick that was cooled down by both the creamy and rich aioli and thick slices of sharp cheddar. \n\nThere was no shortage of bold spices and flavors and THIS is how Asian Fusion food should taste like. No words can really explain how mouth-watering the Korean Steak Sandwich was and it's just something that you will have to \"experience\" for yourself.\n\nDo note that the sandwich tends to get soggy from the juiciness of the bulgogi, so make sure to eat it ASAP! \n\nSince I used the holiday season as an excuse to derail off my diet, I don't know when I'll be able to return to Rhea's. But I know when I do,  I will be throwing my carb inhibitions out the door and get the Chicken Katsu Sandwich too. :X\n\nP.S. - Rhea's sells the hard to find and highly addictive Cadbury Flake and Aero. \n\nKiller sandwiches and delectable Cadbury chocolates?

It's kind of like Roxie's in the sense that it's a liquor store with a deli inside. There is also a table to eat with a few stools to the right of the entrance.

You are not going to get a \"high end, luxurious\" sandwich such as Darwin's... more of the blue collar type with a shimmy twist. Here's what I've sample so far\n\nThe Harrison - $7.45 -  Hot Pastrami with cheddar cheese, red onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, pepperoncini with spicy mustard and chipotle aioli. I believe the meat is Boar's head which is always a good thing. Not excessively lined with fat yet not too lean where it's completely dry. All the veggies were fresh and there was only a hint of the mustard. Very mild spice from the chipotle. Their acme organic rolls is also very tasty.\n\nMarinated Veggie Steak - $7.45 - This was a true surprise. I'm usually not a big fan of meat substitutes but this is the real deal. The flavor and texture is almost like a Korean marinated meatball. I could eat this and not feel like a wimp! I can't remember the veggies, but I believe it has lettuce, tomatoes and pickles with possible a garlic aioli. \n\nKorean Steak Sandwich - $8.99 - One of the more popular sandwiches so I had to try it, plus who doesn't like ribeye slices in a sandwich? The meat has been marinated in a soy sauce garlic, ginger, honey and other spices. I didn't takes a lot of ginger which is a plus for me, and it did just have a hint of the honey. The veggies included is lettuce and a very nice pickled red onion with jalapenos and fresh red onions. The sammie is sauced up with their garlic aioli on the organic acme roll. I can see why this is popular, it's quite good especially if you like spicy steak sandwiches.\n\nI'll be back here at least a couple more times. Since their Veggie Steak was really good, they have another vegetarian sammie, the Vegetarian BBQ Chicken which comes with some a chicken drumstick, red/white cabbage with carrots, pickled red onions (yum!), jalapenos, chili garlic sauce and roasted red pepper aioli for $8.19", "author": "Andrew L."}

It could have been shoe leather in there, and I wouldn't really have noticed.  Not that it would have been bad though.\n\n    The gimmick or the \"hook\" with these sandwiches is the excellent bread (Acme), (which is half the battle when it comes to sandwiches), and then the variety of ingredients/condiments added.  So every bite is a bit different and never boring.  When they add chili sauce, garlic aioli, jalapenos, pickled red onions, and a variety of veggies, it would be hard NOT to make something interesting.  So even though the \"spicy goo\" covers up some of the flavors, I'd be a regular if I lived in the area.\n\n      I also got the regular kimchi, and it was one of the better ones I've tasted.

The most popular items are the Korean beef ($7.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rheas-deli-and-market-san-francisco?select=7iAjXA7tYfytvakvEHINVw#7iAjXA7tYfytvakvEHINVw and the pork katsu ($6.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rheas-deli-and-market-san-francisco?select=rBdVB12S1t90nfcWn1aalg#rBdVB12S1t90nfcWn1aalg sandwiches.

I had one of those last Friday, and walking down Valencia Street, seeing bar after bar filled with \"Woo\" people, and not in the financial straits to go for a sit down dinner, I decided on Rhea's, a longstanding fixture in the Mission and on my \"bookmarks\" list.\n\nLike everyone else in the world, I ordered The Korean Steak Sandwich (9.95), which was pretty damn tasty, and kind of problematic. They certainly didn't skimp on delicious, ginger and soy marinated steak, and the well toasted, gloriously crunchy ciabatta roll did no harm. The pickled onions and jalapenos perhaps too acidic, the cheese unmelted, but when taken together with a potent spice which skittered along my tongue like Saint Elmo's fire over the mast of a ship, and a rich garlic mayo, I can totally understandable how Rhea's could get away with charging ten dollars for this sandwich. Its the sort of combination which hits every human need for spice, acidity, protein, fats, and carbs in just the right way, and leaves you craving for more. I can't give it five stars, but it comes pretty damn close. \n\nWith sandwich in hand, I grabbed a bomber of Lagunitas from their cabinet (in a classy-as-fuck-paper bag), went out on the street, and inhaled my meal in a parklet while the endless parade of hip, tech folk walked past. At that moment, I was far happier outside on a cold night then I would have been in one of the crowded bars with fogged windows on every corner.\n\nOverall: Four Stars. A somewhat problematic, but praiseworthy sandwich.\n\nExtras:\n\nBeers are a bit overpriced (by about a dollar)\n\nAccessible to all Mission corridor bus lines, BART, the 33-Stanyan and 22-Fillmore.", "author": "Casey U."}

The Marinated Rib-Eye soaked in soy sauce, garlic, honey & spices will work wonders on your taste buds. The pairing of the cheddar cheese is odd at first but gives an interesting texture in the end. The pickled red onions, jalape\u00f1os, garlic aioli and shredded iceberg lettuce all compliment the Rib-Eye. I really like the Acme Organic bread roll it's served on because it's the bread's texture and fluff if just right. A soft inside with a doughy, semi-crunch. I order mine spicy because I enjoy the hotness.\n\nOther sandwiches I've enjoyed here are the 18th St. (Hot Buffalo chicken, muenster cheese, bacon) and the Lexington (Honey Maple & Black Ham, swiss cheese, pickled jalape\u00f1os).\n\nMost of their sandwiches have the garlic aioli sauce.

The pickled red onions, lettuce, and grilled onions are all delish.  I didn't specify a cheese and I guess the default is cheddar because that's what I got.  It wasn't bad.

One, there is an actual bar along the perimeter for sitting and eating.  I found this to be a very nice feature for those who were hoping to eat their sandwich right away while it was still hot.  Second, the place was pretty dang clean...  which, you know, is always nice.  No bathroom on site though; they have some sort of agreement with an establishment across the street, because they told us to go use their bathroom.  Ask them!\n\nService:  VERY nice people here.  Note:  If you're hoping for a quick in and out order and pickup, think again.  We came here on a Saturday and the wait for sandwiches was 45 minutes.  Being that the sandwich was the sole and singular purpose of our visit, we waited.  It was worth it.\n\nFood:  We came for the Katsu Sandwich, but it has REGRETTABLY been discontinued. ARGH.  Oh well, we got the Korean Steak Sandwich. OMGAH.  It was to die for!  With kimchi and a good deal of flavor, the sandwich hit the spot.  We paired it with some cheap champagne (the lady working at the cash register told us which one was the best flavor for the cheapest price) and we waltzed on over to Dolores Park, eating and basking in the sun.  Twas bliss.\n\nI marked down one star for the wait, because they changed their menu to get rid of the Katsu, and because of the lack of bathroom on site (none of which can be helped, but yea).  All in all, the service was good and the location was clean and pleasant. I'll be coming here for my badass-sandwich-fix again VERY soon.\n\n4 out of 5!", "author": "Bryan H."}

I'm surprised this trend isn't making headlines in the NYT.  Surely this is right up there with food trucks.  Luckily, where food trucks can be hit or miss, these sandwich shops are more of a sure thing.  I had both the Korean steak and Chicken Katsu here (split with someone else, not all by myself!).  They were both really yummy.  They were really big though so if I were just getting something for me, I could probably stretch out a sandwich into two meals.  They are also kinda messy to eat.  So definitely something to eat sitting down at home or somewhere where you can easily clean up or don't mind being a mess afterwards.  I do not recommend these sandwiches for hiking or a in-flight meal.\n\nIt's not clear the procedure when you get here so let me explain.  Pick up slips of paper to the immediate left of the door at the register.  Write down what you want, pay, then drop it off in the sandwich area.

This place is always crowded, always busy, so it makes sense to order via phone or internet, but be forewarned: you better know EXACTLY what you want, because the folks who answer the phone are not going to take the time to hold your hand and guide you.  \n\nCase in point: two weeks ago, I ordered the Korean Steak Sandwich.  Yes, it was delicious, and yes, I'll admit, it is my responsibility to have read the menu completely, but I was surprised to find out that it came with CHEESE on it.  Cheese is one of those things that I expect the shop to say, \"Would you like cheese with that?\" or  \"What KIND of cheese would you like on that?\"  But, I didn't say anything about cheese, they sure as heck didn't ASK me anything about cheese, and lo and behold, my Korean Steak Sandwich arrives with American Cheese on it.  (Just in case you think I'm being a douche-bag here, I submit that it is pretty reasonable to assume that a Korean-style steak sandwich would NOT have cheese on it.  They don't really do cheese in Korea.  And, it's not called the Korean Cheese Steak sandwich, it's called Korean Steak sandwich.)\n\nOkay, whatever, my bad, fine.  But then, today, I phone in an order for the Valencia, their totally awesome turkey-based sandwich.  Do I have their menu memorized?  No, I do not.  Does the guy answering the phone ask me if I want it Hot or Cold?  No, he does not.  Do I know that I'm supposed to specify that I want it Hot?  No, I do not.  So, what do I get?  A cold sandwich when I could've had a hot one.  Is there a big difference between hot, delicious MELTY cheese on your sandwich, and warm, delicious TOASTY bread versus cold slabs of solid cheese on room temperature bread?  COME ON!!  You know there's a big difference.  One is good, one is frickin' GREAT.  \n\nSo, again, sure, I'll take responsibility for making assumptions, but i think, at 8, 9, and 10 bucks a sandwich it's NOT unreasonable to expect that the person taking my order might use the following phrases:  \"Would you like that HOT or COLD?\"  \"What kind of cheese would you like with that?\"  I don't think that's asking too much, do you?  \n\nLessons learned:  1. assume cheese on every sandwich and specify which kind you want, otherwise expect boring American, even on a sandwich that doesn't need cheese at all (the Korean)  2. If you want it Hot, you better ask for it Hot, because the people answering the phone are apparently too busy to take the time to ask you.\n\nCome on, Rhea's!  Don't just be really GOOD, but frickin' EXCELLENT.  Hold your customer service to the same high standard as your sandwiches and ingredients.    Thanks!!!", "author": "FoodDudeS F."}

It's a flavor and texture explosion of the best kind.  Minor areas for improvement: the cheese was soft but not melted, the beef wasn't warm and I wonder how it would taste with some kim chi.\n\nI noticed after I ordered my sandwich that they have Korean steak tacos, 2 for $6.  Yum.  You can also get other sandwiches on Acme bread (good bread makes a difference).  Standard deli sandwiches with Boar's Head deli meat are $5.\n\nThe inside is your typical convenience store only cleaner and nicer.  They have a counter if you want to eat your sandwich there.  They carry what 7-Eleven does (milk, cheese, ice cream, cereal, cookies, candy, juice, wine) but they also have gourmet cheeses, Cowgirl Creamery crackers and jars of homemade kim chi (made by the Korean guy's mom).\n\nBookmark this place.

I tried both the korean steak sandwich and the katsu sandwich, and to my surprise preferred the katsu. Both had a nice spicy kick to them without having other flavors overwhelmed. I thought the katsu came together better with a great crunch from the pork and the slaw. It was also better constructed and held together well. I don't like red onions so we got them on the side of the steak sandwich, and I have to admit it was better with onions (which were pickled, so I do prefer those to raw red onions). I'd also requested it without the cheese, because that just seemed like too much, but I have to say that I do now have a lot of faith in their sandwich ideals, so in the future I'd probably go with every topping they recommend.\n\nNext time I would ask for them to go a bit lighter on the aioli - it's good, but a little goes a long way.

The pastrami was pretty good and plentiful.  There wasn't that much kimchi and the kimchi was more sour than spicy but it seemed to work well in the sandwich.

Since I live in the Outer Richmond, going to the Mission requires some planning on my part. I went at 11:30 AM, metered parking was easily available across the street, and I was the first to order when the Deli opened. \nI had already decided on the Korean but once I saw the sandwich menu on the board, I knew I had to come back and try the rest. The Sandwich was ready in less than 10 minutes and I could wait to get home and try it, along with the homemade kimchi that they sell. The sandwich was as spicy as I requested and the meat was just super tender. The size is huge. I could only eat half for lunch. Saving the other half for later! Since is a market, they carry  decent selection of wines and beer. \nI will be back!", "author": "Frank B."}

I was a bit skeptical if the sandwiches would still be good a couple hours later but yup, Rhea's proved me wrong and was still mighty delish! I absolutely loved the sauces on both sandwiches (hello garlic aioli & tonkatsu sauce!) and the ACME Bread was chewy, crunchy & held everything together nicely. Both were equally amazing, but if I HAD to choose, I would prefer the Katsu Sandwich (only because I'm a sucker for spicy mayo). \n\nThe guys working the deli were awesome! Super friendly and easy to talk to. Oh yeah, it also didn't hurt that we didn't encounter a line during our visit ;) While Rhea's may be a bit more $$ than Ike's, I would still highly recommend it.

Seems this place has been afforded not only one running but a few re-runs as well. Good for them.\nI did not read any Yelp reviews before going, so I was not sure what to expect and ordered what sounded good to me. I did order the Korean Beef Sandwich. Must say, it was really super in all regards. If you whine about the price, split a sandwich, get a bag of chips and a drink and be happy. Or go get a slice of pizza or a Safeway sandwich - whatever floats your boat. \nI'd go back (from Palo Alto) and certainly understand the Chicken Katsu debate - does not make sense to me but whatever. I worked at a kitchen where Kim-Chi was made in-house. Be grateful they keep theirs in a jar and behind the counter. It can overwhelm a place really fast. I can still smell it after being gone for 10 years.\n\nI didn't mind waiting :20 for the sandwich - at least they were honest and it took a full :20. Does not seem like a place to order office sandwiches - just a bit time consuming for that I might think. Did see two bike messengers come through - they had to wait for their pick-up orders as well. Everyone worked at a nice pace - no big rush. They are looking to hire someone - probably get free lunch also!\n\nIf you think about the alternatives to a $9 sandwich being a bottle of booze, choose the sandwich.", "author": "Tom S."}

Perched on one of the benches right outside the unassuming liquor storefront of Rhea's, I had a hard time deciding if I should quickly devour the awesome sandwich or slowly dissect the sandwich to understand why this sandwich is so AWESOME.\n\nThe meat is not only authentically flavorful but TENDER. It's not tough or chewy so you wont get the awkward trailing mouth full of meat as you pull away from a bite.\n\nThe house pickled red onions are a wonderful addition to the sandwich. I personally like vinegared anything (love sunonomo!) but have never had vinegared ONIONS! It works magic here.\n\nThe organic ACME roll is crispy and light. It provides a great base for the flavors in between to shine. \n\nThe people who works here are also very friendly and it seems like they truly enjoy producing delicious sandwiches. I love how they also have a great selection of drinks. They have a huge selection of ITO EN teas!\n\nRemember to call ahead to place you order and get in the queue!

We ordered our sandwiches and had paid when the cashier said to me, I poop you not, \"Oh, by the way, it's going to be 45 min, unless that ruins your life,\" cocking her head to the side at the last bit.  Now, I live in the Mission, so I'm used to good food and terrible service, and I was willing to consider the 45 min, but I thought this was a little far.  However, before I could respond, my friend said that was fine so I held my tongue and off we went to the park.\n\n1 hour and 15 min later, they finally call us, and an hour and a half after I ordered my sandwich I was holding it in my hand.  I ordered a hot sandwich, as you may have guessed, it was now cold.  The sandwich itself shed no light on the mystery of what on earth took so long to make it.  It consists of: meat, cheese, bread, a little bit of pickled vegetables, and some sort of spread.  I had no desire to eat it at this point, but I took one large bite with all the ingredients to get a feel for the taste.  The bread was very hard as bread will get if you toast it and then let it get cold, the sparse ingredients seemed decent in quality. \n\nMore on the 1:15 of wait-time: there were two other people in the shop, milling around, when we were ordering.   I had no reason to believe that they had already ordered.  There was nobody hanging around outside, as people do at this place.  They apparently take a lot of phone orders; I suspect that they give these priority over the suckers who foolishly come into their physical store.\n\nSeriously, there is no reason to go here, Clare's Deli is delicious and only a couple blocks away.  Ike's is amazing and within easy walking distance.  Bump yourself up off of the Rhea's wall and get yourself some sandwich now.", "author": "Harlen W."}

Thirty-five minutes later, yes *35* minutes later, I got my sandwich.  If it's going to take that long, you would think they'd give a heads up.  At least I'd have been able to bring my copy of War and Peace and finished it by the time I got my lukewarm sandwich.

If the cashier has to stock inventory in the cold cases, don't let him do it when there are customers in the store since people were waiting around wondering why they have to wait 5 minutes to buy a pack of cigarettes when there were so many people waiting and no one behind the register.

And I have almost penned one about a couple of places in my neighborhood a couple of times. However, I am happy to report that my first Yelp review is about something that I love. \n\nMy dog, Turtle, and I always used to pass Rhea's Deli on our walk. Turtle loved popping in because they have treats behind the counter and everyone that works there was so nice. Then in the last few months they put in a deli and started selling sandwiches. I am now obsessed and finally have a new cheap lunch option in the neighborhood. These are the reasons that their sandwiches are amazing:\n\n1. The bread is either from Acme or Tartine (and you don't have to wait in Tartine's line or pay Tartine's prices). Oh, and they have normal bread too.\n\n2. The Aiolis: If there was a way to bold this on a Yelp review I would. I hate mayonnaise. I think it is disgusting. However, their aiolis are amazing. This could be because they make them FRESH throwing the olive oil, egg, and garlic or whatever other flavors into the food processor daily or a few times a day. Yum. Seriously, this makes all the difference.\n\n3. The pickled onions. James, the owner, pickles red onions himself. Again, yum. And he does it simply with champagne vinegar, a little sugar and maybe one other thing-- I forget. Point is I have fresh, homemade pickled onions on my sandwich. This is no extra charge. They also have pickled jalape\u00f1os; I haven't tried those yet.\n\n4. All the ingredients are top. All the prices are not. I do not see why you would go to Bi-Rite over Rheas. It makes no sense. \n\n5. They are really flexible. I bet I could ask them to do something super annoying to my sandwich like toast one half of the bread and not the other and they would be like, no problem, glad to do it. \n\nSo point is that it is the place to get the sandwich. My sister lives in cow hollow. She had a sandwich from here. She thought it was so amazing, she said she is going to have to start driving over to my neighborhood expressly to go to Rheas. They have cow girl creamery cheese, a panini press, and basically anything else an amazing sandwich shop would want. Ok, that is my first Yelp review.", "author": "Liz M."}

Maybe it was the fact that I was crazy starving and could barely wait to eat this when I got home, this is well worth the $8.50. I got the mild version and it totally was mild. I hate when it's too spicy and I'm not in the mood to have my mouth on fire. \n\nWhen you get there, go to the deli counter and grab a little piece of paper that will let you mark up what you want on your sandwich. After that give it to the cashier and then they'll hand it to the sandwich counter.\n\nWent around 1:30 on a Friday and the wait wasn't bad, about 10-15 minutes.

The Korean BBQ sandwich had much more flavor, less spicy, and much more enjoyable on the taste buds. \n\nI would definitely go back to try some of there other stuff, only if I'm around the area.

Yes, I will drive all over town for good food.  So, when I heard about a Korean BBQ sandwich out there...well, off I went. Mad Mochi was on a mission! \n\nOrdered the BBQ sandwich & chicken cutlet sandwich. Prices weren't too bad about $7 to $8 and the sandwiches were a decent size. I was able to split the sandwiches with a friend and we both agreed the BBQ sandwich is the one to get. We had mild sauce slathered on it and it brought just enough heat to make your taste buds go \"OoooH!\" The meat was definitely tasty and you could taste the Korean marinade. Wished there was a little more meat but it was still all good. Couldn't help but wonder if cheese over Korean beef was a mistake but ya know what? Damn it, it worked! \n\nThe sandwich had a nice crunch. Had to put that in cause my friend kept raving about how she like the bread and how it was perfectly toasted. Loved the veggies that were nicely layered in the sandwich; it also added to the crunch factor of the sandwich. I would definitely go back for this one. Wonder if Rhea will eventually do a BBQ Chicken Korean sandwich? Now that would be hella good!!! (Rhea if you're reading...hint hint =).... \n\nOk enough of me salivating over the BBQ sandwich. Onward to the chicken cutlet. After my first bite, the thought that hit me was this looks and kind of tastes like a Bakesale Betty's chicken sandwich. There was cabbage slaw over a peppery fried chicken nestled between toasted bread. \n\nHowever, I was quickly brought back to reality when the hot sauce hit my senses and sent me reaching for my Coke Zero. Mad Mochi's taste buds were on fire.  For whatever reason, the hot sauce was a wee-bit heavy on this sandwich. Definitely it was still good - the chicken wasn't dry nor greasy and it was seasoned just right. Very flavorful and spicy. It's the Asian version of Bakesale Betty's sandwich. \n\nIn a nutshell - would I go back? You betcha! \n\nNext time I'm going to try their Korean tacos....=)", "author": "Cris H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-31", "description": "This deli/liquor store epitomizes the Mission District of San Francisco....kinda hipster, pretty small, kinda random, but serves great flavors.  I loved it!  I ordered the Korean Steak Sandwich....it was massive.  Definitely could feed two easily.  The bread was alright, not the best I've had...but the melded flavors of salty, spicy, and sweet was heaven.  The meat was marinated well with lots of flavor and not too salty.  The extras that came with it like the pickled onions and grilled onions definitely went well with everything.  You get to choose the cheese, but it's hard to blend cheese with asian flavors...but who doesn't like cheese...so just go for it.  These Deli definitely serves unconventional sandwiches and allows the ingredients to shine without any frill.  Simply food done well makes for a happy belly.", "author": "Melanie S."}

In your mouth.  Yeah.\n\nGot a Mission St (basically a reuben: pastrami, cheese, slaw, pickled jalapenos, mustard + garlic aioli held together by two fantastic slices of Tartine country loaf).  Was perfectly balanced, with each ingredient able to be distinguished without overwhelming the whole.  Salty, fatty, sweet, sour, spicy.  Just when you think the sandwich is lacking texture, you get a crunch of tartine crust, and all is right in the world.\n\nIt's also HUGE.  I ate the second half not because I was still hungry, but because I didn't want the mouth happiness to end.\n\nMiles better than that famously precarious dirty sandwich shop that shall remain unnamed.\n\nWill be back for the Korean steak sandwich.

I can't seem to wrap my head around this place (or Ike's for that matter).  Why pile so many ingredients on a sandwich instead of letting a few great ingredients speak for themselves. The Korean Beef Sando had fresh onions AND pickled onions, 2 kinds of sauce... all kinds of things that took away from the marinated beef taste. I'll stick with Bi-Rite for my sandwiches.
