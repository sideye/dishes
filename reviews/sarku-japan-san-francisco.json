I always stick to my usual, which is the chicken and shrimp over rice. It just has everything I'd ever want in my meal: rice, protein, and veggies. Such a balanced meal right? Last time I came here when it was just about to close (maybe 20 minutes from closing time) and I noticed that the cook had placed burnt veggies on my plate, of course you won't notice it after he placed the chicken on top, but since I was watching him the whole time, I definitely noticed. \n\nI don't think this will stop me from coming here because they're food really is delicious!", "author": "Nenette T."}

Just a piece of advice: just get the chicken teriyaki and rice (steamed, brown, fried rice, whatever you prefer). Everything else is not worth it. \n\nI usually go for the chicken teriyaki and fried rice but I ordered their \"daily special\" which was chicken and shrimp teriyaki with steamed rice. My mistake? thinking the shrimp would be all right. They literally only cooked one side of my shrimp. They didn't even pay attention to cooking it; it was just at the very side of the grill, being \"cooked.\" \n\nTook awhile but the other chef (the one not cooking the piles of chicken) finally returned, put a little bit of teriyaki sauce, tossed my shrimp once or twice to mix it with the sauce and then proceeded to put it in my to-go box. Like??? We can see everything you're doing, and the shrimp was not cooked. One side was overcooked and the other side practically just came out of the sea. I get that i'm not paying a lot of money here for some sub-par food, but the least they could do was cook the shrimp a little longer. disgusting. I got my food and took all the shrimp out. did not eat the shrimp. cut most of them in half and proved to myself that the shrimp was indeed not fully cooked.", "author": "Athena P."}

They don't allow any real changes to their preset format, which means wasting a bunch of money on 3/4 of a bento box I won't eat. \n\nI've never seen a Japanese salad without dressing. This was disappointing, and I've never heard of a Japanese restaurant that only serves single pieces of shrimp as an order of tempura. They don't offer any vegetable tempura, so the menu is far short of adequate. \n\nTheir staff barely speaks English, so it was a headache trying to explain to them why I didn't want my chicken and rice cross-contaminated with wasabi. (I loathe wasabi.) Anyhow, it took me years to forget my last poor experience here, so I'm sure it won't be anytime within the next few years that I'm back here. \n\nIf you want Japanese food, definitely go elsewhere, and if you like options, forget this place, but if you like poor customer service and limited options, this may be your place.", "author": "dAvid s."}

I ordered beef plate w/noodle for togo $9.75. I like the way the restaurant designed to let customers see the process the chefs cook. When my order ready to pick up, the chef will call out the food name.  I asked, is that mine. He starred at me and said yes. So I took it, didn't open the box and left.  When I had a chance to open the box , all I see was a bunch of over cooked and burned beef on top of the noodle. Can't believe he still give it to customer eventho know it already burned. My chef he's the fat guy, very unprofessional, too concentrate on his conversation, as a result, forgot about my beef.  During 5-7mins waiting my order, he was nonstop talking, talking, and talking to his colleagues, with NO face mask on, but all I hear is his voice. I thought I was inside a talk show. Probably his saliva covered all over my food!  How could he bring cancer food to the table give to customer?  Eating burned food not good to health, everyone knows, and can cause cancer for eating too much. I don't want to imagine how many customers daily had ate their burned food here!  The only person i would give star is the cashier.  i see she very responsible, concentrate and respectful her job, standby the whole time ready to help customers take order.", "author": "Epicure M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-12-15", "description": "I've been on the search for a yakisoba noodle dish since I left Toronto seven years ago. A few years ago, Sarku Japan opened up in the food court near my work place and I tried it out. It should say something when I say that it's been 3.5 years since I last ate there. Last week I was craving noodles and figured I'd try it again, not quite remembering anything good or bad about the last time I went. I ordered the soba noodles with vegetables and extra teriyaki sauce plus spring rolls. \n\nIf I'd read my review from before, I wouldn't have bothered ordering the rolls as I did wind up with a lot of extra food... again. The serving size is pretty generous and the prices are still really cheap.\n\nBut after trying both the noodles and the spring rolls, I remembered why I only went there once. The noodles are adequate with not a lot of sauce and while the vegetables were ok, just the whole thing wasn't that good. The spring rolls actually tasted pretty bad, and on top of that I had to ask for them as they seemed to have missed them in my order. \n\nWhile the price can't be beat ($6 for the two things I got) I'd rather pay more and get something that's delicious. I won't be going here again.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

I went early in the day when there was no queue and headed straight for the cash register. I was standing there while I saw the employees idly looking at me. No \"welcome, we'll be right with you in a moment, sorry!\" or anything. I don't mind waiting, but the situation felt a little awkward and I would've at least liked some feedback from the staff that I existed.\n\nWhen my food was made, the chef half-heartedly put it on the pick up counter. I said \"thank you\" and he just continued with his work with a glazed-over expression on his face. Like I said, the whole experience felt really awkward and unwelcoming.\n\nFood:\n\nTasty and affordable! I ordered a Deluxe Bento which came with your choice of protein (I opted for chicken), rice, salad, tempura and California rolls.\n\nThe Teriyaki Chicken was delicious and the tempura was pretty good too. My only complaint is that the California rolls seemed a little cheaply made. Loads of rice with only a small amount of filling led to it being less than satisfactory. However, thankfully since there are other things to be enjoyed from the Bento the puny California rolls can be easily overlooked.\n\n---\n\nI might consider coming back to Sarku Japan. Being limited in choices of good Japanese food in Westfield, it would be hard to be picky. The food is decent with affordable prices, but it's nothing out of this world to have me begging for more.", "author": "Clarissa Y."}

Be aware that they actually have two prices for the same dish.  The Teriyaki chicken combo plate (comes with rice, veggies and chicken) is 5.99 a plate without the coupon but if you use the coupon then they charge you for 6.49 a plate. Very strange indeed and totally deceptive.  It's pathetic that they play this game to get you to believe that you are getting a better deal than you actually are.  I was too hungry to argue about this after waiting for what felt like an eternity in line.  People seem to have lots of questions about their menu which is obviously confusing.  Two prices for the same dish?\n\nI noticed everyone was very young including the cooks. The average age of the employees here is probably 22 years or younger.  They look very nervous and inexperienced.  It took fifteen minutes to get through the line after giving my order in line to a girl with post-its, then giving my order again to the cashier and then showing the receipt to the cook to prove that I had paid before I was finally given permission to take my food off their tall counter top. Cumbersome! \n\nThe Teriyaki chicken was tasty and fresh.  I ordered brown rice for an additional 50 cents. The veggies were scant with two broccoli and some cabbage but overall, the dish was good comfort food.  They take the chicken fresh off the grill and directly onto your plate and the food isn't very oily.  Other fast food places like Panda Express uses way too much oil so if you're stuck at this mall then Sarku Japan is actually a good place to eat.

This place doesn't pretend to be authentic Japanese any more than Panda Express purports to be legitimate Chinese cuisine, but what they do offer is fresh food (they literally cook it in front of you), generous portions, and good value for the money.\n\n$5.99 buys you a heaping spatula full of Chicken Teriyaki, along with white rice, and veggies. For 50 cents more, you can upgrade to fried rice, brown rice, or Soba noodles, and for an extra $1.49, you can opt for 4 ounces of extra meat. \n\nIt's easy to make a healthy meal here as they provide calorie counts for all of their dishes. I'm not much of a veggie guy, so I generally opt for Chicken Teriyaki, extra meat, and brown rice. This protein-packed lunch only sets me back 685 calories and will not only keep me full for the rest of the day until a late dinner, but it also fuels me through 3-5000 meters of swimming after work. Be advised that if you opt out of veggies, they're going to load up on the rice, so if you are watching calories, eat the chicken first and then go to the rice. You'll generally be full before you can eat all of it. \n\nOne last hint: If you're trying to eat healthy, be advised that the teriyaki sauce here is awesome (possibly even laced with crack), but an extra ladle of sauce is going to carry at least a hundred calories, so if you are going to ask for extra sauce, do so sparingly.\n\nThe next time you're in Westfield, follow the cries of  \"Try Sample! Chicken Teriyaki, yummy yummy!\" to Sarku Japan. Your tummy will say \"Arigato!\"", "author": "Josh J."}

SAAAAMMPLLLLEEEE!!! \n\nMore on that later.....\n\n\nSo this place has pretty good chicken teriyaki.  For around $8, you can get double meat with brown rice, and they always top off my chicken with another small scoop of teriyaki sauce for no extra charge.  If you get regular white rice and no double meat, it's only about $6.50 including tax, no drink though.  Pretty good deal.\n\nQuick tip: It's your responsibility to keep your plate moving.  Sometimes, I have to literally move my to-go box in FRONT of the cook at the end of line so that he finally puts the chicken in.\n\nHere's where they lose two stars for me:\n\n(1) After about 5 successful lunches, I decided to splurge and try the bento box.  UM. So disappointed! The bento box was not that much bigger than their normal to-go box, so you don't get that much more food, since they have to adhere to the confines of the box specifications. The tempura was OK, but the salad was sad.  What really bugged me was that all the sauces came in these lousy to-go packets.  I was like, seriously, you're going to give me thousand island dressing from a packet like I'm putting hot sauce on my tacos from Taco Bell?  After speaking with some co-workers who also tried the bento box, they also said they were disappointed.  I will not be making the same mistake again.\n\n(2) Referencing the all caps above, their staff handing out samples are WAY too aggressive and loud.  It's ridiculous, really.  The last time I decided to eat in, rather than take-out, I even witnessed mall-goers approach the sample givers and ask them to stop yelling.  It's out of respect really.  Even though it's fast, people are still trying to enjoy their food in peace.  The seating area is a public space, and not everyone eating in the common area are patrons of Sarku.  How about the staff actually GO OUT into the mall and personally hand out samples rather than shout out over the crowd?\n\nOther than that, it's alright.
