I'm not sure if it was the chicken, rice, or anything else in the burrito but it was extremely salty. If I come back I will probably try something else. \n\nNot bad but better than chipotle.

I've had the \"Verde House Salad\" and the \"Fiesta Salad,\" both with chicken, quite a few times.\n\nBoth the salads are built on a mound of crisp (as in fresh, not fried) shredded lettuce, black beans, and chicken. It's either the cilantro lime chicken, or the chipotle chicken; they are both served warm and contrasts the cold ingredients of the salad really well. The mustard, and the chipotle based creamy dressings are both delicious but may well prove to be  calorie-bombs, so be wary of that when dressing your salad.\n\nI love the mango in the fiesta salad, as well as the salsa-avocado in it's verde counterpart, as are the sweet corn and boiled egg, depending what you chose to partake in.\n\nIn conclusion, these very generous portions of salads represent a well composed compromise between the balance of healthy and tasty.", "author": "Umesh T."}

I had a strange experience on the first visit when a well dressed, articulate black women in business attire comes in. The business has a posted policy that you must make a purchase if you need to use their bathroom, understandable. The lady complies by purchasing a coffee and by this time she is clearly dancing in place because she had to use the restroom. The manager responds by telling her that she did not spend enough money, we were both in complete shock!!!! I paid for my breakfast burrito, which by the was was bland to say the least, then I asked for the door code to the bathroom where I proceeded to give it to the lady in need. I should have posted a review right away but thought that everyone can have an off day.\n\nYesterday I came in and stood at starting point to order my breakfast burrito and waited there almost 7 minutes, clearing my voice and trying to politely get the employees attention, but they looked right through me and never acknowledging my presence. As I begin to turn and walk away, a gangly white male walks up behind me and they instantly as him if they can help him, I just thought, \"WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F\" I was furious but went on about my way and got breakfast from a much friendlier and accommodating restaurant, Focaccia, where the food was fast, hot, delicious, made fresh and the customer acknowledged was immediate and professional. \n\nI tried to give Verde a second chance but this second visit just further confirmed that this place is absolute garbage when it come to serving people.

So when a coworker said we should get burritos/Mexican food, I hadn't planned to get anything.\n\nLo and behold, he ended up choosing Cantina Verde - which I had carefully bookmarked after seeing photos of their salad. This is like a Chipotle with way more options. But with decisions comes indecision.\n\nThey have pre-set menu items and also a make your own salad. Wahoo. Of course I choose that. So I start adding everything under the sun - grilled onions, regular onions, grilled squash, cooked mushrooms, pico de gallo, corn, tomatoes, eggs (I made her pick mostly whites) and then....okay they have listed avocado is extra, but why are cucumbers 50 cents extra? Why is mango salsa $1 extra? Why? I feel like this place invites pricing confusion so beware.\n\nHowever, for $9 or so, you get a much bigger salad than elsewhere in the city. So it isn't a bad deal. It's an SF meal steal deal. Just double check what is extra and what isn't. \n\nAnyway, I am for sure returning.", "author": "Libby J."}

However, my experience can be summed as mediocre at best.\n\nI'm not sure if I missed a sign or anything, but the worse part about my experience was that there was no explicit signage pointing out the limit of extras you can put on your tacos. I assumed that we can put a bit of everything, but sadly, the worker misheard me and gave me the two things I wanted to be omitted. \n\nThe three tacos- carne asada ($1 extra), chipotle chicken, and carnitas were fine, but lacked any flavor that Chipotle has. Even homemade tacos with my friends tasted better than these. \n\nBeyond the flavor issue, I was sad to discover that they don't use fresh corn.

The ingredients just bend very well together and the chicken is grilled to perfection. Probably one of the best salads I've tried. I've also tried their Verde house salad, but would pick the fiesta over it. \n\nI didn't care for the horchata or aguas frescas here.

Ada goes above and beyond to make sure even a simple breakfast burrito spread looks like something special. She has baskets and other things like placemats that make a real difference in how the food is displayed. Most food delivery, even catering, in the Financial District is just a drop-off-and-sign-here kind of thing. Not with Cantina Verde. Ada thinks of catering the way an office manager would. She sets aside the tops to the salsa rather than throwing them out so they can go back in the fridge. She pays attention to the way people will approach the food and what order they will want to add it to their plate. I like these kind of details.\n\nNow for the food. The breakfast burritos are amazing. They are fresh with real tomatoes and plenty of flavor and quality meat. They also do vegan and vegetarian breakfast burritos that taste even better than the meat ones, which can be hard to find in the area. These are the only breakfast burritos I get rave comments about from all of the employees. They are truly different than the standard in the best way.\n\nThe taco bar we had for our happy hour was also thoughtfully assembled for our needs. Ada brought chafing dishes so the food would stay hot. She made the display look abundant, festive and inviting - something that is important when you're trying to get people out of their work minds and ready to eat and socialize. She also did all of this on very short notice. Like VERY short. Probably the most amazing thing she did (and I know this sounds tiny) is that when I forgot to order guacamole, she ran back to the store, packed some up for me and met up with me out in the neighborhood where I was picking up other stuff for our event. \n\nOne last thing: Aguas Frescas delivered in pitchers! What a great thing to add to breakfast to make it a little better.\n\nI highly recommend using Cantina Verde if you want a professional, thoughtful and delicious catering experience in the Financial District!", "author": "Kelly R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-27", "description": "\"Yeah we're kind of like chipotle, in that our set up is very similar. But we are a little different\"\n\nThat was a statement from a rather humble employee from Verde. Allow me to keep it real for him:\n\n\"Yeah we like chipotle, but better.\"\n\nBut exactly how are they better? Let's analyze under the following exhibit.\n--\nExhibit Guac:\n\nIn 2016, the second most commonly used phrase in the United States was \"You know that Guac costs extra?\". (#1 most commonly used phrase was, of course, \"The Warriors Blew a 3-1 Lead.\") Being reminded that guac costs extra is exceptionally sinister. Instantly after acknowledging the extra cost, you get to observe a Chipotle trained employee scoop up a measured and meager spoon of guac. Just as the rain of regret begins to sprinkle on your life, you witness the employee go through the final step of company protocol and begin fiercely smacking the scoop of guac against the counter to fling off any extra guac over the spoon.... to rob you of any excess guac that spilled over that calculated, pitiful spoon....The employee then shifts his eyes from your burrito and into your soul, \"Yeah homie. You done got hustled.\"\n\nGuac-enthusiasts are spared from this terrible experience at Verde. Get this: Verde employees do not remind their customers that guac costs extra, BECAUSE GUAC IS FREE!!! That's right, every customer is entitled to a healthy slab of guac on their burritos/bowls/salads. Sure, it's not a monster scoop (not that chipotle's scoop is either), but it's free! What's more, you can even add slices of avocado, in addition to your guac, ALSO FREE. No more psychological abuse from \"You know that Guac costs extra?\" No more regrets on saying yes to the guac. Verde got you covered on your guac needs.\n--\n\nJust based on the guac exhibit above, Verde already earned the epithet - Chipotle, but better. But if you want to see further proof on why Verde is Chipotle on crack, feel\nfree to check out the bonus exhibit below.\n\n--\nBonus Exhibit: Vegetarians\n\nAt Chipotle, a vegetarian burrito is either plain, or you get some bull known as Sofritas. What is Sofritas exactly? Chipotle claims that it's tofu, but our experience tells us otherwise.\n\nAt Verde, a vegetarian burrito can be defaulted into a Tofu Burrito. (Unlike Sofritas, I can attest that they're actually cubes of Tofu)\n\nThe Tofu Burrito can be accompanied by 3 of the 4 following veggies:\n\n-Mushrooms!\n-Fajitas (Chipotle has this option as well)\n-Chopped cucumbers\n-Freshly grilled onions, evident by the dude grilling them on a nearby grill\n\nAnd yes, the guac mentioned in the first exhibit can also be applied to your Veggie Burrito, FOR FREE!", "author": "Ringo M."}

I barely had time to look around at all the different toppings before I was rushed onto the next person. \n\nFor example, there were no labels so I wasn't sure which salsa was which, and when I hesitated because I wasn't sure, the lady handed my bowl to the next person on the assembly line and I had to ask him about the mild salsa.\n\nI got the bowl with white rice, pinto beans, carne asada, corn, lettuce, guacamole, and mild salsa. Unfortunately I didn't realize the mild salsa was the one with a ton of cilantro (which I can't stand) or else I would've skipped it...labels definitely would've helped.\n\nThe actual bowl was decent. Paid around $10 for it and it was pretty filling.

Doesn't compare to what you can get from a joint in the Mission or even a sketchy looking taco truck.  The burritos feel haphazardly thrown together with novice wrapping techniques.\n\nAfter I paid, I noticed I got charged 50\u00a2 for chips, which I didn't ordered.  When I asked about this, the person at the cashier said it was because I got extra dairy; extra dairy being sour cream *and* cheese.  I pointed out the \"No Charge\"  section of the menu where dairy resided and the cashier admitted that the sign needed to be updated since many customers have complained about the charge.  Having created a bit of a backup, I was refunded that 50\u00a2 probably due to exasperation.  The whole overcharging under the guise of \"No Charge\" rubbed me the wrong way.  And to boot, the food quality didn't make up for that snafu.\n\nCarnitas Burrito: The carnitas were tender, but they lacked any crispy ends that more authentic carnitas typically have.  The burrito wrap was loose, resembling a blob rather than a tightly rolled cylinder.  This made it sloppy... well more sloppy than a typical burrito.  The choose you own tortilla, rice and beans made it quite a heavy meal which would probably satisfy those focused on quantity at a reasonable price.  There were so many options, it felt like Subway.  But the risk of mass customization is that clients may not choose the best flavor profile.

What's that about? I mean even at Chipotle, its obvious inspiration, there is always somebody who wants to sit under those weird faux-Mayan wall hangings and wolf down a burrito. But not at Cantina Verde, a rather generic place from a decor perspective, and I guess people just don't want to stick around. I sure haven't been tempted. It's not ugly or unclean, it's just, well, dull. Speaking of which, can anybody remember what their menu is (photo: http://bit.ly/1AswJmT)? That's probably because it's fairly identical to Chipotle's except they claim to be fresher and healthier.\n\nMaybe. But it's also a whole lot blander like senior-center bland. I ordered the same thing both times, the $7.95 Verde House Salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1PG6ErD). BTW, it actually went up by 45-cents between visits. The salad consists of a plastic bin full of Romaine lettuce (locally sourced, of course), grilled chipotle chicken, black beans, sweet corn, tortilla chips, cherry tomatoes, hard-boiled egg, chili-dusted jicama, cotija cheese and avocado, all of it doused in a chipotle dressing. The term 'avocado' is emboldened and underlined in the menu to separate it from all the make-your-own salads that don't offer it. All of it sounded just fine, and frankly it tasted just fine.

I'm rating this a 3.5.\n\nI'm going to base my rating on a comparison to Chipotle.  I would rate Chipotle 3 stars as well.\n\nThe food at Cantina Verde tastes better.  I like the meat (carnitas in particular) better here.  I also like the flavors of the salsas better and I like the grilled peppers much better.  They also have a bit more variety here, but the menu is a little confusing and it is hard to figure out what is included and what costs extra and they don't really do a great job explaining it.\n\n6.95 is your base cost for tacos, a burrito, a bowl etc.\n\nUnlike Chipotle, you only get cheese or sour cream.  If you get a bowl, you can't get a tortilla or taco shells on the side, that is also extra.\n\nThey also don't fill the bowls up as much as Chipotle.\n\nThe guacamole is less expensive here and I did not have the chips.  A co-worker said that they did not like the chips very much.\n\nCantina Verde does have more options of things you can put in your burrito, but they all cost extra for the most part.  Make sure you check before you add something unless you are ballin and don't care.  If that is the case, add whatever your heart desires.\n\nThey also have agua fresca available, but I haven't tried them.\n\nThey have Dr. Pepper as a fountain soda option, thumbs up for that one.\n\nFrom the reviews I read, they recently raised their prices up from 6.45 to 6.95.  It still isn't bad at 6.95, but 6.45 is better.  :)\n\nFrom what I've read the breakfast burritos are pretty good, so maybe I'll have to check that out one of these days.", "author": "Ty C."}

The price is decent... or should I say the BASE price is decent. They really nickle and dime you for the ingredients that blatantly say \"NO CHARGE\" on the menu... First of all, they are REALLY stingy with their toppings, so when I asked for a little extra cheese on my burrito bowl, I was then charged 50 cents for \"Extra Dairy\" (as the employee wrote on top of my lid). I was so confused as to why I was being charged extra for \"No Charge\" toppings.... Makes no sense at all. Not to mention the mean scowl the woman gave me when I asked for a little more. Yes, lady, you are an inadequate scooper and I like more than 6 strands of cheese... deal with it.\n\nIt honestly put a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended) after I left, that I'm not sure I feel like coming back. Which is a shame because I came here often and this is a new development in recent weeks. I realize it's /only/ 50 cents, but it's more about the principle. \n\nNo charge should mean no charge.

This is one of the restaurants offered on MealPass (now MealPal) that sold what looked like a healthy salad, which is exactly what I was looking for for lunch on my visit.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've ordered at this establishment three times.\n\nFOOD: Cantina Verde offers a pretty hefty salad. It's pretty rare that I get a salad for lunch and am not hungry for something else two hours later. The salad kept me satisfied until I got home for dinner. The ingredients all tasted fresh and made for a good lunch. I've been three times now because whenever I'm looking for something healthy that I know will also be a real meal, Cantina Verde seals the deal.\n\nDRINK: I have never ordered any drinks while at this establishment since I'm always ordering and then bringing the food back to my work place. As with any restaurant I assume they have the standard assortment of fountain drinks and water.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Cantina Verde has a pretty standard made-to-order style atmosphere. I wouldn't say anything unique or special stands out about it. But at the same time I can say nothing bad about it which is a win in my book. Pro tip: the line can get very long so try and get there for lunch early.\n\nSTAFF: I've only ever talked to the staff when picking up my food. Every time the staff has been incredibly polite during the quick process.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nI haven't had anything but the house salad so I can't say much as to whether or not Cantina Verde will blow you mind food wise. I think I'll have to stop by another time and see what else they offer on their menu. But that aside, if you want a decent salad that will definitely fill you up given the portion size then Cantina Verde is a good stop.

The menu however isn't clear, like I wanted some mixed veggies instead, but they told me I couldn't get any more toppings because it only includes 4.  The carnitas was fine, but I felt like my dish was a little on the bland side, and unlike Chipotle they don't have some assorted hot sauces on the side to top it with.

Hectic as always, the line snaked around the corner in a what seemed like an irritatingly long line. Luckily, this didn't prove to be true. \n\nWe were able to quickly pass through, almost too fast tho, as I barely had time to dither between all the different fresh options -avocado, black beans, corn, overwhelming array of choices- I ended up getting a house salad with everything on it upon my coworkers advice. \n\nA great choice! Paired with my sandia agua fresca, it made for a refreshing and (what I hope was) healthy meal. It was great for the price, a pretty hefty amount of salad with good chicken breast to jicama to corn ratio.

After all, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nA lot could go wrong, as I found out.\n\nThis place felt like a mildly upgraded Chipotle, and I must say that I was quite impressed initially.  My first bite into my carnitas burrito was aromatic and full of flavor, that I actually vowed to never go back to Chipotle again!  But something bothered me... Something...  (crunch crunch).  Oh yeah, the rice was under-cooked and crunchy.\n\nFew things bother me more than crunchy rice. Seriously, rice is not that difficult to cook. To make it crunchy is just inexcusable. A bit more water and a few minutes longer in the steamer would've been nice. For the rest of my burrito, I just could not shake my hatred against the crunchy rice and focus on the nicely marinated pulled pork (carnitas).\n\nThen, there's also the kitchen... It was nice and clean at first glance. But I made the mistake of sitting at the bar/counter in front of the kitchen, and witnessed the horrors that goes on in that kitchen first hand. \n\nFirst off, the chef cleaned the grill with a short-bristle broom.\n\"Surely it was a special grill cleaner!\" You protest.\nNo, it was a broom. With a long handle. Designed for sweeping.\n\"Then it must be used only for cleaning the grill and kept clean!\" You suggest.\nNo. It went back down to the floor after use. With the bristle end on the floor!\n\nThen, there's the bucket of murky water used for cleaning EVERYTHING.\n\"Oh come'on, it was for the counter top only!\" You defended them.\nNope. It cleaned the cutting board as well.\n\"Then it was only for cleaning fully cooked stuff!\" You yelled.\nNope. It wiped up blood and marinating juice from raw meat containers too.\n\nTo be fair, most restaurants probably would be guilty of the same shenanigans. But those restaurants do them behind the door, out of sight. They don't do this in plain sight to gross people out. Seriously. Bucket of yuck here!\n\nI don't want to be mean about it and give this place only one star. After all, it's not like they molested my dog and set my jacket on fire out of malice or something like that. But the poorly trained kitchen staff who decided to put on a terrifying display for everyone to witness, and the carelessly prepared rice that was supposed to be fluffy but ended up crunchy made me wishing to never come back again.\n\nSuch a pity... The carnitas really was quite tasty.", "author": "James W."}

Their food is ok, and this place is convenient.  What drove me to Yelp them is that the older lady with glasses is exceptionally rude. They offered all veggies free when they first opened. Then, it was your pick of two of the four offered veggies.Today, it was only 1 item free and she dismissed me like I'm not even a customer. Their sign says you can have \"up to 3 of the following: bell peppers, red onions, mushrooms, zucchinni & squash. Obviously they don't care about updating their false advertising.\n\nShe was all smiles for the guy behind me, maybe because I'm female she can't turn on her feminine wiles on me and so it's not worth the extra effort? When I snagged her attention about the veggies, she tells me it's 1 item only and again dismissed me.  Ok, so you charge now - what if I wanted the extra veggies at the extra charge?  Doesn't matter, because I never got the chance to tell her I wanted the extra veggie since she again dismissed me and turned on that 1000 watt smile to again cater to the guy behind me.

I grabbed a carinitas burrito with peppers, cheese, pinto beans, white rice and salsa verde.   The good - i was surprised at the size of the protein portion.  The bad:  That was the most bland burrito I have had in a while.  Also, why are they so chintzy with salsa and cheese?  I asked twice for more than three shred's of cheese only to have in increased to nine.  I told the lady i was happy to pay more which did not help.  Even more baffling than the cheese was the salsa.  The lady filled the ladle up, then proceeded to pour 90% of it back into the container ending up with 10 small drips on the burrito.  I asked for more and once again filled it up and poured it back out.  It was almost comical.  I just quit trying at that point.

I had a habit of swinging by for guac and chips and today I decided to get a salad bowl. The menu and layout here is parallel to Chipotle. Choose a bowl, burrito, salad, etc. then your meat then your toppings. There are more vegetable options here which is why I was excited to try the food. The best part about these bowls is you can load them up. Chipotle is generous with their veggies and salsas so you're never left craving more. I was so excited for Verde's options. I asked for chicken, peppers, onions, zucchini, mushrooms, mild salsa, shredded cheese, sour cream, cucumbers and vinaigrette. This woman PISSED me off. She didn't even use the full scoop when serving. I asked for more onions, and zuchini and cheese and she just stared at me. I asked twice more, then finally she put only TWO extra pieces of zucchini and a string of onion. Same with the salsas. I asked for cucumbers and vinaigrette. I got charged $1 extra for veggies (where's my FULL second scoop?!) and 50 cents for chips which by the way are the same charge as CUCUMBERS. really?! you're charging me extra for cucumbers and for veggies you barely put on there? and you have the audacity to roll your eyes? Very disappointing. Such a bad attitude, i'm surprised you didn't spit in my food. with all the charges, I paid just under $10 for everything, which i know isn't horrible for FiDi, but If i knew service would be so horrible, I would much rather have gone to Mixt Greens, The Plant or Chipotle itself. disappointing, and not very tasty in the end.

I agree with a lot of the other reviews. The employees in the assembly line are behind a glass partition so you're struggling to hear what they're asking and you're screaming to tell them what you want. I am a 5'1 Shorty. So, it's a bit of a challenge for me. This place is great for the vegans as the veggie options are more extensive. I ordered a carnitas burrito with a bunch of stuff on it including guacamole and sour cream. A little stingy with both. Again, I agree with some of the other reviews that Chipotle, hands down has the best seasoned meat. CV is not bad, but Chipotle is better. The pros for me is that it's right outside my building and the line is 10 times shorter than Chipotle. I can deal with it. The cost of my burrito came to almost $9.

So much better than Chipotle since it gives you so many more veggie options and I like their dressing better than Chipotle too.  Their chicken is so much better too.  Chipotle's always is so fatty tasting.\n\nBut their service is what brings it down to a 2 star rating.  In fact if I were to be rating this strictly on service it would be a 0.  It is so hard to hear all of them behind the counter.  The music is way too loud, most of the people who work there don't speak English very well and they are all so soft spoken that it gets very frustrating trying to communicate with them.  The guy in front of me just now threw a hissyfit because it was so hard to communicate.\n\nWhich moves onto the next issue... When you first look at the menu you have a choice of burrito, bowl, salad or tacos and they are all listed as $6.50.  So I have always ordered the salad.  I always order the same toppings on the salad too.  Today when I got to the cash register they said it was $7.50 plus tax instead of $6.50.  I asked why and they said because it is a salad. I pointed out the sign at the far end and they said no a salad is $7.50.  I had this same thing happen to me one other time and it was explained that if I got the avocado/guac on the salad then it would be $7.50 but since I don't it should be $6.50.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-08-04", "description": "I have tried their salads a while back which were good (3 1/2 stars). Today I ordered a carnitas burrito. Tortilla is chewy and hard...like can't bite through the ends at all. The carnitas have zero flavor. This is the most disappointing burrito I have ever eaten. The service is lack luster... cashiers here always seem annoyed. Don't think I'll be returning here for a burrito ever, maybe a salad.", "author": "lenka l."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-13", "description": "Chipotle wanna-be, mexican restaurant in fidi. I had heard some good things about this place so decided to give it a shot. At first glance, the prices look very reasonable but what you get in the end is not worth it. The burrito bowl has much less quantity than that at chipotle and the ingredients at chipotle still taste more fresh to me. You can choose from a variety of proteins or just grilled veggies. I really liked the idea that all their veggies were split up and you could decide for yourself which ones you wanted. On the other hand, you had to pick one dairy option - meaning you had to pick between sour cream or cheese. If you wanted both, like me, you would have to pay 50 cents extra. Is it that bad to want both sour cream and cheese in your burrito? It is very unclear on their menu what is included and what they would charge extra for. The verde salsa was nice and tangy but besides that, nothing was spectacular. I will probably not be back again.", "author": "Malika R."}

There is a reason I keep going back - the food is awesome! \n\nI usually order a burrito.  My favorite is the carnitas, but I have tried the cilantro lime chicken and the steak, and I've even had them make me an all veggie burrito.  The proteins have great flavor.  Unlike a lot of burritos, the flavor of the meat doesn't get lost in all the other good stuff (rice, beans, etc.).  The ability to add all sorts of different vegetables into the burrito is a definite plus.  I haven't seen so many options at a taqueria-type spot before.  I really like all of the options - from the veggies, to salsas, to cheese - you can make a totally different burrito (or taco or salad) every time you go.  \n\nTo top it off, the staff are really friendly - a lot more than can be said for most of the FiDi lunch spots.  And, the price point is great, too.  I don't know too many places downtown where you can walk out with lunch for well under $10.  Overall a great experience.  Definitely recommend trying it!", "author": "F R."}

There was no line at that time which was nice, but after trying the food, I think I know why.  \n\nI went with a carnitas burrito on a wheat tortilla with brown rice, black beans, onions, bell peppers, sour cream, cheese, chipotle sauce, \"spicy\" red sauce, and fresh jalepenos.  I also got a side of chips and more of their red sauce.  \n\nI started with their chips and they were really bad, tasting like stale Mission brand tortilla chips.  Their red sauce which they claim to be spicy was incredibly bland, similar to mild Tostitos salsa.  The burrito itself was a little better, although it's not something to write home about.  The highlight was the fresh jalepenos however even those were fairly bland.  \n\nAs the place is clearly a Chipotle clone with a fresh/healthier focus, I'm going to compare them to Chipotle.  The burrito from CV seemed a little smaller, and it was way less flavorful.  The amount of meat they give you is about the same, but everything else is a bit less.  The chips & salsa from Chipotle are in a different league compared to CV, we're talking orders of magnitude better.  Even compared to other Chipotle clones like Freebird, CV doesn't compare well.\n\nIn terms of service, the folks working there were friendly and well meaning, and the turnaround time was fairly quick.  However given the lack of flavor, I don't plan to eat there again (at least not for lunch).", "author": "Nick A."}

I have been there three times so far, and have happily created something new each time.\n\nThe multiple veggie options are what really stand out for me. They are cooked perfectly and I can taste each one in the mix. I have had a breakfast burrito, tacos, and a burrito and have not been disappointed at all.\n\nMy kids also love it here!\n\nThe staff are very friendly and eager to make us customers happy.

This is a critical, unforgivable mistake.  It spoiled an otherwise flavorful and affordable meal.  I've been eating Mexican food in SF for over 25 years and have never encountered improperly cooked beans before.  It just opened, so perhaps this is just a rookie mistake, but I'm unlikely to go again, even though it's right across the street.", "author": "Philip L."}

Carnitas burrito was way more flavorful than Chipotle and there are many more options available to \"build your own\".  They've done a nice job with the decor as well.  I took to go, but will try to eat there next time as the spacing of tables and atmosphere were really nice.
