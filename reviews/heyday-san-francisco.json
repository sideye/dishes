Unlike some other chains it has only two locations in downtown. For some reason it seems to be the favorite of our office admin who orders from here regularly whenever we need a working lunch, so I've had a chance to try most of the sandwiches and salads over a period of time.\n\nI've also been here a couple of times as it is literally next door to me. They have a pretty good lunch deal where you can get a single item for $6.50, two items for $11 and three items for $15. I generally get the two item deal and get a half sandwich and small salad combination. By itself the half sandwich is pretty small (but comparable in size to other similar sandwich shops) but the salad is of decent size. There isn't any make your own salad bar so you have to contend with standard pre-made combinations.\n\nThe sandwiches are good but and comparable to what you get in Breaking Bread, Bread and Coco or Boudin, but a step below the sandwiches from Working Girls or Homegrown. The salads are much better and can stand up to Ladle & Leaf easily (my favorite is the chickpea salad). I've also tried their cookie ($3) but like the ones from any one of the Specialty Cafe's much better.\n\nPrice-wise it is right around the $12 mark for a soup\\salad and sandwich combination which is where all other sandwich places in FiDi are at. They also seem to have an online ordering option which for some reason I've not used yet, but intend to do during the next visit. Overall this is a solid candidate for lunch rotation in downtown.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

If you come by Heyday any time btw 11:50am-12:30pm M-F, expect there to be a MUCH longer line. Majority of the time the line looks longer than it is though. Upside, the staff here has got their lunch schedule hustle down! And get ppl in and out fairly quickly. \n\nMy fav order used to be the small order, with pesto pasta mushroom + kale salad with added smoked trout. Comes out to $9.50. BUTTTTT recently they switched out the pesto pasta mushroom for this healthier pasta asparagus situation. WHYYYY. Bring back the mushroom pasta!!! It was sooo much better. \n\nI believe they switch out their menu seasonally...which is likely the reason for the asparagus swap in (it's a summer veggie, right?). Fine, fine. Anywho, the small looks a lot smaller than it really is. Don't be fooled (if you're being food or money saving conscious). I used to get the large, but ppl, it's massive. I usually pour out the \"small\" onto a plate when I get back to work...you should do the same. The box is usually way too tiny to eat out of and there's a lot more food in it than you think. \n\nALSO, they have a stamp card. Didn't know this for the longest time.

My choices were the Raw Kale salad (with toasted seeds and a yogurt avocado dressing) and the Roasted Sweet Potato salad (with autumn lettuces, figs and balsamic dressing).

Until I reach my peak, this Heyday will do, especially since it represents healthy, flavorful eats during the harried lunch hour. The chef is Jeremy Scheiblauer who worked at Chez Panisse Caf\u00e9 right until the devastating fire early last month. And it was he who responded to my fumbling idiocy when I accidentally dropped my sandwich on the floor by packaging up a new one for me. I could tell just by this gesture that he is intent on exhibiting a high service ethic and is no doubt garnering repeat customers as I write this.\n\nFor years, this was the proficient yet lackluster Pasta Paradiso serving relatively unexceptional pasta dishes for indiscriminate tastes like myself, an easy lunch with that colleague you didn't know well except you knew you'd both suffer for the carb overload for the rest of the afternoon. Not so with Heyday as they focus on seasonal and organic soups, salads, and sandwiches (with top-drawer artisan Acme Bread, of course, due to the Panisse connection). I met my longtime friend and former colleague Liz, whom I hadn't seen in months, and she suggested it knowing it would be new to me.\n\nBy coincidence, I suggested Heyday as well since I just saw it on the \"Hot on Yelp\" feature list. It's light and open quite similar to Market & Rye in presentation and definitely a notch above anything you'd find at Specialties. Liz and I strategized and decided both to order the three-item lunch special for $14. That would allow us to try four salads between us and order our own sandwiches. I went for the heartier fare - the Chef's Special that day, Bulgar Wheat with Snap Peas & Herbs (quite delicious with the peas a nice contrast to the wheat) plus the Toasted Farro mixed with chopped Asparagus and Meyer Lemon (a nice toothy salad with a clean freshness) (see photo).\n\nLiz ordered the Raw Kale Salad with Toasted Seeds & Yogurt Avocado Dressing (crispy freshness with a real tang) and Marinated Beets with Pickled Vegetables (probably the most predictably executed of the quartet but solid nonetheless) (see photo). Our sandwiches were satisfying and sized proportionally to the salad servings. Mine was the Slow Roasted Turkey with a sweet-savory combination of Currants, Leeks & Mustard, all on a soft deli roll (see photo). Liz had the sweet veggie concoction of Roasted Red Onion with Ricotta Salata & Herb Jam on Focaccia. I have to admit hers was better. When we got there a little after 11:30AM, it was empty, but it crowded quickly as it got closer to noon with the queue going out to the sidewalk on Spear. Go early and enjoy.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...salads are stellar, sandwiches also well executed, somewhat overpriced but looking forward to more choices as they get rolling along\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...light and open, currently crowds very quickly close to noon\nSERVICE - 5 stars...Jeremy and crew are showing real empathy for their customers\nTOTAL - 4 stars...as I wait for my heyday, this Heyday works just fine", "author": "Ed U."}

But, I needed a detox from my vacation so decided to check them out with a curious co-worker.  Okay, it was probably my fault honestly, for the Spicy Coppa sandwich they listed I think on the overhead menu that it had whole grain mustard in it, but not on the tag in front of it in the glass case.  I was trying to decide between that and the turkey sandwich with the leek mustard, but not being such a mustard fan I went with the Coppa half sandwich (little did I know it has mustard in it) & the Asparagus Farro.  The sandwiches are all cut in half and the \"sides\" given to you are a good size.  It's mix n match 1 for $6, 2 for $10, & 3 for $14.  As someone else has mentioned, though the menu is \"healthy\" there aren't many protein options.  They have a cabbage salad side that has chicken in it but I couldn't really see any chicken, it was cabbage overload.  Just wished that they had the rotisserie chicken available for lunch because it sounds so tasty and would give another meat option.  The sandwiches are all made beforehand.  I wish some could be made at time of order upon request so I could ask for no mustard.  \n\nThe staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.  It was back to my office to eat my healthy lunch.  The bread they use was my favorite Acme!  The baguette was nice and crunchy.  There was some cheese and a layer of Coppa and lots of arugula.  The meat wasn't spicy, but the mustard was and there was so much of the grains all over the bread.  I think even if I didn't care for mustard much, it would've been much better without the mustard.  Maybe a nice aioli or a light pesto or mayo, if not plain.  I really liked the toasted asparagus farro.  It had lots of fresh asparagus & tasted like brown rice but better & the Meyer lemon was a nice compliment.  I may just come back sometime for a side of this!  \n\nAll in all, Heyday is a good option for lunch if you want something healthy.  I was full after my 2 item lunch, so portions are decent even though I usually tend to be a light eater.  If you are not opposed to mustard or are more of a herbivore definitely check them out!

Each morning of those trips, facing endless hours of counting Interstate signs and tired already from begging my parents to let me swim through the slimy flotsam in the hotel pool just one more time, I directed my best whining at the need for breakfast to be at Denny's. It had to be Denny's. Because in the late 60s and early 70s that was the only place I could reliably get a hamburger at 7:00 am.\n\nI can't really be sure if my carnivorism is due to nature or nurture, but it is a fact of my gastric identity and always has been. Imagine the difficulty I had navigating the bleak vegetarian times of the seventies and the carbohydrate happy eighties. Shudder. Dark days indeed.\n\nBut the only thing that remains constant is change and the triple whammy of Atkins/Paleo/gluten shaming has resulted in a culinary climate that speaks my language. Whenever I am contemplating my next meal, the question is usually \"where can I get tasty protein?\"\n(Which is not to say I don't love vegetables. I do. As a side dish or creating a bed for my meat. Veggies are great, veggies are fine. I especially love the current superstars like kale and brussels sprouts. But animal protein is the centerpiece of all my meals. Anything else is a snack.)\n\nI was excited to hear about Heyday, the Chez Panisse Cafe has been my favorite restaurant for 30 years. I knew the quality of food would be a cut above. Here is the set up at Heyday: There are a number of salads and sandwiches (half sandwiches really). You may get one item for $6, 2 for $10, or 3 for $14.\n\nMy first impression on walking into Heyday was \"where is the food?\" The only protein is in the half sandwiches, and even in those it is in condiment portions. I faced a dilemma. I did not want two \"sandwiches\" (1/2 sandwiches) since that would be a boatload of bread when all I really wanted was more meat. So I settled for the turkey sandwich, the kale salad and the farro salad. What the fuck is farro? It is not \"giving birth to a litter of pigs\" as I originally thought, it is, rather, an Italian grain. Ok.\n\nThere was about 1 ounce of meat on that plate. The salads and sandwich were very very good. I'm sure the food is organic and locally sourced, if you are a vegetarian or even better, vegan, this might be a real find.\n\n...but I could not get past feeling ripped off for paying $14 for a plate of stuff that my food eats.\n\nI enjoyed my $15 hamburger at Town Hall yesterday MUCH more.", "author": "Leigh C."}

The food here isn't terribly exciting, but it consistently tastes fresh and good for you.  Plus, it won't put you into a food coma.  \n\nPortion sizes are a little small, but eating 2 items is usually enough for me to be satisfied if I am not super hungry.  I always get half servings of salads for more variety (i.e. 4 salads in a 2-items container).  I always get the cabbage & chicken slaw as one of my items (partially because it is the only salad with meat in it, partially because it is delicious).  Also, the portion sizes of the salads seem more substantial than the sandwiches.\n\nOverall, it is a great place to get a lot of fresh veggies and leafy greens for lunch in the Financial District for $10.  I usually go later (around 1:30pm) because there isn't a line, and the portions are a little more generous at that time.  The only downside is that sometimes they run out of things by then, but they usually have the cabbage & chicken slaw still.", "author": "Amy C."}

The sign on the window offering a unique fritatta with what sounded like yummy cheeses and veggies drew me in.  I was sad to find that the special I saw was for lunch and I was too early for that.  Instead I ordered 2 of the 3 breakfast options - Strauss Creamery Greek Yogurt with a bran muffin - the other main option was steel cut oatmeal and there were several other pastry options.  \n\nI feel like they offer breakfast as a convenience only since employees are already in the cafe preparing all of the fresh produce, breads, and meats for lunch.  I must say that for a convenience meal it was darn good!  I've never had a more creamy, soft tasting Greek yogurt.  I almost don't want to eat the stuff I'm used to anymore...I will seek out this brand and see if i can get it in Texas...yes, that good!  The house-made toppings included 2 types of granola, brown sugar and a few others that I don't remember.  I added brown sugar and granola.  The muffin, while a little dry around the edges, had a fluffy middle and a crusty top that was tasty.  \n\nOverall a tasty, healthy breakfast.

The salad was in a smaller \"side\" container which did not surprise me (probably weighed about  a quarter of a pound), but the sandwich was approximately 2 inches x 1.5 inches- it was, literally, 3 bites.  Had I just ordered the sandwich, this tiny morsel would have cost $6.  \n\nOf course I could have ordered a 3-item lunch for $14, but that is out of my budget for lunch. \n\nThe flavors were nice, but not so complex that $10 would be warranted.  For $10, I expected more.  I hope the guys at HeyDay either make their portions bigger or reduce their prices.  Unless they do, I cannot warrant such an expense for lunch. Their fast service and pretty space will not be enough to bring me back.", "author": "noelle s."}

I usually go for the two item combo which is about the right amount of food for me for lunch. However, given the portion size, I think they are quite overpriced. I only go to them in a pinch because of their easy online order system and pickup. My favorites are the squash sandwich and the chickpea salad.", "author": "Whitney G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-01", "description": "Finally a healthy AND delicious lunch place in downtown SF! \nI went there for their opening party this weekend where all items on the menu had been prepared and I sampled each one. Their roasted onion sandwich on focaccia was to die for (I had 3), and so was the raw kale salad with avocado dressing and the chickpea and quinoa salad. You can immediately tell that what they are doing is miles away from your run-of-the-mill \"deli\" (of which there are 3 within a block), the ingredients they use are all top notch (locally sourced organic produce, ACME bread, in-house slow roasted turkey meat, etc) and every item on the menu is not only beautifully crafted but flavorful and complex. They make their own mayo and do their own pickling or veggies (I wish you could buy jars of their pickled onions and carrots).\nOrdering options are straightforward yet creative (you can choose a combo with 1, 2 or 3 items, mixing and matching sandwiches and salads).\nThe space is sleek and unpretentious and the staff is super friendly and proud of what they are doing.", "author": "Andreas B."}

This is a block from my office which is super convenient, and the ever-changing menu keeps it fresh. The flavors were awesome in both salads. My only gripe with the Cabbage and Chicken Slaw was the three tiny shreds of chicken I got -_- Overall pretty legit. I'll try more from them when I don't pack lunch.", "author": "Lauren Q."}

And this ain't doin' it. \n\nThey should take a look at Il Cane Rosso, which is WAY better in my opinion. You get just enough more for your money, the menu changes all the time and the food is amazing. The food at Heyday is just okay; I feel like the original recipes were probably right-on but the daily execution suffers slightly. The sandwiches are good but not mind-blowing...the kale salad is good, but slightly too tangy (for me). Most dishes I've tried just need slight adjustments or a little more oomph. Nothing strikes as something I couldn't easily make at home.\n\nPortion wise, just make them slightly bigger! Everybody I know who has eaten here has commented - negatively - about the size, and many of my male colleagues won't be going back.", "author": "Jasmine W."}

The food is good and goumet, but you need to order the 3 item lunch option for any sort of reasonable caloric intake and that is $14.  Hence the 3 stars.  It's bordering on ridiculous.  The sandwich had less than an ounce of meat on it, too.  I work half a block away, so I was hoping this would be a viable lunch option. It's really not.  They either need to increase the portion sizes or adjust the pricing.  I'm hoping they tweak their approach a bit.  This one has potential.", "author": "Gary R."}
