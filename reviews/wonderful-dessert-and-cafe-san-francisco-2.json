I have been coming to this location ever since I was a little kid and it was and still is my go to. This boba spot is the only location that is opened until midnight and that is one of the many things I love about it. \n\nI usually order either the Tapioca Milk Tea ($3.75) or the Strawberry Tapioca ($4.75) and every so often, I'll order the popcorn chicken ($7.50). Their tapioca milk tea is the best Hong Kong style milk tea I've had in the city. It is the perfect combination of milk and tea and their boba is always consistent. However, I do know this type of milk tea flavor is not everyone's favorite (some of my friends and other people I know that have tried it thinks it tastes like coffee). The Strawberry Tapioca has two options: powder strawberry or fresh strawberry. And both options are really good. If you're looking for something sweet and refreshing, I would recommend the fresh strawberry boba. And if you're looking for something just sweet and a little different, the powder strawberry tapioca is great too. Although it's weird (and probably not the healthiest) that they use strawberry flavored powder to make it, it's surprisingly SO good. Lastly, their salt and pepper popcorn chicken is probably one of my top favorite pop corn chickens in the city. It does take a little while to make it, but it's completely worth the wait. The chicken is crispy on the outside, juicy and hot on the inside, and it's also topped with salt, pepper, basil leaves, and you have the option of making it spicy. \n\nIn addition to being a boba shop and having some food options, they also have a wide variety of candy, dried fruits, and they make their own tea eggs. Everything about this shop is very straightforward. No matter how long the wait is, they always make your order within a reasonable amount of time and if you aren't satisfied with your drink or you need adjustments, they'll fix it with no hesitation. In addition, they are open until midnight, which has been very convenient for me when I get those late night cravings. The only down side about this spot is it's cash only. But other than that, I would 200% recommend this location!!", "author": "Victoria H."}

Their popcorn chicken though.. let's talk about that.\n\nThey make some darn good popcorn chicken or on their menu, salt and pepper chicken. Chicken is cooked properly, outside is crispy, fried basil is on point, batter is salted nicely but still has a sweet taste to it. It's good!! But not $8 good. A small little bag was $8, at that price point I need a little more please and because of that I probably, most likely, won't be going back. Except, maybe, for their boba. But like I said, this review isn't about that. \n\nIf you want to try it, go for it, just FYI, it's CASH ONLY.

The inside is dimly lit, doesn't look very clean, and half of the menu is handwritten. Very hole-in-the-wall.\n\nWe got a papaya smoothie with boba and a Thai tea with boba. The smoothie and the tea were actually decent, but nothing really amazing (I thought the papaya smoothie was pretty good in the beginning, but halfway through it didn't taste that good anymore). The boba, however, was very disappointing. It was mushy on the outside, but somehow tasted slightly undercooked in the center; it was also almost tasteless.

This was the only place opened at the time and I decided to give it shot. Now that I moved to SF, this is one of my bf's and my go-to spots! \n\nThe appearance of the store is very underwhelming but the drink quality definitely makes up for it.

The store name has \"desserts\" in it but I don't really see any dessert item on the menu....There's also no seats in the store except for one table.... LITERALLY one table. If you are going to come here with friends, don't expect to be staying long because the table only seats 4 people. \n\nI've only tried their white gourd tea and that's enough for me to want to come back multiple times.

It reminds me of this little hole in the wall I used to frequent as a child before boba became an industry in the US, when all drinks were served in snap lid cups and boba cost $1.75. The good ol' days. (sigh)\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nThe only thing I get here is the classic boba milk tea...sometimes I branch out and try the boba green milk tea. The reason being that most of the drinks are prepared from flavor powders, which I'm not really into. The milk tea will grow some hair on your chest though, which I love. This isn't somewhere where you ask for 30-50-70% sweet, the most customization I dare venture for is ice/no-ice. The boba here is hit or miss. Most of the time it's great...I even left some in the fridge overnight and it was still the right side of chewy in the morning. Sometimes though, it's overcooked and you just get a mouthful of mush. Those are dark days.\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nA small boba milk tea here is $3.25, which is about $.50 less than you would pay at a more modern boba shop. However some of their other customizable drinks can run closer to $4, which really is no different from other places, though the quality of ingredients elsewhere would probably be higher.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nWorkers here are efficient. Pro-tip: if you're a paying customer and you're lucky, they'll let you use the employee bathroom. I've seen them turn people away though!\n\nBonus star because I always come here when I'm not feeling i-Tea and I always bring my friends who would appreciate a boba blast from the past.", "author": "Abby W."}

The good elements were that the green tea flavor was strong, it seemed they had soaked it in the tea leaves for quite a bit longer which was quite nice. The boba was also decent, though it was more of just a plain sugary flavor.\n\nThe bad elements were that the passionfruit did taste quite a bit artificial, like some so-so syrup was mixed into the boba itself.

The number of miles we traveled for boba is numerous, but he never complains. (He's the best!)\n\nTraveling to San Francisco for boba is definitely a hassle, from the bumper-to-bumper traffic to the horrendous parking situation, but we were lucky enough to find a spot practically right in front of Wonderful Dessert & Cafe. At first glance, I was VERY hesitant about the boba here. It's a shop that serves Asian \"candy\" (not all of them are sweet, but people do eat them for fun) and your typical candies, and then boba as well. The menu is written with markers on poster paper and the names are a bit confusing. For instance, one drink was called almond tapioca, leading me to believe it was only a cup with almond flavored tapioca pearls, but it's actually a milk tea WITH tapioca. \n\nKeeping an open mind, I ordered the green milk tea with tapioca and the hubby chose Thai tea with tapioca. I really dislike cash only policies, but the prices here are dirt cheap, so I suppose it makes up for it. There are two cup sizes, but we just went for the regular small one. I took that sip and felt my eyes grow ten times in size.\n\nPERFECT...I was astonished! It was probably one of the best green milk teas I have ever had. It was herbal, it was creamy, and it was sweet. I went to town! And the tapioca pearls were just as perfect. They had that delightfully chewy texture and was sweet as well, but they never overpowered the drink. I will say they gave us way too much though. The hubby's Thai iced tea had a good bitter undertone that contrasted with the sweet, creamy base very well. He finished the whole cup in no time.\n\nWonderful Dessert & Cafe is probably one of the most run-down places we've ever been to for boba. Decor is nonexistent and the candy selection is confusing and random. The menu is strange and the cash only policy is annoying, but the boba...my goodness, the boba was amazing. \n\nPerhaps I should let the hubby choose all of our boba destinations from now on because he clearly knows what he's doing.

I've been coming here almost every day, sometimes multiple times a day for the past few months because I'm so addicted. So smooth and creamy. They make me so happy. They put avocados, milk, ice and sugar I think. They put some brown sauce in it and even when I order no boba, it kind of tastes like boba, so maybe it's boba sauce. They also taste it with a stick before pouring it out to make sure it tastes okay and if not, they add more sugar or something. The boba is also extremely chewy and tender like a mochi. But sometimes I spit it out because I got teeth issues and can't swallow. Not too hard, not too soft. \n\nThe truth is, the smoothie quality is not always consistent. It really depends on who's making it. There are some people who make really good avocado smoothies, like the owner lady and this other young Asian girl. There are some other people who make the smoothie so watery!! It needs to be smooth and creamy. But it's still good though. Maybe they just don't have enough experience. \n\nThey have tons of different bulk candy and dried fruits and Asian dried snacks. Not really seating here. They have machines where you put quarters in and get a plastic ball with a little toy in it. But I think the machines are empty. It's a more down to earth mum and pop kind of place instead of a boppity hipster place. So it's a more comfy vibe. It's nice that it's open until midnight.", "author": "Amanda L."}

Powdery drinks (those places that simply have a plastic carafe that they pour out of ) and boba that tastes \"old\" get docked on my rating scale. \n# 1 Itea *Rod Boba SF Rating * 9/9 *Rod's Yelp Rating *5 stars \n# 2 Puppy bobar *Rod Boba SF Rating * 8/8 *Rod's Yelp Rating *5 stars \n# 3 Asha Tea House *Rod Boba SF Rating * 7/9 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 4 Caffee Central *Rod Boba SF Rating * 7/8 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 5 Cool Tea  *Rod Boba SF Rating * 7/8 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 6 The Boba Shop *Rod Boba SF Rating * 7/7 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 7 Good Earth Caf\u00e9 *Rod Boba SF Rating * 7/7 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 8 Hanlin Tea *Rod Boba SF Rating * 6/7 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 9 Keep it *Rod Boba SF Rating * 6/6 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 10 Wonder Tea *Rod Boba SF Rating * 6/6 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 11 Tpumps *Rod Boba SF Rating * 5/7 *Rod's Yelp Rating *4 stars \n# 12 The Ramen Bar *Rod Boba SF Rating * 6/5 *Rod's Yelp Rating *3 stars \n# 13 Sharetea *Rod Boba SF Rating * 5/5 *Rod's Yelp Rating *3 stars \n# 14 Tanca *Rod Boba SF Rating * 5/5 *Rod's Yelp Rating *3 stars \n# 15 Boba Guys *Rod Boba SF Rating * 5/5 *Rod's Yelp Rating *3 stars \n# 16 Steep (not Steap) *Rod Boba SF Rating * 5/5 *Rod's Yelp Rating *3 stars \n# 17 T&T Caf\u00e9 *Rod Boba SF Rating * 5/5 *Rod's Yelp Rating *3 stars \n# 18 E Tea *Rod Boba SF Rating * 4/6 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 19 Steap (not Steep) *Rod Boba SF Rating * 4/5 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 20 Maggies Caf\u00e9 *Rod Boba SF Rating * 4/4 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 21 Sweet Heart Caf\u00e9 *Rod Boba SF Rating * 4/4 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 22 Honeycreme *Rod Boba SF Rating * 4/4 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 23 Elixiria *Rod Boba SF Rating * 4/4 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 24 Quickly *Rod Boba SF Rating * 4/4 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 25 Plentea *Rod Boba SF Rating * 4/4 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 26 Mi tea *Rod Boba SF Rating * 3/3 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 27 Ten Ren Tea *Rod Boba SF Rating * 3/3 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 28 Wonderful Foods/Dessert & Caf\u00e9 *Rod Boba SF Rating * 3/3 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 29 Out the Door *Rod Boba SF Rating * 3/3 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars \n# 30 I Caf\u00e9 *Rod Boba SF Rating * 3/3 *Rod's Yelp Rating *2 stars", "author": "Rod M."}

It actually looks more like a candy store than a boba spot since their menu is hidden on the side of the wall. However, fear not fellow Yelpers because their boba drinks deserves more credit than meets the eye. It was a pretty chilly day so I ordered their taro milk tea hot. It was delicious! The tea was incredibly silky and had the right amount of sweetness. I gave my friends a taste and they all liked it as well. They also have fruity drinks on their menu. I didn't get to try any myself, but I didn't hear any complaints from the boo about his watermelon juice. Note that this is a grab and go kind of place. There was only one table inside which seems to be intended for customers waiting for their drinks. Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by this boba shop.

It looks a bit run down and there's a lot of empty space that could be filled with more tables and chairs. \n\nHowever, one look at the menu and none of that matters. The menu is extensive - it covers every flavor of bubble tea (I'm from the East Coast) that you can imagine. There are the traditional milk teas, but there are also fruit flavors and fresh fruit smoothies. The prices are not  cheap, but bubble tea has stopped being cheap years ago. \n\nI opted for the avocado smoothie with tapioca made less sweet, which came out to be $5.75. I usually don't spend much on drinks, but this was worth it. The smoothie was incredibly creamy, with only a slight hint of sweetness, which I prefer. Nothing beats the taste of fresh avocado and it really comes through in this smoothie. What really knocked me away was how good the tapioca balls were! Perfectly chewy, they bounced back on my teeth. They also tasted like they had been soaking in some kind of malted syrup. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area!

Their selection isn't huge, but it's pretty diverse. I tried the regular milk tea as well as Thai tea. Both drinks were great, and the tapioca pearls were about as good as I've had. \n\nI wouldn't rate this place particularly high for service or decor, but I don't think that's why you would choose this spot.

I started to order and ask if things were fresh or made out of powder. The gentlemen explained the top stuff is made of powder and the below stuff is fresh. I wanted fresh so I ordered a taro and a mango smoothie. We watched the guy wash his hands (no soap) he just rinsed his hands and started making the drink. The ice dispenser was fully opened and he never closed it and it was never closed when we were in the store. The guy then proceeds to make the drink and he doesn't even put a lid on the blenders when they are going. He kept looking over the blender (please don't drop hair in my drink I think). We then get our drinks. I was so disappointed with my drink. I barely drank any of it. I got the mango drink and with each sip I had to spit out mango hairs. Really!?! I was soo mad.

Located in the middle of Irving's mini-Chinatown, it's an perfect place grab boba after a meal and a stroll.  Despite not being a chain (its owners do own other boba places), Wonderful's is ubiquitous, synonymous with SF boba, and can go head-to-head with any other boba place in the city.\n\nThe selection is impressive, and though they've been out of certain drinks (like Oatmeal or Sesame) for a while, they can make Durian or Bittermelon drinks (if you like that sort of thing), to name a few.  I'm a big fan of variety and customization/made-to-order, and Wonderful's is very good at accommodating allergies (they can substitute regular dairy milk with soymilk, almond milk, coconut milk, or powdered milk), and can add/remove toppings.  Furthermore, Wonderful's does use real fruit, so you can taste the difference between that and the powdered stuff in other boba places.  Wonderful's is also open pretty much most of the day and night, so unless you find yourself craving boba at 2 in the morning, you can still make it to Wonderful's.  Though lines occasionally get long, the service is very efficient, so you won't be waiting for excessive amounts of time.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for boba, they also have a large assortment of candy, Chinese snacks (dried fruit, cuttlefish, or beef jerky), popcorn chicken, and tea eggs.\n\nBeing from the area and having gone to Wonderful's since it opened, I do have a few gripes.  The first is that it's been getting relatively expensive; the drinks have progressively been raised in price to the point where many of the drinks cost around $5 (compared to only $3.50-4.00 when they first opened).  You're much better off getting candy across the street at Walgreen's too.  The second is that there is VERY little seating, which regulars know, and most people either stand and loiter, or simply order and leave.  Lastly, I personally don't think Wonderful's tastes any better than any other boba place (when you're not getting a fruit drink), though most of my boba snob friends see differently.  The boba is slightly better, but the tea flavor isn't something I'd brag about.  \n\nOverall, Wonderful's is what it is: convenient, diverse, and expedient.  If you're visiting SF, try it out.  And if you're from SF, you've likely already been here a hundred times over.", "author": "Matthew W."}

The perfectly chewy texture and natural flavor of Wonderful's boba pearls, paired with the nuanced flavors in their drink offerings, are unmatched.\n\nMy drink of choice is what the caf\u00e9 dubs \"Mango Tapioca.\"\n\nWhich brings me to the incident that led me here. This past weekend, my boyfriend and I each ordered a \"Mango Tapioca,\" just like any other typical Saturday night. The store was relatively empty, with only two other people inside, so I can't determine any sort of justification the workers had for committing their single act of treason against us. There was no rush, there was time to cut up more mangoes if there was a shortage (don't think we didn't see the twenty boxes of mangoes beside the sales counter), there was the opportunity to ask us if we wanted something different.\n\nWe noticed our drinks were taking an inordinately lengthy amount of time to prepare and watched one of the workers make a couple trips from behind the counter to a storage closet, to back behind the counter, to the storage closet, and we knew something was up.\n\nHowever, without communicating the problem, which we guessed had to do with the depletion of an ingredient, one of the workers called out \"Mango\" (after we observed her taste-testing the compromised beverage) and placed our drinks on the counter without another word. We walked up to the counter, immediately discerning the pale, off-yellow color of the concoction, and thanked the worker.\n\nIt's not that the drink was horribly offensive by any means. It actually tasted okay. It just wasn't what I ordered. I'm writing this review because this place got me fucked up, having the audacity to mix some other nonsense in with my mango drink and thinking I wouldn't know the difference. I want those two workers to know, I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, and I'm highkey hurt that they would disrespect me like that.\n\nI'm getting heated thinking about how this place did me dirty, but even so, this experience won't stop me from frequenting the caf\u00e9. That's how good it is.\n\nSo, I just wanted to say...... fuck this place. I'll be back next weekend.", "author": "Kristen C."}

First off, this place is cash only so we went had to run to the ATM before hand. My husband and I both ordered tapioca drinks, his was a taro milk tea and mine was a taro milkshake (I normally order taro milk teas but wanted something more creamy this time). Upon receiving and trying our drinks, I found that mine was white in color and very sandy in texture. My husband's drink was the typical purple color of all taro drinks. Therefore, my expectation was the same for mine. I asked the female employee working at the register why it tasted this way and she told me that's how \"real\" taro tastes. I explained to her that I could not drink such a sandy drink and I asked her if they can make me something different. She refused and when we asked for a refund we were also refused. One important fact- the menu did NOT specify that the drink was \"real\" taro. So I ended up waking out empty-handed. \nSo please note: don't order something you're not familiar with and bring cash. \nIf you're looking for some good boba... try Boba Guys!

I had this place bookmarked for the longest time but I don't think the actual drink matched up with any of my yelp expectations. \n\nThe drink itself was a pretty fair price (2.75) and the boba was pretty good. But the main thing was that the milk tea tasted off. My friend and I were trying to pinpoint why it tasted kind of off and I think our conclusion was that it tasted a little watered down in flavor. Maybe it's just the way they do it but I don't think I'll be trying that drink again. Definitely not authentic Taiwanese boba but would be open to trying some other things.", "author": "Andrew C."}

Wonderful is the O.G. of boba stores in SF. It has been around since I was in middle school and it was the the first place I drank boba. I remember when they used to be located next to where Quickly is now. That is how O.G. they are and they have been serving boba for 10+ years. That's is how much experience they have making boba drinks. \n\nThe only thing they need to add to make then even more perfect is more indoor seating to encourage m customers to hang around and socialize. It doesn't have a inviting atmosphere unlike other boba places. Also a customer reward system would be nice like a free drink for every 10 drinks. \n\nTL:DR Wonderful is a staple boba store that's been around for a decade. Its only caveat is its need to modernize to accommodate new needs.", "author": "Jude N."}

Springy, chewy, sweet, and it was just the right size. However, the drink it was sitting in was bland, and felt watered down. Maybe I ordered the wrong drink, but Green Milk Teas are one of my favorites, so this just didn't do it for me.\n\nBesides their drink menu, they have a bunch of candies by the pound and an assortment of dried and wet Chinese plums/prunes that I actually was very interested in.

I must admit I had a Teaway phase, when they were first introduced in 2009 and monopolized Irving St. with their cheap prices, but Teaway's  tapioca quality has fluctuated a lot, always inconsistent in texture and taste.\n\nWonderful Foods Co has always been consistent with their drink and tapioca quality. Tea-based drinks are always refreshing and delicious. Tapioca balls are always mildly sweet, firm, and slightly chewy without being overly mushy or undercooked. I usually order a regular milk tea, green milk tea, or Thai iced tea here. I don't consider myself very adventurous with trying new flavors because I'd hate to waste a large drink if I dislike it.\n\nIn addition to drinks, Wonderful Foods Co has \"food\" items as well, from 30+ overpriced and different types of sugary candies to a more limited selection of fried snacks such as fried chicken, fries, etc. However, people usual go to Wonderful Food Co for drinks. They might as well change their name to \"Wonderful Drinks Co\".", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Unfortunately it was a little too sweet for my liking. I guessed that the almond ingredient they used was already a little on the sweet side to begin with. My girlfriend had her usual milk tea with boba and she's very happy with it. \n\nSecond time, I was there at around 11 pm for some late-night boba. I got grass jelly tea with boba (with less sugar) while my friend got lychee milk tea with boba. Both drinks were fantastic! The lychee milk tea contained real lychee bits, which was a pleasant surprise to both of us. The grass jelly is legit; from all the boba places I have tried so far, this is the only place that serves the real, bitter (yes, original grass jelly is made with very little or no sugar and tastes bitter) grass jelly. \n\nThe shop also sells candies in individual containers and reminds me of my childhood.

Half of the place is a candy shop - which makes the whole place smells amazing - and the other half is the drinks portion. The place is very low key and simple but it doesn't need any fancy decor to announce how good their drinks are. \n\nAlmond tapioca:\nNot a big fan of almond tea UNTIL I tried it here. It taste like the asian almond powder drink without the powdery taste. It has a good mix between sweet and milky which is a good combo for those who doesn't have a big sweet tooth.  Never too overcooked or undercooked, the tapioca was on point. \n\nMint Green Tea Tapioca:\nThis isn't a common order for me but I wanted to try something minty to change things up. The minty portion I believe comes from a syrup so it wasn't bitter. The green tea flavor isn't as strong so the drink was more milky. \n\nP.S. One thing that I really like about this place is that you're drink isn't 70% ice and 30% milk tea.

And yes, I'm calling it tapioca rather than boba because a few non-Cali kids have called me out on it -__- HAPPY NOW?\n\nSo I was torn on what to order because I like sesame and oatmeal but wasn't sure I could commit to those flavors in liquid phase, and other reviewers had said the longan tea was no bueno and that the mint green tea was devoid of mint flavor. I was considering the honey green tea or the papaya milk tea, but my indecisive mind finally settled on the PLUM GREEN TEA with TAPIOCA, $3.25, $3.53 after tax.\n\nDon't get the plum green tea -___-\n\nI was hoping that they would be gentle on the sugar. Alas, I was disappointsed. I guess I should give them credit for staying true to the sharp sweetness of Asian dried plums. But I would rather have the plums in solid phase then.\n\nI will say that their tapioca is quite good. A bit petite in size, with a pleasantly consistent chewiness. Getting the drink warm probably helped with pliancy too.\n\nMy friend got #22 ALMOND JELLY with TAPIOCA  and HONEY, $3.75 I think. The almond jelly looks like it was cut up from this big almond jelly block (imagine something that looks like a block of tofu...but it's almond jelly...here, look at Trishya M's picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wonderful-dessert-and-cafe-san-francisco-2?select=ywy4Rxr0pi4xANS1a7Jw4A#i5Zs8LjFkBq7K5F9MxHDww).

I would give it more of a 3.5. Sure, the service is quick, but I don't think people were noticeably friendly. The employees weren't mean, but they didn't exhibit exceptional customer service. I don't know if I could easily strike up a conversation with them-- maybe because it was a long day and they weren't really up to talking to a complete stranger.\n\nThe boba, by far, is one of the chewiest I've ever tasted. The milk tea, however, tasted sweet. It's interesting how they don't ask to adjust the sweetness level. I read in other reviews that you could really taste the tea, but I'm not sure why I wasn't able to taste it because it was masked by the milk and sugar. Next time, I might try the passion green tea because I've been to two places so far & both places have hit it  out of the ballpark for me (Purple Kow & Ten Ren Tea). Overall, the tapioca milk tea wasn't anything all too special (aside from the boba). At, $3.25-$3.75 each, I might give another flavor a try next time. On a side note, this place is CASH ONLY. \n\nThe store itself is small. They also sell candy in plastic containers, just like what you would find at a Sweet Factory or It'Sugar at the mall. It's $2.50 per quarter pound as of 5/12/14 (who knows? prices may increase). There's metered parking just outside (free after 6PM). It's $2/hr anytime before 6PM. If you're looking for free parking around that time, there's always free 2 hour parking in nearby residential areas, but you may have to walk a small distance.

Sure, they don't have those cute cups that don't fit into your car's cup holders, they don't ask you how sweet you'd like your drink, or if you want green tea or black tea.

However, I was not a fan of the taro milkshake. I generally love taro and artificial taro flavor but this drink fell flat for me. It seemed like there was absolutely no sweetness added and it may have been almost pure taro because the consistency was very starchy -  kind of like paste and a little grainy. For me the flavor wasn't really there especially since I was looking for a dessert type treat for after dinner. I prefer artificial taro smoothies to this drink. On the plus side, I thought the bubbles were cooked perfectly. I probably won't be back because I really struggled to force myself to finish my drink. But who knows, maybe some of the other items on their menu are good.", "author": "Johanna H."}

The only drink I've had here was their Jasmine Green Milk Tea, but it's so good that I keep coming back whenever I find myself in their neighborhood. They give a lot of boba with their drinks, and it's a lot better than the hard stuff other stores give you. Unfortunately, I got my dog hooked on their boba, so whenever he sees me with a to-go coffee cup, he assumes I have boba to feed him (oops...).\n\nIf you order their hot drinks, they just take the cold drinks and microwave it. If you order your drinks hot, they also charge you an extra $0.25 to microwave your drinks. I don't mind paying a little extra for it, since my drink costs about $3 with the extra charge, but I thought it would be good to know and share. How hot the drinks are also differs depending on the person making the drink. I've had it from lukewarm to scorching, tongue-burning hot.\n\nIn addition to the drinks, they also sell tea eggs and a large variety of candy. Keep in mind that this place takes cash only, so make sure you have some on you when you visit!", "author": "Tina T."}

I would recommend trying the oatmeal milk tea for a different experience from typical boba shops.\n\nThe candy selection is also a very nice touch. My favorite is the chocolate covered gummy bears.

I mean, when a place like Wonderful Foods has almost entirely four and five star reviews I feel like, yes, this place is going to have the best boba in the City. But, alas, I was really underwhelmed.\n\nMaybe I've been living in Taipei too long, maybe I'm just \"too\" Taiwanese, but the boba at Wonderful Foods was not wonderful.\n\nDuring my last visit to San Francisco my friend took me to Wonderful Foods having heard a lot about it himself. Both interested in what all the hype was about, we decided we had to try this place.\n\nMai3le5:\n- Tapioca Milk Tea\n- Almond Milk Tea with Boba\n\nUpon entering the shop I was a little taken aback by the \"ghetto-ness\", but often times it's these types of places that have the best stuff. Also, I heard the lady behind the counter speaking some Taiwanese so I immediately had high hopes.\n\nI decided that I'd get the standard Tapioca Milk Tea. I feel like the best way to test a tea place is by getting the most basic of teas because if you can't get that right...I appreciated that I was able to customize my drink since I don't like drinks of any sort that are too sugary; however, I found the tea to be rather watered down...Now, I don't know if it's because I got my tea with only 1/3 sugar that it ended up watery, but there really isn't any reason that the sugar content should effect the consistency of the drink. Also, the boba was kind of mushy :( I never expect perfectly \"QQ\" boba in the US, mostly because I rarely find it (I even used to work at a Tapioca Express in the college days), but this was barely even \"Q\". \n\nMy friend got the almond milk tea, which was okay.\n\nI feel like maybe we just came on an off day, or maybe we got the last of a batch, or maybe I'm just too picky about my boba and milk tea because I live in the land that originated the stuff.

I had some really good boba down there and when I moved to SF, I tried to find a replacement. \n\nWonderful Foods came up on my search and I figured that it was a must-try with its reviews. I made the trek out to Outer Sunset and upon arriving, I was surprised by the mom/pop-esque nature of the shop and the Chinese/English menu on the wall. I was hopeful. My go-to drink when visiting a boba place for the first time is a milk green tea with boba. I figure if the basics are good, then other teas are also probably good. That, plus you can get a good sense of boba consistency. \n\nThat first time, and every time I've been since (about 5), the milk tea hasn't been amazing, is usually too sweet (even if I ask for less or half sweetness), and the boba is usually too chewy.  \n\nWith that being said, the tea is slightly better tasting compared to surrounding Outer Sunset boba places(Tpumps, Honeyberry, Teaway, Quickly). If you're trying to decide on a spot around the area, I'd say choose here over the other places.\n\nNote: I'm giving this 3 stars for SF standards, but I think I might only give it a 2 if there were SoCal boba places up here.", "author": "Mario Z."}

In short, I don't get the hype, and I probably wouldn't return.\n\nThis is a small sweets shop with literally one table and two walls lined with candy and Asian dried fruits sold by price per pound. I didn't try any of those, but they have a lot of variety.\n\nI opted for the almond milk boba while my friend got the avocado boba. I asked for less sugar, less boba, and less ice in mine, and the lady behind the cashier nodded and smiled the whole time. I thought that was a good sign, but when I got my drink, it was literally one-fourth filled with boba pearls and half-filled with crushed ice so that it was super cold. I really wasn't impressed, but I let it go and just drank (or tried to drink) the drink. The almond milk tasted like the artificial mixed kind you get from those pudding packets at Asian supermarkets. I've made my own almond milk at home many times, so that kind of artificial almond taste didn't sit well with me. It was okay because there are times when I go out for say, dim sum, and they serve almond pudding with a similar taste, so it wasn't horrendous, but it definitely wasn't real almond milk. The sweetness wasn't too bad, but going off of how my requests for less boba and less ice were ignored, I doubt it was less sugar. I maybe finished a third before tossing it.\n\nMy friend's avocado smoothie wasn't bad. It had perhaps a little less condensed milk in it than other places so it was a little less sweet, which is good, although that makes the color a little darker green and not as aesthetically pleasing (which is of course the less important factor). It also had a ton of boba pearls dispersed on the bottom, and when I tried it, I got a mouthful of pearls from just one sip. Their pearls aren't bad though; good texture and not too sweet, but the overabundance of them in both drinks got tiring really quickly.\n\nIn a time when milk tea shops are popping up everywhere, I'm just not too keen to return to a place that doesn't care about customer requests, especially when it's saving them ingredients.. I don't really understand why they would refuse something like that when it benefits both parties. Plus the prices aren't cheap either ($8.50 for a durian smoothie!), which makes me wonder if they're just well-established enough in the area to warrant them. There were only one or two customers on a Friday evening though, whereas T-pumps across the street had a line out the door; maybe I'll try there next time I'm in the area.", "author": "Maggie X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-17", "description": "When a Chinese chef gets a request of using a heavily reduced amount of salt, oil, and on top of that no MSG, he should be sweating like a mofo if he doesn't quite have the skills. Because now his stir fry needs to be put to the test (alongside his choice of ingredients). It's sink or swim now. For the masters, gods of stir fry, this is child's play.\n\nLikewise, when an Edoko (those who can proudly trace their lineage to Edo period in Tokyo, aka true OG $hiznit Tokyoites) sits at a sushi bar, and the first thing he orders is kohada (gizzard shad), it means he is not to be taken lightly. If the sushi chef is not careful, he will fall into a trap he can never get out of. Those who worship Jiro Dreams Of Sushi and Ono Jiro's impeccably high standards, will know he takes certain preparations very seriously. Kohada is a very difficult fish to prepare right, particularly the salt rub, vinegar marination. All in the timing and technique, in addition to years of experience to know how to control this through the seasons, since one cannot judge fat and moisture content by visual inspection of a fish at any given time of the year.\n\nNow those standards don't really apply to tapioca milk tea and it is really hard to judge for those who never have had the real stuff in Taiwan (particularly at the places that claimed to have invented the drink). But for me, if you can brew a good cup of tea or milk tea, you have earned my respect. Or take brewing tea, tea leaf selection, maybe some honey (time, temperature, technique)....if you can turn that into a delicious drink where there is a natural balance, you should be put on a pedestal where people would be willing to lay down on the tracks and die for you.\n\nUnfortunately in most cases of tapioca milk tea in all of NorCal, you take away the sweetness, and suddenly you can taste a bunch of weak spots.\n\nWonderful Foods.... not sure how I never came back before, but decided to drop by earlier to see what is the fuss all about. It's pretty obvious they know their way around the balls....tapioca/boba, that is. Texture wise, this is quite decent, but the buck stops here. Unfortunately a simple request of asking for the rest (aka the milk tea) less sweet, unmasked quite a lot of undesired qualities\n\nThe milk tea was basically uninteresting and very lacking. Not in a watered down kind of way, but obviously not brewed to order. It wasn't bitter, oversteeped, or acidic....but it had a slightly malty earthy texture that wasn't anywhere close to a good roasted barley or roasted oolong (e.g. Tea Era in Mountain View, which has suffered a decline as well). I have to say Fantasia Cupertino was more enjoyable (and I'm not a huge fan of Fantasia but respect the boba for the South Bay).\n\nDidn't even finish my cup. It was that bad, despite the ok balls. A boba drink is not complete without a good milk tea, and if you have to rely on sweetener to make it palettable, you have failed (but perhaps not with the hipsters).\n\nSunday night, circa 7 pm and empty storefront. No ABC hipsters lining up for 45 mins for a drink, as many reviews as this place got.\n\nTpumps 2 is coming soon up the street, which I am predicting will roll into town like Godzilla and destroy all the WATTE shops in its path like a Tsunami (if LATTE = milk with a shot of coffee, WATTE = water with a shot of tea). Wonderful Foods better be trembling and step up its game to fight the Godzilla (maybe send in Astroboy to make the drinks!), even if I prefer WF over Teaway and Quickly Bento (which is not saying much).", "author": "Ken K."}

I think I've been coming here since high school, back when they were at their old location.  Like a loyal puppy, I inevitably just followed them to wherever they went.  Thankfully, it was just diagonal from where they were.  Haha.\n\nPrices run a little higher than what you might find at like TeaWay or Quickly's across the street, but this is one of those times where you get what you pay for.  Their tapioca balls are definitely better in consistency and taste, and they have a pretty good variety of drinks and ingredients to choose from .  Admittedly though, I think their competitors might actually have more to offer, so they have Wonderful Foods there I think.  However, if you tend to stick with the usual suspects, then it doesn't really matter does it?\n\nOver the years, it seems that they've also added food items to their board, but I've never actually ordered any of them so I have no idea how they are.  Generally, I usually end up here after a meal somewhere on Irving, so there's hardly any room left for more snacks.  Maybe next time, although that might just lead me to buying more than just my usual drink.\n\nAs for service, the workers (tapioca baristas?) are all really nice, and they do a good job of getting drinks out in a hurry.  BTW, they also sell a bunch of candy and treats like how Sweet Factory did (man, do people still remember that place?).  In all my years though, I've never bought any of them, just like the food items.  Don't really have much to say in a negative way about the place to be honest.

Chocolate, ice cream, and cake is a whole different story.  If I cared, the plethora of candy choices at Wonderful Foods would lift me to instant euphoria.  Fortunately for the health of my teeth, my dentist, and my gut, I can walk pass the halls of candy in this shop and not get tempted.  My Bun on the other hand, I cannot comment for her.   \n  \nWhat I do have is a weakness for tapioca milk tea drinks.  The hard part is finding a place that makes a mean tapioca milk tea.  Certainly the amount of choices won't excite anyone.  Nor would one expect a good boba drink from a candy store, but the drinks are pretty darn good.  Usually everyone has their preferences; mine are almond, regular milk tea, and taro in that order.  Most if not all drinks come with boba (those tapioca balls).  Of the people I know, it boils down to you loving 'em or you hating 'em.  There's no middle ground.  If you don't know, try them here.  The boba is actually one of the better ones.  \n\nDon't know what flavor to choose still?  No worries, I suggest picking the regular tapioca milk tea and working from there.  Indecision with a tapioca drink is a normal thing.  I always wanted to try every choice at once.

It's no coincidence this store is still in business competing with multi-million dollar franchises. \n\nSo if you want the best boba drink in town while retaining a piece of San Francisco history through an amazing family oriented store, you know where to go. But if you're into that corporate watered down, chemically enhanced toilet water with a hint of child labor sweat, Quicklys is across the street.\n\nNow if they would only do something about those hoodrats always loitering outside the store...", "author": "Andrew A."}

Nope, as we got closer, the sign read, \"Wonderful Foods Co.\" Confused by the name (sounded like a grocery store), we pulled up and parked. \n\nAs we headed inside, I was like a kid in a candy store, literally! All of my favorite types of candies, such as gummy bears, sour patches, gummy worms, pretty much all the sweet fruity kind of sweets were available. I remember filling up the bags at Sweet Tooth as a child and getting a lecture after paying for it at the cashier, since it was quite expensive. Every since then each time we walked in, Bunny had to tell me to contain myself and would pratically need to pull me forward to the front counter to order our drinks.\n\nUpon our first visit, while looking at the menu, I noticed an extensive amount of drinks, with no extra charge for tapioca. At other places, my usually order was Strawberry Green Tea. However, I hadn't noticed that listed so I decided to order Passion Green Tea Tapioca. Ever since then I would order the same drink. Occasionally, I'd ask to have it without the tapioca. I know, it sounds kinds of weird. It's like getting a cheeseburger and asking to hold the cheese. Hahaha. Typically I do not get tapioca in my drinks and it's rare that you will see that. However with Wonderful Foods, I don't mind. It goes well with the green tea and makes the drink less sweet.\n\nOn on occasion, Bunny and I are here near closing time. One time we actually ordered chicken. When this happens at other milk tea places, we often hear, \"Sorry, the kitchen is closed.\" To our surprise, the cashier had started making it right away. She was very nice and didn't seem bitter about that as all.  Affter getting our order, we walked back to the car, which was right in front. Unlike other places, parking is easy to find and usually there are a few spots available right outside. \n\nThe only downside is that there are no stamped cards. Otherwise, good drinks, food and sweets. What more could you ask for?", "author": "Doris W."}

All the teas we've tried are very strong and deep, and not to be confused with the powdery flavors you might find down the street.  My favorite flavor is the oolong milk tea.  The regular black milk tea is even a little strong for me, so normally I dilute it down either by asking for extra milk or mixing it with a green tea.\n\nOn top of that, the boba here is always top notch, chewy -- not hard, not soggy -- no matter what time of day or night you come in.

Not exactly sure how to describe it... typically you have your HK style where it is milkier and than you have Quickly with what seems like powdered milk tea, and then you have some sort of Ten Ren variation and it has the stronger taste of tea. Don't get me wrong, I love HK Style and Ten Ren too but Wonderful's milk tea pops up because you can only get it here. \n\n4. Cups. Quite silly but they don't serve those flimsy cups with the sealable tops. It's more \"sanitary\", but I hate holding them and sometimes I feel like I can easily squirt it everywhere. To be real, how often do you buy a tapioca and save it for awhile before drinking it. That is the only other pro I see to those cups... when transferring a cup to someone else and you don't want to open it yet. \n\n3. The atmosphere. This place isn't a chain.. (well the owner does own Sweethut but it doesn't associate it's name with Wonderful). You kind of grow up with the store if you're a local and I think which is why it remains standing even though you have other chains around (three Tea Ways on Irving and one Quickly). There are many loyal customers and there is a reason why we are willing to spend the extra dollar here: it is consistenly good. I mean there are occasional times where a new person is being trained and it's not AS good but eventually they get the hang of it. \n\nI'm not sure what I'll do without this place but I think they make too much profits to be shut down anytime in my lifetime. :)", "author": "Jenny L."}

Nothings changed I think, other than the location which is only a few blocks up. They still carry their wide variety of candy, from chocolate gummi bears to jawbreakers (even the jumbo sized one) to packaged Japanese candy. They also have tea eggs, jerky, and dried cuttlefish and squid. It reminds me of an Asian Sweet Factory. \n\nAs for their drinks, they have delicious flavors. I usually get the honeydew or watermelon juice, most of the time without tapioca because it gets too filling. Their Thai iced tea is good and so is their regular milk tea with pudding. I recently tried their green apple with lychee jelly and that was SO good but probably tons of calories from the syrup. My brother let me try his green milk tea which is bomb too. \n\nParking is never really that difficult unless you chose to come during a Sat/Sun afternoon then you have to battle with everyone else that are grocery shopping or something. \n\nCredit card transactions over $15 only so remember to bring enough cash unless you want to buy $15 worth of drinks and snacks.

My Go-To: Lychee green tea, no tapioca -- it's a great drink for those who are lactose and calorie conscious. No extra charge for lychee, which serves as a healthier alternative to the tapioca. It's green tea with a extra tang of lychee sweetness. Perfect for a warm sunny day.\n\n2. Milk tea- simple, affordable and delicious. Its a perfect mixture of milk and tea. A great drink for those who are craving something not too sweet and safe.\n\n3. Cash only.\n\n4. Cleansy facility. \n\nI really appreciate the one table with seats that they added, it really nice to sit instead of freezing in the cold after you buy the drink.\n\n5.

This place will forever be my favorite tapioca joint.\n\nI've been coming here ever since 7th grade, and almost everyday or every weekend. Back then, I used to order 8 tapioca drinks each day for my family and I. And this was before they moved across the street. They used to be next to the Chinese video shop, which is now Verizon... (Wow, how things have changed...) With that said, the workers always recognize me when I walk in. They are all extremely nice. And recently, the owner of this place loves to start conversations with me while I wait for my drinks. \n\nAnyways, their #1 Milk Tea Tapioca always hits the spot, especially one nice warm days. I usually get it with small tapioca, and a little more sweetened. And sometimes, I even get a large, if I'm really wanting it. What else is good about the milk tea here? It's basically fresh. They mix all the ingredients right in front of you. You can see what they put in it, and how it's made. (Unlike Quicklys & Teaway, where it's pre-made...)\n\nI used to order their Honeydew tapioca too. It was pretty good, but recently it kind of tastes like bananas... Haha. It's the powdered Honeydew drink though. I've tried Green Apple, Peach, & #28 Lychee Tapioca throughout the years. All of them are pretty good. My mom always gets #28. Even my grandmother likes the blended red bean drink. \n\nAnd I'm sure there's more things to try, it's just that I'm always addicted to their milk tea, I can't stop drinking it every time I go there. \n\nAnd about a few months ago, they added a little small menu of snacks. I was kinda disappointed with that move. It seemed like they just added it to compete with Quicklys and Teaway, but I was wrong. I finally tried the popcorn chicken recently, and I think it's better than Teaway's and Quicklys. And I'm not even being biased... i think...

The drinks however are too sweet. I came here with my cousins and my brother in tow; my brother didn't even have the tapioca in his drink and he said the Thai Tea was too sweet. \n\nOne of my cousins had the Chocolate Tapioca, which...although it sounds enticing and a kind of \"best of both worlds\" dream, he said the drink tasted like Ovaltine mix. Yikes.\n\nMeanwhile, I had Sesame Tapioca and my other cousin had Honeydew. The Sesame seemed fresh and not made out of powder, but it all comes down to...the drink was just too sweet for me.\n\nService can be a little confusing here, but seems like the regulars have it down: just shout out your order once you make eye contact with one of the ladies behind the counter. The candy displays were fun to ogle at while we waited, and the drinks did come out fairly quickly (maybe faster than Quickly's, haha, bad pun). \n\nBut yes, I'll sadly have to say that Wonderful Foods Co basically ended my Quest for Boba I've had these past few years.

I don't think I've ever had an only OKAY drink here, it's all pretty above average and consistently good.

Upon inspecting their kitchen facilities, I noticed a single hot tea container and a very large bag of instant cream powder, which seemed to be the extent of their boba operation. All except their fruit drinks is made from powder, so if anybody is a fan of blended fruit bubble tea, this place may be better suited for you. Ordered the taro tapioca.

There's candy in the front of the store that you can buy by the pound and also 6-8 phone key chain vending machines. If you want to sit down, there's also a couple tables. The drink was fairly thick and resembled milkshake consistency more than your normal milk tea liquid-y drink, but I didn't really mind and it was definitely the perfect amount.

This was years back like mid 2000. Since then they have continued making quality boba drinks that other stores just cannot compare with. I'm glad to see this store is still around in my neighborhood and business is thriving because even with a down economy people can't get enough of tapioca. \n\nMe and my friends joke that they put something \"special\" inside these drinks to make it taste so good you want to keep coming back for more. I'm no drug addict nor have ever been one but i can imagine the yearning and craving for another  tapioca drink at Wonderful Foods comes close. Its really THAT GOOD!

I only go to Teaway when there is no line and all my friends want something from Teaway.  Milk Tea is the best here out of the 3 stores.

They also have fresh tapioca all day.  It's always soft and sweet.  Other places have this bland and tough tapioca that makes me either pour the drink into a separate cup, or just pull my straw up so I avoid all the tapioca.\n\nService:\nThe lady that works here is always super friendly.  She's always smiling and greets you when you walk in.  Whether you go when this place opens during the day, or late at night, they always greet you happily.\n\nThis store doesn't have seats, but is very spacious where you can hang around inside.

They blend red bean, ice, and condensed milk? It's freakin' bomb. It tastes like those red bean ice drinks you get at HK-style restaurants. Delicious.

It's quickly become my regular stop after working out around the corner.\n\nI've had drinks there 5 times or more now and every time the boba has been perfect.  The pearls are soft in texture, chewy with just the right amount of gummy firmness.  The boba is never runny, hardened, or overcooked.  They also do not charge extra for boba in any beverage. Score!\n\nThe drinks are very fresh and never too sweet.  If you want a sugary beverage in the style of Quickly's, you may be disappointed. The lychee juice drink is pieces of the fruit blended up with ice, (not powder!)- very light and refreshing.  The lychee, oolong, and plain milk teas are very lightly sweetened.  I especially dig their oolong milk tea.  The milk and light sweetness brings out the floral flavors of the tea and it's only $3!\n\nThe walls are lined with a cool selection of gummy and sour candies on the left and Chinese style dried fruits and treats on the right.   They get extra points from me for having sour cherry cola gummies.\n\nI wish they'd put in some tables and chairs to make the place more homey and a place to hang out, though it occurs to me that the wide open space all the way to the counter makes this shop very wheelchair accessible and friendly.", "author": "Aya S."}

You can distinguish other smoothie or tea drinks apart by the fatter straws that help you suck large black tapioca balls from your cup.\n\nWonderful Dessert does a fine job in cooking their balls well. Connoisseur boba drinkers desire them to be fresh, not clumpy nor slimy, in their mouths.\n\nIf you have never tried their warm Lychee Boba Milk Tea, you are missing out on one of the joys in life.  For $3.25, you will experience a sinful, sensuous treat.\n\nElite Yelper Monica R from Brooklyn, New York confessed, \"There is something about sucking large tapioca balls out of a straw that leaves me very unsettled. I think that drinking \"tea\" and then unexpectedly sucking up something edible would (have) the same level of weirdness.\"\n\nAfter reading my review, I hope she and other curious Yelpers will try this \"concoction\" at least once.\n\nMost consumers order their boba drinks cold, but I recommend it warm because the balls are softer to chew on.  Plus, the lychee fragments add a natural sweetness and rough texture to the bitter taste of the creamy milk tea.  As a variant, the avocado and the almond (no powder) bobas are yummy too.\n\nSome of you may still think tapioca drinks is just an Asian thing.  You are sadly mistaken-- it transcends ethnicity and gender.  \n\nKnow this:  The next time you walk down the street and catch a smiling PYT, holding a warm cup of Lychee Milk Tea Tapioca, there is a high probability that she is fixated on her own oral pleasure. \n\n                //\n======//====\n|            //          |\n| ~~~~~~~~~~|\n|         //             |\n| O   // O O  O  |\n| O // O O O O |\n| O OO O O O |\n-------------------", "author": "CT L."}

They mix your tea when you order it, unlike other tapioca places where they make a big bucket of it and just fill your cup with that.

I just decided to visit this place again after a long while and it's still the best milk tea I've had in the city, though I don't care for their other drinks since the flavored ones here usually contain powdered and artificial flavor. But here's one thing I researched about boba on line last night while trying to figure out how healthy these drinks were for you and was surprised by my discovery; did you know that one 16oz cup of milk tea with pearls can have as many anywhere between 400-1000 calories most of which coming from the boba itself as one little boba turd can have up to 14 calories in it? Yes, I know kind of hard to believe but it's true; just check out hungrygirl.com and type in Boba drinks. Or you can also view Lolly cup's website and see their nutritional facts page for the calories in each drink.\n\nSo, I was really surprised after all the Pilate's I've been doing every week, and was wondering why it seemed like I wasn't shedding a single pound even though I was eating pretty healthy, watching my carbs and drank zero soda or juice in nearly two months except for teas and of course bubble tea. But now I know where a lot of those extra calories came from, my beloved milk tea =( \n\nGuess I'll be cutting back on the pearls quite a bit, or getting it without. But anyway, thought this information might be of interest to others who have been wondering where all those extra calories they have been consuming were coming from. I honestly will say though, I can't see myself cutting those little rabbit \"turds\" (as one person previously referred to them as) out completely, but I'm definitely going to cut back on how often I enjoy them from now on. \n\nNOTE: We need to start requesting that these bubble tea places start offering healthier alternatives to the teas they mix with milk, because even if your having your milk tea plane, consider the fact that their either using whole milk or dairy creamer to make your drink which is adding quite a bit of fat into it. They should really offer skim milk and soy milk options as the many coffee chains and shops have been doing, because it's honestly not fair to have to chose between staying healthy or having to deny yourself your favorite food or drink because of it.", "author": "Petra S."}

I've had plenty of \"thin\" milk teas (and with mostly ice cubes). But Wonderful Foods has not disappointed me thus far (after a dozen or so times). The prices for their milk teas are reasonable, everything is fresh and they all have good flavor and consistency. The tapioca is not too soggy. I've tried the Thai tea, lychee, coconut, and almond, to name a few. I haven't tried their foods, but their bulk candies are usually fresh and they carry a good variety of western and eastern junk foods0.\n\nI don't think you're supposed to keep dogs in a place that serves food, but I always love the bichon frises that are there in the late evenings when I get my milk tea.\n\nAfter finding Wonderful Foods, I definitely can't go to a Quickly's any more.", "author": "Ellen S."}

So I've been to lots of milk tea places over the years, and I have to say this is one of the best, if not THE best milk tea I've ever had.\nI've haven't tried a wide variety of their drinks, since usually I just always order a black milk tea with something added in it--I've only had pearls, lychee bits, and almond jelly. The pearls are good, just pretty standard I guess..but not hard and tough to chew like a lot of other places. I like how the lychee milk tea actually has little lychee bits instead of just lychee syrup or that artificially flavored lychee jelly. Right now I LOVE the almond jelly! I love how they use real almond jelly, which has the consistency of pudding.\nI just really like the milk tea because they make it right in front of you instead of just scooping out pre-made milk tea that's been sitting around for a while, so it tastes very fresh. The milk tea is fragrant and you can actually taste the tea, unlike most milk tea places where it just tastes like pure sugar or cream. I've tried my friend's almond tapioca, which is just almond milk I think (no tea) with pearls, and that is delicious as well! It's pretty thick, not like the almond milk you can buy at stores.\nTeaWay is okay, but I'd prefer Wonderful Foods any day. True, it's more expensive, but I don't mind paying a little extra for delicious milk tea :).", "author": "Jacqueline K."}

The drink itself is rich and flavorful. Not watery at all!\n\nMany other tapioca places water down their milk teas but this place keeps it rich! I find the flavors very intense and well worth the $2+. Their regular milk teas have a hint of chocolate that people tend to enjoy. I always get the milk green tea and that has never disappointed me. Be aware that if you choose tapioca, some of the syrup will transfer to the drink, thereby sweetening it. \n\n3. Quick, friendly service. \n\nYou order and within a few minutes it's done!

I love this place! Whenever I come back to the city, I never fail to getting at least one drink from here. The drinks are made in front of you and I'm pretty sure most of their drinks are made from real ingredients, meaning no powder added with water drinks. The drinks are always consistent in flavor. They're also ridiculously fast at making the drinks. \nThe prices of the drinks range from $2.75 for milk teas and such to $4.75 (?) for smoothies. This seems kind of pricy compared to Quicklys and Teaway just down the street, but I guarantee that the quality of the drinks are much more worth it. I typically like to go for quality tapioca drinks rather than cheap ones like Quicklys (no offense to the Quicklys lovers)\nOkay, so maybe my review is kind of biased because this is a family owned business and the fact that I've grown up going to this place, but this will always remain my favorite tapioca place! Some of my favorite drinks on the menu are grass jelly tapioca, watermelon juice tapioca, passion fruit jelly tapioca, thai tea tapioca, etc. \n\nOverall, the quality , service and pricing of this place deserves 5 stars.

Sometimes I have it hot, sometimes cold (depends on the weather).  Today I had it served hot.  It seemed sweeter than I remembered, too sweet for me (though I've had sweeter elsewhere) without enough tea flavor.  They get the tapioca balls right though.  They taste very fresh with no goop on the outside of the ball. They're very chewy and softer than average.  Sometimes the balls are very sweet and theirs weren't.  So the balls were right up there with the best I've had.  Eggettes' pearls are very fresh too but sweeter and firmer.  I think I like the firmness of Eggettes' pearls and the lack of sweetness of the WF's pearls - so I'm torn.  I don't know which is better.  Tea wise, I prefer Eggettes but they also need to have a stronger tea flavor.  Like Frank B, I have not found the perfect PT yet.  I miss Ice House and the old Sweet House on Irving & 23rd (a spot taken over by Stars).  \n\nThe new spot looks nice, brighter and more open than their old shop on the other side of Irving St.  The candy and dried fruit bins used to take up most of that space.  Now the center part of the store is wide open (It would be a good spot for a few chairs.  Right now there is no seating.)  I spied an ice cream freezer on the right side but it was empty.\n\nWF also has the bins of candy (gummies, jelly beans, hi-chew), Pocky(!), and bins of Asian preserved treat (plums, ginger, orange peel), several kinds of jerky and snacks.  Candy and pearl tea, that's a great combination in my book.\n\nThe pearl tea menu is lengthy and features unusual flavors like durian.

Even as an undergrad at UCLA, I made it a point to visit this place whenever I was home. \n\nMy bf and I were a big fan of the Fried Squid Balls. Sure, it's loaded with MSG but we love it anyway. We always got it medium spicy and at first (as in a few years ago), it was okay. However, as we ordered it more and more, about once a week, it seemed to have gotten more spicy. It's the kind of spiciness that penetrates our tongues and stays there. When we soak our tongues with our own saliva, it just burns and burns until our tears come out. We soak our tongues with their milk tea to no avail. We swear that the lady in the back who makes the balls recognizes us! She's challenging us or something! We've already downgraded the level of spiciness to mild and it's still spicy! Maybe our tolerance for spiciness has gone down. I admit, while I love spicy food, I can't eat a jalapeno for fun. I can, however, eat a whole bag of Hot Cheetos without drinking water (I know all those spicy food lovers think Hot Cheetos are weak!)\n\nOkay, back to my review.\n\nI love this place.

I come here for the candy and nothing else so that's my review on that. It's basically kind of like a Sweet Factory besides the other stuff the sell here. I used to get my hi-chews here before they were available at 7-11's, Target, etc.. basically before it was Americanized.. when it still had japanese lettering and the package was silver rather than white now. I came here a few days ago after getting some Tutti Melon and was surprised that it was still open past 11pm. Since there's no Sweet Factory around San Francisco anymore, this place is an alternative to my sour patch watermelons, sour belts, and mini gummy bears. I love mini gummy bears 'cause they just taste better IMO... still searching where I can buy mini gummy bears.. and someone should me sour gummy bears, they're super yummy when they're coated from the sugar/salt from the sour belts and watermelons.

Now with other competitors, you'd think that they would shape up on service.\n\nCame here on a Saturday during the day with a friend.  When we got into the line with 2 people ahead of us, the clock read 3:15pm.  The first person in line got her 2 drinks farely quickly.  The girl right in front of us proceeded to the head of the line and started ordering.  She ordered in mandarin, 2 total drinks.  One was a taro drink with jelly and no boba.  The other was a passionfruit drink with boba and no jelly.  There was one older lady taking the orders and a really young girl making the drinks.  The lady taking the orders repeated the girl's order SIX times before putting in the order.  Finally, she shouts out the order to the girl making the drinks.  The clock read 3:22.  It took the lady 7 whole minutes to get the simple order down and to repeat it to the person making the drinks.  The girl making the drinks took about 5 minutes making them because she kept screwing up on which drink and jelly/boba.  The whole time we were watching, I asked my friend...\"How many Wonderful Foods workers does it take to get an order of 2 drinks right??\"  We couldn't help but crack up.\n\nFINALLY...we get to order.  We ordered two hot green tea milk teas with red bean.  By the time we walked out of the place with our 2 drinks, it was 3:40.  It took them almost 1/2 an hour to make 2 drinks before us and 2 of our drinks.  The next time I'm craving milk tea, I think I'll just drive farther.", "author": "Selene K."}

Sure you have somewhat decent Chinese food and such, but generally, such things are few and far between, if not crowded to the brim with college students looking for cheap eats. \n\nSo whenever I came home for the weekends, I began to crave boba. Why? I have no idea - I just wanted to suck and chew on balls (double entendre fully intended)  and I was in the Sunset so damn it, I was going to get boba! \n\nNow, I'm not new to the idea of boba. I've had quite a bit in my 18 years and I knew what to look for. Quickly was way too tired and \"meh\" after a few years and Teaway wasn't open at  the time. So i took a chance on this little shop that looked \"clean.\" \n\nI looked at their prices and seeing as they were quite reasonable, I ordered the Watermelon boba. Wow. That was good. It wasn't sweet, so I need to ding them here, but given the weather (October?) you can't really blame them. \n\nSeveral months later, I tried Quickly.  Quickly tried to charge me an arm and a leg for the same drink, plus the cashier had seemed to be a bit confused. Hmm...not good. \n\nBut I kept coming back to this place - even as I switched to Thai tea - their drinks were consistently good and they knew what the hell they were doing. Unlike TeaWay, who was cheap, these guys charged a bit more but at least they gave me the product, unlike the cashier who just asked me to choose another drink when she had trouble with Thai tea.  \n\nSo all in all, I'd give them a 4.5.

We had been going to Wonderful Foods for a while, and I kept thinking I wanted to try a durian boba. My boss had told me that the fruits are so vile that you aren't allowed to bring them on the plane, and hotels ban them. My wife sez that anything that is covered with spikes like that is nature's way of saying \"keep away\". But my curiousity got the best of me. I always said I would try anything that people said was food, no matter how challenging. The cute bobarrista didn't give me any warning--- if the gwai lo wants it, let him him have it. They pulled out a bucket of beautifull yellow chunks from the cooler. It looks appetizing. They went in back and blended it and presented me with a frothy yellow boba drink. They all watched with bated breath as I tasted it. To my credit, I didn't flinch. My wife, watching, asked me how it was. \"Here, try it.\" She took one sip and cried out in disgust. When we would tell the tale later Alison would say how I didn't react when I first tasted it. Darned if I wasn't going to have her taste it. The Wonderful Foods people didn't crack a smile and we left. Who knows if they didn't crack up after we left. Walking down the street to the car I kept drinking the durian boba trying to decide if it was really the most disgusting thing I have ever had. It tasted like moldy socks soaked in kerosene and was starting to make me feel weird. We got to the car and the smell just filled up that small space. The first time we had gone to Wonderful Foods I had nearly choked on a boba, but this was worse. We drove a block, and finally couldn't take it. I finished it--- don't ask me how--- and I threw the cup away outside the car. Couldn't leave even the dregs of the disgusting stuff in the car. The rest of the night I felt weird. I said to my wife \"I've never regretted eating something more in my whole life\"--- not even the time I swallowed a dime and it got stuck. (What a nitemare that was.)\n\nWe went back to Wonderful Foods, and I stuck to the #1 milk tea. We bought the evil Chinese candy--- I particularly like the salted ginger soaked in battery acid. And I told the tale of the durian boba many times. After a year or so, I decided to have another one, just to see if it really was as disgusting as I remember. It was.

I've been coming to Wonderful Foods since the third grade, but the one near my home closed so I've been driving 30 miles to this one for the exceptional, uncomparable green milk tea tapioca. The owners have known me since elementry school and always give me extra tapioca or a discount. They are one of the few tapioca stores left that use real milk tea and not powder. Trust me, I've worked at a tapioca chain, and the stuff we used was gross. I know the drinks here are always fresh. Everytime my parents grocery shop on noriega, I don't mind tagging along because I know I'll be coming here. It makes my day. Nothing else like it!", "author": "J J."}
