It almost looks like a fancy cafe with modern decor and plenty of seating. The boba tea I thought was a bit small and expensive - a small was $4 and the volume of actual tea wasn't very much once you accounted for the ice. We got the small original milk tea with boba ($4.50) and 75% sweetness. It was pretty good but not very different from other boba places I've been to.\n\nI think what sets this place apart is it seems more like a coffee shop than other boba places.

There's an actual seating area (and good amount of it). Same kind of milk tea drinks, but with the Boba Guys spin including horchata and some fruity concoctions. I always stick to the matcha latte with boba. Like Asha, they whisk the matcha fresh for each drink, so it may be a longer wait, but it's totally worth it. The boba is sweeter than other place's, so mix it up well after the IG shot and adjust the tea's sugar content accordingly, but the consistency is always perfectly chewy.\n\nVery nice location and the store front is quite nice.

I was extremely curious what oat milk tasted like and upon asking, the cashier asked if i wanted a sample, so I tried it. It's not for me, but you should find out if it is for you.\n\nBoba guys is a hipster boba place. They have organic milk, almond/soy milk, and oat milk options. Their toppings (aside from boba) are all homemade. For the options they offer, (organic and homemade) I'm incredibly surprised that their price point isn't much higher than you expect at most boba joints, it's just about the same.\n\nThey have some cute buttons and pins by the register if you're feeling like swag.\n\nWe got the Rose Black Tea with soy milk and aloe jelly with 50% sweetness and less ice and a Classic Milk Tea with organic milk and boba at 50% sweetness and a Kaya toast.\nThe rose taste wasn't very powerful, which could be a plus for some, but could have been stronger for me. The sweetness was just on point and the aloe was very good. It tasted very fresh and chewy and natural? LOL It didn't have a overly sweet aftertaste or syrup sticking to it because it's homemade which is nice. I normally have to adjust sweetness down to 25 or 30% at most places if I get toppings because they're drowning in and secreting syrup. (Yes, I meant for you to get that mental image.)\nThe classic ended up tasting similar to a hong kong milk tea which i felt bad for because my boyfriend does NOT like hong kong milk tea; Yet, he drank it up anyway and had no complaints.\n\nIt's probably also good to mention that the soy milk and organic milk tasted virutally the same. They must not be flavored because it didn't change the taste of the drinks very much. For those dairy free or lactose intolerant folks (especially those that were in the boat with me before Starbucks carried soy milk without that heavy vanilla/gross/oaty flavor) this is a great place to get the dairy free boba without having to go powdered or give up great tasting boba!\n\nThe Kaya toast was delicious! It looks like plain white toast with condensed milk on it, but it has a great taste. It's challah bread with kaya jam... I have no idea what that is but my mouth is open! It's not incredibly sweet, but definitely more of a dessert. The mental feeling i had of it being condensed milk make me concerned it would be god awfully sweet before my first bite but it wasn't.\n\nMy boyfriend is a business guy and could not stop talking about how their business model and quality was incredible and makes a huge difference.\nI agreed; Despite the fact that it wasn't the BEST boba drink ever, we knew we'd return to try other drinks simply because of the quality.

Every time I come to SF there is always a long line but thankfully this time it wasn't so bad. Don't be fooled if the line reaches outside because the register is actually stationed by the door so there's not a lot of space for you to line up. However, once you get in there is ample space for you to sit with your friends and family. \n\nThe decor of this place is very minimalistic and modern; mainly white and black. There is also seating outside if you want to enjoy the nice weather! By recommendation I chose the coconut green tea. It definitely had the taste of coconut in it but I could only taste a hint of green tea. Although I like my milk tea to be sweet, I would prefer if it had a stronger green tea flavor to it. It reminds me of a coconut vietnamese dessert, ch\u00e8. So if you like that dessert then you'll love this drink. As for my friends, they got jasmine milk tea and strawberry matcha latte. The jasmine milk tea had a strong floral taste to it but it was quite pleasant. It wasn't the kind that makes you want to gag. As for the strawberry matcha latte, it wasn't what we thought it'd be. No taste of matcha, just pure strawberry. But not only that, it tasted like strawberry syrup so we weren't a big fan.\n\nOverall, the drinks have a quality taste to them.

In my side by side picture, you can see just how inconsistent each drink was. \n\nBeing that this was my first time getting Boba Guys, I thought, \"this is just how its made.\" Apparently, not. My order tasted just like plain milk with a hint of strawberry. Whereas the drinks my friends received tasted much stronger in matcha or strawberry. \n\nI stirred my drink and so the ratios wasn't as apparent. However, I went back to the woman and asked for her to remake my drink because it was too milky. Her reply in a rude tone, \"it's supposed to be milky its 90% milk.\" \n\nI said, \"yeah, but this drink tastes like only milk.\"\n\nHer and I had an awkward starting contest for about 20 seconds. I, expecting her to take back my drink; she, probably expecting me to be satisfied with her response, and each of us just awkwardly staring at each other. \n\nI said, \"you know what, NEVERMIND\" and walked away. Until a guy asked what was the matter and that he would remake it. I assume he was the manager, but I'm not sure. \n\nHe remade my drink with the right proportion, and the drink was good.

Probably much better warm so it's softer in the middle.\n\nDrinks cost more here than in San Carlos and the Fillmore location in Japantown.

I got a Hong Kong Style and my friend (who has been several times) got a Jasmine Milk Tea. In literally the most Bay Area move possible, their milk options are organic regular milk (what we got), organic soy milk, and almond milk. I have no doubt that this jacked the price up an appreciable amount. Boba is an additional 50 cents, but the tax is already factored into their pricing. I did medium sweetness (50%) and am typically someone who doesn't like super sweet things.\n\nMy qualms are as follows. They put an inordinate amount of ice in. It was at least 25% the height of the beverage, which is a great money-saving move for a business and an absolute rip-off for a customer. I would guess they do this because they put the boba in hot, which is good to know that it's fresh, but this (a) makes the drink really warm at the bottom, (b) necessitates all of this ice just to keep it around 40 degrees at best, and (c) waters it down during the summer if you don't shotgun it.

Growing up in Taiwan I know what good old tradition boba tea should taste like, but I gotta say, I love the creative twist of some of the flavors at Boba Guys, as well we the option to sub with oat milk! My go to flavor currently is Strawberry Matcha Latte with boba, I go full sugar and 25% ice, I've got crazy sweet tooth so for most ppl you might want to scale down on the sugar level lol.

Most drinks look like an Instagram dream. However, my friend and I lean toward more traditional milk teas so he tried the Hong Kong style and I the classic.\n\nA few notes: they use condensed milk for their Hong Kong drink so you can't customize the type of milk used. It is also a bit on the sweet side. For the classic, I ordered it with less ice, half sugar, boba, and almond milk. I personally thought my drink was a bit watery (even with less ice) but it may be due to the almond milk, I don't know. \n\nOverall not that amazing of an experience for us. The food looked good though so I may consider coming back for that. The lines can also take a while, so be prepared for that too. Once I put in my order the drinks came pretty quickly though.

My go-to drink is the Hong Kong Style Milk Tea, which has been very consistent and has the right balance of sweetness and tea. It is a bit on the sweet side because they use condensed milk, so be sure to ask for 75% sweetness if you prefer something less sweet. A regular size with boba came out to be $4.50, and the boba was cooked perfectly being both chewy and sweet! I would also recommend their Muscot Oolong Milk Tea and Horchata Milk Tea. \n\n*LOCATION*\nThough there is parking right next to the store, it is not that easy to get. Every time that I've gone to this location, I've always had to drive in a circle a few times before a spot opened up close to the store, which is on the corner of a busy street. I would recommend looking for parking in the small streets that connect Octavia and Gough St. Besides parking, the interior of the store is very nice with white walls and fancy chairs to add to that hipster environment.

Drink-wise, the milk tea was smooth & consistent, the boba was great in consistency, and the taste was great due to uniform consistency and so forth.

Califia Almond Milk is actually one of my most favorite almond milk brands because it tastes more like almonds and it is carrageenan free, meaning they do not use a thickener for the milk that causes digestive problems. I also knew this place sells high quality boba when I saw that they actually whisk the matcha green tea powder. The matcha powder, I can taste, is purer than the matcha powder at Starbucks because the matcha powder at Starbucks actually includes a lot of sugar and is of a lower quality. Here, the matcha powder doesn't have any added sugar. \n\nThe boba came warm and was very sweet. I do suggest you request the sugar level to be lower than 100% because the boba itself is really sweet so it compensates for the lack of additional sugar. \n\nOverall, I would come back to this place if I can and I would like to try the other drinks on the menu. But since it is a bit on the pricier side, I wouldn't go here every single day.", "author": "Iris C."}

Been to the other one near Chinatown and that one was smaller and no fuss. This location is a lot bigger than it looks on the outside. We walked in for a after dinner drink. I got the strawberry matcha latte with tapioca. Suck a pretty drink - they layer it with the matcha, a cream and the strawberry puree . But you need to mix it up to drink it. The matcha flavor is the overwhelming flavor but you could taste the strawberry too. Still very tasty and the boba was nicely cooked. Pricey drink though - $5 and and extra 50 cents for the boba. I didn't see the seasonal drinks on the side wall - I would've considered those too. The main menu has their usual drinks. And we sat for a little bit enjoying the drink.  Every table was taken. We found a bit of counter space but it was pretty busy for a Saturday night. Will be back to try their other options.", "author": "Alison W."}

We were in the area Saturday night and found parking across the street so I was out to satisfy my boba craving.  We literally got there right before a line starting forming after me.  I asked the cashier about caffine levels for a few teas, and though she answered me she seemed really annoyed.  I'm used to the more friendly faces at Stockton though.  I decided on my kind of usual Strawberry Jasmine Tea Fresca and he went with the Horchata.  \n\nAfter about 2 minutes our order was ready and the guy who gave us our drinks seemed friendlier and had a smile on his face.  I've never been to the Mission location, but here, there's the same great taste, same right on chewy yet firm enough consistency of the boba and same quality ingredients as the Stockton Street location.  This location has a bigger menu, a few more food items, and actual (plentiful) seating with wonderful lighting for all of your Instagram shots.  \n\nWhile I'm the boba enthusiast, this was his first time trying Boba Guys, and he enjoyed his horchata.  He may not see the fuss in it, but I really appreciate Boba Guy's premium loose leaf teas, great flavors, and quality and natural ingredients.  They don't use syrups here and that's why it's not as sweet as those other boba spots.  Who wants a heavy serving of high fructose corn syrup anyways?  If I'm in the area again and parking is in our favor, I will definitely stop by again.  But, again, at least the Union Square location is by my office!  Cheers Boba Guys!", "author": "Cat C."}

Because it does. Interior design, branding, and presentation are all on point and if those were the only criteria for good boba/tea then this would be my favorite spot hands down. Sadly, boba/tea is not something that you just look at it, you put that shit in your mouth too.\n\nI really REALLY wanted to like this place but sadly they just do not have good boba or tea. On top of that, it is way too expensive. 4 dollars for a regular cup of boba is outrageous. Let's not talk about to price, let's talk about how shitty their tea is. I ordered an original Milk Tea and my girlfriend had some coconut flavored milk tea. Both were insanely watered down and had an odd taste to it. They were both too sweet and didn't taste like traditional milk tea. It just tasted depressing. As a matter of fact, the coconut flavored one was so nasty that we re-ordered a jasmine milk tea which was also watered down. Mind you, they don't give samples so we basically threw away 4.50$ because it tasted like ass. \n\nJulianna was the young lady who helped us out at the register. She was kind, extremely knowledgeable, and very patient. She answered all our questions in depth and gave us amazing service. This review would have negative stars if it weren't for her.\n\nI'm sorry. I know you had your hopes up on this place. It looks cool and you probably thought it was going to be great. It is not.

I had a pretty meh experience my first time trying their drinks. Their regular milk tea drinks are nothing special, and I would not order any here BUT I will come for their specialty drinks and desserts ;) \n\nFOOD:\nSo each BG location has their own specialty drinks and desserts/food items. This Boba Guy happens to have the Waffle Sundae (off menu), matcha affogato and a few special drinks. They also offer pastries from Third Culture Bakery (matcha goods!!!) including their custard cakes and scones. I ordered: \n+ Waffle Sundae w/ Black Vanilla Kustard $6.25: This is pretty much 3 scoops of black (charcoal?) vanilla kustard with their belgium waffles and I asked for shot of matcha (+$1.25). YES. This was heaven!! I just wished there were more matcha! (I'm a matcha addict) The ice cream was black but tasted like vanilla and had a grainy dense texture which I personally enjoy more than regular ice cream. The waffles were dense and did not get soggy and retained their texture! This is a lot for one person, so I recommend sharing with another person unlike me. I scarfed down the whole cup. Solo. Right after lunch. LOL. #lifeofafatass \n+ Matcha Custard Cake $3.95: There is no actual custard in the middle, it's more like a dense sponge texture with rich matcha flavor. Although I would have preferred actual custard, the cake works! \n\nSERVICE: \nThe girl taking my order was very friendly and accommodating. Eventhough what I ordered was off menu, she talked to the rest of the staff and they agreed to my create my personalized order! :) And made my matcha dreams come true. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nSurprisingly, there was a short line when we got here and our order came out in a decent time. This shop is really brightly lit, most seats are along the wall. There are some table seating near the back behind the stairs (Which I wish was accessible, but looks like it's staff only). \n\nVerdict: I'll be back to possibly try their other specialty drinks and the matcha scone the have (made by a 3rd party bakery).", "author": "Samantha F."}

The drinks they brought (600) were gone within the first 30 minutes to an hour. Go team :-) \n\nBoba Guys is pricier than the average boba shop, but that's expected at a store who proclaims a battle cry of \"fight the powder.\" Fresh is expensive! (a lesson quickly and sadly learned by a college student who thoroughly enjoys eating a lot of fruit). I popped by the Hayes Valley location for the first time over winter break with my sister and was 1) excited to find seating (vs. the other location which is quaint and chairless) but 2) disappointed that the swirly/DNA stairs we briefly saw in the Yelp picture thumbnails did not lead up to more upstairs seating :-( (I think it was storage up there, not sure though, it was behind the counter). Also, \"popped by\" is probably not the best verb phrase to describe it, there was line out the door and around the corner, but the service was swift and efficient! \n\nPreviously, I've tried their Jasmine Milk Tea (this one's generally good no matter where you go) and their Horchata, which tastes like delicious Cinnamon Toast Crunch milk (I've never had \"authentic\" Horchata so I wouldn't be able to compare or say whether Boba Guys's matched up, but what I had here was good!). I really appreciate that the alternative milk options (soy and almond) come at no additional cost! And this time, I enjoyed the house-made almond jelly (in an iced chai + boba), which had a...  *strokes beard contemplatively as a I think of adjective to use*... majestically subtle yet soothing flavor B^). \n\nLast note, it'd be really nice to be able to adjust ice level choice, since the servings aren't that big, the ice takes up a lot of room and if you drink the liquid part too fast, the toppings can get trapped under the ice cubes!!!

Like so many other Yelpers mentioned about the taste - a perfect equilibrium of satisfaction, taste, & sweetness. What makes it so good is the simple fact that it's practically not granulated/processed ingredients. This past year I found out that my body reacts to processed things like sugar, protein, etc.; therefore, this boba stop hit the spot of perfection! I ordered the Matchata & Taro Smoothie (which is the ONLY option of smoothie, sadly). Not going to lie, I was skeptical about no artificial for the smoothie as I had one before & it tasted horrendous. Needless to say...I was wrong! The taro was exceptionally AMAZING! The boba was freshly warm & the almond jelly was just as good too. I will have to order another one before returning to SoCal. Now, the Matchata (w/strawberries) was good in the beginning; however, as you drink the sweetness of the strawberry upsets the balance of the green tea taste. I would suggest drinking it quicker or avoiding the strawberry because the blend doesn't quite go together.\n\nAll-in-all this place got 4/5 stars. The only issue I had for not giving it 5/5 is because the lack of choices for a smoothie; but probably this is because it's NorCal & maybe smoothies aren't so smart for a year round relatively chilly weather - correct me if I'm wrong about this.

What is up with that?\n\nIn the East Bay boba joints are like a dime a dozen and I specially don't go anywhere else by I-tea but since this seems to be close to the workplace it leaves me with the only option and here is my results.\n\n-I really like the building. From the outside it's nice because of the clear windows that helps you see right in and the d\u00e9cor. However, once you step in, it feels like you walked in a dang sauna! Seriously! The first time I walked in I had to run back out because I was sweating my hair out! That is not cool *frustrated emoji*\n\n-I have to admit that every time I come in here I do get fantastic customer service. I remember there was a time where I ordered a Milk Tea drink and didn't identify what drink size I wanted and of course I was assuming that they were going to give me the regular size boba drink but when I picked up my drink it looked more like a teaser then a pleaser and I had to return it right back and ask for a bigger size and Andrew, the cashier was nice enough to swap my drink size out free of charge! Thank you Andrew!\n\n-This boba joint is quite unique from the rest and here is why. They offer and serve many items on their board they wouldn't be offered at other boba locations such as:\n\n* 3 teas and chocolate pairing for $10! Yes, Yelpers! This place serves tea flights!

What's another unique thing about this place is that they offer drinks Iced or Hot! Noice! \n\nOkay, so that's not all but I'll let you check this place out for yourself to see what else they serve that's different from the rest of boba businesses.\n\nInside they do offer a large variety of stool tables to sit and enjoy your food and boba with friends (In my option it's too hot to relax in there).\n\nVerdict?\nI personally love the idea of Boba Guys but when it comes to the quality of the drinks...I can't do it! I know I know...let's not all throw things at me at once. But true story, I didn't enjoy the drinks and after the 2nd time this would not be my first or second option. The balls weren't tasty and sweet enough, the drink was not as sweet as I would have liked it...It was just not tasty...*Sad face emoji*\n\nI would go with 2 stars-\"Meh, I've had better\". Which is true! I honestly have had better but with the customer service being great, I have to give it an additional star which raises it to 3 stars. *smiles*\n\nI'm sad to know there is a boba joint close to me that is not tasty enough for me. Hopefully another boba joint would open soon close to my job. In the meantime, I will stick with I-Tea!\n\nREVIEW 164/196", "author": "Porsche C."}

I didn't get boba today because I wasn't feeling it...aaand I also couldn't really stomach paying $4.50 for a small.\n\n0/1 Stars for Value --\nOK organic, locally-sourced ingredients, yadda yadda yadda. If you're the kind of person who can pay $7.99 for a gallon of creamy bougie milk, then $4.50 for a small milk tea with pearls and $5.50 for a large will be acceptable to you. As for me, *spontaneously combusts...in the distance sirens* Could I taste the difference in quality? Maybe? If I closed my eyes and reflected on Maisy the SF cow whose teat was gently squeezed to send fresh, frothy milk directly into my decal decorated Boba Guys cup. (Yo, but that cup is pretty damn instagrammable. Maybe the extra $1 in price is for the cup alone.) Yeah, I'd rather get my $3.75 i-Tea double topping milk tea any day.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nFriendly, fast service. I asked for my iced beverage without ice (I hate diluted beverages) and the server didn't even blink. She also let me change the sweetness level of my drink after she had already printed the order...I know, I know, I'm a terrible customer, but in my defense I didn't see that 75% was the recommended sweetness level until after I ordered. There was quite a line when I got there, but I was in and out in less than 15 minutes. This location is pretty spacious and well-lit with plenty of seating. The decor makes everything about this place any food blogger's wet dream.\n\nNo bonus star because while I understand the appeal of this place, it's not even in my top 5 places for good boba in the Bay Area. Ok maybe half a bonus star because maybe someone can talk me into trying one of their more interesting drinks (sesame latte, matcha latte, etc.) at a later date when I'm feeling a bit more spendy.\n\nTL;DR -- Good, but not $5.50 for a large pearl milk tea good.", "author": "Abby W."}

The interior looked pretty cool and the menu had interesting mixes that I have never seen before. We narrowed it down to muscat oolong and strawberry matcha latte. The muscat oolong was refreshing at 75% sugar. Any lower than that, it would be too bitter for my taste. This is rare to find nowadays since I usually get the lowest sugar setting and it still turns out too sweet in other boba shops. Anyway, the strawberry matcha latte was amazing!

I have tried a few of the milk teas, but my absolute favorite is earl grey milk tea with oat milk & almond jelly. The almond jelly is a bit of a healthier alternative to boba (they also have grass jelly if you want something completely dairy free). I also appreciate how you can customize the sweetness level of your drink. I usually get mine to about 50%- 100% sweetness is usually way too much so I would recommend going down (especially if you get oat milk, which is naturally sweet). Also, it can get quite crowded in here on weekends and evenings, so just keep that in mind. At the times that it isn't crowded, it's a great place to work with a couple of comfortable tables and lots of natural light. \n\nIf you're looking for something lighter, you can also sit down and order some more unique teas and tea tasting flights, which is fun as well. \n\nThe only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is quite pricey!

I've never had the chance to try the other ones in SF so it was also a good time to give this new one a chance. (I always have room for some good milk tea. If it's good that is.)\n\nThis Boba Guys location is located on Octavia Street in the Hayes Valley area of San Francisco. It's mainly street parking and you probably have to drive around for awhile to find any because it's a large intersection. \n\nWe walked down Octavia Street and I immediately noticed the shop on the corner. There was a line of about 5 people out the door which kinda scared me because I just didn't want to have to wait that long for my tea later. When I got to the door, that's when I realized that the place where you order the drinks is right in front of the front entrance. It's just badly designed. Wait til Winter when it's raining cats and dogs in the city and all the boba-hungry customers will need to line up in the rain. \n\nOk while the front is badly designed, the back area is definitely an improvement compared to the other much smaller locations. (As seen in other Yelper's pics.) There's a big sitting area further inside the store and the high ceiling adds to the modern clean lines of the space. Of course their large signature Armadillo is up on their white wall. \n\nI wasn't going to order their Hong Kong Milk Tea again so I chose their Lavender Black Milk Tea this time around and hoped for the best. It had a strong tea flavor, but I could also taste the Lavender. I would say it's not for people who aren't into sweet drinks, but when the ice melted, it did lessen the sweetness. They do have other interesting drinks on their menu (Strawberry Rice Milk! Whaaat??) so I'll have to try the others next time.", "author": "Julie W."}

At the time, no one was offering quality boba milk tea. They were the first pioneers to really elevate milk tea in the Bay Area by using top-notch ingredients like brewing real tea leaves, using Straus organic milk (no powders), and housemade syrups (fructose free). I'm happy that they're doing so well that they even opened a location in NYC. \n\nI visited their Hayes Valley flagship store (third SF location) during their soft opening (grand opening date TBD) and ordered a Large Decaf Milk Tea w/ boba ($5) and a Liege Waffle (pre-packaged - $3): http://bit.ly/1sr0T7a. Their menu is pretty much the same as their other Mission and Stockton Street location with 16 oz teas at $3.50 and 22 oz teas at $4.50. Toppings (boba, almond jelly, grass jelly) are 50 cents each. VERY reasonable prices given they use high quality ingredients. If you're a coffee drinker, they serve De La Paz Coffee. Cc's accepted.\n\nSide Note: They're currently offering a 15% off (?) discount for their soft opening (I was only given my total so I think it's 15% off). \n\nFor the lactose intolerant, they offer Califia Farms almond milk instead of the Straus organic milk. You can also choose your sweetness: 0%, 30%, 50%, 75%, 100%. \n\nFor snacks, they currently have Sunny Hill's Pineapple Cakes (Taiwan), Suite Foods Liege Waffles, Frozen Kuhsterd Boba Sundaes, and Sugar and Spun Cotton Candy. Can't wait until they start offering their housemade onigiri and artisan toast. \n\nMilk teas are a rare indulgence for me. I can only enjoy them occasionally on the weekends because I try to avoid caffeine (keeps me up at night). Boba Guys are the only ones to offer a Decaf Milk Tea and it's just as good as their Original. The Decaf Milk Tea (50% sweetness) had prominent tea flavor with a nice creaminess and a light sweetness. The boba was perfectly chewy with a good bounce...not as bouncy between the teeth as my fav balls from Chatime but still very solid. Most importantly, they kept their texture in the cold drink. \n\nService was very cheery and swift but I do miss seeing the personable owners behind the counter which gave it that special \"mom and pop store\" touch. But, when you're doing so well, I guess you can't be everywhere so that's understandable.\n\nSeating was mostly window counter tops with one larger table in the back area (for their tea lounge?). Not sure if there's free WiFi.\n\nParking in the area is tough since it's all residential parking.\n\nThank you, Boba Guys for satisfying my ball cravings...though my co-worker somehow was thinking of other balls.

I've tried everything from FTB to Au79 but don't mistakenly think of me as a snob, I don't look down on others for liking whatever they like.\n\nObjectively and in short, I think Boba Guys is a reliable place to get good tea. The boba is typically cooked pretty well, not too chewy, but not undercooked. The lines can definitely be long at times, and when it gets to the point  where it's an hour long, I'd say it's a toss-up based on how much you're craving a drink. Servings aren't too large (which may in itself be a good thing), and I'd say that I've never had a drink that I'd happily wait over an hour for. So depending on your preference, you may elect to go ahead do so, just also consider things like parking if you drive, and again the possibility of a long wait. \n\nAs for a recommendation, I do strongly prefer the strawberry matcha latte which I get predominantly whenever I go. It looks nice, for sure, but I like it more for how unique and tasty it is.\n\nOverall, it's a good place to go to for boba, lines get long often, and it's ultimately up to how much you're craving tea.", "author": "Charles M."}

Each specific type of tea (i.e. lavender black tea, rose tea) is brewed, not syrup added to a black/green tea base.

Of course, the pictures looked amazing and I had to get one of their most popular drinks-- the Strawberry Matcha with boba. I was really excited to try this, but it wasn't that great =( I'm a person who loves boba AND matcha and this tasted watered down. Because of that, I would not purchase that drink again. I haven't tried any of their other drinks and don't know if I'll be returning if I'm in town. The presentation of my drink was beautiful though and service was average.", "author": "Shaina H."}

As we walked up to the store, I was surprised to see a line out the door! The line moved fast though, and within 5-7 minutes we were at the front of the line and ready to order. \nI must say, coming from Hawaii where there is not much variety in these kinds of drinks, there were a lot of unique choices at Boba Guys. I was torn between several choices on the menu, especially since they clearly designated their caffeine-free choices on the large overhead menu. As someone who is extremely caffeine sensitive, I really appreciated this! Ended up getting a 16oz iced black sesame \"latte\" (I say \"latte\" only because there is actually no coffee/tea as it is caffeine free) with almond jelly add-on. For most of the regular drinks, you can choose whether you want it hot or iced, and what level of sweetness you want. For the specialty drinks such as the black sesame latte, the drinks are only iced and at a set sweetness level. \nNot being able to choose a sweetness level scared me a little bit, because I usually choose 50% or less sweet. However, the black sesame latte was definitely not sugary at all! It was a milky version of the black sesame soup that I'm used to having at lunar new year, which was delicious. It was very sesame, almost to the point where it was nutty, which I loved. I thought the almond jelly was a good topping to go with the black sesame latte, as it also was not very sweet but very light and almondy. If you do get the black sesame latte, remember to stir often as the sesame does settle to the bottom of the cup!\nLuckily our group of 3 was able to grab a table inside the back corner near the restroom. The place does get crowded though, so if you are a larger group I'd plan on just taking your drinks out and finding space in one of the nearby open areas in Hayes Valley. \n\nTL;DR - line moves fast, plan on taking out instead of drinking in, and do the black sesame latte with almond jelly!", "author": "Jasmine W."}

There are definitely a lot of boba places in the city. This one happens to be close to mine and you'll definitely taste the caffeine. The tapiocas are sometimes not cooked all the way through, so sometimes I do get lumps that are sticky to each other. \n\nMake sure though to check out the tea shop next to it (same family). The drinks can be a little pricey, and people seem to love the matcha. I personally like the Hong Kong style or the normal one. \n\nIf you get confused with the size, choose larger (you can't go wrong). The place itself is pretty for pictures, though it can get a little crowded, and when that happens you're gonna be squeezed with other people in line to wait for your drink. The sugar levels are fine but in this place I recommend 50%, less than that all you taste is caffeine.\n\nDon't forget to try the food as well coz they're as good as the drinks.

They've got nice tables and fancy bar stools and regular stools for you to sit at to enjoy or study or socialize on. I enjoy the various unique options of milk teas and fruit teas that Boba Guys offers. They have plenty of options of toppings and add ons to go along with your boba. My favorites are the boba (tapioca balls) and the grass jelly. They're also really considerate with drinkers who are lactose intolerant. They always ask if you would like to add milk to your drink and if you're okay with dairy. Also, they allow you to choose and adjust your sweetness level. 100% sweetness is the default option, so if you've got a sweet tooth, this is definitely for you!

They claim to use organic milk, house-brewed premium tea, housemade syrup, and make their own almond and grass jelly! I really appreciate their campaign to promote quality boba tea. \n\nThe staff are friendly as the cashier contently answered my questions about the various drinks this one time. \n\nThey have super unique drinks such as the Muscat Oolong and the Dirty Horchata! They're definitely some of the most unique I've seen so far and they all sound appetizing.\n\nThe Muscat Oolong was super good. It had a floral sweet aroma along with the classic Oolong tea taste. I got the standard sweetness but I recommend going 75% or 50% as my drink was a bit too sweet. \n\nThe Dirty Horchata was a bit too bitter for my taste. I don't really enjoy the taste of Horchata all that much anyway. I didn't enjoy it. \n\nThe Classic Milk Tea was very good and refreshing! It is quite basic but you can never go wrong with the classic.\n\nThe Strawberry Matcha Latte was really unique and tasty. The fruitiness of the strawberry and the grassiness of the matcha complemented each other well. You get the best of both worlds with this drink! \n\nThe Lavender Black Milk Tea was decent but not my favorite. It has a natural lavender taste but it just did not fit my taste buds. The lavender taste was too overpowering for my liking. I recommend it to all of y'all who like the natural, legit lavender flavor. \n\nThe Hong Kong Style Milk Tea is tasty. It has a nice bitterness and creaminess to it. It's a nice change compared to the classic black milk tea if you want a little change. \n\nOh don't get me started on the pearls; they are the most decadent balls ever. They literally have VOLUME to them. They're like the king of all pearls. They're sweetened but not too sweet. They are big, soft, chewy, and dense all at the same time! They really do feel like top quality pearls. \n\nThe price may be over the top for boba tea as they average about 5-6$, but the quality and taste are definitely worth it. \n\nFinal verdict: I wish I could come here more often but I don't go to SF that often. I should though, because I need to get me a cup of this heavenly goodness. I recommend this place to anyone looking for unique and delicious drinks and the best pearls!", "author": "Amy H."}

My favorite drink is the HK milk tea at 100% sweetness. I'll usually ask for less sugar at any other boba place, but the sweetness level here isn't too overwhelming. The milk tea is a bit frothy and their boba is super fresh and soft.\n\nI'm glad I don't live near a Boba Guys because I would treat myself every day and probably turn into a boba ball.", "author": "Alexis N."}

The artisanal slant of Boba Guys' offerings has been wonderful. The ingredients are startingly delightful. Although I still love tapioca pearls themselves, I actually love egg pudding more. The BG's homemade pudding is awesome: firm, creamy, fresh. \n\nLooks like menu options can vary based on location. I've enjoyed both the Strawberry Rice Milk and the Taro Smoothie. There is no artificial tasting flavor that you usually get at typical boba shops because of non-dairy creamer. The taro wasn't the typical lavender chalk! \n\nSince the drinks are a bit pricy, I only indulge myself occasionally with BG treats. The Hayes Valley location is such a beautiful space - great light and soothing finishes (tile, wood, stone).

Dang. Maybe I need to get used to SF price boba but for a little cup of drink at $5 that didn't taste that great wasn't worth it for me. \n\nWe came on a weekday around 7pm and it was near empty. So not that crowded at night from what I see. \n\nThey do change their menu frequently and my friend ordered the egg horchata with egg pudding. His drinking was $6! Yikes.

I couldn't find the drink on the menu anywhere so i described the exact way they described it on the menu at boba guys union sq. \" strawberry tea w/ a shot of milk in it\" the cashier didn't know what the hell i was talking about and kinda gave me a stank face :/ so I was like ok w/e I'll get another drink. \nAfter waiting for my drink I looked through boba guys union sq yelp and... oh I found the name of the drink! It was \"strawberry cream\". When my drink was done I asked the barista if they had strawberry cream drink there. And it turns out it's on the secret menu. Well, it all makes sense now! But I was just annoyed how the cashier was not helpful at all. She should know the menu even the ones on the secret menu.

Matcha pour over + black sesame is super bitter, but if youre a masochist and love boba guys, might as well try it. I think the only reputable item at boba guys is their strawberry matcha latte. Its always consistently aesthetic af, and it tastes great. Otherwise, I think you can get better boba som ewhere else. \nHowever, I can just bag on the establishment. The people are super kind, and made this secret menu item (matcha sesame latte) for me w/o any sass. If anything, I like the mission location better just b/c of Dolores park + birite ice cream. \nThe space is wide w/ decent seating.

This is the 3rd Boba Guys in SF -- it's located in Hayes Valley, and it's their first SF shop that has seats! I've always loved their drinks and food but have never been able to sit and enjoy my tea in a set place. \n\nSame usual Boba Guys goodness, but with a special twist. This Boba Guys has a Tea People section that is essentially a tea bar. They have tea flights and other special teas to try. I didn't get a chance to try during this week's soft opening, but am definitely looking forward to coming back when they're open full time. Place is very spacious, lots of bar seating and some table seating in the back. It's in a beautiful glass building just a few minutes away from Patricia's Green at the heart of Hayes Valley, so it's a super convenient, easily accessible location. Huge upgrade from their Mission and Union Square stores. \n\nI got the Hong Kong Milk Tea hot and the Hong Kong toast. Given that it's still their soft opening and I think they're still trying to work out kinks in the shop, it was pretty good. Service is a bit slow for hot drinks, but they made the toast much more quickly than their other stores. The HK milk tea was a little less sweet than I expected relative to their normal drink, but still delicious. HK toast is still one of my favorite Boba Guys signature desserts -- a thick slab of brioche with some of the most delicious creamy buttercream and honey you'll ever get. In general, this third store is definitely still serving the same high quality Boba Guys goodness.\n\nBoba Guys definitely has some of the most authentic tasting tea in the city, so I'm really excited about having this location so I can have tea in the store! We also had a sample of their oolong tea to introduce us to Tea People -- I love that they serve everything in a beaker, it's awesome.\n\nGreat experience so far -- looking forward to seeing what they come up with in the upcoming months!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

I do regular sweetness, light ice Cus I like to drink mine slow and don't want it watered down. You can ask for less sweetener, but in case it's not sweet enough, they have sweetener in a container next to the straws and you can add more yourself. \n\nI tried their non-caffeinated black milk tea but wasn't a fan. \n\nPros: high quality boba, unique menu, cute aesthetics, fast free wifi, clean bathroom, good music, young demographic lol, free water in a cute container where you can help yourself. There's usually available tables to study/do work, as well as a communal table. They also got cute little to-go premade regular and jasmine milk tea jugs, but there's no boba included. \n\nCons: parking- I usually get lucky parking right on Octavia in front of boba guys but half the time parking is restricted due to construction. However you're allowed to park closest to the stoplight even though there are \"motorcycle\" looking lines on the ground. I've asked plenty of times.

I've heard they were more of a natural homemade type place and finally got the chance to try them this past week. Wow I was impressed by the quality of the boba pearls as they were very tender and delicious. I made the mistake of getting the tea with absolutely no sugar (which I usually do at other places) and found the tea/and boba mix a bit odd. \n\nUsually at most places getting the tea with no sugar is okay as the toppings sit in a sweet syrup. Not here. The egg pudding was hardly sweet so I would recommend going no lower than 25% if you are not use to the stark contrast between black tea and sweet boba. My brother got the same as me but minus the egg pudding and with 50% sugar. That was a better choice as the milk tea and boba flowed together so well. I will definitely be revisiting. \n\nOh and they spelt my name right! Which is so incredibly rare. Great friendly service.", "author": "Priya D."}

In addition, they also offer made-to order foods such as onigiri and Asian brick kaya toast. They also have liege waffles, Frozen Kuhsterd sundaes, and a variety of other Asian snacks, which looks to be on a rotating basis. Unlike the Mission and Union Square locations, this Boba Guys has plenty of seating, so you can enjoy your boba and food slowly. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Boba Guys, their claim to fame is that they use quality syrup, quality milk, and non-GMO tapioca for the boba pearls, which means that the prices are higher, and your boba doesn't come out of a pre-made mix made dubiously behind the screen (I'm looking at you, Purple Kow). I'm not bashing those places either, given that I've grown up with some delicious unhealthy boba in SoCal, but if you're really conscientious about what you consume and you're curious about boba, Boba Guys might be your best bet. \n\nMy go-to is always the matcha strawberry latte but I want to try the strawberry fresca tea and the strawberry horchata.

I've gone to the Hayes Valley location before coming to the Fillmore spot and both times have been an absolutely great experience for my tastebuds. In terms of boba, I've had the jasmine milk tea, matcha latte, and coffee milk tea. Let me start by saying that Boba Guys does not skimp on the flavors AT ALL. When I order milk teas I always look for strong tea flavors and the jasmine milk tea really fulfilled that. The matcha latte wasn't overpowering and had the right amount of matcha in it as well as a decent amount of honey as a sweetener. In addition, there weren't any matcha clumps like I would get sometimes at other places. The coffee milk tea and matcha latte was a bit on the sweet side but, to be fair, those were ordered with the regular amount of sweetness. Nothing like a few adjustments to fix that the next time I go. \nFrom the Hayes Valley location I've had the spicy salmon onigiri which was absolutely flavorful (not too spicy) and had a nice rice to filling ratio. At the Fillmore spot I ordered the matcha soft serve which gives a nice matcha flavor that isn't overpowering and is really nice for a hot day. \nI would recommend Boba Guys for lots of my friends who haven't had boba yet.

I knew they had several locations but when I first looked at their menu a few years ago I wasn't impressed. Recently my friend, Danster, a fellow yelper was raving over their drinks and so I thought I should give them a chance. My gawd I'm so glad I did! I got here on a Sunday afternoon a little before 3pm. There was a short line out the door. Waited 10 mins to order my drink. I ordered the Lychee Rose with soy milk and Strawberry Matcha with soy milk. Waited another 10 mins for my drinks to be ready. My first reaction to the Strawberry Matcha was MMM so yummy! It tasted like sweet, ripe strawberry with a side of matcha flavor. The drink was also very pretty. You could see the tri colors in the cup. Then I tried my friend's drink and I noticed there was boba which we didn't ask for. I also tasted cinnamon...wait a minute... it's horchata with matcha! They gave me the wrong drink but it was still pretty delicious. When we left the line had tripled! I will be back.", "author": "Vinkin Ken T."}

The Thai Tea tasted good! Not too sweet not too bitter. The tapioca was fresh and chewy, not like some boba places where the tapioca might taste old and stale. It's no tpumps honey boba, but it's still some fine quality tapioca.\n\nI enjoyed this place, even though some may think it's a over glorified vegan hipster boba joint.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-27", "description": "I want to love boba guys but lately, I just can't. I know this is a review for the Octavia location but I've noticed in general that their other SF locations have been lacking recently as well. Too much to manage? The teas have been a bit over brewed and bitter recently, especially at Stockton and this location. I can tell because I rarely order drinks with sugar added unless it's a tea Fresca or specialty drink that's pre sweetened. I am a life long tea lover/drinker, and niece to a tea farmer so I know how unnecessarily bitter tea tastes. I've been frequenting boba guys since their first brick and mortar opened and I haven't felt like returning as regularly as I used to. There is also something off with the customer service at this store, many of the workers don't seem to know what ingredients are included in which beverages, so when I'm out with friends who have varying dietary needs, we can't really enjoy it much because the answers are always changing depending on who is working or completely inconclusive. Customer service has been shoddy a few times, not horrible, I understand the servers are probably stressed due to long lines. but it's hard feeling like you aren't as important as the friends who are visiting that they are chatting up or the Pokemon lures they are setting off. Lines are already pretty long so it can be slightly bothersome getting to the register and being put on hold for what appears to be frivolous conversation. \nI know my review has been mostly negative but I would like to end on a positive note. I do enjoy the expanding rice ball menu (but I would love to be able to know the flavors on a menu or something?) and I enjoy the aloe jelly very much and new toppings they have steadily added. I think the direction boba guys is going in with the fruit based drinks and smoothies/thicker drinks (taro, black sesame) are really delicious and exciting for when caffeine is not what you are craving. This location is in a beautiful space with a nice atmosphere for socializing or getting work done on fast wifi. The matcha based beverages and rose-lychee milk tea are real stand outs and worth coming in for. \nAll in all, I think that this is a big stepping stone for boba guys and I would like to see the quality keep up with the expansion. With some tweaks, this could be a true stand out. There is a lot to enjoy here, but I do feel as a loyal customer, there is some work left to be done.", "author": "Ashley G."}

I think almond jelly is the better option compared to the grass jelly. \n\nParking is pretty sketchy--simply because it's street parking. When we got out of the car, a few cars we passed by had their windows broken and glass was all over the side walk, which scared us, so we needed to make this trip fast. \n\nCan I say aesthetically pleasing? Because IT IS. Also, this place has a bathroom which is very much needed, especially in the city. The environment was clean and the cashier was very accommodating with our questions! I ordered the decaf coffee tea with almond jelly regular sweetened and it was great! No regrets. The vibe of the place is awesome, I just wish it was in a safer-ish area---but then again, it's SF, so things like that can happen.", "author": "K D."}

Since the store is bigger, they more food and beverage offerings, including grab-n-go. Seating is quite limited especially on their very busy weekends. Would not recommend coming here to get work done on weekends as it gets really loud and busy to the point where you can't even hear yourself think. There's a back patio with two tables as well--just be careful with the sliding door. It's a little sticky so you have to pull really hard. The drinks were fine, even more consistent than the shop in the Mission.", "author": "Alison M."}

We've never had a problem with their teas or pearls, always fresh, delicious and consistent. So please keep in mind that this review has nothing to do with their teas, we totally recommend all of their other locations. \nAround 7:30 yesterday we made our way over to their newest location from Hayes Valley, props to it being walking distance! When you walk in you're greeted with high ceilings, a sleek design and plenty of seating. But we were also greeted by some of the rudest customer service i've ever experienced. We appreciate that the staff must have a lot to do in a day, and that a lot of the times it's hard to manage what you're doing when customers are constantly coming in and you have to leave your station in order to help them. We try to be mindful and only walk up to the counter when we know what we want to order, but when we were greeted by a woman in a tan dress our entire interaction consisted of her rolling her eyes at us, huffing, finger tapping and rushing us. We felt super uncomfortable and unwelcome at that point but besides that our tea was great as usual, I just hope that they take their customer service into consideration in the future.", "author": "Sylvia T."}

I really enjoy their jasmine milk tea! The tea is fresh and flavorful, the boba is nice and chewy and the milk they use is high quality too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-03", "description": "Let me just start off this post by saying I have tried many many Boba shops in SF... and have never liked it.  When I saw Boba Guys opening up in the neighborhood my husband works (where I visit many days of the week) I was very skeptical.  I assumed I would try it once and move on with my life.  A few days after they opened I decided to give it a go.  I told the cashier that I had struggled to find a boba tea that I like.  She recommended I go with the classic milk tea. When I received my tea (only a few minutes later) I was extremely impressed.  For the first time ever I liked it! The boba was sweet and the drink was so delicious.  I highly recommend trying it.  Even my husband likes it (who only drinks water).  I pretty much come at least once a week now.  So good!  Boba Guys... you have changed my boba life!", "author": "Rachel B."}

They have a handful of no caffeine options, the black lavender tea is so good. They make it just the right about if milky and have vegan options if you don't do dairy. The coffee with black tea drink is really tasty. Like most boba places you can mess with levels of sweetness and they will happily remake your drink if it's not right.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-11-27", "description": "This is a bit of a sad occasion - you can see from my previous review that I'm normally a HUGE Boba Guys fan, and I come here quite a lot (like, on a nearly weekly basis). Unfortunately, that means I've come here often enough to have some really questionable experiences that make me think the staff is no longer dedicated to quality (even if their ingredients are still high quality).\n\nLet's go through the points, shall we:\n\n1) Discovering white, chewy mystery blobs in my Jasmine milk tea (I ordered grass jelly, which is a dark color so ???)\n2) The water pitcher in the downtown location was growing mold (I don't think they've ever refrigerated it, and it's definitely not an NSF-certified filter)\n3) The water dispenser at this location was once chock-full of mystery contaminants (a lot of black stuff floating in it) - they ended up dumping the whole container\n4) Getting sick from drinking their boba at a catered event\n5) 80% of the time, the boba pearls are maddeningly inconsistent - some pearls will be just right, some overcooked, and some undercooked (and hard!). This is rather baffling because this will all be in a single cup, so it's not like it was a bad batch or something. Are they just... not stirring it enough as it cooks? I'm really wondering. This makes it really hard to recommend their boba though unless it's freshly made (ie. at opening, or if you happen to get lucky later in the day).\n6) Every single \"premium\" milk tea I've ordered has been weak as hell - you're basically just drinking tinted milk for more money. Their standard offerings are the expected strength.\n7) Their jellies sometimes have really hard / chewy / undercooked bits in them, which makes for an unpleasant surprise.\n8) A lot of the baristas are *hella* sloppy -\u00a0splashing water, tea, milk, sugar, and dish soap / cleaner everywhere as they make drinks. The latter part is the main concern - I've seen some baristas splashing stuff into other peoples' drinks-in-waiting as they work on an order, which seems like a pretty bad health code violation? I dunno. Pretty much every other boba place I've ever been to is more careful than this Boba Guys.\n9) The sweetness levels vary wildly - a lot of times my 50% sweet drink will come out tasting like an 80%, and a 25% will come out tasting like a 5%. I've watched how they do sweetness levels (using a pump to get syrup into the cup), and I'm not surprised this happens - a lot of baristas seem to just wildly smack the pump and not measure the resulting syrup output -\u00a0real dedication to quality there, y'all.\n10) I've seen baristas leave milk out unrefrigerated for long stretches of time. Hmmm.\n\nAnd as a bonus non-food related thing, they never put out nonslip mats on the floor when it rains - they have a tile floor, so this means the whole place is a slip-n-slide on rainy days. I mean, I get that it hardly ever rains here, but this seems like a pretty basic thing.\n\nAll in all, this might seem like a series of minor nitpicks, and for most businesses that's probably all it'd be - but since Boba Guys pride themselves on \"serving the highest quality bubble tea in the world,\" it's incredibly disappointing to see what's become of them. I really hope they take this feedback to heart and make sure their staff actually *practices* quality instead of just preaching it.", "author": "M. Q."}

They let you mix boba and jelly without charging extra. When I ask for no ice because it makes the tea too cold they don't give you less tea (side eye Asha). Plus the youngsters who work here are always friendly and gracious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-26", "description": "First time ever at Boba Guys and I can finally say I get why there is/was a hype to this (3 stores in SF are already and I think they told me they were going to open another one?). Yes, it is a bit more on the pricier end for boba, but some of the flavors they have here are so unique so why not splurge a little for something different. With a recommendation from Mark the bobarista, I got the Muscat Oolong Milk Tea (w/ less sweetness I believe) which as he described it, had a bit of a taste of moscato. When I had my first sip, I was like OH NO...because I actually have a thing against grape flavored anything so I was like I did not think this one through haha. However, the more I drank it, the more I enjoyed it since the grape flavor was much more subtle overtime and it didn't taste artificial at all. I definitely want to get the Golden Honey Black Milk Tea next time- premium teas are just simply on another level in terms of flavor and depth. Plus this was the other flavor I had asked about, but obviously went for the Muscat Oolong instead. Definitely get less sweetness on the drinks as I was told that that 100%/ normal sweet is often too sweet for most people!", "author": "Daicy L."}
