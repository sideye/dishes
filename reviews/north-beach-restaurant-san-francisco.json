People either loved Lorenzo or thought he was an A-hole....I personally got along with him. He was the epitome of the American Dream starting as a dishwasher and working his way up to opening a beautiful restaurant.\n\nWhile the service and setting are still top notch the food is, in my opinion, pretty mediocre and over salted.\n\nWe started the experience off with the Antipasto Toscano for Two - Home-Cured Prosciutto, Salame, Cheese, Marinated Calamari, Veal Shank, Beans and Salsa Verde....and I must say I did not care for a single dish. Calamari was fishy and chewy. Veal tasted like a canned piece of meat...and grey...\n\nThe Carpaccio & Home-Cured Prosciutto combination was pretty forgettable. Meat was not flavorful and the cheese was meh.\n\nPasta dishes are worth ordering. We enjoyed the Tagliatelle Pescatora loaded with plenty of shell fish.\n\nMy Osso Bucco was really really salty. The meat was tender and flavorful however.\n\nThe two veal dishes our friends ordered looked pretty forgettable for the price charged.\n\nThe one place where North Beach shines is their Italian Wine selection. It is amazing  and you can find a great wine for $50-60 or $150\n\nIf you come here order a salad and a nice bowl of pasta and a great Tuscan wine...you'll leave happy.", "author": "David G."}

We ended up spending double the minimum per person.  \n\nWhen the bill arrived we decided due to the rude service and hostility we would not leave him the 20% to which he felt entitled to and left him a smaller tip.

I want to mention the parking is  a shady operation.  I had called to make sure they had parking, the guy said yes, $10 valet.  When we showed up, the valet guy told us $20 for SUV and made us pay up front. That seem odd but being out of towners we thought maybe it's the norm in SF. But when we were leaving, I noticed the valet didn't ask the others for the money up front so I went back into the restaurant to tell the host what had happened and also we had to pay double. He said that's an outside service but doesn't sound right and went out to talk to the guy. Whatever- onto the restaurant...\n\nThe hosts and waiters are all dressed up there so the entry was very pleasant/classy.  The place is bigger than it looks from the outside,we were seated in the back room. I'm not sure if our waiter was new or just didn't care but he just told us what the specials were, no description what so ever.  Again, thought that's just the norm until I heard the waiter 2 tables away describing the specials to his table, on and on for a few minutes! \nThe food was not what we expected from an authentic Italian restaurant- very average if that.  The antipasto salad we ordered was actually kinda gross, slimy, over vinegar'd calamari, some meats, beans and something else.  I highly recommend you don't order that. I had the linguine with clams which was pretty good.  My friend ordered eggplant Parmesan, it wasn't served with any pasta so he was disappointed.  And I can't remember what the the other 2 dinners were but they were fine.  Oh, what waiter at an Italian restaurant doesn't ask if you want any parm cheese- ours.  I had to ask for it- and again I was jealous of the other table who had a waiter serving the the parm cheese and refilling their water cups.  \nI can honestly say we'd pick Olive Garden for a fraction of the price over this place.", "author": "Mary M."}

Since moving here a year ago I have come here six times, mostly with my family and a couple of times at the bar.\n\nIf you like old school service and food this is your place. I have never had bad service - at the bar or a table. For me service is the \"entry fee\" at any restaurant, without which I can't enjoy the food. My experience last Tuesday was not an exception. Our waiter, Spiro, was attentive and on the spot. He came back multiple times and did not rush us to make our order \"all at once\". We ordered our starters and drinks and he could tell we were still deciding, so he suggested putting those orders in and that he would come back. \n\nHe suggested a few items but never pushed, and reminded me that I needed a refill on my drink when appropriate :). Just a pro. Nice. Attentive. Not in your face, but there when you wanted him to be. Raj, was the manager that night and he was nice as well. We felt \"at home\" and you could see so many parties - small and large - and they all seemed happy, just a great atmosphere all around. \n\nThe food. I was a cook at an old school Italian place in my youth, and it is not as easy to find that old-country food as you would think. Pizza yes. Semi-fast food Italian yes. High end Italian yes. But down-home Italian, with mama in back, is nice to find. North Beach is your place. OK, I had Veal Parm. You might say, \"Of course! What's not to like - cheese and sauce on top of meat!\" But really, it is easy to do it wrong. My wife hd the Veal Osso Buco and it was delicious as well. Fell off the bone. \n\nThe Tiramisu was to live for. Moist, sweet, not to sweet. Perfect.\n\nI recommend this place. Go. Enjoy. Relax.", "author": "David O."}

I was of course aware of this restaurant, just one block away from the SF Italian Athletic Club, where I am a member, but I had never been inside. I don't know why, just never had a chance I guess. A special friend steered me there last Tuesday night, and the place was quite busy for a Tuesday. Good start.\n\nAs we walked in, Pietro, the son of the now passed founder, greeted us immediately as he recognized her since she comes often. I immediately detected his accent as true, and switched to Italian. After a warm welcome, his words to Raj, the gentleman who seated us were a humorous: \"Raj, be very very careful with these two.\"  That was nice.\n\nThe true measure of an Italian restaurant is their pasta dishes, so both I and my charge ordered pasta. She had the Taglietelle Bolognese, I had the Spaghetti with Vodka. Both were absolutely delicious.\n\nThe bread was to die for, with of course the little dish of olive oil. We did not order appetizers.\n\nService was impeccable.\n\nThe only ding, and why not five stars, is that I ordered a bottle of Gattinara 2008 from the wine list, and the waiter showed up with the wine I asked for, but it was a 2010.

The Pasta was cooked Al Dente, like it should be.  The sauces are where this place is lacking.  My Bolognese, was watery and the meat was overcooked to the point of being powdery.  Way too dry.  The other dishes at the table were:\n\nCesar Salad:  Nice portion for $15 but way overdressed.  Too much oil made the lettuce very shiny and soggy.  The anchovy taste was there though and that made it palatable.\n\nSquid appetizer:  This was good for the italian style.  cooked just enough to not be raw and very tender with a nice vinegar base.  \n\nTagliatelle with Porcini:  It was just mediocre.  \n\nNone of these dishes had any type of presence and all looked unappetizing.  I think a dish should not only taste good bu also look amazing when plated.

We had:\n\n1. Antipasti: we had two, calamari- it was truly well made, loved it. Server kept going on about how great the 'cured prosciutto and melon' was and we tried that. It was indeed good. Based on the two items we got, they do an excellent job. \n\n2. Entree: \nSea scallops: okay it was the best I had in a very very long time. They know what they're doing!\nVeal chop: it was a bit salty to my taste, but tasted great. \n\n3. Dolci: \nWill I skip tiramisu? No way. And boy was it good. I've tried tiramisu pretty much every place that offers it. This place, they do a better job than most places I've been to. I'll put it at top 5%.\n\nI'd highly recommend this place. It's quite expensive compared to most places and it is worth it. \n\nThe reason I don't give perfect 5 is because the server was professional and knowledgable but completely ignored my questions and only talked with my friend, I felt as though I'm being ignored because I'm not a man.

This place is definitely old school, the kind of place where the waitstaff has been there for decades (my father worked as a professional waiter when I was a kid, so places like this are really special to me.)  \n\nWe started with cocktails - an old-fashioned for him, and a Lorenzini for me (their wonderful house red with sparkling wine - not too sweet, very refreshing) and the burrata appetizer.  Creamy and decadent.\n\nMy guy had the scallops, which are some of the best that I have ever tasted, and I had the osso bucco, also some of the best that I have ever tasted.  We were almost too full for dessert, but wanted to try to the Zabaglione, and nearly fell over because it was so good.\n\nIt's pricey, but you do get what you pay for here.  We'll be back.", "author": "Michelle P."}

The restaurant was not very crowded, and we had to wait a few minutes after we arrived for our table.  We were seated in a cozy nook looking out into the street.  I wish I remembered our waiter's name, because he was very nice and made us feel totally at ease.  He even escorted me across the restaurant when I asked him where the restroom was!  \n\nWe never had to wait long for our drinks or our appetizer.  We ordered the special for the appetizer, which consisted of a prosciutto and melon and a caprese with super fresh mozzarella.  We were warned that ordering one of the chicken dishes would take 20 minutes to get, which we were fine with.  It did not even seem that long of the wait and it was delicious!  The skin was seasoned perfectly, and crispy, while the inside was still juicy and flavorful.  Our other dish was a ravioli that was equally as delicious.\n\nI didn't look at the dessert menu, because I really wanted the affogato.  For an affogato to be delicious, you really need a good espresso and this dessert was delicious!  I think I only shared 1 bite before devouring the rest myself.  \n\nThe food was delicious, the staff was pleasant and I would definitely come here again.", "author": "Megan L."}

The service was brisk yet not what you would accept from a restaurant positioning itself as a high-end destination. The following pointers should help you make a more informed decision:\n\n1. I requested for a whiskey based cocktail. The waiter suggested an Old Fashion. When I asked him if he had a better suggestion, he offered the Manhattan. Not quite the high-end affair I would say.\n2. We all ordered their specials - some in chicken and some in pork. I have had better chicken at the local KFC than the Mattone that was served to us. I must have developed some muscles during my meal to cut it into smaller pieces. It was one, tough fighter, straight out of the lowest drawer in the cold storage. Others had similar experiences.\n3. With the meal wrapped up, the waiter took our order for the desserts and brought along a cheesecake with a lit candle for the birthday girl. Sweet, right? Not quite. Once she blew the candle, this cheesecake was passed over to me, as this was the dessert I had ordered! I don't know of a single restaurant in the world that doesn't give a complimentary dessert to the birthday person, irrespective of its proportions. Height of being cheap!\n4. When the bill arrived, the restaurant had automatically added gratuity to the gross amount. This is the acceptable practice in SF for groups over 6, but with food and service this bad, they could have checked with us first. \n\nIn summary, if the sole memory of a 'high-end' restaurant is their garlic bread (a must have), you're better advised to spend your money elsewhere.", "author": "Adi M."}

The waiter that \"helped\" us was a slimy French car salesman that tried to upsell everything and downright scam us. He mentioned a few specials, one of them being burrata and their \"homemade\" prosciutto. Because we just wanted the caprese salad and aren't die hard prosciutto lovers we asked him how much it was. He responded in a very condescending manner that he doesn't know maybe $15-16, maybe $18-20 dollars.  We decided we might as well. \nThe burrata was good but the prosciutto was some to the worst I've had.... moving on, no ones fault. \n\nWe also ordered the Cioppino (which is what I was dying for and originally came to eat at either Sotto mare or Cafe Sport but they were both closed on Labor Day). We ordered off the lunch menu at 2pm and the price of the cioppino was $21.50. The waited insisted to split it and brought it out to us in 2 cups I would expect my clam chowder cup to come in. \n\nBetween our 2 cups, we had 2 shrimp, 1 muscle (awful- I had to spit it out), 1 clam and some cod. The sauce was bland and not anything to come back for...... ever! It might have as well just been tomato paste out of a can.\n\nSo our bill comes and low and behold, in addition to our 4 wines we were charged separately $15.75 for our burrata and $16 for the prosciutto. I get up to go confront the waiter (especially since this is the exact dish we asked him about)  and then I noticed he charged $34 for cioppino.  I tell him to change the price and take off one of those apps. After a rather unpleasant interaction he comes back with lowered cioppino price and an increased prosciutto price to $17 and a lowered burrata price to $12.\n\nI will never go back... even the free bread they gave was dry and old .", "author": "Natalie V."}

I had gnocchi gorgonzola and my BF had veal scaloppine. A basket of several types of bread, all good, was brought out, it was hard to remind myself to save room. I'm glad I did. The gnocchi I had was so light it almost floated right off the plate. The sauce was perfect - but I love strong gorgonzola. My BF's veal was delicious and was well presented with mushrooms, broccolini and rice. Great wine too. Split the mousse for dessert and I'd fly back to SF for that alone. \n\nPrices were decent - more than we planned to spend for lunch but totally worth how delicious it all was. Service was prompt, attentive. My water glass was never less than half.

I moved on to overcooked lamb in a watery brown sauce that probably came from a can and was supposed to make up for the fact that the meat wasn't seasoned before cooking. This was, of course, served with the same bland zucchini and overcooked potato slices as every other dish. Sister got veal and prawns.

I had the sea scallops, my father had the cioppino, and my mother had the tagliatelle pescatora. Clearly my family is fond of seafood and we were all very impressed with the quality of the seafood, the tagliatelle was freshly made, and even my extremely difficult to please father enjoyed his dish. The portions were massive, I didn't eat for the rest of the day, and the white wine mushroom sauce was a bit rich for my taste but I enjoyed it nevertheless. The food was worth 4 stars but if I could have given it 4.5 stars I would've. The extra half star would've been for the service.

(Now the restaurant knows EXACTLY who I am if they want to contact me to deliver a REAL apology).\n\nThere was just a lot that was \"off\" and odd\" about our experience. For starters we were seated in the basement of the place in the farthest table in the back surrounded by bare white walls with no ambience. I was disappointed because I'd made reservations for my out of town guests and thought that our reserved status would grant us at least a table in a lively room with other diners.The timing of the service was really strange.  It took about 20 minutes to order drinks, then it took ANOTHER 20 minutes for the server to ask about taking our starters order.  Then (and only after we'd FINISHED eating the starters) he asked for our main course selections.  So after walking in the door it was almost an HOUR before we ordered mains. Here's where the dinner got surreal: My wife ordered the Chicken Toscana, a dish that specifically featured olives and artichokes. The server commented that the chicken was served on the bone, but if she wanted it prepared another way (he had an Italian term for it) he'd be happy to prepare it like that. She was delighted at his attentive suggestion and agreed to the \"new preparation\".\n\nAbout 30 minutes later our entrees started to arrive. Everyone's dish was on the \"cool\" side of warm including my veal parmigiana which was acceptable, but nothing exceptional. But HERE's the thing; my wife's chicken was served with NEITHER OLIVES nor ARTICHOKES on the plate! When she alerted the server to this he apologized and about 10 minutes later(!) brought her a side bowl of artichokes, carrots and zucchinis - AGAIN with NO OLIVES. Now it was getting WEIRD. So AGAIN- she asked specifically for OLIVES and he replied that the restaurant was \"all out of olives, we're so sorry\". ????!!!??!?!?!?!  Imagine our flabberghastery.\n\nWe told him that if he'd have stated that info up front she could have ordered a different dish from the get-go and there'd be no problems.  His reply, \"I'm so sorry\".  Then he turned and left. It started to feel like a \"Twilight Zone\" episode in there, and by now the rest of the table was visibly uncomfortable with all of this back and forth.  We all hurried to finish and just get OUT of there, when the final insult was hurled:  A MANDATORY 20% gratuity had been added to the check so we were FORCED to pay an extravagance for service that would NOT have garnered this amount in a normal situation.  \n\nI am not embellishing this tale in order to make a \"good story\".

I've been frequenting this place for over 10 years and it used to be my favorite Italian restaurant in the city. So it's with a heavy heart that I have to say the kitchen has lost its touch... leaving the experience badly overpriced. \n\nI took a date here recently and was completely underwhelmed. Her seafood dish was undercooked and mine (one of the most expensive cuts on the menu) was terribly over done. I ordered medium rare and got something on the border of well done. When told we like Pinots, our server recommended a bottle that somehow had absolutely no forward taste at all. It was a unique experience, but not what you expect from a bottle over $50. \n\nFor the money I spent we could have had a really nice meal at any steakhouse in the city.

They basically said they knew a place in north beach that was super OG. Just one of the best old Italian spots in North Beach. So I knew we were in for a treat before we got there. Homegirl and I were able to get there a bit before her parents and we sat at the bar while drinking a merlot and Pinot noir respectively. \n\nWe were instructed to follow the host down to the basement which was really cool. Very old school feel. Like this would've been a place where mobsters were escorted to with their buddies. It's dark and wine racks line the walls along with dozens of hanging dried hams. There was also a separate bar downstairs.\n\nNo server there was young or inexperienced. Ours was from another country (we later found out France) and we has very very knowledgable about the menu. Just dropping bombs of knowledge left and right and absolutely persuaded me into ordering the dish I chose.\n\nI ended up choosing the petrale mugnaia. A very simple plate with light flavors, which let the quality of the fish carry the meal. To be honest I thought my plate was good, but not above and beyond fantastic. The plating was excellent though, with the potatoes and everything looking very aesthetically pleasing. My homegirl and her moms got the cioppino which I tasted and was totally knocked back by. My plate was not even close to bad by any means, but I wish I had ordered that instead.\n\nOnly thing that was a blatant let down was the bread they doled out. I would never expect a place of this quality to be so sacrificial with the quality of their bread. It was cold, dry, and subpar. Everything was awesome otherwise.", "author": "Jim B."}

The cellar was dark and old-fashioned, but fit our large group perfectly, and didn't get terribly loud despite all the talking.\n \nThey gave several options, but for me there were only two - the sole and the veal.  The food enthusiast in me insists on getting something different from J so that I can try more dishes.  So he had the sole and I had the veal.  While the veal with mushrooms and pine nuts was quite delectable (thin, tender, great flavor, and great texture add of the pine nuts), the sole was AMAZING.  It was perfectly cooked to be flaky and tender with buttery flavor and texture.

(As I said in my review, how many meals do you remember for seven years, not to mention eleven years?)\n\nMy wife used their valet to park our car (it's $8 at lunch), which was very handy.  We were here on vacation, and I had been raving about this place to her for years.  She wanted to know what all of the fuss was about.\n\nAs we entered, we were welcomed by their clean-cut ambiance.  The ambiance of the restaurant is fresh, welcoming, and sophisticated.  The art on the walls is also notable.  (Also, the restrooms are immaculate.  If you need to make a pit stop, this is a great place to go.)\n\nWe didn't get an appetizer--instead, we took advantage of their bread and their olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Their bread, olive oil, and balsamic was amazing.  (Their olive oil is actually produced by the owner of the restaurant, who also has a winery in Napa.  We didn't have the wine, so I can't speak to that.)  \n\nFor lunch, we each had the Fettuccine Alfredo.  My wife considers herself a connoisseur of Fettuccine Alfredo, as she gets it everywhere.  (I generally don't, because the last time I was here, it was so good that it spoiled most every other Fettuccine Alfredo dishes I've ever had.  Now every time I order it elsewhere, I'm disappointed it's not as good as this one.)  Even with the hype and buildup, my wife loved it and agreed with my assessment.  Over a decade later, the Fettuccine Alfredo here is phenomenal.  The pasta and the sauce are homemade / made from scratch, and I've never had a better one.  (Nor do I expect to ever have a better one, at this rate...)\n\nIn conclusion:  This is STILL one of the best meals I've ever ate in my life, in what I think is the best overall city for foodies in the United States.  Just go--you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Joe K."}

They have that down. We ordered Burrata with the house Prosciutto and melon- that was good. Not fabulous but good. They say it's flown in fresh daily from Italy maybe that's how they justify their over the top prices.  I ordered chicken piccata- I'm sorry I can do way better at home. My son ordered spaghetti vodka sauce-  again it was okay I do way better at home.\n\nDessert was amazing though -  the torta di gelato was one of the most interesting desserts I've ever had - in lay language it's cake and ice cream. It was served frozen and as the dessert begins to melt all of the flavors mesh into this lovely flavor that happens right in your mouth!! We also ordered Cold Zabaglione which was nice. My son ordered cheesecake - it was ok and tasted like Costcos.\n\nSo let's talk about wine - we ordered a bottle of 2007 Sonoma Brunello from the owners vineyard with a 90 dollar price tag. The wine has a nice nose on it and the longer it sat the more it mellowed. I don't personally feel it was worth 90 bucks.\n\nLittle things were annoying. The soda tasted a little bit like chlorine - one would think that a gourmet restaurant would pay attention to detail like that. \n\nThe service was SPOT ON. That's why we left a 20% gratuity. \n\nThe base bill was 318.00 for three people - this wasn't Jardini\u00e8re, Saison, Gary Danko, Benu, or Michael Mina's.", "author": "Marna G."}

We were hungry, so we decided to grab food at this place.\n\nI am glad we had our little impromptu to eat here. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo, which I love, and consider myself an expert of the perfect fettuccine alfredo...yes, I said expert, lol! My friend got the pasta with vodka sauce. Our portions looked a little small, but they were both deliciously divine, definitely hit the spot and surprisingly filled us up. \n\nWe also got wine with our meal. The menu said that they had one of the top wine cellars in the Bay Area. After sipping our wines, I realized they were not lying, the wines were divine, and some of the best I had. \n\nIn short, I would definitely go back one day to this place. There are a lot of great places in the Bay Area to eat at, but if a friend was in town and wanted to explore and eat in SF Little Italy, I would definitely take them here. \n\nPrices a little high for what you get, but definitely worth it overall. \n\nOh and last note....if it is a nice day, request to sit outside the restaurant.

After poking our head into a few restaurants and finding out wait times were a lot lengthier than our growling stomachs would allow we were pleased to find an open table at this restaurant.\n\nMy first impression was that this was going to be a tasty meal.  Who doesn't love good Italian food?  I was excited.\n\nStaff was very friendly and all the food came out promptly.  We ordered two caeser salads and a soup (can't remember which soup) to start.  The salads had a beautiful taste but had a sloppy preparation - the wife even commented on it.  The soup was not memorable.\n\nFor entrees I ordered the Cioppino and my wife ordered the Fettuccini with Fresh Clams.  \n\nI love Cioppino but to be honest it's not often done really well.  This one was no exception.  I expect a fish stew with fresh and varied ingredients, and hopefully some very nice crab.  There wasn't the typical broth - this was much too much tomato flavor, hurt by the thick pasta sauce/paste consistency.   As to the seafood - there were two mussels, one shrimp, a few small pieces of clam (without shell), the rest was white fish.  It had an okay flavor but this was not the dish I wanted.\n\nMy wife enjoyed her entr\u00e9e.  The pasta was not fresh but was good nonetheless;  The fresh clams did not come in their shell but seemed plentiful (I have my doubts about how fresh they were).  For the portion size $29 seemed pricey - and yeah I realize it's S.F.\n\nOverall...  I expect more from an Italian restaurant in North Beach.", "author": "Josh D."}

I'd wanted to keep walking to go to our 3rd choice, however, I glanced at the menu, found they had Cioppino and said \"screw it, let's eat here.\"\n\nNever again.\n\nThe waiter tried bullying us into ordering more and expensive dishes. Even after we said we only wanted the one dish and entree he'd say \"I really recommend this, not that.\" Then about 5 minutes later he'd stroll out with the dish he'd recommended even though no one in the party stated they wanted it.\n\nAs he placed the dishes in front of us, we said: \n\"We didn't want this. We didn't order it.\"\n\nHe yelled and said \"Then what is it that you want?!\"\n\nWe told him our original order.\n\nHe huffed and puffed and said \"I told you, you can't have that. You can have this.\"\n\nI said, \"I came for the cioppino, I want that.\"\n\nHe stormed off in a fit. Unclear as to whether or not we'd get that. We hemmed and hawed about leaving. We were angry that he kept bringing us entrees we didn't order, and that he was trying to bully us.\n\nFinally he came out with the food, and as he placed it down he muttered \"You can't really have this.\"\n\nThe soup was delicious. It was good. It was fine, there was plenty of it for us.

All he kept saying was \"No, I don't recommend that.\"\n\nAfter that little interaction, we debated about just eating our appetizer and leaving. But she insisted on staying. When our entrees came out, he brought her the dish he'd recommended and not the one she wanted.\n\nEven after I told him we did not want it nor did we order it he kept pushing the dish on us. It wasn't until I demanded the bill for the food eaten (the appetizer) that he backed off, and brought her what she ordered.\n\nThe appetizer was okay, the melon could have been a bit more ripe. The entrees were okay, but he did damper our mood a bit which made the meal less enjoyable.

Extensive menu including a few veal dishes that are my favorites.  I had scaloppine marsala. The meat was very tender and there was plenty of it. Served with sliced potatoes and broccoli rabe. We had a few appetizers to start which were all very good. The sauce with the veal was a bit sweet which was not to my liking. They may have used sweet marsala rather than dry but I'm just guessing. Wine was very nice and reasonably priced. Espresso was delicious as was the cannoli and cold zabaglione one of us had. Service was top notch. All in all a very nice evening out.", "author": "Guy R."}

I had a fabulous meal and will most likely return if I am every feeling indulgent! Came here for a holiday dinner with my colleagues and we basically were told to get whatever we wanted. We each had a sampler appetizer plate that consisted of lobster tail, prosciutto and a type of cheese. Each one tasted like butter. The prosciutto paired with the cheese melted in my mouth and the lobster tail was super juicy and delicious! We then ordered a main dish and my colleague and I split a T-bone steak with pasta. I wish I remembered what pasta we ordered but wow both dishes did not disappoint! Then to top off our amazing meals, we ended the night with a sampler platter of desserts: cheesecake, pudding, tiramisu and dipped strawberries. The meal was phenomenal and the waiters were incredible friendly. Great restaurant!", "author": "Samantha S."}

I had never heard of NBR but he was raving about it which helped me gather interest as I drove from San Jose to North Beach last Friday evening. Damn, such a long drive, especially knowing you're going to have to drive home in a few hours. The trip was more than worth it, in fact, I would've driven another 2 hours to hang with my best friend and the rest of the dinner party. Sometimes it is cool to be grown up and somewhat civilized. \n\nOkay, the food. Actually let's talk waiter first. Al Capone was our waiter, Jimmy Hoffa was the maitre d' and Tony Montana was sitting at the table next to us with a big pile of white stuff. I think it was gnocchi. Our waiter did look like a skinny Al Capone and my friend and I kept trying to figure out if he had a mustache. If it was there it was pencil thin and I couldn't see it. Very nice waiter, attentive, kept the wine glasses full, and was always within arms reach. I'd give the service 5 starts if it was not for the requisite 20 minute waiter break between the end of our dining and when the bill came. I swear every restaurant I've ever been to picks up the last finished plate, asks if everything was ok and then the entire staff leaves the building. \n\nI had the veal parmesan. It was thinly sliced, with a well balanced red sauce and just the right amount of melted mozzarella. It comes with a tiny bit of saut\u00e9ed spinach and two roasted potato slices. The quantity was perfect for me. It didn't induce a food coma like so many other Italian restaurants and frankly when I ordered, I was worried about eating and driving. I almost got the petrale to play it safe but you know what, sometimes you just have to live on the very edge and get a little crazy. \n\nI'd definitely go back, but before I do I am going to hit joe's and try and find a smaller quaint Italian option as well.", "author": "Don A."}

However, I think she was too kind in giving three stars.\n\nThe Maitre 'D was very kind and welcoming, but that was the extent of the positive vibe here.  Our server seemed to hate us.  I guess I can't blame him completely, because one of my dining companions asked A LOT of questions.  There may have been some communication problem, as he contradicted himself a few times.  One example: he said the corkage fee was $20, when in fact it ended up being $30.  Yes, that's completely outrageous, but if you see the markups on their bottles, you'll probably save money bringing your own.\n\nService was slow throughout the evening, although the place wasn't busy.  And I should add, the best service we got was from the guys pouring water.  We saw them much more often than we did our server.  If I could have tipped them separately, I would have.\n\nWe ordered three pasta dishes, which ranged from meh to good.  Nothing great, however.

We weren't in a hurry, but he took so long to get back to us that we decided to skip appetizers & just get our main dishes.\n\nFor my entree I had the gnocchi piemontese.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-27", "description": "Visited on a Wednesday night at the recommendation of work colleagues living in San Francisco. Short summary - it was... okay. I am a bit of a pasta snob, so I take my Italian food seriously, and this place, while decent, was far from life-changing, or even really memorable.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Busy and small. The restaurant is small, and they have absolutely maximized their dining room space by all but stacking tables on top of each other. We ended up going through what felt like a maze to get to a section of the dining room by a window, and it was a TIGHT squeeze to get between the tables. To my dismay, the aisle between us and the table across from us was only about 1 to 2 feet, so it felt like we were dining together. (kudos to the food service people who actually have to navigate this space!!!)\n\nFOOD: Decent. Not terrific, not terrible, just in the middle. Depending on the dish, the portions are very small, so if you are hungry be sure to ask your server what the portion size of your dish is BEFORE you order it. Here's a breakdown of what we had:\n\n1 - Home-Cured Prosciutto and Melon - Nice, but small portioned (maybe 4 pieces of extremely thin meat and 2 melon slices) and not nearly worth the $15 price tag.\n\n2 - Carpaccio alla Veneziana - Meh. Same as above. Nice, but not worth the cost (unless you aren't the one paying the bill).\n\n3 - Ravioli Toscana - Homemade - Actually these were quite good. Nice flavor, well seasoned, and good sauce. My biggest issue with them was the fact that there were only THREE. Who charges $21 for 3 ravioli? The website shows a picture of this dish with like 20 on the plate - seriously misleading, and if you're hungry, this dish isn't going to cut it.\n\n4 - Lasagna - Decent, but again misleading. The menu suggests these were made to order, and like other reviewers, our order was up and on the table about 10 minutes after ordering it. I think it's HEATED to order. That said, the flavor was okay, but again the price tag was dissapointing (sense a trend??)\n\n5 - Petrale Mugnaia - Expensive ($33), very small portioned, and while nice enough tasting, not worth a second try because I forgot it until just now as I'm writing the review.\n\nSERVICE: Fair. Our server was well informed about the menu, accommodating with drink and water, and brought the check in an efficient / timely way.. \n\nVALUE: Poor - see the food notes for specifics. In all, the portions are way under, and the inflated costs of the dishes way over. Due to this fact alone, I'll likely not be back. There are a TON of options in North Beach to try which don't have such a high opinion of themselves.", "author": "Jenifer W."}

I was dressed casual as I had been out in the park for the day and felt very uncomfortable. I know this is a \"higher end\" restaurant but a paying guest is a paying guest. I felt like we were not given the best treatment because of our casual dress and the place had a pretentious vibe in general. The food was good- but not exceptional and for how much everything cost (this place was super expensive, even for SF). Maybe a better spot for older crowds but I certainly won't be recommending NBR nor dining myself here again. The competition is just too stiff and I was overall very unimpressed. I guess a note to self also is to not forget your business cards nor dine in casuals. Regardless- will not be returning.", "author": "Alex F."}

That's about the only thing that stood out.\n\nThe restaurant is fairly loud, and most two-top tables are in the traffic path to the kitchen and bathrooms.  Not a good place for a romantic dinner.\n\nThe food is average.  I had ossobuco and my wife had the eggplant parmesan.  Both were reasonably tasty, but definitely not worth the price charged, even for North Beach.\n\nWhen the eggplant parmesan arrived, it was served with a side of potatoes.  We both thought that was a bit odd, but had failed to notice it on the menu.  My wife asked the waiter for a small portion of pasta to go with her sauce, and the waiter said something to the effect of, \"oh, all I can do is give you one of the sides on the menu, like pasta with marinara sauce -- the kitchen won't give me plain pasta.\"  He didn't even bother asking.  Way to charm us.\n\nWhen it came time for dessert, he rattled off the standard fare (tiramisu, zabaglione, chocolate mousse, cheesecake, etc.).  It was barely Italian.  I asked him which desserts were prepared at the restaurant (knowing well that when you see cheesecake on the list, it's probably the Sysco special).  He admitted that only the tiramisu and zabaglione were made there.  We both passed and had some coffee.\n\nNo one even noticed when we left.

I also don't write negative reviews because I don't have negative experiences at restaurants. This place breaks the mold. \n\nWe innocently tried to park with the valet service at North Beach Restaurant. After the car was driven off, we started walking down the street to meet a friend at a near by restaurant before returning to North Beach. The valet started screaming at us aggressively that we couldn't do that. Underline AGGRESSIVELY. I replied with, \"then bring us the damn car.\"\n\n30 seconds later I had this valet two inches from my face screaming every obscenity in the book. \"YOU F*&%$#*$ A__HOLE, YOU PIECE of S#$%, and on and on while practically spitting and fighting back his apparent desire to get physical. To say I feared for my safety is an understatement.\n\nI walked inside and explained to the host that they had a real problem with their valet. He calmly walked outside and was met by the ranting valet who screamed and shouted that I was the one who was swearing at him and this was all my doing. The host told him to stop swearing, at which point the valet walked up to me and got 2 inches from my face again, without words, but just some sort of \"I'm going to kill you\" stare down.\n\nNow I had no choice but to wait inside to eliminate the chance of further problems while we waited 15 minutes for the car to return. My only other option was to call the police because the management of the restaurant was clearly unable to control the situation. \n\nUpon leaving the valet slammed my door in an effort to display his so called professionalism to the owner who was standing outside. As we pulled away the valet stood just outside of the owner's site flipping us off and mimicking us like a 6 year old.\n\nTHIS PLACE SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS.

I have been at this place in 2003 and I remember eating a fabulous petrale alla mugnaia. I remember the restaurant also served the cioppino so I decided to try it again.\nNorth Beach Restaurant is conveniently located at the intersection of Columbus Avenue and Stockton Street in the North Beach district. The inside is elegant and it has a typical Italian restaurant interior design and feel which means no pathetic Italian flags or photos of Naples and Sicily all over the walls.\nSince I previously ordered a petrale alla mugnaia, this time I tried the cioppino. For drinking, I ordered a Moretti beer. While our meals were being prepared, our waiter brought us some garlic bread that I dipped in olive oil. When the cioppino arrived it looked very nice, it smelled very good and it tasted amazing. I like to eat good authentic food and I think that North Beach Restaurant's cioppino is definitely something to try if you visit San Francisco. The course came with a crostone, crab meat, one shrimp, one clam, one piece of cod and one mussel. It all was drowned in a tomato-based broth that perfectly accompanied the seafood. I really liked the cioppino with the only exception of the mussel which tasted gross (I don't know how to explain the bad flavor you get from a mussel that either tastes disgusting, it's not cooked or something in between). The side was a combination of brown rice (I think) and some small broccoli (not too soft and not too crunchy).\nThe waiters are dressed up with a black jacket and they are very polite which I like. I am a traditionalist when it comes to food and service so I appreciate that. We had the pleasure to be served by Luca, a gentleman from Firenze who was nice and very well mannered.\nSeveral courses at the restaurant are in the $20 and $30 range but based on the food I tried, they are probably worth the price because after eating the petrale and the cioppino, I can guarantee you pay for the quality of the food and the preparation. The online menu lists several interesting things but I question a few options that to me do not sound very Italian like linguine with porcini & scallops (mushrooms and seafood just don't go together), combination of filet of veal and prawns (meat and seafood are not served together) and halibut (impossible to find in Italy). Aside from that, I see some errors like \"lasagna\" that should be spelled \"lasagne\".\nAll in all I give 4 stars to the restaurant because of I really liked it. I plan to go back again in the future to try other courses. I saw gnocchi [alla] piemontese which I definitely need to try since I was born and raised in Piedmont.", "author": "X. Y."}

Food selection was good, taste was good - fresh and flavorful however nothing to write home about. Its set in a nice area of SF so fun to stroll around after.\n\nCons: odd smell when you enter, lower level they call 'wine cellar' is a tad bit depressing, dark and dingy and located in the basement. Seating is uncomfy and the same chairs you'll find at a hotel banquet hall. Bread was not fresh. Pasta selection was heavy on the meat side - need better vegetarian options which is shocking considering this is SF. Wine choices were not good and the one glass I had was perhaps the worst I've ever tasted.\n\nIts not a formal, high end restaurant even though the servers all wear tuxedos so don't be thrown off.", "author": "Jonny M."}

The owner also has a winery in Sonoma so it has a strong focus on good wines. We tried their red-wine and the brunello, both of them great wines. \n\nIt took a little while to get a table. The restaurant was extremely busy and appeared quite a bit disorganized. Had to ask for ice water twice! \n\nWe had Cesar salad for starters. It was OK but really not much of an experience. \n\nFor mains we had sea scallops and Fillet of lamb. The scallops were extremely salty and in reality impossible to eat, so they were returned and replaced with veal masala. The veal had apparently been drowned in the Masala, so not a great dish either. The lamb was at best bland.\n\nThe waiter was anything but attentive.

So I guess I'm getting older, prefer just a nice glass of wine & phenomenal food and ambiance, which always puts a smile on my face. \nSo I was literally ready to leave NB fair, when we noticed the sidewalk seating of this Italian restaurant. \nI've been here before years ago.

We sat outside which was great to people watch.  \nNicola, our Italian waiter who was all dressed up in a tux, was super friendly. We took his advice... Brunello di Sonoma Poggia Alla Pietra (Petroni Vineyards) was absolutely amazing! And the mussels were so delicious. \nThe best part, was when someone called out my name... I thought I was pretty incognito w/ my cool US Open hat that I got yesterday & my shades...  I know SF is way too small; bound to bump into an old flame:(\nSo this guy just told us how he swore to himself that he would never return to this restaurant after a bad experience he had back 1997. So I laugh, then you shouldn't be sitting at our table...\nWell I have to say this place is great for a business meeting. I just got asked for my CV, and I'm not even looking for a job.

After fireworks on Independence Day, we wandered around with the masses to find dessert.  A friend had recommended North Beach Restaurant once before, so we decided to give them a shot.  Everything started out fine--nice decor, good ambience, friendly service...but then we ordered the tiramisu.\n\nIf this was not an Italian restaurant, or if it was located somewhere with few Italians or little competition, I might be more lenient, but this was among the worst examples of tiramisu I have ever tasted.  The cake/ladyfingers was overly soaked, so was mushy.  There was not enough filling between the cake layers to provide that luxurious, creamy deliciousness that I expect from tiramisu.  It just had no flavor--between two of us, we didn't finish it, which speaks for itself.  There's just no excuse for this, especially in North Beach and at these prices.\n\nThey get 2 stars because of the aforementioned service, etc. and because the prosciutto and melon that hubby ordered was pretty good.

After circling many blocks my friend had finally found a legal, metered parking space right across the street and was backing in.  A valet in uniform, a medium short stocky guy with crew cut hair, ran from across the street, motioned for someone he seemed to know to make a U turn from in front of the restaurant, bumped my friend's car, and announced that it was his spot.  When she initially refused to leave he said he was going to call the police.  I've seen these situations before and if the police aren't on somebody's pay they'll tell the valet to go to hell, you can't claim a parking space by playing zone offense, but when you have a new car with a nice paint job you don't want to challenge people over a parking spot.\n\nWho the $%# do they think they are letting their valet treat the neighbors like that?

It's pricey but is almost worth it due to the proximity to the theater alone and the portions were surprisingly large. An added bonus is that they're an Italian restaurant that offers more than just pasta dishes; they had a pretty extensive menu. I had the Chicken Toscana-- good sauce and the accompanying veggies and potatoes were pretty good. Classic Italian atmosphere complete with great hosts and waiters that seem to enjoy their job. Although the food and service was good, I'm only giving 3 stars because the food wasn't anything special...

We went to this restaurant before catching the Saturday night late show of  Beach Blanket Babylon.\n\nI'm rating this restaurant low because after eating here over the years and having great meals, this was the second time in a row it was dissapointing.    The main culprit again was the food.  We both consciously said let's order something other than a pasta dish given our experience a couple years earlier.  \n\nMy wife ordered the veal chop medium-medium rare and when it arrived, she could hardly cut through it.  Tough and full of gristle. When we told our server about this, he simply offered to replace it with veal marsala cutlets.  That dish turned our to be okay, nothing remarkable about the veal, the sauce, or the potatoes and vegetables.  \n\nI ordered the veal parmigiana and on our server's suggestion had them pound down a veal chop instead of using a cutlet. His comment was, \"it will be so good it'll have you speaking Italian in no time!\"   Unfortunately, I was still speaking English when I was done.  Very bland, and part of the veal was a little on the tough side.\n\nOn the non-food side, the ambience was great, our server Luis was very entertaining and efficient, just what you'd expect from the tuxedo'd old school Italian servers there.  (My wife and I did notice a bit of we're-living-off-our-reputation-attitude, but hey, you got a bunch of Italian guys running around, capiche?).\n\nUnfortunately, we won't be coming back.  I generally figure a restaurant, even one as expensive as this, can have an off night food wise.  To have it happen twice in a row when our visits are every couple of years is just too much, especially when there are so many other good ones in the North Beach area.", "author": "John S."}

I had ordered wine and specifically said when the main course comes out then bring the wine to the table... nope.. I was half way through my weak cocktail and then there was another glass of alcohol in front of me.  That is one thing I really dislike.  Let me finish what I am already drinking.

It didn't melt in my mouth and make me want more. I let my husband finish it.  I don't plan on ordering that again.\n\nCalamari Vinaigrette (House specialty): Pretty good. It is a cold dish so if you are someone who likes their calamari fried this is not for you.  It wasn't chewy at all and the vinaigrette was a nice touch.  I would order it again.\n\nMain Course:\n\n(When it arrived the waiter spilled the sauce from one plate onto the table.  That could have been on my silk shirt dude.. I would have been pissed.  Again, are you seriously that busy that you can't slow down? Please try not to throw the patrons food at them.)\n\nSea Scallops - Saut\u00e9ed in White Wine Mushroom Sauce: No complaints. Not the best I have ever had but the mushroom sauce was a really nice touch to the scallops.  It is a very rich dish so if you have a sensitive stomach this is not for you.  I like that the potatoes they pair with it are just lightly seasoned.  I wish the broccoli was also lightly seasoned instead of dripping with sauce.  \n\nCombination of Filet of Veal and Prawns - White Wine, Lemon and Butter Sauce:  My husband wished he had ordered pasta.\n\nDesert:\nCheesecake: YUM and yes I would order this again.\n\nAs for the price?

So we walked into many foyers looking for the one and North Beach Restaurant was it.\n\nThe service was flawless, and was designed to make you feel like you were in North Beach back in the day. \"Bellissima\" and \"Signoria\" were common phrases used by our server, but it was not cheesy, it was charming. \n\nThe pappadelle with shrimp smothered in vodka sauce was divine. The caesar salad was straight forward, no frills, tasty. The wine the server recommend was perfectly paired with what I ordered.\n\nThis is definitely a special occasions restaurant.

Came here for a birthday dinner because Tommaso's was way too crowded, so my friend called here and the host said he could seat them immediately. I stayed behind to wait for a friend when I get a call telling me they won't sit us until everyone's there. That's okay but what I don't understand is they sat the 5 of us at a table meant for 4, and 3 were there already...would it really have looked THAT bad? No, I don't think so. Instead, we stood around for over half an hour with that promise of immediate seating being flung out the door as soon as we walked in. \n\nThe food was okay, but I've had better. I got the Linguine w/ Fresh Clams in White Wine sauce....it was good, but I've had better. The clams didn't seem too fresh, and the White Wine sauce was watery and a bit too salty. It felt and looked like something I could have made at home for half the price and twice the freshness.\n\nThe service was actually pretty good, the waiter took time to explain stuff not on the menu as well as things we might not understand. Food came out pretty quick. \n\nBut the bill...my God, the bill. $250 and most of that stuff could have been made at home for at less than half the price. I felt bad for my friends that paid, they had to split a horrendously overpriced bill. I would have been okay if the food WOWED me, but it did not come close to doing that. \n\nWhat really made me give this rating is the douche of a host that tries to be funny but ends up being rude. I don't care to repeat his crap here but honestly I wanted to punch the guy, but our table was finally ready and I didn't want to get kicked out or arrested.

I remembered how much I disliked this area when I stepped inside and was almost caught in a stampede of suits trying to exit the restaurant.  So my bias against the Marina not withstanding, I'll try to provide a useful description.\n\nFOOD:\nStarters:\n--Cesar Salad: standard, a little on the tangy side.  I told Marco to go heavy on the pepper; too heavy, I couldn't taste anything but pepper\n--Farinata da lucca: thick soup with pureed beans and polenta.  So thick our waiter thinned it out by drizzling olive oil over it.\n\nEntrees:\n--Porchetta al Barolo: pronounced Pork-etta.  Roasted pork loin served with sauteed potatoes and haricots verts all resting on a thick layer of gravy.  I resisted the urge (and failed) to call it 'Porketta Pig'.    \n--Sea Scallops sauted in a white wine mushroom sauce was a bit bland and the three smallish scallops sliced in half to make you think you're getting more than you were--not flavorful enough to warrant the $30 price tag.\n\nDessert:\n--Tiramisu: hard to mess up this timeless dessert.  \n--Lemon Sorbet: chosen to clear my palate but wasn't necessary as my palate wasn't wowed by any bold flavors.\n\nSERVICE:\nMarco was the quintessential trattoria-style waiter.  Attentive service in which 'grazzi's and 'prego's abound, he politely addressed us Signora and Signore.  Too bad his charm was lost in a place that failed to impress.  \n\nCOST:\nOur party of four spent about $250 on a 3-course meal of soup/salad, main course, desert and coffee.  \n\nBEST PART OF THE EVENING:\nThe poor valet was sweatin' bricks with one patron after another waiting for \"the black Mercedes 500SL\"--emphasis on the 500SL,  \"the silver Porsche Roadster\"--emphasis on the Roadster.  Without missing a beat, I said \"Brown Ford Pinto\"--emphasis on the Pinto.    You know how people say, \"He just did a double take\" but by the time you look you miss the double take?

Then we started off with mussels, prosciutto + melon (basically 2 pieces of cantalope), and fried calamari appetizers. Mussels were unremarkable, the calamari was fried properly, and the prosciutto (one of the house specialites) was not too salty and the texture was almost melt in your mouth.\n\nFor the main course I got the pasta della casa which had mushrooms, and very small bits and pieces of veal and prosciutto. The wine sauce complimented the pasta well but I wish there was a little more meat in it. Overall though it was a decent dish that I would not mind getting again.\nMy brother got the veal with mushrooms which was very tender and flavorful. Sorry I dont remember the actual name but I think the veal in general is a safe bet here. I also tried some of the salmon which was ordinary. Appetizers ranged ~$15 while the dishes varied from $20-$40.\n\nDessert consisted of tiramisu and some kind of alcoholic tasting pudding. Both were below average for the price (~$10 each). Apparently the tiramisu here did not have mascarpone cheese so I would avoid dessert here for sure.\n\nOverall a very nicely decorated restaurant with excellent service but the food was just slightly above average and with a $$$ price tag, I probably will not be coming back.", "author": "Robert Y."}

While the guys up front were very nice and friendly; I had Snobby McGee for my waiter;  black slick backed hair who had the weirdest voice ever. I hate admitting to watching this movie but he looked and sounded like Andy Richter's character from the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson movie  \"New York Minute\".\n\nI was on vacation by myself. But I still like going to restaurants. Unfortunately; he seemed to pay attention to the couples more than me. He asked the couples how their food was but not once did he ask me. I usually dont want waiters to be on top of me but not to completely ignore me. Just once throughout the evening I'd like to be asked how it's going. While everything I ordered came quickly; I had to get his attention if I wanted anything. I sat in front of the dessert menu for a good amount of time before he finally asked me in an annoyed tone if I \"would like some dessert\" I was liking some dessert five minutes ago! He also corrected the way I pronounced Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nWhat really bugs me is I shouldn't be treated as a second class citizen just because I was by myself.  I usually feel guilty when I eat by myself and overtip 20% or more for good service to make up for the fact that I order less than a usual table being one person. Since he chose to be Snooty Mcgee; I only gave the standard 15%. Some may think even that may be too generous based on my review but he was efficient and got everything I ordered fast to my table despite his snobbishness. \n\nDespite all this the food was excellent and I might even go back. I'd just ask for a different table if I got that same waiter again.", "author": "Alan S."}

Most of the waiters have been there for decades; the menu has variations on two of my favorites: petrale sole and veal cutlets. I've enjoyed prosciutto and melon, too. Portions are adequate in size, and quality of meat is very good. The chef has good ideas, has put his name on certain creations and knows that all \"Italian food\" does not need a thick coating of red sauce and melted cheese! Entree accompaniments are usually sauteed greens and oven roasted potatoes -- very nice. A word about the patrons: people go there, over and over, to eat a good dinner and enjoy conversation.

This is unfortunate because, all in all, the \"North Beach\" restaurant is a  pretty damn short stick\n\nI've been here twice, once with family which was an experience I pretty much forget, except for my distinct memory that, upon leaving the restaurant I was given the rare and wonderful opprotunity to use the word \"clusterfuck\".\n\nThe second time I came here I went, as usual, with my girlfriend. In all honesty, there really isn't much I have to say about this place that was postive other than that we were seated quickly and the server was knowlagable about the menu.\n\nThe bads:\n\nThe corkage fee here is pretty much rediculous, $35 dollars. Included in this fee were two short, narrow shitty glasses that allowed my $65 dollar chianti to breath like a fat, asmatic, youth in a marathon. Our waiter was excessively attentive to my wine, constatly refilling my glass as if there were some sort of bomb attached to my table that would explode if my glass had less than 3 onces of wine in it. Maybe it's just me, but after the first pour, I like to self serve.\n\nFoodwise, we got some pruchitto thing that was decent and our server recommended but that wasn't very memorable. My girlfriend ordered something with marinara sauce that was alright, but nothing extrodinary. \n\nI ordered steak. I ordered steak in the only way it should be ordered, Meduim rare. Now one may argue that steak should be cooked to another temperature, perhaps rare, perhaps more cooked, but you are wrong. It's doesn't matter that it's an opinion-based discussion. If you want a well done steak, just get a burger, if you want a rare steak, go out for sushi. Thank you. \n\nThat said my $35 steak did not come out medium rare. No blood was to be had on my plate and the middle was only slightly pink. Additionally, the outside of the steak was so burnt it was as if the chef had chosen to put the meat IN the fire rather than on the grill. The steak came with some sad looking spinach and maybe some potatoes. Fucking awful. I failed to complain to the waiter, yes totally my bad, but i didn't want to spend more time in that restaurant than i absolutely had to.\n\nOverall the \"North Beach\" restraunt is a stain on this district rather than an exemplary member.

The decor is that muraled Italian-old school-bistro-cute we all know. The food, while very tasty at the basic pasta/antipasto level, is not exactly innovative. Would avoid major meat selections, esp. chicken, as they can be dry. Wine list? Scusi? Si! Great selection of Italian wines here...and for me that's really the draw.

For my main I decided on the grilled lamb filet and my dining neighbor had the halibut in red sauce. She raved about her fish. My lamb I thought was just okay but perhaps I was too full to enjoy all of it. \nFinally for dessert we ordered a few desserts to share with our coffees and our waiter brought us a free lemonciello type of drink. It was SO DELICIOUS. Perfect for an after dinner drink or for a great sunny day. \nOverall, the food and service were good but for myself I am not sure if this is a place I would come back to.", "author": "Julie F."}

Nothing amazing, not awful but your basic Italian fare.  However, unbeknownst to us, the wine they liberally kept pouring for us was quite expensive and they included an appetizer which I thought was part of a prix-fixe menu but was actually quite an expensive addition that no-one had requested.  They did not have the main course I ordered and instead of asking me for a replacement, they just brought me something else and put it in front of me.  And when I protested the waiter said, \"We were out of what you ordered\"  In the end, it was $165 per person for a meal I sort of thought was okay.  Seriously, $165 for one person?  I would have gone to Gary Danko or LaFolie for that price.", "author": "Virginia T."}

I held a work dinner there with 20 people before seeing Beach Blanket Babylon.  They were fantastic!  They knew we were seeing the show after dinner and had us in and out in time for the show without us feeling rushed.\n\nThe food was exceptional.  With large parties, you expect the typical pre-cooked and ready to go menu, but I was very surprised at the quality.  Our menu offered something for everyone and they even added in another dish we were not expecting.  We had folks in from Europe and they commented that is was some of the best Italian food they had in the US.\n\nI was happy that I was able to stay under budget and there were no last minute surprises on the bill that can happen at other restaurants.  I also liked that they told us what the suggested tip was, but did not automatically add it in.  It allowed me to tip them what I felt was appropriate and more than the 15%-17% they add on.\n\nThe staff was amazing.  Our glasses were never less than 1/2 full.

On my own for the evening, I thought I'd try Little Italy of the West.  A quick FourSquare search revealed on option close to where I was standing, but after a 5 minute wait in a restaurant that wasn't full, I decided to cross the street where North Beach Restaurant, with its schnazzy facade, prime location, and good crowd seemed like a next best option. \n\nGreeted at the door by the friendly maitre d', I was shown a nice table, and plopped my weary self down for what smelled like a promising repast. Kudos to the senior wait staff for their upkeep - its rare, particularly in this city where casual is a serious undertaking, to find a throwback where gentleman of a certain age don a black tie to serve.  \n\nThe obligatory bread plate (focaccia, french, rustic) was quickly presented, along with a much needed glass of water and the wine list.  \n\nAnd it was all down hill from there.  \n\nThe tome of a wine list oddly had the 'by the glass' section on the 2nd to last page.  The hundreds of wines by the bottle under-compensated for the tired BTG selection of predictables (Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Barbara) and some odd choices (several sparkling \"combos\"), so I decided to wing it and go with their house Sonoma blend.  Meh.  \n\nThe laminated menu looked to have been compiled in the mid-eighties with nary a variation since.  The tired roster of done to death regulars like Veal Marsala and Chicken Parm was...I suppose...to be expected in this 'hood. I guess I half expected to find something interesting, but probably not at an establishment with all the trappings this place had.  Oh well.  Classics can be good, if they're done right.  \n\nI ordered a small salad and the porcini risotto. \n\nThe salad, albeit not dressed to death, was fine.  SF uses terms like local, organic, and fresh with much more aplomb than many other places in this country, so I was hoping for more than iceberg in what seemed like leftover caesar salad dressing. \n\nMy hopes for better things forthcoming were dashed immediately upon seeing the slop that was supposed to be porcini risotto.  Without tasting it, without even stirring it, I could tell it was all wrong.  \n\nNB: I like to order simple dishes like this when I go to a new place, because 1) they're pretty hard to get completely wrong and 2) its a good test to see that the rest of the menu has a solid foundation.  \n\nMore than risotto, it resembled rice porridge with mushrooms.  My mind went to Giorgio Locatelli's beautiful description of the 'mantecatura', that wonderful, creamy binding that elevates risotto its place higher on the menu than one would think to put a simple rice dish.  It is done as the last stage of making the dish: in the pan one vigorously whips with a wooden spoon cold cubes of butter and shredded parmigiano reggiano into the rice, using all the enthusiasm and arm power needed to whip cream by hand.  The end result is a glistening web of fat that binds the rice together.  \n\nHere's what my dish had: undercooked, chewy rice with complimentary undercooked and tasteless porcini's in scant numbers, swimming in liquid that 10 more minutes on the stove would have greatly improved the whole dish (but only in texture).  To boot, the broth was 'delightfully' gritty.  A note to those folks who use porcini's: once you've steeped the mushrooms, you must 1) strain the liquid with very fine cheese cloth before adding it to the broth, and 2) rinse the mushrooms, as they have after all been growing in dirt.  \n\nFor $27 (!!!) I should say I reasonably expected better. \n\nAn affront to the dish to be sure, and the stuff was so hot I burned my tongue, even after waiting a few minutes for it to cool down.  Wah wah wah. \n\nSuffice it to say, I did not opt for dessert, especially after watching the globs of stuff they call tiramisu that was being served at the table next to me.  \n\nI would put no stars, but I'm not sure you can and still post a review.   I would very much like to see these types of restaurants go by the wayside forever, and I'm shocked to see this relic still doing business in a city that purports to know food.  There are far too many in existence near the old homestead, but I have seldom been as disappointed anywhere there as much as I have been here.  \n\nI shall not make a second trip.\n\nJ Castellano\n\nPS - I tried to redeem the whole experience by popping over to Stella's for what is supposed to be SF's best cannoli, but the two idiots making coffee (does it take two people to hit the button on the espresso machine?) were so un-attentive to the 6 people standing in line in front of me that I had to leave to spare my jangled nerves from further assault.

I understand that there are gourmet Italian restaurants and you pay a premium to dine at those establishments. However, I didn't consider North Beach a gourmet restaurant, but more of classic/traditional restaurant, and as a result, the pricing seemed a bit high to me. Anyway, on to the food. We had the fried calamari and caprese salad as appetizers. The fried calamari was great, but the caprese salad was lacking a flavorful/juicy tomato, so it was a bit disappointing. I had the tagliatelle bolognese pasta and it was amazing. My Mom had the Cannelloni, which I tried, and it was also great! Their wines by the glass were pretty good, but again, a bit overpriced. \n\nI would eat at North Beach Restaurant again, and I would recommend it others, but with a word of caution on price.

This place has $10 valet parking, which in simple Nevada is BS, but in San Francisco is unfortunately reasonable. I just deducted it from my tip for the waiter.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, but my sweet lady and I opted for a glass of the Syrah and Zinfandel, respectively. I must say, my Zin was absolutely killer, and that's just the standard wine there. \n\nAssortment of bread was nice, plus the vinegar and oil was imported from Italy and that's super cool. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Scallopine Piccata and she oredered the Eggplant Parmisiana (more commonly known as Eggplant Parmesan here in the states). This leads me to a complaint: What's the deal with this half Italian, half English garbage they have going on in the menu. With all these fancy and therefore delicious-sounding things on the menu like \"Chicken al Mattone,\" who is going to order \"Breasts of Chicken?\" Boring! Fix that. \"Petti di Pollo\" sounds way better.\n\nMoving along, it was surprisingly boisterous inside. The romance was all but gone as a result. I don't tuck my shirt in to go somewhere raising my voice somewhere. I'm much less suave when I have to raise my voice.\n\nI suspect that the waiter did not give us as much attention because we are a bit younger than the average guest. Like we weren't going to tip him or something because we were poor and/or didn't understand tipping. I have a credit card, jerk! \n\nBut shoot, I can't give $10 to the valet and to the waiter. What am I supposed to do in this situation!?\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing. The chicken was tender and the sauce was silky smooth and exactly what I wanted. The potatoes were of a nice thickness and tasted great when dipped in the sauce. Even the vegetables were good. At most places that's like a garnish and they don't put much effort into it, but here I actually wish I had more. Good mix of spinach and artichoke with some sort of lemon zest. \n\nI didn't try the Eggplant because I take issue with its misleadingly unsavory name. Also, I don't like how it tastes. But apparently it was also really good.\n\nHighly recommended based on the quality of the food and drink alone. If you don't mind a little noise, this place may very well be your favorite fine Italian dining spot in San Francisco.", "author": "Luchenzo D."}

I know there are a lot of Italian restaurants in the city but this is by far my favorite one. Drive up and the valet takes your car and parks it. You enter the restaurant and immediately you are made to feel that you are a very special person. Your escorted to a table and when your waiter arrives you feel like your the king of England or something. Service here is superb. What I like more than anything else is the Sand Dabs when in season. They prepare them better than anywhere else. Another thing I like here is the selection of wine they have. If you ever come here you just have to take a tour and go into the basement and check out their wine cellar. Mmmmmm nice.\nHave never had a bad or mediocre meal here.

Yes, as in marijuana, which prompted me to update my FB status with \"Apparently, when you overuse basil, it DOES taste just like weed.\" The status was a hit; your pesto was not. \n\nFour of our guests ordered filet mignon, none of which were cooked right. One was ordered to be butterflied, and cooked \"well done.\". While the greater crime here is really ordering a piece of filet mignon \"well done,\" that piece of steak still came out PINK. One of our salads had a piece of looong blonde hair perched neatly on tip. Obviously, we sent that shit back, and our server says, \"That's weird. No one in the kitchen even has blonde hair.\" What a sales pitch. Perhaps you have some oceanfront property in Arizona for sale?\n\nMost Italian places I've been to do really great desserts. This isn't one of them. The  tiramisus came out mushy and muddled, my semifreddo tasted like a wet sponge, and the cheesecake didn't even get finished. \n\nFor these reasons alone, North Beach Restaurant is not worth going to.

A family member decided on this place to host a little reunion with visiting cousins, so I went along with the plan. Some of the negative Yelp reviews scared the wits out of me and I kind of wanted to go somewhere a little more famous and flashy. Whatever. \n\nThe evening was really beautiful so North Beach was really hopping, making car and foot traffic pretty congested. So it was a great relief that the restaurant had a convenient corner location and valet parking. \n\nWhile waiting for the rest of our family to arrive I had a glass of grappa at the bar. It was excellent. The bar was on the small side and pretty crowded but service was prompt and helpful. \n\nIn the dinning room, our party had a fairly large table toward back. At this angle we were able to see the restaurants lovely decor. Somebody said it had been remodeled. Also, from our vantage point we could see the place was packed! \n\nThe waitstaff was attentive but not pushy. I know the relative recommending NBR had the owners as clients so maybe the waiters knew to recommend but to not sell up to our party. So no one had a problem with that issue. \n\nOur table ordered both red and white wines. Both wines were a lovely complement to our meal. \n\nI had the sweetbreads,  my husband ordered the brick chicken. Both dishes were perfectly prepared. There were ten people in our party and everyone really enjoyed their meal. I'm going to guess it was because we followed the recommendation of our host who knew his way around that very large menu. \n\nI really enjoyed my dinner at NBR.

Food was some what authentic, but definitely geared for either the well heeled or concierge guided tourist.  I was staying at the Intercontinental and the concierge recommended this restaurant on a Sunday.  I was looking for a good cioppino and she said it was one of her favorites.\n\nAfter a pricy taxicab fare, I arrived as the last seating for brunch was taken.  I ordered the cioppino at $22 and was greeted with a small bowl of a few shrimp, some clams, mussels, and, I think, a scallop.  This was definitely an appetizer size entr\u00e9e rather than a full on meal.  The cioppino I had at Tadich Grill was three times (3X) the size and was a full meal in itself.  Granted it was $32 at Tadich, but it was a much better product than North Beach's.\n\nSince I was starving when I arrived, I asked the waiter for a suggestion and he recommended the special, osso buco.  Having no choice as they were closing down, I picked it and polished off another mini-entr\u00e9e.

There was a hint of Dijon mustard in the sauce which I would never put but it actually worked pretty well.  The side dishes were very good.  Now, the bad part was the Caesar. Too anchoveeeee. Not enough garlic or parm cheese and I guess that some folks like their Cesar's like this but I don't.  I think that garlic should be the predominant taste, not anchovy and this salad was quite fishy smelling and just did not have the nutty, garlicky taste that I prefer.  My colleague had veal Marsala which was nicely done and served with the same sides.  I have not eaten here since 2008 but this place was very good.

Our friends were from out-of-town and were celebrating the wife's completion of the Nike Marathon and we suggested that we go to the North Beach. Unfortunately, our friend began having such bad cramps that we realized that we weren't going to dinner anywhere, so at 7:25 we tried to cancel the reservation through Open Table but couldn't with only five minutes remaining before the reservation time. Instead, I got on the phone and called to be sure that they knew we couldn't make it. I told the person who answered my name several times, but he didn't seem to understand (or want to hear) and kept repeating back a very different name. He then became angry with me and said that I had made a 6:00 pm reservation and had called to change it to 7:30, and was now calling to cancel.\n\n I insisted that that wasn't the correct name and said that we just made the reservations only moments earlier and wanted to be courteous and be sure they knew. He continued to blow up at me and told me how wrong it was of me to treat them that way (as I continued to protest that he had the wrong party) and said that they didn't need reservations from people like us and rudely hung up the phone. \n\nMy wife and I have been going to the North Beach since our first visit to SF together in 1985, and have continued to go there even after the Brass 'n Glass remodel.  We have lived in the East Bay since 1995 and have gone to the North Beach several times per year and have sent many people there through the years. I would sometimes drop in by myself for the house pasta and a glass of wine.

We didn't  even know the name of the place we were going to, but just pulled over at the nearest valet.  We gave up looking for parking after driving around North Beach for 30 minutes and avoiding the way- to- eager cops who were everywhere, giving out tickets like candy in this economy.  Into North beach restaurant we went. \n\nImmediately we were greeted by two older Italian men in suits who are friendly and old school   Yes!, I am in little Italy, or North Beach as it is known here. It was 10:30 on a Friday night, the place was lively and an open table awaited us. Perfect. Then, as is always the case in North Beach, the handsome Italian waiter (this time in tux) comes over, greets us, and you know it is going to be a fabulous meal. \n\nWe could not have asked for better service thanks to Dino, our waiter. He immediately set the tone for a comfortable, relaxed and unhurried dinner. I liked being handed the small bottles of oil and vinegar, served   with bread.  I am not sure why, but this small touch helped to make the beginning of the meal relaxed and as if we were in a small Italian restaurant with the locals. And in fact we were amongst many locals, but the place isn't small, although it feels like it. Most restaurants pour the oil for you, but this felt right, having an actual bottle of authentic imported oil to pour for myself. The wine was superb and the appetizer of Romaine with Shrimp and its' homemade mayonnaise was delicious.\n\nMy husband cannot eat dairy products and this can sometimes be a problem when ordering. After  discussing the menu with us, Dino, finally took the menu out of my husbands hands and said that he would surprise my husband with a pasta dish made especially for him. He knew the chef could create a dish.  Such service was unexpected and welcome.  As`we waited for our food, sipping our full bodied wines and nibbling on bread with plenty of heart healthy olive oil, (more is better for your heart?) the older gentlemen who greeted us chatted occasionally.  Watching the groups of diners was interesting and fun. From the rowdy and inebriated table of thirty-somethings, to the lively and also inebriated table of heavyset Italian men wearing gold chains and also wearing their napkins, to the couples talking softly, this place was entertaining and lively at 11pm. \n\nThe main course arrived of seafood risotto and a pasta dish of veal and the North Beach specialty, prosciutto, served with pappardelle pasta. Flavorful and perfectly prepared. There was no skimping on the seafood in the risotto, it was creamy and with texture, and it was what a seafood risotto should be. My hubbies' dish was very good with plenty of flavor even without any cheese. No room for dessert, we opted for a plate of small biscottis and espresso. \n\nNoticing people walking through the restaurant and heading downstairs to a wine cellar, I was curious and wanted to check this out. It was now midnight, and we asked if we could wander down there. Dino said he would join us, since he was finishing up. Downstairs is another dining room set in a wine cellar atmosphere. everyone had left so we wandered around and I wandered right into a room filled with hanging meats that are slowly becoming prosciutto.  If I wasn't sold on all the authentic Italianate-ness before, this sealed the deal. It doesn't get any more Italian than a room full of curing meats beside a wine cellar. North Beach Restaurant, don't change. Your food is delicious, your waitstaff wonderful, your patrons are entertaining and your truly authentic prosciutto, made in an old world style is  unique. We left happy and satisfied as North Beach was slowly winding down. Thanks to a $10 valet parking sign on the street, we found a new place to love.", "author": "Marilyn Y."}

Their featured special app was burrata cheese with tomato, and basil. YUM, my favorite!

He wanted to experience a \"traditional\" Italian meal at one of San Francisco's North Beach established restaurants, so he, one of my girlfriends, and I, chose North Beach Restuarant.   \n\nOur server was wonderful, but unfortunately his opportunity to serve us ended abruptly when bread and appetizers arrived.  The bread was old, stale, or I don't know what to think, AND...there was even a piece of lint in it!!  Then the burrata was as hard as regular mozzarella, maybe even harder...I could literally pick up the entire blob up with my fork like it was a piece of steak.  And the tomatoes on which the burrata was served, were mushy and old.\n\nWhen I proceeded to express our concerns, the manager, who has probably been there as long as the restaurant, was rude, curt, and suggested that we should probably leave if we are displeased vs. conceding to our complaints (the evidence was right infront of him on the table) and trying to fix the errors.  We were mortified and shocked at his response...so arrogant, combative, rude, and apathetic to what were clearly restaurant errors.  What's worse, as a doting aunt, I am not ok that my nephew had to see this when the entire point of going here was for him to have an outstanding and fun dining experience. \n\nA couple weeks later, I called the restaurant to share about our experience, hoping that this manager (unfortunately, I got the same arrogant jerk on the phone) would want to make good on this and that maybe he was just having a bad day the day we were there.  Unfortunately, he shared that he remembered us and proceeded to scream and yell AT ME, as though I was the one her served HIM bad food, and again refused to make good on this experience and kept yelling at me.  \n\nI guess for me, it is incredible that a restaurant that has been around so long and a manager that clearly has been there for decades, would treat guests with such disrespect and animosity.  This man's arrogance and rudeness were staggering to me, as I can't imagine that he treats all paying customers so rudely and with so much contempt when REASONABLE AND LEGITIMATE complaints are made.  Then again, in all fairness, it might just be this manager and not North Beach Restaurant...but it is a waste of time to speculate and he is the face of the restaurant to us at this point.\n\nFortunately, this story has a very happy ending!  We did end up going to another North Beach Italian eating institution, Fior D'Italia, and had an outstanding dining experience.  My nephew finally go the traditional North Beach SF Italian dining experience he wanted.  If things didn't go so terribly wrong at North Beach Restaurant, we never would have had the good fortune of going here.  The service and quality of the food were outstanding.  For a major tourist stop, I was very pleasantly surprised at how great the food was and my nephew LOVED his gnocchi.  I speak from experience, as I am from an Italian family with a wonderful eating and cooking tradition.  This place knows what it is doing in my humble opinion.  From the bread to the apps to the delicious fresh pasta and perfectly prepared fish and veg, we felt that the experience ended just as it should have.  Since I am a local to the SF Bay Area and never go to \"touristy\" places, I have to thank North Beach Restaurant for being the reason that we found Fior D'Italia....it's a little off the beaten path in North Beach and well worth the walk.

The second sad part was that my \"fresh\" pasta did not taste all that fresh.  I ordered a mushroom pasta and the flavors were good, but nothing memorable.

The Ma\u00eetre d' was really nice, oddly flirty with my friend, and was very helpful with helping us pick wine.  \n\nThe house made Brunello de Sonoma / Rosso de Sonoma (I think theses are the names) were both good with the food.  And really for the price the Rosso was just fine if eating.  Brunello maybe just by itself.  Though I'm no wine expert by any means.  Just looking at the $22 a glass price tag.\n\nAs for the food, we liked it.  Not the most shi-shi gourmet, but it had a nice homemade quality, was hearty and nicely seasoned.   The portions are pretty large.  \n\nStarted with the crab stuffed artichoke hearts.  Very good.  The caesar salad was just ok in comparison to the one we had at lunch at the Tadich Grill.  Then we shared the Polenta Soup.  We LOVED the polenta soup.  In fact, I'd love to find the recipe to try and make it at home in San Diego.  We just couldn't stop eating it although we were getting pretty full.  We finished with the chocolate tower.  Good, semi-sweet chocolate mouse definitely satisfies a sweet tooth and a chocolate craving.  I've had better, but really, it was solid.\n\nThe best part of the night was that we were there for 2 hours and never felt rushed.

The waiter very quickly sold a few people on the idea of having a tomato & buffalo mozzarella appetizer & scurried away before I'd had a chance to cast a vote, and thee next thing you know we all had one of our own. In all fairness, it was good, but not at all what I had planned to have as an appetizer & certainly not good enough that I would ever order it again. I chose the veal saltimbocca alla Nerone as my entree, but before ordering it I asked the waiter how it differed from veal saltimbocca alla Romana (which I've had dozens of times over the years at dozens of restaurants all over the country) and he described it as being exactly the same as what I know as \"alla Romana.\" The waiter also tried to push an overpriced bottle of wine from a vineyard we'd never heard of... he said the owners of the restaurant also own this particular vineyard... it wasn't bad, but in my mind worth perhaps a quarter of what they were asking, so we went with a few bottles of a well known cabernet instead. All things considered, my entree was very good, the appetizer was \"just\" good... & hard to get excited about, and the prices were set about 25% too high on most things and ridiculously high on others... $4.25 for one shot of espresso, really? Bottom line: I'd give the entree 4 stars, and award 2 stars to the service, uncomfortable table arrangement & high prices... so 3 stars overall seems fair... and I'm sure my friends would all rate the experience similarly.

I have no idea exactly what was in it, but prawns and white wine had something going on in there.  \n\nBy the time we got the appetizer, you guessed it, it was time for another bottle of that wine, note for future reference only 3 of the 4 of us are drinking.  When the waiter came back to take our dinner order, I told him to bring me anything (I have never done that before, I have never had the confidence in a new restaurant to just tell the waiter to bring me something he thinks I will like).  Again, by the time the dinner came it was time for a 3rd bottle of that wine (seriously it was that good).  My dinner was this chicken, prawn and something or other dish that I couldn't get enough of, I didn't ask what was in it, I didn't want to know, I didn't care,  I just ate it and every bite was heaven.\n\nThis place has fantastic service, without being to pushy or overly attentive.  And as I have said the wine and food are incredible.  The only down side is its expensive, I can only imagine our bill was upwards of $450, but as I wasn't paying I consider it well worth it...lol.", "author": "Carter H."}

First off, when I am at a restaurant where the average entree is $35+, I hope for excellent quality of ingredients and flavor. Not to say that North Beach Restaurant is bad, but it's not great and definitely overpriced. I ordered the Veal Chop, which came precut and closer to medium than medium rare. I understand completely that Italian food is done simple and let's the freshness of ingredients shine, but this was simply a redwine reduction over dry veal, a single potato cut into thirds, and a pile of underseasoned steamed spinach.\nMy brother (who is a bartender and server at a steak house), ordered the $45 new york strip medium rare--sadly it came to the table well done and dry. He politely informed the server that it was overcooked for his taste, to which there seemed to be too long of an upturned nose and awkward silence before taking it back. Almost as if defiant, a new steak was returned to us literally ice cold in the center and raw throughout. Aggrieved, but with sympathies my brother asked the waiter if it could just be slightly closer to a warm center as medium rare should be. The waiter, as if affronted, briskly snatched the plate back up and walked back to the kitchen. Finally, after our group was entirely finished eating, he was served a passable steak while the waiter hovered over my brother as he took a bite to see if it would be acceptable. \nA group of 13 people, and a $1150 bill later--I left unsatisfied.", "author": "Kevin J."}

They cure their own ham for the prosciutto in the basement (and if you get a tour you will most likely see a weird guy with slicked back hair wearing a tuxedo and eating a huge plate of pasta, very mobesque). \n\nThere is not a course at North Beach that you will not like and it is perfect for a first date. It is fancy and elegant and it will not do damage to your wallet. Ask for Giuseppe as your waiter though, I promise you will not regret it.\n\nThey have a bar with a wonderful bartender (name escapes me) that is excellent to frequent. Their drink prices are very reasonable, especially for North Beach. My husband and I spent 3 hours there once!\n\nIf you want to plan a group dinner this is the place!!!! You can reserve the room where they cure the ham or the reserve the wine cellar. It is really incredible.", "author": "Stephanie F."}

The Italian attitude towards dining, particularly dinner, is that the meal is *supposed* to be long! If you know any Italians you'd know that the meals are always a hoot while generally lasting quite a bit longer than you'd have expected.\n\nI've been coming here for about 4 years, semi-regularly, and my opinion of the place is this: they do the generics very well but they are not very adventurous; they stick to the guide. With this being said, the menu is still the traditionally extensive list of choices and although none are particularly unique, they are very delicious and I would comfortably recommend this restaurant to any of my friends for a simple, fun, and delicious dinner.", "author": "Alex T."}

However, it turned into an evening of \"things a restaurant should not do\".\nFirst, when I make a reservation, I do not expect to be seated in the rear, next to the kitchen door - that is where you seat walk-ins on an \"as avaiable\" basis...not folks who were required to leave a credit card to hold the seat (Opentable).  \nSecondly, the waiter should not be condescending at their \"approach\" to the table...not so subtly adjusting the wine list every time he walked by.  If I want wine, I will order it.. if I don't... I don't.  \nFourthly, the wine steward should not...not..in no way.. not even a little bit... mock someone for not ordering wine.  No way... no how.  Not even THINK about it.  While my wife got a glass ($22) of the suggestion, I indicated that I would just be having water.  The steward began to not-so-subtly make fun of me for not having any.  No way. No How.  That should NEVER happen.  Whether is be for religious belief, health concerns or just personal preference... he should never even THINK about even making a subtle comment...and yet he did.\nThe food.. Oh yes... the food was good.  Not worth the price... but pretty good.  \nFifthly, when a patron asks about the meal (you remember the meal..the reason to order the wine), the waiter should either know the answer... or at least go ask the chef.  My wife asked about the cut of lamb on her plate.  The waiter said something to the effect of \"It is a tender cut\".  Well, yes... but WHICH one?  No shame in not knowing.. but go ask.\nLastly.. and certainly not leastly, never take a signed check off of the table until I leave.  Don't even think about it.... and never as this older waiter should have known... ask me to move my hand so that he can take it.  Holy crap... that is Restaurant 101.\nNeedless to say, we won't be going back.", "author": "David D."}

I felt a little under dressed wearing jeans with our server in a tux, but there were ladies next to me in running clothes so I felt better (though I wouldn't recommend running clothes). \n\nOur waiter was one of the best parts about the experience. First, he comes over and instead of asking us what we want, he asks what we are in the mood for so he can recommend something. That's a good waiter. My friend said she wanted meat, and he told her she had to get the duck - not something we would normally order. I knew I was in the mood for Veal Parm so I ordered that. \n\nWe started off with two glasses of wine from the Petroni vineyard - unfortunately not the $20/glass Barbera. We decided to save that for when dad was in town. Then it was time for dinner. The waiter didn't lie about the duck. It was delectable - almost like steak, not what you would expect from duck.

So, I decided to give it a 4 (wanted to extend my appreciation to that server who gave my friend the free wine refill and was attentive to us). Will I come back again? Probably for lunch.

The restaurant was very quiet as it was Labor Day weekend. I mention this because many restaurants fall down on a slow night and oftentimes waiters neglect a solo diner. Not the case here. The food was excellent; do try the pasta bolognese to compare a standard dish. You'll find it correctly done with ground beef, ground veal and ground pork combined. In May 2011 I returned. During a four-day trip to SF, we ate there two nights. The food was still every bit as good.

Then the health code concerns started appearing:\n\n-first, a dog was in the restaurant (not outside on a patio, but indoors), oh and not just sitting on the floor of the restaurant, but up ON THE BAR....yes, the same bar where we were eating. My guess is it wasn't a guide dog....\n\n-next, the bartender is petting the dog and doesn't WASH her hands in between touching the dog and touching peoples' food and drinks. \n\n-then, she served us our appetizer and while she was setting down the plate, she placed her fingers in our dipping sauce! I'm sure it was an accident, but then she walked away as if nothing happened and didn't even REPLACE the sauce (reminder, her fingers had previously been touching the dog).\n\n-lastly (I think this is the last one, although there were so many issues that night you would have thought we were watching Seinfeld), but lastly, the same bartender was also the coffee/cappuccino maker. She was making someone's cappuccino and some of the foam started flowing over the side of the mug. So what does she do? She wipes up the foam with HER FINGER (yes, still dog fingers) and then puts her fingers IN HER MOUTH to lick off the foam! Oh yeah, and even after that she didn't stop to wash her hands!\n\nGood luck to anyone who is brave enough to eat/drink at a place with dog-haired-sauced-up-licked-clean-fingered bartender, but I will never go there again. \n\nI must say I'm glad we sat at the bar; if we had been at a table we never would have seen all of that stuff.\n\nOh, and after all that, the food wasn't even that great.....", "author": "Kate M."}

He certainly won't take time to tell you about any specials that might be available and any suggestions are perfunctory, as easily obtained as extraction of a recalcitrant wisdom tooth.  \n\nFood can range from homey to hopeless.

The pseudo veal had none of the consistency of real meat, but the sauce had the consistency of Elmer's glue all, glop.  \n\nOn my first visit tiramisu was lovely.

The criteria is so subjective and what you get from a restaurant oft times depends on what you expect from it.\n\nNorth Beach Restaurant was not on my short list of eateries to try out.  It is located in a touristy section of North Beach and I am a Haight and Mission kind of guy.  When our out-of-town guest and his girlfriend picked the place, I said \"must be in North Beach.\"  I am my own favorite comedian.\n\nOur guest is a wine snob of some repute.  He has a gazillion dollars and an extensive wine cellar to match.  He picked NBR mostly because of its wine list and he was not disappointed.\n\nHim:  I own a case of the 1946 Chatueu Somtinspecial.\n\nMe:  I own a case of the 2006 Charles Shaw Syrah.\n\nI am not sure what he ordered, but it was a sangiovese of some complexity.  It was monsterously good and it cost much as you might imagine.  \n\nAs for the rest of the place...  I cannot brag too much about the service.  It was a slow evening and the waiter hovered.  He was some ancient Italian man who liked to tell us stupid stories about bad customers of yesteryear.  I kept wondering if the accent was for real.  Do people really talk like that outside of the movies?\n\nThe food came quickly and it was hot, nicely plated and served with a flourish.  There was just so much hyperbole surrounding a simple Ceasar salad and a plate of carbonera.  The Carbonera, a specialty of the house according to the menu, was nothing special.  I have eaten much better meals at much better prices and just down the block.  \n\nMost of the guests were at least business casual and we came in jeans.

This is an authentic  Italian restaurant with a fabulous wine cellar.\n\nFood-4\nAside from the food that my Sicilian mother-in-law makes, the food here is the real deal.  We started with the burrata special ($39 for 2.5 portions).  The kitchen split the portions and served everyone in our party with a personal plate...nice touch.  The creamy cheese was plated with a tomato and a basil leaf.  Simple and delicious.  For mains we ordered the Tagliatelli Bolognese (Pasta w/Meat Sauce $20), Gnocchi Piemontese (Potato pasta w/red sauce $19), Mare Chairo (tube pasta w/shrimp and tomato in a cream sauce $24), Veal Sorrento (Veal w/tomatoes and mozzarella $26), and Veal Parmigiana (Breaded Veal with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and parm cheese $29).  The veal dishes were the highlight.  The meat was tender and not overly breaded, like you typicaly find in an \"American-Italian\" restaurant.  The three pasta dishes were very good, and the pasta was hand-made. The only thing off was the gnocchi.  The sauce tasted jarred.  It probably wasn't, but it needed some help.  For dessert we shared the semifreddo ($8) and 2 cold zabaglione with fresh strawberries ($14.50 each).  Although a little pricey, the zabaglione with strawberries (flavored cream-like mixture with fresh sliced strawberries) was awesome and a must order at North Beach!  The semifreddo tasted like tiramisu and had a strong liquor flavor, which our table enjoyed.\n\nDrinks-5\nThe wine list is fantastic.  We wanted to try something new, and the wine steward offered a great bottle of red ($56).  We were also offered a free sample of their house wine (they own a vineyard) which was a nice touch.  You can get lost in the wine list, so definitely ask for a recommendation.  The team will find a great bottle within your price range.  Full bar also available, and we enjoyed a bourbon (Maker's) after dinner.\n\nService-4\nOur server was attentive and did a great job refilling our wine glasses, checking on us frequently, and making a few jokes.  The thick Italian accent added to the experience.  The only qualm we had was that after we had finished dessert, we sat for a good 20 minutes before our check was given to us.  (My wife actually had to go ask for the bill).  Other than that, top notch.\n\nDecor-3\nThe decor is no frills, but the tables are cozy and the dinning room is flanked with hundreds of wine bottles.  For a special occasion, request the wine cellar.  (We opted for the main dining room).  The bathrooms could use some help.  My wife went to use the restroom before we left, but they were out of toilet paper and the bathroom was a mess.\n\nNorth Beach is a great spot for Italian Cuisine in the city.

But it wasn't a problem since the staff didn't really treat us any different.\n\nWe sit down and peruse the menu over a couple of cocktails. The server comes over and talks about the specials and to see if we want any anti pasta. This is where things go array (Always know the price of something before you order it). We wanted to try their prosciutto so he tells us about their sampler anti pasta that has prosciutto, caprese salad and some type of scampi. So they bring out the anti pasta and I have to say it was amazing. The caprese salad had the ripest red tomatoes and the buffalo mozzarella was delicate and creamy. The prosciutto was salty, tender and easily better than the Boarshead brand I am use too. The scampi was equally fantastic with mini lobster tails and this sauce that I couldn't get enough of. When we were finished, we all thought if the anti pasta was this much food we are never going to finish our entrees. Well we were wrong, the portions were pretty small compared to the appetizer. I had the lasagna which I was a little bit disappointed with. The sauce had a similar flavor to chef Boyardee. So we all finished up and the server dropped off the check to my friend. He looks at us and said in shock, \"it's $580\" (7 people but no wine). I quickly grabbed the check to find the caprese was $55 prosciutto was $55 and the scampi was $115 for a grand total of 225 for an appetizer. I know it's our fault for not asking the price but come on now. You should have a little discretion before you offer that. I will not be coming back unless someone else is paying.

Had called previously about corkage fee if we brought our own wine ($30).  Thought that was high, but we were really disappointed when we saw the cheapest bottle was $90!  Ended up with a bill close to $5,000 (over $2,000 in wine alone).\nAs a follow up to this event my son (17) sent the owner a letter asking for a donation of a gift certificate for an auction for an organization he volunteers for, mentioning my birthday, etc.  Never heard from them.  I followed up with a phone call, was told no way, they get too many requests (they pick 3 charities a year to donate to), I asked for a token donation ($25 gift cert) (hey, it gets folks in the door to spend a heck of a lot more) and he hung up on me.

Promptly seated and attended to.  Then the wheels fell off.  Our waiter was a crusty veteran who exuded an air of \"don't bother me\".  I perused the wine list and found the pricing by bottle outrageous; at least three times retail.  Smacks of \"if you are so stupid to pay these prices, we'll sell it to you\". Wines by the glass a joke; limited selection and quality.  My wife, being very selective and direct about her desire for a nice thick layered lasagna was given short shrift by Mr. Gruff.  Sure enough, the lasagna arrived appearing as a deck of playing cards like a Jenny Craig diet meal. At that point my wife was upset and did not want to eat anything else.  I had spaghetti carbonara which was quite good, only after I was informed there was \"no way\" they would substitute pasta for potatoes on their lamb entree.  Insurmountable task for an Italian restaurant I guess.  Summary: Expensive, snotty waiter, overpriced wine and food.\n\n8-21-10.  Returned for another try after yet another recommendation from our concierge, a completely different experience.  The prior waiter is no longer working there (my wife let her feelings known to our host when we arrived). We had a really great meal.  New York steak for my son was perfect, veal special for me topped with chopped asparagus and mushrooms, tender and delicious, linguine and clams for my wife.  All topped off by the owner's killer \"Brunello de Sonoma\" 2004 wine.  $22.00 a glass, an outstanding wine and surprising such a high quality wine by the glass.  Very clean and excellent service this time.", "author": "Mr. Helper L."}

We were offered and accepted \"family style\" appetizers without being given the price....BIG mistake.  To us \"family style\" meant sharing a few large appetizers in the middle of the table for a reasonable price.  Instead, they served each person a small serving of their most expensive dishes and it cost each person more than the priciest entree.  When we discovered this on the bill at the end of the night, despite our outrage (and nearly $3000 bill for 30 of us) they would not budge on the price.\n\nA few weeks later I was telling a friend about this terrible restaurant and he had just been ripped off there himself.  He, his girlfriend and their parents had accepted the \"house wine\" without being told that the house wine is $90 per bottle.  In every other restaurant, the house wine is either the cheapest wine or at least a good value.  Again they would not budge on the price.\n\nI have no problem for paying for what I order, however, I believe that they systematically attempt to deceive you in order to make you pay much more than is reasonable.  This restaurant has cheated money from me and many of my friends on multiple occasions.  I strongly recommend that everyone avoid this extremely deceptive and dishonest restaurant.", "author": "Steve H."}

The drinks were good and the somollier was great about serving us. We never had to go up to the bar to order our drinks. There was some antipasta and calamari which was okay. Not enough of it though. We had to wait quite awhle for the first course. \nThe first course came and it was just a plain salad, with a little tomato on the side, and we had no choice of dressing (?) I don't know how this worked. We usually have a menu we pick from before hand and then tell the restaurant what we will be having. We should have had a choice of soup or salad.\nThe next course was the pesto pasta. Although it was good, on our plates was about only six of them. That was kinda cheap. I ordered the fish which was really good. The potatoes were kinda dry and salty. (I see a pattern here from a previous post about salty foods). There were other dishes which everybody seemed to enjoy. \nThe dessert was good too. In true Itallian fashion there was the Tiramisu, and other things like chocolate and cheese cake.

We had our own private room in the basement (the cigar room I believe).  They also have a fancy wine room and the prosciutto room with hams  HANGING from the ceiling.  They didn't require us to sign a contract or set a limited menu.  They also helped us with a great appetizer and dessert tray that was much easier to deal with than figuring out between 20 people what each person wanted to eat.  The food was great too.  I had \"salmon my way\" and it was, quite simply, my way.  I guess if you order it, then it would be salmon your way too, not salmon Caitlin's way, but it made me feel special anyway.

I have been to this place numerous times while in San Francisco, and without question it is my mom's and my favorite restaurant in the city.  To start off with the bread is  fabulous, and I think a restaurant's bread is a preview to the rest of the meal. If they have good bread, it's going to be a good meal; however, if the bread is not the best, the meal will be mediocre.  To start I get the polenta soup, which is to die for delicious!  I love polenta, and this is the only place I've ever known of that has transformed polenta into a soup.  Then I always get one of their amazing pastas for my main course.  All of their pastas are wonderful, but my favorite is definitely the Gnocchi. \nMy mom gets the chicken livers, and absolutely loves them.

That's the problem with most restaurants in north beach, they rely on tourists and the money they'll spend on any gruel you put in front of them. So when the owner of the restaurant has made making a buck off tourists their top priority, you get restaurants like North Beach Restaurant. Be warned.\n\nSo that being said, onto the meal! Lets start with the soup. Minestrone. So don't forget that you're paying top dollar for this crap and what North Beach Restaurant gives you is...Minestrone. Thanks. Who cares how it taste, it's minestrone and you're spending like $50 a head to eat here. But  if you need to know,  it's a salty mess. Prosciutto and carpaccio is up next. Completely void of taste and not coincidently, the highlight of the meal. That's also their specialty so that makes North Beach Restaurant super lame! Then we had the caprese with \"burratta\".

A totally rubbery piece of braised, mutant flesh in the most oddly textured sauce I've ever come across in my life. You could almost pick the sauce up with your fingers. Like it wasn't quite a liquid but not quite a solid either. It was school paste dude. Veal shank braised in school paste for $30. Accompanying my shank-in-paste was a cube of broccolini.

I went with four friends. When it came time to order a bottle of wine, we were going to order a bottle that cost $38, but, instead, we asked it they had a house wine. Now in all of our restauurant experiences, \"house wine\" is usually cheaper than the other wines offered. The waiter failed to tell us that the Chardonnay house wine would be $55/bottle. When we received the bill, we were surprised to find we had spent $17 more for the house wine. After leaving the restaurant, we were discussing this, and two of us decided to return and talk to someone about it. The man we spoke to said for this restaurant, \"house wine\" is the wine they serve by the glass, and it's $55/bottle. He said he was so sorry the waiter had failed to tell us this. However, after reading other reviewers' comments who have had similar problems with the wine served, I don't think he was sorry. In fact, I feel this restaurant intentionally and underhandedly omitted telling us that, in fact, the \"house wine\" would be more expensive. The words \"North Beach\" bring back many childhood memories to me. I'm a third generation San Franciscan with parents and grandparents who grew up in North Beach. Now as a senior (67 yrs. old), I chose to have lunch at North Beach Restaurant with four friends who are also SF natives. Some in the group have known each other 60 years. I am appalled at the deceitful way this restaurant handled the choice of wine, and I am sorry \"North Beach\" is part of your restaurant's name. I will never eat at NBR again. There are too many other wonderful choices of restaurants in North Beach whose staffs and policies show more integrity.", "author": "B M."}

We had walked by it in the morning on the way to eat breakfast so we looked at the dinner menu and decided to try it out.  I had the mare chiaro (shrimp, tomato, cream sauce over rigatoni pasta) which is very good.  It was $24.00 and I was able to eat the whole thing so you know that portions are somewhat small.  Expect to pay more for what you get but it is good and I did like the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Obviously their rent is VERY HIGH so they have to charge a lot for their food.  It was a little crowded (for a cold Thursday night) so you're sitting really close to other patrons so it was a little louder than other restaurants.  We still enjoyed our meal.  I had the VERY BEST date that night and I was very impressed with the choice of place for dinner that night.  Well done, Babe!  The service was very good.  I definitely recommend coming here at least once to experience great Italian food.  After all, I found my true love in this city, the food was my second love.", "author": "Sylvia W."}

The day before the parade our friends cancelled so I called the restaurant to change our seating to 3.  We arrived Sunday by 10:30am as I was instructed to do but now there were only two of us. I let the Maitre d' know this and he changed to 2 (I saw him write it too).  We waited over an hour to be seated in front with full view of the parade..however they did put us in the crosswalk way so had to deal with people bumping our chairs and blocking our view all day.  They also sat another person at our table which was just fine. She was a very nice lady.  She ordered a Chardonnay 3 times before she finally got it an hour later.  We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio which came quickly but sat in the sun for over an hour with no ice bucket .. which was promised to us each time a waiter came to our table.  It did finally come when there was only one glass left in the bottle.  We ordered our food. I ordered a Caprese Salad first.  When the salad came they gave each one of us one...I only ordered the one for me not for the table.  DUH! Then the waiter was quite rude about it when I told him I didn't order it.. He said 'you were supposed to be a table of 5'. I tried several times to tell him that reservation was changed and the Matre d' knew that we were only two and that we didn't even know the lady at our table. They refused to bill her separately too.  WHAT?  We ended up having her tab on our bill and had to figure it out for her to pay us.  That's just ridiculous.  They also charged us for two Caprese salads not 3 as delivered...that was wrong...we should only have paid for one since that is what I ordered...one for me!  They also did not come to our table very often and we had to wave each time to find someone to help us.  They had 4-5 waiters on all the tables outside and our waiter, when we did get his attention, kept making it a point to tell us 'how busy he was and they were'.  WHAT?  He again was rude but thought he was funny..NOT! I had to bite my tongue and get through our overpriced lunch so we could leave.  This event happens every year...either you need more staffing during the parade or you limit the customer seating, so your staff you do have, can do their job and BE POLITE!  I will not be eating at this restaurant again and will make sure I do not recommend it to my friends or family.  Next year I'll make sure to get a table at a different restaurant and hopefully they will know how to treat a paying customer no matter their status.  NB Restaurant staff was definitely running around and catering to their longtime wealthy customers and kept us waiting! I tried to get my husband to leave only a 10% tip for the service..but I am sure he didn't do that.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT unless you care to be treated like poor trash!

I was ok in my hoodie sweater b/c my friend was dressed nice enough for the both of us. I guess b/c there was a lot of date action going on there and not too many groups. Anyway, the greeter was fantastico! He set the mood for an awesome time. However, our waiter had a different type of experience in mind. He was a tad impatient and rushed. For instance, he even got kinda pissy when my friend didn't like the wine he was served. The waiter got him another wine but not without huffing off in discontent. Not the experience we were looking for at this joint. I would expect this behavior from a chain like Chili's or Applebee's. And there was no reason for it either, it wasn't busy -- it was a Tuesday night. Moving on, I ordered the (homeade) Ravioli Tuscana. It was ok. The pasta was cooked perfectly but it was wayyyy too salty for me. I think it was salty enough to give the entire state of CA high blood pressure.

The waitstaff was actually very friendly, (in spite of my Uggs!)

We went for a birthday dinner for 16 people and sat in the basement in the 'cigar room.' No ambiance. There was a box of cigars in the room which I guess made it a 'cigar room' which was located off of a room with prosciutto hanging from the ceiling. My husband and I were early and ordered a bottle of wine and told the waiter it was for the 2 of us. As more people arrived the waiter opened another bottle of wine WITHOUT ASKING US and offered it to the guests. My husband immediately put a stop to this. We really should have told the manager but did not want to cause a scene at the party. During dinner the same thing happened when another member of the party ordered a bottle of wine except this time the waiter opened SIX BOTTLES of wine WITHOUT ASKING us.

We live within walking distance and this is our second time to eat here.  There are so many menu options and each dish is delectable!  We *LOVE* their veal dishes and I have ordered the Veal Picatta twice now!  My husband orders the chef's specialty- Veal Saltimbocca and it's AWESOME.  We've also ordered one of the pasta dishes which was wonderful and you have plenty of options of all kinds of food here- chicken, pasta, veal, beef, etc.  Their wine list is extensive and highly rated.  Both of Italian reds we've had were great picks for $30-$40/ bottle.  Service is always great and professional.  If you are looking for a great Italian restaurant to take out-of-towners to, this is great choice. Or if you just want great Italian food you won't be let down!  The atmosphere is pretty lively but not too noisy.  We were lucky the last time we went, on a Saturday night, to sit in the wine cellar below and that is a great spot to sit, surrounded by wooden walls full of yummy wine in a truly unique wine cellar room.  This would also be a good spot for group dinners or a birthday dinner, as I noticed many parties eating with 6+ people.  The ONE thing I would *definitely* recommend is reservations on www.opentable.com or by calling restaurant directly.  They are always extremely busy and the wait can easily be 45mins+ on a weekend night.  If you haven't made a reservation, call ahead and ask them to put you on the list if possible.  They are usually pretty accommodating if they have some tables open.  Bone Appetit!", "author": "JR W."}

I took a group of my guys to a nice dinner and basically left feeling as though I had been ROBBED.  I will give you some examples, I ordered a mixed plate of Serrano ham and beef Carpaccio for the table at $16 and received four small slices of ham and about 6 piece of Carpaccio, we also ordered a tomato plate for 11 dollars which had three slices of tomato with a couple of anchovies laying across them with a bit of cheese.  So at that point I was feeling a little non plussed with the appetizers.  My main course was meant to be a heart fish stew Ciopinno, and when it arrived at close to thirty dollars I was disgusted.  It came in this tiny bowl and consisted of 1 mussel 1 clam and three pieces of flaky white fish all covered in what could only be described as about 1 cup of marinara sauce and not a crab leg in site.  I really like Ciopinno and have it at numerous restaurants, the best I have had is at the Dead Fish Restaurant in Crocket CA.  In comparison it is full of Mussels, Clams Crayfish Crab and mountains of Flaky white fish all in a delicious bowl of Marinara which is fantastic to mop up with as much bread as you would like.  But as the dish is described it is an extremely Hearty fish stew.  As for what I received in the North Beach restaurant, I would be embarrassed to serve that to anyone, 1 mussel, 1 clam and three pieces of white fish in Marinara Sauce and they want to call it a hearty fish stew............pathetic.  Our meal with drinks was close to $100 per head and that is without wine, my suggestion to anyone who is thinking about trying this restaurant for the first time would be don't.  Keep your money in your pocket and go somewhere else, in fact spend $100 in a cab and go to the restaurant in Crocket where you can have a delicious Ciopinno and feel as though you have great value and terrific service even with $100 cab fare added to your bill.", "author": "Nick M."}

The exterior looked nice, the service was friendly all until it became clear we had just dropped by for lunch.  Just lunch.  Not a rafter of appetizers, not a bottle from the owner's winery...  just a few bowls of pasta and a few glasses of red wine.   Then the air changed.  We were, suddenly, annoying.  At the time I had a health condition that made it actually dangerous for me to eat fat -- I asked the waiter which item on the menu had the least fat.  He directed me to the veal, which I really doubt was leanest thing they had.  I ended up ordering the \"Lorenzo Pasta\" which the menu said was about 300 calories.  Brusqueness ensued.  It started to feel like we were being treated like tourist.  I had this image of waiters high fiving each other in the kitchen when they ring up a big sale.  Maybe ringing a bell when they sell a bottle of the family wine.  (Cappuccino is, after all, for closers.)  On the way home I started having an attack, which made me think the pasta wasn't as healthy as the menu suggests.  People's dietary issues can be serious.  The people who want to make really sure there are no peanuts in their food have a reason.  Sometimes people who ask a lot of questions about fat or sugar aren't just silly dieters who don't know how to live.
