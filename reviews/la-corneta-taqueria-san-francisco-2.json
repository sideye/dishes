There was one cashier and three order takers. Clearly seeing the long line, the order takers continued to move at a normal, slow pace--without any hint of urgency. After 10 minutes, the line began moving a little faster. I noticed the manager (I presume the owner; who returned from somewhere) had stepped-in, began taking orders, and really taking charge. Suddenly, the order takers started working more quickly. \n\nMy point in this post, the workers began working faster ONLY when the manager appeared. None of them demonstrated initiative to speed-up the pace, even after seeing the long line grow. \n\nIf the manager hadn't showed-up, I probably would have waited 20-25 minutes for two burritos.

After walking by a few times and not bothering to wait in line, I finally found the time to wait in line on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm. The line moves relatively briskly, which is great, but it's still kinda a pain. \n\nI chose to get the salmon burrito here, since I don't feel like I see fish options at many burrito places. The salmon for my burrito was freshly cooked, which is a plus for sure. However, it does mean that you wait a bit longer for it. If you want to just get in and get out, probably don't get a fish burrito. The burrito itself was just fine. The flavor was good, but it was wrapped a bit poorly. You get chips and salsa, but the salsa isn't anything special at all, unfortunately. I got the hot salsa and it wasn't even hot. :(\n\nI think La Corneta would be a solid 4 if they weren't cash only. But without, they're just an overpriced, overhyped yet average in flavor taqueria. I'm sure it helps that they're the only taqueria in all of the Glen Park \"downtown\" area, but I probably don't really recommend it. If you're out here, you're basically across the street from Glen Park BART, so you should just take the Glen Park BART to 24th Street/Mission and get El Farolito or something.", "author": "Brian W."}

It's been a mixed bag but overall usually good. At this point (April 2018) the cross contamination issue has gotten worse than all previous times. \n\nThe guacamole used to just have a few sprinkles of cheese & sour cream but today they were SWIMMING in it. Since I love guacamole but I am lactose intolerant it's a frustrating situation. When I tried to explain this to my burrito-maker she seemed to think I was more concerned about being charged for unwanted cheese/sour cream rather than actually ingesting those animal products. Furthermore, when she showed signs of understanding my concern of cross contamination (she scooped the dairy off to the side of the guac bin) she proceeded to leave said dairy spoon resting on the guac. Only a few seconds later and another burrito-maker grabbed that spoon and scooped someone else a heap of dairy guac, unbeknownst to all but me and another customer that witnessed this and shared glances.\n\nIt's sad. The food is good and has so much going for it but I can't bring certain people here because of the ongoing cross contamination issue. Please, business owner, do yourself and your pocketbook a favor and go grad a burrito at Chipotle or Gordos and watch how the pros avoid cross contamination. They both have one burrito-maker per STATION and NOT PER CUSTOMER which helps move the line faster and keep things orderly. Also watch how clean, and well separated the bins are. How well trained the employees are on cross contamination. You can do better and this review is my attempt to raise your awareness to this issue as trying with your employees is futile.\n\nI will gladly change my review if you change your behavior here.

Everything was so good, I asked where they got it from. La Corneta was the answer. I made a mental note, but since I don't go to Glen Park often...I nearly forgot about it.\n\nFast forward to current times. I wanted to have a post-season awards banquet for the high school wrestling team I coach...and I wanted it catered. I tend to gravitate towards Mexican food...so \"La Corneta\" flashed in my mind. I called them up a week out to get a handle on things. They were very helpful and friendly. So far; so good.\n\nEven though it was pouring rain, and I know they were busy last Friday evening... they delivered everything on time.  The food did not disappoint. The first thing I always taste at a Mexican place is the rice and beans. Those should be good enough to be a meal by themselves. If they aren't nailed...anything else the place has probably won't be either. Their rice was spot on: perfect texture and flavoring. The beans were just as yummy. OK, so now we're in business.\n\nI ordered buffet food for 35. Carne aside and carnitas for the meats; refried and pinto beans for the beans; vegetables; and a rice, Everything was great. The carne asada and carnitas were tasty and cooked properly. As I said, they had me at the rice. It was as good as mi suegra's....which is not easy to do.\n\nI know very well La Corneta is no secret to the folk living in Glen Park...but most out in my neck of the woods (Outer Sunset, where the Mexican food is awful) have not heard of it.

The carne asada is dry, tough and mostly flavorless - I never order it anymore because it's always a disappointment. The grilled chicken always tastes burnt and bitter. The saucy meats have dry meat and watery sauce so it's the worst of both worlds. The carnitas is dry, flavorless and really fatty (that sounds oxymoronic, I know, but it's true). The meat that they refer to as \"barbecued pork\" (it might be Pibil) is the most pleasant meat option.  \n\nThe chile rellenos are pretty good.  The grilled shrimp are pretty good too when they cook them properly (99% of the time they're raw or overlooked).

It gets awkward when you order multiple items as you will be going back and forth re-starting for each item. Plus you will skip over other people who are still doing their order dance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-14", "description": "La Corneta has been one of the most, if not the most, consistently returned to taqueria in San Francisco since I moved here in 2009. Initially I think this was due to relative proximity to where I lived, even though there were 10 other taquerias between my front door and La Corneta, and then it was its proximity to the glen park Bart station, but now, when all is said and done, it's their perfect grilled chicken.  \n\nLa Corneta utilizes the assembly line style of Mexican food prep, invented in the mission district in the 1970's and popularized by Chipotle, which is also gaining steam with the rising trend of Poke shops. This is an awesome way to get a burrito or taco made so you can specify or see exactly what goes in it, and choose from different beans, rices, etc. While I love the ability to customize in the flesh, my favorite thing to order here involves little to no dictation - the quesadilla suiza with chicken. \n\nPerfectly charred and seasoned chicken collides with a generous amount of melty white (jack?) cheese and a freshly crisped tortilla that is simply divine. Typically it comes with your choice of hot or mild pico but I always get that on the side with my chips because I feel it makes the experience too et and soggy. I have yet to have a better quesadilla anywhere in the Bay Area that balances flavor, juiceyness, and freshness without being insanely greasy. It's hard to use such a big amount of cheese without giving the customer an oil slick in their mouth and somehow La Corneta achieves this feat. Also worth noting is the insanely delicious quality of their shrimp. Although pricey, if you have never had a shrimp burrito this is the place to get it. All the shrimp is cooked to order until just barely translucent and served to tender perfection. \n\nPro tip: they offer \"baby burritos\" which come in a slightly smaller tortilla with smaller portions for a couple dollars less, which is awesome because it's still almost too much food to handle in one sitting.", "author": "Sean S."}

I would have much preferred something else but this had to do for now.\n\nIt's not so much that La Corneta isn't good...it's that its quality is so hit and miss that it's just hard to choose it time and time again. Case in point, I opted to have a super baby burrito with carnitas, black beans, and all the fixings. As she filled my burrito, she would hit the spoon on the wrapper...which meant that later, as I was unwrapping my burrito, it had all kinds of little tears along the way which meant juices everywhere! Usually a good thing, but not so much if you have to continue to be human the rest of the day. After a few hand washes, my hands still emitted a fruity flavor with a Mexican flavor undertone. \n\nThe burrito did fill me up though. And they also provide complementary chips, which weren't stale this time! But my salsa was super flavorless...so sad.

He is a fan. She... not so much. I am somewhere in the middle. This 3.5 rating reflects all of our experiences.\n\nHe thinks it's worth 4 stars because of the size of the burritos. They're pretty massive. They're not the cheapest I've ever come across but when in San Francisco, expect to pay over market for burritos -- even at neighborhood taquerias. The employees are very friendly and everyone was engaged with our visit -- despite the place being packed. LCT employs the Chipotle/Subway conveyor belt method of putting together your food. Keep an eye on it or it just might magically appear at the cash register, ready for your eating. Chips & salsa come with each burrito and are complimentary.\n\nShe thinks it's worth 3 stars because the taste is somewhat bland. Mexican food is known for a spice profile and, unless you drown your burrito with their hot salsa, you might just receive a big tube of edible - but not exciting - food. It's cash only so be mindful of your order. I saw some patrons take advantage of the ATM across the street. I tried to be a hero and pay for all three burritos. I almost had to take to street walking to afford the cash transaction.\n\nI think it's worth 3.5 stars because both of them have valid points. My super chicken burrito (so named for the beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and guac that comes with) was decent but not extraordinary. The rice was that slightly crunchy type that you'd never want to eat on its own but gives texture and added depth to burritos. I asked for no sour cream (part of the 'super' designation) and received mouthfuls of the white nastiness as I neared the end of my burrito. My mild salsa paired nicely with my meal but the chips were a touch stale. LCT won't be the best Mexican you'll ever have, but it's more than passable. 3.5 is a fair number on which we can all agree.

La Corneta to the rescue. The staff here do a great job of serving up fresh, quality food with a smile. My usual go to is the fish taco with black beans and a chicken taco (either mole, tomato, or verde) with pinto beans and onion/cilantro. No need to smoother the tacos in dairy with the \"super\" order of cheese, sour cream, etc. Instead just opt for the cheaper \"regular\" order and let the flavors and spices of the meat and beans vouch for themself. Each order comes with chips and an assortment of salsa, with the non-spiced pico de gallo being my personal favorite at the moment. And there's even a small beer with draft beers and liquor if the Mexican-mixology bug craves. My only complaint is if you pay for extra avocado, they give you smidgen. I complained once and the owner asked me if I knew how much avocados cost? I was a little disappointed with his question to my question, and in my research I saw that avos sold for a mere 99 cents a few doors down-- so I was getting about 15 cents worth of avo for my $1.50 extra payment.

I've been here before, nothing stands out much since it is your typical \"gentrified\" type of Mexican food that you just settle for. Why? Because nothing around is authentic enough to be called good Mexican cuisine! On this night though a party of four walked in their doors and I was at the forefront of the squad. When I walked in a Caucasian man and his daughter got up and cut in front to order. I let them by, no reason to get worked up and I start to look at their menu. I wasn't done reading when I could hear the \"angry\" lady screaming NEXT!..... NEXT.... NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!

She gets mad and starts to say what else, okay but what else, ok but what else....????? Jesus, she wasn't letting me talk and I was trying so hard to just be clear and concise with the hood rat chick! To top it off she threw the food around like she was slamming it on the counter, she cross contaminated the food (accidentally adding meat or beans to the wrong order). She ended up making an extra burrito because of course she wasn't listening! I said four!!!! Four burritos please.... And what the ghetto child in me wanted to say, was 4 f****** burritos bi***!!! Because by then the women boundary crossed and quite frankly -----broken. How dare you be so disrespectful like that especially in front of my offspring I thought. But the part of me who has gone through a whole load of schooling just remained calm. I let the man I was with deal with her. She softened her tone after he pointed out that she had made an extra burrito. He  I said to her, you know you made an extra burrito right? I mean I think that is what she (me) was trying to tell you but you aren't listening he told her. She finished making the food and I paid and handed the cashier my business card.

I got chips and salsa too but I didn't really want them. Portions are big. I would definitely ask them to put less chicken in them next time ... LOL I know funny right?

The super tacos on the other hand are around three stars for me. I've had tacos from many local Mexican restaurants, but never have I ever been served a taco I couldn't pick up; let alone hold. \n\nI'm sure some people love all of the ingredients, but they're so enormous that it completely defeats the purpose of the taco, as you won't be able to eat it without a fork and spoon. If you're craving normal small street tacos, probably not the best place as single tacos are pretty expensive here.

Down side 1) they limit the chips and salsa they give you only 1 cup of either hot or mild sauce with a small side of chips. 2) it says CASH ONLY but I saw someone pay with a card. (the worker took it out from the side where it was hiding). Not sure why they would do that it sure limited us since we didn't have much cash on us and we wanted to visit the bar.

We are vegetarian and ended up ordering the super burrito with tofu, the chile relleno burrito, and a mushroom quesadilla.\n\nOverall, we thought the tofu burrito was good, and liked the rice in the burrito, but prefer the tofu offering at Papalote (which is grilled and has a better texture and flavor). The chile relleno had some phenomenal cheesy bites with a mild chile flavor, but it was rather uneven through the burrito. The mushroom quesadilla was appropriately cheesy, but dripped with oil and mushroom juice, as they fry the mushrooms right then and there (and not for enough time to allow the mushrooms to lose all their liquid). One of us loved the thin crispy tortilla chips they gave with the order but both of us agree that the salsa offerings were not particularly exciting.\n\nWould we be back?

I knew La Corneta was on the way to the 280, so I decided to stop and indulge my whim.\n\nLet's talk about parking in Glen Park.  First of all, sweet Jesus.  Second of all, even on the weekend, the BART parking lot is CHOCK FULL.  I circled the block so many times I ended up with a mild case of vertigo.  Finally, I was able to secure parking by noticing a parking space whose parking meter was partially blocked by shrubbery on Bosworth.  I paid something like $2.00 in quarters for a half an hour, which I (mistakenly) figured would be sufficient.  \n\nI walked up the hill a block and entered LC.  I was surprised to find an incredibly long line winding all the way around the back of the restaurant.  Normally, in this situation, I would just peace out and call it a day--I'm not the biggest fan of waiting--but I had just went through a great deal of trouble to procure parking, so I was committed.  When it was finally my turn, which was definitely 15+ minutes post-entry, I asked for a Super Shrimp Burrito, no beans, no lettuce, with guacamole on the side.  So, I know this is not the best order--but the heart wants what the heart wants.  I don't like lettuce in the middle of hot food, and sometimes beans make a burrito too heavy, or I'm simply just not in the mood.  I asked for guacamole on the side because I typically cannot eat a whole burrito in one sitting, and I don't like reheating a burrito with guacamole inside of it.  It turns brown and gross.  \n\nWhen I went to pay for my burrito, I liked that the cashier called me mejita, because I was in the mood to be called mejita.  I became very confused about my salsa options, and please correct me if I'm mistaken, but there is no DIY salsa bar at this location.  Finally, I just started asking for ones that I thought looked good.  The cashier obliged.  \n\nWhen I left and returned to my car, the 30 minute time limit had long expired.  I didn't get a ticket, but this should illustrate that the process of getting a burrito at LC in Glen Park was a lengthy one.  I won't bore you with the details of how I proceeded to get on the wrong freeway right afterwards, which also took about a frakking month to rectify, but I forgot that I wasn't going to work--force of habit.  \n\nI was sad that when I got home the guacamole was missing.  I was looking forward to dipping the chips in it.  That's okay though, because I don't really *need the chips.  The burrito was pretty tasty, although the distribution of the burrito ingredients could use some work--I didn't like that the lion's share of the sour cream was at the bottom of the burrito.

You have two corn tortillas with meat, topped with cilantro and onion; lime and salsa on the side from the salsa bar. \n\nSo naturally when I was asked to customize my tacos I was shaking my head in worry. I asked for the beans on the side and refused to put any cheese. C'mon, beans and cheese are for burritos, not tacos. I ordered one shrimp taco and one al pastor taco. The shrimp was amazing! Plump and juicy, the shrimp was cooked to perfection. I did not care for the al pastor. It was too sweet and made my taco soggy. \n\nOn my previous trips I've had the salmon salad and the beef taco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-19", "description": "Note: Sorry for the long review again. I ended up rambling about my disappointment for a place which I was very excited to try. \n\nI love Mexican food, so it really pains me when I have to give this place a bad review. La Corneta Taqueria came highly rated by one of my most picky friends. I will continue to use five categories to review this restaurant. Location, Service, Presentation, Taste, Price and then give my final verdict. \n\nLocation: This restaurant is located in Glen Park right by the Bart station. A few friends and I went to La Corneta Taqueria on a Saturday for lunch. The area seemed very vibrant. There were a lot of people walking around, which should be the case for a Saturday. Parking was easily assessable and though the taqueria is cash only, there is a Bank of America right next to it. Overall, no complaints on the location. If you don't like driving up to the city, you can catch Bart and walk a block and a half. \n\nService: As soon as we walked into the tacqueria, you could see a cook grilling meat and it smelled delicious. I was very excited for the food as soon as we walked in. The ladies making the food as you ordered seemed nice too, but I would have preferred if they gave me an extra few seconds to take a look at that extensive menu. The menu board had lots of choices and for someone who loves Mexican food... I wanted it all. This is a sit down place where someone comes by to clean up the tables. My one complaint is that the bus boy who was cleaning the tables did not wait for us to completely finish our food. The place was not even busy with people who were sitting down. He should not have rushed us like that. He also touched my drink, which I had only drank half way. I do not think that was polite.  \n\nPresentation: I ordered an al pastor burrito and the choice came back to haunt me. A back story to this, I originally ordered a carne asada burrito, but my friend got the carne asada nachos and asked me to share, so I figured I could try my two favorite two kinds of Mexican cuisine meats by getting the pastor, but... after I ordered my burrito, my friend changed the nachos to carnitas nachos, which was also a bad idea. The burrito was made well by the woman. She loaded the burrito with pastor, rice, black beans, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, and pico de gallo. The burrito was wrapped in two layers of tin foil and nothing spilled out as I ate it. Overall, well made burrito. No complaints on the preparation. \n\nTaste: Here is where most of the stars are taken away from the tacqueria. I was very disappointed in the taste of the food. The pastor had no taste to it. It seemed like carnitas which were chopped. I had to drench my burrito in their delicious green (tomatillo) salsa, which I must say was probably the best tasting thing I had there. I did not enjoy my burrito at all and finished it because I was very hungry and it was the first meal of the day for me. I don't even have many more words for the taste of the food other than it was bad. I really wish I had ordered the carne asada to judge because it seemed good when we walked in. If you take anything from this review, just don't make the mistake of ordering the pastor or carnitas. Get the carne asada. Overall, not very tasty burrito. Meat was not flavorful. I was disappointed and now I feel sad because I had to think about the burrito. \n\nPrice: Pastor Super burrito was about nine dollars. In total, we ordered a carne asada super burrito (which I should have asked to take a bite of), a pastor super burrito, carnitas super nachos, and two large horchatas (which was just decent, nothing special). The total was $31.49, which is not bad for three people. \n\nFinal verdict: With so much anticipation and hope for this place which was described as amazing, I left very disappointed. I was full, but the food I ate did not satisfy my craving and love for Mexican food. I am sad to say that I will not be going back, even to try their carne asada. This is because there are an abundance of tacquerias which serve amazing Mexican food and the food at this tacqueria did not taste great. Why go out of the way to Glen Park for Mexican food?", "author": "Victor T."}

But about 5 years ago something happened that made me not eat there again.\n\nIt was close to closing, and mine was one of the last quesadillas on the griddle. A guy started cleaning up before my food was cooked, which meant wiping down the interior of the hood with a wet cloth, hopefully not with chemicals on it. This is a HUGE health code violation. Even if it had been just water, he wiped down the inside of the hood and made it so wet that a large ball of brown greasiness formed and *dripped right into my quesadilla* on top of the cheese. I was appalled, and the chef completely missed it, so I turned around and left disgusted. What else goes on there if that hideousness is in plain view?\n\nSkip forward 5 years to just now, when I decided to grab a burrito there. The guy in front of me ordered 5 burritos, and a different girl came to service me. He got his 5 burritos before I got my one. In fact I didn't get my one, because *the same girl* who took my order looked blank when I asked her where my burrito was, and she said, \"Did you already order one?\"\n\n\"Yeah, from YOU!\" the guy next to me said, and thank you sir for stepping in and saving me from terminal dumbfoundedness.\n\nAdd this to the overall stinginess of the dole -- I often get prawn burritos and they count each one, and there's always too few -- these are prawns people, not gold doubloons -- and the tightwad salsa -- it's all over the tables for free, as much as you want, but if you want a bit more than the tiny Solo cups they give you to go the cashier looks at you like she's some kind of Leprechaun and you're trying to steal her Lucky Charms.\n\nSo I left, again, and this time I won't ever bother going back.", "author": "Rob C."}

We were having a get together so we used online ordering to get 6 burritos, a quesadilla, and a tostada, guac, and drinks.  They only got 1 of the items correct.  When I went to pick up the order, it was flat out missing 2 burritos.   They also gave us a 1/2 pint instead of a full pint, and was missing a drink.  So I waited for them to be made and swap the guac, etc. The line was long (at least 15 people at 7pm) so I chalked it up to them being busy.  When we started eating we realized the remaining burritos they all had basic issues e.g. the wrong meat, didn't get a \"super\" version even though it was paid for, etc. There isn't really a way to check the correctness of a burrito without opening it up so I didn't know until we started eating.  So even though I added a hefty tip on the online order, they still messed everything up.  They'll probably do better with smaller orders but chances are if you customize things they'll still get it wrong.\n\nIronically even though they do online ordering that's the only part that's high tech.  What they do it look up your order on an ipad Mini then write it on a napkin (literally a napkin) then make your order off that.  Since we had a big order I assumed they didn't bother writing down the details e.g. type of meat, etc.  They didn't even bother checking off what they did which is probably why they flat out missed 2 burritos and a drink.  Oh, and although you can use credit cards when buying online it's cash only at the store.\n\nAs for the taste it was very bland.  Perhaps it was because I was expecting al pastor and only got carnitas.  It was also very mushy.  So even if everything else went perfectly above the food was still not good.

While the prices are relatively high for tacos, they are mostly made up for by the portions. The food is done assembly line style and can therefore move a bit slowly. I thought the cochinita pibil was just average, but the carne asada had nice flavor and deserves your attention. The salsa was pretty bland too and the tacos fell apart. This would be convenient if I lived in the area, but it's pretty generic Mexican food and is not really worth going out of your way for.", "author": "Teddy E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-26", "description": "Wow! Can't believe my disappointment. It's now officially time to leave the city for good, substantial, economical eats. This place has been turned into your neighborhood chipotle. But before I explain further, please allow me to first reminisce. Back in the day, there was a taqueria on mission st, run by an ambitious young entrepreneur, serving good, tasty, authentic Mexican food, to a mostly local mission district clientele. Understandably, the place  became popular. The keyword was fresh. Authentic, flavorful, but fresh. No lardy type aftertaste. So, she opened another one in the Glen Park area. Now here is where some history comes into the picture. Glen Park at that time, way before the word \"hipster\" was even invented, much less there being actual hipsters around, was a middle/working class area, so obviously the same formula as the one on mission street, also worked there, and that place also became popular, serving great, authentic, burritos to a mixed hispanic and other clientele. Now here's where it becomes personal, because after eating there countless times, and also bringing food home, (my late mom's fav burritos,  and that senora knew her burritos!,) And years later, picking up food with Winnie for our then yung uns, I eventually ckecked out for a couple of years, (never mind why, long story, worked late nights at the club, schedule changed....) So you can imagine my surprise when I finally dropped in last week after all these years. What changed? Omg, everything. \"super burrito's\" much thinner, smaller, and more expensive, (probably the result of countless noe valley hippie moms remarking \"oh, I can't eat all that! This much food is obscene!\") the great flavorful substantial taste of old is virtually non existent now, replaced with a thin watery, no taste, \"fresh vegetabley\" flavored water. (Don't get me wrong, I love dem veggies, and yes in a burrito, but if the burrito tastes like a salad, I know  immediately that it's a concession to the chipotle crowd, and no longer a \"real,\" traditional burrito, like at Los Metates or Taqueria San Bruno.) Also, I ordered a \"chicken\"  burrito, but a la chipotle, there was absolutely no chicken in my burrito. Except for three tiny pieces, it was all beans, rice and thin light red water. No guacamole, and barely discernible sour cream.  Was there any cheese in it? I don't know! I never tasted any. But certainly not the melted onto the tortilla kind (step 1) of old. I also requested \"salsa picante\" and they gave me a salsa that looked like a mini tomato, parsley and bell pepper salad that had absolutely no hotness whatsoever. And finally, the clientele. Gone are the occasional (infrequent even in the past,) Hispanic house painters, UPS drivers and other laborers, replaced by Glen Park hipsters, and \"alternative lifestyle\" Noe Valley Anglo (and occasional Japanese) ladies with their same type, deferential husbands, and \"liberally raised\" kids, (you know the types, no meat, vegan, soy protein candy bars, you know, being raised with a life devoid of any guilty, real childhood pleasure, types.) So I felt crappily lonely seeing a childhood memory place disintegrate in front of me. Geesh! Aren't there enough chipotles around here already? (Rhetorical.) I left feeling empty, (and hungry) as the realization suddenly overcame me about how far we are getting from the real authentic, and varied traditional cuisine of Mexico and its wonderful people.", "author": "George F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-04", "description": "Solid traditional taqueria in the heart of Glen Park.  Everything is made fresh, with great ingredients, including fire-roasted salsas on every table.  What's really special about La Corneta is their unique selection of proteins, including seafood as well as sauces like mole, chile verde and cochinita pibil.  Fresh prawns, cooked to-order a la plancha, are a particularly pleasing addition to a burrito or quesadilla.  Unfortunately, soupy and bland carnitas is a (correctable) disappointment, but there are plenty of interesting menu options besides it (including lengua!).  Two things to note before heading to La Corneta: 1) as one of few take-out places in Glen Park, lines can be long around dinner time, particularly just after large commuter bus drop offs, and 2) this is a cash-only establishment.", "author": "Ronald C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-02", "description": "Taquerias in San Francisco are a dime a dozen and everyone has their favorite.  Most neighborhoods have a couple... some neighborhoods there are 3 on the same block.  For my money, La Corneta is my clear favorite.\n\nTHE TOPPINGS\nThis is what makes the the burrito, taco, nachos, etc\n\nChorizo - 5 out of 5 - This is the first place I ever had chorizo and it kind of ruined me.  Every other time I had it I could never understand why it was never as good as here.  The chorizo is fresh and home made.  It is also one of the few toppings that are cooked to order.  Admittedly its a little greesy... but DAMN it's good!\n\nCarne Asada - 5 out of 5 - Juicy, tender and flavorful.  You can't go wrong.  It isn't cooked to order but if you told me it was I would believe you.\n\nShrimp - 4 out of 5 - Fresh and cooked to order.  The shrimp themselves are very good but in most dishes I've had they tend to get a little drowned out by all the other ingredients.  You can also order half shrimp and half Carne Asada (my preference)\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nSuper Burrito (or Baby Super Burrito) - 5 out of 5 - If you're a fan of mission style burritos then it doesn't get much better than this.  Each one comes with your choice of meat and beans, rice, lettuce, cheese, salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  The price for a Super Burrito is a little higher here than a lot of other taquerias at around $7 but it is worth it.  The burritos are huge and super tasty.  If you want a smaller burrito at a cheaper price go with the Baby Super around $5. Its still a large meal and for me, just the right size\n\nSuper Nachos - 4 out of 5 - All the awesomeness of the super burrito but over chips.  The super nachos here are pretty good, one thing I'm not a fan of is that they put the beans, rice and cheese on first then microwave the package so the cheese melts.  I often ask them to skip this step as it tends to make a lot of the chips soggy.  Other than that, the serving is huge and very good.\n\nLOCATION\n\nThe restaurant is a block away from the Glen Park Bart station and packing can be a little tough (thought not north beach tough).  The restaurant is a good size but be prepared to wait in line.  During peak meal hours the line can be out the door and seating can be a little tough as well so be prepared to take it to go.\n\nOVERALL\n\nDespite a few small hiccups, I have yet to find another mexican restaurant where I crave something as much as I do their Chorizo Super Burritto.

Whoopsies?\n\nI love love love the super soft tacos, which resembles a taco bowl. They are packed with grilled meats of my heart's desire, chopped tomatos, lettuce, beans, guac, and sour cream. All ingredients are fresh and the way they are supposed to be. The meats are done just right, flavorful and not tough. Also, the way the juices from the ingredients soak into the tortillas make the tortillas soft and a whole other delectable experience. \n\nThe cantaloupe frescas and horchata drinks are good too. Even though I normally do not consume sugary drinks with my meals, I always order them at La Corneta. It's a must here for me, and that is most definitely a rare thing.", "author": "Mabel Y."}

They make everything right behind the serving area so you can tell it's a pretty clean establishment. \n\nLines can get super long so be prepared to wait. There are a few tables inside but not enough tables/space for big groups (I'd say the max is 6/grp). Most of the customers get their food to-go as well. i've heard that you can also phone in your orders since the line can get pretty long but there's a greater chance that they'll mess up the order- I'd recommend going in to order if you're picky about your food. \n\nParking in the area is a hit or miss as well but try driving a few blocks in and closer to the residential area.", "author": "Patricia K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-28", "description": "LA CORNETA!!! The name makes sense after you eat here, because it's all you can do to not actually go buy a bugle and just stand out there on Diamond and alert people to THE BEST BURRITOS EVER. \n\nThe first requirement for any sort of eatery is cleanliness. La Corneta is clean and bright and beautiful. The food prep area, the dining area, and the bathroom are all neat and clean. I'm immediately impressed by brilliant business owners who realize the need for customers, who are ordering food, for which they've just had to pay in cash, to wash their hands. I appreciate the clean sink and readily available soap and paper towels so much. \n\nWhere the tacos and burritos are concerned... sure they've got other stuff, but I mean, if you're reading these reviews for nachos or sopas, idk buddy. The context I have most experience with involves team taco and team burrito. \n\nThe tacos: they have the requisite double corn tortilla. I always get al pastor. The al pastor here doesn't have pineapple, but it's pretty good otherwise. It isn't that weird barbeque interpretation of al pastor, either. Just happily marinated pork. The sweet little ladies here always give me extra cilantro and lime without giving me dirty looks, which makes the entire taco experience all the lovelier. \n\nThe burritos: they have all kinds of tortillas! White, wheat, red and green, they are gigantic and they warm them up before they start their burrito art. There is a line that moves along the counter as you're specifying your order, and it can get pretty packed in there, so just be ready to choose between beans and whether you want rice. Just get the rice. And black beans. They are so good about draining the beans and not putting dirty bean water on the burrito, I could kiss them from across the glass divider. By the time you get to the guacamole and salsa, they ask which kind of salsa you want. They have huge pans of glorious mild and spicy salsa, of which you have three potential encounters. In the burrito, with the chips, and then, because God smiles on La Corneta, they also have this perfect combination of tomatoes, onions and cilantro salsa in squeeze bottles on the tables with the squeeze top cut so that salsa comes out unabashedly. \n\nIf you are getting a burrito, always get the super burrito. You'll be missing out on crucial mission burrito elements otherwise. I realize these are messier than regular burritos, but don't worry. I get a lot of flack for not eating burritos like a Californian, but I'm from New Jersey and we like to be clean. So once you have your little burrito baby, you have to unwrap the foil lengthwise and then carefully find the burrito seam and open that. Once you've opened the burrito, you can eat the inside neatly with a fork, plus you get the added bonus of being able to later rewrap the tortilla and eat a much neater version of the burrito after eating most of the filling. The thing is huge, though, so maybe not. The thing is delicious, though, so nevermind that it's huge, eat it anyway.\n\nThey also have aquas frescas, that sugary strawberry water of the gods. It is really sweet, but it's sort of hard to find, so it's totally worth getting here. \n\nAlso, this might sound dorky and I'm not sure how important this is to other people, but they have a lot of napkins and the strong kind of plastic forks that don't break easily.

Most of the patrons had young children (infants-toddlers), and while they were generally well-behaved, I felt like the space just wasn't designed for this and the environment felt chaotic.", "author": "Lisa K."}

Either is because there are no other taquerias in Glen Park, or maybe people just don't know what Mexican food should taste like. I ordered two carne asada tacos with just onion and cilantro (the basic menu item that imo can say a lot about the quality of a taqueria). The tacos were so huge I couldn't hold them, the tortillas were soggy, the meat really wasn't good nor fresh nor grilled enough, and the cilantro was not fresh and there was too much of it. And it was the same ingredients that they put in the burritos of other people in the restaurant at the time so I can't see how the other items on the menu can be that good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-25", "description": "This La Corneta  is a good example of quality and its relativity to distance.  One common known fact is that when you venture father away from the heart of the Mission District, the quality of taqueria food declines.  In the case of Glen Park's La Corneta, this holds true.\n\nWhen ordering a burrito, regular or super, they provide twice the amount of beans and half the rice.  When I take the first bite, the food is digestible and holds some taste but I always have to force myself to finish.  By comparison, in a Mission District taqueria, they don't play proportion games with your orders.  They also don't hide condiments and extras like salsa behind the counter.   When food is prepared right like in the Mission, I've got to hold back from buying more!\n\nAs for quality in service, most Mission District taquerias are lined with servers idling to take and complete your order as soon as you speak.  At Glen Park's La Corneta, I've encountered some of the servers jumping to and from the assembly line to finish their jokes or conversations with one another, leaving me hanging as I wait for them.\n\nIn the end, they're not bad but undoubtedly need to be schooled on business practices.", "author": "Honest J."}

THEN, another few ladies came out from the kitchen, looked at me dead in the eye (when she could have been making food) and chatted with the ladies ringing up ONE person. Dude in front of me orders his food. The lady then turned to me and asked what I wanted. I stated to her in perfect spanish my nacho order. She looked puzzled. Then asked if it was to go? I said \"yes\". She then grab some chips in a box, put them on the counter, and then walked away to grab another order and left me hanging!!\n\nI wasn't in a rush, but the disregard really put the icing on the cake for me with this place.

They didn't lie, it was a good burrito.  I like everything green so I had the Especial with pollo en salsa verde with black beans and rice with guac in a spinach tortilla and it was appropriately delicious.  The meat and veggies tasted fresh and all the flavors worked together for me.  After that horrible deformity of a burrito I had at the Shoreline amphitheater, this was much more satisfying.  \nPro: There's a lot on the menu.  Yes, it's all your typical Mexican fare but since there's a lot of that, you have lots of choices\nPro: It's probably the least expensive meal I've had since I've been back to the Bay Area. In a ratio of portion to price, it was a full meal for less than ten bucks. \nPro: The place was clean. The bathroom was even cozy.\nCon: Too long of a line.  Just like at Shoreline, I have to wait a year before I can order.  I wasn't even super hungry when I got in line but I was starving by the time I could order. You wouldn't think that a taqueria on a Sunday night would be so busy but that's how the locals roll I guess.\nCon: They're cash only.  Is it some kind of conspiracy with Glen Park restaurants to not take cards? I'm beyond complaining that this is the 21st century, blah blah blah. It's pretty obvious that they make a ton of money and they pretty much aren't losing business because they don't take cards, and there's ATMs everywhere anyway.  If you're a local, you would have no issue with this but if you're from out of town, it's a pain in the ass, especially if you wait in line for a half hour and get your burrito made to order and then they tell you no acceptan las trajetas, but I did have cash on me anyway so no worries.

Any seafood WILL be cooked before your bug eyes. \n\nChicken in spicy red salsa (pollo en salsa roja) grilled chicken (pollo asado), and grilled steak (carne asada) are the usual suspects for me and Mmm ay que rica are they yum yums on my tongue tongue! I'm yet to try out they carnitas but I'm sure that's crackin too! And the prawn(camaron) anything is delicioso!\n\nMelon (cantaloupe) and strawberry drinks are miraculous to the last drop, and horchata is thirst quenching. Top that off with quick, friendly service and what do you get kids: 5 stars! Count 'em: 1,2,3,4,5. In the words of Flavor Flav: yeaaaahhhhh booooiiiiii, wooooooowww\n\nFair warning: cash only.

She got the carnitas nachos, which were alright, but too much beans and not enough guac, my opinion. The problem though, is that I ordered a pollo en mole burrito. I was really excited that they had mole...I though. \n\nI am not sure who is smoking what, but this was one of the farthest things from mole I have ever tasted. I won't even say it was the worst version of mole I have ever had because it was not even a version of mole. It was just some shredded, chicken breast drowned in some flavorless, watery light brown sauce. I had pictured a very dark brown/black, rich, flavorful mole. I really don't know what this was supposed to be, but it was gross. Not only that, but it soaked through my tortilla instantly so that I was left with a soggy mess that I had to eat with knife and fork like a real gringo. \n\nI have been all over Mexico, have eaten Mexican food all over the U.S., and, more importantly, am Mexican-American, and I can not figure out what they served me. I strongly disagree with Talia G. that anything I tasted from here was better than Farolito, Vallarta, or even Pancho Villa for that matter.

I have a strong affinity to this area because I use to go to school in Saint John Elementary, just a couple of blocks away from here, and I remember this neighborhood being run down, so I'm glad this area has improved throughout the years.\n\nLa Corneta is your typical Mexican eateries, but with the IT factor to it. They have one of the best Super Burrito and Super Prawn Quesadilla you'll ever find and their Quesadilla Suiza with Carne Asada is just downright NASTY (nasty all-caps is ghetto lingo for awesome). You can also get their combination plate, the Quesadilla Suiza, Prawns & Grilled Mushrooms for a very fair price. I love their supersize servings that come in a sombrero size plate. Complimentary chips and salsa with most meals and prices are great.\n\nThe only thing I'm not too keyed up about this particular La Corneta is that they do not take credit card. I'm a no cash carrying chap myself (because I believe that cash should stay in the bank or in my case, I just don't have any), but it just seems a little inconvenient. Parking is also a challenge so you have to stalk someone to get their parking.\n\nOverall it's one of the best Mexican joints you'll find with a rock bottom price, but minus 2 stars for the parking and cash only policy.", "author": "Mel B."}

It's not like I would never eat here again, but my last 2 or 3 steak burritos have been fatty and stringy. The last couple of grilled chicken burritos featured dried-out pollo. So I gave my go-to burrito joint five last chances, realized I was an abused husband, and left for good. At this point La Corneta for me would strictly be a shameful drunken booty call, but sitting here sober as I type, I am shaking my head 'no, never again'.", "author": "J C."}

I also ordered the combination #3 plate which is supposed to have grilled flank steak...

The burrito is good, I don't know what else to say other than that I really wanted to try their al pastor.\n\nSecond time I came here, I came in the afternoon during lunch hour and I got the al pastor I wanted and I definitely prefer the al pastor over carne asada. It's a bit more fatty but that's to be expected but I don't regret it one bit. It was pretty packed though during lunch hour, I was a bit worried that I got the wrong order since they kind of line up the orders by the cashier but thankfully, I got my order.\n\nCame back again for the third time and ordered a super quesadilla suiza with carne asada (I prefer carne asada over al pastor on my quesadilla).

My boyfriend and I had been wanting to explore Glen Park a bit and thought we would ride over to this hood on the trusty scooter for lunch at La Corneta Taqueria. The food here was pretty good. The restaurant atmosphere was very playful--meaning that we were surrounded by children under the age of 5 on all sides. I like kids a lot, there were just tons at this restaurant... one in particular really enjoyed my pink helmet (as did the homeless man outside). \n\nBack to the food: I liked my boy's burrito better than my super nachos. He ordered it with tofu, which was quite tasty. The tofu chunks could have been cut a bit smaller, but all other ingredients were yummy.  Neither menu selections disappointed me terribly or blew my socks off. It satisfied my craving for Mexican food and filled my belly to the brim for a good price. \n\nWould I go back... possibly.

The workers do not wear gloves while they make your food which should be prohibited, it's kinda gross. The line moves kinda slow at the register as well. I've been here a good amount of times. I ordered a carne asada burrito and the employees didn't really speak good English so you have to try to be more specific and sometimes they mess up your order. I'd suggest getting chicken because I think it tastes better than the beef in this location. The burrito cost $8.92 and it was pretty good. I'd wonder how fresh the ingredients are though because it made my stomach feel bad after. I chose to take it to go and I got home about 10-15 minutes after and found that my food was cold, I mean who has to reheat their food after buying it?

The super nachos are piled high with meat, beans, rice, cheese, lettuce,  guacamole, sour cream and salsa.  They melt the cheese over the meat and beans, so it holds it together nicely.

I can't order nachos anywhere else because I know that they won't compare to La Corneta's\n\nTheir burritos are super delicious too.  I can only ever eat a baby burrito.

The place basically runs like an assembly line, choose what you want and your food moves down the line with ingredients being added. There is a huge amount of meats to choose from; I got the spicy chicken while the wife tried the chicken chili verde. The spicy chicken was like a stewed chicken with a small amount of spice to it, in hindsight I should have gotten the grilled chicken. \n\nI like the idea that they warm your tortilla real fast, so you get a tortilla that is nice and warm and ready to eat. The burrito was massive, and if you don't like huge burritos you can choose a baby burrito and normal one. The one thing I noticed was that while the burrito tasted good, not one ingredient stood out. They all kind of ran together and held the same texture.

I came at 2 in the afternoon on a saturday and low and behold, there was a line.  I don't mind waiting as long as it's worth the wait but that was not the case.  I tried their super carne asada burrito and their super nachos.  Their carne asada has zero flavor and some pieces were a bit chewy actually.  The cheese was glooped  up in this one area and so I ended up with a bigass bite of cheese.  Nachos were equally lacking in flavor.  Their rice is funky cuz I've never seen a taqueria have peas and carrots in their rice.  Everything was just so forgettable.  And not to mention, overpriced.  \n\nYou know, I'm usually very excited to finish my half burrito (because I can only finish half in one sitting) but I just found myself looking at the burrito sadly thinking, \"You could've been so great.  What happened?\"", "author": "Vanessa C."}

You can even check it out here on their website, tempting isnt it??? http://www.lacorneta.com/MenuPage.aspx\n\nNot like any other little burrito shop or taco truck where you have only a little amount of choice to choose from; At here, they have a great variety of burritos ( meats, seafood, or vegetarian) nicely separately into diff. categories. \n\nIf you wanna try a little of EVERYTHING, try combination! I got Combo # 4--CARNE ASADA, POLLO & PRAWNS served with rice, beans, salad, and Tortillas! It was a BIG plate which you can share with one more person! (it comes along with Nachos too! Great deal isnt it?? for $12.55) the grilled steak and chicken were great (not rough)!! And prawns were oh-my-god DELICIOUS!!!! Grilled mushroom was so fresh and nicely-done too! I love LOVE love this plate!!!!! \n\n\nBoth of my friend got themselves different burritos, too bad I dont remember the names of them, but they were really good too!!! I tried both of them! around $8 each! Also served with Nachos! =)\n\n\nI will def. come back to this place! I just gotta try MOREEEEE food!!!\n\n\nP.S. people there are pretty nice. Service is fast even though there was a long line today =) An ideal place to hang out and have good food!", "author": "Kal S."}

There were plenty eating and another line waiting to order.  We ordered a regular taco with carnitas ($3.25?) with your choice of beans (pinto, black or refried) and salsa (regular or spicy).  The tortilla was loaded with refried beans, chunks of carnitas and a heapful of spicy salsa.  It was plenty to fill us up along w/ the complimentary chips and salsa.  The spicy salsa is terrific with lots of chopped up jalepeno that gives it a nice kick.\n\nLove that there were bottles of green and red sauces on the tables so I can load up every bite with more flavor. \n\nThe horchata is very tasty (small is $1.25?), great flavor of cinnamon and just the right amount of sweetness.", "author": "Gloria H."}

The chips come out warm because they're made on site and one of the joys of life should be warm and crispy tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole. Scratch that. I can one up that by recommending the super nachos because that combines the warm chips with guacamole, cheese, sour cream, and meat.

With everything fresh, you cannot go wrong.  The Super Steak Tostada comes with steak, lettuce, tomato, cheese, guacamole and beans.

To those that swear by la taqueria, I say to you this: don't try to argue that by not putting rice in a burrito, you are making it better.  it doesn't.  I like my burritos big, bulky, and chalk full of flavor, and to not have rice is a travesty in my book. \n\nThis place has two things that you should get: the super burrito with either carne asada, grilled chicken, or carnitas.  Alternatively, the super nachos.  I dare anyone to try and finish those nachos all by themselves.  \n\nThe \"super\" in the super burrito/nacho entails all the accoutrements that make the burrito tasty -- guac, sour cream, lettuce, pico de gallo, etc. Thus, it's a necessity.  \n\nI suppose the thing I like most about these burritos is that they aren't dry.  I comparison to let's say, chipotle, there is a certain moistness to la corneta's burritos that is almost indescribable, but can be imagined when you think about how fresh guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, lettuce and juicy meat would come together.  \n\nCall in your order to go right to the front of the line and pay.  If you call even 10 minutes before you arrive, then your burrito will be ready.\n\nParking can be bad...best shot is to go to that parking lot close by.

Second, the place is pretty small and gets packed pretty fast, so don't count on getting a seat in this place, your better off planning for takeout.  Plus, make sure that when you order, you follow your order all the way to the register! A few times ive been there your food tends to get in the shuffle and a misunderstanding occurs and you get something wrong with your order.  In my experience it isnt anything serious, once or twice i got a different kind of salsa then i asked for, but other then that nothing major.\n\nOk to the good things...\nIve already said, the food here is tremendously good!  They have a big selection of food to choose from that are all reasonably priced.  The biggest bonus of this place is the fresh ingredients.  I love their salsa among other things, because of its fresh taste.  As i mentioned earlier, the place gets pretty packed so thats a negative, but there are usually enough people working behind the counter that the line moves very quickly.  Sometimes too quickly, make sure u know what u want! :-P  You also know its a good place to eat when u have a variety of different kinds of people eating there.

For a taqueria, that seems a bit outlandish, no?!  And the food wasn't even that good today! :(\n\n- We ordered steak and prawn burritos, and they were pretty damn bland.  The steak seems completely unseasoned, and the server was pretty stingy with the guac and sour cream.\n\n- The chips were stale.  Yuck!\n\nMaybe I was just less picky years ago, but wow, I have no doubt that any burrito-seeking folks can do better than this place nowadays.  What a shame!\n\n*  *  *\n\nThis is one of the places I go to with a bit of reluctance rather than an \"Oh boy, can't wait to go!\" kinda feeling.\n\nI'll start off with the annoying stuff:\n\n- It's cramped.\n\n- Tortillas are steamed, not grilled.  After trying grilled tortillas elsewhere, going back to steamed makes me a bit grumpy :(\n\n- They nickel and dime you.  50 cents extra to have some beans in my quesadilla?  Come on.  I'm already paying $9+ for the damn steak-and-prawn quesadilla!\n\n- Prices have been edging up pretty strongly over the last two years.  A fancy burrito and an horchata'll easily cost you over $12 :(.\n\nBut the good stuff that keeps me coming back:\n\n- I've never had such an amazingly good prawn or steak-and-prawn burrito/quesadilla/etc.  Come to think of it, I've never seen another taqueria that offers juicy garlicky prawns (and I don't mean the little tiny crappola fishyfishy shrimps, either!).\n\n- Parking usually isn't too bad.\n\n- The salsa and chips are actually darn tasty.  I mean, come on, what's with so many other taquerias around here having chips that taste like compressed stale sawdust?  Or chips that've CLEARLY been taken out of a bag that was shipped from several states away... last week?\n\n- The super burritos will easily last you two meals.\n\n- The horchatas are yummy, with tasty bits of fruit that actually taste like fruit :)\n\n- The tortas are also super-tasty!  Try an untraditional one with chicken mole.  Or bbq pork!\n\n*  *  *\n\nSo, in the end, I still come here at least twice a month on weekends to grab a two-meal dealie.

It's ALL good to me, as long as it is cooked well.  While in the neighborhood, I thought a Super Prawn & Mushroom Quesadilla (hold the sour cream, with mild salsa) would make a nice filling lunch.  When my order arrived and I bit into the first taste of the perfectly cooked mushrooms, there was a deafening silence.  There's something about biting into cooked fresh mushrooms and getting that crunch without being raw.  In this case, they sautee the mushroom slices with sliced pieces of prawns and add them to a toasted tortilla filled with melted gooey cheese, guacamole, lettuce, and mild salsa.  Cut into two large pieces, you can eat this with your hands, but I recommend using a fork and knife for the final bites as the quesadilla becomes soggy as you eat it.  At $10.95 ($9.45 for Super Prawn add $1.50 for mushrooms), it may be a little pricey for lunch, but the yumminess is WELL worth it.  I do not recommend doing take out with this as the mushrooms make for a soggy tortilla as it steams in its container on the way home.

The chile was well seasoned, but not particularly spicy and neither was the salsa, but I'll bet a better order could have solved that.

I was thinking let's give this place a try.  Right when you enter this place, I would imagine grills/stoves heated with food, but it wasn't.  I waited at the front so that I can pick the meats, beans, salsa, etc.  I had to walk all the way up to the register, the guy there was busy counting money, looked at us, and went back to counting money.  It wasn't until I had to flag one of the cooks who then flagged a lady to take our order.  \n\nI ordered a baby burrito.  I'm use to the taquerias in the Mission with freshly cooked/heated items, flames everywhere, the good ol grill smoke filled atmosphere. The burrito wrap was not heated on the grill, the carnitas was already in one of those steam/warm bins, the salsa tasted bland.  The lady preparing the burrito didn't even stuff it, you know the type of burrito that is fully stuffed, instead my baby burrito was filled with air.  Extra salsa? You would need to ask for it.  I was also about to order an Orchata, but it wasn't even kept in the refrigerator, left out in the open for who knows how long.  Finally we went back to the register and the guy says CASH ONLY...wtf.\n\nThe only plus star is the interior design of this place. Wait, I take that star back because the tables were not clean and there were leftover food and drinks from previous customers.  My word of advise, stick to the Mission.  \"Eek!

It's funny, though. I never get a smile or a hello. But I've learned that putting together a taco dinner is more an art than a science. Sometimes you get cheese, sometimes you don't. Sometimes the beans go here, sometimes they go there. Sometimes half of your meal is rice, sometimes it's half lettuce. So I've learned to keep an eye on the preparer to be sure they make it the way I want.\n\nA little trick--call in your order ahead of time so you don't have to stand in the line, which can be pretty long during the dinner rush (20\" or more). The only drawback is that you may not, for example, get cheese with your taco dinner.", "author": "E B."}

IMHO, you can tell the locals from the posers based on whether their favorite is in the 16th/mission area or not (posers only know about taquerias in the mission if you ask me.)\n\nI've been eating at La Corneta since I was a 14 year old vegetarian. And my order (super baby vegetarian burrito) hasn't changed much, even though I'm not a vegetarian anymore. (Now I add sliced avocado, but that's the only change.)\n\nThings I love about La Corneta:\n\n1. Baby burritos! They are the answer to the \"burrito belly\" effect that happens every time I get a burrito somewhere else. I have no self-control when it comes to eating burritos. None. I can't  stop myself from finishing them because the tastiest bites are always at the end. But finishing other burritos just makes me feel sick. Too much food! I'm sleepy! My tummy hurts! Baby burritos are the answer. I can finish my burrito and not feel too badly (the secret is the smaller tortilla size, and the smaller portions of the fillings). \n\n2. Sliced avocado! Glorious addition, and only a little bit more $. Be sure to wait until after they've put the guac in to ask for it, that way you get double avocado love!\n\n3. The mural. \n\nHowever, the ladies that work there are sometimes surly, and often don't listen. You have to watch them making your burrito so you don't end up with the wrong stuff in it (or no sour cream when you wanted it, or no guac, or whatever). Just watch them and you'll be fine.\n\nAlso, the line is often ridiculous, and many of the people don't THINK about what they want while they're waiting for 10 minutes to order (personal peeve). Nothing La Corneta can do about that. but SERIOUSLY people. Think while you're in line, and save us all some time! (That should be a rhyme!) \n\nOh, and they're cash only. Always a little bit lame when places are cash only, I think.\n\nBut still, my all time favorite SF burrito.", "author": "Marissa K."}

They will always hold a special place in my heart for introducing me to, my now favorite burrito - the Chile Relleno Burrito.  I will never forget that special moment when I noticed it on the menu, when I coyly ordered it, not knowing what would come of it.  I remember my first bite of warm cheese, hot chile and pillow-like rice and breading.  And now, I'm addicted.  Its literally the only burrito I order anywhere, and when it isn't available I tend to pout.  \n\nLa Corneta's Chile Relleno Burrito sets my benchmark for all chile relleno burritos.  Namely falling into three categories:  Ingredients, Density, Composition.  The ingredients are most important as a C.R.B can only be as good as it's Chile Relleno is.  Also, the quality of the beans and the rice is equally important as they add or subtract a lot of flavor.  The density of any burrito is calculated based on the air to stuffing ration inside the burrito.  A properly dense burrito should be able to be rolled tightly with a nice blend of rice, beans and chile relleno in every bite.  Lastly, the composition of a burrito is based on all things involved other than tortilla, rice, beans and chile relleno.  This includes anything from smothering the burrito to adding sour cream and guacamole.  \n\nThe IDC Breakdown:\nIngredients: 9  Their ingredients are incredibly tasty and their chile relleno is subtle, hot but not too hot, cheesy but not too cheesy.  Their rice is light and the beans are thick without being greasy.  \n\nDensity: 9  Their burritos are tightly rolled and double wrapped with aluminum foil.  After the initial bites you can clearly see the equal distribution of the rice, beans and chile.  \n\nComposition: 9  At La Corneta you can opt to order your Chile Relleno Burrito with or without Cheese, Guacamole, Lettuce, Tomato, Sour Cream, & Salsa.  If you want it with, order your burrito \"Super,\" if you want it without order your burrito \"Regular.\"  I especially like that La Corneta trims the stem from the relleno before heating it up, and heats the relleno in a light tomato broth.  \n\nAll in all, La Corneta is my favorite place to go for a chile relleno burrito - though I often wish it was less popular.

It's in the heart of Glen Park, and when I mean heart, I mean heart.  It's close to a bus stop and the BART station.  So there's a lot of car AND people traffic.  There are many other stores around there such a Whole Foods and other restaurants like Tyger's.\n\nThis is probably the only taqueria in the city I will go to by myself and not forced by people.  I love it here.  The menu is awesome and the selection to add in plentiful.  The way their wrap your burrito too is SUPERB.  Not no envelope wrapped Taco Bell crap, no sir.  Tight and packed for your enjoyment.  The only bad I would say is that they don't accept card, even though there are several banks near by; the line can get pretty long and it's pretty small inside; and the parking can get irritating.\n\nLove this place though, either way.

I am of the opinion that La Corneta on Diamond street could, quite possibly, be the best Taqueria in S.F.  I know that's a risky proposition and maybe I should qualify this by saying the best one \"I\" have been to.  But  I gotta tell you, it's pretty damn good and it's INCREDIBLY reasonably priced.  My personal suggestion is to have the super taco.  For under $5 my wife and I have been known to share one happily.\n\nNow, don't expect anything cutting edge or fancy.  It's just a taqueria.

A one time occurance I/we could accept.  But this is an ongoing issue.  Language is not the issue as my Son and I both speak and often order in spanish.

Slightly charred on the outside yet juicy in the middle steak, fresh mildly hot salsa, excellent refriend and black beans, zesty guacamole, spinach, corn or flour tortilla, and flavorful rice. \n\nTortilla chips are always fresh and the salsa was made daily. \n\nIt used to be a small restaurant with barely any seating, lines were out the door and it was always busy. \n\nFew years later last Sunday I went there again. It's now a double wide restaurant, with more but still limited seating. The lines are still out the door and the burrito is just as good though a little on the dry side. The tortilla chips are still fresh but the salsa is on the tables in those squeezable ketchup bottles, a little disappointing really. \n\nThe service is perfectly acceptable. If your eating there and your order takes a while, they will bring it to you. \n\nAll the burritos clock in at under 7 bucks and about 7 inches long and around 2 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter depending on whether you get regular or super burritos. The chicken is just as good as the steak but I've never had the fish so I can't say. \n\nParking is a pain in the ass, though you may get lucky on one of the side streets. This is a cash only place but there is a BofA ATM just a couple doors down to quickly remedy this.  \n\nThis is still one of my favorite places in SF for burritos.", "author": "David F."}

I lived in San Diego during my college years expecting to find better, if not, same quality tasting burrito.  I was sadly disappointed.  So much so, that whenever family members or friends from SF would visit me, I requested they bring me a burrito from La Corneta.  La Corneta's prices are reasonable and the portions will keep you full.  I can appreciate the cleanliness of a good taqueria joint as well.  The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that when phoning in an order to-go, at times, it can take just as long to wait in line.  Can't blame them though since La Corneta is always jam packed and the line always wraps around.

The burrito is great, especially given the choice of Black Beans over refried.  \nLast night I took Mat K. for his first time.  He was skeptical going to Glen Park for a burrito, but reluctantly gave in.  As we were unwrapping our burrito's, he was telling me how Nor Cal burrito's don't stand up to So Cal ones.  Right after he took his first bite, with a look of shock on his face he says, \"Wow, this is the best burrito I've had since moving up here.\"  He states that he could find a better one down south (freaking transplants), but I think after this burrito he's going to have his work cut out for him.  He was also worried when we walked in and there was no salsa bar.  But the two salsas on the tables are wonderful.  I like the green better, yet I can't seem to aim the noosle to lather my burrito without getting it all over my hand too.\nEverything on the menu is delicious.

I love the fact that they have super baby burritos with all the good stuff like cheese, sour cream and guacamole in a more managable size at a more reasonable price.  Anything I order usually includes their \"spicy chicken\" which really is spicy but they have TONS of diferent meat options including seafood.  It's a good thing I don't live closer to any of the locations of this place because I'd probably weigh 500 pounds.", "author": "M M."}

No soupy burritos, no falling-apart burritos, no roasted bell peppers and sun dried tomatoes and all that faux gourmet hi-tech burrito stuff.  For me, Taqueria Cancun is the gold standard (since Talk of the Town in Oakland closed some years ago).  This place comes in pretty close, except that they steam their tortillas and they don't use chunks of avocado (they use guacamole instead).  However, unlike Cancun, they offer a salmon burrito which is surprisingly well-balanced and tasty.  I was impressed overall, it's worth a visit.", "author": "Samantha R."}

Typically at other Taqueria's I am \"forced\" to order a regular super burrito.  Thus I feel inclined eating the whole thing because 1. I don't like to waste food 2. cold day old burritos don't taste quite as good nor do they look appealing 3. I like to eat.  But here at La Corneta they have these smaller baby burritos that are just the right size! My pants aren't too tight after consumption and I am safisfied :)  \nThe super baby burritos are about 4-5 dollars and come with a side of salsa and chips.  I personally like getting a carnitas super baby with refried beans.  The refried beans here are good, never too watery and quite tasty.

But you gotta take the bad with the good.\n\nGood: \n* The food: Burritos are solid -- not as great as some of the best in the Mission, but better than 95% of the others you'll get in the USA. The meats are generally superior -- carnitas, pollo rojo, mole, pollo verde, shrimp, all fresh and tasty. The quesadillas are absolute monsters, scrumptious, greasy monsters.\n* Portions/Value: Most of the platters go for $8-$9, and you get a LOT of food.  If you order an enchiladas or meat platter, it comes with a giant portion of your entree, a lot of beans, and maybe a pound of rice. Plus guac. Plus a salad. Plus extra tortillas. And chips, if you want 'em. You will not leave hungry or broke, and like I said, the food quality is generally excellent.\n* Take-out. You can call in your order ahead of time and skip the unbelievably long line (see below).\n* Service: One time I was dissatisfied with the meat-to-fat ratio with my carnitas. I took it back, they fixed it, no hassles. These people are very nice.\n\nBad:\n* This is the only taqueria in the neighborhood, and people come from all over Glen Park, Miraloma, Sunnyside, and the surrounding hoods. Corneta is a mob scene for lunch or dinner every day of the year. The line literally goes out the door, and while Corneta seems adequately staffed, it doesn't seem to process the throughput of some of the stars of the Mission. So if you come during peak hours (11:30am-2pm, 6-8pm), expect to wait in line for a while.\n* Because it's so busy, seating is at a premium. I don't know how about 1/2 the reviewers could possibly rate this place as \"good for groups,\" because it's hard enough to get a table for 3 or 4 in there. But again, this is testament to the quality and value of this place.\n* Cash only. B of A, Wells, and Citi have ATMs within a block, but bring your greenbacks.", "author": "Eric M."}

I live in Glen Park but even if I didn't I'd probably be here standing in line with all these fools from other neighborhoods and towns who come all the way to enjoy  delicious tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc.\n\nIt's funny, whenever I go ANYWHERE in the West, I always try to track down the best taqueria in town. Some have come pretty close to beating La Corneta (especially Santana's in San Diego or some mariscos joint in downtown Riverside) but for the most part the improbably located taqueria in Glen Park (aka SoNoe or I'm Living in Glen Park because I can't Afford the Marina) takes the cake, err the churros. Pretty much everything here is boss. Try the shrimp quesadillas if you really want to know what living is or the pollo asado burrito. When I was younger I used to get the super burrito. Now that I'm getting older, I find that one lousy (actually it's not lousy) taco is more than enough food. Wash it down with a Negro Modelo or their delicious cinamonny horchata, and you are in hog heaven. Another plus: real goddamn guacamole; not that crappy watered down stuff they use at \"can\"cun (why do hipsters like that place so much?)\n\nI agree with some of the other reviewers that a grilled tortilla, a la El Farolito, is pretty hard to beat, but imagine how crazy the helix-style lines here would be if they tried that. By the way, El Farolito is my other favorite taqueria in San Francisco.\n\nFinally, some serious respeto to the burrito wrappers at LC. I can't believe what an elaborate ballet needs to happen to get everyone through that line. It's long but it usually goes pretty fast unless you get one of those micromanagers who is ordering for an entire family and has to specify the exact bean count for each freakin' burrito!", "author": "Christopher V."}

We like to sit at the bar near the window and just watch people walk by while enjoying our meal. The burrito is very filling and all the ingredients in the burrito aren't too loaded. I like the coolness that the guacamole and sour cream brings to the overall flavor of the burrito. I never eat the chips that come with my burrito because I give it to homeless dude who I always see in front of the restaurant. Even though this isn't the best burrito I've ever had, I like the experience of coming here with my dad and just eating burritos.

Tons of options that you won't always find, like multiple tortilla flavors (spinach, whole wheat) and a ton of different toppings for your taco/burrito.  They have a stewed tofu which will make you forget it's tofu, and I've enjoyed every meat there, and have tried most of them over the past few years.  Carne asada is great, and the chicken mole is a real treat.  \n\nThey're really flexible too, and generally handle every request (no cheese, lettuce and guacamole only, whatever) just fine.  They're among the hardest working people I've ever seen in a restaurant, and they are always at least pleasant no matter how hot it is in there or how busy they are.  They process a ton of people through there (surely these people don't all live in Glen Park, and know there's another location on 24th St.?) and do it quickly.  They seem equally happy if you order in Spanish or English, another nice part about the place.\n\nFew stay to eat, but the surroundings are pleasant enough.  They sampled many tile colors from Home Depot but arranged them pleasingly, and there's a nice paint job as well.  It's pretty clean and surprisingly welcoming for what is, essentially, a taqueria.\n\nFinally, if you are considering coming here for the first time, be prepared to stand in one of the longer lines you will find in an eating venue in SF.  It's kind of reminiscent of one of those falafel stands on MacDougal St. in Manhattan, where the line is out the door.  Except here the line stays inside.  Anyway, I guess burritos are our special answer to the middle eastern food we generally lack here.\n\nThey are really prompt and accurate with phone-in/take-out orders, and sometimes ludicrously fast.  I once called in a dinner for 6 visiting relatives and by the time I had gotten in the car and started to drive the 5 minutes up the hill to get it they were calling to ask where I was!  \n\nAlso, you might be lulled by the location or the surroundings into thinking that this place takes anything except dollars.  There's an ATM up the street, but avoid embarrassment and come with cash.  A bit more than the average taqueria, but cheap enough.", "author": "Spaulding A."}

Service is a bit slow, there were four employees, one worked the register, one made the food, the other two were standing there talking to the others. Hence why most people will say there's a line. Only one person making the food. They have hot sauce on the tables for you to add more heat, but the hot sauce was very mild, the green sauce tasted like toothpaste as I quote my friend, bland and minty.

Every time, the food is consistent, humongous portions, tasty and fresh!  Relatively fast as well, as long as the line is not out the door.  On a weekday, there's less of a wait but I guess it depends on how early/late you arrive during meal times.  Love the combos and even their wheat tortillas are amazingly chewy and savory!  The very sweet and refreshing strawberry agua fresca probably has too many calories, as do all the entrees there, I'm guessing.  But who cares when it's this good?  I stuff my face every time I go.  They even have a chocolate/flan layer hybrid cake for dessert!  Just wish they would drizzle a bit more caramel sauce on it!  But all in all, my favorite go-to place for Mexican now !  No need to trek over to the Misson...woohoo!", "author": "Doris C."}

I'd recommend the steak and prawn burrito - carne asada y camarones (which can be pricey) or the chicken in green sauce - pollo verde (which can be a little messy) both very good. The lines can be long but move quick. Make sure you have cash because last time I checked they don't accept credit cards.

I have to say that I did enjoy this place, but it's just your average taqueria.  After visiting those wonderful tiny drive-thru stands in San Diego and LA that charge a fraction of the price for the same quantity/quality, I was not that impressed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-08", "description": "We went to this place today and there is a homeless guy standing outside begging and then he comes in and demands that the people behind the counter warm up his food that someone bought for him that he had outside somewhere. He hands it to the idiots behind the counter and they carry it over the open containers of food to the microwave that they also heat the food to be served in. This was one of the most unsanitary moves I have seen. To top that off they let this guy actively pan handle inside the store stopping each person in line trying to buy food . Sorry but this needs to be reported to the health department too. Who knows what kind of disease this guy had. I mean he really looked bad and it was like the staff behind the counter were scared to tell him he needs to leave. I really liked the food and the location until I saw this, I will never eat there again and I suggest you seriously consider finding another place if they continue to mingle homeless meals with the meals that they serve paying customers.", "author": "blue S."}

Here are some exercises to try: 1) order something your way, 2) check your bill for extras you didn't request. Wanna add lettuce? At La Corneta it's 50\u00a2, every other Mexican place in the universe it's free. As for authentic, no where in Mexico do they put beans in the tacos--that's maybe a burro or burrito on that side of the border. One time I thought I'd make life simple and order the chile relleno solo off the menu. I got to the cashier and found they added cheese and cream without asking and charged me for the disservice. I complained (not rudely or anything) and the girl literally threw my refund (short of tax) at me. She vocalized \"Next time...[as though I should order differently]. How shall I order? I'd like a word with the owner because the employees neither speak English or Customer Service. Head to the Mission for good Mexican without the hassle and ill feelings.", "author": "Eric M."}

There are often long lines, but they get through the crowd quickly. Their menu is extensive and you are sure to find something for everyone.", "author": "Rachelle P."}

I have been eating at this place since I was like 8 years old (give or take a few years) I treat myself to this place whenever I can. EVERYONE I take here absolutely loves it. This is real authentic Mexican food I am so spoiled by this place that when I go somewhere else I am never really satisfied.", "author": "Johnell H."}

I particularly like that they use salmon in their fish menu items. My  favorites include: Super baby fish burrito and the fish dinner.  The long wait is the only down side.", "author": "Marina D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-04", "description": "Currently my favorite Mexican food in the whole world. Never, EVER been disappointed. They grill to perfection. I don't expect fancy service for these prices which, admittedly, are on the slightly high side. But I always get some kind of smile and never any attitude. Actually, I called in an order once ahead of time and they hadn't prepared it by the time I got there, so I guess they're not perfect. That was two years ago. Now, 30 \"burritos especiales\" later, I'm still going back. I get the burrito, chips, and a simple corn quesadilla for less than $10 and it packs plenty of flavor zing... and is almost enough to feed two, actually. They give roasted jalapenos, lime, and salsa free of charge to boot. Just be sure to ask. I see some people have complained that the lines are long, but, HELLO, the lines are long for a reason. Remember the \"Soup Nazi\" episode of Seinfeld?! I suggest avoiding lunch and dinner rush hours if you don't have more than 10-15 mins.", "author": "L I."}

Tonight, I came in with my husband and daughter for dinner. I sat at a table while they waited to order. They waited, and waited, and waited. There was at this time nobody in line but my husband. Finally my husband requested that someone come and take his order. They looked at him briefly, but no one said anything to him and ignored him. My daughter shouted \"Hey! We need service over here!\" and was ignored. They waited for ten minutes without anyone saying \"I will be right with you\" or \"Sorry to keep you waiting, be right there.\" It was not busy and at that time there was no one behind us in line. Finally, he did something he never does, he got angry and left. I went up to the servers and asked why they did not serve my husband, or at least acknowledge him. Looking at him without comment is not an acknowledgment. At first they stared at me blankly, they when I asked what was wrong with them that they could not apologize to my husband, they apologized to me instead! Management needs to work on a customer service standard. They should acknowledge or greet people when they come in, even at closing time, which this was not, it was 9pm.", "author": "Lisa B."}

This last Friday was my last time.  The food LOOKS great and the portions are generous BUT the flavor just isn't there.  It needs \"something\" I just can't put put my finger on it.  I ordered the Carne Asada Super Nachos. Again, it looked spectacular and appetizing BUT the meat was like shoe leather and they were cut in big chunks so I had to use a knife to cut them into bite size pieces. The beans have no flavor; the green and red \"chile\" that they have on the tables again it looked good but it had no flavor.  My hubby ordered the ceviche tostada and he said it was good but he got sick in the middle of the night. No more La Corneta for us. Sorry La Corneta I gave you 3 chances but you just don't cut it for these two picky Latinos.", "author": "M R."}
