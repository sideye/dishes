{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-26", "description": "I found A La Turca Restaurant on Yelp and as it had a solid four star rating I decided to try it for dinner a couple of days ago. I wanted to get something a little different than simple doner or shish kebabs that Turkish restaurants are known for. I had tried Iskender kabab at Anatolian Kitchen in Palo Alto sometime back so when I saw it on the menu here I decided to get that to-go ($15.25) via the online ordering app on Yelp.\n\nA La Turca Restaurant is in the hood (Tenderloin) so after dodging half a dozen panhandlers I finally landed here after about 20 minutes of ordering to find my food ready to-go.\n\nIskender kebab is supposed to be slices of doner kabab on bread cubes topped with tomato sauce and served with yogurt. What I got seemed to have all the components plus an additional naan type of bread. The doner kabab was thinly sliced as expected. Unfortunately it did not taste like it had been freshly sliced off the spit. It seemed to be have been pre-sliced and then made to sit under a lamp which squeezed all the moisture out of it giving it a texture of cardboard. The tomato sauce also could not rescue this disaster. The best part of the dish was the yogurt which was fresh, creamy and seemed homemade. The naan type of bread was also dry and crumbly. It was definitely not fresh, nor had it been heated up before it was handed over to me.\n\nOverall this was just bad when compared to the soft juicy doner topped with tomato sauce that I recollect eating in Anatolian Kitchen. Price-wise that was 15% more expensive but totally worth the extra cost. I'm not sure how this place deserves a four start rating but what I got certainly did not deserve a four star rating. My return visit is pretty doubtful.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-11-29", "description": "A unique Turkish restaurant with some great dishes.\n\nMy friends and I have been eyeing interesting restaurants in San Francisco. A La Turca piqued our interests because there aren't very many Turkish restaurants. Excited and eager, we all decided to go on a Friday night.\n\nI came with 3 other people on a Friday night at around 6 pm. The restaurant was rather empty to our pleasure so we quickly got seated.\n\nThe menu was large and vast so we had difficulty choosing what we wanted. Something that bothered me here was that our server came to ask us if we were ready way too many times within a short period. Normally I wouldn't be too irked by this, but considering the fact that the store was empty I didn't want to feel rushed.  However, when we wanted to pay for the bill and tried to grab the server's attention, it took much difficulty to do so.\n\nMy friends and I ended up ordering many dishes:\nWe got the Lahmacun(bread with delicious toppings on top), Combo Grilled Plate(Lamb/beef/chicken shishkabobs, and meat ball that comes with rice, salad, and pide bread), Lamb Beyti, Chicken & Mushroom Pide, Spinach & Cheese Gozleme, and Baklava.\n\nThe Lahmacun was very delicious. I thought this was one of their better dishes. It has a very unique flatbread texture with very seasoned toppings. The lahmacun had a great bite, and the taste was definitely there.\nThe Combo Grilled Plate was great. I thought the varying types of meat was fun. While they weren't unique, they were well cooked meats. The meats are very much different to shishkabob meats, but it was a good variety. \nThe Lamb Beyti was amazing. I really loved this dish. This dish was composed of ground lambed wrapped up into their flatbread. The dish comes with yogurt and their special sauce(which is a tomato based). I thought this dish had no flaws, and I could not find anything to be unhappy about.\nThe Spinach & Cheese Gozleme was disappointing. I expected the flour consistency to be as good as all their other breads but the gozleme was boring. It tasted like a quesadilla and because of that I was sorely disappointed.\nThe Baklava was generic baklava. It was less sticky than most baklava (which I liked) but the size was extremely small.\nLastly, while we ordered the Mushroom & chicken Pide, we got the Potato & Cheese Pide instead. We tried to tell our server this, but the server stubbornly said we ordered mushroom, and would not accept any conversation regarding it. This frustrated me because I would understand if we wouldn't be able to get the order fixed, but there was no attempt to talk about this at all. The potato and Cheese pide was disappointing as well, but that's because I believe the potato with the pide was a strange texture combination. While I really liked the pide, combining it with the potato made it a dish I find hard to recommend.\n\nOverall, in terms of the quality of food, A La Turca is a unique experience with many unique dishes, their Pide, Beyti, and Lahmacun especially. However, A La Turca is a rather pricey place, and while there are some gems, there are a lot of generic dishes as well. This experience of mine was difficult to recommend because of the poor customer service I received, but I would be willing to give it another shot.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

I got a doner sandwich and kenefe. \n\nThe kenefe was great. I am Syrian and kenefe (we spell it kunafeh) is a treat that's hard to find. It's a cheese pastry soaked in syrup. What's not to love?\n\nThe reason this place is getting a low review is due to the sandwich. It was horrible. I actually threw it out, and it takes a lot for me to do that. I would assume it is better on the pide, but the lavash was bad. Lavash is already a bland, dry bread, and they did nothing to combat that. There was almost no tahini sauce, the lavash was too big for the sandwich, and there was very little meat. The sandwich was basically a double layer of lavash with lettuce inside. You can see in the picture there was one, maybe two, thin pieces of meat showing. With the size of the sandwich that was one bite per cross section. The actual components themselves were fine. I eat a lot of Mediterranean, and this was nothing exceptional. Still with that, the sandwich would be more than satisfying if it had more meat, more sauce, less bread, and less lettuce.", "author": "Jo B."}

I wish I could find the feta cheese that was on this salad!  It was more moist than what I find in the stores.

It was all cooked to perfection and I admit I ate most of his platter. Oops, I did it again.  Oh and the rice on the platter was perfect. I'm a big rice fan and cook rice all the time and I feel I know rice. That was good rice!\n\nWe also ordered the grape leaves which were perfect and delicious and the pita bread that came with the meal was served warm and fluffy and actually if our food hadn't come to fast we would have ordered the humus.

A La Turca gives you just what you need, when you need it. Although it is situated in a not-so-great part of the city, once inside, the ambiance completely changes. My husband and I arrived for a late lunch and were greeted right away to find a table. Our waiter was courteous, respectful, and not overly talkative, which was nice. We shared the Lamb Shish Kebap, with the feta cheese and spinach pastry dough appetizer--we topped it all off with some Turkish coffee of course, accompanied by a small slice of Baklava.

With what seems to be hot liquid butter then poured over. Generous portion.\n* Gozleme with Spinach and Cheese - 4/5. Two large thin pitas with a thin layer of spinach and cheese sandwiched between them. I appreciate the fact that it wasn't overwhelmingly cheesy and there was a good amount of spinach in here. Had a nice crunch to the pitas.\n* Boregi - 4/5. Buttery puff pastry with spinach and cheese. A bit more heavy on the cheese ratio than the Gozleme but also really good. Who doesn't love a buttery puff pastry. Two small halves that come with a tomato and lettuce salad in olive oil. \n\nAlso:\n* Hummus - 4/5 they thought we ordered it and gave it to us on the house.

I noticed they had a sign outside that stated they were under new management . The Turkish family that had opened the restaurant sold it. Outside, it looks the same except for the new management sign...but as soon as I walked in I knew it was very different. They didn't have all the placemats and other little things that were actually Turkish...I loved to go for a meal and watch Turkish Wheel of Fortune on the dust encrusted old \"Big Screen\" TV. I'm easily entertained...the waitress came to our table in a timely manner-with ice water! This, unfortunately, is where I realized that it was more than managers that left....God bless 'em, an Asian family bought the place so it was hard to ask questions regarding some of the menu items. My dinning partner that night had never eaten there or any Turkish restaurant so she did have questions...she tried but the waitress didn't communicate well with my friend. I live here and have lived here for 80% of my life so I understand all the different accents we have going on here. NOW...the important part, the food was very, very good. I ordered the chicken salad because I wasn't sure what was going to happen. It was way more than I could eat. Excellent! It came with a basket of fresh warm bread. My friend ordered something that our waitress could only say...\"Like quesadilla...yes, like that\" Whatever...well, it was fantastic and again, there was a lot of really good food. CHEAP...this place is so inexpensive, it makes me wonder why everybody charges so much? I mean it, we were out of there with a good tip under $30.00!

I did not feel safe walking down the street with my two little kids. \n\nSecondly, the owner did not seem very friendly, and the waitress was a-ok. Because I am Turkish, generally I make a lot of effort to try find and eat at authentic Turkish restaurants no matter how far they are. I like to believe that I am supporting my community. We are generally very friendly and welcoming people. When we meet a fellow Turk, we talk to them.  My kids were all excited to go to a \"Turkish restaurant\" and meet \"Turkish people\" but the staff and the owner (I am guessing the man I saw was the owner), seemed indifferent. But whatever, this is not that big of a deal that it would effect my decision to come back or not. \n\nNow, for the food... I tried iskender kebab, and sucuklu-kasarli pide. The pide was good. In fact, bread related anything seemed good. They brought over some brick oven heated bread with butter and that was absolutely delicious! However, the iskender kebap was less than mediocre. It was way too soupy. The chef had put way too much of the red tomato sauce on top of the dish. and instead of having grilled tomato and grilled spicy jalepeno pepper like you would traditionally on such a plate, there was one measly tiny pickle jalape\u00f1o sitting on top of the soupy dish, oh, and a black pitted olive next to it. \n\nSince I come from Bursa, which is the heart of Turkey that makes the Iskender Kebap dish, I am a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to this dish. Even though I wasn't expecting it to be at the same standard, this dish was definitely less than mediocre with presentation and taste.", "author": "Sarah S."}

The 'Loin is its habitat, and has a feel of: a deli (deserts and some dish ingredients on display in a glass case)  / family run / try to remain true to authentic Turkish cuisine (although the cuisine varies quite a bit depending on the region in the homeland). A wide cultural swath of diners: tourists staying at the cheap hotels in the 'Loin, family's representing various ethnic heritages, wild eyed single diners.  \n\nSuper service, although it is is that varietal that needs to be summoned to take a request; the server was super responsive once a request was made. \n\nAlhambra Apartments sits across the street from A La Turca.

The pide is a french roll basically with melted cheese inside. Can't go wrong there. It was delicious but I only ate about half because it was filling. The chicken, side salad and white rice were excellent.\n\nFortunately, I still had room for dessert so had a baklava. It was like no other baklava I've had before -- large, moist and sweet. I almost went for the pistachio equivalent but stayed with what I knew.

I winced at the sight of the bread. It looked incredible. But the point of my visit here was to avoid bread and starches.\n\nI grabbed my bundle of A La Turca goodness and began walking back to the office.

I would stick to the hummus, soup, and eggplant, and leave the bread for someone else.\n\nAs soon as I arrived in the office I tried some of the soup. It was sadly a disappointment. It was watery and lacked flavor. I moved onto the hummus. It was fantastic with great flavor. The grilled eggplant was also quite good - but very oily and rich and I had trouble stomaching it. I stuck to the hummus and dipped carrots hungrily into it.\n\nBut that bread...\n\nThat bread still called to me. I made a deal with myself to just try a little of it. I broke it off. It was thick and doughy and still warm. Divine. I took a bite of it. It was incredible. Topped lightly with sesame seeds and bursting with softness. I couldn't help myself. I ate both servings of it with fervor. And then sat back down in my office chair looking at the crumbs around me.\n\nA La Turca isn't exactly going to be doing your waistline any favors. Most of their non-meat dishes are full of cheese and bread. But if you're OK with that - then by all means come here and go big. All of their pies are baked fresh on premises - as is their bread.

I've been wanting to come here for ages, so I finally convinced Jamie W. to take the overpacked 38 Geary to the heart of the Tenderloin to give this family-run place a try. It looks like what you'd expect... kinda like a big luncheonette deli with a big animated mural of Turkey on the long side wall.\n\nMenu items are quite traditional at least from my recollections of Istanbul restaurants. Execution feels very home-style like you're at a Turkish relative's house if you have Turkish relatives. I don't so I actually don't know what I'm talking about, and it wouldn't be the first time. Anyway, we started with a couple of appetizers. First up was the $4.25 Lahmacun, two mini-turnovers that look like spanikopita only with ground lamb and green peppers, tomato, onion and spices (see photo). Tasty though it's hard to go wrong with filo dough. Next was marginally disappointing, the $4.95 Kiymali Borek, which I was hoping would be like the roadside Turkish lamb pizza you can get at bus stops along the Turquoise Coast (see photo).\n\nNo such luck - it was just pastry wedges, a little overcooked, with ground meat, onions and spices slathered on top. Entrees continued the lamb theme, as well as the hit-and-miss average. Mine was quite good and relatively straightforward, the $11.75 Lamb Shish Kebab Platter, which is strictly cubes of roasted leg of lamb, marinated with spices, and served with their house rice, a side salad and a yogurt sauce (see photo). Delicious and unadorned. Jamie ordered the $11.25 Beyti Kebap Platter, another lamb dish, ground but wrapped in lavash and served with a yogurt sauce (see photo). It was just a fancied-up shawarma and not a very satisfying one at that.\n\nWe did love the desserts. Jamie ordered the $4.25 serving of Baklava, very sweet but genuinely irresistible. I went with rest-home bland and loved it... the $4.95 Sutlac, a little crock of rice pudding heavy on the milk and baked in he oven to produce a nice hard topping. Our bottom-line verdict is that we liked it, didn't love it. I think they do a good job serving up the platters of authentic food, but I have to admit it wasn't all that distinctive in flavor as I think back on the meal. Oh well, let me go back to my whirling...\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...authentic, home-style Turkish fare, a bit hit-and-miss but great desserts\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...love the mural, pretty casual\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...efficient for sure, not that warm\nTOTAL  - 3 stars...I still love turkey...and Turkey", "author": "Ed U."}

Well, now the donor is around 14.75 and the appetizers are 5.75.  Prices are still within reason but if they raise their prices one more time we might have to find another Turkish restaurant.

Hey, I said \"cheap date\" ok? Didn't say anything about being a cheap gf...\n\nBefore my Yelp days, I frequented A La Turca when I needed a kofte, doner, and sish fix. I liked it enough to come here a handful of times especially when two can leave stuffed for less than $30. \n\nMr. NSS never had Turkish food before and not wanting him to blow a gasket over the dinner bill, I thought A La Turca would be a good place to bring him. \n\nA La Turca is just as I remembered it, cobble stone entry way, an open kitchen with vertical spits, earthy toned d\u00e9cor, and a somewhat cozy dining room. \n\nWe started with the Kiymali Borek ($4.95) which is like a Turkish empanada filled with ground beef, onion and spices. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2PRgMkqX2dRrcuaJEi_1Rg?select=vkynJm-9v8XlNWnZZGJCxg#I_7wQteuJoh0I5v1tWpRJg Mediocre at best, the beef filling was both scant and dry. The dry pastry shell lacked a delicate flakiness. One of my favorite Turkish dishes is the Lamb Beyti ($11.25) which is ground lamb wrapped in lavash and then topped with garlic yogurt. Not here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2PRgMkqX2dRrcuaJEi_1Rg?select=vkynJm-9v8XlNWnZZGJCxg#glfQSYWyOsojumIMdogbtw Like a horrific aftermath of a gangbang (sorry, I just had to), the beyti was severely over-sauced with yogurt sauce making the lavash incredibly wet and soggy on the bottom. The Combo Grill Meat Platter ($13.50) \"used to\" be my go-to dish at A La Turca. Keywords: \"used to\". http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2PRgMkqX2dRrcuaJEi_1Rg?select=vkynJm-9v8XlNWnZZGJCxg#4EzU1IzD3oOaGn27J4GW_A The lamb sish (lamb cubes), kofte (lamb & beef patty), doner (shaved ground lamb and beef) & beef sish (beef cubes) were all very well-seasoned and flavorful, BUT they were ALL overcooked and dry. The doner was the worst of the quad and had the texture of shoe leather. \n\nService is pleasant as you would expect from a family-owned restaurant. We were one of three customers on a Monday night so the food came out fairly quickly but the times I've visited when it was busy, food service was very slow. \n\nIf you need a Turkish fix, go to Troya in Inner Richmond (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/troya-san-francisco#hrid:z2rd1mAYwRonuYfJdLRfHQ) and NOT the one in Pac Heights (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/troya-fillmore-san-francisco#hrid:XROisJ5mSrOCzn5QfBPMvg). \n\nMr. NSS: \"You must have come to A La Turca before you became expensive.\" \n\nMe: \"Excuse me... what did YOU just call me?!?!\"\n\n*Cricket Cricket*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

A La Turca was at the top of their list and it was Turkish, a cuisine I've always wanted to try. I ordered what 7x7 recommended, the Beyti Kabap and the Sucuk Pides. I had no idea what a pides was so I was happy to learn that it was cheesey goodness wrapped in the right amount of soft fluffy dough. The pides I order also had little bits of meat sausage in it. For the meat, I was expecting a different texture than a meat stick that's been slice into little pieces and mixed into the cheese. Still good.  \n\nMy Beyti Kabap was very good and plentiful.  Ground lamb mixed rolled in dough with a heaping of delicious yogurt. I think this dish was meant to be shared but piggy me at the whole thing. I also got some delicious bread to go with my meal. It came in two halves and I only had room to finish one. When I asked for a bag to take the other half home, the waiter brought out a bag with more bread in it to add to the slice I already had.  That was a nice surprise.  A bigger surprise came at the end of the meal when the waiter brought out this delicious cake that was soaked in honey. SO GOOD!!!\n\nI also wanted to add that I ordered the Turkish Coffee because I've never had it before.  It came in a little espresso cup and had a dark sludge at the bottom. I didn't know what to do with the sludge so I left it in the cup.  When the waiter came by to pick up my coffee, he looked at the sludge and said, \"What? You don't want your future to be told?\" Seriously, it was a weird moment. I didn't know what to say or do so I just smiled and he just laughed. \n\nOverall, it was a wonderful meal and I can't wait to go back and share this place with my husband.", "author": "Aimey T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-01", "description": "Guest Contributor:  The Wife\n\"Last night I went into the city with a friend of mine, to see the ballet. We were looking for a reasonably priced place to eat dinner beforehand, and although A La Turca's online menu does not have prices, we decided to give it a try.\n \nBoy, were we not disappointed! We arrived just at 6 PM, as on street parking becomes available. The place was nearly empty at that time, although it had filled up almost completely by the time we finished our meal.\n \nThe waiter who greeted us was friendly, and spent quite a bit of time chatting with us about his favorite dishes, and helping us decide what to order.\n \nWe ended up deciding to share a few items. Our meal began with the dolmas - stuffed grape leaves. They were tender and lemony, with just the right amount of seasoning. We also received a basket of pide - fluffy bread with just a light sprinkle of sesame and black nigella seeds for interest.\n \nWhen our entrees arrived, we decided to eat half from the plate in front of us, and switch. I thought my friend was going to change her mind, after taking a bite of her chicken Iskender. Unbelievably tender chicken from a spit, in a lovely spiced tomato and yogurt sauce, on top of cubes of pide, which soaked up the sauce and became delightfully soft and chewy. The Iskender was served with cacik, a yogurt sauce that complemented it perfectly.\n \nMy own dish was the chicken shish kebap, and I was not disappointed either. Fluffy white rice, flavorful in that wonderfully buttery way that rice can be. Beautifully seasoned and grilled cubes of chicken breast, along with a side of yogurt sauce that again complemented the chicken. And a light salad of lettuce and red cabbage that added some crunch and refreshment to the dish.\n \nThe only complaint I have is that our waiter did not take a drink order for us. We had to ask for water from another server. He made up for it, however, by bringing us complimentary glasses of tea with sugar lumps on the side, as we were finishing our meal.\n \nAgain for dessert, we decided to share. I ordered the sutlac, a rich and creamy baked rice pudding that was topped with crushed pistachios. Not too sweet, and absolutely delightful. My friend ordered the burma , a pinwheel of phyllo dough with honey and pistachios that was absolutely out of this world.\n \nA La Turca is definitely worth a try - it's even worth a drive into the city from wherever you reside. I'll definitely be returning.\"", "author": "Bob K."}

Enough for several people to nibble from and differentiate from like/dislike and of course, for that one guest, vegetarian.  For the meat lover in myself, I had to ensure the survival of my stability during long moments of witty repartee, so the Combo Doner (a large dish of chicken, lamb, and beef doner) usually is successful in satisfying the straying fingers roaming the spread across the kitchen counters.\n\nDining in this slightly enlarged hole in the wall would afford you a serving of lavash bread.

I ordered tripe soup to begin with based on the head waiter's recommendation. After that, a lovely waitress (she is from Switzerland I guess) came to take our orders. I told her that I had ordered tripe soup but she said they don't serve it, and they only serve lentil soup. Obviously, she had no idea what's on the menu for the day. My friends and I went on ordering our entrees. I ordered the Doner plate. The tripe soup was cold and tasteless.  I sent it back. The waitress did not ask me why or what the problem was. She was just interested if I had some so that she'd charge me for it. Sensing this by her looks, I said that I would pay for it but I wanted lentil soup. The lentil soup had average Middle Eastern taste, not Turkish at all. The Doner plate had plenty of meat and rice, yet I had way better doner at places that are not even Turkish. So this place, even though its name is A La Turca, does not serve neither Turkish lentil soup nor Turkish doner. \n\nThe service: I know the culture of tipping and I know how little waiters make on tips. I had just left a %30 tip at a great restaurant yesterday. Here, I left a pretty mean tip. When I walked over to hand the check myself(!) and get my takeouts (which no one cared to bring to me); I told the waitress that I wish I would leave more but that we didn't enjoy the food at all. I was trying to be nice actually, I did not want to comment on her service. She responded \"Sir, this is not an excuse\". Although, I sympathize and understand where she is coming from, if she needs an excuse, I actually could give a handful. She didn't know what's on the menu, she brought a cold soup (which is easy to notice), she didn't ask how our meal was, she clearly avoided us. Not that I need an excuse to leave a bad tip, the service was not even average. I've had waitresses literally asking how my meal is for 2-4 times. So, service is not good and don't care to play nice.\n\nThey treated us tea, which was appropriate and necessary for a Turkish restaurant. \n\nPretty disappointed.

The food is wonderful. The Turkish beer is great.  The decor, charming. \n\nSo here's what happened. My Turkish friend swears by this place and wanted to take me to dinner here the other night. We call ahead to see if they are busy (this is at 9:00PM precisely. The waitress (who I will call waitress 1, she is shorter with a short haircut with curly light brown hair) answers the phone and tells my friend that they are closing at 9:30PM because there are no customers. My friend tells her that we want to come in and will be there before 9:30.  Waitress 1 puts up a rude fight but says that if we get there before 9:30 we can eat. We race over there and are in the door by 9:20. When we come in the girl gets a snide smile on her face and says they are doing to-go only. After some persistance, and mentioning she had said we could eat as long as we came in before 9:30, she allows us to sit down. We order 2 beers and something my friend said in Turkish that sounded like \"Chicken bay-eece\" I don't know what it was called on the menu but anyway it was good. Waitress one goes over to waitress 2  (a taller girl with her top two center teeth chipped and long black hair in a low ponytail with really crunchy tight curls)and they stare at us and talk bitchily about us and even go over to their only customer's table, a young male, and talk about us to him. He loudly responded \"I wouldn't do that\" so obviously trying to say he wouldn't have insisted on dining if they were trying to close. An old man came in around 9:40 and they turned him away which was really sad. Anyway long story short the 2 waitresses come over and get in this catty fight with us and waitress 1 keeps saying they had to close because of a graduation in the back then starts telling us we are \"inexceptable\". My friend said she thought the girl was trying to say \"renovation\" not graduation. The whole thing is stupid anyway because on the phone she had said they were closing because of lack of business which again didn't make sense because there was a customer in the restaurant. So out of nowhere waitress 2 yells that they were in fact having pest control. Greeat.... But the ridiculous thing was waitress 1 started getting so bitchy and confrontational that waitress 2 had to tell her in Turkish to go away. So then waitress 2 started tellign us they didn;t want to lose their jobs and all of this other nonsense and we told them we didn;t want them to lose their jobs either we just wanted to dine in peace. the funniest part is, if we had been seated right away and allowed to eat without them coming over and having a 10 minute fight with us, we would have been out of there by 9:45. Nevertheless we left only a couple minutes after 10PM. \n\nI think waitress 1 should pick a different profession and waitress 2 needs to resort to the type of attitude she took on once she got scared for her job before the condescending BS she pulled off the get telling us the reason they were staring at us is because we were her customers and she needed to be sure we were happy with the bitchiest most sarcastic tone and facial expression ever. Oh! and waitress 1 even admitted to having been glaring at me the whole time, when I asked her why she had been doing that she said it was because our behavior was inexceptable. GREAT customer service!!!  Doesn't even have the brain to deny having glared at us lol.", "author": "Emma H."}

Hungry for something from the generally middle east / central Asia geographical area, we walked in on a Sunday afternoon.  Seeing it was about 95 degrees inside and 75 outside on the sidewalk (albeit with three patrons smoking right by the entrance and the prospect of of visits from from the street people around there) we opted for the outside option.  We let the manager know we were outside and they told us they'd send someone out.  The waitress nodded.  About 15 minutes later without seeing any staff, I walked in and grabbed a menu myself.  After another 15 waitressless minutes, I walked in and ordered directly from the chef who seemed sympathetic.   \"10 minutes\" he said.  We knew from the Yelp highlights that the chicken beyti was popular as were the \"pides\" though there were like ten choices of those.  So we asked for a recommendation and the counter person said \"You like meat? then definitely get sujuk and cheese.\"  Another 15-20 minutes later the food came out.  So until this point they're rockin about 0.5 stars.  But then, the PIDE, THAT SUJUK AND CHEESE PIDE. HFS it was money.  Rich, fresh, hot, toasty, just a bit of spice, just enough cheese to balance the bread.  Perfect.  \n\nYes, the chicken beyti looked cool with the colorful sauces on it, but that was pretty much it: a hottie with nothing inside worth dealing with.\n\nAnyway, we got out of there pretty soon after.  Going by previous experience, we didn't wait for the check, just walked up to the register to pay it. Maybe they just had a rough staffing day, who knows. The three visits we enjoyed from street people (including one pretty rough flower vendor) definitely added some variety to the meal, but it's not for everyone.

But, here I was at A La Turca, less than 1 week after returning from Istanbul, craving Turkish food. Armed with the 4 Turkish phrases i knew, I was ready to be transported back to Istanbul.\n\nWe started off the meal with piyaz (white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion) and lentil soup. The seasoning of the piyaz was fine, but the white beans were a bit underdone for my preference.  The lentil soup was really good. The lentils, rice, carrots, onion, potato and spices combined to create a savory, thick combination that surpassed many of the lentil soups I had in Turkey. \n\nI had the grilled kofte plate (ground meat with seasoning and spices made into patties and grilled.) Sadly, this kofte was nothing like the tender, juicy meatball sausage/patties that I had at local koftecerias in Istanbul. The kofte was strangely tough and I struggled to finish half.\n\nThe saving grace of the meal was the combo doner plate.  While the beef and lamb doner seemed a bit overdone, the chicken was delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I noted that this chicken was better than most chicken I had in Turkey.  \n\nWe ended the meal with Turkish coffee and Kunefe (Baked kadayif with sweet cheese). The kunefe was excellent: slightly sweet, gooey from the cheese, and crunchy from the baked noodles. \n\nWhile I was severely disappointed from the kofte and piyaz, the lentil soup, chicken doner, turkish coffee and kunefe made up for the meal. \n\nA La Turca, tesekkur ederim (thank you) for the delicious food and friendly service.

Well, let me explain.\n\nMy group of 7 came into the restaurant and were seated at a long table near the door. I got excited when talking to some of my friends and knocked my water all over the table. The waiter man came quickly to clean it and refill my water.\n\nLooking at the menu, everything looked foreign to me. I don't have any idea what Turkish food will be like, so I just picked the chicken beyti, as recommended by the waiter. \n\nNo regrets with the food. The chicken beyti was great! My friend exclaimed, \"it tastes like a Hot Pocket!\" I'm not sure I completely agree with her in that regard. The beyti is a wrap with chicken on the inside and a large portion of yogurt sauce and some red sauce for dipping. The shell of the wrap was nice and crispy, and all of the sauces were excellent with it. I was thoroughly satisfied with my meal.\n\nMy friend and I decided that we also wanted to try some Turkish coffee and dessert. So we went up to the register and asked for some coffee and a recommendation for dessert. We asked the younger lady for some baklava and 2 coffees. We stood around for a little bit, and then asked if we would be paying now or with the rest of our bill. When she realized that we weren't walk-in customers, and that we had been eating at a table for the past half hour, she got angry because she had already put the baklava in a to-go box and not a plate. The waiter who had been serving us for the evening told us to go ahead and have a seat and he'll bring out our dessert and coffee. The coffee came cutely in a little cup, and was bitter in a way that doesn't make you scrunch up your face while drinking. There was a thick layer of grain powder at the bottom of the cup. My friend and I realized afterward that we were supposed to stir it first. The baklava was moist, oozing out honey with each bite. I found it quite enjoyable.\n\nThe bill came, and our table paid. We sat around and talked for maybe 10 minutes. And then this older Turkish woman with short black hair and a red apron comes over and says, \"You guys want anything else? If not, please leave. There's no room here, it's cramped in here.\" My friends and I looked around the restaurant. No one waiting at the door. At least 5 tables open for more customers. And yet she wanted us to leave? We got up and left, and that was it.\n\nWhile the first impression was great, I was left with a sour impression of the establishment. That last impression of the woman kicking us out is enough to keep me from coming back here ever!", "author": "Emily T."}

Every single dish was spot on, from white beans to lamb shank to phylo concoction.  The ayran (salty yogurt) was thin enough to serve as a drink, but had a substantial and pleasant flavor like a dish - lays down the gauntlet for the local Indian restaurants to step up their lassi.  \n\nAlthough unappealing and a little scary from the sidewalk (folk art pastoral murals of the homeland framed by stone walls is so 1970s), once you get in, the atmosphere is really cool - comforting...  The staff is very personable, real people and they're nice.  The menu is fairly extensive.  If you're only casually acquainted with Mediterranean cuisine, kebabs and hummus and such, you'll find lots of new things, and variants on what you know.\n\nBeing incredibly inexpensive is a big plus - it's priced only slightly above fast food: $8-11 for some of the main meals, $5 for desserts, $14 for a 6-salad appetizer plate for 2 (that could really be 4), each one better than the other.  And this is for sit down full service food at fine dining quality for taste and presentation.  Also, it's relatively healthy.  Things are a lot lighter than I'm used to.  Hummus was light on the tahini, the eggplant dip had none.\n\nIt's a good go to place that you could make into a regular hangout.", "author": "Gil S."}

I've had Turkish food from many Turkish restaurants and in peoples homes while there. A La Turca is solid. It's not great like the food back in Turkey is great - that's just impossible. \n\nThat said, I was happy with my experience here tonight. I've eaten here many times before but this was my first experience since I started eating meat again. My guest for the evening was my very handsome 12 year old kid. \n\nMenu:\n\nPatlican Biber Kizartmasi and Lahmacun as appetizers. I liked the Kizartma quite a bit. The Lahmacun was alright in my book but it wasn't something I would write home about. I think next time I might just get a regular pide. \n\nAdana and doner kebabs. Both were delicious.We each had a cup of ayran and topped off our meal by sharing a bowl of sutlac. Our bill for the meal, with tip, was $54.00. \n\nI really liked the Adana kebab but I had always been told it's a spicy kebab. Their Adana kebab, while flavorful, was definitely not spicy. There's a strong chance it's been made a bit milder for American palates. I give their chef credit for serving meat that seems perfectly cooked. Their pilav is pretty darn good, too. \n\nI would like their red cabbage on the salad to be a bit more like the pickled red cabbage that's served in Turkey. It may sound like an odd criticism but Turkish style pickled red cabbage is sublime. \n\nAll in all I am a happy camper. I'll be back to try some yummy stuff with the kiddo. It's a fun way to spend a Saturday evening and it's good for him to enjoy the food of his father's culture. The service here is good, too!

Price wasn't too bad. My friend had the eggplant salad.. I wouldn't recommend that. Looked like purple apple sauce haha but he said it wasn't too bad.\n\nThe waiter was kind and accommodating, but he seemed to be the only one. The rest of the staff kind of stood in the bad watching everyone and talking amongst themselves. Not sure if they even did anything productive while I was there. There was a large group of people next to us when we first got there and they were having a good time, but their kids were running amuck. I know it's not the establishment's fault, but they could have said something and asked the parents to keep their kids quieter. I guess this is just indicative of the crowd that normally goes there? Shortly afterwards there were maybe 4 or 5 kids left and some adults. None of them were actually at a table and the kids were crowded up against me and my party. They were loud, rude, SITTING ON MY COAT that I had put down next to me on the bench, and actually were staring at us! Kind of like the workers, but more blatantly. Again, not the establishments fault.. but indicative of the crowd that goes there. --- Yet another reason to add to my list of why I stay away from places in the tenderloin area.\n\nAfter paying the bill, within five minutes a lady came up and said we needed to leave if we weren't going to buy anything else.

It's not that much different than what you might expect to find at a falafel house either.  That is to say, the food at A La Turca tastes vaguely middle-eastern to me.\n\nAs such, I ordered the same thing I had at  Old Jerusalem, a bowl of lentil soup and a sandwich.  The doner sandwich is somewhat akin to a shawarma, except the bread is different, and I liked the version I had at A La Turca better than the one at Old Jerusalem.

The spinach and cheese pastries are also good.

It came with some rice, a little mixed salad, dipping sauce and of course the oh-so-delicioso grilled chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasoning. The first thing I thought was, \"omg, i need to bring my sister here\". She's a super foodie and would LOVE this place. \nMy BF had the doner platter and was happy with it until he tried my chicken...then he was upset that he didn't get the chicken. \nWe also ordered a plate of hummus which was good, but not anything to rave about.

Someone suggested this place and it looked good and was close to where we were, so I choose this place. Since it is Memorial Day Weekend, I figured Fisherman's Wharf and the more touristy areas would be packed. I was right, it was. This place wasn't in a touristy area and parking on the street was free which was great.\n\nThis is a small and casual place. I think you just sit where you want as no waitress came up to us. There was only one waitress there but she was fast and efficient. We ordered the hummus and spinach and cheese pie for the appetizer. The hummus was good. I could tell it was fresh. The pie was strange. It's basically a Mexican tortilla filled with cheese and spinach. The cheese tasted a little off like it wasn't that fresh.\n\nThe complimentary bread was really good. It was hot and fresh. As for the main entrees, I ordered the  Combo Doner which is #66 on the menu. It comes with chicken, beef, and lamb doner with salad and rice. My husband got a falafel sandwich. My order was just the right size, not too big, not too small. Unlike most places, I didn't get a ton of rice and got a generous serving of salad drenched with olive oil. The meat was good but I noticed I didn't get any chicken, only red meat. \n\nI didn't care about that though as I was hungry and liked what I got anyways. My husband had no complaints. His falafel wrap was huge. There is a parking structure right next to this place if none on the street is available. For those of you watching your budget, this is a good place to go as S.F can be pricey at most places, even casual ones. Here are the prices for what we got:\n\nHummus: $4.75\n\nSpinach and Cheese Pide: $7.50\n\nCombo Doner: $9.75\n\nFalafel: $6.75\n\nSoda: $1.50\n\nNot bad. And since we've been affected by the recession like most people, this was a good place to go. If we had more money to spend on food and not have to worry about paying the mortgage on our house and other bills, we would go to more expensive places. \n\nToday my husband surprised me by asking me if I'd like to go on a cruise to Hawaii in the fall or winter. I think this might be my Christmas gift this year-:) I sure hope so. That would be great. Of course, a European trip would be better, but we had to put off our annual trip to Europe for now because of the recession.  The business that he owns has slowed down since the recession got worse. Hawaii is great though. I've been there before and loved it! It is as beautiful as it is on TV and books. I hope I didn't make anyone too jealous, lol.", "author": "Butterfly A."}

You can only get this at Turkish restaurants! It was delicious, as was the chicken and mushroom pide. My friend ordered the Combo platter which was just as good.

In fact, they provide even better service than I receive at some high-end restaurants.  \n\nWe started with the baba ghanouj -- the roasted eggplant cold appetizer.  It was light fluffy lemony and a subtle smokiness and hint of tahini.

Lots of seasoning, juicy inside with a nice crust on the outside.  Last time I got the Doner Combo (chicken, beef and lamb) which was also amazing.  I got four Kofke patties --- which is more meat than you'd expect to get for only ten bucks.

And we've been pretty good. This is our second lunch in 4 months. Not bad at all considering we are very busy career-girls.\n\nI chose A La Turca because I've been here before with a someone who lived in Turkey for years. He even ordered in Turkish and connected with the staff at A La Turca. We sampled cold and hot appetizers, pides (pies) and platters. He guaranteed that the food was good and authentic.\n\nVenue:  A little hole in the wall in the TL. Nice dining spot for pre-theatre dinner before catching a show at the Opera House or Symphony.  \n\nParking:  Garage is conveniently located next to A La Turca.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: Casual and relaxed. Long seats and tables were covered with rich tapestries. Minimal Turkish decorations. Very clean and neat.\n\nGirls' Bathroom: Very clean and spacious with a stained glass window.\n\nSocial Scene: Sparse Mediterranean crowd at 11:45 am.\n\nService: Very friendly but slow despite the lack of diners.\n\nFood:  My gf and I were only able to sample two dishes this time:\n1. GF:  #61 Falafel Platter (served with hummus, tahini sauce and salad)\n2. Me:  #53 Iskender Platter (Vertically roasted and sliced ground lamb and beef in special tomato sauce over bread served with butter and yogurt)\n3. I washed down my spicy dish with a strong glass of Turkish Tea which came with 2 sugar cubes (although it tasted like Lipton to me.)\n\nMy platter was delicious!  I broke my \"no-meat diet\" but it was worth it. The meat was tender. The sauce was full of flavors. Some of the bread cubes were crunchy and haven't completely soaked up the sauce but it was still very good.  I bet it was better with yogurt but being I was Lacto  I regrettably skipped it.\n\nRecommend:  \n1. A La Turca is a notch above your regular Mediterranean restaurants because there are much more to choose from.  There are 8 Cold Appetizers, 6 Hot Appetizers,  8 Sandwiches,  Soups and Salads, 20 Savory Pies From the Grill or the Oven, 16 Platters,  Desserts and even Kids' Meals.\n\n2. The dishes at A La Turca are fun to share with friends.   Their dishes are definitely not boring.  Bring a sense of adventure along with your appetite!  Yummy!\n\nJax and I both enjoyed our lunch and made more vows to have more girl-bonding lunches within our hour or so weekday lunchbreaks. \n\nTab:  $23.00 with tax not including tip.\n\nNOTE TO SELF:  Jax paid this time.

When I walked back to get MY order I had to wait 20 minutes for them to remake it.  No apology, nothing.

After 20 minutes I notice people that walked in after me already eating, and I was still waiting for my sandwich.  I walk up to the woman at the counter to check on my food and she admits (embarrassingly) that she forgot to put the order in.  Another 15 minutes goes by and I finally get my food..... I get home and its the worst piece of crap sandwich I've ever had, and they forgot to include the side of babaganoush that I paid for.  Yeah, its my fault for not triple-checking my order and giving them the benefit of the doubt, but COME ON.  \n\nFinal Analysis:  This place sucks.

I am extremely picky about my bread, who thinks that only bread from Tartine is worth mentioning and never buys bread from supermarket. I really have to say, probably one of the best bread I've had. It's like a Naan, but thicker, or a soft thick pizza dough. It's a little bit salty and buttery, with some sesame seeds on top. Yummm.....\n\nThe Lahmacun is my dream pizza that I've had when I was traveling in Italy. It was this small pizzeria Le Volpe in Urbania, that had the most amazingly thin and crispy pizza dough that I've never encountered afterwards until I found A La Turca. Thin and crispy, almost feather light. When the dough comes so thin, a big problem they need to deal with is the moisture in the topping, but A La Turca does it right! Lahmacun has ground beef, lamb, gree pepper, onion, tomato, nicely seasoned, makes a great light warm appetizer. It comes with 4 pieces and salad, so great for sharing.\n\nThe Combo Doner was THE ONLY platter that our waitress recommended. \"What dinner platters do  you recommend for 2 people to share?\" \"Combo Doner is the best.\" \"What about the Iskender Kebab?\" \"It's good, but Combo Doner is the best.\" \"What about the Lamb Shish Hebab?\" \"Good but Combo Doner is the best.\" \"What about @#$%^????\" \" \"Good but Combo Doner is the best.\"  \"Good but Combo Doner is the best.\"  \"Good but Combo Doner is the best.\"  \"Good but Combo Doner is the best.\"  \"Good but Combo Doner is the best.\" Yes she repeated like 20 times. I guess....Combo Doner it is. It's thin sliced lamb and chicken, with rice and salad. The lamb was pretty amazing, especially with the yogurt sauce.\n\nLamb Shish Kebab is soooooo juicy! I love lamb, especially leg of lamb. I make pretty amazing braised lamb shank, but it's so nice to have some flavorful lamb that's NOT cooked for 10 hours and melt in your mouth. I like to chew my meat.\n\nDont get the Baklava, it's too sweet, soggy, and greasy, although they use pistachio. Get the Baklava from Philz Coffee which is made by Oasis Bakery in Fremont.

The bread that came with it, again moist and warm from being fresh out of the oven.  In my opinion, the overall quality of a Mediterranean restaurant can be judged by the tzatziki sauce (don't know if that's what the Turkish call it too) which was great here, but I've had better.\n\nAs a graphic designer, I'll say don't be fooled by the crappy design of the menus vs. the nice pictures posted here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-23", "description": "There were no daily specials on the day we went to A La Turca, but the regular menu was exciting enough.  We started with cups of Turkish tea (which I enjoyed without adding the sugar cubes).  The combo platter under the \"cold appetizer\" section contained hummus, eggplant salad, piyaz (white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion), ezme (crushed roasted red and green bell pepper, tomato, onion, parsley), stuffed grape leaves, and cacik (yogurt with cucumber, mint, dill, and garlic).  The hummus was excellent: smooth, creamy, and the perfect accompaniment to the flatbread.  I'm not a fan of beans normally, but the rest of my party loved the bean salad.  The ezme looked like a salsa, but had a very subtle taste that also went well with the flatbread.  We also enjoyed the ispanakli borek from the \"hot appetizer\" section, which was a pastry dough, baked with feta cheese and spinach.  This was perhaps my favorite appetizer because the spinach with pastry is a perfect combination of textures and tastes.\n\nAmong our entrees, we had one disappointment.  We ordered a flatbread with mushroom and goat cheese, but modified it to have mozzarella and tomatoes as well.  Unfortunately, the resulting flatbread was bland and tasteless.  Adding tomatoes should not have resulted in such a boring dish -- perhaps a bit of feta would have punched it up a bit?\n\nWe ordered two lamb dishes as well, both of which were significantly better than the flatbread.  First, the adana kebab is skewered minced lamb flavored with special herbs and spices.  While the minced meat itself was definitely flavorful, the taste of the herbes/spices overpowered the lamb itself.  The highlight was the rice, which went perfectly with the intense adana kebab.  We also ordered the lamb sish kebab, which was more subtly spiced and thus had a more pungent lamb taste (which was appreciated by all).\n\nFor dessert, we ended with the baklava, which was too syrupy sweet, and the sutlac (rice pudding), which was delicately sweetened and had a wonderfully thick consistency.\n\nThere were some inconsistencies in the quality of the food here: the good dishes were great, while their interpretations of some dishes were lacking.  I would definitely give this restaurant another chance to improve their rating.", "author": "Jim W."}

The food has always been up and down, depending on who is cooking.  The main cook has been here since it opened (a fairly tall fellow with thick black hair and a prominent nose) and is very good and takes pride in his work -- when he is working, the salads are fresh, the vegetables grilled perfectly, the meat tender and moist, the portions fairly generous.  But when he's not there, watch out ... the back-up cooks (and there have been several) are very stingy with the rice and tend to overcook the meat and use older, wilted vegetables.  Last week I ordered a dish to go and the salad was inedible (tasted like it was left over from the day before and had an acidic taste), the chicken was dried out, and the rice was almost non-existent (spread thinly over the bottom of the plate).  A terrible meal (I should have known not to order when the main cook wasn't there) but I was very busy, so I didn't take it back.  The head cook always cooks on weekend nights, so I figured it was safe to call in my order last night.  I did, and when I picked it up was shocked to find that the prices have been raised across the board, and the cost of the dish I usually order had been raised 40%!!!!  I know the cost of ingredients has gone up, but raising prices 40% all at once -- especially when the food can be as inconsistent as it is here -- did not sit well at all.

Framed by large plate glass windows, it beckons you into a wide open space gleaming sickly with cheap fluorescent lighting, guaranteed to make anyone look at least a few shades more sallow. To your right, quiet chefs in a cramped space work with great economy of movement, separated from hungry clientele by a only a too-small divider and a display case offering tubs of various salads, dips, and whatever else they've felt like making that evening. Almost certainly one of the raven-haired waitresses, who looks remarkably similar to her partner, will direct you to a utilitarian but eminently functional table and get you settled efficiently but with no great warmth - it takes a few visits before they'll warm up to you, but have no fear that they shall, with a modicum of effort on your part. Given some of the things I've seen area patrons try to pull on them, however, their reserve comes as no surprise. \n\nWhen it comes time to make the always difficult decision of what to eat, I find myself usually drawn to the plain and simple falafel sandwich - a delightful creation consisting of a thick stack of crunchy, fresh spheres combined with a straight-up salad, liberally mixed with a yogurt sauce and enclosed in either lavash or pita; you had better order the lavash however, seeing as you're in a Turkish restaurant.  The greens snap deliciously under the assault of teeth, with the falafel providing just enough body and oil to make everything go down just right. Anything from the menu that includes their homemade dough is also a safe bet - you can usually see them preparing the next batch right there on the spot, and the painstaking preparation really comes through upon consumption.

A litle meat-heavy, but that' not a bad thing.  We had the combo plate appetizer with tons of babagonoush, hummus, and dolma.  I had the combination kebab plate, with a variety of meats on a bed of rice.  Overall, it was good food at a very fair price.\n\nWe went again last night, but we weren't as hungry as before, so we ordered the dolma appetizer (rice wrapped in grape leaves).  It was like $5.95 and seriously, we got four small dolma.  That's more expensive than sushi, and these should not be that expensive.  It was borderline ripoff!\nI had the ground lamb beyti, which are wrapped in lavash bread and in a red sauce with sour cream.  It was pretty good, and I liked the sauce, which made this dish less dry than a kebab plate with rice would be.  My wife had the sucuk and cheese gozlome, which is a sort of crepe with spiced beef sausage and mozarella cheese in it.  \nIt was definitely a bit on the small side; I could easily eat two if I were hungry.  But this particular sucuk was very salty and a bit gamey; it tasted far more like goat than it did beef.\n\nOverall, I would've given A La Turca four stars based on our first visit; this second visit was a borderline 1-2 star experience, so I am giving A La Turca two stars for this review.

When it came out the pastry dough was flaky but it tasted stale, and there were bites of the ground beef that were on the wrong side of luke warm.\n\nLahmacun (#13) was a bit better.  Very fresh, thin crust right out of the oven but the \"ground meat\" (it didn't say on the menu, but I suspect it was lamb) didn't have the strong, spiced flavors you'd expect from Turkish food. \n\nThe saving grace was the doner (#51), which was excellent.  The thinly sliced pieces of lamb and beef were fragrant and peppery and crispy on the edges.  The pide bread was stale though, again probably from yesterday.\n\nService was fine, tables clean, Turkish on the radio and TV -- what you'd expect from a Bargain Bite on SFGate.

I saw A La Turca directly across the street so I whipped out my iPad and checked out the ratings.  I was curious about Turkish food as I had never eaten in a Turkish restaurant, so I decided to try it.\n\nMeh.\n\nThe pluses - the places is spotlessly clean (and that's kind of important if you're eating in the Tenderloin, because the neighborhood is skeevy so you want your T'loin restaurant to PROVE they care about cleanliness).  And, the waitress was friendly and efficient.\n\nI ordered an appetizer which was supposed to be meat mixed with tomato on bread, with other veggies.  What I got was a miniature tomato pizza with no taste of meat, with some raw lettuce, red onion and I believe bell pepper in the middle of the plate.  The bread/crust was very crispy and thin.  Not in a good way.  It was like eating crackers with warm tomato sauce on them.  No, that makes it sound worse than it was.  It was OK.  Healthy I guess.\n\nThen I ordered the combo doner sandwich.  On the waitress's recommendation I got it on pita bread.  It came wrapped in aluminum foil - a HUGE sandwich stuffed with lamb and chicken.  The pita bread had been fried I believe (or grilled after being brushed with oil).  So, a bit greasy to start with.  The lamb unfortunately was not memorable.  it didn't really taste like lamb and it was salty.  The chicken was in little cubes and did not taste like chicken meat that comes right off a chicken, it almost tasted like pressed food like Spam.  It was also a bit too salty for my taste.  Aside from that and I believe a few onions, there were no spices or flavorings.  I was so hungry I just kept eating and eating even though with each bite I was thinking \"this is missing something!\" so about 2/3 of the way through I asked for some yogurt and she immediately brought me a little dish of flavored yogurt that I poured all over the sandwich.  After that, it tasted better but - still missed the mark.  \n\nAnyway, it's a good value for the money, and I only tried two things, but I would not come back here.  I hope that this is not what Turkish food tastes like because I was pretty disappointed in the lack of spices and flavorings, the greasy pita bread and the meats that were just not happening for me.", "author": "Alexandra D."}

I love falafel... but perhaps I just don't know any better? Is this how it is supposed to be? Will I just have to go find some new Turkish friends to school me on the fine art of a good falafel? This place was recommended by a Turkish friend... could there be two menus... for Turks and non Turks? Hmmm... ok...

I don't know the name of the dish I got, but it consisted of ground lamb wrapped in what seemed kinda like a tortilla(not quite pita bread), with a tomato sauce and a yogurt sauce on it.  It tasted really good.  My gf got the falafel plate...she only got like 4 smallish flalafels which seemed kinda skimpy to me.  We also grabbed a beef/phyllo pastry which was pretty good.  A bit pricey for the size of the portions, but it was pretty fast.", "author": "Brett T."}

Offered a wide variety of delicious Turkish cuisine that is not often offered at most Middle Eastern restaurants.  Both families felt everything from appetizers to desert were truly authenticate and well prepared.\n\nThe appetizers like Baba Ghanouj, Borek, Dolma, Sigara Boregi and Lentil Soup were all delcicious.  The kids loved the Sigara Boregi.\n\nFor main courses I had Iskendar Kebab.  Doner (Gyro) meat served with cubed bread with a tomato sauce and side of yogurt.  It was excellent and I rarely see it on menus.  It was a real treat.  My wife had Kofte which was also delicous.  The sandwiches looked great, as well.  \n\nThe service was excellent.

The eggplant appetizer was a good start with the Turkish bread. Good way to start the meal. The best dish in my opinion is definitely the chicken beyti (also recommended by our waitress). It's like,  pieces of chicken wrapped in their lavash bread topped with a well spiced tomato sauce and yogurt. It's very good and everyone at our table thought so.  A pide, according to waitress, is like a calzone, but Turkish of course. This was also not bad, and as I'm more of a potato person, I enjoyed the potato &cheese over the spinach one. Nice and piping hot. Chicken and cheese gozleme, well I suppose it really was like a Turkish quesadilla as said by Patrick M, but not so much cheese in it.  Lastly, the sutlac, which was like a rice pudding sort of dessert (served cold) was quite good as well. A nice taste to the palette after all the spices and yogurt sauce from the meal.  \n\nOverall, not too bad of deal, with our tab coming out  under 70$ for 5 people. Service was not bad, although we did have some mixup in the ordering aspect. The meal definitely makes me want to go to Turkey.", "author": "Yosie G."}

I've been here five or six times, most recently about a month ago, and ordered several different dishes. Never been disappointed yet.\n\nThe reason to come here is, without a doubt, the bread. If you're a fan of bread, you will really appreciate the miracles they perform in their kitchen; if you're not a fan yet, you will be. They do bring bread to the table regardless of what you order, and it's heavenly, but I strongly recommend ordering a main dish that also has a bread component. \n\nI think my all-time favorite is the pide (basically a baked sandwich) stuffed with lamb beef doner and mozzarella. Even if you're not into lamb, I'd still recommend it because theirs is not gamey at all. I'm a pretty decent baker myself and I tried my best to replicate this dish at home, but their version is so delectable you won't believe it. It comes in an oval shape, slit down the middle vertically so all the goodies inside are bursting out, and sliced horizontally. Yummy yummy yummy!\n\nAlso outstanding is the lentil soup. I usually don't like lentils, but this is to die for. You can order it separately as an appetizer, or if you order one of the specials it comes with the meal. Dipping the bread into the soup is one of life's little joys.\n\nI've had all the desserts and they're fabulous, especially the kunefe. It's a shredded pastry with sweet cheese, syrup, and pistachios. After having one of the pides (along with the bread/soup appetizer) you may feel you can't possibly squeeze this in, but you should.

I downgraded one star because of the television, but at least the sound isn't on.  They have your typical middle eastern stuff (humous, falafel, etc), but also some things I hadn't eaten before, like lamachoun (spelling!), and pides (I love the potatoe and cheese ones).  If you like meat, the lamb chops are great.  I'm also a fan of their lentil soup - definitely add some lemon to it.  The bread is out of this world.", "author": "sunny o."}

I almost expected my waitress to emerge with a cigarette (replete with inch-long ash) dangling from her bottom lip.  Wouldn't it  be rad if I married her and she read this and it totally ruined our future?  Anyway, I got a sandwich that was actually a 12-foot lamb filled pastry lacquered with Pam.  It was so fucking good!   My girlfriend got some pussy-ass dinner like half a sesame seed or something, totally ruining  my usual 'one date, two dinners' M.O.  Yes, I basically call her a jerk if she doesn't give me all her food.  Remember, I am fat.  I felt really original ordering the Turkish Coffee and remembered that the last guy who read my leaves breathed through an oxygen tank so I felt like I let him down when he revealed my fate was a pretty staid affair.  Next to us was seated an obnoxious family with one of those really loud moms and the dad that doesn't say a fucking word but you just know he's preoccupied with which size shotgun to use.", "author": "J P."}

Roughly speaking it's fairly similar to Greek food but with more heat and spice. The space is comfortable and the high ceilings make it seem larger than it is. There's not much decor but the vibe is still pleasant and welcoming. We were a large group on a Friday evening and we had the entire semi-private upstairs area to ourselves which was really nice. The short wine list has some interesting choices from California, Italy and of course Turkey. I went for one of the cheaper options, Salmon Creek Pinot Grigio, which was just fine and worked with the dishes we enjoyed. For appetizers, we had Eggplant Salad, Piyaz, Ezme and Hummus. The Eggplant Salad is nicely baked eggplant with red and green pepper, onion, parsley, lemon juice and olive oil. The vegetables work nicely together and the lemon juice lightens the dish a bit. Piyaz is white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion, lemon juice and olive oil all tossed together. It's tasty and the generous amount of beans makes it fairly hearty as well. The Ezme, crushed and roasted red bell pepper with tomato and onion and spices, is served on grilled pita bread and it works as a simple starter. The Hummus was quite tasty as well, though not as thick as I usually like. The appetizers are all under $5 a pop so it's not a bad idea to sample a bit. We also shared various platters for our entrees. The Doner, or beef sirloin and lamb spiced and roasted and thinly sliced, was tasty and the meat was nice and tender. There's also a Chicken Doner with the same preparation and presentation. We also had a few of the Kebab options which all had the same spice but all were nicely prepared and the meat wasn't overdone. We couldn't resist the Sucuk and Cheese pide, which was really tasty. Not sure about the Chicken and Pineapple combo on a pide, but I'd be curious to try it if I go back. There also are a few soups and salads and a short kid's menu. Alaturca is a cute and laid-back spot that's great for a casual meal, and definitely works for big groups. Hope you have the opportunity to pop by sometime.", "author": "Leah B."}

I think I'm spoiled by other regions of Mediterranean food - that I honestly prefer. The things I did like was how amazingly tender our beef kabob was. The interesting thing is that the normal tzaziki sauce that is served at other places is very watery here, but it's still good... I think my biggest beef with the place was the lack of overusage of garlic in their dishes - which proved quite satisfying after leaving but a bit empty upon stuffing my mouth. The rice has a great buttery texture. Not a fan of the salad that comes with it - i'd rather have a \"greek\" salad. Enjoyed the warm turkish bread that came with our hummus. Sorry that was quite the hodge podge of thoughts. :(", "author": "Jeannette L."}

My friend and I went in and enjoyed the \"ethnic\" setting, but their meat counter kind of threw me off. Whatever. So we ordered right way: I got the Chicken Iskender and my friend got the Doner and K\u00fcnefe. My dish was so damn good with the tomato sauce, yogurt, croutons and thinly sliced pieces of chicken. My friend's Doner, however was quite bland. I hesitated to even to try it because I don't eat lamb, but when I tried it, it still wasn't that great. We later dug into the K\u00fcnefe, which was very moist and crispy; it was delightful. This place left a pretty good impression on me until about an hour after we left. My friend started complaining about her stomach aching and suspected that it came from the lamb. Apparently it was a pretty serious case of food poisoning. I really wanted to like this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-27", "description": "Four of us went for dinner last night. Very good, although the best Turkish in or near SF for me is still Mivan in Burlingame. We started out with Hummus and Cacik as well as a lahmacun and ispanakli borek. They were all tasty, and the lahmacun was particularly good, The crust was appropriately thin and crispy and the meat mixture was nicely spiced.  I had an Iskander kebap, one of my favorite dishes at Mivan, for comparison. A la Turca's version was tasty, but it lacked in a couple of ways. I like the bread cubes to be more crispy, these were very soft and with the added meat and sauce on top they had no structural integrity by the time the dish reached the table. At Mivan they're more like croutons and it's a nice contrast to the tenderness of the meat and the zingy sauce. The sauce at alaturca was very good and there was a lot of it, they were also very generous with the yogurt. One of my dining companions got the Chicken Doner and it was quite tasty. Another got the Beyti Kebap, also good, although I wasn't wowed by it. The final diner got a Falafel sandwich which was very good. Really flavorful tender falafel on excellent homemade pita.  We finished up by sharing a Kunefe and a sutlac. The kunefe was good, but the Sutlac was excellent! I'd go again just for a bowl of it. With the success of our friends Sandwich I think if I went back I'd try the Gozleme, Pides, or their sandwiches. The service was good and attentive,  but there was a glitch when we went to get the check, apparently they ran out of register tape and didn't have any on hand and we had to wait for the owner to go buy some and bring it back. That took quite a long time and while they apologized, I would have liked to have seen a little more of a gesture go into it.", "author": "Joyce H."}

Initially I used to be accompanied by my turkish friends, but by now after making countless number of visitis, I gathered enough courage to bring my friends from different continents!!I  Let me tell you, people  from all these different parts of the world with very different culture and taste,  have all made it to this place atleast twice if not thrice!  \r\n\r\nIf you are in a group of 3-4 people, it is great as you can share some appetizers and main dishes. In the appetizer category my favorite is Borek (deep fried and cheese inside) and Mucver.  Also, get some Piyaz which goes really well with the fresh bread the provide. Turkish style Pizza, known as Lahmacun is very good too, although some days it lacks consistency and can become more soggy than crispy. But in general it is great with lettuce, onion  on top and lemon sprinkled. In the category of main dish, starting from Adana Kebap to Doner are all good, but my number one recommendation is Iskender (Alexander Kebap). You are served fine pieces of meat and bread with yogurt. Very good ! Once again, I will have to mention on some rare occasion, I have noticed the meat stripes are not thin enough. May be I can catch these inconsistencies being an avid supporter of  Iskender  for  the past 3 years or may be its time for me to try it in Istanbul once!  There are some choices for complete vegetarian people as well, go for Pide with mushroom, spinach and feta , they can customize it upon request. Also, try the lentil soup. \r\n\r\nFinally, you will have to dive into the category of the dessert selection. I have noticed Baklava is the most favorite among the non-Turks and Kunefe is the favorite among the Turks. My pledge to you: Please give KADAYIFF a chance....you will find a new favorite dessert for you. Oh and do not forget the Turkish tea while you wait for the food or enjoy the dessert or watch the Turkish TV and listen to Tarkan.\r\n\r\nIt is not a place you go for upscale ambience or for a fancy date, but the variety of  food they offer in huge servings at an  affordable price  and  the Turkish hospitality (which they are well known for),  Turkish TV, music and tea you \"don't feel more abroad than you are at home..\"..... truely fits the spirit of San Francisco.", "author": "Kingshuk g."}
