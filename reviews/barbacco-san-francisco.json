Although the vibe inside the restaurant is nice, the food doesn't quite deliver. \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Fusilli dish with pomegranates. It was rich and creamy, but it was extremely bland. I ordered it because I was curious how pomegranates would go with pasta, but it was not great. It was too tangy for the subtle taste of the pasta. The fusili was also pretty undercooked. I thought maybe it was just my pasta but I had similar feelings about the mushroom pasta as well althought it was a bit better. The Brussel sprouts that we got for the appetizer, however, were fantastic. They were extremely crispy and full of flavor - could've honestly made an entire meal out of those brussel sprouts.", "author": "Sampath D."}

We were seated promptly and service was great the whole night. \n\nDecent fare:\n-Arancini: I've had better but this wasn't bad. Really thick balls of risotto deep fried with cheese in the middle, so what's not to love. \n- Meatballs: Juicy pork meatballs with pine nuts and raisins in tomato sauce. I would get this dish if you come here. \n\nWhat took this down to 3 stars:\n-Orecchiette: The pasta itself was decent; cooked well with a great texture. What threw me off was the hard chunks of broccoli scattered throughout. I've had broccoli orechiette before that was executed well and I can't say the same for this. \n-Bruschetta: Wow, the saddest bruschetta I've ever had. The bread was tiny and ridiculously hard. There was some sad flavorless balsamic sauce on top and then sprinkled with some pink pickled thing and shaved Parmesan. They really need to change this dish up. \n\nOverall, not impressed with this spot and the search for good Italian food continues.", "author": "Jenny L."}

The prices are reasonable, the location is convenient, and the food is tasty. What more could you ask for?\n\nAs the casual younger sister of Perbacco, Barbacco is one of my go-to spots when having lunch with coworkers on our own dime. Reservations are a must and you can usually get one during prime lunch hour if you plan a few days in advance.\n\nThe pastas are what Barbacco is known for and are generally in the $17 range. The sandwiches are a steal. On my last visit, I ordered a Roasted Porchetta Sandwich that came with provolone, arugula, and delicious onion jam. It was huge and it ended up being lunch for 2 days. The meat was tender, juicy, and a little fatty (in a good way). The spiciness of the arugula paired with the sweetness of the onion jam was heavenly. At $14 for the sandwich, that's basically the same price you'd pay at a take-out place.", "author": "Yi Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-08", "description": "We had a decent dinner experience at Barbacco. 8pm on a Thursday evening, the place was quite busy - definitely best to make a reservation for dinner. They said it would be a 45 minute wait, but we got lucky with a small corner table, just big enough for three. It was cozy, but doable for a last minute dinner, although there was a cold draft throughout most of our meal. The restaurant seating is a little crowded, with the tables a little too close together and wobbly contemporary chairs that aren't very comfortable to sit on. We could very easily hear the conversations of the two tables next to us.\n\nWe ordered a Burrata appetizer, Vegetarian Meatballs, Corn Fusilli, the Fettuccine, and the Chocolate Nemesis Cake for dessert. The Burrata was great, definitely an appetizer you can't go wrong with.\n\nOf the entire meal, my favorite was the Corn Fusilli - the pesto seemed to lack salt, but the texture of the dish was what really got me. The sweet corn kernels added a great \"crunch\" to contrast with the al dente pasta. I added a little bit of salt and I have a tendency to put chili flakes on everything, so those added a little extra flavor for me too, but even without those, the dish really stood out.\n\nThe Fettuccine was alright - while the pasta was well-made, I wanted the dish to be a little creamier. Instead, it came across a little watery and didn't really come together for me.\n\nThe Vegetarian \"Meatballs\" are made with Impossible brand meat, and it's great to see a prominent upscale restaurant offering these options. The texture of the meatballs is soft and every bite bursts with flavor. As a vegetarian who isn't used to meaty textures, this dish is a little bit of an adjustment, and it's definitely geared towards meat-eaters trying to incorporate vegetarian meals into their diet. Nonetheless, it's a well-made dish that deserves 4 stars for both effort and execution.\n\nFinally, we ended our evening with the Chocolate Nemesis Cake. The slice was very dense, more like a solidified mousse than a cake. It was good we shared the slice between three people as a couple of bites was more than enough for all of us. I didn't care too much for the candied hazelnuts - the smokey flavor was too overpowering. The presentation also left much to be desired. The other dishes came out neatly plated, but it seemed the the cream and hazelnuts on the cake were just thrown onto the plate.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and service was solid. We really appreciated them making space for us on a busy night. The food is so-so, but I can see how the atmosphere makes for a nice evening out.", "author": "Apoorva A."}

That sounded awesome, except it was cooked really al dente.  The waitress was nice enough to replace it with one that was cooked.  I rarely send food back but that pasta was really chewy (and I recognize that even though my dad is 100% italian-american, I am not a big fan of tough pasta).  The second version was much better, but not sure that I would have that again.\n\nMy wife had the Orecchiette, which was pretty good (and was properly cooked).\n\nWe finished off the meal with an Affagato with olive oil gelato which was pretty nice.\n\nWhile that dinner was just okay, the Vegetarian Meatballs (made with \"impossible meat) sounds pretty interesting.  i may be back.", "author": "Bob F."}

It's the first place everyone rambles off when you ask about where to go in the Financial District, and they're not wrong. What a treat this place is! First of all, the restaurant and bar area is enormous - they can really fit a lot of people inside, but boy does it fill up quickly at happy hour and dinner time. We made reservations in advance and I'm so glad we did because we probably would have had to wait awhile had we not. We even got there a little early and they were able to immediately seat us, which was nice. \n\nThe interior was sleek. The staff all matched and looked very professional, and we were talked to by several people before our server reached the table, to fill up our waters, hand us menus, etc. - everyone really worked together.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of red wine, two pasta dishes and carrot cake for dessert. Let's start with the pasta! I ordered the shrimp linguine which was so good and surprisingly filling. However, I was a little disappointed in the amount and size of the shrimp though - there were only 3-4 pieces of shrimp and they were truly tiny. The white sauce was yummy - with garlic and chili to give it a little kick, but it did not overwhelm the other ingredients, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The second pasta dish was the rigatoni alla bolognese with beef and pork ragu. The pasta was infused with the sauce which made for an interesting look and a different but good tasting noodle. There was also additional sauce with the meat, so it was not lacking in the sauce department! The portions for both were large enough for the price at a fancy yet affordable Italian restaurant and we were not disappointed at all. We then ordered the carrot cake for dessert which came with a scoop of ice cream on top. Yum! It was a little on the dry side, but if you ate it with the ice cream it tasted really good.\n\nOur bill totaled to right below $120 with tip - not bad. The service throughout our meal was so great and we really felt well taken care of.", "author": "Bri T."}

Actually there also the counter seating I though looked nice. My friend and I were seated right at the divide, where he sat next to a column awkwardly.  All the tables were parabola shaped which at first felt weird but you kind of forgot about it afterwards.\n\nLet's talk food!\n\nHere's what my friend and I shared:\n\nPEAR & ENDIVE SALAD - $14 - Gorgonzola Crema, Toasted Hazelnut, Mosto Cotto\nThis salad had a nice balance of many textures and flavors.  It has the nice crunch of the salad, the creaminess is the Gorgonzola that's not too strong in taste, the nuttiness of the hazelnuts and the sweetness of the ripe pears.  I really enjoyed this salad.  Good to share as a starter.\n\nORRECHIETTE - $17 - \"Little Ears\", Broccoli di Ciccio, Fennel Sausage, Pecorino.\nI made this choice because of the Yelp recommendations and photos--it looked good! But it was disappointing. It felt like something was missing. Perhaps an olive oil base  or butter topping because it tasted so dry, a lot of the \"littler ears were stuck together. There was hardly any fennel sausage. It honestly didn't feel or taste like pasta. \n\nPOLPETTE - $16 - Sicilian Meatballs w/Pine Nuts, Raisins, Spicy Tomato Sugo\nOrdered this because it came up a lot on Yelp. It was good. It was not special but it was good.  You get 3 huge meatballs that was salty and flavorful enough in chunky tomato sauce.  I don't recall seeing or tasting any raisins.\n\nFRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS - $6\nCapers, Anchovy Vinaigrette\nThis came out last and it smelled so good! Some had a nice crisp to it and I'm glad t didn't have that usual weird Brussels sprouts taste.  This was probably my favorite out of everything.  Maybe if everything else was fried I would have enjoyed them more :P\n\nNEMESIS (Chocolate Flourless Cake) - $6 - w/Vanilla Bean Crema, White Chocolate Crunch, Preserved Dark Cherries\nOur server recommended this and I went for it. It is SUPER rich and pretty good. But I don't rec this if you rather have something lighter for dessert. I liked the thin white chocolate crunch a lot.

My eyes were glued on the lasagna so that's what I ordered while he had the oreccheiette.  My lasagna was good, just not mama-gimme-some-more good.  My friend's dish looked light and clean, consistent with California cuisine.  We shared the Brussel sprouts which met expectations with hearty flavor without being oily.  Service was efficient and prompt as we were able to complete our lunch within the normal work allotted hour timeframe.  \n\nAtmosphere wise, it is certainly festive and bustling with loud conversations throughout the restaurant, at least when we were there.  I would recommend this for a casual lunch but business lunches are a bit tougher given the room volume.  A friend of mine actually used to operate a deli at this location and they've done a great job of renovating it into a hip eat and drink spot.\n\nYes, I'll be back and hope to try their other dishes that are often mentioned.\nDefinitely a solid lunch choice in the Financial District.", "author": "Mike C."}

Our delivery order arrived via Caviar around 12 noon.\n\n*Chef's Selection of Salumi: Chef's choice ($12.65 small)\n*Crushed Peas: Ricotta salata and radishes ($3.45)\n*Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushrooms: Parmigiano ($3.45)\n\nI love a good salumi platter, so I had to try Barbacco's. It's a good size and had a variety of meats. Also came with slices of bread and olives which were tasty. I did wish the dish came with cornichons and mustard, but maybe that's more of a charcuterie thing? Since we only have $20 to spend on lunch, I decided to get some sides. (I actually wanted cheese, but that would have put me over budget.) This is probably Caviar's bad more than Barbacco's, but I had no idea I was ordering bruschette. If I did, I probably would have ordered the Tuscan Chicken Liver Pate: Balsamic braised onion ($3.45). I ended up just eating the toppings of the bruschetta and discarding the bread.\n\nI've been to Perbacco and had a nice dinner. I think due to the budget and delivery menu, I didn't enjoy Barbacco as much as I should have.

Barbacco is the more casual and a little more energetic where Perbacco is little more upscale. Both serve outstanding Northern Italian cuisine.\n\nWe like to sit at the counter at Barbacco. On a recent dinner, we shared the octopus, a wonderful pasta -- they usually have four -- a specialty of both restaurants, and a steak. Barbacco has a nice wine program, including carafes. We had a 500 ml Sicilian red for $32 -- excellent. The whole bill, tax and 20% tip was $120.00 -- what a bargain.\n\nPerbacco is more of a celebratory experience. A little more upscale, the preparations are a little more involved, and the choices a little wider. I am a sucker for the quail if its on the menu and always a pasta or two.

I got a tap beer and ordered the radicchio salad to start. Salad is salad so I'll spare the details. Next came the lasagna with spinach pasta! Now this one is a must try because it was awesome. Pasta was done correctly and the meat and cheese melted so well together. My only wish was that they gave a bigger portion! I also got to try the meatballs and those came in 3 an order. I'm not a fan of meat balls but these were really good. The tartness of the tomato sauce helps diversify the flavors a bit. \n\nI have to commend the people working here.

They have booth seats but we sat at the bar counter, which we don't mind.  Note that it does get a bit crowded at the 6:30-7:30 dinner rush so might not be good if you are claustrophobic.\n\nServers were relatively quick even with the dinner rush.  They did forget our order of the fried brussels sprouts but they were kind enough to make it on the house and get it to us quickly.\n\nPortions were on the bigger side- we shared one appetizer and then I was full after another appetizer and side (maybe I just have a smaller stomach).  Even so, my friend ordered a pasta dish and even though he was super hungry coming in, he noted it was a huge portion and barely finished.  \n\nCrostone (chicken liver pate, pear, balsamico)($12) - my friend and I shared this (they serve 4 pieces).  I love the smooth salty pate- it almost was like foie gras and thankfully wasn't too mushy.  The pear added a nice texture to the smooth pate, though it would have been great too if it were thicker so that its sweetness could balance out the slightly salty pate.  The crostini didn't get soggy either.\n\nRoasted octopus (with crushed potatoes and salsa verde)($12) - portion was perfect for me.  Octopus was cooked well and had a nice subtle flavor (not too fishy or overcooked).  Love the texture of the crushed potatoes (since they weren't fully mashed) and the crunchy salsa.\n\nFried brussels sprouts (w/ capers, anchovy and red wine vinaigrette)($6) - the brussels sprouts themselves were fried well, but unfortunately mine were way overdressed and unevenly so.  Some bites were fine but then after taking some bits, my mouth would pucker so much from the amount of vinaigrette they used.  Shame, considering I LOVE brussels sprouts.\n\nMy friend had the rigatoni all' amatriciana (tomato sugo, pancetta, onion, chilli, pecorino)($17)- I didn't eat it but it smelled amazing!  He enjoyed it and finished the dish (see note above) and loved how it had enough cheese to bring the smoky pecorino flavor into the dish but not so much that it became heavy.\n\nSplitting the bill down the center (including a beer and wine), we both paid a little over $40.  \n\nDefinitely will come back to try their Meatball Mondays and pastas- I think I'd bring coworkers and/or colleagues back here again.", "author": "Audrey H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-12", "description": "For the longest time I had assumed that Barbacco specialized in barbacoa, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a trendy Italian restaurant with craft pasta and bar bites. \n\nIn my opinion the menu is just right, not overwhelmingly huge but not overly minimalist. It offers a sufficient variety to cater to your preferences. They even have corn-based gluten-free fusilli! Although I often scoff at the pointlessness of the gluten-free hype, corn pasta sounds like a creative and delicious idea :P\n\nWe started with BRANDACUJUN (don't ask me how to pronounce it) aka salt cod fritters. It was comparable to salt cod fish cakes at most places, consisting of meatball-shaped cod surrounded by a golden panko coating. Each of the 3 accompanying aioli tasted distinctly different, though I don't remember the descriptions the server introduced to us. At $11 for 3 fritters it's a bit pricey (and difficult to share because it crumbles when you cut it in half), but noteworthy and appetizing indeed.\n\nAt first it bothered me that the FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($6) were so inconsistent, with some pieces dry and plain while other pieces were doused to a pungent tangyness in the red wine vinaigrette. The texture was similarly heterogeneous, ranging from thin, crisp, almost flash-fried single leaflets to chunks with more resistance to the bite. I quickly came to appreciate how the dish showcases the fascinating diversity in something as simple as fried Brussels sprouts. (Just like how SF adores the variation of basic avo toasts)\n\nThe risotto was the reason we came to visit (I had been on something of a risotto quest for boo's cravings). While it was not the absolute best risotto I've ever had, it was memorable and exemplified the same culinary finesse of creating a signature dish from simple ingredients. Named the FARROTTO ($15), the \"risotto\" was farro-based for a heartier, grainier texture and a more complex, earthier flavor profile. The farro was more chewy and fell short of the intriguingly al dente firmness of traditional risotto, but the savory parmigiano reggiano, roasted mushrooms, and spinach gave a nice oomph. Overall I liked the spin and the healthier approach in contrast to the typically creamy, rich composition.\n\nI didn't know what to expect of the LUMACHE ($17; featuring green \"snail-shaped\" pasta), and it turned out to be another interesting and unique pasta creation. The lamb sugo was braised melty soft (and came in a surprisingly generous portion) blended with a bold arrabiata-like spicy tomato sauce, a garnish of cool mint leaves, and sharp pecorino cheese. The pasta was notably al dente, and the snail shape was excellent for scooping up sauce. \n\nThe dining experience at Barbacco has its share of class and stellar Italian cuisine, yet it remains casual and comfortable. (The nearby Perbacco is its fancier sibling.) True to its name, Barbacco includes a long row of bar seating (with extremely comfortable bar stools) along one side of the restaurant.\n\nThe verdict? Reasonably priced (for SF) and outstandingly delicious (for SF) (which is saying a lot.)", "author": "Edna C."}

As we were about to get up to leave, the waiter came over to us and handed us another bill and stated that apparently he had given us the wrong bill the first time. This new bill was $70 more than the bill originally given to us. We were all shocked due to not realizing the discrepancy and were ready to head out. My friend asked how his card was charged again for this bill that he hadn't given his card for, and the waiter said they still had it on file and just ran it again. ARE YOU SERIOUS? How is this possible, isn't this illegal? The receipt that was given to us was in essence a contract and we agreed to it. By handing it to us, the restaurant agreed to it as well.  What would have happened if we had left? \n\nI promptly requested to speak to the manager. Upon the managers arrival, she attempted to downplay the situation and state that she wouldn't need our card for the new charge and we would be okay. Instead of offering her apologies and maybe offering up something for the inconvenience, she treated us like we were the ones who had done the wrongdoing. Any self respecting entity would offer up a free round of beers (which I requested)  or desert on the house for their mistake, but instead she chose to be stubborn and not properly respond to the situation and offered us nothing.  My friends and I felt cheated and violated.  I told the manager this wasn't the proper way to be dealing with the situation and that I would be writing a negative review for this poor service. She seemed unphased and had an overall very rude demeanor.  \n\nWe did not think the situation was handled professionally at all and we do not have any intention of going back the restaurant.

I came on a Friday night for dinner and was really impressed with their offerings. \n\nThere are a bunch of small plates on the menu, which were great for sharing. Surprisingly, the \"small\" plates actually had pretty substantial portion sizes--definitely bigger than the appetizers you get at most restaurants! We started with the grilled octopus with mashed potato and watermelon radish--the octopus pieces were so delicious and tender but still had a nice bite. The Brussels sprouts were unbelievably tasty and fried to tender perfection. The arugula and radicchio salad with parmesan was nice and simple--absolutely nothing fancy, but a great vegetal addition to the meal!\n\nAnd then came our entrees--the lumache (snail-shaped) pasta came with a divine tomato/lamb ragu--the meat was so moist and tender, and the pasta was dressed with an unctuous blend of herbs and cheese. The \"peposo\" was a Tuscan beef stew--it came with three hearty chunks of beef braised in a tomato and red wine sauce and served over a creamy and chunky polenta. So delicious and tender--and again, the portion sizes of both entrees were extremely generous, and I finished the meal feeling very satisfied. My only complaint was that the entrees were just a bit salty, but there's nothing like a cool dessert to finish off!\n\nGiven how good everything else was, the dessert was probably the least impressive part of the meal. Nevertheless, the cannoli with ricotta, pistachio, and orange peel was decent, and the housemade orange/lemon oil gelato was light and refreshing.

I took a star out because of our server, but more on that later. We opted to share everything and I had my cousin do the ordering since she knew the menu quite well. We started with melt-in-your-mouth Burrata cheese and quickly went to salad, which was Hearts of Romaine with anchovy dressing. If you are a fan of anchovy, this is a definite must. It's too bad there wasn't an option to add grilled shrimp to the salad. That would've been a great lunch entree. However, we did have a perfect entree to share: Orecchiette pasta with fennel sausage. Perfectly cooked with loads of flavor. I savored every bite of it and will definitely go back for more. \n\nNow for the minus one star, our server. He rushed us from the moment we sat down and I really wanted to smack this kid. Of course I would never do such a thing, but you get the idea. I know he wanted turn-over on tables, especially during the lunch hour, but he was so aggressive to the point he almost ruined our lunch. We saw him doing the same to the table next to us. My cousin works just around the corner and we went during her lunch break. I mean it's not as if we were going to be there all afternoon long. An hour max, buddy, go away and leave us alone, I thought. Stop popping in on us, and no you cannot take away that half eaten salad....are you insane?

My coworkers had the meatballs and the farroto mushroom risotto which they both liked. Having shared bites I liked those dishes as well. We ordered a huge soup of the day some minestrone varient and my favorite cali cheese humbolt fog which went over well as well.

We felt slightly \"managed\" by the staff -- everything is a production, and we were part of the production.\n\nMaybe I'm being slightly harsh; we should return without an initial stop at the Royal Exchange.

Barbacco seemed like a good cross between classy and affordable, so we gave it a try. I always get nervous when we walk into a restaurant and the first question is whether or not we have a reservation. Fortunately there was seating available at the bar, so we sat there and ordered through the bartender. This would be a fantastic place for a date night or an evening get-together with a friend!\n\nI wasn't feeling too hungry for a heavy entree, so I decided on polenta squares and Brussel sprouts. This was a good amount of food, and not really a balanced meal, though I will say I ate way more Brussel sprouts than polenta squares. The staff was very friendly, and Barbacco had an overall lively atmosphere. We sat next to the TV which unfortunately had some bloody cowboy scene that I kept getting distracted by, but I enjoyed my time here regardless.\n\nIf possible, make a reservation (especially for dinner) either for a small group or an intimate rendezvous. Would love to get dressed up, order some wine, and try some of their meat or pasta dishes one evening. If you're coming here for lunch, get here right when they open at 11:30 AM to snatch a seat.

I had heard that while Perbacco focused more on pasta dishes, Barbacco was a favorite for the more well rounded cuisine, all at a friendly price point, becoming rarer in the city these days. \n\nWe stopped by on a Saturday night and found the place full.  We had an Opentable reservation and were quickly taken to our table. \n\nIt's a long restaurant with bar-like stool sitting and numerous smaller tables along the other side of the restaurant. \n\nService was friendly, but they're quite busy and forgot to apply our gift certificate, brought us the wrong bill, and forgot to bring our leftovers but all the minor issues were quickly dealt with.  Our order: \n\nCrostone - $11. Chicken liver pate spread over toast with cherries.  Amazingly delicious and perfectly heated to be warm over the crunchy toast. \n\nPolpette - $16.  These Sicilian Meatballs were a touch spicy and a bit denser than I liked but were very flavorful with braised chard and a slightly spicy sugo.  Four large meatballs meant plenty of leftovers. \n\nOriechette - $15. This pasta dish of \"little ears\" was great. Nicely al dente pieces mixed with meaty sausage bites and plenty of pesto.  Another generous serving. \n\nBrussel Sprouts - $6.  Nice side dish of slightly charred brussel sprouts.  For fans of this vegetable like our table, a hit. \n\nOverall, Barbacco was a great dinner.  Delicious flavors, generous portions, and hearty Italian fare served in an unpretentious manner with prices that match.  Other than the slight service hiccups, Barbacco is a winner. \n\nBarbacco accepts credit cards including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

VERY impressed. \n\nThere's no happy hour here, but the sides and veggies are pretty much HH pricing ($5-6) and again, everything is pretty reasonably priced, so I'd argue that you get better value here.\n\nAppetizer: ROASTED OCTOPUS w/ crushed potatoes -- 3 stars -- roasted octopus was very tender and flavorful! The crushed potatoes were literally just crushed potatoes and not seasoned very much, which understandably would have complemented the more pungent flavor of octopus, but it could have used a dash of salt or butter.\n\nAppetizer: BRUSCHETTA Roasted Squash / Pomegranate /Pumpkin Seed / Peppered Ricotta -- 5 stars -- now, I don't like the idea of paying for bruschetta b/c its literally just toast with stuff on top, but this was AMAZING! It came with 4 big pieces too, not a dinky piece like most other places. Nested on a small slice of soft & chewy Acme bread was.. heaven. It sounded like whatever on the menu but all the components together was simply divine.\n\nMAIN: POLPETTE sicilian meat balls with pine nuts and raisins braised chard / spicy tomato sugo -- 4 stars -- MM! So flavorful and just the perfect amount of cheese on top. The meatballs were a good size as well (like 2 big bites, or a good 4 bites if you like to cut it up a bit). I don't remember seeing any pine nuts or raisins, really, but it was really good.\n\n FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS capers / anchovy / red wine vinaigrette - 4.5 stars - SO GOOD! Savory and just the perfect amount of slight sourness from the vinaigrette. Addictive. Dangerous.\n\nSERVICE was okay.

If you don't know what wine to order, I would recommend asking the waiter as they give their best recommendations based on what dish you order.\n\nThe pasta was so delicious, but the reason I cannot give 5 stars is because of the portion size. The pastas we ordered, which are the main entrees, were SO SO SO small in their portions; it was almost shocking. I have a very small stomach so I never finish my food, ever, but the pasta portion was SO small, I finished it in about 10 minutes. I know what a regular Italian food portion size looks like and this place is definitely below average. It felt as if I ordered a kids meal. We paid $80 total including tax and tip (including the wine too), but we were not full at ALL. We ended up going to a different restaurant a few hours after because the meal here did not fill us up at ALL.\n\nAlthough the service, ambience, food quality, and the taste were all 5 stars, I really have to take off 2 stars for the smallest Italian food portion size I've seen and for paying $20 for a pasta and not getting full from it.\n\nOverall, a great restaurant, but kids meal portion sizes :(", "author": "Jen S."}

They're just the right amount of crispy and soft, nicely flavored with oil, salt, and a bit of a sour / tangy kick.\n\nAs for the main dishes, I've been here a few times and enjoyed everything I've ordered, including the risotto, ragu, and meatballs. The cheese flavoring on their pastas is kind of intense, which is delicious up until the last few bites, when it becomes overwhelming. Still, generally a pretty decent Italian meal in an easily accessible location.\n\nNote: you need to ask for bread, but it is free! And it's Acme bread, so it's awesome.\n\nThe place gets very crowded and is somewhat noisy (it seems like a Financial District favorite) so try to make a reservation, and don't count on sitting at a table if there's only a few of you. Every time I've been here, even with a reservation, we've been seated at the bar. It's still great, but a bit less space and you're not facing each other.\n\nGood for a quick catch-up meal with friends who work nearby, especially if you're looking for some Italian but don't want to climb the hill to North Beach!", "author": "Brittany C."}

The chairs were comfy but getting onto the seats was a bit awkward. We kept bumping in the tables next to us so it is a bit cramped in the restaurant. \n\n(/)Bruschetta - burrata cheese / arugula / prosciutto. The burrata cheese was way too gooey and soft for my taste. I live burrata cheese that are more \"stringy\" and chewy. It was a good dish to try but I think I'll skip it and try something else next time as a appetizer. \n\n(+) lasagna bolognese - spinach pasta / ragu bolognese/ besciamella sauce . I personally loved the lasagna. After seeing so many pictures and positive reviews about this dish, I decided to go with it. The serving seemed a bit small at first but it was actually pretty filling. Perfect sauce and the spinach lasagna was a nice touch. It wasn't too heavy as a I expected. \n\n(+) orecchiette - \"little ears\" / cavolo nero/ fennel sausage / pecorino cheese. I actually really enjoyed this dish too. I only tried a little of it from my friend but I'll definitely be getting this one if I come back here. I loved the fennel sausage on top. It was salty and added a nice flavor to the overall creamy dish. \n\n(-) rigatoni alla carbonara -pasta tubes/ guanciale pecorino romano / egg / black pepper. I'm usually not that picky of a eater when it comes to pasta but I didn't enjoy this dish at all. The pasta tubes itself had a rubbery/plastic taste to it. I couldn't get myself to eat more than 2-3 tubes. Meh. Do not recommend. \n\n(+/) chocolate nemesis cake - strawberries/ fudge/ toffee crumble/ vanilla crema. I seriously don't know how I would able to finish this dessert plate by myself. We shared this between 4 people and we were so full! The chocolate cake tastes like the inside of a truffle. Super rich and creamy but it is also really heavy. I love the toffee crumble on top. The vanilla crema is also really light to balance out how heavy the chocolate is. \n\nOverall, pretty decent experience. We were a bit disappointed that the drinks menu were only wine and didn't have any cocktails but it makes sense. The staff were pretty quick. I do recommend making a reservation ahead of time.

We were seated (or attempted to be seated) at a table near the front of the restaurant. The tables were positioned in such a way that there were, literally, only inches between the tables. To get seated along the wall, we had to move the tables that were to either side (and no one was seated there yet) so that we could squeeze in to the seats along the wall. Of course, once someone sat to either side, it would have been impossible to exit the table from those seats without having the people at the adjoining table get up to move their table.\n\nBottom line: packing people in like sardines does not make for a pleasant dining experience.

My friend swore by this place because of two of their dishes, the meatballs and the chicken thighs.  I finally got to check it out a few weeks ago.  It's a bustling place at lunch.  They won't seat you until your party's there which I thought was fair considering how busy they are.\n\nWe ordered four bruschetta at $3/each (you can also get 3/$8):  asparagus, mushroom, chicken pate, and anchovy.  They were all excellent, and I specially liked the pate.  \n\nWe both ordered the polpette (meatballs, $16) which came in three gigantic pieces.  I was only able to eat two of them and had to take one home.  I think for lunch, this was way too much food and I would have been happy with two for less price.  From the reviews, and my friend's recommendation, I was really expecting a lot from the polpette.  While I thought they were good, (and even the cold leftover did well the next day), it didn't change my life or anything.  But then, can a meatball really do that to anyone?\n\nFor dessert, we had a scoop each of coffee and butter-scotch gelato.  Definitely get these.  They were close to perfection one can find in gelato.  The coffee stracciatella surpasses the butter-scotch, IMO, but we were happy to have gotten both.\n\nOverall a delicious lunch for a bargain at $60 for two people.

They used to have tables aligned perpendicular to the wall, some 2 and 4 tops and some communal. Now they have just one row of tables against the wall, with a bench on the wall side that is a distinctly different height than the chairs that face it. So you will not be able to look directly at your tablemates, they will be either looking up or looking down at you. And once you sit down, don't expect to get up. The tables are so close together, that it took four people at two tables to try to open up even a small space for my wife to be able to go the restroom. And the servers can barely get in to change plates without much bumping. If they'd taken just ONE table out, it would make everybody more comfortable, but I guess they're hurting for the dollars now, so no chance of that.\n\nWhy are they hurting for the dollars? (and what once was a tough reservation is now a walk-in-anytime place, the demand is gone). Because the food is just not great anymore. When you had one of the best brussels sprout dishes in the city (made with duck fat) why would you ever change it? But they have, to a version that is over-vinegared and just OK. \n\nAnd the menu used to be fun, with variations of bruschetta as appetizers, and so many great small plates. Now it is just like any other Italian restaurant in the city, except with mediocre food.\n\nWe had a pasta with bolognese that was barely better than a canned product. Broccolini side dish was totally bland. It's one thing when the ingredients you add to a dish don't prove flavorful, but they somehow managed to make even the vegetable itself flavorless.\n\nThe meatballs that always used to be great were still very good. And the octopus was perfectly cooked, though the other ingredients in the dish were again flavorless. How can they do that so often?\n\nI'm sure this is a new chef, with his or her own menu. Just not one I like anymore.\n\nOne thing that shone was the service. We had someone in our party with some dietary restrictions, and the waiter was incredibly helpful, checking repeatedly with the chef and helping us find options.

The meatballs were quite good and while I am a huge sprouts lover (it's my favorite food), this was a small portion and too lemony for Tony and I.\nI genuinely liked this restaurant and plan on coming back to try their other dishes.", "author": "Kelly T."}

A table would have been much preferable, since it wasn't all that easy to connect, but it wasn't our first meet (or our only destination for the evening), so I guess it was okay. \n\nTo start, we ordered the fried brussel sprouts, the fried polenta, and the grilled octopus. My favorite was probably the last. I could have had an entire plate of it by myself. The sprouts were a close second. They were flavored well and addictive. They weren't, however, pleasant while digesting and in the to-go container, haha, as the resulting odor wasn't the most attractive aroma. I liked the texture of the polenta, but I wished there was another flavor involved to complicate the palette. \n\nFor my main, I tried peposo, and it was surprisingly spicy. Luckily I'm a fan of spicy food. The beef was tender and fell apart at the touch of my fork. The accompanying polenta was delicious, but a tad bit overkill after our appetizer (but that was my fault in ordering). \n\nI asked for a glass of red wine, and the server matched one with my dish.

A sign in front of the restaurant says 5 PM, as does YELP, but signage on the restaurant window tells you the place opens at 5:30.  The latter is correct and  you would think a restaurant would be clear about that. Really!\n\nI was the first diner seated last night at 5:30 and was placed at the end of the counter rather than at a formal table.  And that with an Open Table reservation.  Why do that to a patron?\n\nImmediately on being seated my server asked what I wanted.  My response was to know the specials of the day.  He didn't know and went to find out.   On being told that a seafood special of sole was available I asked the price.  He didn't know and went to find out.  After my first course the eating utensils were taken but not replaced so when my second course arrived I waited a little while for a knife and fork.  Really! \n\nMy meal started with the spicy meatballs that come with pine nuts and raisins.  This was nice enough although it was served luke-warm.  \n\nNext up was braised chicken thighs.  Again this was nice enough but yet again this was served luke-warm.  One almost had the feeling that these dishes had been prepared well in advance and then given a shot in the microwave.

Just past the tartare stage, perfectly moist and flaky.

Not cloyingly sweet, but also not too peppery. A balanced addition that paired well with our pasta and proteins!\n-The highlight of this meal was the bruschetta with prosciutto, burrata, and arugula. It was my first time having burrata cheese, and needless to say, I loved it! Tasted like a hybrid of mozzarella and Brie, with just the right amount of buttery richness. The prosciutto and arugula were fresh and delicious, as well\n-I had the corn fusilli for my main entree. While it looked like your standard plate of Mac and cheese, the roasted butternut squash and cubed prosciutto provided just the right balance of sweet and salty. The pepper cream sauce, topped off with some parsley, also added some texture and spice\n-I sampled my friend's oriecchiette and farrotto - both were delicious! Would definitely recommend all of the pasta plates\n-The service was pretty quick. ~15 minutes for all four of our plates, plus our appetizer\n-Very affordable, given quality and quantity of food. At first glance, a plate of pasta seems like nothing until you're halfway in... a standard dish can definitely last 1.5 to 2 meals\n-Seasonal menu.

Nothing necessarily bad about them but nothing that makes them different or special. The sides are pretty much drenched in oil though, which I find to be excessive and unnecessary when it comes to veggies, so if you're grease-adverse, I'd avoid them.\n\nMost of the pasta and entree dishes didn't really stand out to me either. The only thing I'd really, really recommend are the SICILIAN MEATBALLS (also recommended by 7x7 in their 2014 Big Eat List). I personally didn't enjoy the pastas that much because they're mostly very heavy and creamy, but some people like their pastas that way. Heaviness aside, I didn't find the pastas to be particularly interesting flavor-wise.\n\n4 stars for the meatballs though! And their focaccia bread is pretty good.\n\n====================\n\n*** SALADS ***\n\nTheir salads are decent and a good alternative for a lighter, healthier meal, but nothing really special. The ingredients are generally pretty fresh. \n\nIf you want meat, get:\n    -BUTCHERS SALAD (romaine, pickled peppers, ham, salami, mozzarella, croutons)\n\nIf you want fruit, get:\n    -ARUGULA SALAD (arugula, apples)\n    -KALE SALAD (kale, pomegranate)\n    -SEASONAL FRUIT SALAD (apples, bananas, grapes, berries) - Varies depending on what's in season, like pineapples or persimmons\n\nIf you want a heavier, more filling salad:\n    -KALE AND FARRO (kale, farro, tomato, cucumber, olives, red onion) - The farro will fill you up!\n\nMy personal favorite:\n    -ROASTED BEETS SALAD (arugula, beets, goat cheese) - Get if you like beets!\n\n====================\n\n*** SIDES ***\n\n-{GET} FOCACCIA BREAD - 4.5/5\n[rosemary, sea salt]\nYUM. A little heavy with the olive oil, but incredibly soft and yummy\n\n-BRUSCHETTA - 3.5/5\n[spring onion, ricotta, toasted almonds]\nThe bread was nowhere near crunchy. Also very, very oily (which is probably why the bread ended up being chewy). I let one piece sit on a napkin and when I lifted it up, the oil had seeped through. The flavors of the toppings were good though.\n\n-BUTTERNUT SQUASH - 3.5/5\nGreasy like everything else. Honestly pretty standard but it was a well cooked side. I enjoyed it the most out of all the sides.\n\n-ROASTED CAULIFLOWER - 3/5\nSometimes it's okay and then sometimes it's unnecessarily greasy\n\n-BRAISED BROCCOLI RABE - 3/5\n[garlic, chili, olive oil]\nNice chili flavor, but greasy\n\n-FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS - 2.5/5\n[duck fat, anchovy vinaigrette]\nI LOVE brussels sprouts and these aren't thaat bad. They're a little on the sour side, but unfortunately too greasy for me to enjoy fully\n\n====================\n\n*** PASTAS & ENTREES ***\n-{GET GET GET} POLPETTE / SICILIAN MEATBALLS - 4.5/5\n[raisins, pine nuts, braised chard, tomato sugo]\nOn 7x7's list of things to eat for good reason! These meatballs are HUGE and SUPER FILLING. Pretty greasy, but you can dab off some of that oil if you're like me... Meat had pretty good flavor! I liked the addition of the raisins for some sweetness and the pine nuts for some texture. The sauce is delicious and has some sort of unique spice/kick to it. Definitely recommend this! \n\n-BRAISED CHICKEN THIGHS - 3/5\n[caponata, pine nuts, basil, chicken jus]\nThe chicken was somewhat on the dry side (especially for thighs) and there was nothing really unique about it, but still okay. Incredibly greasy though.\n\n-FARROTTO - 2.5/5\n[farro \"risotto\", roasted mushrooms, spinach parmigiano reggiano]\nPretty heavy, creamy and rich, but decent flavor\n\n-ORRECCHIETTE - 3/5\n[\"little ears\", kale, house made fennel sausage]\nProbably my favorite of the pastas I've tried because of the sausage, but even the sausage wasn't particularly special\n\n-PACCHERI - 3/5\n[large pasta tubes, pancetta, cauliflower, tomato sugo, parmigiano reggiano]\nNothing special, but it didn't feel as heavy or creamy as some of the other pastas, so I personally enjoyed it a little more. The addition of cauliflower was nice too", "author": "Jessie L."}

He wasn't one of those people that would interrupt your conversation every literally 4 minutes to ask about something, but wasn't one of those waiters who you would see once a night and wonder where the water was.

The hostess lets us in and tells us that they're not fully ready to open, which is understandable. However, she starts to seat other smaller parties anyway, not us. \n\nA few minutes later, after the restaurant officially opens and a few people get seated, she informs us that the maximum amount of people for the online reservation is 6, that they had tried to call us about it, and failed to do so. In spite of that, they managed to accommodate us anyway. Even though it was quite a tight spot, at least we were seated. I wish she was upfront with us about the reservation issue from the start, but I do appreciate the effort to get us seated anyway. \n\nNow, on to the food. My friend had informed me their polpette (Sicilian meatballs with pine nuts and raisins, braised chard, and spicy tomato lugo, aka tomato sauce, $15) was well-received on Yelp, so I went ahead with that choice. The 3 meatballs were definitely well cooked as they were all consistent in texture and didn't fall apart. However, take a look at all of the components of this dish (pine nuts, raisins, braised chard, and spicy tomato sauce). The pine nuts were non existent, as well as the raisins. The \"spicy\" tomato sauce did not have a hint of spice to it. In essence, all I got were 3 meatballs drenched with tomato sauce and chard.

This bruschetta unlike the others is served on a larger piece of bread, and topped generously with a phenomenal, delicate burrata cheese and a variety of corn, arugula, and other vegetables. From the soft, fresh grilled bread, to the burrata and the corn this was one of the highlights of my meal.\n\n* Paccheri Pasta with Pork Sugo - 3.5 STARS ($13): The paccheri is one of Barbacco's most popular entrees. In pictures the noodles look long and flat, but they're actually huge cylindrical shaped pastas, with a nice thickness and bite to it. The sauce was a bit tart and pretty tasty but overall flavor wise needed more cheese, cream or something. \n\n* Orecchiette - 4 STARS ($12): Cavolo nero fennel sausage,  pecorino cheese. This was quite a hefty portion of pasta, topped generously with oil and green sauce. The flavors were delicious and satisfying, I just wish they cooked the pasta more al dente.\n\n* Local squid - 4 STARS ($10): With piastra / capers / chili / olive oil crushed potatoes. I loved the combination of the textures and flavors. The olive tapenade was quite salty but complemented the potatoes and delicate chopped fresh calamari. It was heavier than I expected, but filling and reminded me of homemade food. \n\nOverall prices were affordable - they don't inflate prices for dinner, food was high quality; I would definitely come back but not for a business lunch as they don't take reservations at noon (they are on Opentable!) and it gets very loud inside. \n\nPro-tip: they serve complimentary sparkling water!\nPro-tip: the complimentary bread is pretty terrible.", "author": "Jess C."}

I ordered the corn rigatoni with roasted peppers, asparagus, prosciutto, all in a meyer lemon butter sauce.\n\nI picked my food up about 35 minutes after I placed my order, but when I got it back to the office, it seemed as though my food had been done more quickly and sitting longer than the 20 minutes I was quoted. It wasn't cold, but it was a bit tepid and had that I've-been-sitting-on-the-counter-for-a-while look about it. The veggies were deliciously cooked, the meyer lemon butter sauce was such a light, fresh accompaniment to the dish, but the biggest disappointment - and I mean biggest, because pasta is sort of my life - was the corn rigatoni. I don't know if it was because it's made of corn, if it was a combo of the pasta being made of corn and cooked al dente, or if it was a tri-fold combo of being made of corn, al dente, and having been sitting for a while, but it was hard and dry.\n\nHard, dry pasta. No, guys. No.\n\nThe pasta that was sitting in more of the sauce than the other rigatoni was softer, but ultimately it reminded me of when I make a pot of pasta at home, try a noodle or macaroni to see if the pasta is done, and when I find that it's too undercooked I keep boiling the noodles - but it seems like the chef preparing this dish thought the pasta was ready to go at hard and granular. \n\nSomething tells me, by the quality and taste of the rest of the dish, that if I were to get any other pasta dish at Barbacco (this is the only dish with corn pasta), it would be delicious. I had originally intended to order the paccheri, but when I found out it was no longer served in a pork ragu but in a tomato cauliflower sugo I changed my mind. I probably shouldn't have.

I would say this is one of the few places that serves the most delicious Italian food you could scour the city for. The gem salad they had last summer was my absolute favorite, with diced stone fruits (i.e., peaches, apricots) and perfectly whipped ricotta. I am currently writing a very belated review, because I ate somewhere else tonight that had ricotta in its salad, and it just does not compare -- somehow, Barbacco is capable of making an extremely light, fluffy ricotta that makes the whole salad come together. Thank you for always making my day with that salad.\n\nFor entrees, a must-have is the orecchiette. It's on the saltier side, but if you can appreciate freshly-ground pesto, handmade pasta, and generous portions, get this dish. I'm glad to see that this is still on the menu.\n\nBarbacco's atmosphere is sleek, dimly lit, and loud. They are also slightly pretentious, but what's new with that in FiDi? I did not appreciate being temporarily turned away once when the restaurant was nearly empty, because the friend I brought with me happened to look, say, in a more rugged attire. Otherwise, I am usually seated right away at the bar. It gets crowded, so reservations are recommended if you are going to be more than a party of one. \n\nLast thing: the wine on tap is underrated -- it is delicious, and I order it every time.", "author": "Letitia L."}

My boyfriend and I first came here a few years ago and I have been hooked since. We have been back for birthdays, celebrations and random Tuesday nights because this is \"our restaurant\" now. The food is always SO GOOD. I usually get the orecchiette, the \"little ears\" pasta. They make it with kale, but the other night it was with broccoli and sausage. I'm never disappointed. The pasta is so fresh, not sure if they make it here or not, but it's delicious. My bf usually gets the lasagna (highly recommend) but he tried the special that night and it was wonderful as well. The service is always great, I never feel rushed and can linger once we're done. Their desserts and coffee are fantastic as well. Highly recommend the almond cake and sorbet. Their lattes are great too, they use Me Espresso coffee and I swear it's the best tasting coffee.

My friend and I walked in, put our name on the list but didn't even have enough time to finish our glass of wine at Michael Mina next door. That's what I call fitting in. \n\nOur host sat us at the end of the bar, where the scene was busy, busy, hustle, hustle! The momentum of the staffs precision and attentiveness showed they run a tight nit operation here. At one point I think we had three people attending us.  \n\nWe starting off with the fried Brussel sprouts, Burrata salad and Chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 as our appetizers to share. The brussel sprouts were tangy from the capers with a, slightly crisp outer layer finished off by a plump, tender inside. I could have passed on the burrata salad. It came with a side of whole garlic. I don't know about you but I'm not one for chowing down on whole pieces of garlic in a salad.. or any other dish for that matter. The cheese was creamy, easy to spread but reminded me of a watered down manchego. Pass. The chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 on the other hand was amazing! Spread out on a slightly toasted slice of bread and topped with caramelized onions. It was a mix of sweet and meat and it was divine. \n\nBy now we were on glass 2 of the '05 Claret, which mind you, each new pour came with a fresh new glass. Class! This complimented our main dish - the Lasagna Bolognese. I will admit I was a little skeptical with the spinach pasta. My doubts were settled with the first bite of melted cheese, creamy b\u00e9chamel and soft pasta sans all the usual oil in most lasagna meat dishes. I was stuffed at this point so I literally had 3 bites. Those 3 had me wanting more, I just couldn't! We packed it up. We were then offered a final glass of wine while the staff closed shop. Although we were the last customers in the restaurant, not at any point did the staff say 'hey! uh we want to go home'. They allowed us to enjoy our time and enjoy their space.

Both times customer service was top notch.\n\nFirst time I stopped for a glass of bubbles and a variety cheese/spread plate , while waiting on a friend early evening. It was very pretty arranged and very tasty, the sparkling wine was good (it was not the cheapest one so it better be good :) ) \n\nSecond time I went was for lunch with co workers. I ordered bruschetta with the chicken liver pate and vinaigrette caramelized onions. Texture was not well balanced and so weren't the flavors - seemed like the liver was deluded  with something watery, so you did not get the thick creamy liver texture and the taste was lost in the sweet taste of the onions. Main course was the eggplant sandwich. Insanely delicious , well balanced textures and taste, and not soggy as many places make it. Perfect bite! For desert I ordered the Coffee Panna Cotta .... I was very confused - it was made with mascarpone cheese, it had very soft consistency and the coffee lady fingers on top - pretty large size, beautifully looking dessert arrangement , delicious tiramisu... They don't have tiramisu on the menu, so I know they did not bring me the wrong desert. Still good to try, just don't expect Pana Cotta, haha \n\nTables are way too close to each other, I am a little curvy and had hard time going between the tables to sit on the bench.

The sandwich was tasty - slow roasted pork topped with arugula and red onions (sweet).  \n\nThe Orechhiette was cooked perfectly and combined with sausage (not a lot of it) and kale.  Actually, I did not know it was kale until later - it did not taste earthy.  Both were ample portions.  \n\nI was impressed with the preparation of the brussel sprouts - crispy on the outside and tender in the middle.  But the flavored bored me after a while as it was just vinaigrette.  \n\nThe service was great - attentive but not overly so.\n\nDefinitely good food and service at SF prices.  However, I am deducting a star since they pass along the extra heath tax/surcharge - IMHO this should be covered by the restaurant/management and calculated in their pricing just like every other operating expense.  I personally do not like being surprised with extra line items on the bill.", "author": "Roy L."}

Blame the dago blood that runs in my veins, maybe, but, for me, I could eat an entire meal consisting of a cold cut and olive spread and be content. Luckily, Barbacco has all that and more. \n\nMy family, gf and I wanted to end our last night in SF with a nice dinner, and although my parents had initially booked themselves at Perbacco next door, once they popped in here to meet us for a drink they decided to just stay and eat. It's got a contemporary decor, modern but not overdone, although I will say the chairs used here and awkward and not very comfortable. If I'm sitting down for a meal, I want a back to my chair. I need my moments of sitting back to wallow in my own crapulence. \n\nEveryone was hungry, so we ordered up a mini feast before ordering up a bigger one. Wine arrived, followed by a bowl of marinated olives (a nice variety, too), salami, breads, toasted almonds, and various cheeses. This was my kind of spread. They've got a decent selection of local brews on tap, so I got a refreshing beer that paired well with the meal. \n\nI ordered the flat iron steak, which looked absolutely delicious but keep in mind it comes with nothing but a bed of arugula. Thank to a Yelp tip, I knew the brussels sprouts were the thing to get, and GOOD LORD were they right. My steak, good as it was, almost became second banana to these little savory vegetable treats. The sprouts are fried in duck fat, with anchovy and a red wine vinaigrette. Out-effing-standing. Everyone at the table couldn't stop eating them, and I almost thought we had to order another plate. \n\nI sampled everyone's food, and it was all fantastic. All, that is, except my brother's pork chop, which was a fatty mess. To make up for it, the waiter sent us over a couple of desserts. I was in full fatty mode scarfing down these sweet treats after I'd just eaten a mountain of appetizers and an entree. And other people's entrees.

Fortunately I only felt mildly stupid when I got the two mixed up. So pay attention, because an egg is a terrible thing to waste.\n\nI have to say that the service was barely polite though very professional. Our server didn't seem to care if we were there or not and we had to flag him down a few times in order to get basics like drink refills and bread. Considering we were in a larger group he wasn't particularly helpful when it came to selecting dishes for our dining party to share. I just wish he was more engaged with us as I think it would have made our evening far more memorable. \n\nBeing in a large party, who were all into sharing family style, gave us the ability to try a large swath of the menu. However the online menu is different than the menu you will actually order from. We were really there for the beef cheeks so imagine our horror when we noticed that they weren't present. Certainly not a deal killer but very disappointing. We did manage to order a ton of food and for writings sake Im going to feature my favorites. To be fair, there wasn't a single dish we didn't like. \n\nchickpeas - Scented with the robust smell of rosemary, these were cooked so well that they literally smeared into the ACME bread we were served, little did we know we should have rationed the bread out.\n\norecchiette - The pasta here is dynamite! Big chunks of sausage in a sauce made from cavolo nero, a type of leafy green related to kale, that reminded me of pesto. Lots of delicious green oil pooled at the bottom of the bowl, just wished we would have had more bread to sop it up with. \n\nchitarra - Thick al dente noodle awesomeness! This was the most favorite dish on the table. In fact the rich sauce and meaty balls had us almost ordering another one. Hearty, comforting and delicious.  \n\nbrussels sprouts fried in duck fat - What's not to love here except they were cold when they were brought out. But we were so enamored with the chitarra we just let it slide. If we visit again we will be sure to make sure they're piping hot when they hit the table. Anyways, the red wine vinegar added a nice pop of flavor that cut through some of the fatty rich flavor of the brussels, I love that kind of balance. \n\nAs you can see I had a lot of love for the food here.

Their Brussel Sprouts Fried in Duck Fat is still a dish I order each time. However, the last few visits has been a bit less than perfect. At least, I felt like there's something more to work on in terms of service. Perhaps the restaurant is THAT busy, I find the wait time between ordering the food and food delivery to have lengthened by quite a bit. Perhaps it may be the food we order for appetizers that take longer than usual to prepare, I seem to find my eyes wandering to the kitchen more often than before.\n\nNonetheless, their menu still calls me back every so often. I've tried quite a few of their dishes. I missed their little jars of mixed mushrooms, but I found a new favorite appetizer: suppli. These croquettes are extremely hot when they were served. Fresh out of the fryer, its outer layer is very crispy and not burnt, creamy mushroom risotto to balance out the crunchy texture, and with a good sized of mozzarella cheese melted in the center. I can tell you, one is not enough. You can definitely share it with your table, but I guarantee that you will want more.\n\nIf you're a fan of sashimi, perhaps you can try their Pesce Crudo. It's a small dish with marinated raw fish and other fruit pieces. I would say it's pretty standard. It's nothing too exciting, but this dish is a little beauty.\n\nIf you're coming with a party of 4 or more, think about splitting their chef's choice of salumi. There's a little bit of everything. It's a great finger food plate that doesn't have a long wait time.\n\nIn my last visit, I've tried their daily special of a Ciopinno, a seafood stew with mussels, shrimps, fish, and squids. It's very rich in flavor, but not extremely thick in texture. Be assure that the stew does not mask the flavors of the seafood, but does the opposite. Compared to my swordfish, I love how soft and sweet the fish was in the stew. And by sweet, I mean that unique seafood sweetness, not your white sugar sweetness. I'd love to see this on their regular menu.\n\nAs for dessert, their Espresso Panna Cotta is a decently sized dessert for $5. It's not extremely sweet. Something you cannot go wrong with especially if you can't decide on a coffee or a dessert. Why not both? If you're not a fan of pudding, you can always opt for their gelato. I've had their Vanilla Gelato with Valhrona Chocolate Sauce. You can't go wrong with vanilla, it's not extremely sweet, but you can smell the vanilla essence seeping into the roof of your mouth. With a bit of salted chocolate syrup that is more of the dark and bitter side, the sweetness of vanilla is not too overwhelming. \n\nIf you're a big chocolate lover, you should try their Chocolate Nemesis Cake. I do recommend you to share. It is quite... chocolately...", "author": "Connie C."}

The beef stew was very rich and again really good although a little spicier than I thought it would be. I'd order again if they could tone it down a little. The orecchiette was very tasty although I would have liked a little bigger pieces of sausage. Pasta was cooked perfectly.  Clearly both Perbacco and Barbacco know how to do pasta right.\n\nWas a  little disappointed they didn't have rose' by the glass. It would have been really nice with the warm weather. Food came out fast and service was good. As others mentioned, very difficult to carry on a conversation though.  I'd deal with it though for the food at decent prices.\n\nStreet parking was easy with free meters after 6pm. Financial District pretty much closes down after work.", "author": "Stacey R."}

I had the corn rigatoni with butternut squash which wasn't lacking in the taste department, and surprisingly is gluten free. \n\nBeing in the location it's in, their menu was fairly economically priced.

Although a weeknight and (still) raining, they fond me a seat. Yes, in a corner, but under the circumstances can't complain; it was packed. \n\nRestaurant is more shaped like a bar, long and narrow. I almost walked into the mirror before realizing it was not a really really long room.\n\nOK, started with Barbacco Punch, pomegranate, apple, orange, lime, prosecco. Mild and sweet (unlike me!) and the kale/roasted squash salad. Salad also had apples and pomegranate so they matched, which is why I picked the drink. Salad fresh, good dressing, perhaps could have used a bit more of the squash. Asked for Acme bread with salad, but I was nearly done with salad when it arrived. Small demerit.\n\nThen got rigatoni with lamb sugo. Pasta correctly al dente, nice tasty sauce, portion good size as in enough to fill but not stuff. For dessert had the milk chocolate concoction - not on the on-line menu so not sure what it's called. A mousse-like (but more solid than most mousse) square with whipped cream, a chocolate crunch \"crust\" surrounding it. All good. They added, however, candied rye berries and kumquat syrup which did not add anything. The syrup was too sweet. The berries a distraction. But the chocolate part was really good. \n\nSummary: Good but not stupendous food, reasonable price for SF, noisy high energy place. Good for a convivial outing, not a place to hold a meeting or to unwind. Not a knock, just a fact. Considering how packed it was service pretty good, quick at least. \n\nI might return although not on my priority list.", "author": "Carol S."}

Although he was visiting from Oahu, at least he was rooting for the Warriors!\n\nSo, being the wonderful friend that I am, I told him we could watch the game at a bar before our dinner.  That's how we ended up at Barbacco.  Upon entering, we were greeted by two hostesses, one was a younger girl who was probably new or on training because she seemed to have to ask the other lady (she might be the manager since she was pretty much everywhere) for clarifications on quite a few things.\n\nWe were told that we couldn't sit at the bar if we weren't ordering any food...but we already had dinner reservation so it wouldn't make any sense for us to eat right before our meal.  But the \"manager\" told us that she would make an exception just for us, which was very sweet of her.\n\nRyan had a glass of red wine while I had my delicious Sprite.  The bartender asked us if we wanted to order any food, but we told him we were fine with just our drinks so he didn't seem very happy with us at all.\n\nHonestly, this place has a really nice feel to it.  The bar looked clean and immaculate.  Loved the way they have all the wine glasses nicely laid out.  If you're a beer or wine drinker, you're in great hands because that's all they serve at the bar.  If you're a cocktail drinker, you'll have to look elsewhere...\n\nBut now that we both know what the food at Michael Mina tastes like, we should've just stayed and had dinner at Barbacco instead.  We would've been able to watch the remainder of the game instead of just half time.  I'm sure Ryan would love to the beat the crap out of me, if he were reading this review.

The portion was generous and tasty according to one of my team member's. \n\nFarrotto ($13) - farro \"risotto\" / roasted mushrooms / spinach / parmigiano reggiano - I asked the waiter to skip the parmesan since I'm not big on cheese.  IMO, the risotto was delicious even though the pamesan was omitted. It was less creamy, but the texture was still good.  Plus, I didn't leave feeling sick to my stomach as the cheese usually makes it very rich.\n\nPaccheri ($13) / rustic pork ragu / parmigiano reggiano - Two of my colleagues ordered this and they both seemed to enjoy it as their plate was spotless.  \n\nCorn Rigatoni ($14) (gluten free) / cannellini beans / radicchio / bacon / parmigiano reggiano - My co-worker who is even pickier than I am when it comes to eating enjoyed this dish.

That I could just fast forward to dessert and wine, skipping the protein and vegetables? \n\nTo quote Elaine Benes, \"get out!\"\n\nHaving eaten alright sushi at a joint nearby that didn't have any desserts, my friend and I just beat the buzzer and got to Barbacco before they closed at 10pm. The idea of using a restaurant for a dessert felt a little risque and naughty, but I was intrigued, wondering if this is what adults do. Am I an adult now? Ugh. I entered Barbacco timidly and was upfront with the host that I only wanted a sweet nothing and a glass of wine. I closed my eyes in suspense and when I opened them I was sitting at the bar in front of an iPad wine menu. Phew-that didn''t hurt a bit. \n\nMy pal had been raving about the espresso panna cotta, and she was right to do so. It was perfectly light, with just a hint of java, and a dollop of feather weight whipped cream. On the richer and lascivious end of the spectrum, we ordered the butterscotch-chocolate crunch gelato, which was so good that I thought I might need a safe word. In the spirit of Portlandia, I would suggest screaming 'cacao' when you taste this, even if you have never seen it. Everyone will think that you're just crazy for the chocolate.\n\nThe adult drink menu is digitized on a very adult toy-the iPad. Even though my fingers were covered in sugar they let me use it. The wine is obviously Euro-centric, but I kept scrolling down for a California Zin from Poco a Poco. Pours are generous, especially at the end of the night.

The secret to eating great Italian food in San Francisco is making sure you dine with a true Italian who knows the food of her roots. I was already a fan of Barbacco from my previous visit, but I really enjoyed the food this time thanks to my Italiano friend Linda who joined me for lunch there over the holidays. Since Barbacco is still very communal in approach given its rural Ligurian inspiration, we were seated in the busy counter area in the middle and had three dishes - all stellar and probably none I would have ordered on my own due to my own ignorance.\n\nWe started with the $10 Local Squid with 'nduja. Yeah, I didn't know what 'nduja was either until Linda explained that it's a special smoked pork salami from Calabria, the boot tip of Italy that looks like it's kicking Sicily. The salami is spicy with red peppers minced with shoulder and belly parts, sorta like an Italian version of an Andouille, and it's stuffed into the calamari pieces, then sauteed in bread crumbs (grattato) and accompanied by rucola greens (see photo). Delicioso! This was followed by a smashing pasta called Paccheri.\n\nYeah, I've never heard of paccheri either but it immediately became one of my favorites because it's the large, tube-shaped pasta that's much bigger than rigatoni and prepared al dente. The consistency was just right to take in the rustic pork ragu sauce and parmigiano reggiano shavings (see photo). So tasty and a fair bargain for $12  for the quality despite its simplicity. We wanted to see how full our bellies were before plowing into the third dish, a lovely $14 entree of Braised Chicken Thighs served with Creamy Polenta, Braised Broccoli Rabe and Garlic Confit (see photo).\n\nI bake thighs at home all the time but never this tender and certainly not with such luxuriant polenta on the side. The broccoli rabe and garlic provides just the right textural contrast to the meltiness of the chicken and polenta. We were three for three and most pleased with ourselves. Best of all, I've made a fan out of Linda who had never been to Barbacco before. Once again, the friendly servers at Barbacco never make you feel rushed. Just watch out for the flying elbows that may come your way from the Nob Hill matron seated next to you as she reshuffles her purse.

They both had been to Barbacco numerous times before and, consequently, already knew what they wanted to order the moment we were seated.  As the new recruit, I perused the menu with TWO criteria in mind:\n\n1) It had to be something I could pronounce properly - I did NOT wanna look like a complete fool on my VERY FIRST DAY\n\n2) I know that dishes can vary from restaurant to restaurant, so I had to get something fairly standard, something that nobody could put too many fancy schmancy (read: ultimately gross/unpalatable) spins on without creating something new altogether.  Again, I'm was the new girl on the block, and would likely have to sit and finish most of what was on my plate with a SMILE on my face.  Didn't want to make that a more Herculean task than it could already potentially be.\n\nAnd so I went for the \"lasagna bolognese - spinach pasta meat ragu / bescimella sauce,\" but of course, I just told our waitress that I wanted \"lasagna\" because \"bolognese\" was about 75% and, well, they completely lost me at \"bescimella.\"\n\nMy boss ordered a salad and my coworker ordered the porchetta sandwich.  (Side note - Funny enough, the porchetta sandwich became my \"go-to\" order.  I got it when I went to lunch with my dad a few months later, and with my friend at the beginning of this year.  SOLID!).  But before our waitress left, they looked at one another and nodded.  I was *just a little* jelly that they seemed to have, like, ESPN or something (Mean Girls!), but I was struck with actual terror when my boss added on an order of brussels sprouts.  \n\nWhat the what?\n\nMy dad loves brussels sprouts and while my mom doesn't LOVE them, she's the kind of Asian mom that enjoys eating bitter melon so the little green veggies are nothing to her.  But for me... dear, sweet, merciful Lord in Heaven whyyy would you create something that not only tastes bitter, but SMELLS bitter while cooking, too?  \n\nI was all smiles on the outside, but on the inside, I began to try and calm my nerves by telling myself that I only had to take maybe one or two of them to be polite.  Chew and swallow.  Chew and swallow.  Chew and swallow.  Oh gosh, my water glass is only 1/3 full!\n\nWhen the waitress came around with the brussels sprouts, I tried my best not to stare at them the way a woman will normally stare at her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend up in da club.  But I couldn't help it.\n\nThey, of course, offered some to me first and stared expectantly, completely unaware of allthefeeeeelings inside of me.\n\nI cut the little sprout in two and raised it tentatively to my lips.  I slowly began to chew it, put my fork down and began to reach for water to wash down the bloom of bitterness, but...\n\nNothing.  \n\nI finished chewing the half and then popped a second one in with much less hesitation.  Were these specially raised or something?  \n\nMy boss asked me if I liked it and I nodded my head, still pondering how different this experience with brussels sprouts was from any I had had before it.  \"Isn't it great the way they fry it in DUCK FAT.\"\n\nO_O!\n\nThe only poem I can recite from memory is Robert Frost's \"The Road Not Taken.\"  My 6th grade CORE teacher would be so proud.  Props to you, Ms. Anthony!\n\nAnyway, in the final stanza he talks about how taking the road less traveled by made all the difference.

The pasta tubes are expertly done, chewy and eggy, and the ragu complements the dish well.  The surprise at the table was the brussels sprouts, which are fried to a crisp in duck fat then seasoned with red wine vinegar.  I order both of these dishes every time I go and am always impressed.  \n\nThe bruschette are also worth mentioning.  The bread was chewy and crunchy without being too hard to eat with each of the toppings.

It wasn't spectacular yet it wasn't a disastrous meal or experience. We recently went in on a Saturday night for a late-ish dinner: around 9ish. It was nearly full, but it wasn't unpleasantly busy. The hostess was friendly and told us our table was almost ready. We waited a couple minutes and she escorted us toward the back of this narrow restaurant. As my friends and I walked to our table, I noticed an expansive and long bar area. The overall decor was fine; nothing was particularly outstanding. The choice of music throughout the night was \"interesting\" to say the least. It was a mishmash of disco, R&B, pop, and then the \"Game of Thrones\" theme song played... (My friend: \"Wait is this...?\" *listening* \"It's the 'Game of Thrones' theme song!\" Me: \"Ohhh...\" *shrugs*) \n\nAnyway, it took several minutes until our server greeted us and then it took awhile until he came back to take our order. I'm not sure if he was the only server in that section (which didn't look too busy), but he seemed to be MIA at times. On to the food: the kale salad is highly recommended. I loved the golden raisins and almonds added in for texture and bite ($8). We also ordered an antipasti plate of marinated asparagus ($5). My friends said they enjoyed that; it was fresh and bright thanks to the meyer lemon. I ordered the chitarra ($14) which was good, but some flavors didn't seem to pair well together. The pasta had meat balls, pine nuts, raisins, chard, and a spicy tomato sugo. The spiciness, for some reason, wasn't doing it for me. The heat didn't seem to fit with the other components and while I still enjoyed it overall, I probably wouldn't order it again. My friend ordered farrotto ($14) which was a farro \"risotto\" (so instead of Arborio rice, they used farro). It had spinach, parmigiano reggiano, and roasted mushrooms. This is a very filling dish and between my two friends (a couple), they couldn't finish it. We also ordered a side of brussels sprouts ($5) which were pretty good. It was fried in duck fat and had capers, anchovy, and red wine vinaigrette. I personally liked them a little charred as did one of my friends. Another friend with us didn't care for the preparation. My friends ordered dessert which was a chocolate polenta cake ($6). Flavor-wise, they liked it. In terms of the texture, my friend noted it was moist on one side and then dry on the other side. I'm not sure if they spoon syrup over the batter to keep it moist -- so perhaps that was an underprepared area... or was it over- or unevenly baked? Who knows? In either case, they were a little disappointed, but not repulsed. \n\nOverall, our experience at Barbacco was decent.

It feels pretty ghost-town-ish around 6 pm, even though there's plenty going on. And of course, there are nice restaurant gems like Barbacco that make it worth your while to come in on a Saturday.\n\nCame here as a party of six for a friend's birthday. It's a chic but casual setting, perfect for a get-together with a few friends. \n\nAnd the food is very delicious. As an appetizer, we shared the roasted octopus (delicious), brussels sprouts (again, delicious), and an artichoke that I believe was on the special regional menu (which, on our visit, was dedicated to Lazio, which encompasses Rome). \n\nBut dinner was where it was really happening. Everything was fully enjoyable -- and felt like you got your money's worth. I had the arrabbiatta, which was on the special menu, and I loved it. I had a very hearty portion. I tried a bit of my friend's corn rigatoni -- and while I liked it, I was glad i ordered the arrabbiata. Other friends ordered the steak, the meatballs, and the fish of the day, and had only great things to say. \n\nAfter \"carbing up,\" I wasn't ready for dessert, so I stuck with a cup of coffee (which was good). Other friends enjoyed the gelato and affogatos. And, they came out with a very nice birthday dessert for my friend - nice touch :)\n\nOther notes:\n\nServers were well informed, attentive, and very willing to answer questions.\n\nThe valets are friendly, and IIRC it wasn't all that expensive (but it's worth your while).\n\nI really liked coming here. I will definitely keep this spot in mind if and when I find myself in the  Financial District in the future.", "author": "Tami S."}

Since we had a varied group of diners with different needs, we ordered some veggie friendly options like the risotto croquettes and non meat bruschetta along with some meat dishes like the orechiette with the fennel sausage in there.  This place almost implies that your group shares family style.  I don't know any Italian place that doesn't do family style except maybe the Olive Garden.  \n\nThe service was great first of all although our food did take a bit longer than I liked.  The server was attentive and took our appetizer and main dish orders in a staggered fashion thus the delay.  When choosing and ordering things in a group, sometimes it takes extreme measures to get everyone to have an opinion and agree on a few things as they sip their wine and drink from their pint of beer.\n\nDespite us having a very late reservation, the staff did not give us the subtle hints for us to skee-daddle out of there.  Other than being a restaurant without a bar, Barbacco definitely satisfied all of my Italian food needs.  The food wasn't exactly bargain priced but it was worth the price to pay.

Was able to snag a 5:45pm reservation an hour before via opentable. Ambiance is nice and it's not too dark. There is no bar here, just FYI.\n\nFood is good and very reasonably priced given the location. Bowl of pasta for dinner, which is dinner portion, ranges from $12-$15 which isn't bad at all. Doesn't Olive Garden charge more?\n\nThe meat dishes are a little pricier, and definitely would not fill someone up on that dish alone.\n\nGot the burrata salad which was phenomenal. The burrata was fresh and sad on a bed of arugla. Came with four pieces of bread which were decently sized. Also came with olive tapenade (I don't like olives in general); sun dried tomato mixture and confit garlic. It was all delicious. \n\nThe spaghetti with mussels and nduja was GREAT. There was a good amount of mussels and it was spicy. We also asked for some bread so we can slop up the sauce afterwards. There was a good amount of savory-umami-ness to the pasta bowl, and the mussels were fresh and cooked perfect.\n\nSpicy spaghetti and meatballs, it really is spicy! If you need a kick, it's here. Although my friend did say \"oh it's spicy?\" It comes with two giant meatballs which was cooked perfectly and had good dimension of flavors.", "author": "Vanessa K."}

Barbacco fit the bill perfectly.  All four of us shared samples of our dishes with each other.\n\nWe ordered a full carafe of wine they had on tap.  It was a grenache of some sort- fruity but not sweet.  It had a unique and refreshing finish in addition to being reasonably priced at $42.  It comes room temperature, but they gladly brought an ice bucket to our table to chill it.\n\nFor dinner we ordered:\n\nPetrale Sole Special - lightly seasoned, fresh and healthy\n\n(2) lasagnas -  This was full of fresh Italian flavors, delectable and bittersweet taking the last bite.\n\nRoasted Cauliflower - Yummy, yummy...simple and tasty\n\nRoasted Sprouts - This was quite a hit with the duck fat it was cooked with.  I made sure there was no leaf left on the plate!\n\nButternut Squash - The balsamic was a nice accent to the sweetness-very soft and savory.\n\nPotato Leek was soup of the day.  It was creamy with a hint of sweet- very tasty.\n\nThe Cannelli Bean Maestra soup was similar to one that I make minus the carrots and celery.  This one was hearty with nuances of fresh flavors.  I will add carrots and celery to my soup from now on!\n\nFor dessert, we shared the butterscotch chocolate crunch which had heavy chocolate and butterscotch flavors.  It was heaven in a bowl and not too rich.   The egg nog panna cotta was my choice and totally satisfying.  I prefer desserts more on the light side.  This did not disappoint with some blueberries sprinkled on top.\n\nOf course, I have to mention the excellent service.   Our server was on point, friendly and a great attitude.

And the food had some good moments, but wasn't quite as exciting as I had expected. We had the stuffed dates and roasted pear bruschetta as an appetizer - the dates were pretty yummy, but I think they might have been even better without the tomato sauce. I liked the combination of the roasted pear and prosciutto, but I think it could have been amped up had the pears been warm.\n\nFor our entrees, my friend and I shared the paccheri pasta with pork ragu and the polpette. I feel like this is where things kind of fell down. The pasta was so al dente as to actually be a little hard to chew, and the pork ragu was alright, but not as meltingly tender as I had hoped. The polpette, meatballs, had kind of a weird texture - firm but kind of chewy.

The seats are a bit close together but I like peering over my neighbor's food so this worked out well for me. Plus, the menu is pretty good, especially at this price point in the Financial District.\n\nI went with the Farrotto- a risotto made with farro, fancy pants mushrooms, and a solid helping of cheese. This dish is comfort in a bowl and best of all, it's healthier than a traditional rice-based risotto (or so I tell myself). I also got the much hyped brussels sprouts cooked in duck fat, capers, and anchovies but thought they were a bit too salty? And that's coming from a man who loves his salt. If you peeled away the top layer of the brussels and got rid of the overwhelming coating, they were quite good but really, with all that effort, you might as well make your brussels sprouts at home. \n\nAll in all though, it was a good lunch with a fun vibe and I'll be back.", "author": "Nadeem A."}

The flavor on the pickled items was intense like biting into a lemon type of way. \n\nThe porchetta was pretty good, I'm a fan - 4 stars. Thick slices of tender and savory roasted pork wrapped in a foccacia like roll. I would have liked a little more texture and bite to the roll's crust since it was soft all around. The sweetness from the peach and red onion offset the arugula. I found myself missing the crunch from the pork skin and herb flavor from Roli Roti's version though.

It all started the day before when they called to confirm our reservation. Margo (I think that was her name) was so professional over the phone, but not uptight. She also gave us a HUGE heads up about the Chinese New Year parade that would close down a large portion of Market Street. Gotta give her props because it was a nightmare to get around that night. Our server (forgot her name) was awesome. Very personable, not stiff and gave us the full rundown of the menu and specials. She was fantastic all the way to the end. \n\nHere's what we got, my favorite starting from the top (FYI, our party of four shared everything):\n\nTUSCAN CHICKEN LIVER PATE w/ GRILLED ONIONS BRUSCHETTE ~ 5 stars\n\nCHITARRA (Hand cut pasta w/ Sicilian meatballs) ~ 5 stars\n\nROASTED PEAR, ARUGULA & PROSCIUTTO BRUSCHETTE ~ 4 stars\n\nPOLLO AL MATTONE ~ 3.5 stars\n\nCRUDO DEL GIORNO ~ 3.5 stars\n\nBROCCOLI RABE, MOZZARELLA & CALABRIA CHILI PEPPER BRUSCHEETE - 3.5 stars\n\nTAGLIATA (Roasted sliced flat iron steak) ~ 3 stars\n\nORECCHIETTE (pasta w/ fennel sausage) ~ 2.5 stars\n\nThe Tuscan Chicken Liver Pate Bruschette is a MUST HAVE. The creamy pate combined with the sweetness of the grilled onions was amazing. If you're in the mood for pasta while at Barbacco, go with the Chitarra. The pasta and sauce are excellent but the  star of the dish were the meatballs. Some of the best I've ever had. \n\nEverything else ranged from average to good, but they can't compare with the pate and chitarra. I have to mention that their chicken (Pollo al Mattone) was cooked very well - moist and tender. But it lacked flavor. I think that dish can absolutely be elevated a little more with the right flavors/seasoning. \n\nI would also stay clear of the Tagliata and Orecchiette. Both sound amazing but had no wow factor. In fact, the Orecchiette was a big disappointment. Instead, we should have went with the Farrotto or even the Lasagna Bolognese. Next time, for sure. \n\nBarbacco is located right next to their, I guess, parent restaurant Perbacco. I plan on going some time in the future since that's also been on my radar. \n\nAlthough Barbacco came up short on a few things, their top dishes more than made up for them.

Link to my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/perbacco-san-francisco#hrid:nwb3HCMlaCKgTEr34l9L7Q However, after my co-worker told me how much she loved Barbacco and after seeing all the rave reviews, I thought it would be a great place to take my friend for a belated birthday dinner after some HH drinks.\n\nOn Thursday, 3.24.11, my friend and I arrived promptly for 9 PM reservations and were immediately seated. \n\nF O O D:\n~~~MUST ORDERS~~~\n*ARACINI - RISOTTO CROQUETTES w/ Braised Short Rib & Mozzarella ($3/ea.): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=hRcdRsOTCUf1F9ETGNYXYg\n\nLike little balls of heaven, the aracinis were fried to a crisp golden brown and generously filled with short rib and mozzarella cheese. The combo of the crisp and creamy risotto, tender and savory short rib and ooey gooey cheese made me savor each decadent bite and left me wanting more.\n\n*DUCK LIVER PATE w/ Balsamic Onion Marmalade Bruschette ($3 ea.): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=2f5fKFbVbhsfvlXuQkRUng \n\nThe velvety smooth pate was slathered atop a toasted bruschette and then topped with a tangy and sweet balsamic onions which created the perfect balance of savory and sweet flavors. \n\n*RUSTIC PORK RAGU ($11): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=JitWsHBccuGUiT0r3v1k5w\n\nThe al-dente paccheri (large, hollow, tube-shaped pasta) was interwoven with the thick, savory, and tangy pork ragu. The pork ragu was packed with bold flavors and the sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano added a subtle rich tang. (I must note that the pasta was very al-dente and if you like your pasta on the softer side, you may think the pasta is undercooked.)\n\n*FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS w/ Capers, Anchovy and Red Wine Vinaigrette ($4): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=roeTvwXjT1tQmj3G2DLFaw \n\nTossed in a tangy red wine vinaigrette, the fried brussels sprouts remained crispy on the outside and was tender in the inside. The capers and anchovy added a layer of saltiness that complemented the subtle flavor of the brussels sprouts without being overwhelming. \n\n~~~GOOD~~~\n*MOZZERELLA DI BUFALA w/ Asparagus & Fried Capers ($12): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=Ya0HbDrm6bII0fqjVtPdYg \n\nThe huge asparagus spears were crisp and tender and the fresh mozzarella was rich, light, and creamy. The fried capers paired with the mozzarella and asparagus by adding layer of crispness, as well as, a burst of subtle saltiness.\n\n*SPICY BRAISED TRIPE w/ Tomato & Sage Over Grilled Filon ($8): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=ikGA6ljKkvlWqa7jobloew \n\nAlthough the tripe was perfectly braised to a soft and rich tenderness, it lacked heat and the accompanying filon (Italian bread) became a complete soggy mush after sitting underneath the tripe stew. \n\n*HOUSEMADE DUCK SAUSAGE w/ Cannelli Beans, Balsamico & Onion Marmelleta ($12): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=FFUx5Ng4LMAS39XqzpVneg \n\nAn Italian take on bratwurst and sauerkraut, the duck sausage had a snap to it upon biting into it. It was tender, juicy and flavorful with a hint of gaminess. The cannelli beans were rich and creamy while onion marmelleta gave the dish a fresh burst of sweetness and tanginess.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nDown-to-earth, friendly and attentive. Our first 2 dishes came out within minutes of ordering, however there was a 25 minute lag before getting our other dishes. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nCompared to its upscale cousin restaurant, Barbacco is very hip and casual with contemporary furnishings, exposed brick walls and iPad wine menus.\n\nBarbacco is not really meant for an intimate dinner as the tables are in close proximity and the noise level can get very high.\n\nP A R K I N G:\nRelatively easy street parking on weekdays before 6 PM. Valet parking is available during dinnertime for $10.\n\nAfter a disappointing experience at Perbacco, I was pleasantly surprised at all the dishes at Barbacco which were mouth-watering and packed with bold flavors.

I was referred to Pandora. I was having trouble hearing what she was saying because of the background noise in the restaurant. When I asked her to speak up over the noise, I still experienced significant difficulty in comprehending what she was saying. I then asked if she could step away to somewhere within the restaurant that was a little less noisy so we could hear each other and she said in a very rude tone, \"No, I work in a restaurant.\" \n\nClearly, she could hear me and that's all that mattered to her. I have worked in a restaurant and I understand the madness of the lunch rush. Often times, it is difficult to hear customers over the telephone but I always made an effort to walk away to a more quiet corner or at the very least, take down the customer's phone number and return the phone call after the lunch rush or maybe during the afternoon slump. \n\nI have dined at Barbacco several times and this one employee's attitude has left a lasting bad taste in my mouth about the restaurant. \n\nWhen you're spending $2,000 on catering, especially from a restaurant like Barbacco, you expect a much higher caliber level of customer service.

When we walked in, there's actually a line of people waiting to be seated (so make the reservation if you don't want to wait). However, we got seated at the bar, which has limited space (I seriously bumped into the guy next to me 3 times before I decided to move my chair infinitely closer to my friend's side).\n\nThe decoration of the restaurant is pretty modern, clean and classy. There are mirrors on the far side that made the restaurant look twice as big as it actually is. \n\nNow let's talk about the food. I would NOT say that the food here is to-die-for, but it was definitely different from any other sandwiches that I've had before. We ordered the lamb shoulder sandwich with broccoli leafs and the chicken salad sandwich with almond and a lemony/orangy dressing. I don't want to describe the taste too much because I simply cannot put it into proper words, but both sandwiches tasted more Asian-Fusion than Modern Italian to me. The lamb one has a minty/wasabi taste, and it's kinda bitter. The chicken salad one had tender chicken and crispy almond, combined with the dressing was light and sweet. However, the bread was so HARD and the sandwich fell apart after the first bite.\n\nMy friend ordered the lemonata, and she thought all the different flavors (classic, mint, cucumber, ginger, strawberry) were put into one drink.

I've passed by Barbacco several times and read positive reviews, but for some reason I have always ended up elsewhere for lunch.  While their next door neighbor Perbacco emphasizes a more elegant feel, Barbacco has a more casual, down to earth atmosphere, without compromising quality.\n\nThe place was busy, but not chaotic; classy, but not pretentious.  And, best of all, sophisticated, but not expensive.  It's the type of place you can take a client for a business lunch or just ham it up with friends.  Service is also very good, plus you can place your drink order on Ipads, how cool is that?\n\nAnyway, I tried the Slow Roasted Porchetta Sandwich.  While not quite as juicy and meaty as Roli Roti, the sandwich was very very good.  The meat was tender.  It had a hint of saltiness, that when mixed in with the sweetness of the roasted grapes and red onion, results in a fascinating medley of flavors.  This sandwich was a bargain at $10, well worth it.

So maybe I don't eat Italian food enough, but I had no idea what this was after reading the description (other than that it had cheese), so I googled this. A search on cavolo nero came up with kale. And well fennel sausage seemed like just sausage and same with the cheese. Then when my dish came, I realized it seemed like some sort of pesto sauce. (Which was a little disconcerting because I'm allergic to nuts, and pesto can sometimes have nuts). Basically after waiting maybe 15 minutes, I was finally able to flag down our waitress and ask if the pasta contained nuts. (Meanwhile my friend was just devouring the meal -_____- ) And when I finally asked our waitress, the restaurant was loud so I misheard her and thought she said YES there are nuts, which quickly turned my face pale. But luckily when I clarified, she said (yes) they are aware that people have nut allergies, so they make their kale pesto without any nuts. \n\nJust to clarify, the Orecchiette with the kale pesto sauce is nut free!\n\nBut my actual orecchiette was very dense and filling.

The red wine vinaigrette that they were tossed in was amazingly salty and tangy.  I could have eaten a bowl of these!

Techie BF liked this very much.  Non-techie me thought it would be gimmicky but actually it worked well.  It was organized by types of wines and regions.  Once you made your selection, you could learn more than you ever wanted to know about the wine and then order by the taste, glass, quarto, mezzo, or bottle.

Overall, it was a great experience and I would give the restaurant another visit if I'm in the area. Here are the details:\n\nAPPETIZERS\nThey have a diverse selection of appetizers (vegetables, seafood, salami, bruschette) and I went for the ROASTED CAULIFLOWER, which included a combination of tomato, garlic, chili, and arugula. The dish was more like a salad with the amount of arugula. Cauliflower was awesome; my only complaint was the small portion size for $5.\n\nMy friend had the CREAM OF MUSHROOM soup...which was good....but nothing special. It did the job.\n\nPASTA/MAIN\nI went with the ORECCCHIETTE \"little ears\" pasta with fennel sausage, cavolo nero (kale) and pecorino cheese for $13. I didn't really expect anything amazing, but I was presently surprised by the flavor and combination of simple ingredients. I can admit I've joined the kale band-wagon and there was plenty of it....so if you're not into the green veggy, don't try this dish. The fennel sausage added a little kick every couple bites, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and I had a very satisfying meal.\n\nMy friend had the POLLO AL MATTONE (chicken \"under a brick\") with salsa verde and grilled lemon for $18. First thing we realized was the portion size was pretty healthy and satisfying for one person. The chicken was done well and it was a very simple dish...literally just chicken, salsa, and a lemon. So if you're looking to be a little more adventurous I'd stray away. If you're looking for a simple and hearty dish, go for it!\n\nCONCLUSION\nI'd recommend BARBACCO to my friends. It was a clean restaurant, had a pleasant (not too loud, not too quiet) atmosphere, and the staff was responsive and efficient. We went on a Saturday night and it got pretty crowded by 7pm, so I'd recommend booking reservations in advance to be safe.\n\nUntil my next review...HAPPY EATING!\n\nTyler", "author": "Tyler J."}

The hostess was even nice enough to provide free seasoned almonds to snack on during our wait. A few of my favorite dishes were the bruschette (all of them) and the orecchiette.

We at first had a hard time figuring out what the point of the ipad was. Basically a glorified drink menu, and don't be afraid to click on anything... even though there's a \"shopping cart\" you don't actually get charged unless you order straight from the waiter. Interesting overhead cost.\n\nAnyway, service was slightly slow and food slightly overpriced, but overall was decent. I ordered a honey ale and the cornish game hen. The hen was well seasoned, but the mustard green salad that came with it was a bit too tart. All washed down nicely with the ale. Also note, if you are looking for a private affair, this is not the place. Four of us shared a table of 6 with 2 others. Totally fine since we were all friendly.", "author": "Veronica C."}

A nice modern + sophisticated restaurant filled with your normal FiDi lunch crowd.  It's the perfect spot to conduct a business lunch or catch up with old friend.  Staff was very attentive and knowledable. Definitely seeing a crowd during lunch time is normally a good sign already.\n\nFor starters, my friend and I picked a trio of bruschette that consisted of the duck liver pate (my fav out of the 3), smoked lonza, and the house cured sardines.  I'm personally not a sardine person, but my friend insisted that I give it a try.  To my surprise, it was rather yummy, perfect seasoning, not too salty or disgustingly fishy.  Per the recommendation of our server, we also had their soup of the day, which was cream asparagus and truffle oil. What a great starter, we should have definitely gone for the bowl instead of a cup! \n\nHaving such great starters, we had high expectations for our entrees. Without a doubt, we went for the slow roasted shoulder porchetta (to see how it compares to their Ferry Building competitor) and the orecchiette \"little ears\" pasta w/ homemade sausage.  Sadly, we were unimpressed by both dishes - bland and boring with too much going on in the sandwich.  \n\nWith some room left, we ended the meal with the butterscotch chocolate crunch gelato recommended by our server.  A great choice indeed, I loved the rich butterscotch flavor and the texture the crunch in each bite gave. \n\nAlthough we did not opt for any alcohol, another thing worth mentioning is their wine menu.  It was a nice touch that they've incorporated their drink list onto an ipad, very forward thinking and innovative.  \n\nAll and all, a nice meal with great company.", "author": "Janetto L."}

As an added bonus, stays open a bit later than most places in FiDi (10pm).  \n\nBut I've been here twice now, and both times was relatively underwhelmed by the food.  I loved the bruschetta, especially the (a) crushed borlotti beans and duck conserva and (b) roasted pear and prosciutto di parma selections.  The pasta, however, was over cooked (so couldn't even tell if it was homemade or not), and the sauce lacked any memorable flavor.

A small hallway of  a space is lined with sleek booths in the back, a long bar area and a number of tables up front. I dig the IPad wine ordering system. Unfortunately it doesn't sync with the waiter's wireless notepad or syncs over wireless to the main ordering system. the server had to physically pick it up and then enter the orders...still it's a cool way to save on paper and be able to update an ever changing list. I understand the French Laundry is translating their massive wine list to IPads too, so if it's good enough for Thomas Keller....\n\nOf the food we had:\n\n-arancini - risotto croquettes filled with braised pork, mozzarella and peas\n-nduja - smoked Calabrian salame spicy, soft served with grilled crostini\n-finocchiona - fennel seed and fennel pollen\n-nostrano - warm spices\n-mortadella\n-ciccioli with mostarda and crostini\n-gorgonzola / chestnut honey \n-taleggio / housemade fruit mostarda\n-cypress grove - humbolt fog / almonds\n-heirloom tomatoes / cucumber / red onion\n-orecchiette - \"little ears\" / fennel sausage/cavolo nero / garlic / pecorino cheese\n-polpette - Sicilian meatballs with raisins and pine nuts / braised chard / tomato sugo\n-paccheri / rustic pork ragu/parmigiano reggiano\n-torrone gelato\n-espresso panna cotta\n\nit certainly was a tasty small plates feast.

I had a 8pm comedy show to attend around Nob Hill and 7:15pm was cutting it close but I went with my gut (and my growling stomach) and took the reservation anyways.\n\nWent in around 6:45pm and luckily got seated at the bar around 7pm.

Super rich, almost tooooo rich, but definitely a must try!\n\nSEARED AHI TUNA ($24) = it was like two sticks of butter. The knife cut through the meat like butter and it melted in my mouth like butter. Uhm, YUM. The sauteed bell peppers paired well with the fish too.\n\nMUSSELS ($12) = I took forever to decide if I wanted this or not and I'm so glad I went for it. The mussels sank in a beautiful garlic and wine sauce. Super light yet very tasty. The toasted bread on the side was not enough for me to soak up all that leftover juice that I looooooved. I'm definitely ordering two bowls the next time I come back.\n\nTAGLIATA ($19)= my friend ordered this and I only took a bite of the perfectly cooked medium rare steak. Even though I barely ate it, the keywords: perfect, medium rare, and steak should say enough about this dish\n\nAside from me dropping my menu, napkin, and utensils several times, my overall first experience at Barbacco was four-stars-fantastic (5 stars if i had enough time for dessert) and for those who are wondering... yes, I made it to show on time to see the opening act :)", "author": "Margaret W."}

Can't argue with that!\n\nAfter my friend and I both decided on trying the \"Italy vs. France\" flight of wine (their wine menu is on an iPad!), we decided to order a bunch of things to share:\n\n- \"Italy vs. France\" wine flight (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=lTathI4o7runei-ak0acqA) - a red and white from each Italy and France\n- Ascolane (fried olives stuffed with pork) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=MYTa5TN7IDsZx23ma5S-UQ) - I'm not a huge fan of olives, but these were pretty good.  The pork wasn't dry, and I liked how the taste of olives was kept mild since it was stuffed with meat and fried.\n- Cured Sardine Bruschette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=oXMLDQyuCfBMv8exljb-SQ) - the best overall of the bruschette we tried.  I generally like pate more, but this one had more to it.  It was done well, the combination of flavors was more unique, and I liked how everything came together.\n- House Cured Lardo Bruschette (see above) - meh.  Lardo can be hit and miss for me, and I felt like the flavor needed to be a little more assertive and distinct.  It just tasted fatty, and it was hard to get past that.\n- Duck Liver Pate Bruschette (see above) - maybe it's because I have an affinity for pate, but I thought it tasted great and there was a generous amount.  The caramelized balsamic onions added a nice touch to the pate's richness.\n- Orecchiette (\"Little Ear\" pasta with Broccoli Rabe and fennel sausage) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=8kF7Z475Pe_jWti2kGVYPA) - simple (my friend and I both wondered if we could make it at home), but I liked it.  For me, the sausage and broccoli rabe were a great combination, and the dish gave me that \"comfort food\" feel.\n- Polpette (Sicilian meatballs with raisins and pine nuts) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=O83LT8sD3woPclwvCQQHHQ) - the waiter described them as \"fluffy\" and I can see what he meant.  Definitely more light than hearty.  They were just okay to me, but the pine nuts and raisins were a little different. \n- Espresso Panna Cotta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=YpFddV16TJTEp7tQVLSZQg) - pretty good.  The espresso flavor was strong enough to know it's there, but subtle enough where it wasn't overpowering.  Not bad to me, but I don't get panna cotta that often either.\n- Spiced Pear Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=Ox847whjO-CCc57dO1iRTw) - only tried a bite of it and I thought it was just okay.  The cake wasn't as spiced as I had hoped.\n\nEven though our bill came out to about $120 after tax and tip, the food is actually a really good value.  Half of our total was made up of the flights of wine ($28 each), and so the food portion came out to only about $25 each.  Definitely will keep it in mind for future dinners, and if Barbacco is any indication of what Perbacco is like, I'll be there a lot sooner than later.", "author": "Mike L."}

Be warned that you only get one slice, so if you're dining with a friend, or are particularly hungry, order more!\n\nFor my entree, I chose the paccheri. Delicious!

The only thing good about the experience was the bar tender. \n\nWe did a walk in, the hostess said 20 mins for a table so we waited turns out they seated us at bar without even asking us if it was ok, since we were hungry we decided to just go with it. \n\nWe orded cauliflower as appetizer and 2 main entrees.  We got our entrees before the appetizers, and the flavors were very disappointing as well. It's an Italian restaurant, but have no Ceaser salad on the menu and won't serve even upon request. \n\nOverall, we will defiantly avoid this restaurant in future.

Our very dear friend, who is a chef in SF, gave us a list of places he would recommend trying out. Of a list of 10 places, I picked Barbacco and was very excited to try the food! We had reservations for 9:30pm and the place was full. Service was nice, but the food was very disappointing. Between me, my husband, and two friends we had: the CHEF'S SELECTION OF SALUMI - our table enjoyed it, BRUSCHETTA - fava beans were overcooked to me and it was melting in my mouth (didn't like it), ARUGULA AND RADICCHIO salad - it was under seasoned and not much flavor at all, \nBEAN MINESTRA - it was good, LASAGNA BOLOGNESE - my husband really liked it, ORECCHIETTE - not much flavor AT ALL (this dish was the one that got my attention when picking the place to have dinner and it was very disappointing. It was super bland in good flavors but it was over salted! Pasta was undercooked too), FARROTTO - delicious!, ZITI - disappointing! (Pasta was undercooked too, it was SUPER salty (couldn't finish it), if it had 2 pieces of eggplant it was already a lot (wanted more), and didn't had much flavor besides being over salted, \"PEPOSO\" - delicious! , CAULIFLOWER - it was good, BABY FAVA BEANS - horrible :(  (it had no salt at all, overcooked, not much flavor!), and CHOCOLATE NEMESIS CAKE - AMAZING!!!! (Would definitely go back for it!)\nOverall, my experience wasn't good going to Barbacco that day. Oversalted dishes and not much flavor was what I got. I really want to go back and try it again another day and hopefully, it will be much better.", "author": "Flavia S."}

I mainly didn't come back because of the communal seating which I found inconsistent with the goals of a business lunch. But a colleague last week made a reservation here for us, and I was pleasantly surprised to see they had changed the seating such that two (or more) people can have a functional business lunch. Food was quite good. Atmosphere is a bit noisier and less upscale than its nearby sister, Perbacco, but prices are friendlier, and I guess that is the point -- to offer two different types of restaurants in the financial district. I will happily go back, particularly for a lunch with co-workers. To impress a client, will still lean toward Perbacco.", "author": "Fred E."}

I've now been to Barbacco at least 5 times since it opened in early 2010. \n\nI like to think that Barbacco is the more casual, hip, and trendy younger sibling to Perbacco, where you can get similarly inspired, highly refreshing Italian cuisine at far lower prices, and at portions that, while smaller, are still big enough to share with others.\n\nIndeed, Barbacco's more affordable menu encourages you to try many different things and share them with others. The casual layout - a long bar area as well as plenty of communal high tables - further promotes an open, social vibe. I've really enjoyed the duck liver pate and summer squash bruschetta, the gorgonzola with chestnut honey, the fried brussels sprouts, the flat iron steak, and even the Silician meatballs.\n\nI agree that the wine list on the iPads feels like more of a gimmick, if only because the service here is truly warm, engaging, and helpful - so you can get a far better suggestion from your server than you would slowly fumbling through the iPad menus.\n\nAll in all, highly satisfying food that's inspired by the far pricier Perbacco next door, but at far more reasonable portions and prices, plus a lively, casual, and engaging atmsophere. You can't go wrong either here or at older sibling Perbacco.", "author": "Vincent L."}

I actually had no idea that the menu had been pre-set so I was pleasantly surprised when the starters came out.\n\nSurprise Starter(s):\nFirst a variety of house made Salumi, ranging from mild to spicy, were brought out, followed by a spreadable salumi served in a jar and accompanied by toasted bread. I'm not sure, but I think it was raw or it looked raw, but DELICIOUS and Spicy! A first for me, and I devoured it. We also munched on grilled veggies and a variety of cheese. A solid starter it was! \n\nNext Up: Insalata\nFirst salad was duck served with greens and fruit. It was excellent and super flavorful, my favorite of the two. Salad number 2 was Rucola and Radicchio, a super traditional choice and served authentically with Parmigiano and Olive Oil. \n    \nMains: We had three to to choose from!\n1.Risotto made with farro (instead of Arborio rice), with mushrooms, parmigiano cheese and greens, maybe spinach or kale. Superb.\n\n2. Orecchiete pasta with broccoli rabe and pecorino cheese. I was officially wow'd with this dish, because this is a Barese dish from the South of Italy and it was served to perfection, so perfect, that I think even my boyfriends Nonna would approve. I was transported back to Italy in one bite. \n\n3. Polpette: Which are meatballs. These were good, but not the winners for me. They were a little dense for my taste. \n\nSide dish was brussel sprouts. Everyone loved these, but these were not the highlight of the evening for me.

It has a chill, casual and relaxed atmosphere, but nice enough where people still dress up and it's not exceedingly loud. \n\nI've been here a few times now, and always get the below:\n\n- Brussel sprouts: definitely one of the best I've had ever. Sooo flavorful and not overly bitter (the way some brussel sprouts are). The flavor just pops in your mouth! \n- 'nduja: this is a great appetizer for folks to share. They're generous with the crostini and it has a really spice/kick to it that I enjoy.\n- Pasta: I always get one of their pasta dishes because I love pasta and I think they cook it really well. The sauces are always tasty and the pasta is al dente - just how I like it. The portions aren't huge, so if you're a small eater like me, it's just right. If you're in a group I recommend ordering a few so you eat to your heart's content. \n\nDefinitely a must go! Parking is also convenient - never had issues for dinner.", "author": "Kimberly F."}

Wifey, kids and I were wrapping up our visit to the Exploratorium and since we parked around here, thought we could grab an early dinner.  Was easily able to grab a 5:30 Saturday RSVP (yes, that is when we eat dinner now!).  First minor knock... the seats of the dining table areas (not the booths, but the chairs on the outside)... they had very low backs and were 'bouncy' due to the design (You'll understand when you see them).  Weren't very comfortable, and I had the sensation that I was going to tumble backward the whole time.\n\nAnyhow, we ordered a medley of small apps, pasta mains.  Brussel sprout chips were delicious....as was the meatballs (the item that my wife always remembers to order there).  There was a spinach tortenelli type pasta dish (green pasta, as my girl called it!) which was also super tasty.  The tagiatelle (wide flat noodle) I believe in a ragu sauce was good... .although my little one couldn't eat it cause it had a slight spice kick to it.  And the pasta was a bit too al dente for me.  The burrata app was also a delight (We normally order burrata sides wherever we see them on the menu, and this one did not disappoint).\n\nWe ordered a small carafe of their cheapest white from their tap... which they were out of ... so ordered the cousin red.  Can't remember the exact name... something like 'Donkey and Goat'.  It was mediocre at best.\n\nI won't go out of my way to go back to Barbacco.

However, our server went above and beyond the call of duty in not only pointing out what things could be changed to be vegan, but which menu items she would recommend as being still a satisfying flavor AND suggesting wine pairings.\n\nThey got rid of the iPad for wine ordering that I mildly teased in my last review, and I think that was good. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the wine and was a joy to speak with, something that we probably would have missed out on had we stayed with an iPad. She gave us a few samples to help us make our selection, and we ended up choosing a Valpolicella--something I basically never drink--that was perfect for both of our meals.\n\nI really love Barbacco because with their location and sufficient reputation, I think they could coast, but I've never had anything less than a really delightful experience there, and this is coming from one of the most loathed dining demographics (vegan). I will happily go out of my way to eat here because there's just so much that I really enjoy about it.\n\n**It's also a great choice for bringing out of towners and family because it's uniquely San Francisco, but not too \"weird\" and not too expensive.

I wish they would allow you to order from the iPad, that'd be a nice bonus. \n\nI ended up ordering a fish dish along with some tea. I really wanted to get a cocktail but unfortunately they didn't have that as a option. My fish was divine. My only complaint is that the fish was served with some really good green vegetable (I believe it was spinach) which when I took a bite of one particular piece I had to literally chew it for 2-3 minutes and I still couldn't get it small enough for me to swallow. So I had to resort to finding an old receipt in my purse to spit it into. But other than that, I didn't have any problems with that dish and was more than satisfied with my meal.  My friend ordered the Flank Steak which I took a bite of -- that was also delicious. \n\nFor dessert, I had vanilla gelato with some chocolate sauce. They give you one scoop but it only costs $3 so I can't complain. I highly recommend it.

I came here last Friday for a nice(r) dinner and booked this place based on a friend's recommendation for 8 p.m.  The reservation was relatively easy to make.\n\nWhen we came, there was a small gathering of people waiting in the lobby area, but we briskly walked past them and were seated at the bar area.  Our waiter greeted us quickly and based on his recommendations, we ordered the meatballs, lasagna, roasted cauliflower, and a set of three crostini (chicken pate, butternut squash, and roasted duck).  \n\nMeatballs - you get three huge ones.  The waiter said that they're majority ground pork, but also ground shortrib.  I couldn't really taste the short rib, but regardless, they were pretty good.  \n\nLasagna - I was a little disappointed by this dish.  Although the entire thing screamed homemade, it just didn't comport with my expectations of lasagna.  It was a little flat, not very cheesy, and green.  Granted there was some cheese off to the side that I probably should've mixed in, but I'm not sure if that could've saved it.  The whole dish was a bit of a let down.\n\nRoasted cauliflower - although this was only a side dish, it was one of my favorites.  I appreciated the sharp lemony zest, and how soft the cauliflower was.  I've long been a fan of roasted veggies, but I didn't know cauliflower could be this good!\n\nCrostini - these stood out as some of the best of the meal.  I loved the chicken pate - it was spread on pretty thick onto the bread, and the ratio was a bit more pate than bread.  The duck and roasted squash were good too, but I do remember the squash was a bit salty.  I realize pate isn't everyone's thing, but if you do fancy it (or simply want to try!) I'd order it here.\n\nService:  Like I alluded to earlier, this service is dang good!  Our waiter was very knowledgable.  I was so impressed when we asked for recommendations, not only did he introduce us to his top 5 dishes, he also was able to describe them in greater detail than the menu.  He was great about getting us our prosecco and making sure our water pitcher wasn't empty as well as checking up on us during the meal, too.  Five out of five for service here!\n\nAnother random note is that there seemed to be a lot of people on dates here.  Yes, it's one of those places.\n\nBottom line:  Some of the food, like most restaurants, is hit or miss. I'd stick to the crostini and go with some sides, too.

This might not bode well, but...\n\n- three bruschette (chanterelle mushrooms in balsamic, pear and prosciutto, and Tuscan chicken liver pate), 3 for $8 - the mushroom one was my least favorite, as it was so overwhelming of vinegar; the chicken liver was my favorite, and I liked the fruit compote they added \n\n- orecchiette pasta with spinach and fennel sausage, $14ish? -  the pasta was well-cooked, but there was so much green that it almost killed any flavor\n\n- polpette (meatballs), $don'tremember - I thought there was a disjointed spice to this, but I liked the texture. Not my favorite meatballs (I think the ones at Piccino are better, but these are a better deal, considering the portion size)\n\n- brussels sprouts in duck fat, balsamic - good, but not great. Some of the sprouts were little vinegar bombs. I approached each with a little trepidation. \n\n- Nemesis cake, $5 - Yeah, it was only $5 for dessert! And we couldn't finish (not with our scoop of gelato for $3, either). It was such a good, chocolatey cake. Very tasty, indeed! \n\nNow, you might be wondering why this is still a four-star experience for me. Well, everything was super well-executed, and our server was stellar (she told us about a guy she dated that was covered in zombie tattoos), but I honestly feel that  my not 100% enjoying all the food was that I ordered incorrectly for me. I think that if I could do it all over and order different things, I would LOVE this place. But I already love the value!

The flavor combination was refreshing, but the servinfg is 3 small slices (sashimi sized) for $12 - just not worth it. I've had crudo at other SF tapas-style eateries at the same price point with more generous sharing portions. \n\nThe entrees were comfort food hits - I tired the spinach pasta lasagne and it just hit the spot, and my dining companion had the Tuscan beef stew over a creamy bed of polenta which was rich but not fatty/heavy. \n\nAll in all, a good meal to end a long workday.", "author": "Rachel M."}

Brussel sprouts were roasted and a delightful addition to the octopus.  The real show stealer is the burrata cheese and the toast served with it.  Absolutely savory and delicious.  The mussel pasta had a very good amount of mussels and a tasty broth, a bit on the spicy side to fully enjoy because of the sausage used.

A coworker of mine chose this place for a work team lunch and I thought it was the perfect selection. It was easy to make a reservation online through Yelp, and we were glad we did because it was bustling inside. \n\nThe decor isn't anything mind-blowing, but it's classy and clean - a long narrow space with exposed brick and sleek tables and chairs. I have to say I thought the iPad drink menu concept was a tad hokey, but I do see how it could really speed things up if the orders go straight to the bar. \n\nI was honestly more interested in the food menu, which was filed with enticing options. Because I was feeling indecisive, I ended up with the small watermelon salad and 2 bruschettes - the egg and anchovy and the duck liver pate. All were absolutely delish although perhaps the watermelon wasn't the best choice on the cold, blustery day. I could see it being a great meal in a heat wave though! The pate was so rich that I was really glad I only had one small piece of it. I also insisted on ordering the brussels sprouts with duck fat for the table, though I think I was the only one who ended up enjoying it. They were seriously some of the best brussels sprouts I've ever had, though I suppose anything described as being fried in duck fat can no longer be considered even remotely healthy. \n\nWe also ordered foccacia for the table, which was $1 for 2 big pieces, so we ended up having to get 3 orders. I tend to have a problem with places that charge for bread, though it was very yummy. \n\nI have to say that this lunch experience was very very close to a five star as I thought all of the flavors were excellent and so was the service, I suppose a few small things (the bread, how heavy the meal felt after going back to the office) keep me from giving it those coveted five stars, but I'd definitely recommend it and would love to return for dinner!", "author": "Christina P."}

The one downside is that they don't have a place for you to nap after you've stuffed yourself with their robust, stick-to-your-ribs Italian indulgences. Though, they do have plenty of soups, salads, and bruscetta options, if you want to avoid the post-lunch coma. \n\nWe went all out and ordered up a parade of enticing dishes: my personal favorites being the tender Olive Oil Poached Albacore Salad (Nicoise style), the fluffy Foccacia (soaked in olive oil, of course) and the soup of the day (Sweet Pea + Mint, if I remember correctly). I was impressed with the variety of dishes they offer, for every eater and appetite. The portions were quite large, and most everything was served in a boat-shaped bowl - a nice rustic touch. \n\nWhile lunch was fabulous, Barbacco seems ideal for dinner when you can linger and indulge a little longer (and explore that wine list everyone is talking about!)", "author": "Nique F."}

It is done terribly at most restaurants and usually tastes like you are eating Chef Boyardee.  Barbacco totally blew me away.  I will 100% come back for another visit, it is worth it just to explore their extensive menu.\n\nSO, what did I have:\n-Lemonade: Best lemonade I have ever had.  Truly tasted fresh squeezed and it was the perfect amount of tart.  \n-Minestrone Soup: Usually, I would never order a soup like this, but after creepily glancing at other people's tables, I shifted my expectations around food quality and ordered it.  Amazing.  So many fresh vegetables packed with so much flavor.  I have never had vegetables taste so good in a soup. \n-Lasagna Bolognese: Again, I usually never order lasagna since it typically tastes like someone dumped prego and cheese into a platter and baked it.  This was the best lasagna I have EVER eaten.  I can even describe the flavor profiles, but there was a perfect balance of flavor, texture.  I could eat this every day and be perfectly happy for the rest of my life. \n\nThe ONLY negative that I can think of for this place was their host was pretty darn snooty - We had 4 people in our lunch reservation and one of them (a VP of a company) couldn't join the lunch until halfway through since he had a meeting.  We had his order ready to place it when the waitress came around, explained this to the host, and STILL got a considerable amount of pushback to let us be seated.  I understand not wanting people to hold a table for an unreasonable amount of time just so they can wait for party members who may never appear, but we had even explained that this wasn't the case so I was a little baffled by his logic.  Eventually he gave up and let us sit down, but it was more of a struggle than I would have expected from a nice restaurant.  He also spent every time that he passed our table glaring at us since our 4th member arrived 20 minutes late right as the food arrived (as we explained).  \n\nAnyway, I've said my peace about that, but aside from that minor setback, this is a 5-star experience.

I am really glad we decided to wait the 20-30 minutes for a table at Barbacco (Wednesday around 7:30PM) - food was tasty and prices were extremely reasonable for high quality food (we paid $22 each after tax/tip). There is bar and table seating, but the space is not as large as it looks (the back wall is a very deceptive mirror). I would suggest making a reservation to avoid the wait. I also really enjoyed sharing everything we ate, even though this isn't necessarily a tapas restaurant. \n\n- Peach & proscuitto bruschette ($3 each, $8/three): Ok, just imagine this. Are you salivating yet? I'm pretty sure I have a Pavlov's dog response to savory sweet menu options. Peaches were succulent and proscuitto was fresh, and oh, I could eat this forever. You can mix and match the different bruschette varieties for the $8/three deal.\n\n- Brussels sprouts ($5): I'm a brussels sprouts fanatic, and I don't even like vegetables. These aren't the best I've ever had, but they get the job done. My main quip is that they don't have that crispy outer crunch.\n\n- Fried polenta ($4): Much like the brussels sprouts, these are what you expect, no surprises. The portion sizes for these sides are quite large, so I would suggest sharing or else you'll be drowning in sprouts and polenta.\n\n- Paccheri ($13): The pasta comes with a generous helping of pork ragu, which is tender and flavorful. The tomato sauce and pork is proportioned well with the pasta tubes, which are cooked just right.\n\n- Brown butter \"shortcake\" ($6): The whipped ricotta on the side sold this for me. It's not too sweet, but just sweet enough that it wraps up a savory meal.

There is one thing worse though, and that's when an announcement comes on informing you that the elevators are out of service. \n\nA bunch of us had just ordered dinner at Barbacco for take out. Since no one wanted to climb back up 38 flights of stairs, we decided to leave for the night and try to eat at the restaurant. We were super late to pick up our food, thanks to our trek down the (many flights of) stairs. We explained our predicament when we got to Barbacco, and despite being very busy they squeezed us in at the bar. They then plated our food that had been packaged to-go, and served us like we had ordered in the restaraunt. Everything was delicious, but more importantly we really appreciated the flexibility and the great service. \n\nLike an idiot, I forgot to take my receipt which I needed for expensing.

We made reservations beforehand, and it's a good thing we did. The place got crowded soon after we were seated at the bar. The place itself was quite small.\n\nI enjoyed the bruschette I ordered (roasted hen of the woods mushroom with parmigiano) and thought that all the bruschettes on the menu were really unique. My roommate ordered the tometta cremosa di pecora carletta (cheese) with honey almonds, which was delicious! Our mains were well put together and my flat iron steak was cooked to perfection. The menu may not be very big, but each dish was done very well.\n\nI did not get any alcoholic beverage, but they had big selection of beers and an even bigger selection of wines.\n\nDue to the small amount of space, I would not recommend this place for large groups.

My friend and I were sat a long table with six seats.  There were 4 diners (strangers) already present at the table and we were sat on the end, practically bumping elbows with our new tablemates!  \n\nOn top of that, the 4 people at the table weren't really talking that much so my friend and my conversation served as entertainment for them.  Very strange and I would not go to this restaurant again based solely on this practice.\n\nThe food was tasty.  Stuffed dates were out of this world.   Bruschetta was fresh and creative. I ordered a pasta dish which was, well, pretty much a standard mediocre pasta dish such as one would receive at Pasta Pomodoro.  Not as inspired as the small plates.\n\nThe kick in the face was the outrageous prices for beers: $8-10 for your standard selection of IPA, wheat beer, lager, etc.  The prices of the food were reasonable but how they can justify these crazy beer prices, I have no idea.  $10 for a glass of beer?  \n\nLastly, the tables and chairs were uncomfortable.  It seems someone mismatched the height when picking these out.  I found myself hunching over on my elbows a lot.  It was as if the chairs/stools were too high and the table was too low.  I am an average-sized person so not sure where the disconnect happened with the designer when this restaurant was conceived.  The stools have no back so you can either sit up perfectly straight or do the hunch.  My elbows were sore after the hour and half dinner.\n\nService was decent and the restaurant wasn't too loud (in this case I had wished it was a little louder considering the seating arrangements).", "author": "Jeff M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-11", "description": "Unfortunately Barbacco, has fallen quite far into Perbacco's shadow. Two weeks prior, I had tried Perbacco and the experience was wonderful. I have not written a review, but believe me the in house made pasta was wonderful. Walking into the restaurant it is fairly dim and intimate which is nice. At times it does get quite loud as you are sitting fairly close with fellow diners. I liked the glossy wood tables, but did not like the tile floors as much. I do understand that wood floors and wood tables would like a little funny together. \n\nLet me first start by saying that prices are very good considering that the restaurant is in a prime location in the financial district. Like every Italian meal, we were some Acme bread with butter and olive oil+vinegar. The Acme bread itself tasted good, but I wish it was warm, because the butter was incredibly difficult to spread as a result. As an appetizer my family ordered three brushettes. The three included, the tuscan chicken liver pate, mango and prosciutto, and the wild mushrooms. Of the three the tuscan chicken liver pate was miles away in taste and it was very smooth as well. The mushroom bruschette was unfortunately very eccentric because it tasted rather vinegary for some odd reason. The mango and prosciutto was all wrong because the mango overpowered the prosciutto so I didn't get the saltiness for balance. Next up came our entrees. My mother ordered chitarra, I ordered the farroto, and my brother ordered the orecchiette. First off I will say that the pasta themselves were excellent, each being a little chewy which I love in my pasta. To start the chitarra was somewhat pedestrian, as the sauce seemed a little bland and might have come out of a can. The meatball/sausage it came with however was very tasty. The farroto was extremely dissapointing because the mushrooms taste did not come through at all and the risotto itself was fairly bland. Salt and pepper next time please? The best was by far the orecchiette; by no means was it stellar, but the sausage was very good and the pesto was light and tasty. We shared two sides between the three of us, we shared the fried brussel sprouts and polenta. The polenta was nothing special and was just a filler. The brussel sprouts were definitely the highlight of the meal without a doubt. I could eat these little green, bashed on vegetables all night long. The leaves were nice and crispy and I am sure anything fried in duck fat is amazing. Brussel sprouts and chicken liver pate are two things not to be missed, while the rest was rather ordinary. \n\nService was unfortunately not a shining point either at Barbacco. They probably only checked up on us once throughout the meal which was strange considering this is an Italian restaurant. They did fill our water often, but I was saddened by the inability of our waiter to recognize our table more often. \n\nScores:\nAmbiance 3.5/5 Entrance is nice and the rest is modern confusion\nFood: 3.5/5 The .5 is added due to those terribly addicting brussel sprouts\nService: 2/5 I would expect the service we received at a Chinese Restaurant!", "author": "Mitchell L."}

I'll \"second\" all the reviews that basically say \"good food, but get your s#*t together.\"  There's simply too much competition of equivalent quality food in the market.  Service completely sucks.  A 12:30 lunch reservation gets you seated at 12:50 and at a cozy side-by-side counter table.  Really cozy for a business lunch with a stranger.  Hope he didn't mind my hand resting on his knee.\n\nOh, and when they tried to placate us for waiting even though we had a \"reservation\" they said they'd comp us an app.  Perhaps, if we had to time to fight and tell the server that the bill didn't reflect the comp.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-18", "description": "Tapas, tapas, tapas. After moving back to Norcal from Socal, I've been dying to find a tapas restaurant that could replace that empty hole in my stomach that was previously filled by Bacaro LA near USC. Thankfully, my best friend, Erica J., shares my love for tapas and took me to this little gem that she kept raving about. Originally, we had a reservation at Chapeau but since we were stuffed from eating at Waterbar earlier in the day we opted for a later reservation at Barbacco so we could share a few bites of different dishes. Upon arriving to the restaurant, we were promptly seated at two seats at the bar. Keep in mind the restaurant is quite narrow but quite reminiscent of what I'm used to at Bacaro LA. Now, because the age group is slightly higher, the noise volume is a little better and more subdued than the chaotic screaming matches that seems to exist inside the few walls of Bacaro LA. From the bartenders to the waiters and coupled with the ipad drink order menus, the service here is impeccable and it helped me stay excited for every tapas dish that came through. \n\nOnto the food & drinks!\n\n1. Ginger Lemonade & Strawberry Lavender Lemonade: As much as I enjoyed the lovely pairing of the lavender notes of the puree that neutralized the harsher sweet tones of the strawberry, I think I would have to side with the Ginger Lemonade between the two. The ginger not only brings in a refreshing spicy kick but also a refreshing mint-like chill in the back of your throat after every sip. Especially with the heavier food we were eating the whole night, the Ginger Lemonade would have been a better choice.\n\n2. Mushroom & Chicken Liver Pate Bruschette: It's saying a lot when a mushroom fiend like myself could easily say that the chicken liver pate bruschette stole the show. At first I was a little worried that the abundance of chicken liver may be overwhelming but the onion marmellata provides a sweetness that cuts through the creaminess. \n\n3. Cauliflower: I wish I could say more about this dish, but as it is I'm not a big cauliflower fan and to me it was just cauliflower in a sauce.\n\n4. Polpette: These sicilian meatballs were to die for. On the menu it says it's made with raisins and pine nuts, which would seem strange but I definitely did not notice as it was masked my delightful notes of spice, acidity from the tomato sugo, and paired with the chard on the bottom. However, these meatballs are huge so we did not even come close to finishing them.\n\n5. Mushroom Risotto: This dish came in a heaping portion of mushroom deliciousness. The risotto was a little harder than I would have preferred but I've never had such a satisfying amount of mushrooms in a mushroom risotto. A MUST for mushroom fiends like me!!\n\n6. Local Squid with Crushed Potatoes: This dish was such a delight since the squid was perfectly done with the rustic olive oil crushed potatoes. There is some kind of crack in the sauce of this dish because we cleaned this plate like it just went through the dishwasher. \n\n7. Lemon Buttermilk Panna Cotta: My first words to my friend when dessert came to the table? \"I hate when panna cotta comes in a bowl or dish and not on a plate.\" Why? It usually means a few things...it's usually mindblowingly amazing and trying to get the remaining bits from the corners is a complete pain. I was correct on both points. The lemon buttermilk panna cotta with its few pieces of strawberry and brown sugar sauce is to die for and had the airiness that we needed after the otherwise heavy meal. \n\nUsually, I'm really hesitant to believe a 4-star rating of a restaurant in SF because the sheer amount of reviewers usually tips the average and causes a higher rating than usual....but I totally believe it for Barbacco!! Perbacco, I'm coming for you next.", "author": "Christine K."}

The meat ball and sauce were extremely spicy.  The heat remained in my mouth for a good 5 mins. even after drinking lots of water.  As opposed to another yelper, I was lucky that our waitstaff was accommodating and willing to take another  order for me (I replaced with the orecchiette dish.).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-23", "description": "I love Barbacco! It may just be one of my new go-to places in FiDi. It's more upscale than a lot of nearby lunch spots, and it's also slightly pricier. However, I have yet to find an Italian restaurant in downtown SF that offers the same quality food at such low prices, so I'm definitely not complaining.\n\nThe atmosphere is somewhat dark but classy at the same time. It's quite versatile in that it would be suitable for business lunches, dates, or just a casual dining experience. There doesn't seem to be a lot of individual tables in the restaurants, as I mostly saw communal and bar seating. So it probably wouldn't be the best place to go if you're looking for a lot of privacy.\n\nNow for the food - I love everything I've tried from their \"Pasta etc.\" section. In particular, the farrotto (essentially risotto with mushrooms, spinach, and parmesan) was so delicious I'm developing a huge craving just thinking about it right now. The mushrooms and spinach were extremely fresh and the risotto had just the right amount of richness. If you're looking for something less cheese-heavy and light, I would also highly recommend the orecchiette. I've never had kale pesto before and Barbacco nailed it with this one. \n\nThe only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is because service wasn't as attentive as I would have liked. It gets busy around lunchtime, and it can get difficult getting a waiter's attention and they seem to be in a hurry to rush people out. Regardless, I love their menu selection and will be back many times in the future :)", "author": "Sunny H."}

Barbacco was near the top of this list, and fortunately, turned out to be an awesome find. Again, going against the voice of reason, I went for a full three course meal, late night indigestion be damned, getting a shaved asparagus salad, rustic pork ragu, and panforte, for a grand total of ~$25 after tax and tip.\n\nThe salad, served with spring onions and parmigiano reggiano, was a light, tasty, and surprisingly filling salad - the citrus flavors went a long way towards making it a great dish. The ragu, served with al dente paccheri (a fat tubular pasta), was also equally awesome, with an incredibly soft and flavorful pork. The panforte, a spiced fruit and chocolate bar, was probably the least interesting of the three, but was still good - not overly sweet, and reminded me of a fancy KIND bar.\n\nGreat food, excellent service, reasonable prices, and generous portions make Barbacco one of my list-toppers. I just hope I can ask the chef for softer pasta the next time around - I don't care much for anything prepared al dente, traditional or not.", "author": "Johnny W."}

The brussel sprouts here are always good and the orechiette is one of my favorites. I did really enjoy the nduja as well. The bruschetta was just bruschetta. No big deal.

Tables are communal, so note you might end up sitting next strangers and making friends.  \n\nAll around, Barbacco is great place to have a casual lunch or dinner in the Financial District.", "author": "Kimya P."}

Sparkling or still water was offered... the sparkling water was solid and we thought that we made a great choice of venue. It seemed like we were off to a good start.\n\n- Roasted Octopus was ordered, it was soft and tender, yet flavor was not fully present, it was decent but it lacked punch. When done, we didn't miss it.\n\n- House Cured Sardines; very bland taste, we really would not have known we were eating sardines if we hadn't specifically ordered.\n\n- We proceeded with our final dinner plate (pasta), Paccheri. The pasta tubes were not al dente, of hard texture and of mellow flavor; the pork was lacking in savory taste and a bit rough to chew.\n\n- Accompanying our meal were Brussels Sprouts fried in duck fat. After eating a few, the taste was just overwhelming and not in a satisfactory way. Our taste buds got tired of it quickly.\n\nDessert was also ordered, Gelato was good for the price and the Olive Oil Panna Cotta, nothing to write home about.\n\nAll in all, we will cross this establishment off of our list, it really should not be rated as high. If a place like this is getting good reviews, I would think that all of their dishes should be superb...\nPlain food at near fair prices.\n\nHowever, I will not discredit the service there.

The atmosphere always welcoming and the food has always been solid, I have never had a bad dish there, though my favorite is the Braised Chicken Thighs on the lunch menu and any fish of the day on the dinner menu. Everyone I introduced the chicken thighs to loved it and one of them mentioned it tasted like grandma's chicken and you know that's a tall order. I always start all my meals with the bruschette, you really can't beat the value of 3 for $8 deal. and end all of my meals with the nemesis chocolate cake. (They do change their menu seasonally, so please check for updates)\n\nMy favorite seating in the restaurant is at the bar because it offers better intimacy since the rest of the restaurant has communal style tables, and you get very attentive service at the bar. They employ very knowledgable bar tenders/waiters and they all seem to love their job, which is an extremely important factor for my dining experience. Do you remember the last time you went to a restaurant and the serving staff looked like they hate their lives? and how it ruined your meal? well. I do.. \n\nFor those of you who do not like to plan ahead and make reservations. The restaurant gets a little busy during weekday lunches because of the proximity of many downtown business buildings, but you shouldn't have a problem getting a table (walking) for dinner with a 15 wait maximum, which is another reason why I love the place because sometimes you feel like being spontaneous.. enough with the one hour+ wait for some over hyped restaurant in SF. \n\nFor those of you who drives, you can valet in front of the restaurant for $10.\n\nI have not found another restaurant in the city that offers the same value for the same caliber of food with such consistency in the city.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-21", "description": "The girlfriend's last job sucked. Fortunately, her services are very much in demand, so she quit. To celebrate her self-proclaimed emancipation, we had dinner at Barbacco.\n\nBarbacco is a well appointed, modern, trendy & hip take on traditional, casual Italian dining. We had reservations which did insure we would have seating, but not at our own table as the seating is either at 1 of a row of long communal tables or along the bar. Service was mostly attentive, considering it was very busy. Our server was deadpan, but the rest of the staff was warm with lots of smiles.\n\nWhile the food menu was on long, narrow paper stock, the beverages were listed on iPads located on each table & on the bar. Like many things Apple, this approach was entertainingly novel but didn't provide any true functional enhancement. The food selection is very faithful to authentic Italian, meaning if you don't read or otherwise know Italian you may not know what a dish is. Lucky for me, the girlfriend lived in Italy a while & more or less translated the menu.\n\nInstead of offering composed meals, everything is a la carte. The girlfriend & I picked out our own combinations of starter/ entree/ side. She got Spicy Braised Tripe, Paccheri w/ Rustic Pork Ragu & Parmigiano Reggiano, Fried Brussels Sprouts. I got Duck Cotechino Sausage, Orecchiette or \"little ears\" in Cavolo Nero w/ Fennel Sausage & Pecorino Cheese, Roasted Squash. The food took a while, so we had a couple beers & chomped on bread (which was good) while waiting.\n\nWhen the dishes started coming out, I was reminded of the oxymoron \"jumbo shrimp.\" All 6 of our dishes were like giant tapas. Trying all 6, all were well-made & delicious but 3 of the dishes had bigger, bolder flavors than the other 3. The Spicy Braised Tripe, Orecchiette & Fried Brussels Sprouts were sensational with huge flavor. The flavors of these 3 dishes also complemented each other extremely well, making this a fantastic trio to order together. The Duck Cotechino Sausage, Paccheri & Roasted Squash were still nice, but paled in comparison. Though less intensely flavorful, these 3 dishes also complemented each other well & would be a good trio.\n\nAfter polishing off so many big little plates of food, we still found room for a piece of Chocolate Nemesis Cake. OK, it's true. The name alone was a significant factor in my wanting this dessert. Though it had an abundance of deep, rich chocolate & a substantial cookie-like crust, this chocolate cake wasn't overly intimidating in any particular way. So, despite the name, the Chocolate Nemesis Cake was easily vanquished. Scrumptiously & gratifyingly, but easily.\n\nBarbacco is an interesting & somewhat quirky new take on Italian dining. Some things are a real big hit. Some things come closer to a miss. Either way, Barbacco is far from boring. What really makes Barbacco worth trying (& trying again) is that even some of the things that are more of a miss are still pretty good.", "author": "John M."}

Not just because it's a block from work, but I love everything else about this place too.  Everything except the tight seating arrangements, if you are a party of 4 or less, and you don't want to sit at the counter, and its during lunch hour, you are more than likely going to have to share an already small table with another party. I wouldn't recommend this place for large parties either. Party of 6 max. \n\nOn the bright side... The ambiance is great! It's hip enough for a casual meal, a work lunch, and even a casual date. I wouldn't call it romantic. If you want romantic or a white table cloth setting, go next door to their sister restaurant Perbacco. \n\nTheir menu is pretty delicious. Granted I always get the same thing, I've tried many other dishes ordered by others. I'll only mention the ones I really like and dislike to make this review shorter. \n\nTheir bruschette - the only one I didn't really like was the anchovy one. All the rest are pretty darn good. My all time favorite that I always order is the chicken liver pate, served with some sauce and grilled onions on top. Yum!\n\nTheir salads - I've tried the the tuna salad. I did NOT like it. Something extremely acidic about it that just didn't sit right with me.\n\nTheir pastas - I've had the lasagna, the orecchiette, and the pork ragu. All good but the Pork Ragu, my all time favorite. Get it every time. \n\nFinally, saved the best for last, the Brussels Sprouts. This place turned me onto Brussels Sprouts. I used to never touch them, now I crave them. I've even tried many times to duplicate the recipe at home, which I've come close, but not close enough to satisfy my craving.\n\nThey have a pretty substantial wine menu as well. They did away with the iPad wine menu at every table. Maybe too many were getting stolen/broken?\n\nAll in all, I could probably safely say I go to Barbacco once every month or so. Service is fast, they've definitely mastered the serve-the-full-meal-in-under-a-hour thing.\n\nLast thought.

Believe me, these lunch dates are effective in restoring our sanity. The restaurant of our pick this time is Barbacco.\n\nSo, let me get this out of the way. Barbacco uses an iPad as a drink menu instead of the traditional printed menu on paper.  Each table gets one iPad. Very 21st century and very cool. After looking at it like kid who found an interesting toy and pushing the \"buttons,\" I abandoned it.  Call me old-fashioned but I was at lunch, don't want to be hooked up to cyber and just want some good old fashioned meal with my friend. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=5s7kiomhQfe0x2qzw4abzw\n\nSOCIAL SCENE: Having said all of the above, Barbacco's exterior is almost non-descript. It looked like an ordinary but neat storefront. Inside is contemporary loft with brick walls. The lunch hour was patronized by the \"cool and beautiful\" or those hoping they looked the part.\n\nDECOR/AMBIANCE: The loft decor starts with high ceiling at the reception area then drops to a low modern white plastic ceiling at the dining area. I wish they kept the high-ceilings since the place was tight, packed and loud! The noise level was so high that at one point I was listening to people screaming to be heard! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=fmltN_xSMyqlKGM7tlV4qg\n\nSERVICE: Despite the well-heeled lunch crowd and image of the place, the service was friendly and unpretentious.\n\nAPPETIZERS: Heather and I started off with samplings of Italian small plates: \n1. Quick-braised squid in tomato, chili and pan grattato (breadcrumbs) $8:  The squid was fresh but this dish was just okay and nothing really stood out flavor-wise. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=XrsixfKw4rYS7kKbOkqEgA\n\n2. Grilled Sardine Bruschette $3 or 3 for $8:  I love sardines and I could have eaten half a dozen of these.  Once again the sardines were obviously fresh. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=X0S_o1pQL79CLdjkkuHKZw\n\nSALAD: We ordered an Heirloom Tomato Salad with cucumber, red onion, basil and olive crostini in red wine vinaigrette. We ordered the bigger serving for $9. This dish was so simple yet so fresh and so delicious! The tomatoes were sweet. Heather and I could not believe that they were only charging $9 for this hefty bowl of organic heirloom tomatoes when one good-sized heirloom tomato already cost at least $5 at the farmer's market! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=zXOsph3gHUq8YdNOqrwReQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=Llmq-offuLJWfXp1nyHVKA\n\nSANDWICH: For our main entree, Heather and I shared a Caponata Sandwich  ($9) which was made with grilled eggplant, agrodolce (Italian sweet and sour sauce), almonds, currants and rucola (arugula).  This also came with a simple green salad. This dish was sweet yet savory at the same time. It's like eating salad in a bread. So delicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5ho0_FKk9n7uV8pSCYIg?select=omi3Oj9zt4exWCkMDpDWJw\n\nHeather and I shared everything. In the end we were comfortably full, feeling guilty-free and proud of ourselves for indulging yet eating healthy. We are starting to discover that it is indeed possible to be a foodie and watch your diet.\n\nTab: $40 ($20 per gal including one non-alc drink, tax and 20% tip.)\n\nBarbacco is a winner! Good service, good food, sophisticated ambiance and affordable prices.", "author": "Leah E."}

I'd probably go back again at some point if i'm ever in San Fran again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.\n\nSee the issue here for me is that it is labeled Italian but you will not find your traditional Italian fare.  They have meatballs on the menu but no pasta and meat balls option.  They have lasagna but it's spinach noodles.  It just doesn't seem right to me...\n\nI ordered the lasagna which cam out pretty quick.  I was there around 5 and sat at the bar...  The bread appetizer was good with the oil and vinegar, the lasagna was just ok.  When I spoke with my wife later that evening I compared it to something from the freezer chest at your favorite grocery store.\n\nThis part is not really a strike but an observation I found odd...  From the time I sat down to the time I left I had 6 people assist me.  From seating me, taking my food order, drink order, checking on me, check, etc...  I usually tip based on service of the wait staff, this made it difficult to gauge the tip amount.

I'm a pescatarian, and was a little alarmed when they showed up with spicy sausage sprinkled on top and in the sauce underneath.  I'm ok with meat broths, so I was OK with just picking around it and getting to the mussels & potatoes.  It was nice and spicy, a little too greasy, but I'd recommend it if you're into that sorta thing.\n\nWe also had the petrale sole fish, which was decent for the setting.\n\nIf you're looking for a really nice sit down meal at a genuine setting, you won't find it here.

I'm a fan\".\n\nPrior to dishing on the food -- I have to mention that the hostess and the sommelier are completely lovely -- majorly high marks for fitting in our party of 6 when I called for a reservation on a Saturday night...two hours before we wanted to show  up.\n\nEach of us ordered 3ish things and there was plenty of food to go around -- highlights included the arancini (short rib filled fried crack), broccoli rabe orrichette (sp?), farrotto, and the chicken thighs.  Squid was mediocre, apple salad was crunchy to the point of unwieldiness (yes, I went for all sorts of scrabble craziness on that one), and the focaccia was cold.  Most things just needed salt -- and while I don't think that I gorged myself, I left feeling kind of greasy...?\n\nI should also note that it has so much secret meat!  The brussels are fried in duck fat (which is  awesome, just not for the PETA crew), etc etc , leaving a few salads, a pasta, a risotto,  brushchetta, and well, okay, it sounds like a lot, but there are about 230948 meat things for every one veg, so if that's you're thing, then Barbacco probs isn't where I would send you.\n\nWe were a crew in the golden years of our twenties and were the youngest by a few years, that said, the service was still lovely and it was a great way to spend a few hours.\n\nDin for 6 with two bottles of wine was $235 pre tip -- I should note that the wine list is really reasonable, and playing with the iPad wine list is amazing.

Here's a note I just emailed to them: \n\nHi Barbacco team,\n\nI moved to the Bay Area a year ago, and since then have been to Barbacco a number of times. Eating out in general is stressful for me because I have Celiac Disease and as such am highly sensitive to gluten. The servers at Barbacco have always been helpful when I bring this up (and in general, I'm incredibly impressed with the service at Barbacco - Barbacco staff seems to be very excited about the food and wine and gives great recommendations). I've never gotten sick after dining at Barbacco, and always enjoy my food. \n\nToday I ate lunch at Barbacco and was blown away. Before I even said anything to Jason, who was helping me, he (somehow??) already knew that I was gluten free. He offered to have the chef start boiling a pot of water in the off-chance that I might like a gluten free pasta dish. I didn't even know you did that! The fact that I didn't even have to say anything and that you all know enough about gluten intolerances that you boil a separate pot of water was above and beyond. \n\nOne of the most difficult parts about having a sever gluten sensitivity is trying to navigate meals at restaurants that don't have a dedicated gluten free kitchen. It's rare that I can have a meal where I'm not overly anxious about being \"glutened\" and actually enjoy my meal. I know that you can't ever guarantee that there is no cross-contamination, but I wanted to thank you for being proactive and making me feel safe and happy about the food I'm eating. It's often tiresome to have to pull a server aside and explain the ins-and-outs of my diet and gluten and see if I can be accommodated. To just sit down, order, and eat is such a treat. And seriously, give Jason a high five or something, because he made my day. He even when and got me the box for the pasta so I could look at the ingredients. \n\nAlso, the pasta was delicious. I asked for no cheese because I'm somewhat lactose intolerant, and didn't have to ask twice. That just makes me feel even better about your staff's ability to communicate to the kitchen - something that is really integral to my health and the health of people with diet-related illness! \n\nI don't expect restaurants to cater to my food intolerances, but it's incredible when I'm actually able to eat out. I'm also always embarrassed when I have to be high maintenance and ask a million questions, and you made me feel like a \"normal\" customer today. Thank you.", "author": "Michelle V."}

Maybe they should have a sign somewhere to advertise they are out there.\n\n---ATMOSPHERE---\n2 Stars\nInteresting place. The front of the place have a beautiful open ceiling area. Then when you go to the back, the ceiling goes down and makes the place feel small and cramped. The back of the wall had a mirror to try to make the place feel better, but it just looks weird. I loved the idea of lights on the floors. \n\nYou don't get your own table. You have to squeeze in and have to sit next to another party. That would be odd for me. I would want at least a couple inches away from someone else. I think they got so busy it would be smarter to push the tables together and hope to get people out quicker.\n\nI had a HUGE feeling that thing place use to be a dinner maybe. A huge place to sit down and have you coffee and the table area use to be booths. The brick wall behind should be exposed to give the place a nice look to the place. Like a classic open light Italian restaurant, not a covered up dark cold place. \n\nBIG downside of the crapped area is it can get loud. The waiter barely heard our orders and my boyfriend could barely hear me and he was RIGHT next to me!\n\n---WAITING---\n4 Stars\nI would highly suggest a reservation.

Not super delicious. It seems like something I would have on a salad not on a piece of bread.\n\n- Tuscan chicken liver pate / onion marmellate\nDELICIOUS. I have never had chicken liver so it was a new experience for me. With the onion is amplified the flavor of the liver. I would love to have this again.\n\n- Roasted mushrooms / artichoke crema.\nIt was kinda messy for me. I would have diced the mushrooms a little smaller. I took one bite and all the mushrooms feel off. The sauce on the bottom was good but I couldn't tell you if it tasted good with the mushrooms since they ended up on my plate. When I was able to get one mushroom with the sauce, they kinda blended to well that it was kinda bland.\n\nORCCHIETTE\n$12\nI was good. IT was little pasta 'pillows' drenched in olive oil with spinach really. At the bottom of the bowl was a little lake of green stained oil. Barely any fennel sausage.

Barbacco was an amazing place to satisfy that craving. I was leaving the Bay for grad school, and my best friend and I came here for our \"Last Supper.\" We were sat at the bar, which was actually really nice, although the chairs didn't seem terribly stable (mind you, we're not large people). It took us a while to decide on what to order, but I ended up choosing the Burrata on arugula and crostini, with black olive, roast tomato, and garlic confit spreads. I love these fresh cheeses, and the burrata did not disappoint. My best friend had the corn rigatoni and from the bite I had, it was very flavorful and fresh.

I asked to use the restroom. When I got back and was lingering by the door, evidently giving off crazy person vibes, the hostess kind of barked at me, \"HELLO! CAN I HELP YOU?\" I told her I was waiting for someone. She had me check in for us but didn't seat me. Helpful! Also not representative of the service, which was overall very nice.\n\nOther party arrived; we were seated at the bar. The bartender was insanely polite and attentive. One of the loveliest servers I've ever encountered. Go, you! We ordered drinks using the iPad they presented to us. The only actual use I saw out of the iPad presentation was you could sort your wine by grape/vintage/what have you at the click of a button. I ordered beer.\n\nThe food menu was printed on actual paper (I know, right?). For dinner, we got the jar with mushrooms and mascarpone. Truffle something or other was involved. The jars are \"make your own bruschetta\". It was cute, and tasty. My entree was the orecchiette with fennel sausage and broccoli rabe, which I will be dreaming about for weeks to come. Incredible, perfect, wonderful pasta dish. \n\nMy date got the lasagna. Oh, the lasagna. We each take a few bites of our respective dishes. He tries mine and admits that it's more delicious than his lasagna, which is still good. Then he spots something shiny in his dish. He fishes it out. It's... a big ol' piece of saran wrap, warming itself between blankets of pasta and a meat sauce. How sweet. \n\nNot wanting to be jerks or anything but acknowledging that this is the kind of thing you should send your food back over, we sent it back. Profuse apologies were issued by both the bartender and a snazzily dressed gentleman who seemed to be a manager? Sommelier? Something. \n\nA few minutes passed, my orecchiette was shared, and the second piece of lasanga arrived. A few bites were eaten, and then, there it was again, gleaming in the light. Another piece of saran wrap, easily twice as big as the first.\n\nThe lasanga was ditched for a farro risotto with mushrooms, quite good but not as amazing as my orecchiette. The failed lasanga(s) and risotto were comped, and we were served complimentary ice cream.\n\nI would be happy to eat here again, but you gotta wonder about that saran wrap.

I had kept it a surprise from her the whole day and just before we left, she guessed the restaurant based of the address. Needless to say, she was very excited as she loves Italian food and heard good things about Barbacco.\n\nWe left our apartment in a cab at 615PM, and at 625PM while in the cab, I received a call from an employee at the restaurant informing me that she is canceling our reservation due to some type of flooding in the restaurant. It's not clear if that was a result of the rain the day before or if it was a plumbing issue. She said that they had fixed it in the morning, served people for lunch, and then something happened again. She said that they started serving dinner and since something happened again, they decided to no longer take patrons. This implies some folks were already eating dinner, and we missed the \"cutoff\". I also asked if we could get a reservation at the sister restaurant, Perbacco, and she couldn't help there either. I was very frustrated at this given that we made reservations a week ago and I ended up getting the cancellation 5 minutes prior to our dinner, when we were already in a cab on the way over.\n\n5 minutes notice after I've already hopped in a cab is pretty frustrating, as I ended up sinking money into the cab. We then had to find another quality restaurant (we couldn't use OpenTable since our reservation at 630 was still active and couldn't be canceled), that could seat us. The first opening we could find was 8PM, at which point we had to cab there. We were starving. All of this, because Barbacco decided to give us really no heads up or support in accommodating the inconvenience.\n\nI'm sure the food is delicious  and service is excellent, but I'm disappointed in how this cancellation was handled.

The lights are low; the tone: comfortable, and permissive... not unlike having an open door policy at a dear friend or relative's house who happens to be a kick-ass chef.  \n\nYes, I am am an ethical omnivore and a jubilant carnivore - traits my beloved Cadet inherited.  However, on this most recent foray, I asked between the two venues which he preferred -  his emphatic response:  \"Barbacco - they have the BEST brussel sprouts!  Can I get an order for here and one to take home?\"\n\nContorni are vegetable platters \"side dishes\" to the rest of us - and not so common in the traditional format of Italian fare, but here, one can order tremendous portions for $4 a serving that beg to be shared by two or three.    \n\nUnless you want the World's Sexiest Fried Brussel Sprouts Fried in Duck Fat and finished with capers, anchovy and a perfectly acidic snap of red wine vinaigrette.  That'll be $5 for a giant heap.  \n\nEvery time I order them, I am transported to my 34th birthday, when I was stranded and falling-down starving, alone.  After a last-minute business meeting that lasted for HOURS, I surely would have passed out if I'd taken one more step.  Barbacco existed only in the minds of Umberto and Staffan, and I literally stumbled into Perbacco, dehydrated and faint.  It was PACKED to the gills, as a private event had overtaken the entire upper level.  \n\nI almost wept.  I told the Hostess I needed to eat a dinner - a big one - and that I'd be sitting at the bar, which is first come, first served.  Somehow, my dilemma was discreetly relayed to Umberto, who welcomed me back and gave his oath: he would certainly find a place for me.  Maybe it was wishful thinking, part hallucination, or the totally appropriate reassurance that only a Born and Fed Italian Man can convey - I [choose to] recall that his hand rested on my mid-back for just a beat.\n\nHe made a second round, maybe 15 minutes later, and *whispered in my ear*  \"There ees a spot that I weel make, just fora' you, bella... Don' worry - eet weel be just a moment, please.\"  The lapel of his impeccable cashmere suit grazed against my shoulder and I thought:  I can die now.  My life is complete; what more is there to experience?\n\nThat, Childrens, is how Barbacco elevates humble food to the level of La Perla lingerie.  There is nothing pretentious about their offerings, but it's gorgeous food that a passionate lover would make for you before taking you to the bedroom.  It's all love, sensuality and wisdom that will make your eyes roll back into your head: deliciousness, ecstasy, revelation, laughter, incredulity, pleasure, exploration, sincerity... again and again and again. \n\nAnd again...!\n\n*cough*cough*  \n\nI TOTALLY digress!!!\n\nWe ordered:\n\n* Cucumber limonata for me\n* Minted limonata followed by cucumber version for Cadet\n* Pork rillette w/ mostarda di frutta in vasetto\n* roasted mushrooms trifolati w/ herbs & truffled marscapone in vasetto\n* cured sarde bruschetta w/ radish, fennel & salsa verde\n* 2x duck liver pate bruschette garnished w/ galsamic onion marmellata\n* crushed cannellini beans & radicchio bruschetta\n* roasted butternut squash bruschetta with crushed hazelnuts and comegranate condimento\n* house cured lard bruschetta w/ rosemary & frisee\n* piave vecchio w/ mosto cotto\n* humbolt fog w/ red wine poached dry cherries\n* toma trifulera w/ Christmas bush honey\n* brescianella w/ mostarda di frutta\n* 2 orders of the incomparable Baby-Making Brussel Sprouts\n* 2 orders of watermelon radishes dressed in olive oil, salt and herbs\n\nAll told, this abbondanza was a mere $82 before tip; the significant leftovers will be Cadet's lunch (or breakfast) and a snacks for me, easily.  \n\nSpecial thanks to our server, KEVIN & \"Young Man\"  who were consummate hosts - carrying on the fine tradition and exemplary standards set forth by Umberto and Staffan.\n\nChow here; belli - your belly will thank you.\n\nPane intended.  ; D\n\nGrazzie mille!", "author": "Kim D."}

It just adds a really lengthy ordering and selection process, the app's UI/UX is horrible - slow, buttons take several pushes to get them to work, getting back to the menu once you add something to your cart isn't obvious and you can't just see all the wines at once, they're divided into categories (and let's be honest, not everyone knows their wines so for one of my party members it was really difficult for her to figure out what was what). But the worst part of it is, you have this really fancy, digital wine menu....and you HAND the iPad to the waiter to complete your transaction. Basically, they glance at your cart and then go walk over to the register and put in your order manually. Now, tell me, how exactly is that efficient? As someone who works in tech, you'd think that it could be a cart check out that sends it to the bar computer register or another iPad the bartender has handy to fulfill and then your waiter comes over with your drinks right away. Or, you can ping a flag on the app, saying you have a question about wines and your waiter can come over with samplings and walk you through their selections. But the fact that you guys went through this whole song and dance to make a cool, nifty menu that doesn't have a digital checkout/order process is just a waste of my time and your money. \n\nThey also forgot most of the requests that one person in my party made, which had her a bit frustrated. \n\nI'll come back because the food is great, but if you're going to go high-tech and modern in your restaurant service just make sure it's a completely seamless and impeccable experience.", "author": "Alita M."}

We were in Oregon last week where they mock our SF affectation of serving toast and when it comes to this restaurant rendition, Oregonians have a point. We also had brussels sprouts previously crisply resplendent, deep-fried in duck oil with just a touch of counter-acting balsamic, now fried in canola oil (another SF PC move? / PETA on the move?) & sodden with too much vinegar. The polenta previously crisp on the outside and pillow soft on the inside was granular with way, way too much rosemary. Finally, the artichoke soup although visually appealing tasted soapy.", "author": "Phillip L."}

As a big fan of Perbacco, I was hoping that the experience would be just as good and indeed it was.  The space is long and narrow, with the bar taking up one half of the room.  The decor and vibe remind me a lot of the restaurants in NYC.  The crowd was diverse - young and old, couples, groups, locals and out of towners.  Most of the seats are left open for walk-ins - seating at the bar or seating at one of their communal tables.  Service was attentive and our waiter did a great job of helping us figure out not only what to order but also the appropriate number of dishes to order.  The food is also available for take out.  If only I lived/worked nearby!  \n\nNow onto the food.  The arancini were rich and creamy on the inside, crispy on the outside.  One of my favorites.  The chef's selection salumi platter was ok (I enjoyed the selection at Perbacco and Beretta more).  The farm eggs,  recommended by our waiter, was so good!  The eggs were on the runny side and went perfectly with the 'nduja and greens.  Absolute comfort food.  We had a trio of brushette - duck liver pate (my favorite!) with balsamic vinegar and onion jam, cannellini beans  and house cured sardines.  Definitely worth a try.  The polpette were light, fluffy and full of flavor and I love a good meatball.  The braised pork ribs were tender and fell right off the bone.  Lastly, the spring peas were farm fresh and cooked just right - not a mushy pea in sight.  Yes, this sounds like a lot of food, but the dishes are small and meant to be shared.  \n\nI love that wine can be ordered by the half glass (3 oz) which makes it easier to sample a variety of choices from their wine list.  \n\nSeven dishes + 3 half glasses of wine + 2 cappuccinos = $90 for two people (I was mildy hungry, he was starving).  A definite bargain given the quality and quantity of the food.  Why not five stars?  I'm not a fan of the big tv screens at the bar unless I'm dining at a pub or sports bar and and we wished they had paced the dishes out a wee bit better, as the food came out in two waves.  Minor annoyances.  As for the food and overall service, I have no complaints.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Melissa L."}

I will jump to the juicy part by saying that the main courses were the clincher for me! I had the swiss chard, ricotta pasta topped with the sage browned butter. HOLY MOTHER! You know how every once in a while (like once every couple of years)...you take a bit of something so good, it leaves you speechless? Well, this takes the cake! The pasta was so fresh and the sage butter coated my mouth like the heavens. \n\nMy partner in crime opted for the polenta and mushrooms, which was also amazingly tasty.

I came here for an early dinner and welcomed the opportunity to order various small plates.  I liked the fact that there are quite a few menu offerings that can be ordered in different portion sizes depending on one's mood.  For example, the bruschetta can come as a single, or as a plate of three and the fried olives can come in a small or a large serving.  Barbacco also offers three ounce pours of wines allowing for more opportunity to pair the perfect wine with each dish. \n \nThe food was both a hit and a miss with me.  The arancini, because of the amount of tomato sauce used in it, is like Spanish rice rolled into a ball with cheese and then fried.   It was okay, but I have had better.  The polpette (meatballs) were underwhelming.  Even though they came in a tomato sauce on a bed of braised chard, I didn't find the meatball itself had enough flavor and it was not as moist as I expected.  The best dish of the evening was the day's special, fried anchovies caught that very morning.  They were tender and delicate, not at all fishy or greasy.   The other highlight was the nduja , a salami paste which is then spread on grilled crostini.   The creamy texture and the spiciness made for an interesting dish.\n\nService was very attentive.  My only complaint is the noise level in the restaurant.  It got so loud that it was hard to carry on a conversation and my ears were practically ringing by the time we left.

Especially the mushroom croquettes and butternut squash bruschetta.  But there were a couple of odd quirks about the overall experience that lost a star.  \n\nFirst, the ipad wine & beer list. This could be awesome, but the way Barbacco is using it is just awkward.  They've essentially spent $400+ on what can be accomplished with a .15 cent pamphlet.  I'm not hating for the sake of it; I think the ipad menu could be really cool if you could place your drink order directly to the bar tender with it, or basically do anything with it besides merely browse their wines and beers...you know, like you do with a menu.  Especially since after fiddling with the ipad for about 15 minutes, the waiter asked me if I was really sure about my order, and proceeded to repeat what I just read about it. It was a very man vs. machine moment, the ipad and the waiter competing to prove their utility.  Meanwhile, all I wanted was a glass of sauvignon blanc.  The experience was really confusing.  \n\nSecond, I give the restaurant kudos for efficient space utilization.  There's long rows of booths, a bar, and then another bar for seating in front of the restaurant.  If the mini-bar in the front of the restaurant faced the street, it would be really cool to watch pedestrians.  But it faces the lobby, and it feels just like you're sitting in the lobby, which gets awkward as you watch other patrons get turned away. Not the most romantic setting.  If you're making reservations, I recommend specifically asking not to be sat at the table by the front door. \n\nI don't think I've ever used the word \"awkward\" so much in a review before, but it captures my Barbacco dining experience.

I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, but this was so good on the toasted hard bread bites that came with it.  We asked for more bread too.\nAntipasto of seasonal vegetables - pretty good, nothing amazing\nRoasted beets with goat cheese, fennel, etc - also pretty good, I'm a fan of both beets and goat cheese, so I liked this dish.\nSuppli - mushroom risotto croquettes filled with truffled mozzarella - also very very yummy!!\nLasagna Bolognese - pretty good, standard lasagna\nOrecchiette - this was good, but after we got chili flakes for the top of it, it got a LOT better, felt like it was missing something and the chili flakes filled that gap\nMussels - also pretty good\nFlat iron steak with asparagus - I really liked this dish a lot, the steak was tender and the asparagus was cooked well and was flavorful.\n\nBUT.. my FAVORITE of the night (oddly enough) - Brussels sprouts fried in duck fat.. oh wow.  I still think about this dish and it's already been a week.  I want more.  Please someone bring me more brussel sprouts fried in duck fat... please!\n\nOf course.. there was always room for dessert.  We all shared the bittersweet chocolate, butter scotch-chocolate crunch gelatos and tutti frutti sorbet (the last two were the best).\n\nThe chocolate nemesis cake is a must for anyone who loves chocolate dessert, it paired well with the gelato and sorbet.\n\nThe espresso panna cotta was disappointing, too thick and not really like panna cotta as much as it was like pudding/jello.\n\nOverall it was a great night, with good food, wine and company!", "author": "Victoria Y."}

I really liked sitting at the counter facing the chefs and prep cooks.\n\nNot really jazzed about the IPad menu.  Would rather have a conversation with our waiter about the list and the specials.  Meat plate was average and underwhelming for the money.  Fried Olives with Pork sounded promising but tasted like nothing but fried blah.  Meatballs - specialty of the house.  Raisins, pine nuts, and pork.  No meat, no veal, non va bene.  I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to meatballs.  I want meat in them or tell me they are Lamb or Pork or whatever.  I get that this is the Neapolitan style but a little warning would be cool.\n\nWill stay with Perbacco if down in the area.  Did I mention our waiter was great?", "author": "Doreen D."}

It was tasteful with a little kick of spice. For both of the appetitizer we try to share, the ndjua was the best. \n\nWe then went to the entree selection, the menu was a bit hard to read, beacuse it was in Italian. I dont blame that I cant understand or read what it says until the waiter came by and explained to us what was what, which was very helpful.\n\nThe waiter recommended the Lentil Stew and she had the Farrotto. The Lentil stew was basically similar to a rissotto but indeed a healthy dish on the Pasta part of the menu. Her Farrotto was a mushroom risotto, she didnt seem to like it, but I had a taste of it and it basically just tasted like a mushroom risotto and nothing special. \n\nAnother perk to the restaurant was that they were have drinks/wine menus off of ipad that the waiter would bring to your table to pick. It would only be better if the menu was too, because I kept scrolling on there and couldnt find the menu till the waiter came in and says oh no the menu is on the side which was a long 5 inches paper.", "author": "Linh D."}

Our waiter was attentive without being annoying, gave really good explanations of food/drink items, and was very friendly.\n\nFirst we ordered drinks. My bf had a craft beer and I ordered this super girly fruity wine concoction. I'm blanking on the name, but it was white wine, pureed strawberries, and lime and it was absolutely delicious. I could have had 10 more!\n\nWe only had 3 food items between me and my boyfriend, but all three were absolutely delicious. We ordered the Nduja, which is the spreadable house-made salami. It sounds (and looks) a little weird! But you cannot leave this restaurant without getting it. It is SO yum! The perfect amount salty and spicy... We also ordered a few cheeses to go with it- one was a gorgonzola, one was a sharp asiago, and one I think one more. Then we shared the spinach lasagna which was great also. Very filling, so perfect to share after some apps.\n\nIf we head back to San Fran, we'll definitely visit here again.", "author": "Melinda M."}

Two of us were early, but, much to our surprise, we were unable to hang out at the bar. Every seat at the bar has a full place setting. Awkward. But no worries, they seated us early. Cool. \n\nAbout halfway through our meal, they seated strangers AT OUR TABLE. Some people love communal dining. Not me. And it was really weird because it wasn't a big giant table where you'd expect communal dining. This was a six-top and we were a foursome. So it was just weird to me. Invasive. \n\nThe appetizers were great. We had the chickory bruschetta and the sardine bruschetta. The entree was a pasta dish with pork. I kid you not: two cups of pasta, one tablespoon of pork. Basically no sauce or flavor. Huge disappointment. The brussels sprouts were perfection. Lastly, we had butterscotch gelato and biscotti, which was wonderful. The service was attentive enough, but there were several mistakes. And if you serve entrees in a bowl, and there are shared side dishes, let us have side plates! \n\nSo, would I go back?

I enjoyed my food (shared lasagna, meat balls, large salad, and croquettes) and service was ok.\n\nThe lasagna was a very good lasagna.  The meat balls were great but was a little surprised that they were a tad spicy (fine by me but not what I was expecting).  THe salad was underwhelming.  The croquettes were really good but not as good as the waiter or other people made them out to be.\n\nThe one thing I really dislike about this place are the mirrors in the back.  I think it is so ghetto and tacky when a restaurant installs mirrors at the end just to make it seem like the restaurant is twice as big as it actually is.  Just own the fact that you are a small restaurant in the financial district.\n\nAlso (ok maybe I lied and there are two things I dislike) the ipads.  You know, they are a great and fun idea for customers.  Unfortunately, these are like HELLA old, they must be first gen, so they are all thick.  Also, they definitely look worn and used.  I understand obviously that they are used but if you're gonna try and make yourself look nicer by having a fancy hi-tech gadget, you can't let it go out of date or let it look all worn out.  Yes, I realize this is expensive but that's why you probably shouldn't go there in the first place.\n\nAs far as the service, it was ok.  Not amazing but certainly not bad.  It was a little unnerving that when someone in my party asked one of the employees what a particular dish was, we were unable to understand what he was saying.

The ambiance was very nice and the food was truly superb.  My colleague had the Arugula and Radicchio salad along with the Lasagne Bolognese.  He's a regular here and swears by it; the presentation was very nice.  I started with the Heart of Romaine Salad and my lunch entree was the \"Peposo\" (tuscan beef stew braised with creamy polenta).  Yes the lunch was great and the food alone is worth 5 stars.  So where is the miss?  Barbacco is definitely an upscale trattoria.  There are plenty of small hole in the wall restaurants and dives with superb food out there too (but they are missing the ambiance and service and are priced accordingly).  And on a place like that I would have only reviewed the food.  But when I go to any upscale place, I look for more than just the food.  It's about the total experience (and the meals in upscale places are priced to reflect that total experience).  That experience is comprised of 1. the meal itself, 2. the atmosphere/ambiance of the restaurant, and 3. the service.\n\nThe miss for me was the service.  This was my first time in this place and we did have reservations.  As soon as gave them our name, they walked us to the counter.  We asked if we could instead be seated at a table; the host seamed very bothered by this request but walked us to a table.  The server came by to take our order.  We both ordered an Arnold Palmer and our meals.  Drinks came out promptly and shortly followed with our meals.  However my drink ran dry early during my meal and I definitely needed another drink (or a glass of water).  I kept looking for our server but never saw him during our meal.  We didn't see our server again until the end of our meal when he asked us if we wanted desert; then quietly dropped off our check at the table.  I expect our server to stop by at least once during the meal to check on us (make sure everything was ok), and to also occasionally glance at the table to see if anything needs attention, such as empty glasses.  I understand lunchtime is busy, but this lack of attention to your guests is a total turn off for me.\n\nAlthough I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch (it definitely was great), as a first timer in this place, I was turned off by the service (or lack there of).  If they would have had the service element down, this would have been 5 starts instead of 4.  It's unlikely I'll come back as there are too many great options in a city like San Francisco.  And although the food is great and the place is packed, these things catch up with restaurants once the word gets out.\n\nAgain:\nFood = 5 stars\nAmbiance = 5 stars\nService = 2 stars\n----------------\nOverall Average = 4 stars\n----------------", "author": "Nick K."}

There is no relationship here with the people who serve you. It is not bad or rude, just disconnected. I rate it a 15% tip class- did the job, but nothing memorable. 2. Cutlery management - sounds strange, but it was a problem here. You get one set for the whole meal, so you have to manage it. But how? They don't give side plates or little stands to hold your dirty cutlery between courses, so you have to plop it on the place mat. Yuk. Even during some courses it's hard to manage because the pasta comes in bowls and so there is nowhere to lay the cutlery except on the side where it points to the ceiling, slips off and eventually drops again on that place mat. That's the same place mat the last people ate at and the next will. They may not even be aware of this problem but come on guys, a simple side plate would do a lot.

The place, while not tiny, is so packed-to-the-rafters full of people that is has the spaciousness of an airport lounge for a delayed, overbooked flight. \n\nI personally can't stand communal seating. It's one of those fake \"trends\" restaurants created to flexibly pack in more people then they should. And Barbacco takes this to its zenith; the counter seating--used egregiously for walk-ins and reservations alike--is half the restaurant and ridiculously cramped. (They don't even have hooks for bags under the counter--lame.) To continue the airplane analogy: imagine having a $50 dinner in the middle seat in coach.\n\nSo, when I was seated--with a reservation--in the back of the restaurant at the counter, I was visibly and vocally unhappy. The hostess said, politely, that nothing else was available and I begrudgingly said I'd make the best of it.\n\nSo why four stars? (Well, really 3.5, but I'll round up instead of down here.) Service and food.\n\nAfter I told our server that I wasn't pleased with the counter arrangement--of course it wasn't her fault, but she could tell I wasn't happy--one of the managers came over and asked me about it. I was really impressed by how each member of the staff was genuinely concerned with wanting me to enjoy my experience. He bought me a glass of wine (after we found something on the ridiculously gimmicky iPad-based wine list) and said we could have the next available two top table. Well done.\n\nOur server was also super attentive and nice. In fact, it was really just striking how these two people really CARED, even though they were terribly busy. Truly a model of how to treat customers well.\n\nAs for the food, there were a couple so-so items (fried olives stuffed with pork), but most others were really quite good. The olive oil poached tuna could have been a meal itself; delicious and well seasoned. The pasta in sugo was rich, hearty, and flavorful. The pork sugo was earthy and perfectly cooked. Desserts were also enjoyable.\n\nSo would I go back to Barbacco... yes, probably. But until they perhaps \"remove a few seats in coach,\" you won't be finding me at the counter.

It actually made us MORE indecisive about our wine because there was an overload of information for each one. And frankly, I like talking to the sommelier or server about what we're in the mood for that night.\n\nThe food is DAMN good.

As locals, they gave me about five different options and we settled on this one. What a good decision. \n\nFirst, they find a way to pack in everyone despite the space being quite small which makes for a cozy atmosphere. In fact, it appears to be quite common for there to be multiple cross conversations which end up going on, and I am all for this. Second is the extremely creative method of having iPads at every table which display the drink menu. This has to be a west coast/San Francisco thing, but it is pure genius, at least until the back button stops working for me! \n\nI started with the soup of the day which had lentils, chicken and who knows what other deliciousness in it. I followed this up by getting the Orrecchiete pasta, which much like the starter proved to be another excellent dish. The mix of the spicy fennel sausage combined with broccoli rabe and the sauce (I think it was pesto, but I could be wrong) hit the spot dead on. When you combine it all with a glass of red wine, it is impossible to go wrong. To close out the evening I ended with the lemon olive oil cake/strawberries which much like the previous choices left me a very content person.\n\nGreat place, good service although it is a tad on the pricey side. My only complaint is that one of my friends ordered two of the \"jars,\" but ended up only receiving one, and that the portions are perhaps a tad on the small side. However, these are minor issues and I'm definitely a fan of Barbacco!", "author": "Hikaru N."}

They each had their own unique taste so I'm going to have to recommend all of them while trusting that the other two that we didn't try to be just as good. \nFor entree, we had the Chitarra since we had to try their famous meatballs. I'm going to say this dish was good all around! Great meatballs, great pasta, and just the right amount of flavor! The pasta was definitely handmade with quality you can taste. \nLastly, we also tried their fried brussel sprouts. In my opinion, it was good, but too salty for my asian tastebuds. I had to eat it between the pasta or else I would've had to down some water between every 2 or so. This was the only dish we (2 people) did not finish. Some of them probably fried a little too long resulting in pitch black parts. \n\nService was mediocre.

The brussels sprouts that everybody else is raving about disappointed me--they were too salty and overly charred. You should probably share them with somebody else, because they come in a large portion (in fact, it turned out to be the largest plate we ordered, despite being a side) and the taste eventually becomes too overpowering.\n\nI loved the polpette, meatballs served on a bed of chard, but $13 for three meatballs? Yeesh. The squid with 'nduja was similarly delicious, but they were buried under arugula, which ultimately composed most of that plate. I also enjoyed our cheese, Humboldt Fog with wine-poached cherries. I was fine with the amount of cheese they gave us, but couldn't we have gotten more than three cherries? They were tiny! It seems like three is a recurring theme at Barbacco.\n\nI really wish I could like Barbacco. The interior is hip and lovely (the iPad drink menus are a fun if useless novelty).

Owing to the \"Eno\" part, you'll find a decent selection of wines (as well as some draft and bottled beers) here, but the only two cocktails on the menu both contain prosecco - you can have a Bellini or the bubbly with a splash of blackberry liqueur. In addition, Barbacco closes at 10 p.m.\n\nBut don't let that prevent you from dining here or enjoying a post-work glass of wine. The narrow space is furnished with a long, black marble bar, exposed brick walls leather stools and plenty of stainless steel, giving it a fun, casually elegant feel that attracts attorneys and hipsters alike ... and, inevitably, the oblivious few. At the bar to my left, a boisterous gentleman, who claims high rank at a nearby financial-advising firm, ostentatiously declared to his co-worker that he had much better Barolos in his cellar, while to my right a pair of pretty girls didn't know what peperonata was.\n\nOnce my wine arrived, courtesy of the cheery, courteous bartender, I was able to tune both sides out and savor what was before me. I fell in love with the light-amber 2008 Donati Il Mio Malvasia after one sip, its fruit and tannin surprisingly direct for a sparkling wine, yet not unpleasantly so. It is perhaps the perfect bubbly for the season and was a great start to the rest of my autumnal meal. \n\nThe wine truly amplified the rich woodsiness of my starter of minced mushrooms cooked trifolati-style in olive oil with garlic and parsley and layered in a tiny jar with truffled mascarpone. The baguette cro\u00fbtes with which it came were incredibly crunchy, so avoid ordering this on a date, unless your companion relishes the sound of a lion chomping on a freshly caught gazelle.\n\nSomething softer and sexier to eat: perfectly al dente orecchiette, whose mini-bowl shapes captured a mildly spicy sauce laced with tomato and tossed with slow-cooked lamb and braised Swiss chard. The chunks of lamb were sparse, but for $12 it was a massive bowl of pasta and managed to be a warming, delicious dish.\n\nI absolutely adore bass and thus proceeded to order the night's branzino special. A few bites into the crispy-skinned filets, set atop a luscious cauliflower puree and adorned with golden raisins and bits of charred cauliflower and Romanesco broccoli, I silently lamented that I couldn't get a plate anywhere like this in Honolulu, my current place of residence. Most of the food there is either incredibly salty or flavorless, and adulterated with Asian and Polynesian flavors; I cannot stand it anymore. The streets of San Francisco will one day permanently become the pavement I pound.\n\nPensive chewing through an almond-anise biscotti, dunked into espresso, eased my nerves. My last dinner in the city was largely successful, and as I stepped out into the chilly night, I was very glad to have places like Boulevard, the Four Seasons and Barbacco to remind me that my days of living in the land of bland and Panda Express are waning.", "author": "Tadd T."}

If he was just as good looking as Perbacco was, I had to know him. It became a mission of mine to meet this person I've become so interested in. I started hanging out with Barbacco during lunch and then have dinner with Perbacco after work. I kept all of  our lunch rendezvous from Perbacco because I felt he didn't need to know. After all, it is only an innocent lunch. Or two. \n\nThere is no question in my mind how I feel about Perbacco. Whenever we're together we have the most amazing time. It's grown to be a comfortable, natural relationship and I love him. I can introduce him to all my friends and he is always so accepting and warm. They think the food he cooked at our last dinner party was unbelievable and they said it was some of the best Italian food they've eaten in a while. They tell me I'm the luckiest girl on the planet to have him and deep down I truly feel that we're meant to be together, but something about Barbacco intrigues me in such a way that makes me want to learn more and more about him. \n\nI stare at Perbacco sometimes and watch him get ready for work. He is always so handsome and put together. I never have to tell him to wear this or wear that because he looks good in everything. He is so composed under pressure and has this ability to make anyone feel special, especially me. Barbacco is different, but in a good way. There's no doubt they're brothers. They may have grown up together but they've walked through their adult lives on different paths. Barbacco's gentle swag is what I find attractive. He knows he's sexy but carries himself in a humble sort of way. And I like that. \n\nPerbacco recently found out I've been having, as he says, \"One too many lunch dates,\" with his brother. It bothers him and he thinks there's something going on between us. I assured him there isn't and that Barbacco's nothing more than a new friend and a person I respect as his brother. \n\nThings are finally good now between Perbacco and I but I have to be honest with myself and admit that there are feelings for Barbacco that I will always have.

I knew this was more informal so I was curious to see how it compared. Admittedly the iPad wine list in front of you definitely raises the cool/hip factor. The flow of the dishes that come to you can be a little off -- something I think they should work on. \n\nIf you're not a fan of close dining quarters, then this is not the place for you. My friend and I were seated at the bar area, which I didn't mind really, although you will have a stiff neck by the end of the night after having to turn to one side to have a conversation the whole night. Other tables that were away from the bar were packed as well.\n\nThat said ... on to the food. I had the summer squash bruschette, which was pretty good, although it felt like it could have used some more seasoning. The taste was a little light. \n\nI couldn't tell you what the watermelon salad tasted like that I ordered, because the waiter forgot to bring it. So ... I'm dinging them a star for messing that up. (At least it didn't show up on our bill.)\n\nMy mushroom risotto was quite tasty. I was also impressed with the portion size -- it was much bigger than I would have expected. Enough for a full dinner portion the next night!\n\nWe got an order of the brussels sprouts that everyone raves about but they had too much of a balsamic taste to them. It overpowered the overall flavor. A similar dish at Park Tavern does brussels sprouts much better. \n\nI ended the meal with the chocolate nemesis cake. It was divine!\n\nOverall, a great experience with just a few tweaks that can easily be done.", "author": "Lori M."}

I had the peas with goat cheese variety and while good, definitely needed some salt and pepper to add some flava. Everyone in my group seemed a little meh about them. The portion sizes are perfect for lunch in my opinion, not too small or big. I ordered the asparagus pasta and it was very tasty.

I'm so glad I took her advice, because Barbacco is dynamite!\n\nWhat first stood out to me about this place was the ubiquitous iPads on every table, containing only the restaurant's wine list. We can argue either way whether this is really necessary or an overindulgence, but I'm sure it's bound to be the way of the future for San Francisco dining. The drawback of having an iPad on every table, of course, was in noticing that there was a hostess whose sole job, it seemed, was to stop people from stealing the iPads and walking right out the door. I felt bad for her.\n\nBarbacco does a great variety of simple, well-executed Italian food at very reasonable prices ($10-18 per entree).

And It was lunch time and we decided to eat around there because we already had our car parked and didn't want to go far where we would have to take the car out and then look for parking in the city, which can be insane. So we decide to walk around, my friend was craving pasta so we decide to look for Italian resturant. And we came a cross this place because they had a menu outside and we saw that they had pasta so we decide to go in. And it looked really nice and fancy and they had a really nice seating and the bar looked great it was really nicely decorated resturant very morden kind of a place. So the waiter takes us to the table and hands us the menu and gives us a minute to look at it and we are trying to figure out what we want then he comes back and says you need to order fast of this menu but then he says if you are going to take longer then you order from this menu which made no sense because the same things were on that menu that he gave us. So we said ok we will look at this one and then he comes back minute later and says are you ready to order. We ask him for advice on what to get and it felt as if he was in a hurry to take our order so he can go back to whatever he was doing because it was not busy at all there was only one other table that was being used and there was nobody at the bar so i don't know why he was in a hurry. So we ordered orrecbitt I think that's how you spell it and we also got anchovy brueatta which we thought it would be couple bread with tomato and anchovy and he comes up with on tiny bread which cost 13 dollars and had anchovy Sauce with olives on top and it was hard to eat. And the pasta that we got had a really bad after taste the only thing good that we had there was the lemonade. It was the worst mistake we made going there I wish we never went in there because we only took two bites of the food and paid 27 dollars for two bites. And our waiter provided the worst service ever because, I feel that he should have the food knowledge and try to help us figure out what we would like instead he was jus in a hurry to take our order and leave. The restaurant and name of the items are very fancy I just hoped that the service would be that fancy too. I would never go there again not even on accident.

Barbacco seemed like a good place for something that wasn't going to be through the roof expensive, and the reviews seemed to be reasonable.  The 7x7 must-eat list for 2012 had just been released, so I was determined to try the salumi plates (the 7x7 list says to try it at Perbacco, but really...is there THAT big of a difference?).  We tried the smaller Chef's selection of salumi platter, and it was absolutely delicious!  For the mains, I had the flat iron steak tagliata / grilled treviso and it was great!  The grilled treviso, in my opinion, was better than the steak.  My boyfriend got the Orecchiette, and I think he thought it was decent (but nothing to really write home about).  For dessert, I had a cappuccino, but we passed on the sweets.  We sat around a finished the bottle of wine we ordered via the iPad at the beginning of dinner and headed on over to our next event afterwards.  I wasn't thrilled that we got seated at the bar and would have preferred a table, but it wasn't going to be something I was going to make a big deal over.  The food was good, service was good, and the overall ambiance was fun too.

Had intended to go to its big-brother (sister?) restaurant next door - Perbacco, but our eye was drawn to Barbacco's menu posted outside - not to mention the hip little iPad-driven wine menus that have been well documented elsewhere and need nary a mention from me.  Other than to say (you knew I couldn't resist, didn't you?) that the guy who invented these Smart Cellar devices was one smart feller.  I expect we'll all see many more such things on an increasingly regular basis.\n\nBut back to Barbacco.  I held little hope of getting a seat, as the people in line just in front of us turned and walked away.  But we took the seats at the bar that had not been to their liking, and enjoyed the engaging and knowledgeable wait staff, whose name I forget, but whom we knew from her days at the Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant.  She was a font of knowledge on their wines and even poured us scant tastes to make sure we wanted the wine we'd settled on - in short, the very sort of person which we love to have as a wait staff.\n\nThe wines were pricey, but very nicely selected and recommended.  The list, despite the impressive technology behind its presentation, is not that long, and could easily have been presented in print form.  But I would have missed the ability to search, sort, and drill down that the Smart Cellar provided, and hey, they're just fun and engaging!  I almost bumped this rating up to five stars just because this tool earns an additional star - This rating is really a 4.5-star rating (just use your imagination).\n\nThe Food\nInteresting, creative and well executed!  The fried Brussels Sprouts are so good we brought them home (in their fully recyclable brown cardboard container) and they were the inspiration for this already long posting.  If you're tired of my writing (in which case you likely stopped reading long ago), blame the sprouts from Brussels.\n\nThe hits were the Bruschetta ($3 per one-slice serving) - we chose three out of a list of 7 or 8, the pea and mint (yes!), the mushrooms (oh yeah), and the duck liver (meh).  We also found the lasagna to be among the best we've tried - not heavy, but rich and satisfying. \n\nOur bill was $100 before tip, with $45-$50 of that being wine.", "author": "Dave C."}

Offering a relaxed, but sophisticated atmosphere, Barbacco features delicious dishes and wonderful wines from all over Italy.\n\nThe menu is arranged in a way that helps diners navigate the wide variety - more than 50 selections - of large and small plates.  Divided into sections, such as piccolino (small nibbles), salumi fatto a mani (housemade cured meats), latte stagionato (cheese), inizio (appetizers), and others, the extensive listing invites diners to taste little bites from all over Italy as they walk through their meal.\n\nThe melt-in-your-mouth arancini (fried risotto balls coated with breadcrumbs) are the perfect way to ease in to a meal.  Rich and flavorful, the rotolo (rolled pasta filled with chard and ricotta with sage-brown butter) was almost too filling.  Saut\u00e9ed to slight crispness, the Brussels sprouts were the perfect foil to the creaminess of the polenta.  However, accompanied by rucola (arugula) and parmigiano reggiano, the carpaccio lacked intensity of flavor.\n\nService is top-notch:  the servers were attentive and knowledgeable about both the food and myriad selections of wine.  They were easily able to recommend selections from the more than 100 wines - most offered by the 3 ounce taste, 6 ounce glass, quarto (1/4 bottle), mezzo (1/2 bottle), or full bottle - that perfectly complemented the food.\n\nWith excellent food, a great wine selection, detail-oriented and personal servers, Barbacco is off to a good start.", "author": "CJ G."}

The initial impression is that they are trying just a bit too much to accomplish something modern, casual, and city-esque. The 6-top bar height tables are seated to max out (party of 2 and party of 4 together) and the seats are quite uncomfortable. I suggest grabbing a \"bar\" seat or a regular table near the back. \n\nThis is a BEER & WINE only establishment. The bev menu is presented on an iPad, with limited details and a less then stellar presentation. To be proud of your wine list would suggest giving additional details when there is no limit to menu length - yet they don't. The servers feed you wine details, though I don't think they actually know what they are talking about. Use your own best judgement. \n\nThe service itself is quite good. Friendly, young folks. The salumi plate is a good starter if you're in a group. I've had the mushroom risotto, lamb/mint/pea pasta, and the halibut special.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-12", "description": "I've been here more than a handful of times so I confidently will vouch for this joint - the more casual, and MUCH more affordable (surprisingly affordable, maybe even cheap for what the establishment looks like, actually - A+) younger sibling of its' fine-dining, pricier older sister, Perbacco, which is just a few doors down. While not a completely rock solid four stars, Barbacco has proven itself to be, at the very least, a sometimes wavering, but mostly a legit four star contemporary Italian establishment. Good for a comfortable first date in the city, a catch-up with a friend, or just an after work bite.\n\nThe restaurant encompasses a modern/trendy feel with a somewhat communal atmosphere, what with the long tables, a long bar set-up with seats, and the majority of their plates being conducive to a shared, family-style experience. \n\nRecommended:\n- Fried brussel sprouts: A MUST! An addicting plate of crispy, deliciously sweet and savory red wine vinaigrette doused brussel sprouts. Perfect for sharing. \n- Bruschetta: They had a decent variety. Truffled lardo (shaved fat, basically . . . mm, fat, delicious), duck liver pate, pear and gorgonzola are all especially delicious.\n- Mushroom risotto: half shelled, which I don't come across very often, but is flavored perfectly and tastes earthier than your usual risotto because of the chewy shells \n- Lasagna: cheesy, meaty, layered with house made spinach pasta. Delicious and recommended for lasagna fans.\n- Orecchiette: \"little ears\" that come with fennel sausage, a hearty portion of sauteed kale mixed into it and delicious Italian cheeses. One of my favorites, when made right (which unfortunately it hasn't been sometimes)\n- Gelato: Butterscotch crunch - tasty and not overwhelmingly sweet at all\n- Espresso panna cotta: Both dense and surprisingly light. Delicious.  \n\nA notable quirk they possess here are the iPad drink menus at every table. Only . . .  they're SO incredibly inefficient and unnecessary. They fail more than they display the drink options, and they don't even allow you to order from them. (Maybe expand it's purpose, Barbacco? Have pictures of the specials, food, desserts, etc).  Also, the paper menu is incredibly unorganized. They clear up what certain Italian food categories (piccoline: small starter snacks, dal grano: pasta based dishes, etc) mean on the BACK . . . why?! I'm sure the wait staff has experienced the result of this poor printing choice more than enough by having to explain what could easily have been figured out on our own if it weren't for the poor menu organization. \n\nAnyway, aside from those few minor gripes, the food has been mostly consistently delicious, innovative, and while not every item on the menu hits it out of the park, nothing I've tried has ever not hit at least slightly above average. Combine that factor with the super reasonable prices, and I'm yours. \n\nMy newest reliable go-to joint in the FiDi, hands down. :)", "author": "Betty W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-11", "description": "It's shocking how some folks can Yelp a restaurant before it even opens to the public... wish I had those kind of hookups!  Came here at the beginning of the lunch service on the opening day.  Was impressed by the level of detail put into every single dish in terms of ingredient complexity and letting the customer know about most of those ingredients on the menu.  The vibe is power-lunch-lite -- great food priced above take out, but not an expense account buster.\n\nCrushed Cannelini Beans Bruschette: Smooth and subdued except for a mild kick from fresh onions, this bruschette is a good contrast when paired with more potent ones.  \n\nDuck Liver Pate Bruschette: First bite was accidentally only the pate which had that overpowering liver taste.  Subsequent bites included the onions in balsamic vinegar which worked perfectly to complement the pate.  A must for folks that get bored by charcuterie with only mustard and cornichons. \n\nWhipped Salt Cod Bruschette: Like a little salt cod patty with a chapeau of pillowy mashed potatoes.  I'm normally hesitant to get salt cod because it can taste so fishy, but this is apparently made in house and tastes a lot fresher (for salt cod).\n\nButternut Squash Passato  Soup: Probably the most disappointing item I tasted.  Too salty and watery.  Perhaps even too much butter.  I was hoping for a richer butternut squash experience.\n\nZuppa di Pesce: The small size is much smaller than the small butternut squash soup.  Lots of great herbs floating about this thin tomato broth.  Only appeared to be fish filet and no shellfish treats.  Really like the concept of being served with a crostini which had a very thick aioli sauce spread on... classier garlic bread!\n\nSlow Roasted Shoulder Porchetta Sandwich: Finally I can stop harping about how no one does porchetta better than the humble Roli Roti.  This was more tender and more flavorful by far!  Apparently they bring in a whole pig for all their pork dishes.  They could have been more liberal with the crunchy skin segments from their personal pig though.  The chewy roll was a good vehicle for absorbing all the juice (i.e. grease).  The grape topping was nice, but I could have been happy with just the meat!  The pickled veggies (carrots, celery, cauliflower, peppers) on the side tasted like pure white vinegar... keep them marinating a bit longer please.\n\nPolpette: It's nice to have over sized meatballs that crumble apart with a fork instead of insisting on a knife.  If you can slow braise meatballs, they must have done so!  The pine nuts were a good surprise inside the ball.  The greens (chard?) was sadly boring.  The tomato chunks had a fresh texture, but could have used more spice.  \n\nVanilla-Huckleberry Gelato: Second worst thing I tried on the menu.  Allegedly vanilla gelato with huckleberry jam.  The huckleberries were so dry I swear they were huckleraisins.  The vanilla gelato base was dense instead of smooth and creamy.\n\nLimonata: Not from the can or bottle, just another word for fresh lemonade.  Perfect for my taste -- sour enough to make you appreciate as an adult, but not so sour it makes you whince.", "author": "Adam B."}

That was the perfect solution, as the wines were our primary focus for the evening. The food, if good, would only heighten the experience. But it turned out that both food and wine were equal partners in the evening's successes--and excesses.\n\nWith five or so offerings in each section (salumi, cheeses, bruschette, pastas, secondi, and sides) it was hard to make a decision. Fortunately, visiting NPA wine expert Hardy offered up his recommendations and suggested wine pairings.\n\nThe sausage-stuffed deep-fried olives and the nduja partnered perfectly with our Pinot Gris, as promised. At the risk of offending the Boccalone gods, I think I preferred this version of the spreadable salami. Maybe it was the perfectly charred, olive-oil brushed crostini that accompanied it, but the spread here seemed more meatily mellow yet flavorful, with a hint of a peppery kick.\n\nThe orecchiette with fennel sausage and the suddenly ubiquitous cavolo nero kale was even better than my more traditional sausage and broccoli rabe favorite. The little pasta ears were filled with a pesto-like rendition of the kale that was very hard to stop eating. This paired well with the NPA red blend (too many varietals to remember), as did my braised chicken thighs with almonds and castelvetrano olives and my date's lamb stew. \n\nJust as Hardy had said, the saltiness of the fried Brussels sprouts with capers and anchovies was tamed by the Pinot Gris.\n\nI may have found a favorite Italian trattoria at last! Portions and food were better than at SPQR. And even though we stuffed ourselves last night (including the flourless chocolate cake to go--don't judge), I can't wait to return to try the rest of the menu. \n\nYou have to love a place that serves NPA wines and has special NPA wine nights--and that has a dessert called chocolate nemesis.

Both refreshing and not too sweet.  We had wine - chose several glasses and each was good.\n\nWe made special requests for the entrees for the kids and they were more than accommodating. The gluten free corn pasta was perfect - \"toothy\" without being underdone or overdone. Smokey bacon, ricotta and spinach created a sublime, ever changing flavor on your tongue. I'm having leftovers for breakfast!\n\nThe swordfish pasta was perfectly executed - swordfish cooked perfectly, complimented by a sauce that was a little spicy and paired perfectly with the fish.\n\nThe staff bent over backwards to be sure we were taken care of. From the hostess to the server to the staff setting the tables, every one made sure we had everything we needed.

I am glad we had made a reservation because it was totally packed even at 7:30 which I feel is a little later than most people in downtown would be eating (people go home early; this ain't Manhattan).  \n\nThe menu is really hard to read ... I will blame this on a combination of the font, the spacing, the fact that they chose to eschew capitalization, and the fact that like 90% of the words are in Italian.  I ended up getting the beef & we also ordered a focaccia appetizer and the nemesis chocolate cake.  \n\nService was attentive perhaps in large part due to the fact that we sat at the bar.  Atmosphere was super crowded and loud -- it's not that any one party was particularly rowdy, but they pack people in here like a can of sardines.  \n\nI enjoyed the food (in particular the focaccia and the nemesis cake) and good service, but have to detract 2 stars for the atmosphere / how hard it was to have a conversation despite sitting literally inches away from my dining companion.  Very dimly lit as well -- I would be wary to bring my parents here because they have trouble reading in the dark.\n\nThe number of good, 2-dollar-sign sit-down dinner places in FiDi is pretty limited, but I'll probably branch out and try somewhere else next time I get an evening meal in the area.

So, in order to be fair, I want to state up front that on the merits of my meal Barbacco deserves four stars.\n\nThe wine list is pretty brief, but seems well curated. I had a lovely glass of dolcetto that stood up to all of my menu selections well.  One of my friends had an outstanding Sangiovese that also worked well with everything and was nice on its own. On our side of the table, we started things off with some nduja (spicy spreadable salami) and a roasted mushroom spread that consisted of chopped mushrooms layered with truffled marscapone. Both starters came in little pots with crostini. Both were rich, satisfying and delicious. I would order either again in a heartbeat. The crostini to spread ratio was a bit off, but the kitchen happily supplied more. On the other side of the table, they opted to try the suppli (risotto cakes stuffed with truffled mozarella) and crostone with burrata and roasted beets. I only had a morsel of each, but both of them were solid choices. For a main, I had the farrotto (farro cooked risotto style) with roasted mushrooms and chesse. It had a wonderful balance of flavors and was particularly soothing for a rainy evening. The potion seemed never ending and I opted to take half of it home. It made a terrific lunch the next day. One of my friends had the flat iron steak (it was on the rare side, which I personally love) and another had the braised chicken thighs. They both seemed really happy with their options. I thought the steak and its accompanying mushrooms were yummy. But something went off kilter when it came to the paccheti (pork ragu). There wasn't much pork in evidence and my friend didn't like the pasta they chose for the dish or the red sauce. I didn't actually try it, but it did seem kind of lackluster. Things got back on track with dessert. The espresso panna cotta had a textbook-perfect texture (so creamy!) and a nice flavor. \n\nThe service was excellent and I really liked the atmosphere. One thing to note, having the wine list on an ipad seemed kind of silly. The list isn't nearly long enough to remotely justify it.", "author": "Nicole M."}

I would not have done it independently and they were so.freaking.good.  Wow.  It is amazing what a little duck fat and red wine vinegar will do for these much-maligned spouts.\n\nOther dishes at Barbacco were similarly impressive.  My personal favorites were the cannellini bean bruschetta and the spiced pear cake.  To die for.  My husband was practically licking the bowl after finishing his bean minestra-- he loved it.  We also enjoyed the paccheri pasta with pork ragu, the gorgonzola pear bruschetta (a little heavy on the gorgonzola, but perfect when half of the cheese was removed) and the braised chicken thighs served on polenta.  I really like the small plates concept here.  The portions aren't so small as to be ridiculous, like so many other places that experiment with Tapas, and it allowed us to try many more offerings.  Two of us split eight dishes, total, and I had a glass of wine.  Total at the end of the evening, with tip, was $80.  Not bad for such a variety of food, and really good food at that.\n\nService was good.  We had a reservation, and had to wait maybe 5 minutes when we arrived because the restaurant was packed even at an early hour.  No biggie.  We were shown to a spot at the counter.  It's a little awkward to have to turn around to talk to your server and a little squishy in the restaurant in general, but again, not a biggie.

I wouldn't say Perbacco has the best food, but there are some real gems there.\n\nBarbacco is a bit like an Italian tapas place.  The bar seating area that reminds me a bit of a sushi bar.

The Ipad is completely app free, and instead contains a limited cocktail menu with a selection of wine, specialty drinks, and beer.  The specialty drinks features a selection of three bellini.  Technically, bellini is wine.  I look around and notice that they do not have a full liquor license.  Perhaps, remove this option from the menu?\n\nI would recommend unlocking the Ipad and allowing customers to surf the web or check email, in case they are waiting for someone or on a really awkward date.

I'm new to the Bay Area and although I work in the financial district, I don't know all the best places to eat. So, duh, I turned to Yelp to help me figure it out! \n\nWhat Yelpers said was that it was reasonably priced, has good food, and it was close to wear we were randomly standing on Market Street (my out-of-towner wearing a dress and thin cardigan was freezing to death, so close proximinty food was needed). \n\nAnd you Yelpers were right! A ten minute walk and my friend I were there. The atmosphere is rustic and warm and it's a cool technological touch with being able to read a menu and order from an iPad. Not sure if it's necessary but it's kind of a fun feature. \n\nThe food was pretty delicious. I don't remember how to say what I ate but it was a penne-like pasta cooked well with a light olive oil, garlic-y dressing over it with tomatoes and cheese. Very light, but filling. My friend had a pork pasta dish which was also hard to pronounce, but was pretty tasty too (or as Fergie would say T-A-S-T-E-Y). Had good pork flavor, but not too overwhelming. My favorite part though was the addition of free sparkling and/or flat water. I do love me some non-alcoholic bubbly. \n\nService was prompt, nice, and really got the dinner moving at a good pace that seemed efficient, which was perfect since we were in a bit of a rush. The guy next to us was too and he got out pretty quick. \n\nNot a complaint for me, but I can see a gripe being having to sit close to strangers on the bench and bar seating they have. I liked it, but I can see how some people might not be a fan. \n\nA gripe of my own though, and really it's a pet peeve so take this with a grain of salt, but my promised wait time wasn't really held true. We were told 25 minutes, but it ended up being more like 35. Not a huge deal, an extra ten minutes, but it made us feel just that more rushed to get out since we had to be at SFO to pick up another friend. But the hostess was very plesant, so that made the wait not seem so bad.\n\nAll in all, not a bad experience. Dinner was probably about 30 bucks for the two of us, sans drinks or appetizers (because we're both poor recent college grads). .", "author": "Patrick W."}

I had been told by many people you have to have the brussel sprouts, so why not a whole lunch.  \n\nWe started with the celery root salad.  The celery root was tender while the celery and apple were crispy.  There was the right amount of gorgonzola and toasted walnuts.  I followed that with a faro risotto.  There was the creaminess of the risotto while still having the heartiness of the faro.  Delish.  \n\nThe brussel sprouts are worth having.  They are fried in duck fat and topped with capers, anchovies and a red wine vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette cuts the fat and gives them a little kick.  I did end up with a big bite of anchovy which was not so nice, but I doubt that happens often.\n\nI could not pass us torrone gelato to finish the meal and I was not disappointed.", "author": "Megan P."}

The bad......we had reservations at 8pm, but the place was so packed we had to wait almost 30 minutes. The food & service was excellent though and totally made our wait worth it. While we waited they quickly brought drinks out to us. When finally seated, they brought a couple complimentary appetizers (olives & cherry tomatoes) and a nice surprise at the end, they comped out desserts too. We choose to order a few meals and share family style. Enjoyed the beef stew, steak & lasagna all delicious and well prepared, some of the best flavors I've had in Italian dishes. The Brussels sprouts and the meatballs were our first course and were absolutely amazing! The pine nuts in the meatballs gave a unique texture, which we all that was fantastic. The desserts were excellent, we had 3 different ones, one was s cake with gigs (YUM), roasted strawberry gelato and a panna cota. Overall a fantastic meal with exceptional service and care.

Yes, please.\n\nAlso - solid risotto with farro.  I know farro risotto is the \"in\" thing now, but for 11 bucks, and a huge bowl of it, I'm not complaining\n\nAnd - good mozzarella & asparagus starter, and fried brussel sprouts.  Mmm.\n\nGood, solid service.  Cheery, yet not overly-friendly.\n\nMisses:\n\nSide of polenta.  Ugh - if you like clumpy, watery, bland polenta, then you'd like it.  Not my thing.\n\nBruschetta - they were cool, but the duck liver was really minerally for my taste.  I prefer a bit more creaminess.  The chickpea one was bland.  I just thought I'd skip them next time.\n\nAtmosphere if you're NOT in the financial world: basically, we felt like we were the poorest people there on a Friday after work. I think if you were into \"downtown\" though, it's right up your alley.\n\n\nAll in all, I thought it was solid food for good prices.  They have wines for $10/glass which is nice BUT it's listed on ipads.  I'm old-school, and it honestly takes me more time to scroll through menus and back again, then to open a piece of paper and look at all the wines at once.

Definitely.\n\n- Ambiance -\nA fancy casual establishment with a modern lounge feel.  The iPad wine list is a bit of a useless novelty.  It seemed like most tables in the place were six-seaters, so if you're in a party of 2, 3, or 4, plan on having neighbors sharing the table with you.  Also, the angle of the table (30 or 35 degrees) means that the person sitting on the acute side next to the wall is going to have fun repeatedly banging their left elbow.\n\n- Food - \nEveryone at my table complained of saltiness in their pastas except for me.  I thought my Lasagna was very well prepared, though a bit small.  For appetizers, go with the chef's salumi selection.  The duck liver bruchette was also a winner.  The brussels sprouts are flavorful, delightfully seared, and prepared with much less butter and/or oil than seems to be en vogue these days... a plus in my book.\n\n- Beverages -\nI realize that there are only so many liquor licenses to be given out in San Francisco, but I was surprised that a place like this did not have a full bar.  Barbacco is definitely going for the lounge vibe, and with your beverage choices limited to wine and beer, it seems that they're missing a key element.  The bar/counter space is so vast and devoid of bottles, it looks like they're just waiting for a license to come through.  There were four of us, and we ordered the sangria pitcher.  The rest of my party enjoyed it well enough -- I found it to be hugely lacking.  It didn't taste like $6-per-glass/$36-per-pitcher sangria.  Little to no genuine fruit flavor.  I felt like I was drinking wine mixed with Koolaid.  Their wine list *is* extensive, and I wish we'd spent more time looking at that than being lured by the sangria.\n\n- Value -\nOur price per person, before gratuity and including drinks, came to $48.  We're a hungry lot, and ordered more than most folks might, as we were being adventurous with the menu.  Everyone left satisfied, if not quite impressed.  Still, you can get a perfectly decent fancy lounge meal there for less, just don't expect a hearty portion.\n\n- Service -\nOur waiter seemed a bit clueless.  He repeatedly tried to take our plates away at each course when we clearly weren't finished.  I guess he was attentive, though he continued to refill our sangria glasses from the pitcher after we'd asked him not to.  Perhaps he just didn't hear us.\n\nTo sum it up:  Quite good, though not great.  Hence only three stars.  Avoid the sangria.  Eat the brussels sprouts, they're good for you.", "author": "Walter P."}

The menu of small snacks and portions is far too tempting to order any less. \n\nThe ascalone (fried olives stuffed with pork) are a non-negotiable, especially for a salt lover such as myself. Crispy, with a slightly vinegary bite, these are treats to behold. Small order is plenty for two. \n\n'ndjua is a spicy, spreadable salami that has salt, smokiness and spice. The texture is meaty and thick. Also a must try. \n\nHave tried a couple of the bruschettes and I could take or, more likely, leave these. Nothing has impressed. They used to have one made with baccala, which was a bit fishy and not that great an addition. Also, the bread portion of the bruschette is filling, so you should consider this when ordering.\n\nAs for pasta- order the 1/2 portion for 2, lest you get overwhelmed. The paccheri (pork ragu and parmigiano reggiano) is a winner. It is indeed rustic, pasta perfectly al dente, pork tender and parmigiano sharp. \n\nThe brussels sprouts (fried with a red wine reduction) are delectable and balance the saltiness of the other courses. \n\nWine list on an iPad, which is cool.

The iPad wine list thing was cool but not really more helpful than a printed wine list. I guess it made it a little more fun to order wine.\n\nWe ordered the fried olives stuffed with pork, which were fucking AWESOME! I love fried olives, and stuff olives, and I'd had fried olives stuffed with cheese but never with pork. This was amazing, I highly recommend it. I also recommend the focaccia, because it's only $1 and it's pretty much perfect. It's a little crunchy but not annoyingly so on the outside, soft on the inside, and they brush it with olive oil. So good!\n\nAlso got 3 types of bruschette - duck liver pate/balsamic onion marmalade and two other types I can't remember. All three were delicious, and I like that they offered some pretty creative takes on bruschetta.\n\nRounding out the order were meatballs and fried brussel sprouts.

Prices are reasonable, I dare to say that are quite good given the quality of the food. I sat at the bar for a quick lunch and I could see the restaurant getting packed in less than 15 minutes. By 12 pm there was no room left and people were waiting to get a table.

There re several menu items nodding to the southernmost part of Italy and my Mom's birthplace, Calabria, that included 'nduja, a spicy sausage inspired by the French andouille.  Try the calamari stuffed with 'nduja for a sassy version of surf and turf.  Babacco's Paccheri dish - large pasta tubes dressed with a tender pork shoulder ragu - is one of the best dishes I've had in a long while, even considering all my trips back to the homeland.  \n\nThe lunch menu prices are reasonable, especially given the food quality.  I've spent $10- 12 for a salad made by the many gourmet, organic to-go restaurants south of Market, and for the same price or maybe a couple dollars more I can get a hot, soul-comforting dish that will satisfy me through the early evening.  If you don't have time to sit down for lunch, Barbacco offers a great take-out menu.  Me?  I'm heading back for the Paccheri...", "author": "Allegra C."}

It's close to work, pretty swank, nice staff and the menu has things that sound enticing.\n\nHowever, I have been here three times now, and each time the dish I had was incredibly, unnecessarily, off-puttingly, adverse-adverbially fatty. And, as my Freshman year English teacher (who moonlighted as a romance novelist) taught me, THREE TREES MAKE A ROW. This is a Barbacco motif. And it's kinda nast.\n\nIt might be because butter was a verboten item in my Dipsea running A-type (jew fro donning) father's house, but this little rant is coming from someone who secretly enjoys the fact that food vendors put in too much butter, cheese, oil, what have you.\n\n\nAnd despite my being a fan of food items entitled \"Butter-Brezel,\" the 3 dishes I've had at Barbacco just scream compensatory. As in,\"we are unsure about the flavors standing on their own, so let's douse these shrimps in mayo, and call it aoli!\" Or, \"no one will like our brussel sprouts unless they're in a puddle of oil!\"\n\nIn other words, this is a case of Epicurean Inadequacy. And like Sue Sylvester, there's nothing I dislike more than inadequacy.\nEspecially when it's in my mouth.\n\n\nThat's what she said. (oh!)\n\n\nIn all earnestness, for a place with the point of purchase fixings of fine midday dining, I am disappointed. Quit trying to make me like you with fat, Barbacco.  It's cheap and unbecoming.

Can I buy one off you? \n\nWell, like other people mentioned already, that's the first thing I noticed - the iPad drink menu but a paper food menu? Anyway, I came prepared and knew exactly what I wanted when I sat down at my shared counter height table. \n\nI ordered meat, meat, meat and meat. Not even intentionally but it just popped out. Salumi platter, duck liver pate, meatballs and pork sandwich. Wow. Call me a meatatarian. Our server was really fabulous and attentive and of course said we ordered all the good stuff. Our glasses were always full too. \n\nOn to the meat: first dish was the duck liver pate - phenomenal. The bread underneath was okay - a little hard, but oh I probably could have licked the plate.  Second dish - Salumi platter.  Eh.  I don't think I'll be eating it for a really long time.  Whatever made me think I would like a whole salumi platter when I don't even like a salami sandwich?  Who knows.  I would not get it again.  \n\nMain dishes - meatballs - three large meatballs on top of veggies and stuffed with delicious raisins inside.  Yum.  Slow-roasted pork shoulder porchetta sandwich - well definitely not what I expected.  I thought it was good but it was all pork belly fat.  Just call it a pork belly sandwich please.  I felt really fat after eating it.  A tip - if you get the pork sandwich, eat it before other things.  The meatball was so flavorful that I couldn't taste the sandwich after I had the meatball.  \n\nFinally, the best part - dessert.  I had to ask the friendly waiter what torrone was because if I were smart I would have known.  Pistachio gelato and orange zest.  Wow.  I love pistachio gelato for some reason and this one was really good.  Perfect flavor with actual pistachio nuts crushed around it.  The perfect bite - pistachio and once it's done, you taste the orange - just a hint, not too much.

I think they outsourced their bar staff to purchase all the iPads.\n\nThe food is great as usual but they need to figure out how to integrate iPads into the dining experience.

After reading the good Yelp reviews, a friend and I decided to make a reservation at Barbacco for her birthday dinner.\n\nThe service at first was very attentive, but it became somewhat oppressive after we ordered.  People tried to bus our plates, with significant amounts of food on them, basically every 3-5 minutes.  The hostesses would stare at our table, talk with our waiter while staring at our table, and then he would just happen to pop over (in between the bussing attempts) to try to clear our plates or ask if we had plans later.  \n\nThe food (which is great) might have outweighed all of the bad service if it were not my friend's birthday.  When we first arrived, we mentioned her birthday to our waiter and he very graciously offered us each a free glass of wine.  But by the end of the night, we were left feeling fairly offended by all of the not-so-subtle interruptions, instead of enjoying her birthday dinner.  \n\nTwo final notes: first, I waitressed for years, at different types of restaurants with different clientele - I understand that it's natural to want to turn over as many tables as possible, both for the restaurant and the staff.  But it's also important for people to leave a restaurant wanting to come back/recommend it to their friends.   Second, I generally only leave a Yelp review for a restaurant  when they have done such an amazing job that I feel compelled to share their awesomeness with the world.

Until I set foot in Barbacco.  \n\nAfter a disastrous haircut (Thanks, Ringolevio!) I wasn't in the best of mood and was considering heading home and trying to figure out a Plan B as it relates to the haircut.  The only thing that stopped me from going was a dinner date with a globetrottin-girl friend with whom I have not been spending quality time with.  \n\nAt her suggestion, we went to Barbacco.  I love the wine selection and I have to admit (grudgingly) that while I find the whole iPad thing quite tacky, it allows the sorting and searching of my favorite wines.  I settled for a crisp pinot gris and my girl friend, a sweet riesling. \n\nWe were seated at the bar (good: we get to chat with our lovely server.  bad: a lack of personal space) and after mulling over the chilled wine for a short while, we started perusing the menu. \n\nIt sure was an array of tongue twister.  We relied on our server's recommendation and were shortly presented with an array of food:\n1) Bruchette with ricotta, basil, caramelized onion and tomatoes:  \n2) Paccheri  parmigiano reggiano  - rustic pork ragu and parmesan cheese\n3) Farrotto / farro risotto with mushroom\n4) Patate in padella (literal translation: potato casseroles) - pan roasted fingerling potatoes with nduja (spicy Calabrese sausage) bits and caramelized onion\n5) fennel-rubbed pork ribs with shaved fennel salad and roasted lemon\n\nI certainly appreciated the smaller serving - it allowed us to sample different kinds of dishes.  \n\nVerdict: I would come back and order the exact same dishes (finally! Potatoes that can give Los Gatos Cafe's breakfast potatoes the run for their money!), with the exception of the pork ribs which were a tad salty.

We shared the salumi platter, which was excellent. I liked the breadsticks and pickled veggies that came with the meat. Next, I had the oricchette and he had the pork ragu pasta. I loved my pasta, which was plentiful and cooked just right with greens, a bit of sausage and lots of olive oil and pecorino on top. His pasta was a little hard and not that special - just a red sauce with shredded pork. He admitted that it was disappointing. To finish, we shared an affogato, which isn't on the menu but the staff accommodated our request. A little pricey, but I think the quality is there.

My favorite dish was the Milanese which is a breaded pork cutlet with caper and lemon butter served with arugula salad with parmesan shavings.

I had the brussels sprouts (fried in duck fat, mmm mmm mmm, with capers, anchovy and red wine vinaigrette. Not your grandmother's brussels sprouts. Well, not MY grandmother's anyway) and the paccheri (a rustic pork ragu) and a limonata. My dining companion had soup and lasagne.\n\nVery reasonable prices, especially for generous portions of well prepared food from a menu that was out of the ordinary. Total for 2 people, including tax, tip and health care surcharge was about 51 dollars.\n\nAlso: Attractive setting. Comfortable seating at the bar. Normally, being so short (think Bernadette on \"Big Bang Theory\"), I would prefer a communal table over bar seating because I practically have to get out a step-stool to clamber up on the stool, only to have my legs dangle as though I were a 6-year-old at an ice cream parlor -- but in this instance, I could tell from the photos on the restaurant website and on Yelp that the bar seating was slightly lower to the ground than you often encounter -- so it was a comfortable height, and you also didn't feel jammed in next to other diners or feel as though you were looking up a chef's nostrils.

All of the tables are \"communal\", and so even though my date and I had reservations, we opted for the bar seating so we could have more privacy. Service here is excellent and the waitress that helped us was very informative with explaining the menu. \n\nThe special menu items of the night were a hamachi crudo and a white bass for the fish entree, both of which we ordered and loved. The hamachi crudo melted in your mouth but wasn't heavy even with such a fatty fish and the olive oil. I got the sense that they were taking the best components of the fish and enhancing those flavors, which presented hamachi in a whole new light for me. The olives added that briny sea salt flavor without being in your face, complimenting the fish perfectly, and the blistered tomatoes added a delicate sweetness to a buttery texture. (It helps that I'm partial to hamachi, probably)\nThe white bass came out and for a minute I was afraid they had overcooked the fish. To my surprise, it was super juicy and seasoned perfectly. I loved that you could really just taste the simplicity of the ingredients in the dish all working together.\nWe also ordered the mushroom risotto croquette, which was really quite tasty, but I could probably have done without that. \nLastly we ordered the cavatell pasta made with sausage, prosciutto, and mushrooms. You can really tell the pasta was very fresh and hand-made and cooked perfectly al-dente. The sauce had a nice kick to it and the sausage and prosciutto added a nice smoky depth of flavor. \n\nEverything was delicious and my date and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

I've dined at neighboring Perbacco and I enjoy the relaxed, snazzy, modern atmosphere of this new sister restaurant.  We enjoyed the Duck Confit salad and the summer squash fondo bruschette.  The spinach duck confit was absolutely superb, with cherries mixed in for awesome flavor.  We easily split the large between 4 people.  The bruschette was unreal too, mainly because the squash was spiced and stewed.  Totally different and extremely savory.  \n\nWe all ordered pasta dishes, and I went with the rotolo pasta:  eggplant, ricotta cheese and tomato basil wrapped in round pasta. The combination was zesty and satisfying.  My companions went with the lasagna and the pork ragu.  \n\nI would recommend this Barbacco to anyone looking for a special occasion lunch or even a quick bite, as they have a take out bar readily available.

Because of my undeniable love for Perbacco I really wanted Barbacco to make all my hopes and dreams come true.\n\nForgive me for thinking that an establishment called BARbacco (key word being BAR) would serve booze; so you can imagine my horror upon ordering a Beefeater and Tonic after a rather hectic day and having to settle for sparkling wine. Oy!\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. focaccia / fresh herbs and sea salt: Yummy bread. Fresh, flavorful, delightfully light and soft.\n\n2. duck liver pate / balsamic roasted cherries: This pate was VERY heavy. The pate was a very thick spread and I ended up scraping a lot of it off so that I could better enjoy the flavor without being completely overwhelmed. It was a bit over the top.\n\n3. polpette - Sicilian meatballs with raisins and pine nuts / braised chard tomato sugo: The meatballs were really tasty. Flavorful, decent portion size, great spices used for flavor.\n\n4. fresh summer peas: I LOVE peas, but this dish was covered with a certain spice/herb that totally ruined it for me. It was very cilantro like, but I don't think it was cilantro. The herb was way too heavy handed for my tastes.\n\nOverall I think a bit less exuberance when it comes to adding flavor would do Barbacco well. They use fresh ingredients and I would love the flavor of the actual foods to come through without being overwhelmed by the heavy handed added spices and herbs.\n\nI definitely think I will give Barbacco another chance before abandoning it completely.\n\nCome on Barbacco...I REALLY want to love you, honest!", "author": "Becky M."}

We were told to come in and waited 10 minutes, at most, before a table was cleared for us. While waiting, we had some fun checking out their wine list on ipads! \n\nThe long tables are made for 8 and we had 9 with us to start. The (manager? owner?) came over and was completely gracious and accommodating (as well as perfectly stylish!) offering several solutions from splitting our table, to spilling into Perbacco next door as space cleared up. She decided to help us in a very unorthodox way by adding an extra seat behind our table. This isn't especially easy to do in a place that maximizes it's space to the Nth degree. The TVs were a little imposing on the ambiance... I would have thought, if I'd actually been here on a date. I suppose they need to keep the world cup playing for the suits coming in on their lunches and happy hours, but maybe they should just be turned off for dinner.\n\nWe shared a whole bunch of  bruschettas, cheeses and small plates. I was happy that on the whole, they seemed fresher and less greasy than at many other places that serve the same types of dishes.\nHere is a run down of my favorites:\n- The little fried fish were much lighter and more delicate in flavor and texture than I had imagined- so delicious!\n- Fried brussels sprouts were separated into paper thin flaky leaves, burnt tender crispy and seasoned well.\n- The stuffed pasta with eggplant and ricotta portion was huge and had a bright, fresh taste.\n\nI can see why this place gets rave reviews for plates AND service. Not once were we made to feel that we were imposing or ignored, (even though we were large in number, and we're a polite bunch but we can get a little raucous after a couple cocktails,) the food was perfectly paced and cleared, and our needs were very nearly anticipated.

I think I would almost invariably prefer an old-fashioned printed list, especially since it's not that long.  Makes comparisons harder actually.  Nonetheless, I had an excellent Vinera Massi Barberra.\n\nWe started with some lovely tasty arancini and a great assortment of bruschetta...the Lonza with roasted grapes was both subtle and mouth-watering.  I could have eaten a whole plate of these.  Sadly, for the main course, they were out of the farro, which is a grain that I love that's hard to find.  Instead we had the orechiette and polpette meatballs.  Both dishes came out very well.  A highlight was the side of brussel sprouts...lots of flavors going on, but it works in the end...with a really lovely crunch texture.  I wish I could make brussel sprouts like that.  Sam M. comes close with his brussel sprouts pizza.\n\nDesserts are actually reasonably priced.  Let me repeat that...DESSERTS ARE REASONABLY PRICED!  So many restaurants think that you'd like to pay $10 for a creme brulee...nope, not here.  The delectable Expresso Panna Cotta is $5 and a lovely butterscotch ice cream is only $2/scoop.  I'd bet if more restaurants had this pricing scheme they'd sell a lot more desserts.\n\nService was attentive, friendly, and non-intrusive.

The iPad was a cool feature but I enjoyed asking the sommelier questions. She even poured me a little taste of one thing I wanted to try without a fee. Glad I tried it; I didn't like it and ordered something else. No snobbery involved. \n\nWe ordered the Brussels Sprouts and they live up to the hype. They are fantastic. We shared one order between 3 girls and had plenty but not too much of this leafy green which can be gaseous. \n\nI ordered the Tuna Bruschetta was alright but a bit bland. The meatballs (3 in an order) were also good but nothing amazing. \n\nI enjoyed my time at Barbacco and plan to go back when I have time to try some of the larger dishes. They looked great as they passed my table. \n\nI will also go back because of the service and the staff. Cheers to them. They really do a great job at a busy, popular place.", "author": "Janell H."}

They have an outstanding wine list with excellent choices at all price points and equally outstanding service. Our server was high on integrity, offering strong opinions and great advice about some Sicilian wines (my homeland!) that we ended up *loving*. Our arancini were better than my aunt Beppa's (don't tell her I said that) and the marinated olives were literally a bucket of olives and served 4 people with room to spare. Crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth on the inside focaccia had me saying bye-bye to Atkins as soon as it hit the table. At around $60 for 4 people, we all left happy and ready to get on with the night. Great deal, great wine, great service, and great snacks. Score.\n\nLove this place. Go here.

Can't imagine how long we'd wait if we just walked in.  \n\nWe had the olive appetizer, the meatballs, the brussel sprouts, and the fried polenta. Everything was really good. I normally don't like brussel sprouts but these were pretty damn good! And the meatballs were excellent.

Normally this would be ok, but it was really hard to eat at the bar (not much room for all the shared plates). \n\nOverall: Really good but make a reservation - it gets crazy busy!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-26", "description": "Although I wish there was a more extensive selection of food - the offerings I tried were great. As advertised, Barbacco is a very wine-centered environment, and it is truly something you would find in San Francisco, with their wine menus accessible on iPads. The setting is fun, and lively. The food came out quick, hot, and well-prepared. Althought they do offer take-out, I would strongly encourage dining in. It is pricier, but the quality is comparable to the price.\n\nI liked their small portion sizes, and the little nibblings certainly filled us up. Favorites of mine would be the fried brussel sprouts, the local squid alla piastr (very well-seasoned), the farroto (farro risotto - interesting take on risotto), and of course, the beet salad. Restaurants would be remiss to not have that on their menu these days. \n\nThe manager Adelino was very hospitable, and gave us such the delightful experience, that we will certainly return for a weekday happy hour, or future dinner outing. Reservations had been made, but since we were a larger party during the famed dinner hour, we had to incur a slight bit of a wait. We felt a bit slighted at first, since some of our party had already arrived and had begun drinking, but like so many institutions in the city that have sister restaurants next door to each other, they did offer to come retrieve us from next door at Perbacco, when our table was ready. We elected to stay and ponder over their unlimited wine offerings, and wine flights (several of which that were very well-priced). Our server was very busy, but made sure that we could sample our bottles before ordering an entire one. \n\nWe especially loved that even though we were not celebrating a special occasion, they made our dinner a memorable one. In my experience, the restaurants that are cognizant of special occasions (in this case, an overdue sorority sister reunion) without us deliberating specifying, are those with the most well-trained staff, that are in tune with diners' wants, can best gauge their food interests, and can pick up on occasions. We appreciate the sampling of desserts! Will come back for the butter scotch-chocolate crunch gelato and chocolate nemesis cake!", "author": "Tammy H."}

It was absolutely delicious! The rest of the dishes that we shared together were also really good, but I gotta say that the menu was super hard to read.

They really lay it on thick with the duck pate, if it's your thing, go to town! I ordered the porchetta for an entree. The pork in the porchetta was cooked good. I'm not a die-hard fan of the Roli Roti truck like some people out there but I'll admit, I liked Roli Roti's porchetta a little bit better.

Note here: Make reservations!\n\nThe food here was pretty solid, ordered the focaccia, a sardine crostini, the farro risotto with mushroom, and the polpeti. \n\nLet me also say, having an ipad at the table, while cool to browse the wine list, is really clumsy and useless as the food actually starts hitting the table.\n\nThe food itself was like I said solid, nothing that blew me out of the water, but well executed. The sardine crostini was some local sardines and some egg salad, a good start. The risotto was delicious, creamy with a touch of mushroom and some parmesean. It was a little liquidy for my tastes, and still a shade al-dente, or toothsome as some like to put it.\n\nThe polpete. Underwhelming and the reason for this four star review as opposed to five. It's just meatballs. Nothing too special, not a lot of red sauce, some braised kale underneath. Well cooked but nothing to set it apart from the meatballs I might make during the weekend to go with spaghetti if you catch my drift.\n\nAll in all, I'd come here again as it was well priced for lunch ($30 with tip included), but please don't get the polpete here even if they tell you they're famous for it.", "author": "David H."}

Barbacco's sister's restaurant, Perbacco, has a special place in my heart - as it's the place I went the night I got engaged. The menu there is a little pricey to go on a regular basis, so I was counting down the minutes until the opening of Barbacco. Within the first two months it opened, my fianc\u00e9 and I went about four times - having the same waiter each time and...always ordering the Barbera. \n\nIf you like cheese, please run (not walk) to get the burratta. There are  no words. Creamy, cheap and so good. I've never had arancini before coming here, but I can't step foot in the restaurant without ordering the small fried balls filled  with risotto, cheese and pork. I tried last time to  not order it, but halfway through the meal felt the urge to order it. My fianc\u00e9 and I shared three of the bruchette  - the caponata, summer squash and crushed spring peas. The summer squash was my favorite by far. I  also recently had the tomato  soup which was not amazing - tasted like pasta sauce. A good pasta sauce...but still pasta sauce.\n\nSo why am I giving this place only 4 stars? Last  time I was there sitting at the counter, the chef in front of us preparing the cheese plates and desert was eating constantly off of things she was preparing - very gross.

You get to order a few different wines if you want to do tastings, and it's a little cheaper than if you were order a full glass of wine.  We ordered their butter squash pasta, the mussels to share, and the parpadelli pasta with ragu.  I would say everything was very flavorful, especially mussels, their broth was to die for.  My Bf said he would just come back for that dish.  They have bread you can order for $1 a pc, which kinda sucks, because I'm a bread lover, so when the Mgr came to ask if we wanted bread to eat with our broth from finishing our mussels dish, we said yes, and the charge was added to our bill.

Barbacco deserves 3.5 awesome stars in my book, but I have to round it down to 3.  I really hate to put a damper on the stellar reviews, but the restaurant did not live up to its hype. \n\ni think everything is just too damn salty..\n\nWE HAD:\nARANCINI: the taste is definitely there, but the texture is just a tad bit dry.  The whole croquette pretty much fell apart into multiple pieces after I stuck my fork in.  also, the dish really (and i mean REALLY) lacked any sort of mozzarella.  overall, still yummy.\n\nBRUSHETTE: duck liver pate/balsamic onion marmellata- this was delicious!!! everything, from the taste to texture, was on par.  my dinner buddy n i agreed that this is the definite winner of the night. lonza/roasted grape/saba- mehh.. i like the concept behind this little bruschette, but it really was nothing special, a little too hard to eat, and can easily be duped at home.  roasted mushrooms/garlic/parsley- this was yummy, but the burnt (i meant to say charred black) baguette that accompanied the mushrooms really threw this whole dish off.\n\nORECCHIETTE: this was voted the worst dish of the night.  i felt like i was eating a spinach salad, not pasta.  the ratio of spinach to orecchiette was like 3:1.  I get that this is supposed to be a \"light\" dish.  However, it was salty, but at the same time, lacked any depth of flavor.  We ended up packing this to go, and we kept pushing the to go bag back and forth cuz neither one of us wanted to bring this home.  Definite miss for our table.\n\nFLAT IRON STEAK TAGLIATA: this dish was really yummy!  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and it was really tender and flavorful.  The king trumpet mushrooms were cooked to perfection, and the cipollini onions complemented the steak quite nicely.  However, my friend and I both agreed that it is just a little teeny bit salty.  Other than that, we loved this dish!\n\nFRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS: you know how chefs always tell us novice cooks that we should only add things to enhance the flavor of the star ingredient?  Well, the rule apparently did not adhere to this dish. I barely tasted the brussels sprouts itself because the dish was doushed with the red wine vinaigrette.  However, I do like how they were roasted in the oven.  Thumbs up to the texture.  Overall, it was a only A-OK.\n\nESPRESSO PANA COTTA: lovely end to our meal.  I really liked this dish.  I really tasted the flavors of the espresso, and it was not overly sweet.  yum!\n\nOTHER PROS: I made reservations today at 4:30pm, and although they were extremely busy, the hostess managed to squeeze me in.  :)  We were originally supposed to sit at the communal tables, but the lovely host seated us at the bar (par request).  The service wasn't the greatest because it was an extremely busy night, but the waiter did make a point to check up on us every once in awhile.. kudos to you, mr. waiter! Also, I really like the idea of using ipads for the wine menu.  :)\n\nI definitely want to try this restaurant again, only because you fellow yelpers gave this place such great reviews.

There were 5 of us and we had a taste of everything. Everyone in my party was raving about the brussel sprouts (we had 2 orders of this!) and the mussels (so fresh and plump). However, the pasta dishes were underwhelming and weren't thoroughly cooked. I do like my pasta al dente, but not like this -- as if almost uncooked. \n\nAnother to add to my *favorites* list. :)", "author": "J T."}

I like dinner more because they have a wider selection of food. It's Italian style tapas and definitely meant to be shared family style. Let me discuss my favorite dishes.\n\nI do like the arancinis and how can you really go wrong with fried risotto croquettes filled with a little bit of short ribs and cheese. At $3/croquette, I don't always order them, but would recommend it if it's your first visit there.\n\nDefinitely try the bruschette! They have seasonal varieties and I like the classic tomato version (not always in season) and the duck liver pate with caramelized balsamic onions on top. The different combinations of bruschette are unique and go well together. Not really a big fan of the lardo (didn't really think it had a ton of taste).\n\nThey were out of the lasagna so we ordered the paccheri pasta with pork ragu. The pasta is big tube pastas (imagine giant rigatoni, not as big as manicotti). At first, I was thrown off by how the pasta was thicker and so the texture was not what I was expecting. The sauce won me over though and we didn't have problems polishing off that dish.\n\nThe flat iron steak is a winner. I think that might be my go-to \"need to order this every time I come here\" dish. It was cooked perfectly (they ask you how you like your meat cooked) and sliced into strips with you. It's seasoned so well with salt but not too salty. The mushrooms and little pearl onions are delicious too.\n\nThe quick braised squid is also cooked very well. It's not tough or rubbery and comes in a casserole dish with a yummy tomato sauce. I'm also a fan of the fried brussel sprouts. Trust me, you've never had brussel sprouts like this before. They don't have a normal brussel sprouts taste, but you can taste the vinegar.\n\nThe only thing I have ordered here and not liked is the mushroom risotto. Funny how the fried risotto croquettes are so delicious but pass on the entree. It lacked flavor and just wasn't very good... the mushrooms were good but not the actual risotto.\n\nService is excellent and the wine selection is vast (plus it's on iPads). The seating is either at the bar counter or on tandem tables (also high seats). Not the most comfortable seating but it's a fun, lively atmosphere!", "author": "Jackie T."}

So good that we ordered some focaccia on the side to sop-up all the sauce.\n\nThe wine selection is great and the staff is very helpful.  They even use an iPAD to organize their wine cellar (not that this has anything to do with the review).\n\nWhy the 5-stars?  Cause the prices are not outrageous and the food was great.

My husband has been a frequent patron here and was anxious for me to try it. We sat at the bar on a Tuesday night and enjoyed a lovely meal. The waiter was very helpful and attentive, but not overly so. We split a half bottle of the Bacchus pinot and enjoyed the complimentary mineral water, which i learned is made in house. We started with the roasted carrots and the mushroom brushette. Carrots were tasty and had a fantastic herb yogurt sauce. Hubby loved the brushette. We split the tagliata and the fresh fish, which was some sort of cod. The tagliata (strip steak) was prepared perfectly at medium rare and served over arugula. The fish was surrounded by beans and had a lovely light sauce. We also split the brussel sprouts which were close to burnt but surprisingly delicious! The total tab was around $100.00 plus tip which isn't bad for a such quality. Will return!!", "author": "Mary B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-21", "description": "Located right next door to Perbacco, Barbacco is like the younger enthusiastic sibling trying to break away from the shadow of its older wiser counterpart. As a result you get a hip and trendy Italian Trattoria that's a bit more laid back serving up food that's just as good but at a friendlier price point. Definitely a great place to take your clients if you want them to be at ease and not appear to be too pretentious.  \n\nThe wine menu: It was larger than the food menu and had a good selection of wines listed by region. Unlike most restaurants, the Barbacco wine menu has 3oz pours -- perfect for those who are indecisive at heart. In addition, there was a hearty list of wines by the glass. Most restaurants give you a few choice selections and the rest of the wine menu consists of the bottles. \n\nThe dinner menu: Though consisting of only 2 pages, the selections are pretty solid. I like the idea of listing the salumi plates separately--another great option for the indecisive. My guest and I ordered 2 salumi dishes. The duck mortadella, with its perfect texture and taste, blew me away...so much so that I have forgotten what the other salumi plate was. For our second course, we had the squid and mussels. The mussels were very fresh and the sauce was so well balanced I could have drunk it as a soup. The main course consisted of the ribs, carpaccio, pork ragu, and a side of brussels sprouts. Out of the three, the carpaccio was the best. What makes a good carpaccio plate perfect is not only how thin the meat is cut nor how fresh it is. A perfect carpaccio plate sits on top of a bed of arugula and is sprinkled with just the right amount of salt. \n\nPeople often say of the younger sibling that they can go either way--they can become so spoiled rotten that they make nothing of themselves and just live in other people's shadow, or they try so hard to be seen as an individual that they break the mold and become someone great. I believe the latter will be true of Barbacco.", "author": "Sue L."}

There were five of us and we had no idea what to order.  Maybe this place can update their menu and photo-rize it.  The restaurant link on yelp is wrong, so you have to google their website.  Their pdf dinner menu is exactly what it's like.....which is a bunch of words.\n\nAnyways, let's get to the food, which is really awesome.\n\nAppetizers *The entire left page is appetizers*\n\nArancini - Croquettes filled with pork and mozzarella.  I wish I ordered this.  I don't remember how I forget.  \n\nCoppa - 4 slices of salumi for $6......not worth it in my book.  But to all his own.  I wouldn't try anything under the Salumi section next time.\n\nBurrata - Grilled filone *bread* with some amazing mozzarella and ruola *herbs*.  Everyone enjoyed this dish so much we almost ordered second.  The cheese was simply amazing.  This is a must try.\n\nBruschette - 3 for $8...\nDuck Liver Pate - yuck.....almost didn't want to eat it.  I was expecting something similar to Goose liver but I was so wrong.  I had duck liver before and whatever they did to it made it horrible.  \n\nTruffle Lardo - a bit salty but it's good.  It's truffle oil on pork slices.\n\nCrushed peas and artichokes - ymmy and healthy.  Good stuff.\n\nHouse Cured Sardine - I shoulda try this one.  Next time.\n\nEntree\nSpinch Lasagna - Possible the best lasagna I had in life.  The chessiness and overall flavor and saltiness was perfect.  Top layer cheese was crusty and melty.  So freaking good.  Can't really distinguish the spinach flavor tho.  Totally worth it for $12.\n\nPolpette - Sicilian Meatballs.  Another awesome dish.  Almost every table has an order of this.  The meatball has raisins and pinenuts for flavor.  The tomato sugo was perfect for the meatball.  3 big ones for $12 bucks.  \n\nFennel Rubbed Pork Ribs with fennel salad.  5 pork ribs with very flavorful crust from the rubs.  It's cooked properly and taste great with the fennel salad.  Yum\n\nMilanese - Fried Pork cutlet.  This is the most ordinary entree of the night.  I was not as amazed as the other three.  The size of the culet was plenty though.  So it makes up for it hahaha.  But we only ordered this because we were looking for 1 more dish and they ran out of duck.\n\nSides\n\nPatate in padella - Roasted potato with caramelized onion.  This is a dish that's so awesome and so cheap we ordered 2.  The sweetness of the onion and whatever salt on the potato made it almost perfect.\n\nDeserts\nGelato - Spiced chocolate with a hint of cinnamon was the best in my opinion.  Second was the butterscotch choco crunch.  And third was the torrone.  Torrone is a nutty candy bar that they cracked and put it into the ice cream.  Not my type of nutty ice cream.  Just get all three and share with the table.  They are $2 each so it's not expensive at all.\n\nSorberto - strawberry flavor.  It's alrite.  I like gelato.\n\nThis place is 2 blocks from bart and has plenty of street parking after the meter stops.  So I would love to come here again for dinner.  Probably not lunch tho since I don't like to bus.\n\nThe ambiance here is perfect for date.  Crowd is not loud at all and the lighting is low and gentle.  Dress to impress but not mandatory.\nDon't come here to chow down.  This is a place to hold a conversation and enjoy the company and the atmosphere.\n\nOnce again, 4.5 stars.", "author": "Ricky N."}

Suspiciously, when we indicated that we were not likely to stay and wait for a table if it was going to be that long (basically a full 30 minutes after our reservation time), she was able to find us a table in the next 2 minutes.

It was a Monday night at 8 and every table was full, which is always a good sign. We luckily had reservations and were greeted by a wonderfully friendly hostess, who let us know it would be a few minutes and pointed to an empty space at the counter where we could have a glass of wine and wait. For a place that doesn't actually have a bar, this was a nice option.\nOnce we were seated we instantly ordered the brussel sprouts, not because I knew that they were basically known for them, but because they are my go-to and I order them everywhere I go. We also ordered a bottle of a California Sauvignon Blanc, cause \"when in Rome\". The brussel sprouts come out and it happens...I taste one of the most amazing things I've ever tried!! (Reminder: Brussel sprouts are kind of my thing) They had the perfect amount of seasoning and flavor. You know sometimes you order them and the flavor is good, but you bite into it and your mouth is filled with an over-the-top flavor that messes with palate?? Well these didn't do that...they were perfect in every way.\n\nWe then decided to stick with a couple apps for the time being....we tried the:\n- Seasonal fruit salad with arugula and whipped ricotta cheese - Wow!! These flavor combos were well thought out and fresh as fresh can be! Excellent light start for any meal.\n~ Bruchetta on toast with goat cheese? (don't quote me on that) - Perfect crunch and perfect flavor balance\n\nAfter chatting it up with the two gentlemen beside us, we got friendly enough to offer bites of our competing appetizers....so we also tried..\n\n-Sicilian Meatballs - Delicious and so tender! But not falling apart tender...held together in the best way tender.\n-Spreadable salami of some sort - this was very interesting, but actually very tasty. It was basically just a sausage without the casing...but a very delicious sausage.\n\nAt this point we were stuffed to the brim, but we had to try the pasta dishes we had ordered before filling ourselves with all the amazing apps (which we didn't regret one bit). We ordered the  orecchiette pasta \"little ears\" with fennel sausage and Farrotto risotto dish. \n- The Orecchiette had perfectly cooked al dente pasta with crumbled sausage...it was absolutely delicious.\n- The Farrotto was unlike any risotto dish I've ever had, in the best way possible.

Unfortunately, we were not able to have wine, as we were heading back to work afterwards.  I actually did enjoy the items that I ordered - meatballs and the brussels sprouts fried in duck fat, they both were delish.  \n\nMy coworkers' meal, however, was not a great experience. She is a vegetarian and ordered butternut squash pasta and cauliflower with cheese as a side dish. The pasta was ok, just nothing to write home about. However, trying to stay decently healthy during the holidays, she wanted a nice side of veggies to compliment her pasta. We expected cauliflower with a little bit of cheese on top. What she got was a little bit of cauliflower swimming in some awful creamy sauce. It didn't even taste like cheese.  It was gross and really heavy, with tons of butter in it. So much so, that the cauliflower was barely noticeable.  Hey, if we want cheese, we can get a cheese plate.  If we want a yummy yet heavy side, we could get fries, or something to that effect. But we did want a healthy veggie side, which this was definitely not, but you wouldn't guess that from the description.  She had a couple of bites and left it alone. However, we didn't even order dessert that we planned on getting because she felt gross after eating a bit of that dish.  Considering that she picked up the bill for the lunch that she didn't enjoy very much, I did feel bad for choosing Barbacco over Perbacco for this outing.\n\nMy suggestion to the restaurant is to leave veggies as veggies for those of us who like at least some healthy alternatives for our meal.  The brussels sprouts were an excellent example of that - still the veggies that i love with delicious flavor added by duck fat that was not overbearing.  \n\nWith so many great choices in FiDi, we are not tempted to come back.", "author": "Marina S."}

They are serious about their reservations, just come on time. \n\nAlthough we were seated at the bar area (not so good sometimes for a party of 3), it was just fine. The decor was classy, perfect for a hump day dinner + wine. But the decor isn't what I'm still thinking about.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Cabernet for $43, not bad at all. Here's what I loved in the order of preference.\n\n1: Butterscotch Gelato ($2, are you kidding!? SO CHEAP)\nOne of my friends has the BIGGEST sweet tooth I know, and he has declared it his favorite ice cream. He even wanted to buy a quart to go! (Unfortunately they don't sell it to go). The flavor was spot on, not overwhelmingly sweet, just like I like it.\n\n2: Duck Pate Bruschetta ($3 or $8/3)\nDelish!! They might give you a ton of pate, but it's so good. Balanced with a balsamic reduction and an onion jam on toasted bread. MUST HAVE!\n\n3: Fried Brussels Sprouts ($4)\nTo those kids who used to feed their brussels sprouts to their dogs, fear no more! Fried Brussels Sprouts are here!! Any hint of nutrition is taken out once these babies are fried - but who cares, this ish is the bomb! Definitely not what I expected when I ordered it, but it was an awesome surprise.\n\n4: Spinach Lasagna ($12)\nVegetarians be warned, this is not your average spinach lasagna, it's actually pork+veal ragu beautifully layered between a spinach pasta with a light cream sauce. This was just what I needed for some good Italian lovin' and highly recommended.\n\nI don't give out 5 stars loosely, but this place is worth recommending!!", "author": "Shelly L."}

We started with the bruschette: chicken liver pate, bean and duck, and peach with prosciutto. The clams was probably our favorite dish...super flavorful, light, and delicious broth. The brussel sprouts, as everyone had mentioned, was delicious. Our least favorite dish was the pork ragu over pasta. Perhaps if they used a different kind of pasta, like a papardelle or tagliatelle would have been a better choice. \n\nUnfortunately we were way too stuffed to try any of the desserts, hopefully next time!

Great recommendation.  \n\nFood has been excellent both times.

It's one of the best things I've eaten in SF - a must have). \n- Seared tuna\n- Rigolo with rustic pork\n\nI will say that a few dishes, particularly the farm eggs, have been oversalted, but not dramatically so.  We also sent our tuna back as it was overseared, but they replaced it promptly and apologized, so no harm, no foul there.  \n\nMy wife and I dined there last night and had a salad, a bruschetta order (3 for $8), the farm eggs, two entrees, a dessert and 3 glasses of wine.

First off, they use ipads for their drink menu which was really cool at first especially when trying to figure out what wine you want. However, it got distracting during the meal... not sure if I was a fan or if it was too much.  I did like how they described the wines so you can choose one you wanted to try.\n\nWe were seated on the counter which was fine and right next to the prepping station.  We ordered four dishes and everything was delicious. The first item was a deep fried dough ball filled with risotto, mozzarella and short ribs. Yummy.  We had a duck pate bruchetta with caramelized onions, which was perfectly done, both sweet and savory at the same time. Our next dish was tripe cooked in a sweet tomato red sauce over a crispy bread.  It was pleasantly sweet and not overly done.

I had pasta with bolognese sauce, which was very savoury. My partner had the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and anchovies (but we could barely taste the anchovy so that was a bit of a miss). Food prices are quite low: we had 2 starters and two pastas, in total $30. \n\nThe wine list is confusing and misleading. \n\nThere are 5 choices: 3oz, 6oz, Quarto, Mezzo and Full Bottle. The Quarto (Italian for 1/4) means, at least to me, 1/4 bottle. The Mezzo (Italian for 1/2) means 1/2 bottle to me. \n\nHowever, our waitress explained that Quarto is a glass of wine. So in my head it would be 187.5 ml (which is 1/4 of 750 ml). Sounds about right for a glass. But you pay more than 1/4 of the wine bottle price. I never got around to finding out if the amount they pour into a glass is exactly 187.5 ml because I gave up. Too exhausting.\n\nI feel this restaurant is trying to rip us off on wine by creating these 5 categories where 1/4 may or may not be equal to 1/4 in volume, but the price is more than 1/4 the price of the bottle. \n\nAs such it is expensive: $15-$19 per \"quarto\" or glass of pretty average Italian wines. When I was in Rome last September, I paid 3.50 EUR for a carafe of very good (house) wine. In Barcelona, you go to a good tapas bar or restaurant, they pour you a sizable glass of excellent wine and it rarely ever cost me more than 8 EUR. \n\nSo we ended up just eating, no wine, bill came to $30, which is an excellent deal. \n\nBarbacco is very noisy. The ceilings are low so the effect is quite claustrophobic. \n\nWe ate at Credo two weeks ago, a few blocks away at Pine and Montgomery and that was much, much better. Better service, large tables not clapped together so closely, not a big ripoff on wine, chef came out to greet the guests, much more civilized for dinner. \n\nOK Barbacco is a BAR first and foremost . . .

Really, these statements are contradictory but they are the best way to describe last night's long-awaited dinner date.\n\nI've been wanting to check out Barbacco since reading about it in a tantalizing article on Urban Daddy. Finally, nearly five months later, we made a reservation. Note on the reservation: I was slow getting ready so we were a half hour late, but the bf called in and the restaurant said that was not a problem: when we arrived, we were seated immediately and our seats had a 'reserved' card on them. Major points there.\n\nBut ok, the FOOD!!! Simply amazing. I want to come back and try the other items on the menu we didn't get to. What we did get to, however, was the salumi, the flatiron steak, mushroom risotto, 3 types of bruschettes (eggplant, spring pea and artichoke), asparagus, and two types of gelato. The plates are small but mighty; we definitely weren't hungry. Minus the bottle of Riesling I insisted on getting (and they have like 8 different Rieslings!), dinner would have been around $50. TOTAL WIN RIGHT THERE.\n\nA note on the staff and environment as well: the staff is really friendly and accommodating (back to our late arrival) and even though the restaurant is shared tables (we sat at the bar), you don't feel like you're in everyone's business.

We ordered so much food, the elderly man at the next table felt the need to exclaim (and loudly), \"How can you girls eat so much?!\" We would have been embarrassed if we weren't so distracted by the deliciousness on our plates. \n\nThe fried brussels sprouts are heaven on a plate. I could eat a whole meal of these brussels sprouts. I can't stop thinking about them. \n\nThe best mussels in a spicy chili sauce. I was really tempted to drink the broth after we'd devoured all the mussels and toast. \n\nThe farro risotto was rich and flavorful. The meatballs out of this world. The asparagus was really good, but the most subtle of everything we ordered. \n\nI also love that they offer several different wine pouring options: 3 oz, 6 oz, or 8.5 oz. I can never have more than one glass in a setting, so I loved that I could try a couple of different wines without getting blotto. \n\nJust one question for the owners - why the huge sports bar-style TVs over the bar?! Seemed completely incongruous and distracting. It's a much more elegant restaurant than that. Yes, the bar extends the length of the restaurant and I understand that they're the downmarket cousin of Perbacoo, but that doesn't mean they need to cheapen themselves with those TVs.

It was a perfect match to the lovely meat sauces and cheese plate we had next. For our cheese plate we chose the gorgonzola with chestnut honey and the lonzo (pork loin soaked in red wine). The pungent yet creamy gorgonzola very much complimented the sweetness of the honey and the salty warm flavor of the pork. \n\nFor our main entrees I had the spinach lasagna with a bolognese ragu balsamella sauce, the ultimate definition of a comforting pasta dish without being ridiculously heavy, perhaps it was the spinach lasagna noodles that lightened it. My husband had the polpette:  Sicilian meatballs with raisins and pine nuts, and braised chard with a tomato sugo. I definitely appreciate the Sicilian style meatball, the sweetness of the dried fruit and the ground nuts whether pine nuts or pecans add such wonderful layers of flavor.\n\nWe finished our meal with the chocolate nemisis cake, I have to admit I believe ordered purely for its name.

We didn't have reservations but they squeezed us in at the counter, which was surprisingly comfortable (the husband wants me to add here that he enjoyed sliding his silverware around on the placemats in between courses, but then, he's easily entertained).  I am not usually a fan of bar stools (I'm short, okay), but these were only a little bit taller than regular chairs and had a well-placed footrest bar, good padding, and a decent back, so I actually quite liked them.  Plus there are hooks underneath the counter for hanging your purse, which is a nice touch, and it's fun to watch the staff assemble some of the dishes in right front of you.\n\nOur waitress was an absolute delight, attentive and informative and friendly and fun without being obtrusive.\n\nI had a strawberry-lavender lemonade, which could've been more lavender-y, but was still delicious (and also a goodly amount -- sometimes when you order specialty drinks it feels like you barely get three sips in and it's gone; that is not the case here, I'm pleased to report).  We started with the suppli, which had a nicely distinct wild mushroom flavor and were yummy but probably would've been even yummier with marinara (which is possibly non-traditional?  I have no idea.  But it's how our favorite Italian place in Austin serves them).  The pastas were a highlight for me -- I got the orecchiette with sausage and my husband got the paccheri with pork ragu and they were both exceptional.  My favorite pasta dishes are the ones that seem simple but are full of flavor and perfectly balanced.  Both of the dishes we had hit that mark and hit it _hard_.  So freaking good!  The sides were also excellent (we got the brussels sprouts fried in duck fat, because how could we not, and the fried polenta), as were the desserts.  I loved my almond cake with its little dab of milk chocolate ganache, quenelle of vanilla cream, and generous pile of deliciously tart-sweet marinated cherries and crunchy toffee bits.  And my husband's chocolate nemesis cake was rich dark flourless chocolate goodness, creamy and sinful.\n\nSo, to recap:\nService: Perfection\nFood: Ranging from very good to spectacular, and more the latter than the former\nValue: Very high\n\nI could imagine paying more elsewhere for every single part of that meal, and in some cases a lot more.

I was surprised at how difficult it is to book a table on a weeknight.  We ended up with no choice but a 5 o'clock reservation. \n\nBeware: because the dinner reservation is so early and Barbacco shares the same valet as Perbacco, the valet may not even be there at 5.  My friend was frantically getting confused not knowing where to park when the valet guy was just showing up for work and hadn't had a chance to bring out his podium yet.  \n\nThe place is nice. Modern and sleek.  Most of the tables have semi-high chairs and seat six people.  So if you are a party of four, you are sitting with two random strangers.  I find this to be very prevalent in SF's new restaurants now.  Is it a way to save space?  perhaps. \n\nThe menu has a bunch of choices, all meant to be shared.  For starters, we had the croquettes and the bruschettes.  The croquettes with risotto were good, but not mind blowing like France's chickpea fritters.  Perhaps unfair to compare, but that's what came to mind when I was thinking about something starchy and fried.  \n\nAs for the bruschettes, I had the cannellini bean one.  The extra raw onions on top really ruined the subtle taste of the beans.  Again, maybe unfair to compare, but in my mind I was ready to drool over something that resembles the fava bean bruschettes from Beretta, and when it comes out less delicious, I get disappointed.  \n\nMy friends who had the duck liver bruschettes couldn't stop raving about them.  In fact, they liked it so much that when it came time to order desserts, they order a duck liver bruschette.  The other bruschettes they tried, asparagus, and sardines, were decent but didn't get much comment like the duck liver one. \n\nFor entree, I got the rigatoni pasta with ricotta cheese and asparagus and meyer lemon and mint.  Yes, the ingredients sound, unusual.  But they work extremely well together.  Texture of the pasta is perfect, the ricotta cheese is so light and blends so well with the other subtle flavors of lemon and mint.  Very good dish.  Pretty much what bumped this place to a four star from a three star restaurant. \n\nTwo friends had the steak, which were too salty according to them.  And unlike pasta which comes in a what I considered as entree size portion, the steaks didn't come with sides.  so if you are the kind that expects the meat entree to be surrounded by some sort of starch or veggies, then order something extra. \n\nOne friend ordered the rotolo pasta and it was alright. \n\nFor dessert we had the Cowgirl creamery red hawk cheese (a tiny piece) and the special, the cookie-n-cream cup of ice cream.  Ice cream was delicious, and only $2!\n\nFor some reason, our tab still added up to about $150 for four people.  The low prices of the dishes do add up when you order a bunch (plus wine).\n\nOverall, I can think of other places I recently visited that stood out more than Barbacco, but it does have its highlights and it's quite good for a post-work get together in downtown.", "author": "Candice B."}

This is speaking in food terms.  I guess I can say the service, vibe and wine were not that bad.\n\nOur waitress was graceful and happy, always a plus.  We tried mostly her recommendations.  Started with the chef's selection meat plate, small one.  In general, the selection was very bland.  Flavors were fairly similar and yeah, meh.  Didn't care for it.  Cheap and very generous portion, thus, pretty boring and low quality.\n\nNext, Burrata cheese.  Wow, what a disappointment.  I am not a cheese expert, but I know Burrata is best when it's served within 24 hours, and you end up with a nice buttery, rich mozzarella flavor.  This one was very past due.  So bitter and harsh on the palate.  Also, I really didn't get the extra salty arugula salad on the side.  Extra punishment.  Anyways...\n\nSpinach Lasagna, hmmm.  I could have liked it if I didn't know it was lasagna.  Once I saw the nice crusty layers I got excited, but the flavor was down the hill.  I understand spinach is delicate and all, but I mean the sauce was nonexistent.  \n\nSo sorry barbacco.  I will try it again I am sure.  Not for a while though.\n\nOne other funny thing was the service stuff getting hypnotized in front of the big tvs watching baseball games.  haha.  :)  they are having fun.\n\nyeah, i don't know.

Almost unheard of in the financial district.\n\nDelicious food- All the food was pretty high quality. It's kind of tapas style and the plates are not that big. I had:\n-Brussel sprouts: very well done brussel sprouts, with balsamic vinegar. It's quite nice if a little salty for me.\n-Pork ragu- al dente, fresh fat pasta tubes. They were soft but a little chewy at the same time. I love this kind of pasta... it's a cross between the sheet pasta of lasagna and other more chewy types of pasta like penne. The pork ragu had some mint in it, which brought out the flavors.\n-Risotto croquette- MMMM!! My favorite of the night. Cheesy risotto, breaded and fried. \n-Olive oil cake with cherries- I think I only read this description halfway. Olive oil cake sounds delicious to me- it was basically a fatty cake that tasted like delicious olive oil goodness. Like a butter cake, but without the butter! But I actually don't like cherries that much, which made the dish slightly less enjoyable\n\nCozy ambience- You get an Ipad to peruse drink options. They have Iron Chef playing on flat screen TVs. We were seated at the bar with a HUGE pig leg in front of us. I adore the place settings and decor; it's dark and intimate inside, but also trendy and a fun place worthy of happy hour.\n\nCute waiters- my waiter had a killer smile, which he used frequently. Enough said.", "author": "Cathy S."}

My expectations were set high and I was ready to be impressed! \n\nDecided to take my boyfriend here during my lunch break, so I made reservations for 1:30. It was very busy when we walked in, and the hostess seemed very aloof and disengaged. We were not sat for almost 20 minutes past our reservation. Normally I am less irritated by this, because things happen and it may not be the hostess/host fault. However, this hostess was not reassuring at all or helpful, and appeared as if she was listening to little voices inside her head instead of the questions we and other patrons were asking. \n\nFinally sat down, our server was nice but nothing special. I was dissapointed with the lack of vegetarian options, but ordered the raddichio and fennel panini. It was good, but again, nothing special, nothing that I could not recreate at home. Same went for my boyfriends grilled Lamb sandwich. He did comment that the meat was cooked perfectly, yet the sandwich lacked condiments/texture, making it a bit dry and bland. \n\nThe one thing (at least he) was impressed with was the N'dja, the famous spreadable salami. I don't eat meat, but he said it was incredible, full of spice and flavor that never got old. \n\nAll in all, it was a mediocre experience, do not plan on going back any time soon. Too many other places in SF that have stolen my heart!", "author": "Kate V."}

The restaurant is located very close to where I used to work, and adjacent to one of the Charles Schwab branches (200 California St.).  :)\n\nI have to say our server was a little bit weird and somehow I felt he wasn't very comfortable interacting with customers (just my personal opinion), but he managed to make some good suggestions of the dishes nonetheless.\n\nI enjoyed their arancini (risotto croquettes filled with braised pork, mozzarella and peas), bruschette (I liked the duck liver pate especially), and flat iron steak very much.

Heading to FiDi for dinner is really only enjoyable if there's another reason to be in the neighborhood\n-Wait staff did not seem to value their wine knowledge and seemed rather aloof when asked about the different wines by the glass.  A big disappointment given the list was extensive and intimidating\n-Closing time.  We were seated at 9PM on a Saturday and we were the last table to leave at around 1030PM.  For an Italian meal on a Saturday night, it felt like we were at a children-themed restaurant like Red Robin where the wait staff was not used to working at 1030PM on a Saturday night.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- arancini (very good, everyone liked it at our table)\n- roasted beets, gorgonzola, almonds, vinaigrette (very good as well)\n- fried brussels spouts, capers, anchovy, vinaigrette (was not served piping hot and the combination of the flavors ended up too bitter vs desired vinegar taste)\n- flat iron steak, rucola, reggiano.  we both ordered this and agreed it was perfect.  cooked exactly as we ordered and the minimal flavors really worked together to create the perfect steak.  great portion size\n- chocolate nemesis cake.  nothing mind-blowing but a deliciously rich chocolate cake to end the meal.\n\nWould go again - if only for the ambiance and exciting wine list", "author": "Gracie L."}

The bar was busy with people eating and drinking. Once we sat, our waiter was super nice. Recommended a fabulous red wine which I wish I could remember. Our food was fantastic.\n\nThe seating is family style so if you are trying to get to know someone on an intimate level, you may want to pass on this place and save it for a later date (if you make it that far ;)  However, it's very casual in an elegant sort of way. Lots of different types of people which lead to the wonderfully cool atmosphere of Barbacco.\n\nThe wine menu is all on ipads which they give to each group. It's a cool idea but I found myself getting lost going back and forth and forgetting that I was there to enjoy the company I was with!  Given that the technology was there, I wish they had a tiny description of each wine.\n\nThey have a great menu. Dishes are available in a variety of sizes which you can share.  Contemporary Italian in a really nice, simple, yet delicious way.  Nothing was muddled or over seasoned. Everything tasted fresh and clean.\n\nMy experience here was great.

The food was generally delicious -- the meatballs and brussels sprouts in particular were wonderful. Salumi plate was unimpressive, though (Boccalone is much better). \n\nThis place has a bizarre drinks list. They only serve wine and beer, and don't have many by-the-glass options; my friend tried a honey ale and I tried a sparkling red wine out of curiosity (both at the bartender's suggestion) and they were both awful. \n\nAlso, I really don't mind communal or bar seating, but the bar chairs are so tightly packed that you can barely eat without hitting another person.

We ordered small plates first to go with our champagne, the prosciutto and the brussel sprouts fried in duck fat and vinaigrette were my absolute favorite! I was a bit disappointed to find out that the seafood (tuna on the menu that night) was cooked ahi style. I was hoping for something grilled drizzled with flavorful sauce or something. Nonetheless, the service was awesome, our waiter new the menu well and made great recommendations. Decided to order the steak and chicken for dinner. The steak they normally cook medium rare or rare only, had to tell our waiter to cook it medium. The chicken was on the dry side but tasty. Next time I will try one of their pasta dishes, I heard they are delish as well. Would have given it 3/12 to 4 stars but again, seafood selection was pretty weak and portions are on the light side.

Blending the fresh ingredients of CA farms and infusing classic northern Italian cuisine, the food was sublime.  I had an amazing salad of fresh buffala mozzarella with sauted golden and red beets.  And I rarely eat beets.  This was an amazing dish.  I then enjoyed an entree of duck sausage with grilled potenta.  Hearty, flavorful, filling, and very rich.  It also included sauted red onions which was a nice touch to cut some of the richness of the duck.  \n\nOrdered the wine on an iPad as well, which was fun.  A bit gimmicky, but fun anyway.  \n\nPrices were not unreasonable.  For what I had, I say the prices were downright cheap.

The crowd is a mix of business and pleasure.  Everything we tried on the menu was pretty good.  I especially liked the olive oil cake for dessert.  It made quite an impression on our entire table even though they had originally insisted they didn't want any dessert they were all persuaded to try it, then all dug in.  There was only one miss with the \"angry\" mussels.  Mussels in my opinion, like oysters, need to be just the right size.  Too small and they seem shriveled and paltry.   Too big though and they are a mouthful, chewy and kinda gross to eat.  These mussels were too big.  A bit much.  Other than that no complaints about the salumi, olive oil tuna, heirloom tomatoes, polepette or brussel sprouts.  The wine was also delish though it was odd to have an iPad at every table for the wine list/explanation.  I don't associate the constant beaming of information with a pleasant evening of dining.  It made it feel as I should be doing something other than paying attention to my tablemates.  It's also very loud in the restaurant.

Insanely good and addicting. \n - Burratta - if you are a mozzarella lover like us you have to try this.  \n - Spinach Lasagna - my server told me this is the best lasagna he has ever had....I couldn't agree more.  \n - Tagliata Steak - simple but amazing.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned thinly sliced steak.\n - Polpette - delicious meatballs served with only sauce so make sure you order some foccacia with it to soak it all up.", "author": "Dan L."}

Came in with a couple co-workers in a collective effort to not eat lunch in front of our computers while answering e-mails.  It was busy enough so that we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, but they did offer some iced teas on the house which was nice.\n\nShared dishes so I had half of the Caponata and half of the Poached Chicken.  The Chicken won.  I thought I would like the Caponata just because it sounded amazing (eggplant, mozzarella, pine nuts, raisins and basil...right?), but the Chicken was just better.  I'm thinking it was the dolcelatte, which I found out is a type of cheese.  A sweet, creamy, delicious cheese with higher than normal fat content, even for cheese.  Definitely would explain the superiority of the chicken sandwich.  Cheese just makes things better.  Which reminds me I will have to come back to try the buratta.  Yum.", "author": "K P."}

Also, I've been to Perbacco and I like Barbacco better.

The rustic pork ragu sauce is as others have described, hearty and filling but light in taste. The real kicker is the freshly  made pasta which they recently changed to maccheroni alla chitarra. It has a thicker texture and a slightly stronger, more prominent taste than your store bought pastas (love it!). I think I was told that the Chef slaves away in the back, feeding the dough through guitar strings. :) I'd go back just for these dishes alone.

They were all great. I think they were my favorite item.\n- Duck Pate: I didn't realize how this came as an entire dish (vs. one piece like the bruschetta). Anyway, it was so rich and in some ways its like adding more bruschetta (in addition to the previous order) so it was too much and it is so rich, you can only eat a little - at least that's how I felt. I wish they would make this a choice for the 3 bruschetta options.\n- Pork Ragu pasta: It's okay. Not mind-blowing. \n- Brussel Sprouts: Some of it is too charred. Upon initial serving, it was just okay. Then I had some pasta on my plate, and then the brussels mixed with some of my pasta, a few minutes passed, I ate some brussels and they were so much tastier! Either the flavor settled or some ragu got on it. Either way - it got tastier.\n\nWe opted to skip dessert and go elsewhere.

I came with some friends from work, and we were prepared to dine in or take out, depending on the availability of a table.  Because the wait was estimated at 20 minutes, we decided to take out.  \n\nI reviewed the menu.  It all looks delicious, and I'm sure it is, but I'm on this new year's resolution diet, so I had to be choosy.  I chose the fisherman's stew.  I asked the lady at the cash register what the difference was between a small and a large.  She indicated that the difference was between a tall pint-sized container filled partway and a tall pint-sized container filled to the top.  I decided to go with a large, because I was hungry and fisherman's stew is generally a low-cal kind of item.  It was $9 vs. $6, and I was feeling well-off.\n\nWell, my food came (it took a bit long, maybe 10 minutes, but heck, the place is brand new) and I was surprised by how light and not soup-like the bag looked.  When I got back to my office, I had a maybe 5\" by 5\" container filled maybe an inch to an inch and a half with soup.\n\nI've gotta say, either they need to reevaluate what they call a \"large\" soup, or they screwed up my order. \n\nAt least the stew was super-duper tasty.

The burrata was very fresh, and reminded me of the real stuff in Italy -- definitely the best I've had in the states since I came back, and like a few others on the menu, the app came in 2 sizes (6 dollars and 12 dollars) -- the smaller size was perfect/generous for one.\n\nAs my main, I went for the polpette which came with pine nuts, sultana raisins, some chard, all in a tomato sugo. Very flavorful, and at 12 dollars not an altogether bad deal.\n\nAlso at the table were the ribollita (looked great, more modern interpretation), a nice beef stew, and a stuffed pasta. All three of us were out the door for 60 dollars with tip, including 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 1 drink.

Let me begin by saying that the atmosphere and ambiance in the restaurant was great. The hostesses were sweet. I would have to say that the sommelier made my evening. She knew we were waiting to get a table and came over to greet us with almonds and a wine list on a ipad. She took the time (even though the restaurant was busy) to discuss wine recommendations with us. I would have to say that the waiter was worst part. He forgot to serve us water and when we asked it took him 30mins to get us some. Oddly he served the people next to us some water right away. When we asked him for dinner recommendations he encouraged us to order dishes that all tasted the same. Lastly, it took him 20 mins to process our bill.", "author": "M W."}

The more casual sister restaurant to Perbacco, this venue is similar in layout and has a very attractive modern interior.  I had accidentally made my Open Table reservation at Perbacco, but the hostess was kind enough to both cancel my reservation next door and accommodate us within a few minutes at a very nice table along the east wall.  \n\nOverall we had a very relaxed and enjoyable experience.  We ordered three creative soft drinks (pomegranate spritz, limonata, and watermelon limonata) and enjoyed all three.  Then we shared the polpette - pork meat balls with raisins and pine nuts and braised chard.  This was a great starter with three large meatballs and the sauce was delicious.  Two of us ordered the Paccheri pasta (rustic pork ragu / parmigiano reggiano) which again was very generous wonderfully prepared.  My friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich (poached chicken / golden raisins / walnuts red onion / celery / rucola).  Again her sandwich was very generous so she ate half and had the rest packaged to go.  \n\nA minor glitch in the otherwise professional and cheerful service was that our coffee/latte order at the end of lunch was delayed due to some problem with the coffee machine.   The server was very apologetic and offered to comp us espresso (just the coffee machine was having problems) but due to time constraints we had to ask for the check to go.  All in all, a great place for a casual business lunch or to catch up with friends.  Not as fancy as Perbacco, but the same high quality ingredients and execution and a lot easier on the wallet as well.  Also, they have a dedicated \"to-go\" menu for workers who need to get back to the office.", "author": "Charles D."}

I think this place has been open for only 5 days. \n\nNice modern remodel (a more casual reincarnation of Perbacco), I would say this is a sit down lunch spot, rather then to go. I decided to get my lunch to go today. So no review on the service yet. \n\nI am eating (as I'm yelping) the Poached chicken breast/dolce latte/apple and chicory salad, served warm on a soft roll. Tasty, original, on the small side considering it was $10.00 - Overpriced in my opinion. The sandwich came with a small side of marinated vegetables - cauliflower, pickles, onion, red bell pepper and carrot,--inedible, too strong on the vinegar. \n\nSandwich to go with can of diet coke and bag of kettle chips - $15.33.

If you don't like fish don't order this because it definitely has a strong fishy taste.  But it was so good with the olive oil.  \nFarro Risotto - Ok, fried risotto stuffed mushroom.  It lacked some flavor. But overall, lightly crusted and light crunchy taste.\nLasagna Bolognese - holy moly.  Yum.  Lots of cheese and different colored presentation.  Visually pleasing to the eye and just as yummy to my tummy.  \nPolpette - These meatballs were perfectly cooked considering their massive size.  Came in a plate of 3 with spinach in a tomato sauce.  The center was also cooked well.\nFlat iron steak tagliata - the steak was sliced in smaller pieces and juicy, warm.  Served on a bed of green leaf veggies.  The large sliced chunks of onion was delicious.\nFried Polenta - Also a little on the bland side.  I swear I was sippin on on a Bellini prior to when the food arrived.  Not sure why most of the food was bland to me.  I guess I could have grabbed the salt and sprinkled some on there.  \n\nService: we had 3 different servers helping us and the final person was kind enough to split the bill into 2 separate receipts.\n\nGreat place, gets packed quick, make reservations.

Excellent service.\nMenu: Great selection and the majority of items looked very tempting.\nFood:\nFried olives with shortribs: They get crazy points just for attempting this. Everything should be stuffed with shortribs and fried.\nFried risotto ball w truffled mozzarella: good but same as you find elsewhere\nMinestra soup: Interesting. Highly seasoned, lotta veggies, lotta pesto. Good thing we shared one bowl because it was too intensely seasoned to have a whole serving yourself.\nSalad of green beans, potato, ricotta: Oh. my. dear. God. How could something this simple taste so amazingly amazing? It was just perfect in every way. Winner of the night.\nBrussels sprouts in duck fat: Not going to waste time describing. You know it's just damn good. Nice vinegary tang also.\nSweet/sour stuffed peppers: Yummy - perhaps a bit overseasoned. Very typically Sicilian flavors.\nFarro risotto with mushrooms: Maybe the most mushroomy dish ever. Super delicious. Large serving too. (Major leftovers. mmmmm.) Top notch.\nLamb Chops Sicilian style: Fine, but nothing special. A bit too much rosemary, a little too salty. You've had better chops elsewhere.\nDesserts: Gelato and an almond cake. Fine but their pastry program isn't going to win any awards.\nWines: Good but like I said, it's hard for me to appreciate some of those old-world varieties so I thought the wines were just so-so.\nValue: Surprisingly good -- two diners stuffed to the gills, 5 glasses of wine, $120 total plus tip.

Adesso is more straightforward, but yes, we need something with more SF style and CA taste to promote the ongoing unification of Italian and NorCal sensibilities. Perhaps this means a daily passeggiata around Lake Merritt in the near future. We'll see. I'm working on it.\n\nAfter realizing that the Union Square scene was hopelessly out of control (mobbed by blue-extremitied midwesterners and haughty Frenchmen), I moved two BART stops east to follow up on this place. At 6:30 I hit the edge of the Saturday crush, and was relegated to the last seat at the bar at the back. Eh, no offense taken--I'd rather watch the staff work, anyway, since the bar crowd seemed well-grouped and unlikely to create a communal experience. \n\nI was immediately impressed by the iPad set up in front of my spot. Wow, it's happened. Interactive menus! Ah, it's just the wine list, but hey, what a cool idea. Sadly, the software was crap and spoiled the experience. It was a bit like a bad website modeled on Windows(tm) wizards, with unintuitive one-way navigation (hint: if you are in the bottle list and want wines by the glass, go \"home\" and start a new search) and not much more info than a large paper \"wine list.\" I would think that a digital volume would sort by flavors, styles, etc., rather than just replicate a wine binder. In the end, I went back to the old standby--asking the server for recommendations based on flavors, textures, and smells.\n\nBut they can still do that.\n\nOnce I turned off the iPad (button at the top), found the paper food menu, and engaged the server, things got good, and maybe even great. The server was cool, knowledgeable, and helpful. I was able to pick out two great selections by the glass, and both delivered. The food selection was just divine. I skipped the cheese courses, secondi, and salume samplers (although they looked great) and selected a first course of ascolane (stuffed fried olives), a second course of mixed bruschetta (sardine, duck pate, and lardo), and a third course of pasta, a tasty paccheri with a mild, fresh pork ragu. The flavors were true upscale Cal-Ital, but light on the Cal, with the necessary freshness not compromising the richness of a traditional cuisine. The bruschetta sampler, at $8 for 3 slices, was an exceptional dish and an exceptional value, blending powerful flavors in large quantities. No mini-crostini here. The pasta dish was just right in volume, balancing richness with a chewy pasta and more tomato texture than you get in some of the Bay Area gastropub sugos (often heavy on pork fat and wine reductions).\n\nThe prices were the real surprise--in both directions.  6oz pours (which looked a lot like standard 5oz pours) often ran in the $12-$16 range, although the wine selection was indeed extraordinary. The food, however, was quite affordable for the quality, with ~$5 snacks, $8 bruschetta samplers, and pastas in the low teens. Even the secondi stayed close to or below $20.  You can really go crazy for under $30 here, counting only the food.", "author": "Matt R."}

If I were to compare Barbacco to Mario Batali's Otto based on price point, Barbacco wins by a long shot for their menu variety and food quality. Within SF, slightly higher priced Italian restaurants Cotogna and SPQR don't deliver more on service or food to justify their higher prices. Barbacco's wine list is also fun to explore.

Even I had read that the Little Ear pasta is bit salty, I still went ahead to order it. The picture looked too good, and when I asked the waiter if it maybe salty, he could convince me that it is inevitable to be a little salty because it is cooked with sausage. The waiter is super nice and attentive. So I thought I should be fine. But the pasta is beyond salty... I almost told the waiter but being shy I did not feel comfortable. Perhaps before, they saw the previous feedback and asked the chefs already, perhaps the chef assumed the sausage is to blame- but, think about it, they really need to change this. I regret I did not just send back the dish, because now I'd hesitate to go again. If I did tell them straight forward, I am sure they would have done something, then I would go very often - they have a super cool decoration and layout, reasonably priced, perfect for many occasions, right in middle of finance district. I really hope they can do something- then I will go again and take same dish.", "author": "Fort Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-23", "description": "There are no happy hour specials at Barbacco, but they don't need any given how reasonably priced their menu and wine offerings are.  I arrived shortly after 7:30pm and was met with a crush of people at the door, clamouring for seating at the dimly lit, modern restaurant.  They took my name, I took a wine menu.  5 minutes later, a tasting portion of Washington red wine in hand, I was perusing the dinner menu.  My dinner date arrived shortly thereafter.  She ordered a glass of wine as well, and thank goodness we both had something to drink because it was at least 50 minutes before we were seated.  That's what you get when you walk in at 7:40pm on a Thursday evening without reservations.\n\nFinally, as the last drop of wine hit our tongues, we were seated.  Foursquare told us \"Mary the Mayor of Barbacco\" was at the restaurant.  Curious, we asked the server if she happened to know who this Mary was.  No clue.  As we were deliberating on what to order, we both couldn't help but look over at the ladies seated to my left.  Whatever they were having looked delicious.  Catching our coy exchange of glances, the friendly blonde seated next to me recommended a few dishes we had to try - grilled asparagus with chanterelles & ricotta salata , the amazing burrata cheese, the duck liver pate with balsamico & onion jam and the fried brussel sprouts.  After exchanging another knowing glance, we turned to the blonde and asked if her name happened to be Mary.  No, it wasn't =)  We never did find out who the Mayor of Barbacco was.  Perhaps another time.\n\nAfter much waffling, we ordered to share the asparagus, 3 bruschette (caponata with spicy ricotta, smoked lonza with marinated tuscan kale, duck liver pate with balsamico & onion jam), quick braised squid and the fried brussel sprouts.\n\nCan I just say we were really impressed??\n\n6 spears of olive-oil brushed, grilled asparagus with glossy black chanterelle mushrooms and crumbled ricotta salata were delivered to our table.  The asparagus were cooked through to perfection so they were juicy and tender without being wilted, slightly smoky and sweet tasting.  The earthiness from the mushrooms and saltiness of the ricotta salata perfectly offset the asparagus.  The brushette were delicious too, though we were slightly disappointed with the smoked lonza.  Lonza is a cured salumi, much like proscuitto in taste.  The lightly dressed kale paired with the lonza was simple, but not spectacular.  Compared to the other bruschette, it was plain vanilla.  The caponata with spicy ricotta was delicious.  Grilled, vinegar-dressed eggplant dressed with a little bit of sweet, rich sundried tomato on which sat a creamy dollop of mildly spicy ricotta cheese.  Delicious!  I also loved the duck liver pate.  The richness of the pate was played up by the balsamico & onion jam, a delightful pairing of sweet, rich and savory.  I'd order that again in a heartbeat.\n\nA platter of fried brussel sprouts was set on the table, succeeded by the quick braised squid.  Can you possibly go wrong with fried brussel sprouts?  Not when you throw in smashed capers, anchovies & a punchy red wine vinaigrette.  Order it.  You won't be disappointed.  Seafood lovers should order the squid.  Four curls of soft squid came nestled in a rich, chunky tomato sauce, with two slices of grilled baguette bread.  I spooned every last bit of the chunky tomato sauce onto the bread, and into my mouth.\n\nA great place to wind down on a weeknight, with a good glass of wine in hand, and to nosh on tasty Italian small plates.

It definitely invites you to relax and hang out with your party. The iPad wine list was an interesting touch, and I think they could probably extend the use of that to even more interesting uses (e.g. pics of the food, where they source ingredients, etc.)\n\n2) Service\n\nThe service was good overall. Polite, accommodating, if a little slow. Considering we ate there pretty early was hoping that they would have been more attentive. However, all in all it was a good experience\n\n3) Food\n\nFood was hit and miss. Some dishes were awesome, while some were very mediocre:\n\n- Bruschette - I had a trio. The cured local anchovy, egg and lemon aioli was so-so. It felt like I was eating anchovy out of a can on egg salad. The asparagus with meyer lemon aioli was great. Very fresh and tasty. The duck liver pate with balsamic onion marmellata was awesome. Great flavours and textures.\n\n- Lasagna Bolognese - pretty average. This could have and should have been more flavourful. Hearty for sure, but if you are going to go for the heavy calories, then getting a good flavour should accompany that.\n\n- Local squid alla piastra - decent and very spicy. \n\n- Braised chicken thighs with olives, escarole and almonds - this was pretty good. Nice flavours, and textures. I wished they would have taken off the chicken skin on the thighs though. I usually love skin, but the texture did not work with it on in the dish.\n\n- Grilled sardine special - this was excellent. Pickled first and then grilled. Simple, clean flavours.\n\nThe wine is available in various sizes which was a great touch. \n\nAll in all, a decent night out at Perbaccos little sibling restaurant (they have separate kitchens but share the pastry/dessert dept).", "author": "Maz S."}

Since it's in the Financial District, it seemed that a lot of young hipster professionals go here after work.

She looked on her iPad to find our reservation, and although we were booked for a table, it was the counter that was available. We decided to wait and see what opened up. \n\nSo we sat: We were stuck on the end of a table. While we were waiting for our waitress the Manager decided to come over and discuss the wine list. My husband knows a lot about wine, and I have learned a lot, so we like wine, however THIS is where the fun begins...\nThe Manager/ pretend Sommelier proceeded to talk to my husband about the wine. This wouldn't have been a problem, except that he completely IGNORED me. Not even eye contact. Not that I am a burn-your-bra kind of feminist, but you don't completely ignore the wife, ESPECIALLY if WE are interested in buying a bottle! My husband picked a bottle, and the manager went on his merry way. He came back and asked JUST my husband if we would like appetizers. He said yes and ordered the Bruschetta. Then he asked my husband if I would like anything. Again, ignoring me. My husband then told him, \"I don't speak for my wife.\" Only THEN did the manager decide I was important enough for him. \n\nSo food: \nAppetizer: Typical tomato basil Bruschetta. I ordered the peach and balsamic vinegar bruschetta. Both were delicious. \n\nDinner: Husband ordered the Flank steak. He said that it was a little chewy but flavorful. I had the Pork ragu, and it was delicious. \n\nDessert: Husband had the Lemon Pannacotta and I had the chocolate gelato. Both delicious. \n\nI would honestly give the food itself at least 4 stars, but with the wait, and the RUDE manager, it brought the rating down. \n\nI would go again, and give it another shot, as the food was flavorful, but the manager needs to understand that this is not a world where men order for women anymore, and in San Francisco no less!", "author": "Genna M."}

As for the taste, the pasta was made fresh with fresh meat sauce, but for some reason it didn't really wow me.  I thought to myself, \"I should've ordered the porcetta,\" but my colleague said it ended up being a little dry and needed a sauce or something.

Also, compared to the closeby restaurant (Perbacco), it's much more informal and casual, which does help. \n\nI do really like some of the choices they have in their selective menu (which is not too comprehensive). In particular, I think the Finocchiona salami in the appetizers menu is really delicious, and probably quite impossible to find anywhere else. All pastas are good, both as for sauce and texture. Again, maybe the small choice is the only real limitation. \n\nThe reason why I don't give more than three stars, despite being very happy with the food, is their wine list. Maybe it's because of the i-pads, but I really find their list EXTREMELY too overpriced. Of course, I expect wine to be overpriced in this kind of place. But the prices they charge are really too mcuh for what you get. I still remember paying $45 bucks for a Sicilian ros\u00e9 wine which was probably worth no more than $5.

My daughter raved about the meatballs and the Bruschetta.  The only one I liked was the Duck Liver Bruschetta. The Sardine was too fishy for me, the Lonza was pretty good. The Buratta Cheese appetizer was tasty but too much salt on the arugula.\n\nWhen the entrees came out,  I had to ask my waitress/server for clean entree plates to replace the smaller dirty appetizer plates.  I thought that was a little strange that she didn't instinctively want to replace them.  Then the Meatball dish was not velvety soft to cut but rather tough to cut and only lukewarm at best! So I had to send it back which the waiter profusely apologized and returned with a new, hotter portion. But by that time we had almost finished eating the Pork Ragu with Pasta entree. I would not get both those entrees together again as they were both tomato-based. The meatballs were good but too spicy for me.  \n\nPerhaps I was hoping for the delightful Perbacco experience I had earlier this year. The Pork Sugo at Perbacco was divine and maybe I was hoping to have as comparable a \"foodie\" experience as that. \n\nOur Barbacco waiter was really attentive and helpful with explanations and suggestions. Dessert was the highlight of the evening. The Peach Sorbetto, Torrone Gelato and Espresso Panna Cotta were all delicious. \n\nI would sooner return to Perbacco than Barbacco.

The food is of excellent quality, the service is great, the ambience of the restaurant is modern/hip, and, to top it all off, the prices are pretty reasonable. Just for reference, Barbacco and Perbacco are sister restaurants right next to each other. But don't make the mistake of going to Michael Mina which is also right next to Parbacco. I made this mistake and got through my first glass of wine before I realized it and experienced extreme sticker shock, as well as some snooty attitude. After the way I was treated at Michael Mina, I was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality when I walked in the door at Barbacco. Despite being extremely busy, I was greeted with a friendly smile and an apology for a possible 30 minute wait. Luckily the manager, noticed a spot at the bar and offered to seat me right away. I definitely felt I was appreciated as a customer. This friendliness continued with the extremely affable bartender who made me feel welcome and offered good suggestions on menu choices. I was dead set on ordering 4 or more courses because everything looked so good. The bartender, though, suggested that 2-3 items would be enough. She was right, and I appreciated her honesty. For my first course I ordered 3 bruschetta (sardine with potatoes and salsa verde, lardo with rosemary, and pear with gorgonzola and honey). The sardine bruschetta was a nice combination of brinyness with tartness, and my favorite of the 3. For my second course I had the pasta with rustic pork ragu. The combination of slow braised/tender pork with tomato sauce was new to me, and highly enjoyable. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly aldente. The portion size was not particularly large, but somehow I was pretty full at the end of the second course. For desert I had a duo of pear cake and butterscotch gelato with chocolate crunch. The pear cake was moist and not overly sweet. It was a good accompaniment to the butterscotch gelato, which was decadently rich and sweet. The gelato was amazing--possible the best I have ever had here in the US or in Italy. Barbacco probably could make a lot of money selling just the gelato.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-23", "description": "Barbacco did a nice job of dinner tonight. Here's my take. \nFood: we had sliced steak with mushrooms and cipollinis, dry rubbed pork ribs with fennel-parsley salad, and. and a side of brussel sprouts, fried with small caper berries and anchovies. The dishes were nicely proportioned and very flavorful.  My favorite delight was actually the brussel sprouts... deliciously hearty, tangy, and salty all at the same time. The ribs were very tender inside, had a nice dry crust outside, and the spice rub was tasty (note for personal preference: this is a dry rib, not sauced).  The steak came rare, as a nod to their authenticity... American medium rare is medium or medium well in Italy. A tiny bit more on the cooking would have broken down the tissues enough for less stringiness, but the meat was tender and had nice grain. Sauce on it was richly flavored and smooth. Overall, food deserved a solid 4/5. The brussel sprouts deserved a 4.5 stars. \nNow, atmosphere: modern and stylish. Not super warm, but not coldly industrial either. They had a nice mix of warm brown tones and metals, and a nice arrangement of a dinner service bar right next to adjoining tables. It's a lively atmosphere. The Yankees and Rangers were showing on the big screen which made for a few points of focus though I often don't like sports on TV during dinner; maybe this is special. \nService: Very friendly hostess and a courteous, efficient waiter. No complaints. Only oddity; they used Ipads as their Wine list... I think to the common technophile this might be kind of cool and hip. I felt it was a bit excessive; something a little in your face about it. I'm weighing the environmental impact of all those Ipads vs printing wine menus... maybe it's a wash... I'm sure they thought about it. Regardless of impact, I have to say it probably helps them order drinks faster. \nSo overall, I thought Barbacco was good and deserves a stop-in. Oh, the bill was quite reasonable too.", "author": "Harry K."}

The waiters were very friendly and helped us order.  At this restaurant, you tend to order a bunch of small appetizers and share it family style.  This way you get to try a variety of their foods and get the most of your buck.\nThe arachini (deep fried risotto ball) was definitely new to me.  It was creamy inside and very interesting.  The salami spread had a very distinct salami taste and smell and was good, but make sure you don't eat it all yourself, it may be a bit heavy.  We also got bruschetta 3 ways.  The duck liver pate w/ balsamic roasted cherry was a bit weird, even though I do love pate.  lonza with peaches was very fresh and the sardines had a nice balance of pungent fish and light vegies.  The fried brussel sprouts were amazing!  We also had paccheri and penne pasta, but they seemed typical to us.  The small finger-foods were the best parts of the meal.\nThe only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is simply because of it's high pricing.", "author": "Calvin T."}

If you decide to sit at the bar, I do recommend sitting closer to the entrance. It seems a bit confined towards the middle of the restaurant. Also, they could have a friendlier host/hostess. I politely asked her to move us from the mid section of the bar and although it only disrupted her for no more than 1 minute, she was clearly annoyed...not a very good first impression of a restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-02", "description": "The hype on this place doesn't match the experience. The food was edible but was very uneven and either void of real flavor or overdone with one taste. I went to dinner with a group of 5, all pretty excited to try this place. We started with 3 types of bruschette. The peperonata/ricotta cheese was extremely bland, just no flavor and we weren't sure if it was supposed to be served warm or cold since the cheese was both, depending on the bite. The fennel/coppa was horribly bitter, I think it might have been missing an ingredient to offset this? Finally, the pear gorgonzola was a crowd pleaser and everyone enjoyed it, this one was a winner. \n\nThen the salads came. I had the radicchio, which looked delicious but the dressing was entirely vinegar and was so tart it hurt your mouth, I barely touched it. A couple of people had the fennel/fuji apple/gorgonzola salad, the fennel really acting as the lettuce, which ended up being an odd taste and one diner said she felt like she was eating rabbit food. Lastly, one diner had the hearts of romaine salad and it was void of any real seasoning/taste. \n\nFinally, the main courses came and these saved the experience. I had the Lasagna bolognese and it was delicious, no complaints on the seasoning here! A fellow diner did comment the presentation looked like a lean cuisine on a white plate, but the taste made up for it. A couple of folks had the orrechiette with fennel sausage (what is up with all the fennel? someone has a fennel obsession at this place!!) and it was tasty, but one diner seemed to have so much kale it was more like a kale bowl with pasta instead of the other way around. She moved a lot of the kale out and overall enjoyed it. Finally, another diner had the mushroom farro risotto, which is a more earthy taste than the usual risotto made with aborio rice. It was a thumbs up but you must like a strong mushroom taste, it's a very earthy dish combined with the farro. \n\nThe atmosphere is so-so. One diner felt like they were in a cafeteria. It's a little cold but if the food was better I wouldn't mind. The service was decent. To sum it up, I'd give the appetizers & salads we had 2 stars, and the main entrees 3-4 stars, for a total rating of 3 stars.", "author": "Kerry T."}

If you're tired of your neighborhood Italian place, go to Barbacco. It's definitely more appealing than Perbacco.\n\nI like the upscale bar feeling. Looks like it would be good to go with four people and sit at one of the tables pushed together. We were at the bar, wedged in with a nice guy who offered me a taste of his brussel sprouts when they arrived. Only at the bar can perfect strangers talk casually about the food they've ordered. In a white tablecloth restaurant, it would just be weird.\n\nThe only downside to the seating was cricks in our neck from trying to look at each other and our waiter. \n\nOur waiter was knowledgeable about wine and suggested we try tastings of what he recommended. The many servers who brought us food were fast and friendly. \n \nThe iPad wine list gimmick is cute, but made me wonder why they don't put the food on the iPad as well and jettison their paper menus entirely.\n\nFood highlights:\nTheir piccante (spicy salumi) is excellent. The cool part is that the meat slicer is right in front of the bar, so you can watch the kitchen staff at work.\n\nThe meatballs were very good with the polenta, which has great texture. \n\nWe particularly enjoyed the brussel sprouts. Get 'em.\n\nThe meatballs themselves seem variable--some reports have them very light, ours were heavy enough to sink a battleship. However, the flavors were great. All pork with golden raisins and pine nuts is hard to beat, then there's the chard in the broth. Yum. \n\nDuck pate crostini was interesting, although I wouldn't get it a second time.\n\nDo not get the Arancini. We shared a couple bites of one and my boyfriend commented, \"Some stores sells these frozen.\" It was overcooked rice with a fried exterior and a glob of cheese in the middle. \n\nI'll go back to Barbacco, but not for awhile.", "author": "Simone E."}

It also helps to know just the basic info on varietals of grapes. Stop being a pussy. You can ask as well. \nThough it's a somewhat casual place and I looked like a lumber jack when I walked in. I didn't feel judged. Everyone else was dressed significantly more appropriate then I was. Dinner here was kinda last minute. \nI found their staff to be very accommodating and resourceful. Food was on point. I even ate something (don't remember) I'm not a big fan on. But I know when it's executed well. And that just so happen to be the case here. \nOur server. A cool blonde haired girl. Was great to bullshit with. Gave us space to eat, but checked up on us enough to where I wasn't annoyed by someone.

Thank goodness for recommendations from our waiter. He picked a perfect wine for me based on my simple description for a white. We ordered a bunch of small dishes; cheeses (each drizzled with its own specially dressing/sauce), salumi with breadsticks, the roasted beet salad (very well made with fine touches of pistacio and fennel), the brussel sprouts (which were a little too crispy and a little too salty), the risotto balls (crispy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside), the broiled calamari (perfectly done!!!), and finishing with the roasted strawberries and gelato (very unique and baked fresh daily!). Everything looked so good, we kept ordering. We will definitely be back soon. \nThe only drawback is that it's slightly noisy in there.

I've eaten in the sister restaurant Perbacco numerous times. I initially thought that the ipad was slick as I assumed you could place your lunch order and drink using it. Why else would it be there? To my surprise, you're just able to browse the drinks menu but you still have to place your order with the server? I thought that was odd, not to mention useless. I ordered the tuna salad and because I'm allergic to olives, I asked to take them out. I got a tuna salad without onions but with loads of olives. I was taking a client to lunch so didn't want to make a big deal out of it so just picked at the salad. If only I could have ordered through the ipad!! To give the restaurant credit, the brussel sprouts are absolutely delicious and the squash bruschetta and the pear bruschetta are really tasty. I wish I'd gotten a couple more. I thought my server was a bit rough around the edges. That typically wouldn't bother me but it was just annoying to come out of there hungry!

We wanted to try out Barbacco because the prices were pretty good, plus we like to be really classy and go eat at fancy places like grown-ups. I was excited because is was busy which I believe is a testament to how good a place is. I loved that they had iPads at the bar, although I was less excited when I found out they serve no real purpose except to tell you about their drinks. I t would have been awesome if you could order with them! Anyways, We had a couple kinds of bruschetta; the pear and Gorgonzola one was to die for, and I ended up recreating shortly after; and a regular tomato and basil one which was also delicious. We ended up ordering focaccia bread (it was $1) and was very disappointed. First of all, it was cheap so I wasn't expecting the best bread ever, but it's an ITALIAN restaurant, focaccia bread should be at least decent. This wasn't. It tasted like a crappy donut from some hole in the wall that only has day old donuts. We complained (and by that I mean my friend went Israeli on their asses, Her words, not mine!) and they took it off our bill. Overall, the food was good but they get dinged for a few things; 1) the crappy focaccia; 2) they were pouring sample glasses of wine on the counter above where we were eating and spilled a couple on our food and us; 3) they kinda forgot about us and our drinks, I understand you're busy, but we did tell you what we wanted and you forgot to punch it in and then you claimed we didn't tell you what we wanted.

Last night we sat at a table (four of us) and it was less great.  Our bruschetta of fresh sardines were very good.  The brussels sprouts were either bathed in an over-reduced balsamic sauce or the salt vat spilled all over them and they were really, really salty (did I mention they were salty?).  One person at the table had the meat balls and similarly, the salt cellar tipped into that dish.  Two of us had the maccharoni with pork ragu, which had no more than one tablespoon of pork in the dish.  Either it was a miniature pig or the pork flew away.  Please, charge me more but if you say pork, be sure I don't have to go on a treasure hunt to find it!  Gelato was good, not great.  Probably my biggest complaint was that they served the wrong dish to people at our table at least twice and also brought out three out of four of the dishes for a course, leaving one person sitting there.

I think if you are a pate lover, I suggest this, however, I felt it was missing something... \n\nNext was the burrata.  This was fabulous.  When thinking about it, had this been mixed with the pate, it would have made the pate much better.  By itself it was very good.  \n\nAngry mussels.  At first I couldn't figure out why angry??  Once I picked up some of the broth I realized, they had a slight kick of spice.  Ahhh, I like spice.  \n\nThen the rotolo.  Mmmmm...  \n\nTo finish, gelato!!!

The fennel salad that accompanied the skate special was delicious, although the skate itself was the only low point, with a mushy texture as if it had been frozen, sadly. The 3 oz tasting pours let us sample several interesting wines from their extensive list. We're not big on ordering desserts, so the thin slices of panforte they offer for a mere $1 were perfect for us. Will definitely be back.", "author": "Karen S."}

The restaurant was lively and nearly full, even on a Monday night. We were sat at a communal table (6 total) near the front. Clean, modern, and casual (compared to Perbacco). Love the iPad for drinks menu, but wish we could've ordered our wine and drinks using it, and had hoped for some helpful descriptions (perfect use for something like this). Server was very helpful and cheerful. Ordered salumi chef selection, aruncini (with shortrib filling), tripe in tomato sauce, brussel sprouts, mushroom risotto, orecchiette, and rustic pork ragu. We loved everything!! Pasta cooked perfectly al dente, tender tripe, and all great, traditional Italian flavors. We will definitely be back for more. The menu has so much to choose from! Plus, the bill averaged out to be only less than $40 per person including wine and tax/tip, which I thought was well worth it.", "author": "Rob L."}

All of her recommendations were great--we ordered the pork ragu, flank steak and the 'egg' dish (almost like a veggie sausage scramble with two over-easy eggs on top....SO DELISH).   We also got a scoop of their chocolate, butterscotch crunch gelatto, which was the perfect finishing touch to our meal.  To top it all off, the prices were VERY reasonable (I'm talking $5-$10 a plate for the majority of the dishes).

Unfortunately we got here right after the first round of people got seated so we had to sit at a communal table with a table of two.  The tables are a bit close together so it was a little tough trying to tune them out.  The food was so good though so once it came out it was well worth it!  We tried the meatballs, the pasta with pork ragu, the porchetta sandwich, the cauliflower, the brussel sprouts and the three bruschetta sampler.  Everything was pretty hearty and good.  Portions were a decent size but you aren't going to leave completely stuffed.  My favorite bruschetta type was the pate.  Loved it!!  My pasta was delish and very similar to the pasta ragu at Perbacco.  Also cauliflower side had bacon or pancetta which really amped up the flavor and the brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had!  Finally, I like how they don't try to push bottled water on you.  It's just not pretentious like that.  Instead they filter both flat and sparkling water in house and give you the choice.  You can get away with spending about $15 here for lunch if you just get an entr\u00e9e which isn't cheap but given that you are in the financial district, is not outrageous by any means.  Solid quick lunch place to have a special meal but make sure to come early.  Obviously it's not as upscale as Perbacco which is also awesome but well worth it for the price point.", "author": "Susan L."}

The most modern aspect were the iPad drink menus, which was a nice touch but since you couldn't actually order your drink on the iPad, it seemed like an excessive accessory. But back to the point, the food was all excellent! We had the potato soup of the day, bruschetta (3 pieces for $8: sardines, roasted pear & gorgonzola, and the roasted pepper & ricotta), the sicilian meatballs and the Farro risotto with mushrooms (the pasta serving were very generous! Enough to share for 2). Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned... and for dessert we got their gelato (made in-house): one scoop for a mere $2 makes it a good option if you want a sweet finish to your meal without over stuffing yourself...they had some tempting flavors ( chocolate-marshmallow, torrone, sorbetto) but we got the caramel-chocolate chunk which was really good (lots of chocolate!)

Most of the plates are little tapas style plates so sharing with 6 other girls you might need to order doubles.  We had the ribs which was okay.  The duck liver was excellent - nice and moussey with some cherries on top.  Good balance.  The pork ragu was good.  We had some kind of salami that didnt come in a tube but was more like a paste you put on bread but was good.  The fried pork cutlet was okay. The spinach lasagna was excellent.

In fair balance, the only item that did not make the \"cut\" with our group was the Nduja housemade spicy calabrian salame, crostini.

It was spinach pasta noodles, but you could barely even see (or taste) the pasta because there was way too much cheese.  I love baked cheese, but this was overwhelming.

The\"farotto\" and the pork ragu were so overcooked that you could have gummed them to death without \"dente\". The pork ribs were over salted and, except for the salt, tasteless. We are Italian and I asked the snooty manager if she was, knowing she wasn't. \"What!\" she said \"I have to be Italian to work here?

The menu is less expensive than Perbacco and the restaurant has a more casual feel which I think it is a great idea during these tough times! First off, the menu is extensive - similar to Perbacco. We had a tough time trying to pick what we wanted to try! We settled on the marinated sardines and a radicchio salad to start. My boyfriend definitely picked a winner with the sardines. I don't even like sardines and thought they were delicious. The salad was your usual salad but I was trying to be good since I chose the meatballs for my main. Now it was my boyfriend's turn to have a bit of food envy. He ordered the pork short ribs which were good, but the meatballs were unbelievably tasty! I normally would not order meatballs, but I had read a very good review on them, so I encourage others to try them too. I doubt you will be disappointed! We also ordered a side of the cauliflower which was good but not the best I have had. SPQR I would say has the best when they have them. We were too full for dessert but had one of their cheeses which was a nice end to the meal. They only serve beer and wine at this restaurant so be prepared if for any reason you are craving a cocktail.
