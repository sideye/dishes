Soooooo happy to see that the Chai Latte is being served in a big mug again instead of a standard juice glass. It makes it \"taste better\" when it's in a giant Pat's mug!\n\nAnd the French Toast - it tastes better than it ever has. More...vanilla-y, perhaps?

I ended up getting the California omelette with an English muffin and fresh berries on the side. They gave you the BEST fruit. I HATE getting slumped on with the fruit when I go to restaurants, always giving me cantaloupe or honey dew melon....  come on people. But, Pat's gives you the top of the line berries : strawberries, blueberries, and half a banana came for my side and I was overjoyed. Okay, moving on to the real stuff. \nI loved my omelette. It was a pretty big portion, not to mention they were not at all modest about the avocado. Most places only give you one to two slivers of an avocado, Pat's gives you over half of an avocado... yes, nearly a whole avocado. I was shook. It was glorious. Inside the omelette is also chicken apple sausage, mushroom, and onion. The chicken apple sausage was absolutely incredible, it gave the plate flavor like no other. I was so please with how the flavors meshed together, and on top of that, I left feeling slightly full but not stuffed, which is a positive. The only down side for me was the onions... they were also not modest about those, but I'm not a big onion fan, and these onion chunks were no joke. \nAll in all, my plate was fantastic. \n\nSERVICE : the woman who was working was extremely kind and servant hearted. She made me feel welcome and wanted. On the other hand, the man who was working made me feel like a bit of a nuisance, a fly on the wall, and someone he just needed to hurry up and serve to get out. \nI was alone, I am not a fussy or petty person, so I'm not sure what it was about me that he didn't like, but it's okay, I suppose. He seemed kind to everyone else... \nThe service wasn't bad, could have been better, but it happens. \n\nATMOSPHERE : they have the door open and the breeze coming in which I loved. It's an old school shop that is just really homey. They have old school jazz / blues playing and the restaurant just has that warmth to it. I liked that about this place, even if you were alone you felt at ease, accompanied. \n\nMy experience at Pat's was great, the food is a bit pricey, but I'm from Omaha so I'm not used to paying $17 for an omelette. But, it was definitely worth it and they didn't try and skimp you on a dime, you get a full portion of food cooked to perfection. I'll be back!", "author": "Linden D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-28", "description": "I thoroughly enjoy Pat's Cafe! I give it 5 stars because Pat herself is always there dining at her table against the wall near the register and she wears this uber cool red vest with matching red star earrings. It's such an honor to have an owner actually assist you to your table, hand you the menus, and actually eats their own establishment's cooking. The fact that I've seen Pat every time I've eaten here speaks volume about her passion for her business. \n\nPat's is a solid choice for breakfast/brunch and the line doesn't get too crazy. I know everyone usually likes to go to Mama's nearby, which don't get me wrong is delicious in itself, but Pat's is also a heavy contender on the North Beach brunch scene! The decor is really cute with local artwork on the walls and plenty of colorful flowers. \n\nThe staff here are so friendly and they're very dilligent about filling your water or your coffee! I had the Polk St. omelette, it's basically a Denver omelette with bacon added. It comes with house potatoes and toast of your choice. Solid choice in my book! I don't think you can really go wrong with anything here as my wandering eyes kept admiring all of the other patron's dishes.", "author": "Connie M."}

It's a tiny restaurant and they maximize space by putting tables and chairs very close to one another. There was a short wait when I arrived but my party was seated within 10 min. It was a bit awkward because the place is small so we were either standing in the way of servers or on top of another table while they were eating. \n\nThe staff was friendly and the food was alright. I had the chicken sausage crepe. I liked it but I wasn't super impressed. It had a very healthy serving of sausage but not very much of the other fixings so I felt like I was just eating bread and meat. \n\nOverall if I'm in the area and needing a place for breakfast I'd likely stop by again and try out a different item on the menu.", "author": "Carlie S."}

The menu was good and you have a lot to choose from. I ordered the Pancake special which unfortunately wasn't as good as I had expected. The pancakes were huge and too fluffy for me even though I'm usually a fan of fluffy american pancakes. The scrambled eggs were a bit of a joke to be honest. Not only did they not have any real flavour but there were not a lot of them and next to the huge pancakes you could have almost missed them completely. The bacon however was really nice. \n\nThe service was good although the waiter had his thumb in my sister's food as he brought it over... I know these things happen but it's not particularly appetising.\nThe decor is really nice and the colours bring the place to life and make for a nice atmosphere.\nThe food was well presented at all so if you wanna take a cool picture of your expensive meal to make your friends jealous than this isn't the place for you. \n\nOverall I have to say that I wouldn't recommend this place. The food is okay, the service is okay, etc etc, but the prices are fairly high and you can find a lot of places that offer much better breakfast and even if you have to queue for a while at least it'll be worth the wait.", "author": "Tom H."}

Greasy, soggy sandwich and undercooked bacon.  \nGrease all over both sides of sandwich -- you'd need about a dozen napkins to get through it. Breakfast potatoes that came with it also undercooked.\n\n2nd visit - Patty melts to go -- SUPER greasy onions, added to the bottom of sandwich, so the whole thing was swimming in a pool of grease, which almost went through the container. Really gross - bf got sick after eating it.  Tried to pick it up the whole sandwich and it fell apart from the grease soaking into the bread - couldn't be eaten.   \n\n3rd visit - Omelet - hard, overcooked eggs.

The food is good, the service is quick, and the prices are reasonable. My son who is a breakfast aficionado, says that the pancakes are a 9.5 out of 10 on his scale. And he has eaten a lot of pancakes! There never seems to be too much of a line, and we were able to eat multiple meals here during our trip. We have tried several different breakfast places, and this one is at the top of the list. Absolutely loved the peanut burtter chocolate chip pancakes!! Service is friendly, and they are always helpful and willing to get you anything that you need. Pat was there on the trips that we made (in her signature red vest), and she does a great job communicating with customers and making everyone feel welcome.

And when my friend and I began to suspect the kitchen had forgotten about our order, we asked the server about it and she said she would go see what's going on. But she was pleasant and made sure everything else was fine.\n\nI ordered the breakfast burrito (choice of meats: ham or chorizo) which was nothing special. It tasted a little too cheesy. But now that I'm thinking about it, I'm sure any other choice from their menu would've made my breakfast experience better. They have a ton of different options, which I wish I would have tried instead. Like the eggs benny, waffles, biscuits and gravy, or the French toast. \n\nOrder took a little too long, especially taking into consideration the few people dining in.

Eggs were flavorful and the bacon was cut thick, so much to like at this little spot. The service was prompt and friendly, a great way to start your day.\n\nHollywood Cafe also has great ratings, but that came with almost an hour wait. Skip that crap and come here, where we were seated in about five minutes. It's worth it. My only complaint is that the space is very small, so prepare to be close to people and a little tight -- we got to (unfortunately) hear the entire conversation of the couple next to us, where a guy was talking about how he read, on his cell phone, about how cell phones are making people dumber.\n\nBreakfast = great.

Mediocre and shitty service.\n\nI assumed it came with salsa, so when my food arrived and it was missing, I asked for some. They charged me.\n\nWas back in town looking at Yelp and saw people rating it nicely, decided to go and realized quick it was a place I'd been. Walked in anyway, a Thursday at 730am, so not a hugely busy time.\n\nSo now my actual review: NOPE- don't come here. My huge party of 2 watched as people that came in after us got drinks and enjoyed placing their order. We just sat there, with our menus to the side to let the sever know we were ready to order. He passed us, he made eye contact and continued to walk, I don't know, maybe he internally laughed at not bringing us water or acknowledging us as customer, who knows?\n\nAnyway, we walked out as the guy behind us got to order right in our ears. Since he came in well after us, that was the last straw. Decided to walk over to mama's on Washington square and that was the right decision! Even with the wait, the staff was so kind and friendly and the food demolished pat's.", "author": "Lacey G."}

I went there today because I was running errands and got really hungry and didn't want to wait inline at my favorite spot, and its been a few yr since the last time I was here I thought I would give it another try...well it was a bad idea. My omelette was watery and tasteless, the potatoes were overly spiced and on top of that they charged me for switching a different type of cheese...it was the most disappointing $20 breakfast I've spent in a long time, Pat seems like a nice lady but her food....not so much.

It was a very simple request to add spinach to my egg benedict knowing that they add spinach to other meats in egg benedicts.  \n\nIt was not a cost issue.  He just said the kitchen will not do substitutes.  I have never encountered this before.  This is a breakfast place which should just be giving people eggs the way the customer wants them.  It is not a 5 star restaurant where you are messing with their recipes.  This was not my first visit to Pats.  I have been there maybe 10 times over the years.

The Bay Area being, in my opinion, San Diego and Orange County's toughest rival on the west coast as far as dining is concerned, I do so with great relish, and Yelp is my guide.  Rolling out bed early on a Saturday morning, hoping to find someplace close by that was original and masterful, the Yelp app guided me from my bedchamber to this place just off of the Cable Car line.\n\nPat's is a hole-in-the-wall, its bright, colorful marquee rendering an otherwise hidden sliver of a restaurant more visible.  At 8:00 AM on a Saturday, the restaurant sat mostly empty, with a few back tables occupied by local couples.  Shortly after I was seated, however, people began filtering in, and within fifteen minutes the room was filled and there was a line.  Though at first apprehensive about my choice, I decided that San Franciscans sleep in, and that the crowd would validate the wisdom of my fellow Yelper's opinions.\n\nAfter taking in the assorted artwork (all for sale) depicting variously ironic interpretations of the Golden Gate coast and its landmark suspension bridge, the time came to look over the menu.  The variety is sufficiently wide so as to appeal to anyone: eggs any style, assorted specialty benedicts including California style (replacing ham with an heirloom tomato and adding avocado), and all manner of delicious (and deliciously sinful sounding) griddle classics... peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes?  That sounds perfect.\n\nIn fact, it's exactly what I went for, along with an apple chicken sausage and a poached egg.  I'll say it now:  the pancake is dessert and ONLY dessert.  I shiver to consider how much starch and sugar was in that thing, and how many days were shaved off my life with each bite, but lord it was worth it.  The pancake's texture was fluffy and subtly sweet, the chocolate melting like a striated braided stream throughout its heavenly interior.  The peanut butter, creamy and melted, added a rich nuttiness that perfectly complemented it, rendering syrup superfluous (as if that wasn't obvious.)  It was basically a peanut butter cookie in grander scale... and would keep my engine running all day long.  The chicken sausage was smokey and savory, and the egg, poached medium, just the perfect amount of loose yolk.  \n\nService throughout was attentive.  The proprietor herself (give you three guesses on her name) made the rounds and personally checked with each guest - a friendly \"good morning\" and \"is there anything I can do to make your meal special?\"  I've yet to experience that in LA.  Very refreshing.\n\nBy the time I left (which took about 30 minutes), the line was stretching out the door.  This place is breakfast nirvana.  All told, I should have probably gone for something a little less dessert-like (the various eggs benedicts looked AMAZING) to offer a more exhaustive opinion, but for the first time in a long while I have absolute faith in a restaurant arising from only a single visit.  And more faith in the power of Yelp than I ever had before.", "author": "Milan B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-23", "description": "How does this place have all these amazing reviews? My breakfast at Pat's was easily the low point of my entire trip to San Francisco. Yelp rarely has false negatives, but sometimes it does have false positives, and this was definitely one of those times.\n\nFirst, in a town with this many options, the menu was singularly uninteresting. Pat's serves ordinary, run-of-the-mill American diner breakfast food. There's no exotic one-of-a-kind vegan options or local fruit sources or house-made granola or coffee from a SF roaster--none of that. So if you're looking for the familiar, this is the place; if you want more of the local flavor, stay away. Apart from the bright paint on the outside, the panache of this place is decidedly average.\n\nThen there's the prices. Yes, Pat's is located on the edge of the touristy waterfront area. Yes, it's near several motels. But there are no deals to be found here. Take what you think mediocre American diner food should cost, double it, and you'll have Pat's pricing structure. If the food had tasted better, I would have been willing to pay even more--but it didn't, and I felt gouged for a very mediocre product.\n\nWhich brings me to the food... I paid $11 for the worst eggs benedict of my life. There was a single, thin strip of ham stretched across both halves of the english muffin, and the whole thing was simply drowned in melted butter. Yes, Hollandaise is supposed to contain butter, but melted butter was the only flavor, and it completely overwhelmed everything else. The cup of coffee was only OK and cost more than Starbucks.\n\nFinally, service was slow, despite having several staff present doing very little.\n\nIn summary, at Pat's you overpay to be underwhelmed. This was the only restaurant I've regretted eating at in San Francisco, and I felt the 4-star Yelp rating had betrayed me. Steer clear.", "author": "David C."}

However, the omelet itself was simply bland on it's own. The chopped chicken apple sausage tasted like regular sausages, the avocado was fresh but it wasn't well spread throughout the omelet, and there was just too much extra onions.. It came with house potatoes and pre-buttered toast of your choice but overall, it wasn't too much to rave about.\n\nFrench Toast Special - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kDpt3-d3IHG4CFbtmKdFPA&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nPossibly the most boring-looking breakfast plate I have ever seen (see picture). Two pork sausages, one egg of your choice, and two \"sourdough bread\" french toasts. Sourdough french toast? It was alright, up until you bit into the crumb of it. The center of the sourdough wasn't dipped with the french toast batter and the end result: it was just like eating only the inner portion of some plain sourdough.

It was a perfect breakfast spot and if I am ever int he mood for a good breakfast, not Mexican breakfast, I am sure to put this on the list to try and know the food is worth it, unless it is a failed attempt to provide mexican food. \n\nTherefore, I have to give this place two stars SOLEY for what I thought was a false advertisement of Chilaquiles.

The coffee came out right away but we waited for over ten minutes before being able to get  the waitress' attention for the cappuccino. She acknowledged it hadn't come out yet, and brought it over about 2 minutes later. This cappuccino was AWFUL - why? Because the milk had gone sour. We flagged over the waitress and she was confused by our statements of the cappuccino being sour and honestly, disgusting, and my request for just a plain coffee.  \n\nThe creamer on the table was room temperature... I don't think it should be difficult to keep half and half in the fridge until your customers order coffee. \n\nThe food was okay - nothing special. I was underwhelmed. We did not see the waitress again. \n\nA waitress, I can only assume it was \"Pat,\" used our table for her extra hands while serving another table. She left some of her tools there after she was done serving and never returned to get them. \n\nWe asked to get the check and waited over 10 minutes (again) only to be provided a bill with  the cappuccino on it. I asked the waitress, who I had to flag down again, to please remove it and she stared at me confused for several long seconds only to remember that the cappuccino had been bad and she had replaced it with a regular black coffee.

We were really disappointed.  My boyfriend got the french toast special, which was served on one really thick (like 3 inches) piece of challah (or maybe it was ciabatta) bread.  It had very little sauce on it, to the point where the middle part was completely unflavored and just raw bread.  Definitely the weakest french toast I've ever seen (including homemade versions).  I ordered the El Ranchero, which was exactly as described.  I don't know why I opted to pay $1.50 to add spinach, in retrospect seems like a ripoff.  The dish was good--just incredibly bland.  The beans were straight from the can, the spinach had no seasoning, etc.  I added lots of salt and pepper to give it something...  \n\nWe wanted to love Pat's but will never go back :(", "author": "Tami S."}

I live a block from Pat's Cafe and every morning I walk by and admire how adorable and quaint the restaurant looks from inside and out.  In addition, I have observed that there always seems to be a crowd- so I kept in mind to give this place a try for breakfast.\n\nWell that day was today, we walked in and it was pretty packed, luckily a nice patron informed us of the protocol and told us to go and write our name down on the list . We did and only waited 5 mins, nice turn around time- give them a star for that one. \n\nAs soon as we were seated, we were greeted with water by the busser. The coffee was meh, I realize most small diners and mom and pop cafes usually serve watery coffee but needless to say it did the job. Service was subpar as well, I get the feeling they bank off of tourist most of the time. Our waiter wasn't all that warm or friendly and kind of rushed us, which was another reason I deducted a star. \n\nI ordered Pats waffle special. I was pretty blown about the portions they serve, they're really small. I saw my plate and my first thought was, \"well, this clearly isn't going to fill me up\"  The waffle was good though and the bacon was well bacon, it's gotta be hard to mess that one up. We asked for toast, which took forever to get and when we finally did get it we got four pieces of non-toasted bread and they charged us $2 for that crap. Which is another reason why I deducted a star, the food was just meh. \n\nJust a real let down.\n\nI am back to re-edit after receiving a \"compliment\" under false pretenses from what it seems like someone who works there, they informed me that I was \"so wrong\" about my experience. Thank you for taking the time to inform a customer that their experience is \"wrong\". In my humble opinion, every one is different and everyone's experience is unique. We all have different standards- some people don't mind mediocre food/service when spending money-- and I'm here to inform you that I am not one of them. If you do work at Pats or just a fan, you really have no right to tell people what is right and wrong.", "author": "Dani A."}

I came here for lunch and ordered the Cubano sandwich. I don't recall the price, but I know it was less than $10. It wasn't the best I've had, the bottom portion of the bun got soggy, but it came with a side salad which was not wilted!\n\nI heard they had tiramisu - my favorite dessert - so I tried it. I thought, \"Well, it seems close enough to North Beach so it should be okay.\" Well, folks, I was wrong. took one bite and knew there was something amiss. Fridge flavor. There was a slight hint of onions. LOVED the presentation, however. In fact the carmelized banana was better than the tiramisu. \n\nMy rationale is: If it is going to go in your mouth, it may as well be worth all the calories. So I told our cheerful server Ashley about the fridge flavor problem and she promptly took it off my bill. \n\nPat's Cafe is a colorful little spot with lots of local photos on the wall from local photographers. It didn't seem to be packed with tourists either, which to me, is a good sign. You have to draw the customers in with your food! I would probably come back here again.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-10-27", "description": "I do not understand how on earth Pat's Cafe has a 4 star rating???\n\nI created a Yelp account just to write a review about this place because I am normally not the one to complain about food or service as I have been in the hospitality business almost all my life and my partner is a chef. So, we are typically pretty understanding when \"things go wrong\"; however, like I said, I wanted to create a Yelp account just for the sole purpose of writing a review about Pat's Cafe.\n\nWe are locals to the area. In fact, we live right around the corner from Pat's. In the beginning, earlier this year, the food and service was great. There was a server there named Greg who was just fabulous and attentive, but he left after seeking greener pastures. He alone made us want to turn Pat's into our favorite breakfast spot. However, as time went on, every time we have come back, our experience has been despicable.\n\nThe last time we went (which will most definitely be our last attempt at continuing to hope that this place will somehow bring back its original charm and deliciousness), it was a pretty slow morning (only a couple tables sat in the whole place). It took a couple minutes for wait staff  to acknowledge us after we walked in; in fact, the owner was on her Ipad ignoring us. We sat ourselves. We ordered breakfast items, eggs,  bacon and home fries, like usual. I ordered coffee, that was served by the owner in a dirty mug. We waited 30 minutes for our food, which normally would not be a big deal..but there was only 4 tables sat  in the whole restaurant. No one even seemed to be concerned that the table behind us was given their food and well on to eating, event though they were sat well after us. So something was definitely wrong here since other tables were eating before us and we just sat there with a dirty coffee mug filled with old tasting coffee. Finally our food came out...freezing cold. The servers were all chatting behind the counter, ignoring everyone. We notified the owner that we were upset, but she just stood there like \"Oh..um..ya..okay\". She had nothing to say that made us want to stay and eat...fail!\n\nThat was just it...we had to walk out. We have given this breakfast place plenty of chances to be a great North Beach breakfast cafe that you do not have to wait two hours in line for, but it failed us once again. I am bummed, super bummed.\n\nI highly advice the owner to reevaluate what is going on. Highly over-priced art on the walls (there is a strange dinosaur picture in the bathroom obviously depicting how the owner views SF customers), slow service, dirty dish ware, cold food that has sat in the serving window or something for too long. It seems like no one cares there. I just had to warn my fellow North Beach residents that this place has disappointed me numerous times and is really not worth it.", "author": "M R."}

The toasts are already buttered and the table has jar of berry preserves.\n\nSalmon Scramble - $10.75 - Scrambled Eggs w/ smoked \"wild\" Salmon, Feta cheese & Fresh Basil.

We finally ordered, and our food was fine. But as a former server, I am well aware that the people cooking the food and the people serving it are two different entities.

The restaurant was very busy with a massive 20 person party, but our waitress seated us quickly. This 20 person party will become an issue later.\n\nThe Plain Ol' Eggs with Bacon was awesome. The eggs were perfectly cooked to order (over easy) and the bacon was nice and floppy, just how I like it. The dish came with a lot of toast, 4 slices. I also tried the Belgian waffle which was really, really good. I'd be tempted to order that next time.\n\nThe only negative comment I have relates to the 20 person party. This place is not big, it's quite small. The large party swamped the entire restaurant and the service took a nose dive when they started ordering. While it is understood that the waitresses and waiters would be a bit overwhelmed with that large of a party, the smaller tables in the restaurant were completely ignored from that point on. I had to go to the front to ask for my check and pay for it there. We never saw our waitress again after she started working the large party. To add to the mess, that party essentially acted like they owned the joint and was clobbering every inch of free space up and out of their chairs. They were a detriment to the overall experience.\n\nOverall, the experience was good. Since I truly believe that the service would have remained high quality if the large party was not present, this place still gets 4 stars.", "author": "Ryan C."}

Coffee toasts with a beloved friend makes eating an even bigger celebration! On Saturday I went for  a casual breakfast after my yoga class with my weekly brunch partner. We walked to Pat's, as it's really close to North Point and both our places. We had been there quite a few times before, so I thought it was time to write about it.\n\nI found out about Pat's on Yelp, as it's away from the Columbus restaurants strip, and hidden just near the cable car station in North Beach. Surprisingly, it's an absolute locals' spot - never saw tourists any time I have been there. It's a neighborhood colorful little shop, no frills. Pat herself usually welcomes us with a big smile, and the whole atmosphere is really friendly and simple. \n\nI have had different things here: omeletes, eggs benedict, pancakes........And I will echo what other reviewers have said: stick to the sweet stuff! The savory is 'ok', not bad, but nothing compared to the pancakes, the French toast or the crepes. They are REALLY awesome!  Me being a big pancake fan, this is one of my favorite places when it comes to pancakes! They have a fabulous spicy pumpkin pancake, a banana and granola pancake and a fresh blueberries one! They are ALL delish!!!\n\nFor the simplicity of the place and the food itself, it always seemed to me more expensive than it should be, especially if you make changes and substitutions, like I always do. \n\nI'm a fan of Pat's, especially her pancakes!

I had the blueberry pancakes and the Popeye omelet.. Every year since that day i make it a point to stop in here just to have those 2 dishes.

After deciding not to wait in the eternal line at Mama's, I did a quick yelp search and discovered Pat's Cafe. The french toast looked great in pictures so we decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did. \n\nWe both ordered the french toast special with real maple syrup, scrambled eggs, and substituted home fries for the meat. When it first arrived, we were both a little skeptical because it looked like something similar to a french bread french toast, which isn't always the best. We were so wrong. The french toast was delicious. Despite being a larger, crusty, fresh bakery bread (ciabatta, as we asked at the end of our meal) it was super moist without being mushy and had a delicious flavor. The fresh fruit I got with it was great as well, a bowl of very fresh cut up banana, blueberries and strawberries. While the scrambled eggs and hash browns were nothing special (potatoes especially.. they could definitely be crispier and more flavorful), I do love their idea of a \"French Toast special\" where you get half the normal amount of french toast with some eggs and potatoes (or meat if you're a meat eater). The biggest dilemma my partner and I have when we go to brunch is we want french toast and eggs and this was definitely the perfect sized combo. \n\nThe service was pretty good, but it did feel like after we got our food our waiter disappeared for a while (though all the staff was very nice). I could have used more coffee and by the time the guy came around and offered it, our meal was almost over but I asked for some decaf instead. He said ok and by 10 minutes later when we were paying the check he had never come back. I didn't bother to ask again because we were done with our food. \n\nThe pancakes looked good too as did the yogurt fruit bowl. It was a big bowl of fruit with a giant scoop of vanilla yogurt on top. Looked delicious. \n\nAll in all, we would definitely go back for more french toast.", "author": "Meghan S."}

The only reason I gave it two stars is because my man likes it and because I think the location, ambience, and service are nice.\n\nAnyway, Tuesday afternoon at Pat's Cafe, I'm having lunch, eating a perfectly delicious meal of roasted vegetable sandwich (eggplant, portabella, zucchini) and garlic-cilantro-lime french fries. Everything is yummy. Nothing I ate raised a red flag. But a couple of hours later, I start to feel somewhat queasy. So I decide not to go for a swim and instead hit the bus a little earlier than usual.\n\nThe instant I get on the bus, I smell steak, which grosses me out further. A few stops later, someone saturated with the olfactory pleasures of cigars and men's cologne sits next to me. When he gets up twenty minutes later, someone else wearing way too much floral perfume takes the seat next to me. I'm more scent-sensitive than a three-months pregnant woman with morning sickness and hotter than a cat in heat. I get off the bus a stop early, thinking I'd rather barf on the sidewalk than inside the bus on myself and others.\n\nI don't puke, but when I get to my apartment, I open all the windows and flop onto the couch. I alternate between too hot and too cold before a friend stops by to say hi. I'm a horrible hostess; the place is a mess because I unwisely decided to put off cleaning it after I returned from Austin, and I can hardly move, talk, or listen. Once I get the dry heaves, I send him on his way.\n\nHeaven knows how long I lie sweating and shaking on the couch before my man (who serendipitously lives two blocks away) sends me a text. I think I respond along the lines of \"PLZ HALP,\" so he brings over some Walgreen's brand stomach-soothing pink liquid. I take some immediately and five minutes later, sweat through my clothes and quite literally lose my lunch as I had been dying to do since about 3 p.m. into the handy red bucket I keep around for such incidents. Every muscle in my body tries to aid me in eliminating the offending fibrous purply-pink stomach contents. I retch until I can retch no more, and then I experience the chills again. Once that's over, I start to think that maybe I'm in the clear. Cue three more cycles of Pepto-fever-vomit-freeze in the next hour and a half or so, and nothing is left in my stomach, so we call my health insurance's 24-hour nurse line. The nice lady asks me what happened and whether I suspect heart attack or stroke and quizzes me on my symptoms. She politely tells me to get to the emergency room or an \"urgent care\" facility. I babble at her about not knowing what an urgent care facility is, but she gives me a reference number to call back with anyway once I've decided on a course of treatment.\n\nAt this point, I honestly think it would be less hassle for everyone if I just die in my apartment than if I try to get to the emergency room, so I just get naked, curl into the fetal position, and sleep fitfully until the next morning.\n\nIt feels like the worst hangover ever. Also, my muscles hurt from clenching while throwing up, and my throat hurts from being the exit point. Naturally I don't go into the office; I sleep for about four more hours, wake up, and do some work from home. I eat a piece of toast and drink some orange juice and water, thinking I am on the upswing. An hour or two later, I crap my pants.\n\nAlthough I am able to shower and get last night's vomit out of my hair, my well-being steadily declines throughout the afternoon. My man is a doll and brings over jello, Gatorade, tea, and saltines. I keep thinking I'm going to have another accident because my intestines are rumbling all night.\n\nToday I have eaten jello, rice, and bean soup, all of which nauseated me and caused my stomach to make more weird noises, but at least I can get out of bed and go out of sight of a toilet. I don't know if I'll ever be back to normal.", "author": "Sarah S."}

The omelet was pretty bad, all of the ingredients weren't mixed in well. The avocado was a huge chunk of it, about 1/3 of an avocado, it wasn't sliced or anything, just chopped off! And the cheese was only on one side of it and nowhere else!! And the coffee wasn't really that good although it was freshly brewed.\n\nOn the flip side, the fruit cup I had instead of the homefries was great! There were sliced bananas, strawberries, blueberries and cantaloupe -- it was delicious!

This is probably the worst breakfast place I have ever been to in the city.  I would take IHOP over it, seriously.\n\nMy friend offered to take me to breakfast and this place was right around the corner from her, so I said sure.  I was hungover, tired and ready to EAT!  I sure as hell didn't get that.  I ordered the French Toast thinking it would come out Dottie's style.  Oh hell no.  It was 2 tiny, repeat TINY pieces of bread.  So I said, OK, I don't need to eat that much anyways.  It was probably one of the worst French Toasts I've had to top it off.  \n\nAlso, the food is totally overpriced and service was not great.  I could have paid the same amount and received twice the portions at Polkers, Red Door or almost anywhere really.  We also waited for what seemed like forever for our food and to get our check we had to wave someone down.\n\nIn conclusion, the only reason this place is still there is because it looks cute from the outside and it's a total TOURIST trap.

I've only eaten breakfast there, so I cannot comment on their other meals, but the breakfast is really outstanding. On a recent trip to S.F., I had their California omelette several times. They use chicken sausage and avocado, and the eggs are very good quality. The potatoes had a good home cooked feel. The coffee was rich. On other occasions, I've gone for the ham for breakfast. A really tasty slice. The service is friendly and efficient. There is a variety of local artwork on the walls. I believe some of it is for sale, some may not be. In general, the decor is attractive.", "author": "Grant L."}

It was close enough that I figured I could make it there before I killed someone in my pre-caffeine morning grog-rage, so I decided to try it out.  \n\nThe decor was cute (despite some crap art on the wall), and they offered a couple of tables outdoors. The server was prompt in bringing us menus and coffee. Mmmm, my caffeine fix...*gag*! The coffee was vile! It tasted like someone had ashed in it. (Yes, as an ex-smoker who likes her drink, I know *exactly* what this tastes like.) Not a good way to start off a meal. It was so undrinkable I considered leaving, but feared for the lives of passersby, so conceded to eating something first. \n\nI was delighted when the plates arrived with a slice of decorative watermelon. The food did not deserve such grace, however. The crepe I had was too sweet for the contents; it tasted like a maple-syrup pancake, clashing with the cheddar, mushrooms, onions, and chicken sausage inside. Perhaps they were trying to capture the imagination of McGriddle fans. The veggies tasted like they'd been resting on the grill all morning: limp, with the flavor all burnt out. The home fries were ridiculously greasy and it was obvious they'd made a few rounds on the grill. In fact, they tasted like you were eating grill-scrapings moreso than potatoes. My companion's French toast combination featured two tiny slices of baguette with the eggs and sausage. It tasted fine, but nothing I couldn't concoct in my own kitchen in thirty seconds or less: there was no spice or additional flavor to contribute to the eggy taste. \n\nService was fine, but the meal was incredibly underwhelming. It's sad when the decorative watermelon slice was the best tasting part of your meal. Another note: they offer free WiFi, but that seems meaningless in the context of their shite coffee. I don't see this place lasting long.", "author": "Mary R."}

Hollandaise had a little tang and was not too thick that it overwhelmed the eggs, crab, or english muffin. Crab cakes were crispy and tasty. English muffin was lightly toasted. It came with delicious home fries and a slice of watermelon. It cost about $13 and was a great deal. Coffee was fresh and strong. I stumbled across the place while taking a detour while walking to Trader Joe's. They're a couple of blocks up from the cable car turn around on Taylor Street -- right where Columbus and Taylor intersect. They are NOT easy to find. The interior is bright, clean, and fun. I think the owner is also an artist and her pleasant photos (and a couple of paintings, I think) line the walls of the cafe. I look forward to returning for a different meal.", "author": "Bubbles L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-12", "description": "Came here for dinner last night after passing by it many times and always thinking how inviting it looks on the outside.  The inside is far bigger than the outside would have you imagine, one of those rectangular spaces.  We ordered the soup of the day, a chicken chowder and the calamari salad.  Both were excellent.  The soup was so tasty and jam-packed with a variety of ingredients.  The salad has such flavorful dressing and the calamari was seared to perfection that it was hard for us to swap the dishes after we've eaten half the portion, as is our usual custom.  We also ordered the grilled vegetable entree and a side of mac and cheese.  No complaints with the man-n-cheese.  But the entree was disappointing.  The vegetables were actually boiled rather than grilled.  The polenta cake that came with it was totally bland and the sauce that was underneath it all did not add anything to the dish.  Overall, a place I wouldn't mind coming back to again, and soon!", "author": "Yvette F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-16", "description": "We first ate breakfast here last year, when I had possibly the best Joe's Special I've ever eaten. A few months ago we moved into the neighborhood (practically across the street from Pat's) and have been back several times for breakfast and dinner. The food has always been good and sometimes excellent, but the service is pretty consistently slow. I don't know if it's the waitstaff or the kitchen, as most of the delay seems to be between ordering and getting the meal; though we've also had to sit and wait quite a while for our check.\nUnfortunately, our last visit several weeks ago really ruined it for us. Pat, the owner, and some friends were celebrating the unveiling of a new sign in front of the restaurant. After they left the man who had been working on the sign had a loud and long disagreement with our waiter. The man stormed in and out of the restaurant several times, slamming the doors to his Jeep, shouting at the waiter, and probably frightening his poor dog which was in the Jeep. At one point he drove off only to return a few minutes later to continue the antics a bit more before leaving again. Our waiter did apologize after the first outburst but it then continued and yes, we waited at the table after our meal for at least ten minutes before the waiter reappeared and we could ask for our check.\nSo: good food, located very conveniently for us, and we probably won't be back. If we wanted a floor show we would have ordered it. Perhaps employees shouldn't drink where they work.", "author": "Steve J."}

We live in the neighborhood, and took some friends there Monday night.  Sadly, it was almost empty.  While breakfast and lunch are waiting lines only, more people need to discover Pat's for dinner or she won't be able to continue being open at night.  We all loved the pork tenderloin, grilled calamari salad, and the garlic cilantro fries are great.  The atmosphere is colorful and really delightful with all the original framed art -- it's like eating in a gallery.  Best of all, it's quiet -- no high-ceilings, music blaring.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-08-10", "description": "I am torn- I really want this place to succeed because it's so close to my apartment, but I have to admit that the comments here are right on. There are a couple of economic factors- note I don't know her rent, or the real flow of business there- that must determine some decisions. The breakfast spots farther down Columbus are worse quality, and in the same price tier. So if you're visiting from elsewhere, and you're not a foodie, then you won't mind. SF has an expensive reputation, etc. It's just not on the price/quality calibre as the rest of the city. Mama's is tough competition, and they have a big following, but luckily the line makes the decision for you. I usually hike a few blocks to Divine for no line, and equally good food. I would suggest to Pat that she stop trying to compete with the tourist stuff on Columbus (near the Cannery) and try to compete with the better fare of upper NoBe. How? Slim down the menu, specialize, create some interesting dishes, de-homey the place a bit ... that really makes it more inviting in my mind. Check out  Ella's, and Divine for some clean, spare, but inviting decor and processes. The tough bit is that the space is very narrow, with little light, and that effects the inviting factor: introduce sidewalk dining (will get the cable car guy sin!) and once you do all this, circulate a flier to neighbors about some birthday deal, or 10% off (Curry House & Fior D'Italia did this). good luck pat.", "author": "Anna B."}

I think after today we probably won't be coming back.  Our waiter come over to our table after about 2 minutes to ask if we were ready to order.  I'm not sure if most of the diners here are speed readers or what, but I hadn't even finished reading the menu yet.  Once we did order, I went with the oatmeal in an attempt to be healthy.  Oatmeal is one of those things that should not be hard to get right.  What arrived was the driest, most flavorless bowl of oatmeal I have ever seen in my whole life.  Blech.  My fiance had a crepe, which he liked okay but thought was not hot enough.  Our friend was the lucky one on this outing and liked his food just fine.  I'm taking away some additional stars for service though.  After he dropped off our dishes, our waiter never returned to our table to ask if everything was okay or if there was anything else he could get us.  After I actually dug into the oatmeal, I was really wanting some butter or water or some sort of moisture.

Not only is it always an out the door wait at Mama's, but you have to order at the counter, and service is minimal. Pat's has very comfortable decor, the service is usually prompt, unless the place is packed, in which case the wait is minimal. Pat's has all the usual breakfast food; a wide selection of omelettes (their specialty), waffles, french toast, a variety of pancakes, but also offers a tantalizing lunch menu; Sandwiches (with vegetarian options), Soups, Salads. The food, in my opinion, is just as good, if not better, than Mama's, but your overall experience at Pat's will be much more personal and cozy than any other breakfast place I've been in the city.
