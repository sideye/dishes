Restaurant is clean and I like the size and vibe, definitely has a sweet \"mom & pops\" feel to it. They could do better on the servings, though. When my friend and I got 2 vegetarian combos, they combined it on one large plate for the both of us and it really wasn't enough to justify the fact that we had paid for 2 meals. The distribution was off too - one of my servings of the combo was lacking the ingredients that my friends had of the same meal. They were, however were very nice about it when I brought that up and gave me extra servings. That made my tummy very happy :) Also, most of the workers aren't fluent in English and sometimes don't understand you but usually, if there is difficulty due to the language barrier, they'll get help and make sure to meet your needs. \nAnother negative experience, which is my last favorite, was that while my friend and I were eating, a server came up to us and offered us more bread. We agreed. When we got our checks it had turned out that they actually charged us for it. This was very off and unprofessional since we were offered the bread and never asked for it ourselves and none of them even once mentioned that it will be of additional charge, as if we had ordered another side of bread. But that may also be due to the fact that most of them can barely speak in English. \nI'd recommend this place because it tastes good, but some tips would be to be careful and make sure you are well understood, if anything is wrong speak up because they're pretty nice and will accommodate you, and if you order more than 1 of the same order, ask for two separate plates instead of one combined plate to make sure you get a fair size of servings.", "author": "Anna A."}

Service is good but a bit slow which its because they do get busy which I'm ok with. 4 star from me. \n\nFlaxseed drink with honey taste like blended peanut butter not to sweet: pretty interesting. The ground beef kitfo cooked medium rare is spicy and good. The chicken tibs is pretty good but I like dark than white. So it does cater for vegetarians and meat eaters. \n\nA lot of people usually get their veggie combo. Oh and the injera is like a sour dough pancake you use to wrap the food to eat with. You use your hand/fingers and injera to eat the food. \n\nThe place is small so get there when they open or when rush hours are over. I see people usually order togo and from delivery company since the place is small. Tables I see is 4 or less but I'm sure you can squeeze the tables or chairs together for bigger parties if they aren't already filled. \n\nFun experience, not everyday kind of food and pretty filling due to the injera.

As I started to walk closer and closer to Tadu I realized that I was entering the Tenderloin since it started becoming progressively more scary as I was walking towards the restaurant.\n\nTadu seemed to be almost at the boundary point of the scariness, so I decided to go anyways even though it definitely crossed my mind to turn back and walk out of the neighborhood for safety reasons. \n\nTadu is an extremely small restaurant, so I suppose I was lucky that I found a small table that was shoved in the corner and could barely fit me. It was definitely packed in the small restaurant, but at least there wasn't a wait when I arrived. \n\nI ordered the vegetarian combo (vegan) which was enough food to be filling without having enough for leftovers. Which I guess is the perfect size especially if you are traveling. It tasted really good and the food itself was 4 stars. The injera tasted a little too sour for my taste, but everything else was definitely tasty.  Environment does matter a ton to me though, so being shoved in the corner in a scary neighborhood is enough to make me not want to return. \n\nAfter I sat down, there started to be a line about 10 minutes later in front of the restaurant and I thought to myself how if there was a line when I arrived I definitely would not have eaten here. \n\nI don't regret eating here last night but am reminded why The Tenderloin is a neighborhood that is best avoided if possible.", "author": "Regina W."}

Service was quick and friendly. My Vegetarian Combination came out in mere minutes. I stopped for a moment to take in the wonderful aromas and then proceeded to inhale the food so fast my stomach started to hurt a little.   \n\nThe combo came with Kik Alicha, Misir Wot, Gomen and Alicha Tikil Gomen and sides of Azifa, buticha and salad. In particular, the Alicha Tikil Gomen (fresh cabbage, potatoes, and carrots cooked with onions, ginger, and tumeric) and Kik Alicha (chickpeas cooked with spicy tumeric, ginger, and garlic) stood out. I was mesmerized by the flavors.  \n \nThe Misir Wot (split lentil sauce made with berbere, onions, ginger, and garlic) was smoky and peppery. I don't think the combo I had came with Azifa (lentils sauteed with onions, jalapeno, ground mustard seeds, and lemon). The buticha (ground chickpeas, peppers, and onions) was delicious. Eating the collard greens (Gomen) made me feel extra healthy.  \n\nI appreciated the hand wipe that was provided after the meal which seems to be customary at Ethiopian restaurants. And I love the Andes chocolates that came with the bill. Some of the customers were speaking to the staff in an Ethiopian language adding to the authenticity of this place.

I was looking forward to it especially, that I seldom get this type of cuisine that consists of vegetables and meats blended in special spices. \n\nWhen looking at their menu it took us awhile to figure out what's best. We had to ask if some of their items are portioned enough for three. Thankfully, their menu has a brief description for each item, which most we're not familiar with. But, in the end we left satisfied and what we ordered was mighty tasty. \n\nWe went for the \"Vegetarian Combination\" ($11.95). Bedded on the bottom is the slightly spongey textured pancake, it tastes like sour bread. Then on the top is the split pea stew, spicy lentils, the tikil gomen its cabbage, potatoes, carrots and right down the middle of the plate is a salad. The vegetarian part alone may sound simple but, it was definitely full of flavor. \n\nI couldn't live without the meat so we added the \"Chicken Tibs\" ($9.95). We opted to have our chicken juicy and they didn't hold back on that, it was really tasty. You can see the tomatoes, and jalape\u00f1os within the sauces. Also, the spice level was medium and it does have a hint of pepper and lime taste. All I can say the tibs was stewed to perfection. \n\nFriendly service here, and I notice our server was one the cooks, nice multitasking from her. To dine inside it's a little tight in space when all tables are occupied, but hey  you can't complain about the cool mom and pop restaurant experience in downtown San Francisco. \n\nLocated in the Tenderloin District, let Tadu spice up your lunch and dinner time.", "author": "Jon B."}

Until now! \n\nAfter a long week of work and travel, I was dead tired but it was Friday night and I was in San Francisco. Gotta live it up, right?! Well, on this particular night, \"living it up\" turned into ordering takeaway Ethiopian food with Yelp food delivery and cozying up in bed. Yes, I ate this messy, fragrant food in the comfort of my hotel room. Quite a different experience than I'm used to, but one for the books.\n\nNow, don't think things didn't get a little crazy. Sure, I wasn't dancing at a club, but my heart rate was jumpin' as I briskly walked through the Tenderloin to find Tadu. I considered turning around and calling an Uber a couple minutes into my journey. Even in the daylight, I probably wouldn't walk through here again by myself. Even if it is 0.3 miles away.\n\nMy food was ready when I arrived. When it comes to Ethiopian food, the veggie options are usually my favorite so I ordered the vegetarian combination. I was also intrigued by their speciality, kifto, spicy raw beef. Yep, as if eating Ethiopian food in bed wasn't weird enough, I added raw beef to the mix. Living life on the edge, I tell ya. To cap it all off, I got a big bag of injera to sop it up. \n\nAll in all, it was pretty darn good! I had never tried kifto before but am a fan of steak tartare which is somewhat similar. I could only have a couple of bites and there's no way I could ever finish a whole platter on my own because it's just too rich (and raw?). Loved the spice and overall flavor though. I basically ordered two entrees for myself and only finished about a third of the food before I was stuffed to the brim.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-25", "description": "I decided to try Tadu Ethiopian Kitchen for dinner a couple of days ago as it had good ratings on Yelp. While going through its menu I was surprised that it did not have a meat combo (chicken, lamb and beef stew) that I generally get in any new Ethiopian restaurant that I try, as it gives you an opportunity to try different dishes from the restaurant in one go. I decided to get the Chicken Tibs ($9.95) which is chicken sauteed with Tadu's special sauces, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos and berbere using the on-line ordering app on Yelp.\n\nA very painful part of this entire experience was reaching Tadu as it is in the heart of the hood (Tenderloin). While walking from FiDi you will cross a couple of homeless colonies spread out on the pavement and have to shoo off at-least a couple of determined panhandlers before you reach the restaurant. The good news is that my order was ready as soon as I reached and I was on my way back via a slightly longer route back that avoided the worst parts of the hood.\n\nI got decent sized container having 3 sections, the largest one of which was filled with the Chicken Tibs, while the other two had some salad and green leafy vegetables. What I liked was they had not tossed the injera on top of the food making it soggy, something that other Ethiopian restaurants are notorious for, but instead had packaged it separately. Like most Ethiopian restaurants in NorCal the injera lacked the intense sour taste that is typical of injera from restaurants in SoCal. The chicken tibs were excellent. They were juicy and had a nice spicy kick. Even the green leafy vegetables were extremely good. Overall this turned out to be a very enjoyable meal. My only complaint was that this came with only one injera bread, which left me wanting a lot more.\n\nPrice wise this particular dish was pretty cheap for Ethiopian restaurant standards. Other items like the beef and lamb tibs were around the $15 mark. If you add another couple of bucks for the second injera you will end up close to the price point of other Ethiopian restaurants, so it's a little bit of smart price management here so as not to price them out of the hood. I'm confident that Tadu is one of the better Ethiopian restaurants that I've been to, even without having had a chance to sample a lot of their dishes at once.

We've tried the tibs, the kitfo, the vegetarian combo, and the minchet abish wot. By far our favorites that we keep coming back for are the vegetarian combo and minchet abish wot. So. Freaking. Good.\n\nOccasionally I'll go through Ethiopian food withdrawal and I'll need to binge-eat this stuff. Actually, who am I kidding? Every time I get food from here I binge eat. It's hard to know exactly when to stop, and when I've reached that stopping point I know it's already too late... injera (sourdough-like sponge bread) EXPANDS in your stomach! My favorite thing to do is to come here after a good long bike ride or exercise, to be famished, and then stuff myself to the brim with a deliciously savory and filling meal here. Always so satisfying. Once I came here two days in a row. Yeah, it's that good.\n\nSharing is probably one of my favorite aspects of Ethiopian food. Everyone becomes very intimate with each other as you share food using your hands from a shared plate. Of course, that's not required if eating with your hands sounds icky, but it's part of the interactive experience of the meal!\n\nTIP: Seating is pretty tight here, so I'd say come with no more than a group of four!", "author": "Joanne Y."}

The vegetarian combination is very filling and reasonably priced.  I kinda of wish there was a meat combo, but instead all the carnivore options were just the meat with injera.  Guess I'll have to come back with a friend next time to justify getting the veggie combo *and* a separate meat dish.\n\nBeef Sambusa: The sambusa itself was very similar to a deep fried empanada.  I suppose many cultures have the concept of wrapping ground meat in dough and then heating it in oil.  However, the red sauce on the side was amazing!  Had a little spicy kick, but not overwhelming.  Full of so much flavor that it really brought these sambusas to the next level. \n\nVegetarian Combination: Loved the variety of 6 different items on one plate.  My favorite was probably the misir wot since I love me some berbere.  The kik alicha was pretty tasty too since chickpeas are a nice hearty pairing to the spongy injera bread.  The gomen was a little bland, but mixing those collard greens with any of the mushier items solved that issue.  The alicha tikil gomen seemed to have a better blend of spices adorning the veggies.  The small amounts of buticha and azifa were a bit intense by themselves, but enhanced the other items when a dab was added.", "author": "Adam B."}

A and I came on a random Monday night when we were craving something different and we hadn't had Ethiopian food in a while. Let's just get this out of the way now: Tadu is in a particular sketchy part of the Tenderloin. I would not be happy had we needed to wait or if it was dark out. Tadu is pretty small (5ish tables) so I can imagine that on the weekend during peak hours, you would need to wait somewhere outside of the restaurant. There aren't a lot of bars or cafes to wait in the direct vicinity so you would need to walk a bit. Luckily, we got in right away and it was still daylight but I don't see myself coming during a period where I may need to wait.\n\nAnyways, A beat me there by a few minutes so he had some time with the menu. Once I arrived, we ordered quickly and decided to split the Vegetarian Combo ($11.95) and Special Kifto ($14.50) which we had rare at the suggestion of the employee. We had our food relatively quickly and proceeded to dig in. Everything was served on a HUGE piece of Injera with a basket of more Injera on the side. The flavoring on each of the dishes was very good and I was happy that none of the Veggie dishes were bland as I have sometimes found in my limited experience with Ethiopian food. The Special Kifto was GREAT and definitely both of our favorites. The rare ground beef kind of scared me a bit but it was delicious. The spiciness was great. We devoured our meal and were pleasantly stuffed.\n\nThe prices were definitely fair for what we got. Next time, I also want to order the Sambussa appetizer which everyone around us ordered and we eyed with envy. I will say that the service was a bit odd. We couldn't figure out if we were supposed to refill our waters or if someone would come by and refill them. We never got any more water even though we asked.

They are very attentive and agnostic to your needs.\n\nOur favorite appetizer here is the Fitfit and close second is Beef sambussa. Fitfit has this surprising tanginess to it that just wakes up your taste buds preparing your tongue for the awesomeness that is yet to be served in the name of main course.\n\nOur go-to main course is the Vegetarian combination and lamb tibs. Veg combo comes with lentils, wat, collard greens and cabbage served on a big-ass injera. And more rolled up slices of injera are served in a basket to keep you going. 3 different kinds of wats are served which have a lil kick to it. I can eat just the lentils with injera all day long. Also try their Ethiopian tea with honey. Perfect compliment to the flavor profile going on in your mouth.\n\nThe spicy hot powder that is served as a side IS. THE. BOMB. Just sprinkle a lil bit on your injera before diving into the dips and you can thank me later!\n\nFun fact: just gotta check mark on the receipt to tip, which makes tipping a no-brainer.

Their spicy hot powder, available by request, is just what you'd need to bring the heat up a notch\n3. Tadu is Vegetarian & Vegan friendly. They know their ingredients so they can advise which dishes will suit those with self imposed dietary restrictions. \n\nI couldn't give Tadu five stars because, for me, the fifth is reserved for restaurants who offer vegan proteins (e.g. TVP, Gardein, Beyond Meat etc.).

First off, yes, the reviews mentioning the unsavoriness of the neighborhood have a bit of a point. I really thought they were exaggerating - it's SF, not Compton, right? - but yeah... it's only 4 blocks from Orpheum Theater, but during that 4 block walk, my wife was catcalled by two different homeless people. \n\nWorth it, though - we have had a lot of Ethiopian food, in a lot of cities, and this is up there. It's not at all fancy, but the food is excellent. We tried: the lamb tibs (great quality lamb, though I did feel it was a little too salty), the michet abish wot (I hadn't had that *specific* wot before, so I can't compare it exactly, but it was one of the best ground beef-based Ethiopian dishes I've had, plus I'm always happier when Ethiopian dishes come with ayib, which, theirs was some of the best in that respect too), and the veggie combo, which was also great. 3 dishes for 4 people pretty much filled us up (though my mom doesn't eat that much, or we probably would've wanted one more). \n\nI want to specifically call out their injera, which I think was the tastiest, most flavorful injera I'd ever had (maybe whatever's in the SF water that makes their sourdough so good?) I also want to call out how fast we got our food after we ordered - normally I expect Ethiopian restaurants to run a bit slowly, but we got our food in like a few minutes, despite how fresh it clearly was. We also asked what \"telba\" was (I haven't seen that before), and were given free samples of it (which was good, as it was totally not what I was expecting, and I would not have enjoyed it - tasty enough, but way too thick to be particularly refreshing), and when my wife ordered a baklava for dessert, instead they gave us one for free. My mom also said the coffee was excellent (I'm not remotely an expert on coffee, so I can't corroborate, but she is, so I trust her.) \n\nHighly recommended. Though yeah, don't come here with a group larger than 4 (even that was a little bit of a stretch), and maybe don't walk here by yourself after dark.", "author": "Adam F."}

I started with the excellent Ethiopian coffee, to which I added ridiculously heavy-seeming cream. We had the vegetarian combo platter and the chicken tibs, which we asked to be brought out together on a big plate with injera underneath & a bountiful basket of rolled injera alongside. There was *so* much food and I thought it was pretty delicious & made for wonderful leftovers.\n\nThe biggest difference I found between Tadu & other Ethiopian/Eritrean food I've had is that it tasted a bit \"fresher\" and less slow-cooked/stewed. I'm not sure if this was a time issue or a stylistic one. Honestly I prefer the long-cooked method where the flavors meld together more and everything softens up, but this was good too. I found it especially noticeable in the gomen (greens) and kik alicha. Also, our alicha tikil gomen ended up being almost entirely cabbage.", "author": "Lisa K."}

The flavors are intense and amazingly different from one of those little piles on the injera to the next. I highly recommend the Vegetarian Combo (on the specials menu) and Lamb or another Tibs. This will serve 3 and probably 4 people.\n\nLamb was ridiculously good, grilled and then mixed with a flavorful sauce of onions and tomatoes and a bit of heat. Even a couple of little bones to suck on. I looked up the dishes on the veggie combo and most are variations of lentils and chickpeas, yet each tasted completely unique.\n\nI have been trying to make injera and had a conversation with the cook about how they make theirs which is excellent. It's mostly teff but does have some wheat flour. There is an imported, gluten-free pure teff injera available but the house made is better and also cheaper.

All this came with Injera which is East African sourdough risen flatbread. We loved almost everything. The vegetarian combo was brilliant in taste - each and every item. Injera was a bit more sour - a little less would have been better. \nInspired by the food, we also ordered Ethiopian coffee and spicy tea. However, perhaps, that's where went overboard with experimenting and failed big time. I won't recommend the beverages but the food is amazing\n\nAmbiance:\nIt's a small place, just enough to sit may be 10-12 people. Perhaps good for takeaways.

I ordered beef sambussa for an appetizer and the vegetable combo with lamb tibs for my entree, which could have served 2-3 people. Wish I could have brought my leftovers back home with me but unfortunately I had to head straight to the airport afterwards for a flight. The beef sambussa came with a spicy sauce and was piping hot and delicious. It was a bit on the greasy side, but extremely yummy. The vegetable combo and lamb tibs was presented on an unfurled piece of injera, which is a spongey sort of flatbread. The first thing I thought of when I looked at it was my slight case of \"trypophobia\" (don't look it up on Google if you're uncomfortable with images of clustered, small holes)...but the subtle taste and texture was amazing. There was also a side of extra rolled up injera for you to eat the wat (Ethiopian stew that has a similar consistency to hummus). I personally LOVED the types of wat I got - they were so flavorful and some of them definitely had a kick to them.  The lamb tibs were also quite yummy and I loved the smokiness to them. \n\nAmbience-wise, the place is quite colorful and cute. It's very small and probably only seats less than 20 people. The food comes out very quickly. One slight detraction to the restaurant is its location in Tenderloin, a neighborhood that slightly gives me the heebie-jeebies as a young woman by myself.

If not, I would have been turned off to Ethiopian cuisine.  The restaurant was a bit in the shady area of San Francisco but well worth the trip. It was dotted with more of the homeless and indignant rather than gangs so I didn't feel unsafe when I went in the late afternoon daylight hours.\n\nFor the restaurant itself; small cafe style with about 6 small tables.  Clean, well kept, homey, and comfortable, nothing fancy.  It looked like about 60% of the business was take out.  Since this was my first experience with Ethiopian food, I didn't have a basis to compare the food with but I can tell you everything was fresh, flavorful, excellently prepared and unexpectedly well presented for a small cafe restaurant in the Tenderloin district. I would describe the food as tasty comfort food that you could easily develop a craving for.  Portions didn't look much when I first got it, me being a \"healthy\" eater but it was more than enough to fill me up.  I think the Injera bread has a lot to do with it.\n\nA family run business and I really appreciate the friendly, caring atmosphere where customers are made to feel as a guest in their \"home\", a lost art with most business nowadays. \n\nMy wife and I had the Sambussa.. Tasty with a mild spicy sauce on the side. Nicely packed, so you actually can taste the stuffing. Lamb Tibs.  Grilled tidbits with onions and spices.  This was really good having a nice seared flavor.   Vegetarian combination.  Great way to try all the different Ethiopian prepared veggies.  Each has it unique flavor, some mild, while others are a bit more spicy.  I like the spicy Misir Wot the best.  I had a small cup of Ethiopian coffee which the owner gave me for free to try We also got a complementary Baklava and Spiced tea (they forgot to give us our Spice tea during our order) (a typical example of how customers are treated as a valued and appreciated \"guest\").

In contrast with competitors in the area, they also add little side dishes that seem to be mixed with dairy (I believe the Azifa & Buticha) that I swear don't taste like lentils or chickpea--difficult to pinpoint what else is in there. Unexpected but interesting.\n\n***REGULAR KITFO - Lean ground beef sauteed with special spices and homemade butter. Served with a side of Ayib (cheese). Spicy & Hot. (served rare of course)\n\nNice & buttery, I approve. I like a little moo with my beef (raw or rare). They seem to serve as tiny bits rather than actual ground beef, which is an interesting & unexpected approach. \n\n***LAMB TIBS - Lamb sauteed with Tadu's special spices, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, and berbere.\n\nI've never really cared for tibs, which are kinda okay but just not as creamy, tender, or flavorful as wot. But they don't have any wot offerings, which is disappointing. \n\n***FIRFIR - LAMB ALICHA BANATU - Small pieces of injera tossed in Tadu's sauces of mild tumeric with lamb. Mild.\n\nQuite nice. This dish highlights why Ethiopian leftovers are always better the second day--the injera gets soft, mushy, and even a bit more fermented, which sounds like it would be gross, but during this process everything becomes super-infused with flavor.", "author": "Elliott D."}

He realized it once we'd left the restaurant, and noted that when he went back to receive it, the staff did not apologize for the inconvenience it caused him. \n\nI agree with other reviewers that the service can be odd (we asked other diners who had ordered if we could have their menu after waiting for a bit and not receiving on) and that the neighborhood isn't the best.

Would I be willing to make my way through the jungle (The Tenderloin) to seek out treasure beyond my wildest dreams? I'm happy to report, this Safari was an adventure well worth the journey past the mumbling crackheads offering oratorial rewards in exchange for their next hit, feces of the dog and human kind littered throughout like pancakes at an IHOP buffet, and just the wretched smell of ..well you get the point.\n\nThe place is tiny. We had a group of 5 and it was a little tight sitting at one table but we made due. The menu is simple enough - there's lunch specials and there's the group share-family style entrees, which is what we did. We decided to do the vegetarian sampler which come in big dollops of various veggies - creamed chickpeas, some collard greens, lentils, etc. and we paired the veggie sampler with an order each of the chicken, lamb, and beef tibs - basically cubes of meat simmered in the house sauce. All of this is served on Injera - a bread that looks like a pancake but it's greyish-purpleish and it was explained to me that it was made out of grain that has been imported from the homeland. There's a sour taste to it and I know it sounds weird but it goes very well with the food.\n\nYou eat with your hands by scooping up food with Injera (there's also extra Injera served besides the one used as the \"plate\") or if you are weak, they can give you a spoon and fork. But that defeats the whole purpose of trying this type of food - it just does not taste the same unless you eat it how it's meant to be eaten. Food was delicious and service was great. I liked everything we had.\n\nThe only qualm I have was that I felt as if the portions were a bit small. For the price we paid, I expected a little more. We were 5 hungry, growing boys, and we all felt a little hungry after we devoured our meal. \n\nAll in all, a great experience and will definitely come back!\n\nPS - don't try to correct me in my reference to the bread. It's Injera. To call it \"Injera Bread\" would be like calling lumpia \"Lumpia roll\" or Chai \"Chai Tea\". Like Madam Miriam Defensor would say - it's a redundancy, student!", "author": "Ray R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-31", "description": "The combination of trying to find a restaurant in walking distance that was open midday on a Sunday and having not had Ethiopian food for ages led me to Tadu. As it's located in the Tenderloin, we walked past the numerous homeless people that are unfortunately so common there. \n\nAfter perusing the menu, the three of us decided to share the Vegetarian Combo, which includes the Kik Alicha (chickpeas), Misir Wot (spicy lentils), Gomen (collard greens), Alicha Tikil Gomen (carrots/potatoes/cabbage), Azifa (lentils), and salad. The star of the combo was the Misir Wot, which had great flavor and a little bit of a kick to it. The other items were pretty typical and not especially interesting (have yet to have them anywhere where I thought they were great).\n\nIn addition to the vegetables, we had the lamb tibs and beef tibs. The lamb had a nice, strong lamb flavor to it. To our dismay, the beef tibs were tasteless. In addition, the two dishes are prepared in exactly the same way, so the contrast in flavors (or lack thereof) was especially noticeable.\n\nPlenty of injera for our meal (they asked if we wanted more, but we were already full). We certainly overordered as we had leftovers.\n\nOverall, this is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. I've decided on the lower rating due to proximity to the homeless--if you are walking around with a child, you feel a bit unsafe. I will say that when we were inside the restaurant, we had no concerns about safety.", "author": "Terence T."}

Incredibly smooth and velvety.\n\nWe only got the veggie dishes this time because those are always good at any Ethiopian place, whereas meat dishes are more often miss than hit (they tend to be dry or chewy, despite the large amount of oil surrounding them), but we'll give one a shot next time.\n\nAlso, their receipts are kind of genius.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-28", "description": "TLDR: flavorful Ethiopian food, large portions, very reasonable prices; definitely recommend for a different dining experience\n\nI've seen Tadu listed as one of the \"Best of Yelp\" Restaurants for many weeks now (maybe since its opening?). I've yet to see a place maintain a 5-star rating for so long and with 100+ reviews, so of course it made my bookmarks list. Honestly, if fellow Yelper Ben K. hadn't suggested it for dinner, I don't know if I would've ever made it here since I don't like to frequent the TL.\n\nThe restaurant is a small hole-in-the wall with maybe 5-6 tables and probably has the capacity for only 15ish people. In contrast to the surrounding TL, the inside is pretty nice and clean. The place wasn't busy yet at around 6pm on a Friday, but it filled up pretty easily and there were people waiting by the time we left.\n\nAnyone unfamiliar with Ethiopian food (like me) might be a little lost with the menu, not because there are too many options, but because everything sounds more or less the same. The menu has a few appetizers and several veggie and meat entrees, which all come with injera, a spongy sourdough crepe. I'd recommend the SAMBUSSAS as a starter and LAMB TIBS as an entree. And you can't go wrong with the VEGETARIAN COMBO, which will give you sampling of almost all the veggie entrees. The food overall was pretty tasty and I really enjoyed anything cooked with berbere (some sort of chili/spice).\n\nFor anyone who hasn't had Ethiopian food, there are no utensils (unless asked for). You basically break off pieces of injera and use it to pick up the meat/veggies or dip it in the more hummus-like veggie dishes.\n\nEntrees range from $10-15 and portion sizes are big and filling, especially with the unlimited injera. One entree can easily feed you for 2 meals, so it's definitely worth the price. Being the fatass that I am sometimes though, I ended up eating much more than I should have..\n\nService is pretty good here. Our server (who I think may have been the owner) checked in on us a few times to ask how the food was and to see if we needed more injera or water.\n\n===========\n\nSAMBUSSA ($4) - 5/5\nComes with 3. Kind of like samosas, but the dough is thinner, airier, flakier and crispier, and the inside is filled with ground beef or lentils. We got the ground beef, which was amazing! A little bit of spice and so much flavor\n\nLAMB TIBS ($14) - 4/5\n[saut\u00e9ed in spices, onions, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, berbere]\nJuicy and delicious! The jalape\u00f1os and berbere give it a good kick, but more heat would've been even better. The dish was on the greasy side for me but tasted so good that the greasiness couldn't stop me from eating more of it\n\nVEGETARIAN COMBINATION ($12) - 4/5\nWe ordered the vegetarian banatu/firfir, but I'm pretty sure they gave us the veggie combo now that I'm looking back at my picture. The vegetarian firfir is supposed to be vegetables and pieces of injera in berbere but we definitely did not get that on our plate. The veggie combo didn't disappoint though and was a really good sampler of many of their veggie entrees\n\n     -MISIR WOT - 4.5/5\n     [split lentil sauce made w/ berbere, onions, ginger, garlic]\n     Orange/red and similar in texture to a thick tomato sauce. A little bit spicy from the berbere, which I loved. Definitely one of my favorite veggie options\n     \n     -ALICHA TIKIL GOMEN - 4.5/5\n     [cabbage, potatoes & carrots]\n     Another favorite from the combo. Not as flavorful as the misir wot but I like that it actually has veggies in it\n\n     -GOMEN - 3.5/5\n     [collard greens]\n     A little bitter but still pretty good\n\n     -KIK ALICHA WOT - 3/5\n     [chickpea cooked w/ spicy tumeric, ginger & garlic]\n     Yellow and a little thicker than hummus in texture. Not bad but didn't impress me\n\n     -BUTICHA - 3/5\n     [ground chickpeas, peppers & onions]\n     Reminded me of a potato salad in taste and mashed potatoes in texture. I actually liked the flavor but it felt pretty rich and heavy so I could only eat a few bites\n\n     -AZIFA - 3/5\n     [lentils sauteed w/ onions, jalapeno, ground mustard seeds & lemon]\n     Served cold. Also kind of rich/heavy\n\nVEGGIE MEDLEY ($10) - 4/5\n[mushrooms stir fried w/ peppers, jalapeno & berbere]\nSolid. Not super special and pretty greasy, but very flavorful\n\nKITFO ($13.50) - 3.5/5\nFlavorful lean ground beef, cooked to a nice medium rare. I liked it a lot at first but wasn't really a fan of the half raw ground texture after a bit\n\nINJERA (complimentary)\nThe entrees are served on a giant piece of injera. I've only had Ethiopian once before and didn't like the injera much because of the acidity, but was pleased with the injera here. Theirs was soft, spongy and tasted like sourdough without being too acidic. I don't really like sourdough in general so I wouldn't eat the injera on its own, but it works well with the entrees and soaks up the juices of the lamb very well", "author": "Jessie L."}

There's only five tables, so plan accordingly. We waited and waited, and thankfully right before they closed they kindly seated us.\n\nWe started off with the vegetarian sambusas (ask for the hot sauce, it spicy and delish). The edges were perfectly crispy, we practically inhaled them.\n\nNext up, the vegetarian combo, beef berebere banatu, firfir, lamb tibs, and shiro wot (so I know this is a lot of food, but leftovers are the best, so whatever).\n\nBf ate the ENTIRE veg combo by himself. Not only is it super flavorful, it's massive (one of those can't stop eating, it's so delicious), and you get enough injera to swaddle a newborn baby elephant in. \n\nThey even brought us a bite each of baklava since we waited outside for an hour for a table. So nice (and so yum).\n\nI absolutely love the beef berebere banatu, and shiro wot. We never come here and not order both of those. \n\nAlso, they have gluten free injera (FROM Ethiopia!!), like no joke. Order this (+$3) and you'll leave without feeling fat, no matter how much you dig in. It's a bit more tart than the regular injera, but so so delicious, absolutely fluffy, and perfectly moist. I never skip it.

He chose the place and I have to say for my first time I sure wasn't disappointed!\n\nI arrived around 7pm and decided to take transportation since the area is not the BEST area in San Francisco. This location is not far from the Civic Center Bart Station.\n\nWhen we entered the place was packed house. Please note: This restaurant is VERY small.\n\nWe were able to get a seat in the back. The owners were very nice making sure we felt comfortable. After we let him know that it was out first time coming to the location he gave us a couple mines to decide on the menu.\n\nAfter looking at the yummy pictures on Yelp we decided on:\n\nAPPETIZER:\n-Beef Sambusa- VERY GOOD!! 5/5 (tasty sauce to go with it)\n\n~INJERA:\nYour meal is not complete without Injera! The spongy, unleavened bread, which acts as a plate beneath a quintet of stews and we used it to transport the delicious food to our mouths. RATED:5/5\n\nMAIN MEAL:\n~Lamb Tibs- saut\u00e9ed lamb leg with deeply caramelized onions and rosemary. RATED: 5/5 Comes with a little spicy taste, but nothing you can't handle.\n\n~Beef Tibs- Very flavorful and good! RATED:5/5\n\nDRINKS:\n~Telba Drink- ground flax seeds in water and sweetened with honey. The taste is not for everyone but I enjoyed it. It tastes like a healthy morning drink but I have to admit that the taste is refreshing and good for you!\n\nEverything was really good and tasty. The owner was able to spend time in teaching us a little history about the drink Telba and states that depending on how Ethiopians were raised the drink can be given on special occasions but some athletic people drink it as well since its good for your digestive system. The drink was given as a sample to use before we actually bought it. \n\nAfter being stuffed from the huge meal that was just presented to us, I had the nerve to ask for something sweet (like the food wasn't enough)\n\nThe owner came out with a plate of Baklava which was the topping to the night! Baklava is a rich, sweet pastry made of layers of filo filled with chopped nuts and sweetened and held together with syrup or honey. Let me just admit that it's SO good and a must try! What made it more special was that the owner said it was on the house! HOW NICE! Complimentary dessert!\n\nAs you can see, this place is GREAT and the food is something that you just have to taste and experience. \n\nI was so full and happy leaving that I couldn't help but plan my next meal to order when I come back!\n\nMy first time trying Ethiopian food was the BEST experience I could ask for!", "author": "Porsche C."}

We came relatively early on a Saturday evening and there was a pretty long line already. We were hoping that the line would move quickly, but given how small their space is, it took longer than the time quoted. Normally I wouldn't mind but the restaurant is in a BAD area; during our wait we saw a drug deal occur two doors down, and we were constantly yelled at or solicited by passerbys. When we finally sat down, I realized how small their actual kitchen was and worried that we might be waiting quite some time for our food. Thankfully orders were placed quickly and food came out relatively regularly and quickly. \n\nWe ordered the sambussas (both veggie and beef), which were very good, along with the vegetarian combination plate and the chicken tibs. I liked that everything was presented on a large injera, so that all of the juices could soak in. The food was very tasty, although not noteworthy. The ambiance (or lack thereof) of the space made it less of an enjoyable experience.  Plus, given the small space and lack of music, you could overhear all of the conversations around us. I'm sure they are running a clean kitchen but the space just felt tired and a bit rundown; I think it really needs a complete interior renovation. I think if we eat here again, it will be take out rather than sit down.", "author": "Regina L."}

But super friendly people that were more than happy to provide some recommendations for us. \n\nWe ordered the lamb and chicken tibs and the veggie sampler. All of it was amazing. It had been forever since I had had Ethiopian, but this was definitely some of the better dishes I've had. The lamb and chicken was super tender and simmered in some amazing sauces - deep and rich with spices on the lamb. My favorite veggie were the collard greens, they were tangy and delish, and not overcooked and wimpy like greens can tend to get.", "author": "Rory J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-26", "description": "Another treasure hunt led me to this compact Ethiopian spot deep in the 'Loin. Again a waft of positive Yelp reviews gave me the courage to gird my loins after dark and find my way to Ellis between Leavenworth and Jones where this cafe resides. Even though it was just past 8PM by the time I arrived, it was nearly full up with diners who didn't look like they were going anywhere soon. Luckily by the time I ordered at the counter, the front table opened up. I asked the woman at the register what she recommended since I was unfamiliar with everything on the menu except kitfo and injera (photo: http://bit.ly/1Dt2tGn). Kitfo is a bit like Hamburger Helper, Ethiopian style, which is not a bad thing but probably more meat-heavy than I had in mind for an entree.\n\nIn the meantime, who wouldn't want to start with an Ethiopian empanada called Sambussa, where you get three large, deep-fried turnover-like creations filled with lentil beans, onions and peppers? A trio for $4 struck me as a good deal, and it was, especially with a huge ramekin of a light marinara-like tomato sauce for dipping (photo: http://bit.ly/1EST1vN). For my entree, I decided on the $12.50 Gomen Besega, a house specialty that takes a huge round of injera, the spongy native bread of Ethiopia, and then covers it with cooked collard greens mixed with bits of minced lamb, garlic and onion. There was a thicker version of the tomato sauce on the side, which I think mixed in mashed lentil beans, as well as a fresh salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1ESSTfG).\n\nOn top of this generous portion came a basket of rolled injera which they served like bottomless mimosas (photo: http://bit.ly/1FwgaE4). By the time I depleted half of it, more injera came out as if it somehow multiplied in the kitchen. No matter since I happen to be a fan, and this one had a less vinegary taste than I've had at other Ethiopian spots. I was full by the time I was halfway through my entree, so I asked for a box which they happily provided. The owner came by to see if I enjoyed the food, and he shared with me his story about being a cabbie who dreamed of opening a place where he could serve his grandmother's recipes. Mission accomplished as the food has a very home-style flavor to it that tempers the exotic aspects of the cuisine. I plan to come back in the daytime when I can more freely walk there.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...home-style Ethiopian with the most flavorful injera in town (sorry Moya!)\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a bit tight in space but the interior is brightly lit and clean\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...quite friendly and accommodating\nTOTAL - 4 stars...if you're in the mood for Ethiopian, this is no Tenderloin trap", "author": "Ed U."}

I've ordered kitfo in like five different countries because, for whatever reason, I just start craving it after a couple days (the best we had in Europe was in London, the worst in Paris -- go figure). I can't really speak to the authenticity of Tadu because I've never stepped foot in Ethiopia or in an Ethiopian home, but this is still by far my favorite place in the Bay Area for kitfo. Get it raw, sprinkle on some extra mitmita if you want even more of a kick, and enjoy. I promise that you won't regret it (unless you order something like three kitfos on top of a tibs and veggie dish for four people -- even I will admit that we went a little overboard). \n\nFor two people, we usually order a kitfo and a veggie combo and it's the perfect amount of food. The lamb tibs are also fantastic if you insist on getting something cooked.

This place opening--and on a mostly dormant block of the Tenderloin where some signs of life are badly needed--finally provides the San Francisco answer to that all-important query.\n\nThe story of this establishment's genesis also couldn't make me happier. Apparently the owner, who previously drove a taxicab, had had as much difficulty as I encountered in finding the answer when his taxicab passengers, learning of his country of origin, would press him for a good place in SF for Ethiopian. Apparently enough people asked that he finally decided he might as well open his own restaurant.\n\nThe results are spot on: The ingredients are fresh, the service is welcoming and attentive but in no way pushy, the prices are amazing, the portions are plentiful--two entrees easily satisfy three people--and last night I assuaged a lingering curiosity by bringing an Ethiopian friend from my French conversation group to give it a try.

I recently moved to the block by this restaurant. Looking for nearby places on Yelp, I was excited by the good reviews. And when I visited, I agreed.\n\nExcept the issues that have finally driven me to write this review were apparent from the first. We ordered two entrees, an appetizer, and an Etheopian beverage that sounded good. Our entrees were served in a timely enough manner and were delicious, but as we started to get full we realized neither our appetizer nor drink had made an appearance. It wasn't at all busy, mind you, but these things happen occasionally, after all. So we asked about them. We had to wait another 15 minutes for the drink, but our appetizer still was never served.\n\nOh, well, it's not as if we needed it. We got to go boxes and considered it part of the tip. But we agreed the service had issues--not only objectively, but also because of the attitudes of the staff, who gave me the impression we weren't actually welcome for no reason I could discern. But we figured it was a fluke.\n\nNext time we ordered pick-up. When we arrived after the time we were notified our order was ready, they hadn't begun making it. We had to wait 20 minutes.\n\nNext time we tried take out. They forgot the side dishes.\n\nNext time we ordered pick-up online. They gave us the wrong meat, then refused to correct the problem.\n\nI wish I could say this place was great, because the food is. Honestly, the fact that I love the food makes it worse, because it makes the feeling of disappointment more acute. But I've gotten to the point that it's just not worth the apathetic service and risk to both my time and money.", "author": "Reese H."}

But don't be deceived by the sketchy surroundings and unassuming decor, the food is great and the staff are so friendly!\n\nOur really nice server recommended that we split the lamb and chicken tibs and veggie platter between three people. He was really patient about explaining the various dishes and that the injera (Ethiopian sourdough bread with the consistency of a spongy crepe) was unlimited! To eat the meal, you rip the bread and use it to pick up various cooked meats and vegetables. It's a really social experience among friends, since everyone is reaching into and eating from the same communal platter. There was a wide variety of spices, textures, and flavors featured on the platter. Everything tasted pretty amazing, and we were very satisfied by the end of the meal. We were even more satisfied to discover that this very filling and enjoyable dinner cost us less than $15 each!\n\nI probably never would have found this place if my friend hadn't insisted on \"Ethiopian food\" for dinner, but I'm glad he did, because the Yelp reviews don't lie -- this place is a hole-in-the-wall treasure!", "author": "Brittany C."}

It's in the heart of the Tenderloin, so be prepared for all the sights (and smells) that entails. \n\nWith that out of the way, the food definitely made it worth the trip! We started with beef sambussas, which were fantastic. The meat had a delightful combination of spices, and the dipping sauce they came with was also spicy and full of flavor.\n\nFor our main course, we had an order of lamb tibs and another of beef tibs, served with injera. This is essentially a platter of heavily spiced meat, served with vegetables and cheese. Injera is the Ethiopian version of a crepe. You get as much as you can eat, and you also pick up the meat with it, as there is no silverware. We both thought the lamb tasted better than the beef (each was cooked in different spices), but both were awesome. \n\nWe finished with Ethiopian coffee. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, and I still thought it was quite good.\n\nOverall, every single thing we ate was delicious.

I like to see who washes and who eats with dirty hands) \n\nI have to say it's been a few months since first discovering this place. We go back once a week to once every two weeks, we've become regulars and it's really nice because they give amazing service and they remember you and sometimes throw in a complementary baklava. \n\nI've tried other places in the Bay Area and they just don't compare to tadu. It's always worth the 10 min commute just to eat some warm, satisfying Ethiopian food made with love! (All the cooks are very sweet) \n\nIt's affordable. Bring a date or your family or work colleague here. They will love it. Just remember to wash your hands!", "author": "Emmy M."}

For example kitfo should be similar to beef tartare but was served well done. Also tibs had spices but no berbere, onions subbed for shallots, and no bell peppers. Nice introduction to ethiopian food just be open minded because the taste will be off if you are used to real ethio food.", "author": "Lillian H."}

I left asking myself why haven't eaten Ethiopian food before? Simply put, this was one of the best meals I've had here and very reasonably priced. \n\nI ordered the lamb tib and a glass of telba. The lamb is cooked perfectly, saut\u00e9ed with onions and grilled jalape\u00f1os on top of injera and just enough spiciness to make you break into a mild sweat. A basket of injera is also provided. It comes with a very flavorful salad and yellow split peas which accompanies the lamb extremely well. The telba reminds me of a Taiwanese roasted peanut and rice drink. It was so good that I was saddened when it appeared I was the only one drinking it when I looked around. \n\nThe place is a little small so large parties may be difficult to accommodate. I do want to add to other tourists that it's in the tenderloin which starts looking like the cast of thunderdome stopped by when it gets dark.  But if you're looking for a great dinner that's reasonably priced, don't miss this place.  I'll certainly be back.", "author": "John Y."}

And we really loved it! \n\nThis is a newly opened restaurant in the Tenderloin (my hood!). It's literally one block from our apt. Love the bright colors and Ethiopian art. It's a very small place. Probably fit 12-16 people. There is a table or two outside also. But service was fast and friendly so prob won't have to wait that much (for lunch anyway, when we went). \n\nI ordered the Tibs with lamb and hubs ordered the vegetarian combo. All served on top of injera bread. I think this was best way to introduce ourselves to the cuisine: one meat and assortment of veggies. So you eat with your hands, and use injera bread to pick up the dishes. A really fun experience and the delicious food made it even better. The food reminded me of various Mediterranean and even Carribean dishes (the sambusa appetizer esp), so yummy.\n\nI think this place will be really popular, if not already. Especially to vegetarians/vegans, they have a lot of options. So glad we live close by because we will be back very soon, and often. Great value also, good prices.", "author": "Vol T."}

Only three people running he restaurant and they were hustling. No one to really man the front of the place but since he place is tiny you can see the entire restaurant and kitchen from the front. Anyhow service is fast and friendly and food comes out quick. So we got a table pretty quickly.  But no one taking names. You just wait until a table opens up and seat yourself. The place is small and bare bones but clean and bright. Somehow seems more legit than the other Ethiopian place we were considering which serves brunch and burgers etc. but maybe that's regular Ethiopian fare too? Anyhow the food was worth waiting and delicious and I miss Ethiopian food very much. Despite being busy the service was friendly and warm and food came out quick hot and delicious. Got the veggie combo and the chicken tibs and ate it all. It was on the spicy side so I guess my punk status when it comes to spice has been solidified. What happened to me? Anyhow the hub almost ate a big old slice of jalape\u00f1o from the tibs bc he thought it was a bell pepper. I saved his life before he bit into it like a good wife. It was plenty of food including he basket of injera that accompanied it. We both resolved to try the one Ethiopian restaurant in Honolulu again even though we were disappointed he first time. Bc tadu reminded us how much we looooooove this cuisine. We decided even more than North Indian food. But since we soft now we ubered it there and back. (Were we ever not soft?)

The place is very colorful and a lot of the clients were Ethiopian. This is good, I tend to take that as an auspicious sign when i see natives eating at an ethnic food place. It confirms authenticity. The music was rocking, too bad I don't understand amharic. Everything was new, clean and well organized.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian combo, and it came with a few cold veggie sides that were amazing and unfortunately like most things on their menu difficult to pronounce. Nice to know that if you aren't a fan of injera you can order their rice (Kinche) or even wheat or sourdough bread instead. You also have the option at a premium to get your injera gluten free. \n\nThe best part about this place is the service, when the waitress wasn't busy catering to the local TL vagabonds wandering in for napkins, she was taking orders/payments, refilling the water, and bread.  Though I declined more injera, she was pretty insistant I take another refill, very sweet. Nothing on that plate disappointed, the injera was cold and a bit dry but other than that the food really hit the spot. I couldn't finish it all and took half of the plate home. It made for a great breakfast the next morning. The  Vegetarian combo cost $13 excluding tip so it isn't something to eat every day. I actually think it is pricier than Moya on 9th street.

If you or anyone in your party does the ordering, you fail. If you work with either an experienced waiter, or better yet the proprietor, tell him what you like, and HE figures out your order for you, you gonna eat a lot of win. Figuring out the best guy to order from can be a little bit of a conversation, but you just smile and roll with it and if the proprietor jumps in ain't nobody gonna be offended.\n\nBoom, there you go.\n\nThe food here is super clean, well prepared, deliciously spiced, served fast (in my experiences), and an extremely good deal. The injera is made from real tef and has that great slightly sour taste. Both the meat and veg options are great here - you can't go wrong. The guy running it is a friendly bloke. Just talk about what kind of food you like and ask him how much he suggests. He'll mix it up and you won't be completely sure what all you're paying for and it will still be a great deal.\n\nThere's a reason this place has only one 1-star and 2-star reviews - either it's because people be crazy, or they're still ironing out a couple service issues. Look when you show up at a popular, small joint, and you're not the first one there, you need to get your patient on.

They give you 3 nice triangles with a nice sauce to go with it (I wish they'd give more sauce, because it was very flavorful, lots of spices). \n\nThe Lamb tibs is very delicious, served over a layer of Injera, with vegetables and tomatoes that give it a nice acidic flavor to the umami lamb. I recommend mixing everything together and use the Injera to grab the mixture, shove it in your mouth and lick your fingers. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR EYES!!! IT IS VERY FUCKING SPICY!!! \nLuckily for you, their sink is right outside their bathroom, so you can quickly wash your hands, blow your nose, and get right back to eating. Umm, on that note, be wary bringing a first time date here. \n\nI highly highly recommend ordering Telba, if you are ordering anything else, Telba is always the perfect compliment! Caleb, the super nice, friendly Ethiopian dude gave me some small sample of Telba and it was like sucking on the tit of Goddess (cause it comes with a straw). It tastes rather creamy with the texture of a basil seed drink and the flavor of a grounded cereal mix. I highly highly recommend ordering it, because it will help cool you down by counteracting the incredibly spicy food.\n\nA couple of warnings: the food is very spicy, so don't touch your face.

You can tell he's all over the place. He didn't give my options for bread, and didn't give myself of people their water. Other people had to walk up to him just to get service. He keeps standing around with the deer in a headlight look. The hygiene here is questionable as I can see their meat grinder sitting next to the sink, and saw them handling credit cards then going straight to peeping food without washing their hands. The people next to me found a piece of METAL in their food! I also never got part of my order. As for the food I did get, it was mediocre at best.", "author": "Wang C."}

No utensils if you wanna do it right. Love the flavors and spices they use, bring back memories of my travel to Africa. Interesting sponge bread made of teff flour (wheat) used to wrap the meat and veggies. The pepper powder is super spicy! Be careful a dash can set you on fire and make you go running for more water.

Yes, it's in a sketchy area of the tenderloin, however the restaurant is part of a movement to make the area safe and taking an uber, taxi or lyft, you can avoid the more questionable surrounding streets.\n\nWe came around 530pm and it was already packedm this is a very small place and the wait for takeout was 20minutes so we figured tables would free up in that time anyway. The owner went out of his way to accommodate both us and the party behind us, adding two extra tables and apologizing profusely for us having waited outside. Food is huge portions and really well spiced. We had the veg platter which I recommend because you taste evrything as well as the lamb tibs. There is a ton of meat, they really dont skimp on it and the flavours are good. We also ordered some samosa like appetizer which was good and came with a sort of chutney sauce. The owner actually comped us the appetizer which was totally unexpected but really nice of him. It looks like a family run business and service was great, water was refilled and unlimited spongy bread to go with our meal. Prices are super reasonable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-02", "description": "Weekday evening - 6PM\n\nAfter having my first Ethiopian food experience a week earlier (and being mildly impressed) at Oasis Cafe over on Divisadero, I thought it would be a good time to compare/contrast with the best around.  Tadu is the highest rated Ethiopian spot in the city, one of the highest overall in the Tenderloin, and I live 10 minutes walk away, so it seemed like a match made in heaven.  I had some trouble finding the place because it's kind of hidden away, so I encourage you to plan routes and save maps before you go, just in case.  Once you find it, and figure out that the door closes automatically behind you (weird slow door, everyone makes the same mistake), you step inside and see only 5-6 tables.  I was trying this place out with fellow Yelper Jessie L., as both of us hadn't had the pleasure of having 5-star Ethiopian food.  It's good we came at 6PM sharp, because when we left at 7, there were 7-8 people waiting outside on the sidewalk.  \n\nOn a recommendation from a friend (who lived in Ethiopia), we ordered the vegetarian firfir, but I believe we got the vegetarian combo instead (I didn't notice this).  We also got the lamb tibs, and the beef sambussas as an appetizer.  Appetizers come out separately, and for the mains you have the choice of individual plates or one large plate for all the entrees.  I recommend getting the traditional large plate!  It's a nice change of pace from everywhere else, it's good for groups, and you get a nice big injera that soaks up the flavor from the food and becomes a different taste in every bite.  One big plus is the extra injera (spongy pancake-y crepe-y thing) with free refills if you need it.  We didn't - 2 main entrees and 1 basket of injera was more than enough, and most of the foods are high in carbs.\n\nThe sambussas were nice - would have liked 4 pieces instead of 3, and maybe cooked a little more (in comparison, Greek spanakopita is similar and is usually browned and crispy on the outer layer - this was just a little bit crispy on the outside and soft inside.  The beef filling was moist and packed a punch of flavor.\n\nThe lamb tibs were cooked well and there was enough for 2 people - here again the flavor was very nice but not overpowering.  I loved mixing the lamb tibs with different parts of the vegetarian combo inside a piece of injera - injera lamb wraps!  Vegetarian combo was a nice variety of what they can make - I only wish we were able to try the firfir.  \n\nOverall I'd say 4 to 4.5 stars.  Value for money was good, and service was good, as you may expect in such small confines.  The flavor was there and portions were more than enough for 2 people (2 entrees + 1 appetizer) - my friend with extensive Ethiopian experience judged it about the same.", "author": "Ben K."}

Chicken dish was not that special, would order something else next time.   \n\nThis place is very very clean, and you can see the entire kitchen from the seating area.", "author": "T Y."}

My husband found Tadu while searching for nearby Ethiopian restaurants where we were staying for the weekend.  (We used to be locals)  The restaurant is in the Tenderloin and you will experience what the Tenderloin has to offer if you go there.  If you're from or live in SF, you'll know what to expect and shouldn't complain about it.  If you're visiting for the first time, expect to smell urine on your way to their restaurant.  It's not something the owners can control.  We sat by the door and every now and then we could get a good smell.  \n\nThe owner was REALLY nice and super sweet and this is why I'm giving them 4 stars.  The food was good, but I have had better Ethiopian.  (they would have gotten 3 stars based on food)  I got the veggie platter.  The collar greens were yummy, but a little too salty for my taste.    The cabbage was really good.  The rest of the platter I thought was okay to eh.  However, my husband really enjoyed the food, can't remember what he got, but he ate a lot of my platter plus his food.  LOL!  The owner made a special meal for my kids.  One kid liked it, the other didn't.  They are pretty picky to my dismay...and no, I do not cater to it!  I blame my husband because he was picky as a child.  :)  The injera (bread) was a bit thicker than I'm used to.  It was also not as sour.  My hands didn't get as messy because it was thicker though.  But, I think I still used a ton of napkins.  LOL!\n\nI would give them a try and I would go back to them if we're staying in the area again.", "author": "Cathy W."}

There are a lot of Ethiopian places around but not in my neck of the woods. I work in the Tenderloin and I am often left to walk far to get something to eat on my lunch. I waited with baited breath for this place to open. I would look at it on my way to work which is literally 2 minutes away. The first thing I had was the sambussa. I live meat so ate the meat ones. My partner ( carnivore that he is) loved the lentil sambussa. It is a flavor party in your mouth! The sauce , the meat, the flaky pastry !!! So good! I always burn my mouth because I can't wait for them to cool down and they are made to order so they come out piping hot! \nI take my coworkers as often as I can because one the place is yummy and two I would hate to loose this gem because people ate too scared to try something new. I ordered the Kitfo and didn't quite tell folks that its essentially raw beef and they just loved it! The chicken tibs are yummy and so is the beef tibs. Now the chickpea salad appetizer is a must get. It was fresh and delicious and we were fighting over the last bit. My usual order is chicken tibs , beef do wat, sambussa , and the salad and the vegetarian platter( I share with my coworkers)  I am going to try the lamb next and I bet it's as good as the rest. My only complaint is that I think they calm the spiciness of down for the wimpy American palates. I will ask for really spicy tibs next time. \nAll in all the flavor is nice , the people who work there are very kind , and I could eat here everyday if budget would allow it! \n\nMmmmmmm I just made myself hungry!

Tadu is a tiny place that you could easily miss due to minimal signage, but missing it would be a crime! The atmosphere is very \"no frills,\" but bright and very clean, including the bathroom (which is often where places like this fall short when it comes to cleanliness). As for the food, I had Regular Kitfo with a side order-size of Kik Alicha Wot. My friend had the Vegetarian Combo. Plenty of spongy injera to eat it all with. Everything was so full of amazing flavors and spices, and we left full and satisfied. The service was very attentive. It was busy when we arrived around 2 pm on a Sunday (the place only has a handful of tables), but by the time we left it had emptied out. I admit I've only had Ethiopian food a few times, and this was the first Ethiopian restaurant I've been in SF, but I see no need to go anywhere else the next time I get a craving. I strongly recommend this place.", "author": "Patrick F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-11", "description": "Absolutely delectable Ethiopian food. Superbly fresh. Perfectly seasoned. Actually addictive for all of the complexity of their spices. \nOver the last 12-15 years, many Ethiopian and Erithrean restaurants have opened in the bay area to our enjoyment. Having found that cuisine so enjoyable I have sampled many of them. \nFor a first time, I eat in to look at service, environment, and for the possibility of returning or simply not consuming if not appetizing. \n\nYes it is on a rather busy Tenderloin block. \nDo not hesitate: in Tadu case, it is a small yet well appointed, spotless, vibrant and colorful space, they welcome you immediately. The kitchen opens directly to the few tables: nothing to hide. \nFriendly and competent cook. \nThe Owner is most friendly, efficient and engaging, makes sure that you are pleased. \n\nMy test dish is The Kitfo for it is an unforgiving dish if made poorly and cheaply for it is the Ethiopian version of a \"Steak Tartare\", was so scrumptious that I keep going back and again.  \nit comes with a beautifully seasoned small side of salad, homemade cheese, and either the cook's choice side of vegetable or yours. While I prefer Kitfo raw, you may choose to have it cooked at various temperatures, and with or without the homemade cheese and jalape\u00f1o mixed in. Most satisfying. \nThe Injera is truly authentic and you can also ask for GLUTEN FREE injera for a small additional cost.\nWhile I have other addresses in Oakland, Tadu in San Francisco has become very quickly my to-go place for a most satisfying and delicious Ethiopian exotic meal for which I call ahead to pick up for either lunch or dinner. \nI have yet to wait more than 10-15minutes. Shiro Kik Alicha, Gomen, all delish.\nMy 12 years kid also looks forward to their dishes. \nYes, you guessed it: we Highly Recommend Tadu", "author": "Claire B."}

We waited about 10 minutes. It's small and cozy. I realized I ordered the wrong thing and I tried to change my order just before it was served. Guess what? The proprietor was so wonderful and accommodating he changed it even though my order was almost up. I've had Ethiopian food many times before, starting in NYC in the 80s. My husband and I met at Massawa in the Haight back in 1993. We've been to almost every Ethiopian restaurant in SF and the east bay. My kids love Ethiopian and we have it at least once a month. This is my new favorite place. The food was excellent we oohed and aaahed with every bite. I can't say enough about this place, it's perfect.", "author": "Sunny S."}

After spontaneously looking for a place to eat lunch, my friends and I noticed this place we were eager to try it out. The place is small, but cozy (nice to escape the cold SF weather). The gentleman at the front was very welcoming and friendly. He helped us out by recommending tibs, so we ordered chicken, beef, and lamb tibs all with injera. The first three plates came out before 10 minutes and he noticed that the fourth hadn't come out yet. To our surprise, he brought out complimentary sambussa to compensate for the wait. It was a kind gesture and delicious too! Within minutes, the fourth plate came out and we began digging in. The meat was so well-seasoned and cooked that we all fell in love. The salad and dressing that came with it gave it so much flavor and refreshed our palate. In that moment, we knew we made the right choice coming here.", "author": "Jenny N."}

Finally, I've found a place that can compete with Ensarro! Tadu's kitfo was perfectly spiced, tender, and disappeared from our plate almost instantly as a result; the veggie combo was also spot on all around, with some of the most flavorful kik alicha I've ever had (it can often be quite bland; this was most definitely not). The meser wot was also very good, a tad spicy, but still lovely. The traditional gluten-free tej injera our meal was served on was a little hard from having been refrigerated, for which I deduct one star, but the side basket of injera that we were served for dipping was fresh, warm, and delicious: not at all tough (unlike some traditional injeras made without wheat flour that I've had at other places ).

They don't serve any alcohol, but it's BYOB - which we learned after the fact. Ordered a ton of food including the chicken, beef and lamb tibs all of which were solid - the chicken was the spiciest of the lot w/o question. Also got the gluten free injera as we were told that is the traditional method of preparation i.e with teff flour only versus any wheat flour added. Also ordered a couple of veggie dishes including one of the lentil based items - I don't recall as I didn't eat much of the veggies on the plate. It's straight up family style to share, eat with your hands and have a good time. The place probably doesn't seat more than 15-20 people at a time but we were fortunate to have a 3 seater spot available for us when we walked in.
