Our server was really attentive and came by frequently to check on us.  AYCE and AYCD + tip and tax came out to $50/pp.  Although there is a time limit, it wasn't too strongly enforced...maybe because it was close to closing and a slower night.  \n\nOverall a fantastic experience.

We made a reservation for 4 on a Saturday night at 7 but wound up coming an hour early and were seated right away. We had the miso broth for my hubby and me and my parents shared the clear broth.

Despite the renovation, I still feel like it's lagging behind in the \"hot pot industry.\" Sure you got your sauce bar, but let's face it, everybody wants their own pot nowadays. This place still does the pot for sharing and irritatingly charges an extra $1 per person for doing a split pot or getting more than one broth. \n\nThe one main thing that irked me about this place was having one of the workers tell me how to hot pot. I AIN'T A NOVICE. I got in \"trouble\" for putting too much spinach in my pot. Like seriously? Spinach wilts and significantly downsizes when cooked. They also turned down the heat at our table as if I weren't capable of gauging the boiling mechanism of the pot. \n\nAnyway, here's a run down of the place:\n- TRY THE HOT POT SALTED EGG (it's house made!)\n- no individual pots, extra $1 per person if split pot\n- large portions, large selection of food\n- DIY sauce bar", "author": "Christene M."}

Our party of six were seated at a long table with two pots so we were able to choose 4 soup bases.

Besides the AYCE there us a $13 all you can drink option. \n\nService was good even with the full house. Street parking only and could be a problem especially with the road construction going on.

The server gave us the ordering sheet and left us to select our broths and food. We picked the intestine soup, sour fish soup and the pork bone soup. All were tasty in different ways. The intestines soup was super peppery, a little over powering on it's own. As we cooked the meats and seafood in it, it was fine. The pork bone soup was a little bland in the beginning, but was great after cooking all the meats in it. The American Kobe was well marbled, better than most other Chinese hot pot places.

That ain't happening here!  This amazing gem in the Avenues is essentially all-you-can-eat hot pot with a HUGE list of add-ins to order from.  They mention a 90-minute time limit, but they didn't seem to enforce it on a slow weeknight.  They also offer unlimited beer/sake, but I opted for the unlimited soda since I wasn't looking to rage during hot pot.  Order a lot in your first go since they seem a little hit-or-miss with taking subsequent orders; though they were always fast to give use more beef slices in particular.\n\nMy favorite meats were the thinly sliced beef and thinly slice lamb.  Quick cooking, great texture and great taste.  I ordered the marinated lamb too; the portion was large but the cut didn't seem as good as the un-marinated version.  Thanks to an introduction by regulars, I really got to love the shrimp paste.  It's basically ground shrimp (and maybe a little other fish for binding?) that you scoop into balls in the soup; tastes like an amazing shrimp dumpling without all the pesky dough wrapping.  Wasn't a fan of the regular shrimp because they came with full head and shell, causing a lot of wasted time unpeeling before you get a bite of two of the good stuff.  The various fish balls were kinda bleh and the \"lobster\" ball tasted nothing like lobster.\n\nAlso of note, I really like the fried tofu and fried tofu skin.  Both did an amazing job of soaking up the spicy broth and giving you quite a zing (compared to how the spices don't really stick tot he meat).  The fried tofu was nice and spongy.  The fried tofu skin starts off crispy but a few seconds in the broth turns into something silky and delicious.\n\nThe egg yolk dumpling is also notable.  Tastes like an egg custard tart inside of a light dumpling skins; gets that fun lava texture after a little time in the soup.  \n\nTons of veggies and noodles too.  They're pretty much as expected, so it's really a matter of what your personal taste is.  We saved the noodles for last and weren't that into them after gorging on all the meat and seafood.  So there could be a strong case for going carb-less to maximize on the good stuff.", "author": "Adam B."}

A friend recommended this place for AYCE hot pot, and I came with a group of 10 for a Chinese New Year dinner. \n\nThey give you a menu, and you can check off as many ingredients + apps that you want. I honestly don't know how they profit, because there is no limit to how much you can order, or any penalty for unfinished food (like some other Asian restaurants have). The sesame balls, fried dumplings, and chinese donuts with condensed milk, and surprisingly, the curly fries, are terrific to start off with. I love the variety of veggies (recommend the bok choy, a choy, and spinach) as well as the meats. I couldn't tell a difference in quality between the lamb/beef here vs other places. My favorite are the different types of fish balls, as well as the fried tofu skins. \n\nPerhaps it was because we came on a busy night, but I felt like there were a few things from our menu that they had forgotten. We ordered green onion pancakes twice, and they never came out. I mean, we had such a disgusting amount of food that it didn't really matter, but some consistency would definitely be nice. \n\nIt's $27.99/person, and $13 for all-you-can-drink sake. If you come with enough people, I'd say that it's totally worth it. I pay around the same amount for when I go to Little Sheep.\n\nTIP: Call and make reservations!

AYCE is normally $29, but we were able to use the back-to-school special to reduce our cost to $24/person. Overall, the food we ordered tasted fresh, save a few exceptions, such as the mussels and wood's ear mushrooms. On the up side, the broth was extremely flavorful, service was pretty responsive (constantly checking to make sure we had enough broth in our pot), and dishes came out fairly quickly. On the downside, we had to call back a waiter several times, because we had some dishes that just never came out of the kitchen (like our rice and A choy).

Unfortunately I didn't get the name of our server, but she was just exceptional. She showed us to the sauce station and she was kind enough to answer all of our questions and follow through with all of our requests. \n\nI really felt like this place has a HUGE variety. Not only were there many broth choices to choose from, but there were food options to fit anyone's cravings. We decided to go with the sake broth and the miso broth, however we weren't too big of fans of the sake broth, as it really brought out a bitter flavor. We ended up just using the miso broth side for all of our cooking. \n\nFor meats we ordered the lamb slices, the beef tongue, beef slices in wine, and beef tripe. All the meats were thinly slices & very fresh. \n\nFor the veggies we had the baby corn, spinach, enoki mushrooms, deep fried tofu, and seaweed. \n\nA bonus is that this place has homemade dumplings which are quite delicious. We tried a really big variety and they were all super tasty. Another one of my favorite items was the crispy tofu skin. This was something very different than I was used to tasting, but it turned out to be amazing, especially when dipped with some ponzu sauce. \n\nThe meat portions were very generous, so it's good enough to order 4-6 plates when starting out. In addition, there are a few precooked appetizers, such as curly fries and potstickers which are very good to start with if coming here extra hungry. \n\nThe overall experience at this restaurant was 100%. Not only did I enjoy everything that I tried, but the service was top notch. There was never a longer wait time than 5 minutes.

The server was dead wrong - we waited around 40 minutes before getting seated. When we did get seated and ordered our food, we realized the servers don't bring out everything you order, so we had to check with the servers often to make sure they brought everything out.\n\nPro tip: If you didn't get all of your food within 20 minutes of ordering, order again because the servers probably forgot to bring them out. Also, you can buy the dim sum items separately frozen; they hired a dim sum chef from Hong Kong and make them all in-house.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

Most of the food were good, i.e., proteins were good, snack/desserts were average, cucumber salad not as tasty. Only half of the wait staff were able to communicate in English, which made ordering very frustrating.  The entire ordering process was confusing and disorganized.  Our large party had three burners, so each burner was given a menu.  We ordered different broth and food for each burner, but to our surprise all the food were consolidated between two trays, so all of us had to resort to yelling up and down the table...who ordered this or that. By the time we sorted this out, we couldn't remember what we ordered vs what we received. We were missing several items that we ordered. We filled out another menu, yelled back/forth and didn't receive the complete order again.  Since we only have 90 mins from the time we seated to order otherwise be charged, we finally just told the English speaking waiter what food items we wanted. Why make us fill out the menus if we're never going to get the items we ordered?  To minimize the confusion and disorganization, each party should have one designated wait staff to offer direction (esp for first time diners), to make sure parties receive what they actually ordered and for better customer service all around. Probably better suited for parties with only one burner.", "author": "Alice C."}

The meats and veggies are also all really fresh.\n\nOur waiter also recommended we try the salty egg yolk bun which was probably my favorite of the \"buns\" on the menu (they're actually more like glutinous rice ball). It had a sweet and salty egg-yolk filling similar to fillings you can find in Asian pastries. All the \"buns\" have a sweet filling so at first I thought it was kinda weird to cook them in the hot pot broth, but the buns taste so good I didn't mind too much after a while haha \n\nThe atmosphere here is clean, bright, and casual, and although the waiters can get pretty busy they defs get the job done.

They have so many items, everything from plain and marinated meats (lamb, pork, beef, seafood) to seafood (tilapia, shrimp), and veggies. They also have a wide variety of noodles and dumplings. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp paste or Shanghai Pork Dumpling (XLB). That kind of dumpling is not meant for hot pot. Come with a group so you can order everything! The portion size of each order is pretty big. You are guaranteed to get food coma.\n\nOne negative is that they don't have many sauces. The hot pot restaurants back home in MD and VA have a full sauce bar allowing you to make your own tasty concoctions. I guess they make up for that with their many soup options. If you get more than one soup base, it's an additional $1 per person. Definitely worth it! We went with the Pork Bone and Spicy Miso.", "author": "Priscilla Y."}

We told them about it and they tried to give us some free drinks to compensate for it and gave us 10% off the bill, but still slapped gratuity on our bill. Okay. You serve us dirty food and still give us a mandatory 18% tip? It wasn't just the bok choy that was dirty either. A lot of the vegetables had either dirt or bugs on them. We forgot to take a picture of some of the stuff before we told them about how gross it was, but I found some more dirty vegetables later that I did take a picture of. \n\nI know some Asian restaurants aren't the cleanest (I've worked in the industry before), but at least properly wash and check your vegetables.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-22", "description": "I live around the block from this place and was pretty bummed when they closed down for renovations a few months ago.\n\nHowever, after they reopened, I think the place looks even better than before.  The ambiance is surprisingly chic for a hot pot place with fine lighting and new floors.  They installed a bunch of high end TVs everywhere and set up benched seating to accommodate more people.  In addition, their menu is even larger than before, with more meats and dishes available, as well as 5+ (if I recall) types of broths.  I also appreciate that they've got a personal sauce station in the middle of the restaurant where you can prepare your own dipping sauces.  The area is quite large, but I can imagine it'd be a fairly crowded area once more people are inside.\n\nThe service is quite expedient and efficient.  Since it's all-you-can-eat hot pot, the servers were very attentive, keeping an eye out for our table so we didn't need to stare or wave at them to flag them down.  The food came rather quickly and in bunches so we were rarely lacking for food (a very good thing for this sort of venue).\n\nWhat sets this place apart from most hot pot places, other than the wide selection on their menu, is that their \"dessert\" dumplings.  I would come for just those alone, and I save room (if you can call it that) for them specifically.  They're basically the insides of the Chinese buns (sweet egg paste, red bean/lotus paste, custard, and taro) with a wrapper that keeps it compact as you soak it in the broth.  A fantastic way to end the night if you've got a dessert stomach.  \n\nI'd also recommend their herbal tea (new, I think), which tastes like a saccharine, iced version of a grass jelly drink; I think we refilled our pitcher over half a dozen times.  We also made our money's worth on kobe beef too.  I personally avoid cabbage and rice as fillers, but I did order things like sesame balls and onion pancakes, which rival those of high-end Chinese restaurants in quality.  One last bit of advice is to start slow and don't order things en masse unless you know exactly what you want.  The service is good enough that you can ask them for paper menus and expect your food orders within 5-10 min while you're cooking or eating.\n\nParking is usually not too bad, and the N Judah streetcar stops about a block away.\nObviously, it's not cheap, at about $27 min per person, but if you're celebrating something (they take reservations and have special seating for large parties) or want to impress a date, I'd certainly recommend the Pot's.", "author": "Matthew W."}

There is only 4 small plates of which you can make your own sauce. Basically soy sauce and some peanuts and chives. Disappointed by the sauce. The lamb here is better than the lamb at ipot but beef is way better at Ipot. I like that you can order dimsum at ipot but unfortunately you cannot here. I came here as my friend said it was the best place in SF. With some doubt I came here to try it. We ordered two soups- spicy miso and pork bone soup. The meats come i various marinations, and the beef and wine are okay. I recommend getting the regular beef.\n\nIt's $25/person for it and trust me, Ipot is so much better. (I'm sorry I can't stop comparing this place to ipot. Even boiling in fremont is better too!!) The pot can be two soup but they will charge a dollar each per soup, which adds more to your price.

And in SF, there are plenty of cold days to go around. It's hard to get a good broth flavor, so when our good friends invited us to try out their new favorite hot pot place, we had to go. And we were not disappointed.\n\nSERVICE\nWe came in on a Monday night at 7pm and had no trouble getting a table. Our server was so kind and eager to please. He apologized for waits (even though we weren't even waiting) and any slight inconveniences. He was quick with the water, tea, and beers refills. Finished plates were also cleared very quickly.\n\nFOOD\nThe hot pot itself is AYCE (all you can eat), which I've never had before for hot pot. They give you a paper menu to order from. We selected 1/2 spicy broth and 1/2 pork bone. Both were delicious. The spicy was laden with Szechuan peppers dripping red oil, but was not so spicy that people couldn't eat it. There's a little tray of add-ins to your personal dipping sauce -- ginger, onion, peanut sauce, etc. I added all but the chili to mine, and everything I ate was delicious from then on!\n\nAs for what to order, the kobe beef and enoki mushrooms were my personal favorites. The cuttlefish balls, fresh shrimp balls, and mixed meat dumplings were also really good. The flavors were on point and the meat was always tender and soft, never chewy. I was especially impressed with the calamari squid -- it was not chewy at all and I could cut it with my wooden chopsticks! We also loved the black fungus and noodles, as well as nappa cabbage and baby bok choi. And the radish was divine -- it cooks up so soft and warm, and is a perfect complement to the sauce and meats. We ended up going big and getting 4 rounds of ingredients. The staff never once stopped us or made us feel anything other than excited to be ordering more.\n\nWe washed it all down with big bottles of Asahi. They've got a decent beer selection and you can do AYCD (all you can drink) beers for an additional fee ($13 I think, but don't quote me on that). \n\nI loved my experience here and will definitely be back.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

Huge thumbs down for their beef, too chewy! Y\nYes, miso IS salty but I think the broth was TOO salty. Salty to the point that sauce is completely useless.. \n\nWe requested peanut and ponzu sauce.

How this AYCE hotpot restaurant works is that you check off the ingredients you want from a list, but don't worry you can always order more from the list later. 1 soup base is set at a standard price, but if you order a mix of 2 or 3 soup bases, it'll cost more. There a wide range of different options for ingredients which is a huge plus, and the stove is simple to manage. The price here for AYCE is $25/person, which isn't a bad deal at all. Service was friendly, and there's always waiters walking around. Poor ventilation in here though. As I was dining, I felt like I was stuck in a hot box. I mean even the glass windows fogged up.\n\nGot the Spicy Miso and Pork Bone for soup base and tried the Kobe Beef and Lamb.\n\nBoth soups tasted nice, but I would prefer the Spicy Miso over the Pork Bone. The kobe beef barely had barely any marbling fat to it. The lamb meat was sliced way too thin that when I tried picking it up, it fell apart into little pieces.

And for the second time we were there, we were celebrating a birthday and had asked for the cake to be delivered out. They just took out the pink box the cake came in and gave us a knife. Granted, I know it is not a fancy dining establishment but it would've meant a lot if they had offered to even set up the cake with the candles we gave them.\n\nTL;DR: Food is good, don't expect them to go the extra mile for your meal doe.", "author": "Wendy L."}

I got here around 6 and was promptly seated.\n\nNote: Like most Chinese places, you have to flag down waiters for service, if that's something that you aren't used to, that's how this place operates. You ask and they come to you right away and give you service, it's standard around Chinese places, so don't be alarmed and I didn't take off a star for it because of that reason.\n\nFor an all you can eat place, the meat was pretty average, but not bad. Vegetables were fresh and the fish balls, pork balls and beef balls they had was tasty and of the standard fare. Overall, things were pretty fresh and there is a variety of broth to choose from (although it seems like most of them are pretty greasy, so if you are health conscious, might be best to stick with hot water and make your own broth by making the food yourself).\n\nParking in sunset is hit and miss, the good part is that there is a MUNI Rail station half a block away. (I believe it's the N Train, or whatever train that's headed to Ocean Beach).\n\nThere is value here in the price, if you are a big eater, or just don't want to have it nickel and dime you, this isn't bad. (I've been to a per plate place and came out with a $100 bill without even knowing). Price on Weekdays are $24.99 and weekends are $25.99, and i would say that you get what you pay for, it's not the $12 Hot Pot place that gives you crap.\n\nOverall I would come back to this place again for the value and the selection. I would skip the broth next time and just go with water and maybe a couple of chilis if I want something spicy.\n\nFor $13, you can also get unlimited beers (and the price of an uber ride home afterwards).", "author": "Duncan H."}

I can't do hot pot without tripe :)\n- Fish paste - Not that much place will offer fish paste.  There were actually 2 kinds.  \n- Pork\n- Fried Fish cake - OK\n- Veggies - so many options.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-08", "description": "Let's not get confused - hot pot at a restaurant, for whatever reason, is never quite as good as hot pot at home.  That being said, going out for it is definitely a lot more convenient; it looks simple, but doing hot pot at home is a lot of work, given all of the prep and clean up.  Plus, at restaurants, it's AYCE!  Well, it's AYCE at home too, but at least it's a fixed price at a restaurant.\n\nWith my favorite hot pot joint currently out of commission (Hot Pot Garden), the Pot's is now my go-to hot pot joint.  Much like with Hot Pot Garden, menu variety certainly isn't lacking - a dozen different soup broths, along with numerous types of seafood, meat, vegetable, meat/fish balls, dumplings, and noodles to choose from (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-pots-san-francisco?select=0evdtLvTtI4mPMe7ZNWa9Q#0evdtLvTtI4mPMe7ZNWa9Q).  \n\nOn this most recent visit, my friend and I got a split pot with the HK Style Satay and the Spicy Miso (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-pots-san-francisco?select=0evdtLvTtI4mPMe7ZNWa9Q#T9JbIYxdEXfJ8PPIZ5te0A).  I also tried the Fire Sauce on a previous trip here and of the three, the Spicy is definitely the best one.  It's more flavorful than the HK Style Satay and has just the right amount of heat, but isn't as heavy on the spices as the Fire Sauce.\n\nAs for their other menu selections, most are pretty decent, though there are a few things that aren't all that great (particularly the dumplings).  The fishcakes/balls are a little hit and miss (fried fishcake good, lobster ball meh), but the vegetables have all been fresh and the meats (Kobe beef and lamb) have been pretty tasty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-pots-san-francisco?select=0evdtLvTtI4mPMe7ZNWa9Q#VdIcsG79p75mSjBF0TYeGQ).\n\nWhile The Pot's is a more than adequate substitute until Hot Pot Garden reopens, it should be noted there's a gap between the two.  Both are good, but it breaks down to quality versus quantity.  The Pot's has much more to choose from (12 soups versus 8, more types of meat/goodies), but Hot Pot Garden simply tastes a bit better.  Better Spicy Miso broth, better meat, and better (friendlier) service.

We were a party of 7 people and arrived around 5:15pm. We did not make reservations. Waited a few minutes for a table. The menu is printed on one large sheet of paper. There were a variety of items to choose from. You mark how many you want. It's all you can eat. For $25 + tax AYCE, it's actually not that bad considering the amount they give you. \n\nWe had 2 pots with one broth each: regular miso and bone broth. We were going to get 2 split broth in each pot but noticed in small print...they charge $1 extra for each person if you split the hot pot. Portion is great. I didn't care much for the kobe beef slices. I prefer the regular lamb slices over the beef. If you forget the beef and was cooked longer than it should, it becomes tough & chewy. The lamb remained tender even if it's cooked long. The lamb marinated with beer was like whoa. I can really taste the beer. Definitely, not for kids. The beef marinated with wine was good. Not that bad. Shrimp, swai fish filet, tendons & all types of veggies were good. The dumplings were very filling! I requested hot sauce and was given sriracha only. I was expecting a house-made spicy chili sauce but none.\n\nMake sure you get all the items ordered. They forgot our egg noodles. By the time we noticed it, we were already full and didn't bother with it. It would be nice if it was brought out during the beginning of our meal. At the end of our meal, we scooped out some broth into the empty sauce bowl. Drank it and yum! So much flavor & tasty. Warms up the soul. Overall, we enjoyed dinner.

The salty egg yolk dumpling was also interesting, and a nice mix of salty and sweet. I think the $25 price tag for AYCE is appropriate for the amount of items they have and the quality.

The first time i came here, my bf and I thought this place was MEH. But since we didn't quite remember our impression on this place the first time, we came back the other night. The first time we came we had tonkatsu and spicy miso broth, the spicy miso was good and the tonkatsu was forgettable and bland. This time around we got the Very curry and spicy miso broths, let me just say, it was a good choice. The Very curry looked a bit oily to begin with but it had a good amount of curry flavor and it was spicy. Do try the Very curry broth, if you like curry! Spicy miso, had good flavor and it was pretty spicy! But not burn your mouth spicy, it packed a good amount of heat.\n\n I was craving all kinds of dumplings and balls that night so we got an assortment and lets just say those were not bad. We got shrimp balls with cheese, shu mai, fish balls, fish cake, imitation crab, lobster balls, shrimp balls, and xiao long bao. all of them cooked were not bad at all, except skip the xiao long bao, it was not good. \n\nWe went with kobe beef, the first 2 dishes had really lean beef but when we ordered an extra plate of beef, this plate was not lean. it was some pretty fatty slices of beef. Even though i do like the marbling of beef, these slices were way too big and fatty. \n\nOverall, I would come here again. That very curry broth was so good, and the dumplings and balls were all delicious. This is actually closer to me than hot pot garden and it seems to be less crowded, will make another trip here again soon!\n\nTotal for 2: $ 61", "author": "Stella J."}

We had a large party and made a reservation in advance and we ended up in our own private room which was cool, though it was super hot even though they put the fans on.\n\nThey have a really decent selection of soup bases and plenty of meat and veggies to choose from as well. If you do a half and half soup base, they charge you more though. How lame. But since there were so many of us, we got more than one pot which meant we could choose more than one soup base.\n\nWe got the pork bone which was pretty good. It could have a little more flavor though. The miso was pretty good. Probably one of my favorites of the night. And the tomato one was... interesting haha\n\nThe veggies were pretty fresh which I appreciated and the meat was alright. We pretty much tried a little bit of everything and some it was good and some of it was just alright. They have some really interesting picks like cheesy meatballs, and beef with beer or wine and you can totally taste the alcohol. I would eat these last because they will change the flavor of your soup base. Everything tasted like wine afterwards!\n\nOverall, it was okay.

Speaking strictly foodwise, this was a 5 star experience. However, once I factor in service, there is more left to be desired. \n\nAlthough the waiters seemed to be busy, there was simply not enough of them. We had to make a substantial effort to flag somebody down to bring us a check and given that it was my first time at the restaurant, nobody even bothered to explain how everything works.

It continues to be worth the lengthy drive from Roseville (thought we usually do tack on the visit with another purpose in the city! lol). \n\nUsually we come here at 5PM when it opens to avoid any lengthy lines but this time we were coming after the Cirque du Soleil Amaluna show and could not arrive until 8PM. That being said i was super nervous about an hour long wait and was already yelping for alternatives just in case. When we arrived we saw about 30 people outside and were already getting depressed, but then we went in to put our names on the list and there was a table for 2 available immediately! So... tip for those who are going there, tables for 2 seem easier to get than larger parties - seems like most folks go in large parties and that's where the wait will be!\n\nThe price is still consistent $25.99/person on the weekends, with an additional $1/person if you do different broths. The kobe beef was beyond this world, even better than we remember it - we ate 3 or 4 plates of the stuff! We love the fact that there is a HUGE fish ball and dumpling variety too - we got our typical foods, fish balls, dumplings, tofu (the frozen/iced is really yum too!), shrimp, pork, kobe, napa cabbage, and bok choy. We were in a meat mood so that's mostly what we got - the food was again delicious. \n\nThe service was meh but that's to be expected with a packed house. There seems to only be one main waiter with a lot of additional waiter helpers who move food and clean up but one that takes the orders. The main guy was SUPER nice to us - continously apologizing for the service, but we were not at all concerned, it was a great experience.\n\nOf note - all the people in here are Asian, I assume mostly Chinese, that's what I heard being spoken most of the night. My husband is white and he was the only non-Asian in the restaurant - but for those who are not Asian - do not be intimidated - the menu is in English - everyone for the most part speaks some English - and it should not be enough of a hinderance to NOT come here and eat.

I went here with my wife after a long day of sight seeing in the city.  My wife being from HK, I thought this would be good for her.    We tend more toward seafood and vegetables.  Here is my review of the good, the bad, and the ugly...\n\nTwo thumbs up for the selection.  They have a wide selection of fish balls and other seafood...fish paste, crab balls, prawns, etc.  I cant name all the vegetables but they have plenty of green things to choose from.  \n\nTwo thumbs up: On the plus, plus side, good selection of beer and the price was not bad. A bottle of Sierra Nevada IPA for $4-something.\n\nOne thumb up for quality.  My wife \"surprisingly\" linked it more than I.  For me, most of the food was a bit too salty, leaving me dry and dehydrated.  (we used mostly the spicy soup base, I don't know he name of it but the one with about a million red cilli peppers).  When we got home, I immediately downed about a gallon of water to bring some sense of normalcy to my mouth.\n\nNeutral:  Overall Price came to just over $100 for the two of us and our daughter.  Thats 2 adult AYCE , 1 child AYCE and 3 beers, tax and tip.  Thats more than I'd like to pay esp for mid tier quality but Ive come accustomed to high prices.  Im sure we can find better quality for about the same price or a little cheaper.\n\nTwo thumbs down:  Ambiance, decor and service.  How do I put this?  The place was not very clean.  Some tables were empty that needed clearing (seems like for some time).  About  1/2 the tables have gas burners on top of them (not built into the table).  Does not seem very safe so we asked to be moved.  The building is a bit run down.  Some walls needed to be wiped down apparently from customers days or weeks ago.  Several TVs on walls in the main dining area and one in the little room to the side (where we got moved to), but not especially high quality.   Lastly, our waitress was very nice when she came around but she did not come around very often.  We repeatedly had to ask the waiter from another table to help us.  He was nice too and didn't complain.  \n\nOh and one of my pet-peeves about restaurants, bars, stores, etc..: This place has NO WI-FI!!  If youre looking to stay connected, you cant.  \n\nNet-net: No particular reason to come back but plenty of reasons to look elsewhere if looking for high quality, high value hotpot.", "author": "E.

I came here with my family for dinner one night and had high hopes based on the reviews and the large group of people waiting. We waited for about 45 minutes to get seated and it was apparent from the moment we sat down that they were understaffed. To say that service was horrible would be an understatement! It takes over 30 minutes for anything to get to the table each time you put in an order and every time, they would get something wrong. They'd either forget something or add random items that we didn't order. After awhile, we gave up and just dealt with it since it took so long for anyone to come over to our table. \n\nOnto the food: I thought that everything was very average. However, I'm almost certain all their \"homemade\" items are store bought and frozen. We also got an order of mushrooms that still had chucks of dirt all over them. For the quality and price they charge, I think it'd be cheaper get the same meal at home. \n\nLastly, the restaurant opened a side room (probably because they ran out of space) that we were seated in. Unlike the main dining area, the pots in this room were placed on gas stoves on top of the table. Not sure if the restaurant owners aren't aware or if they just don't care, but I'm pretty sure this would be in violation of SF safety codes. \n\nI was thoroughly disappointed with the Pots and am quite surprised at the positive reviews. If service and food quality aren't important, then I guess this would be the place for an ayce meal.", "author": "Rhonda T."}

I came here with my friend on a Friday night, and it wasn't too busy, but while the waiters were waiting on the tables on either side of us, they failed to wait on us. Mind you, we were done with our first round of meats and veggies and wanted more, and it took at less. 5-10 minutes until they noticed us just sitting there. Second, most hot pot places add more broth as time goes by, they did not do that for us. Third, the slices of Kobe beef were too thick that it was hard to chew. I like my meats sliced a bit thinner for easier consumption. We waited for our check for a while. Tip: you have to flag them down if you want any type of service. \n\nOverall, the food was alright. There were a lot of foods to choose from. A lot of variety. There's something for everyone! It's $25 all-you-can-eat, and I'm sure we ate our money's worth.

We were seated in this smaller room which was nice but boy does this place need to practice on what is even decent service.  \n\nWe changed our own gas can because these guys were too engrossed in watching the basketball game. Someone from my group had to go to the counter and grab a gas can for us because they wouldn't help us.  I know it gets busy and you have a lot of people to serve but we really did not get any service at all, and that's not okay. We didn't have items come out, out of the 15-20 plates of meat the boys ordered only about 6-8 plates came out, we were constantly asking about food, constantly waiting and not receiving anything. \n\nNo offers to give us water. No explanation as to why our food wasn't coming out. My boyfriend said to cut them some slack since it seemed busy. We walked out of the room to an almost empty restaurant and we still got shitty service? There's no reason to cut slack for inconsideration. \n\nThe food was great. It wasn't my groups favorite in terms of quality but I enjoyed what we ate and the broths. But I couldn't handle how awful the service was. We had to wave them down multiple times to just get water and napkins. \n\nIt's unfortunate how bad the experience with service was. Maybe we'll give it a shot again as we did enjoy the food.

I'm always down for AYCE hot pot because there really aren't many places that serve it in the city. This is one of the cheapest hot pots in the city, and it's pretty delicious. They have tons of room for people, and they're never really that crowded-- unlike my other favourite AYCE hot pot place-- so it's good because we didn't wait for a long time. \n\nThe Pot's is a good, affordable place with lots of soup base and meat choices. They even had lamb in beer, which is something I didn't think happened, but tastes delicious. The slices of here are thick and serve more than 1 person, so you don't need to order more than one serving at a time. They definitely give you enough proportionate to your party (maybe even more-- it was only 2 of us and we were stuffed a good hour and a half in.) This place is AYCE, and you order from a menu and check off what you want. They have a wide variety of soup broths, and you can order up to 3 (!!!) at an additional $1 per person per soup broth (that was confusing, but if you ordered 2 soup broths, and you had 2 people-- you pay $2, get it?) We ordered the fire spicy (which the waitress recommended as their most popular soup broth) and the miso. Even though I shared with my BF, he ended up eating more of the miso and I ended up eating more of the fire spicy. They will refill your broths if they see most of it boiling off lol. They also have drink choices, but they are not on the menu-- so you will have to ask about separate drinks PLUS the prices, since they aren't listed on the menu. \n\nOverall, I really like The Pot's. My only qualms are that the service can be spotty at times, even when you circled something on the menu: For instance, we circled large noodles and rice on our menu, and while we received EVERYTHING ELSE at the first go-around, we didn't receive our starches. However, when we stopped a waitress to ask for rice, she brought it around immediately. Also, I miss an 'all you can eat sauce' bar, which is prominent at other hotpot places. This place has a house sauce (they don't specify ingredients) which you can customize further with chunks of minced garlic, scallions, jalapenos and other stuff-- but there's just the one sauce.

Spicy was definitely favorite--lots of chili peppers resting on the top. Pork bone was also good: it tasted nice and clean, and it complemented all the things we cooked in it pretty well. The miso was a little too smoke-y for me, but still delicious.\n\nI thought it was strange that they offered soup dumplings, shumai, and just other dumpling things as part of the hotpot experience. It tasted delicious, but it doesn't quite absorb the broth as well as the lamb, the bok choy, or mushrooms.\n\nBut they have a good selection of things to try.

I don't see the point of going out to a restaurant and cooking when you can cook your own food at home. But as my friends started to drag me to more and more hot pot places i started to like it. I have to say The Pots is pretty high up on my list. Mainly because their soup bases are strong and has enough flavor, were i don't have to use any condiments. \n\nPork bone- The base was sweet and a meaty taste to it. There's veggies, like napa cabbage in the base so i think that's made it so sweet, \n\nHong Kong Style Satay- It taste exactly as it sounds. However, because it's satay and it's a soup base so it will taste extra \"hot\"\n\nTomato Potato Pumpkin - So much as i love the 3 ingredients i actually dislike this soup base the most. I don't know what i was expecting but i think i should've expected it. It was a very tomato-y soup base. It tasted like the tomato soup i would make a home. This was the one soup base where i had to use condiments\n\nMiso base- This was really good, it might be a little on the salty side, but you can actually find tons of seaweed in this broth\n\nCongee- I do not know why this was my favorite soup base of all.  I'll admit, i usually like my congee plain, But it wasn't plain enough where i had to use condiments to eat my meat.  The base had a lot of flavor.  And there was so much rice on the bottom that i didn't even have to order rice to go with my food. By far this is my favorite base\n\nThe meat choices here isn't a large as Hot pot Garden, but it was still enough. I loved the beef balls with cheese. You should wait until this is cooled down before you bite into it, because the cheese can come squirting out and into the eyes of your friend right across from you. ... just kidding.. \n\nThe best items on their menu is the fried taro, yam and pumpkin slices.  It's so much better than the ones at hot pot garden.  Because they fried it, it doesn't melt if you try to cook it in your pot. The yam is fried to the point where it taste like a potato chip to me, i don't even place it on the pot, i just eat it when they serve it.  \n\nBecause i usually get the congee base, i get the red bean bun. It tasted pretty good when you cook it because since the congee don't have a strong taste it doesn't take away from to the flavor of the red bean bun.  \n\nI would recommend coming here before 7 if you have a huge party, they have private rooms here, so i think they take reservations.  The only think i don't like about this place is that when it gets packed getting out of here can feel like a maze because of all the tables and their trays of ingredients.", "author": "Belinda C."}

The veggies were the same everywhere. \n\nI'd consider going back just bc of the reasonable price (don't know how much it is on other days besides Tuesday), the service was good for a Chinese restaurant especially since I sent three plates back.

I came on a Friday night and came back two nights later because I couldn't stop thinking about it - I HAD to have it again ASAP. It was that good!\n\nBeing the first time, ordering was a little intimidating. My sister and I had to kind of guess at how to do it, and asked the waiter a couple of questions (but didn't want to look stupid). So if you're a hot pot novice like I was, and ready to try something new and amazing, here's what to expect...\n\n(For anyone who has had hot pot before, this will sound redundant and lame.)\n\nYou get a menu, and just mark off everything you want from each category. Careful though, because you aren't supposed to order more than you can eat - they say they will charge you for leftovers. Assuming you come in a party of two, you each choose a broth (I had the preserved egg and cilantro - delish, and my sister had the spicy miso - also great), and then just mark off everything on the menu that you want, from noodles to seafood to dumplings to vegetables. \n\nI'd recommend starting with one or two noodle orders to share, since you can get more if you don't have enough. There are so many other things to fill up on! There are about 6-8 different types - thin rice noodles, wide rice noodles, soba, egg...\n\nAs far as seafood goes, it's like paradise: there are all kinds of dumplings, filled with everything from shredded crab and spinach, to shrimp, to lobster... They come out uncooked, so you need to put them into the broth for a minute or two (might seem obvious, but I when I got them, I thought maybe they were already ready and were just to be eaten as a side to the soup). There are mussels, prawns, lobster balls...It felt too good to be true. Side note - some of the dumplings just say \"spinach,\" or some other vegetable, but be aware that ALL of the dumpling and wonton options have seafood or meat in them, even if it's not listed. So if you're allergic, avoid them.\n\nThere's a huge list of vegetables - bok choy, eggplant, multiple types of mushrooms / fungus (we tried them all - they were all SO good), yam, taro, spinach, bamboo, soft tofu, fried tofu, radish, lettuce. Probably some I'm forgetting too!\n\nAnother little thing I was unsure about was where to put the food once I'd dipped it in the pot...I was wondering why they didn't bring us little bowls. But under the ginger soy sauce, there's a little plate to use :).\n\nLastly - it's not on the menu, but they do serve beer, so you'll have to ask.\n\nFor $25 each, we left so satisfied and full - can't wait to go back!", "author": "Jessica C."}

We were there first. Instead of being seated at a more spacious setting, we were blocking walk ways because a side table was added to a table of 4. We were just in everyone's way and made the experience not memorable. The food also took awhile to come and some food we order didn't even come. It was busy so i can understand the customer service but I was already upset with the seating arrangements and hungry from the extra wait. \n\nThe food was pretty decent. Tried the bone soup base and the fire spicy. The meat was a decent cut. The first few plates were DELISH then as we started ordering more and more the meat just got fattier and fattier.

I'll let it slide only because I worked at a Shabu restaurant briefly and it sucked... ANYWAYS!!\n\nWe opted for the fire spicy broth and the pork bone broth. The fire spicy was full of dried chilis and Chinese spices - BOMB!! but I was sweating (it was that spicy). The pork bone broth had some pork bones in it so you know it's the real deal. It was really flavorful, but I caught myself eating from the fire spicy more. All the sides were great and they weren't out of anything which was a bonus. My only complaint was that the red bean and yolk bean bun was frozen... so we had to cook it in the broth. Kinda weird to have a dessert bun cooked in such a meaty and savory broth. We had to dunk them in our water cups before we ate it... \n\nAll in all, I will return soon when I have another craving. Their portions are smaller and vary depending on group size.. which allows you to order more of everything ;)", "author": "Kenitha Y."}

At The Pot's they have all you can eat for $24.99 (Mon-Thurs) and $25.99 (Fri-Sun).  We chose two different hot pot bases: Fire Spicy and Very Curry and have tried the following items from the menu\n \nMeats:\nKobe Beef - not like the kobe beef you get a shabu places, but this was pretty decent kobe beef\nBeef Tendon Ball - this was really good\nPreserved Vegetable Meat Ball - I'd skip this\nLuncheon Meat - this is pretty much spam, so if you like spam get it\nVeggies:\nBok Choy\nTong Ho\nIce Tofu - good because it becomes spongey and soaks up the broth\nDeep Fried Tofu - good and soaks up the broth\nFried Yam Slice - surprisingly good in hotpot, since it's fried you can eat it by itself too\nEnoki Mushroom\nBamboo Shoot\nChinese Donut - this was so good dipped in the \"Very Curry\" soup base\n \nAll of the above was really good and I thought enjoyed the meal, but one thing that stood out to me which I found interested was the \"Hot Pot Egg Yolk Bun\".  At first I thought it was just a dessert item, like a custard bun.  But actually it was a frozen small, round, dumpling like thing that you cook in your hot pot.  I found the concept of cooking a sweet item in the hot and spice soup base very odd, but once I tried it it was actually very very good.  I would recommend people to try this.", "author": "Mia N."}

Lol). \n\nAnyways, we had double soup: the pork broth and the spicy soup that was recommended by other reviewers. \nNormally, I love drinking the soup at other hot pot places. Here, I just avoided it and cooked my meat and veggies. Pork broth was just decent and spicy broth tasted like nothing with pepper oil. At least it was spicy lol. \n\nWhat I recommend: kobe beef, shrimp, and fish balls. Kobe beef is amazing. Get it a lot! Fish balls were juicy and nice. Shrimp is shrimp. \n\nWhat I recommend u avoid: fish cake, tongue, deep fried tofu, cabbage(unless u like eating a whole iceberg cabbage), and lobster ball. We were recommended to get the ox tongue(?) by the waitress and it tasted so gross lool. I didn't know how to eat it. I would normally be mad at the waitress but she was so nice, I can't. \n\nSeriously, don't get fish cake. I think there was two diff kinds; just play it safe and don't get either. It's dried sponge or some shit idk I didn't feel like I was eating food lol. \nLobster ball tasted like imitation crab meat. Deep fried tofu is literally tempura. \n\nThey charge u extra if u leave a lot of food behind. Thankfully, me and my bf hid the fish cakes and tempura shit in the soup and napkins. \n\nHonestly, for $25 per person and unlimited Kobe beef, this place isn't that bad. I'd come back here again one day if I was nearby. Emphasis on the \"If\".", "author": "Michelle K."}

If you're not, then ~$30 may not want to be the amount you spend for AYCE hot pot. I still thoroughly enjoyed myself, despite not realizing how full I was. Really, you can't blame anyone but yourself about the way you cook things. The dumplings were pretty good. The ramen noodles were really tasty. The spicy miso was spicy and tasty. There were a lot of times during this meal where I thought, \"If only I could get a simple bowl of ramen noodles and dumplings, that would be good. But...but somehow, they keep bringing me food...\"\n\nSo. Food: good. Service: pretty quick. Cleanliness: good. Ambiance: plain enough for you to stare listlessly out into space when you realize you have no more room in your stomach, but still continue eating anyway.\n\nIf you want hot pot, get there early, because voracious eaters know that they can stay there for as long as they want. I saw people waiting outside for some time, so I'm glad I went with some hot pot veterans who knew what was up.\n\nThat said, this was indeed my first hot pot experience. I enjoyed myself. I may not go back because hot pot is not my thing. I also don't know much about the quality of the food.

You have a lot of soup base choices as well as the other meats, veggies, dumplings, etc. The items are not as fresh as say Hot Pot Garden but still pretty good. I feel like they def had more meat choices such as pork stomach, tripe, etc. They also had some other stuff such as the asian donuts and pork blood. The only reason that i was considering docking off .5 stars is because they didn't always bring out everything that we marked. I swear I asked for the salty egg yolk dumplings twice and it never came out. Also they weren't quite as attentive with the water so it did burn at the end.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-15", "description": "First...review...ever. I don't care for hot pot places, mainly because you pay to cook your own food and typically, the broth isn't flavorful enough. The latter isn't an issue here. I went with my girlfriend and a good friend of mine and we had a split pot with two broths: the coconut beef bone broth and spicy MaLa broth. I loved the coconut beef bone broth...light, yet hearty! And the spicy MaLa broth wasn't overwhelmingly hot, and packed with flavorful spices. I kind of stay away from gluten these days (not sure if the broth has gluten in it...I assumed no) and the meats cooked in the broth were so flavorful that there were really no need to use soy sauce, which is a good thing since soy sauce has gluten in it. The quality and variety of meat was good, ranging from spam ham (dirty pleasure) to thin sliced kobe/wagyu beef. You get get rice noodles, ramen and your typical asian carbs as well. They also had these interesting egg yolk/custard balls wrapped in rice paper too. I say interesting because you cook it in a savory broth so if you're into sweet and salty...the egg yolk/custard balls will be...interesting in a good way. Not bad for an All You Can Eat joint. I ate to my hearts content. At $24.99/person, the price was reasonable. \n\nThe food and experience were definitely 4 stars.\n\nBut I give this place 5 stars because my girlfriend and good friend got greedy and ordered WAAAAY...too much food and couldn't finish. We were scared that the owner would charge us for left overs, but he let us off the hook with a very stern warning. And it was fair. \n\nYou'll have a good time and won't leave hungry.

It used to be some cheap tables and chairs in the restaurant, but now it's filled with nice looking chairs and tables. Some tables have an electric stove top and some use the old fashion butane stoves.\n\n== Food ==\n\nA lot of different soup bases to choose from ranging from traditional clear water to spicy miso. There's soups such as pork bone and many other traditional hot pot soups.\n\nThere's a lot variety of meats and fish to choose from. About anything you can imagine would be there. Imitation crab, fish balls, beef balls, beef slices, etc.\n\nThe veggie selection also was very good. Enoki mushrooms, napa cabbage, many variety of tofu, etc.\n\n== Service ==\n\nEven though I made reservations at 7 pm. I had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter to come to the front where they had a sign that said \"Please wait to be seated\". After being seated, we had to make several attempts to wave down one of three waiters working the entire restaurant. After placing our orders, it took about another 15 minutes for the soups to come. However, the meats, veggies, and other stuff did not come with it. The soup sat there boiling for around 20 minutes before the food came. I looked at the time and it was after 8pm that we actually could start.\n\nThe waiters are very rude here since it looks like they hate their lives. They probably do with the large amount of people they're trying to serve. Dishes will be tossed on your table in a hurry. No one will come by to see if you need anything else. Good luck waving one down since they have tunnel vision.\n\n== Overall ==\n\nThis place is really really misnamed. It called \"The Pot's\", but it should really be called \"The Wait\". Three waiters running the entire restaurant during the weekend does not work for this place. Food-wise, there's a very nice wide variety of different things to choose from. The quality is pretty good for the price also. This would be a 4 star but the long wait and rude service ruins the dinner.", "author": "Steven B."}

Adding an extra couple of servers can definitely enhance customer's experience here. We waited almost an hour for our table and the entire time I watched four poor guys running around trying to wait on a full restaurant. There were tables that needed to be cleaned, people who needed to pay/order, and food that needed to be served. \n\nAll that aside, the servers were, when we did interact with them, friendly and apologetic for the wait and always thanked us for our patience. \n\nIt was our first time eating here and weren't sure how ordering worked. Since they were so busy, there wasn't anyone to explain it for us. When we finally did begin to eat, there were a lot of different meats, broths, vegetables and other assortments to choose from. The beef and lamb (marinated and plain) were the highlights of our meal but I was not a fan of their meatballs. \n\nThe total price for two came out to be about $56 which wasn't too bad but slightly pricy for my taste.

Usually for hot pot buffet, we would go to little sheep in Union City since it's a well known brand and we like the flavor of the broth. We went around 7pm on a weekday and they weren't very busy. Their other room was not opened and they didn't want to open it so we (a group of 5) had to sit at a table meant for 4 with a extra chair on the side. As for price, I don't see how they can justify charging $1 per person for half-n-half broth, unless they're putting more spices into the soup, which I doubt.\n\nAs for the food choices, this place has a lot more choices compared to little sheep, and there is no time limit I think. However the only complaint I have is that the service sometimes is very slow. When I asked for a water, I never got it until the server saw me look at him and he had another server bring the water. Then we gave them another menu for more food and it took them literally 10-15 minutes to bring. And they didn't bring everything that we had marked. So we gave them a 3rd menu and this time they brought everything on there. However when we were finally finished, we realized they didn't bring the shanghai dumplings that we marked on the first menu. Oh well.\n\nNext time I come here, I'm going bug them a lot more if they don't bring the food.\n\nPS: One guy didn't speak Mandarin, only Cantonese and English, it was funny watching my friend's mom asking him for more shrimp and him having no idea what she was saying so I had to ask for her.", "author": "Da X."}

It's pretty awesome that we ate for 1.5hrs straight.  The meat might not be as good of a quality as Shabu House, but the fact that we could get shrimp, fish, dumplings, wontons, veggies, mussels, noodles etc. more than made up for it since we only ate 3 platters of meat anyway (not very much in comparison since we ordered almost everything on the menu).  Some of my favorites were the egg yolk and taro dumplings.  Save it for last since they're more for dessert.\n\nThey've been around for 4 years so I'm surprised that not very many people know about this place, which is much bigger and better ventilated than Shabu House.

My partner and I were walking by this place after dinner one night and couldn't help but notice the delicious aroma from this place. It smelled so good! We decided that we will have to visit The Pot's soon. So, we did. \n\nWhen we went, their credit card was down, so they had signs all over the place that said, \"CASH ONLY\". Oops, we don't usually carry cash and were about to walk away when someone from the restaurant (not sure what his role is) assured us that credit card will work too. They will take down the credit card number. So, fair enough, let's go. \n\nWe decided to split the broth - the spicy one and the pork bone broth. I'd say the broths were good, but nothing amazing. Then, it's all you can eat.. so you order whatever you want from their menu on a sheet of paper. Hand it to the waiters and they will deliver. Kind of. There were only 2 of them working, so service was kind of slow. While they had lots of items on their menu (all your traditional items - veggies, all sorts of balls - fish, beef, dumpling items, thin slices of meat, etc..), I wasn't particularly impressed with anything - not even their supposedly hand-made dumplings (they were frozen!). It cost each of us $24.99 or something like that, which is kind of expensive. I'd rather go to one of those personal shabu shabu places in So Cal (i.e. Boiling Point) and for a cheaper price.\n\nThe night ended with a slightly awkward exchange with the waiter saying, \"cash only\", but us letting them know that someone (the host) assured us that they can still take down the credit card number.

The broth/meat is consistent  and great but you can only handle the consistency for so long before you're filled with water weight and begging for a change in texture. SOMEONE THROW THIS BOY A BURGER.\n\nThat out of the way, The Pots is my favorite hot pot joint in the city. Why? Let's call it \"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\" method. \nYou're given a choice of a variety of broths, meets, veggies, egg?, shrimp, dumplings, etc.\n\nWe ordered spicy miso soup as the broth. Meat we opted for pork meat ball, prime rib slice, lamb slice and pork slice. Veggies were bok choy, Chinese lettuce, spinach, deep fried tofu, and eggplant slice. Dumplings, we went ham, with shrimp wonton, chicken and chives dumpling, shanghai soup dumpling and pork dumpling. Noodle we kept it simple with thin rice noodle and udon. \n\nHoly. Shit. BOMB.\n\nNot only can you split the broths (which we found out after the fact), you can literally throw ANYTHING you want on the menu in the pot for an out-of-body all-you-can-eat dining experience. The texture was inconsistent which kept you yearning for more (see: food coma/loosening the belt), all the food was fantastic and service was prompt/friendly. Usually Chinese restaurants can be a hit or miss, especially near closing time on a Sunday, but they were on their A-game.\n\nAt $25/person, we left full, satisfied with HELLA leftovers (which I'm sure isn't the norm but they were about to close... doesn't hurt to ask) I had leftovers for days so I'm a happy camper.\n\nBonus points: they're 2 blocks WALKING distance from my house.\nMinus a star: they don't serve beer (which would be great for those group outings)\n\nThe pots, my hat is off to you.

Two hot pots of broth, one panang (kind of a curry flavored) and another vegetarian that I did not sample. \n\nWe had fresh whole shrimp, wafer thin slices of beef, lamb and pork, tripe, enoki mushrooms, green-lipped mussels, fried tofu, fresh bright greens galore, many many good shrimp & fish dim sum dumplings, and we had chicken thigh meat (more on that later). We also had instant noodles, soba noodles and giant pots of tea.\n\nThe two propane burners quickly heated up the broths and we were off dumping in dumplings and meat and veggies and letting it cook up.\n\nLong handled mini dipping baskets retrieved your food while ladles provided a means of dipping into the broths so you can fill your small bowls full of the goodies.\n\nOn the plus side, the dim sum dumplings and beef pork lamb were all good to very good. The veggies were super fresh and excellent. This was truly a massive amounts of food. \n\nOn the minus side, our waitress would continue to refill the broths (with hot water--not more broth--so the broths got more watered down was the time went on) and supply more meat or whatever we wanted. They do warn you on the menu that there is a surcharge for not finishing what you ordered however. \n\nThe only item that did not impress was the chicken. And the fact many of the raw (non marinated) chicken tasted funky was not consistent with the rest of the meal, nor for a meal of this cost. The chicken was not thin sliced like the other meats, but in chunks off the thigh. This is the only choice that I would not recommend.\n\nFinally, just when we thought we couldn't eat more, the dessert of small sesame balls was a nice touch to the evening.\n\nIf I were to rate this just on the taste of meal alone, it might have been 3 stars, but the final price knocked off a star--especially when they simply watered down the existing broth; this is a stingy practice and unnecessary for the charges. \n\nThis is a more-the-merrier kind of place: more people= more choices.

But I ordered beef tendon (twice) that they never brought out and yes I'm still a little bitter about that the next day. They could have at least mentioned if they were actually out of it as opposed to just generally unconcerned with getting the food we ordered to our table - but that goes back to the service issue.\n\nThe bowls they provide are a bit weird - it is a weird compromise between a saucer and a soup bowl that ends up being mediocre at both. It would have been better to give diners a bowl, a saucer, and a small dipping sauce container. Oh, and they should provide soup spoons without making guests ask for them - my girlfriend kept looking at me funny when I drank the broth from my way too shallow bowl.\n\nBut yes, the broth was pretty good while it was there. My long suffering girlfriend wouldn't have had to endure watching me drink it from my bowl if I didn't think it was good. The hong kong style broth was particuarly good while the spicy miso was fine but had too much seawead floating around in it. I like seaweed, but when it got caught on serving spoons it was kind of awkward. When running low on broth, they fill up your pot with either plain broth or sometimes just hot water.\n\nThe meat, vegetables, dumplings, etc. were just okay. Nothing was particuarly amazing, nothing was particuarly problematic (My stomach was upset with something, but that's another story).

Unfortunately they had a power outage or something fairly recently, so their credit card machine was down, so luckily we pooled together enough money for the $30ish per person (tax and tip were included when they rung up our bill for us). Normally, it's around $25 per person and then another dollar extra per person if you want to split the pot to have 2 different broths.\n\nWe had the coconut pork bone and one of the curry broths and both were very good. I liked the first one the most at the beginning, but once we had been eating for about an hour and a half everything started tasting the same, so you know... get something tasty. Everyone gets their own bowl of dipping sauce that you get to add your own garlic, cilantro, and green onions to, so that was great to be able to prepare our plates for the meat massacre that was about to happen. We ordered off their paper menu list and checked off over a dozen items for the first round, and the food all came out very quickly and it was all great quality. Hungry for round 2, we ordered again once our table cleared up, and the servers were very quick to refill our ice waters and the soup broths.

Try the fried yam and pumpkin slices too. One of my fave finds of the night: egg custard balls and taro balls! These were delicious, a really great sweet option to end the meal on.\n\nSince there is just a crazy amount of options, I would definitely suggest having someone in your hotpot group who really KNOWS hotpot well and can just order s sh*tload of stuff that all goes well together. If I didn't grow up eating hotpot at home, I'd be totally overwhelmed and not know what to get with such a huge listed menu in front of me.\n\nSlight word of caution - service is TERRIBLY slow. The initial orders came out all together (there were always some missing items) fairly readily. Afterwards, it was all downhill. I felt kind of bad because every time a server came into our room, they were accosted by our 5 different hotpot groups with a ton of orders. It seemed to be a 50/50 shot if the order showed up at all. Your chances went up if you reminded them several times.\n\nAlso take note that except for the noodles and veggies, pretty much everything came out frozen (all the meat, seafood, balls of any sort).

No wait at the door, with a \"slight\" wait for a table.\n\nPros: Accepts CC, variety of hot pot choices, helpful wait service, all you can eat\nCons: Wait times! (if you are going to order again, make sure to order before all your food has made their way out of the soup), somewhat steep price for all you can eat $25 on weekdays and $26 on weekends [Fri-Sun](but considerably cheaper than most places), every time we reordered from a new menu there would always be something missing when the food arrived at our table, MAJOR BLOAT AFTERWARDS\n\nMy family came here for dinner after wanting to try a hot pot place. We decided on trying out The Pot's. As we arrived at the restaurant, I immediately noticed the heavily condensed windows and upon walking in was overwhelmed with a ton of good smelling smells.\n\nWe were seated within five minutes of waiting. We were not sure how the menu worked, so we asked one of the waiters and he was easily able to help us and clear our confusion. We gave a waiter our choices, and let the wait begin. I would say that it took at least 10 minutes for a waiter to bring out our spicy fire soup and turn on our stove and another 10-15 for our food to come afterward. The way my family and I decided to order was to get a bunch of different things, and see which items we would be re-ordering. The plates and plates of food came out and looked very good and fresh, very far from that \"frozen aisle of Asian supermarkets\" appearance. We started cooking everything from the Enoki mushrooms, ramen noodles, Kobe beef slices to the plethora of dumplings that I ordered. The soup was not that spicy but at some times, I definitely felt the heat and sweat building. My absolute favorite things out of all the food choices that we ordered were: the spinach, Enoki mushrooms, \u5c0f\u7c60\u5305 (Xiao long bao), Kobe beef, the fried bean curd and the golden fried dumplings! We ordered three times, and I wasn't even at my limit~ Amazing, considering it was basically a buffet and I usually eat to the max at buffets to get my money's worth. \n\nThe wait staff was great. They were friendly and very helpful. Our plates were cleared off in a prompt manner, our tea and my water were filled somewhat slow but not slow enough to ask for a refill. We were checked on twice during our dinner and though I don't like that in other and most restaurantes, it was tolerable at The Pot's for some reason. I mentioned on my cons that there would always be something missing whenever we reordered for more. For example, I ordered Xiao Long Bao three times and only received them on the initial menu we ordered with. I didn't look much into it, but I was a little surprised that I never got another xiao long bao after the four I finished.\n\nOverall, besides the steepish price and the slow food refilling, I would DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS PLACE the next time I am hunting for hot pot.", "author": "Alex T."}

For about $23 (before T/T and on a weeknight, weekend rate is slightly higher), you can gorge on a large array of hot pot items.  There are at least five or six soup bases to choose from.  I had the pork bone soup base and it was quite good.  All items my friend and I ordered were fresh.\n\nI am definitely going back there for more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-14", "description": "I have been here many, many, times, and this is so far my favorite hot pot place in SF.\n\nAwesomeness about it:\n --- all you can eat! for ~$27/person\n --- two broths in one pot\n --- very wide selection of ingredients; meat has better quality than other places\n\nYou should know that:\n --- it get's extremely crowded on nights & weekends. waiting is a bad idea, because hot pot can take 1-2 hours to finish. CALL IN ADVANCE AND RESERVE! Tell them your name, phone number, arrival time, and party size. Then show up at the time, expect there NOT to be a table ready for you yet, but bother the waiters about your reservation, and them being Chinese, will honor the fact that you called, and make it happen soon (my experience is 10 min tops)\n\n --- water & rice: are the two things I never get until I ask twice. it's puzzling to me, because the pot and the rest of the food comes so fast. I think I've been there 10 times, and only once did the rice arrive with me asking for it again (I always mark it on the order sheet).\n\n\nBroth recommendations:\n\n --- pork bone: is the standard hot pot base, can't go wrong with it\n --- spicy miso: is a little spicy and salty \n --- fire hot: is very spicy, and will likely make everything you put in it spicy\n\nSpicy miso & fire hot should both be vegetarian. But double check with them.\n\nStay away from the sake broth. It's really sake + water. I couldn't take it...\n\n\n\nIngredient recommendations:\n  --- meat-wise:  lamb slice, prime beef slice, beef marinated in wine, bork belly, pork intestine (I'm serious, the intestine is amazing)\n\n  --- leaf-wise: crowndaisy/tong ho, napa cabbage, bok choy\n\n  --- balls-wise: beef ball with cheese, shrimp ball with cheese  (be careful when eating, the balls explode!...with cheese)\n\n  --- shrum-wise: enoki mushrooms, black fungus/woodear\n\n  --- fu-wise: fried tofu skin, iced tofu (sweet-tasting), soft tofu\n \n  --- fried yam, fried taro slices (can be eaten immediately or after hot pot-ing)\n\n  --- dessert-wise: dumplings with taro or red bean or sweet egg custard  (NOTE: put these only in clear/pork broth at the end of the meal, take them out immediately after it's done which is confirmed by being able to poke a chopstix through easily otherwise the dumpling might disintegrate)\n\n\n\nDo not get:  \n  --- beef tongue:  it hardens into a leather-y texture, just yucky\n  --- tripe: it may be a good pho companion, but I find it boring in a hotpot\n\n\nThere is no right way to eat hot pot, but here's my general recommendation that ensures a continuous supply of well-cooked food:\n\n1) wait for the broth to boil/bubble before doing anything\n2) put large leafy vegetables in first (tong ho, cabbage) that take longer to cook\n3) put balls and mushrooms next (wait 2-4min)\n4) after the pot reboils with (2)+(3), put in the thin meat slices/seafood/thin veggies (ex: watercress), spread them out with chopstix\n5) as soon as all the meat all turn color (should be fast cuz meats are thin), immediately have the whole table launch eating\n6) IMPORTANT: don't add in more veggies or balls at this time, add in more meat only if you want more food\n7) now the pot should be close to cleaned out, with only broth and some scraps/balls/vegs, now go back to (2) and repeat!\n\nThe reason I do it like this is, leafy vegetables take the longest to cook (and taste terrible if still raw), and meat cooks the fastest (and taste terrible if overcooked). You don't want hungry people to eat undercooked and overcooked food. So, gauge the pot so that there's always a time when everything in the pot is done to the same level and should be consumed immediately. It's not rocket science, but I am surprised that a lot of my Chinese friends don't even follow this simple rule and just stare at the pot and try to add in a few veggies every 2 min. You should never have to do the pick-the-cooked-one game when eating!\n\n\nHappy HotPotting everyone :)", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

We had a large party so they seated us in a private room. The room was able to seat probably 14-15 people and we had a pot for every 3-4 people.  \n\nThey have all of your standard hot pot choices plus dim sum like dumplings.  They also had dumplings that were filled w/ either custard or taro (more for dessert).  Luckily, one of our friends is a vegetarian so his broth was just water and he only cooked veggies in it, so we were able to cook the dessert dumplings in it or else it woulda been salty from our broths.\n\nI think overall, the experience was good but I guess since we had a bigger party, the waiter messed up our orders.  We had 4 pots total and we kinda put in our order at the same time, but 2 of the other pot settings never received their soup or food.  When we finally checked in on it, it turns out the order was never officially put in.", "author": "Mimi P."}

The two times I've ever been here was during the temporary close of HPG so I guess it's hard to say.\n\nThe first time I came here, my fiance and I already noticed that they were slow to bring us food (raw food might I add since it is hot pot) and to refill our waters even after asking several times. The second time around, I came with a friend and it was disasterous! \n\nWe were actually lucky and got in before the 7pm rush but we witnessed tables not getting their food for half an hour or so after their soup was already on the table. EEP! I was embarrassed for the establishment since they were already moving with haste and all staff were on the floor. But for the whole restaurant, I only saw 2 people running around, not including people in the back kitchen. I\nlater kept trying to flag them down to add more water into my hot pot since all the liquids were boiling away but it took them to near burning the pot before they got to me. \n\nYes... it was irritating, but I'm sure if they had extra staff hiding in the back, they would have called them to the floor already. Plus, I already felt bad for them getting chewed out by multiple groups before and after us. Poor things... \n\nBut besides the understaffing, the food is not bad. They have good variety and savory broths. Definitely a nice alternative to HPG, even though that place is still my ultimate fave and I'm salivating just thinking about it.\n\nOh! and definitely order the hot pot taro dumplings!

A huge variety of meat, mushrooms, vegetables, meatballs, noodles, dumplings and other items to choose from. Kobe beef is my favorite meat while all the veggies are delicious. For noodles, I always order taro thread which is just plain amazing. Try adding as much green onions and cilantro into their dipping soy sauce as you can because it makes the sauce thicker and you'll notice the difference that makes.

The chairs and tables take up so much room, and it was just cramped. The ventilation wasn't that great either, it was just hot. I don't think i was hallucinating, but I could've sworn I heard loud thumping music, either in the restaurant or next door. Annoying..\nONTO THE FOOD, we had the all you can eat for dinner and of course, we got our money's worth, and the waiters didn't mind. The food was pretty good, you have your normal hot pot food items such as the thinly sliced meats, fishballs, dumplings, choy, you know the usuals.

Earlier this month, a few friends and I hit up The Pot's to satisfy our Chinese-cooking and all-you-can-eat cravings.  \n\nWe got at The Pot's promptly at 5:30 p.m. and ordered 1/2 mala huo guo and 1/2 pork bone broth.  The broth was good, but I think Hot Pot Garden's broth was more flavorful and clear.\n\nDumplings and Fish Balls (4/5):  We got the all you can eat and were quite impressed with the homemade fish and shrimp balls and dumplings.  The homemade seafood balls were \"fluffy,\" as my friend described it.  \n\nSh Cha and Dipping Sauce (3.5/5):  They had fresh sha cha, seasme paste, freshly diced garlic, chives, cilantro and hot sauce, but they only had four of those condiment baskets for the whole restaurant, so we had to hunt them down and wait a while before we could refill our dipping sauces.  The thing I will say is that Hot Pot Garden has a dipping sauce (peanut?) that is like crack.  It made our sha cha jiang insanely delicious, which was good because I felt like I could keep eating forever.\n\nMeat (3/5):  The cuts of meat are a little fatty, but you still got the whole variety-- beef, chicken, fish filets, lamb, etc.  It was great!  I doubt that they slice them fresh like they do over at Hot Pot Garden because I think the slices of meat came out in little frozen rolls.\n\nExtras (4/5):  The variety at The Pot's definitely takes the cake.  There was SO much to choose from-- lots of veggies, mushrooms, meats, dumplings, fish balls, tofu types, noodles, taro, etc.  They also have you tiao!  SO good.  I wish I was never introduced to those little fried doughs of heaven because I ate so many of them.  YUM\n\nFor dessert, we ordered little \"dumpling\"-like balls of red bean, vanilla custard and this salty egg.  \n\nVenue (3/5):  This restaurant doesn't have any frills.  It's not fancy, and it's staffed with about 4-5 waiters.  It's just a regular Chinese restaurant that serves hot pot.  There's a private room to the side where you can entertain a larger party.\n\nService (3.5/5):  The waiters were nice (not overly friendly), though we had to order fried sweet potato chips several times before the cooks finally processed our order.  They were very prompt and it was easy to wave them down because the restaurant isn't big.\n\nPrice:  I think.. Sunday through Thursday, ayce hot pot is $1 cheaper... I think.

I opted for the cheaper alternative of going on a Thursday.  It is highly recommended to make reservations even on the slower days because in the off chance that they have a full house, you're expecting a long wait.  How long?  Well, let's put this into perspective.  For starters, you're cooking your own meat by placing it onto boiling broth.  The broth needs to be refilled every so often since it's evaporating.  They're pretty slow in bringing stuff out to you.  So you're looking at 2 hours.  I'm estimating there's only 1-2 turnovers per table.  This is definitely not McDonalds.\n\nWhat is The Pots?  Well, it's an all you can eat Hot Pot buffet.  What is Hot Pot?  Think fondue.  So how does it all work?  They give you a sheet of paper where you mark the quantities of items you want along with the broth (I chose half spicy and half pork bone).  You'll want to fill it out immediately since they take forever to bring stuff out to you and they only bring so much at a time.  I remember not receiving all of the items and had to fill out a 2nd sheet only to have missing items.  It gets steamy in there and you definitely don't want to bring your Chanel or Louis Vuitton purse.\n\nNotable items:\n* lamb in beer\n* beef in wine\n* taro chips\n* hot pot egg yolk dumpling (dessert)\n* hot pot taro dumpling (dessert)\n\nThis place could be killer if they speed up the service.", "author": "Ronald L."}

The reason for low stars is really based on the food, service, and space. The service was horrendous - 3 servers/waiters, with a full restaurant; they never paid attention to us & was always normally running around in the back. No moving space as all tables are cramped together, with foldable tables on the side of restaurant tables, for holding a tray of plates (of raw food) for the hot pots. The food quality was okay, but the meats were quite frozen (due to popular demand), and they were never sliced the whole way. At one point, they ran out of big plates and had to resort to small plates, so they stacked our pretty-much-frozen-meats on there. \n\nI came here NYE with 6 other people for my bf's bday dinner. The place was packed with a full restaurant. The waiting area is small, and everyone is blocking the doorway, AND the area to our seats (maybe because it's cold..but maybe some of you girls shouldn't be wearing a skirt & leggings on a chilly night, or at least bring a spare of clothes between parties & dinner). Note to owners: You should tell the people waiting, not to get passed the glass or not to wait at the glass area. It was disturbing our dinner because they kept moving around, and I had to keep scooting my chair inner than I could, or they would hit my chair. \n\nMoving along, we originally had 10 people but 3 bailed. Because we thought we had 10, we made reservations for it and they had put 2 [hotpot] tables together. With 7 people, we could fit a maximum of 5 per table (2 by 2 with one on the side). The other 2 people sat in the second table next to us. Each table group made an order separately. We received our hot pot & meat in about 5 mins. By the time we ordered our second plate of meat, the other table still didn't have their hot pot. I would also like to point out that they didn't come to our table to take our orders or to check on us the first 5-10 mins. After 10 mins of the first table getting the hot pot, someone FINALLY came to the second table to take their orders. The staff does not check on you; if you wave their hand, they won't see you. The only way to get their attention is if they're passing by and you try to wave them down or make QUICK eye contact. We made a lot of plate orders (7 people eating here..), and they would always forget some stuff, such as a plate of pork, dumplings, or meatballs. The way the servers kept forgetting our orders, was basically our entire experience throughout the dinner. Also, if you split the hot pot, they charge you an extra $1 by per person, which makes no sense, since you're already paying the AYCE price. It's not like we can choose to get our own personal pots!  \n\nOn a positive note, this place has a large selection of broth, veggie, and meats. \n\nOverall, I did not enjoy my experience, and will not be coming back probably.", "author": "Mandy G."}

And to those ends, The Pot's delivered.\n\nTHE GIST: Prime freaking rib beef cuts / Delicious sliced pork cuts / Great Szechuan spicy broth\n\nSERVICE AND SETTING\n\nWe went on a Saturday night without a reservation for a late dinner.  The wait was about 15 minutes for a small party.  If you plan to bring a large party you should definitely make a reservation.  However, on the day I went, the reservation line was significantly behind schedule and the last party was seated near the end of their opening hours.  We asked out of curiosity, and it seemed the workers all had to stay after hours to serve that party.\n\nOur servers forgot a couple of our orders, but were attentive at refilling drinks and broth and were definitely friendly and willing to help if you ask them for something.\n\nFOOD AND VALUE\n\nI can only fairly rate the stuff I enjoy, which is pretty much mostly meat:\n\nPrime Rib Beef: Doesn't matter what broth you put this stuff, it's the bomb.  Fatty, delicious, well cut and beautifully organized beef.\n\nLamb: Not as good as the beef, I ended up not ordering lamb after the first round because it didn't have a lot of the game-y flavor I expect out of lamb.  However, that may have been because we cooked the beef first.\n\nPork: Thinly sliced pieces of what I believe to be pork belly... which means the pork here is awesome and I wish I had more.\n\nDon't be fooled by my picky-ness.  The menu here is quite large, comparable to that of Hot Pot Garden.  I haven't seen expensive menus at hot pot restaurants like these anywhere else but the bay area, so explore a little.  Price per head was 24.99, which makes it slightly low in SF, but anywhere else you'd be spending at least 5 dollars more for a menu of this size.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI want some more prime rib and pork.", "author": "Brandon W."}

This is the most food I've ever ate in one sitting-- including every Christmas and Thanksgiving of my childhood. That being said- COME HUNGRY. You'll feel like you're done about 30 minutes in, but ask for some water and relax for a bit because you'll get a second wind.\n\nOn a Friday night, dinner at The Pot's will set you back about $35 after everything. Make sure to get the split pot to try 2 broths! We got half Sichuan hot & spicy soup and half pork bone soup. Wait to critique the broths- the whole point is that the flavor becomes richer and more complex as you cook your meat and veggies in it. Add green onion, cilantro and garlic to your ponzu sauce and dip absolutely everything in there. Ask for rice and noodles. Crack an egg into the little ladles they have in the pots and take it out after a few mins- perfectly poached! Try all of the meats. Kobe beef, lamb, pork, white fish, shrimp, etc. Some are even marinated in wine. Also, who knew you could cook lettuce? \n\nFood safety:\nMake sure you fully cook your meat and wait to grab from the pot until new items are cooked. Also, keep your chopsticks under the broth long enough before eating off them. This is how we prevent foodborne illness, guys.\n\nWe got pitchers of beer for the tables, but I almost want to say skip the beer. You won't have room for it and it won't get you buzzed with all that food! Also, they gave us plastic cups instead of beer glasses. Not the same effect when toasting...\n\nDon't take more than you can eat, or you'll be charged 20% per person. A little tip though: just put (hide) your leftovers in the pot.\n\nBeing the Sunset, the nearest bar is 10 blocks away from The Pot's.

It was near his house after we visit him. It was a Wed or a weekday. I didnt expect it to be busy at all. The price was not cheap but lit more expensive then others.\n\nThe service was a guy and his wife running the front while some dude in the back cutting up some frozen meats silces and a dishwasher or w/e. We have a party of 6 and we order some stuff to start which was not much. The lady say \"can you guys finish that, we charge extra if you dont\"  I mean wtf we not ordering a whole cow. We are Hungry and can finish all of it ofc. That kinda of rude to me.\nFinally the food came and it was very thin cutted and not even enough for us. So we have to order more meats and veggie. We also order some soft drinks which take a long ass time. All the fountain drinks are behide the counters and the nakins too. lmao. \n\nThe soup base was alright nothing special or as good as little sheep in san mateo, There are better place to go, Portable gas stove and when you put the pot on top it is pretty high in the middle of a small cheap unstudy table. I can Imagine an accident can happen in a tight seat resturant. You are elbow to elbow with the next tables and other plp. Barely any room to get out and in of ur seats let alone the server. If you have kids and plp going up and down and around your tables it can get dangerous. All the Co2 fill the resturants. Dont seem to have a good vent here. Come on guys we still screw around with portable gas stove in a resturant like the stone age?\n\nThe Staff is so slow and undermanned, They hide all their fountain drink behide the counter and only the server can refill your drinks when you grab and flag them. straws nakins is all behide the counter too. Are you guys stupid. Do we have time to play flag the waiters and waitress all night. There alot of ways to save money and upkeep of a resturant but not like this. Everything have to ask 2-3x and the wait is crazy when it is not even full pack yet.\n\nMy Tip: Is to order every items 2-3x each, order your drink and get 2 cup for each person. Come early with a good empty stomach. Let the staff know you are hungry and not going to play game. Dont let their remarks bother you. Of course you can finish everything, it not going to cost an leg and arm if you cant.\n\nWould i come here again? Hell No Epic fail. In China and most place all their resturants have a electric flat stove and special cut center tables to make the hot pot lower and safer. You guys need to learn something from them. I wont come here ever again, I feel light headed from all the Co2 coming from all these butane stove.

We came here tonight for dinner at around 7:45 PM and was promptly seated.\n\nAfter thoroughly enjoying Little Sheep 2 weeks ago, I was super excited to try TP b/c it seemed to have a similar concept based on the  pictures online. However, TP and LS are not the same caliber.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/little-sheep-mongolian-hot-pot-san-mateo#hrid:iPv31uVSn4pECBViB7Q5zw\n\nCONCEPT:\nAll you can eat for $22.95 for Mon-Thurs and $24.95 for the Weekend which I think is overpriced considering the poor food quality.\n\nYou get to choose from the original broth, spicy, pork bones, vegetarian, and one other I can't recall. If you want half/half, it's $1 extra per a person which makes NO sense esp when you're paying an all-you-can-eat base price. \n\nThe waiters give you a list, so you can check off the food items you want. They also have Chef Specialties like Sea Cucumber, Duck Feet, Fresh Chicken for an additional fee.\n\nThey bring you your items within 5 minutes, so you can start cooking. You have a 2-hour limit to eat and any items you don't finish, they charge a 20% fee per a person, so don't get too carried away.\n\nFOOD:\n*Spicy Broth: ECK! All heat and NO flavor. Essentially, it was water with chili peppers, peppercorns, fennel and star anise seeds. The broth tasted like I was drinking cayenne pepper water as there was no depth of flavor to it, much less any flavor at all. There was so much peppercorn that when you cook your meat or veggies, the peppercorn sticks to your food item and you end up having to spit out the peppercorns, chewing on it, or getting it stuck btw your teeth.\n\nIf you're sensitive to MSG, be very careful. My heart started to race almost towards the end of the meal from the broth. And, I ended up waking up to a dry throat the next morning. \n\n*Prime-rib: It was ok. B/c the beef was so thin, it kept on falling apart when you pick it up and ended up breaking apart when you soak it in the broth. It didn't taste like \"prime\" quality as the marbling was just at the tip of the beef so it wasn't as tender as I expected it to be.\n\n*Lamb: Uhhhh, why was the lamb brown?\n\n*Spam: The only flavorful item...it's spam after all and who doesn't love spam?\n\n*Hotlink: It was good as it was store bought; spicy and fatty.\n\n*Meat and Seafood balls: Bleh! Menu claims it was \"homemade\" and the pics on YELP seemed like they were homemade, but the ones we got, looked and tasted like balls from the freezer section.\n\n*Pork and shrimp dumplings: It was good! The pork was moist and flavorful and there was bits of sweet shrimp.\n\n*Mussels: Bleh! Another item from the freezer section. The mussels were chewy and hard.\n\n*Imitation Crab Meat: Ehh, the sticks were served as a frozen clump.\n\n*Ho Fun: Gross! They looked and tasted like pieces of flimsy plastic sticks b/c they were frozen.\n\n*Tofu: It was ok and was one of the only things not  served frozen.\n\n*Deep fried taro: Burnt outside on some pieces while still raw in the inside.\n\n*Spinach: Ummm, at least it was fresh?\n\n*Sauce: They give you a sweet soy which you can add minced garlic, chili sauce, cilantro, and scallions to. I used SO much of the sauce b/c the broth did NOTHING to the meat and veggies. \n\nIn short, almost everything was frozen except for the some of the meat, spam, hotlinks, and veggies which is NOT a good sign. \n\nAFTEREFFECTS:\nI'm very skeptical about the TP's cleanliness b/c they had a piece of paper pinned on top of the Health Inspection Score Card, so you couldn't read it. But, really makes me wonder about their food safety practices and freshness of their food, is the \"aftereffects\" my friends and I had. One of my friends, started getting stomach cramps and started to itch before leaving TP. Within 5 minutes of coming home, I went running to the porcelain throne. I BBMed my other friends and apparently they had the SAME experience which is more than coincidental. My friend, John had stated, \"I'm in my fortress of solitude thanks to this place.\"\n\nSERVICE:\nSince it's an \"all-you-can-eat\" establishment, they might as well just make it a buffet type set-up b/c the servers are rude and inattentive. After your first order, they just throw down the plates, they never come to check on you, and don't take your empty plates away.\n\nWe had to ask several times for our Sprite which by the way managed to taste warm even though there was ice in it.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nIt seems TP use to be an old sushi restaurant and it still had the old d\u00e9cor from a sushi bar. The dining room can accommodate about 30 people while there's 2 private dining rooms that can accommodate about 10 people each.\n\nI like to spend my Sundays relaxing and NOT \"running\" to the toilet, so I can say, TP was a once in a lifetime experience...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I'd honestly say they are just as good as Hot Pot Garden,maybe even better in some aspects. \n\nSERVICE: Very accommodating. Very patient. Friendly. Helpful. Attentive. They refilled water glasses several times without having to be asked, which is always a PLUS for me, especially when I drank 4-5 glasses.\n\nFOOD: \nSoup: Spicy Miso and Pork Bone. Bother very good, very delicious. \nDelicious selection of meat and veggies. They beat HPG in serveral aspects:\n1. They have a larger selection of dumplings. I'm not talking 1-3 choices like at HPG, but they have a whole section for dumplings here.\n2. HPG has fish collars, but the amount of meat on the fish is hit or miss depending on the pieces. The Pot's has lovely fresh fillets of fish. Much better.\n\nAMBIANCE: Modern. Clean. It has several flat screens playing sports. Thank you for having CLEAN bathrooms. Thumbs up.\n\nYou must try The Pot's at least once! The selection will surprise you, even if you're a HPG fan. However, HPG definitely has the edge on alcoholic beverage.\n\nDefintely will return!\n\n-------\nEDIT: Sadly i realized their dumplings ARE frozen. I guess the first time around they were thawed/defrosted properly that I didn't realize it, til the second time around. Oh well, still good, and I'd order them again, but now I know they are frozen just like HPG.\n\nOther things I've tried:\nTheir miso soup base was pretty good, with nice big chunks of tofu, so you can skip on ordering a plate of soft tofu.

I was a self proclaimed fan of 'all-you-can-eat' shabu deals since I had my first shabu house.  But, my hot pot cherry was recently popped earlier this year and I've been semi-fanatical since.  \n\nI was amazed at all the additional items that you get at a hot-pot vs a shabu house.  Yes, you get the thin sliced 'kobe' beef (or so they say 'kobe'!)  But, hot pot also come with fish balls, lobster balls, dumplings (like 10+ different kinds), prawns, calamari, veggies (all kinds) noodles, etc.  The list could go for days, granted I didn't recognize half the items on their list of ingredients, but 50% ingredient recognition at a Chinese restaurant isn't that bad.\n\nThis place tends to get crowded, especially on rainy SF nights.  The wait could be 1+ hours, thankfully we were able to call ahead and get our name on the wait list (they don't take reservations).  \n\nAt a whooping $24.99 per person, it's a great, filling meal that doesn't break the bank.

I made a reservation for 11 during the week, and we all came on Saturday night. The Pot's is out there, in the Outer Sunset, which took forever to get to! But that's alright, nice to get away from downtown sometimes. Funny thing was, you would think parking would be easy here, but it actually wasn't. \n\nThe decor here is very simple, restaurant is packed to the max with tables and seats.  Our party of 11 sat at one large table in one of the separate rooms from the main dining area. A plus was that once we arrived, our table was already set and ready for us.\n\nI really wanted to LOVE the Pot's, but it was just average to me. I did enjoy having hot pot with a bunch of friends and getting lots of food, but here were the negatives:\n\n- Sauce selection is not only small, but poor. I did like that their soy sauce is home made, but the sad basket selection of cilantro, green onions, garlic, and hot sauce all seemed to be the cheapest quality of condiments.\n\n- Broths were okay - I would expect it to be better if they're charging you extra to have two different broths at your table.\n\n- Aside from the meats, everything was pretty much frozen foods. Meh, this made for less quality and very bland items. \n\n- They do have a large selection of items, more than other places. However, we noticed throughout our meal that they don't bring you a lot of the items you mark down. ech..\n\n- They don't serve any kind of alcohol, but on the flip-side they do allow BYOB.\n\nAside from all of that, service was friendly and attentive for us. Although the food wasn't necessarily that great in quality, I still had a great time with my group of friends. Like I always say, hot pot is such a fun and yummy socializing meal.\n\nNot sure if I will return though - I just keep getting reminded that when it comes to hot pot, you just gotta do it at home.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-23", "description": "Allow me to preface my comments by explaining that I was in the mood for dim sum, and had never experienced hot pot dining, so I was disappointed.  This restaurant is miscategorized and some of the reviews made me think it would be a buffet with some dim sum items in addition to the hot pot, but that's not the case.  So this review will be detailed for the others who, like me, didn't know what to expect.\n\nUpon arriving, you're seated at a table that has a portable butane burner on it and given a pot of tea and a menu so that you may indicate which type of broth and various ingredients you would like.  It is all-you-can-eat as others have mentioned, but it's not a buffet line where you pick out everything--they bring stuff to you.  After a few minutes, they bring out a pot of broth, which they set on the burner for you.  Following this, come plates and baskets with all your meat, veggies, and dumpling choices.  They also give you some dishes of garlic, cilantro, green onion, and chili sauce to flavor your broth.  You then proceed by cooking your own dinner by adding the ingredients to the soup.\n\nI would be ok with this concept except for a few things.  One, the staff doesn't really give you any guidance about method (to be fair, I didn't ask).  I'm a good cook, but this was outside my area of expertise, so I was frustrated by having to guess and figure this out.  Second, it's $25 per person for you to cook your own soup!  I could make my own soup at home for much less.  Third, because the butane burner is set on top of the table, and the pot on top of that, it is a very awkward angle from which to be dealing with hot splashing liquid.  I'm short--I literally had to stretch and strain to see everything in the pot.  I've been told that other hot pot restaurants have tables with the soup pot built in so that you're ladling from table level, which would have made the experience much more enjoyable and less dangerous.\n\nOn the plus side, the food was tasty and the staff was friendly and the place was clean.  If they charged $10 or $15 per person, I would have considered going back now that I know what to expect.   The way things stand, I won't be paying another visit.  Sorry.", "author": "Areena M."}

My friend did the same but for some reason only my food came out. So it took a while for her to eat due to the initial wait until we figured it out and by the time we put in a second order, the place was already getting busy.  I had to ask for drinks three times before I received it but I made sure to keep asking the same guy and after the third time it clicked and he was super apologetic. He came by a second time to apologize again and took the drinks off the check which was nice. I totally understand what it's liked to be slammed and understaffed and they did the best they could. \n\nThe miso broth was nice. So was the udon noodles, soft tofu, and the Chinese donuts. The beef marinated in wine will get super bitter with alcohol the longer you let it sit so eat that first.  The beef tendon was chewy and never got soft. I loved the variety of vegetables, my favorite is the Napa cabbage and the enoki mushroom. The shrimp is firm and comes with the head and we also had squid and beef tendon balls.  It was $23 for each person for two hours worth of all you can eat. \n\nI am a big fan of Shabu  on Geary. But the variety of broths, meats, and vegetables here is nice.

I had to look it up on Yahoo, it means All You Can Eat.\n\nAYCE hot pot dinner: Sun-Thu $22.99 & $24.99 for Fri + Sat\nThey have other items too, not just AYCE. You can order individual items, but I'm sure if you're eating a full meal or a big eater like me, you'd go for the AYCE. I think it's much cheaper.\n\nI suggested this place because a friend suggested another hot pot place which was more expensive. I am a starving college student or just a poor one, so searched for a place that's cheaper & more affordable for me. I chose this place because it is relatively close to me, it's one of the cheaper AYCE hotpot places (I think), & I've been here before. Good thing they all liked it, because oh mannn it would have been my fault for this restaurant choice. They liked how there is seafood and not just meat & veggies.\n\nI was so excited when I found out yesterday that we were going to hot pot. I guess anytime you hot pot, it's fun & worth getting excited for.\n\nThe last time I came here, I gave them 4 stars. This time, I must admit, they deserve a 5. Why a higher rating this time? I felt jipped when I ordered more than $23 worth of hot pot stuff per person, I tried to not exceed it but we did.\n\nI would suggest installing more restrooms. Most hot pot places only have 1 for female & 1 for male or just 1 restroom altogether. I mean you're drinking ALL THAT SOUP & there are other people in the restaurant that are drinking that delish custom made communal soup. I would imagine a line forming out the door just for the restroom. Maybe restaurants don't see the need for it, maybe I'm just crazy. I guess it would cost more to install & for the water bill, if more people had to use the restroom there, therefore jacking up the prices on food. Maybe if there's only 1 restroom, the restaurant thinks that some people wont use it and will just wait to pee. I guess there really isn't a need for it. Usually only 1 person in line.\n\nWell...onto the food.\nWe picked the pork bone broth, since that & the spicy are the 2 most popular. Me and another friend can't eat spicy, so just pork bone broth.\nWe didn't stop, we're eating machines. \n\nWe ate beef balls, all sorts of noodles, various meats, assorted choy, mussels, deep fried taro, tofu & all that...so much food, I probably can't sleep tonight. It was so good but towards the end, the bottom started to burn and everything tasted like it. If you're done with your 1st sheet and want more food, just ask for another & they'll give it to you.\n\nThe burner thing burned out, so we told them & they changed it right away. The water started to boil much faster.\n\nA friend and I were the food champs, I must say he ate a lot more than me though. Have to finish it if you order it.\n\nFor 8 people it was $240.07, the restaurant included tip already, I guess because we had more than 6 people. It was nice coming with this crew, they'll eat the real Chinese kind of stuff, like pig intestines, willingness to eat anything on that list. If you're all going to add it to the same pot, you should have similar palate. Whatever anyone else adds, you're going to taste it in your soup. \n\nGood service.\nVariety of food.\nClean.\nAttentive.\nFull house, that's when you know it's good.

This place had a lot of pros, but also had some cons.\n\nThe menu had an extensive soup base and dumpling/meat/shrimp ball selection. We chose the pork bone and spicy miso broths; they were both well seasoned and flavorful. The meats, dumplings, meat/shrimp balls, etc. we cooked in the broth were tasty and well seasoned as well. The dumplings were very good. Also, I thought the price was pretty good for an AYCE establishment. Lastly, the servers were cool and asked us how we were doing a few times. Our soup was refilled a couple times; overall, a nice experience.\n\nAlthough some items on the menu were pretty extensive, the meat and veggie selection were a bit underwhelming. The meats were good, but I was expecting a little more. Also, the sliced beef - while tasty - was a bit large and unwieldy. I would have preferred smaller cuts. The veggies were quite disappointing...they actually looked like they had seen better days and were in need of a washing. I prefer a larger selection of fresh veggies that have been properly washed and cut for hot potting.\n\nWhen we were making our own sauce, I happened to notice the chopped cilantro looked a bit discolored in some areas...upon further digging, I realized the entire bottom half of the cilantro was dark green and some parts looked liquified. Basically, the cilanatro was rotting away in the dish...that was really gross. \n\nSoup bases were definitely tasty, but loaded with salt/msg. When we first started, I was raving about the soups, but after a while, the salt/msg became a little much. Even with additional soup being added, it was still quite salty. I drank a lot of tea to counteract the saltiness, which helped. If you find it a bit salty at times, water/tea/soda might help.\n\nI think this place is pretty good...but I still think Hot Pot Garden is my fave for now.

Just make sure you finish you're food so you won't get charged for not wasting it. You sit down, pick a soup base and check off anything you want on that sheet of paper. I've tried the pork base one and the chili one with lots of peppercorns in it. The pork one was super bland. I couldn't taste anything but broth.

I probably tasted all the balls there is, prime rib slice and lamb slices, tofu, spinach, Chinese lettuce (romaine lettuce), taro thread, udon, pork blood, shrimp, dumplings, and definitely the custard crystal dumpling ball. Everything was pretty standard. All the balls were probably purchased in bulks by those big companies but I believe they make their own dumplings or something? That's what they said.

It seemed like they accomodated our whole party in a little side room which comfortably fit everyone there. I liked the spicy miso base. Like I said, I arrived late, so they gave me a pair of chopsticks, but no one gave me any water or refilled on water so I was stuck drinking my friends' water glasses. \n\nI think it was a bit pricey for what it is - I'd rather pay for AYCE shabu shabu than hot pot. \n\nOverall, the food and atmosphere seemed very average, 3 stars, minus 1 for the lack of service (people who arrive late deserve water too!) and price.", "author": "Lena Y."}

When I went in it was pack and many were waiting.  I had a reservation for 6:30 pm and we were seated pretty promptly.   Other than that the service was pretty bad afterwards.  My friend went to the restroom and they overheard employees talking about being overbooked.  Since the employees rarely go check up on us I figure we should just order 3 beef after our 1st one so we don't have to ask over and over, but the brought one.  The whole evening we only had 2 plates of beef.  We order a second round and waited for 20 mins and no food came.  We weren't full but screw it, so we asked for our check which came pretty quick.  \n\nThere was 3 adults and 1 toddler.  They charged us four adults and we told them 3 adults and a toddler.  They changed it to 3 adults and 1 child.  PARENTS BEWARE:  THEY CHARGE 3 YEAR OLD TODDLER  $13.99.  I mean seriously even when they go to buffet like Kome they only charge like $5.99.  $13.99 is like a teen price.  How much can they eat?  All my son ate was maybe like 1 or 2 udons. My husband left a tip, and he thought about it after, we should haven't tip any since they tipped themselves.  Where on the menu do you put kids price and their price range??\n\nI come here a few times a year, and sometimes I go to Hot Pot Garden.

We got there pretty early...5:45...so we got seated right away since there was only one other table eating dinner.  \n\nThis is not your typical all you can eat hot pot where you just get meat and veggies.  You get to pick from about 5 different types of broth, and then you get to choose from a wide variety of items to cook.  They give you a piece of paper with different categories, and you just mark down how many orders of each item you want.\n\nWe went with the spicy broth( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/96Wv2KhAEWpdiWmWH241Fw/l ) which ended up being a little bit too spicy for us, but still pretty tasty.  It had ALOT of dried chilies and peppercorns which kept getting caught in all our food.  The beef was nice and fatty and cut thinly so you only had to briefly swish it in the broth to cook it( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/4bGYrBo5kVsjKd0zR5J_pQ/l ).

Couple of notes regarding the deal...only available on Monday to Thursday(?) and not all you can eat.\n\nThe server had explained to me that it's not THAT much food, and if you're hungry, you shouldn't order it.  I was pretty hungry but decided to order it anyway.\n\nWhat you do get in the deal is rice noodles, napa cabbage, two shrimps, two mussels, tofu, two beef balls, two fish balls, one meatball, one dumpling, and three slices of thinly sliced meat (either beef or lamb, you get to choose one).  You don't get a choice of broth, so you'll get the chicken broth.  Each person gets what I listed above...which isn't bad.  It ended up being a lot of food and I got really full.  We we're going to order some rice, but it was $1.50 per bowl, and they were still cooking it. Probably would've complemented the meal a bit more.\n\nBased on the ingredients we got, the food was only alright.  I've definitely had better hot pot at home before.  The dumpling was probably the best, next would be the thin sliced beef.  Comparing this deal to a place like shabu house...shabu house is much better.  However, my opinion would probably change if I had the all you can eat.\n\nThe deal itself isn't bad.  My friend and I walked out paying $23 total including tax and tip.  Not bad to get full for two people IMO. Probably won't go back for the deal...maybe for the all you can eat.", "author": "Jason M."}

If you're looking for a neat dining experience come on out our way, and if you live here take a stroll over to The Pots. \n\nAs the name suggests you cook your food in pots of boiling broth at your table (shabu shabu).  My usual complaint about shabu shabu style dining will remain, and that is if you are vegetarian you end up paying a lot of money to boil tofu and veggies in a broth - but it is still fun. \n\nThis restaurant is new, and family run. The owner was our waiter.  He was extraordinarily friendly and helpful. You can tell he is excited about opening his own restaurant, and perhaps a bit nervous.  He poured water into my glass which had soda in it before which meant I enjoyed some 7up flavored water.  Also, several of our items were forgotten or mismatched. I'm sure he'll improve as he gains experience. Both he and the other staff were attentive and answered all of our questions. \n\nThe food was fantastic if you like this sort of thing. The dishes come out looking kind of funny but when you cook them in your hot pot.. yummy. Fresh varieties of tofu and a variety of vegetables and vegetarian broths will make vegetarians happy here. And you can get two kinds of broth if you want to keep meat separate. The homemade shrimp ball with cheese inside was surprisingly tasty.  We also had taro root, cabbage, dumplings, two kinds of mushrooms, and my partner had beef and some other meaty things.\n\nWe had a very spicy broth,  and a tomato, potato broth. Both were satisfying on a chilly evening in the Sunset. \n\nIt's fun to cook your own food at the table and experiment with different cooking times and textures!  It would be perfect for a unique first date. It's worth a trip to the Sunset for The Pots.

For hot pot, at least theres a pork broth vs all spicy miso or what not.  And where shabu houses usually house sports bar vibes, The Pot's incorporates karaoke into the mix (very nice).\n\nBut to get those karoake rooms, you'd have to reserve about 10+ people and give about 45 mins of your time to learn the devilish machine which plays with your emotions and spits out chinese opera at the most unwanted time.  But how can you complain.  It's karaoke, and once you get that darn thing moving, you can sing to your heart's desire all the songs you want from Love Story, to How do I live, and so on (don't judge)\n\nAs for the food, it was ok.  Not great, but not terrible.  The variety is definitely there-from watercrest, to bok choy, to ong choy, and so on.  Tofu, tofu skin, dumplings, beef balls, fish balls.  Most of the ingredients are there.  The meat is rather thinly sliced and not to my liking, but hey, its the way it is.  They've got shrimp, calamari, pig intestine, pork liver, and more.  So with that, I guess I can prefer it over shabu sometimes.  Plus, for $23/person during the week, its not too bad.  \n\nAlcohol: none.  And with 10 people celebrating, and a karaoke machine in the back, how can you noT?  But luckily the staff are really cool about hooking you up and letting you drink whatever it is to bring out those vocal chords.", "author": "Vincent K."}

Walked in, no one greeted us, we just stood there waiting, i made eye contact with literally 3 workers and no one said \"hi\" or \"one min\" or \"how many people\" nothing was said. It wasn't even that busy. they had like 5 workers on duty. Finally, we got seated i asked a couple questions and the guys attitude was just so rude. we got some ball things and other stuff. the ball things are so gross. We got beef, shrimp, and something else but they all tasted so rubbery and nasty.  and they didn't even bring us everything we asked for but whatever. I asked for some more water and literally saw the lady fill her pitcher in the sink and she came over poured it in our cups (NO ICE). maybe bc i'm from LA i refuse to drink from the sink but she could've at least hid it from us. honestly 25$ each person for all u can eat is not worth it because half of the menu is not worth eating. I wouldn't even pay $1 for half of the things they were selling AND the horrible customer service is just not my style.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

We were hungry too, so all you can eat didn't sound bad at all.\n\nWe decided to go half clear soup half Szechuan.  I've been building up my tolerance in the last couple of years, but it's definitely not very high.  The assortment of peppers were really strong, and I found myself regularly coughing from inhaling the spicy aroma.  But it's not as bad as it sounds!  I stuck with the spicy broth the whole way, and felt extremely satisfied by the end of the meal.  Plus, the waiters fill it with clear soup as you eat, which helps to alleviate the heat.\n\nWe ordered spinach, lettuce, tofu, dumplings, udon, and order of chicken and fish, 3 plates of beef and 3 plates of lamb.  Of course, split into multiple orders as we saw fit.  I'd say the meat was all very good quality, and the servers didn't try to skimp on the meat as we ordered more.  In fact, it looked as if the plates got bigger (probably to try and deter us from ordering extra).  \n\nThe servers were all very nice and responsive, and never forgot a request.  The restaurant itself was very clean, unlike other hot pot places that can get very dirty.  I think it would be a great hangout spot for larger groups as well.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my experience at The Pot's.  $24.99 is a little pricey compared to other all you can eat hot pots (like Coriya) but I'd say you get what you pay for.", "author": "Andrew T."}

And by \"storm\" I mean, thunder, lightning and seemingly all hell breaking loose. And after all that I of course deserved one, awesome dinner... \n\nFirst of all, it had been awhile since I had Chinese hot pot and I was craving an experience that would catch my taste buds. Leave it to the Sunset district on Judah to give me just that. \n\nWhen I got there it seemed like everyone had the same idea as me because there was about 10 parties of people before us on the waiting list - probably due to both the cold weather and it being around peak dinner time. I think my major issue of this place was that the wait was really long - around 1 hour and a half for my party of 2. The Pot is pretty small and of course at hot pot you would expect entire families and big groups of friends. A couple time during that wait I wanted to give up but the smell that this place gives was a deal breaker. Was the wait worth it?\n\nWhen we finally got a table it was almost their closing at 10. On this particular night they kept the place open for much longer to accommodate people who were waiting for so long. The service was quick - which I can imagine is difficult for a staff so small on such a busy night. The waitresses and waiters were good about checking on us and were all very friendly to me a first-timer.\n\nSo to our POT filled with mild broth and endless possibilities. The thing about hot pot is that your pot definitely is a personalized pot between you and your party, filled with goodies and anything you desire. Since this place is AYCE with a great amount of choices, it definitely expands your creativity. \n\nMy personal favorite items from the menu included: \n- Prime Rib Slice: Excellently sliced and a great quality of meat. :) It was easy for me to finish a whole plate by myself.\n- White Mushrooms: I loved how these mushrooms soaked the broth and gave it a great texture to work with. \n- Rice Noodle: Any noodles are really hard to eat with hot pot due to the difficulty of getting it out of the pot without getting it all over the place - but definitely try an udon or rice noodle to add more substance to your meal.\n- Hot Pot Egg Yolk Bun: This was the PERFECT way to end the meal. It was sweet and after you cook in the broth it just gives it an extra something. I wish I had room to eat about 5 more. \n- Cheese stuffed dumpling: I really can't remember what it was called on the menu but this dumpling was a great little cheese pick me up in between all the fish and shrimp balls we ate that night.\n\nOVERALL, service was great and the food and overall experience you will get at this place is worth the wait. Even after a really long wait, I still gave this place 5 stars for it's value and its ability to bring both warmth and happiness to my stomach - definitely a special place for my 100th review :)", "author": "Tracy Joy K."}

So far, The POT is the SPOT. For $25 it's an all you can eat HK style hot pot (not shabu shabu where you have limited varieties).  Some can say it's expensive, some say fair or some say cheap, it really depends on your appetite that day.  I was browsing through the menu and HOLY MOLY (a heavenly glow to the menu) there's a lotta food choices here, almost as many as Little Fat Sheep.  My friend went into maniac starving mode and started marking almost half of the menu. [FYI: They will charge you if you waste food.  Simply eat what you can first, but this hasn't happen to me yet.

I ordered a Ying Yang pot which means you get to choose 2 broths and on the side of the menu it says $1.00 extra for additional ying yang broth.  So I chose Pork Bone and Clear Soup, when the bill came they charged $3.00 instead (not much but $$ is $$).  Apparently it's $1.00extra per person.

I love lamb so I probably ate 2 plates to myself. =P The chicken dumplings were pretty good too, and we got a very very nice plate of prime rib! The prime rib was really marbled; you know when the meat has a lot of marbling it means that it's good! Oh, and for dessert we had custard dumplings, about 2 plates of that, and it was really good! =)\n\nThe owner was really nice to us, very polite! The place was pretty empty when we got there, thank God, because I didn't want people to see me eat like a beast! =X Parking was an ease, I found parking right in front! Maybe I was lucky?

I will find something to eat with my jalapeno. \n\nI've eaten at Coriya hot pot and I like this place better but it is more pricey.

I saw others order pork blood cubes and intestines but I wasn't particularly in the mood for it at the time. \n\nWe ordered the spicy broth, pork, beef, won ton, fried fish balls, noodles and veggies. When our pot of soup was brought out, I saw a sea of red with dried chili peppers floating on the surface. It even stung my eye a little and I got excited. \n\nThe broth definitely tastes better about halfway into dinner - like any stew or soup, it gets better over time because the flavors are more concentrated especially with the flavors  of all the things you are adding to the soup. The broth was spicy but not mouth numbingly spicy.  At one point, I scooped from the bottom of the pot and grabbed a spoonful of pepper seeds- jackpot! \n\nI really enjoyed the pork. It was fatty but that's what made it so yummy. They were thinly sliced and when cooked in the spicy broth it reminded me of a spicy korean pork dish that I really like. \n\nAt the end of the meal, they bring out mini sesame balls with your check.

I come here once a week because it's still the only place -- out of dozens sampled -- that recalls blissful memories of my favorite hotpot dives in Shanghai.

I'm not a huge fan of hot pot places because in my opinion, if you're going to a restaurant, you should just go there to eat, not cook it yourself.  But that's just because I'm super lazy and I hate cooking in general.  However, this is all-you-can-eat with a two-hour time limit and I am a huge fan of massive amounts of food.  \n\nWe ordered the spicy broth (really spicy with about 35 red peppers thrown in) and the pork broth.  After burning my tongue on the spicy broth immediately and then having to wait a really really long time for the waiter to bring water, I ended up eating most of my food out of the pork broth.  The food was decent although I'd stick to meats and avoid the seafood (squid tasted really old or more fishy than it should taste).  The dumplings were good although when they brought them out they were frozen so you need to cook them a little bit longer.  Some of the things we asked for never came out either.\n\nThe only major thing lacking here is the service.  They are really nice but understaffed and the waiter actually asked that we give him some time.  They were serving several large parties and people have to be patient if they want their money's worth.  I would suggest thinking ahead and asking for extra napkins, spoons, bowls, forks, water all at once, otherwise you'll just be waiting a LONG time to get everything, which is what we did.  Hopefully their service will improve so I can give them more stars.", "author": "Stacey C."}

I remember the original soup base being a little on the bland side - not enough herbs/herbal flavor. All the other soups we had were good.\n\nThey offer many food items, including some dim sum items like milk-custard bun and cha-siu bun. In fact, the milk-custard and cha-siu buns were comparable with the ones you find in Hong Kong's hot point joints. Their beef was pretty tasty - we ordered A LOT of plates. They had a good veggies to meat ratio and you can keep ordering as long as you'd like.\n\nHonestly, they give you pretty good quality with the price they charge you.\n\nIs it better than Little Sheep? \nFood-wise, it's more or less the same since it's just a matter of freshness. \nSoup-base-wise, no.

Not because of turkey, cranberries, pumpkin pie or any of the other usual suspects. For me, Thanksgiving marks the start of huo guo  (hot pot) season at my mother-in-law's house. We are usually able to get at least three or four hot pot parties out of her a season and each one is a treat in itself.  Lately I have been fretting about this coming winter because my in-laws are going to be in Taiwan from October through February. We're going to be left out in the cold during hot pot season. What's a girl to do? \n\nI am happy to say that I have found a suitable alternative to my mother-in-law's house. After trying a handful of other wannabe hot pot places in the city, I have to admit, The Pots is a close second to my mother-in-law's. \n\nA group of colleagues and I caravanned out to the Sunset on a recent unusually sweltering Friday evening. Probably not the best day to slurp hot pot, but we had been planning and talking about it for four days and there was no backing out. We were committed. \n\nI walked in expecting a hole-in-the-wall joint and instead was greeted with a bright, cheery space with lots of tables and an army of servers waiting to meet our every hot pot need. \n\nFor you hot pot novices, The Pots is just for you. It's a set price per person ($25) for all you can eat. You have two hours to enjoy your hot pot, which by the way is plenty of time. If you're hungry at the end of your time, then you're not human. You will be given a sheet of paper and pen (much like a sushi place) which enables you to make your very own personalized hot pot. Ready, set, go! \n\nChoose your broth: choices include pork bone, cilantro and preserved egg, mala (spicy), beef bone or split pot where you can enjoy two different styles simultaneously. If you are like me and want it all, go for the split pot. \n\nChoose your food: thinly sliced raw meat, shrimp, fish balls, beef balls, vegetables, noodles, tofu, handmade dumplings are all choices. My suggestion is to check off every ingredient on the list. But hey, I'm a glutton. \n\nMake your dipping sauce: While you're waiting for your broth and accouterments to arrive, start concocting your personal sauce. The Pots offers soy sauce, chili paste, garlic, cilantro, vinegar and green onions. Mix to your own personal taste, but watch out for the garlic. That will stay with you for days! \n\nDo-it-yourself cooking: place everything in the broth pot and wait until they are cooked. Tip for the novice: put in the dumplings, lotus root and other things that take awhile to cook first. Things like spinach, meat and tofu are fast-cooking and won't take long. One of my colleagues (who will remain nameless) is what I call a \"Hot Pot Nazi\" and likes to clear out all the meat before cooking the vegetables, clear out the vegetables prior to the dumplings and so on and so on. Me? I'm a \"dumper\" and like to throw everything in at once and then nosh on the bounty of delectables. The choice is yours.  \n\nExtracting food: when your food is cooked to your taste, remove from the broth. Take the food with your chopsticks, drag it through your dipping sauce and chow down.\n\nWhat makes The Pots special? The quality and amount of traditional options is amazing. Things like tofu skin, whole shrimp, wood ear mushrooms, dumplings, gai lan, winter melon are all choices and that's only a small handful. \n\nThe thing that tipped me over the edge was the sweet dumplings. There was sweet taro and egg custard dumplings that seems a bit strange, but provided just a hint of sweetness at the end of the meal. \n\nIt's not as comfortable as my mother-in-law's dining room, but I have a feeling The Pots will get me through the winter months when I'm craving hot pot.", "author": "Lee H."}

I ended up here @ The Pot's.  Just a few blocks from where I stay .. woohoo!\n\nPLUS: The all you can eat (your only option here) menu is huge. You can pick from many different types of protein, seafood, dumplings, noodles, veggies, etc.  The cost for such a menu isn't so high either so its really a pretty good deal\n\nMINUS: Beef, dumplings, and many of the other items just weren't very good.  The beef in particular was very disappointing as it wasn't tasty at all, even cooked in the spicy broth.  The texture of the beef wasn't very appealing either.  If you're a lamb fan, the lamb is decent I suppose.  *shrug* maybe I've gotten spoiled by all the kobe, angus type marbled high quality beefs I get elsewhere.\n\nThe broth itself wasn't very good either. I would say the The Pot's is meant to be similar to Little Sheep out in San Mateo, and by that meter .. this place falls WAY short.  The broth is pretty boring and just doesn't do much like I would hope it would.\n\nService: So so.  They were responsive and walked around alot. But they often forget what you order.  We ordered rice as soon as we sat down, but 2 hours later, we never got it.  They said they had to make it .. ok? Simple item like rice isn't ready during primetime dinner hours?   I can forgive that I guess but they never did bring the rice and we just ended up annihilating double digit plates of meat instead.  Their loss! hahah\n\nSo I've definitely had better ( Shabu House, Little Sheep ), but this one falls below all others and sadly will be the one I won't be going back to.

I often come here with a large group of friends and we always get a private room.\n\nThe AYCE menu consists of a piece of paper which lists the numerous items you can add to your broth, and you just check off and indicate the quantity that you want.  They have a good selection of spicy and non-spicy broths to choose from.  Since I'm not one for spicy foods but like to truly enjoy the full flavor of all the ingredients, my favorite is the miso broth.  Once you add all the meat, dumplings, meatballs, seafood, noodles, and veggies, you have one darn good tasting broth!  The thin slices of prime rib and lamb are presented perfectly with the right amount of marble, and are very fresh.  The various dumplings, meatballs, and seafood are all tasty.  The even have the black and white fungus, as well as enoki mushrooms!  For the noodles, they have the thin egg noodles, the thin bean thread vermicelli, and the thicker udon noodles.  The texture of all are perfect.  The various greens are very fresh and, when simmered in your broth, very satisfying.  \n\nMy favorite dish, which should be enjoyed at the end of the meal, are the taro balls, a ground piece of light purple taro wrapped in a thin, slightly chewy noodle wrap.  After being heated in the broth for a few minutes, you have a perfectly sweetened ball of DELICIOUSNESS that just melts in your mouth!  An excellent dessert dumpling!\n\nThe prices for this AYCE hot pot are very reasonable:  $23 per person Sunday - Thursday and $25 on Friday and Saturday.  Be sure to only order what you can eat or you will be charged for any wastage.  For entertainment, they even have karaoke for those of you who want to show off your singing talents.\n\nOverall, The Pot's is a great value and with a group a friends, you will not only have an enjoyable, delicious meal but also a lot of fun!

The waiters were above and beyond helpful - even though they probably hate us.  We definitely broke even or even came out on top by the way we ordered.  You must get the buffet price ($22 Mon through Thurs, $25 Fri through Sun).\n\nThe decor is modern trendy - not Osha Thai fancy, but more of a middle ground between West Elm and Ikea.  It was clean, very high ceilings, a couple of dining areas, well light (maybe too bright?), and graciously very good ventilation.  \n\nThe food was actually above average - they give you a dim sum format menu and you pick away.  However, it proved to be inefficient, as once you start eating, you bark at the waiters.  Then they have a hard time remembering, since it's not written down.  They did eventually get your order, it just takes some time and reminding.  We ordered all sorts of meats, fish balls, minced meat balls (really good), veggies, and other home ingredients.  Some must orders were the yam noodles, the meatballs, the taro, the lotus, the won tons, and the lamb.  They were not stingy on the the orders at all and they brought it out without any glances.   Oh, don't forget the sesame balls at the end.\n\nI have to say the service was 5 star.  Really patient, cool, fast, and smiley.  They never curbed our orders nor complained.  I have to admit our table was definitely not shy about ordering.  At no point did they give us the evil eye.  The evil Chinese eye.  Oh how I hate THAT one.\n\nThey did lack on the sauces tho.  They provide hot sauce, satay (had to ask), garlic, cilantro, hot peppers, and green onions.  But that's about it.  I usually like peanut butter, sesame oil, peanuts, and other condiments, but they did not offer it.  I think they mimic more of a Mongolian hot pot?  Not too sure.   They have a dual pot bowl, but watch out, they tacked on an additional fee for it, so be sure to ask.  \n\nAnother thing was that they did not have a lot of seafood - perhaps why they were able to offer such low prices for the buffet.  But everything else was pretty fresh - meats came out cold / firm, veggies were snappy, the fishballs and other fish cake products were frozen.

The meat is thinly sliced with minimal fat and all the other stuff (fish balls, lettuce, catfish, and etc) taste like it was just bought.  They have over 5 flavors of soup and their burners are quite up to date.  It is all electronic\n\nSERVICE: Top Notch.  The owner is really attentive to your needs.\n\nHOURS: This place is open until 2am on Friday and Saturday.  Only in Asia do they open Hot Pot places that late.  OH yeah, they have VIP rooms...I think they even have Karaoke in the rooms.

As it is you order from a menu by placing slash marks next to what you want to eat, as in some sushi restaurants, and they deliver it to the table.\n\nThe way this works is, you are seated at a table with a hot plate on it.  You order a soup base from various options.  You can get a side-by-side of two soup bases for $1 extra.  We did that and got a clear soup base and a terrifically spicy Sichuan base.  Both were yummy.  You then use your chopsticks or a wire basket thing to place the uncooked items in the soup base and cook them to your personal preference, then dip them out and munch.  This is great fun and also delicious.\n\nGo when you're hungry and get the \"all you can eat\" option.  There are other possibilities, but this is the best value if you're going to really chow down.  There is a really interesting array of vegetables, dumplings, noodles, and meats.  There are also seafood and tofu options.

Service is a bit slow and MIA at times, as it takes a bit of prodding at the people working to bring out everything you ordered and we were constantly out of iced water. The place also gets pretty stuffy since they lack a true ventilation system. Regardless, it's a good deal and a fun experience with friends/family.\nHowever, it's probably a sign that I'm getting old, but for the rest of the night and the morning after eating at The Pot's, I suffered from a migraine from the MSG in their broth like a hangover ):. So beware if you have sensitivities to MSG. If anything, I'd recommend Little Fat Sheep in SM since I've never had any problems there.", "author": "Jen T."}

Being a recent transplant from Los Angeles, we don't always get the chance to have hot pot, mainly because it's never really that cold. But the good thing about SF, and outer sunset especially is that it's usually cold....even in the summer, which means i can have hot pot year round.\n\nWith that said, i'm a big fan of hot pot. It brings back good memories, and The Pot's is a place that definitely brings back those good memories. The service is amazingly friendly, especially for a Chinese all-you-can-eat place. The wait staff is very attentive and always smiling. Quite rare, but very appreciated. \n\nIn terms of the food, there is a nice variety of broths, fresh meats, seafood, and vegetables. I just wish there were more ingredients besides just garlic, chili sauce, green onions, and cilantro for when you customize your soy sauce. Other than that, the food is the standard fare for hot pot.\n\nIf the price was cheaper, i'd be frequenting The Pot's regularly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-26", "description": "Being one that only had hot pot at home and likes to cook, I never really had the urge to try places that served hot pot. It's nothing special and I like doing it at home w/family & friends since it's more cozy. My bf's sis had a huge craving hot pot since she was feeling sick and told us of this place where it's all-you-can-eat hot pot for around $20-25 and that she really enjoyed it. I had a friend in town so I thought it'd be a great way to kill two birds w/one stone: satisfy my bf's sis' craving and hang out w/a friend of ours. Since my friend eats a lot, I was certain that it would be money well spent as well and boy was I right!\n\nWe went on a weekday so parking wasn't too bad for us (luckily we found parking right in front!) because that area is very notorious for having troubles in finding parking on the weekends (or holidays). The place on the outside really doesn't look like much, but the inside is quite cozy and warm.\n\nThe selection they have is pretty good and fresh. They even have a special menu that you pay for additional items to put in such as scallops, oysters, chicken feet, etc. but unless you have to have them, what they have set for the all-you-can-eat is pretty good to satisfy everyone's tastes. And whenever you need to order more food, you just ask for another menu. After ordering, they bring out the soy sauce (which is slightly sweet and tastes great for dipping) and the basket of condiments to enhance your sauce that consists of red chili sauce, garlic, green onion, and cilantro. You can add as much (or as little) as you want, but be sure to taste and have it the way you like it because they take the basket away as soon as the food arrives.\n\nOk so onto what we ordered. For our broth, we picked the pork bones since that's what we are most familiar with. Our pick for veggies: bok choy and  lettuce (too full to get the chinese broccoli). For noodles we had the bean vermicelli and the taro noodles. Meats were the slices pork and beef. We had one order of hot links but they were too spicy for us (for health reasons we can't eat the stuff). For dumplings we ordered shu mai (which were decent, nothing extraodinary), stuffed shrimp balls (shrimp balls w/fish egg inside), and the custard. Our favorites were the stuffed shrimp balls and the custard dumplings. We had to keep ordering those cuz we all loved them! We also had an order of pork liver, tofu and the enoki mushrooms wrapped w/beef. For dessert we each had a sesame ball w/red bean inside (which is automatically given to you at the end of your meal).\n\nService was alright. It was pretty busy so we had to remind our waiters to bring us the stuff we asked, but they were usually pretty quick. You just gotta keep in mind that they have to juggle a lot of things at a time.\n\nThe only real issue I had was that after you start cooking, and your soup base gets low, they re-fill it with hot water which waters down all the flavors and doesn't taste as good. So I suggest getting all the real good stuff eaten before the broth is re-filled with the water.\n\nOverall we had a great time and definitely got our money's worth. We didn't feel guilty eating all that food either since it's all either seafood or lean meat. And everything's boiled! Best decision we made! Will definitely make another trip when we have friends visiting. ^_^b", "author": "Kitty K."}

The location of this restaurant is odd but it's perfect for it's neighborhood. I like how the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom is also spacious and clean which is a total plus for chinese restaurants. Went around 7:15 on a Friday night and luckily there was no wait. Restaurant is pretty big with two private rooms for karaoke (very interesting). During dinner you will often hear obnoxious loud noises coming from those rooms with people cracking up their voices, annoying but funny at the same time. \nThere are many broths to choose from, i recommend at least getting half portions of the spicy broth. $25 all you can eat. Their menu is pretty simple and it has almost all the ingredients that you usually eat at a hotpot so it's really nice. Some things aren't as fresh so be sure you check them prior to eating it. soft drinks are free and make sure you order yourself some sweet custard balls at the end of the meal. It's totally weird but tasty at the same time. If you prefer not to eat them salty/sweet, you can always wash them in your teacups after cooking. delishhhh:D \nOverall it was great.

I came here once for a friend's birthday and didn't know what to expect. It's probably cause we all drank before coming here and I was pretty buzzed. We had a large group so they connected 3 tables together with 3 pots. Our table got spicy and regular soup bases. We then ordered a bunch of meat, vegetables (to help with constipation), and noodles (fillers). Everything in the spicy soup based tasted like lava because the thats what the soup must've been made out of. It usually takes me a few moments to register if something is spicy or not but when I had this soup base, my tongue was on FIRE. It didn't help that they put little peppers in here that burst with spiciness when you bite into them. Lava aside, the food was actually pretty decent. I suppose it depends if your a good cook but everything seemed fresh which is a plus. The only problem is that if your with a big group they don't keep track of what you ordered! I think our table ordered a bunch of meat and we never got it because the waiter kept giving it to the table next to us. Thats probably the reason why we got balls at our table even though we didn't order them. I don't know what kind of balls they were but they had a chewy texture and exploded in your mouth when you bit into them....I'm not a huge fan of balls that explode in my mouth but these were decent.\n\nI need to come back here again when I'm sober and hungry but I'm pretty sure I would still like this place.

My friend and I got the spicy soup base which is pretty good .. it's actually kind of spicy hehe . The beef , fried tofu , etc . were all pretty good . I got one of their drinks .. I don't know what it's called in english but I think it's some kind of herbal tea . It's good to drink during hot pot because hot pot can be unhealthy . And since the herbal tea is good for you , it balances out hehe :) The herbal tea was really good .. it was semi-sweet which was perfect . They have a big screen with chinese music videos as music . I think I also saw a karaoke room .. not quite sure .", "author": "Eileen L."}

However...\n\nFood- The shrimp, beef, fish ball were frozen like rocks. Not much selection.\n\nPrice- Came out very expensive and not full at all!\n\nService- What service???? Food came very very slow. We were boil soup most of the time. Where's are beef????? Its all you can eat, if your luck they put in any of your orders.\n\nEvents- So it was a friend's b-day dinner, after a not so full dinner, we requested them to bring out the cake (At least we can get full off of that). We were expecting them to at least light a candle and do the b-day thing that all restaurants do. Well....they just brought out the cake in the box and bag that it came in and say\" here you go, we put some paper plates and folks in the bag for you. We were like what the heck!!! What an awkward moment for us and the b-day girl. We ended up taking the cake to another location to enjoy. This is a place all 9 of us will not go to again.!!!", "author": "Katt C."}

They give you the option of using a half or full soup base (good thing I had that option because the spicy soup base nearly killed me). You get a list to customize what you want in your meal. I went crazy ticking almost the whole list because, well, it's an all-you-can-eat meal. And at $24.99 per person, it serves me right to be so reckless.

We ended up ordering food three times because we knew it would take a while.  Ended up repeating most dishes the 3rd time.  We picked a broth that sounded like a soup and one that was spicy.  Neither stood out so I think the \"plain\" version might've been better since they charged extra for the speciality broths.  They also charged extra for chicken the night we were there (I thought that was crazy).\n\nWe had our infant son with us so I don't remember much else.

Both rooms and ALL the tables (minus one  that had no chairs) was filled. All the waitresses were running around bringing food items out, refilling drinks, clearing tables .... *repeat, repeat, repeat*... thought it was a little odd that there's no host or hostess or even a cash register person (yes they don't have a cash register in front but i hope you get my drift) to greet you or acknowledge that you even are alive inside. All the waitresses pretty much ignore you since they are so busy serving their seated customers that they cannot greet you at all. Ok, fine. No greeting. So we wait about 15 min or so and a table clears out. Takes them about another 10 minutes to clean and set up the new table. However, they do not seat us. Everyone is so busy serving their customers no one takes us to the table to be seated, so we continue to just stand there... *crickets*..... finally my friend caught a waitress and was like \"is that our table\" and so the waitress nods and walks us over. \n\nAnyways, after that whole waiting fiasco we got our paper and started marking with a fury. We realize this isn't a typical restaurant where they come by every so often to check on you, so we start waving our completed paper in the air and one waitress cleaning the table gives us the head nod. We finally figured out how the service works here! After 5-10 min or so they bring out our pot, we chose the hot spicy one, and we begin the feeding frenzy. Had tons of food: beef, pork, chicken, tofu, variety of veggies, dumplings, etc etc... had to remind the waitress to give us ladles, soup spoons and bowls... and then we got into our groove. We ended up eating two plates of the meats and veggies. I didn't like how I kept eating the pepper balls... the broth was an interesting taste that reminded me of a \"spa\"... The food was plentiful and my other friend drank a lot of the soup. \n\nAll in all we finished everything and left full. Not sure if I'd come back only because the service was a little spotty but the place was definitely packed.", "author": "Julie F."}

The all-you-can-eat was perfect...but I'm glad to see they have a \"$17 for two people\" deal for people who don't eat that much.  Got the pork bone soup following the waitress' recommendation - super yummy.  Depending on how adventurous I feel, I might try the spicy soup next time...which was also recommended.  I like that the soup is flavorful but they still give you sauce with cilantro, green onions, garlic, and hot sauce to make as you see fit.  The meat (lamb and beef) was really good (I liked the lamb better than the beef) and they gave you plenty of vegetables.  Like I said...all you can eat!  The service was a little slow, but there were only two people serving the entire place so I think I can give them a little slack.

Everything went smoothly and I even confirmed the day of to make sure my reservation was still good before I confirm with all my friends who where coming from San Jose and Berkeley. I called The Pots and this lady told me that everything was fine and that our reservation was still good and \" see you tonight.\"  So I thought everything was fine as she stated, then about 30 minutes before our reservation time the same lady calls me as I'm driving to them and tells me that they can't honor my reservation unless I pay more because they have someone else that wants our reservation time. So basically, they wanted to push me out of my reservation even though I had made my reservation a week ahead, its 30 minutes before all my friends from San Jose and Berkeley arrive, and if I won't budge then I have to pay for 15 people's all u can eat even though I only have 12....SHAMEFUL!

This restaurant is hot pot only and no grill. You can choose to order by plate or all you can eat for about 20-25 + tax depending what day of the week you go on. Keep in mind if you choose all you can eat, there is a 2 hour limit. We started our meal quite slowly since our soup refused to boil, but after 20 mins we discovered we were actually out of gas. I suggest when eating here when ordering, to order a bit more than you think you need because the portions are related to the number of guests. So if you are a party of 8...you will get 8 shrimps. In addition, keep track of your meat orders. We got all our vegetables, dumplings and meat balls but the meat never came. We had to reorder with the waiter. The best part of the meal though was the dessert custard and taro balls. I did find it strange that you just toss them into the salty broth, but it gave it only a slight saltiness that balanced the sweetness from the filling (an method often used with cakes, cookies and candy).
