I ordered the pork katsu curry with extra mushrooms ($2.5) and cheese ($1.5) and the hubs ordered the pork and tomato which makes the dish taste more like hayashi rice than curry. I wasn't a huge fan of that particular dish but I can't recommend the curry more. The spicy here is not that spicy. I might try the Volcano level spice next time. \n\nIt's mostly self service, you order at the counter, you get your own utensils and water and you bus the plates, but they'll bring the actual food to you. \n\nI wish this place was closer but it definitely hits the spot and I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Eunah T."}

There are many solid restaurants serving ramen or sushi rolls, but unfortunately very difficult to find a decent curry or bento places. \n\nService is self-serving, hence you need to get your own utensils, napkins, and water after ordering, although they bring the foods to your table! In terms of ambience, it would not be a good place for your date night as it is VERY casual with food-court style tiles. \n\nI ordered chicken katsu curry with boiled egg as a topping (extra charge). The curry sauce was thick and had a deep flavor, but that was about it. I wish they had more vegetables (more potatoes and carrots), along with your choice of meat. I wish they had something special that distinguished them from other curry restaurants - could have hamburg meat or even croquettes or musubi for appetizers. \n\nIf I had lived near the area, I think it would have been a great takeout place.

So, for her to go on and on about someone else's curry is high praise.  We eat a lot of hot Korean food and while she had no problem with the \"hot\" spicy level, she said she'd prefer medium.   I had the kara-age plate. Nicely cooked, lightly seasoned, crispy and good taste, though I was not blown away as she was. Kids had noodle soup with chicken which they woofed down -- which is the same as high praise, coming from them. \n\nWhile Geary has definitely gotten more expensive than it deserves in recent years, Volcano's prices are reasonable.

It doesn't have to be fancy, or over the top, but just good food that comforts the soul . \n\nIt's a small shop where you order at the register. If you're coming here for the first time, I'd have to say getting the chicken katsu curry is the way to go. It's their most popular item and for good reason. \n\nThey serve a heaping portion of curry (coming with 4 different spiciness levels) with the katsu on top of a bed of rice. There's a few pieces of potatoes and carrots that kind of give it a bit of a stew element. \n\nIf you're good with spice, I'd say the \"hot\" is pretty mild. I'm interested in trying the volcano spice (hottest) as hot wasn't quite spicy enough for me! \n\nThe curry is quite filling, especially with the rice and potatoes. I inhaled my food and am currently going through a food coma. \n\nThis was so delicious for a chilly evening and exactly what I had been craving (I just didn't know it yet!). The curry is a tad bit soupy, which would be my only comment, but it didn't take away from me thoroughly enjoying my meal!\n\nSeating is limited, but food comes out fast so tables clear out fairly quickly.

None of the curry flavor was stewed into it. \n\nAgreeably, all of us were put off by the fact that the potatoes and carrots that were included in the curry were still pretty crunchy and hard (not typical of vegetables included in curry) and had none of the flavor of the curry seeped into it; meaning that the vegetables were probably just tossed in at the end. \n\nThere are much better Japanese curry options out there that are worth the price.", "author": "Ann T."}

I felt my husband's & son's dishes looked better. I did like the curry, that was tasty. My husband & son really enjoyed their dishes as well.

It's really a travesty that there aren't more Japanese curry places in San Francisco. \n\nI ordered the pork katsu for $9.95, and I got it spicy but I wasn't asked how spicy I wanted it, so I have no idea how spicy it actually was. There's probably like 12 tables in the restaurant, and they were all full on a Saturday night around 6:30 PM. It's kind of awkward when you do get a table and there are people standing and just staring at you. But such is eating out in San Francisco.\n\nThe food came out in roughly 12 minutes, and it was definitely a sizeable portion. The entire plate was covered, half with rice and half with curry. But when I looked at it, it looked like a sick joke. Where were the vegetables? There were 3 small chunks of potato, and 3 small chunks of carrot. How much are they really saving by skimping on the cheapest vegetables known to man? \n\nThe pork katsu had a nice and crunchy coating, but the thinly sliced pork was a little overcooked and tough. The vegetables didn't really have that melt-in-your-mouth texture that is characteristic in good curries either; they were pretty bland and unexciting. The curry was decent and not overly salty, and there was definitely some heat that tasted kind of like Tapatio. There were some pickled onions below the pork which I wasn't a huge fan of. Unfortunately, the star of the dish was the rice, which was admittedly really well cooked and had a great texture. \n\nUltimately, my meal tasted uninspired, and it was just made much worse by the laughable portion of vegetables on the plate. It looks like a pretty large portion when you first get it, but since half the plate is literally just sauce, it's not even that filling of a meal.

I get medium and it is perfect for me. It has just a little bit of a kick, but I'm not guzzling water like a dog locked in a hot car. \n\nThe place is super casual. You pay the lady, grab utensils and a glass of water, and seat yourself. You clean up after yourself too. The instructions for disposal at the trashcan are pretty detailed so no room for confusion (please don't be that person). The bathroom can be pretty sketch though.\n\nBTW, you don't need a plate of curry to order toppings. If you wanted, you could just order several toppings and have yourself a little appetizer sampler. Not suggesting it though. I went that route once, and once was enough.", "author": "Kim W."}

It was spicy, but not so spicy that I couldn't eat it anymore. The chicken to bread crumb ratio was also way off. There was a lot more Panko than chicken. Another thing weird was the curry wasn't hot, but lukewarm. I also got a mini chicken sandwich for $2.25.

I think we circled around for about 30 minutes before finding a spot 3-4 blocks away, and by that time, that pho place was almost closed. Yelp came to the rescue and suggested Volcano nearby, so we thought we'd give it a try. We were also super hungry, so food in general sounded good lol.\n\nSince this was a curry place, I figured I would get curry. I had a sore throat, so I was contemplating either the normal chicken curry or the katsu (since crunchy things might scratch my throat), but I opted for the katsu anyways because katsu is delish haha.\n\n- Chicken katsu curry: this was so delicious I can't even explain. I'm so glad I went with my heart and got the chicken katsu because the chicken was so tender and the coating was perfectly thin and crispy. The only thing is that there wasn't very much vegetables/potatoes (it looked a bit sad in the curry sauce that covered half the plate). Nevertheless, the curry itself was decent, but it's really the chicken katsu that was hands down the best thing on the plate. I got hot for spice level, but I think I could have tried volcano (the spiciest) hehe.

It was unlike anything I have ever tasted.  It was creamy, and sweet, and a little bit salty.  \n\nThe only downside to this place are the potatoes, carrots, and the egg.  The potatoes and carrots would taste a lot better if they were cooked longer.  They tasted raw and crunchy, which was not pleasant.  I wish they offered fried eggs instead of boiled eggs.

I haven't had japanese curry since I was in Japan a year ago, so I was excited!!\n\nParking in this area is always a nightmare. What ever spot you see... TAKE IT!!!\n\nThe restaurant is rather small. It could probably seat about 25-30 people. It looks a little old inside, but most of the time, its the hole in the wall restaurants that serve the best food. \n\nThe service was all right. Basic service for what you get at a quick eatery. \n\nThere wasn't a line when we walked in, so I was able to scope out the menu. I played it safe and got the pork katsu curry volcano (I like it spicy!), and added a fried shrimp and potato croquette (it was recommended). Both of my friends ordered the chicken katsu curry medium. One added potato croquette and the other added sausage. We grabbed water cups and seats.\n\nWhen our food came it looked and smelled soooooo good. While I was taking my typical food picture, one of my friends said that his curry was way too spicy for medium, so I tasted mines comparing it to his. I think they accidentally swapped our plates, so we asked them just to make sure. The girl suspects they might have had a mix up too. No biggie, we switched plates. Then he begins to eat again, but now he says that it wasn't chicken (which is what he ordered). We assumed it was the pork I ordered, so we asked the girl again to double check... which one is the chicken and which is pork. She explained to us that the chicken is longer in length, so we switched the meat on our plates. It was starting to get frustrating. My friend then asked how many sausage comes with a side order because the price he paid was too much for just ONE. She looked at him confused, and said its suppose to come with TWO. She apologizes for all the mishaps, and offers to fix it by bringing him another sausage. She even asked if there was anything else we wanted, so that she could give it to us on her. It wasn't her fault, so that was nice of her to offer, but we were fine. A few minutes later she brings out the sausage. Then my other friend notices that we didn't get any pickles. I my friend if she was certain all plates come with pickles, and she was certain because she loves the pickles with her curry, and she always has it without having to ask. We told the girl again, and she was so shocked with everything that was wrong with our orders! She apologized again for all of the mess ups, but at this point I just wanted to eat and go...\n\nFood was pretty good. I knew going in that it wouldn't be anything like Japan, but it does the job. I preferred the fried shrimp over the pork katsu. I was never a fan of potato croquettes, and I'm still not. My friend really likes it, so I gave mines to her. If I ever go back, I'd try the fried oyster curry.\n\nThis was my first time here, and my experience wasn't so great. I hope that it was just a off day, but even that was the case... isn't okay because who knows how many first timers walk in there? They might just think that's how the business is and not come back.

I like spicy but I don't think I'll ever be able to try volcano level of spicy. My friend tried it and he remained red the whole time he was eating lmao the portions are just the right amount and I had a lot to take home and heat up for later. Usually the place is kind of like a self serve kind of arrangement where you place an order in the counter and you get a number, sit down, they take you your food, you finish and put your dirty dishes in a bin close to the door.

The menu offers different curry dishes, ~$8-$9, with 4 levels of spiciness. Additional toppings, such as egg, cheese, and spam, are $1-$2, so that can quickly add up. They also have sandwich & noodle soup options, as well as rice plates sans curry. Japanese curry is my idea of comfort food, so obviously I ordered their main attraction.\n\nChicken Katsu Curry w/ carrots, potatoes & pickled ginger over rice:\nThe tasty curry sauce was savory with a mild sweetness, so flavor was there, but the consistency was on the thin side. I am more accustomed to thicker, creamier Japanese curries. The consistency of the sauce didn't bother me, since I always mix rice into the curry for flavor. I went with medium spicy. I enjoy spicy flavors, but I'm not great at handling super spicy food. Japanese curry is usually very mild in terms of heat, so medium was just right for me.\nThere was a good-sized portion of crispy, crunchy chicken. The carrots and potatoes were stewed to a very soft texture, but there were only 3 pieces of carrots and 3 pieces of potatoes. I could definitely have used some pickles or zucchini to add some crunch. Oh well, maybe next time. \n\nA Japanese curry house is just what this block needs, or just what I need when I want something quick and filling. Food is tasty & relatively inexpensive, and service is quick. Though they have a low inspection score, the space was rather clean and bright.

Well let me tell you a little story if you do.\n\nIt had been less than 24 hours since I had returned from a short-ish Japanese vacation. It was raining in the city, but it didn't bother me any. Tokyo Novembers are frighteningly cold. I mean, it snowed one day. Also, that earthquake. What did bug me was the parking. Always with the parking! Anyway, 'what's with the low rating' you may ask?\n\nMy time at Volcano has so far been my worst experience since coming back. The irony here, of course, is that Volcano is a Japanese restaurant. I kinda feel bad calling it Japanese. Nothing about it says Japanese to me. \n\nI ordered 2 mini sandwiches to go: Karaage and sausage. Sadly, they were mostly bread. And incredibly boring. I'm more than sure that Guy Fieri on quaaludes could come up with better sandwiches. They were just the paltry amounts of protein and then bread. Maybe some mayo and a shred of cabbage? Ultimately, the food sucked and was not Japanese in the most diluted sense of the word. \n\nKaraage was beyond wack and the sausage was unappealing and didn't taste very fresh. Why bother putting shite on your menu? It doesn't make any sense. Also, it took like 15 minutes for them to be ready. 2 mini sandwiches? 15 minutes? I don't know, man. I came in a few times to see if it was ready, but no dice. \n\nThe supervisor was kind enough to bring out my order. I was a little confused when she brought out a little plastic box of food for me in the rain. I asked about the plastic bag for which I had paid. \n\nShe didn't seem to care much. So I wondered out loud what the heck was wrong with people. I guess she didn't like that too much because I waited another 3 minutes before I realized that she had no intention of bringing me back my order with my plastic bag. \n\nI was even more confused about the heck was wrong with people. Why bring out my order initially and then not bring it out when you realize that you made a mistake? \n\nAnd then when I called her out on it inside, she couldn't even have been more unapologetic. It was pretty unbelievable. Why work in the customer service industry if you don't care about someone's customer service experience?\n\nRemember that irony thing? She was training a new hire. Hilarious! Why is she training people!?\n\nIt took less than 24 hours for me to have a inexcusably poor customer service experience in my own backyard thanks to Volcano. \n\nSure, sure. I didn't have their curry, which is their whole deal. And I suppose I never will now due to this experience. Which is probably a blessing in disguise based duly on some of the reviews of people IN THE KNOW and my recent trip to Japan. And if their karaage is an indicator of their \"Japanese food,\" then I have no business testing out anything else. \n\nAlso, more irony.

Volcano does the curry sauce amazingly, and everything that covers it: rice, potatoes, carrots, protein, you name it tastes so good smothered in it. My one \"beef\" is that they just covered the beef/carrots/tomato with curry sauce, whereas at previous places, the food is actually cooked in the curry, at least for a little bit! There were about 4 pieces of potatoes, and 5 pieces of carrots, but plenty of meat! The texture of everything was perfect.

I got some mild curry with beef and was disappointed and underwhelmed. Took the L for the money I paid and didn't come back for 2 years...\n\nWell I'm back 2 years later and I shit you not, my boyfriend and I come here every weekend. We always each get the chicken Katsu curry with extra veggies and they are ALWAYS consistently delicious! First of all, the katsu is perfection. Crunchy outside, juicy chicken on the inside. Cover/dip that in the curry and I swear your eyes will roll back from how delicious it is. They give you a lot of curry and rice and, in the event you don't finish, it's just as delicious as leftovers. I will say that as a personal preference, spending the $3-4 for extra veggies is a necessity if you like veggies in your curry. Considering how much food you get in all, and how bomb it always is, it's well worth the price and the parking wars that you'll face if you drive there. My advice about that is to call 15 min ahead and order to go. It helps if you have someone else driving so you can just jump out and run in. Otherwise, be prepared to pay meter if you have no luck finding parking on one of the avenues.\n\nOverall, highly recommend eating here, particularly if you get what I get (as that's what I can speak on).", "author": "Pearl L."}

I simply LOVE Volcano. It is my go-to spot for Japanese curry in SF, albeit I have not tried every single curry joint but the few places I've graced, Volcano takes the crown. It was also a supporter during my Baker Beach afternoon daycation: http://www.yelp.com/biz/baker-beach-san-francisco?hrid=WvnrHvkA48ogH7uph9LhnQ\n\nI've never opted to eat in the dining area because I was always eager to take to-go with a handy cup of Sharetea Oolong Tea Crema boba to the beach with me.

Call me a romanticist if you must! \n\nThe katsu is light and crisp, same goes for their vegetables. I don't know if they have GOT Daenerys' baby dragons back there blowing some fire, but I swear, deep fry to PERFECTION. What do the kids say nowadays? On fleek? Volcano got through with a clutch? Haha. \n\nRice is also supple and moist, never had a bad grain. If you order the simplest basic (like me), you get chopped pieces of fried chicken katsu, carrots, potatoes, and red pickles topped with their drizzling super secret curry sauce. It's so flavorful with the right amount of spices. Distinct from Indian or Thai curries, but subtle in its powerful creaminess like the humble Japanese people :) And of course better than any store-bought powder/liquid ish, blargh. RIP college days.

The menu is pretty simple - choose whether you want noodles or rice with your curry, then choose your meat and spicyness level. I chose \"hot\" which is just one step below \"volcano\". It was very spicy but not inedible, just right for me. My boyfriend got \"medium\" which was pretty mild in my opinion and seemed a bit sweeter. The veggies were simple, just carrots, onions and potatoes which is pretty standard. I thought the veggies could be seasoned a bit more as they were soft and bland. The curry itself was delicious, although a tad on the watery side. Each bite was addicting though and I felt like I couldn't stop eating it. The portions are also quite large and is very affordable at around $10 per plate. The inside doesn't have too much seating so I can imagine it getting crowded during popular hours.

The pictures and description (especially the \"of Japan\" part) sound authentic, but it wasn't as explosively mind-blowing as we had expected.\n\nWe got the chicken katsu curry, a little under $10. The katsu was very good, with a thin layer of crispy golden panko--one of those moments when you discover fried food that's actually fresh and not pre-made and frozen and bland. The curry seemed better than the box ones with their a guilt-tripping dose of salt and MSG. From taste alone though it's not all that noticeable, so it wasn't until I found out from their website about how they cook it for at least 8 hours, that I was able to fully appreciate the homemadeness.\n\nKatsu and curry aside, everything else fell a bit short of our unreasonably high expectaions for Asian food (along with my perfectionist inner Yelper). The curry didn't seem to be cooked long enough with the veggies, so the flavor didn't sink in to the potatoes and carrots, and the rice was dry. Also, the ambiance had too much of a casual chain feel and some of the decor was bizarre (though quite entertaining).\n\nTip: It's difficult to comment on the spiciness. In general it seems very mild (we got level 3: hot because level 4: volcano sounded frightening, and the hot level was quite mild).

However, I am giving this place only 3 stars due to the fact that they are heavy on the rice and not much else. The cutlet you will get when ordering katsu (I've had both the chicken and pork) is on the smaller side, and they will really skimp you on the vegetables. Even when ordering the add-on of extra veggies (3.50+, rip-off) you get maybe an extra scoop with squash added. Other reviewers have posted photos on here complaining of the same thing, and they are accurate.

It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and looks too good to be eaten. What about a brownish goop of Japanese curry that looks like your fur baby's big dump? Oh Lordy! This is one rare instance when a gastronomic delight should not be tainted by your visual perception. Have you ever tried Japanese curry? Believe it or not, curry along with ramen, are considered the national dishes of Japan far more than sushi or even miso. Every Japanese absolutely adores curry (or kare).  It is cheap, easy to make, wholesome and irresistible! Can't think of anything else that can beat that!\n\nHaving said that, it is surprisingly hard to find good Japanese style curry houses here in the US whereas sushi places abound. In SF, we have a few places to choose from one of which is Volcano on Geary. We dropped in the other day later in the afternoon to avoid the crowd and to satisfy my cravings. Curry is always eaten with rice and with Western style fork and spoon. The curry base is usually made of meat (beef, chicken, pork, shrimp) and veggies (carrots, potatoes, onions) although noodles (udon) and bread (pan) are available in Volcano as well. The menu is quite simple. It is basically just curry over rice (white or brown) and you pick the heat level from \"mild\" to \"volcano\". Pork Katsu Curry ($8.50) is my favorite and perhaps their best seller. Pork katsu (or tonkatsu) is pork breaded with panko (bread crumbs) and fried to a golden brown. I was surprised the meat didn't dry out even though lean meat was used. Kudos to the chef! My wife ordered the Chicken Karaage Curry ($8.50) that came in 4 good-sized pieces. Karaage is the Japanese version of fried chicken. It had a dense crunchy texture but I preferred my tonkatsu being more flavorful.\n\nThere were some side orders to go with the curry and Fukuzinzuke ($1.25) was a must. Most Japanese can't enjoy curry without it. This was a bright red, sweet and savory pickle.  A major disappointment was the absence of \"rakkyo\", a white shallot pickled in sweet vinegar.\n\nOverall, Volcano's curry was sweet, savory, fragrant and rich. If I were the judge in the race for the best Japanese curry in SF, Volcano gets the silver. The gold will go to Tani's Kitchen in Daly City.", "author": "Geoff G."}

The breading of the chicken katsu is really crispy and the chicken isn't dry. Medium is a pretty good spice level. It's not too spicy to the point where my nose is running and I'm dying of thirst, but you could definitely feel the heat. The curry is so flavorful! The spices are incredibly strong, but in a good way. It also comes with potatoes and carrots that aren't too mushy. Serving size is pretty generous. I was stuffed and had a little bit left over for a really small meal or snack.", "author": "Tara T."}

Besides Volcano, Muracci's, JapaCurry & Kare-ken come to mind as the only specialty shops. It's kind of boggling that Curry House (from House) or Coco Ichibanya (world's largest Japanese curry chain) haven't established a shop in SF yet.\n\nI don't believe Volcano is a chain from Japan but either way, something was lost in translation here. Their pork katsu was not breaded well and too oily. The medium spiced curry itself was average tasting, with no specific kick or distinctness to stand out from the standard. The sauce was more watery than thick and there wasn't enough curry to cover the whole plate with the other toppings, doing it wrong!\n\nA good thing about Volcano is that the default curry gets served with the traditional soft potatoes and carrots which usually isn't found as a default option at larger Japanese curry chains since you have to add it on. I personally found the potatoes and carrot lacking in flavor probably because they weren't directly cooked with the curry. \n\nThere's better katsu curry choices in the city, skip!", "author": "Steven C."}

WHAAA?! At a quarter century, we sought to rectify this situation. Volcano Curry was okay, but I think I prefer Muracci's in Financial District.\n\nFirst of all - the portions are huge. Like, pre-ask for a take out container. I ate about 50%, then like a goat that doesn't know when to quit, continued and ate the rest. Let's say the rest of the night was a lot of belly hugging. I love my belly. My belly sometimes doesn't love me.\n\nI had the hot (level 3) Chicken Karaage curry with zucchini and eggplant added on. I felt like too much of a fatass to order an egg too, but those eggs were hardboiled to perfection. Like, legit, one of my friends works at a Michelin star restaurant, and he agreed. \n\nAs a spicy lover...I think I should have gone with the 2x or 3x volcano (there's a 3x!). I wasn't sure how spicy it was, so defaulted on just hot. Hot...is like a normal curry spice for me. I tasted my friend's volcano, and it was spicier. But...not spicy with depth of flavor. Just felt like they added a dash of something for the spice. BUT! It was still a better spice than \"spicy.\" \n\nThe Chicken Karaage was about 4 giant pieces of dark meat chicken, breaded and fried. Yum. Zucchini and eggplant were both fried, and pretty good (juicy). The curries also come with some potatoes (cooked separately from the curry...weird), and slivers of pickled radish.\n\nOverall, I'd say this place was good, but not quite at 3 stars. The other reason it was weird is because of service. You HAVE to order before sitting (which is totally cool), but you CAN'T bus your own table, or bus a dirty table to sit down at. The ONE wait staff does it...and as she took the orders, cleaned the tables, and brought food out...it was a little much for the wait. Then again, the place can only seat about 20 people, so...I suppose it's not that bad.", "author": "Lily W."}

It was the spiciest food I have tried. Their udon is great to and it is a pretty healthy meal. I wouldn't suggest the vegetable curry because it taste like they only boiled the vegetables instead of stewing it with the curry. I would have given it a 5 star if they had stewed it to infuse the curry flavor, instead of a plain tasting carrot or potato.

My boyfriend tried it without me and told me how good it was, that he \"killed it in 5 minutes.\" I'm like wow, that's pretty impressive. So I decided to come and try it out today and I'm so happy that I did! \n\nThe menu is a bit extensive but variety is good! So you choose the curry that you want, the spice level (mild, medium, hot, volcano), and any toppings you want to add. My bf and I both got the katsu curry in hot but he got eggplant while I got the potato croquette. Let me tell you, the first bite I was like \"it's alright\" but as I kept eating it, the more delicious it became. The katsu was standard but the curry was so flavorful and spicy. It was the type of spicy where it burned... But it burned so good! The potato croquette was a nice touch and the eggplant turned out to really work well with the curry. But my absolute favorite would be the Japanese pickles! They're sweet, so when paired together with the curry, you get a sweet and spicy and savory burst of flavor in your mouth. So delicious! Each plate came out around $10 if you decide to add on a topping. \n\nThe service is prompt and friendly! It's more like a serve yourself restaurant where you get your own utensils, water, and put your plates away. The only time the server helps you is when taking your order and serving you your food. So if you want to tip, tip when you pay at the front. \n\nThis place is really good, definitely recommend!", "author": "Brenda K."}

Even when busy its usually not more than a 10 min wait and a free table may be available for you to sit at.\n\nSimple review here: I love spicy food but I stick with the \"medium\" spice level at Volcano. Volcano's curry doesn't have spice at the beginning of tasting like many spicy foods; it's that spice that creeps up and just heats up your mouth at the end. Even though I like to sweat from spicy food sometimes, I believe I'll stick with medium from here on as it lets me just enjoy the other flavors of the food better at Volcano.\n\nHighs:\n-Portion of protein is generous, beautifully cut, and cooked to *perfection*\n-Rice is nicely cooked and with lovely sticky texture\n-Tofu nuggets have a few edamame inside (fried)\n-Availability of fukujinzuke pickle  (!You must have this with Japanese curry to balance flavor and texture! Really, don't skip it!)\n-Spam (also fried) is tasty\n\nLows:\n-The price of all the little add ons, (like the pickle, nugets, Jalapenos and anything else) can make the meal a bit pricey.\n-Not many vegetable options if you want a \"balanced\" meal \n-Curry sauce ( of all spice levels ) is surprisingly not the highlight; in fact a little refinement/ creativity in this area could improve this little restaurant to be stellar.\n-Volcano spice level simply added heat/burning over the medium level of spiciness, not really a flavor element.\n\nPro Tips:\n-Don't skip fukujinzuke pickle.\n-They have a \"secret\" Double Volcano level of spiciness if you dare.\n-ShareTea (update: now TeaOne) bubble tea is a few stores down; If you can fit all that food in your belly then a nice boba is a cool accompaniment to your curry.\n\nTake away:\nI like Volcano, and I'll likely go back many more times.

I love that she asks people to order prior to sitting down because it is only fair for the people that are in line waiting to place order and eating there. \n\nlots of college kids there because it is close to a college housing complex. good pricing on the food.", "author": "Jules L."}

However, when my dish arrived, I took a bite out of the shrimp and it immediately fell apart, both in my mouth and my chopsticks. Now, this was not the \"melt like butter\" sensation; rather, this was more of a far-from-fresh, mushy shrimp. The breading crumbled off the shrimp and the shrimp could not hold its shape. I called over the waitress/cashier and she brought my dish to the cooks to make sure it wasn't raw or if anything was wrong. She came back and told me that the cooks said it should look like this. I was quite disturbed and told her I probably still wouldn't touch the shrimp anymore. She was nice enough to offer that they make a new dish of my choice for me. I ended up picking chicken, but the wait for the new dish took so long, I asked them to just to-go it. For the rest of the meal, I ended up just picking at my friend's rice.\n\nOnce we got home, though, my stomach began to feel uneasy and nauseous. I proceeded to spend the next 4 hours trying to calm my stomach with pepto bismol and ended up throwing up whatever I had at dinner. I did not eat the chicken curry I had brought home, as I could barely keep down water at all. I had plans to go out that night, but I had to cancel them all just so I could attempt to recover from this episode. The next two days was spent living off of bananas, saltine crackers, and oatmeal.\n\nI was quite shocked to see this place serve food of such low quality, but even more astonished, knowing that the employees told me to my face that it was okay. If one bite of bad shrimp put me out of commission for 2 days, I can't imagine what would have happened if I took their word and ate the rest of their dish.\n\nThis will probably be my first and my last time visiting this establishment, but I do warn all future customers to watch out for what they put on your plate. I would hate to see anyone else go through what I had to go through.", "author": "Alexa W."}

I actually had to ask the cashier what her favorite was out of all the udon choices they had and she recommended me the beef udon. So, I went with her decision and sat myself down afterwards.

When you first get the dish, it doesn't look that appetizing, but the flavors are actually really good. Between the chicken katsu and the hamburger steak, I'd recommend the hamburger steak because with the curry you get a taste of sweet and spicy (there is ketchup on the hamburger steak). You can choose how spicy your curry is. Just a heads up, mild is actually no spice added. Plus you get a ton of food. I do think it is strange though that the cashier will bring you your food, but then you have to get up for your own utensils.. Plus they also bus your table for you, but won't bring you utensils and napkins? Strange. You do also have to get your own water so I guess it's fine, but it was weird since we had to get up again right after she brought us our food. Anyways, not a big deal.

Volcano has a simple easy to follow menu and a small dining area that gives it a more homey feel. There are four different levels of spice you can have in your curry, Mild, Medium, Hot, and Extra Hot. I'm a bit of a wimp with spicy food, so I went with medium. But WOW it was delicious and the spice didn't mask the taste of the food. You can still pick up flavors from the rest of the dishes! \n\nAlso, I'm so glad they have a self serve water bar available to the customers. So for all the wimpy spicy food-ers, you won't feel embarrassed to ask for a barrel of water, it's part of the routine. \n\nBottom line: Little hot spot, very tasty.", "author": "Jaime W."}

If you've ever worked in a restaurant or a similar setting as her, you'll consider her a saint.\n\nThe favorite dish here is the hamburger steak plate whereas my girlfriend likes the tried and true chicken katsu plate. Both are different and charming in their own way, but both are extremely hearty and filling. \n\nThe hamburger is much like a nice thick piece of meatloaf, but not filled to the brim with onions like many diners might have them. The chicken katsu doesn't come with katsu sauce in case you guys were wondering.

I'm been a freaking customer of Muracci's when I worked in the Financial District.  I've been to Tani's Kitchen, one of the Bay Area pioneers of Japanese curry in Daly City, a handful of times.  I've also had the JapaCurry food truck and I also fought off the spice at Kare-Ken in the Tenderloin.  In other words, when in comes to Japanese curry, I can give a provide a good opinion.\n\nI've heard great things about Volcano and it didn't disappoint.  Unlike some of the other restaurants I've named, if you can't take the heat (of Japanese curry), then you should be okay with Volcano because they offer several levels of spiciness to choose from.  Another thing I really liked is that you're not just limited to pork and chicken katsu.  There is a veggie option, non-fried meat options, etc.  In addition to that, you can add sides/toppings, like fried shrimp, a boiled egg, sausages, etc.  The combinations are endless.\n\nAs for the curry itself, it's quite delicious.  I wouldn't say it's the best among the other restaurants I mentioned, but it's good.  Though your order arrives whiff of curry, the curry taste is less strong and a little overpowered by the spice.  But I liked it.\n\nPortion-size, it's huge.  I couldn't finish it and had to bag up the leftovers.  So it's a very good value. \n\nOverall, I think Volcano is good.  I would say Kare-Ken still tops my list.  I would certainly recommend it to other Japanese curry fans.", "author": "Albert L."}

The curry flavor tasted quite average and seemed to be overpowered by the heat, even though hot spiciness wasn't spicy enough for me.

If you like spicy food, I'd recommend starting at hot and then working your way up if you like it.  \n\nWhether I order for pick-up or dine-in, the person taking the order is always very friendly.

Without any hesitation, the person helping me immediately had that resolved and I received the chicken noodle in soup curry. Nice! The chicken was deliciously chargrilled and the noodles were a good consistency for the curry. Everything was drenched in curry and came in an insanely large portion. I probably would have only been able to eat half of what was in front of me so my partner had to finish the rest.\n\nThere were also samples of sugared deep fried bread when we were there.

The friend got the pork katsu curry - pretty standard rice + fillet of pork + couple pieces of carrots. The curry was nice and thin and not too spicy.

Volcano is affordable, delicious fast food. \n\nJapanese curry is not like curries from different cuisines. It doesn't have a very strong curry flavor, but certainly can be spicy if you order it that way. The sauce is not vegetarian, or dairy free, and it's not low in fat. It is a delicious, dark sauce that is the epitome of comfort food. I always order my curry with chicken Katsu, veggies like eggplant and zucchini, sausage, and an onion croquette.

It's a place with a hipster vibe so naturally it attracts many local high school and college students.  \n\nM E N U:\nI love the idea of being able to customize your own CURRY PLATE ($4.95-$6.95).\n\n1) PICK YOUR MEAT: chicken, beef, chicken katsu, pork katsu, fried shrimp, etc.\n\n2) ADD TOPPINGS:\n*Boiled Egg, Cheese, Potato Croquette, Fukujinzuke Pickles, Sausage, etc (+$1 each)\n\n*Zucchini, Eggplant, Calamari, Onion Croquette (+$1.50 each)\n\n3) PICK YOUR LEVEL OF SPICINESS: Mild, Medium, Spicy, Volcano (Very Spicy).\n\nThere's also various Katsu Sandwiches (Mini $1.75 and Regular $5.95-$6.50), Noodle Soups ($4.95-$6.50), Volcano Plates - Same as Curry Don plates minus the Curry ($6.50-$7.95), and Salads ($2.50-$2.95).\n\nF O O D:\nI ordered the PORK KATSU CURRY w/ Cheese and extra Fukujinzuke Pickles which took about 5 minutes to prepare.\n\nThe Pork Katsu was sprinkled with cheese, however, the cheese didn't melt. It should have been placed underneath the broiler for a minute since the pork katsu wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese on its own. It was served with a heaping amount of short grain Japanese rice with the curry sauce in its own separate container.\n\nT A S T E:\nThe PORK KATSU was fried to a deep golden brown and had a nice crispy exterior that wasn't greasy. The pork was tender but lacked moistness. The RICE properly cooked; it had just the right amount of stickiness and a bite to it.\n\nThe CURRY SAUCE was well-seasoned but was lacking a stewed richness and was NOT authentic. Authentic Japanese Curry should be thick and coat the back of a spoon without dripping like a faucet. The curry sauce at Volcano had the consistency of chicken broth; perhaps not enough roux (flour and butter thickening agent)? The potatoes and carrots were soft and tender though.\n\nWARNING: I suspect the Curry Sauce has MSG in it because soon after eating the Katsu Curry, my heart started racing. I only get this side effect when I consume MSG and I don't have high blood pressure. \n\nAs far as the SPICINESS level goes, I only ordered medium because some Yelpers had mentioned that the medium was \"spicy\", but spicy it was not. The medium had some kick to it that would hit your tongue seconds upon tasting it, but the heat quickly dissipated. As a Spicy Foods Lover, if I were to go to Volcano again, I would go with the \"Spicy\" or \"Volcano\".  \n\nI only ordered the CHEESE topping so that the dairy could cool the spiciness from the curry, however, the curry wasn't spicy so the cheese wasn't necessary other than if you wanted to add some creamy richness to the curry. The FUKUJINZUKE PICKLES are a must for me when having Japanese Curry. It adds a crunchy texture contrast while the acidity helps to balance the richness from the curry katsu.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nVolcano is a no frills, casual, and self-service establishment. Order at the counter, get a number, seat yourself and wait for your order. Water and utensils are available at the front. \n\nThe modern wooden furnishings are clean and sticky-free.\n\nBeing located nearby Wash HS, I can imagine Volcano being a local afterschool hangout spot. \n\nP A R K I N G:\nEasy metered parking on weekdays before 6 PM. Difficult parking on the weekends.\n\nOverall, the food at Volcano is 3 Stars; it's filling and satisfies your belly when you're hungry.  Volcano also fulfills 3 of the \"Essential 4 C's\": Cheap, Clean and Comforting (unfortunately not Curry-Fic). If you're looking for quality and authenticity, look elsewhere.\n\nSo why 4 Stars? I remember being a broke college student where all I could afford was burgers, burritos and pho, so kudos to Volcano for providing youths in the area a homestyle comforting alternative to fast food.\n\nP.S. - Each customer is given a Frequent Diner Card: FREE Topping on your 3rd, 6th and 9th paid Curry and FREE Curry and Topping on your 12th Visit!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The food is always hot and ready to eat when served. Unlike some restaurants, you can actually see them meat between the crunchy crusts of the katsu. The rice is always moist and well cooked. I especially like the fact that Volcano cooks the carrots and potatoes the way I like them. The carrots are soft but not over cooked and the potatoes are soft and sometimes even has a mashed potato-like texture once you poke your fork through it. \n \nEvery time I come to Volcano I receive excellent customer service. The cashiers I have encountered have always been friendly energetic. I like the idea of self serve water and utensils as well as busing your own table. It teaches you a bit of responsibility. Although the space is a bit tight inside and between tables, the overall atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. \n\nI recommend this place for someone who is taking a significant other out on their first or second date.

I only eat Thai curry and Filipino chicken curry both of which are light on the palette and doesn't not have that strong aroma that clings on the walls and travels around the entire house....no. it's not the spice that bugs me. it's the smell that overpowers the dish, that makes me nauseous...it's that smell that clings to your clothes, which carries on throughout the day -- which overpowers the cigarette smell in my car interior. that type of smell.\n\nBUT...one fine SF day... my friends wanted some Japanese curry. I honestly have not had Japanese curry before. So i was scared to life. I looked at diners' plates when we came in...and it's very..uhmm..BROWN. and saucy. And a LOT of it was on a plate. \nBut i also saw some empty plates that looked like it was devoured and licked clean...So i took a deep breath and ordered the Chicken with Curry and a Potato Croquette.. everything deserves a try.. including this unattractive plate of curry.\n\nWell Guess What?!?!?!?!\n\nI actually Liked IT!!!!! \n\nHere were my steps:\n\n1.) Forked a piece of chicken (which was so juicy and well battered)....\n\n2.) Dipped a bit in the curry on the side of the plate.. (they place the chicken on top of the rice)\n\n3.) Chew... Chew..\n\n4.) Swallow...\n\n5.) Little Dip again...this time with the rice.\n\nREPEAT until i realized YUM...it's good. BUT sooo filling. Maybe i'm still mentally shy to it... or maybe it was still so powerful on my palette. But at least i tried it!!!\n\nThe portions are huge. The rice scoop most especially. My friends devoured all their plates. But they were proud of me for even eating half of mine.\n\nI'd definitely give it another try. I have a strong feeling I'm on my way to liking it without being hesitant to the \"brown\" sauce.\n\nps: curry mixed with sriracha... actually what i liked better.\n\nOh! the potato croquette was YUM!!!!!", "author": "Monica H."}

Japanese curry is not as strong as an Indian Curry, but here at Volcano the Medium level curry does have some kick to it's curry.\n\nSo I just had to try their dish out.  I've been here twice already and I've tried the Chicken Katsu with Sausage topping with a medium level curry sauce over Noodles.  I've also tried the Pork Katsu  and  Curry sauce over rice.\n\nAfter having tried both dishes, I can say the flavor of the curry was excellent.  I did notice a variance in the thickness level of the curry.  One time the curry was a little thicker than the previous time, but yet packed a favorable curry.   \n\nI've had the Noodle and the Rice, I think it's a safe bet to get the Noodles....for some reason the rice did not meet my expectation and I can't remember why not?\n\nThe Sausage, I was hoping for something along the lines of a Hillshire Farm type sausage, but I'm not sure what type of sausage it was.\n\nTo sum up the two dishes I've tried so far...\n\nNoodles vs. Rice....I'd pick the Noodles....4 Star\n\nChicken and Pork Katsu....I can tell there were two levels of crunchiness to both Katsu's which may be a variance in cooks....so one may like it and another may not....until the consistency of the cooking becomes a standard...it's difficult to rate....but I'll have to say it's between a 3 and a 4 star.\n\nAs for the Sausage topping....I could have or not have again....3 star.\n\nChicken Katsu with Noodle\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WnQoN1uV65vacUj0q1TgoQ?select=lYCKLTp2Hheiz6_yoHlxfA\n\nPork Katsu Over Rice\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WnQoN1uV65vacUj0q1TgoQ?select=Sp___kFvzjlswobzrEf1vA\n\nService was excellent, I like the way they had came by and checked up on me asking if everything was ok or not.\n\nAmbiance....nothing special....just a typical dinning area, tables accommodate 1, 2 and 4 people.

We had no idea this place was popular on yelp until after we ordered our food--we just thought it looked like a decent, quick place to grab some yummy food. And it was yummy! Service was relatively fast and the girl who took our orders was very nice. It was really easy to figure out the menu.\n\nI just had the chicken curry and my boyfriend had the katsu curry. I ordered medium spice and ended up with zero spice but they have sriracha bottles everywhere so I just piled that on. Yum! The servings looked small but of course the rice filled me up. I wish they had put the curry on the rice so that it was easier to mix (they were side-by-side) but that's hardly an issue.\n\nPrices were good and there was plenty of room to grab a seat.

Expect to see a menu w/pictures to help present a visual representation of the food items available.\n\nI judge a curry shop on its ability to serve up a curry that has a good consistency that's not too runny and not too thick. It also has to be able to hold up on the spicy heat spectrum as well. Another good indicator of quality is the color, temperature, and cut of meat used in their Katsu.\n\nI decided to order the Chicken Katsu and chose the hot curry sauce. My gf went with the Pork Katsu and had the medium curry sauce. The food was delivered pretty quickly and we got down to eating right away. I noticed that the curry had the right consistency and spice heat, the Katsu was a light golden brown w/o being over breaded or greasy, and the meat had almost no fat. Our plates also came w/a large side of rice and of course there were carrots and potatoes mixed in w/the curry sauce as is typical w/Japanese style curry plates.\n\nOverall it was a great experience w/portions that were filling but didn't create stretch marks or cause food coma either.

I had noticed it driving by on Geary a couple of times and giving it the \"Hmmm...I should try that sometime\". I have fond memories of my mom's chicken curry on brisk evenings in Dallas, Texas. Well, I convinced Jamie W. to take the stuffed-to-the-gills 38 line all the way to 20th Avenue from the Transbay Terminal. You definitely see clear evidence of the Darwinian theory pass through the bus during rush hour.\n\nWhen we finally arrived, I was a bit disappointed to find that it's really more of a lunch counter in the guise of a restaurant. It has school cafeteria-style chairs and tables that look like the remnants of a spring clearance at IKEA, and even a refrigerated section where you pick up your own Diet Coke ($1.50) and Seaweed Salad ($2.50) which was crunchy fresh. I ordered the $6.50 Chicken Katsu Curry Noodles with Vegetables and asked for the hot and spicy treatment. I even added a split hard-boiled egg for a $1 more because well...I'm special.\n\nThe chicken was plentiful and the panko nice and crunchy. The noodles were OK, maybe a bit slippery, while the fresh vegetables were on the paltry side (just one new potato?). I have to say it was the curry sauce that was the most disappointing aspect. It was spicy enough but kinda watery. The description on the site asserts that it is \"thickened with a roux\" and slow cooked for 8-10 hours. Well, somebody must have been running a faucet into the pot because the sauce really had little texture to it. One thing I have to say is that the service by the young woman at the counter was excellent. She courteously came to check up on us.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...standard curry that's been kinda watered down\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...unmistakable air of a fast food joint...there was a picnic cooler for you to get ice\nSERVICE - 4 stars...she was terrific\nTOTAL - 3 stars...just barely...I need to bring my own cornstarch next time", "author": "Ed U."}

I ordered the Pork Katsu Curry (medium spicy!) and added the Spam Katsu and Potato Croquette. The curry arrived complete with potatoes and carrots, which was great because the carrots made me feel a little better about having a starchy and fried (and ultimately delicious) meal. \n\nThe pork katsu itself was good - not too oily and perfectly crispy. The potatoes were a little bland - look, I get that it's just a potato, but I've had some fantastic potatoes in curry/stew before, and this wasn't it. (I would suggest letting the potatoes soak in the curry, but I understand that with the different spiciness of curries, this would probably be overdoing it for them.) HOWEVER, overall, the meal was great. I hadn't had spam katsu before, and it was really good. The potato croquette was also done nicely; it's just a pity I had over-ordered, as I couldn't finish it. \n\nHalfway through my meal, one of the staff asked me if I needed a box. I appreciate the sentiment and was glad she asked, but I could actually finish the whole thing (except for half of the croquette... I'm sorry, croquette!) - should I not have been able to? Nah, maybe I just had a huge appetite. I did run out of curry towards the end of my meal, which was a bummer as well as a surprise, since I'm notorious for never finishing gravies/sauces.\n\nAll in all, a good place.

She told me she always wanted to try Volcano, and I was all up for trying something new, so we walked in, and ordered. At Volcano, you order at the counter first, and then take a seat. The lady behind the counter was incredibly friendly and kind, willing to help us and let us know what the most popular dishes were. According to her, the most popular dishes are the Chicken Katsu, and Pork Katsu. Now, I've have pork and chicken katsu before, but not curry style. I ordered the Pork Katsu and took a seat.\n\nThe food arrived at a pretty good pace, and I dug in. Now, I was incredibly hungry and could not wait to try it. When I saw the dish, I was disappointed. It just didn't look appetizing. The fried pork with the curry and rice with potatoes looked honestly unappealing. Anyhow, I gave it a shot. I put it in my mouth and was even more disappointed. The pork was chewy and flavorless. The curry was horrible, and the rice was too hearty. I thought it might have been just the first bite, so I took another. Nope. Nothing different. \n\nI was disappointed with Volcano because I paid for this lunch, which wasn't satisfying. I asked for a to-go box, thinking I might like it later, but I was wrong. When I went home, opened up the box, ready to microwave it, I was greeted with the most unpleasant smell of all time... IT SMELT LIKE VOMIT. Yes, vomit. Acidic, and sickening.

This is what it looked like (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WnQoN1uV65vacUj0q1TgoQ?select=u-crixsd7MYpKq4tiQKoyw).  I picked up a piece of potato and bit into it.  The curry was very mild and hardly present, and there was a lot more sauce than there was rice.  Someone must stand in the kitchen and count vegetables because there were exactly two pieces of potatoes, two pieces of carrot and two slices of zucchini.  The chicken was moist and both skinless and boneless.  I agree with other reviewers that the vegetables must be pre-cooked and then reheated.  If you notice in the photo it looks like the sauce was just ladled over the potatoes because not all of the veggies were covered in sauce.  My guess would be the microwave because the vegetable pieces cooled very quickly and were cold to the bite within minutes.\n\nThe potato croquette, while on the small side for a buck, was actually very good.  The pickled vegetables served on top of the rice were crunchy but lacked a good vinegar and pickle flavor.  The paper plate and plastic utensils don't bother me as much as it does other reviewers.

The pork katsu is one of the juiciest I've had. This is down and dirty Japanese curry, so it has less curry flavor than the Indian variety and a sweet finish. As you might imagine, Volcano puts some heat in theirs. I got the hot version and I was sweating for an hour. The Volcano version is probably deadly.\n\nThe woman who works at the register is a force of nature. Not only does she take your order, she cleans the tables and brings your order out with a smile. \n\nI ordered the katsu coupled with the sausage. Which sounds like pork overkill, maybe even weird. But, man, did it hit the spot. And to think I almost missed it on the menu.\n\nMy only complaint would be that the steamed rice made the bottom of the katsu soggy. But that's me being fussy and Volcano is decidedly not.", "author": "William B."}

The curry was ok, I liked that it was spicy (you get to choose the level of spiciness you want), but like I said I don't like most curry. The curry would have been better if it had more than just potato and carrot in it, or at least more pieces of what it did have.

At least this way, we can redeem ourselves. \n\nUpon entering, the restaurant was full of people. There were two lines, one to order and one to wait for a table. Yeah, that busy. \n\nLooking at the menu, the Beef Burger Steak caught my eye. So I ordered a curry plate of the steak, along with toppings (boiled egg, potato croquette). My total came to ~$11.00. Ok, not so bad.\n\nThe wait for our food took around 25-30 minutes. Finally the food arrives. First thing i notice, there is a LOT of food on this plate. Luckily my hunger peaked at this point, so it was time to go apeshit on this food. \n\nCut a piece of my Beef Burger Steak, dipped it in my curry sauce and took a bite outa that sucker. First thoughts? Good. With the hard boiled egg? Even better. Overall the plate was splendid. I didn't really care for the potato corquette, as there were already potatoes that came with the plate (along with carrots, so the potato corquette didn't taste any better at that point). \n\nDo I recommend this place? Sure, the quality of food is good and worth and is set at a decent price. The wait kind of sucked but I'm guessing I came in at a bad time, hence the long wait.

The entry takes just a few minutes to be delivered to the table.

I had dinner here a few hours ago with my mom. Hardly ever do I give 5 star reviews but Japanese curry is just that good. Although Volcano does not top Muracci's in the FiDi, it's quite up there on my list of yummy eats. The price is alright even without 50% off but the toppings will really add to your bill if you want those.\n\nIt's good that the menu is not too extensive as the queue picks up very quickly. There are about 10 tables in the restaurant so it was quite tricky to find a space to sit. Good thing there was an open table and I grabbed it before a line formed behind me.\n\nSince the maximum discount is $10, I tried to reach $20 worth of food to get as much flavor on my dish as possible. I got the staple pork katsu curry with #3 hot sauce ($7.25), tofu nuggets, eggplants, zucchinis, and sausages. My mom didn't know what to order so I just ordered the chicken katsu curry with #2 medium sauce and no toppings ($6.95). The total was $21.37 but the Scoutmob brought it down to $13! Strangely enough, there was a phone-in order and the credit card machine doesn't work when the phone is in use. The line got really long since the order took a while. \n\nAll the utensils, ice, and water are self-serve so get what you need. You also have to bus your own table and when we moved tables to a larger one, the lady before us clearly did not dump her cup. Whore. \n\nThe place was packed and our orders took about 10 minutes to come to the table. It's nice that customers aren't called out to pick up plates. It adds a touch of customer service which is excellent. With so many toppings, my plate was full to the brim with sauce and vegetables. My mom's plate was just the basic serving with carrots, potatoes, and zucchinis. \n\nThe hot curry sauce wasn't really spicy which is alright but I really like to fire up my senses. Next time I will get the #4 volcano curry sauce. My mom's sauce didn't taste spicy at all but she felt it was too spicy for her. Oh well, we all have our own opinions. I'm very satisfied that the amount of curry sauce was enough for all the rice to have flavor. I hate when restaurants hold back on the highlight of their menu. There is a small distinction between chicken and pork katsu but pork is definitely the better. The eggplants (+$1.50) and tofu nuggets (+$1.25) were the best toppings and I highly recommend getting those! \n\nI was full from finishing the whole plate and ate half of my mom's dish too. The cashier checked on the customers when she was making rounds cleaning and such which adds another personal touch in customer service. I didn't know Volcano Curry was such a popular destination for richmond district residents. Around 8pm when we finished, people were waiting for tables, sadly. I can't wait to come back and try the curry noodles to see if it stacks up against Muracci's ramen.", "author": "Dominic T."}

She asks me, a customer, to move because a previous customer of hers LEFT AND DIDNT SAVE THE SEATS.... \nI grabbed my friends stuff and mines, and went to stand with my friends who were RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE CASHIER. Then she asks us... as we're just standing around not knowing what to do... since we just lost the only free table... \"Are you guys going to order?\" We said no because we didn't really have a table and then she suggested to either wait for a table or \"You can get take-out.\" \nWhew... thats only the first of it. We decided to wait for a table and just order a little after she asked us to order. (Cause this place's curry is BOMB) \nWe get our table and our food starts to come... then some alcohol-smelling homeless person stumbles in and starts harassing my friend. For a good 5 minutes, he's chatting up my friends (a girl and a guy) and bugging them and allowing them to eat. I stood up and went to the waitress and asked her, \"Excuse me, theres this hobo harassing my friend over there, can you ask him to leave?\" She stares at him runs to the kitchen to talk to the chef (which I'm guessing is the owner) and comes back. \nI see the owner(?) come out the kitchen for a bit then looks at the homeless man from afar. He then heads back into the kitchen... stares at him from there and continues working. \nI was furious. I asked them politely and I'm pretty sure they know that they had the power to kick someone out of their property. \nFed up with the terrible service I was getting, I stood up, went up to the homeless man, my boyfriend stood up, and we told him to stop harassing my friends.\nHe left after a minute or two and then I proceeded to enjoy my curry. At this point I was cursing pretty loudly... I'm pretty sure everyone in the restaurant saw how I had to handle the situation myself since the waitress nor the chef was going to help me.\nAs I was eating.... my friend told me another TERRIBLE thing this waitress had done. His total was 11.09 and he wanted to pull out a quarter from his pocket since he didn't want  91 cents in change. He asked her \"Hold on, can I get a quarter since I don't want 91 cents in change?\" She then replies, 'Ain't nobody got time for that.\" and proceeds to give him 91 cents in change. RUDE! It takes less time to get 16 cents than 91 cents!\n\nAs we were leaving, the same waitress was cleaning out the dirty dishes bin and she asks us.\"So... did he just end up leaving?\" Pissed off, my boyfriend replied angrily, \"No, we had to bug him to leave.\" She had the NERVE to ask us.\n\nAll in all, the food is really good here... but MAN some of the waitresses here are TERRIBLE TERRIBLE people.", "author": "Carina C."}

Not only is their service great (shout out to Tiffany) but if you came in just to have their food, then that alone deserves the 5 stars. I frequent this place probably once a week because it's that good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-08", "description": "Finally tried this local curry joint.  Right off the bat, I can give it 2 stars as its not very unique in flavor and can pass as a fast food joint.  Katsu and curry just in my mind doesn't have anything special, unless the curry sauce is out of this world and has a variety of spices.  \n\nHowever, for $10 and opening till 9pm on a rainy Tuesday night, I could not care less what the taste was like (..initially).  But now that I'm full and have regained all sense of reality and taste between bitter and sweet, mushy and textured, I can say, it's mediocre.  \n\nI had the Ton Katsu ($7.45) curry with Noodles (+$1.00) and then an extra side of zucchini veggies (+$1.50) all coming out to $10.00.  The noodles as claimed were of the thin udon type.  I'm not too sure of this, but I'll take their word on it since it wasn't mushy like spaghetti and it did have some sort of a bounce to it.  The curry....mild flavored, but has hints of curry taste and spice.  Other than that....it either makes me rethink my definition on curry or it leaves me wanting to call it something else that starts off sounding like \"c-r.....\" (ap)\n\nAnd for $1.50 just to add a side of veggies, mainly 4 pieces of zucchini chunks....that's about $0.32 cents a pop.  Do you know that you can get an entire zucchini for that much too?  \n\nIn any case, I even went home to fry an egg and a sausage to go with my meal since I saw egg on the menu but it was the boiled kind (eh) and the sausage addition for $1.50, though tempting, was not so tempting after someone on this page mentioned it looked like a breakfast sausage.  (no thanks.)\n\nSo was I happy with my meal or what?  Short answer....Yes.  It's a good takeout joint and quick fix to a curry craving.  Did it taste good and did I get everything I expected?  No.  I cried myself to sleep after that. \n\nBut to give some credit, the price point is perhaps on point, and the lady taking my order was pretty nice about it.  \n\nI'm looking at my loyalty card right....(chuckles)", "author": "Vincent K."}

The menu is simple (which I like): sandwiches (Nobu K. recommends the chicken katsu sandwich), rice places (katsu, teriyaki), noodle soup, curry, toppings (e.g., sausage, cheese, boiled egg) and sides.  \n\n* Chicken curry ($5.95).  You can specify hot or regular.  The delicious curry sauce was the highlight but everything else was just average (cheap ingredients).  The curry had a sweet, deep, complex flavor.  It was thin but not watery.  I think chili oil is added to make it spicy.  The curry came with big chunks of boneless chicken (all dark meat I think), huge chunks of carrot, potato and zucchini.  It was definitely homestyle.  They included a good amount of steamed white rice (brown rice is $1 extra).  \n\n* Potato croquette ($1.25).  Crispy panko on the outside, creamy potato filling.  Good but average.  \n\nThey didn't have cake rolls or fro-yo but they did have a refrigerated case with drinks, imported Japanese crepes, Japanese pudding and Ciao Bella gelato.", "author": "Lolia S."}

(I like to think and hope it helps keep maintain their prices) Yes, I still give this place a 5-star even though I have to get and put away my dishes because their curry is delicious! \n\nI typically like to order either their original, which is a vegetarian dish with zucchinis, eggplants, carrots, potato, and of course, rice, or their katsu (chicken or pork) dish, which doesn't have as much veggies in there. They do have four levels of spiciness to choose from (mild, medium, hot, and volcano). For someone who can handle a good amount heat in their food, I would recommend the \"hot\", which is what I normally order. I order \"volcano\" level once in a long while since it does seem to over power their curry a bit. \n\nCompared to Muracci's, another popular Japanese curry place in the city, I think Volcano's curry is on the sweeter side-don't get me wrong, Muracci's is good too, but they only open M-F 11am-5 or 6pm. \n\nBONUS: this place offers their own little reward stamp card which gives a free topping for about every 3 dishes you order and by the 12th dish, you get a free curry AND a free topping!", "author": "Am Y."}

Volcano appeals to a younger audience, but that certainly does not mean everyone else is precluded. They seem to play \"Now This Is What I Call Music\" hits and sometimes Jack Johnson with no shame.

This is probably one of the few remaining places in SF where you can eat comfortably if you decided you didn't want to leave your pajamas that day. Also, their logo can best be described as cool because it isn't reminiscent of anything Japanese that I've ever seen.

The rice is authentic and what you would expect to get with Japanese curry, which is a good thing. It includes the pickled red vegetables, potatoes, and carrots.

Also, make sure to get \"volcano\" if you can handle the highest heat at other restaurants. \n\nThough you pay up front for the food and clear your own plates.

My friend wanted to order the \"volcano\" curry (the spiciest on their spice-o-meter) and the female server (the only one there today) insinuated that he wouldn't be able to handle the degree of spiciness. Then she proceeds to ask him if he was Thai or Vietnamese (he's Chinese) because apparently those are the only people who can handle spicy foods. I could not believe she had the nerve to say that to anyone, let alone customers... \n\n2. We each ordered different levels of spiciness, mild, medium, and volcano, and they all tasted the same. Not spicy at all. wtf?\n\n3. One of my friends ordered 2 boiled egg add-ons ($1 each) for his curry and he received two egg halves. They either forgot to give him the 2nd egg or they're shitting us by charging $1 for half a hard boiled egg...\n\n4. My bf ordered the spam mini sandwich which still had not come halfway through our meal. We reminded the server thinking that maybe they forgot to make it. Finally, after we were already done eating, she comes out of the kitchen with the super dinky sandwich in a small paper bag. Without looking or saying a word, she TOSSES the sandwich onto our table!! It would have rolled off it we didn't stop it. WOWOWOWWW. If we wanted to play catch, we would've gone to the park! This girl seriously needs to check herself. She does not know a thing about customer service or food management. (To add insult to injury, the spam sandwich flat out sucked.)\n\nThe server's attitude was seriously APPALLING.

Getting over a cold?  Nothing a little Japanese curry can't fix.  Just broke up?  Have yourself some Japanese curry.........then drown your sorrows in liquor.\n\nSo...just the mere fact that it specializes in Japanese curry means that Volcano is guaranteed two stars at least.  As far as how its curry compares, it's solid.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it certainly hits the spot when I crave curry (which is ALWAYS).  They also make a mean tonkatsu, so that's a plus.  They're a little skimpy on the vegetables, though, unless you order extra.\n\nNext time I come I will hopefully try the curry soup noodles, because that sounds intriguing.  It's just so hard to NOT order a fried pork steak with curry every time, ya know?", "author": "jon y."}

Their curry is much more flavorful than the ones I've had in the past. \n\nI always get the Chicken Katsu curry. Medium spicy. I love spicy and this is the perfect amount of spice before the food doesn't taste good anymore. The katsu is perfectly crunchy. They put it on top of the curry so the katsu doesn't get all soggy before you start eating. The veggies in the curry are also perfectly cooked so they're nice and soft. Love it. \nThe dishes also come with some pickled diakon (I think) which I really enjoy. Wish they'd give me just a little more though. \n\nService is great and price is decent. \n\n**Side note about the spicy levels**\nThe first time I came here with my husband he decided to get the Volcano level of spiciness. I warned him not to get it since he's never been able to handle his spice. But he insisted that since it's Japanese curry, it wouldn't be that spicy.  And guess who was right?! I think he started to lose all sensation to his tongue around the 4th bite. So if you can't handle your spice, I'd stick to anything below a medium.", "author": "Lang T."}

The Holy Grail, essentially. Finding this place right next to one of the great nerd Meccas in the city, Cards and Comics Central, I figured that a place called \"Volcano\" would have the answer to my lusty craving for the ideal, fiery Ambrosia.\n\nSo I entered this establishment. It seemed pretty clean. Nothing much, except for a few Japanese and Hawaiian artworks.\n\nThey have 4 different levels of curry, the hottest being \"Volcano\". I went for the Pork Katsu curry with this \"Volcano\" level. The person at the cashier put it down immediately. Apparently, she didn't warn me about it being extremely spicy, or give an awkward \"You sure you can handle that, fella?\" warning, like at WingStop when you attempt to order \"Atomic\" or at On the Bridge when you get something at a higher level. It made me expect for it to be not so hot. Yeah, I have weird expectations.\n\nSo the cashier brought me my dish to my table. The first impression I got from it was the slightly strong sweet scent from it. One thing I expect out of Japanese curry is for it to have a certain amount of thickness to it. This was actually pretty runny. The pork katsu on the plate was actually pretty large and plentiful. There was exactly 2 pretty thick pieces of carrot, exactly 2 pretty large chucks of potatoes, and exactly 1 pretty thick piece of zucchini in the brown pool of mystery.  I think I would've preferred a bit more vegetation in my curry but, at minimum, this was adequate.\n\nThe taste was a little sour. There was definitely some nose-clearing heat to it, but nothing to extreme. The protein itself was pretty nice and moist, but I can't say I was the biggest fan of the overall flavor of the curry. It just didn't have that heavily spiced, strong flavor that I expect out of a good curry. Disappointed overall.\n\nI think it is worth a try. Price was okay. But personally, I wouldn't come here again myself, even if I do happen to be in the immediate area, nerding out at C+C Central. My quest continues.", "author": "Kevin W."}

I immediately sat down and noticed we were the only ones in here. Kinda strange. My coworker then reluctantly walks in behind me, sat down, then leans over and whispers to me that usually when he notices a restaurant being this empty, he ends up walking right out. There were some flies hovering in the center of the restaurant which was unappetizing. I figured since we're already seated, let's not be rude, right?\n\nBoy, was he wrong about this place. He ordered the extra spicy chicken katsu curry and I ordered the spice level below that one. Mine was delicious! The chicken was pretty tender and moist and went very well with the sauce and rice. I couldn't stop eating it. Then I tried my coworker's curry and it was BOMB! His extra spicy curry was so much more addicting and tastier than mine. I almost wanted to offer to trade him but knowing how much he loves spicy and flavorful things, he wouldn't want mine. We ended up murdering the entire plate. The portion was very generous too, like food coma portions. Oh yes, they do take credit cards.\n\nNever tried anything else on the menu but if I do come back I might try their sandwiches.

They have other things on the menu, but not really, if that makes sense.  It's definitely not a Japanese restaurant.\n\nVolcano has really good curry.  I generally don't like to eat curry, unless it's at Iroha Restaurant in Japantown.  Iroha has the best Japanese curry in my opinion.  My friend wanted to try this place, so I came here reluctantly, but this place actually has really good curry.  The texture is just right, not too thick, not too thin.  Color is a nice dark brown, just like it should be.  Taste is on point.  There are 4 different levels of spicy you can choose from (mild, medium, spicy, & volcano).  I chose medium, which was perfect for me.  It had a nice kick without overpowering the flavor of the curry.  Another plus are the vegetables in the curry.  Usually when I have Japanese curry it only has carrots and potatoes.  Volcano puts zucchini, eggplant, potatoes, and carrots, which is a nice touch.  The tonkatsu(fried pork cutlet) is amazing too; it's almost as good as my mom makes it. \n\nRecommendation:  order the Fukujinzuke as a topping. it comes with all of the curry orders, but if you order as a topping you get a lot more.  It adds a nice crunch and it's refreshing to the spice of the curry.\n\nMinus 1 star because I thought this was more of a sit down restaurant, but really it's more like a cafe, where you order first and pick a seat.

So when I got to curry restaurants they generally have to offer something truly different from what I do at home to really catch my attention.\n\nThis place is pretty darn good. I like that their curry is a bit thinner but still very flavorful. Their tonkatsu is well made and there are no gaps of air in the breading that you find at a lot of places that make their katsu poorly. They add zucchini to the curry and that was a nice twist.\n\nStill, I wasn't blown away by the quality compared to stuff I've eaten at home or friends' places. I ordered a fried boiled egg to top it off and the breading on that was very tough and chewy. Also, it would be nice to see them do some creative stuff with their rice (pilaf, garlic, etc).\n\nBut the curry is authentic, has a kick (if you order volcano) and the tonkatsu is good.

Having lived in Hawaii where Japanese curry is a staple and is offered at almost every plate lunch place, I was a bit wary of trying a Japanese curry restaurant in San Francisco. But I did. And it was tasty, filling, and a great value. \n\nI ordered the chicken katsu curry with two toppings: fried tofu and eggplant. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised that the although deep fried, the katsu wasn't greasy, and the chicken was of good quality. I think I can safely venture to say that it appears that Volcano changes the frying oil regularly, unlike say, Coco Ichiban. The curry was a bit thinner than I am used to ... not sure if it is the style or because it is simply watered down. The flavor was ok ... I was hoping that it'd be savory and a tad bit more sweet. When preparing curry, many Japanese people add chocolate bar pieces (I'm not kidding) to the sauce to make it slightly sweet and to add a slightly more complex and richer flavor. I was tempted to ask for some chocolate to add to the sauce. \n\nI ordered hot but requested a side of the Volcano sauce, which is added into the base curry if ordered. The hot wasn't spicy to me, so I poured in the side of Volcano sauce. Wow! The heat takes a few moments to settle in then it's like mad fire. \n\nI also ordered a regular chicken katsu plate (no curry) that came with salad, rice, and miso soup. I really enjoyed the salad because it was refreshing and wasn't comprised of iceberg lettuce like most Japanese restaurants tend to serve. The miso soup was good and had wakame (seaweed) and green onions. It was good but lacked some of the complex flavors that miso soup can offer. I appreciated that the chicken katsu had only a slight drizzle of katsu sauce. I grabbed a bottle of the katsu sauce ... Volcano's version seems watered down and lacked the zing that most katsu sauces have.\n\nThe portion sizes are large and the food is hearty and good, especially for the price.", "author": "Melissa K."}

Fragrant curry. Japanese curry.\n\nI followed my nose to Volcano, a small-ish place with some chairs and tables and an ordering counter. The menu is as simple as can be. If you can't order from their menu, then you should be shot in the head for your stupidity. I ordered the shrimp curry with a couple of croquettes. She asked me what level did I want. I asked how hot the Volcano was and she said very hot. So me being a smart one ordered the hot level. Waiting...Waiting...Waiting...Your food is ready! Sweet! Take the bag and I walk out.\n\n\nGet home and start to look in the bag. The curry is in a separate container. Awesomeness! A lot of place don't do that. I smelled the curry. Nice and fragrant like more Japanese curries. The taste? Meh...Like there should have been a waa waa trumpet sound bite for the disappointment I felt when I tasted the curry. Hot? Maybe in temperature! Really? This is not enough to burn anyone's tongue off! Thus is the case with most spicy foods. They say it's hot or really hot and it turns out to be a limp dick that can't perform. And next time, I am not ordering the shrimp again. I got 2, count em, 2 whole shrimp!

It was soggy and bland. A little focus on mimicking the result that you get at a good Thai food place would go a long way to bringing in more vegetarians.\n\n2) Tofu selection was weak. Vegetarian style should be an option and come with a large amount of tofu included, which is an extremely cheap protein to cook and is again something that vegetarians like. My pork katsu was enormous but my date's tofu addition was only two measly pucks. \n\n3) Seaweed salad just wasn't very good in my opinion and could probably be easily improved.\n\nIn closing, this place is delicious with giant portions at prices that you won't ever feel bad paying. Vegetarians should be vocal about getting better options, since the curry sauce makes a satisfying, spicy gravy that goes well with any fried food and that you won't stop eating until it's gone. Go eat here soon and make it a fun way to treat yourself to a trip out to the Richmond, you will never regret it.", "author": "Aaron G."}

It is self serve but they will bring out the food for you and clean it up for you if you are done. I'd say its somewhere inbetween a cafe and a regular restaurant - you pay and order before you sit. The curry is very enjoyable, but please note I am half Japanese and grew up on Japanese food, so what might be 'great' to me may simply be 'good' to most people. I have come with at least 6 or 7 unique people here in my many visits though and everyone seems to think it is pretty good here.\n\nSomeone wanting a sit in decent sized meal of good japanese style curry on the cheap you can get by on under $7 a meal here if you go basic, and they have a point card system so if you make this place a habit, you can get free toppings every 4 purchases and a free meal every 12 purchases. 4 Spicyness levels - Mild, Medium, Hot, and their trademark Volcano. I always get Medium and it is a decent spicyness. I've heard the Volcano is pretty high on the spiciness scales, so even if you love spicy I'd start with a \"hot\" just to be safe. But hey, if you think you can take it, don't let me stop you. Just remember, water is self serve.\n\nI know I sound cheap but I'm always on the lookout for affordable meals that are healthy, good, and that I don't have to prepare myself.

They give you a picture of the person and you are like, \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" Then for some reason, you are kicking it with your friends and you meet the person they are trying to set you up with face to face with. You get to know them and you are likee, \"wow, this isn't so bad.\" And by the end of the end of the night, you have fallen deeply in love. \n\nI live right by Volcano curry. When they first opened up, they took pictures of their curry and stuck it on the front window. Maybe I am photosnob, but one look and I was in in full \"do not want\" mode. So a few months slip by, I walk by the front each time vomiting in my mouth a little at the thought of actually eating here one day. \n\nBut fate loves to play these cruel tricks. One day, my friend randomly calls me up to go hit this place up. In my mind, I was already thinking about having a burrito at Gordo's next door. Maybe I was lonely, maybe I was temporarily blinded and I agreed. Between the hours of 2 pm and 5 pm, I braced myself for what was to come. \n\nI got the chicken curry with a side potato croquette. It was fantastic. This was legit curry. No joke. I was blown away. I was humbled as this \"ugly chick\" of a restaurant actually moved me. \n\nThe only thing is their curry comes in not hot and really hot\n\nThen they started serving sandwiches. It brought back old high school memories when the same spot was a quick Korean BBQ take out place with the best sandwiches I ever had. Now they have katsu sandwiches.

Of course, that being said, take my review of Volcano with a grain of salt, since I'm not judging it based on any pre-existing notions of what Japanese curry should be like.\n\nVolcano is a nice little place along Geary, a street with many, many other decent-to-good places to eat. I never noticed it before, so I'm assuming it must be somewhat new, like it was built in the last two or three years or something. Either that or they like to keep the place clean; the decor is classy looking and everything inside looks neat and shiny.\n\nIn terms of the menu there's a choice between the curry plates (rice, curry, choice of meat), the \"volcano\" plates (rice, choice of meat, soup, salad ... I think), sandwiches, and toppings. Personally I've only ever had the curry plates with a few of the toppings, all of which have been rather tasty. Nothing is terribly expensive here (no more than $8 a plate), and the portions are more than enough to fill you up. And they sell some Japanese drinks like canned Pokka/UCC coffee and Calpico if you're looking for a bit of added \"authenticity\" (note the quotation marks).\n\nThe staff is always nice and friendly, and considering the girl at the counter both takes your order and brings it out to you, I'd have to say they do a pretty excellent job of things. Food might take awhile to come out if you have a larger group though, so if you're like my friends and I who wait until everyone has their food before starting, you'll probably want to order last.\n\nVolcano isn't the best or most authentic place I've been to, but for some good curry it's definitely the most comfortable place to go on a weekly basis. Oh, and if you're here often, be sure to grab a stamp card. Every few trips you'll get a free topping, with a free curry for every 12 (I think). Not a bad deal.", "author": "Will C."}

Also, the amount of options for a vegetarian, another plus!\n\nI ordered the Original Curry with the tofu nuggets, pickles, and potato croquette.  I was not sure about the pickle, but they are THE PICKLES to have with the curry.  It made it taste even better and calmed the spiciness a bit as I got Volcano spiciness and a half... I almost went with two Volcano heat, but the waitress suggested I try either Volcano first just in case.  My friend suggested getting another half, so I went with that.  It was perfect!  I could go double, but I like it with 1 and half Volcano.  For those whom do not like habanero peppers, I don't suggest going with Volcano cause that has enough heat of one habanero or more.  Anyway, the tofu nuggets are also bomb!  I actually went online to search for where I could purchase it, but I think they actually make it in house.  It's amazing and will be what I get again along with the pickles.  The potato croquette is good too, but I could do with more tofu nuggets instead.  I will try the onion one next time.\n\nOver all, I'm completely satisfied with this find.  The employee there is nice.

Oh wait, I forgot, this is Yelp. . . .\n\nThe good news - Volcano is a tasty, casual, inexpensive curry house in the Japanese style, with fried pork or chicken cutlet topping a mildly spicy curry with grilled veggies.  You can order regular, hot, or Volcano hot, with a couple toppings and it'll cost under $12.  I recommend the Japanese pickled radish, fukujinzuke, definitely a must-have with curry.  Right now they don't have a vegetarian curry option, but hopefully down the road this will happen.  Fried items are fresh and tasty.\n\nThe space is very casual, almost fast food style.  It's not going to want you to stay and linger, but if you are in the mood for some tasty curry in the Richmond, you should definitely try out this newcomer.  \n\nI will visit Volcano again soon, and update this review.", "author": "Todd E."}

The Katsu is crispy and fresh - I really like the batter, and it comes with a bed of grilled veggies to keep the Katsu raised up so it doesn't get soggy.  I usually get the curry with extra red pickle, which gives the dish a little more crunchy texture and cuts the heaviness of the curry.\n\nThe 4-stars is for the Katsu curry, but I'm not as much of a fan of the plain chicken curry (3-stars).  The chicken appears to be pre-cooked and then added to the curry for reheating...would prefer the chicken to be fresher/juicier.\n\nSomeone has mentioned that the curry wasn't thick enough for them...I can see that.  The curry is just thick enough in my opinion.  Any thicker, and I feel like it would be too heavy for me (as some curries seem to congeal a little as they cool).", "author": "Fontane L."}

Amiable.\n\nRight, so it's not the best Asian curry you'll ever have, but it's definitely not terrible, especially if you're a meat and potatoes (not curry connoisseur) kind of guy.\n\nFor FIVE bucks, you get a paper plate full of curry and delicious veggies and two heaping scoops of rice!  My veggies were the highlight of the dish - carrots were exceptionally sweet, savory, and tender and the eggplant was hearty and flavorful and certainly not mushy.  The curry was a bit watery and had a misplaced hint of BBQ sauce flavor (?) but it was forgivable.\n\nThe service is extremely friendly.  Keeping in mind that this is more reminiscent of a clean, hip fast food-joint than a full service restaurant, the kind girl behind the counter was ever diligent in making sure that we were enjoying our experience and un-necessarily cleared our table for us.\n\nWalls are adorned with art-deco 'Frisco landmarks and institutions  - very cool.  \n\n$So cheap!  $5 for a filling plate of veggies, rice, curry, and pickled cucumbers.", "author": "Jane L."}

We aren't curry connoisseurs in the least, but we've had a decent amount of curry in our lives together (particularly the Japanese style).  \n\nThe restaurant itself is a bit simple.  Simple in the sense that it could be greater.  It could be more of a \"sit down\" lunch & dinner spot, rather than a mediocre sell as a diner-esqe establishment.  This place, if they wanted to, could be a legit restaurant filled with the murmur of the Neo Asian hipster youth culture, but alas, it maintains it's diner-esque environment.  Single star for the ambiance.\n\n'Yeah, but what about the food', you ask?  Well, the flavors are good.  Great? Not quite, but well meaning.  I appreciate the availability of choice when it comes to the levels of spicy heat, but what I really needed was a choice of curry thickness, as the curry came out as a soupy sauce.  Everything was separated from the other.  The rice and vegetables sat on the sauce, as did the tonkatsu (deep fried pork cutlet).  I believe that the sauce was cooked independent of the vegetables and meat - a strange notion, when considering my own experiential view of curry.  All in all, the curry (and tonkatsu) get a solid three stars.  Unfortunately, no more, but fortunately, no less.", "author": "Darkie L."}

We decided to try this place out when we overheard a conversation at another curry place about how much better this place was. The drive there sucked because the traffic was horrible, but I'm guessing that that's just because we went during Fleet Week. We were able to find smoe parking right across the street. There wasn't a line or anything when we went in the late afternoon, but the cashier told us there is usually a 15-20 minute wait during dinner time. I got the Pork Katsu Curry (medium-spicy) and my boyfriend got the beef curry (hot-spicy). It was good! I wouldn't say it was the best Japanese curry we've tried, but it was still yum and filling.

I heard an eclectic mix of 80s and country and heaven knows what else.  I wouldn't mind so much except they were so slow and I didn't have any earphones for the mp3 player (I had brought it to read -- ***** re: Stanza, by the way.)  Anyhow it was well worth the wait.  My spicy curry with fried shrimp, egg, and croquette was great.  The egg was perfect; creamy and delicious.  The spicy curry was very, very flavorful with almost an undercurrent of black-pepper-hot (vs. say, chili-hot), but no, it doesn't blow you away with the heat.  I guess I'm getting old, because that's exactly how I like it.\n\nAside from the music, my other complaint is with the lack of a curry ramen or curry udon on the menu.

I've had plenty of curry in my life that was just sauce and rice - at Volcano there are nice, actual big chunks of vegetables in the sauce. It's comforting (especially if you're Japanese American), spicy (you have to get the \"hot\", not the \"regular\" - the regular version is too mild and kind of blah. If you're a real wimp about spicy food, have your friend get the \"hot\" while you get the \"regular\", and  put a few spoonfuls of their sauce into your sauce.)  It's nice that you can get white rice or brown rice, and that you can do this sort of build-your-own thing by adding extra zucchini, eggplant, pickles, potato croquette, etc. \n\nIt's a small, clean, not-highly-decorated storefront - no, it's not the lobby of the Fairmont Hotel, but it's pleasant enough, and I find the cleanliness very nice. Actually, the cleanliness is kind of a miracle, considering the moldy, damp, pigeon hangout of Geary Blvd. in general! It is totally worth a try. And yes, they do serve on paper plates, but they have real cups, drinking water and a cute little Igloo filled with ice, with an ice scooper, so at least you're not using yet another paper cup, like everyone who gets a daily Starbucks drink.", "author": "Dani Y."}

I could be wrong but I think the place is run by Korean people, not Japanese people, if you are looking for pure authenticity.\n\nGOOD:\n- Plenty of metered parking along Geary before 6:00PM.\n- Service is pretty fast and the food comes out in a few minutes.  \n- Plenty of clean tables and seats and not cramped like many other places that specialize in Japanese curry that I have been to.\n\nJUST OKAY:\n- The pork katsu curry was okay (about $7). The katsu was good but the curry could have been better. It was decently thick but a little on the bland size. I got the medium level spiciness and it was not spicy at all. Portion size is good but not overwhelming and it comes with some slices of carrots, zucchini and potato.\n- I added a \"Japanese\" sausage to my order. I was expecting kurobuta sausage but what I got resembled a hot dog link (the skinny Oscar Meyer kind). I was disappointed but the sausage/hot dog tasted much better than how it looked. That being said, I wouldn't order it again because I want kurobuta sausage, not an Oscar Meyer hot dog looking sausage.\n- The potato croquette wasn't very good in my opinion. It was mushy and not a very good Japanese croquette. I would not get it again.   \n\nBAD:\n- Nothing really bad here. Maybe the only real complaint is that they give super stingy portions of their Japanese pickles with their curry. They really force you to pay $1 more for extra pickles if you like them even just a little bit. \n\nCONCLUSION: Volcano Curry serves some average-quality Japanese curry and it will only cost you about $7-8.

I've had the beef, the chicken, and the pork cutlet. The menu is super-simple, and I think it's a pleasure to have a place that specializes in something, and does just that, unlike, say, all the Japanese restaurants that add ramen just to have it on the menu, but that don't do that dish service. \n\nThe complaints about decor and paper plates -- well, I'm not sure what to say about those. It's a simple place, with simple service. That appeals to me. It's a little pricey for lunch, but for 6.95 (the most expensive dish in the curry menu), you're sure to be full for dinner.", "author": "OuterLands X."}

The name Volcano suggested incredible spicy heat. Well... let's get to the exposure.\n\nThe fill in the blank Katsu pics looked pretty good on the wall menus. We noticed because you have to order from the counter. Cool... reduces the tip a few notches. So what's the scoop on this curry? They pour it over the ______ (pork, chicken) Katsu. I chose pork, with calamari rings (extra 1.50) with level 3 of 4 levels of heat. Served with rice and Miso Soup if you want to pay for it as a side. The flavor was only adequate, while the heat was weak. Level 4 would probably be a joke too. There is no extra charge for the Volcano Heat options, so the menu promos are pretty much a waste of ink. Oh yeah, they also have Teriyaki Chicken and Tempura on the menu. The Teriyaki was OK, served with rice... and the Tempura (shrimp) is offered as add on sides to the Katsu or Teriyaki... at a buck or more a piece. Don't get excited... the shrimp seems pre breaded or battered most likely frozen. Beverages include tea bags with hot water and cans of drinks all available for you to pick out from a display.\n\nAll the food tastes just like you'd imagine would fit my description. Not bad, but less than good restaurant quality. Kind of like Jollibee. Want another hint? They offer frequent dining coupons... I dunno 10 visits and you get a free curry dish or something. Oh, you've got another option. Leave your dirty dishes on your table... or sort out your trash, recycling, utensils at their recepticles. Just follow the directions on the wall. Uh... we chose the former, wanting to leave a tip. Service was OK, by the way.\n\nYou want decent Curry...? Go with Indian, Pakistani, Thai or even Chinese.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-20", "description": "Why are people giving this restaurant such low ratings?  People (vegans) are so stupid sometimes.  I give this 5 stars for several reasons:\n\n1) FOOD - The curry is outstanding. I don't understand why people are complaining about the amount of food.  My chicken curry had plenty of vegetables, a good amount of chicken, and the perfect blend of rice and curry.  Obviously, you want to hear about the curry.  What can I say?  It's hot, flavorful, and spicy.  I like Tani's, but this is much better than Tani's.  I was also impressed by the chunks of vegetables.  Usually you'll get these small, freeze dried vegetables, but here they give you big chunks of vegetables.  I would also like to add that the potato croquette adds a lot to the meal, so I would go get that if you don't mind spending another $1.25.  In all, the food here is great.\n\n2) MENU - All it is is curry.  I love it when menus are small and focus only on one thing.  You don't have to think.  It also means that they specialize on only dish.  Perfect.  No sushi, no ramen, just curry.  \n\n3) PRICE - You won't find a cheaper restaurant for curry.  You also don't have to tip because they take your order at a counter (like a McDonalds) and you just wait and then take a seat.  So not only is it cheap, there's no additional cost.  They did raise their price on some of the sides, but only by a few cents.  \n\nIn all, this place is great if you want straight up japanese curry and nothing else.  If you're a vegan, stop complaining.  I'm sick and tired of people wanting vegan options and therefore giving this place low ratings.  Japanese curry was never meant to be vegetarian.  Stop trying to enforce your views on ethnic dishes that were never meant to be vegetarian in the first place.  Don't say, \"This is San Francisco, you should have vegetarian options.\"  In the words of Biff, \"Make like a tree, and get outta here.\"\n\nSo if you're not an elitist vegan who originally grew up in Oregon, yet calls themselves a San Franciscan just because they're attending some art school here and you'd like some curry on a cold day, come to Volcano.", "author": "SAS Z."}

They provide more than enough curry for the meal, with some veggies included.  Each plate is a generous serving, and I usually eat until I can no longer eat anymore, which means I lick the plate clean and am beyond stuffed!

To me, what's the most important criteria for deciding a restaurant's quality?  The food.  Duh.  The curry is very smooth and quite flavorful and every other ingredient in my Chicken Katsu curry was cooked perfectly, from the katsu itself and the potatoes and such.  \n\nI'm a big fan of curries, especially Japanese and Indonesian ones, and this place ranks pretty highly among the many places I've eaten excellent curries.  And when you figure that two full dinners (and big portions) came out to a grand total of $16.32 who's going to complain?\n\nI guess if you really, really care about the provenance of a restaurant's chairs, the wattage of its lights and insist that your beverage comes in an ice-cooled silver bucket than you should probably be prepared to spend many more dollars on inferior curries and put up with dismissive service as the logical price for being fashionable.", "author": "Chris K."}

However, a few of my coworkers have been here and raved about this place so I decided to give it a try.  Mind you, I've never had Japanese curry before so I had no idea what to expect.  I ended up ordering the Chicken Katsu Curry ($6.50) with a Croquette for an extra $1.  The waitress told me that I could choose from Mild, Spicy or Volcano Spicy (not on their menu), so of course I had to give the latter a try.  The curry was pretty spicy but still palatable.  I actually tried a little of my coworker's regular spicy one and I thought that one was a little sweeter, which I liked better (the Volcano spicy was a little tangier from the chili sauce).  Overall, I thought their curry was actually quite tasty.  Everything came out piping hot and fresh and the portions are HUGE!\n\nI do hope that they will switch to regular plates and utensils because paper plates and plastic utensils are not very eco-friendly (and quite expensive in the long run).\n\nIf I ever get a craving for curry, I know where to go now ;)", "author": "Katelynn L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-03-15", "description": "Updated review\n\ngiving them a slight upgrade/bump.  Not that it really makes a difference (other than to the environment) but they have normal plates now.  Curry is runny.  Not a whole lot of substance (i.e. meat, veggies, etc) in the curry itself.  It's an ok meal for the price.  The chicken katsu sandwich is pretty good though.  Volcano level spicy is pretty spicy indeed.  It's probably equivalent to on the bridge's XX spicy.  I've gone from almost never going there to sometimes going there.  The sandwiches are convenient.\n\nOld review - \n\nI was a bit concerned coming here based on the previous yelp reviews.\n\nPaper plates?  Plastic Utensils?  If these things really bother you that much, you are a stuck up food snob.  I eat plenty of fair and festival food on paper plates and with plastic utensils.  Does it affect the eating experience?  In an institution defined as \"fine dining\" Yes.  Is Volcano Curry or should you consider it such an institution?  No.  The only thing I can say about it is it isn't a very green practice.  It would be nice to see plates and silverware eventually but I won't grade them down for not having them.\n\nSauce - yes, the sauce could be better.  It wasn't very smooth.  It was kind of starchy kind of like when you use potatoes in the sauce creation or as a thickener rather than the roux they claim to use.  Taste was ok.  I can make better curry but since I'm not planning on opening a restaurant anytime soon, who am I?  I got the spicy and it was a nice level.  If you are a serious spice head, I would probably try to order it extra, extra-extra, or extra-extra-extra spicy.  Don't know if they will oblige.\n\nFillings - I got the chicken curry.  The chicken was cooked inconsistently.  There were some overcooked pieces.  A few nicely cooked pieces.  Nothing offensive.  Nothing awesome.\n\nAccoutrements - served with three types of pickles.  The red ones really match well with the curry.  The green pickles and the pickled onions really seemed out of place.  The croquette was pretty standard.  I haven't been to a place that actually makes their own croquettes.  Or tasted like it was homemade.\n\nService - you order at the counter.\n\nPrice - this is the biggest thing you have to factor into the equation.  The prices are really cheap.  You buy at the counter.  You don't have to tip.  You get a plastic number for your order.  It's almost like this place is... fast food!  I think people really expected too much out of this place hoping for a Richmond Curry Heaven.  I know I was but when you step back, it's really just the Curry version of Gordo's (which I can't say I find to be very good when you compare it to somewhere like Cancun or El Farolito's).  Cheap, quick, serviceable.  Good for when you are lazy or in a dinner pinch.  My two friends were actually very satisfied with their meal.  I had previous had this place at 3 stars because of their reaction but I guess in the end I have to grade it on my experience.  I went back a second time and got the curry with shrimp tempura (?).  It was too doughy, totally lost the shrimp.  The eggplant skin was inedible and the vegetables were overcooked.  I get the feeling they used vegetables from the stock instead of using fresh ones for the serving dish.  In the end, I have to hold up a certain standard and I can't tell people I think Volcano is on par with other 3 star rated institutions.  Cheap curry eats.  Good if you are easily pleased.  If you are a fine diner, avoid.  I might go back from time to time but I doubt very often.\n\n2 stars for food.  0.5 star for price/value.\n2.5 STARS", "author": "Nat L."}

I came here after being lured in by a Scoutmob deal, since I couldn't resist everything being 50% off.  Actually, even without the discount, the prices were already very reasonable as most dishes were around $7.  We got the chicken katsu and the pork katsu.  I will say that the portions were very big and that I liked the chicken more than the pork.  It was moister and more flavorful, whereas the pork seemed bland.  These curry dishes come with 2 pieces of potatoes, carrots, and zucchini.  In addition, you get a heaping portion of rice topped with some pickled daikons.  I got the medium spicy curry, which packs a little heat, and it goes well with the rice.  If you add toppings, I recommend the pork croquette, as that was very good. The other toppings that I tried weren't remarkable - calamari, sausage, and boiled egg.", "author": "Tyler C."}

More veggies would have been nice but overall this is satisfying, cheap food.", "author": "Sheryl L."}

True, the price is  a little more than a 4.50 rice plate on Clement and the meal won't leave you as full as a super burrito. But this place finds a happy medium between, price, quality and portion size. \n\nI had the spicy chicken curry which was quite good. It was indeed very spicy but not so spicy that it was hard to eat. I tried a bite of my friend's beef curry which was even better. It's served in a rich brown gravy with a hint of sweetness to balance the spice. \n\nI'll be back again, (and next time I'll be getting the beef curry!)", "author": "Joe S."}

There are tables available and someone will bring your food over but you have to fill up your own water and grab your own utensils. I saw the tomato curry and was intrigued so I ordered a tomato pork curry medium spicy. I was told it would be on the sweeter side. My friend order the chicken curry. I was kind of disappointed in my curry. It no longer tasted like a japanese curry dish. It reminded me of a non-japanese ethnic dish. I guess I should have known better. Oh well. It did start to taste better to me as I kept eating though. I tried my friend's chicken curry and really liked it. I also preferred her chicken to my pork. I would like to come back and when I do I would order what she had. It definitely tastes way better than the Golden Curry packets I use back home. I wanted to try something new but was disappointed.

There aren't too many curry places in SF, and my husband and I are return customers to this one.  Usually, we like the curry a little thicker, but here, it's runny.  Still, the taste is really good.  I pretty much stick to the pork katsu curry.  The pork katsu is fried crunchy, and the curry is flavorful.  The serving is large and fulfilling.  I've tried spice level volcano before, and it's a little too much.  It's numbing hot, and not too enjoyable.  I like the level just below that (hot, I think).  We always get a side of the potato croquet too.  Prices are reasonable.  There's nothing else to ask for on cold nights when you don't feel like cooking!", "author": "Allison M."}

The base curry comes with meat and a few stewed vegetables, but you can add additional ones as toppings, which is nice. The curry flavor is very good and the chicken katsu plate is my favorite. I've also had the chicken curry and chicken curry soup noodle dish. The chicken curry rice plate is good, but the soup is a bit too rich. There is definitely a lot of curry flavor, but the soup is just too heavy for my taste, although I can't say it is heavier than the curry soup I've had anywhere else. The portion sizes are good- I generally eat more than the average person and while I'm not stuffed after leaving this place, I'm content. The Prices are very reasonable and I would probably go to this place 2 or 3 times a week if I could get myself to drive all the way out to the richmond that many times a week", "author": "Tyler C."}

Like a few other Yelpers, I was driving around and found this restaurant by accident. I've been engaged in the pursuit of the ultimate bowl of chicken katsu curry for several months and was happy to add another contender to the list. The menu is simple, as has been previously noted, but there are a few things that stand out for me. \n1.) Prices here are very reasonable. You can order a bowl of tasty, meaty, satisfying curry for several dollars depending on your toppings. I like the option of adding eggplant- that's something I haven't seen before.\n2.) Salads. I know this is a somewhat American preference and I ordered the green salad which was way more than just iceberg lettuce and a slice of tomato. My salad had crisp mixed greens, including frisee (which isn't authentically Japanese, but I loved it) and a tasty dressing.\n3.) Cleanliness. The restaurant is very, very, very clean. Bathroom is also very clean, which tells me that the owner and staff pay attention to all the details.\n4.) Last but certainly not least, the curry. It's the star of the menu and it's the perfect consistency. Not runny or clumpy, it's velvety smooth, hearty, slightly spicy.\n\nI have to try the potato croquette next time- how did I miss that option?", "author": "Modestly I."}

There are so many restaurants around this area with the same kind of food, I was excited to have something different.  I love japanese curry.\n\nWe went on opening day.  The owner was there.  The service was good, although it did take a long time for the food, but hey, I'll wait for freshly cooked food.  Price is decent, although you only get two tiny small shrimp.  I recommend that they serve 4 shrimp but up the price by $2.\nThe curry was so-so, pretty bland, but not bad.  We would have recommended this place, for a cheap, mediocre informal meal.  \n\nYes, \"would have\".\n\nNow, we would never recommend this place, purely for the horrible service.  Without the manager there, the service was night and day.   On Saturday, the place was empty when we first walked in.  No one was there.  We placed our order.  First, the order took 30 minutes.  When we got them, 2 of the 3 were wrong.  I should have known, because there was a lot of confusion with the order takers (2 of them) arguing with each other.  By the time, I received my wrong order, there were about 20 people in the restaurant.  They told me that even though they screwed up my order, the new corrected order would be cooked AFTER the 20 that came in after me.  We were pissed.  We argued and reminded them that NO ONE was in the restaurant when we walked in, and that we should be ahead of all of them, and they were the ones that screwed up the order.  They assured me we would be next.  20 minutes later, and 8 plates passing by us, we still didn't receive our corrected order.  They forgot to give it to the cook.   They never apologized, as a matter of fact, they made me feel like I was being completely irrational and impatient.\n\nWe will never recommend this place again.  While we understand that new places take time to get things together.  There is no way they are going to work out with the staff that was there Saturday (Feb 27) evening.  Their lack of common sense, rudeness and condescending manner was inexcusable.  I hope the owner of this restaurant reads this and considers restaffing if he wants to keep this place open.", "author": "Stacey F."}
