This place is amazing from top to bottom.\n\nWe made a last minute reservation for my birthday on a Monday evening. Coming back from a day in Point Reyes, I had oysters on my mind and we were running late. A quick call to the restaurant regarding our delay and it was not a problem that we were running 10 minutes behind schedule.\n\nLocation: Located in FiDi, I can see this place having a pretty happening happy hour. I kind of wished we were back in the city early enough for it, but oh well. \n\nAmbiance: Walking in, it's dimly lit, but the tropical wallpaper keeps the place looking modern and fresh. The seating is limited and it as pretty packed when we walked in - glad we made that reservation! I can see why this place won Best Designed New Restaurant by Bon Appetit (as well as being a James Beard nominee)! Both great for a classy happy hour or a romantic date night.\n\nService: Excellent service! Very friendly and attentive.\n\nDrinks: I didn't have any expectations regarding the cocktails, but after reading captions for pictures of the Garden Party and being a gin lover, I had to order it. Probably one of top three favorite cocktails ever. Delicious. You could taste the gin, but the herbs, jardesca, and egg whites just complemented each other really well and it went down smoothly. There are few cocktails I ever crave, but I can see this being one of them. The second cocktail I had was the Barbarita which was also nice and refreshing, but the Garden Party was hands down my favorite.\n\nFood: We came mainly for the oysters so we basically just went down the list and tried at least one of everything for the plain raw oysters. There were a couple that we ordered doubles. We also tried the uni topped oysters which were divine. They were served with a couple sauces, but honestly, they all tasted better plain. There was one type that was rather salty and the sauce helped cut the salt. In terms of hot food, we ordered the crab and artichoke dip served with potato chips and the octopus. Both were delicious. The dip had nice chunks of crab and wasn't overly creamy. The octopus was perfectly cooked and not chewy at all. For dessert, my date and I split the lemon mousse with brown butter streusel and strawberries. It was just the right amount of sweetness without being too much at the end of the meal.\n\nPrice: This place definitely isn't cheap, but they have a great happy hour deal that could save you some dough. It's worth it for special occasions, though.\n\nWould I return? Anytime!", "author": "Leana L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-16", "description": "For the price, I expected Leo's to be a better experience overall, but I walked away questioning whether I'd want to come here again for food or just nice photos.\n\nAs everyone else has said, this place is absolutely photo worthy. It's beautiful inside and out, particularly the front of the house with the natural light.\n\nWe arrived on a Monday evening at 5:00 pm. A waiter walked up to the hostess desk and looked and sounded about as interested in helping as he would be watching paint dry. When I asked for a table for two, his reply was, \"We're currently only serving from the Happy Hour menu, you ARE aware of that, right?\" I knew very little about Leo's before showing up so, no, I didn't know we'd arrived at the tail end of Happy Hour, but I figured we could order a drink and wait a half an hour before ordering from the dinner menu, which we did. Not sure why the attitude was necessary. We were seated in the corner table, to the right of the entry.\n\nOur waitress was bizarre. She was nice, but with a discernible air of judginess. I ordered the Bubble Bath cocktail ($14), but when my boyfriend tried to order the IPA and was told it was sold out (and had been since Saturday), he decided to go with water instead and her disapproval was noticeable. She perked up a bit when he decided to go with the Station J cocktail ($14), but as the night went on she seemed increasingly less enthusiastic about serving us. She was also a little pushy about trying to get us to order more drinks when we weren't even done with the ones we had.\n\nIt took about 20 minutes for our Happy Hour order of two Little Leo oysters to come to the table ($1.50 each), despite the restaurant not being busy. My boyfriend at least enjoyed the oysters and thought they were very fresh.\n\nJust after 5:30 (and the end of Happy Hour), we ordered the fries with dynamite sauce ($7), tea leaf salad ($15), and the raviolo ($21). Service got slower from this point on; a huge Salesforce party was being held in the back room, which was straining the servers. The fries and salad came out first. The fries were incredibly good, super hot and crispy, with a spicy dipping sauce that had tiny roe mixed in. Interesting, but the fishy flavor wasn't exactly what I wanted out of that sauce. The tea leaf salad was fine, but definitely underwhelming. If you're looking for a tea leaf salad to rival Burma Superstar's, this isn't it. It was lacking that punch of complex flavors I'm accustomed to.\n\nWe saved a portion of the salad to eat with the ravioli, but we didn't know our waitress was waiting for us to finish the salad before bringing the entree. It took a half an hour of sitting with half a plate of salad in front of us for her to come around and confusedly ask if we were done with it. We said we were still working on it, which really threw her off, and she said she hadn't brought the ravioli because our small table wouldn't fit both plates.\n\n...What?\n\nShe asked if we were ok with putting the salad plate on the ledge on the wall we were seated against and we of course had no problem with that. Her hesitancy seemed even more comical when she brought the ravioli and we comfortably fit both plates of food and our serving dishes on the tabletop. Why she took so long to approach us when she'd apparently seen we'd been sitting waiting for the ravioli for so long, I don't know, but I've never had a waiter not bring out food because they thought the table was too small to fit the plates, or wait 30 minutes to express such a minor concern.\n\nRegardless, the ravioli was stunningly plated and looked like a springtime painting, covered in edible flowers. The ravioli were unusual in construction; they were large, flat sheets of pasta filled with ricotta in a brown butter sauce and folded over to house the cheese, rather than the stuffed pasta one might associate with ravioli. The flavors were light and delicate and the heirloom tomatoes were juicy and bright.\n\nWe finished the meal with a pineapple sundae ($7), consisting of vanilla ice cream, candied pineapple, pistachios, and caramel. I thought the sundae was just the right amount of sweet without being nauseating. Perfect size for sharing, and definitely enough for one person without feeling overly stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nTotal before the tip was $93.00. The only dish that really blew me away was the ravioli, for its presentation, flavors, and portion size; while the sundae was great and the fries were tasty, it's not like spending an arm and a leg at Leo's is the only way to get a good sundae or some decent fries in the Bay Area. It feels like you're paying more for the experience and the bragging rights of saying you've dined at one of the most Instagramable locations in San Francisco. And the slow, strange service isn't exactly a lure to come back.\n\nBut there are a handful of things on the menu I'm still curious about, so I'd be willing to give Leo's one more chance to impress me with the food, rather than the decor.", "author": "Angela M."}

The oysters are quite expensive when not in happy hour so don't do this often.  \n\nNote that the front of the restaurant and bar can be really loud.   If you make it to the way back it's a bit quieter.  They also have a party room which is good to know.  \n\nBesides the raw oysters also had grilled octopus which was very nice.   Add a delicious lobster roll and was quite full.  Delicious.   The lobster roll came with chips not fries like some pictures show.

I went often on my own dime, but frequently suggested it for business lunches given the higher prices.  My last couple of visits, however, were disappointing.\n\nI have a tendency to stick with the same order if I enjoyed it the first time, so it wasn't until recently after I confirmed a shellfish allergy (Yes, I am heartbroken.) that I ordered entrees other than the lobster roll with skinny fries (and the Leo's deviled egg).\n\nClearly, Leo's is a seafood restaurant, so I guess it shouldn't have come as a complete surprise that the disappointing items were all non-seafood.  For example, the crostini of the beef tartare was rock hard (almost inedible, but worry not, this carboholic powered through and ate most of it anyway).  Now that I can no longer enjoy seafood, I probably won't come to Leo's again.  But, if you decide to go, stick to what they should be good at . . . seafood; and prepare to pay a lot for it.", "author": "Christina L."}

I've been lusting over Leo's Oyster Bar for about a year now and finally made it in for some fresh oysters and cocktails. I made a reservation for 5:45 pm on a Saturday and while I'm glad our spot was held, we probably would've been just fine without it. The host led us to a secret-feeling back room that's just as fun and kitschy as the front, just sans natural light. Upon sitting down we took a look at both the food and drink menus. I'll note that if you're not into seafood, there are really only a couple things you can eat here (even the deviled eggs has some sort of seafood in them). \n\nWe ordered a round of drinks and a half dozen oysters--oysters are definitely on the pricy side, but really good. We tried two of the Grassy Bars from CA, two of the Drake's Bays from CA, one of the Irish Points from PEI, and one Saquish from MA. Love that they serve them with mignonette and green chile--I've never had green chile on oysters before, but I'm a fan.\n\nThe drinks were yummy, although a tad sweet and not very booze forward. I ordered the Garden Party to start--if you're into pretty cocktails, this is one to order. We were there celebrating my birthday and our very nice server suggested a tequila popsicle cocktail. This drink was as refreshing as it was fun and was honestly more boozy than the first one--not sure what it's called, but I would suggest trying it. I will say that my friend had their spin on a spicy marg and the last sip was so spicy that she was in pain for a little while.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a lovely spot to start your evening for some pretty vibes and not-super-boozy cocktails. This neighborhood, like most in SF, is very walkable for a post-HH dinner in the Financial District, Chinatown, or Union Square.", "author": "Megan R."}

I LOVE the decor of this place.\n\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered tater tots and leo's deviled egg. Five dollars for one deviled egg is pricey, but it was SO worth it. The oyster on top with some kind of buffalo sauce, really put a new twist on the deviled egg. The tater tots definitely weren't what I expected, but they had good flavor.\n\nAs an entree, I got the lobster roll which was good, but I don't think it was worth $35.

I believe there's three rooms as I saw other guest going to another back room. \n\nOur server was kind and we were quickly given our menus and asked if we wanted sparkling or still water. You were also given a menu for the days oyster picks. Our waiter was kind enough to describe each oyster and where it was from. Each oyster cost about 4 to 6 dollars each. They also had a great selection of cocktails and I highly recommend the garden party. It was refreshing and delicious. \n\nUpon looking at the menu we decided we were going to have an array of appetizers along with oysters. We ordered the french fries the shishito peppers, tater tots, butterfish confit and half a dozen oysters. The highlight of my night was the oysters and unfortunately everything else was \"okay.\" We also never got out shishito peppers but our waiter apologized and I was feeling very underwhelmed by the rest of our dinner. \n\nAside from great photo ops I would only comeback for happy hour.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-17", "description": "I had long dreamed of having a seafood tower at Leo's, and talked it up to my friends. We finally went after work one Thursday, and were sort of disappointed. It's not a set tower/plateau as I am used to. This can be good if you like controlling what you get, but the presentation was lacking and I felt like it wasn't worth the price. Bafflingly too, for an oyster bar, the staff are either not knowledgeable or coordinated. My friends described flavor profiles and what they enjoy in oysters, and got wildly conflicting recommendations. \n\nI would skip the \"composed\" oysters, unless you're okay paying an extra dollar for a small shaving of melon or veggies, or extra $3 - $5 for an even smaller amount of uni or caviar. I am especially bitter that the cocktail shrimp was $4 per shrimp, and ONE crab leg was $14. Two lobster claws were equally painful at $26 per order. I am not a cheap person. I will pay a good amount for things that are worth it: anything rare or unusual, or perfectly executed. I understand raw seafood has its price, but I have never felt as badly bilked as I did with Leo's raw menu.\n\nI also felt the servers were very pushy in trying to get us to order more, to the point where I was getting annoyed. We made it clear that we were there to have the seafood plateau - which we had already spent a good amount on - would order something from the cooked menu once the kitchen opened at 5 pm, and were happy with our drinks. At first I thought they were being attentive by coming over to refill our waters or freshen our napkins, but it soon became clear it was always to ask if we would order more. It's a shame, because the ambiance could be great for a date night or special occasion with friends (this was our reunion after over a year of not seeing each other, so I really didn't appreciate all the interruptions). I would like to give them another shot, because the dinner menu sounds incredible and like it could be worth the pricing.", "author": "Cat N."}

There were a couple things I had that I didn't love, but damn, this was one of the better meals I've had this year!\n\nThe hits:\n\nCaviar bite with caviar, creme fraiche, and truffled beet pancake - HOLY HELL THIS BITE IS FANTASTIC. It's literally a bite, but wow... I could have eaten these all night long and nothing else. The perfect balance of salty, sweet, and creamy. The beet isn't overwhelming at all (I'm not a huge beet person), nor is the truffle. The tiny little chives and crystals of salt on top are just enough garnish to feel fancy without being pretentious, and the little pancake is a pillowy puff of goodness below a brief taste of ocean. I can't with this. So. Good.\n\nLobster roll with uni butter, brioche, and french fries - this is the best lobster roll I've had in SF. Not ever, but definitely in SF. There was literally nothing in it other than lobster and butter, which is how it should be. Nothing to get in the way... the lobster was fresh, tender, and flavorful. The fries were crispy, topped with flakes of parsley, and served with a side of aioli. This dish truly let the lobster shine and I enjoyed every bite.\n\nSmoked tuna dip with roe and togarashi crackers - all the pieces here were fantastic. The crackers were super crunchy and a little spicy. OMG to the smoke on the dip. It's like eating wood out of the smoker, in the absolute best way. The texture of the cracker paired well with the softer quality of the dip and the roe on top was a nice touch. I wouldn't have minded more of it.\n\nThe others:\n\nJapanese hamachi with charred avocado and sea salt - the fish was super fresh. The hamachi itself was perfect and I liked the earthy flavors brought in from the olive oil. The rest of the dish was kinda just ok though... the avocado was nicely charred, but it was also slightly brown and not quite ripe. The dish also didn't need the extra salt.\n\nCaviar bite with salmon roe, salmon tartare and capers - this one was much fishier than the first caviar bite we had. I was ok with it, though it was a turn off for my friend. Between the salmon and the capers this was also a very salty bite, though it was slightly balanced out by the dill. It was served in a little mini pie crust... the first bite was good for me, but as I got to the crust a mustard-type flavor kicked in and between that and the thick breading, I lost the fish flavors I was enjoying.\n\nCaviar bite with trout roe and broiled trout - slightly gingery, slightly smoky, a bit of soy, crispy broiled trout. I liked this bite, though not as much as the first.\n\nOverall, I loved Leo's and I'd definitely come back. While pricy and small portioned, I thought the quality and freshness of the fish largely justified the prices and our server was beyond excellent.", "author": "Samantha B."}

We especially appreciated the chef coming out to apologize to us for the wait on the oysters and gave us two complimentary ones. \n\nThe not so good: The other food that we got, the smoked tuna dip (okay) and clam chowder (good), came out pretty late and out of the order that our waiter mentioned it would be in. Service overall was alright considering that the restaurant was full while we were dining. I would have given this place 4 stars, but docked off one because we paid with large bills and waited to get change back. However, a few minutes later we saw our waiter pocketing the change that we were expecting back at the cash drawer. We had planned on tipping fairly close to the amount that was taken, but I believe that it's just common courtesy to not assume that we didn't need change back or at least ask if we needed the change.", "author": "Tien N."}

The middle room has a much smaller bar, & is far more low key than the front room.  The back room was hosting a private event, so I couldn't check it out.  The palm tree, pineapple, island/plantation decor is fabulous.  This theme runs throughout each room, & the vibe is very old school, very relaxed, while still possessing an element of sophistication.\n\nFrank Sinatra meets Tommy Bahama, & they get along swimmingly.\n\nThe menu continues the elegant vibe...foie gras toast.  Caviar.  And of course, oysters for days.  \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't have caviar this visit.  But the foie gras toast, & the oysters, were fantastic.  I can also recommend the seafood bisque, perfect on a typical SF chilly night, & the crab & lobster cake.  Perfectly moist, w the crab & lobster presence well balanced.\n\nService impressively balances that tightrope between polished & easygoing...which completely befits the whole culture of Leo's.\n\nAnother successful addition to the Park Tavern family.\nAnd a nice escape for a couple of hours.\n\n4 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

We were seated in the back, I didn't particularly like the decor: the art deco theme with leafy-patterned wallpaper, gold-colored lights, and their cabana chairs.

And it was hard to miss the many, many social media pics of not just their lobster roll, but the tropical, chic tiki bar-esque decor. I wanted in. \n\nBetween the four of us, I'd be surprised if there was something we didn't sample between the raw bar and a variety of both Small and Large Plates. I thought the deviled eggs were great, the fries crisp as can be, & the complimentary espresso mousse for dinner was exceptionally rich. Tater Tots and Crab and Lobster Cake were heavy, but not on flavor. The crab or shrimp cocktail didn't have a taste or texture I would come back for. With these negatives, I wasn't surprised when the lobster roll turned out to be just meh. \n\nThe decor is a gorgeous throwback to an era decidedly not ours (hats off to Ken Fulk for his vision.)

Came here with two other friends for drinks and appetizers and was very disappointed. \n\nI'll start with the good: I will give them props for the design/ambiance. The decor was cute and inviting, albeit the lighting was so dark you could hardly appreciate it.\n\nNow, the bad:\n\nThough our own fault, we didn't reserve ahead of time and knew we'd end up eating at the bar, which is typically a-ok with us. However, the bartender who served us was rude and short with us the entire time which didn't make for an enjoyable experience.\n\nWe each had a drink and ordered the following appetizers:\n-Mookie Blues Oysters\n-Ahi Tuna Crudo\n-House-Made Tater Tot bites\n-Wild Mushroom Toast bites\n-Farro Risotto\n\nThe crudo and tater tots were yummy but the rest was unsatisfying. Additionally, all of the portions were TINY. Usually when my friends and I go out for \"drinks and apps\" and order 4-5 dishes we're full enough to skip dinner, but this was absolutely was not the case at Leo's. We were so hungry we went and got burgers and fries afterwards! The section labeled \"Bites to Share\" says that each serving comes with 4 pieces, and each piece is literally ONE BITE. Even the crudo which wasn't labeled under the \"bites\" section of the menu was one bite per person. The risotto entree was also quite small and was not an appropriate size for a main dish. \n\nThe worst part was the tab - after tax and tip the bill came out to over $150 for not enough food to fill the stomach of a 5 year old. \n\nThe combination of small portions, subpar food, high prices and bad service is a recipe for boycott.

We had cocktails while we waited for our table to be ready. The restaurant seemed full, and busy but certainly not packed.\n\nI had a dirty vodka martini, and it was delicious. My boyfriend had a maitai for some reason??? He enjoyed the drink but didn't love the glass it came in, I told him real men drink bourbon... but thats a whole different story. The bartenders were efficient and moved quickly. Everyone was very pleasant.\n\nI was happy when the host, came and lead us to a table in the back room. (Same room I was in, the last time I came to Leo's in October.)\nAs usual, the decor was beautiful, warm and inviting. We were quickly greeted by the server, who happened to be the same one as I got last time. The girl with the tattoos, Celiss.\n\nShe was very nice, attentive and described most of the menu to us, right away. I immediately knew what I was going to order. \n\nThough I love oysters, I very much prefer East Coast oysters since they tend to be more shallow and saltier. I did see they had oysters from PEI  but I decided to skip them since I am going back to NYC in a few weeks where I'll live off of Oysters for 7 days.\n\nI really wanted Tuna Tar Tar, but she kindly told me that they didn't have any, (bummer) but she recommended I try the Ahi Tuna Apple dish. I started with that, and fell in love. The tuna was very fresh and the apple was crisp. I've never had the combination of the 2, but I am glad I got to try it. Great recommendation! Kudos to the chef for a delicious appetizer.\n\nI spotted bone marrow on the menu and of course I had to order it. I love bone marrow and actively complain that I don't eat it nearly enough since no restaurants seem serve it, which I understand. Every time I see it on a menu, I always order it because if they have it, chances are that they know to cook it. The bone marrow was delicious, they serve it with toast and it spreads on like butter. I wanted to order 9 additional orders to go.\n\nWe had some more drinks, I don't even remember what they were.\nBut I'm sure they were tasty.\n\nFor the entree, I decided to go with the Short Rib and I 100% made the right choice. The short rib was tender, the potatoes were tasty and the butter that came with it, was delicious. I could literally bathe in a bathtub of this Short Rib with a potato puree, and I don't care what anyone thinks of this.\n\nMy boyfriend got the salmon, which was super fresh. It was cooked to a perfect Medium. I love that they didn't over cook it.\n\nFor dessert we had the apple crisp, along with the bittersweet chocolate mouse topped off with gold (for a real princess of course...) in the cutest pineapple shaped dish, along side a birthday candle.\nWe also had a creme de mint, after dinner cocktail which was mixed to perfection by the lovely bartender, Matt who never fails to mix a perfect drink.\n\nI over all had a great time and I would recommend Leo's to any of my friends, neighbors, friendamies, uber drivers, colleages, etc etc etc...\n\nThank you for the continuous warm hospitality and delicious meals/drinks.", "author": "Tati C."}

We told her it was our first time here. She recommended a few items for us and got us started. Their food is tapas style. Small portion.

The puffed vermicelli didn't go too well with it. Last, our main entree was the lobster roll. After eating all the other items, we were full by now. Good chunks of lobster in warm toasted bread.

Don't get this one. My bf and I love foie gras and uni, but man this dish was just not meant to be.\n-Japanese Hamachi with avocado, sea salt, and scallion - YUM. This was a good one. Not the best hamachi I ever had, but pretty damn good.\n-Leo's Louie combo (crab and shrimp) with gem lettuce, mache, radish, fennel, tobiko and egg. This was a great dish, really fresh ingredients. The dressing was a little too pungent and sour for my taste though.\n-Lobster roll with Uni butter, brioche and French fries - YUM. I hope you get this one. We shared every plate for the night, and what's great about this restaurant is that they just split the plate ahead of time for you. French fries great too. I didn't really taste the uni in the butter, but hey, it was an awesome lobster roll overall. \n\nDrinks:\nFantastic, actually. Probably one of the highlights of my night! My bf got the Mai Tai which was delicious, and came in this really cute tiki-themed cup. I got the Skinny Dip (vodka, aperol, watermelon, lime, tonic popsicle) which was fun - never had a drink with a popsicle in it before! Drinks were on the medium-strong side, and definitely worth $15/each. If I had to come here again, it would be for the drinks.\n\nAmbiance:\nVery cute inside, but hopefully you'll get to sit in the main dining area. We were shoved in this weird back room, with no windows. It was a weird experience. I didn't like being put back there - it made me feel forgotten about. Anyway, decorations are still cute in the back room, and overall the restaurant is super loud, and dark, which is frustrating.\n\nService:\nAlthough very friendly overall, I had one disappointing interaction. A lady who came to bus our empty plates from our table, asked us how we liked the dish. We told her that the Foie Gras toast was too salty. She said, \"I'll go talk to the chef about it.\" We never got an apology, or anything from the chef. That was disappointing. I mean, it's great they said they'd do something about it, but even more disappointing when you anticipate it and they DON'T. \n\nWas it worth it?\nNot for $135/person. I won't return. I know I'm being nit-picky, but if I'm paying that much, I would like to have a table in the main room, with service that follows up with their customers.

First of all I still can't get over the adorable decor, I really felt like I was almost transported back to a cool little cocktail bar in the 1950's in Hawaii. It had an amazing almost island vibe. \nI am a bloody mary gal, so I ordered their bloody mary. It was delicious and exactly what I was looking for. We also ordered a bottle of wine as well. They had a pretty killer wine list both by the glass and bottle. \nTo eat we got two dozen oysters and got a few of every one they were offering that day. We also got each of their composed oysters, some cherry stone clams as well as some pickled king crab and house made pickles. Everything was absolutely delicious, the oysters were fresh and shucked to perfection, the composed oysters were perfectly balanced. Service was attentive with out being intrusive. The only downfall is that we all got there right after 2:30 which is when they stop serving their lunch menu and only serve items from their raw bar. \nNext time I am in San Francisco I will be sure to head back to Leo's to get more yummy oysters and this time get to try their delicious sounding lunch or dinner menu!", "author": "Roxy H."}

The fries and the \"dynamite\" sauce was amazing! I'm guessing it's a mix of siracha and mayo and little something extra? It's damn good. \nFor starters we ordered some lil leo oysters, and some other creek oysters and they were delicious and fresh. Nothing unusual to their oysters. They did serve it with a green chile vodka sauce but that wasn't my thing. \n\nI had a Leo's Louie salad with king crab. It wasn't what I was expecting in terms of looks but it tasted delicious!

Uhh...friendship, booze, and food?? But it's a nice touch that they ask. When we arrived, they brought us to the far back side. I mean. Far. We passed three thresholds to get to this back tiki-style room that evidently used to be outdoors, but they turned into a private event space.

Hamachi was very fresh, and the charred avocado was buttery.\n\nOysters (Hammersley, Hog Island, Little Leo, Olympia): Good general assortment. It got better and better, until the Olympia...which to me was too small and didn't have much flavor. Sad.\n\nHouse Tater Tot: Delicious. Seriously get this. It's got the fry of the tater tot, but with some delicious tapenade on top that's just yum.\n\nSalmon Tartare: Really good, and pretty nice portion. Very light and not fishy at all!\n\nCrab Cake: Bacon across the lightest horseradish ever. So delicious.

And hella generous with the fries.\n\nMussels: Very filling and SO good. The bread accompanying it wasn't as great, but we started using the fries...which was worth it. I kind of wish the bread was thicker and just sauce-sopping. Mmm...delicious. \n\nWalnut Cookies: They gave us these (perhaps because we became their showpiece?), and they were pretty good.

More specifically, it made me think of a place one of Blanche's men would take her before their all night rendezvous. Gotta wine and dine to get in that cookie jar...\n\nOur Plan A (The Morris) fell through since their opening was delayed so my friend and I decided to go to Leo's Oyster Bar after having sat in our bookmarks for months. \n\nDon't even think about coming here without reservations unless you come super early and sit at the bar. It's super cramped and tables are literally inches apart so only come here in pairs. Finding street parking was pretty easy on a Saturday night. \n\nMy friend and I arrived early for our 5:30 pm reservations. We were told our table wasn't ready so we grabbed a drink at the bar which has the most uncomfortable wicker (?) bar stools.

They were not as visually appealing as the ones at the front bar and didn't taste as good. \n \n*Honey Lynn: Honey infused gin, absolut elyx, lillet, lemon bitters ($14): http://bit.ly/2dIVSl7\nThe Honey Lynn was their take on a Vesper but there was no honey taste. \n\n*Banana Daiquiri: Pampero rum, banana liquor, lime, spices ($14): http://bit.ly/2eoZf31\nMy friend's Banana Daiquiri oddly smelled and tasted like peach schnapps so it was exchanged for something else.\n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\nAs others have mentioned, the food prices are $$$$ which is fine IF the food was amazing.

I believe they don't take same day reservations on OpenTable, so that's always been a deterrent. (I don't like waiting, so I tend to gravitate towards places that take reservations.)\n\nOn Wednesday, August 24th, I was having a drink down the street with Peter L. He said Leo's was a few doors down and it didn't look too busy. Perfect time to drop by, right?! We stopped in around 7:45pm for dinner. They told us it would be about a 20 min wait. I asked them to text me when our table was ready since we were going to grab a drink elsewhere. They happily obliged. About 20 mins later, I got the text. We were seated around 8:15pm.\n\nRaw Bar:\n*Kumamoto - CA ($4.25 ea) \u00d72\n*Peter's Point - MA ($4 ea) \u00d72\n*Diamonds and Pearls: oyster and caviar ($10 ea) \u00d72\n\nGotta get some oysters at an oyster bar, right?! I'm not super versed in oysters, but I know I like kumamotos. We just randomly picked Peter's point cuz of Peter's name. I chose the caviar oysters since I love that combination. All oysters were fresh with a nice clean, ocean flavor. Yum!\n\nRegular Menu:\n*Leo's deviled egg: with wing fried oyster ($5)\n*Baked oyster, ahi tuna, seaweed and togarashi ($5)\n*Crab and lobster cake, cucumber and horseradish ($17)\n*Toast: Foie gras, ginger soy, scallions and uni butter ($20)\n*Seafood bisque with lobster, king crab and rock shrimp ($19)\n*New england lobster roll, cultured uni butter, brioche and french fries ($32)\n\nPeter and I tend to over order, so yes, the two of us ordered all this. The deviled egg and baked oyster were fun. I did like the play on the deviled egg. I love crab cakes, so I had to try the crab and lobster cake. Full of seafood, but I found the texture on the inside to be a little too mushy. It was contrasted by the crispy exterior. The foie gras toast was delicious! So rich and decadent! There is a slight sweetness to the toast, which I wasn't expecting, but I didn't mind it much. (I'm not a huge fan of sweet and savory together.) I loved the bisque! Creamy and full of seafood flavor! I thought the lobster roll was okay, but I was super full by the time it came out. I just remember not tasting the uni butter. Since I adore uni, I wanted the flavor to be stronger.\n\nDessert & Wine:\n*Blood orange creamsicle float ($7)\n*Blanc de blancs, pierre moncuit-delos, grand cru, le mesnil-sur-oger, champagne NV ($85)\n*Brut, domaine carneros, napa valley, california 2012 ($60)\n\nWhat's dinner without drinks?! I didn't want dessert, but Peter did, so he ordered the float. I remember taking a sip and thinking it was okay, but I'm not really a dessert person. I definitely enjoyed the bubbly, but we totally drank the bottles backwards. We should have started with the brut and then gone into the blanc de blanc. Regardless, I enjoyed both bottles of bubbly.\n\nOur server was super sweet and fun. We had two seats at the bar, so she was kind enough to split the soup and lobster roll so it was easy to share. I do wish servers would ask before doing that though. Visually, I don't like it when orders are split. This is just a pet peeve of mine.

Tucked away in an alley-esque setting, when you walk into Leo's you feel a little more fabulous.\n\nWe were seated in the back, The Hideaway. Super cute decor and awesome music (really awesome). It feels really private back there, which is nice! We ordered a dozen oysters, ranging from $3.5 each to close to $5. They were good, tasty, but in my opinion, overpriced (I can't complain too much, given the price of everything in SF). We ordered fries, the mushroom toast, hamachi and bone marrow. Everything tasted great, the Mushroom toast was delicious (throw some truffle on anything and I'm in). I do think that the price vs. portions is a bit skewed ...I understand that it's seafood and I know the drill, trust me, but nothing was mind blowing enough for me to say the price was justified. The fries were really good, if you're into some fries....\n\nOh, there's more - then we ordered the salmon (large plates), oysters carbonara and the crab cake (yes, it's just 1 crab cake ...no \"s\"). Again, good food, good ingredients. Very tasty and nothing felt super heavy or made me regret my decision in what I ate that evening, which is always nice. We didn't order any cocktails, but enjoyed some good wine and beer - always a safe bet. They have a good selection of wines/sparkling wines and beer as well.\n\nI would come back, maybe just for some drinks and the cool vibe here.

Wow was this a delicious dish. I love the traditional fermented tea leaf salad. Paired with the fresh tuna it went to a whole new level of deliciousness. I highly recommend trying it - an order was great to split for two but you may just want one for yourself! \n\nChocolate mousse - it tasted rich and dense with a slight coffee flavor. And they served it with gold flakes in a super cute gold pineapple dish. \n\nWhat we also ordered but didn't love as much: \nBone marrow (sure it was very good but it was not my favorite personally) \n\nRaw clams (they are super chewy and briney if you like that kind of thing) \n\nMussels (I'm a huge fan of mussels and the ones they served were large and hearty but the sauce didn't really permeate the mussels well.

I'm pretty sure Ken Fulk did the design work at Leo's because most of the other restaurants I mentioned above have the same \"feel\". Leo's takes on a more tropical vibe from the 50's and it makes you want to order the classics. \n\nThat being said, I ordered a Gibson martini and some of the pickled vegtables because that's how I roll. The cocktail was fantastic and the vegtables equally as good.

My friend and I walked in before another event to check Leo's out, and we were able to grab two of the last remaining bar seats around 6pm on a Friday. It was definitely busy in the restaurant as well, so reservations are highly recommended to avoid any waiting. We tried:\n\n-Chelsea Gems (Washington, $4.25/ea) & Oyster Eliose (Celery & Melon, $5/ea) [http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dTeI9-EUmaLAJc1pALuOAg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: We ordered 4 of the Chelsea's and 2 of the Eloise. I loved the size of the Chelsea's since they were Kumamoto sized, but they were a little too briny for my preference. I wouldn't get these again. However, the Eloise oysters were delicious, and I loved the combination of the celery and melon on it. Recommended!\n-Foie Gras Toast (Ginger, Soy, Scallions, Uni Butter, $20, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3MSjiJJ_N7aCXOpXmVpqDQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Holy foie gras, I loved the creaminess of the foie, and the overall flavors. It was a tiny bit too salty for me, and overall this dish is super super rich, but it was worth trying once if you love foie and uni.\n\nDrinks will run you around $12/each, which seems to be the average for the swankier bar/restaurants in the city.

Both cocktails were delicious and beautifully presented. I absolutely loved the herbs and small, dried flowers in my drink. Since we knew we'd be there for longer than one drink, we ordered 6 oysters, Leo's deviled eggs, and the classic French fries with dynamite sauce. The oysters were super fresh, the deviled eggs were overflowing with fried oyster goodness, and the dynamite sauce was addictive.

I and 3 friends dined here last night for a friend's birthday dinner and we had a variety of things but the plates are all pretty tiny and come at a hefty price. To start we split 16 oysters with 4 different types and each was prepared and tasted so fresh. We sat in front of the shucker and were able to see the care and detail he put plating each oyster. Next, we had the following for our meal:\n- 3 Leo's deviled egg with wing fried oyster ($6 per egg) and an Uni butter baked oyster. 5/5 on the deviled eggs - the wing sauce and crispy oyster paired nicely.  My friend wasn't a huge fan of the uni butter oyster. \n- Rock shrimp toast - 2/5. Bland taste and thought the toast could have been crispier\n- Steak tartar - 4/5 - A Nice big dollop of Uni on top gave it an interesting kick. Enough for 3 people to split and have a couple bites. \n- Japanese hamachi - 4 single pieces, nice fish but nothing that blew me away - 3/5\n- French fries - nice size portion and sauce was amazing - 5/5\n\nFor drinks, we started with a bottle of sparkling rose, 4 garden parties (so beautiful and tasty - you have to get), 4 espresso cocktails for dessert and also split their chocolate mouse. The chocolate mousse was so so tiny but like a thick brownie batter... so tasty but if you're in the mood for dessert, probably better to each get your own or at least only split with 2 people. Looking back, we had a lot of alcohol but not food and our bill came to $400 pre-tip. I'll probably be back for a cocktail and oysters during happy hour or after work, which will likely still amount to an expensive hh but will not be back for a full meal.", "author": "Aryn C."}

The tator tot with brandade and tapenade had good crunch for untraditional tots. I savored each piece of the Foie Gras Toast. Surprised by the soy sauce. As a native San Franciscan i've had a lot of Clam Chowder and this is one of the best i've had. I don't rank the Seafood Bisque as highly but i doubt it has the cream and butter the Clam Chowder has :) Salmon was perfectly cooked and the piccata sauce gave it a nice luxurious lemon sauce.\n\nService was not pretentious at all. They were extremely friendly and welcoming. We were well taken care of and the highlight was at the end of night when we asked if they had any mint, gum or similar candy. The restaurant didn't officially have any but they asked around and a staff member had some altoids which they placed on Leo's imprinted coaster over a glass plate. Best presentation i've ever seen for altoids.\n\nWe're not light eaters (or drinkers) so the bill grew very quickly.

The food and drink menu are spectacular, the service is outstanding, and the quality of the food you get is fantastic. It's rare that you find a place where each dish is so thoughtfully created and for the employees to love their job so much that they'll tell you about it. Leo's is a rare new gem in this city of all too many disappointing one visit wonders restaurants.\n\nThe SO and I actually only came to Leo's for drinks around 10pm on a Friday night. When we got there, the place was packed. If you've never seen any photos of the place, the walls are pink with tree designs painted on. It's got a sort of tiki bar vibe, but also 1950s swanky classy oyster bar vibe that cater well to the clientele for this place -- mostly saw people that were a bit older dressed fairly well, so basically the FiDi crew. It's not particularly large, and is more conducive to smaller parties. It's basically split into bar seats and small table seats -- people at the bar definitely looked like they were going to bump elbows.\n\nFortunately for us, the waiter brought us to the back of the restaurant where they actually have a not so secret overflow room called The Hideaway. The Hideaway serves drinks and bar bites, which is exactly what we wanted. It was a fairly small room, same decor as outside, but the Sinatra playing in the background made the vibe perfect for date night. \n\nI got the Banana daiquiri and the SO got the mah johng, and the mad men. Most interesting thing about the daiquiri was that the texture of the drink was actually like the consistency of a typical mixed drink rather than a slushy like mixture. Each drink had a generous portion of alcohol, yet the contents of the drink worked really well together. \n\nFor food, we got the salmon roe, smoked salmon on an everything chip, tuna toast, 2 Fanny Bay oysters, and a blood orange creamsicle. We loved the food. Everything was super thoughtfully created on their part -- the waitress told us about how the everything chip was meant to mimic an everything bagel. The oysters were also the freshest oysters I've ever had -- super meaty, but so fresh and rich in flavor and deliciousness. Each bar bite had a lot of small parts contributing to the dish, but unlike other restaurants, it was really apparent what each ingredient was doing on the plate. It didn't seem like it was there for visual garnish, it all improved the flavor experience.\n\nThe most outstanding part of the night was undoubtedly the service. It was evident that the waitresses were having a great time as they would often dance over to the table to chat with us, they were super super personable and fun to talk to and talked to us about the head chef's commitment to fresh, great oysters (they shuck them together as a staff and then if the quality if no up to par, send it back to the source). Most interesting, they told us about how much they loved their job and how they felt like their managers cared for them and cared for the quality of the food that they were putting out there. This effusive positive attitude is something I rarely see in other restaurants, and certainly an often overlooked component about what helps define one's experience at a restaurant.\n\nI really can't tell you enough about how much I love this place. The final price for everything was high ($100 pre tip), but if you're willing to splurge a little for the quality and the experience, I think it's completely worth it. There are a million other money-suck restaurants in this city, but Leo's is certainly not in that crowd.\n\ntldr; probably my favorite new restaurant in SF right now; delicious food and drinks, great service! excellent place for a date night and probably smaller groups", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Yes, Leo's has an extensive oyster list, but I was disappointed it wasn't the real deal.\n\nVery cute place...loved the wallpaper...that has more of a cocktail versus oyster bar vibe. Ordered a dozen of the raw Humboldt oysters (thought I couldn't go wrong with the only (?) local oyster on the menu) and disliked them: fatty and tasteless, not briny at all. The hamachi crudo...3 slices of hamachi and two teeny slices of dried avocado for $17, really?...was also tasteless. The salmon roe appetizer...three tiny puff pastry cups with salmon and roe, $18...at that point we were just DONE and didn't stay for entrees. \n\nI rarely complain about prices, but in this case, they really were excessive. The bill for those three dishes and the corking fee for our wine was $150.

I tried The Mad Man cocktail made with rye, benedictine & citrus, perfect HH cocktail and you can't stop at just 1 -go on and try; I double dog dare you-.\n\nWhen you do get your fluky hands on the food menu then order the deviled eggs with fried oyster (best in town); I can just keep stuffing those suckers in my face. The sea urchin toasts was a salty creamy fantasy and that tea leaf salad with Ahi Tuna and charred avocado (all extra $$ of course) would put a Burmese restaurant to shame.\n\nAlso, skip the Lobster roll as the brioche gets greasy and go for the Lobster and Crab cakes instead and while we're luxuriously prancing around all over the menu, dodge them baked oysters as well because if it ain't raw (or sometimes deep fried) then \"it ain't worth the whiskey\";*hiccup*..", "author": "Lo-an L."}

Being from New England, I am known to be a seafood snob, and I'm usually never impressed...but oh...my..god...this place is phenomenal.\n\nWe started off each with a raw oyster, and these were great -- highly recommend.  Great presentation, great taste. We then each got a \"Leo's Deviled Egg with Wing Fried Oyster,\" these were great as well.    We tried the \"Osetra, Creme Fraiche an Truffled Beet Pancake\" -- which everyone went crazy for.  These are so rich and flavorful, a must try -- like seriously, you have to get these.  Also, do try the \"Sea Urchin, Ginger, Soy, and Scallion Toast\" -- seriously so flavorful and rich -- melts in your mouth (we all loved these too).  \n\nThe \"House-Made Tater Tot, Brandade and Tapenade\" is also a good pic -- but FYI they aren't your average tater tots.  There are like five huge pieces of tots, and they kind of taste like hash browns...but like REALLY GOOD hash browns.  The french fries were french fries, so they were good (nothing crazy).  \n\nOkay I have to end this with the things I did NOT like.  Honestly, the clam chowder...was NOT good.  Like I said, I'm from New England, so I take my chowder very seriously.  I did not like the consistency and the bacon in it/the flavor.  I would not recommend (no one else liked it either).  Also, the mussels....\"Mussels en Papillote, Tomato, Pancetta, Olive, and Chili\" -- I'm sorry I did not like it at all.  They just tasted so strange, not good at all -- and I LOVE mussels, I've never had one I didn't like...until last night. (and again, the group felt the same way)\n\nOh and dessert..we got the chocolate mousse and the strawberry sunday -- both bomb.  Definitely recommend both of them, but will say the chocolate mousse comes in a pineapple shaped dish...soooo it's so Instagram worthy. (lol)\n\nOkay overall, definitely my favorite restaurant in San Francisco right now -- and I highly recommend.  The decor is phenomenal -- its like chic havana style.  The music was this awesome salsa playlist, which I loved.  We sat in \"the hideaway\" in the back -- and ummmmmmmmm it was great.  I only want to sit back there in the future.

I don't actually remember the drink's name, but I remember it had flowers and some sparkling wine. The food I ordered was delicious. I started off with oysters - 3 different types - Grassy Bar, Hog Island, and Irish Point. They were all good, but I think my favorite was the Hog Island. Definitely a great oyster. \n\nI then got the dish off of the 7x7 listing - Leo's cobb. I decided to go with a combination of crab and shrimp instead of one or the other. It was beautifully plated and really good, but it was just not enough food. I next decided to go with a toast point. Mine came with crab. \n\nSince I was by myself, I decided to go with sitting at the bar. It was a great place to enjoy some food and drinks. I got there around 7 and it wasn't too hard to find a spot at the bar, but honestly, by the time it was about 7:45/8, the place got packed with people.

Arriving around 12:30 pm with reservations, the restaurant was crowded, both at the bar and dining area.  We were seated at the second table from the door so I didn't get much chance to see the rest of the restaurant.  Most of the tables that line the front are two or four toppers while the bar sits to the left.  The walkways are narrow so beware if you are claustrophobic.  After some brief discussion about the menu, we gave our waiter our orders.\nWe shared two small bites or snacks, the assorted housemade pickles and smoked trout dip, trout roe, and chips; great conversation while munching on this, using fingers and toothpicks to try the different things.  For my main meal, I ordered Leo's Louie combination (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HscW7e73Amn83Cji7-QHNw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q), which featured rock shrimp and King crab meat.  For $22.00, the seafood portion is generous and liked that all of the ingredients were segregated so nothing got soggy.  \nNormally, I would eat something more substantial, but both of my lunch companions were in a health conscious mood, prompting my nutritious choice.  It was actually filling enough for me.  Service was decent and not particularly memorable as glasses were filled and empty plates removed.  \nYes, I would like to return and, judgining by Cherylynn N.'s (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg) dinner experience, lunch is probably the better choice.", "author": "Mike C."}

No apology or any explanation. She would avoid my area and I had to go find her to ask her what's taking so long. She was snappy back at me saying it's coming. It's been an hour....If the kitchen is backed up or you forgot to put in the rest of the order then own up to it. I think waiting an hour for the rest of our food to come without explanation is unacceptable and for you to give me attitude is wrong. The tuna salad finally came and it was super acidic. When the lobster roll came I had to take it to go. I only have an hour lunch and I was gone for an hour and a half already. I couldn't even complain to the manager.

The place was packed and fortunately they have a back lounge area for walk ins. It reminded me of a Tiki bar - not all of the umbrellas and candles, but a smaller space with actually more room than the main dining room.\n\nThe front room is long and narrow with tables on the right side - fairly close to each other a small space then the bar patrons - and there was no seat available in the place by the time we got there on a Friday night at 730pm. And there shouldn't be. I'm a big guy so getting back to this area in the tiny path between the tables on the right and the people at the bar was not fun, but that's my problem not there's.\n\nIt's a weird little menu - very small print - Bring those Readers!!\nWe started with a selection of the West Coast Oysters and a 'Raw Bay Scallop' in it's shell. The manager recommended it and it was very small but quite tasty. I highly recommend trying it - apparently it's a Thing now - to eat raw scallops. I'm so out of it. \n\nBob had the Salmon - excellent $27.00 and I had the Lobster Roll for $32.00 - it was okay. It was good but they made up for the lack of Lobster by it being more like a Lobster slaw which does Not bring the Lobster flavor I'm looking for for $32 Bucks. The large plates also known as Dinner in my world - there are only 4 to choose from. I guess this is for nibblers. There's a Short Rib meal, Mussels (which are more appetizer to me), Salmon, & the Lobster Roll. They have a nice wine list. Decidedly this is more of a small plates / after work hors d'oeuvres hour. \n\nAlso the service was excellent, and even though the tables were smaller in the back lounge I liked it more - more space, not as loud, attentive service.", "author": "Rew C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-05", "description": "Every year we have a restaurant with which we become obsessed. It even gets a mention in our holiday letters. This year, it's looking like that restaurant is Leo's Oyster Bar. We've been 3x the past few weeks and have tried nearly everything on the menu. \nTL;DR EVERYTHING IS FANTASTIC. You can hardly go wrong. \n\n* Raw bar: My new favorite in the city. Nice oyster selection, \"fancy oysters\" with pickled tomatoes and horseradish, prawns, raw clams, and the most delicious king crab legs perfected with the dynamite sauce (kewpie mayo, sriracha, and tobiko). Everything is so cold and fresh! I saw the picked king crab and was pleased we chose the legs. Very satisfying. \n\n* Caviar: loved the American sturgeon platter and all of the bites. Every single one. Seriously. Get the bites. \n\n* Small plates: The \"tater tot\" is like a latke topped with smoked fish & olive tapenade - highly recommend. The crab and lobster cake is good, but not as much of a wow as other items. Still recommend it! The fries are dangerously good - very salty and come with that addictive dynamite sauce. They also come with the lobster roll.\n\n* Toasts: My favorite toast is the mustardy, buttery salmon tartar. Also enjoyed the tuna conserva and rock shrimp toasts. My companions loved the foie gras, if that's your thing. \n\n* Soups: The clam chowder is like liquid velvet - one of the best I've ever had, top 2 or 3 of my life. The rock shrimp bisque is silky, tarragon-y, and my husband's favorite recent discovery. Highly recommend each.\n\n* Salad: The louis is an elegant salad for one, but the only item not optimized for sharing. For sharing, have crab legs from the raw bar or rock shrimp toast instead. \n\n* Crudos: My favorite is the scallop and jalape\u00f1o - such flavors and texture. The hamachi on grilled avocado melts in your mouth, the olive oil and flaky salt finish it expertly. The salmon carpaccio is very good and the favorite item of one of my companions, but the other two are truly divine in my eyes.  \n\n* Large Plates: They will slice the lobster roll for easy sharing for up to four. It's good. Not the best lobster roll I've ever had, but maybe the best currently the city? A good amount of lobster, but not the massive mound one might hope for. I've already mentioned the dangerous fries. The mussels are plump and juicy. I think they are better shared so you can enjoy more items. The beef short rib with bordelaise sauce/potato puree/uni butter - that sauce! the meat you could cut with a spoon! What a fantastic meat dish at a seafood restaurant! I watched someone thoroughly enjoy the salmon, but didn't get a chance to try it yet myself. \n\n* Cocktails/wine: Good enough to come just for drinks. Won't be surprised if it starts making lists for the bar alone. Excellent wine list. Of the cocktails, I found the Island Girl too sweet, but someone who likes sweet happily downed it for me. Other than that, they've been perfect. The Mai Tai has been a favorite with everyone we've brought and comes in a delightful mug. It doesn't get smoother and classier than the Office Supplies. The Mah Jong is great. The Grasshopper has modernized the classic - real mint and no green coloring. My personal favorites have been the Garden Party - so fragrant! - and the ultra refreshing Babarita. \n\n* Dessert: I've been too full to partake, but watched friends enjoy the strawberry sundae once. \n\n* Decor: My house needs to be this exact kitschy, midcentury fantasy. \n\n* Service: Top notch. Couldn't be better. Bravo. \n\n* Con: Very loud. Haven't sat in the walk-in only room in the back where they serve everything except the large plates, yet. It looks lovely and I hold out hope it's quieter.", "author": "Veronica L."}

The shrimp sandwich was so dry and maybe had 1.5 shrimp in it total. A $20 sandwich should be a bit more put together. The lobster roll was just ok. Again $36 for a roll in this town should be darn good. They need to improve the very minimal food options thy have to be AWESOME... really no excuse for that.

The Fancy Oysters are served with pickled tomato and horseradish, so be prepared for a little kick! The Hamachi was cut surprisingly thick and paired very well with the charred avocado.\n\nSea urchin is a huge weakness of mine. You could throw sea urchin on almost anything and I would love it. The sea urchin toast, while small, was very flavorful and light. If you're an uni fiend like me, the Lobster Roll and Braised Short Rib are also served with clarified uni butter.\n\nOur entrees were excellent. I think Leo's Lobster Roll was the best lobster roll I've had in SF. I ordered the Braised Short Rib which was so tender it practically fell off the bone. The pureed potatoes were thick and creamy - such perfect texture! The dollop of uni butter was just the icing on the cake. ;)\n\nIf you have room for dessert, I highly recommend the Blood Orange Creamsicle Float.

I was dining with a friend at the bar and the bartender was initially nice, though obviously making comments about me and friend in Spanish. I am fluent, but I chose to ignore them and chalk it up to sexism and machismo, rather than let it ruin my night. \n\nI later mistakenly asked a server  a question and her reply, not only was completely unintelligent, never answered my question. Maybe all that bleach in her hair has seeped into her brain. She then proceeded to insult me in a back handed way and I chose to ignore the millennial attitude. Children are so rude sometimes. I watched her as she walked up to the bartender and started whispering in his ear and they both looked over. The bartender all of a sudden decides to start mixing and shaking cocktails right in front of us, banging the mixers as loudly as possible, as I sat there talking to my friend. I smiled at him and said \"Wow, you're really working those cocktails.\" At this point we are done with our meal, but finishing our wine and I tell my friend was is transpiring, because she normally does not take note of these things. At this time the bartender comes back to make more cocktails in front of us and she says \"Yeah, that splash was not accidental.\" and laughs. \n\nWe enjoyed our meal and the time we had there, but the service really needs to be looked at. From reading others' reviews, this is not the only instance.

Times like this remind me of how much of San Francisco I have yet to discover despite having lived here for decades and eating my way through the city.\n\nI made 5:30 reservations for happy hour with a girlfriend of mine and ordered one of their fancy (and probably overpriced) but delicious drinks, The Palm Beach while I waited. It was tart but not sugary sweet, and the Basil Hayden balanced it out. It was also a good indication of how the rest of the night would taste.\n\nWe ordered the ...\n\nGarden Party - Super refreshing gin cocktail with a subtle hint of rosemary. Yep, that's happening again.\n\nBarbarita - Quite possibly my second favorite, if not favorite spicy drink ever. The celery threw me off, but everything worked well. Yep, this is happening again. And again. And again. \n\nRoasted Bone Marrow - You know how criminals get a last meal? This would be on there, because it combines 2 of my most favorite delicacies: uni and bone marrow. Normally, I like both of these things as plain as can be, so that I can enjoy the taste, but this worked out perfectly.\n\nFoie Gras Toast - It's a small serving, 4 toast points to be exact. However, the foie gras is so indulgent anymore might be overload. I'm lying, I could've eaten way more but it was a good amount to enjoy. It was like butter!\n\nLobster Roll - The lobster roll ... was a lobster roll. We only ordered it, because it was easiest to share. However, it wasn't anything special. What saved it was the uni butter. \n\nPineapple sundae - Simple, yet surprisingly delicious. The pistachios were a nice touch. \n\nChocolate mousse - These are tiny, but don't order 2. We both figured since it was told to be the most popular item on the menu that we would want our own. Never mind that neither of us were big chocolate mousse fans lol. Just too rich for our taste, but not bad in general.\n\nAll in all, this is my review for my first experience there.

The oyster quality was A+++.  I LOVED the Fancy Oyster, even if the horseradish temporarily blinded me!  I didn't have the Oyster Eloise, but I heard good things.  Their cocktail sauce is amazingly tasty, which is why I had to order a third Shrimp Cocktail.  The bar snacks were fantastic.  The only thing we didn't like were the Cherrystone Clams - they were just so \"fishy.\"  I think that's always a risk with these, but my boyfriend was extra judgmental since he lived in MA for many years and would get them fresh out of the water...\n\nWe had initially planned to get more food from the main menu, but this ended up being quite filling.  After dinner, however, we went and had a drink in the hidden back bar - The Hideaway - where we ended up ordering their AMAZING gravy fries.  They are a must-try.  I look forward to going back in warmer weather once The Hideaway's outdoor patio is open.\n\nOverall, this is a great addition to the area and worth the prices perhaps for special occasions.  I think they'd be well served to add some kind of oyster happy hour, however...", "author": "Tay H."}

Great space, great bar, great design, and it extends to the menus, the typography, great execution overall. Super nice dinner with oysters, beef tartare, trout roe, tuna carpaccio, black cod, and some very nice champagne. It was a special occasion and Leo's more than made the grade. If I had any complaint at all it's simply that dinner was expensive but that's what you get in downtown SF when you order up a big plate of oysters and bubbles, etc. I do think it's excessive for *anyone* to charge $3+ per oyster when I grew up eating them at Tomales Bay Oyster for $0.43 each, but that's not Leo's fault per se, it's SOP anywhere in the City. Shine your shoes and get your roll of clams ready, eat at Leo's! \n\nPS there are two back rooms and a back bar -- would be a great place for an event!", "author": "Bowen D."}

I got half an assortment of half a dozen raw oysters that ranged between $4 and $4.25: Chelsea Gem (WA), Shigoku (WA), Sweetwater (CA), Peter's Point (MA), Ring Point (ME) and St. Simon (NB).   The presentation was quite elegant and all the oysters were perfectly shucked.   I also got a couple of Hot Oysters:  Leo's Deviled Egg & Oyster Carbonara, each for $5.   Finally, I got the Salmon Tartare for $16.   While it was delicious, I didn't feel like I got my money's worth on that last dish in particular.  When I contrast it to the same dish at Bouchon in Yountville, I find that for the same price, you get a much more generous and delectable dish at Thomas Keller's establishment.  I accompanied my lunch with a nice crisp glass of Verdicchio from Italy which I thought paired beautifully with all my dishes.  All in all, a very nice and elegant lunch, but I can't give them 5 stars because I thought my lunch wasn't quite worth the value.   I walked out of Leo's close to $100 poorer and still somewhat hungry.   Would I come back?

From excellent and unique cocktails to succulent oysters to incredible decor -- I was there for dinner about 12 hours ago and already can't wait to go back. The experience wasn't even marred by the fact that the party that had our table before us lingered so long we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated and at a different table. Staff was incredibly apologetic and comp'd us not only glasses of champagne but a delicious starter as well. Always appreciated.\n\nThe food: Our waitress told us her and the chef's favorite is the miso-broiled trout with golden trout roe, and honestly, I probably wouldn't have ordered it if she hadn't said to, but boy am I glad she did. It was cooked to perfection, buttery and luscious. \n\nA close second was the ahi tuna carpaccio, served with a tea leaf salad -- two things you wouldn't think go together but somehow are perfect complements. \n\nWe got a secret menu item, called the \"Marlowe\" fries (an homage to the restaurant group who started Leo's, also owns Marlowe and Park Tavern) with braised short rib, cheese and other goodness heaped on top of a bowl of fries. Kind of like the fanciest best poutine I've ever had. \n\nThe oysters were all incredible. Tried the Garden Party cocktail and loved it.

Banquets on the right are narrow, but fun.  \n\nWe arrived at opening on a Friday afternoon so the full menu was not yet offered.  However, we tried everything from the raw bar and nothing disappointed!  We stayed long enough to try the uni toast, and it was worth it.

My husband and I split every dish and neither of us had a single complaint. We got CA fresh oysters (5 stars) the tuna carpaccio (5 stars), and the mussels andouille (4.5 stars). Even the French fries were on point. For cocktails I got the Garden Party, which was really refreshing, and the Island Time, which looked like it would be really girly (it had cute little pansies floating in it) but was smoky and delicious. My husband got two Mad Mans and they were also very good. Finally, for dessert we had the Pineapple sundae and I think I literally moaned when I took a bite. On top of that the service was top notch. One note: there are a lot of reviews that complain about the price, but first, you get what you pay for. The seafood was incredibly fresh and well worth it.

Being the old Wexler's location that was near and dear to my heart, I wanted to give this place a shot.  Came here around 3pm hungry and desperate for a late lunch with a buddy of mine, noticing that it was a new restaurant to us, we decided to try it and was given a menu by the lovely hostess.  We ordered the Ostera caviar appetizer with cocktails, and was told the kitchen was closed until 5pm.  No worries, having skipped lunch, I figure, hey we'll go to Wayfare tavern next door and come back when your kitchen reopens at 5pm to try that awesome sounding caviar appetizer on the menu that lured us in.  After my late lunch at Wayfare Tavern (fried chicken was ridiculously good), I went back to Leo's next door to be true to my word to the waitress that I would return at 5pm.  Again we were given the same food menu by a different but equally lovely and polite hostess, and again I ordered the same thing that caught my eye on the menu, the Ostera caviar.  Was told the kitchen doesn't open until 5:30pm.  Well we tried, given misinformation about the kitchen opening at 5pm...  Some suggestions, don't give a food menu when the the kitchen is closed.  Caviar... It's from a jar or can.  All someone has to do is open the jar/can and serve on a plate with the mini pancake and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, with minimal preparation.  And although the kitchen was \"closed\", I'm sure someone back there was capable of opening a jar or can of caviar.  As much as I want to rate this place on their food, I sadly never had it.  We tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, came back when told, but no luck.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-20", "description": "Leo's Oyster Bar offers some wonderful seafood dishes, but the cramped space and poor value for money detract from the overall experience. The portions are incredibly small for the price point of each dish. For example, while the lobster bisque is absolutely delicious, a $19 bowl is the equivalent size of a cup of soup elsewhere (albeit served in a bowl). Four tiny bowls for our table, was $76, which is a bit problematic when you consider that you'll need to order a lot more food in order to have a full meal. The sea urchin toast for $18 seems like it would be a fair portion, until you see a plate that consists of 3 very skinny strips of toast with some sea urchin put on top. For those of us who have been in San Francisco for several years, expensive prices are not abnormal.

We will definitely go back- there were lots of other goodies on the menu that we would like to ry. Even though portions for some dishes were small, we were full and too full for dessert- though they looked amazing. And, also, ladies bathroom was spotless and overall noise level very comfortable- you can hear your dining companions without shouting.  In sum, this was a terrific Friday night dinner out.", "author": "Robyn G."}
