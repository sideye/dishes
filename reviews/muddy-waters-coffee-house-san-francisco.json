I read on their bathroom door that you had to be a customer only. So I went to the front to order something, only to find out it's cash only. I rarely carry cash and this was my problem #2 on my quest to find a bathroom.\n\nI turned around to walk away and told my friends how difficult it was to find a bathroom around here. My friend was digging through her purse and found some cash to lend me, I went up again to buy a drink.\n\nThen the staff tells me \"it's ok, I don't need it,\" so I interpret this as him just letting me use the bathroom without buying anything. I was really appreciative that he would be so kind to make an exception for me. So I proceeded to the back to use the bathroom.\n\nThen I hear him yelling at me so I get closer to listen. He says \"i don't want your business!\" I was surprised to encounter someone so ill tempered. \n\nI was polite, offered to pay as soon as I realized I could afford to, and tried my best to follow their policies. People like that should not be in the service industry and definitely not doing any good for the business.", "author": "Sarah P."}

I even had to explain to him what an allergy was and that I would get very sick if I got poppy seeds. He told me that there were no poppy seeds on my bagel but the bagel was filled inside out w them. I took medication that need to be eaten with food and I needed something to eat so now I'm going to be sick for the rest of the day. I wish that I didn't tip and I'm a phenomenal Tipper.

Nowhere in the cafe does it say its hours either, and when we told him we were confused by the time, he just gave us a blank stare and went back to cleaning.\n\nCashier we had tonight had trash service; if it weren't for his facial expression of utter disdain, I probably would've thought he was a mute.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-11-06", "description": "This review is about the INCREDIBLE amount of disability discrimination for wheelchair users this business is guilty of.\n\nFirst let me say that I am a huge supporter of local coffee shops in the Mission.  I have been going here, the Muddys on 24th, Cafe La Boheme, Cafe Tazo, and others for many years.  I have never come across something like this before:\n\nThis place has a huge ledge at the door so wheelchair users cannot get inside.  Why they don't install a *tiny* concrete ramp (which would cost less than $50 and be a tax write-off) is beyond me.  Instead, if you are privy to the inside-scoop, they will bring you a fold out ramp.  Or so I thought.\n\nA couple weeks ago I asked for an employee named Nick to bring me the fold out ramp.  I was astonished when he firmly said \"NO!\"  I use a wheelchair every day for traveling but can walk short distances to the bathroom and such (it is painful to walk because I have nerve damage in my legs).\n\n\"I've seen you walk before!  I'm not getting the ramp.  You can walk in here and leave your wheelchair outside.\"\n\nMy jaw nearly hit the floor.  I asked to talk to his supervisor and so he called her and put her on the phone.  I explained the situation and she seemed slightly bothered (though not outright upset) with what was happening.\n\nNick picked up the ramp and brought it over finally and said \"I'm only doing this because otherwise you will sue us or something stupid like that.\"\n\nI told him he did not know about my condition and that it caused me pain to walk.  I asked him if it caused him pain to bring me the ramp.\n\n\"It causes me mental anguish\" he said.\n\nI called the manager again after this and told her about his behavior.  She said it was a problem and that she would call me tomorrow to talk to me about it.\nWell that was weeks ago.  She never called back and this jerk still works there, so I cannot feel safe and welcome in this space.  \n\nIt's heart breaking to know the management continues to let someone who discriminates against customers with disabilities work here.  They should also just make a permanent ramp so wheelchair using customers actually know they can enter the space.\n\nHere is a picture I took of the entrance:", "author": "Thomas T."}

I typically work from here maybe once a week. The WiFi is strong and stable. The staff is all wonderful (especially Ms. Hoda, but the owner is extremely nice too), the coffee is always perfect and they learned how I liked it by the 3rd time. The music tends towards World music with some jazz thrown in, which is a perfect mix for me (and it's not too loud, like in some coffee shops, so you can here yourself think, or have a conversation). They recently changed the bathroom access, and also put a mirror in there, so it's way more convenient now. \n\nThe only downside at Muddy's is a non-controllable for them...they are in the edgy Mission, so sometimes people wander in who haven't bathed in awhile, or someone will be smoking pot outside the front door, which can waft in (I like to sit in one of the front window tables, so I get the full force of that). There's also a Google bus stop in front, so you get the fumes, noise and the crowded sidewalk, but that's pretty minor and mainly in the morning commute hours. Oh yes, there is free street parking on the adjacent streets, but only for 2 hours, then you have to move your car.\n\nI've met some very interesting people here too (noted authors, creative types, local politicians).

He stood there grimacing until I actually got to the counter. And then, when I was just about to order, he turned his back. And stood there. I don't know--I thought--maybe he's crying?!

Nope. Turns his back and stands there. \"Excuse me.\" Turns around. I say \"Hey, how're you doing?\" Says nothing. Looks at me like I'm the chick who stepped on his ferret sometime back in the '90s. \n\n\"Sigh. What can I get you?\" \"What kind of cakes are those?\" \"Chocolate.\" \"Is it just chocolate?\" \"Yup.\" Turns his back. \"But...there's another kind of cake. What is that.\" \"Uhh.

Then rings it up. \n\n\"That'll be $6.95 \"$7 for one piece of cake?\" \"No,\" he says, \"It's SIX- NINETY-FIVE.\" \"Well, I'm surprised---I've ordered cake here before.

He rushes the line -- wiry hair flying about -- and demands a muffin. The barista chides him: \"I'm trying to talk to someone.\" He's used to The Cafe Artist's antics. This unpretentious barista seemed genuinely concerned for me when he asked me how I was doing. I was about to answer 'good' or even 'great' when The Cafe Artist interrupted us. I wasn't about to complain of the middle class neck pain plaguing me, or my desire to jump off a building -- that would be ridiculous. Complaining of white collar cognitive dissonance and the insidious pains of sitting at a desk when the barista can barely afford to keep himself in shelter with what they must pay him. But he's alive! And possessed of the kind of nutty energy one acquires by daily encounters with chaotic people. This is the place to sit and watch the upper middle class hordes stepping around street people as they devour the Mission. The Cafe Artist must think so, or he wouldn't sit facing it. \n\nHe tells me he's a documentary filmmaker. He's from Columbia. \"The human rights violations in Columbia, that's what I film.\" Does he do commercial stuff? Sure he does. (He's a little vague about this.) We get to talking about Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, whom the Cafe Artist interviewed fifteen years ago. He recounts how M\u00e1rquez struggled making the transition from Aracataca to Bogot\u00e1, how he had to pawn his typewriter, his experience of the coup -- nothing I don't already know from the autobiography.\n\n\"I'm interested in the creative process,\" The Cafe Artist tells me. Most people who talk of the creative process are applying for a grant or just prefer talking to the real thing. Skepticism piqued, I let it pass. By the time we get to Borges we're back on the same page, holding forth with help from enthusiastic hand gestures and big smiles, just like the cafe artists depicted in M\u00e1rquez' autobiography. I tell him I've only read the master's minor works -- namely, Memory of My Melancholy Whores -- as is my habit. Has he read Enrique Vila Matas? Only a little. Our camaraderie shaken, I plod on anyway: \"This crop of Spanish language writers who live in books, who write about writing, who create little Macondos of intertextuality: what's up with that?\" \"I know what you're getting at,\" he assures me. Neither of us invoke Cervantes at this crucial impasse. \n\nJust when it seems I've lost him he returns to Borges, professing his passion for the great ambassador of Hispano-English letters in broken English careening into mellifluous Spanish. I feel like I'm hallucinating, like I can understand everything he's saying despite not speaking Spanish because I know so well what he speaks of, like I'm really in a cafe in Bogot\u00e1 in the '50s, on the brink of anarchy or bloodless revolution. Holy shit, this guy's enthusiastic! And he's not even crazy. (Only crazy people talk to me in San Francisco.) \"You must write every day!\" he implores me. I know, I know, but it's only Wednesday and I'm already burnt out!\n\nA shoeless man weaves through traffic outside. I ask The Cafe Artist for the time. I'm supposed to be meeting my wife for a film. This is a good stopping point. We've spilled our passions, now it's back to pleasantries. The Cafe Artist has shit to do. \"I'm meeting someone, too,\" he says, \"some other guy.\" You can't blame him for thinking people (aside from French and Brazilian tourists) actually sit and converse here -- he's only lived in the city for four months.\n\nAll right, Mr. Cafe Artist.

Nothing feels cleans, it is almost always quite empty, and the food never looks fresh. \n\nThe service is terrible. One Friday a co worker and I went in for a bagel. The service was rude to say the least. The woman serving us had such an attitude. We left and went to another cafe because of this, and because the interior was so dark, dirty, and dreary. \n\nLater that day, I decided to go back to muddy waters because 1) I was having a family emergency and needed an outlet so I could communicate with them. I thought muddy waters would have one available because they are so empty, and I also needed some quiet. 2) Watching  my friend eat her bagel put me in the mood for one. \n\nWhen I returned, I sat down, plugged in my computer and phone (to secure my seat and my outlet), checked my phone for family updates and was about to pull out my wallet and go to the counter. My friend was also meeting me there to grab lunch and coffee for herself, btw. But before I could do anything (I checked my watch: literally 1 minute after arriving to the shop), the woman behind the counter began shouting at me. She remained behind the counter the entire time, yelling across the room. She degraded me, calling ME disrespectful for coming into her store with another stores coffee (there was 1/4 liquid left in my cup) and food (I didn't have any food with me- I assume she thought I had some in a plastic bag I had with me that I had just put something I bought from a store inside). She kicked me out of the coffee shop even after I tried explaining that I was just here an hour ago and was back for more and that someone was meeting me, who I was waiting for. She didn't even give me the chance. I have never felt more embarrassed. \n\nIt is a very common thing in SF to cafe hop and I don't understand why she thought that after being there for only a minute (again, I checked the time), I was simply not going to purchase anything (even though I had purchased something earlier that day??).

After going to all style and no substance coffee shops like craftsmen and wolves and stable cafe I really appreciate a place that makes some great coffee and has some breakfast food. I usually get the iced coffee there, it is delicious. I've also had the white chocolate latte and americano, both really good. They have a great selection of foods, ranging from standard bagels to more exotic treats. The only downside, like many coffee shops in the area, cash only.\n\nThe service is great there, which is what puts this place ahead of so many other. The Mission is full of places with great food & drinks but they come with a mountain of attitude or a 20 minute wait while your baristas talk about how cool they are.", "author": "Raquel L."}

We ordered, paid, sat down, and waited. After thirty minutes, my friend finally decides to walk up to the barista to see where his drink was.  The barista rudely replies that he only had two hands but was going to make it in a moment. (It was very slow at the caf\u00e9, so waiting 30 minutes for a drink was an unreasonable amount of time). The entire time that we were at the caf\u00e9 (from about 15:15 until 16:00) there was a lady (who did not work there but was friends with the barista) standing in front of the register, monitoring the caf\u00e9 and keeping the barista company (which is partly why the barista was distracted and negligent of his job). My friend waits in front of the espresso machine until he gets his drink (a cappuccino without the shot of espresso, so just steamed milk). When he notices that there is no caffeine in his cappuccino, he asks for the barista to prepare him the drink he had ordered, and continues waiting. The barista's friend comes up to my friend and begins confronting him, telling him that he had been rude  to \"her friend\", the barista, and had no right to demand for another drink. The barista does not intervene, but my friend ignores the lady and keeps waiting for the drink. He finally gets the cappuccino (which actually looks good), and sits down to drink it. The lady, in the meantime, reaches over the espresso machine, and grabs the towel that the barista uses to clean the nozzle to steam milk, and she wipes her own elbow with it. UNSANITARY. The lady continues yelling at my friend across the caf\u00e9 and is now looking at each one of us at the table. We are confused and try to ignore the whole situation, but she continues yelling at us even louder and the barista (her friend) just lets her continue. At this point, everyone at the caf\u00e9 has now become involved with the situation and the lady comes over to our table and demands that we \"settle things outside.\" In order to avoid this embarrassing situation from getting more out of control, we walk out and leave the drinks that we had been waiting for unfinished on the table. The lady follows us outside and continues yelling and insulting us. At one point, she walks up to another one of my friends and threatens to physically hurt her. We try talking sense into her and ask her to leave us alone, but she continues following and yelling at us, claiming that we had been rude to her friend and blaming us for San Francisco's decline (irrelevant). She is escorting us to Bart station on 16th and Mission when she makes a call to \"some of her friends\" who are expecting us at the Bart station. She is narrating our every move to her friends over the phone and gives a detailed description of how we look like, and that's when we decided to head back to Valencia street and seek help at the police station. \n\nI do not understand how the man behind the espresso machine ever got a job working here. He was truly inefficient, rude, and provided horrible service. He also should not have his troubled friends hanging out with him and causing trouble with the customers who are the ones paying his check.

FLOORED. \n\nI still use Muddy's coffee as the yardstick by which to measure all others. Brewed fresh frequently, using solid-quality beans, by people who love coffee.  Strong and tasty. And Muddy's is also a yardstick for coffee shops. All kinds of people hang out here, and I mean ALL kinds, including both people who talk to themselves because they're crazy and people who talk to themselves because they're wearing Bluetooth implants. \n\nIt's unpretentious, with good light and multiple tables and chairs that are just the right height for reading and writing. They have all the beverages. They have all the cafe snacks. They have the only yummy vegan cookies in existence. And their flyer wall is a pretty good way to get the Zeitgeist of SF.\n\nAlso, Joel, the angry young man with excellent taste in music who works several nights a week, has worked here longer even than that. He will make you the *BEST* mocha in SF. Hands down. People who don't drink mochas, don't get mochas, and can't make them, so they can be hit or miss in this town. But Joel's mochas (and Americanos) FTW. If he seems grumpy to you, it is because he has to handle the hassle of the madding crowds.\n\nI'm always amused by people who go to the Mission for coffee and say, \"ew, gross, it's got character.\" I suppose that shows my \"age,\" in terms of believing I live in the pre-dot-com Mission instead of the Tablecloth Mission. If you don't want to be hassled by street people on 16th and Valencia, don't hang out on 16th and Valencia. They've been on that corner probably longer than Joel.\n\nRegarding the bathroom, Muddy's has recently installed a brand-new toilet and one of those most excellent high-powered Xcelerator hand dryers, and it's generally cleaner, although as with most coffee shops, YMMV. Your attitude toward bathroom graffiti, I cannot help you with. You are in fact in the Mission.\n\n(My personal coffeeshop checklist. Doesn't really impact the score.)\nOutside seating?

They didn't, but within a few minutes (and without being asked) the staff had taken a spare table, pushed it into the bathroom, and even covered it with a couple of cloth towels.  The owner even came by midway through to check whether we needed anything.  Someone else here was complaining about the graffiti in the bathroom -- I'm hardly a fan of taggers, but babies like bright colors and sharp contrasts, and the graffiti in this one goes all the way to the ceiling, so my daughter was delighted -- she sat there and stared raptly at it through a lengthy diaper change.  At this age she can hardly get through even a quick change without fussing, so I was impressed -- I may have to invite some taggers back to our bathroom at home.\n\nCame out, bought some coffee and smiled wanly at nothing in particular for half an hour while drinking it and feeding the baby.

Welcome to San Francisco! Now please consider moving back to wherever you came from.\n\nMuddy's is solid like a rock. Through all the spasms of gentrification, it has barely changed since I moved in around the corner a decade and a half ago. This gives me comfort.\n\nStaggering home in the morning after my night job in '92, Muddy's was there, Prince Charm the Red Man ranting funny nonsense in the back... In the Mid 90s when I needed to escape my trust-fund bike-messenger roommates, Muddy's was a surrogate living room... Joel, the cool guy at the counter was often kind enough to let me nurse a single cup and read for hours on end while I was unemployed. (And he still works there, for Chrissakes!)\n\nSure, all the pastries are stale, the bagel-toaster takes 45 minutes, people shoot up in the constantly malfunctioning lavatory and newspapers are strewn everywhere. The regular who moos like a cow because of a health condition can be a maddening annoyance, too.\n\nBut this refreshingly perverse atmosphere drives off most of the slick-dressed laptop-toting jackasses that have overrun all the other local cafes, making it a little island of dilapidated calm, a tidepool outside the turbulent ocean of douche that the Mission has become. And the coffee is made from Jehova's own nuclear fuel rods! I love this goddamn place, and I worry for its continued existence in the present social/commercial climate.\n\nSeriously, if you can't deal with a few junkies and crazies at your local independent coffee shop, what are you living in the city for?

I didn't realize what had happened until she was out the door. She had come in earlier to bother some other people at a different table and then she left. The first time I put my phone in my lap. So yes, it was stupid of me to leave my phone on the table the second time she came in while I was reading so I could wait for my friend's call. But then again, who expects to have their shit stolen right in front of them in a coffee shop???\n\nI am giving this place two stars instead of one because the baristas let me use their phones to call the cops. That was quite nice of them. But they also didn't seem too surprised at what had happened, so I bet sketchy/scary people come in off the street a lot and they just can't/don't do anything about it.\n\nI have always come to this place in the past to kill time if I'm waiting for someone. The bathroom has been nasty but the coffee's fine and they have free papers to read and Internet if you need it. I used to think of it as a good evening refuge but now I've changed my mind.

Since they don't take cards, I had to use their in-shop ATM. The barista made the drink and I asked about a pastry in the glass display case. The guy muttered something about coconut, which sounded appetizing. I ordered one and the guy microwaved it back to life. As soon as I bit into it, I realized it was some musty, mold-tasting spinach-n-cheese pastry. I'm pretty accepting of food that's a little passed its prime and I have to say, this was bad enough I actually threw it away. I wish I could say the coffee was the saving grace of the experience, but I couldn't really taste the coffee over the strong taste of plastic, presumably from the cup. After a few sips, I tried dressing it up with some creamer and sugar, neither of which could cover up the potent taste and smell of plastic. As a side note, the drink preparation area consisted of a large pitcher (the kind most restaurants use for iced tea) filled with half and half, a 2-gallonish sized tub labeled \"Brown Sugar\" half empty with a community spoon dropped in it, and a syrup carafe filled with regular sugar. None of the options looked vaguely appealing to me, especially not the brown sugar. \n\nTo top off the experience, four sips into my drink, the barista decided to take a smoke break so he walked to the door of the place and lit up, letting his cigarette smoke meander back into place. After the second sip of plastic coffee + cigarette smoke, I was done. I trashed the drink along with the moldy spinach and bailed. I passed the barista on the way out and he just looked bored.
