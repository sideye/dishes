However, it came out lukewarm and a little soggy. The burger was just okay; the tomato on it was ice cold and felt like it just came out of the fridge, the buns were not toasted, and the juices from the patty soaked through the bottom bun. The pintxos board was good, just overpriced (each toothpick was 2 bucks!) \n\nOverall, on the noisier side so not the ideal spot for conversation.

I haven't even had a chance to try out their food yet but clearly, I'm rating them 5 stars either way! Amazing cocktails and an ambience like whoa?! Um, yes please!\n\nI stopped by here for a quick happy hour before meeting with some friends for dinner. The entrance can be a bit tricky to find since it's located down a street that's practically an alley way. 15 Romolo is a beautiful hotel bar that is located behind the Basque Hotel. The inside is very narrow and dark. The actual bar area is located towards the back of the building while the center acts as more of a dining area. Food is offered here but I didn't get anything this time around since I was having dinner later. \n\nThe ambience is wonderful here and the atmosphere is very low key. The crowd is mixed and the few people that I encountered while I was here were super friendly and chatty! The bartenders were hustling but were still very attentive. When I came in, it wasn't too busy but when I left, it became a packed house. My bartender Elisa was super friendly and whipped up some mean cocktails for me! \n\nSpeaking of cocktails... this place has it made! They have a great happy hour from 5-7:30 that is offered DAILY! Yep! Since I was there during happy hour, why not indulge? I started off with their popular Pimm's Cup cocktail and then later finished with their Pablo Honey cocktail. I love a good Pimm's Cup, so I knew that I would enjoy this one. \n\nI was most impressed with the other cocktail that I had though. The Pablo Honey was a mix of tequila, smoked kiwi cordial, poblano, honey, lime, and citrus salt. And DAAAAAMN was it good! A nice smokey sweetness that played well off of each other. The drinks are decently priced between $10-$13. They also have a good selection of wine and beer. One thing that I found odd was that there were no mirrors in the restroom. I guess they don't want people lingering in there for too long or something.\n\nI would love try their food on my next visit out, but more cocktails are a definite! If you're looking for good drinks and good times in North Beach, 15 Romolo is the spot for it.", "author": "Shayla B."}

Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed if people thought this is the way I would go full-on Dexter because I've watched enough Law & Order SVU to know that the logistics of it is all wrong. Seriously people, watch your dramas.\n\nThe seedy walk up here is worth it, though. The cocktails are well made (especially their Pimms Cup and their whiskey cocktail) and if you're feeling adventurous, talk to your bartender who will make you customized drinks based off your likes/dislikes. Once we said we just wanted something with egg whites + a gin base and the bartender took his time to craft a delicious cocktail that he thought up on the spot. The waiters here are also super friendly and once even comped us glasses of rose because our cocktails were taking longer than expected. \n\nOne thing I still need to try here is their brunch as my eyes always wander to the words \"churro waffle\" on their shared food/drink menu every time I'm looking for a drink. I'd skip the drinks altogether if that dish tastes as magical as it sounds.", "author": "Jay R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-28", "description": "Though it may take some exploration through San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood, 15 Romolo is a worthwhile trip for brunch-fanatics seeking a creatively modern menu with bold flavors and heavy meals. Plus,15 Romolo self-describes their brunch as \"f-ing Narnia\" so you can't really help but be intrigued!\n\nAt least that's how I felt when I was back home looking for a brunch spot. Apparently \"f-ing Narnia\" means combining some hipster-esque elements to create some really interesting drinks and menu items. For instance, though I ordered some wine, I was seriously tempted to order a Sister Christian (bourbon, hot coffee, ancho chile, cardamom, honey, mandarin cream). \n\nI ended up ordering their take chicken and waffles (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/15-romolo-san-francisco?select=qEb14Mv6lUQ9kOFfRA4zrQ). This item consisted of Spanish fried chicken, churro waffle, jamon butter, sunny side up egg, maple syrup, salad. The chicken had a nice crispy coating and I liked the spices they used. Churro waffle was a game changer for me too. But Jesus...everything on that plate was heavy. Even the goddamn salad! Don't even get me started on that jamon butter. It was porky and flavorful and I certainly liked it but I could not bring myself to even finish half.  \n\nMy dining companion ordered the confit pork belly with sunny side up egg, roasted butternut squash, apple-marcona chutney, and pork jus. Thankfully, she let me have a few bites! The pork belly was super soft and I appreciate that the skin was crispy. There was this dark green substance on the plate that didn't look too appetizing. Turned out to be the chutney. Didn't taste bad. \n\nAlso, 15 Romolo is nice enough to provide complimentary waffle shots before your brunch (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/15-romolo-san-francisco?select=ImY8JZ--5B3PgDHL1u17pA)! These are little shot-sized pitchers containing some blackstrap rum, espresso liqueur, maple syrup, and waffle piece. To our surprise, it was more bitter than sweet. \n\nDinning here was certainly an experience for the both of us. It seemed like every time we tried a new component of our plates we just had to stop and and think \"that's different\" or \"that's new.\" Their creativity is certainly evident. I feel like it is the reason why 15 Romolo earned 4 stars from me, but also the reason why I withheld that last star. My dining companion and I felt that while most of the items were pretty good, others fell flat. The interesting flavor combinations really challenged our palates and made us contemplate our food a bit more than usual, but we weren't convinced that a couple of these items actually worked out. We could see ourselves coming back, but neither of us could become regulars.", "author": "John B."}

We were both super hungry so we ate them and then left as quickly as possible because a group of people behind us were basically shrieking at each other. \n\nThis place has clearly implemented some cost-cutting in the last year - there's no hostess anymore and people are free to take up tables for hours and scream at the top of their lungs at each other.

I heard it's bomb.com \n\nAs for the food. My girls and I met up here for sunday brunch and there was ample seating. Being that i've never been here before, it was a tad bit hard to find. 15 Romolo is located in an unassuming alley way off broad up a steep hill. There brunch menu is short and sweet and I honestly have to admit that the food was great. They also serve your meal with a cute little shot of waffle syrup/alcohol mix. Very nice touch. \n\nI ended up ordering the pork belly and was definitely not disappointed by how soft, tender, moist the pork belly was. It literally melted in my mouth and I can't speak enough about how awesome that was. My girls ordered the burger and the break special..all of which looked delicious and their hash brown squares were a winner. \n\nSo with all the good remarks about the taste of the food, why 3 stars and not 4? Well...service was definitely one of them. I hate writing reviews based off of the service but dude, our waiter was on another level that day. Totally not attentive, very slow, and had a hard time understanding our requested and providing an explanation of the questions we had. Furthermore, it's weird, IMO, that on the check, each item already has the taxes added on so it looks like they're charging you more for the food. So instead of going by the price that is listed on the menu, your receipt will show your item, with the tax included. I mean yes, that is easier for you to calculate if you're splitting, but without explanation of this, it looks like they're randomly charging you more. Whomp whomp.\n\nSo..i will come back for the food, but it wouldn't be my go-to brunch places. It's a tad pricier than some of the other joints around SF..but then again, SF is just getting pricier and pricier so maybe i won't complain.", "author": "Diane T."}

Definitely something that is pretty good because you can either have a nice brunch with friends or get totally fucked up if you really wanted to. I went with a coworker last month since we were planning to get brunch for the longest time, but never really planned anything until that week. This spot is a hidden gem, meaning that the door to this place is something that you would pretty much walk by and not realize that it's the place you're looking for (trust me,I walked by this place and didn't realize that I found it).\n\nThis place has a short brunch menu with items that they tend to switch out pretty often, so when we went, my coworker and I got the pear crepes with a side of hashbrowns and the chicken and waffles, as well as the April in Paris drink.\n\nTo be completely honest, I got tired of my pear crepes really fast. They didn't really taste like crepes either, they had more of a texture like pancakes but they were crispy, yet soggy from the whipped cream they had. The hash browns I had were HUGE, but they over peppered my hashbrowns,so it wasn't really that pleasant to eat. The hash browns themselves were big cubes of potatoes and I was SHOOK. My coworker really enjoyed her chicken and waffles though, but they over peppered her hash browns too, so it was hard for her to even eat them as well.\n\nNOW ABOUT THE APRIL IN PARIS DRINK; I was expecting a light, citrusy drink with maybe a light taste of the alcohol, but I was totally wrong. It tasted straight up like tequila in my mouth, so I had to wait for it to water down a bit.\n\nI'm giving it four stars because the service was great and our server actually gave us a little waffle shot. The only thing I didn't like about the shot was the strong flavor of ginger or clove in the drink. Also, this place wasn't busy when we went, so it was pretty peaceful and we were seated immediately.

Good deal if you can make HH.\n\nThe bar food menu items are pretty good and you will find something you'd enjoy. I've brunched here and true, it's one of the best anywhere every time. I've seen a large group doing their birthday brunch here, it's that good. If not out of the way I'd brunch here more often - delicious and good portion size, hence, the final star.", "author": "Peter L."}

While the food was decent, not sure I'd really say it is objectively THAT good.\n\nI was a initially apprehensive about going to a bar for lunch, but 15 Romolo does have a pretty solid brunch menu. The place is pretty much lit by natural light and actually wasn't as grim as I though it might be given its night time shenanigans. Pretty clean too. \n\nMy friend and I both got the pork belly with eggs. They also served a complimentary waffle shot to everyone in the restaurant. Nice gesture, and it was literally a waffle shot. It was a rum based syrup but I more or less felt like I was dipping waffle into some rum. Anyways, the pork belly and eggs was okay, but nothing to write home about. The biggest problem is the dish was insanely oily -- it was literally just drenched in oil --the eggs, the pork belly, the veggies that came with it. I almost wanted some bread or something to soak up the eggs a little bit. The pork belly was okay, tender at some parts but really hard in other parts. Not sure about the flavor of the egg either -- it tasted like over easy eggs. \n\nOverall, I feel like 15 Romolo could be a better place to go if you want a very very boozy lunch. We noticed that the waitress asked us multiple times if we wanted a cocktail, and the cocktail options did look really good. The food itself is super oily and I could see it being more appealing if I was trying to get drunk and really wanted to stuff myself. I think it holds promise as a bar or happy hour place, but definitely would not recommend it for lunch. It's okay, but given the price (about $20 after tip per person), I'd rather go elsewhere for brunch.\n\ntldr; interesting drinks, okay food -- would recommend for happy hour or a night out, but def not for brunch.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Which is fine but a tad disappointing. Also the sangria was really good! However I'm thinking there isn't much alcohol in it cus I killed nearly the whole thing by myself and was just barely tipsy and didn't have an ounce of a hangover the next morning... I legit went on a 6 mile run. So not worth $45 for a pitcher that's not even going to get you buzzed. Also it was WAAAAY too loud in there. If I'm going to a club I like the music way up.

I've come here for drinks before (slightly pricey but delicious if you're into fancy cocktails), but today was the first time I went to the brunch at 15 Romolo. I got here around 1 with a friend, and it wasn't too crowded at all! We were seated really quickly, and, after ordering, our meal started off with a complimentary waffle shot. They bring you a tiny little pitcher shot glass filled with a coffee liquor and maple syrup mix, and a waffle bite perched inside.\n\nThe waffle was a little hard (I imagine they make them before hand or even just buy them somewhere), and the shot was pretty strong! I ordered the Market Omelette which was filled with goat cheese, fresh chives, and topped with chimichurri. It came with these hash brown \"cubes\" and a mixed greens salad. The serving size wasn't too big, but for a $12 meal I felt pretty satisfied at the end of the meal!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-11-08", "description": "Space: I came here with a large group of 12 people for my friend's birthday brunch. The restaurant itself was spacious, and had plenty of seating for my huge group when we arrived at 1:15 PM as there was only a couple and a small group eating when we arrive (for better or for worse). The restaurant had a full bar and I felt that maybe this place was intended for so for that than for brunch. \n\nAtmosphere: The day was warm and the restaurant had opened all of their windows which in theory was a nice idea. These windows also provided the majority of the restaurant's lighting which was unfortunate as we sat more so on the other side of the restaurant and the lighting was just okay. The prevailing background noise were from the street--I think at one point a truck was marking a loud, sharp wail. Personally I am not the biggest fan of dark, loud restaurants, especially with a large group, and 15 Romolo had mediocre lighting and my group had to shout to communicate despite the small amount of people actually eating. Overall not my favorite, but the seats were comfy and my group was still able to have a great time.\n\nService: The service was very slow, despite there being only 2 other groups to serve at most. They informed us after we ordered that they only had 8 pans and that the food would be slow. Truthfully, we waited probably 20-30 minutes for exactly 8 of our meals to be served and, I'm assuming, for them to start cooking the rest of our food too. My friend group always ideally waits for everyone's food to be served before we start eating, and this aspect of our experience was particularly annoying. I would finish my meal before the last plate was served.\n\nFood: I ordered the chicken and waffles ($15), and my boyfriend got the brunch burger. The price was fair and the chicken and waffles sounded so promising: \"churro waffle with egg, fried chicken, jamon butter, and small salad\" (more or less). \n\nExcitingly, they gave us all complimentary waffle shots with coffee/syrup liquor. These were really cute, though the waffle in the shot glass was more for decoration as it was too soggy to eat.\n\nI was disappointed to receive a super small portion size of chicken and waffles. I normally have trouble finishing average restaurant portions by myself (I usually bring home leftovers), but any other time I have eaten \"chicken and waffles,\" a single plate has been able to feed two of me. This meal was small--half the size of your average waffle with 2 shapeless pieces of chicken. I was barely full after this meal, though the egg was a nice touch of brunch. \n\nThe first bite was good (that or I was ravenous by 2 PM)--the chicken was crispy (though a little burnt), and the waffle was fluffy. As stated above, half my group had not received their food yet. I ate slowly, and the waffle soon was less so fluffy and more so soggy. I'm actually not sure why it even was getting soggy as I didn't pour syrup over it (I like to dip the waffle into the syrup instead).  After a few more bites, it was then hard to ignore that this meal was ridiculously SALTY. I drank at least 3 cups of water during the meal because all of the food--even the salad!--was extremely salty.\n \nI also tried my boyfriend's breakfast burger, which included an egg among other \"brunch-y\" things in it. In my opinion, the burger was pretty good--the patty itself was juicy and well seasoned. My boyfriend agreed at first, though noted that after several more bites, it was very salty. He also said that the patty was very small and he was barely full afterwards. Luckily, we both thoroughly enjoyed the cubed hash browns that came with the burger. Several of my friends also noted that their meals were very salty. \n\nOverall: I left unsatisfied with no intentions to return.", "author": "Vivian L."}

I've only had this kind of orgasmic octopus twice, here at 15 Romolo and previously at 25 Lusk in a fancy $100 5-course meal. I really liked the kick of spicy paprika and chili oil here. Just not sure about presentation because it comes out looking like a confused salad with its flurry of assorted leaves, though the grilled lemon is a nice aesthetic touch.\n\nPreserved Lemon & Arbol Chili Chicken ($18) half braised local organic chicken, roasted black garlic, tarragon, fresh peas || Wow, fresh peas. I don't remember the last time I had peas at a restaurant that were fresh and not frozen. You could taste the freshness; it's nuttier, kind of like arugula. Funny that I should begin the review of the entree with the peas, but it was memorable!

Seriously though, 15 Romolo's drinks are among the best I've had in SF. We got the American '76 (100pf rye whiskey, clear creek apple brandy, red ale, lemon, grapefruit, honey, bitters) and Diamond in the Rough (bisongrass vodka, iris liqueur, carrot-thyme cordial, lemon, absinthe): both were complex, creative, and generous on the ethanol dose.\n\nThe ambiance is neat and has character, though as Yelpers mention, it does get quite loud on Fridays.

I was impressed by this cocktail. It hit all the flavor notes of a sherry and still highlighted the others well. \n+ House Sherry - I can't remember which sherry they were pouring this day, but I think it was a  Manzanilla that was quite delicious (not too dry, not too sweet... \"just right\" as the bears may say) \n\nOverall it was a spot I enjoyed.

Really, I thought I saw some great mustaches on my trip to SF but nothing compared to the in-grown accessories the fine men in this place were sporting.\n\nI tried the Brazilian (cachaca, velvet falernum, mandarine napoleon and lime) and the Darjeeling Ltd (gin, tumeric, earl grey, gum syrup, lime and black pepper). Both were potently, well-made but the Darjeeling Ltd blew me away. The addition of the black pepper and tumeric was a wonderful tastebud pick-me-up...and I'm pretty sure had some great anti-oxidant and natural calming properties as well (at least that's what Dr. Oz says). Let's just say tea time will never be the same for me again, unless gin is involved.\n\nI had stuffed myself silly at the Ferry Building Farmer's Market, earlier that morning and had promised myself that I would never eat again, but the draw of poutine on the menu was just too great.

And if food is underrated, then brunch at 15 Romolo is the most underrated meal here but that needs to change. This is brunch done right. \n\nLet's start with waffle shots. It's 15 Romolo's amuse bouche for boozy brunch and boozy it is. Bite sized waffle sprinkled with powdered sugar dunked into a bourbon/rum and coffee liquer shot. Now I'm ready for brunch. But wait let's order a Bloody Mary first. By far one of the spiciest Bloodys in the city but it's mighty tasty. If spicy is not your thing, then the Beetlejuice is a nice gin and beet alternative. or just get a glass of punch because as it says on the menu, \"without a drink in hand, brunch is just breakfast.\"\n\nMenu changes somewhat often which is great for variety but sad to see old favorites like the fried chicken biscuit go away. It's almost like the dinner version but throw in some egg, bacon, and hashbrowns. Yum! But my new favorite brunch item on the current brunch menu is the country fried steak. Tenderized beef breaded, fried, then smothered in gravy accompanied by some over easy eggs and hashbrowns plus some salad for balance. So satisfying for brunch. \n\nI love boozy brunch at 15 Romolo.

I had arrived a while later than my friends who'd already placed their order; it took a good 15 minutes or so before I had to finally wave to catch his attention.\n\nFirst up were the waffle-shots. A really neat concept and pretty well executed --- tiny shot glasses with a piece of waffle in a half-ounce pour of bourbon; someone mentioned it's bourbon-maple syrup but I don't know! I had my waffle in two bites, dipping it in the shot for my second bite and chugged the drink down. It was a novelty item, and fun!\n\nAfter vacillating between the basque style baked eggs and the duck confit hash, the duck came out on top (thus, probably, answering the age-old question of whether the chicken or the egg came first --- it turns out the duck came first!). \n\nThe hash was described as a dish of duck confit with crispy potatoes, scallions, prosciutto, and a poached egg. I must say they seem to have a *very* loose interpretation of the word 'crispy'; the potatoes were roughly mashed, served on a greased hot cast-iron skillet with the duck confit and a poached egg to top it off. Let me start by saying that it was pretty decent. But it was disappointing when you consider that almost every component of this dish were items that are delicacies in their own right. The duck confit felt like pulled poultry instead of duck that had been slowly braised in it's own fat over many hours. The prosciutto --- I didn't even realise there was prosciutto in it till I got home and looked at the menu to see what it was composed of. So much for that! And lastly, the poached egg was overdone, the yolk was somewhat soft --- and that's the best I can say about it.\n\nSo there you have it --- it was the dining version of a dream-team with star players that failed to live up to expectations, and performed like a second-division/minor-league team.\n\nPro-tip: Order the hash browns; or a dish that comes with hash browns. They looked delicious and everyone at the table that had it said it was really good. I should have had that!\n\nThe sangria however was pretty good! I am not much of an alcohol aficionado so that's the best I can do when describing the libation dimension of the food-chain parallel universes.\n\nEpilogue: I should have got the Basque style baked eggs instead. One of our dining companions got it and it looked absolutely fantastic! The eggs always looks better on the other plate!", "author": "Umesh T."}

We had Paella in Spain, Argentina and Portugal etc.etc... So i think we know Paella somewhat... Theirs was  very greasy more like Mexican food and i don't think, actuallyi know, they did not use Saffron....But the wine was good and from Spain...\nAlso they did not have any Ricard or Pernod....Hummmm", "author": "Peter N."}

The What Ales You (Rum, Ginger, Pommes, Lemon and a Belgian Ale) was really unique. I've tried cocktails combined with beer before, but this one was especially good. \n\nThe best part about the place was how there was plenty of room, still had a large number of people and wasn't difficult to get a drink.

The food here isn't your typical bar food but a bit fancier and yummier! It's hidden in an alley in North Beach and it might be hard to find if you don't know to look for the sign for the Basque Hotel which is right next to it. Inside it's super dark and kinda looks like a hipster's dream bar. There isn't a lot of seating so if you are coming for food and want a table, prepare to wait.  My friends and I got pretty lucky and got two tables for six of us to squeeze in. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes to share:\n\nPork Tenderloin - My favorite dish of the night! I loved the flavor of the pork belly and how it was cooked. The dish was also presented very nicely!\n\nCheeseburger w/ Peanut Butter & Bacon - Sounds weird but it was SO good. Definitely my second favorite dish of the night. \n\nRoasted Bone Marrow - This dish wasn't worth getting. There was barely any bone marrow to eat so we were mostly eating the dungeness crab on top.\n\nGrilled Shrimp Flatbread - I really liked the flavor of this flatbread, it was a very strong taste. \n\nSteamed Manila Clams - Pretty good dish! There were lots of clams and the spicy sausages inside added a lot of flavor. The soup was also delicious and I wish we had more bread to dip into it!\n\nRomolo Poutine - Delicious! I love fries so it's hard for them to go wrong with this dish. \n\nWe also ordered a few drinks, the Pimm's cup and some beer. The. Pimm's cup was delicious! Too delicious so it wasn't very strong. I would definitely get it if you want a light drink :)\n\nThe only issue we had with the place was how loud it was. We came here too late for dinner ( around 7:30pm ) so it was super loud and we could barely hear each other and talk. So if you come here for dinner, I suggest coming earlier to avoid the loudness of the bar. If you're coming just to drink, the noise is probably fine. Overall, the food and drinks here are great and it is definitely a cool place to hang out with friends.", "author": "Sandra N."}

When I paid you a visit back in March of this year you teased me with you hard to find entrance way (seriously walked past it half a dozen times... intoxication is not the best friend of effective seek and find), and plied me with delicious crafty cocktails with unique ingredient mixes that tickled my taste-buds in magnificent ways.\n\n15 Romolo (also the address) is a swanky, hidden prohibition style cocktail lounge in the heart of downtown SF. It's dimly lit, with musical stylings ranging from slow and sultry to upbeat and contemporary. No matter the mix, it was a great time both times I went, and I'm looking forward to sharing drinks with friends and colleagues alike when I return in a few short months.\n\nPro-tip: If insanely busy, order a beer and a cocktail. The beer will be served up right away while the bar-chefs are overrun and cocktail requests can take upwards of 20-30 minutes at times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-16", "description": "My gf and I were excited to have brunch here last Saturday. The reason? I've had awesome late evening experiences at 15 Romolo (15R) when they're stirring, shaking and pouring excellent handcrafted cocktails. I thought their awesome ability to get me buzzed would translate to success in the kitchen... I was dead wrong. \n\nBISCUIT w/ FENNEL SAUSAGE GRAVY ~ $7.00 ~ 1 star: By far, without a doubt, hands down the worst rendition of biscuits and gravy I've ever had. It was pretty bizarre. I honestly think (I'll sound like a broken record throughout this review by saying this) 15 Romolo has yet to discover salt! Talk about being under seasoned... If I had to guess I'd say 15R incorporated white wine or some kind of alcohol in their gravy. I say this because they didn't cook it down enough and the awful halfway reduced wine flavor was very prominent. The gravy completely lacked seasoning. The sausage bits? Even worse. No taste, just fillers. \n\nPORK CARNITAS FLAT BREAD ~ $14.00 ~ 1 star: They forgot the arugula... Like seriously, who was working the pass??? How does the expediter overlook 1 of 5 components of this dish? Oh... they forgot the salt again! Totally under seasoned. What made it worse? The carnitas were dry... Should have called it Pork Jerky Flat Bread. \n\nPUNCH DRUNK BRUNCH BURGER ~ $10.00 ~ 3.5 stars: Nice burger. The homemade bacon was delicious but they only gave me one slice, which I thought was weird. There's no way one strip of bacon is enough for a burger. However, when I did get bacon in a bite, it went well with the fried egg, cheddar and tomatoes. The sauce they used was pretty good - bold flavor. However, the bun didn't hold up well and the patty was, you guessed it, under seasoned! \n\nWe also ordered their Bloody Mary and some kind of cocktail made with beet juice. Neither blew me away, which really surprised me because their evening cocktails are pretty legit. \n\nMy gf didn't even eat a third of her flat bread and asked what was wrong. After explaining how bad it was (we were't jerks about it), she kindly took it off our tab. Good move on their part. I also like how she didn't make us feel uncomfortable about it like other places have when we've been underwhelmed by a dish. \n\nThe reason I was able to eat as much as I did was because of the salt shaker on our table. I put salt on EVERYTHING. Without it the food was borderline inedible. \n\nToo bad... Underwhelming... UNDER seasoned... Disappointing. That's how I sum up dining at 15 Romolo.", "author": "Bruce C."}

First of all, I have a lot less energy than I used to and I realistically can't make it through two bars in a row, max. Secondly, a phrase such as 'going out in North Beach' implies a certain kind of sh#&%show that I don't have the patience for anymore. Rather, I'm much more a fan of visiting individual places for drinks that I love and where I can see myself staying for a while. 15 Romolo is definitely one of those places! \n\nI led some out of towners to this bar on a Sunday night and I think for a moment they thought I was having them murdered for body parts on the black market, so hesitant were they to venture into the dark and shady alley in North Beach. Once inside though, I knew they would thank me! \n\nThough it can get pretty crowded by the bar, there's actually a lot of space to wander and sit and stand and chat otherwise. On a recommendation I had a cocktail that I'm having trouble remembering now, especially because it's not on the sample menu currently on the bar's website (they're featuring their Christmas menu, so maybe they should get that updated!).. but I do remember it was a fruity mix of vodka and beer and something fruity? It may have had the word 'hay' in the name? It was a girly drink to be sure, but so delicious that all of my male compatriots couldn't help but order one for themselves. The drinks aren't cheap, but they're not cheaply made either, so just know you're in for a crafty kind of place.\n\nIt was a great night, perfect for our large group to catch up and relax on an off-night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-23", "description": "SHHHHHH! This is one of San Francisco's BEST kept secrets...\n\nHidden near the seedy XXX clubs, Roaring 20s and Hungry I and up an alley with a Chinese Community themed mural lies a diamond in the rough called 15 Romolo. From the outside, it looks like a shady back alley bar. However, if you can look past the sketchiness, you will find unique handcrafted cocktails that will give tickle your palate and gastronomic comfort fare that will satiate your inner fatassery cravings.\n\nLast night, 3.22.11, my friend and I stopped by for an HH \"De-Stress\" Session because there's nothing like working hard and playing even harder, a mantra I live by everyday.\n\nSimilar to a western saloon, 15 Romolo is dark, rustic and unpretentious. The friendly and down-to-earth staff gives 15 Romolo a warm neighborhood feel while the Hipster crowd and 90s Hip Hop, R&B and Light Rock Music gives it that modern touch.\n\nI'm more of the \"Shots, Shots, Shots\" type of girl, but while looking over the cocktail list my eyes fixated on the Track 42 (Manuka Honey Vodka, Unfiltered Apple Juice, Lemon topped with Egg White) - $10. DELICIOUS! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=Tku3G5_QfB7VLl4Ib28ZAQ \n\nAlthough stiff, the Track 42 was seamlessly smooth, fresh, fruity and sweet with a punch of tartness from the lemon. The frothy egg white was the icing on the cake adding a light and airy creaminess. It was so good, I had to stop myself after the third one...after all it was only a Tuesday.\n\nAside from 15 Romolo's hand crafted cocktails, they offer mouth-watering fare. We ordered the following:\n\n*TEMPURA FRIED AVOCADO w/ Kewpie Mayo & Togarashi ($5):  DELECTABLE! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=FYWFFsM8OIQtHUbYI5yOVA\n\nThe huge spears of ripen avocado were tempura battered and fried to a light golden brown. The light and airy crust was the perfect texture contrast to the soft buttery avocados. The kewpie mayo was thick and creamy with a slight kick from the togarashi, although it would have benefited from a touch of citrus to help balance the richness.\n\n*CHICKEN WINGS \"BORICUAS\" w/ Chili Sauce, Coconut Cream, Lime & Cilantro ($8): MOUTH-WATERING!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=uwvO0SfiIVicHx5LSas3Tg\n\nThe GINORMOUS wings were fried to a deep golden brown. Wonderfully crisp (not greasy), the wings were succulent and tender. The combo of chili, coconut, lime and cilantro gave it an exotic Thai influence with savory, creamy, sweet, spicy, tangy, and earthy elements. \n\n*YO-MAMA STYLE BURGER w/ Peanut Butter & Applewood Smoked Bacon ($9): SINFULLY GOOD!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=0i-OaUD5Pjj_YKeQukdX1w\n\nNestled inside the soft toasted bun was a moist and juicy beef patty that was generously slathered with creamy peanut butter and crowned with two thick slices of crisp bacon. Initially, the peanut butter may sound like an odd accoutrement, but it works surprisingly well with the burger. The burger was already rich and beefy with a prominent smokiness from the bacon, but the layer of gooey peanut butter gave it a nutty decadence with a hint of sweetness that set it off the charts!\n\nWith my tummy or shall I say, gut full and my mouth full of giggles, our HH \"De-Stress\" Session was COMPLETE!\n\nI was born and raised in San Francisco and it's hidden gems like 15 Romolo that makes me feel like I'm still a tourist (minus the fanny pack) in this city. Most importantly, it's one of many the reasons WHY my heart will always be in San Francisco...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Just what kind of birthday party were we going to?!? I wondered...\n\nWhile 15 Romolo is located in the heart of North Beach's \"exotic\" district it's anything but tacky, but most definitely sexy. Tucked down a little alley, and masked by a sign for the Basque Hotel, it feels like a darker, more spacious, secret sister to Comstock Saloon. There's a big communal bar in the middle, with little cafe tables throughout. They've mastered that dark wood + vintage lighting combo, giving it that old timey feel that hipsters go nuts for. You'll feel like a real SF insider drankin' here. \n\nWe came late on Sunday night and they were featuring a Beer Week inspired cocktail menu - the perfect his & her's compromise. I ordered the \"Hayride\" or something like that, and it was in-cred-ible! Fizzy like a beer, coconutty like a pina colada, and zippy like a gimlet. And best of all, it was served in a tall glass (I can't stand dainty cocktail sippy cups). Very impressive. \n\nGet this: they also have FOOD! Fancy food that you'd find in a basque tapas joint, like charcuterie platters, albondigas (meatballs), and grilled cheese and coppa sammies.

But if you find yourself in the neon paradise that is (what I assume is) San Fran's stripper district, you're in the right place. And don't worry, once inside all of those feelings of skank go washing away.\n\nLately I've been committed to drinking like a grown-up, and have a predisposition for scotch and whiskey drinks. I like boozy drinks that I can sip slowly, and 15 Romolo accommodates wonderfully. Not only do they have an incredibly thoughtful cocktail list, but also a huge representation of spirits. While I spent the first part of my most recent evening I enjoyed a whiskey drink that had some sort of cowboy name. When it got busy, I just segwayed into neat scotch. Perfect.\n\nSpeaking of getting busy, I feel so bad! We completely overtook that bar. On a Sunday night suddenly the place had like 50 people in there. The bartenders were totally overwhelmed but still handled everything with patience and professionalism.

The ambience is dark, moody, quiet and ultra hip. Plus, it is located in an alleyway next to a hotel. You will definitely feel like you've walked into a speakeasy. Having gone late at night around midnight or so after the Bastille concert, there was plenty of seating and the space was drafty and airy, as opposed to crowded and hot like I expected. I assume the place is more crowded earlier in the night. But it was also a Monday lol. \n\nAnyway, we were ravenous for something to eat and 15 romolo obliged. The menu is interesting; limited with mainly burgers, sammies and sliders and with combo deals, such as soup with any choice of sandwich, or appetizer with any choice of burger or slider. I went with the latter. \n\nI had fried hush puppies for my app (meh, it was alright) and pork sliders for my main. The sliders were yummy and the waiter said I could have two since they were quite small. Food is clearly not their strong suit, the drinks are (according to the company I was with) but I didn't have anything to drink so I can't vouch for that. \n\nTheir jukebox is also surprisingly well-stocked, with plenty of non-mainstream songs to keep my hipster audiophile friend happy, so extra points for that!\n\nIn the end, this is a bar like any other except the food is a little better. There is so much potential in their food to be beyond just bar food, I can almost taste the breakthrough; I just think running the bar is their main priority. \n\nI would come back again if I happen to be in the area.

I hear the recipe changes a bit each time so you'll always have a nice little surprise.\n\nThe Drinks: I had the \"Beetlejuice,\" which is a spin off a bloody using beet juice and gin. The beet juice is a clever move, it cuts down on the acidity of the tomato juice while adding an earthy sweetness to the whole drink. Mix in the creme fraiche after taking a few sips and the richness adds yet another dimension to this already unique drink.\n\nThe Food: Ah, the fried chicken sandwich, a prime example of how the sum of something can be greater than its parts. Though each individual component may not have been executed to perfection (i.e., the bacon was a little overdone), the end product was everything I could've asked for in a brunch: crumbly flaky biscuits with crisp fried chicken, a kick of jalapeno, and a gooey over-easy egg yolk running all over everything...mmm!!! The hash deserves a special shout-out too; it's crunchy-crisp on the outside and steaming hot and bursting with chive flavor on the inside - this is how potatoes were meant to be eaten. The portion was large and very filling. I shamelessly admit that I ate the whole thing. Happily.\n\nAt $10 for the fried chicken sando 15 Romolo's prices are totally reasonable for brunch (and a whole lot more satisfying than your standard pancakes and sausage). When brunch was over, I was a little sad to step out into the real world of North Beach again...I'll be sure to return to this little nook and experience that scrumptious brunch again!", "author": "Clarice W."}

Tasty, strong, and affordable.\n\nFor food, if you're into fallafels, definitely check out their bunny burger.

I had never heard of Romolo street, so naturally I used my smartphone's mapping program to guide me there, and experienced some confusion when it appeared to be sending me down an alleyway behind a strip club, but after walking to the alleged location I noted there was in fact a bar there.\n\nIt was a totally unexpected decor, dark and cozy with lots of wood, a jukebox and an old fashioned photo booth. It was doing a  pleasant but not annoyingly busy amount of business for a Monday night and we easily got a table near the window.\n\nWe started with some Pimm's cup cocktails, which honestly were delicious and well mixed. We followed those up with a Fris\u00e9e Salad with Lardons and Poached Eggs and some house made pork shoulder pate. Those were both delicious, and we decided to get some of the deep fried bone marrow, which was like eating deep fried butter (delicious and impressive). Finally we eat had a pork slider which were great, and shared a bread pudding.\n\nOur waiter was fun, talkative, made some great suggestions and even gave us a free round of Fernet Branca shots.

I returned last Sunday and was originally going to -1 star in my update.  So what made me +1 star instead?\n\nMy party arrived at 12:45pm.  We ordered our food and waited...and waited...and waited.  We saw another large group come and go.  We saw the group next to us get seated after us yet they received their food first.  After 45 min of waiting I asked where our food was, clearly displeased.  My previous experience at 15 Romolo was good, so why was it such a disaster this time?!  My poor out-of-town guests were starving!  So finally our orders were fired and arrived 10-15 min later, along with a surprise.  Our server apologized profusely for the long wait and said they would comp our entire meal, drinks and all!  He said they really do want us to return since they haven't been in the brunch business for very long and really want to make a good impression to survive in the established North Beach neighborhood.  I was expecting a discount, but this was far beyond my expectations!  But you know what?  It worked, since here I am giving them a 5-star review and already making plans to return.\n\nNow finally on to the food: I've realized that even though all of their food items are ~$8-9, the portion size varies tremendously.  If you want the most bang for your buck, go with the crispy chicken biscuit sando, burger, or chilaquiles.  The hash portion is smallest so if you're a dude it's really only half a meal.  I personally love the chicken biscuit sando!   The brunch drinks tend to be on the light side -- call me an alcoholic, but I prefer them boozier even at noon.

I'm so glad they did!\n\nWe finally figured out the right spot (up the alley under a small sign) and were pleasantly surprised to see this place is nothing like the businesses it shares the block with.  15 Romolo is a dimly lit bar going for that 'speakeasy' feel, complete with bartenders in suspenders and tweed hats.  It was a very fun vibe and had all sorts of people popping in and out throughout the night. \n\nWe settled down at a table and wound up waiting for a solid 25 minutes just to get drinks. The bar area was buzzing, and I think drink orders taken at the bar itself get priority.  Pick up a drink there before heading to your seat if you're wanting food.  The drinks themselves were well worth the wait however and the 'bar food' was delectable!\n\nWe ordered the bone marrow and duck poutine and quenched our thirst with an Off the Clock and a Suckerpunch.  Both drinks were wonderfully concocted with (for me) just the right amount of alcohol and lots of depth of flavor.  My boyfriend thought they were a bit light, but we both enjoyed them overall.

We had the yelp drink specials and they were quite good. The bartender definitely takes time with each concoction and takes pride in his word. I highly recommend the seventh veil. The atmosphere is kinda loud, but if you move away from the bar, it is possible to have a conversation. \n\nWe shared two chicken skewers, beet salad, sliders, stuffed peppers, asparagus, fries, and for dessert, the beer-amisu. The portions here are pretty small and we were hungary. Out of all the items, the chicken skewers were probably the standout. I would skip the stuffed peppers. Definitely get the beer-amisu. It's basically beer chocolate cake layered with the usual tiramisu ingredients. Definitely the highly of the night.", "author": "Alice W."}

Don't be confused because there's no signage, but keep walking until you get to an open doorway and find yourself in a soft lit bar with lots of dark wood seating. \n\nThe cocktail list is very promising: comprised of house cocktails and inspired classics, priced at $10 and $9, respectively. There were too many things going on in my head and I wanted to try it ALL: between good quality spirits (Hangar One, Four Roses Bourbon, etc) and ingredients like ginger syrup, egg whites, it was a dilemna. So I boldly told the bartender: \"make me something with fresh juice and gin.\"  She concocted a drink (the name escapes me) but it was overly sweet with too much blueberry puree. I was very apologetic on returning the drink to the bartender but all she said was, \"hey no problem, I'd be happy to make you one that you like!\"  Great customer service, I like that!\n\nTheir Bijou cockatil was more up my alley: made with a London dry gin, carpano antica vermouth, yellow chartreuse and orange bitters. Delish! \n\nIf you've got the munchies, the kitchen is open until 1:30am. How cool is that? In a sleepy city like SF, that is a huge plus! I got the Kennebec fries with curry ketchup and ranch sauce.

I had gone just a couple of times while living in SF four-ish years ago and have been jonesing to return ever since--though I wasn't sure if I was overhyping the place in my imagination or not. I remembered the bar as hidden, crowded, and sexy; the cocktails as excellently-crafted; and the bar eats as decently addicting (actually, I'm pretty sure something I ate here once was actually UNDERcooked... yet somehow I end up craving the food here. What?). Anyway, I recently had the pleasure of confiming my romantic notions of the place. North Beach is way hard to get out to whenever I'm in town, but after a jazz show the other night, I was super excited to have some time to stop here for a nightcap on our way home. The Sleepy Jean (chamomile-infused bourbon, lemon nectarine compote, bitters) definitely rocked me to sleep, in a good way--but not before allowing me some great people-watching entertainment on the floor of the bar (though it's a pretty diverse crowd, the one commonality is that peoples be gettin' DRUNK). I was loving the loungey, speakeasy-like vibe as much as I remembered. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise our credit card was accidentally left behind here that night? Because it meant we had to go back a couple days later to retrieve it, this time during the day. And I got to sample the biscuits and gravy (yum), a ridiculously strong cup of punch, as well as a complimentary shot of french toast soaked in some kind of alcohol passing for maple syrup. The bartenders here are also pretty nice and not snotty (for some reason I expected them to be at a place like this... proven wrong once again, judge-y self!).\n\nBars very rarely get 5 stars from me.

Why?\n\nBecause that is the address of it, 15 Romolo Place. Romolo is one of the shortest streets in SF, also one of its non-flatest. \n\nRomolo, sounding like a brother of Romulus and Remus who built Rome, is in the heart of San Francisco's historic sub-cultures that influenced the nation. It rises briefly and nearly straight up above the bright lights of Broadway, amidst the remaining old strip clubs first made famous by Carol Doda (well maybe her 44 double D's were more famous) at the Condor Club in the early 1960's.  She was the mother of all topless joints. \n\nBack then topless was rare anywhere (now, if you've seen one, you've seen two!), and it was the erotic transition period between the Go Daddy-o black beret Beatnik days in upper Grant and North Beach of Jack Kerouac to the on coming social phenomenon of the Flower Children Hippy days of Haight-Ashbury, with its own San Francisco centered musical explosion of Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, Santana and others.\n\nThat period of Doda, when Mod was the fashion and the Beatles were just coming across the pond, had it's own Iconic symbols of San Francisco's embrace of the free spirited. There was Mort Saul at the Hunrgry I comedy club, with visits from legends like Lenny Bruce and Phylis Diller. The Mitchell Brothers were making Pornos like \"Behind the Green Door\" with Marilyn Chambers, the Ivory Soap pure girl (RIP). There used to be a freeway entrance (pre-Loma Prieta earthquake) to the Embarcadero freeway at the east end of Broadway, where you would pass Go-Go girls dancing in cages outside the clubs on Broadway. \n\nIf you look at the sign of the building at 15 Romolo, it says the Basque Hotel. This space used to be a very popular, wait in line all the time, family style Basque restaurant. It was a little secret gem of foodies in the 80's, who could sit on long tables family style with strangers, before it became tagged as the \"Community Table\" of more chi-chi places today, and imbibe on generous pourings of red wine and hearty Basque dishes of legs of lamb and other Spanish mountain delights. \n\nToday, it is the same space, but now more of a quiet, dimly lit, popular \"secret\" hideaway to the 30 something singles of San Francisco. Gone are the community tables, but the wood floors and decor are still here. And besides an interesting and creative drink menu that is de rigueur for any SF hot spot, but with concoctions that would be scoffed at by any true, independently minded Basque, it offers pretty good little eclectic dishes, apps that hint at least to the concept of Tapas-like dishes of the previous restaurant's region, if not the actual ingredients and delivery. \n\nWe had chicken wings covered with a Thai curry sauce (not exactly Basque or Tapas), and pomme de terre frittes, er I mean french fries. Table service was friendly by the solo gal working that night. \n\nThis place has a low key vibe, quite unlike its previous incarnation of boisterous revery by a proud Basque heritage of hearty and independent mountain men with red cheeks full from red wine and red meat. \n\nIt has morphed into a semi-hipster, androgynous, post-yuppie puppy feel of a Valencia street dive bar, but without the drunken rancor. It  actually could be a nice drink place for a date amongst Yelp friends or on-line first daters form Match dot com, the 2 electronic trends born in The City that are currently transforming San Francisco and the country.\n\nSort of like Carol Doda's twin 44 DDs. \n\nHistory sometimes repeats itself, if you know anything of the past. \n\nIf you want a hidden gem for Basque Food in a town nearby with San in its name, ask me.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

Encouraged by the great ratings, my friends and I showed up at 8pm and got seats at the thin central table because most of the tables were reserved. Not a problem, we can roll with that... But then we noticed a few things off after that.\n\nFirst, there were only 2 beers on tap which was surprising for a Saturday night. The food was good yet it took a long time to arrive.

The customer service was good overall to the point that I was initially willing to give it 4 stars.\n\nBut the main reason I'm giving this 3 stars is that the yelp review for 15 Romolo was misleading: This is more of a bar than a great tapas restaurant.

The bartender was really rude & refused to take my order because I was sitting at a table. \n\nI eventually ended up getting the special drink where you can pick your own alcohol to add to it. Tasted like it was virgin. Oh, and the price is different on the website than at the bar (bar is $1 more). Also ordered the Thai'ish chicken wings.

It happened to be one of the few place that served food and had overall high reviews.  My friend was a bit hesitant as the alley way off Broadway seemed really shady.  But I knew we couldn't judge a book by it's cover here.  I believe there is a hotel next or above this also called 15 Romolo, which I think is a pretty cool name.  \n\nThe interior lends itself to a old classic SF bar with a dimly lit interior.  My friend mentioned that it seemed like the type of place Anthony Bourdain would frequent in SF.  We liked the fact that they offered a small quality menu with choice items.  The drinks menu was ample, but we chose a couple of Wilson's Smashes which were only $5 (YD special).  It actually had some absinthe in it as well as dark rum, which was really surprising because I could barely taste the alcohol.  That drink was truly superb, one of the best I've had in the city.  The bartenders take their time and are true to their craft; something you can really appreciate while drinking. \n\nWe then quickly decided to start off with an order of smoked pork sliders, a grass-fed burger with apple wood smoked bacon, and an order of fresh kennebec fries with madras curry catsup.  The wait wasn't too long, and the food was great.  I ate the porked sliders while my friend raved about the burger.  The fries were creative, especially the madras curry catsup; which I haven't tried before.  \n\nWe strangely ordered again, to try each others dishes... I was too curious about the burger.  It was good, and possibly one of the best for $6.  I started to feel that bit of absinthe by the end of dinner, pretty interesting. $60 total w/ tip for a couple excellent drinks and plenty of good food.  I was somewhat glutted after that, but that can often happen on a culinary jaunt.", "author": "Kenny P."}

Needless to say, I inhaled it within 3 seconds each time. I also ordered the Bone Marrow Fritters, which are deep fried balls of bone marrow. They were also delicious, but a bit overwhelming. Regardless, I would still order them again. For drinks, I ordered a Pimm's Cup and a Gin and Tonic. They make their Gin and Tonics strong, yum!\n\nThe thing that I love most about the place is its atmosphere. It's pretty small and it looks like an old bar from the 50s.

Our server was \"DREW\" and he was awesome! At 1:45 RIGHT AFTER WE PAY OUR BILL AND LEAVE A 25% tip an a large bill, Zach comes up to our table and tells us \"we don't have to leave but we we need to get the hell out of there\". No one took offense to that, of course we had no intentions of still being there at 2. Five minutes later @ 1:50 we where all ready to go just waiting for my friends wife to return from the restroom so we could leave. That's when Zach (NOT our server) came back to our table and very rudely says that we have to leave right at that moment? My friend tried to explain we where ready, just waiting for his wife to return from the restroom. He asked us to get up and go wait outside. I told him we still have almost 10 min before 2AM, that she will return any second, and NO, we will not get up and leave a my friends wife in the bathroom. Still standing in front of our table he calls over the bouncer and says \"they don't want to leave!\" ....WOW, really? I get it, everyone's trying to go home on time, but kicking us out 15-10 min early? There where still a few parties inside when we left @1:55. I worked as a server for years growing up so I am ALWAYS very respectful and tip 20-30%. Zach's aggressive and unprofessional manner in which he treated us was appalling.

This place has grown in popularity exponentially over the past year but its still solid. Yes it is crowded and it is not the biggest bar in the world but this place still surpasses all the bars in North Beach no questions asked. And you know what else is amazing? They actually make amazingly good drinks. They are legit bartenders who are friendly and just know how to mix strong drinks that taste awesome. It is definitely a rustic looking bar but definitely a classy affair I feel. I had a few food items and they have been all solid also which surprised me since most bar food Is just mediocre at best. What makes this place great is that it also has two atmospheres going on so if you want to be social just join the crowd on the floor but you can also choose to be laid back with your group of friends in the back and chat it up.\n\nIf you have not checked out 15 Romolo yet, you are missing out.", "author": "Dan M."}

Not to mention the place literally looked like a giant dingy matchbox when you walk in. But this is a case of do-not-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover. Because the drinks and food and prices and music are AMAZING!\n\nThey have creative cocktails that cost anywhere from $9-$11 or in that ballpark, which is pretty darn good, especially when you think about how expensive normal drinks or shots are at the Standard or Edison Bar in LA. The bartenders know their stuff and mix with great pride and flair. And their food menu late at night is not expensive either! Too bad we were full from dinner or I think we would have ordered more food! I was totally eyeing a grilled tomato and cheese sammich for $6, and I think sliders and burgers were the same price! \n\nORDERED:\n[Pimms cup]--absolute favorite. If I came back again, I would definitely order this one. It was sooo refreshing with cucumber and mint and rum and whatever the heck else they put in there, but ridiculously yummy.\n\n[La manzana]--I ordered this one and it was quite a pretty drink. I think it had something apple and citrusy inside with some kind of tequila base...geez, I don't even remember the stuff they mix in, but I just know it's GOOD. \n\n[Wilson's smash]--the roommate ordered this. I was eyeing it on the menu too, but it was basically rum and yum. \n\n[Huckleberry fizz]--NOT ON THE MENU! But the awesome waitress told us about it and it's a vodka base with huckleberry juice or soda (what is huckleberry anyway??) but you cannot taste the alcohol at all...it's like juice! haha loved this drink. I'd order it in a heartbeat as well. \n\n[Coke and rum]--yea yea I know, why list this? But really, I've never tried a better coke and rum! It was sooo smooth and delicious! If you're a coke and rum lover, try it! If you're not, try it! You'd be surprised :)\n\n[Fries]--wow $5 and AMAZING. Hot and piping, fresh cut potatoes, seasoned well with pepper...and AMAZING SAUCES. Homemade ranch that I actually liked (I don't really eat ranch), and CURRY KETCHUP. How cool does that sound?! It's really exotic and yummy =) \n\nLastly, they have a super cool jukebox and everyone in the bar will occasionally belt out singing when a good song comes on.(i.e. Journey, Benny and the Jets) Ahh, merry merry times.

He started asking her questions about her ID, and making comments, WHEN SHE NOTICED ANOTHER MAN WAS FILMING HER ID WITH HIS IPHONE OVER HER SHOULDER.

I had the baked egg on cornbread without the sausage, but with gumbo. Wife had the tofu scramble. Mine was unbelievable.

Please note, no words were exchanged between either of us, so what she did was not in retaliation of anything, other than where I was standing.  Also, nobody was working \"quickly\".

It's as if they enjoy the tease more than serving the drinks.\n\nI love this bar but please please please give me a soda or a glass of water if you know that you are going to ignore me for 15 minutes and then spend 10 minutes making my drink. \n\nI'll be coming back and I'll be waiting the same amount but I hope someone reads this that works there.

Let's start with the That's-That. 15 Romolo's take on the infamous It's-It, this thing is a delicious miracle concoction. The two cookies are homemade and sandwiched around humphrey slocombe malted milk chocolate ice cream. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate so when I saw it initially I was a little crestfallen. Then I took my first bite and considered stabbing the people at my table just to get their share of the dessert. It's freaking fantastic.\n\nThe Pixie cocktail, made with vodka, st. germain, dolin blanc, lemon, and mint, was so good that I just kept ordering them rather than trying something new. And if you know anything about me, you should know that I'm a firm believer that variety is the spice of life so it takes a lot for me to stick to one drink. \n\nWe also had the pork sliders, which were ever so soft and savory, melting like butter in my mouth with every bite and a chickpeas appetizer that was fried and spiced and somehow made me think of eating popcorn. \n\nI hear this place is ridiculously packed on the weekends, but go on a Tuesday like I did and enjoy the empty seating space with filling your mouth with delicious treats.

In my opinion, bars should all be like this: very serious looking places that are very serious about you not being too serious inside them. Meanwhile, they keep the talk flowing with ingenious drinks, tasty bites, good service and most surprising (to me) of all, a good juke. These people know what to do with a good bourbon. Most places in the city don't. 15 Romolo is rarely crowded to the point that most bars in the city are (crowded enough that everything kind of smells of stinky people), and this is a conscious decision.\n\nWonderful, wonderful place, I always want to go back.

It was small, no more than 1/4lb pre-cooked, but tangy and juicy. Their secret sauce uses spices and herbs like onions, shallots and other things I was a bit too Sunday Funday'd to remember now. At only $6 it really is only a small plate, but for a bar that positioning is undoubtedly correct.\n\nNo matter what mood I'm in, Romolo delivers.

Wasn't aware that this little gem existed until Rene at La Mar said it was her go-to spot for brunch, so off we went. Loved the little stairway that opened up into a warm and inviting dining room backed by a cozy bar. Started with perfect coffee straight from a French press and a Pimm's Cup that was delicious! We couldn't decide what to get, so we split the basic breakfast platter (two eggs, Portugese sausage, biscuit, hash brown squares and salad) and the brunch burger. The burger was amazing--perfectly seasoned with a hint of horseradish, it was dressed with bacon, an over medium egg and cheddar cheese. Totally delightful, and not overly heavy. The sausage was the only weak point of the meal--dry and sort of mealy--but I was told that's the way that Portugese sausage is prepared and served. We just won't get it next time. Loved the jukebox in the corner (next to the photo booth!) and the feel of the place. Our servers were awesome (Suzu, we're looking at you!) and we loved hearing about some of their recent awards for their prize-winning sherry. Happy to say the bill was VERY reasonable for that food, that drink and that service. Yay! We're fans!", "author": "Christina W."}

So, on some levels, I appreciate when a bar puts forth a concerted effort in making their cocktails something special.  I really appreciate a well constructed drink.  but i'm also the type of person who likes to just sit at the bar and stare at the wall and not really talk to anyone while drinking it, so the atmosphere on the particular night i went wasn't really good for that (see below).\n\nThe bartenders were a little too \"cocktail\" (starring Tom Cruise) for me. you know, spinning shit around and lighting stuff on fire and shaking things just a little too vigorously. I put my judgement aside  - or tried to - and just enjoyed the drink but it was still a bit much.\n\nI happened also to come here on a night when there were 2 private events, so even at 5:30 the place was stacked. the bartender had some issues keeping up, but then Tom Cruise showed up and things normalized. young-ish crowd, pretty hip scene, i'd say.\n\nso i'd probably go here again, but would like to come when there's less going on. there aren't many vegetarian options to eat.", "author": "Colin B."}

I have no idea what all the rave is about.  \n\nI was with a large group of friends this past Sat. night, and all of us were in agreement - their drinks sucked. From the syrupy, concentrated, sweet cocktails on their menu (tried Suckerbunch, White Elephant, Pimms),  to poorly done (color, taste, smell were off mark) standards like Manhattans, Old Fashioneds and Aviations,   this is no true mixologist joint.  Even my Irish Coffee was served in a snifter glass - right, because people love directly cupping a steaming hot glass in their hand, since the stem is  too short to hold with your fingers, esp when completely full and top heavy!  A snifter is not made for such things!  If you don't have a glass coffee mug for such a drink, then just say so. So literally, I tried about 7 drinks here,  all of which had problems. \n\nMaybe we're spoiled by the awesomeness of Hog N' Rocks, our usual go-to for specialty drinks - now those guys work some magic. Maybe they had a new bartender, maybe the bartender was drunk. In any case, when I am here, I'll just be ordering beer, wine, or something straight; something that they can't f*-k up.\n\nOh - they did have this alcoholic milk beverage with warm chocolate cookies dish for the holidays that was quite yums - we devoured those.

As an honest and fellow yelper, I would fess up to that and laugh at myself the next morning with full apology if I was.  Like I said, I had one drink (a Corona) prior to entering the bar.  No one, even a 21 year old 90-pound freshman in college that tasted alcohol for the first time would not be intoxicated with that.  It is sad that he stands by his ignorant bartender without apologizing for such HARSH HARSH words.  Wow, I am blown away.  Please, like I said...spread the word about this bar.  I was partial about the bar and more angry at the bartender but CLEARLY reading the response from the owner/manager, they CONDONE this hatred here.\n\n**Update** The owner deleted his response review.  After reading my response and other responses from other fellow yelpers, he probably felt like a moron.  Wrong answer buddy.  \n\n**Update** The owner contacted Yelp and I found out my previous review was deleted.  He also managed to get them to delete other Yelper's reviews who talked about this incident.  I find it sad that money is being used to pay off reviews that should be heard.  I've attached my previous review.  Before it was deleted it did get 26 \"Usefuls\", I guess the owner got nervous people are reading the truth.\n\n\"We do not serve your kind here\"\n\nMy kind?  Educated?  Black hair?  American born?  Filipino?  I'm sorry but hearing that from a bartender I'm automatically going to take major MAJOR offense to that.

I walked right up to the bar.  \n\n5 Minute Wait, tall brunette bartender was chatting with some guys finally asks me for what I wanted.  I asked for the drink menu.  \n\n10 Minutes later.  I notice the place gets a little more busy.  Tried to get her attention but she was preoccupied asking everyone and their mothers first.  Ok fine, no worries.\n\n10 Minutes later, a guy approaches me (I believe he was the manager of the night).  I ordered a pitcher of sangria for my group of girls and a drink special.  The guy walks away.\n\n10 minutes past.  Where is this guy?  Oh yeah, he's in the complete opposite end of the bar serving a bunch of people drinks.  Really?!! \n\nBrunette girl finally asks me what I wanted to order.  (Um your 30 minutes late).  I tell her firmly, that man (pointing at the guy from the opposite end of the bar) took my order along time ago and he's clearly serving other people.  \n\nBrunette walks over to the guy and comes back with our drinks a few more minutes later.  She takes my card and asks for the amount of glasses I wanted with attitude.  I was (like a nerd) tagging myself on yelp and wrote \"terrible service\"...she looks down at my iphone (I know you see it) and I said 8 (as you can see I am not a happy camper).  \n\nI turn to my colleagues and apologize that I was holding up the group.  I then say, \"Wow this place has terrible terrible service.  I never in my life waited this long for drinks.  Shitty service for sure.\"  I guess the brunette bartender heard me so she walked over GRABBED the pitcher and my drink from us (it has been sitting on the table already for a good two minutes and I WAS IN ALREADY DRINKING MY DRINK) and then while holding our order walks to the other end of the bar.\n\nShe comes back a minute later and tells me, \"I don't like how you are talking.  WE DO NOT SERVE YOUR KIND HERE.  You can leave\"\n\nWhat?!  Even my cousin turned to me shocked and asked, \"did I just hear that?\"\n\n#1.  I clearly was sober so I know I was not acting ghetto  I was not sloppy and I clearly stated the facts.  It was bad service and it was the slowest bar service I've gotten in SF.  I NEVER PERSONALLY attacked any of the workers or got aggressive with anyone.  I stated my opinion to my group of friends.  There is nothing wrong with that scenario.  I have multiple witnesses that saw this transaction and all of them where dumbfounded with what just happened since they clearly saw that I did nothing wrong.\n\n#2.  How UNPROFESSIONAL are you to take a drink and pitcher someone is drinking away from them and walk to the back with it?!!  Who does that?  Wow.  \n\nI truly hope you all spread the word about this bar.  I really wish you FIRE that tall brunette.

Now that I can safely consider 15 Romolo a favorite, it's time to write the stellar review that it deserves. \n\nMy last visit on Friday for happy hour was the perfect way to end my week. I started out with the Pimm's Cup - ginger is my new best friend - and ended with a Lambo and another delicious cocktail that I can't recall the name of. Three ridiculously potent cocktails in = One Tipsy Chick. \n\nSince it was then getting close to 8PM with nothing but strong libations slushing around in our stomachs, food was definitely in order. We split the pork sliders and fries which was the perfect amount of food for a small bite, not to mention completely slurp-worthy; next time I may not be sharing! \n\nFor those that are skeptical due to Romolo's seedy location, get over it. You won't even notice once you're in there; it's a safe haven from riff-raff lurking down the way....or who knows, after a few drinks perhaps you'll be joining a few of them on the pole (wink, wink).", "author": "Julia N."}

Cocktail menu changes fairly frequently and is invariably solid. (At some points it was maybe overly dominated by whiskey or similar cocktails -- which I love -- but usually it has something for everyone). And the setting is wonderful. \n\nBut it gets so busy on Fridays and Sats now, it's not even funny. Service is crazy slow, and I realize that it's not because they are not trying -- but you can make artisan cocktails only so fast. Also, sometimes on said nights there's been a guy at the door with quite an attitude. Door with an attitude at a bar of this style? Seriously???? (I'm not talking about the usual guy who's there most of the time and is pretty nice).\n\nAnyway, on a Fri or Sat I'd rather go to the Comstock Saloon, but I'll never go more than a couple of weeks without visiting 15 Romolo.", "author": "F K."}

He helped craft a cocktail program for the event and brought a huge level of insight & knowledge around San Francisco's culinary/bar scenes - as well as other local industries - to the event's panel, which he spoke on. The drinks at the event were so good that everyone headed back to 15 Romolo to close out the night, and Aaron & his team whipped up some seriously amazing new cocktails coming to the menu. It's always great to meet someone who not only runs a great business, but who also really cares about the larger city, industry & culture they're a part of.\n\nAside from super hospitable and genuine ownership, the food here is another lesser-known standout. They serve food til 1:30 AM (I think) on the weekends, so rather than grab a greasy slice of pizza on Broadway to finish the night, get Romolo's burger - my favorite in North Beach and one of my favorites in the city.\n\nOh, and brunch on the weekends?

I had the Buffalo Nickel which had bourbon, Root liqueur (kind of a sasparilla-y, root beer type of liqueur, but more complex and \"rooty\", a coffee tincture, ginger syrup and bitters.

The artist recommended the place and even joined us for a drink and some snacks.\n\nShe was surprised at how empty the place was (it was probably close to 10pm on a Sunday night), so I can't speak to the loudness of crowds mentioned in other reviews. It was perfect for us!\n\nThe location is sort of back-alley, out-of-the-way - which I really liked. The decor is, for lack of a better word, Portlandy (I'm speaking from a frame of reference of being a PDXer) - dark woods, ye olde saloon-feel, artisanal light bulbs, daily menus printed out like Old West broadsheet newspapers, photobooth in the corner. \n\nI had the Smokehouse Tea, which was really delicious. Usually smoked cocktails end up tasting like a drink + liquid smoke to me, but this one had a good balance of smokey/tart/sweet.\n\nWe split a basket of fries - the best damn fries I've had in a while. They came with an excellent curried ketchup, and even when they inevitably cooled to room temperature, they remained delightfully crunchy.\n\nI also had the watermelon/goat cheese/arugula/capicola salad. Also very good.\n\nNow, granted, I might have still been floating on an endorphin cloud post-session - but this was the absolutely best end to a memorable day. I don't doubt the place gets loud when more people are there (it's very warehousey with little there to absorb noise) but if you catch a moment when it's a little more empty, you'll want to spend some time just soaking it all in.\n\nPS: again, my perspective might be skewed, but the ladies room was not that scary.", "author": "Minna S."}

Trust me, these artists of drinks know what they are doing and I am thankful to escape from the world of vodka tonics and cosmos. Blech.\n\nWe ordered some fries and enjoyed our drinks, food and ambiance on a dark and stormy night. It was noir in the classic sense, down to my dark dress and pouty red lipstick.

The place is a huge open space that seems like a pretty typical bar in North Beach, isolated in the middle of long alleyway. We just wanted a quick appetizer, so we ordered the avocado tempura which was pretty good. It was a little too salty, but any form of avocado is good to me.\n\nThe primary problem here is with 15 Romolo's drinks. The drinks are not good at all -- you can tell immediately upon first sip that the \"mixologist\" (I use that term VERY loosely for this place) does not know the elements that go into a good drink. Their famed Pimm's Cup is a watered-down, poor man's version of the real thing. The ginger flavor is bland and it has no alcoholic flavor whatsoever. In fact, it tasted more like Ginger Ale mixed with soda water -- it was disgusting. I admire the uniqueness of using a cardboard straw, but realistically, I hated the soggy paper taste from the straw after about 10 minutes.\n\nI tried 3 of the other drinks: Lambo, Hemmingway's Daiquiri, and this other one called Rio something. All were not very good. \n\nWithin 20 minutes, we quickly paid the bill and got the hell out of there.

The tables are placed along the side of the walls, so there is a giant open space in the middle.\n\nThe ambiance is nice for a date, it's pretty dark, so if you are a visual eater, I'm not sure this will be appealing to you, but if your date isn't too great looking I'm sure you'll definitely enjoy this spot.\n\nThe waitress took our order, but she didn't write anything down. Nervous as I was I had high hopes that she would get my order right- she didn't. \nIt was ok, I just ate it anyway because service is quite slow here if you are expecting to eat your meal at a table, and I didn't want to wait another 20-25 minutes to get my food.\n\nI ordered the brisket sliders, and it was OK. I thought my burger was pretty bland, and extremely messy to eat, as pieces of brisket spilled out of their buns and onto my plate. I didn't dislike the burger, but it wasn't anything to write home about.\n\nCollectively as a group, we ordered a salad, shrimp + corn bread, and french fries. The salad was pretty good, it had a tangy dressing but it was not overwhelming. \n\nThe shrimp + cornbread was also decent, it was heavily drizzled with some creamy orange sauce, which in turn made the cornbread quite soggy. The shrimp was really good, but I didn't want to be a jerk and eat all the shrimp, but the cornbread itself wasn't that great. It was a little too mushy for my taste.\n\nThe fries were the best part of the dish for me. They are well peppered, so I guess if you don't like black pepper you wouldn't really enjoy this side. I however, LOVE black pepper so I thought it was probably the best and the most well season dish of the night.\n\nMy friend ordered the Primms cup, and I had a little sip of hers. I'm not usually an alcohol drinker, but this one was pretty good. It was reminiscent of a mojito, because it was fizzy and carbonated, but it was not minty. It was almost like a ice tea soda.", "author": "Lam Y."}

The jukebox had a great selection.  The bartender was a nice gal who moved from Austin to San Fran, so being that I'm also from Texas we had some things to talk about, and she gave me some insight on the city's contrast to what I'm more used to.  She mixed us some stout drinks, and made for a fun couple of hours.\n\nAs far as the bar food, the pulled pork sliders are incredible.  Pulled pork, spicy sauce and a crispy sweet slaw.  My buddy got the burger, and it looked great too.  Both selections are six bucks, I think, and more than enough to fill you up while you're having some drinks.

Luckily we found a couple tables for all of us to collaborate at, and it was just perfect for a close gathering of friends with some great 'people watching' going on. You never get bored playing that game in SF.. lets be honest. \n\nI only gave it 4 stars for the ridiculously looooong wait I had at the bar to order 2 beers for a friend and I. Honestly... it was worth it for the atmosphere of the place, and the uniqueness of this bar, but I must have waited at LEAST 10-15 minutes to even be looked at.

Cool lighting fixtures and sort of a hipster meets saloon atmosphere, but not in a way that would make people feel like they weren't cool enough to hang out there. Furniture is sparse, and it was a little chilly in there.\n\nThe staff was super nice and attentive, offering us table service, even though it was slow and could have asked us to go up to the bar. They have small eats, but we were there for the cocktails. \n\nI was hoping the drinks would be akin to those at Elixer or Alembic: fun concoctions, made with fresh ingredients, and a throwback to the days of the Sidecar. The menu for drinks is fun and long, and takes some time to decipher. All cocktails are $9-$10. \n\nWhen the drinks arrived, unfortunately they failed to live up to their clever names. There is no subtlety of flavor, many were overshadowed by sweet liquors, and some tasted medicine-y. They were stiff enough to order more, as we did, though I was a little bummed this wasn't a spot my out-of-town friends would be impressed with.\n\nI would imagine it's a fine place to get a regular vodka tonic, I would return for that, and for the kind staff.", "author": "Ali H."}

A friend and I went on Sunday around noon and the place was deserted. Not a bad thing, just strange that the whole world hasn't discovered already how awesome it is.\n\nThe service was very warm, friendly and personable. Everyone who worked there was just nice. The atmosphere is a bit dive-y, but not unpleasantly so. It's not a fancy, romantic place, but it feels intimate, relaxed and inviting. I don't know what it's like at night and/or when it's crowded.\n\nThe food was very good, and, at about $10 per plate, very reasonably priced. My friend got the Distiller's Mash--total comfort food. I got the French Toast, which was paired with pears and bacon--very, very good. I think the toast could have used more syrup; I should have just asked for more but I wasn't thinking. Oh--and before the food got there, we were given these adorable little Waffle Shots (or whatever they're called)--shot glasses with a little divine liquid at the bottom and a couple of squares of crunchy-soft waffle. SO good.\n\nWe both enjoyed our food a lot. We felt torn--should we write glowing reviews about it on Yelp? Should we keep it our secret? I think a balance is important. We agreed that not telling anyone put the brunch at risk of being shut down, so for the greater good (the greater good!), I am writing this.\n\nOh--I got coffee--it was good, strong--in a french press. My friend got the \"Breakfast for Champions #2,\" which we both agreed was very good. It came in a port glass (a miniature wine glass), but I think it was smaller because it was served at room temp, sans ice.\n\nLater, I asked them what was in the aforementioned divine liquid in the \"Waffle Shot\" thing, and they not only told me, but the bartender, Morgan, pretty much gave me the recipe. I thought that was cool. They didn't act all mysterious and proprietary about it-- which, if they had, I would have accepted as being reasonable.

I came here around midnight on a weeknight for post-dinner cocktails that were absolutely delicious (and strong!). It was quiet at that time, but I hear it gets nuts on the weekends (think 15 minute wait for your cocktail). Our waitress was exceptionally friendly and helpful in answering our (possibly stupid) questions about what all of the unique alcohols are (we could have asked Google, but what fun is that?) The atmosphere was dark and romantic, with great music. It's a good spot for a date.", "author": "Amelia C."}

The hipster douchbag that was checking ID's at the door Saturday night must have just realized that after years of getting picked on for his love of 1st person shooter games, has a job now where he can flex the tiny bit of power that that gives him.  Not only did he harrass a friend of mine before we even got in the door, but he became completely irrational after being challenged about his decision to kick out a friend of ours that made the mistake of trying to take his drink outside (something he apologized for, but to no avail).  He also had a hair trigger and called 911 accusing us of assault.  Apparently, when someone challenges this dumb@#$!, he jumps to conclusions and immediately calls the cops.  That made for a great conversation with the SF PD and, after listening to our story about what had just gone on, they quickly figured out that this was a big waste of everyone's time (especially the 15 cops that were there).  I'd also like to call out the completely berzerk manager.  She had absolutely no rationality to what was happening and poured fuel on a spark that could have been extinguished by just shutting her mouth and listening to both sides of the story.  \n\nSo, if you find yourself anywhere near Broadway and you need a drink, think really hard about whether or not you like standing in line for bathrooms, being verbally abused and then having to explain yourself to the fuzz and then go down the street to the Tosca Cafe.\n\nWell done Rome-Alone.

First on the morning of my birthday, and then again on the night of my birthday. My first night Boris was my bartender and Scott was also shaking up a couple drinks. I sat down on the bar stool and said \"I like rum, it's my birthday, what can you make me?\". Boris smiled, and presented me with his take on the old-fashioned. He made it with three rums, and the only one of which I can remember is Smith & Cross. It was superb.\n\nWhat I admired most about the way they tended bar was the supreme care they took in making their drinks. At Romolo they strain all of their drinks that are shaken twice (Once Hawthorne, once fine mesh) to prevent any tiny ice particles from ruining the purity of the drink.\n\nWe also had a track 42, which was a honey vodka based cocktail, also superb, and a rising sun which was made with Yamazaki 12 (an aged Japanese whiskey). The final drink of the night was something that I can't recall, but was delicious and given my state of inebriation, I'm unlikely to recall the name any time soon. To end the night I had their desert entitled \"that's that\". Two homemade cookies sandwiching a scoop of maple ice cream. That is the most awesome way to end a night in my humble opinion.\n\nFast forward 23 hours. Back again, a sincere glutton for punishment indeed. This time my birthday party was in full swing, and instead of two, we brought twenty.\n\nI want to talk about the food. French fries, with curry catsup. I hate catsup (or ketchup for that matter), but I ate it and I loved it. I repeat, I HATE CATSUP, but there was absolutely no way you could not try that delicious sauce, and the ranch wasn't bad either ;). My brother had the sliders, and judging by how quickly he ate them (HE DIDN'T OFFER ME ANY ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!) they must have been terribly delicious. Back to the drinks :D.\n\nI went to the bar and said \"I closed this bar this morning, and I'll close it again tonight. I love rum and I'd like a drink for my birthday\". Just like boris, our new bartender Ethan smiled and said \"sure\". A couple moments later I was awarded with a Hemingway Daiquiri. Hemingway was a diabetic so there's no sugar in a Hemingway Daiquiri, but I didn't miss it. It was a great drink. I had about six or seven more drinks that night, and I quite frankly don't remember them all, but I do remember that they were all delicious.\n\nAll in all, 15 Romolo is one of my new favorite bars in San Francisco. And did I mention the kitchen is open till 130am? EPIC WIN.\n\nTL;DR: Great bar, awesome staff, super drinks, spectacular bar food, wonderful evening.\n\nThank you to Scott, Boris, Ethan and Jared. It was a great birthday.\n\nCheers,\nJosh", "author": "Joshua G."}

In the midst of all the hustle and bustle in North Beach, it was so nice to sneak away into an alley to simply have drinks.  \n\nThe drinks here are unique and tasty.  The Pimm's Cup definitely did not disappoint and my new obsession is egg whites in drinks so the Track 42 was equally amazing.  If I had stayed longer, I'm sure I would have had 3 more glasses.  My friends got there a little early (9ish) so they were able to get a table which made hanging out there feeling slightly homey.  \n\nBy far the best thing about this place is their Yo Mama style burger! I had just come back from New Orleans raving about the peanut butter burger from Yo Mama's and lo and behold...15 Romolo serves it too!  Although it's not the \"real thing\", it is bomb.

So, in an effort to branch out, we hit up 15 Romolo a couple weeks ago.\n\nI had been here a number of times, but not in several years.  It seemed differently colder, and smellier.  I was hungry, but the dankish odor of past vomit ill-concealed by industrial cleaner, mixed with overflowed toilets of days gone by but not forgotten, along with general human-stink, made me want to dash.  \n\nI stuck it out, had a cocktail, and ordered some grub.  The food was decent, and the booze helped ease the odor unpleasantness.  The mini-burgers looked alarmingly like frozen White Castle patties feebly nestled in white bread buns, but were deceptively tasty.  Not fall-off-your-chair good by any stretch -- it was more of a an unmet expectation of cardboard.\n\nThe service was good, as were the beverages.  We did not stay long, however, as the music was phenomenally loud (and this was early evening, say, 5:30 PM). In fact, when I noticed my happy hour pal's vocal cords bulging from her neck as she attempted to holler updates from her work-week and life, I hailed our server for the tab.  \n\nOnce out in the alleyway, we commented that it was as if the staff had cranked-up the tunes to psych themselves up for the evening while stocking the bar and prepping for the crowd (and there was a sizable post-work crowd) but forgot to dial it back when they opened the doors for business.  At midnight on a weekend, talk is cheap, but at 5:30PM during the work-week, I found myself saying things like, \"I could not even hear myself think!\" This, in turn, made me feel old.

Our iPhone's Yelp compass points toward an alley named Romolo, and not more than 20 feet up a slight incline, a small neon sign beckons softly, \"pssst, this way, mind the STDs.\"\n\nStepping over puddles and rivulets (knowing that it hasn't rained in over a week), we clamber up the alley and peek through a doorway into a soft-lit, wooden interior. A fully-stocked bar illuminates one half of the room, while the rest of the interior is outfitted with a smattering of tables and chairs and a jukebox pumping some reasonable tunes. Gazing around, we could swear we'd been here before, albeit in a slightly less sober state. Could it be? A cozy, nook of a bar located mere footsteps away from Broadway's bedlam?\n\nScott Baird and Aaron Smith (of Coco500 and Rye fame) reopened 15 Romolo in mid-February of 2009, amidst some modest fanfare. Being the mastermind behind Quince 2.0's stellar cocktail menu, Scott was the draw, and he and Josh have made some appreciable changes to 15 Romolo.\n\nThe cocktail menu, containing originals and classic concoctions (both straight and 'twisted'), is drinktastic. Among the many libations we experienced that night, standouts were:\n\n- Hunter's Flip, (porter, rum, sasparilla and nutmeg)\n- Fiscal Agent (bourbon, chartreuse and cocoa nibs)\n- Vieux Carre (rye, Benedictine and peychaud's bitters)\n- (off-menu) Smokin' Bols (in-house infused Bols Genever gin) \n\nNot only is 15 Romolo a drinkie's haven, but the bar gets huge props for serving grub until 1:30 a.m., with some interesting menu items that include a hot dog stuffed in a tortilla, slathered with cheddar and deep fried. Fried cheese dog...? Bring it.\n\nWhat isn't altogether clear is whether the clientele is aware of the bar's caliber. On our visit, the party of six next to us was quaffing cosmos and coronas while fondling each other as if they were auditioning for a Tommy Hilfiger ad (FAIL).

No snobbery here. The bartenders will ask you what you want and based on your preferences they will mix up a special elixir just to suit your needs. I asked for something sweet, but not overly sweet with rum and pineapple....the bartender handed me a sugar rimmed cocktail and called it a \"Havana.\" This place rocks because the bartenders take meticulous pride in their art. They have to be mixologists because they are just that good.

Tucked into an alley off the glitter of Broadway, the classy, Prohibition-era interior decor provides a sense of retreat from the bustle and business of everyday life.  I recommend this as a place for a first date, especially if you both work in the FiDi.  Grab a booth or sit at the bar and let the barkeeps mix you both up something special.\n\nThe barkeeps know their stuff.  You'd be hard pressed to find better mixologists anywhere else in the city, and the prices are still very reasonable.  The menu rotates, so it's difficult to make recommendations.  If you don't like your first round, feel free to have a short chat with whoever is taking care of you, and I'm sure they'll whip you up something pleasant.\n\nExtra bonus:  Although this place has plenty of floor space for large groups, it still manages to maintain an intimate feeling if you sit/stand at the bar, or grab a table.\n\nOne drawback: Men's room can sometimes be a wait.

We watched the bartender make it and we were very impressed.  Watching him meticulously make a drink was like an art.  I love how he tastes everything he makes to make sure it tastes right.  Pimm's cup was so delicious and refreshing! It had gin, cucumbers, and ginger beer..yummm...i love it! and i would defnitely order it again.

Fantastic, inventive cocktails for not a retarded amount of cash: $9 a piece for crazy inventive ones, and $8 for some classic ones that everyone should have at least once a week. I mean seriously...go look at their menu (and count the 2 original scotch cocktails up there...not so common I tell ya!). One of the best parts is that the bartenders aren't indifferent...like those at this other inventive cocktail bar I know of called...oh...La Cantina. They really are cool people with a great sense of humor.\n\nGood loungy layout - plenty of tables along the walls, but a big open space in the middle so when a bunch of people start to pack the place, you don't need to hover over the kinds ladies and gents at the tables. Crowd seemed kind of cold to newbies - lots of stares without a lot of interaction, but that could have to do with the fact that everyone was dressed as santa...and therefore, a bit scary (therefore, I'm not reading too much into the crowd's lukewarm response).

Bombarded with events to attend and things to see and men to do (wait, what?), I found myself transitioning to the more raucous clubs and bars frequented by hordes of people my own age. \n\nHad I come here when I was still shuttling in from Oakland, I would have loved it. Both early in the evening and in the week, 15 Romolo is pretty quiet. You can slide up to the bar and order any number of tasty libations (the cucumber ginger drink is particular memorable) and exemplary bar bites (pork sliders are slop-down-your-face good). \n\nComing here now on a weekend night, I DO love it. It's a bustling spot full of attractive people. Admittedly, it is a bit of an older crowd (30+) but in this day and age, a girl has got to expand the age limits of her potential dating pool. \n\nMy only gripe is that service is SLOW. They don't have \"well drinks\" - everything comes directly from a can or a bottle, so I can understand the delay. My old self wouldn't mind the wait so much, but nowadays I like the drinks to be a'coming quickly so I can get my mack on some dude. \n\nYes, kids, I believe that's called regression.", "author": "Devon S."}

I started the day on about 4.5 hours of sleep, which is at least 3.0 hours less than I really need to be functional.  I then spent the day asking questions of a man who was either brain dead or trying to be cute.  This approach never works, and it's frustrating to have to play the game.  I'm getting too old for this shit.\n\nMy crappy day notwithstanding, one of my coworkers was owed a significant celebration.  Virtually all courtrooms (like churches) are designed basically the same: there's the gallery [where the public sits, often in very pew-like benches], the well [many lawyers don't even know it's called the well, but that's where the tables for the plaintiff and defendant are], the jury box [self-explanatory], and the bench [for the judge].  Between the gallery and the well, there's always a rail of some kind.  And the rail itself has a very specific name: the bar.  Traditionally, only lawyers were allowed to walk past the bar and enter the well---clients and witnesses sat elsewhere.  Thus, it was said that only a lawyer could pass the bar.  And the phrase stuck.\n\nSo, as I said, my coworker, having recently (well, a month-and-a-half ago) found out that she had, indeed, passed the bar, was owed a significant celebration.  And she chose happy hour at 15 Romolo.  And it was an excellent choice.  The drinks were very good, and I spent a few minutes talking with one of the bartenders about their interesting decision to make a cocktail based on Old Granddad (which I happen to like, but which no one would mistake for high-quality liquor).  The bar food was also excellent.  The setting is very interesting---like a slightly rehabbed sawdust bar [it occurs to me that the likelihood of anyone on SF Yelp actually having ever been IN an honest-to-goodness sawdust bar is extremely small], but in a good way.\n\nI'm not giving 15 Romolo the full 5 stars yet because we started happy hour a bit early, and the place was basically empty during our entire visit, so I didn't get a good sense for the energy of the place.  I will certainly be back, and once I get the full experience, I'm pretty confident this will enter into my regular rotation.", "author": "Ben P."}

On the food part, take a pass and save yourself.  Now they had a fire and I do not know how that affected the kitchen at all, but the food, was not good.  The fried chicken biscuit burnt, tasteless chicken.  The stuffed peppers were weak, more rice and where was the sausage?  Then omg, Catfish and Hush Puppies.  Who taught the cook how to cook?  Um, it's gross to have 3/4 done deep fried catfish in a tempura kinda cormeal-ish batter.  And you didn't season the fish?  What is up with San Francisco? Has it become a salt-free zone?  Here is a hint, when you cook catfish, use a skillet, not a deep fryer, it's NOT fish and chips, and season the fish. It's a bottom feeding lake fish, you need to season it.  Ugh.  I really do not like it when people \"try\" to cook southern food or they devise a silly \"take \" on it.  Hire somebody from New Orleans or something and get to cooking.  The Sliders on those store bought rolls?  Weak, and it didn't smell the freshest.  Really it's my fault, if a place wont back up good apps or bar food with requisite prices, you should be very suspicious.  No dish over $8 mostly, should've scared me away and it's too dark to eat there.  They shouldn't serve food.  And dammit stop it with all the tapas style nonsense.  Tapas are Spanish, just call them appetizers and let's get on with it.  The fries, weak.  More bits and pieces than anything.  Sf is losing some food mojo.\n\nOnto the drinks, Amazing.  I would simply grab a huge meal elsewhere and drink it off here.  The cocktails are AMAZING.  I cannot go on more about the flavors, the surprises, the sheer taste of their drinks.  I'd go back there anytime for that and that is what kept me from really slamming them with 2 stars.  Go there with friends, it's a cool little joint, great drinks and just stay away from the food.

Let me just say I never venture to NB these days because the crowds are generally pretty douchey. \n\nIf we hadn't been coming with a crowd from the elite event at A5A Steak lounge, I'm sure it would have been close to empty. A shame- because it's such a find in this area. A place you almost don't want to tell anyone for fear that it will be overrun by lame asses come next month. But why not spread the love around? \n\nThe interior feels rustic, almost like you've stumbled into a chic  log cabin lounge- sans the taxidermy on the walls.  There is  tons of seating along the wall (big plus) with  unique yet simple lighting. \n\nThe service was super prompt- and we ordered the $6 burger,  ($5?) pork sliders and the olives. Whatever they're doing in that kitchen back there- is phenomenal. By far the best bar bites I've had in a long time: the pork sliders come with a slaw and the meat is tangy and tender. The burger was equally devourable- and it was the perfect amount to share on a budget. \n\nThe \"pixie\" is by far my favorite drink of the moment- kind of a minty lemon drop- but better. I can honestly say that I would venture back to NB just for this bar...that good.", "author": "NaNa M."}

Yes, all the bartenders are young, skinny, and mustachioed. Yes, they sell $2 Tecates. But at the same time, the food menu is eclectic and delicious (double down burger & fried green tomatoes are amazing).  The decor is leather and mahogany and the lights are dark. The liquor selection is extensive, with a variety of gin and bourbon that you don't find in a run of the mill bar. The beer variety is also not your average miller/coors/corona b.s. \n\nThe Pimm's Cup is a complex and delicious mix of juices and liquor and the Lambo (with either bourbon, or rye) is a classic cocktail that hits the spot after a long day.", "author": "Anton M."}

Hello, recession friendly menu - the burger at Romolo is probably the best $6 burger that you can find in SF. And *bonus food* homemade pickles. Yum. Fries are an extra $5 but come out hot and crisp, in a huge mound that can easily serve 2-3 people.\n\nI also worked my way through more of the cocktail menu (what can I say...daddy likes his drinkie) and would definitely recommend the Rio Grande (Bourbon and tequila? Hello, double trouble!) and Pimm's Cup.\n\nIf you are a fan of a well crafted cocktail or some budget friendly bar food you should do yourself a favor and get down to Romolo, stat.

And yet, the clean space, friendly service, delicate cocktails and a certain inexplicable airiness about the place* are more likely to put at least me in a better mood.  I walked in thinking, \"I didn't know I wanted to drown my sorrows in Bourbon until about a minute ago**\" - then the music picked up, the company was cheery, and the bartender taught me all sorts of wisdom nuggets about herbal cocktails.\n\nThe Rio Grande mixed tequila and bourbon to perfection with a salty sweet rim.  The yellow bicycle gave a lift with it's lemony effervescence.  The fries had just a touch of curry dusted on them, and the \"fancy ranch\" fer dippin' wasn't half bad.\n\nOff the beaten path, you won't find your typical North Beach clientele (do I need to describe?) or decor.  A dark little oasis just an ally up from the strip clubs.\n\n*not to be confused with whimsy, which this place has only a smidge of, and it's in those crazy light fixtures\n**I don't mean to portray Romolo as dingy.

(Note: Bobcat Goldthwait is a funny man who loves booze.  He's not a market analyst.)\n\nThankfully the above scenario is not the case at 15 Romolo.\n\nFirst let me tell you what they didn't do.  They didn't touch the bar.  They still have their unique mix of excellent spirits, carefully thought out menu of drinks, and skilled bartenders.  The also didn't mess with the vibe of the place.  It's still sophisticated without being pretentious.\n\nNow, what did they change?  They added a enticing menu of swanky bar food which they proudly serve right up until 1:30 am.

The pulled pork sliders were un-be-lieve-a-ble - tasted like the softest pork between two slices of fluffy butter.  The halibut ceviche was a little less compelling, but the price is right at $7 and it's worth it if you like ceviche.\n\nThey don't have Anchor Steam on tap (I ordered one and was disappointed to receive a bottle), but their cocktail list is full of artisanal creations; I ordered a sazerac and was very pleased.", "author": "Oliver N."}

It had such great reviews and I love bars with similar vibes, so I expected to love it.\n\nI started out with a Pimm's Cup, which was good. I definitely recommend this drink. For my second drink, I decided to tell the bartender what I liked and let him concoct something for me. I told the bartender that I wanted something with elderflower and also discussed other qualities I wanted in my drink. I did not like at all what he gave me. It was something with champagne and elderflower liqueur (don't remember what else), but I didn't get any elderflower flavor and it had an unpleasant taste to it. I wanted to give another bartender another try for my third drink because I thought that second one might have been a fluke. So I asked someone else for a different elderflower drink. This time I got something with vodka. Again, I didn't get any elderflower flavor and wasn't particularly pleased with the drink. It wasn't as bad this time, but I still wasn't satisfied. I'm sad to say I left pretty disappointed with the drinks here.\n\nThey have a photo booth in one corner of the bar, which was fun. This may have been the one redeeming quality... which, given that this is a bar, is kind of sad.\n\nTo be fair, I haven't tried the food here and would be down to try it.

I could see the entire bar from where I was standing and told him that it didn't look full to me to warrant a wait in the cold. He then proceeded to stand up and get in my face and said I was being rude. I told him I was doing no such thing and that he yelled at me when all I was doing was inquiring about why there was a line to a moderately filled location. He then proceeded to call me the \"B\" word, which was the ultimate insult, it took all my willpower not to yell profanities in his face and cause a riot.

In fact, I only just now signed up for Yelp so I could review the place and hopefully influence the management to make a key change.  \n\nFirst, and most importantly, 15 Romolo has great drinks and great food.  My favorite drink in the entire city is their Rio Grande.  The management has made a strong effort to get consistency across bartenders since 15 Romolo renovated and established their current drink list.  I've noticed this positive evolution in drink quality during my last couple of visits.\n\nThere is a significant problem though that I'm surprised others on Yelp haven't mentioned given that I've experienced it consistently at 15 Romolo.  The service is terrible!  I've been to many of the \"artisanal\" cocktail spots in the city and I realize that quality drinks take a little longer to make.  But the service at 15 Romolo is unacceptably slow.  On both recent visits, even when the place was only moderately busy, whole rounds were consumed before a newly ordered drink was delivered.  I would sit and drink my cocktail while my friend watched and, just when mine was gone, her cocktail would finally be delivered.   Then the cycle would repeat with my newly ordered cocktail.  Doesn't it benefit both 15 Romolo and its patrons to have enough staff behind the bar to meet demand?\n\nAnd while I'm on it, the waitress who works the tables is a tad surlier than most hipster waitresses.  But I'll give her the benefit of the doubt! Perhaps she's worn out by how slowly she is able to deliver drinks to her customers.  For that, I would be surly too.\n\n15 Romolo I love you, but you're bringing me down!  Please get the service right like you have the food and drinks.", "author": "Mike C."}

The elixir menu seems very creative.

It becomes easy to spot when you search for the \"Basque Hotel\" sign. I love the vintage style decor and the wide selection of drinks/cocktails, but it's not a place with a huge draft beer selection (only 4 on tap). We ordered a few shots and they came in puny little half-shot glasses, at full-two-dollar-sign price. So that was a little disappointing. It's also not a great place for groups (I came on a Saturday night). Some tables definitely cleared out within 30 minutes of me getting there, but I wouldn't recommend coming with more than 4 people. I usually try to avoid bar food, and I did successfully that time, but it actually looked quite tasty. Overall 15 Romolo has a laid back charm with stiff drinks and attractive clientele. It's a great pit-stop before a night of havoc in the fine Broadway establishments. Just wait for me Cinnamon.", "author": "Kenneth L."}

There's an interesting mural across from it with a man with pipes coming out of the spot where his crotch would be. Easy to miss, unless you know what you are looking for.\n\nTheir specialty cocktails are delicious and strong - $9. They're special, so they take a little time to make. If you order one of these, watch them mix and match concoctions [from bottles, unlabeled jars, etc] at the bar. They must be magical! By the end of the night, I probably sampled all of the drinks on the specialty menu. Gotta love those birthday drinks! Everyone just wanted to see me stumble down the alley and into Hungry I by mistake... Didn't happen though.\n\nIt wasn't too crowded for a Saturday night, and we pretty much took over the place with the party. \n\nRandom Notes: Tuesday Night is movie night. The women's restroom [lit only by one tiny bulb] is down a hallway, while the men's room is right there. You can bring food inside.

It gets cramped, humid and hot easily. Beers are $6 and limited. The bathroom for women is only one stall, no mirrors, with an airplaine-style lock that is stuck on \"vacant\"... and for some reason they put it in the corridor that leads straight out into the trash.

Much to my surprise, they were closed for a private party. Fuck. So, we went to 15 Romolo because i knew they had food as well. As we sat down, i looked at the menu and read that their kitchen doesn't open till 6pm. And we were there at 520. I asked if we should put our food order in while we were ordering drinks or wait until 6 when the kitchen opened and when they found out that we just wanted a burger and fries, they put the order in and we had food fifteen minutes later. Danny and Katie, who served us, couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. I almost left Jovanie at the bar and took Katie to the show. They have Smooth Ambler whiskey , which is my favorite, and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Not at all like most bars in North Beach. Which is a BIG compliment. We also had their banana bread dessert which was AMAZING.

He recently bought the place and will make improvements along with serving European-influenced bar food which is very unique. He's also very generous, offering and taking a shot of patron with all of us. The man definitely has the experience and the will to make this place a success.

I have a friend who used to bartend here, which is how I found out about this place. Since its hidden in an alley way off Broadway, I may not have otherwise discovered it. The hors d'oeuvres here are super yummy, I love the pulled pork sliders. The drink menu is very unique and different from any other bar menu Ive seen. There are some foreign whiskeys and other liquor that cant be bought in regular stores and its really fantastic- if you're into that sort of thing. Try the 'Golden Triangle' or ask one of the bartenders to make you something they'd recommend. They know what they're doing and they're all really nice. \n\nI hosted a big birthday party for myself and a friend here last August. We had probably around 50-70 friends come, and it was the perfect  drinking spot. Not too crowded, there are plenty of comfortable tables and booths to sit at.

A bowl of fries was dropped at our table about 5min later, and the gentleman who hastily dropped them on the table wasn't paying enough attention to us to notice that we were trying to tell him we didn't order fries.  We flagged our server down and she gave us the fries on the house and resubmitted our order for chips/dip.  Strike One.\n\nThe chips/dip came another ten minutes or so later, still no beverages, which were why we were there in the first place.  The waitress was nice and kept assuring us that our drinks would be up soon, but they never arrived.  About 25min after originally placing the order, she came to the table to tell us that the bar had lost our drink order, and they were working on them, and that they'd be on the house.  We settled up for the food (which was by now devoured) and anxiously awaited our drinks.  Strike two.\n\nAfter waiting for about another 15min for our [complimentary] drinks, we gave up and left.  All told, we were there over 45min and never got single cocktail, and we ended up being late to our dinner reservation.  Did it cost us anything?  Yeah, an hour out of a special night and the expense of an extra cab ride.  Strike three.\n\nMy brother in law, who was with us, was excited to take us there and tells us that he has had several good experiences there, but I definitely won't seek this place out in the future.  I will be generous and give two stars just because (1) the food we ate was pretty damn good for bar food and (2) although she wasn't able to deliver much to our table, our server was very nice and seemed to be genuinely trying to take care of us, (although it's not clear whether it was her or the bar staff actually dropping the ball).", "author": "Aaron T."}

At one point, people were remarking \"I didn't realize we planned for karaoke tonight\". Then Jameson on the rocks cost $10. Pouring was pretty decent but still a little too pricey.

It took them seemingly 20 minutes to get drinks - kind of unacceptable, even with the crowd.

Each drink is meticulously prepared with home-made tinctures, simple syrups, infusions, and rims...

The reason I'm giving this place 5 stars solely resides on the bartender Brandon. He was super polite, introduced himself and understood me as I slurred \"gin and tonic\" at him.  He also made my friend a tasty strawberry cocktail, but I couldn't tell you what it was called.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-12-15", "description": "Zero stars for the general attitude and service from one of the bouncers on Friday night (Dec 11) who would not let me in. \n\n1 star for everything else 15 Romolo does right. \n\nRelationship I've had w/ 15 Romolo before Dec. 11:\n-June: First time to 15 Romolo for my good friend's going away party. Decided I loved the place.\n-July: A good friend and I celebrated our birthday here\n- Numerous times over the past 5 months: I have recommended this place to friends and come here myself to enjoy their drinks and atmosphere. I enjoy the juke box and friendly service behind the bar and from the waitresses who so kindly bring drinks to people when there's a packed crowd.\n-This month: a friend's company is having their holiday party here.\n\nFacts and expectations I have about 15 Romolo:\nAlthough it's in North Beach along with dance clubs/lounges, strip clubs and hole in the wall bars, I still think it's a nicer bar for North Beach because of their d\u00e9cor, their bar/drink menu and the way I've been treated in the past by the staff inside. I know it's not perfect: their juke-box is sometimes working, they need more bartenders, it can get hot in the summer, etc... But it's a nice bar for NB. The bar tenders are nice once you can actually order your drink and the waitresses are great. Now naturally after frequenting a place I come to have expectations about it. Well, Friday night did not meet my expectations. At all. In fact, I'm not sure if I'll ever go back here.\n\nStory of Friday night:\nI'm coming from a work event that ended late. I show up at 15 Romolo a little before midnight with my boyfriend and 2 co-workers. We're told right away by two different bouncers we have to wait in a line that doesn't exist because the place is over capacity. We waited in total about 30 minutes or so and never got in. My two co-workers ended up leaving as to better the chance I could get in (and I admit, one of my co-workers was being a bit sassy to one of the bouncers). Mind you, we all started off being nice and I kindly asked if I just could go in and see my friend to let her know we were outside waiting.\n\nAfter waiting a while and watching 5 people walk out, I asked the bouncers a few times why we couldn't get in and did not receive a proper response, which was: \"We are over capacity right now. I just let in a group of 30 people. Once they are done getting their drinks we can let you in.\" That just doesn't make sense. We still were not let in.\n\nAt this point I was upset and emotional because for me, it's important that I show up for events like one's birthday, and some bouncer was not letting me do this for no good reason. I start to cry because I'm half thinking, maybe now he'll let me and my boyfriend in, and half because I'm truly upset.\n\nWe still do not get in. A cab pulls up with two people inside. I tell my boyfriend we need to go because now I'm too upset to celebrate and clearly the bouncer is not letting us in. As I walk to the cab, one of the bouncers says to me only, \"You are too drunk to get in anyway.\" And then he lets the two people who got out of the cab into the bar right away. No one has ever said this to me. It was like a dagger to the heart. I pride myself on my alcohol consumption because I don't know anyone with better control. I have about 5 days a year where I am hung-over. I confess I was drinking at my work event, but I was not drunk, nor was I slurring my words or falling over. Not once did I call either bouncer a name or yell at them. Ask any of my friends and I am not an angry or mean spirited person by nature, sober or intoxicated.\n\nI get in the cab and go home with my boyfriend. While in the cab my friend inside the bar calls me and said the bouncer came up to her and the birthday girl as they were walking out to see me (I had texted them previously, but it took them a while to look at their phones... I do not have friends who are constantly looking at their phones when out, so I did not expect them to come out right away). He told my friend I would get in if I came back, he's sorry and if he had known I was with her group he would have let me in. I'm like, WTF? No way. I already told him we were with a birthday group inside and I was too upset... I have never had such a demeaning experience on behalf of someone's own ego.\n\nI was supposed to be celebrating my good girlfriend's birthday with her and her husband and friends who were all inside. I was denied this because someone wanted to have a power trip.\n\nSo I just wanted to say: thank you 15 Romolo bouncer dude who has slicked back hair (or oily), smokes and has a smaller build than the other bouncer guy from Friday night. Thanks for such a memorable, horrible night with 15 Romolo. You made me miss my friend's birthday celebration and left a bad impression on behalf of 15 Romolo.\n\n*I apologize for this long review but I wanted people to understand where I was coming from.

Downsides: the servers here are not very nice.  They act completely disinterested in helping customers, and are too absorbed in what i can only guess are their own extremely fascinating lives to pay attention to when a person needs a refreshed Pimm's.

Located in the middle of North Beach's strip club garishness, it manages to avoid that whole vibe and attracts those who enjoy great jukebox, darkened lighting, and well-mixed drinks. To find it you have to go up Romolo alley and look for Basque hotel sign, and the bar is right under it. This place is owned by the same people as Rye and A16 and it shows in the selection of spirits and decor.\n\nI had my 1-year-in-SF anniversary party here and had a great time. The only downsides were the too-loud band that played for over an hour - but I'm told it's not a regular occurrence, and the bartender who seemed to ignore 3 of my hot female friends for over 15 minutes. The memorable drinks for me were Pixie, Sazerac (mixed very well), and the infamous Bunny Fuzz that gave much joy (and much hangover) to a lot of my friends. Seriously, don't judge the drink by the name (or color).\n\nI will definitely come back to 15 Romolo, and hopefully this time the bartenders will figure out how to serve people in order.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

The drinks are reasonably priced for North Beach, dancing is an option, but not required and there are big booths for friends to hang out a shoot the shiz. \nI pretty much detest going out on Broadway, but would definitely make an exception to go out at Romolo again.

Where I'm from, the bartenders don't get too creative, but this place has some pretty wild drinks that taste great too. I'm also sure they could fix you anything you ask since they have to stock a wide variety of liquor and liqueur just to make the drinks on the menu. We also sampled their fries which were spectacular dipped in the curry ketchup. As far as drinks go, I recommend the Black Irish Flip. Its the best way to introduce raw eggs into your bar going experience.\nAs far as this rose's thorns, there are three that come to mind. You should be prepared to spend some money; the price you pay for some super creative drinks. Second, I wish they opened a little earlier, it would be nice to hit this place for lunch and a couple drinks then continue roaming the city. Lastly, It isn't the biggest place (though bars in SF tend to be smaller compared to Detroit) so it might be harder to maneuver if it gets crowded at night.", "author": "Jake S."}

We both had eaten dinner but we had the fried cauliflower for a snack, and though it was good, it wasn't anything special. The one downfall was that the bartender charged us the premium for every cocktail so we walked out a little poorer.

Because the Sage Meyer Lemon Press, which may or may not be still on the menu but was one of the best cocktails I've ever had, each of the five (5) times I had it. Because, as implied/alluded to in the previous sentence, they actually change their cocktail menu, testament to one of my earlier laudatory statements, the one about caring about cocktails. Because they have a damn good bourbon selection. Because they also have good food, which is totally not necessary but which they totally went ahead and did, anyway (see what I mean about caring?). Because they use dark wood and they keep the place dim and their lights are these beautiful little filamenty bulbs, all different shapes and plinging in clusters in scattered directions, and I'm sure it's nowhere close to energy efficient, but goddamit, sometimes beauty has to take precedence. Because they don't have a tv, or didn't the last time I checked, and because their jukebox, though often too loud, is pretty much full with really passable music, though not quite as good as the Summer Place's, what with its early Zeppelin and Fleetwood Mac and what have you. \n\nBut yeah, go on an off-night. Bring a book. Ask the bartender how he's doing, and if he's been experimenting with anything new lately.

Suddenly I had an oasis in Little Italy. A place that didn't have people elbow to elbow trying not to sweat on each other.  I walked down, met the folks I saw standing outside...they were very nice and friendly, I called my friends on the cell phone and told them to come meet me under the Condor sign. They complained loudly as they walked down from Amate. \n\"Why do we have to go all the way down there?\"  \"We only just got our drinks and it was less than 20 minutes this time!\",  they said\n\nI led them past the entrance their contorted confused faces blossomed into pure unadulterated joy. I think 1 or 2 actually wept at the sight of an unoccupied couch at 10PM on a Friday night and a bartender waiting to take an order. I distinctly remember 2 of my girl/friends looking at my crotch there after, and a couple of the guys quickly brushing their lips on my posterior in a nonchalant - bend down to tie my shoe -  sort of way because they felt so indebted to this great discovery I had shared with them.

Anyway, the drinks were good (I got drunk, so they met my needs) but the staff basically ate dinner out of take out boxes while we sat at our table and waited for service (reminder: we were the only people in the bar), so we had to go up to the bar each time to order drinks.

Muahahahah!\n2) Nice Beer Selection. Belgian Beers. Yes Please. They even come in those snazzy goblet-style glasses. Which are deceptively heavy so they don't fall over when one of your friends remembers they took Tae Kwon Do when they were seven and wants to show off their moves. \n3) If you get there early, you get a seat.
