Second of all, people really were making out here and I arrived fairly early, around 9 pm on a Saturday. Congratulations to all of you folks out there getting that lip.\n\nAnyway, I loved the atmosphere here and all of the attention to detail when it comes to decor, right down to the dresser onstage that serves as a turn table for whoever is in charge of music for the evening. The alcohol is pretty fairly priced here as well, though it is CASH ONLY which stresses me out a little bit, but that's no one's issue but my own. If you're in the area, definitely check this place out, because it's definitely unique.\n\nThanks, bye!!!!!", "author": "Anna K."}

Its a great spot to grab beer, dance or hang out and see one of their many events.\nI came here specifically to see a stand up comedy, One Night Stand. \n\nI think when there is an event you def have to pay for tickets. My friend got me tickets ahead of time incase they sell out.\n\nThe event was lively and even audience volunteered to share their One Night Stand stories. \n\nI really enjoyed their decorations. A fun disco ball hanging from a top shined on people in the room. Sparkly confetti was hanging everywhere too. It really did remind me of 90s dance house. As a kid thats how i used to decorate my room or house whenever you were having a sleepover and wanted to dance. It def brought out a fun inner child out of me.

It was probably one of the first bars I visited after moving to SF several years ago and going there now it still feels basically the same (which is a good thing!)\n\nMy favorite part of the bar is just the overall feel and look. From the decorations hanging from the ceiling to the seating along the wall, to the small dj area on the stage, it's welcoming and uniquely its own. \n\nSpeaking of the dj area, I also appreciate the many weekday happy hour sets playing indiepop, britpop, glam, 60s, etc. Weekdays are already the best time to go here as weekends are insanely crowded (plight of the Mission), but the awesome dj sets make it even more worth while. Archive Fever, Cool as F**k, and Rock and Roll Workshop are all worth checking out. \n\nAs for the drinks, I'm a beer person, and while I wouldn't say the selection is out of this world, the variety is decent and there's usually a couple very drinkable choices available. The one major downside, though, is that they only do cash. I get that there are a variety of reasons why a bar might go this route (and this does seem to be a thing for some of the older places in SF), but I don't ever carry cash so I have to go out of my way to get some out before going to MOR. Would absolutely end up spending more if I wasn't capped by however much I took out of the cash machine. \n\nNonetheless, glad that there are still places in SF like Make-out Room, and hope their doors will stay open for many years to come.", "author": "Jon T."}

Think thinking to yourself that you won't drink anymore, and then having your drunkass friends handing you another redbull vodka and toasting to all the best times in life. Think drinking that last drink and knowing that you're blasted, and watching your friend pass out on the couch.\n\nDrinks are good - the dive bar drinks that is.

Both times I've came I believe my group and I have probably been the youngest ones there (we're in our early 20s) but that did not matter. \n\nTo me it seems as if there's not a lot of dirty dancing here, like grinding. My friends and I were probably the ones that we're getting a little too wild, but honestly everyone enjoys it. We're all just trying to have a good time.\n\nThe only thing that was kind of annoying was someone threw a beer can up in the air and it hit me on my head and spilled on the girl next to me.

Not to be missed are the Tuesday night Slow Jams party with Primo and Lucky (San Francisco's best oldies DJs), the Thursday night Web of Sound party with Jackie Sugarlumps (San Francisco's best 60's garage DJ) and the Friday night 2000's party Last Nite (some of San Francisco's best indie DJs.)\n\nGo for the happy hour, stay for the show.  Leave a nice review as well.  We don't have many real places left and this is one of them.", "author": "James G."}

The dance floor wasn't as big but it drew a large crowd in. There was no line when we came but as we came out for fresh air throughout the night, the line outside to get in was getting longer and longer. \n\nThe only complaint I have was that it felt so suffocating while dancing. I felt no type of circulation in that place at all. Can't say much for the bathrooms since I didn't use it but it seemed pretty inconvenient that the men's bathroom door was right across from the bar and every time someone came out a whiff of bathroom stench would wafer out to whoever was standing near it. \n\n4 stars for cheap drinks, good music, and interesting choice of decoration.", "author": "Cathy N."}

Odd name aside this is actually a great little bar with a dance floor. It's not really a night club but given the size of it, that is a good thing. They don't try to do too much with their location which I appreciate. \n\nLocated in the Mission this place can get lost in the outskirts of it much more popular brethren but the fact that it isn't too packed can be a good thing. The place oddly enough is more of a salsa joint than a dance club though they do have different theme nights. \n\nWhat I loved about this place is that people actually danced here. One of the few places in the city that I have actually seen that happen without provocation. The women that were there were attractive and genuinely wanted to try out their salsa moves with each other or the guys that were there. I came with a date so I didn't get to experience this myself but my date and I danced for a while without ever bumping into other couples and had a great time. There are some Salsa pros who seem to take advantage of the fact that there are so many women looking to dance and they lurk the dance floor looking for partners. But its not a creepy way much like the old country dance clubs I used to go to in Texas the guys here actually have skills on the dance floor and if you don't you will be bumped out pretty quickly. \n\nWe made it there before the line and cover charge started but it doesn't seem to expensive. The bar is one the left as you enter and is pretty long and easy access to the bartenders who seemed super nice. They have some great classic drink combinations which I appreciate but this is the mission so if you aren't eccentric and old school you probably aren't getting business. The dance floor is actually pretty large and located in the back of the establishment. The DJ booth is located up on a stage above the dance floor with seating around the dance floor if you are tired and want to watch others get down. \n\nBe warned there are some really good people there so if you get embarrassed easily don't go out there. They will be swinging each other and spinning in circles you could even imagine. \n\nI did make out in the make out room but I did it because i wanted to say I had.

I definitely preferred this drink.\n- coronas (in a can): LOL I read the menu which says \"in a can\" but my mind didn't process it, and I still expected bottles. It's all good; they still gave us little lime slices to push into the cans.\n\nBartenders were chill, a bit busy to tend to everyone promptly, but ok.

Loved the show but not the \"staff\" cleaning up afterwards..\n\nRight after the show the host of the show came over to offer us different chairs to sit on (there were foldable chairs for the show) and we took them and continued our conversation. A few minutes later a man cleaning the floors came over to tell us to move the chairs to the table area when we were done, in a very abrupt, rude manner, and we assured him we would when we were done (as it was quite empty and not an immediate need).\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, the cleaner came back over and instructed us to get up \"now\" \"right now\" so he could finish his job. I told him we would move them when we were done and that he didn't need to be so rude in asking- we weren't actually inconveniencing anyone. He completely shut me down and made me feel like a jerk, when it was very inappropriate to do so. I mean, really?! We are capable of moving TWO chairs 15 feet away. He insisted and practically used physical force (no joke) to remove me and my friend who had not been there to hear his previous request. I told him that I was sorry for holding up his job, and we got up, and he continued to talk to us in a very demeaning manner. \n\nAfter the confrontation, I watched the interactions and noticed that someone at the bar gave money to the cleaner and the bartender gave him a beer. After a bit, I approached the person at the bar who gave this cleaner money, and when I told him the situation he replied that he had only given the cleaner  \"a dollar\" and could not change the cleaner's behavior. \n\nAfter telling the person who I am assuming is the manager about this situation, he basically told me that he could do nothing and that my patronage  was not important (regardless of me and my friends all being long time customers of 3+ years and paying for many shows). \n\nSo yes, Mr. Manager, I will be telling everyone I know NOT to go to your bar, and that you obviously do not value your customers in the slightest.\n\nSad, but I'm over it.

They are all \"you had to be there\"  stories, but hopefully I can transcribe them so you can all be in on it too. I just care that much about you(s).\n\nThe whole look and feel was of an 80's slash not really out of the 70's quite yet prom-y thing. It had glitter, awesome lampshades, a big hook thing that must have held at least 30 bras (I would have taken mine off to add to the pile but I was wearing my favorite one and cost me 50 bucks  from VS..soo...yah no.) The layout wasn't TOO astechically (yeah, the spellings off..bite me) pleasing, but there was a stage with a band that night (THANK YOU KEANE!!), and chairs surrounding so it was all good. We stood at the bar and listened to the band, I ended up in a \"WOOO!\"-ing contest with some random person, and some crazy random guy pushed my head into my dates when we were going to kiss. Talk about another awkward situation! (How are we still dating? That is strange to me.)\n\nThe band asked about what kind of jobs we held, and I, being my father's daughter wanted to make a presence for myself, screamed \"PAPERBITCH!\". I meant receptionist, but no one would have listened to that!\n\nThe place really lives up to its name. I saw a bunch of couples makeout, and two cute guys were getting all flirty and close to each other and FINALLY one of them made a move and kissed him. It was the cutest thing I have ever seen!

Spotlights illumined the art work, such as a glowing owl at twilight, a bear skin, a circular sheep diptych, and smiling creatures with snail antennas and faces but the bodies of cats.

At first I just thought it was a bar but then I began to hear music from it. Up until last night, I didn't find a reason to go since none of my usual friends want to even hang out in the Mission. That was until I started making friends who lived in the Mission. Funny... when I lived in the Mission, I never hung out there, but now that I've left, I've hung out there more times in the four and a half years I've lived elsewhere than any other time when I lived at home (and didn't involve eating out with family.)\n\nSo my friend invites me to the Seaweed Sway Showcase that was held here last night. I told my dad where I was going and he said, \"Oh, you mean that place with all the dorky white people in front of it?\" I said yes. Oh, the shit my dad says. He DID say that the crowd always looks harmless and that they're just out from their geeky jobs just to have a fun time, so he said it all just for laughs.\n\nThe show itself was pretty cool. I was with good company, so I had a great time. The beer was cheap and since they don't serve food, you can bring in a burrito or pizza or anything else from nearby establishments. The bartender was friendly and attentive and overall, I didn't feel uncomfortable like I do in most bars.\n\nThe decoration of this place is pretty bizarre, but that's what gives the place charm. Everything from the disco ball to the alien paintings on the walls to the really cool two-leveled stage... I really dug it. I didn't feel crowded or get claustrophobic since it was on a Sunday (during the Treasure Island Music Festival, a Giants playoff game, with not-so-pleasant weather.)\n\nI really dug this place.

I think it's kitschy and cute, some other reviewers think *very* differently about it, obviously (see below).\n\nThe place was packed pretty damn tight, but the bartenders were on it as far as I'm concerned.

Nice work!  Oh!  And I remember, their well bourbon is Jim Beam and I got a double on the rock for $6.  I think.  Must've been happy hour.\n\nI am knocking off a star because at around 10:30 or so, after the bands had wrapped up, we went across the street to Escape from NY pizza (everyone who knows about my diet:  shut up) and by the time we came back, the DJ still hadn't gotten it together.

The bartenders have always been really cool to me, but I've only ordered PBRs and I tip well; however, my fellow patrons seem to order lots of margaritas and other time-consuming drinks, so I probably serve as a bit of relief.\r\n\r\nOkay, so the actual event: \"Mortified\" is a reading of sorts, but not in an embarrassing sense--ok, it *is* embarrassing, but that's the point. You see, a group of people, who have auditioned and interviewed with the creators, choose a series of journal entries or poems written while the writer was a kid. As a result, the audience listens to \"adults\" read their deepest, darkest, and most sordid secrets from their teenage/junior high years. The results are absolutely hilarious and, in a perverse way, comforting (you realize you maybe weren't so weird or such a fuck up as a 15-year-old). Afterward, it's fun to compare who related to what with your friends.\r\n\r\nIt's 12 bucks to get in, which is a bit steep for old cheapie stewart here, but totally worth it. The crowd is generally pretty douchey, but if everyone's responsive, loud, and encouraging then it doesn't matter (unless everyone's unresponsive, quiet, and un-encouraging, then it can be lame).

My friend and I got here when it was pretty dead, which enabled us to have a fun zephyr-themed conversation with the bartender. It covered the following: greek gods, Amtrak, a comparative analysis of plane vs. train travel, the central location of most train stations in major cities, getting stranded in Iowa, the wisdom of accepting a ride from a random stranger in Iowa, unusual baby names, popular baby names, and whether it's a good idea to name your kid something that will be redundant to the names of 10 other kids in your kid's class.  Then we saw our friend's band play, and they were great.\n\nOf course, this is a very specific experience unlikely to be replicated.  Ever.  So I'll give the Make-Out Room four stars based on coziness, the name, and the fact that they have a drink called the zephyr.

My roommate and I lovingly refer to this incident simply as \"Did you want to go to Tuesday tonight?\" That's how serious we are about this routine. The music is amazing. The bartender is a sweetheart - attentive and fast. I only order beer (and they've got a decent selection), but from the looks of things she pours pretty heavy-handed.\n\nWe come in around 9:30, can still score a cheap pitcher (happy hour lasts until 10!), and we snag a booth and just listen to the music. The middle school dance decor is honestly just adorable.\n\nMy non-Tuesday experiences are also fantastic, but I don't think they're terribly indicative of a typical Make Out Room night either. One Wednesday not too long after the roommate and I moved here, we decided to drop in for a cheap beer. There was one other person in the bar. The bartender was great to us - as soon as we mentioned that we were fairly new to town, he introduced us to some of his friends, gave us recommendations on other places to go, and bought us each a shot. Such a great night. He was super attentive to us even though it eventually got busier.\n\nWe stopped in on another random night where there was a cover on a supposedly non-cover night. When we said that we honestly just wanted to grab a pitcher and didn't care about the show (which was true - it was some kind of awful stand up show), the doorman was kind enough to let us in without a cover if we sat right by the front. We had our one pitcher, sat at the two bar seats closest to the door and thanked the guy as we headed out. We really did just want a couple beers and an opportunity to sit and chat.\n\nEven on inaguration night, when Tuesday was packed, we still got quick service. The crowd was a little much for me, but hey. Everyone was out celebrating - we knew what we were in for. Any time friends are in town over a tuesday, I love to bring them here.

There is a narrow part when you first enter the bar - the bar itself being on the left and a few booths on your right.  It can be a bit crowded here.  But, then the place opens up quite a bit towards the back.  \n\nThe place is dark.  As a dive bar should be.  The decor is ok.  There is a lot of red and black, if I recall.  These are good colors and the staples of any decent dive bar.  \n\nHowever, there is a disco ball and all this sparkly, Christmas-y tinsel and shit hanging from the ceiling that makes it look like you are at some cheesy-ass wedding, high-school prom, or that work xmas party where you banged your co-worker and the gossip about your faux pas was still going strong into January and you had to resign.   \n\nThese \"decorations\" need to be ripped down, preferably by a powerful, rated-for-industrial-use 10hp weed-eater, and deposited in the nearest dumpster.  Moreover, some of the things hanging down from the ceiling look exactly like fly paper.  Really.  They even curl up at the ends just like fly paper does.  And that, my friends, is simply disgusting.\n\nOn a positive note, the bartenders are skilled and I don't recall ever having to wait long for my Sierras (revisiting the beer thing again, I was secretly glad I was \"forced\" to drink Sierras last night because I *wanted* to get sloshed in order to somehow derive some entertainment from the show, my surroundings, my date, or even the random stupid little thoughts in my head).\n\nI hear there are some good DJs, bands, etc. here and it probably would be a good place for that because of the large open area in the back.  \n\nNonetheless, strictly as a bar, to go and drink, it is not someplace I would head to.  Mostly because of the flypaper and Christmas-y decorations (did I tell you I H8 xmas?  Yes, I absolutely do).  \n\nPoints for darkness and good service though.\n\n2 and 1/2 stars.", "author": "David M."}

(help me, please!) so we wandered in somewhat randomly one night. we were impressed with the rotating djs with live drum accompaniment at first. some jackson 5, some grandmaster flash, but THEN:\n\nthe dj started spinning staxx singles with bowie bass lines mixed in. and it worked. song after song--from memphis to muscle shoals to atlantic in new york to detroit. it was like being on my porch with a live drummer. mind blowing.\n\ni've been back continually since that night, although the music has yet to equal it in quality. they definitely mix in a lot of the typical top 40 dance hits you can hear anywhere, but they also play some good hip hop and the fore-mentioned blends.\n\nbartenders here are really, really nice. (i've started to make friends with one.) pours are solid to debilitating.\n\nthe fairly sparse clientele is a mix of very low-key, mostly older, dedicated regulars, dykes (who always know how to dance), mission hipsters of the dorky variety (who sometimes know how to dance, if they're girls, and never know how to dance but do anyway with great and shameless enthusiasm, if they're boys). And of course there's a semi-regular invasion of bridge-and-tunnel types, who never know how to dance, or else specialize solely in the white-girl-whole-body-shake. come on. you know exactly what i mean.\n\nstraight guys are rarely overly aggressive, but rather prefer the \"i'm going to just stand here passively near you while you dance because i would like to dance with you, or at least take you home, but i'm a hipster betamale and so will never make the first move until you've really, really demonstrated some interest\" routine. herding mentality rules, but that works out in some unexpectedly pleasant ways:\n\nthis place never gets crowded to capacity. which means that when the bar area is crowded, the dance floor is empty. all for me.  when the dance floor is filling up, the surrounding tables and bar are empty. for me.  mostly it's all pretty empty, which is another reason i come.  \n\nand the bartenders are really, really nice. also, the nice guy i used to see at my old video store comes here to play pool. that has to be a good sign.", "author": "jen s."}

If I go out alone, I tend to not go out really late like 1 am. It's a new york/nJ thing.  So, the theme was dress in your underwear. Well, when in Rome!! I was looking for a bathroom to change at, but then change to get in my underwear sounded really weird.  So, no one cared, and really wearing underwear is no different than boxers which is no different than shorts.  \n\nI had to catch up on my drinking to be fun, and I had two LI tea's. No one ever know what LI tea stands for, but I cant help it out of habit, it's Long Island Iced Tea. I went to college in long island my first two years before transferring to south carolina. Good move!\n\nAnyway, you know how you bump into someone by accident, this girl thought I was hitting on her, and gave me a mean look. I am like your a bitch. So, she told her boyfriend, he told me to apologize in a bouncer type of way. Which I of course, would not.  So, he told me to leave. I am like the best I can do is walk five feet away. He said leave again.  Now, I am definitely staying. I have not been in a fight well a real fight, in 20 years I bet. But, I dont back down and my review has nothing to do with this isolated incident which could have happened at any bar. . \n\nThe people at make out room are to alternative for me. I was hoping with the name it would be sexy, cool. As for seeing girls in underwear, there werent that many like 20. I didnt even get turned on, it's just not my scene.\n\nThe worst part is I am losing my tolerance to drink. I actually had a hang over from 2 drinks which is so disappointing, but then again saves a lot of money from the normal 5 to 7. Then, I cant find the clip or sensor to get into my apartment 3 weeks later. I am like where would a drunk person through his keys? Yet, I cant pay my apartment $50 for the new sensor.", "author": "Andrew K."}

Bartenders are really nice, the doorpeople mostly are, though the Saturday night guy is a jerk. \nThe real bummers though are the soundguy and the matinee show/DJ late night deal. Stupid. \nIf you want to be a DJ place then stop hosting live music and rushing early shows. As soon as the last band was done, the bouncer started moving all the tables, including ours that was full of people and drinks, and rudely says \"this is gonna be a dancefloor, move your drinks\". I am at a table with three sweet smiling lovely girls, and you're a rude jerk? \nThe WORST part, the soundman, who was apparently in some mildly popular indie band in the 18th century, yikes. Either he sucks at sound, or doesn't care, or both. He is also rude to musicians when he feels like it. Totally unprofessional and ruins the vibe for the band, which messes up the music, then the whole night. Crappy soundman domino effect.\nAnother crappy music venue further hollowing out an already hollowed out music scene. Thanks MO Room.\nOh, and no one wants to make out in there, not romantic, sexy or appealing. Seriously, if you like rude crappy staff at your dive bars, this is the place for you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-11", "description": "I've been to the Make-Out room, and I have yet to see anyone of a decent caliber making out there. I find this disappointing. I also find the bar itself to be a bit disappointing, for every time I go there, I usually end up annoyed in some way. The space itself is not bad, nice bar with dusty deer heads above, though the dusty streamers everywhere look a bit drab and lazy. Think, \"post-apocalypse prom night in a bar\". It is a typical bar/club, with the bar upfront, and the dance area/concert floor in the back. I have admittedly never seen a show there, but I have seen several random DJ sets there, nothing to write home to Mom about. \n\nI guess the thing that annoys me about the Make-Out room is the staff. In particular, the male bartender is pretty gruff (NO ENERGY DRINKS!) and one of the female bartenders there seems to hate you, even though she has never met you. I guess I came from work one time, and I wasn't dressed \"hipster enough\" or something, dressed in business casual. I swear to you that after she took my drink order, and after scoffing at how long it was taking me (all of 20 seconds to order for 5 people), I could swear she said something like \"Somethin, somethin, f-cking yuppie...\"  I didn't call her out on it, but I wish I did. I'm not 100% sure that is what she said either, but I am about 95% sure. I brushed it off and listened to the sub-par DJ, and then went to the half-empty dance floor feeling somewhat tainted for the night. I'm not even really a yuppie... well, maybe a little, but still... the music, every time I have been has been cookie-cuter house/electronica, or recent rap hits, neither of which I am too keen on.  \n\nSo, I go again, this time a month or two later (dressed in my normal, non-work clothes this time), and that same bartender was a bi.... was not nice again! Apparently because she has control of the alcohol, she gets to be rude to the customers. I ordered back-to-back drinks, and she scolded me for not ordering \"all at once\". Well... I wasn't finished with my drink 5 minutes ago, sorry. Fine then. You don't want my business. I'll take my friends elsewhere.\n\nI'm sure its just her and her holier-than-thou-I'm-a-San-Francisco-hipster attitude that turned me off to the place, but you know what? The place wasn't that great to begin with. It's dusty, dim, with sub-par music (when I was there), though the drinks were fine. I've been there 4-5 times total, and each time I walk away thinking \"meh\"... \n\nIf you're in the area, swing by and see for yourself.

Contextual abandonment would imply foreplay, neither wearing anything but a selection of finely considered undergarments. The room wears one hundred strong, skinny and sullen frowns - these kids weren't built to last. A pant-check is set up in the back corner, an assortment of blue jeans draping over its wrack. The red haired boy stands sideways with his Gothic love, her with the wanton display of arse. Big brutish bellowing flesh does its own dance, courteously abandoning her own bent leg trounce. Tongue-out lackeyed boys with sunken ambitions scurry around her orbit, bounding hands to her own - she simmers in their attention, eyes forever fixed on her red haired boy. He tells her he can never love her. His sentence neglecting conclusion. He can never love her enough.", "author": "Marc M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-25", "description": "they charged a cover, which was a bad start because covers in general are irksome to me and in retrospect it was in no way worth it. (and it wasn't even a live band.) i had fun because i brought a lot of friends, some of whom are good dancers and also find joy, as i do, in getting up on the stage after a few house drinks and demonstrating their ridiculous multi-cultural dance moves. as for the music, half of it was great, half of it was a parody of saturday night fever - style mariachi. and many of the transitions were awkward and disjunct. i did, however, enjoy the decorations hanging from the ceiling. the drink menu was different, although one drink a friend was trying to foist on me was a syrupy mess. (i hate too-sweet drinks.) in case you're like me, be sure to ask the bartender about the drinks because many of the names are ambiguous. the end.", "author": "Josie K."}
