Titled 'The Playbook' written by one Barney Stinson, the tome was filled with pages and pages of brilliant dating advice. After browsing through chapters such as 'The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn', 'The Scuba Diver', and 'The Robin', I saw a Play that completely captured my imagination:\n\n--\n\n\"The Jill in the Box\"\n\n1. Find yourself at Would You Believe on Dollar Shot Thursdays. Wear a college sweater from the Southern States, preferably one that no one has heard about. It will make all your odd comments and actions later seem somehow unfamiliarly appropriate. \n\n2. Look for a girl in a Lupe sweater, as this would indicate that she can handle her Food & Liquor. Offer to buy her a shot. Keep to the $1 menu, of course.\n\n3. Pretend to listen to her problems about her midterm anxieties, her passive aggressive sorority sister, and her boyfriend that never was (who is probably just eight paces away). Mistakenly call her 'Jill' several times while you pretend to console her.\n\n4. Steer the conversation away to drunk munchies. Mention how you sorely miss the East Coast Mom & Pops diner back from home. Take 2 more shots to avoid her look of incredulity when you tell her that the diner is Jack in the Box.\n\n5. Feign a wave of astonishment when she shows you that Jack in the Box is just across the street. Insist that you must take her out for drunk munchies for this revelation.\n\n6. Purchase two $6 munchie box (Spicy Chicken Nacho, Chicken Tater Melt). Insist on paying for both, to which she would most assuredly say, \"Then please let me get the next one.\" Subtly mention that you have not yet tried The House of Prime Rib approximately 3 minutes later.\n\n7. Make up some story about how you and your first love, Jill, used to share Curly Fries all the time, that is until she died an untimely death. Tell the girl that you only bought her a drink because she looks just like Jill and it reminded you too much of your early romance. Apologize and offer to leave. Don't leave. Suck on the jalapenos from the Spicy Chicken Nacho sandwich until you can force a tear. If you fail, a streak of Dr. Pepper down your cheek will have to suffice.\n\n8. Seeing that you're a sensitive gentleman (make sure to still solemnly finish that very delicious burger), she can't help but develop some feelings for you. Allow her to console you, preferably at her place. Never be the one to call the Lyft. It's surge pricing.\n\n--", "author": "Ringo M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-01-01", "description": "Surprising! Or is it?  It still is American fast food business. I had gotten violently ill off of their competition as I call them with my 'Nome de plume' McDiarrhoea. Four times I had gotten food poisoning (or some gastro enteric allergic reaction from chancing Micky D. Three in San Francisco (two at Haight and Stanyan location alone) and one in southern California -- my first initial reaction - somewhere in Riverside. (All within California).\n\nBut this was first at one of their competition, Jack in the Box Inc. that I wound up sustaining a similar scenario.\n\nIt was late, I was out on Geary Blvd, when I was looking for something still open. I found Robert Oscar Peterson's Jack in the Box. I went in and ordered their premium burger 'Hella Pe\u00f1o Munchie Meal'.  It did not take very long and the next moment, I sat down as it was late and not crowded.  Admittedly, it tasted quite good. I was pleased... until...uh...\n\nI left and was going to walk home as I lived only ten streets east from there. So I walked to Anza, the next road south from Geary Blvd.  I got to Anza and turned left and half way down the block, I suddenly felt weird. My stomach was in knots and offering me pain. I felt nauseous, and a moment later as I only had gotten worse, I up-chucked it all up and out of me. After moving along still feeling quite listless and malaise, I threw up again with less content.\n\nI continued on until I got to Second Avenue, when I made a right turn (south towards Balboa St.). Immediately I got this VERY strong abdominal pain and thought I was going to burst!  I was scared and thoughts of ER time were nigh. Then I felt a 'shifting' down there in my lower gut, and suddenly realised that I had to find a toilet ASAP or PDQ! I had a full block and half yet to go before getting back home, but my gut would not make it!\n\nThen the worst case scenario had become reality: I had experienced a forced defecation of this hot lava that shot out into my clothes and onto the pavement!  I indeed had a diarrhoea accident -- just a block and a half from where I lived! It was stinky, stinging as it pulled at my skin trapped in my clothing, well... I shall spare you the full details, but just to say that I was one stinking foul mess!  FORTUNATELY save but some street lighting, it was after sundown, so I was not so visible.\n\nI got home and called 911 and asked for medical advice. They asked if I needed an ambulance team to come out, but I declined the ambulance but they did come out to check me out. Fortunately I was okay and was found that I was in no need of going to ER.  I was told that I was sustaining a moderate to severe reaction to food poisoning but that since I vomited, most of the toxins were out of me (same as the 'other route' as well).\n\nI only illustrate this as to show the gravity of these corporate fast food places.  After my little incident that evening, I feel it is only fair and my responsibility to warn others of patronising either McDonalds or now Jack in the Box as well. The food is of very low standard and practically unsafe!  I am surprised that this has not been reported by now and that the Department of Health of the C&C of San Francisco has not revoked the licences of these irresponsible fast food outlets thus causing episodes of food poisonings in their customers!  (Perhaps a little bit of 'payola' taking place between these corporations and the C&C of San Francisco? I just do not know).\n\nSo PLEASE BEWARE, that by the consumption of fast food from these leading corporations such as McDonalds and Jack in the Box, is now VERY chancy and at high risk! Unless you don't mind experiencing sudden and urgent vomiting and diarrhoea, if I were you, as San Francisco has over 3'000 restaurants to choose from, to PLEASE find alternatives to fast food!\n\nThank you kindly!", "author": "Tatsuhiro S."}

After a couple minutes of convincing the workers they should call 911, they eventually did so and he was taken out via ambulance.

As me and my friend, Larry Y., waited in line, the three guys in front of us (all of them higher than a satellite) ordered about $20.00+ of food EACH. The thought alone of that much Jack in the Box made me shiver.. \n\nI realize that when you're drunk or high, and you get the munchies, you're insanely hungry. You want disgusting, greasy, quick food. But the amount of food they ordered bordered on reckless endangerment. As they all walked out with what seemed like grocery bags full of deep fried heart attacks in the making, I just shook my head and tried not to laugh. I knew that they would be regretting it all in the morning..\n\nAnyways, I ordered after them and sat down to eat while Larry Y. tried out their new blackberry milkshake. We both just people watched and tried not to laugh too hard at the public groping, angry homelessness, and drunk conversations we heard. \n\nThe location itself is small, and the parking lot must fit about seven cars total. Why they have two handicap spots within those seven car slots is beyond me.. I don't think anyone in life, especially a handicapped person, is in a rush to park as close as possible to an ensuing stroke called Jack in the Box food.\n\nAs I finished my food and walked out, I was thankful that my tires were still on my car and that I had exited without any fist fights or stab wounds. I tip my cap and my new stomach flab towards the people behind the counter. Despite serving frozen greasy death to the masses, they are very patient with the drunk belligerent people that come in.\n\nOf course I'm exaggerating and joking throughout most of this post, but please save yourself the dignity and calories of coming here.

When you order food here, everything is made to order which is a good thing because it's fresh and can be made to how you like it.\n\nDuring rush hour, it may not be so good.  \n\nOne time I was working as a cook along side the manager.  I dropped one of the burger breads on the floor.  Right when I picked it up to throw away, the manager said throw in on the grill.  The customers won't know.  That grossed me out.  \n\nAnother time, I was working at the front.  During busy hours, there are usually a bunch of workers in the front, including the cashiers, forfilling orders when they're not taking order.  They usually look at the receipts or monitors to see what they need to pack up.  Often times, sodas are filled and too many cups are filled and not used.  Then I see one of the managers taking the extra cups of soda to the side, opening up the lid, and tasting the soda to see what flavor it was.  Then putting the lid back on, and punching the soda indicator buttons on the lids to say what it was.  That also grossed me out.  I know they let customers fill their own soda now because the fountain drinks are up front for customers to fill themselves.  But keep in mind, the same managers who I use to work with are still working there.  If they don't care about burger buns that fell on the greasy floor to be used again, or tasting what they are serving, who knows what they're doing today.\n\nAlso, extra burgers that are cooked can only stay in the warmer for 15 minutes.  They usually stick a sticker on the burger wrapper with the number on it.  Numbers are 1 thru 12 representing the numbers on the clock.  If they cooked a extra burger at say, 12:05, they will attached a sticker with the number \"4\" on the burger wrapper.  Which means that burger can remain on the heater until 12:20.  Get this... I've seen cooks pull out the stickers and repackaging the burger for their customers.  Just to get orders out quicker.  Another time, a manager took a cooked cheese burger (jumbo jack with cheese) from the warmer that expired, scrapped off some cheese, and repackaged it back as a regular hambuger without the cheese.  Just to saw time because it would take another 5 minutes to cook up a burger patty.  Gross.  Only managers would do stuff like that to save a dime.\n\nI don't have anything against Jack in the Box.

Now if the SFPD was smart they'd put a squad car here at midnight..because only after you've finished drinking your 5th pint does a couple of Jumbo Jack with extra mayo and with the burger drowned in ketchup actually sound tasty.  \n\nI remember when I used to come here late at night. It's like a rainbow coalition meeting. You have your clubbers, pub crawlers, homeless and 3rd shifters getting their Jack on. Since the inside is small we were all elbow to elbow forced into a temporary bonding moment that even would make Martin Luther King smile as he watched his dream come true.\n\nBut that dream was crushed as they have started to lock their doors after 10pm. That's right folks.. you are now limited to ordering through a walk-thru. If you haven't seen the walk-thru it's a contraption that relies on \"The Cube\". where you put your money through. \"The Cube\" protects the employees at Jacks from the hold ups but as long as I remember Jack-n-the-Box carried nasty burgers, fries and tacos... not solid gold bars like at  Fort Knox. \n\nAnyways I'm not sure where I stole the name of \"The Cube\". Maybe it's because the apparatus seems to be more complicated than solving a Rubik's Cube http://www.maniacworld.com/rubikscube.htm. If you haven't tried to order from \"The Cube\" then here's a lesson for you. \n\n1. No need to scream.. they can hear you fine through the speaker. \n2. At some point you will need to give them money.. \"The Cube\" has two doors.. one on your side and one on the cashiers side. You open your side first and slide the money in first and then close the door. \n3. The cashier will then open his door and then take your money. \n4. The cashier will then reopen his door and put your change in \"The Cube\". He then will close his door.\n5. You then open your door and take the change. \n\nI swear to God.. you will screw up this process at least once during the exchange. The cashier will then scream either \"You have to freaking close your door before I can open mine\" or the other is \"Freaking wait until I'm done putting your change through the door before you open yours!\". Consider yourself school'd because after I watched everyone do it the first time even I screwed up \"The Cube\" . \n\nI have almost always had an interesting conversation outside of Jack-n-the-Crack. Crazy drunks getting out of the bars, homeless guys chatting it up for change or dudes who slept in all day who just need something to get them through the night. I even seen a guy gets really pissed as he couldn't figure out \"The Cube\" and ended up pulling at the door to the point I thought he was going to break it. That remind me..perhaps I named the walk-thru device after the 1997 movie \"The Cube\" http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Cube_The_Movie_Poster_Art.jpg.. The tagline to the movie was Paranoia, Desperation, Suspicion and Fear. \n\nThis explains every feeling you'll have eating at the legendary 24hr Jacks\n-You must have decided to eat here out of DESPERATION\n-You'll be PARANOID that they installed \"The Cube\" just to frustrate you and other drunks at 3am. \n-You'll be SUSPICIOUS of the shady characters that hang out at Jacks at 2am. \n-Lastly you'll FEAR having the runs the next morning as you know the extra heaping of mayonnaise doesn't look exactly right and they use the extra ketchup in the burgers to hide the fact that the meat is old and has been sitting there for a few hours.   http://www.marlerclark.com/news/jackbox10.htm", "author": "Dan T."}

Fast food is fast food so I don't have much to say about the quality except I get exactly what I expected - hot burgers and tacos in a flash.

At one time, after 10:00PM, you had to place your order through a window (usually in Spanish). Amusingly enough, I had a multi paragraph unfinished Yelp! review from seven months ago wherein I gave it a 3-star rating, praised this location for its changes in staff and cried out against the sugar-infested smoothies and how I would brave the dangerous Geary/11th Ave. intersection many a drunken night in order to go here. This intersection finally got stoplights a few months ago.\n\nMy latest experience of this places haven't been so good. One of the last times I went here, with a friend, we ordered the Sirloin Mini burgers only to find out they had basically cut up the meat from a Jumbo Jack in 1/4's and gave it to us. Was this because we were using coupons? Then, since I obviously don't learn from my mistakes, I went here again and ordered the mini chicken burgers, and that time the buns had been toasted to a crisp. My roommate also got sick from eating at this location.\n\nFor what you're paying at this Jack in the Box, you could nearly have a gourmet meal in San Francisco.

You'll never fail to see one of these types there at any late night hour.\n\nI'm not going to comment on the food cause i'm sure everyone has had it before.  Typical fast food, hits the spot before you go to bed.  Points for the kind of cool window where you get your food.  If you don't close your side, they can't open their side.  Great protection from thieves and i'm sure the glass is bulletproof.\n\nParking lot is small with about 5 spots.  Since the lot is so tight, you can get into a  few precariously parking mishaps.  My friend's boy hit some other sucka on the bumper but since they were both driving buckets, they both said fuck it and drove away.  Good one.\n\nAlso watch out for Bums who don't even ask you for money.  They just seem to enjoy sitting there and spewing out whatever is on their mind.

The minimal dining area makes for a tight squeeze, with a row of booths lining the wall just a scant 10 feet or so from the takeout counter.  The staff is no friendlier than the usual crew of your average  Jack in the Box, and the food doesn't deviate much from what you'd expect.\n\nOn the other hand, this franchise ain't without it's saving graces. First off, it's got the same \"value menu\" of buck-an-item munchies that have made J.I.T.B franchises the industry leaders in late-night, low-buck nutrition.  Two-for-a-buck tacos make for a quick snack, and several Jumbo Jacks selling for a buck-and-a-quarter each make for a gut-busting bargain that's unparalleled in the fast-food world.  Secondly, it's the only cheap 24-hour burger joint in the city that isn't completely over-run by street urchins, druggies, panhandlers or ne'er-do-wells.  It's just far enough east of the Inner Richmond's nightlife district to be free of it's influences, but close enough to offer walking-distance convenience while still being a peaceful spot to grab some late-night calories.\n\nThe value menu is abound with cheap food, and if you're in the mood to eat with a beer, the Hearth ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/T_1DmtL6KJ6NfKWPBP7OMQ ) is literally 50 feet from the front door.  I've done this combo countless times, and I've never failed to see at least two other instances of Jack-in-the-box bags on the bar.\n\nAny singular blessing this location possesses doesn't by itself doesn't count for much.  But throw all of it's positive traits together and it's chain-store presence seems to be more of a positive attribute to the area than a negative one. It's a 24-hour fast food outlet.  It's in a decent neighborhood, and in close proximity to a nightlife district.  And best of all, it's spitting distance from a neighborhood bar that's take-in friendly.\n\nSo if you're looking to grab a cheap bite in the Inner Richmond and hankering for a cheap beer, don't forget those bargain priced  Jumbo Jacks and the nearby convenience of \"The Hearth\".

I'll also add that I've noticed this type of crowd at most locations I've passed in the city. But it *is* open late night, and that's always a good thing.\n\nFor those who must be new to the Left Coast (the only reason I can think of why you're unfamiliar with this franchise) Jack in the Box is kinda like the way McDonald's or Burger King is the most prolific chain fast food in the rest of the country. But I must say the food is far more delicious than McDonald's and Burger King (perhaps ingredients that are closer to real), and certainly far heartier and filling. The patties and cheese aren't a cartoonishly bright color. And they just come thicker. I do worry about what else goes into it though, as I've noticed that the workers will put your meal together with their bare hands, and the guy who has made mine several times looked as dingy as some of the homeless dudes that hang outside.\n\nInteresting tidbit: a couple of years back Jack-In-The-Box killed about 10 people with e. coli in the burgers. Since then they've made sure to be more careful. While the deaths may make you queasy, rest assured that this time you should be ok.

I am giving this place one star because of the fuck up at the counter today who kept fucking up my order.  At one point he told me he changed the order when I could see on the screen that he didn't.  What a dick!  When I got my food It was still fucked up.  All I wanted was a sirloin bacon cheese burger with no mayo.  Is that too much to ask?", "author": "doug b."}

I mean, I like that they have the breakfast option during lunch, but the quality of the food is not that great. The croissant I got looked nothing like a croissant and those hash brown sticks had an odd taste. The food was also really greasy. Besides the food, basically sat down and eavesdropped on these two ladies who wore plastic bags for shoes and acted all philosophical by making judgments about Greeks, Jews, and even Chinese people. I wasn't exactly offended, but when they said \"Chinese people have no creative spirit,\" I didn't know how to think because creativity is what I'm all about. Maybe I shouldn't have been offended because I American. I might just come back even though the food sucks.", "author": "Alex Y."}

Yes it's fast food, and no, it's not In-N-Out, but whatever.  Curly Fries!  Dip that in some buttermilk house dressing and you're good to go.  I think that would be great if they turned that walk-up window into a drive-through window.  Then I'd give this place 5 stars!", "author": "Tony L."}

They got the goods for the big spender, yet they got the 1 dollar Jumbo Jack. What's your pleasure? I'm supposed to quit fast food, but I find myself getting really hammered across the street and end up here to sober up. Maybe I'm trippin' but everyone who comes here in the later hours is either drunk or high on some $hit. I could be wrong but I see two types of people. The really quiet stoners and the loud drunks. Regardless, we all have found our happy place. It's cool now because you can actually go in and order. Before, we had to wait outside and order through a bullproof window. Those days were fun though. In some weird sort of way, it's like an afterparty. Granted, the place could be a cleaner. They do seem short staffed yet efficient putting out the orders. I'm so glad they take Visa since I'm likely to have no cash if I end up here.", "author": "Butch M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-09", "description": "Thank god for Jack In The Box !! They are open 24hrs . When hardly anything else is open , this is a lifesaver providing fast cheap food . The mozzarella sticks are good .. they put melted mozzarella in it btw which makes it all the tastier . The jumbo jack is good , filling & cheap . The monster taco is only $1 but I didn't really like it .. the inside doesn't really taste that good & it lacks flavor . Soda is cheap .. $1.25 for a regular size . French fries are decent . There is a parking lot as well which is good so finding parking isn't a pain in the ass . The only things I don't like about this Jack In The Box is that the parking lot is almost ALWAYS very dirty which makes me lose my appetite and that there's almost ALWAYS bums here . Last time we came here with two of my friends , we gave him 50 cents but he didn't pick it up . Then he asked for a cigarette and kept talking about how he's drunk & 40 so thats why he don't have a job BLAHBLAHBLAH . So we gave him a cigarette and he just wouldn't leave us alone and kept talking in front of us . But besides those two things , this a good place to go after going to the bar or club . Sometimes this place is open on the inside late at night so you can dine inside but sometimes it's closed so you have to order to go  .", "author": "Eileen L."}
