Awesome trip filled with so many great memories..\n\nThis part was hands down one of my favorite moments. If you have the dexterity and athleticism make a day of it and climb the mountain (it's paved). If you are like me, have someone drive your lazy butt up. The day we went was a 70 degree day but if you know anything about SF it has over 30 different micro climates. My hair was standing straight up from the wind and I could very well have used a sweatshirt and jacket but the views were top notch. It was so quiet and peaceful, like in a movie and I could have stayed up there for hours. So glad I was able to stay in the Castro. Definitely an authentic SF experience  p.s. don't forget to play Scott McKenzie's San Francisco", "author": "Jackie M."}

It offers scenic views of the city.  If you climb it rather than drive, it's also a workout.  I recommend some good shoes, as there are lots of rocks and erosion of the paths leading up to the peaks.  There were a small group of people on both peaks mostly getting selfies.  I enjoyed seeing the sweeping view and looking down on the areas I had already walked and visited as if it were a small model of the city.  Both peaks offer good views.  Highly recommended.

This is a really popular SF viewpoint location due to its prime 360 degree and uninhabited view of the city and not to mention these peaks sit in the geographical center of SF. The northern peak is named \"Eureka\" and the south peak is named \"Noe.\" I only hopped on the northern peak and I was able to see the Golden Gate Bridge, the Transamerica Pyramid, and the Sutro Tower on a clear day. It was so windy that I even had trouble putting my jacket on.\n\nThere are two entry points if you want to take trails up to the peaks (one shortcut at Crestline Dr [you can get here by taking the Muni #37 Corbet Line] and another one at Midcrest Way - http://sfrecpark.org/wp-content/uploads/Twin-Peaks.pdf), but the quickest way to get up here is using a ridesharing app and set the destination to the Christmas Tree Point (the only parking area for Twin Peaks - pretty limited parking). Please note that the Christmas Tree Point itself is only the viewing area and not the actual peaks - you will have to walk toward to the entrance of the Christmas Tree Point to see the northern peak.\n\nThis is simply one of the best SF views you can find and you don't have to pay a dime too (other than the money you pay for using a ridesharing app)!", "author": "Luke L."}

Parking can be a hassle depending on what time of day you decide to go. I think it gets a little packed at night mainly because the view is breathtaking and more people come to see the city lights.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-24", "description": "When you pull up to the viewpoint at Twin Peaks and see the few number of people at the top, you have to wonder: where is everybody? Why on earth do so many people flock over to huge attractions in SF like Fisherman's Wharf or touristy places like the Space Needle, but you will rarely have to fight through crowds or pay a dime to engulf yourself in the beauty of the city skyline? \n\nIn my honest opinion, Twin Peaks is probably one of the most underrated attractions in the Bay Area. When people talk about San Francisco, you most likely won't hear about Twin Peaks. But why not? Once you visit this magical place, you'll never forget about it. And here's why.\n\nWhen you drive into San Francisco, you have most likely seen a huge red tower up on the clouds. That, my friends is the Sutro Communication Tower and the marker for where Twin Peaks is located. Even from far away, Twin Peaks COMMANDS your attention. To access the top, you can either hike the one mile up or just drive. Either is fine because there probably won't be too many people here. \n\nI recommend coming at night because there's only few sights that can rival the beauty of the SF skyline at night. I've come here at least 5-6 times with different groups of friends during the nighttime, and each time every one I go with falls in love with the view. You can probably spend hours up at the top just picking out the different buildings in a sea of skyscrapers. And if that doesn't convince you to check this place out, my freshman college roommate took my advice and actually proposed to his girlfriend at Twin Peaks! This place is so magical that it brings people together haha!\n\ntl;dr Twin Peaks is gorgeous and an absolute must see for both Bay Area natives and tourists alike.

Some advice before visiting:\n\n- It is very windy on top of Twin Peaks so bring a hoodie and something to secure your hair unless you want to take those selfies with your hair whipping around.\n\n- If it's foggy, Twin Peaks sits in the middle of it and you won't see anything except fog all around you which makes driving up to the top a little dicey with the turns and twists. Drive slowly and be safe. \n\n- You can visit up until midnight. The views are beautiful when the view is clear with the city lights twinkling below. \n\n- Pets are allowed, just keep them on a leash when outside of the vehicles.\n\n- Parking is limited so be patient when you arrive. You might have to wait in a queue to pull into a space. If you are up for a challenge, take the stairs from the bottom and get a great workout.\n\n- There is a public restroom at the main parking lot but I can't comment on its cleanliness because I have never used it.\n\n- Many of San Francisco's landmarks are visible from the viewing area next to the parking lot. On a clear day, you can see the Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, Alcatraz, Transamerica Building, downtown skyscrapers, Market Street, the Pacific, Golden Gate Park and more.\n\n- Lastly if you visit during April and May, you might see the Mission Blue Butterfly. Twin Peaks is only one of two places in the entire world where you can see this endangered butterfly so keep your eyes open!", "author": "Kristine H."}

I still don't have a clue why we almost missed out, but I'm so happy we decided to go in the end.\n\nThe view on a clear day is spectacular. One of the peaks is definitely more popular and scenic than the other, so if you only want to climb one of them, go for the hill that's closer to the Golden Gate Bridge. And like a visit to the Bridge, the best time to make the hike is when there's a minimal amount of fog obscuring the city below (although this isn't really a tip if you're familiar with San Francisco's typical weather conditions). There are wooden boards along the side of the hills that mark the path leading up and down; however, it's still somewhat challenging for the average person who isn't comfortable walking on an incline. Bring walking shoes and a light jacket, as it can get very windy!\n\nSome of my favorite pictures were captured at Twin Peaks, and it was unquestionably one of the highlights of our trip.

Haha, I took so many pictures once I reached the top of the 2 Twin Peaks! Of course, I took pics & videos to document my first trek towards and up to Twin Peaks! Also, I only had my flip flops on hiking up and down all those rocky steps! \n\nAnother second time, I was lucky to be with my son and even more blessed it was on a clear SF night where my son could enjoy the lovely sunset! I love sunsets! I'm more of a sunset girl than a sunrise person. Yet, who knows, maybe one day I may change my mind. LOL. I prefer staring off into the sunset, with all the piercing rays seeping through my eyes and innermost dark spaces & awake my soul. \n\nThere were so many people above the peak we were on by the time it was ready to view the beautiful sunset. All the clouds above strewn and reflecting the multitudes of the sun rays as the sun was making it's way down the horizon. Many people were taking pictures & also I saw a group video the entire spectacle with a tripod holding their cellphone up in the sunset's direction the entire time. Smart of that person. I also had the delightful pleasure to see many monarch butterflies dancing fluttering around in front of me above the rocky dirt ground. They were sooo pretty! ^_^\n\nIn general, most people either are locals who hike, run, or walk up, down, and around the peaks OR are tourists! I was fortunate to play both parts.

Or maybe the conquistadors were just horny since they didn't have the Condor Club back then. They stay up all night in Spain after all. Come to think of it, those mammary mountains do remind me of Bette Midler's take on Sophie Tucker's joke: \"I was in bed last night with my boyfriend Ernie, and he said to me 'Soph, you got no tits and a tight box'. I said to him 'Ernie, get off my back!'\" Rimshot please. Twin Peaks. My 2,800th review. No, I haven't run out of restaurants to review. I just use these 100-mark milestones to celebrate something that I probably take for granted. Twin Peaks is two of those things...I mean \"are\" two of those things.\n\nLeave it to Jamie W. to remind me to tool up here every once in a while to remind ourselves what a grand city San Francisco is from this vantage point. Remember when the apes stampeded down the hillside in \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\"? Well, that's not the Twin Peaks I remember. The one I recall was the fake backdrop in \"Flower Drum Song\" when James Shigeta took Nancy Kwan out for an innocent spin in his open convertible. The view still looks like a fake backdrop, but it is real. The view down Market Street to the heart of downtown can still be gorgeous in the daytime (photo: http://bit.ly/1swAEEF) or at night (photo: http://bit.ly/1uYjd6O) if the fog doesn't roll in (though that can be magical as well).\n\nIt's crowded up there no matter when you go. Expect a line of cars and a whole lotta tourist buses waiting for the few parking spaces up there. I've always had luck with the lot as I think people forget it's there. I have yet to touch one of the aged telescopes that require two bits to peer through. Germs, y'know. Did you know each peak has a name? No, it's not Laverne and Shirley. It's Eureka to the north and Noe to the south. They're 200 meters apart, and Twin Peaks Blvd. does a figure eight around them which I have to admit has led me in the wrong direction (photo: http://bit.ly/1zJxzcV).

Make sure you layer up! \n- Just go to the area where there's a wall, don't bother climbing up the hill. The view isn't as great on the hill and going up and down is scary since the stairs are covered in dirt and aren't even proper stairs.\n- There's restrooms up there but they are single stalls and the line's pretty long. \n\nI went during the day so I saw a clear view, but I would love to come back at night one day.", "author": "Chanel H."}

We went up to the top of one of the hills and took photos from there. Make sure you wear a wind breaker because it is extremely windy. The view is great but there isn't much else to do and the view gets tiresome after a few minutes. It's probably a place you stay for 10 minutes or less to soak in the view but not much else.

One of my favorite servers is Christine, she does a great job of always taking care of my friends & I when were here.  Even when she's not helping us she insures us that we will be taken care of.

But if you would rather take the summit from the very beginning - the bottom of the resort where the trail officially starts, then the hike can be challenging for some people. \n\nI would recommend the summit, though. As you are walking, definitely mind your steps, but do remember to stop once in a while to enjoy the scene. It gets better as you are higher up. When you get to the viewing deck, you will see the crowd taking photos. Then you can see very clearly the two peaks, follow the stairs to get to the top of them if you will.\n\nA lot of people may be driving, but walking to twin peaks can be fun as well. I walked from the mission, just google map the route. The walk is safe and peaceful, you can also have a feel for the residential area in Castro. \n\nI saw girls wearing short skirts there. If you are not familiar with the windy weather in SF, or the concept of 'it's usually more windy as it gets higher up', here's a tip - don't wear a skirt unless you want the entire San Francisco to see your underwear.

It does give you the most amazing view of San Francisco during the day. The drive up to Twin Peaks isn't the easiest, but there are parking spaces at different locations of Twin Peaks. \n\nThere will probably always be a lot of tourists taking pictures up here, but because there's different photo op spots, it won't be too hard trying to get that perfect picture of San Fran. There's a normal bridge area that overlooks SF, with artists selling paintings, telescopes, and bathrooms. If you drive up further, there are the two peaks that have stairs that give you access to climb to the top to get an even better and different view of San Francisco. \n\nI think it's worth it to come to Twin Peaks at least once, especially if you're a big photo person.

I had been here before just to see the entire view of SF but never with a camera, so I was hoping to capture the beauty. Parking is limited at the top of the mountain but people come and go so hopefully you snag a spot. I came here last weekend an hour or so before sunset so around 6-7:30pm. My friends and I just took shots of the beautiful view and waited til closer to 8 to take the money shots since the sun was still pretty high in the sky. If you go down to the dirt area in front of the rock wall, you can take some really pretty shots with the sun peering through. It is like America's Next Top Model down there so I would check it out. \n\nI went a second time and I guess you can actually hike up the peak so you can view the other peak. There are stairs leading to the top and I was wearing flats so it was slightly uncomfortable but still doable. It took me less than five minutes to get to the top and since it is an incline, you may be a bit tired. Good thing the wind is blasting in your face at the very top. I think the view is wayyy better at night. I went during the day the second time and the view was alright but the best time is before, during and after sunset. \n\nIt is pretty freezing up there since it is SF and when you add the wind, it makes the photography adventure quite intolerable. But you have to suck it up to get a pretty shot! You have to stay until sunset to get the best shots. If you want night shots, you will have to stay up there in the cold for another hour or two. \n\n**TIPS**\n1) For photographers, come an hour before sunset for a great shot.\n2) Dress warmly!

Visibility was awesome and I didn't want to go although the parking situation (people waiting for others to leave and also get a piece of joy with this view of San Francisco) was not ideal. The very modern restrooms are a little bit tricky: a woman could not properly operate the door because did not follow the instructions of wait a little for the restroom to be self cleaned and then enter, so she got almost caught in action. Well, at least there are restrooms and everything is perfect in this point, where I also had the opportunity to meet some tourists from Venezuela and chitchat in Spanish. I don't think of other place where you can get this view of San Francisco.", "author": "Carmen V."}

With great views along the way and even better at the end on one of the tops.\n\nI have gone to the top a couple of ways.  Which way just depends on how much of a hike I am wanting.\n\nThe easiest way is to take the Muni's 37 Corbet line from the Castro.  It will take you up to the park then you can hike to the peak.  Note: this still leaves you hiking the steepest part.  \n\nThe longer hike is about 2 miles from Castro station. All most all uphill according to Wiki you climb about 200 feet.   Most of the hikes will be through nice neighborhoods on their narrow roads.  There are lots of nice views to wet your taste for the views from the top.  Finally you will reach the park where you hike on narrow trails through the park to the top.\n\nThere are also tour busses that take you close to the top to an observation point.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-25", "description": "I am so proud to be able to call San Francisco my home. WARNING: This will get sappy.\n\nI have been all around the world, explored 23 countries and counting and still the view from the top of Twin Peaks takes my breath away every time. \n\nI am a born & raised Bay Area girl. Let me tell you, you cannot truly appreciate the immense beauty of the Bay Area until you see the entire span of it, (North, East, Peninsula, South, SF, and beyond) from the top of Twin Peaks on a clear day. The joy I get pinpointing locations and landmarks from the top is indescribable, but I will do my best.\n\nFirstly, if you find yourself at the top of TP on a clear day, just know that the entire universe is on your side. In my opinion, prime time is just before sunset, when the skyline begins to dim and blush pink at the thought of what the night holds.\n\nGoogle when sunset is for that day and arrive 20 minutes before so that you can also see in broad daylight. You will be able to see clear through to the Golden Gate and beyond unto the vast Pacific, up North to Sausalito and Tiburon where tiny yachts look like toys in a giant bath tub. San Rafael bridge is visible, the Bay Bridge, to the South, the San Mateo Bridge, if you can squint hard enough you'll also find the Martinez bridge towards the East. You can also spot Mt. Tam towards the North. To the west, Ocean beach looks like a dream especially when the fog starts to blanket Daly City. Towards the East I can pinpoint the location of my hometown, along the waters edge of San Pablo Bay. The entire East Bay sitting along a beautiful coastline. Farther out towards the East, on a clear enough day you can see Mt. Diablo. SF city looks timeless, it shines bright with hopes and dreams even before the sun completely sets. Don't even get me started on the views during actual sunset. I'll let you figure it out on your own.\n\nWhen I want to feel and see how small I am as a human, I come up to TP. The view puts everything into perspective. Things just make sense up there, that maybe I can't normally think about at home in my cave of an apartment. Maybe it's the clean ocean breeze, higher levels of oxygen, or maybe it's just magic. I'd bet on the latter.\n\nI love it! I know you will too. \n\nTIPS:\nBe very careful driving up to TP, especially at night. Drive SLOW, people are often crossing the road up there because there isn't a true designated Pedestrian crosswalk which the city should really have put in by now. \nGo potty at home! \nBe courteous, don't ruin anyone's good time please.\nDon't be silly, always bring a warm jacket, it may be 70 out and look clear in the valley, but on TP it's always chilly. \nThe secret hill at the back of the viewing location is worth a hike up, especially before sunset. Be careful, don't slip, there is no true path except for wooden boards placed loosely in the dirt, and it's pretty steep!", "author": "Alexandra C."}

Such a glorious view of SF, either on a clear, sunny day or during the evenings when all is dark but all the lights are aglow.\n\nThe crowds are different between the daytime and evenings. Most of my visits have been during the day, where you are one of many people camping up top to admire the view and take pictures. Despite all the people, it's still pretty tranquil at the peak. There is a smaller peak across the street, that has it's own pretty view at the top. Although I'd say it's the perfect place to get away from the crowds and have some alone time, there is a steady trickle of curious visitors that climb to the top of this secondary peak, ruining any chances of quiet solitude.\n\nAt night it's a bit different. Don't be surprised if you drive to the top, and upon stepping out, you run back in because it's super cold! (My friends and I did that once. We only had time to take a picture, before almost freezing to death :P ) On those not-too-cold nights, there is a smaller crowd of people admiring the view compared to the day crowd. One thing I don't like about being up here at night is that there is usually little pockets of people that are up there to smoke their weed, normally towards the southwestern side - creating sort of a dodgy atmosphere. :(\n\nOverall, I will always return to Twin Peaks for a bit of solitude away from the hustle and bustle of downtown SF (one could say even that of life).

I drove all over the damn city.  I went to SEE in Cow Hollow or some place with a ridiculous name.  I drove around the Presidio, Golden Gate Park, along the ocean, the Richmond district, the Castro and more.  Eventually, I encountered a sign that said \"Twin Peaks\" with an arrow.  I didn't know what Twin Peaks was so I followed the arrow and ended up on a mountain.\n\nTwin Peaks are two peaks of about the same height in the southern part of San Francisco.  You can take a steep drive up to the top where there is a parking lot and a great view.  You can also walk up the hill like I saw some people doing but I think I would die if I tried that.  \n\nThe top is very touristy but the view is amazing.  All of San Francisco is sprawled out in front of you.  You can see the ocean, the bay, the bridge, the downtown, the hills.  It's truly a great view of the city.  You'll find many people who think the same so it's hardly a refuge from the city.  The place is pretty busy and parking is limited.  I'm sure that certain times and certain days are better to visit.\n\nMany cities have a large skyscraper or tower to view the city (Sears Tower, Empire State Building, CN Tower, etc.)  In San Francisco it's fitting that one of the highest and best views is a hill.", "author": "Ryan L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-04", "description": "I've had Twin Peaks on my bucket list for several years and I finally had a great day to just do it.   I started out on the # 37 bus but decided to hike about 1/2 way up, so I exited at an early stop.   After a hike up several roadways and then thru 2 or 3  steep ascending staircases between the housing units, I arrived at trail pointers for the final ascent to both peaks. Hint, this trail pointer is right behind the last housing complex next to the peaks - call it a mid-way point which ends on a the winding figure 8 road and yes you have to hop over a concrete barrier placed there to keep the cars on the road.    \n\nThe stairs are stone and gravel and the ascent is not for those out of shape or with medical conditions.  There is an observation area at the base of the peaks which has limited parking.   While I was there at least 1 tourist bus arrived but since I arrived early on a Tuesday, I avoided most of the crowds which is rare.  Once you reach the base, there are winding / ascending stairs to the top of each peak via  two sides of the each peak.  \n\nOnce you reach the top, sit and be awed by the views.  Luckily, for me, it was a crystal clear day and the wind was not too bad.  I can understand how that can change rapidly.  I advise bringing a coat, dressing appropriately and wear sunscreen.  At night, I'm sure it is COLD.  I spent an hour on each peak, from about midday until well after 14:00.  I was mostly alone, enjoying the solitude with only a few other visitors.  It was peaceful to just be taking photos and appreciating the awesome views, rugged terrain, and wind whipping across the tops.   I really did not want to come down but my hunger from the hike won out. \n\nUpon descent, the stairs are still rocky so watch your footing.  Appropriate foot ware is advisable for hiking.  At night, the footing can be treacherous and I suspect hand held lighting is required as I saw no other major illumination.  \n\nYes, there is one restroom, located at the base of 1 peak, so as others have said, you should go beforehand if possible.  \n\nI also decided to hike all the way back down to Market and was treated with some really nice views while walking thru these gorgeous neighborhoods. Near the end of my hike down was this awesome spiral ramp twisting down the next level - not expected.  \n\nWhile I'm not sure how far the # 37 bus goes or where exactly it stops. I recommend finding out and visiting Twin Peaks if possible - especially on a clear day.  Remember to dress appropriately and mind your footing and you will be rewarded with views not available elsewhere.  I plan to return for a dusk or night view sometime as I image seeing the city light up as the sun sets is a wonderful transition to capture.  Cheers.", "author": "G M."}

A flashlight at night isn't a bad idea, as you're walking up winding wooden steps. \n\nFor its popularity, we've never felt crowded or even seen many people while we visit and parking is easy at the base, between the 2 peaks. If you don't make it any higher than the drive up, even that view is pretty great.\n\nMy favorite time is when the fog rolls in -- it's so neat to watch it take over the city.", "author": "Megan S."}

I used to live here, I know.\n\nThe picture opportunities- lots of them. The hills, the streets, the homes, the landmarks you recognize- it's there. I'm sure if you had that Panoramic feature on your camera, it would not disappoint. Sometimes strangers will offer to take a picture of you and yours, which is really nice. We do this all the time- we reciprocate the favor. Our camera: Press the button down half way and then click! Voila- a picture to remember.\n\nYeah, it's cold and windy even if it's sunny (at least, the sky is blue).

I've mentioned this basic rule numerous times in my other reviews.\n\nIt's funny how you know one way getting here as a teenager and then of course, we went another way, and I didn't recognize the path!

I need to get back on track. Writing this is like trying to say on track while driving the windy road to Twin Peaks.\n\nIt's not really a park, but just a scenic vista point with busloads of tourists. What's even more shocking is that some of the tourists never got off the bus. Maybe the bus driver was on a tight schedule?\n\nThe alarm remote wouldn't lock and unlock my car so I had to use key entry. Maybe that's why the bus passengers don't unload - the bus doors won't open. The transmission towers on the Peaks were probably interfering with my car remote.

It's not the easiest place to get to without a car so it might be difficult to go to if you're just visiting SF like I was. I ended up taking a cab which isn't the best idea because no cab driver wants to go there; the fare to get there wouldn't be worth it. I split the cab fare with some buddies anyway so it wasn't too bad. Luckily, we had an awesome cab driver that took us there despite of this. He also gave us a little bit of a tour and history of SF. It probably jacked up the fare, but his conversations were interesting enough to make it seem worth it.  Also, the cab driver mentioned that it's usually cloudy in SF so that day we were lucky because the skies were all clear and sunny. \n\nTwin Peaks is an awesome view, but that's all there is to it. Not much else to do, but to climb the two peaks and soak in the view. It's pretty windy up there so it can get chilly. Make sure to bring a light jacket or sweater. \n\nI went during the day, but I can imagine it looks just as amazing at night with everything lit up. \n\nGetting back to the hotel was a challenge.

The peak furthest from the tower, where the road first breaks onto the top, is the best peak. \n\nWhy do you ask? On a clear day, you can see all three bridges, Napa, Sausalito, Alameda, down to South Bay and across the ocean. At night, GG Bridge, Bay Bridge and the Alameda Bridge look fantastic. But if you decide to climb the first peak near the tower, then you get nothing but trees instead of a clear, microscopic GG Bridge.\n\nAs for the neighborhood...nice, safe and quiet. Plenty of parking and houses with actual backyards. Downside is the fog in the summer and the inconsistent Line 36 making my ass walk up and down the backside of Twin Peaks. Not fun.

Obviously it's better if you come on a sunny day but expect to share the view with a lot more people than usual because of it.  But that's ok because people are pretty good about not getting in your pictures and staying out of each other's way - this is not a place where you want to tumble.\n\nA fun game my family and I did was to try and distinguish the different neighborhoods from each other.\n\nI would recommend shifting your car into a lower gear, on your way up and down for a few reasons:  one, there's a chance you're part of a procession and it wouldn't be smart to speed demon your way through the two-lane road; two, mainly for on your way down, you don't want to burn your brakes; and three, driving slower allows you to take in the view before/after reaching the top.\n\nJust a suggestion.", "author": "Connie M."}

Diablo, I've got to get out of the 'burbs sometimes and go on an urban hike for a change. After a great lunch in Noe Valley, we followed the walking directions up to Twin Peaks, via the stairs on Douglass and then up Romain and Corbett. It didn't take too long but the majority is uphill, so got a good workout on the way up. Loved seeing all the houses and gardens along the way.\nOnce to the peaks, we hiked up and down each one.  The climb up from Noe Valley to the lots near Twin Peaks was actually more strenous than the peaks themselves.  But once up there-the most awesome views of the city I've seen yet. Love the view straight down Market where you can see the flag in the Castro all the way down to the Ferry Building. \nFound another place I can take out of town visitors for spectacular city views-although they will probably prefer driving over hiking.

The sun is out, the windows are down, we're full of truffles and ice cream, Michael Franti's 'Say Hey(I Love You)' is on the radio, hawt gay guys are blowing me kisses at traffic stops (no joke) and needless to say...it's a blissful Sunday afternoon.\n\nBeing the wannabe-pseudo-crunchy-neo-hippie that I am, I stuck my head out of the passenger window so I could feel the salty San Fran breeze lick my face (in contrast to the usual hot-as-balls summer subway funk that kicks my ass in NYC). After a few minutes of this, I decided to open my eyes to look towards the heavens above, and that's when I saw it: the distinctive double masts of a large ship...IN THE SKY.\n\nIt was a pirate ship HIDDEN IN THE CLOUDS!*\n\nAt first, I thought I was hallucinating, so I closed my eyes, brought my head back in the Volvo (C is old-school gansta) and decide to look out through the front windshield. Guess what - IT'S STILL THERE.\n\nNow I'm getting concerned, because we seemed to driving closer to this cloud-bound nautical beast (seriously - with masts that big, this ship had to be HUGE), so, trying to keep my cool, I said to my companions, \"Um, so like...does that look like a pirate ship to anyone else, or am I trippin'?\" \n\nC took a glance and said \"Hey, look, that's pretty cool\", before making a turn that inevitably brought us closer to the summit. K just nodded and nonchalantly replied \"Yes, Oriana - we're taking you to our Pirate Overlord.\"\n\nAt this point, I started *FREAKING* out, because...well...I've seen the Wizard of Oz too many times as a kid, and if our journey to the Pirate Overlord's ship in the sky was gonna be anything like that, there was no way I coulda survived an encounter with the flock of flying monkeys.\n\nSo now we're slowly meandering up a secluded winding mountain road, listening to acid jazz in silence. And I'm trying really hard to maintain my composure and not ruin the collective chill vibe in the Volvo, but OMFG - WE'RE GOING TO MEET THE PIRATE OVERLORD!!!\n\nFinally, we reach the top, park, exit the car aaaannnnnnnndddddddddddd...there's no pirate overlord in the sky...womp womp. What I *thought* were the masts of his ship were actually plain ole radio antennas on the highest point of San Fran - the thick fog kept their bases hidden from sight when we were driving through the Castro. \n\n*sadface*\n\nSo instead, I enjoyed the breathtaking view of the entire city; with the Golden Gate Bridge to my left, Downtown San Fran straight ahead, and Oakland in the distance (...and may it always stay that far away :::shudders:::). And once the initial vertigo subsided, at that altitude we could actually look *through* the clouds/fog and even map out C's house in the Lower Haight.\n\nSince no one else was wearing a look of disappointment, I couldn't tell if any of the other Twin Peaks visitors were also there to meet the Pirate Overlord.  However, most were taking pictures and a few were even picnicking against the cliff wall below, since it was the only area blocked from the fierce misty breezes.\n\nI still would like to meet the Pirate Overlord who lives in the skies of San Francisco, though...I'm just sayin'. Or maybe I just have an overactive imagination. (But admit it...you believe in him, too.)\n\n*Full disclosure: I was a bit done because of the Truffle Man in Delores Park.", "author": "Lady O."}

Some short hikes are accessible around the peaks and the road around the peaks is great for jogging on before 9 AM.  The views are incredible and you get to watch free fireworks shows from the comfort of your own home.  You also get to watch the Blue Angels when they're in town.  And San Francisco has one of the most stunning skylines in the world.\n\nNow for the bad stuff - it gets freaking cold up there and WINDY.  When that fog rolls in from the ocean blanketing the Sunset/Richmond and pushes itself over the peaks and tries to spill into the Castro and Mission, the apex is the peaks and the three highest residential streets in San Francisco.  Blustery would be a mild way to describe it.  \n\nDefinitely a must see for any visitors, if it's not foggy.", "author": "J H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-12", "description": "I almost got killed tonight by a matching pillow-top mattress and box-spring set.\n\nOn my realistic quest to look like a Victoria's Secret Model by Summer Swimsuit Season, I hiked two miles this morning and then decided to leave my office (near the Ferry Building) at 6 pm and walk home to the Sunset via Twin Peaks.  A 6.5 mile hike, guaranteed to shed a little of my winter cushion.\n\nAfter I passed the Castro, I stood near the top of Twin Peaks and was fortunate enough to catch a beautiful sunset.  Between gasping for air and admiring the view, my physical and spiritual bodies felt pretty darn strong.\n\nAnd then I saw it.  A truck speeding down Market Street (or was it Portola?  I forget where they transition) with a mattress set in the back.  Suddenly, as if I were in a movie, the fluffy white mattress and box-spring both flew out of the back of the truck and start skidding towards me.  It was terrifying.  As they approached, I was sure they were going to shove me over the railing and kill me.  My life honestly flashed before my eyes.  What a terrible way to go, you know?  ---Hey, you know Janney B. from Yelp?  B*tch got ranover by a Serta last night.  Let's 5-star her death!---\n\nFortunately for me, the killer mattresses landed in the road twenty feet away from me.  Unfortunately for rush hour traffic, they were blocking both of the lanes.  The truck at fault kept going and didn't stop.  Traffic was at a standstill, vehicles unable to pass the scene.  \n\nI stood there, the only pedestrian around, still huffing and puffing from the first 4 miles of my urban hike.  Without thinking, I threw my messenger bag on the sidewalk, sprinted into traffic (it's dark, mind you), grabbed the box-spring mattress and pulled it out of the way.  THEN, while cars began whizzing by in the left hand lane, I bent with knees and flipped the heavy mattress three times until it went up on the sidewalk, finally resting against the railing.  This adrenaline-fueled feat of strength is especially impressive, considering that I typically require help opening jars of pickles and bottles of water.\n\nI was the only moron walking in the direction of traffic in the dark on Twin Peaks.  Call me crazy (my exes do...) but I think I was in the right place at the right time.  I was meant to be there, because people needed my help.  What a terrific feeling that is. \n\nNote: Mr. Trucker, you're gonna have to try harder than that to get me into bed.", "author": "Janney B."}

Eureka, the North Peak is 904 ft.), the Peaks are actually the second tallest hills in SF (Mount Davidson is the tallest), but probably #1 in terms of best 360 panoramic view.\n\nAnd the hype is deserved - they're pretty incredible, both during a (clear) day, when you can see for miles in every direction, and at night (when it turns into a bit of a makeout/ smokeout point), when the lights of the city come on like a huge electric train set.\n\nThe downers about TP have been well-documented: too many fanny pack-toting tourists with their deisel-belching busses crowding the parking lot & posing for group photo ops.  \n\nSo definitely make sure you get out of the parking lot and climb the dirt trails to the tops of the actual peaks.\n\nThere's also an complete lack of amenities - a mediocre hot dog vendor is all that stands between you and starvation.  Srinivas R. made the comment of the year: \"If they had a bar, it'd be perfect.\"  So its BYOB...problem solved.\n\nWhen you do go, you should also beware of the weather.  \"Los Pechos de la Choca\" - or the Breasts of the Indian Maiden as the Spaniards called the Peaks (no sh*t) - can get especially...ahem...nipply.  And fog can essentially ruin the view (although being above a low-lying fog layer might be a cool experience unto itself) - so check the weather report.\n\nBut watching a storm roll in and ravage the city from this vantage, as Jason W. says, could possibly be one of the coolest things you can do.\n\nAnd if you want to get 'extreme', try the Sevenpeak run - which covers  3,200 feet of elevation in its ups and downs:\n\nhttp://bestof.sfweekly.com/bestof/award.php?oid=oid:67225&section=oid:24954&year=2005\n\nFrom personal experience I can say it's a bitch, but your surroundings will keep you going.  (\"Rocky Mountain High\"...or something like that.)\n\nFinally: Did you know...?\nTwin Peaks is only one of three areas that provides a home to the endangered Mission Blue Butterfly.\n\nMost of the plant life the Mission Blue Butterfly needs to survive has been destroyed by development, but Twin Peaks has been able to restore and sustain much of this natural plant life, providing a safe place for the butterfly to survive. \n\nI do my research, foo'...ya heard.", "author": "Ryan W."}

Golden Gate Park, Alcatraz, Bay Bridge, Sausalito. \n\nWe precariously hiked up the steep steps to the peak, with the wind threatening to blow us away at any minute. Step by step, catching each other as we stumbled, we made it up to the top. We were in the midst of clouds and fog. Misty, windy, amazing.", "author": "Jeanne S."}

It's absolutely beautiful up here! Even though we went on a cloudy day, it was still a sight to see. I've never been at night or on a sunny day but when I went it was hella chilly. So be sure to bundle up or bring your special someone and cuddle.\nThe drive here is scary since your going up a narrow hill and thinking about the drive down doesn't make it easier. It's just as worse. It'd be best to take a small compact car. Unfortunately for us, we took a big truck. Good thing is there's no parking fee here, however, there are few parking spots so you might have to park along the curb or gravel.", "author": "Lisa T."}

Set near the geographical centre of the City, yet out towards the residential areas, it provides sweeping, epic views from the second-highest points in the City itself (first is Mount Davidson).  Since I was a child, this has defined the City for me, just as much as the Golden Gate Bridge or Lombard Street or the Transamerica Pyramid. It feels more \"local\" than any other tourist spot, being that it is in a residential area; if it wasn't for the tour buses up there every day, it would almost feel like a local secret to me. I like to take tourists here first because it's sort of like the table of contents/overview/abstract to their impending adventure.\n\nWhenever I have visitors, and a car, this is the first place I take them. Whenever I want to relax with friends, and have a car, this is where I usually take them. Whenever I feel depressed, and have a car, this is where you can usually find me. Whenever I am happy, and have a car, this is where you can usually find me. Whenever I am contemplative, and have a car, this is usually where you can find me. I've even hiked here from the Castro (a mile and a half away, and steeply uphill), such is my love and dedication for this place. \n\nPoint is, this is a beautiful place for everyone - local or visitor - and not just some tourist trap... although it is definitely the place to wow out-of-towners (when the view is clear). However, you can find me - a staunch local despite not residing within City limits - up there in any weather, from idyllic sun to dreamlike fog to torrential rain.", "author": "Joanne C."}

From Portola Drive, I'd then turn onto Twin Peaks Boulevard and let the 'visitors/party' in the limo, further enjoy the scenery, as I somewhat slowly ascended to the final parking areas at the top of Twin Peaks, where the limo-party could get out and look around for however long they desired.\nUsually then, most limousine/bus tourguides, retrace their path-to-the-top-of-Twin Peaks, returning down to Portola/Market, to continue on from there.  However, quite often I would, instead, exit Twin Peaks by taking the 'back road', down into the Haight-Ashbury.  This means continuing on Twin Peaks Boulevard, down to Clayton Street, crossing 17th Street and then taking Ashbury Street off of Clayton.\nThis is where my particular 'Experience' occurred, that I am relating here!\nAt this point, of our descent-into-Haight/Ashbury, at about Ashbury and Waller Streets, I would usually pick up my microphone to address the 'party-in-the-rear', with the following 'tour-guide-announcement': \"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are are now approaching one of the most famous locations in the City of San Francisco.  Just ahead, at the very next intersection, is that famous street-sign, that says, 'Haight/Ashbury'!\"\nWell, as it just happened to be, the 'party' in the rear of my limo that day, was a group of teenagers who were celebrating the birthday of one of their group and were doing so in my limo.  But, it was still somewhat surprising to me, when, after my afore-given 'announcement', I just happened to hear, just barely through the glass-window-separator between the Driver and Passenger compartments, which was about half-way-down anyway, one of the kids in the rear, who turned to his companions and asked the very question that had surprised me so much: \"Hey, Dudes!  What is Haight/Ashbury?\"", "author": "Nelson R."}

The view, whether at day or night, is simply amazing (as long as the fog doesn't ruin things). The spot is hardly an unknown commodity, but both times I've gone there was plenty of space to enjoy the sights without feeling cramped. Just be sure to bring warm clothing, as the combination of altitude, wind, and proximity to the ocean can make twin peaks very cold at times.", "author": "Byron C."}

I love the roads leading up to it especially when it turns into a one way, nice and slippery, amateurs be careful, actually dont drive or ride hard up there cause there are them pesky bicyclists ya gotta watch out for.  The lot up there is pretty tight, but its usually packed on those nice nights, but there are little lots on the road down on every side so you can still get your views in.  Oh yeah if you see cars rockin or cars with steamed windows, dont bother em.  Or if youre into it, fuck with em, tell em to get a room or share their weed.

As long as it isn't foggy, it's gosh-darn easy to figure out where you should be walking as you can see it! The thing is, even if you don't go all the way up to hang out with the crowds who drove to the top, you will still have found yourself a fetching view of SF, the hills and the bay to the east.\n\n\n You also get to walk past lots of victorian houses in the quaint SF style. It's a very safe neighborhood to wander in, and if you're lucky, you might come across some of the secret stairs.\n\n\n Give yourself 2 hours to get to the top, 1 hr to get down.
