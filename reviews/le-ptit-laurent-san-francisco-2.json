There were three people in our group, and we got to the restaurant at just the right time and only waited around 5-10 minutes to be seated. \n\nWe ordered several plates to share: escargots, tartine de brie, cassoulet, scallops, and one of the fixed price neighborhood menus (the starter was a melon-prosciutto salad; the entree was a delicious French take on shepherd's pie; dessert was profiteroles). Everything was absolutely amazing! I would absolutely return and re-order any of the items we tried, but there were a ton of other things on the menu I'd love to taste as well. \n\nService was friendly and we never felt rushed. This restaurant is definitely worth the short drive we took.", "author": "Sarah B."}

It was delicious!\n\nI had the rack of lamb with green beans and mash, my date had the night's special filet mignon.  While mine was lovely and I enjoyed everything about it, my date's filet had too many parts that were chewy, too much gristle.  For the price, just not okay, thus 4 stars not 5.  It wasn't until I was done that I noticed the pile of steak bits on his plate when he was done.  We had been engaged in eating and conversation.

Only one dish was not what I expected.  The Hachis Parment $22, was kinda dry for me.  With minced meat topped with mash and cheese rather like a gratin. I would have preferred to have gravy in the meat for a juicier and hearty meal.  However, the rest of the dishes were really delicious.  My favorites are the onion soup $10, chicken coq au vin $29 and the fois gras $16.  Great service and attention.  They also have a 3 course set $31 available Mon - Thurs.

The butter was from the fridge clearly. It was a nice cold chunk in a light metal dish. The lamb chops was quite rare for medium well done. I had to switch my dish to give it to my husband. The mashed potatoes was nice but nothing special. The sauce was very dark brown, as if it came canned already. The duck dish was a complete fail. It was a ducks leg and spam like meat chunks in a bowl of white bean soup. That costs you $37. I could buy 2 whole roasted ducks for that price! They cooked it like chicken...with carrots. Smh. If this restaurant was in LA, it would not survive. Food critics are very critical there. Not sure why NorCal loves this place. \n\nOh they also did not disclose the \"CC ask\" which a credit card adjustment otherwise known as a credit card fee of $3.99 after we paid $124 plus tip. We had wine and dessert. Cr\u00e9eme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good and wine was pretty average. You'd think they would not charge you for using a credit card because you are dining there and charging over $10-$15 as an incentive. Nope! It wasn't a party of 15 either. First try here but definitely not memorable to go back just for bread or dessert to be charged $3.99 to use credit.\n\nI enjoyed the ambiance more then the food. The neighborhood was okay. SF has small space and small restaurants. Ambiance and bread doesn't give a client incentive to come back if the price isn't the same quality as the food. Cmon guys $37", "author": "Tom W."}

The food and the venue are reminiscent of typical neighborhood bistros in residential parts of Paris. While it might not be haute cuisine, it's all dependable, well-executed stuff, and the best part is the very reasonable pricing.\n\nThe \"neighborhood menu\" offered Sunday through Thursday, for example, is a deal by pricey West Bay standards: three courses for just $28. You start with a soup or salad, move on to a meatier entree like ribs or fish, and end with a dessert like pain perdu. All solid, satisfying stuff. Service is efficient and courteous, with the only drawback being the somewhat small space where folks are packed in rather tightly.

We were seated immediately and the restaurant wasn't too busy. The ambiance of the place is lovely - has a nice homey feeling with interesting decor. They offer a rotating 3-course neighborhood menu for $29 that consists of a starter (soup or salad), a main, and a dessert. It's a great deal if you like the items that week!\n\nEscargot - seasoning was garlic parsley butter, which was good. I order escargot whenever I see it offered on any menu, so I've had my fair share. This was slightly better than average. \nTuna tartare - tuna was so stringy! It's not nice to be eating a tartare and have to keep on chewing and chewing. So while the seasoning of the fish was good, the quality wasn't. Also didn't enjoy all the ginger pieces in this.\nFrench onion soup (if substituting into the neighborhood menu, add $5) - way too salty, would have been good if not for that \nSmoked salmon with salad - generous portion of smoked salmon, dill cream was nice\nFish bouillabaisse - the stew had a very rich seafood flavor, which was awesome. Came with several big pieces of fish, two big pieces of shrimp, and four mussels. It looked a little small, but it was enough because I had already had several appetizers and bread.\nLamb shank - presentation was good and lamb itself was cooked well. The green beans that came with it, however, had no flavor and were overcooked. I really dislike it when green beans are that soft. \nFresh pear tart - looked nice coming out, but taste was mediocre\nVanilla ice cream profiteroles - delicious. Light and airy profiteroles were great with the ice cream. The chocolate sauce on top was slightly bitter and the whole thing just worked well together.\n\nBecause the owner knew we were celebrating a birthday, they brought out some ice cream with a candle on top, which was nice. Service was great and the owner and waiter were friendly. Complimentary bread comes out nice and warm. We had a good time, but for the price of the meal (~$130), we expected better food taste and quality.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-17", "description": "Located in one of my favorite villages in San Francisco, this place transported me back to my Summers in the southern French countryside. Set up like a quirky cafe, serving solid staples, I could not believe how authentic the baguettes were crackling as we bit into them greedily after smearing thawed butter onto the slices. They even got stiff and bland when cold--perfect for swabbing up sauce!\n\nThe foie in the foie gras terrine were whole lobes and pinkish textured decadence served with balsamic reduction to offset the mind numbing richness.\n\nThe hangar steak with fries was dressed in a port (?) reduction that was heady and complex. Fries were perfectly crispy and fluffy and so well seasoned I did not need to add anything to it.\n\nThe cassoulet was heavy in the white beans. But... succulent pork cubes, alluring sausage morsels and rich duck confit leg quarter made this dish the headliner of the evening. It was served in a cast iron receptacle that kept the dish a tad too warm for my liking. At the end when the entree cooled, I could taste more of the Herbs de Provence which I adore. Given that there are at least several valid interpretations of cassoulet, this being one, we prefer the example containing chevre and lamb. \n\nThe pain perdu was intriguing. It was like a really dense french toast until you take a swipe at the ice cream and caramel sauce then some kind of wizardry happens in your mouth.\n\nThe creme brulee had thick crackle. And the creme was good. But not exceptional. \n\nThe service was old school fabulous. The maitre'd offered to check our coats when he seated us and offered sparkling or regular water. Our table setting was reset each time dishes were cleared and a new basket of bread brought out without request. When the entree was cleared, the table was swept and dessert menus brought out. When I inadvertently ordered a white wine with the meal, the server graciously and gently pointed it out, then proceeded to recommend a wine for our meal.\n\nThe Prix Fixe at $28 for 3 courses is a bargain if you want the items featured. Other wise,  the 3 courses would me more like $40-$45 a person.\n\nIf I had the items I ordered at the Prix Fixe price, this place would be a no brainer 5 star, and the reservation list even longer certainly. But even though the ala carte menu is a bit pricey, I am thrilled to have an authentic representation of solid French Cafe food this side of the city where I had", "author": "Lu-Shien T."}

I am giving the 2 stars because of a diconcerting policy the restaurant has inacted.  We have been coming for years but not for a while due to travels.  We went last night celebrate my husband's birthday and after a lovely meal and great service our poor waitress had to embarassingly tell us that, \"due to the new $l5.00 minimum wage if we pay by cash our bill would remain as presented but if we used a credit card they would ad the 3.2 percent cc charge.\"  After we recovered from shock at this announcement we looked to see if we had enough cash, as we do not carry very much.  The bill was hefty and we did not have the cash.  My next thought was to reduced the waitresses tip by 5% to recoup the 3.2%, but she was so wonderful we still gave her the full 20%.  I think many people would consider this and due it. As we left we did speak to owner and told him we thought the request was poor marketing and why not just increase some of the prices. We also said that every 1 person who might bring this to his attention 10 will leave, never come back and tell friends.  He stated that he appreciated our imput but this was an experiment and they were going to see how it played out. We have been to many upscale restaurants since the wage increase and none have inacted such a policy, I have noted some price increase.\n\nIt was not the best way to end a lovely meal in a place we have loved. The waitress did give my husband a bottle of wine (Spanish not French)  for his birthday, which was a nice touch.  I hope this experiment ends soon as I am not going to go to ATMs everytime I want to eat there.", "author": "Sally Z."}

Warning, the restaurant is small so it isn't great for groups bigger than 4 maybr and the wait can be a bit long (so make sure to get a reservation), but it is worth it.", "author": "Princess D."}

The ossu buco came with mashed potatoes and greens were tender with the rjght amount of sauce. The Cassoulet Toulousain Maison with duck confit, pork and Toulouse sausage were amazing.

I've been here several times previously and it was much better.\n\nThe service is really outstanding, and the waitress was very helpful with her recommendations.  That said, there were several things that were disappointing.  First of all, the menu on their web site is not the menu they gave us at the restaurant.  Always a bad sign when you are handed a laminated menu.  That's the restaurant equivalent of chiseling something in stone:  it never changes.  I was disappointed that they did not serve the Boeuf Bourgouignon or the Veal Shank they mentioned online.  (A French restaurant without Boeuf B?  That's like a steak house with no steak!).  The pate I ordered was okay but nothing special,  something you can buy at any gourmet food store.  Most of my guests thought their dinners were good, but nothing particularly remarkable.  I had the cassoulet, which was also good, but... not the best I've had.  And I've had better... at THIS restaurant!\n\nI am not a wine snob and don't order fine, vintage wines.   But their wine \"list\" is actually a book.  Now, this is a fairly small neighborhood restaurant and they could not possibly store all of the wines they listed.  With the help of one of my friends, we selected a Pinot Grigio.  Not available.  Viognier?  Non.  White Burgundy?  Helas!  Then tried some red:  Pinot Noir?  Not tonight.  I was finally sort of exasperated and just ordered a white similar to the Pinot G and a bottle of burgundy.  The waitress came up with some recommendations for wine they actually had available, which was a relief.\n\nThe owner was at the restaurant and very attentive to everything going on.  I just hope they can bring this back to the outstanding level they had before.", "author": "Larry B."}

I had not been to Le petit Laurent for maybe 3 years, and I heard mixed reviews from friends who had been there more recently. Our last experience last week was disappointing, for both food and service. The French bistro feeling is still there, but that's it for the positive. Unless you get the formule Menu, average main dish is $30 or more. Nothing extravagant for SF, but at least I would like to get a good homemade cassoulet for $34. The cassoulet was ok, but nothing memorable. I clearly do better at home. We had salad de crottin de chavignol as a starter. This was not \"crottin de chavignol\", but just \"spread\" goat cheese. Goat cheese was plain, with little flavor. Once again, it was not bad, but we do better goat cheese toast with Costco \"spread\" goat cheese. Finally, the service. We had a \"pushy\" waiter who made fun of our guest who did not order wine. Yes because not everybody drink wine, and our guest cannot drink wine at this time. Waiter did not know that, but he did not have to come back multiple time, being a bully with our guest. Really disappointing from a place where we loved to go.", "author": "Erwan L."}

How the butterflies fluttered in your stomach... how you almost went out of your head trying to find the perfect outfit... how you scrambled at the last minute, trying not to make him wait *too* long as you jammed your feets into shoes and threw lipstick and mints in your bag. Wow, that all sounds stressful as eff. But all worth it.\n\nThankfully my date and I had been out a few times with friends prior to our \"first date\", but called this romantic evening our official first date for reasons I can't actually remember. Something to do with no chaperone and it being on a Friday night. Anyhow, I still had first date jitters and was very excited that he had chosen Le P'tit Laurent for the occasion.\n\nThe restaurant is intimate and kitschy-chic: lots of French art and random items on the walls, dim lighting, burgundy booth seating. I felt it was perfect for a first date because it's not super quiet and it's a bit lively. We went at 8PM and the bar was full but our table was ready right away. There were lots of tables of people speaking French, which, to me was a good sign, because if the Frenchies of the city eat here, it must have something authentically Frenchie about it.\n\nWe both ordered a glass of Bordeaux to go along with our meals, and started off with the Escargot. It was amazing! I had never tried Escargot and my Frenchie friend Holly P insisted I get it. The sauce it was served in was still simmering when it came out in it's ramekin. Garlicky, buttery goodness right there. We dipped the warm, soft, crusty bread in it after we ate our Escargot. Yum, a definite must for when you go.\n\nI had the rabbit for my main, as I've heard that rabbit is legit and I saw an episode of \"The F Word\" where Gordon Ramsey makes rabbit ragu, so I've been wanting to try it. To be honest, I wish I had gotten the lamb or the pork. The rabbit was not bad, it was just gamey and served with a sweet potato puree which I wasn't crazy about. His rack of lamb was really good but slightly overcooked. The bed of green beans it was served on were good, kind of gingery, warm and crisp.\n\nWe didn't have dessert because we were super full, and they didn't have bread pudding, which is my dessert weakness.

This was not my best planning, however, because by the time it was time for our dinner reservation, I had fallen asleep sitting upright watching GoT, in full make up, with shoes on.  Yeah, not the best.  I was actually tempted to cancel the dinner. \n\nI am SO GLAD I didn't.  \n\nWe walked in for our reservation at 7:30 p.m. PST and LPL was packed and hopping.  The owner advised that they weren't quite ready for us, and sent us to the bar.  The bartender/server seemed slammed--it took a long time to get a drink menu and an even longer time to get the drinks.  It was understandable and also very French, so we tried to relax.  \n\nWithin 10 minutes we were then sat at a VERY good table - in the corner and out of harm's way--very private.  I know that most establishments in San Francisco are small and therefore seating is tight, but sometimes it's not so great having to sit ass to ankles when you are trying to have a private conversation or quiet dinner (for more on this topic, please see my review of Hecho).  I also get annoyed when there are empty tables but I am nevertheless sat on the laps of the couple next to me (see my forthcoming review of Kama Sushi for more on this topic).  \n\nWe started with the Ceviche and French Onion Soup.  We were on the fence about the French Onion Soup, but I had to order it because I could tell we were at a place where they knew what they were doing.  I think French Onion Soup is a hard dish to get right - but LPL knows what they are doing--the cheese was delicious and thick, the crouton was perfect and not a soggy wreck, and the flavors were on point - it was all working.  We were surprised at how good the Ceviche was -- it was perfect!  The citrus was not too overpowering, and the seafood was tender and flavorful.  \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the stuffed pork tenderloin and my boyfriend ordered the mussels and frites.  I thought my dinner was phenomenal - the pork tenderloin was, well, tender as hell.  The side dish, which consisted of a cabbage and bacon mixture, was nice and smoky --complementing the pork quite nicely.  My boyfriend's mussels were equally yummy - I could have been quite pleased with just a bowl of that white wine and garlic sauce and a side of French bread.  The frites were served piping hot with a side of aioli (upon request).  \n\nI had two (one and a half, actually) Camp-tini cocktails.  I was too tired to have drinks and was afraid of falling asleep at the table.  They were great though - pretty mild.  \n\nI'm tempted to launch into a diatribe about the odd bathroom situation I encountered whilst at LPL, but I fear it would detract from the most important part of this or any review: the food.  I will note that the girl in line ahead of me turned around to stare at me the entire time she was waiting.  It was extremely odd.  \n\nDessert looked delicious but we were full and anxious to get back home to go to sleep.  I note that there's a prix fixe menu on the back of the regular menu which includes dessert - a lot of folks appeared to be taking advantage of that option.  \n\nOverall - a great dining experience worth having.

However, the dishes of the night left a little more to be desired. \n\nI visited Le P'tit Laurent with 2 friends on a Saturday night. It passed our minds, but we should have made a reservation as we had to wait an hour and a half for a table. It didn't bother me, as none of us were in a rush, but I do recommend making a reservation especially for Friday or Saturday. \n\nAs for the food, I ordered the duck cassoulet along with 2 appetizers to share - the escargot and the fried frog legs. The escargot had a delicious garlic butter to accompany the dish; it seemed to mask the flavor of the snail though. The fried frog legs were crunchy and fresh, however, the breading seemed to be a bit thick for the amount of meat. Lastly, the duck cassoulet had a delicious, rich, but overpowering stew. The duck was very tender, practically falling off the bone, but all I could taste was the stew. It's my first time trying a cassoulet, but I was very disappointed to find that all these great ingredients - white beans, sausage, pork, and duck - were nothing more than a texture in the stew. After finishing half of the stew, the singular flavor profile became too salty for my preference. \n\nThe service was quick and attentive and the overall dining experience was decent. Although I appreciate the strong flavors and generous servings, would love to see some main components shine through the rice sauces in the dishes.\n\nAdditionally, the price rating seems to be a bit outdated. Yelp reviews Le P'tit Laurent as $$ (Under $30). It's appropriate for brunch, but in terms of dinner, most entrees start around $31, and more often than not, parties order appetizers and/or dessert and drink.

The food is edible and not horrendous so I gave one extra star. One star is reserved for the worse. You can just get better elsewhere for your money. House pate came with 2 pieces of hard as rock bread. Pate not the spreadable kind. Tomato and cheese appetizer was ok. I had the rack of lamb and it was ok. For some reason I liked the rataouille that came with it better but I didn't come for that. New York steak and french fries, steak again was just ok and so were the fries. Tilapia was also just ok. Beef stew with mash. The mash was cold. Not sure what this dish was called that was on the set menu but the beef was chewy. Creme brulee is again just ok. Ok is just mediocre and not that memorable. But the price was very memorable that I have to write this to warn people. You do not get dessert if you don't pick from the set menu. The creme brulee is nothing special so you're not missing anything but again for the price, I have high expectations of the food that this just didn't meet.", "author": "lia m."}

I had just come back from my vineyard in the Languedoc and had made a pit stop in Paris and stopped at Laurents. To my surprise when I came back to the states as I was walking on San Francisco's Chenery st. I see this quaint space that used to be a neighborhood bar and what do I see, but a bit of Paris at that corner. I walked in and Benedict greeted me in full Parisian french and suddenly I said voila I am in Paris. My first experiences at Laurents were great both the service and the food. Did Laurent adapt the recipes to be more American? sure a tad. But over all the food was always good. If you want Le Foolie then go there. That said the reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the service. Laurent works very hard to make your experience is memorable to say the least but even an old customer like me does not get treated well when Laurent is not there and that is an issue. All I can suggest is that if you are coming in for the first time or want to give it another shot make sure that Laurent will be working that night and you can be certain to have a phenomenal experience. Laurents experience and desire to serve his customers shows when he is there. After all the joint bears hi name. Best to my friend Laurent and lots of love. \n-AP", "author": "A.M. E."}

We come to this neighborhood restaurant even though it is not really in our neighborhood, because it does feel like home and the food is delicious and comforting.  Most recently wife and I came on a Saturday night for a 6 PM OpenTable reservation and the small restaurant was already almost full.  We were seated promptly and provided with menus including a good wine and a full bar menu.  The food is traditional French comfort food including cassoulets, boef bourginon, escargot, rabbit Normandie style, lamb rack, etc.  We ordered French Onion soups, sweetbreads and vegetable stew, and a mixed green salad for appetitzers and were very happy with each item.  For the main course, wife ordered the mussels and fries and I ordered the flat iron steak with wine sauce, a special.  They were both excellent, the mussels with a flavorful garlic and wine sauce, and the steak was deliciously flavorful and tender, cooked just right.  By the time we finished the main course, there was no room for dessert.  The ambience of the restaurant is friendly and lively if a bit noisy.

My favorite part of the restaurant is the d\u00e9cor - the room feels warm, friendly, local.

Their onion soup and salads are quite good as well. \n\nI had the bass filet entree, which was cooked perfectly and drizzled with a lemon cream sauce and capers.  Set on a bed of spinach, leeks and mushrooms, the fish was topped with a handful of delicately grilled onions.

Yup, that's how I pronounce \"s'il vous pla\u00eet\". Thankfully, I took Spanish and not French in high school.\n\nLe P'tit Laurent is a very rustic and charming bistrot in Glen Park. It's a tiny and pretty cramped place (good for 2-4 people only) but the intimacy really adds to the charm. Beware, this place is LOUD though. Saturday night bar LOUD so it's not good for a first date. Reservations are highly recommended as it was packed on the weeknight we went.\n\nIf you have trouble finding parking, there's a hidden dirt lot in the back of Gialina.\n\nWhat I love about Le P'tit Laurent was the very warm staff. Service was slow but our waitress, Kris was the ultimate sweetheart so it more than made up for it.\n\nI wish I could say the same about the food. Maybe we went on an off night...maybe the chef that night got too salty happy but our party of four thought almost everything we ordered was ridiculously salty. Salty to the point of being nearly inedible. \n\nBtw, sorry in advance for the fugly food pics; it was very dark in the restaurant. \n\nWe started with a dozen of oysters ($2.20 each) which was a bad suggestion on my part because these oysters had a funky bitterness to them; not a clean oceany taste that a really fresh oyster would have: http://bit.ly/156d07E.\n\nCraving a salad, I ordered a the Fris\u00e9e Salad w/ bacon & poached egg ($11) which had a perfectly cooked egg that oozed yolk porn upon cutting: http://bit.ly/169GaZu. The greens however were completely drenched in the vinaigrette like wet laundry. I lifted up a forkful of them to find a pool of vinaigrette underneath. Ugh, so much for quenching that salad craving.\n\nOthers in the group, ordered the French Soup which they couldn't finish because they said, it was too salty.\n\nTo play it safe, I ordered the most raved about dish on Yelp for my entree: Cassoulet w/ duck confit, pork, toulouse sausage & beans ($29): http://bit.ly/1aL2rLr. Oh dear, this classic French comfort dish was crazy salty. I had to take a bite of bread with each spoonful to neutralize the salt. My friend ordered the same thing and she too had trouble eating the cassoulet. The only edible portion was the duck confit meat underneath the skin because it wasn't exposed to the pungently salty bean stew. I brought the leftovers to work the next day thinking my palate was probably just screwed up that night but had to chuck it after one bite and go to the vending machine to buy a granola bar for lunch. :X\n\nDisappointed with the apps, salads/soups and entrees, we each ordered our own dessert. A highlight of the night, the Pain Perdu ($7.50) was incredibly delicious: http://bit.ly/16mjOOL. The rich french toast had this sensational caramelized edges and was served with a scoop of creamy sweet caramel ice cream. This is a MUST order! Fyi, we had a birthday in our group and the staff went out of their way to wish her a happy birthday but they didn't comp her birthday dessert. Not a big deal but I thought that most restaurants do? \n\nLe P'tit Laurent is not a place I would return to for the regular menu. I much rather spend a little more and eat at the bougie La Folie considering dinner here was about $75 pp after tax and tip (no alkie for me). However, they have an awesome deal from Sunday - Thursday. For just $20.13, you get to choose an app and an entr\u00e9e from their neighborhood menu. Just $20 and some change to relish in oh la la sexlicious French accents? YES, SEAFOODPLAY!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Especially when you're talking about an adorable and fairly authentic neighborhood French bistro.\n\nDinner last night consisted of:\n\nEscargots (obviously)\ntorchon de foie gras\nroasted rack of lamb\nvanilla bean Creme brulee\n\nThe escargots, curiously, were not served in their shells but instead swimming naked in garlic parsley butter in their little escargots dish.  Not really a complaint, but a bit odd, whenever I have had escargots in France, they seem to be served in-shell.  In any case, these particular snails were tender, toothsome, and delightfully garlicky.\n\nThe foie gras was simply divine, there's not much more to say.\n\nThe lamb was almost stupidly delicious.  We asked for medium rare (which to a French chef usually means rare) and it was perfect.  The meat was perfectly tender and flavorful, the pain sauce was transcendent.  The only downer was that the potatoes served along with the lamb were rather under-done, and a bit crunchy/crumbly in the middle.  We still ate them, make no mistake.\n\nI found the custard in the creme brulee to be a bit overly sweet, but that may just be personal preference.  I like a mildly sweet custard to accompany the shattering caramelized sugar.  Oddly all the vanilla bean specks (technical term?) had settled into the corners of the dish.  Initially I was disappointed at the lack of specks (I mean, if it says vanilla bean on the menu, I expect SPECKS goddamnit!) but my mood recovered when I discovered all the little troves of specks in the corners of the ramekin.\n\nVarious wines and brandies were consumed as well, all simply delightful.\n\nPerhaps we'll return and try the neighborhood meal some time.

It took about a good hour to decide just where to eat that night.  Once I stepped foot in LPL, I realized that it was the perfect place to be.  It is not a fancy restaurant, more like a small, neighborhood pub; intimate, romantically quiet.  We were greeted at the door with a full-on French accent.  It made me reminisce about being in Paris and 4 years of French in high school.  The most I dared to say though was, \"Bonjour.\"\n\nTheir wine by the glass was very limited, so I opted for 2 mixed cocktails:  Le Colonel, a blend of lemon sorbet, vodka & triple sec, served in my favorite glass of choice:  the martini glass.  It was tart with a little tinge of sweetness.  My second drink was, Le Pamplemouse.  An intermingling of gin, Saint-Germain, grapefruit and basil leaves.  This was not as sweet as my first drink, but nonetheless, enjoyable.\n\nFor starters, we relished the flavors of Escargot de Burgundy and Salade Fris\u00e9e w/Bacon and a Poached Egg.  The Escargot was abundantly covered in a garlic parsley butter; absolutely delectable!  The salad had large cubes of bacon, and a perfectly poached egg, all tossed in a sherry vinaigrette.\n\nOur entrees included:  Encrusted Rack of Lamb & Rabbit Normandy.  The lamb was cooked perfectly to a soft, juicy medium rare.  The delicate rosemary sauce enhanced the lamb flavors.  The rabbit was unbelievably delectable!  I would definitely return just to devour this dish again.\n\nFor dessert:  Fresh Apple Tart Tatin with Vanilla Ice Cream & Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  The apple tart was so-so; nothing outstanding.  The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good, but not the best I've ever had.\n\nThe service was great; waitstaff accommodating.  We enjoyed our many hours of dining there.", "author": "Jeanie L."}

Our friend used to live in the neighborhood and suggested we check it out and we are so very thankful we did. \n\nThe minute you walk in you feel like Scotty beamed you to France. The decor feels Parisian without even trying. We arrived early and found a couple of seats at the bar. My wife started with a glass of French white wine and me a Hine sidecar. My drink was perfectly mixed with just the right amounts of lemon and Cointreau and the brandy warmed my body on a cold San Francisco evening. My wife's wine choice was perfect and thanks to our nice bartender who helped selecting it for her.\n\nOur friends arrived right on time and the owner (who recognized our friend), came right over and sat us at a nice quiet table for four in the corner. It was the perfect place to sit and relax and catch up on life. More cocktails magically appeared at the table and we were now ready to begin our evening.\n\nThe menu is classic French and includes all your favorites. I went with the osso-buco de boeuf with polenta. I also asked for a side of French fries of course, which by the way I don't care what you order just get the damn frites! My wife shared a salad to start which I don't remember what it was called, but we both loved it! One of my favorite salads ever! \n\nOur entrees arrived perfectly paced after our starters along with a French red wine that our celebrity friend picked out. Again, I wish I could remember what it was, because it was excellent and perfectly paired with our dinner. My beef was perfectly prepared and super tender. No knife was needed at all. The polenta was a a little different than most and had a more sticky consistency and was mixed with vegetables (carrots and peas). It was delicious and I like the fact that it was more robust than your typical polenta and stood up to the osso-bucco. The menu also included rabbit which my wife orders 99 out 100 times whenever it's offered. Out of respect to Buddy, I did not sample it but judging by my wife's reaction she must have loved it.\n\nThe star of the night was dessert, \"Pain Perdu, Glace Caramel\" (Pain Perdu, Glace Caramel). It was light and flavorful and tasted like a toasted marshmallow. It was OUTSTANDING to the HELLS YEAH!!\n\nEverything was perfect right down to the service. And thanks to our celeb friend go to meet Laurent who is the owner of this gem of a restaurant. This place will now be on our regular rotation and cannot wait to go back again soon.", "author": "Rene C."}

Given it is a pretty small restaurant, however we did not end up getting seated WITH a reservation for half an hour. Luckily there was a bar where the gf and I were able to try some of their unique cocktails/beers. But I couldn't understand why they did not save us seats at a table.\n\nWhen finally seated, the menu looked delicious and it was difficult to choose. Hearing from yelp that their lamb was amazing, I opted for that while Kathleen W. dared to go for the rabbit (a first). Service was a bit sluggish, but overall kind, and I did not mind being seated next to the window as time went by.\n\nFood arrived and everything was very tasty. Lamb was incredibly tender, and a decent portion size. I had no idea that the rabbit came with so much to eat either. Definitely did not expect to really get your bang for your buck with the rabbit. Left us quite full after the meal, which I appreciated for an elegant dinner setting.\n\nOverall, I would love to come back and try more items on the menu, however was not too fond of waiting so long to get seated while having a reservation beforehand.", "author": "Brandon Y."}

He made the 9:15 pm reservation at least a few weeks before Valentine's Day, and had received a call from the restaurant the week prior to confirm he still wanted it. We arrived at about 9:05, and we were told by the hostess Ren it would be about 15 minutes until we would be seated. We walked around Glen Park for about ten minutes and returned to wait with the other 2-3 couples hovering around the front door. At about 9:35, another couple who said they had a 9 pm reservation was seated, so I approached the hostess to ask if she knew how much longer it would be. She was super unapologetic, she actually seemed borderline annoyed, and said we would be seated right now. Five minutes later, she led us to a table without any mention of it being so late. My boyfriend and I looked at each other without sitting down, turned back around, told her we were leaving, and left. Probably won't be returning.", "author": "B J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-15", "description": "LP is one of the most popular little neighborhood restaurants in Glen Park. It's WAY too popular nowadays. Some residents seem to dine there every night. That's a bit too often for me. I don't eat out everyday.\n\nAlthough there were a couple of times when I couldn't get in, and had to dine elsewhere, I've been fortunate enough to get in before. So I'm somewhat familiar with the food, traditional French cuisine. The \"neighborhood menu\" (prix fixe) is the best value. But other than that it's not a cheap restaurant.\n\nPeople read the great reviews, and want to try it. But the place is too small, and cannot handle all that level of attention. My rating is 4 stars because I've had some very pleasant meals here. But that's just for my experience. Any newbies, ignore my rating. Don't come - stay home. All the tables are usually booked. And your only chance is 1 or 2 chairs at the bar, and only right before it opens.\n\nI don't think that the owner is rude, like some mentioned. Because I've seen how hard he works non-stop to keep everyone happy. It makes no sense to try to pack more people inside when they barely can manage serving the packed restaurant they have each night. All u get is bigger delays between courses. Does he treat regulars better than newcomers? It might seem like he's friendlier, but that's only because they keep him in business. He's never been rude to me.\n\nI took this pic one evening right before the dinner rush. It's rare to see open chairs. Actually, ALL the tables were reserved. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bxs2LmE7CQqkbW7Javm22A/l\n\nThe bar area is cozy, http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kqGnStI1LJuFAUoNYIAXxQ/l\nand has a nice variety of liquors. http://media4.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SN-R825WAJs-6INzD4SKsw/l On the left side of the bar, there's an intimate corner with 2 tables. http://media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CZoOk-eq_gpJRno-8RncLQ/l\n\nMy food pics from one of the rare times I was dining here. The complimentary crusty baguette was warm. http://media2.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ojE5PGkITNa-F_4DJmGwYA/l It reminded me of Le Charm.\n\nI ordered the soup of the day. http://media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zPn-wpfgFx6a5DFVBn6mpA/l I think it was a carrot, parsnip and ginger soup. And my entree was a yellow tail fillet over spinach. http://media2.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FBmz-7ITg5vqxJNN-Rnwhg/l The week before they had steak and potatoes.\n\nFor dessert I got the pain perdu (French toast). http://media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lD1ThdM_vNg9BycAO4a59A/l Even though it was a super busy night. I remember the owner joked with me when he brought the plate, and said here's your breakfast.\n\nTaking the time to joke with customers, refilling drinks, keeping a good attitude, checking with every customer. it's rare to see that level of devotion.

Yeah very useful! \n\nBut ask me for the time or try to carry on a conversation beyond a sentence, I'd be lost.\n\nTruth be told, I'm not that much of a fan of fancy French cooking.

It's not the best, but did the job in a fix where Chinatown was so much further out of reach\n\nBut anyways, LPL is an a-ok bistro.\n\nRoquette salade, betterave et fromage, vinaigrette a la moutarde et citron\nArugula salad with red beet and goat cheese, lemon mustard dressing. This was piled on pretty high and was quite the thick salad to have\n\nSoupe \u00e0 l'oignon gratin\u00e9e - the standard French onion soup. It had a wee bit too much of a certain herb... chives? But smelled like rosemary a bit. Decent execution, except it was a tad too salty.\n\nSoupe du Jour - not pictured, but it was cream of lentil and mushroom. Good flavor and texture, but unfortunately on the salty side. Had a spoon to try.\n\nMoules Marinieres et frites - this one is a pretty fail safe order so long as the the Moules are good. Steamed mussels in white wine and garlic, with a side of fries. Mussels might not be at peak season, as the edible flesh were smaller than expected, but still quite tasty. Now the mussel juice that mixed in with the white wine and garlic sauce, was mighty good. Dipped the fries in, and this enhanced the experience greatly. Although the fries were not quite my style...\n\nSlotting it at 3.5 stars, and rounding up to include the quaint d\u00e9cor and pleasant service.", "author": "Ken K."}

I would pass on this. ~$10\nOysters- red wine and shallots. We ordered oysters although it was not oyster season but they tasted pretty good for off season! We could see the cream that was evident for off season though but I give it a pass. The red wine with shallots was pretty good but I don't see how you could mess that up. $2.50/oyster \nRack of lamb- it was too salty but was cooked OK for medium rare..  It needed to be more rare for it to be medium rare. The texture was good but a little tough. $34\nRabbit- I like my rabbit lean. My rabbit was pretty good, very lean, and very filling. Rabbits are filled with protein so it was a very good size for me. I loved the sauce as well it was not too thick. The yams were also very soft and moist while the mushrooms were nice and chewy. $29\nDessert French toast- it was covered in caramel and came with ice cream. It was the best part of the meal. The toast was a little crispy and soft on the inside. Don't pass on the toast. ~$7-8\n\nThe service:\nExcellent. They were very hospitable and always made sure that we felt comfortable and had every thing that we needed.

They have an awesome special for April that they call their \"tax month special\". $20.17 for a two course meal, and you get to choose from a few appetizers and a few entrees (except on Fridays and Saturdays). We sat at the bar because we didn't make a reservation ahead of time, but the bar is full service. I got the vegetable cream soup and the osso bucco with mashed potatoes. Both were wonderful. I ate my soup with the complementary bread and butter, and it was fantastic. The meat was falling off the bone and the mashed potatoes were the most flavorful mashed potatoes I've ever had. Service was extremely fast. We got drinks first and had dessert and were out of there in one hour (of course we could have eaten more slowly but it was so good). For dessert, I got the pear tart with vanilla ice cream. It was too sweet for me because there was caramel sauce drizzled all over it. I imagined it being much more refreshing than it actually was. The caramel just made it heavy. I'm sure that's to some peoples taste though!", "author": "Brittney N."}

Mussels were decent and flavorful.\n\nI had the escargot and the Rabbit Normandy. The snails were swimming in butter garlic herb sauce and tasted very little of snail as it was absurdly salty. The texture was like rubber before pureeing in my mouth, leaving a sort of unpleasant graininess in my mouth. I suspect hat they aren't fresh.\n\nThe rabbit was tender, but slightly dry and a bit bland. The carrots were not properly pureed and had small chunks of slightly hard bits in it.\n\nWe decided to go for some dessert to finish the dinner off. I opted for the cheese plate and a creme brulee for myself.\n\nThe cheese plate was tiny. Brie, gruier, and what looked like hard bleu with dried cranberries and apricots scattered about.

Both were delicious, and I certainly enjoyed the crusty French bread that they served in order to sop up the garlic, butter and wine.  My friend had the tax month special, a salad with fried artichoke   he also had a huge lamb shank which was delicious.  \n\nI have also had brunch here and it was wonderful, a great Croque Monsieur (which they added an egg to, which made it a Madame.)

Le PTit's soups in particular are consistently outstanding, with a taste and texture that the wife and I have yet to be able to repeat at home despite being soup aficionados.\n\nIn addition, with it's mishmash of French curiosities all about and huge, old-school mirrors, there's really not a more charming and cozy French spot around.

We were feeling a little bit fancier, so we ended up getting the steamed mussels with white wine and garlic (highly recommended) and the New York steak with the shallot and cabernet sauvignon sauce. Both came with french fries and mayo/ketchup on the side.\n\nThe mussels were really quite delicious. That sauce! Probably terrible for you, but it was the right amount of salty and savory. The steak came with a small salad on the side and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Paired with the sauce was definitely perfect. Portions seemed just right (tons of mussels, two small medallions worth of steak, which was more than enough for me) and between the two of us we were able to finish all of our food and still have room for dessert (pleasantly full for sure).\n\nAfter such a pleasant Sunday afternoon experience, we couldn't resist ordering the vanilla bean cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e as well, which was very tasty; the perfect amount of sweetness with a nice crunchy top shell.\n\nTwas not a cheap brunch. I'll give it that (we also ordered... a lot). All in all came out to be about $40 a person (before tip) for the whole thing... but it was sooooooo worth it. Would definitely go back to try their dinner and prix fixe menu, since my friend recommended it and it seemed to be very reasonable for a French restaurant. If anything, the service really made this place shine! Definitely small, could see it getting crowded, and the seats are pretty tightly packed next to each other. Still somehow managed to feel very cosy with very little space.\n\nPlaces like this are what makes San Francisco great to eat and experience! Only reason why I would brave all that traffic/lack of parking :D", "author": "Denise C."}

Within 5 mile radius you have a dearth of choice for French food.  You do have Chou Chou (which you should eschew at all cost) up at Dewey, and this restaurant.\n\nBest alternative for Twin Peaks, Diamond Heights, West Portal and of course Glen Park.\n\nThe first time we went:\nWe went on a Friday night, slipped into the last 2 bar seats by the door without reservations.  Of course we didn't complain.  Get seats away from the door.  The bar manager was excellent in serving a row of 8 diners, making drinks and managing the cash register.  She even had time to correct some of our French.\n\nShe made and poured our cocktails (nicely done),  and then regularly poured our bottle of wine for us.\n\nThe food was lovely.  Oysters fresh, the sauces for lamb, the rabbit, the duck.  All rich and flavorful.  Salad frisee had a nice mix of frisee, lardon (bacon bits) generous with the poached egg warm.\n\nWine prices average and selection average.  Menu limited but enough of a selection to have fun.\n\nOur bill, 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a bottle of wine (lowest end) $185 before tip.\n\nWe felt we found home.\n\nThe second time we went:\nThis was a Saturday night, we made reservations late so got a 9pm seating.  Kitchen closes at 10:30pm - be forewarned.\n\nDiners were leaving and the restaurant was at best half full.  The bar had 2 remaining diners.  We were seated at a table by the door even though the restaurant was half empty.  Wear a down jacket.\n\nNo waiter showed up until we got up and found a sulky blond one chatting away to a table of 6 dining (could be other waiters relaxing).  His service throughout the evening was tired, cross and petulant like a child in need of his nap or sent to his room without supper.\n\nThere was another waiter that showed up periodically to see if we needed anything but you got the sense he was just checking how far we were to leaving.\n\nThey got part of our order wrong.  The food was tepid and part of one of our entree was cold, as if whatever was in there hadn't dethawed properly.  \n\nOur bill with the bottle of wine roughly the same.  After we paid, the blond grumpy one asked if we wanted dessert.  \n\nLesson learned:  If you go, get a seating before 9pm.  Get a seat on the bar or a table away from the door.  Food is good, not worth the suffering and not worth the cold, so just adhere to the lessons learned and you'll have fun.", "author": "S P."}

Gerald Hirigoyen at Fringale, crossing Market again to create Bocadillo, Piperade. Chapeau! One word, endless pleasure.\nGreat.  French. Food.\n\nI had been meaning to get to LP Laurent for a long while, a little neighborhood place, cozy, unpretentious, like wandering out of a cool Parisian Fall night into a warmly lit bistro with food simple, but excellent and excellently adhering to a long tradition.   \n\nLaurent manages to flout and foil all the traditions and aspirations of the restaurateurs who've preceded them.\n\nWhat a dreadful place!\n\nI ordered escargot, moules, and ratatouille with gnocchi (is this even french? or italian?).  They all arrived within 5 minutes.  Together.  The escargot were hot.  Only the escargot.   \n\nAs has been said in other reviews, the snails were drowned in pesto, which wasn't great but was tasty.   The mussels had been good whenever they were made, but that hadn't been for a few hours.  Is that necessary, or even possible, to pre-cook mussels? \n\nThe ratatouille was oxidized, greyish vegetables in an overly acidic brownish tomato sauce that may have been homemade or not, but tasted like canned sauce stored in an open can for good while.  The gnocchi were claimed as homemade, which is likely because no commercial concern could survive selling these dense, sweaty, turdlets.   \n\nI eschewed anything else on the menu after these dishes out of fear of what they might've served me, then resented leaving the waiter a decent percentage on the price of the \"meal\" even though it was probably least his fault.

My fianc\u00e9e got a perfectly roasted rabbit with a lovely carrot puree. My cassoulet was full and rich in flavour, albeit just a wee bit too salty. We also had a nice merlot from Languedoc.

Several of my friends and I took escargots in appetizer, and mussels & fries as a main dish. The escargots weren't very good, and the sauce was very disappointing (I wonder if they even put garlic in it). As for the main dish, the french fries were perfect, but the mussels were suspicious... some of them we even wondered if we should eat them -- they had a distinct fishy smell, were too soft and even somewhat milky. Overall they weren't terrible (we ate them all!), but definitely not \"good\".\n\nA friend of mine got the cassoulet as a main dish, and he loved it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-19", "description": "I liked the area that this restaurant was located in, nestled in the Glen View area it was away from your usual bustling SF. It was easy to find street parking and a short walk to the restaurant while passing by little shops and a quiet neighborhood. \n\nThe restaurant it self was \"cozy\". My definition of cozy: small but made you feel warm and comfortable right away. The lighting was just right to make you feel like you have your own privacy even though the tables were pretty snug. My boyfriend and I had reservations at 6:15 and they were able to seat us at 6, there were still a few open tables left but quickly filled up by the time we started on our appetizers.\n\nFrench bread and butter was served on the house. Great french bread, naturally buttery, crunchy outside and soft on the inside. And they kept refilling our basket when we were down to three pieces.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nEscargot: It was de-shelled and smothered in garlic sauce. I was kind of disappointed that they were de-shelled, because half of the experience of eating escagot was to de-shell it yourself. But I didn't get to do that. =( The sauce it self was pretty good, my bf really liked the sauce, but I thought it was too garlicky and overpowered the natural taste of the escargot.\n \nSoup of the Day: Some sort of Chicken corn thing (I think). This one hit the spot, probably my favorite dish of the night. I didn't have too high of an expectation for the soup of the day, but this one was excellent. It had the right amount of your chicken soup flavor and it was creamy...and there was another flavor to it but I can't recall what. \n\nFoie Gras: I am a fan of Foie Gras, (but not a connoisseur) so whenever and where ever they serve it I'd always want to try it. This one I'll have to say was not my favorite. Probably mostly due to the fact that it was served cold. I find that I prefer it pan roasted just because it really brings out the aroma, plus it kind of melts the fat. However, this one was not bad, I liked that there were pieces of apple (or pear?) that was stuck into the foie gras and it gives it a bit more texture. It came with caramelized onions which was very good. \n\nRabbit: My boyfriend had the rabbit entree that came with potatoes. The meat was almost like dark meat chicken. I was expecting a gamey taste just from what I've heard. But I didn't taste it in the dish at all. It was seasoned pretty well and the potatoes were great. Nice and buttery red skin potatoes. My boyfriend liked it.\n \nVeal Paupiettes: I'd have to say by the time I got to my entree, I was getting pretty full. So my judgement may be a bit off. I thought this was just an okay dish, especially since it was one of the more expensive ones on the entree menu. I wasn't necessarily disappointed because I have never had veal (I don't think) so I didn't know what to expect. It looked like it was veal stuffed with small pieces of sausage and probably mashed potatoes and there were strips of bacon around the meat. When I eat meat, I like it prepared as simple as possible so that I can still taste the flavor of the meat. I thought the bacon and the addition of sausages took that away from the veal. All the additional items also made my dish feel more like meat loaf which I am not a big fan of. The dish came with some mushrooms and spinach as sides, they were season well but a bit too salty for my taste. \n\nAll in all the food was three stars, the ambiance was cute, I would recommend for a date night with your boyfriend if you are looking for a romantic setting (the lighting and candle lit table was nice). The waiter was friendly and funny. I noticed he came by a our table quite often to just look over our shoulders to make sure our water jug and bread basket was filled without disturbing us.", "author": "Amy L."}

You could tell they used buttering he sauce!\n-  filet of beef was nice and tender, just pink in the middle. \n-  the crab and avocado salad just melted in your mouth. The perfect ratio of  crab to avocado with micro greens of some sort. \n- my friend declared the French onion soup as the best ever but I didn't try it. \n\nFor a French restaurant the only disappointment was the profiteroles.

The Prix Fixe menu is an incredible value - soup or salad, entree and desert for $27! The house made bread is to die for! The salad was amazing - greens, mini tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, I practically licked the plate after soaking up every bit of dressing with the bread I could. I had the sea bass entree with crimini mushroom ravioli and another amazing sauce. Again, wiped up every smidgen of sauce with the bread. For dessert, French toast with caramel sauce and caramel ice cream... crispy edges, deliciously perfect and could barely finish it with this incredible meal. And only $27!!! I will be back, again and again. And the service - impeccable. I highly recommend it. And they are going to open a second one soon - I can't wait! Mwah!!!", "author": "JoAnne L."}

Unfortunately, his entree was one of the less enjoyable parts of the meal as well. He had the beef bourguignon (sp?) It was a bit bland, and just not very memorable. \n\nI was torn between ordering the salmon and the sea bass, (which was not Chilean, points for that!) On the server's recommendation, ( i think he may have been the owner or the manager as well) i ordered the sea bass. It was fantastic, cooked perfectly, LOVED the flavors, and my husband and i thought the accompanying risotto was phenomenal. \n\nWe also had some well-made cocktails, and shared the pain perdu for dessert. My husband is not usually a fan of french toast, but even he liked this. \n\nIt was a bit more of an indulgent meal than i normally eat, but it was mostly wonderful. \n\nI also like this neighborhood, it's easy to get to from where we live, and parking isn't too difficult to find. \n\nSince the peninsula is greatly lacking in French bistro food, i would definitely come back here next time I'm craving it, (but would eat less bread!)", "author": "Amanda G."}

We were so stuff that I couldn't wait to get home to unbutton my pants and lay on the couch with my food coma. I had a potato soup, oxtail, and chocolate souffle. Other people in my party also ordered the neighborhood menu with the salad, fish, and some type of dessert. I had a little taste of everyone's dish and everyone's dish was delicious, even our waiter looked delicious. The house bread was so good that we took the leftover home.

Though I've never been, something about their culture has a stranglehold on my curiosity, so in those times of enhanced intrigue, I do what I can to immerse myself as much as possible in their way of life. In this instance, I found myself in good ol' Glen Park in the friendly neighborhood confines of Le P'tit.\n\nFirst off, this has to be be one of the most comfortable French restaurants I've ever been in. It's got the laid back vibe of a warm, rustic dive bar, but with a voluptuous style that'd appease any gastronome at the same time. Perhaps that's the real essence of European style old country, but in my case, it's still yet to be seen.\n\nI had an opportunity to meet Laurent Legendre (the owner) when I dined, and he has a certain ease about him that makes you feel right at home from the second he welcomes you through the front door. The friendly salutations must rub off onto the rest of the wait staff as well, as I didn't encounter a single salty personality throughout the duration of my stay.\n\nOf course, the warm nature of the staff can only be sustainable if the quality of food and wine strikes a balance, and they certainly don't miss the mark there either. While I was less wowed by my actual entree (the poached salmon and shrimp roulade with corn cake and leek sauce), the hors d'oeuvres of warm steamed Mussels with white wine/garlic, mixed salad with fried artichoke/balsamic vinaigrette, and table side salted butter with french baguette were all quite enjoyable. Similarly, they knocked it out of the park with their vanilla profiteroles and chocolate souffle. Muah!\n\nIt's certainly a restaurant worthy of a trek, so if you're looking break out of the usual routine, I highly recommend hopping the Bart to Glen Park. Chances are, you'll find yourself making room for immediate return visits. Bon appetit!", "author": "Ruggy J."}

One of us was running late. We did give the front desk kind of a hard time, kept changing between party of 2 and 3. When we got there, we still need to wait for 30 minutes. It was a pretty small place. Of course, duck liver was banned. So we chose escargot as appetizer.\n\nWe sat down at 9pm in a big table, courtesy of the waitress. She was very nice to us, saved the big table for 3 big guys. We ordered the neighborhood menu. It was a great value for the price.

It was made with some green herbs and came in 6 pieces. We liked it.\n\nBass: The bass taste excellent. It came with rice and some veggies that included sun dried tomatoes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-14", "description": "I'm kicking myself for not visiting this place before as it is practically on my doorstep.  Being from the UK originally I've spent a lot of time in France and stepping into Le P'tit Laurent felt like I'd just walked into a lovely little Parisien neighbourhood bistro.  There was a short wait for our table, ok, actually a little longer than that and we were eventually seated at the bar to avoid an even longer wait but now we've got the only negative out of the way let's get to the good stuff.\n\nFirst off, this place is so gloriously French.  Owned and operated by the real deal there was a very high percentage of French people working there, to the point where I wondered if they were going to expect us to order in their mother tongue.  Lovely I thought, proper French people generally means proper French food.  Tres bien!  \n\nWhilst seated at the bar we started off with a glass of delicious Champagne.  No domestic sparkling wine would dare to make an appearance on this menu and I was particularly grateful for this as often the bubbly glass pour is a mediocre Napa Valley deal.  \n\nThe bartender/waitress was glorious.  She had a real Gallic streak to her, immaculately turned out, polite yet not obsequious and with a whiff of aloofness.  She was extremely efficient in the way she tended to the bar as well as serving the ten diners sat there.   You could never call the service warm and friendly but it was attentive and precise.  I was being indecisive about the food and after consulting with our host I chose the escargot and the rabbit, my partner went for onion soup and the boeuf bourguignon.  A bottle of Vacqueryas from the superbly curated wine list to drink and we were good to go.\n\nThe food was outstanding.  The snails were tender, well seasoned and swimming in plenty of garlic, parsley and butter.  The same goes for the onion soup, there was no questioning the quality, this was a top of the line soup packed with caramelised flavour and topped with tangy gruyere.  A basket of warm baguette helped soak up all the left over juices.\n\nAfter a short wait our mains turned up.  The rabbit was generously portioned with three beautifully cooked pieces laying in a pool of intensely flavoured sauce of perfect consistency and a carrot and root vegetable puree.  Perfect didn't begin to describe how awesome this dish was.  I wouldn't have changed a thing and Chef would have been delighted by how clean the plate was when it returned to the kitchen.  The bourguignon was similarly well flavoured but my dining companion found the sauce a little soupy, it would have benefitted from a little more thickening.\n\nWe topped off the meal with a cr\u00e8me caramel, a dish I was never particularly fond of.  It tends to be grainy rather than smooth and this was no exception.  I'm not saying it was bad, or not as intended, I just don't enjoy this dish.  There was no cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e on the menu or I would have gladly ordered this as it is my favourite dessert.  \n\nI finished off with an espresso and some pastis, allowing our server to choose the pastis.  I was delighted to see she skipped past the Pernod and Ricard and went for a more obscure and more delicate example from Marseille.  A glass of port was also ordered then consumed and we paid the modest bill and bid our adieus to the staff who were now starting to close down the restaurant.\n\nAs we left the maitre D came over and thanked us for our patience and said they appreciated us not being upset for the 30 minute wait and were generally impressed at how nice we were to them.  I thought this was a lovely touch, totally unexpected and sealed the deal on Le P'tit Laurent becoming one of our regular haunts.  I feel a little mean knocking off the 5th star but with the delay and the slight soupiness of the beef dish I think it is an appropriate score.\n\nAs we stepped out I was half expecting to see a street lined with Citroens and Peugeots parked haphazardly but we were still in Glen Park.  Next time we'll go midweek and try the $25 set menu.", "author": "Tony S."}

The potato soup was made with chicken stock and mushrooms so it was brown.  The cassoulet was drab like the color painted on the walls, too, and equally tasting.    Not a good sign when the only redeemable components of.the meal are the bread and butter.   Did the chef have an off night?  I finished the meal because I am a plate-cleaner, but I don't think I will revisit because there's not much value in their cooking.

I said I've read lotsof good things on Yelp about this restaurant but surprised that they couldn't be more accomodating on my request.  In the end, he agreed sticking to our reservation at 7p.m., but this \"initial\" experience is a half star deduction.\n\nFood is delicious (we had esgarcot as appetizer) and I ordered a glass of Cab, which was quite tasty.  That night, we upgraded to French Onion Soup for $2.50 more and had the flank steak for entree.  Their dessert was the best part of all (imagine chocolate souffle!!).  The other 1/2 star deduction comes from the luke warm coffee and the over salty French Onion soup.  I'd wished our soup had more cheese after all.....

He stated that the meats were overcooked, and insisted they be cooked properly.  He whisked them away, and within minutes their entrees reappeared.\n\nThe lamb chops were perfect, however, the NY steak was way too rare.  Again, the owner noticed that something was amiss, and asked if the steak needed more time on the grill.  He picked up the steak without batting an eyelash, and came back with a plate of veggies for my dad to nibble on (while the steak was recooked).\n\nWith all this switching out, and the owner's incredible attention to detail, my parents were duly impressed (and believe me, that's not an easy task).\n\nWe scanned the dessert menu, and decided on the tiramisu.

What was I thinking?\n\nWent here with a friend last night for a 'catch up on life' dinner.  We had reservations at 7:45 and the restaurant was packed.  We were seated a few minutes after our reserved time which was not a big deal since we made our way to the bar to grab some drinks.  My drink choice was La vie en rose, my friends drink was a lychee drink.  Ohhh my, I love my gin, yes I do but this drink made me love gin even more haha.  \n\nMy friend and I agreed that for an appetizer we wanted to share the mussels which also came with fries.  Yumm!  What is in that sauce?  It was divine--probably white whine, garlic and parsley.  We sat there in awe of the flavors dipping our left over bread.  Soooo good!!!  And the fries were just as I remembered it, sooo sooo good!\n\nFor our entrees, my friend had Le Cassoulet toulousain Maison which consisted of duck, pork and sausage.  She loved it!!! I had a bite of the duck and it was melt in my mouth goodness.  For my entree I had the Medaillon de porc, puree de pommes de terre, sauce a la moutarde et ananas which was pork medallions served with mashed potatoes.  I had forgotten why they were so good from the last time I had the mashed potatoes here.  Well....the menu doesn't indicate they are truffle mashed potatoes!  SCORE!!!!  Ohhhh Lord!  They were delishhhhh!!! \n\nThe waiter, whom I think may have been the owner, recommended some great red wine pairings to our meal.  They were perfect!!!\n\nAnd as if that whole meal was the end to a great dinner--it wasn't!  At first my friend and I agreed that we weren't going to have dessert because we were sooo full.  But our waiter came with dessert menus!!! Whhhhy!!!! LOL! We opened the menu and the first on there was creme brulee which was we both were craving for. I stepped away for a minute to use the bathroom and so had my friend order. She asked for recommendations and he said creme brulee french toast.  We were thinking the creme brulee was flavored french toast but it wasn't.  It came to the table and we looked at each other puzzled and said, uh oh that's not what we wanted.

The cream of vegetable soup was great and so was the escargot, while the onion soup was slightly saltier than I imagined (not sure if that was the norm). As we were eating, people stopped by a lot to make sure we were doing well. \n\nWe were stuffed by the end of the meal but decided to get desserts. I got the creme brulee and my brother got the carmel french toast thing. He loved his and mine was okay. It wasn't the worst, but I was looking for something more velvety. (not bad though). I wasn't sure if anything would have been done for my birthday as I mentioned it at the reservation, but as I was about to leave the manager looked at me and said jokingly-what are you doing? I then realized that something was going to happen. Lo and behold, (more) desserts from the table were coming to my table - two scoops of lemon sorbet (so refreshing!) with candles!. The manager stood in the corner of the small restaurant and called for everyone's attention. He brought to everyone's attention that we had not one, not two, but THREE birthdays! He introduced everyone to those celebrating their birthdays and IT WAS THE SWEETEST THING EVER because everyone sang their hearts out, waving their hands, and just being merry. It was so great and lively and just full of spirit!!!!!!!! So if this place has ever treated anyone wrong, I encourage you all to go back and give it another chance because they are the sweetest. I give them so many stars for just the great service, ambience, and experience!!!", "author": "Sophie D."}

My problem was the food.\n\nIt was OK. Just OK. I wanted it to be amazing but it wasn't. The problem seems to me to have been a light hand with salt. Oddly, one of the other reviewers I saw here noted that everything was too salty, but our meals were definitely under seasoned. My husband's calamari salad was a nice idea and it was well cooked, but the coating of the squid was bland. My fois gras terrine definitely needed more salt and so did my lamb. The only dishes that came out that we really loved were the steak frites and hubby's desert which was pain perdu. \n\nAll in all there are better French places in town serving very similar food. If I could I'd give it 2.5 stars for the charming space and nice service. But the kitchen needs to step up its game.", "author": "Mike F."}

Laurent served us and the drinks were great. We looked at the menu and right away I saw the cassoulet which is one of my favorite French dishes. I asked Laurent about it and he said that it was all house made from the beans to the duck confit. We made a reservation for the following evening. My daughters ordered the steak frites. The steak was good but the frites seemed to be just frozen fries. They were definitely not home made. As soon as the cassoulet was brought to the table I knew it was going to be a disappointment. I lived 20 years in a French country and have enjoyed beautiful French food. I have friends from the south of France and have eaten cassoulet in their homes. The William Saurin cassoulet in a can from France is 1000 times better. I have to say that the cassoulet at Le P'tit Laurent was not just \"not good\", it was horrible. In a good cassoulet, the beans are tender and white and melt in your mouth, the sausage is fresh and not overly salty, the duck is tender and falls of the bone, and the sauce is velvety smooth with the duck fat. There was absolutely none of this in the cassoulet at this restaurant. The whole plate looked old and reheated 10 times. The beans looked like they were from a can, the sauce was dark brown and salty, the sausage was inedible because of the salt, the duck was ok. Overall this was a horrible meal. During our meal, no one came to ask if everything was going well. If they had, I would have asked to return the cassoulet. We had onion soup which was just ok. The scallop appetizer was good. To top it all off, while we were still eating, the staff and Laurent moved all the tables and chairs in the restaurant in preparation for the next day. It was so noisy we couldn't have a conversation. I spent $260 on this dinner and it was the worst waste of money. Would he have served this cassoulet to a \"real\" French person?

So, despite inflating prices and uneven quality of late, it seemed the ideal place for a Valentine's Day dinner.  M.

If that weren't enough, the menu clearly stated that 18% gratuity would be added, irrespective of the size of the party (almost of the guests were couples)!  While I always tip at least 20%, I found this insulting -- was M. Laurent afraid his guests (probably 90% neighborhood regulars) would stiff the servers?  Finally, the food was . . . eh.  The lobster bisque tasted OK with zero lobster, the snails were just OK, lamb chops (ordered rare) were overdone and served with burned green beans, and a skimply portion of duck breast was ho-hum .  The only item on the menu that was better than usual was the desert plate, which featured several treats.  Without any alcohol at all, dinner for two added up to nearly $180 . . . just because it was Valentine's Day.\n\nFor a long-established and well-liked neighborhood restaurteur to screw his clientele like this is shameful and unconscionable.

Actually, I think it's cozy and warm and would make for a nice date spot.  The hostess/waitress was very kind and helpful (very French, which added to the appeal--you know, just roll with it--smile).  All the servers were delightful.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that service was slow (long time between courses).  I'm not complaining about it because I was there to catch up with an old friend, and I just figured that we were in the French mode of a long drawn-out meal.  However, you need to plan to spend a couple of hours there or perhaps inform the servers if you are in a hurry.\n\nThe food was far above our expectations.  We took advantage of the 3-course meal for $21, which was quite a bargain.  We both had the crab salad, which was good/average. I had the trout (they kindly made it with a different sauce since oyster beurre blanc is not my thing); my friend had the pork chop.  We shared, and were both impressed with both entrees.  Unlike some other reviewers, I found the seasoning to be perfect.  I really have no complaints or constructive critcism for this place (except the time committment already mentioned), which is such a rarity!\n\nI went home and told my husband that I had found a great little French place where he and I need to go on our next \"date night\".  It's not near home, but we will certainly be back.", "author": "Areena M."}

I got 7:30 reservation last night but had to wait a little bit past that for our table. That was fine. Unfortunately the table we had was a bit tight. The restaurant space is small and seems they packed tables wherever they can, especially the small ones. No big deal, this is SF with many small storefront spaces converted into restaurants.\n\nThe menu choices seemed small compared to what I recall of other French restaurants I've visited, which admittedly is less than a handful. We both ordered starters, the main plate, and dessert. I ordered the French onion soup because that's usually a must for me at this type of restaurant. Maybe I'm wrong but I thought it was saltier than it should be. Maybe I was influenced by my companion saying her tuna tartare appetizer seemed salty to her.\n\nIn the end we both finished and enjoyed our orders, but admittedly I felt the duck confit and casserole and sausage with white beans casserole had too much beans. I favor orange duck confit in French restaurants but the taste here was masked by the beans. That's just my personal opinion because I understand some other French restaurants serves this too.\n\nThe menu says it has a three-course \"neighborhood special\" for $22 on Sundays to Thursday. Since we came here in a Saturday night it wasn't available, but it looks like something to keep checking back for later in.", "author": "H K."}

The service is professional, courteous, and efficient. The prices are reasonable in relation to the expense of the ingredients. The food is worth the wait, for the most part, but some dishes are disappointing. The portions are healthy. Here are some standout selections:\n\nSweetbreads: perfectly demembraned and swimming in a rich, beefy, brothy sauce. Delicious and among the best I've ever had.\n\nPain Pardu: A custard-y bread pudding (French toast) served with a caramel ice cream. I'm not big on sweets, but this was incredible.\n\nArtichoke salad: A healthy portion of slightly over-dressed greens. The abundance of dressing was acceptable, though, and complimented the artichoke hearts nicely. This dish is bargain-priced for the effort and ingredients that go into it. .\n\nUnfortunately, there were some disappointing selections as well. The following weren't bad, but they weren't remarkable:\n\nMussels with fries: The mussels were only okay in terms of freshness. They were quite straightforward; not much seasoning besides salt. Some fresh herbs would have given it a bit of brightness. The fries had a taste and texture typical of previously frozen potatoes, which is fine with me. What was not fine with me was that the fries were not oil blanched before the final fry. This ends up making the fries soggy, with no crispiness to speak of. This style is not to my liking, but that's just personal preference. I don't think it's horrible.\n\nRabbit with green beans: The rabbit seemed like it had been braised in a similar broth to the one used for the sweetbreads, which was a nice flavor. But it's a bit boring to taste it twice in a meal. Most disappointingly, the rabbit had become somewhat dry. Not tough, but dry and a little stringy. The leanness of rabbit makes it a challenging meat to prepare, so it's not a huge surprise. The green beans were sauteed and weren't unique in any way, good or bad. \n\nBouillabaisse: Salty as the ocean, and not exactly bursting with freshness. This was the worst of the dishes I tried. \n\nCassoulet: Salty, dry and stringy. The sausage had tasty anise overtones, but was also quite salty, leaving you with a double dose of salt.\n\nI'm tempted to return and try the sea bass or the steak. But with all the other good French restaurants in the city, I doubt my return will be in the very near future.", "author": "Jeff K."}

It's always busy and noisy and crowded, but the staff seemed to be coping less well.  Our waitress misunderstood part of our drink order, took our food order without writing it down but then returned because she had forgotten part of it; our main courses came out of the kitchen before our first course dishes were cleared; an unordered glass of wine appeared at the table.  My onion soup was more than a little oversalted to my taste, and I see several other Yelpers have made the same observation.  Moules/frites were wonderful as always; didn't have cassoulet this time, but it has been wonderful in the past.  Price seemed a bit steeper than before, $65/per with 1.5 drinks.

But friends and acquaintances continue to mention this place like it is something special, so I keep checking back to see if I have completely missed something.\n\nThis last time was no different. After a good carrot soup, I had the signature cassoulet. If you've had cassoulet in France, it tends to have structure and a bit of delicacy on top of its hearty, fatty peasant ingredients. Instead, here it is a watery bowl of giant meat chunks and beans that are not blended together at all. There is no evidence of any slow cooking: the meat, duck fat, beans, and broth should congeal somewhat. And it gives you the impression that this is French food interpreted by way of Nashville. This inconsistency is consistent with all my previous dinners here.\n\nPerhaps this is what makes this an authentically French restaurant, besides the French-speaking staff. Many of the restaurants in France are hit-or-miss if not outright underwhelming, despite the dreamy images of French restaurants over in the States. Le P'tit Laurent is just as underwhelming as the many sub-par French bistros.\n\nAfter giving this place a fifth try, I won't be coming back to test any more. I know precisely what I can expect from now on.", "author": "Teddy B."}

My wife and I after an hour of decision making on Yelp decided to come here, we were more than satisfied. Our drinks were top notch, French onion soup was off the charts delicious, and my lamb shank was fall of the bone perfect. The ambiance was great too, my wife and I felt like we were in France being greeted and seated by the owner. The place was so packed we had to sit at the bar, but the second there was a table available the owner quickly came to offer us the better seat!! He was so thoughtful, it was the best service I've had in a long time....", "author": "Tony L."}

My friend and I went last night and we had an exceptional dinner.  The prices were reasonable given the high quality of the ingredients, the service was polite and the atmosphere was charming.  What was quite unique was the noise level, not too loud, which allowed us to carry on a conversation across the table from each other.  \n\nSo, we started with a frisee salad with poached egg that was so unbelievably good I almost wanted to stop at that.  My friend asked for the recipe for the dressing, while she repeatedly dunked slices of French bread into the broth.  For a main course we shared the beet ravioli and the cassoulet.  The ravioli was brightly colored, attractive and tasty.  The cassoulet was meaty, rich and mouth-wateringly delicious.  Since we were full at this point, we normally would have stopped, but I had to try the tarte tatin and was not disappointed.  My only complaint about the restaurant was that it was rather warm and humid.  Still that would not stop me from coming back here and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting wonderful French food in the charming Glen Park neighborhood.", "author": "Virginia T."}

My girlfriend and I along with two friends of ours decided to make it a double date, and we all really enjoyed ourselves and, of course, the food! I started my meal with the Escargots from Burgundy in garlic parsley butter which was incredible! I know people get grossed out by the thought, but really, this is one awesome dish! \nWhile I am drawing a blank on the name, the four of us decided to share a bottle of Chardonnay, which went so well with the \nEscargots that I thought I had died and gone to food and wine heaven! For my entr\u00e9e, I had the rack of lamb with French green beans. I loved it! My girlfriend, and our friend Evelyn had the roasted lamb with potatoes, and they raved about them. Our friend Burt had the salmon and said it was excellent. For dessert, I had the Caramelized French Toast, Caramel Ice Cream dish, as did Burt. We both agreed that while a bit unusual, we really liked it. My apologies to Evelyn that I don't recall the dessert you had, but I know you loved it. My girlfriend, Donna, had the Vanilla Ice Cream Profiteroles, Warm Chocolate Sauce and was as happy as could be with it!\n\nThe service was wonderful! The owner, Roger, came to our table, despite the restaurant being at capacity, to check on us, and the server was very prompt and courteous at all times.\n\nSpeaking of the capacity crowd, if you're looking for intimate and quiet, this may not totally be the place, unless you're lucky enough to show up on a quiet night, but even on a Monday, the place was, as I said, packed. The overall experience was so wonderful, however, I can't even deduct a star from my review!

We were actually aiming for Chenery Park a little up the street, but they were closed, so we ended up here.  The other reviewers were not kidding when they said that this place was tiny!  It really was, and the tables were so close together that you just generally had a feeling of being squished.  \n\nThe staff here were genuinely French, and our server was quick to suggest true French dishes on the menu to try, like the escargots for appetizers, the cassoulet for the entree, and the profiteroles for dessert.  The escargots at this place are probably the tastiest I've had so far.  The cassoulet was also very tasty and rich, so rich that I had to take more than half of it home as leftovers because I could not finish it.  I did not try the profiteroles, but my fiance and stepson cleaned their plates, so it must have been good.  \n\nOne other thing about this place is that the bread they serve once you sit down at a table just keep on coming.  As long as you finish one bread basket, out comes another one with another helping of butter.  So if you're a bread fan, this is your place.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the service here tends to be slow, but I think it's intentionally that way.  They definitely don't rush you as you're deciding to order, and they don't rush you to finish up your entrees and order dessert.

I also ordered the bouillabaisse...which bore a striking resemblance to the mussels, but of course had a lovely assortment of other seafood -- fish, shrimp, and miscellaneous goodies in a richer tomato-based  sauce.

Three years, and all I can order is:  Un Coka, le Frie.  At any rate, it's best to have a reservation.  \n\nThe menu has a prix fixe option if you like.  But I went a' la carte and chose the Onion Soup, Steak Frites, and Profiteroles for dessert.\n\nI'll start with the soup.  It was VERY good, but the onions should have been caramelized a bit longer.  The broth was seasoned very well, and the cheese and bread brought it all together, but I was looking for the sweetness of long cooked onions.  The Steak Frites was cooked to Medium Rare, but needed a bit more seasoning.

And now there's a full-on French place?  Note to self: must buy house here quickly, before we hit Noe-esque prices.\n\nOf course, plenty of folks still haven't heard of Glen Park, so prices are still a relative bargain.  Especially the $20 3-course prix fixe, served before 7 PM Monday-Thursday.  Just the thing to temporarily melt away your food-crisis blues.\n\nSo, as a semi-local, I felt I had to check this place out in spite of the decidedly ambivalent food reviews.  And I'm glad I did; firstly, I absolutely love the space in here, with windows on 3 sides, a bar that perfectly anchors the room, and plenty of French kitsch.  Many reviewers refer to it as \"cramped\", but to me the density just emphasized the neighborhood feel, which I much prefer to typical French stuffiness.  Waiters are authentically French, and thus...quirky, but don't be intimidated--this is Glen Park, your neighborhood (or a neighborhood that's lucky to be getting your business - either way, you can botch your French pleasantries with your head held high).\n\nAnd I really couldn't complain about any of the dishes (except for my usual rant: if I don't have to blow on the soup, it's cold).  My first experience with escargot went very nicely (perhaps because it was pre-shelled?  The texture is like calamari, by the way).  The braised lamb was as tender as duck, and the sea bass over creamy risotto...truly the way fish is meant to be.

My meal was absolutely breathtaking.  The taste was truly on point.  It was most likely the best cassoulet that I've had.  My bf was lukewarm to his dish.  Yet...dessert...oh...spectacular.  My bf ordered the pot du dreme, which was rich and decadent.  I ordered the profiteroles, which were crispy and light.  \n\nI was extremely pleased by the food and the service.

I had the neighborhood special on Thursday and the bay shrimp appetizer tasted as if it came from the bottom of the freezer. It was dressed with an uninspired cream dressing and served on a tough bitter piece of radicchio that could not be cut with a knife. I sent it back. The Mahi-mahi was also tired and dry and served with a lentil and carrot mixture that reminded my of canned peas and carrots adding nothing to the fish dish.  I met a friend who had been there with three people on Wed night and had the same experience. We have been to this restaurant in the past and found the food and price reasonable but will not be returning soon. If you do go stick to drinks and desserts and skip the  tired uninspired food.

Watching the slow progression of this restaurant from bar, to half finished exterior to lines awaiting outside felt comparable to the year I had, except mine still feels like a half finished exterior with some of the framing still exposed. Even still, every time I've seen the world YELP I've cringed and thought \"god I never go anywhere, no time, no desire... what a year.\" \n\nBut that thought process took a vacation last night as my boyfriend, his parents and his sister took me to Le P'tit Laurent. They live just a block away and though the restaurant opened some time ago his mother vowed (every opportunity she got) to not go in until they finished painting the exterior. Last night she decided was the night and invited me to join the family. \n\nTwo things to consider: \n1) For those who have not read my reviews I was born and raised on hybrid versions of Asian and Mexican cuisine. If it didn't have soy or some kind of ancho and cumin it was not in my diet. \n2) With out going too gravely into detail, living at home with the rents, and an impending surgery (minor but still surgery none the less) of one of said rents has drastically modified our diets at home and we eat virtually no salt and have switched from white rice to brown... Brown rice in a Filipino household? I know the sacrilege. \n\nMy boyfriends father however, is half french and his Hapa mother spoke french for years and thus both have a fond appreciation for the finer points of french food. With that we 3 youngins were told we'd be eating escargot. As much as I cringed at the thought mostly all the pomp and circumstance and special tools to get such a small creature out of its shell. I was also gravely concerned about the texture, fearing it would be like eating a piece of tire. But I then said to myself... \"Buck up you whimp. You're Filipina you can eat anything!\" Attempting not to express this to the boyfriends family, I went for it and found it tasted like any other shelled creature (clam or mussel came to mind minus the fishy bit) and mostly like the butter garlic pesto they put on top. The act of taking out of the shell and consuming it went unnoticed by all, crisis averted. \n\nThe bread was wonderful, the roasted tomato-asparagus soup I had was wonderful. I ordered the beef bourguignon and here's where I depart from rave reviews but I must return to my two things to consider. The meat was tender, veg were perfectly cooked but I did not entirely enjoy this dish. The issue is that I am unsure if it was me, or the dish that was to blame. Having eaten virtually no salt, my plate seemed extremely salty. I mean with every bite I took I wanted more then changed my mind as I could feel the salt bloat coming on. So tasty, but so salty. Perhaps this is how I got to know that the bread was so good. This morning I feel salt swollen and have to think of a way to get it all out of my system. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't take back the meal, I just wish it hadn't gone down like that, was it me? Or the dish?\n\nI'll go back again when the opportunity presents itself, perhaps try the chicken, which I must point out the boyfriend's sister banned me from ordering the same thing as her, why I don't entirely understand.  The service was decent, as was everything else we ate, so when I'm feeling fancy and the boyfriend doesn't want to drive perhaps we'll head there again.", "author": "Niki M."}

To be fair i should mention that we have had the good luck to eat in France...so this was a  disappointing meal because we had high expectations.  The lamb was fairly good,  but not  delicious.  In fact, the whole meal was very erratic in quality .   I kind of got the impression that the chef thinks he can cook because he is French and not because he can cook.\n\nThe soup had grainy bits of cheese, so clearly the chef does not know how to make a soup base (how can that be??  Don't all French people know how to make soup?  Isn't it in the genes?).  The osso bucco was  delicious but served barely warm. \n\nDO NOT GET THE CREME BRULEE--it was obviously made ahead --the top was COLD!!!  This also puzzles me because I expect creme brulee to be perfect in a French restaurant.  In fact, in my experience, I have found French to be exacting restaurateurs, so why this one was not... well any way the service was perfect.  Really very good attentive waitstaff, and helpful, too.

We live in Bernal Heights, and we find ourselves frequently heading over for dinner.  And finally I'm writing a review because my partner and I both said, as we walked out, \"Wow, that was an outstanding meal.\"  And on top of that, we felt that way after a very bad beginning at the restaurant (read on).  So it must have been good.\n\nIt was a chilly, blustery San Francisco evening, so I opted for the cassoulet.  It was outstanding.  Not the best I've ever had, but darn close.  And I didn't have to go to Paris or Brasserie Beck in Washington, DC.  Also, my partner had the bass, and he raved about it the entire time.  It was truly delicious.  We both also had onion soup, and again that was exceptional.  Fair warning -- you can't be afraid of salt here!  We are not, and we found everything was wonderfully seasoned.  But if you are tentative about salt, the cassoulet and onion soup in particular might be overwhelming.\n\nThe owner was friendly and recommended an excellent Burgundy wine with our meal.  He was great.  While he was serving us, we started talking about our favorite wines from Souther Rhone...and he went to his cellar to bring out a bottle to show us.  He explained why he favored this particular producer from the Southern Rhone.  Although we stuck with his original recommendation, it was an interesting discusison, and we appreciated it.\n\nOur one complaint -- and the reason I cant give this restaurant 5 stars -- is the service.  Our server took over 10 minutes to approach us once we were seated.  No water, no bread...nothing...and we were literally about to walk out when finally she appeared to ask us if we'd like water.  We've been several times, and that isn't a \"normal\" occurrence by any means.  So we cut them some slack and stayed.  And we're glad we did.

The escargots and french onion soup were just ok as appetizers. As for the entrees,  the beef in the boeuf bourguignon was dry and the white wine broth for the mussels and frites lacked flavor.

I love Bistro fare.  I love places like Cafe Claude, and Bistro Roti (R.i.P.)  I love any cafe with \"de la Presse\" in its name.  And now, any restaurant with \"P'tit Laurent,\" as well.\n\nWe went because they have a prix fixe menu which is soup or salad, entree and dessert for about $20.00.  Add a glass of wine and a nice tip, and three people, and I mean regular sized people, not Lilliputians, can have a good, filling meal for about $100.00.  This is very, VERY reasonable, for what was offered.\n\n\"What was offered,.\" you ask?\n\nWell, for starters, I had the vegetable soup.  This was a creamy vegetable soup in a chicken stock soup base.  It was fantastic.  With a nice piece of French bread and a little butter....or a lot of butter, if you're in the mood, it makes for a great appetizer.\n\nMy entree?  It was sauteed shrimp and gnocci.  Great sauce, and in a twist on the usual approach, many more shrimp, than gnocci.  What made it superb, was the inclusion of asparagus tips.  \n\nThe other entree was a pork chop which was actually pretty well prepared...but enormous.  It came with creamy mashed potatoes and some veggetables...but the centerpiece was this massive piece of pork.  It was....a sight to behold.  \n\n\"Why,\" you wonder, \"does that make it superb?\"  Well...only because asparagus and brussel sprouts are two of my favorite vegetables  \n\nAnd for dessert?  Creme Brulee...naturellemente.  I added a macchiato to top the meal, also, because I wanted to stay up until about four in the morning...both objectives, of course, were attained.  We also had profiteroles (yum) and a apple tarte which was very good.  \n\nThough we went without a reservation, we were seated almost immediately.   And though it didn't appear to be on the menu, our bar hostess made me a lemonade the old fashioned, and truly French way....she squeezed lemon, added a little syrup, and gave me the glass with a big bottle of water.  Definitely a treat.  And finally....they have the most amazing ceiling.  A tin ceiling!  I don't know what constitutes a true French Bistro...but I do know this...a tin ceiling gets the extra star.   Yep....parking (which they don't have) and a tin ceiling (which they do) account for that little extra something that I look for when dining out.\n\nIf you are in the Glen Park area....this is a place you have to visit.

Unfortunately, we had a very unsatisfying experience. \nHere is why:: \n\n1. We had to wait 1 hour past our scheduled reservation time to be seated. There were no comps, nor were there any apologies given for the large delay in time. We found this to represent a complete lack of planning on the part of the restaurant as well as lack of respect for their patrons.  And as there were 6 of us, and the interior of the restaurant is quite small, we could not wait inside and were instead left to fend for ourselves on the sidewalk. Did I mention that it was absolutely freezing outside? \n\n2. One person ordered the sea bass, which came to the table completely cold. And the reorder for this came out only lukewarm\n\n3. Two people in our party ordered the Monkfish. Both orders were overcooked, although in the case of one, half of the fish was overcooked to the point of chewiness while the other half was perfectly fine. I informed our waiter of this.  The waiter went and spoke with the chef, and was told, \"its supposed to be well done\".  I was completely incensed that he didnt believe me.. \nHow can he say that the order was properly prepared if half the order is good and the other half is bad. It seems as thought it would be obvious that the fish was not prepared well. I tried again to explain my issue but alas they were very dismissive.  I felt completely insulted.\nRegardless of whether or not they believe what I say, they should show a certain degree of respect to the client, which was completely missing from this portion of our evening.\n\n4. The second wine order we placed was dismissed by the waitress as not a good choice (They serve wine they don't feel is acceptable?) She said another wine was much better so we went with her recommendation instead.  The wine tasted like grape juice which is hard for a French wine to taste like.  I wish we hadn't listened to her.  Do not order the Languedoc 2003. \n5. We did not tip them well as we didn't feel teh experience warranted a good tip. And we were questioned about it repeatedly.  Eventually it caused a scene. And I chose to just add a bit more money so we could leave without anymore harrassment.\n\nI am completely embarrased that I hyped this place up to my friends.  \n\nThe dinner was not worth the money.

My bf got the Cassoulet which he was very happy with, being that he IS French, this was like soul food for him.\n\nPrices were great, food was excellent, staff super friendly and accommodating.  So why 4 stars?  The truth...desserts were lacking. \n\nWe ordered 3 desserts (I'm a total dessert crazed maniac) Creme brule, chocolate creme pot, and the apple tart.  All in all, were we so bummed that the dessert changed our opinions from 5 to 4 stars.  We were truly sad about it.  Because first let me say, this place is awesome, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it.  But the desserts were \"meh\".  The apple tart was cold and served on top of a wet pastry with apple slices in a weird molded mixture of applesauce. (literally tasted like Motts apple sauce to me) The creme brule was good according to my companions but it wasn't warm and the creme seemed too light to me, I like it a tad richer.  The chocolate creme was light and airy whiched suited it, and to me was the best of the 3 desserts.\n\nI highly recommend this place, as far as *true* French cuisine goes, I think they hit the mark 100% and at an excellent price to boot!", "author": "Mary R."}

The staff was warm and friendly, not standoffish as some people have said. Our table was a little awkward though, we were seated against a bench and they literally had to pull the table out completely to seat me, and pushed it back in -- essentially trapping me. \"Um... I guess going to the bathroom is out of the question?\"\n\nAnyway, the French bread they brought out was delicious and the little pot of butter made indulging quite easy. I started with the green salad with feta and dijon, my date had the French onion soup. My salad was good, if unoriginal, but my date's soup was incredible. He said it was the best he'd ever had, and coming from a sassy French boy this is a good thing.\n\nAs a vegetarian they offered me one viable entree, a radish ravioli of sorts, while he ordered the rabbit. He polished his off, while I well... didn't. My dish was an awkward combination of stewed vegetables and gummy ravioli; the flavor was good and made a great dipping sauce for the bread, but the execution was poor. Tsk tsk. \n\nThen came the grand finale: DESSERT. This was the saving grace that made the meal all worthwhile. We ordered a chocolate pot de creme and an apple tart with caramel ice cream. So good. SO GOOD. Ahhh I will come back for either of those, time and again.\n\nThe ambiance of this place was really made by the Glen Park atmosphere. I adore Glen Park, and this restaurant fits in well with the small-town vibe. The interior is borderline tacky, but the staff was friendly and the food was good (and authentic, as I was told).\n\nI would come back here for dessert and coffee, but I'd avoid a repeat of the soggy veggie entree fiasco.

The dishes are rich, but like slow eating that's also my cup of tea--I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered in my several visits here.  \n\nEven though I'm temporarily away from SF, I make it a point to stop here whenever I'm passing through the city since it's easy to hop off 280 (or BART) and to find a place to park.

Everything was fabulous, the service was friendly and charming, and the whole tap, including a glass of wine each and coffee and dessert for both of us, came to about $65. You can't do much better than this for that kind of money. They've just earned a new regular customer.\n\nUPDATE 4/7/09: Just returned for a second visit. I had the onion soup and one of the night's specials which was a terrific salmon dish that I can't properly describe but which was outstanding. My companion had beef bourgognon, of which I snagged a taste. For dessert I had creme brulee -- one of my favorite things in the world, and their version was as good as I've had. Once again, absolutely outstanding and a spectacular value. I am officially hooked.\n\nANOTHER UPDATE, 2/3/13: Brought a couple friends from out of town here the the other night and everyone loved it. Food was wonderful as always (especially the sweet potato-tomato soup and the pain perdu for dessert -- OMG!

My boyfriend had the duck confit salad (which he raved about) and the lamb shank (was a bit gamey and the au jus was a bit too salty). We shared the assortment of sorbets. It was a glass with lemon, passionfruit and guava sorbets. Very fresh and tasty. We also had a nice bottle of Heron cabernet savignon. \n\nOverall, we had a good experience and will come back. Our only complaint was the chef walked around and only spoke to select tables. He briefly smiled at us but did not ask us about our dining experience. We thought that was a bit snobby.

Our waitress poked fun at the fact that we filled up our small glass with water and saved the big one for wine.\n\n\"You must be French!\" \n\nThat was pretty funny.  (I don't look remotely French, being Chinese). \n\nShe also dusted me with bread crumbs clearing the table.  No big deal, and she asked if I was OK in a very French fashion.\n\n\"Did you receive a piece of bread?\"\n\nGood humor worth half a star. \n\nIn terms of food - I had the frisee salad with lardons and poached egg.  Not bad - I felt like the dressing and the lardons at other French places is more flavorful.  The egg was perfect.  For my entree I had the beef bourginion, which was satisfyingly rich and tender atop some creamy mashed potatoes.  The baguette was warm, crispy and maybe the best bread I've had in some time.  I also liked the little cornichon with cured meat on the table to start.  I was too full to order a dessert.  I tried a morsel of Elaine's rack of pork with apples and truffle and it was quite nice also.\n\nTotal for dinner for four (4 first courses and 4 entrees and a bottle of nice wine) totaled out at $180 including tax and tip, not bad.    \n\nI liked it - I think I enjoy the French food more at Chapeau! and South Park Cafe, but if I'm in the neighborhood again I'd come back for more at Le P'tit Laurent.", "author": "Don L."}

Nothing special but nothing horrible to report.\n\nI had the same waiting experience as other reviewers.  My 3 friends took me there for my bday, we had a 7:30 reservation on a Tues which I thought was a pretty quiet time.  It wasn't, the restaurant was full when we got there and we were told it would only be \"a few minutes\" and that we could stand by the bar and have a glass of wine.  Well the bar was full of diners and there wasn't anywhere to stand so we kept shifting around each other getting in each others (and other peoples) way.  The \"few minutes\" ended up being almost half an hour which was annoying.  I don't know the answer to this, other patrons don't want to be rushed and tossed out, but if you run a restaurant, you need to be a better judge of how long it takes to turn your tables and take reservations accordingly.\n\nThe 4 of us ordered different things and shared everything.  The mussels were good, the onion soup was OK, the asparagus soup was a mistake and needs to be taken out back and shot.   The salmon was OK but the signature steak dish was underwhelming, the meat was tough and the sauce wasn't very special.  The vegetarian dish was just a bunch of stir-fry vegetables that didn't really have any taste and my friend who ordered it said she wished she'd gotten something else.\n\nWe shared one dessert and it was very good, but they neglected to put a candle in it which was fine by me, but my friends were angry b/c they had pre-arranged it and double-checked when we got there and was pretty much the only reason they pushed to get dessert.  The next day, my friend said she wouldn't go back b/c when she paid said something to the owner/manager or whatever he said \"we don't do that here, whomever told you that was wrong\"  Um, gee it was your own damn waitress who agreed to it when we sat down.\n\nSo don't bring someone here for a bday if you want a freakin $0.05 candle in your $10 dessert.", "author": "Iris F."}

I'd wanted to get back and when friends offered to take me out for my birthday, I chose this place.  I was not disappointed at all and, after the first course, my friends, too, declared this place a real keeper. \n\nThe birthday candle in the center of my Tarte Tatin at meal's end came as a surprise,  and our co-diners at the adjacent table sang a bit and congratulated me. Embarrassing a bit, but all done in good humor. It was actually fun rather than awkward as it might have been at a larger or stuffier restaurant. \n\nThe service was excellent and charming in that special, warm Gallic style which, as many reviews here suggest, is not the overbearing friendliness Americans expect and are used to.  Rather, respectful and professional and wise.  At the end of the meal, the owner, Laurent himself, served us coffee and spoke with us. \n\nVery good traditional food, a substantial St. Emilion, old friends, an atmosphere made intimate with Gallic charm and warmth, and the flavors of divine classic French dishes such as Boeuf Bourgignon and Soupe a l'Oignon and all at reasonable prices---- dining happiness. \n\nWhat's not to love?", "author": "Tony S."}

We decided we wanted to go to a French Bistro and we did do some research. After reading about Le P'tit Laurent at a number of internet sites like yelp and Zagat, we chose this lovely place. We made a reservation via open table in the afternoon and luckily an 8:15 spot was open on Thursday, October 18. We arrived a bit early and there was not a table available. Laurent happily greeted us and invited us to have a few drinks at the bar which we wanted to do because of our early arrival. The French bartender was wonderful and attentive. One thing that needs to be understood is that everybody that works here contributes to every aspect of the restaurant. Laurent, who owns the place, cleans tables, brings delicious french bread to the guests and also will bring the food and wine. The man does not take a break and you can see how respected he is among the staff. This is a lovely neighborhood Bistro and certainly there were many regulars. Laurent and his staff treated us as though we were regulars.\n\nI started with the onion soup and my wife, the escargot. Both fantastic. Then, I had the rabbit and my wife the Beef Bourguignon. Just incredible. The portions are large so be aware that you do get more than enough. In sum, this was a wonderful experience from beginning to end and as one other reviewer said, you do not want to leave. It is small, but that is part of the charm. Hard not to fall in love with places like this and when you have a French owner with a French staff, you have a winner. \n\nThank you Laurent.", "author": "Giovanni S."}

It has a nice authentic, cozy feeling....like you're sitting at a restaurant in France.  I'm not sure how they do it, but their servers also magically have French accents.  \n\nWe walked in on a Sunday evening and it didn't take them long to seat us.  They have a great pre fix menu for $22 (appetizer soup or salad), main course, and dessert).  Their menu changes weekly so I'll only review what we had.\n\nFirst course:  \n-  Beet salad with goat cheese and arugula was not what I expected.  It was okay at best and because I substituted the goat cheese for blue cheese, that may have taken away from what the dish was supposed to actually taste like\n\n- Roasted bell pepper soup was decent, but nothing to write home about. \n\nSecond Course:  \n- Chicken with mashed potatoes was pretty good.  It was a large serving with vegetables served on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes\n\n- Halibut with some type of creamy white sauce was very good.  The fish was a little on the dry side but with the sauce, it was worth coming back for.\n\nDessert:  \n-  Vanilla profiteroles with warm chocolate sauce was pretty good.  The texture was just right and the serving size, 3 pieces, was enough to share\n-  Bitter chocolate cake with coconut ice cream was the best part of the entire meal.  It's not really a cake, more of a mousse consistency.  I usually hate coconut flavor stuff but the ice cream was actually very good.  Both flavors complemented each other really well.    \n\nOverall, both desserts were worth coming back for. \n\nThe meal was $22 each for 3 courses so it's definitely a place I'll be coming back to!

Both of these portions were very hardy and incredibly good. This is where the butter in every bite comes in. The food was so rich, a small portion would have been fine, but with a larger portion...well it was even better! Our portions were big enough that we almost couldn't finish...but not worry I did!! Our wonderful waitress also was kind enough to recommend wine by the glass that would match up well with what we were eating and actually set us up with some of the less expensive wines. They were both very very good. I'm a sucker for wine and told her that, but she said that the wine that goes best with our dish happens to be less expensive. I love that I had sucker written on my forehead and she didn't go in for the kill.\nThe desert was the only thing that wasn't incredible, but it was still good. I had Creme Brulee and it was just OK.

(touche!) DO make reservations if you are going, otherwise, you will just be another of the hoipolloi, and did I mention they are too good to offer beer at the bar? Well, they are.

Gina, our bartender/server was a special treat - bubbly and fun and right on top of things.  We had a reasonable bottle of a French fruity semi-dry red wine recommended by Laurent - quite nice. We tried the sweetbreads (perfect - and the sauce was heaven sopped up with extra bread afterwards) and tuna tartare (though a bit spicy and too many bell peppers for my taste - good nonetheless).  Then we had the salmon (again  - wonderful sauce and creamy texture cooked to perfection); lamb (nice portion, again tasty and cooked just right with a olvely sauce - though again had some veggies - zucchini and bell peppers I could do without), and the caseole (great sausage and duck with white beans ...) and dessert - pot de creme was heavenly, apple tartin was good and special with the ginger touch, and though the profiteroles we well portioned - I was not crazy about them - but not bad.\nOverall a wonder experience at a fraction of what most French restaurants would charge for the same - and in a fun, cozy neighborhood place - though way tiny and crowded - we went with the flow and the bar seats and service turned out to make it even more fun.", "author": "Jeff H."}

No reservation but got a pair of seats at the bar right away. Tight fit but very comfortable, excellent bar stools.\n\nThe menu is very traditional french bistro style food. This is not a bold gourmet cuisine experience -- the dishes you'd expect to find are mostly here. We ordered basics and were enthusiastic about the choices nonetheless.\n\nAppetizers: A decent start.\n - smoked salmon salad (special). overall attractively done and my wife found it very good.\n - frisee salad. fairly tasty but over-dressed, which makes the frisee wilt. still this was perfectly fine.\n\nMain Courses: Again, very inconsistent.\n - lamb flank: my wife was very disappointed. the meat was oddly tasteless, and the sauce didn't do much for it at all. \n - bouillabaisse: best dish of the evening. very nice assortment of prawns, scallops, white fish, salmon, and mussels. the base was herby and fresh tasting, and the fish was nicely balanced by chunks of potato. a classic dish and well done.\n\nDessert: A very poor ending.\n - apple tart: This french specialty should be a softball they hit hard. Instead it was terrible. The pastry was burnt and the apples were soggy. Overall it was disgusting and bitter.\n - profiteroles. Mediocre. The pastry was oddly crunchy and flavorless, and the balls were filled with bland ice cream. \n\nGiven how competitive a dining market San Francisco is, and how consistently poor-to-average this food was, I am surprised how this place is crowded every night. The fixed price menu ($21 for 3 courses) is attractive, but we didn't have that choice on a Friday night (our meal was about $120 with no alcohol). Perhaps, some might say, we were just unlucky, and should give it another try. I'm sorry to say I won't.

All of those times the owner had been on the premises as maitre'd - he is a great guy, very charming, and takes good care of his customers.\n     However this time he was not there. In his place was an incredibly snotty French woman. First, she opened late while people with reservations were standing around outside waiting. No apology from her, nothing. When she opened, the first thing she did was welcome a friend of hers with kissy face, take flowers from her, and not even acknowledge the guests. She finally got around to sitting people. Then we sat there for FIFTEEN minutes in an empty restaurant, waiting for someone to come over to our table. She and the bartender were 5 feet away, completely ignoring us and chatting to each other. I finally got up and went to the bar and asked if we could order a drink, at which point the Frenchwoman gave me a truly dirty look. Pardon me for interupting your little tete-a-tete! She came over to our table twice during the meal and was truly toxic each time.  \n     When friends of hers came in to the restaurant, she was all kissy with them, but with any diners she didn't know she made faces and was unpleasant.\n     If Laurent does not get rid of this woman they are going to lose customers.

It's certainly is as good a choice as any, but its small, and noisy.  However, the atmosphere seems very French, having just been to Paris, its not unlike some of the over-rated French restaurants.  What do I mean by that, for starters, actual Parisian Restaurants are crowded noisy affairs and not as great as we've been lead to believe.  You can get decent food, but you pay too much and are often encouraged to hurry up already so others can get in.  If you are willing to spend say, a whole month's paycheck, you can get some incredible stuff in Paris, but other wise, its a lot like Le P'tit Laurent.  If you live in Glen Park, be grateful that you've got a cute place that serves decent food.  However, I live in the Richmond District and the only reason we went over to Glen Park was to see Laurent himself.  He's a very charming and hardworking man.  I hope his business does great things for him.  As far as his servers go, my husband liked the women there, and he speaks a little French, so he had a good time with them.  As for me, I couldn't have cared less, but they were adequate as servers.  The big Norman waitress (big up front) almost drove my husband into fits of lust, but I just rolled my eyes.\nShe's very funny otherwise.  We will probably wander back there occasionally, but it can't be a main stay for us, its just too much to travel and if you are going to drink any wine, not a good idea to drive.  But I think you should try it.  Make reservations PLEASE, all it takes is a call, why is that so hard for people?  if you even call 10 minutes before you think you want to go, why don't you?  I can't help but wonder about the people who whine that they got a cold shoulder when they didn't have a reservation.  If I don't have a reservation, I will sit at the bar, I'll wait until there's room, and I won't whine.  Oh, its helpful always to learn a tiny tiny bit of French.  Just so you can greet the staff.

Le P'tit Laurent (The Little Waiter) has a genuinely first generation French staff, a top knotch chef, and always an incredibly deliscious menu. If you want to sample true French cuisine--I mean soups and stews, fish and steaks, breads and cheeses, and desserts--you should definitely reserve a table in advance. This place is great!

Sorry, honey, but don't you know California wines have kicked the French's butts in two tasting competitions recently?  \n\nBut I don't care about this as much when the food is so good.  My rabbit was literally almost as good as the rabbit I had at La Folie.  That is saying something because La Folie is 5X as expensive.

We've had lackluster bistro food, a brunch visit where the english muffin in the the eggs benedict was not even toasted (some kind of french/english rivalry?).  My husband and I went last night  for a one more chance visit;  the bordeaux and cassoulet were pretty good, but onion soup was overwhelmed with oregano and the bouef boeuf bourguignon was tough - needed much more simmering.

Because its so small and it was packed there was only one seat available and so one of us had to stand. We wouldn't have minded the wait had they given us a complimentary glass of wine or appetizer, or something. But, nothing, and cause it gets hot in there (b/c so small) the door was open and so we were standing in a draught too.\n\nAnyway, we eventually sit, the waitress is friendly enough but by this time we were starving so a bit quicker would have been preferable.\nFood: I ordered snails - they were alright, nothing special, the sauce was a bit overpowering. My companion had the cured meats. I swear, they were like something shrink wrapped you could get at the deli; rubbery and bland.\n\nEntree, I had the beef Bourginoin (sp?) and i was SO disappointed. There was far too much sauce and too little anything else. The beef was alright, there was no  medley of flavors hitting my tongue though. The mash potato was a JOKE! I think it was the instant stuff. It was thin and they were not generous with the portion. I make it better at home and i am no chef. \n\nMy companion had the lentil stew dish, and  enjoyed it.\n\nChocolate mousse for dessert, again, nothing special, it was too solid, not light and frothy and it was very cold, as if delivered straight from the freezer.\nSo, all in all, not a place i will frequent, but it could have been a one off bad experience, and since my companion enjoyed the entree, I will probably give it another try.

The rabbit was good but not great and my boyfriends lamb shank had a strange consistency although the flavor was good.

The food is decent bistro fare and I have been twice. The owner was friendly and very accommodating. But I believe it helped to have fluent French speakers at your table. Our first time the service was great and the bill was big (for 8 people, three courses, and several bottles of wine). The waitress (the same one both times) was very helpful but not pushy. \n\nThis second time (n= 6) we had one French speaker at the table and when she asked in French \"Does anyone else speak?\" and our friend said \"no\" the waitress proceeded to say to him in French \" Let's make a game of making the others try to pronounce their dishes in Francais!\" What I find a little demeaning is when she corrected the pronunciation of all the guests and then wouldn't leave us alone till two of us had perfected saying  \"Beef Bourguignon\" several times. We didn't order a first course nor much wine and that pretty much left us unattended for longer periods of time than other customers. When one person ordered a steak well-done she insisted he have it medium-well several times and brought it to him that way.  I'm all for helpful suggestions and meat med-rare is my preference too but to just plain ignore a request from the customer is rude in my book. Overall I think it is a nice addition to have a bistro in the neighborhood but expect to be treated differently depending on how much French you speak and how much you choose to order. Perhaps that is the nature of all eateries but for this mid range neighborhood, there was too much attitude and not enough excellent food to back it up.", "author": "Jamie C."}

We went on a Saturday night and the service was awful from the start.  It took 30 minutes before the waitress took our order.  The table next to us also had to wait a long time.  The New York steak was cold and the butter couldn't even melt it was so cold.  The french fries looked and tasted as if they had been reheated several times.  The waitress was no where to be found.  We finally flagged down the bus boy and told him in Spanish our food was terrible and he replaced it.  The second time the food was cooked properly and was Okay, but nothing to write home about.  Le Zinc on 24th Street and Chou Chou on Laguna are MUCH better French restaurants.  The table next to us waited 45 minutes for their food to come out.  When they complained to the waitress she said \"that is the french way\"  They were Indian and had specifically asked if the Scallions had bacon.  They were told no and the Scallions did have bacon.  They were celebrating a birthday dinner and the person paying couldn't eat his dinner.  AGAIN, no waitress to tell about the problem.  Another table had the waitress spill carmel on her shirt.  Finally the waitress came by our table and I was able to tell her about the first steak being terrible and that the busboy had helped us.  The table next to us just wanted the bill.  They waited another half an hour for the bill.  When the waitress came with the bill she said \"I hope you enjoyed  your dinner\" and they were finally able to tell her they didn't because the Scallions had bacon.  She just smiled and said thanks for telling me.  Then she came back and told them they would take the meal off the bill.  They had to wait again for another bill.  This is the worst place I've ever been to.  There are so many French restaurants in the city that I would advice anyone to skip this place and go to either Le Zinc or Chou Chou.

The soup of the day was a tasty puree of spinach, leeks, onions, and carrots.  According to the menu, the salad featured rock shrimp --- something you rarely see on menus here in California.  However, when the salad was delivered to our table, it appears that they had perhaps run out of the rock shrimp, and were just using regular shrimp instead.  (Oh well, we're not in Titusville, Florida).  For the entrees, we had the pork chops, a lamb shank and the bouillabaisse.  Overall, I rate the food a solid 3.5 stars.  The highlight of our meal was our delightful waitress named Fleur (who also doubled as the bartender and hostess).  Fleur is such a lovely French name, don't you think?  Truth be told, Fleur only speaks a few words of French, and actually comes from the Derbyshire area in England.  Nevertheless, her charming personality very much enhanced our dining experience.", "author": "Don N."}

Luckily I had made reservations! The decor is pleasant and quaint--ranging from cottage on one side of the restaurant to \"under the Eiffel tower\" on the other side. The food was incredible! I had sweetbreads for my appetizer and the huge lamb shank for my entree. Others had appetizers of potato chip covered scallops, mussels, and salads. Everyone raved! I heard the cassoulet and the rabbit are superb too. The prices are very reasonable as is the $14 corkage fee. I had sorbet for desert. I'm not sure if its homemade, but the strawberry had too much orange zest in it for my taste. The peach was good though. I believe this is the same person who used to own Clementine before it was sold to Chapeau. Definitely worth another visit!", "author": "Gabriella M."}

First of all the three course dinner offered daily is delicious and very reasonable at $20 or $21 a person.  Good choices for each course and each excellent.\nIt is very crowded so you really need a reservation and parking around there is challenging.  But anything worthwhile is worth the effort.  \nOne reason this restaurant hums along nicely is that the owner is there all the time, at least every time I have been there, and that is frequently.  He goes around to each table and carries on a nice and brief conversation. ( I hate it when the owner or waiter decides to make you their new best friend.)\nSave yourself the aggravation of a snooty French restaurant when this one is friendly and good.  Going to Paris is great but Le P'tit Laurent is a nice consolation prize.", "author": "Sally F."}

I am seven months pregnant and when I told my friend I needed meat, she brought me here.  The braised lamb was DELICIOUS.  Service was nice, and reminded me of some of the small bistros I've dined in, in France.  The only complaint is that the restaurant  is quite cramped, in more ways than one.  Admittedly, most seats don't feel very comfortable at the moment, but I really was having difficulty settling down with my big belly, they were pretty small.  Also, the restaurant was so packed with people that it was hard for me to squeeze between tables to get to the bathroom.  Because there were so many people in there, it felt like the temperature rose 10 degrees.  By the time I got outside I was really welcoming the foggy, breezy air, again, to somebody that didn't have loads of progesterone running through their bodies, they may not even notice.  Over all, great restaurant, I think I will try and make a trip back after my hormonal chaos settles down, I don't have to lean over to make sure food gets in my mouth (and not on my belly), and I don't overheat from chewing to much.", "author": "Jessica D."}

The owner of the restaurant, Laurent, used to own Clementine which is where my husband and I got engaged.  We told them that and they gave us free cocktails and wine all night (who knows, they might have done that for others since it was their opening night, but it made us happy!).

Oh how I do regret of not having been more thoughtful and plan ahead making the Chapeau reservation earlier. \nIf you only look at the menu the food looks like a good value. However, after you actually ate it, this first impression fades because the quality of the food is just  not there. I had escargot as an appetizers which was OK. The bread was good though. My main course was a rabbit on a bed of mashed potatoes. Tasted OK but very poorly presented. Desert was also OK. \nIf I were to rate the food alone I would give it two, maybe three stars at best. However, the reason this restaurant does not deserve more than one star is because of the horrible, rude service and the noise level that requires constant yelling so that the person on the other side of the table has a chance to hear what you say. I expect the latter issue to go away over time because the number of \"patrons\" will certainly go down.", "author": "Oliver G."}

It was so exciting to see a place like this open in Glen Park, but looks can be deceiving.  The restaurant looks cute and cozy with lots of nice detail and is often packed.  My husband and I went for dinner and loved the atmosphere and the service.  The place was already full by 6:30 p.m. so we ate at the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  However, the food was not impressive in the least.  I ordered the crab asparagus salad and the beet ravioli.  The salad came with no asparagus and mushy, fishy tasting crab that was more like canned tuna than anything else.  I only had two bites and hungrily looked forward to my main course.  When the beet ravioli came, it was missing the parmesan listed on the menu and looked soupy and full of gray vegetables.  But I dug in anyway.  My first bite of ravioli was, well, odd.  It was very doughy and chewy.  Another bite, and I thought maybe it was undercooked.  By the fourth bite, the raw flour taste came through clearly and I realized they were indeed raw.  Maybe they thought the hot broth would cook the ravioli, but it didn't.  I gave it back and they offered me a free dessert.  The cheese platter I received was fantastic, thank goodness.  So I filled up on bread and cheese.  My husband ordered the neighborhood menu and his food was fine.  He got the mozzarella and tomato salad, the pork chop and the creme caramel.  They were all fine, but nothing to get excited about.  In the end, although I really wanted to see this place do well and was excited about the Clementine connection - my meal sucked so bad I won't be back.", "author": "Catherine H."}

We want to like the idea of authentic French bistro food within walking distance of our house, who wouldn't! Lots of people like this place, it's usually full. The meal for two was: oysters, followed by a crab and asparagus salad, then a bass served over potatoes and leeks, and a 'vegetarian' dish of beet ravioli.  The oysters were fine, then it went downhill from there. The crab was not any kind of crab I am used to, and had a mouth feel more like canned tuna fish, the asparagus was one limp stalk. The bass was mostly skin, although nicely browned and with a generous dollop of fresh herbs, it came across like a miserly portion, despite its presentation. The ravioli was just weird, two oversized, flat, grey doughy things stuffed with what we assume were beets.  So that's the deal here, looks like, sounds like, walks like authentic bistro but mon cher, believe me --  we can do better.", "author": "Mark P."}

Everyone was so sweet; although there was no table for us, we dined at the bar and were deliriously happy with the food.  And the value was amazing. The $21 prix fixe menu was tasty and satisfying, with a rose vin de provence was just right and complemented our meal.  We started with a perfectly seasoned creamy spinach-butter lettuce soup, in a chicken stock base that hit the spot on a cool evening.  Next we had prawns with a fennel puree in a rich yet light tomato sauce that was refined and oh so good.  Not to mention the bread with such a nice crispy crust.  Dessert was also outstanding; my date/husband had the warm apple tarte, and I had lemon sorbet drowning in vodka (le p'tit Laurent Colonel).  A great deal and a great meal.
