I was here with a buddy and we ordered:\n\nEdamame: Didn't taste fresh. \nGyoza: Just OK but best part of a very disappointing meal.\n\nCrab special roll: This roll was disgusting. The crab was bland and it just tasted like a fried piece of mush in between some cucumber and rice. This roll tasted like something you would get out of a buffet that had some sushi on it.\n\nVolcano Roll: Actually, this roll was worse than the crab roll. A typical volcano roll has spicy tuna on top (hence the volcano in the name) of a shrimp tempura roll. The roll served was a California roll with a glob of spicy mayo that was baked. I literally peeled off the quarter inch mayo layer to eat a few pieces and just couldn't anymore.\n\nMy buddy had a simple tuna avocado and salmon avocado and I should've just kept it simple. I felt nauseous afterwards as well. I hate giving bad reviews but sometimes, they're warranted. As is the case here.", "author": "Alex B."}

Overall this place is too expensive for what they serve. And sometimes it takes an absurdly long time to get your food. I waited 40 min for two rolls the other day and ended up having to take most of it to go because I needed to head back to work. Service is also lackluster. They're friendly enough but move very slowly.

After grabbing an OpenTable reservation, we were promptly seated, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sushi.\n\nI ordered the 12 piece chef's selection, which included three cuts of tuna and uni (sea urchin), and a delightful sardine. My son ordered a couple of rolls and crab nigiri, and one of the staff (not our waiter) came over later to offer him king crab instead, which he got and was very happy with. (They also offered me live uni, which I declined!)\n\nAlthough there were 4 people working the floor and our waiter was just busting his ass the whole time we were there, the service was a bit slow and disjointed. There was confusion about dessert and I did get a bit antsy waiting for our check. The restaurant fits 45 people max, and there were about 40 people eating while we were there, but it seemed more of an organizational issue than a too few staff issue.", "author": "David Y."}

My boyfriend and I then shared 3 rolls: the Dragon, the Volcano, and the Spicy Salmon/cucumber. The Dragon was amazing! It was cooked very well. The Volcano was a bit of a mess. It's hard to separate the rolls since it comes in one clump. It tastes great, but it's hard to eat. I wouldn't recommend it on a first date.

Coworker had the beef teriyaki donburi.  \n\nEach meal came with green salad and miso soup.  What struck me was wow the salad dressing was heavenly!  It wasn't your run of the mill watered down soy dressing.  It was full of flavor and actually had body to it.\n\nTasha the owner came by several times to say hi and check in on us!  Pleasantly surprised to find that she opened the restaurant due to her own allergies and because of that they don't use MSG and offer a full gluten menu with 12 separate cutting boards in the kitchen!\n\nBack to the food... Ok I have not had broth this heavenly in a very long time.  Probably not since living in Japan.  My nabeyaki came with tempura that was light & flakey and a big healing bowl of my soba.

Plate presentation is perfection and with that, Mikaku is the ONLY place I can find quality Vietnamese Jasmine tea served in a cast iron tea pot. \nService is constantly attending to our needs, and even take the time to pour your coca cola for you. From begining to end, this place is  top of line. \nAs, a 5 star Hair Salon Manager, I can appreciate the best of the best! Hats off to Mikaku.", "author": "Camie L."}

The chef was really nice and even let me taste some uni and it was reaaaally good and fresh. The guy next to me at the bar was delighted to and made several comments about it. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!

Also, the portion is plentiful; perfect for sharing. \n\nBeef teriyaki: comes with a side of rice, which is perfect with the sauce. Beef is not completely cooked through, so if you're a fan of that, definitely order this! This is also quite large and good for sharing.\n\nThe portions aren't plentiful for the price.

Absolutely delicious warm roll, cooked to perfection! \n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere was definitely more on the classy side compared to most of the sushi places I've been to so far. The chopsticks were a reusable dark wood, the tables were candlelit, and there were high ceilings and tasteful decorations. The back wall was a screen for a little projector that was a little hard to see, so I'm not entirely sure if that's an always-on feature or not. The music was also a little out of place, with mostly Top 40 hits being played. \n\nService: The service was great! The manager came over to check on us a couple times and the waitress was nice and pleasant. Our water glasses were always being filled and the empty plates were removed on a pretty regular basis as we finished off the rolls. \n\nFood: The food was the best part about the meal. We got 3 rolls to share: the Volcano Roll, the Swamp Roll, and the Lemon Sake Roll. The Volcano roll was definitely the best, with delicious topping and a well-made California roll. The second-best was the Lemon Sake Roll, which had super-thinly sliced lemons on top and a very distinct flavor, even though the Lemon and Volcano rolls shared the California Roll base. Finally, we had the Swamp Roll, which was a Tuna and Onion roll topped with a bunch of seaweed fibers. It was hard to eat and the seaweed was a little overpowering, but it was still a pretty decent roll. I don't think I'd recommend it though.\n\nRecommendation: All in all, I thought it was a great experience at Mikaku. I left feeling full and content with the food, service, and atmosphere.

Extremely meticulous and patient, cutting the smallest blemishes off of the fish and ensuring perfect size and shape to every roll and plate. Needless to say, it was very entertaining to watch!

The menu states that all these dinners come with miso soup and salad.  We also ordered three orders of Uni sushi and several other dishes.  They brought two miso soups and salads, saying the other was coming.  Nothing came.  When asked about the third soup and salad, the waitress said, \" You get the soup and salad only with the Sashimi, not Chirashi.\"  I got the menu and pointed out that all the dishes were supposed to come with soup and salad.  Then the waiter said, \"But you ordered only one Sashimi and one Chirashi!.\" Finally, she admitted she made a mistake.  She need not have- the miso soup was room temperature and undrinkable!  She finally heated them up.  Then came two orders of Uni, though we ordered three!  Another mistake.  Then came the two orders of \"Sashimi\" and the Chirashi.  However, the \"Sashimi\" was actually assorted Sushi (the small amount of rice of each piece was covered by a rather large piece of fish)! The waiter in a Japanese restaurant surely knows the difference between Sushi and Sashimi?  I had to call her again, and she took them back, saying she had \"pressed the wrong button.\"  Now the food itself- in a word \"Meh.\"  Last time we visited, the sashimi/chirashi was very fresh.

It has a pretty casual atmosphere and the wait staff is very polite and professional. They are quick to bring out your order, quick to refill your tea, and quick to clear out empty dishes. I wanted an MK vegetable roll, but they were out of some of the ingredients, so instead I ordered vegetable tempura and a couple of avocado rolls. The food was good, but the rolls were a bit small. Prices are a touch higher than some of my favorite sushi places, but not too bad considering the location. Overall, pretty good experience, and I really appreciate that they stay open so late.", "author": "Maria E."}

Let's be honest, in a competitive market... scratch that... uber-competitive market like San Francisco, the law of the jungle applies to every single eatery. If you don't bring something special to the table, you go toes-up in about three months. And when it comes to the Bay Area's favorite foods, which anecdotally but undeniably seem to be burritos... burgers... and sushi... take the difficulty level up a notch from \"Hurt Me Plenty\", past \"Ultra-Violence\", and straight to \"Nightmare\". It's gonna be a street fight for that prime location.\n\nSo when my friend suggested sushi, I was 100% on-board, and I pretty much knew that the food would have to be good. And we were in the Union Square area so I knew that the venue would probably be cute. Sure, tourists say that they like the \"real\" San Francisco but then they end up at the bar at the W (not hating, one of my favorites) and not in the Mission in a dive bar.\n\nTherefore, since the quality of the food was virtually a guarantee (and it was good), and the aesthetics of the venue were a safe bet (very cute), the only remaining factor is customer service. Here's where Mikaku earned that fifth star.\n\nThe matriarch of the restaurant chatted away with my friend, with whom she had become acquainted previously, about the topic of sake. We were all indecisive about our choice, at which point she threw together an impromptu sake tasting, allowing us a sip of her three favorites, until we chose the perfect compliment to the meal. Shortly thereafter we met Sabrina, who was to be our server for the evening. It was clear that she was having a rough day, however it was equally clear that she was in no way going to let it impact her ability to be on top of her game with us. We chatted with her, confirming that it was a tough day with some rude customers being unnecessarily mean to her, and yet she was STILL one of those most pleasant and friendly waitresses I've experienced in the city. Growing up in a restaurant, I get how hard the work is... so ten gold stars for rallying and doing a spectacular job in the face of jerky diners. Probably from the South Bay. Ugh.\n\nSo if you're looking for a cute little venue with a nice design, super-friendly servers, and a nice selection of fresh sushis and delicious sakes, and you should be, then this is your new place.", "author": "Sean B."}

So yum and worth it for $14\n-Goma Ae: Gently boiled spinach with sweet soy sauce and bonito flakes, great portion for $4\n-Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab: Whole crab deep fried to delish perfection, not something we'd order at home. But something different we had to try it.\n-1/2 Dozen Kumamoto Oysters: Fresh  oysters topped with masago, green onion and ponzu sauce. Be warned, they are baby oysters!

My boyfriend and I were originally going to go to a Latin American restaurant until they told us it was a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm. We were walking back to our hotel when we found this place. We walked in and really liked the atmosphere of the place. Dim lighting, nice decor and a decent noise level. We decided to give it a try. The restaurant was packed, so we decided to sit at the bar.\n\nWe split 5 rolls amongst us two. We got shrimp tempura, spicy salmon, crunchy California roll, California roll and an avocado roll. We were surprised by how much food we got. Generally, when I order sushi, it's 6 pieces in a roll. We got 8 pieces each on two of our rolls and the crunch California was 10 pieces. The sushi was also delicious. Quantity was there and so was quality. The crunchy California roll must have been the best roll I've had in my life. Something about it being fried makes it so much better than the original.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the service. When we sat down, we immediately got waters. After we decided what we wanted, it took us 10 minutes to flag someone down to take our order. It seemed like there was only one person really working there. There were a few parties who were finished at the same time. This one guy rushed to their tables to clean up the space and seat the waiting guests near the door. Everyone else was chilling in the back, laughing and enjoying themselves. I feel bad for that waiter. He's the only good one. So just fyi, you'll need to ask if you want something, because unless you get the awesome waiter, everyone else will be slacking.\n\nOverall, great place. Loved the atmosphere and the food.

I started with always-first-for-a-new-place tekka maki (not sure it was even on the menu, but no one seemed to care) -- fresh, firm, well-cut tuna in an art form that master sushi chefs take decades to perfect -- these guys did a pretty good job on that exacting standard.\n\nThat test complete, I sampled some or my partner's salmon teriyaki (not overcooked, moist, and not over-sweet either), and then dove into the house Dragon Roll (crisp, well-portioned, good seasoning), followed up by a very clean miso soup. I was pleased with both the speed and attentiveness of the service during what was probably a 3/4 full night.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, it feels slightly classy, but relaxed.

You should be using sticky rice for this or roll it better so that it sticks and not fall sort as soon as I pick it up.  I just looked at the receipt and wondered why I spent $22 for lunch. $14?! For the quality? I feel ripped off. Also, the crab meet I think was the crab stick and not shredded. It literally looked like pre lacked sushi from Safeway.

This was the second stop on our sushi hunt and needless to say, there was no comparison.I only wanted to try their Uni, Kenpachi and Ami Ebi nigiri so this review is only based on those 3 items. \n\nKenpachi - The fish wasn't bad. The texture was pretty good, it had a slight 'crunchy' texture you expect from amber jack but the taste of the fish itself was lacking when compared to one of higher quality.\n\nUni - The amount of Uni that came on the nigiri was a nice helping. Looked like a mish mash tho and not carefully/skillfully laid out. When I ate it however, it was still partially frozen because I could feel the ice crystals. Since it was frozen, couldn't taste any creaminess of the uni. Disappointment. \n\nAmi Ebi - So sitting at the bar has its perks. You get to see the sushi chefs in action putting together your sushi masterpiece before devouring it. However, it also has its downside. We saw the Ami Ebi being prepared by the chef until he took a second look at it, consulted with his assistant and threw it out. The shrimp must not have been up to par and it was not something he felt should be served. Bravo Chef for making sure that you were serving something of high quality, I appreciated that. The waiter came by and them said that they were out of the Ami Ebi and I was ok with that. What happened next surprised me. The owner came over to the chef to ask why the shrimp was not being served. He explained himself and that must not have sat well with the owner since the profits on the shrimp must be high. Next thing I know, I saw them pulling out a box of frozen.. FROZEN, shrimp. Granted, I dont know how other restaurants do it, but when I am sitting at the sushi bar, the last thing I want to see is frozen shrimp being thawed out under some water, cut up and served raw to me. The waiter comes back telling me he made a mistake that they did have The shrimp and that it was being prepared for me... Face palm.... \n\nTheir other food might be good, but I certainly wont be back for this.", "author": "An L."}

There were about 11 of us and it caused all manner of confusion and disarray.  Mikaku isn't a big place, so that one might be on us.  \n\nThe food was alright. I ordered the una ju which came with the requisite salad and miso soup.  I always wonder why Japanese restaurants serve a salad with their entrees; it is rarely any more than a footnote to the rest of the meal and this was no exception.  The una ju, while being one of the more expensive dishes on the menu, really was very bare-bones and basic.  Eel on rice, done.  What is more, it is a fairly small portion so after I finished my meal, I was still feeling a bit hungry.\n\nThe real issue we had was with the service.  All the dishes came out a few at a time.  This had the unfortunate consequence of having some of us completely finished with our meals while others were still waiting on their first rolls.

They had been there for an hour half or so (mind you we visit every time we are in the city and regularly send friends and business partners here). Tonight was the first time I have ever been so disappointed in staff and service (love the head sushi chef who I assumed from other visits and interactions was the owner) but now not sure ... Like I said we arrived 1 1/2 to 2 hours after our friends (they had been ordering the whole time there and ordered more when we got there... Since they had ordered stuff before us we asked to split check ... Was told this was not a problem (mind u no where in store or on the menu does it say you can not slip checks (so it was two parties one consisted of two adults and ours consisted two adults and one teenage). We ordered some drink, one roll and some teriyaki beef. No other communication with staff to see if we needed any drinks or other food. After 30 minutes we just decided to ask for out checks. Well low and behold they decided to add almost an $11 tip (20%) on my party of 3 check that was $68 and add an almost $18 tip to the other check of $90 \n\nWhen I asked the head chef he said sorry I am not sure what that is. As a head chef/owner you should focus on food as well as know everything else going on... When asked waiter he said you are a party of 5. Had to explain no because you allowed seperate checks that is seperate groups ... You can not claim 1 group and no where does it state no split checks and party of 5 plus will  be automatically charge tip of or choice... Then to argue with a customer about charging what ever you felt us Wong and disrespectful... \n\nHope you can get it together and get back to the place we loved 3 months ago and please train your staff on proper ways of talking to customers and know what they are taking about before they answer for you .., tonight your staff double dipped on tips and because a customer asked a question got disrespectful and rude about it\n\nIt was a busy Friday night but that does not excuse constantly walking past a middle table and not checking on them.", "author": "Misty L."}

We ordered two rolls, two noodles, a sashimi plate and sake. We had to remind the waiter THREE times before he give us the sake. The avocado on my roll was freaking yellow! And the rice was hard like overnight fried rice. With barely any service and constant reminding the waiter what was missing, he still had the balls to bring out a bill with 20% gratuity charge!      Wtf? To be fair, when the waiter returned my friend's credit car, he said he admit it was bad service and took off the 20% for us. \n\nAnyway, I'd not recommend anyone to come here or at least during lunch time. It was a Saturday lunch. So no reason for them to have all these leftover- turned yellow - avocado and rice to serve people from Friday night.", "author": "Howard C."}

We ordered Dragon and Volcano Sushi rolls, edemame and chicken udon soup. It took a little while for the food to come and the volcano sushi roll was not riled properly because you could not even pick it up without it falling all over the table, we only ate 2 out of 6 pieces :( the volcano sushi roll was good! The chicken udon soup was not worth the price because the noodles were still hard and not well cooked and hard to eat, and the edemame was just barely boiled and not even salted!

The first thing I noticed with this place was they had slow service. When my wife and I walked in there was no hostess and a waitress told us to sit next to the table she was taking an order from. After that it took awhile for her to help us, she must have seen me looking around when we were ready because she popped out and said she would be right with us. They service was slow all night, they did have one table that was around 10 people, but other then that hardly anybody in the place besides us.\n\nSo when we did get our food we had the agedashi tofu as a starter, this was fantastic and I highly recommend getting it. After having that I thought maybe this place was underrated in Yelp and we would be in for some good sushi, but as it turns out it was not to be. \n\nWe had about four different rolls, and on all of them they were pretty small and the fish did not seem fresh at all. The rolls that they have to as well are not as creative as I have seen in other places. We decided to try a hand roll to see if that was any better and more of just the same, not very fresh fish. \n\nOverall I would say the place is not horrible, and it might actually be worth the value if the price was lower, but for the prices they charge I would expect better.

With so many 'fake' Japanese restaurants in the city, this one is 'real'.  This is NOT a place where you want to take your date, parents, or out-of-town guests.  When you open your fridge and realize that you have no food --- head to Mikaku.  \n\nTIP 1:  The regular printed menu includes the usual basics with nothing interesting.  For dinner, I highly recommend ordering only the items on the white board on the wall that reads 'Dinner Time ONLY', and stay away from the stuff on their regular menu.  On 9/2/2006, they had items like Kampachi Sashimi from Japan ($9.85), Buta-kakuni ($4.95), Grilled miso marinated chicken ($6.25), Simmered Pumpkin with Ankake sauce ($5.50), etc.  I really liked their Aji-nanbanzuke (Marinated Spanish Mackerel with ginger) ($5.75).  \n\nTIP 2:  Try their home made Buckwheat Noodle ($8.50).  Japanese community raves about Mikaku's homemade soba (served only during dinner), which ends with soba-yu (unless they forget).     \n\nTIP 3:  I've never tried their nigiri, but I don't expect impressive nigiri sushi in these kinds of restaurants.   Chirashi-sushi during lunch is a pretty good deal. \n\nTIP 4: Street parking near the restaurant is tough, but during dinner hours, your best shot is Pine Street near Grant.  If you are not super cheap like me when it comes to parking, there is a Sutter Street garage nearby, which isn't too pricy.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

I googled the closest sushi bar and found this one. Didn't understand why it was so empty but now I get it. Sat down at a table by the window. My back was hurting so I sat in a cushioned seat by the window. The waiter or hostess or whomever came over to me and said that this table was reserved and tried to put me at a super small wooden table in the center of the restaurant behind a pole. I explained to them that no one was there and asked if I could sit in this table and he said no sorry. \"Reserved\". I asked if the whole restaurant was reserved because no one was there and it looked like no one was coming there. Then I was thinking \"wow, these guys must be so so busy that there's no room for me.\" So I just left and went around the corner to a great Asian restaurant on Sutter. Super yummy and service was impeccable. So on the way to Niemans I cruise by the sushi restaurant and it IS STILL EMPTY!!!! I can't believe that they would be so rude when they were so empty.

That's the quality you get here. \n\nWent here for lunch during the week because Akiko's was too full and this was the closest Japanese restaurant that seemed okay based on reviews. \n\nWent in during the lunch rush (12:30pm) and the place was half empty. That should've been a good enough indication to run. We got seated right away and got menus. At first glance, prices seemed pretty comparable to other places. Ordered a lunch set and a speciality roll (Volcano - California roll w/baked scallops). Because of the prices, I was expecting decent quality, but that is definitely not what I got.\n\nFirst off, the Volcano roll was $16. It came with a tiny California roll with imitation crab and a few pieces of scallops. Quality overall tasted like prepackaged sushi because of how dry and somewhat hard the ingredients were. However, it was warm because they threw it in the oven. Boyfriend got the lunch set with Bluefin toro nigiri. Same poor quality. Cali roll with imitation crab and below average sashimi. He mentioned that the bluefin tasted \"funny,\" but couldn't quit put his finger on it. He did not say this with positive connotations. \n\nBill came out to $50 for some of the worst quality sushi I've ever had. Don't mean to be a sushi snob, but the people giving this place 5 star ratings probably don't know what good sashimi is suppose to taste like. I felt like we were paying restaurant prices for Safeway sushi. At least if I'm buying sushi from Safeway I know I'm getting what I pay for.

We went here on our last evening because it was close to our hotel and we both love sushi and Japanese food.  Some of the reviews below indicated that we would like the fresh fish - this was not our experience. The hot food was the best of the meal for us.\n\nOur drinks were nice (my Mom got a sake tasting flight and I got some happy hour cocktail). The setting was nice and the waiter was friendly and enthusiastic.   We were seated immediately (restaurant was nearly empty) and the food came out quickly.\n\nWe ordered the real crab California roll, the Tuna belly nigiri (I think market price was $12 for 2 pc), the shiro maguro (albacore) nigiri and real wasabi.  We love wasabi, my Mom grows wasabi, and we have eaten real wasabi numerous times.  This wasabi was so weak and bland we couldn't believe it - there was zero pungency (and I'm not looking for the horseradish pungency of fake wasabi, but real wasabi has a flavour and this tasted like wallpaper paste or something).  \n\nUnfortunately, blandness was really the theme for the sushi - the crab had no mild sweetness like Dungeness usually has (it wasn't off, for which I am grateful!), the tuna belly was really meh, and the shiro maguro was awful - they sear it!  So instead of a nice piece of cold albacore, we got some gross pieces with cooked edges.  Blah.  We waved the waiter down and asked if they always serve it seared.  Apparently they do - it would be nice if they noted that on the menu.    \n\nWe both prefer a very plain sushi experience, so the flavours of fresh ingredients shine through (California roll is as exotic as we get, as we both love crab and avocado), and we don't enjoy fusion-y rolls with sauces and embellishments.  For plain raw fish, I do not recommend this restaurant.  We get better raw fish sushi at our grocery stores at home.\n\nWe decided to move on to their hot food, and this is where my stars are coming from.  We had the chicken karaage, and it was very tasty, with a nicely strong ginger flavour.  We also had the combo tempura, and that was quite good too (my mom liked it more than I did - I found it a little soggy) - the selection of vegetables was good.  I wish I had gone with my initial instinct to get Ten Don.  \n\nWith all of the restaurants in SF, I know we won't be back to this one, as it's just not our kind of food.

SCORE!\n\nAfter a quick back and forth of \"what do you want to eat for lunch?\"  \"I dunno, what do -you- want?\", we settled on Japanese and both pulled out our phones to search for somewhere to eat that was 1) open at a bit after noon on a Saturday, 2) within walking distance from the parking garage where we had just stashed my car, and 3) wouldn't make wallets cry out in pain.  (Turns out 3 was just me, since he didn't tell me he was on an expense account, but it's the thought that counts, right?)  Yelp popped Mikaku up on my phone as a few blocks away and off we went.\n\nI don't eat nearly enough Japanese food to know the intricate details of what things should or should not taste or look like, so I can't wax poetic on how my maguro sashimi was super authentic or horribly caucasianised.  I can, however, say that it was some amazing fish, cut perfectly to that almost-melt away on your tongue texture. They weren't little floppy pieces either; with my order of six and a bowl of rice I was quite comfortable for the rest of the afternoon.  My friend got a box of some sort (I was too busy people watching out the window to hear what he ordered) and he seemed pleased with it - I know he couldn't finish the whole thing and was talking about still being full several hours later when we got a noseful walking past The Stinking Rose.)\n\nThe service was decent.  We weren't ignored by the waitress, who had hot green tea in front of us before we were even fully settled into our seats.  The sushi chef was convivial, laughing with several different people who came in.\n\nI don't find myself in SF enough to say  how Mikaku relates to other restaurants in the area, but I'd come back again.

They give 5 pieces with sauce. I like that it's not fried to a burnt brown but just right. The tempura was not that great, however. The vegetables were alright but could it be any thinner?! I've had better and bigger shrimp too. The rice I got was very sticky for the most part this time. \n\nCustomer service was stellar the first time but today, we weren't served often at all. It's strange how different the second time was. Tea was never refilled and when they asked, we already paid the check. No one ever checked up on our table. Minus 1 star for that.

The guys had the bento boxes it was good value for around $18. The bento boxes came with a lot of food including the main entree, some tempura, a california roll, salad and a miso soup. I had Nabeyaki Udon it turned out to be a very nice dish with a good stock, some vegetable and shrimp tempura on the side, it was more than fulfilling for me.

Several things changed for better or for worse:\n\n* Decor of the place changed drastically. New owners gave the restaurant a face lift, literally. Ceilings have been raised, new light fixtures, new paint, new furniture, new art work. New Mikaku does not look anything like old Mikaku. This appeals to many patrons.\n\n* Prices have gone up. Understandably. Have to recoup capital expenditures.\n\n* Portions decreased. See point above.\n\n* Surprisingly, food tastes as good as with previous owners. And that's why I will come back. \n\nVery convinient location on the same block with Sutter-Stockton garage. Walk here or come by car and pay $3 for 2 hours in the garage.

Mikaku's owner (Jin?) was really hospitable - some of the guys we went with were regulars - and brought us complimentary garlic fries, soju shots, and cheesecake for the birthday girl. We did sake bombs and generally acted obnoxious.

I personally wouldn't take someone here on a date because I didn't find anything to be particularly special, but the prices are very good ($5 - $10 per appetizer, $10 - $15 per roll).

Mikaku sprinkles shredded cucumber on top of rice, underneath sashimi, which adds a fresh flavor.  This is my lunch time staple.  Oh!  By the way, if you are the first 10 customers (i.e., get there before 11:45am) you get California rolls.  Chirashi always accompanied with little starter dish and miso soup. \n\nDinner: Mikaku makes handpulled soba noodles.  It's good.  When you go here for dinner, just order off the dinner only white board menu by the sushi bar.  You can only get it at dinner time.  They won't budge about serving it at lunch.  Its actually a great jedi mind trick because whenever I have dinner at Mikaku and eat the stuff on the white board, I feel super lucky.

Silly me, I didn't look up a good place before lunch. So I stumbled on this place... \n\nI wanted to get an avo-kappa maki and miso soup but they said it would be 20 minutes, so I went with the original idea of udon soup. Fine. It comes with veggie tempura, normally a good thing. \n\nI drink my green tea and eat the cold noodles with mayo (blech) whatching the single sushi chef work. The fish didn't look delicious or particularly well stored. Everything had a old world sanitation feel to it. He was still fun to watch. And everyone around me seemed to be enjoying their sushi. \n\nMy soup came. It smelled like sheep poop. I'm serious! Somehow the blend of fish broth and buckwheat = sheep poop. I grew up around them... I'm not making it up. Luckily once I sprinkled on a generous portion of nanami togarashi, my nose got stuffed and I couldn't really smell anymore. The flavor was good, the noodles a bit over done. \n\nUnfortunately the tempura was only warm and soggy, so I didn't really eat much of it. They didn't provide any dipping sauce, so I just dipped it in the soup, which made my soup kinda greasy. I ate all the broth but had to forgo most of the noodles. \n\nNot a good experience. I'd give them another shot based on other reviews. I'll keep you updated. \n\nPS this was my horoscope today: Don't be so impulsive today, for your quick response is not likely to be your best.

But it is the one place I can down some sake and walk home after...  I find myself in a strange position...  Do I write a bad review on a place I will continue to show my face at...  or do I write a good review when I only like the food there half of the times...?  \n\nLast night, after an outstanding meal at the sushi bar (I normally take a table), I think Mikaku has redeemed itself...  I am now writing a review on this place with much understanding and appreciation.\n\nMy relationship with this place started out of convenience.  Based on the sashimi that came with my lunch/dinner bento, I had been very reluctant to order any real sushi items.  However, many of their Japanese dishes, such as tofu in hot broth, homemade soba, salt duck, and other Japanese \"diner\" food have always been very good.  The special board will tell you: Clams in Sake, Creamy Daikon Soup... etc.  So I basically avoid sushi there.  \n\nThen last night I had this urgent need for some sushi.  I came here, and it was packed with Japanese businessmen.  I sat at the sushi bar and ordered what I could: Black Cod, White Tuna, Yellowtail and Amaebi.  I had my fingers crossed, hoping that by paying more the quality of the fish would be (much needed) better than the bento quality.  \n\nI was NOT disappointed.  In addition to the tasty fish, I noticed how well trained the chef was.  Very skilled, precise--- an old school chef who went through the whole tutelage beginning with rice washing  long before he was allowed to touch the fish.  I almost felt sad that as good as he was, he had to make those silly spicy tuna and California rolls. \n\nAfter a very satisfying meal, he asked me how the food was.  I said, \"Delicious,\" then added, \"you are a very good sushi chef.\"  Instead of a humble nod, he smiled proudly, as if giving me props for recognizing it.  I also suggested that I'd wish to see more seafood items, such as aji and scallops.  He shook his head and explained that he did do that in the past, but no one ordered it.  I turned my head and saw the Japanese businessmen who busied themselves away with the food...  Some of food items I had never seen before.  And I recalled that this place was constantly hit by the traffic of Japanese travelers...  At that moment I decided to make good rapport with this nice sushi chef.  I want what those Japanese men are eating.  With that said, Mikaku shall see me back very soon.", "author": "Jiajia C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-06", "description": "I know I don't go out nearly enough to be a good Yelper but I am glad I have this place to write about. This place was recommended to me by one of the very few people I trust in taste, and like always I got what he promised. \n\nI desired authentic Japanese food. Not sushi, which plagues San Francisco and sushi is good in itself but what I was specifically looking for was more into the depths of Japanese cuisine.\n\nThat being said, this is where I am going to say a few things about Japanese restaurants in the United States. At least 95% of them are catered for the American consumer. Proof? California rolls. So as I read all these negative reviews about this place, it makes me sad and at the same time wonder about the overall palate of the Americans. Not just in food, but the overall dining experience, including service and treatment.\n\nWhat Americans don't realize is how Japanese restaurants are actually run in Japan, where the wait staff actually wait for your call (in many places, with a push of a button). Americans are obsessed with chugging down insane amounts of water, which is why they expect their waters to be constantly refilled, whereas in Japan your glass of water will probably last you the entire meal. In Japan they do not come to you every five minutes to ask whether the food is good, because really that is more annoying than polite. They will not bother you period unless you call them, and if you call them, it is to order more food or beer/sake, not a refill of water when your glass is still half full. But Americans expect it, and when they do not get it they regard it as bad service. Whereas in Japan, it is perfectly good service. So to give a bad review because of this is very miscredited, and it is hard not to get exasperated and yell out \"shut up you spoiled brats\".\n\nAbout the sushi, again it is catered to Americans. You want cheap sushi, you got it. You order California rolls with your maguro nigiri and you expect the maguro to be of high quality. Sorry, that's just not going to happen anywhere. Do any of you know why the California roll was invented in the first place? I'm sure most of you would be offended. To order California rolls at a sushi restaurant is an insult to the tradition. To order a rock roll, a volcano roll, a spider roll, you're just digging your own grave. The California roll order is the deal breaker in automatically knowing whether the customer is serious about eating good Japanese food. To give a restaurant a bad review based on their California rolls is just silly.\n\nFor this place, the sushi counter is just there to satisfy the American expectation, that a Japanese restaurant is not a Japanese restaurant unless they serve sushi, i.e. California rolls.\n\nI knew not to come here for sushi, when I walked in I did not expect sushi, yet I still sat at the counter, because that is where the head chef was. When the waitress asked if I will be having any sushi, I told her no thanks. \n\nI glanced at the menu, but I didn't really read the details. I knew that the things I wanted were not on the menu, and all I needed to do was talk with the head chef a little. This is my scheme for all good Japanese restaurants, to introduce myself to the head chef and let him know my knowledge of Japanese food and let him decide what I would like. I told him I wanted food from the kitchen, what he thought was good.\n\nThey all get a bit confused and awkward at first, since I am clearly an American Asian and I speak English. But usually they break down pretty quick as I ask for more and more food, and by the end mutual respect is formed. \n\nThis is how to treat Japanese restaurants in America. It does you absolutely no good to bark at the chef about maGURro and haMAHchi niGIRri because you might as well be wearing a shirt with \"baka gaijin\" written all over it. The customer is not the king there, the head chef is. You show him respect, he will give you respect. If you can't pronounce it right, just say it in frickin English. \n\nMost of what I got is written on the white board, which is what you need to pay attention to because that's the place that lists the true Japanese dishes they serve. Lightly fried pumpkin with a bit of salt on the side, pan fried light duck meat, chawan mushi (steamed egg with soup), and homemade (hand cut!!) soba noodles. Does anybody know just how hard it is to make soba yourself? And the chef admitted to me it took him a long time to get it right.\n\nThe chawan mushi is one of the best I have had in San Francisco, the pumpkin is something you don't see often here, the duck is nice and fatty as it should be, and the soba is a great eye-opening experience after so many places that serve them right out of the package.\n\nAfter I ate I sat and chatted with him for a long time, talking of food and of the nabe (hotpot) dish I will be back for next week (you must reserve this dish in advance in order for him to prepare it). He charges far less than what the food is worth, believe me.", "author": "Daria J."}

It is much \"fancier\" with clubby music playing in the background and a sign out front advertising \"MK Sushi & Sake Happy Hour\". No more Itou-san and his wife, they went back to Japan! Very sad. I sat at the counter and ordered \"Sushi Combo Lunch A\" which was maguro, ebi, hirame, unagi, kappa maki with miso soup and salad. Unfortunately the only thing that was half way decent was the kappa (cucumber) roll. All the sushi tasted very old and rubbery. The unagi was cold and hard. The hirame definitely tasted like it was way past its prime. The rice was not good either (again, cold) and there was hardly any wasabi in btwn rice and fish. The miso soup tasted like bleach (probably didn't rinse the bowl well when it was washed) and the iceberg lettuce salad was literally 5 pieces of brown, wilted, stalky pieces (dressing was good though). The service was very friendly, but so slow and forgetful. Many customers were getting impatient and irritated since everyone was in a hurry on their lunch break. The boss (at least who I think was the boss, behind the sushi counter) was trying his best to make sushi, chat with customers and manage the incompetent staff so he gets 4 stars. But unfortunately the food was so bad I'm not sure if I'll be back. I thought maybe it was just opening kinks they needed to work out, but I heard they've been open for 3 months now.

No where else do they cook sushi like Mikaku's where anything on the menu makes any bad mood melt away. Just planning on coming here makes me excited. All the waiters/waitresses are very personable and informative about the menu and definitely know what's best. Natasha really made our night this weekend by simply being awesome and showing us a great time. I have worked in the downtown area now for almost three years and have never appreciated anyone's business more. Whether it's a quick lunch trip or a late night sushi expo, this is the place to go for all sushi cravings.", "author": "Jay S."}

Like the other reviews, this is not fancy fare, but it's no Todai either.  The 11:15am part you ask?  Well, if you're one of the first 10 customers that order $7 or more, then you get a free order of california roll.  (Note: if you order the $6.95 udon, you don't qualify.. literally, it's $7... order a diet coke or something!).  My lunch buddies and I go here every so often... the soba (you can't do soba bad!) is fulfilling on a warm day, and the nabeyaki udon keeps you in good spirits on the chilly SF days.  The sushi you ask... well, I won't take my chances so I can't give fair judgement on that... the portions look decent but... let me know how it tastes when you order it.  The waitstaff... well, they've gotten to know me and my timely 11:28 arrival... so they are kind.  All in all, I know you can do a lot worse.", "author": "Dale K."}
