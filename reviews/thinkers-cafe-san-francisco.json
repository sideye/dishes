I tried really hard to like this place, since it's fairly close to where I live and I could just walk there. However, the handful of times that I've visited this place, whether it be in the early mornings after my roggings (run/jogs) or afternoon coffee cravings, it has always been so disappointing. Sadly, not once have I been satisfied with this place. And yet, I've given them so many chances. \n\nThe main reason I have been utterly disappointed with this place is due to the lack of care and respect the employees have for it and their customers. The workers here are lazy, rude, unapologetic and just plain out of it. 4 out of 5 times, the same guy will miss my drink. I only order a small coffee or iced chai. He always gets it wrong; making my chai hot or my coffee iced or mixing up the sizes. Never apologizes and instead just dismisses it as if I were the person that ordered wrong. The service is slow. On one account, I was there waiting and waiting for some service (a coffee!) while two workers were just diddle daddling around. No one was there. Except me. They heard me but continued to ignore me until I had to call out to them and ask for help. Incredible! And another observation would be, why are there always flies around their pies? The food here is meh and really nothing to rave about. The coffee too. Drinks are not more better than anywhere else and prices are about the same-$3.50 for an iced chai poured from a box. With that said, I usually and hardly write bad reviews but with this place, it's been accumulating minus points so it's only fair to share my two cents. \n\nIt's a simple, local neighborhood place but in my opinion, there's a bunch of coffee spots that are all within walking distance so save yourself the trip and have your coffee elsewhere.", "author": "Laurel P."}

The seating is pretty uncomfortable, with flat, hard wooden benches and little throw-pillow sized cushions. Great decor, with rotating local art and various proverbs and famous quotes painted randomly on the walls. The music is whatever they feel like playing, which I usually like but it can be loud sometimes, which may hurt their business in the long run.\n\nMost of the times I go are off-peak hours like 11am or 2pm, so the service is quick and theres plenty of seating. However, when its busy it can be a completely different place. The line takes up most of the room and can quickly go outside, and the service suffers.\n\nThe Breakfast Croissant is my favorite in the morning. Plenty of scrambled egg, 2-3 slices of ham, ample cheddar cheese and green onions on a large, very tasty croissant. Along with excellent coffee it makes for a great breakfast. Close second is the breakfast burrito. For lunch I enjoy the spicy chicken wrap, which has a great ratio of fresh ingredients and a sauce thats quite spicy, but not too powerful or lingering.\n\nNow a couple negatives. For some reason they have a really odd and nasty lemonade. I couldn't even drink past the first few sips. Also, the website apparently hasn't been updated in several years, it says they are open until 7pm which is way off. They closed at 3 and sometimes 2:30 during the winter, and for summer they are open until 4. \n\nPrices are what you'd expect from an upscale cafe, but I believe its worth it, and overall Thinker's Cafe is a nice, cozy neighborhood cafe that has some great menu items and good service when they aren't really busy.", "author": "Chris G."}

Wrong.  The problem is that by the time you get your wrong order, you've waited an obscene length of time, so the next period of waiting for the correct order gets ever more painful.\n\nThe problem here is that they have an incompetent staff working in a cramped space that can't accommodate wide swings in traffic that happen on weekend lunchtimes.  Their menu is delightful, but if they can't produce the food fast enough, they'd do better cutting it back.

You can start a Frequent Thinker card, good for free drinks and stuff, but the best part is, you can leave it there!  \n\nThe only downside that I've seen is the overabundance of bints with screaming children.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-08-12", "description": "Oddly enough, I was going to up this to a 4 star. The key word here is was. I'll give it to the baristas, after years of going here (since I staunchly will not compromise my coffee morals and step foot in Farley's again) they finally have baristas that care to remember my name and my favorite summertime drink. \n\nSo, why have I suddenly downgraded you ask? Well, I thought their hours were bad already. They have left me in the lurch for years when I am craving a nighttime coffee, but it has gotten worse. Now I can no longer appease my afternoon cravings. There is now a new sign on the door indicating their \"Fall\" hours. \n\nFirst, when did August 1st become Fall? Please do not take my summer away from me any earlier than need be! \n\nSecondly, how on earth can a coffee house survive when they only serve food until 2:30 and close by 3:30, or is it that they only serve food until 1:30 and close by 2:30? Either way, what the hell? Perhaps this is why they raised their prices. \n\nOh and I have one other beef. Why do \"regulars\" still get to pay $1 for their coffee? Why aren't they subject to that extra quarter they now charge? Really, what is the extra quarter to these \"regulars\" what on earth will a single quarter get you? So, why do the baristas turn their head when they are only handed a dollar? Why not speak up and say \"I'm sorry, coffee is now $1.25.\" It doesn't take a lot to be a little assertive.\n\nSo there is my rant and my rationale for the downgrade. I admit, I am a coffee addict, but how hard is it to have some decent hours. Is it that they can't pay for the extra help? Maybe if they actually charged all those \"regulars\" that extra quarter they could stay open past mid-afternoon.\n\nBut, it is still the only decent coffee house in my neighborhood. So, what's a girl to do?", "author": "melissa t."}

The first time I was there I got the breakfast croissant and it was soooo good!! The next time I got the same thing and it was really runny. They must have thrown the cheese in while they were cooking the eggs because I couldn't tell where the cheese ended and the eggs started. I also wasn't sure if it was runny from the cheese or that the eggs were under cooked. I get grossed out by runny eggs so this was not a good experience :/ The next time I ordered the same thing and when I got home I realized they gave me a ham sandwich I didn't have time to go back and get it fixed so I just ate it. I don't like ham sandwiches, but this one was pretty good (a little too much meat, but that's OK I just pulled some off) The next time I decided to try something new and ordered a turkey sandwich. This time there was barely any meat at all!! This place is extremely inconsistent! I should start asking who is in the kitchen, because someone there is awesome and someone is horrible???

All in all the experience was pleasant staff was nice and attentive. Food was satisfying and mostly delish. Downsides are seating. There was hardly any. and every time someone stood up I went to switch from outside to inside some lil old lady or posh mom with her kids swopped in and snagged the seat.

Crew seems nice - food from the menu isn't the best in SF, but lots of choices of pastry etc to go with your beverage.  Free wi-fi.  Outdoor seating (when it's nice out) is very helpful since they only have so much room inside.  Very dog friendly, which is a huge plus in this hip family area of town.", "author": "Inspector G."}
