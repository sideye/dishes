I really wanted to like this place, we need a good burrito/mexican take-away on Castro street. The first time I went in was early on a Sunday afternooon. I was craving Pozole and I had seen that it was advertised on the menu. I went in to order and then the lady at the counter told me they didnt have it.\n\nThe second time I went in for a burrito to take away around 7:45 pm and the meats looked like they'd been sitting out and not freshly prepared which initially I noticed but hoping it would be good food I ordered the burrito anyway. I wanted a spicy sauce to go on my burrito and I tried explaining that to the lady but the lady at the counter said that they only had enchilada sauce and that they only had the salsa for the chips.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was very very wet and messy. It was luke-warm. The meat was chewy and I couldn't eat most of it. It was not tender. It was quite dissapointing and rather disposable.\n\nThe worst bit was the tiny bit of Guac & cheese in it!\n\nI LOVED Zapata Mexican Grill when it was open on 18th & Diamond. That was amazing but La Tortilla should have been the one to have closed. What a disappointment. Instead of coming back here, I will probably just go to the Mission. I imagine most of the business this place gets is from the bars after people have been drinking. \n\nThis is not a place to come for a delicious mexican burrito!", "author": "Julian I."}

It's cheap, is right next to several bus stops, and has good burritos. However, today they accused me of not paying for my burrito, and made me pay twice, so I won't be returning.\n\nThe cashier took my money and gave me change, but got distracted and went around doing different things as I waited for her to hand me my burrito which was sitting on the counter. Finally she gave it to me and I walked out the door, at which point the staff yelled at me to come back, and told me I had not paid. I told them I had, but the cashier just shook her head at me, saying I couldn't have paid because the register wasn't open. I knew that I'd paid, because I remembered paying with 2 five-dollar bills, and I now had no fives in my wallet. The burrito was $5.97, and in the mostly-empty tip jar sat 3 cents--my change in coins that I'd dumped in there. I pointed this out--\"There's my 3 cents, that's from when you gave me change for $5.97 a minute ago.\" She wouldn't believe me, so I finally just paid again with a 20 so I wouldn't miss my bus. At this point, she gave me my change, including (I think) my 2 fives back.\n\nMistakes happen, that isn't the problem, but it sucked to be treated that way. I was a regular customer and saw this cashier pretty much every week, so it's not very likely that I would be trying to cheat her. I won't be coming back because this just made me feel bad!\n\nIf you like the food and prices, here are some places with similar prices and menus:\nLa Corneta, one very big location on Mission/24th and one smaller one in Glen Park\nCasa Mexicana, one location at Church and Duboce, and one on 24 in Noe Valley\nLa Fonda in Inner Sunset", "author": "Amanda V."}

Tonight, it seemed super bland and not as yummy as the last time.\n\nOkay, first things first... I truly and wholeheartedly empathize with the staff. They have to deal with drunk, annoying people all night long, but the quality of the food was really poor. I ordered a side of chips and guac. $2 extra for chips? Come on! Those should be free. If you add a container of guacamole, it's a whopping $6.50 extra. I spent over $15 total (plus a dollar tip, even though the staff wasn't very pleasant).\n\nThis is quite literally some of the worst guacamole I have ever had. It tasted like someone spilled a pitcher of water in it, and instead of throwing it away, decided to simply mix it all together. What a bland, disgusting mess. It kept falling off the chip, it was so thin and watery. I ate a couple of bites and gave up. \n\nThe burrito itself was pretty boring. Rice, refried beans, tofu... that's it. Where was my salsa, as promised on the menu? I ordered spicy salsa and did not get any salsa at all. I had to drown it in my own personal bottle of hot sauce just to give it any sort of flavor. \n\nI rarely write scathingly bad reviews these days, but this place really deserves it.

I let my husband do the ordering, because he's better at ignoring disinterest.  I went on to the cashier to pay.\n\nMy attempt at small talk with the male cashier was a disastrous failure.  Dead eyes.\n\nThen the bill was higher than it used to be. Okay, it's been a while.  But, I wanted to know how  came to be that high (it was only $30)... what were the prices of the things we ordered.  I was questioning, not challenging.  But, the cashier actually said no, I had to pay first before he'd break down the bill.\n\nThat was it.  We left the food and went down the street to get our takeout.  \n\nThe restaurant had only a couple people in it at prime eating time, no line.

I had to repeat my request for a super veggie burrito twice.  Afterwards, I had to halt him before he could spoil my order with black beans.  In any other taqueria  throughout the City, servers ask you why type of beans / salsa you'd like.  Here, its like they apply the preference of the last patron to that of the next in the interest of expediency.   \n\nNext is the general philosophy that the farther away a taqueria is from the Mission District, the crummier their quality of ingredients.  La Tortilla validates this philosophy.  Their salsas are watery, their guacamole is heavily salted, and their other fresh ingredients like lettuce, etc. taste like they've been aging in the fridge.  \n\nLastly there is the dining environment.  With a building structure that facing the sidewalk, it invites fresh air and daylight from its open bay window.  It also serves as an open door for pigeons.  During my visit, one pigeon kept walking in and out casually without interruption from the cashier or anyone behind the counter.  Even when the bird decided to fly up and around for attention, not a single staff member moved to shoo it away.  I don't recall dining in to mean sharing with local rats with wings.  \n\nAs if the rat with wings wasn't bad enough, there are the panhandlers.  Its the Castro so there are bound to be some.  One walked in casually with 3 pens in hand.  He approached each patron dining inside in attempts to pedal the pens.  Nods and 'No thank you's were all he got.  This guy wasn't invisible and there was no place to hide in this small living room-sized restaurant but just like with the pigeon, the staff stood back and did squat.  \n\nI'd say the only good about this place was that I stomached the food I regretfully paid for.

They have a good selection of salsas and such at their bar, though while I am normally a voracious eater of free tortilla chips, even these were too bland to convince me to expend the calories.  \n\nService was slow and the staff were mostly neutral in demeanor.  \n\nOne thing this place has going for it is the seating - my friend and I sat in the big open front windows, where we enjoyed the Castro's warm sun and a surprisingly nude passerby (if you can truly be nude while carrying a messenger bag)  Unfortunately, I don't think its enough to bring me back.", "author": "Virginia B."}

The owner didn't want any more customers even though there was a long line of people anxiously awaiting to spend their money at his business. As I try to walk in the door, the man physically pushed me really hard and said \"no mas!\". I told him I just was trying to get some food, and he continued to yell at me in Spanish. I'm sorry, but if you have a line full of people that want to spend money at your business, then it's simply bad business for you to close your doors at that time. Second of all, it's even worse business to physically lay your hands on your customer in a violent way! I can't believe that happened, I've never been treated so poorly by someone who runs a business. Never come here. The food is alright, but over priced and not thaaat good. If you want good food and better prices, go to Zapata around the corner. I'll never come back to La Tortilla, this place is only still in business because of their location.", "author": "Trenton C."}

Friday night sealed the deal, however, and I will never be back. I ordered two shrimp tacos and a soda ($10!) I received two tacos with pinkish-grey salad shrimp, no seasoning, and clearly undercooked/raw tortillas. You would think if they have \"tortilla\" in the name, they would know how to at least do one of those right.\n\nI shoveled one of the gross, bland tacos down because I knew I would later be drinking and had to have something in my stomach. I wasn't thrilled about eating the second taco, but figured I had to in order to get through the night. So I bit into the taco and found a PLASTIC TWIST-TIE for their tortilla bag inside of my food, which completely ruined the already terrible meal.\n\nI took the twisty-tie to the counter and let the woman preparing food know what was up. I didn't complain, I waited for her other customers to be gone so I wouldn't embarrass her, I didn't even ask for my money back. I just wanted to let her know, so they wouldn't serve someone else plastic in their food. The only response I got was complete confusion. Very disappointing. \n\nIf you want Mexican food that tastes like plastic and has plastic inside of it, choose La Tortilla.", "author": "Matt B."}

How could someone be so cruel to such a magnificent creation?\n\nFairly new to the neighborhood and having already tried Zapata, I figured I should give La Tortilla a shot. It is not a mistake I'll be repeating.\n\nI ordered to-go and the people behind the counter were reasonably nice and fast. Oddly, I wasn't given any containers for the salsa bar, and none were to be found near the bar itself, so I had to return the register. The people behind me had to do the same.\n\nDespite having the makings of a perfectly delicious burrito -- steak, hot and mild salsa, guacamole, cheese, rice, beans, etc. -- the result was decidedly not. The meat had zero flavor and the salsas and guac accounted little more than runny consistency. Even adding spicy salsa I picked up from the salsa bar couldn't give La Tortilla's burrito any semblance of enjoyable flavor.\n\nBurrito enthusiasts beware, this place will crush your dreams.", "author": "Scott L."}

Fortunately for me, La Tortilla was still open and well lit, so I swung a U-Turn and headed inside.\n\nDespite the relatively late hour on a Wednesday, La Tortilla's staff seemed wide awake, the place was clean and the other clientele appeared to be normal members of society (i.e., not selling drugs, buying drugs or eating food out of the garbage).\n\nI got my standby burrito fix -- grilled chicken with black beans and guacamole -- and it served my purpose just fine.  The burrito was well wrapped, the chicken wasn't overcooked and the flavor was pretty darn good.  The guac was just adequate, but I find that it often is at  counter service places like this one.\n\nSo in reference to previous reviews, I guess I qualify as one of those white guys who liked La Tortilla and am appreciative of cleanliness generally.

A woman behind us in line was talking to the cashier in Spanish, asking if she could order a beer.  Now we had probably been in line for about 5 minutes at the max and it was already 1:58AM and they are not allowed to sell alcohol after 2PM.  The guy running the cash register tells the woman that he's not allowed to serve beer after 2PM which is the law.  The woman and the man go back in forth in Spanish and then she starts yelling at him in English that she's been standing in line for over 10 minutes and she should be able to get a beer.\n\nAfter holding up the line, the line starts to proceed out the door.  She is still yelling at the guy in the cash register and the rest of the staff just ignore her.  People who have ordered food start to leave cause they don't want to deal with her.  After a while, I finally decide to speak up and say something.  Now I'm pretty sure I could have phrased it a little better, but I was quite buzzed and basically told her that he wasn't going to give her a beer so just live with it and besides she was only in line for like 5 minutes.\n\nWe then proceed into a shouting match back and forth.  She says I don't know her and that her dad owns the place and she'll have the f'ing place shut down.  I tell her that go ahead and call him then and shut the place down.  Although I don't know if her dad really owns the restaurant or she was just BSing, but a drunk daughter shouldn't shame her family business by treating the customers poorly.  The shouting continued back and forth.  She finally started throwing out racial slurs at me like \"slanty-eyed.\"\n\nNow you would think as a fellow minority, people do know how it feels to be at the brunt of ignorance as well as to be shot at with racial slurs.  It makes no sense to me when minorities contain the same ignorance and prejudice that we are faced with on a daily basis.\n\nAnyways, my friend then proceeds to record her on his new blackberry, hoping that she might be the newest internet meme.  She notices and walks over, crushes his phone and breaks it.  After more shouting, some other people in line finally decide to join in and help out.  In the end of it she came over to our table, flip it over and I end up with tacos all over my clothes.  As she proceeds out, I call her a couple of names which won't be repeated but was offered some nice thanks for speaking up from other customers.\n\nI guess this is what I get for trying to be a nice guy and wanted to stick up for the cashier, although I could have picked my battles more carefully.\n\nTo top it off (which is why they are getting only 1 star) the staff did NOTHING to help stop the conflict or kick her out originally.  They all just sort of ignored her and pretended she wasn't there.  After I got mine and 2 friends tacos on myself, the management didn't even offer to give me a refund or to remake our tacos.\n\nPLUS the tacos SUCKED! I had two bites and noticed that it had zero flavor.  I wouldn't come back here again to support a business (if she really was the daughter of the owner) that treats their customers and employees with disrespect.  Plus the food blows!\n\nAlso an FYI, this place has repeatedly had huge violations from the health inspectors.

It wasn't even hot enough to melt the cheese! Cold cheese in a burrito = FAIL. \n\nAtmosphere sucked, and it looked as though some of their fillings had been sitting out there a while, especially the refried beans.

Just saying. \n\nThank god this burrito was only around $6, otherwise I would've been even more upset. \n\nNot to mention, I got a stomachache soon after having eaten it.

My boyfriend didn't like their chips, which dropped his rating of the nachoes.\n\nAlso, their jalapenos aren't very good.  They're not spicy.  Actually, they don't really have any flavor.  And they're not even whole jalapenos.  They're julienned.  Boo.\n\nIn the end, I prefer La Fajita, which is just right around the corner on Market.", "author": "S J."}

She slops the food on to the tortilla (which she often carelessly tears), and she is remarkably cheap on the meat portion (moreso than anyone else there). When I ask her for more meat, she tells me there will be an extra charge. And then she doesn't put any salsa on the burrito right after asking me, \"Spicy or Mild?\"\n\nI've put up with this basic scenario for over a year, and I AM DONE.

I gave it 5 out of 5. The roasted veggies and jalapeo peppers were perfectly balanced. I could drink a pint and go home happy. I hope this just wasn't a good day for them and they can be as consistent the next time I go. In addition, I had 3 tacos. Tofu Tacos......Not grilled, you could tell it was stir fried and then soaked in a juice. Nothing special, I chose not to rate them and try them again later. Tacos Mole (Poblano).....If presentation was everything I'd give them a 5, but when I tasted the mole, I gave them a 2 out of 5.  It lacked a Chile flavor and the basic balance of sweet and savory every mole must have. Okay, the good new is that the carne asada is very good. I give it 4 out of 5. Perfectly grilled and seasoned, but could have been a bit juicer. I hate being so tough, but I wasn't a 5 at 2:00 pm. It's probably better at 11:00 am. \nThe place is inviting. The decor and colors are nice, the order sequence (order before you pay) is also a plus, as well as the special attention you get from the food prep people.

On the bright side, the interior is cute and colorful and it's kind of fun sitting in the corner by the window with the high cushioned seats - although be aware of the precariously wobbly table. Also, the prices are great. Two meals for under $9, a great place to eat before or after a screening at the nearby Castro Theater.", "author": "Kabochan Y."}

It's almost as if it's recycled. The other day I bought a carnitas burrito and the meat tasted like rubber. Yuck! I wonder if they recycle the food others leave behind. It's gross! Gross! Gross! This restaurant MUST go out of business!! There are SO MANY other good businesses that can take its place. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY buying Mexican food at La Tortilla in the Castro! You will regret it! They give Mexican food a very, very bad name!!", "author": "Enrique C."}

Zapata is pretty good & maybe more authentic, but not as yummy).   Just make sure you have them wrap your burrito in foil even if you're eating in... they'll fall apart otherwise.", "author": "SFSuperstar A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-28", "description": "This is just an ok place to grab a quick burrito when you're too lazy to walk over to the Mission. The burritos are acceptable -- not fantastic flavor but not terrible either. The evening staff are friendly. On occasion they'll get an order wrong, under cook meat, or destroy your burrito in the process of rolling it, but generally the food is decent. The prices are a bit high for Mexican.", "author": "Scott Z."}

I went in there at 10 PM on a weeknight (they are open until 11:00 PM) and ordered a chicken burrito.  It was totally room temperature.  When I complained, the rude clerk threw it in the microwave, and when I told her I'm concerned about food safety, i.e. keep hot food hot, she threw it in the garbage and then refused to give me a refund.  Now I don't expect a red carpet when I go into a taqueria, and I already knew this place was average at best, but this was over the top.  I think it's truly unhealthy!", "author": "Jim W."}

The food is pretty cheap, the staff is really nice and nothing beats sitting in the windows on a sunny day, people -watching.
