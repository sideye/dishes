It's free for Bank of America card holders the first weekend of the month. I have an assignment to do this time, so I decided to see the exhibits. They offered the old Middle Eastern Jewish fashion exhibit, which was eye opening actually. They emphasized there were Jews all over the Middle East, North Africa, even the Orient. This was not about Northern European Jews or Jewish Americans. So that was neat. \n\nAnd then, I saw the \"Lew the Jew\" exhibit about a select group of colleagues in the tattoo business. They ran tattoo shops in New York or San Francisco in the early 20th century. This was a subculture for Jews, but there were clients I guess. \n\nSpecial museum I recommend for locals and tourists!", "author": "Denise C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-10", "description": "Apparently \"contemporary\" to this \"Jewish\" museum means a (tiny) gift shop full of books about tattoos and packets of \"temporary\" tattoos which seemed geared towards kids.  I get that this museum is taking a modern look at Jewish culture, but I would've thought they would still try to respect some basic Jewish laws...especially in light of the fact that not even a century ago, European Jews were forcibly tattooed by Nazis, ostensibly in part to additionally defile them.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of the gift shop, there used to be a big, beautiful gift shop here selling gorgeous Judaica, which was wonderful, since it really was the only place in San Francisco to find a large selection of quality Judaica.  But recently, they renovated that space and turned it instead into a \"community\" area (read:  empty lounge).  What's left of the gift shop is now a few measly shelves, mostly books, and as noted above, prominently featuring books about tattoos.  What a shame!  When I spoke with the front desk employees, they, too, expressed dismay at this development and mentioned that I was by far not the only person sad about the demise of the gift shop.\n\nAnd that's really almost all there is to know about this quiet, under-utilized museum space.  The lobby is very empty-feeling, with a stark, imposing dark wall closing in upon you as you walk in.  They usually only have a few exhibits, often marginally attached to the modern Jewish experience, in a very San Francisco kind of way.  \n\nOf all the museums here in San Francisco, the CJM is by far the most lackluster experience.  I suppose it's nice that they're open on Christmas, but so is everything else these days, so we're no longer beggars unable to be choosers.  You'll find a much more vibrant modern Jewish experience at any local Jewish event, and more Judaica at Bloomingdale's (Michael Aram, anyone?!).  You can find those books about tattoos at the library for free, and you can feel less guilty about buying them from a supposedly-Jewish institution (this way, your Bubbe won't plotz).  \n\nIn a city with some pretty excellent museums (Asian Art, SFMOMA, De Young, Legion of Honor, California Academy of Science, etc.), there's no need to settle for mediocre, or worse, a space that actively promotes desecration of Jewish law (tattoos, anyone?).  I wish I could say better things about the CJM.  It really IS a giant missed opportunity!", "author": "Amy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-24", "description": "The best things about San Francisco's Contemporary Jewish Museum I could count on a single hand:\n\n*  Their cafe, Wise Sons Deli, wafts the glorious scent of corned beef through the ground floor exhibit nearest to it.  \n\n*  Free admission for two adults using a pre-booked library \"Discover & Go\" pass.  (Check your local library to see if you can do the same).  \n\n*  The 1-hour docent led tour of an upstairs exhibit made the place at least 90% more interesting than it would have been otherwise.  \n\nThe least favored things about San Francisco's Contemporary Jewish Museum I could also count on one hand:  \n\n*  It looks large from the outside but what's on display inside is very limited.   \n\n*  The exhibits are constantly changing (the museum has no permanent collections) but the ones present on my visit weren't very compelling.  \n\n*  The \"contemporary\" focus provides little to no place for historical context.  This is nothing like Berlin's Jewish Museum or any museums focused on the Holocaust.  \n\nOn the day of my visit the CJM had 3 distinct exhibits and could have easily been toured, in its entirety, in under 90 minutes, gift shop included.  It lacked both depth and breadth and I wasn't the only one who thought so.  Outside of the upstairs exhibit a guestbook sat open for patrons to respond to the comment \"what did you think of the exhibit\".  I laughed when I saw one response, \"$14 is too much...\".  Had I paid the full admission price I could've penned that remark myself.  \n\nIf you're lucky enough to visit when the CJM is full of interesting exhibits your experience will differ significantly from mine.  That said, I'd err on the side of caution.  The CJM has many \"free days\" which you should research before visiting.  The next free day is Christmas because, you know, Hannukkah.  \n\nI'm sure I'll visit this museum again sometime and hopefully find it more compelling but with its frequently changing exhibits and no permanent collection what you see on any given day is a crapshoot.  Save your shekls and visit on a free day to avoid feeling like you've been had.", "author": "Tracey A."}

We visited the Stanley Kubrick exhibit taking place. We got there just as a tour started, so we joined in for a few minutes. The docent was very knowledgeable. There was a pretty decent collection of movie memorabilia and photos. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Stanley's collection of cameras.

Its architecture is beautiful, but there is precious little to see inside the museum. That striking cube designed by architect Daniel Liebeskind is pretty much empty. The space is supposed to be used for audio installations, but the only exhibits I've seen there consisted of a some tables where you could sit and listen to audio on earphones. Why is such a grand and interesting space needed for that? \n\nUsually, the main exhibit is devoted to the work of a person who happened to be Jewish. I've seen exhibits on William Stieg, Roz Chast, Stanley Kubrick, and Rube Goldberg. These are all interesting people, but is that enough for their work to be exhibited in a Jewish museum? An exhibit of Roman Vishniac's photos of Jewish life in Poland before the Holocaust was the only exhibit I've seen at this museum that had a real Jewish theme. An exhibit of the work of portrait photographer Arnold Newman was excellent, but, again, other than the fact that Newman was Jewish, I didn't feel that there was much of a connection between his work and Judaism.\n\nOn my last visit, I noticed that the gift shop that used to occupy the street level of the cube was gone. That's too bad, since it contained a wonderful collection of modern Jewish ceremonial objects, such as Seder plates, menorahs, and mezuzahs. They were works of art and sometimes more interesting than the exhibits in the museum.\n\nThe museum has an admission fee of $14 for adults, which creates the expectation that there's a lot to see. There isn't. \n\nThe Wise Sons Deli, located within the museum, has excellent corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, and you don't have to pay the museum admission to eat there.", "author": "Allan L."}

His films are represented through a selection of annotated scripts, production photography, lenses and cameras, set models, costumes, and props.

If you've been before, but haven't seen the current exhibit, Our Struggle: Responding to Mein Kampf, you should plan a return trip.\n\nOur Struggle is a powerful exhibit. After painter and photographer,  Linda Ellia, found a copy of Mein Kampf, she began to use the pages of the book as a canvas to express her anger before sending individual pages to people from all over the world to paint, draw, sculpt, and collage directly on them.\n\nThe project showcases the ability of art to turn something so evil into individual pieces of beauty. Each individual page tells a unique story but as an entire body of work, the story is amplified and even more beautiful. The exhibit shows art's cathartic effect to help people to express inner hurt and begin that road to healing and recovery.\n\nBe sure to take some time at the exhibit to watch the accompanying documentary, L'Art et la Maniere. It really brings Our Struggle to life. Other exhibits include The Torah Project and Jews on Vinyl. The Torah project showcases the detailed work that goes into reproducing the Torah but more importantly, the spiritual journey that each scribe embarks on. Jews on Vinyl is a fun, lighthearted exhibit and a fantastic way to end your visit to the Museum. Sit back, enjoy the unique architecture and fantastic acoustics, and listen to different interpretations of Hava Nagila. [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BFjSRfpk6gfgVptJCugy1A?select=_hJ0Vjdbpn8CT6ufon5gZA]\n\nA weekend visit to the Contemporary Jewish Museum is totally worth it.

We've been to a bris, shul, honored the high holidays, can sing Fiddler on the Roof from memory and have attended more than one Bar Mitzvah.  \n\nIt is true that I am infamously incapable of keeping kosher, am a Larry David fan and possess a modicum of Shiksa Appeal.  Also, i wear stuff on my head and can make a mean soup from scratch.  \n\nThen again, I own a copy of Mein Kamph  - in Korean - no less, just because I couldn't resist the novelty.  A real mess this one is, but what can you expect from a goyishe gal with a Cherman last name whose ancestors - and not by blood - were stuck in Alsace-Lorraine?  Some charcuterie, and quiche, maybe, but who among the Chosen could appreciate that?  What a meshugass!\n\nI digress.  \n\nThere is no confectionery reward nor real estate in the game of Candyland.

Our very own Ed U. and Lolia S. both point out the more pedigreed features of Daniel Libeskind wonderland, and you'll be better for it to read their reviews.  I love the juxtaposition  in which the building blends with the existing architecture, but is eye-poppingly now, once you cross the threshold.  \n\nA note about the entry protocol: it's not unlike an airport security checkpoint, though you are not required to doff your shoes or remove your jacket.  They don't wand you and as far as my experience goes, there are no gender-specific secondary checks.    \n\nThe staff are extremely gracious and informative, with a smile.  If it's a rainy day, use the self-check umbrella check with confidence; a coat check is also available for your/my convenience.  \n\nMilitary discounts are given with ID (a mitzvah!) and the same goes for students.

The next time 'round, I will visit the restaurant, which serves hearty, kosher, vegetarian cuisine - which is not exactly the trifecta I yearn for by default...

We came in through the gift shop and went through security. I passed my phone/keys/wallet to the guard, and he inspected my partner's bag. She beeped through the gate, but he told her she was fine and so we gathered up our stuff, and made our way through the store, stopping to look at and touch a few items. \n\nFrom the store, we made our way into the building lobby and then walked far across that lobby to the restaurant. There was only one party seated, but I could see some people eating outside. We agreed it was too cool and we'd rather sit inside where it was quite nice. We approached the counter and looked at the menu board. I grabbed two menus from the counter and handed one to my partner and we started to talk about what we were going to order. \n\nThe woman working the counter greeted us - \"Hi guys, I'm sorry but security asked if you could go back and see them.\" We were surprised, but we said sure, put the menus back and walked way way back. Did they change their mind about my partner setting off the bell when we came in? Did someone think that we took some merchandise and they were going to search us? Did we possibly leave something of ours at the gate? None of those made sense. \n\nWe cross the lobby, walk through the store, and approach the guard. He's dealing with other people so we stand there - kind of in the way - waiting and waiting. Eventually he looks up and I say \"They told us at the deli that you wanted us to come back here.\" \n\n\"The deli is closed.\" \n\n\"Yes, well they told us to come over here.\"\n\n\"The deli is open from the outside only. It's closed until 1:00 from the inside.\" \n\nIt went back and forth like this for a bit; I was mostly very confused. I didn't understand why he was telling us the deli was closed since I was just using that to explain why we were back to speak with him, they said it was his request. He was trying in a very indirect way telling us we weren't allowed to go to the deli - from the inside, until 1.\n\nEventually it became clear that this was why we were summoned back to security - because we walked without obstruction through a completely open lobby up to a counter at a restaurant that for all anyone could tell was open for business - and we were not permitted to do this. \n\nBut there's no way he could have seen where we went once we left the store - it's a huge building - we could have easily just left through the lobby exit. So it doesn't seem possible that he initiated the call to have us sent back there; what cue would he have? \n\nAnd if the deli person didn't want us there because they weren't serving until 1, why didn't they just say \"Guys, sorry, we aren't open here until 1. You can get lunch outside though.\" \n\nAnd if the museum doesn't want people walking through a certain part of the building, then why not rope those off? We could see the path to the displays was blocked off. \n\nWe were just trying to be patrons and instead of having a nice lunch, someone called security on us for the act of walking where were clearly permitted to walk. It was extremely unsettling/upsetting; I'm not really interested in being treated this way and can't imagine patronizing either the deli or the museum after that.", "author": "Steve P."}

Not only was I disappointed in the lack of exhibits (the museum fills only 25% of each exhibition room, and has nothing on display in the corridors and so on. This is vastly different to most museums that I have been to around the world), but I found it very difficult to understand the link between the artefacts on display and the Jewish culture. I was informed by my family that the artefacts I saw were painted/drawn/created/researched by Jewish people. I apologise if I sound harsh, but knowing that things are owned by Jewish people means very little to me. I did not walk away having gained any further knowledge of Jewish culture or the broader underpinnings of Judaism. I would have loved to hear stories, gain an understanding of 'the day in the life' of modern Judaism etc. \n\nI believe in order for the museum continued to be considered as a museum, it should makes some changes:\n\n1) Have the bottom floor as a history of Judaism - use the exhibition rooms, and designate certain walls of the corridors to particular historical time periods (for example, 'foundations of Judaism', 'WWII', '1980s onwards' etc). To make it specific to SF, use information researched by local academics, or display historical pictures of local Jewish people, or share the war stories of relatives of famous Californian Jews etc etc.\n\n2) Keep the second level as the contemporary exhibits - use it for visiting displays, keep the NEAT room to show new generations of Jewish work. \n\nThis way, the museum can appeal to everyone - elderly Jewish folk wanting to see what this generation are up to, non-Jewish people who want to get an overall picture of the Judaism, international visitors who want to explore SF and learn American Jewish culture further.\n\nI trademark these ideas but hey, more than happy to share them properly with anyone who thinks it might help improve this museum.", "author": "Marie S."}

I was lucky enough to walk through it yesterday before the Grand Opening today (6/07/2008).\n\nIt took a typical-for-SF nine years for architect Daniel Libeskind's design to take its final form. Libeskind is a renowned architect who lost, won, and then lost again the competition for designing the World Trade Center Memorial to commemorate 9/11 at Ground Zero in New York. And in a terrific example of historic building renovation, the museum incorporates the old Jessie Street Power Substation.

One of the most arresting is Matthew Ritchie's \"Day One\", which is a roomful of interactive digitally animated images that gives you a geophysical sense of how the earth was formed (see my photo).\n\nIf like me, you've been wondering what the slightly askew black cube is about, it contains the museum's \"Yud\" Gallery, a unique space designed to showcase sound pieces with its 65-foot ceiling, diamond-shaped skylights, and walls converging at different angles. Right now, they're presenting the Aleph-bet Sound Project, which according to their program...\"explores the Kabbalistic principle that the ancient Hebrew alphabet is a spiritual tool full of hidden meaning and harmony.\" You can hear the likes of Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson if you time your visit right.\n\nI posted a few photos for the gallery.

I learned a good many things at the Contemporary Jewish Museum.\n\nSmall and less impressive than I imagined it to be, I spent about an hour at CJM. It got old quick.

Everything about the Torah is precise and to create one is a work of art. I had the opportunity to see the Scribe at work. It's a serious business and definitely eye opening. I never knew it was all handmade and in ritual form. \n\nAs for There's a Mystery There: Sendak on Sendak, that was a real treat to see the early works of Maurice Sendak (writing and illustrations). CJM did a comprehensive job on showcasing his library, timeline, step by step process from idea conception to print, and influences. There were even video installments. I had to stop and watch Chicken Soup with Rice. There was a field trip of about 30 elementary school children. I had to wait for them to clear out to enjoy the exhibition. For the kids it was like a trip to Disneyland. For adults it's a challenge to not be affected by the darker side of Sendak's past and deep undertones in his storytelling. I actually walked around twice to take it all in.\n\nI was disappointed by the \"Being Jewish\": A Bay Area Portrait mural. It was a wall length collage but the images were repetitive at least three times. Come on CJM, there are way more Jewish people and Jewish activities in the Bay Area than that. \n\nAs for the building, I guess it's cool and all with the cube. I left feeling a little cold.

I love the attention to detail with windows opening to reflect in the interior- bringing the outside to the inside...tres cool! see photos. The museum reflects from its past and its juxtaposition may seem incongruent to some- but I like it- it spells out progress, harmony and the vicissitudes of life. Le Chaim indeed! \n\nI went here to see the Marc Chagall exhibit with the Habima (produced plays in Hebrew) and GOSET (Yiddish production theatre company)in Russia. I found the plays really interesting as it reflected various aspect of the life in Pre Stalin era and what occurred after that. I really was amazed by the quantity and performance of the plays with many productions of the mystical plays based on Kabbalah teachings. \n\nThere are posters and sketches for the plays' costumes which were quite stylistically in constructivism progressing onto cubism and futurism (main genre of Russian propaganda posters). The video clips from various plays were mesmerizing- think silent films but with more expressive forms of facial communication with grand gestures to highlight their expressions with sets designed by Falk and Chagall. I remember the best compliment of the well known King Lear actor, Solomon Mikhoels, saying that Chagall changed his acting to reflect the ethereal work of the set. \n\nThe Chagall part of the exhibit was not only informative but provided a visual starting point of an artist in his early 20's experimenting with ideas and reflecting on his own artistic influences (family and countryside). His association with the beginnings of these theatre companies and the early sketches and costumes for the theatre were reminiscent of his own paintings- ephemeral, whimsical and mystical. One could sit in the alcove and study this mural all day long- it was just that mesmerizing! \n\nPS- If you ever get to Paris- stop by the L'Opera de Paris to view one of Chagall's magnificent murals that \nadorn the ceiling.

Steig would have been 100 years old this year.  He died a few years ago and left a wonderful legacy of drawings and books.\n\nMy favorite part of the exhibit is a kids' reading corner decorated in\nbright cheery colors with portraits from his many books and a dangling Dr. Desoto (mouse) preparing to do dental work on a fox.\n\nThere is a short video interview with Steig who talks about his childhood and his writing and illustrating.  Interestingly he wasn't fond of drawing which is hard for me to believe since I treasure his magical and enchanting drawings.\n\nMy favorite book of Steig's is \"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble.\"\nIt always makes me cry.

Like too many American museums, the building itself is the attraction with nothing worth seeing within.  \n\nThe Jewish museum confronts the conundrum of existence awkwardly.\nOn the one hand, if it really devoted itself to Jewish culture and religion, it would not have a broad enough appeal to attract significant visitors.  It therefore mounts exhibits that are only peripherally Jewish and have been mounted at other institutions far better such as Stein. The rationalizations that they offer in the way of a \"uniquely Jewish view\" fall flat. In addition, they are confined to show-casing 3rd rate Israeli artists such as the Wiley.\n\nMore distressing are exhibits such as Black Sabbath which are revisionist history.  While there may well have been Jewish song writers who collaborated with Harlem jazz artists, the history of white including Jewish Tin Pan Alley is not one of collaboration but expropriation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-12", "description": "The ongoing Charlotte Salomon exhibit at the Contemporary Jewish Museum is not to be missed. \"Life? or Theatre?\" is a collection of hundreds of gouaches that explode with color, emotion, humor, confusion, wit, and the confinement and quiet terror brimming within the hearts, histories and futures of the many people and circumstances in Charlotte Salomon's life and times. One could spend hours poring over the exhibit's offerings of 300 of Salomon's 769-gouache masterwork, which she conceived and completed in her two-year hiding period in the south of France just before her murder at Auschwitz. It is a visually rich and emotionally stirring work of an astoundingly talented, too-young artist that varies from stylistic references to Chagall, Van Gogh and Modigliani to post-expressionist sketches crammed with manic introspection. Packed with information on Salomon's family life and simultaneously reflecting the growing climate in Europe.\n\n\"Life? or Theatre?\" leaves CJM after July, and with today's opening of the Gertrude Stein exhibit I will definitely be stopping by before summer is over. CJM boasts beautiful and eclectic architecture on the outside and has a uniquely narrow but still broad space to present some interesting foods for thought. Not sure if they offer audiophones for an extra charge but it may be beneficial to get whatever they supplement you with, because the exhibition space is quite dim and the signs are fitted quite close together, leading to inevitable crowding.\n\nWhen I visited last Saturday, the space was notably gutted and not quite suited for company due to their preparation for the Stein exhibit. But accordingly, the admission price was discounted to a flat $5 for all. My friend got in for free thanks to Bank of America museum weekends, and there are still more opportunities to visit CJM at a discounted fee, or none at all (check website and funcheapsf.com, if interested). I would definitely pay full price in the future to catch a double feature of these two extraordinary women and also take in the interactive exhibit upstairs and ping pong on the main floor (!!).", "author": "Nuri K."}

I've been a couple of times for there literary exhibits which I do enjoy the imagination they but into the space. However I will not return due to the security that is excessive! Most recently went for the curious george exhibit where I was stalked by security and every move I made was watched to be sure I did not place a finger on the glass. At one point Security ran up to tell me to get my hands off the glass-case to which I took my hands out of my pockets looking bewildered. Not to mention this is a Curious George Exhibit....kid friendly??? I think not unless you want your kids rushed by security. \n\nNot to mention the TSA standard security to simply go into the Museum store. As a Curious George lover one day on a lunch break I thought I would stop into the store but after I was asked to take off my jewelry in order to get cleared through the Security gate I quickly turned around. I think there is a nearby children specialty store that I'd feel more comfortable shopping in. \n\nI gave this museum a couple chances but I am still not impressed, nor do I have patience for the amount of security lingering.

Parked at the extremely overpriced Mission garage for the day and walked over to CJM. Entered and the security guard was a funny guy, who seemed to be doing the best he could at his job. He had to thoroughly check our bags and get us all to go through the security screener. My son was focused on playing with the auto-open button on the door and the security guy was super nice as he tried to coax my son through the security screener. \n\nWe went up to the ticket area and the man who helped me at the desk was very nice as well. I bought some tickets off of groupon and left the print out at home. He took the info off my iPhone and just said, I'll trust that you're going to delete it later. I said of course. Very nice of him to do that. We had to check our bags before going in so it was off again to the security area.\n\nOnce inside, I had to change my son's poopy dipe. The bathrooms were very clean and I especially loved that the large stall had not only a clean changing table with l liners, but also a sink. This would prove helpful on our way out as my son decided to create another poopy dipe.\n\nWe finally got to the CG exhibit and it was very disappointing. The exhibit was clearly NOT curated for young children. All the displays were encased in plexi, the pictures were at eye level and the interactive area was a measly four sad looking bean bags, a bunch of worn CG books and a small reading table. My son was very excited to see so many CG things but I spent a lot of time telling him to use his \"museum\" voice because the atmosphere was so quiet and because one of the security guards kept following us around. He even freaked out when my son got close to one of the emergency exit doors! At that point I knew it was time to leave.\n\nWe went outside and hung out on the bench for awhile and then decided to venture up the stairs to the \"Black Sabbath\" exhibit which was pretty cool. My son actually enjoyed that exhibit more because he was able to listen to some pretty cool music on headphones. He especially liked the Aretha Franklin cover of \"Swanee.\" There was a camera crew there and a local tv anchor filming for the event that evening with Jimmy Mathis. My son was fascinated with the cameras and the cameramen gave him nice smiles as we left the exhibit. As we were waiting for the elevator, guess who comes walking out?? Johnny Mathis. Very cool. He stopped to smile at my son who was holding his CG and then continued on with his entourage into the exhibit. \n\nOverall, this museum is architecturally beautiful and the exhibits are very interesting. However I've taken my son to many other museums in the Bay Area and this one has the least kid-friendly feel so far. I'll likely come back when I can get a sitter.", "author": "Dawn L."}

Very quick, not exciting.\n\n-California Dreaming, an exhibit on the history of Jews in the Bay Area.  This was a good idea, really poorly executed.  They tried to cover way, way too much material and the result is superficial overviews of a thousand different topics.  An in-depth look at just a few of the topics (anti-Semitism, anti-immigrant opinion, Aquarian Judaism, Levi Strauss, the early synagogues of San Francisco, Jewish boarding houses--any of these would have made fascinating exhibits) would have been much better.\n\nThe current exhibit however is VERY wall-of-texty...there is not much in the way of artifacts, so it's largely boring portrait photos next to paragraphs and paragraphs of text, and the video that plays in the middle of the room is clearly audible from every part of the exhibit, which is incredibly distracting.  I had to plug my ears to read the captions.  This exhibit would make a great web page.  It's kind of lousy as an exhibit.  I'd give this exhibit two stars.\n\n-Black Sabbath, which has listening booths where you can hear African-American music influenced by Jews or Judaism.  In total contrast to California Dreaming, which was tons of text and almost no artifacts, this exhibit has very little text and is almost entirely audio.  It's cool, if you're into that.  I'd say this exhibit is three stars, but more like four if you're into music.\n\n-Ezra Jack Keats:The Snowy Day--this was by FAR the exhibit with the most people in it, with good reason.  Fantastic exhibit, features wonderful art and also conveys history very well through a judicious combination of artifacts, interpretive text, and art--it strikes a good balance.

It's fairly unique, though definitely modern, so if you're not into modern design you might be turned off by it. The architect is Daniel Libeskind, the same guy that won the bid to be head architect for the new World Trade Center building. For the CJM building, he's incorporated some of the Hebrew letters both on for form the outside shape and on the inside lobby, but in more geometric form than the traditional letters. Using part of the phrase \"L'Chaim,\" (To Life), the Hebrew letters that spell \"chai\" --\"chet\" and \"yud,\" form the shape of the building. The Hebrew word \"Pardes\", spelled with 4 Hebrew letters (), and meaning \"orchard,\" is embedded in the wall and the floor of the interior lobby.\n\nThe exhibits we saw were: \nJews on Vinyl - Some people spent 8 years traveling around the country collecting albums by Jewish musicians - there were music stations set up to listen to the music, album artwork was on display on the wall and a video monitor, and there were books to flip through and looks at album artwork and information. The exhibit room was set up like a 70's living room.\n\nAs It Is Written - This was a great and extensive exhibit on the Torah. How it is written, stored, the unique quirks of the lettering used, who can write the Torah, when and how it is recited. In keeping with a progressive Jewish view, they have a female scribe who is normally on site writing out a Torah, who you can talk to and aks questions. It being Saturday, a holy day for them, she was not there. A kiosk with the People's Torah was on display - more information can be found here: www.peoplestorah.org.\n\nG-dcast - Outside of the Torah exhibit was a screen with a bunch of web-based animated shorts; I only watched a few of these, but my friend sat and watched quite a few.\n\nOur Struggle: Responding to Mein Kampf - This was really awesome. Paris-based artist, Linda Ellia, invited hundreds of people to respond to Mein Kampf by taking pages of it and writing, painting, collaging, and sculpt directly on the pages. 600 of them are on display.

I thought I might see something new at the exhibition here.\n\nThe theme of the exhibition was the Russian-Jewish Theatre in the post-revolution Soviet Union. Very unexpected layout with old documentaries showing on the isolated flat panels, illustrations by such well-known artists as Natan Altman and Robert Falk, pre-war photographs, and of course murals and paintings by Marc Chagall.\n\nI was a little disappointed at the amount of Chagall's paintings - just 2 actual color oil paintings at the end of the exhibition.

The majority of Chagall's work was watercolors and sketches to theatrical decorations and some biblical themes. \n\nI learnt a lot of new things, however. Like the fact that Chagall never signed his theatre murals in 1920. He finally signed them on his visit to the Soviet Union in 1973. I also learnt that he died at age 98! \n\nOverall, the historic aspect was rather powerful. The actual Chagall - rather limited.", "author": "Tatyana S."}

I hate to say it but the exhibit on how they jammed this hebrew symbol into the historic Jessie Street Substation was my favorite part.  Why's that?  Well, put it this way: when the gift shop seems to contain more useful info than the museum itself, that's a problem.  For example, why bother with the \"Jewish Bay Area\" exhibit, essentially a narrative-less scrapbook, when you could pick up the \"Jewish San Francisco\" book that actually dives into stories? \n\nI recommend you pair a visit here with the MOAD.  They're both small, they both deal with racial/cultural identities, and they highlight each other's shortcomings through contrast.  While MOAD can be too generic and pedestrian, CJM has the opposite problem--it can be inaccessible for those of us lacking much of a context in Judaism.  In other words, while I understand that the focus is on *contemporary* Jewish artists, how about a little permanent exhibit on where Judaism has historically fit in arts-wise?  Maybe a brief discourse on Hellenic vs Hebraic philosophy?\n\nAt any rate, if you're an audiophile, you'll want to visit just to get inside that cube, which is where they do \"sound\" exhibits.  But I'd wait for something better than \"Jews on Vinyl\".  The previous exhibit, \"The Aleph-Bet Sound Project\", for instance sounded much cooler.", "author": "Wes M."}

Judaism can be annoying, what with all the arguing and the keeping kosher and the smiting. Heck, some combination of those were probably what doomed this museum's merger with the Magnes Museum in Berkeley.  (The Magnes Museum is an old-timey, v1.0 museum that actually has boring old things in it.)\n\nPlus as a Jew, I'm always happy to have some other fun way to be self-obsessed, as well as to think I'm unique and special, just  like my Jewish grandmother told me.  There's a reason why Barnes & Noble can have a Judaica section: because we just can't get enough of ourselves.\n\nBut being Jewish in the Bay Area is fundamentally about assimilation.  Most of us Bay Area Jews are escaping the cultural constraints of more repressive, traditional locations like Los Angeles or Miami.  \n\nWe come here to be like everybody else, while imagining we're totally unique and different.  We want the American Dream while cooking like French, pretending we're black, and marrying Asians.  (Yeah, this last part is really true: the \"Being Jewish: A Bay Area Portrait\" exhibit demonstrates that Asians and Jews go together like chocolate and peanut butter, or perhaps Christmas morning and dimsum.)\n \nWhen you see the random, deliberately ahistorical, and not terribly captivating collection of exhibits, you ask yourself: once you've seen the building, what is this museum going to do that anyone will care about?  Is it for Jews or for everybody?  Is it just going to end up being \"a bunch of random stuff by famous Jews\"?  Will we one day see...\n\n    \"Jewish Everyman: A Judd Apatow Retrospective\"?  \n\n    \"Flying Cows: All-You-Can-Eat Chagall\"\n\n    \"Don't Mess with the Zohar: Kaballah in Popular Culture\"?\n\n    \"The Mysterious Beauty of Weird-Ass Menorahs\"?\n\n   \"Nam Myoho Renge Shmoe: Jubus at the JewMu\"?\n\n    \"Shpilkes: That Annoying Jewish Mother Thing by Mike Myers and the Queasy Embarrassment We Feel About People Who Imitate It\"?\n\nIn other words, I'm mystified by this place and what it will do for an encore.  \n\nOn the other hand, the Libeskind touch on the outside is beautiful.  Get up close to the blue steel cladding and touch it -- it's like the whole building has the tactile hardness of an iPod.  But as a whole, it has nothing of the impact of the Jewish Museum Berlin, another Libeskind work.  \n\nWait, did I say blue steel?  \"Preening & Overweening: The Magic of Ben Stiller.\"  I called it first....", "author": "Daniel S."}

The plaza entry is expansive and gracious, although it feels in the last stages of completion.  The landscaping is new.  The outside is attractive and interesting, a 1907 Willis Polk designed brick former PG&E Substation.  The Daniel Liebeskind addition to the original building is compelling w/ out being overwhelming.  It faces the Museum of Craft and Folk Art, which also looks like it's worth a visit.  \n\nTonight we met our friends Sherri and Ron here.  Thursday night the museum is open late and they're still working.  Sherri and I wandered through the gift shop a bit while waiting for Ron to arrive, so we didn't do a thorough perusal.  The collection of Judaica was interesting and beautiful.  When he arrived I checked my coat and purse so I wouldn't have to carry them.  The William Steig exhibit on the first floor was excellent, ranging from his doodles and drawings for family members to his family history to his cartoons for the New Yorker to his children's books, one of which was the basis for the Shrek movies.  His work and his life were well documented, enhancing and informing the work on display.  The  exhibit devoted to being Jewish in the Bay Area was personal and appealing, w/ photos of young and old, parents and children, family groups of all sorts, weddings and rituals of Jewish life.  In front of the photos, which had been donated by members of the Jewish community, were personal objects and oddities, like a denim yarmulke and a bobblehead rabbi doll from last year's Jewish Heritage Day at the Giants' game.  More serious were a ketubah, a seder plate and an old menorah which looked as if it held oil rather than candles.  My only complaint was that some of the photos were repeated.  I would have preferred each be singular.  But I found the exhibit surprised me by bringing tears to my eyes.\n\nThe entire second floor is devoted to a single exhibit,  \"In the Beginning: Artists Respond to Genesis\".  There were the works of contemporary artists and artists going back centuries, paintings, drawings and multimedia presentations.  One, by Ben Rubin, was a recreation of the Horn Antenna that allowed two scientists in the mid 50s to collect the sounds that were later recognized to be the remnants of the Big Bang.   Some of the sounds collected were playing and the bang when it came reverberated throughout the second floor.  There were too many exhibits for me to describe, but suffice it to say they were varied, interesting and fun.  One small room had bibles on display dating as far back as the 12th century, beautifully illuminated and illustrated.  Back in a far corner was showing a video of theologians and scientists and artists discussing the meanings of Genesis.  It was interesting and thought provoking and was one of my favorite parts of that exhibit.  \n\nThe museum feels young and unfinished.  I think it will discover over time what it wants to say, but  I liked what it had to say to me today and I look forward to what it says in future years.", "author": "Toni M."}

At which point, J (half Jewish) joked he was too Jewish to pay for the Jewish museum.\n\nAll jokes and laziness aside, I finally flew solo to this elusive spot last night to see Warhol's \"10 Jews...\" exhibit currently on display. The drinks were good, the Candybar bites were tasty, and the Jenny Wehrt pop art was fun and complimented the event perfectly.\n\nI love the building and the art. Daniel Libeskind designed the space (and that giant cube that has been freaking people out for months), and it shows in the characteristic angular, light-well style. It's confusing to get around, and there are secret passages and light pockets everywhere. The Warhol exhibit was phenomenal; I really got a feel for his technique, his ideas, and the controversy over whether these portraits were an exploit, a tribute, or neither.\n\nAll the exhibits, including one about several artists' visual responses and interpretations to Genesis, were shown in the perfect place; a place that celebrates Jewish history and art using modern media.\n\nBut it's a very small exhibition space, and visiting collections seem to be its only cache.

A revelation of some of the controversies surrounding these portraits, general controversy about the artist, as well as a few other items gave a greater sense of how the pieces and their creation fit into the canon of American twentieth century art.\n\nAlthough I had known previously about the Warhol exhibit, I only found out the John Zorn presents the Aleph-Bet Sound Project was just upstairs on the second level as well. I also was quite surprised that Zorn's compositional palate includes not only 20th and 21st century modern/post-modern electronically generated sound/sound event works, but more traditional acoustical instrumentation as well. The only drawback to the sound project exhibit was its scheduled non-looping multi-hour run; in other words, unless a museum-goer were to spend a number of hours at the museum, only a portion of the presented works could be sampled. However, it should be prefaced that this Yelper also has much musical training, so he's a bit more particular about sampling music; from the brief sample of two musical works, my friend and I were able to have a taste of Zorn's different musical personalities.\n\nSo glad for such an eclectic museum, even within its focused scope; in the broader picture, glad for the cultural resources such as JCM that make SF the city we have today!", "author": "Ryan T."}

To be less charitable would be say that they actually put some thought into the museum's contents, and this is the best they could come up with.\n\nThis is not a museum.  I go to museums to learn something.  The only thing I learned at this museum is that the Pixar film \"Shrek\" was based on a children's book.  And it's barely Jewish too.  Turns out that that writer of that children's book happens to be Jewish.  Whoopee...let's devote a third of the entire building to him!  \n\nThe rest of the museum is a giant piece of performance art that gets old in about 3 seconds.

There are all of the rules and these traditions...it was wild. It's like 308,405 painstaking characters. 64 pages of cow-hide parchment. Wow. I thought that whole exhibit was great. On most days, this official scribe is actually working on the project right there in the museum, but of course I had to go on the Sabbath. Dammit!

They explain the ink, the parchment, the whole, serious ritual. Very very interesting. Also they explain how the torah scrolls are used and stored. \n\nThere was also an exhibit about Jews on Vinyl (records), which I skipped because, well, I'm not a fan of vinyl.

I wanted bagels and lox at the cafe. I wanted my Bubbe to give me a kiss on the cheek when I walked in (while simultaneously shoving gefilte fish down my throat).

Don't get me wrong...I love museums that are packed wall to wall with exhibits, but it was nice to see a space so well cared for and thought out.  \n\nMy son and I went to the CJM specifically for the Maurice Sendak exhibit.  it was well thought out and organized, colorful, and gave a thorough look at Sendak's art, philosophy, and life.  I learned a lot about Sendak and about the process of illustrating children's books.  Fascinating.\n\nWe took a walk upstairs and checked out another exhibit on the Torah.  Amazing!  I was blown away.  The beauty of the displays, the care taken to explain the Torah and related items in layman's terms, the space given to these sacred objects...all amazing.  My son and I both learned so much!  We were amazed at the process of writing a Torah scroll and had no idea how much work goes into each individual character as it is written.  \n\nWe also went to the gallery in the crazy shaped modern part of the building.  This gallery is a piece of art in and of itself.  One has to walk through it to appreciate it.\n\nI loved how spaced out the galleries and exhibits were.  I love SF MoMA and the De Young but appreciated the slower, stretched out pace at the CJM.\n\nMy *only* complaint was one security guard in the Sendak exhibit.  She was overly zealous and turned off many patrons.  At one point she goaded a visitor to the point that the woman, who was doing nothing wrong, ended up furious and stormed out.  A few minutes later I overheard two other guards discussing the situation and one telling the other that this was the norm when that particular woman was on duty.

This old PG&E power substation was designed with new contemporary cubes representing youth and old.  The interior of this building is symbolic in many ways.  Appears the tour has left me to believe much of what you see is from your open mind and what you make of what you see.  There is no right or wrong answer.  On the first floor lobby, you can interpret the flat wall with pictures of Jewish life, families, and friends which face a plain up and outward slanted wall as life and happiness meeting an open future.  Your life experiences determine your views.  The entrance wall facing another slanted wall has abbreviated Hebrew letters in light which extends on to the floor design.  Ingenious!  \n\nThe second floor room  with 36 windows seems puzzling at first until you see and hear what is going on around you.  The room is void of furnishings except for a few seats.  You can sit or stand and listen to the piped in music which slowly invade your mind.  From outside the room door, you don't see much.  Upon entering the room, the entry wall has a write-up of the artist, John Zorn who organized sound based letter of the Hebrew alphabet.   \n\nThe exterior garden is peaceful with contemporary pools of water, lush green grassy patches, and wooden benches.  This is a nice urban touch to what is a very busy street  where you don't have the feel from the inner part of this street.  You're surrounded by different eras of architecture, building sizes, old and new, religious, shops, and eateries.  \n\nI suppose I can't expect to see much on display since this museum opened recently.  Don't expect to find sad Jewish holocaust history or stories here.  Look for more lively subjects as the word, \"LIFE\" gives meaning for this museum.  This visit didn't have much visual other than architecture.  I look forward to the upcoming Warhol exhibit later this year.  \n\nL'Chaim", "author": "Nanette L."}

There's a contorted blue box juxtaposed with a more classic looking building.  The graphic design also offers a glimpse of \"edgy\" art curation/direction.\n\nThe museum is deceptively grand in scale.  There are only two floors to explore and not many places to take a seat.  The lobby of the museum oddly feels narrow and cramped.  Why would they do this?  Why???  Plus an 8 dollar student admission fee??!  Good thing I still carry my student ID around.\n\nThe cramped feeling continues throughout the building.  Not only is this place cramped, but it also uses a lot of odd angles and Fry's Electronic-like exposed ceilings.  I'm all for cutting-edge design that takes risks and chances, but please, make it work.  It felt like I was walking on the German film set of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\"\n\nThe exhibits were okay.  Yet you think with a new museum they could kick it off with a bang.  I think the title \"Contemporary\" really threw me off.  I found the art to center more around Jewish art in the broader sense.  It'd be cool if they could just have a permanent collection, alongside the newer exhibitions, yet they don't have a lot of space to work with.\n\n----\n\nSeeing that there's only two narrow levels to explore at $9, you'd be better off going to the MOMA or going to the movies (whether you're Jewish or not).

Art done by them?  It just seems really, broad and vague.  \n\nBut I was impressed, maybe because I didn't have any expectations.  The exterior architecture was very aesthetically pleasing.  It wasn't some obtrusive in-your-face piece that screams \"look at me.\"  Neither was it a sloppy house designed to be overlooked.  It had a handsome style, well proportioned and good balances of the brick building, modern lawn and an \"infinite\" pond outside.  It doesn't take away the old charm of the Catholic church next door, but fits well in its busy Market and Mission setting too.  \n\nThe content of the museum was pretty simple.  We saw the William Steig exhibit which was great.  And there was a Genesis inspired exhibit upstairs.  \n\nThe best part was the music room on the second floor.  It's a large and bare room with no decorations.  Walls are shaped, well, very interestingly and hard to figure out.  There is a schedule of a list of music played throughout the day.  We caught a piece by Lou Reed.  It was, if I can use adjectives thrown around in the music industry correctly, raw and moving, stripped to the basics and yet extremely complex. \n\nI fantasized about coming here for in the middle of a busy work day and immerse myself in this hidden world and just sit and think.  Of course, that'll never happen in real life cuz I don't really have a high stress job and I got to go to the gym during lunchtime!\n\nAnyway, for that room alone, CJM is worth visiting.  It reminded me of this cool exhibit I saw at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in NYC that had several screens with words on them that went along with cool music.  Seriously!  I am surprised I don't see more experiments with new medium like, hello, computer stuff, in museums.  There is so much you can do to combine image, sound, texture, space, etc. etc. \n\nBefore I digress further, I have to mention the cleverest T-shirt we saw at the shop.

Very playful exhibit. The various artist takes on The Beginning were thoughtful, funny, weird and did their job in provoking thought even if some of it was derisive.  Part of the fun was just watching people react to the space and watching how kids played in the sound exhibit. Waiting for a friend, I ended up listening to several pieces from abstract to Jimmi Hendrix. I can only say that with 6 Bose speakers in parallel, the sound can play well in a small space as well as a convention hall for which Bose is designed.\n\nClose to Montgomery BART station and lots of cafes and more museums.

Liebeskind creates a beautiful statement with the rectangle and disparately placed squared windows to keep the eye moving and while your eye is moving this rectangle become predominate and yet more harmonious.  \n\nThe interior has considerable harmony and provides plenty of walled space for portraiture and other art works.  Inside the rectangle is a place to stop; breathe, everyone in this chamber goes to the windows to view the outside world; as if this were a spacecraft--the windows do little more than let in light; the purpose is not to see everything.  The lobby is grand; and the rectangle and sharp angles filled with light also dance the eye from one pattern to the next; this space is a great entry path to the floor above.  The gallery space is small but that does not surprise since the footprint on the exterior does not mislead one to thinking there is a larger footprint.

Their subjects tend to be quite appealing, and they exhibit lots of aspects of each.

It really takes ALOT to make me write a review on yelp - gotta be really fantastic blow your mind good or just so horrible that lettin the world know about it isn't an option.\n\nI've seen this place a few times and the architecture is cool - I soo love that black cube - it's really a great piece of work.  Well, the other day while waiting to meet a friend of mine who was running late, I found myself riding around and ending up in front of this \"museum\" again.  I took a few pictures of it with my ipad and decided why not go in and see who the architect was.  well, when I walked in, this black security guard looked at me all snotty and rude and said I couldn't leave my bike outside by the door, to which I replied, yeah I just wanted to know who the architect was, nothing else, that I just loved the building and was wondering who had done it - to which he replies, you have to walk through the metal detector, to which i said sure, here's my backpack and feel free to look thru it I had nothing to hide and wasn't gonna steal, could i just look at the books there he had pointed out that were about the architect.. to which he says, YOU NEED TO WALK THRU THE METAL DETECTOR AND OPEN YOUR BAG!!!! i'm like, whoa dude chill out man, jesus - here: and dumped out all my (very few) things in my backpack and left them there and then went thru the metal detector and then just went over to look at the books that were about the architect.  next thing i know, ANOTHER security guard tells me i need to go thru the metal detector - i'm like, um dude, I already DID go thru it, but hey, you know what, i'll go thru it another 3 or 4 times if you wanna really be douche about it it, at which point i ran a few circles thru the metal detector and back around, while he's telling me sir, you need to show us whats in your backpack- i'm like, umm, dude, i just emptied it all out...anyways, they were a bunch of unbelievable fuc**ng douchebag pricks - the most ridiculous part?? was told years ago i'm sephardic jewish - at least on dad's side supposedly - anyways, i'm prolly more jewish than those prick security guards - f**k that place.  pretentious, rude ass motherf**kers.  nice architecture, but SERIOUSLY??? THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO TREAT SOMEBODY THAT JUST WANTS TO COME IN AND FIND OUT ABOUT THE ARCHITECT????

That's because there really isn't anything else positive to say about this museum. There is only one exhibit (on the first floor) that has anything to do about Judaism, and it's very small and not very instructive. The rest of the museum can be most chartiably described as \"random.\"\n\nThere are so many interesting topics that this museum could have presented -- holidays and traditions, symbols, the differences and similarities among the various flavors of Judaism (reform, conservative, orthodox, etc.), how Jews have adapted their traditions to different countries around the world, Israel, the Holocaust, the Jewish diaspora, famous Jews, etc. None of these topics are addressed,  except for a couple of them in a very limited and mishmash way in the very small \"being Jewish in the Bay Area\" exhibit on the first floor.\n\nIn summary, I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this a \"Jewish Museum.\" It's not very Jewish, and it barely has enough stuff to be considered a museum.", "author": "David O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-25", "description": "\"...if every possible universe can exist, then free will is meaningless, since every result will eventually occur.\"\n\nSo said the abstract on the wall. I was standing at the top floor of the San Francisco Contemporary Jewish Museum. To my right was an elderly security guard. To my left was Matthew Ritchie's art installation labeled \"Day One\". The theme of the top floor was artists reactions to Old Testament story of Genesis.\n\n6 circles dominated the wall. Each was some type of monitor screen built into the wall blasting images of creation. They were mostly indecipherable except the top circle which seemed to show images of trees. Each circle was connected through intricate lace patterns that were reminiscent of the trace patterns of Ryan McGuinness. The abstract stated that the installation can be interpreted in two ways. Each circle can either represent: a. 6 different days of creation. or b. 6 different universes spinning off from each other. The latter is a nice nod to modern physics. The abstract ended with a little blurb about how the observer of the art piece is a part of the art installation. Through observation of genesis, the viewer takes on the role as a witness to a creation. The blurb went to expound on how this is a participatory universe and that by observation we are reaffirming our place as creator and creation. It was pretty opaque, but I liked the allusions to Heisenberg.\n\nI basically reject the quote at the very top of this entry. Let's say every possible universe can exit. I feel that free will is tied to an individual and an individual experience. What Dennis in Universe A experience does not relate to what Dennis in Universe B experience because Dennis in both parallel universes are two distinct individuals. Each Dennis is trapped in his own universe living in a branched cut off from all other possible Denni. Having every possible result occur will only mean something if every Dennis could experience it. Like perhaps a massive uber-Dennis consciousness that spans through all possible parallel universes.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThe Contemporary Jewish Museum stands adjacent to St. Patricks Catholic Church across from the Metreon and Yerba Buena gardens. It's build on the old PGE Jessie street power station.\n\nThe old electrical power street station buildings was entwined with new additions to form the letters \"Chet\" and \"Yud\". Combined those two letters spell out \"Cha\", the Hebrew word for life.\n\nAt the cafe they were selling Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches for $5.40. By far the most expensive PBJ ever.", "author": "Poincare's Conjecture N."}

I'm well connected with the Jewish community where art is concerned (and have been for over 40 years). There are a few phenomenal projects (a project, for example, called the Sparks project which focused on Jewish mysticism and used new media)  that they've refused out of the same blindness that traditional Jewish art museum/organizations have with respect to post-modern art addressing such topics (i.e., it's either too modern and cutting edge or it's too traditional and ubiquitous both of which are simply 'lack of vision'). It's very sad but not irreparable however the Contemporary JM would need to get some very new unorthodox blood into its curatorial \"cabinet\" to do this and visitors should have this background when they go.\n\nFYI - Historically, some wonderful long time Bay area art people tried to get the museum to merge with the Magnes museum in Berkeley. The idea was to provide a much biger picture and more comprehensive idea of art and Judaism in one major institution but the 2 organizations just were unwilling to compromise towards that goal (the downfall of numerous dreams and progressive ideas).\n\nSetting aside the CJM's fairly consistent ignoring of Bay area artists working on topics and ideas that relate to Judaism as well as all of the above, the CJM is worth a visit.", "author": "A N."}

Saving the old substation facade was a requirement, of course, but the lack of integration into the new portions of the building is disappointing. The old facade just sits there, with a big dark tilted box stuck onto the end of it. Maybe the view is more exciting from the upper windows of the Hyatt hotel next door. Could more have been done to the exterior of the project to create more interest for the pedestrian? The sidewalk/plaza elevation is flat and boring, save for the  pleasant, sunny area of reflecting pools and benches. \n    On the inside, I found the soaring public area entry hall space to be too narrow for the height, and overly cluttered overhead with plain beige ceramic tile columns, a jangle of support  beams and an old industrial hoist. The massive tilted wall is surely exciting, and gives a big clue to the general theme of the project: If in doubt, tilt it. \n    For the generous footprint of the building, I was expecting more art exhibition space, considering that there are 2 floors. The public area, education exhibit area, and hallways eat up a lot of real estate. Is there more interior hidden away somewhere? The big tilted box portion of the museum is currently hosting an art sound installation, so the room is empty but for a few crafty benches, some speakers, and 3-4 people listening to the sound. All one can do is close the eyes, or stare at the room, which, despite the tilted walls and scattered window openings,  gets old quickly. I would love to see a sculpture exhibit in there, so that the space becomes part of the visual experience, not the entire experience. \n    I know I'll be back eventually, and maybe a really inspiring art exhibit will provide a better venue to visit this museum. For now, I am regretfully disappointed, and can't see this museum enticing visitors to return.\nLarry", "author": "laurence c."}

I walked pretty slowly and read almost everything but I still went through the entire museum in about 45 minutes. On the plus side they are pretty technologically advanced for such a small museum.

I spent most of my time in the gift shop/bookstore and at the Andy Warhol Hall. They have a lot of really good books on architecture - famous work and people from around the world. Their theme that time was \"in the beginning...\" so their 2nd floor exhibit revolves around that subject - mostly about the story of creation in the Bible. They have a lot of different on-going projects and activities, such as \"making a commitment to your self \" and the \"recording your history\", which I think applies only to the Jewish community or anyone who has a Jewish blood in them.

My cousin was visiting from the East coast, and I had waited for her so we could go together. How incredibly disappointing (the museum, not my cousin's visit). \n\nThe admission is 10 bucks, although we were both able to get student discounts of $2 using old student IDs. We started in the cafe, which was good, although the service could have been a disaster. The people behind the counter were very nice, and we both ordered these yummy sounding pizzas with salmon and gruyere. They brought the pizzas to our table and we dug in. We were both wondering where the salmon was but were starving so just kept eating. About halfway through, the gal came over and casually mentioned that they had switched their menu already and we had gotten a completely different pizza than we ordered. Is that OK? Um. we're halfway finished it now. Maybe you could have mentioned that when you dropped the pizzas off? \n\nAnyways, we finished quickly because we were anxious to see the museum. We walked up the stairs to an exhibit room to see the \"Jews on Vinyl\" exhibit. It was OK. The room was set up like a '50s living room with a couple of record players to listen to songs (the ones I tried were broken). That took all of about 10 minutes. Then we walked out and were told that the only other exhibit open was downstairs. OK. So we went back downstairs to a room with seder plates to celebrate Passover. Now, this was pretty cool and some of the seder plates were very unique. But here we were, 2 of us in a huge room, with 2 Nazi-like guards (no pun or irony intended) watching our every move who looked bored out of their minds. Anything we went to look at they quickly moved in and reminded us that we couldn't touch or take pictures. I've never been so reprimanded at the mere thought of taking a picture in a museum before (well, maybe once in Prague). \n\nThere was one other small exhibit with various pictures and memorabilia about bay area jewish life in a case along the wall. There were some great old pins (Milk for Supervisor, No on prop 6, etc.) that I wanted to take a picture of, and again, the museum gestapo pounced and gave some lame excuse as to how these were pictures of museum members' families and wouldn't want their pictures \"out there\". Um. Hello? They're on a wall at a museum. \n\nAnyways. The MOMA, De Young, Academy of Sciences, Legion of Honor, and hundreds of other smaller museums abound in the city.

The public area in front is lovely, and the mix of old and new architecture in the building's exterior really makes for a breathtaking effect. But my advice would be to admire the exterior and skip going inside unless you can get in on one of their free or reduced-price nights. Another option would be to just visit the museum store or cafe. \nThe interior of the museum really makes a good case for vertical walls. Since most of the interior walls are slanted, and because of poor exhibition-space design generally, the ratio of white-painted sheetrock overhangs to space in which one can actually interact with the art (or do other human things, like, say, explore, look out windows, etc.) is something like 10 to 1. We visited when the Warhol show was up, and a great deal of material was crammed into a tiny space, not to mention the throngs of folks crammed in (it was actually the only real exhibit up when we were there). The signage is atrocious--text too small to read from more than a foot or so away--and when I got pushed by the crowd within a few inches of one of the exhibits, a guard got after me...she's got a tough job, because with that poor use of space I'm sure people are often accidentally getting too close to the goods. \nNormally I wouldn't be so critical of a space like this, but with two incredible museums in the immediate vicinity (SFMOMA and Yerba Buena Center) that are both interestingly designed AND full of contemporary and accessible cultural content, if you're making a list, do yourself and any claustrophobic visitors you might have a favor and edit the CJM out.", "author": "Too Vast B."}
