Hard to spot at first needs a bigger sign but located right on the mission strip and has a classy interior if your on a date. The service is super friendly and quick and the food extremely authentic no mexican people serving corn based empanadas here. The prices are cheap for peruvian food as well. \n\nIf your hungry I recomend any of the daily special meat and rice platters but this time I ordered 3 appetizers due to childhood nostalgia and a craving of peruvian sauces. I went with a crab causa rellena huancaina, ocopa potatoes, and aji amarillo ceviche.\n\nThe ocopa has sliced peruvian boiled potatoes served cold and topped with bright green black mint based ocopa sauce served warm and side of hardboiled egg and lettuce. The causa is layered mashed potatoes with a layer of meat inbetween(i chose crab) and topped hardboiled egg or olive and creamy/cheesy aji based huancaina sauce like a little cake in appearance. Aji peppers are a trademark used in most peruvian dishes and vary in heat but are usually milder and flavorful. The ceviche(raw seafood marinated in citrus pepper juice) came with alot of fish and they used an interesting yellow aji sauce for it. \n\nEverything was super delicious and prepared perfectly. This is one of my favorite spots in the city and dosnt require waiting in line or a reservation just walk in for dank food.", "author": "Sean G."}

Both types of ceviche were delicious, fresh, and sooo affordable ($8.50 each).  The lamb platter ($12.99) is probably their best dish and includes a giant braised lamb leg with rice and beans. Everything was delicious and the service is stellar.  The server was sooo attentive and constantly refilled our water and brought things we kept asking for like more hot sauce, which had even had scallions in it. A bit hard to find as it's inside a corridor or lobby of a building, but still felt private. Cholo Soy is so authentic and focused on its unique dishes that it doesn't even serve the more mainstream lomo saltado, which you can get anywhere else. \n\nSuper affordable (costs way less than the equivalent at La Mar, but a different ambiance of course), great service, high quality food.

No problem getting a table.\n\nThe three of us ordered several dishes to share for lunch - \n\n    * ceviche ($7.50) - I can understand why people say this is the best ceviche ever, fresh fish, mild citrus (not too tangy or sour), utterly delicious. I would come back just to get the ceviche for myself.

Sorry honey, but not everyone can afford an $800 Valentino iPad case or have the means to regularly fly to Paris for a $70 lip balm. At least she doesn't give a shit about being the most hated celebrity in hollywood. Props to her for that.\n\nCholo Soy is a place that would get Paltrow's French silk panties all up in a bunch. It's located in lobby of Plaza Adelante; next to Dr. Teeth. The soulful, Peruvian cuisine draws humble working class carb-loving carniwhores. \"Carbs are evil and meat is dirty\", according to her. Whatever Paltrow, go suck on a cucumber. The rotating menu is in Spanish and offers three slow braised meat entrees per a day served with rice and beans. Appetizers of ceviche and causa are available every day. All the dishes are $5, $6, or $10. Menu: http://bit.ly/1cNrb5X and http://bit.ly/18hpT0e. Cash only.\n\nTheir current opening hours are limited because it's based on when the plaza is open. However, the owner told us they plan on extending their hours and open on Sundays in the future once they work something out with the plaza's owner.\n\nThere's only three tables and counter seating available so come during off peak hours if you wanna grub in or you can always take your order to go. We grabbed the last available table a little after 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon. We were also the only non-natives there and I'm sure stuck out like a sore thumb but the welcoming owner didn't make us feel that way. This is one of the reasons WHY I phucking love this place. You know it's legit when all the customers are natives and there's not any hipsters in sight...yet.\n\nThe only thing I could decipher off the menu was the Ceviche ($5): http://bit.ly/IArVld. I'm usually not a fan of ceviche as I find the citrus to overpower the delicateness of the fish but this one was solid especially for the price tag. The fish was firm and the leche de tigre was bold without causing you to pucker your lips. I love the accompanying fried corn kernels for the satisfying crunchy texture contrast. \n\nWe shared two entrees, the Cabrito Norteno de Cordero (lamb shank - $10) and Guisado Norteno de Pollo (chicken - $6) which were both excellent. You can tell they were a labor of love having been stewed for hours. The chicken was fall-of-the-bone tender and filled with savory deliciousness: http://bit.ly/18hqy1w. The fork tender lamb shank was robust with spices: http://bit.ly/1b9aljr. I normally don't care for beans but the accompanying beans had a lovely richness to them. \n\nI washed everything down with a Chica Morado (purple corn drink - $2) which was refreshing and not too sweet: http://bit.ly/18b75ms. \n\nCholo Soy is the epitome of Peruvian homestyle cooking at its finest. You also gotta love that it's very easy on the wallet. Well Mr. NSS did. Our entire meal cost less than one-thirds of Paltrow's lip balm!

The first time I placed my order online for pick up but when I got there I found the place to be a nice and clean little fast food type feel. This is the type of place where both blue and white collar share a table and talk in Spanish about how delicious the food is along with conversation of how beautiful the day is. So, I decided to eat my food there as Cholo Soy had a nice authentic version of the Mission community feel to it. Not that gentrified, hipster feel. They have excellent customer service and although busy, their small staff makes genuine friendly conversation with their patrons. The chef puts his heart into the food as you can see and taste it. I always order two orders of the Amarillo Ceviche and before I even sit down they ask me if I want the usual. I love it!

Finally, a reason to be thankful I moved to SF.\n\nCholo Soy is located on the ground floor of a plaza on Mission St. Its humble existence can easily be missed. There are only a few tables and bar seating. Except for ceviche - the menu changes daily. So if you wanna try everything - you gotta come every day. Pretty smart, eh! \n\nWe came on a Saturday - we had 4 main dishes to choose from. We ordered Guisado Norte\u00f1o de Pollo (chicken) and Adobo de Puerco (pork). Both dishes come with steamed rice and beans. We expected they would be good - but we were wrong. They were EXCELLENT! The flavors of the dishes are just perfect for us. The steamed rice is seasoned well - tastes so much beter than a regular steamed rice. I think it might've been garlic rice. The portions were pretty big for the price - definitely worth every cent we spent there. Oh and if you go there - don't forget to ask for their \"spicy sauce\". But do a small taste test first coz that sauce is spicyyy - it gets spicy when it reaches qyour throat. So good! \n\nNext time we go there - we're gonna try the ceviche.

I ordered the \"ceviche de pescado\" and a \"seco de pato\" I also shared the \"ocopa\" the ceviche I would say is the highlight it really makes you feel like you're back home in Peru. Fish was soft nice and the ledge de Tigre was super good. The seco de pato was 1/4 of a duck it was amazingly good and they served me like a king! (For $10 that's a really good deal)! The ocopa (it was my first time trying it and I don't regret it! It was sweet and spicy better than the \"papa a la huancaina)\nI've gone back a few times to eaters stuff from their menu it's a really great spot! Only downside is I wish they had more tables for people to sit in. It is really growing in popularity among not just peruvian clientele but general clientele! Another plus that this place has is the Peruvian regulars that show up and catch up with one another never forgetting to say hi to other regulars in their awesome Peruvian slang. Expect salsa and Peruvian Cumbia to play in the background that will definitely add to your dining experience,(something other places like \"fresca\", \"limon\" lack in my opinion) This little spot is the closest thing us Peruvians in San Francisco will get to being back home, I love it! I'm glad it opened up! Tell your friends, tell your family, tell everybody! \"Cholo Soy\" is here to stay!!", "author": "Mario F."}

Ceviche was fresh, bright, delicious.  Accompanied by addictive crunchy corn nuts and a dipping sauce made of pure fire, and I like spicy, so be forewarned. The hunk of beef was easily the size of my head.  Well, maybe a small child's head.  Regardless, one massive portion of super tender braised meat, beans that still had some bite, and rice.

The joint was located in a plaza area of what seemed to be a comercial building. Just big enough for a couple tables and some bar seating. Tuesday 12:20 was our time to get down. Special of the day was half duck over Peruvian rice. I don't know what was in the rice but it consisted of some kind of green bean that was light and not to heavy. The duck was just fall off the bone, juicy, flavorful meat that was finger licking good. Not to mention the sauce that smothered the dish and some special hot pepper sauce to kick things up. We also ordered the famous ceviche that was not heavily tart like some and the toasted corn nuts were a nice touch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-09", "description": "Cholo Soy is officially my favorite Peruvian in SF. I was born in Lima Peru and have been to all the Peruvian places in SF at least once and this little place (4 or 5 tables and 5 seats at the counter) inside Plaza Adelante (19th and mission) is so authentic and reminds me most of the flavors of the food of Peru. It's been open a few weeks and I learned that the owner / chef Yeral Caldas is from Chimbote north of Lima. The only sign for this place is a sign on the street .\n\nI first tried the fish ceviche. I always use this as a barometer of the quality of food. My belief is if you can't make great ceviche (Peru's national dish) then Im not going to be expecting much else from the menu. The ceviche here is Swai also known as Iridescent shark or shark catfish. Just to be 100% clear, this is a fish similar to US catfish NOT shark. Its flesh is slightly sweet and has a milder flavor and more delicate texture than US catfish. I like it much more than tilapia which a lot of Peruvian spots use. It was awesome. My favorite ceviche in SF right now. The price is only $5! \nI should mention that this place is super cheap. Coffee for $1.30 and $1.60 and cappuccino for $2.50 just to give you an idea. The most expensive dish is $10. \n\nAfter this place passed (with flying colors) the ceviche test, I tried the Papa Huancaina (slightly warm Yukon Gold potato salad with Huancaina sauce. The main ingredients are; aji amarillo peppers , cheese and saltine crackers. Its a great side dish that has a cheesy taste with a little spice at the end. Price is $5 \n\nI went a few days later to try the Arroz con Pato. (Roast duck with a green cilantro rice)  It was a leg and thigh and had carrots and peas tossed in. Great portion size and it was tender and had a little onion salsa on top. I asked for rocoto sauce (spicy red pepper) to go with it since I'm addicted to spice. I found out that Yeral makes his own sauce and pretty much makes everything himself. Price $10.\n\nThis place is a little authentic spot and I've seen it crowded with mostly Peruvians. It's refreshing to go to a place with no Yelp reviews that seems to be under the radar. Its SO cheap that I eat here a few times a week now. His hours are 7am to 5 pm Monday to Saturday. Cholo Soy reminds me of a Mexican \"fonda\" A small place were workers and people go to get a quick casual bite. In peru they are called huariques. Its authentic style dishes, no fusion going on here.\n\nIn addition to the 3 dishes I tried he offers Arroz con Pollo ($6) or Duck($10) and tamales ($5) and Ocopa ($5, similar to Huancaina with huacatay mint sauce and nuts) \n\nSpecials are daily\nMonday - Chicken or duck Ceviche (cooked dish) ($6, $10)\nTuesday - Arroz con Pollo or duck ($6 , $10)\nWednesday - Fish Escabeche with lentils ($6)\nThursday - Aji de gallina ($6) ( chicken stew with cheese and nut sauce)\nFriday - Seco de Cordero or chicken- Lambor chicken stew ($10 , $6)\nSaturday - Cabrito de Cordero ($10)\nHe has Inca Cola and Chicha morada and sodas to drink for $1 a can\n\nThis guy is off to a great start and I hope the kids in the mission looking for a break from tacos and pizza will give it a try.", "author": "Jose K."}

Their ceviche is closer to Mexican ceviche in MX, which is lime juice only or added with yellow pepper for spiciness. The best ceviche juice is still from LIMON on South Van Ness (my opinion).
