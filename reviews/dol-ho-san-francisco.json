It's a no frills, no nothing kinda establishment. But what attention isn't spent on the decor or customer service is spent on the taste of the food. It's one of those places even I don't like to sit and eat at but will buy their spare ribs just so we can eat it at home. They sell them frozen in Ziploc baggies too for you to steam up at home. No where else can you get this delicious flavor. \n\nNow I saw a review here on how there's no line or attentive service. Well that's the way it is man.  Have you not been to any of the most popular bakeries here like Napoleon/Na Po Lun \u62ff\u7834\u4ed1? That's how we do it here in Chinatown. Now get yourself a back bone and get yourself some food.

As soon as we sat down, we noticed the table had black grime all over it. The auntie came to wipe it down a bit, but I wiped a second time with a napkin and it was disgustingly black. All the tables looked to be in similar conditions. Overall, I would not come back based on the sanitation alone - if the hall is this dirty, I don't want to imagine what the kitchen looks like.\n\nPros - relatively cheap (~$26 with tax to feed two hungry and hungover people and still have some leftovers), Siu Mai had a very strong and delicious pork flavor, Ha gao was tasty, and the chicken feet was good as well. The chicken in the lotus wrapped rice was a bit salty for my taste but the dishes here were a bit aggressive overall (neither good or bad).\n\nCons - sanitation was a huge no no. Definitely not coming back based on this alone.", "author": "Jaesung J."}

I came to visit Chinatown with my family, and we expected there to be good Chinese restaurants for dim sum. I looked on Yelp and this was one of the few restaurants with a good rating, so we decided to come. We didn't want to fight crowds so we came for a later lunch, around 1pm.\n\nWe were immediately seated at a table directly at the entrance, where it was very windy because the door was kept open. We ordered several items quickly because we were hungry. I couldn't believe they actually served COLD dim sum to us. Not even warm at all. Including baked BBQ pork pastry (\u53c9\u70e7\u9165)! It was so bad we couldn't eat it. It might've tasted good if it was hot. A few other dishes were also cold but I don't remember which ones. The only one that was hot was \u7eb8\u5305\u9e21, which was wrapped in foil.\n\nOverall, we were disappointed by SF's Chinatown and especially by this restaurant.

Firstly, they accept cash only, so come prepared. Secondly, I noticed that I was the only non-Chinese person in the small cafeteria-like space, and it seemed like most of the patrons were elderly folk. Finally when I requested a seat for myself, the lady working the counter quickly looked around; and at the first sight of someone barely ready to go, she quickly tried to shoo them out the door. I took these all as signs that I found what I was looking for haha. \n\nApparently here they try and fit you wherever is open, so I was seated at a table with 5 other people. I've been to a couple dim sum places in Atlanta where the carts weave between tables and you pick what you want. I'm honestly still not sure how their syterm works here. I saw a cart come out with some food, and people swarmed it and pointed and picked what they wanted. Afterwards I was given a menu. \n\nLuckily another cart came came out with the pork and shrimp dumplings I wanted. I asked if she had shrimp toast. She didn't, but eventually she came out later just to bring me one. So I guess you can put in orders with any of the workers there. \n\nAs for the food, I got the dumplings, shrimp toast, and a bowl of white rice. The dumplings were fantastic. The shrimp toast was pretty good, but not really crunchy/toasty how I like it. Rice was a little overdone. I would give this place 4.5 stars of I could. Truly an authentic experience with mostly delicious food. \n\nAlso I wanted to take pictures of my shrimp toast, but after I took a picture of my dumplings, I could feel one of the grandma's across from me judge me (trust me, I know that look!)

Yes, it comes piping hot! Definitely enough for 2 people too. Next came the sui mai and the chicken feet. Soooo good of chicken feet. Definitely hella succulent and fall off the bone, melt in your mouth tender. Loved the flavors. The pork sui mai was okay--it reminded me of stinky pork, so that was kind of a turn off. But it had a decent taste to it. It definitely wasn't my favorite. The fried stuffed taro though... that was amazing! I loved how the filling had curry flavors in it and the taro itself was crunchy and had amazing textures. I loved this one the most!! Did not get to try the beef balls, but everyone was ordering that and the shrimp noodles.\n\nThey greet you, give you a menu, and you sit where you can fit! Food comes in different rushes, but they always remember your order. The chili oil is good (nothing different than other restaurants, in my opinion), so eat it with that.

Place seats about 30 people. \n\nService is definitely lacking - workers barely made eye contact with us. We semi sat ourselves - this nice old lady customer told us to come take her table as she was getting ready to leave. We lingered there wondering if it was ok to take the table and we just sat down since no one really acknowledged us. \n\nOrdering also took a long time - again, the lone cart lady barely made her way to us and it was hard to flag anyone down as eye contact was avoided. Once we did get help, had no idea what the lady was saying. I still don't know if we are supposed to order from the menu or take what we could from the cart. \n\nOnce we finally got food.... Portion size was great. Quality ranges from so-so to decent. Some dishes were room temperature which I didn't fancy too much.

So we went in on a Monday at around 10 in the morning and we to one of the last tables. Looking around, there were quite a few older Chinese people, so we assumed the food would be good and not a tourist trap. Sadly, we were mistaken. Everything we tried (shrimp churng fun, shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, shumai) were all just mediocre. The only thing that I actually liked was the meatballs. Their chili oil definitely made everything else better tasting so I ended up smothering everything in that.\n\nService is pretty much what you would expect at a Chinese restaurant. Only, it does take a while to get your food, unlike the cart-pushing places in NYC. They don't have carts of dim sum here.

The OGs aka the old grandparents that come here often actually just get up and make their own tea and servers have memorized what their regulars order. \n\nFor the two of us, we would usually only spend under $20 on dim sum here, which is a steal, considering that we've racked up $100 tabs elsewhere. My absolute go to is the spareribs rice, it's freaken amazing! They have the most flavorful spareribs I've ever had and they've mastered the rice and soy sauce.

Luckily, Dol Ho was open till 3pm! \n\nThis is one of those hole-in-the-wall's you hear of that lacks cleanliness but has excellent food. Every one is a local, they walk in, grab their own dishware and tea and find their own seating. So if you're coming in, better grab seating before someone else does! \n\nWhat made this experience so fun was the ordering process. You can order specific dishes but most of the time, whatever they decide to make in the back, they bring out on the wheel cart. You take it or you don't. It's kind of a chef's choice style, it's a little slow but makes it an adventure! Otherwise, you can order what you want from the one lady server. \n\nWhat we ordered and liked:\nSiu mai - so meaty! \nHa gow - wrapping is so fresh\nHa gow with shrimp and chives - must get\nShrimp ball with fried tofu\nSpare ribs over rice - fell right off the bone\n\nWe also ordered steamed buns to go, which weren't bad and were quite cheap! Our tab was less than 30$ for 3 people. This was a cool experience to get away from touristy restaurants and get to eat with the locals. They speak canto, mandarin and some English.

The language barrier was an issue, but between my sixth grade level Mandarin and my boyfriend's third grade level Cantonese, we managed to order a few of our dim sum favorites. \n\nAs mentioned above, definitely get the spare rib over rice. They are generous with the spare ribs and the sauce that seeps onto the white rice is fantastic. The daikon cakes are also delicious!", "author": "Swan L."}

This is the best place in chinatown, if not all of San Francisco. For the unfamiliar, you share tables with strangers, similar to cafeteria style. I personally prefer the spareribs over rib. It has a very good balance in the fermented beans with the seasoning. The rice itself is special.  This place is one of the few places left where they steam their rice compare to just boiling it. This creates a delightful texture in the rice where its fluffy but also not mushy. \nAnother must try item is the beef balls. They are so tender but also bounce, which is a must for beef balls. Not too much fillers mean you get your worth of beef. As with the spareribs, they are perfectly seasoned. If beef is not your thing. The deep fried shrimp balls are a good substitute. \n\nOverall. If you want good cheap cantonese dim sum dol ho is great choice with an experience that anyone's grandparents will call legit", "author": "jed x."}

By \"humble\", I mean the old tea-house type of dim sum where you have chopsticks in a canister in the center of the table and the prices are low while the conversations loud as opposed to the Yank Sing variant of dim sum which includes white table clothes and is fit for a business lunch. It's mainly frequented by the local elderly Chinese which is great because if anyone knows good dim sum and a whale of a deal, they sure do. It is also very useful to have some working knowledge of Cantonese to communicate here--you ask the waiter pushing the cart around for what you want or else point to what's on the cart, but it's very useful to be able to ask. The service is brisk and can seem a tad bit rude at times, but this is not uncommon for this type of restaurant.\n\nThe stand-out dishes tend to be the fun guo, har gow, shaomai, and steamed ribs. The turnip cake normally is ok, too. Like many dim sum shops, if something was made earlier in the day it may be cold or rubbery or lumpy. It's not possible with so small a kitchen and the way they operate to keep everything piping hot and seemingly fresh like Yank Sing can do, however never have I ever had anything I suspected was spoiled here, either. I agree with other reviewers the place could be cleaner, but it doesn't seem unsanitary and again, the prices are so low you feel in some sense you're getting what you pay for--the food portions are quite generous, so if the place could use some cleaning and even redecorating maybe, so what?\n\nI would certainly recommend Dol Ho for 1) good and authentic dim sum at very fair prices and 2) a glimpse of how Chinatown remains today--not fully touristy but very much an immigrant enclave.", "author": "Mike W."}

The service is completely lacking but you really can't beat the cheap price for this delicious food. It came out to just $7 each person including tax and tip! Reminder that it is cash only. I recommend coming here in a small group. It took us half an hour to snag a table for 4 at a peak hour but there were plenty of seats for 2 people that share a table with another group.\n\nThe service was so inattentive of us it was almost entertaining to try to handle everything ourselves. The server doesn't help you get a seat so it's a free for all hovering over the tables that look like they're about to finish their meal. When we finally got a table we had been sitting without a server come to us for so long my friend went into the kitchen to grab plates and chopsticks for us and I walked up to the only cart across the room and picked out my dim sum.\n\nHighly recommend the spareribs over rice. It lives up to the hype. Super cheap for the serving size and is so tender. The other classic dim sum items like shumai, shrimp dumplings, and shrimp rice noodle rolls were all great. You should order off the menu if there's something you really want because there's only one cart that comes around at a time and it might not bring what you are hoping for.", "author": "Linda X."}

He didn't speak English either, but he kept smiling, and holding my hand and showing me how to hold it, and how to control different items.

It was extremely crowded on a Saturday morning and the food was piping hot and delicious. Service was great and it was very cheap. \n\nMy second time there, however, was a different experience. Despite visiting again on a Saturday afternoon, the restaurant was kind of empty. That should have been our red flag from the start. The lady at the front manning the cash register asked what tea we wanted, and my mother asked to give us a second to decide. When we flagged down that lady a few minutes later, she exclaimed \"You weren't ready when I asked, and now I'm busy and you want your tea?\" Damn, rude. \n\nYou'd think that a well-known place that lacks in customer service would make up for it in quality of food, but that day's selection was quite meh compared to last time. Some of the dumplings were cold. The shrimp rice rolls were lukewarm and kind of pasty. \n\nThis place doesn't function quite like a normal dim sum place. You need to constantly ask the server what you want because the place is so small, the cart won't physically get to your table. Where you get your food depends on what type of dish you want. The Wu Gok (taro balls) or Cha Siu Bao (BBQ pork buns) are actually pulled from the front counter where they are continually made for to-go orders. Fresh steamed dumplings come from the carts, if the cart is carrying what you're looking for at that moment. Random things are, I think, made fresh from the kitchen. \n\nThis place was fairly cheap considering the quality and service. Before the new year, it was around $20 for 6 dishes. Apparently they raised their prices after the new year, so the second time around, it was $24 for around 7 dishes. \n\nNot sure if I'd come back for a third round.

Smaller groups (3-4) will almost always win out over large ones and pairs are the ace in the hole. If you need to just find random spots at a table and sit and wait til people finish eating or wait by a table for the same reason. No one's gonna shoo you away for being annoying, this is all communal so release your fears of sitting next to someone you don't know. The staff will figure out they're gone, clear it out and give you utensils and a pot of tea. Carts will come around, yes it helps immensely if you speak Cantonese but you can honestly get by pretty easily if you just wave down the cart as it comes by and point at random things for her to open and show you. Eat well, the food is GREAT. Once you're done, take your bill to the front cashier to be rung up and head on out. Prices are decent but obviously if you order a lot, your bill will be high, but no more than $30-$40 on the very high end (for 2 at least). Even if you do somehow, I think you'll reconcile that with how happy your stomach is.\n\nRecommend getting the spare ribs + rice, shrimp balls, rice noodles. (Siu mai, har gow implied as everyone orders them)\n\nAnd so I dislike most uses of the word authentic. I feel that authenticity is incredibly relative to each person's experience and that while it can help when properly framed, a lot of people put too much emphasis on it. Regardless, I grew up frequenting the old school classic dim sum restaurants of Old LA Chinatown and 626 (San Gabriel). Take that as you will, I've had a lot of dim sum in my life and to my point, while I can say that this has been the most difficult place to ever order in, that doesn't take away from it at all and it's somewhere I plan on going back to 150%.\n\nAlso as a final note, I'm always a bit confused when I see long lists of dissent against lackluster service and atmosphere at Chinese restaurants. The onus is always on the food and especially so here as it's meant to be a fast joint for locals. Don't hate it for that, respect the fact that it's a place that remains true to the community through the years and celebrate that you are able to be a part of that history.", "author": "Charles M."}

Also, I'm fluent in Chinese and know my Chinese food.\n\nWith that being said, this place is gross.  It would normally only get 1 star from me but because of the reasons mentioned above, I'll give it a benefit of the doubt. It's cheap enough, regular dishes are $2.50 and large/special dishes are $3.50. \n\nOut of 7 dishes, 6 were reheated and I suspect more than one. The protein had been cooked to the point where the texture and wrapping around it had changed. This means one thing to me - it was left overs for the day. Now out of the 6 reheated dishes, only about half as actually warm.\n\nMy only complaint is this - either stop serving early or do it well regardless. If I was the owner, I would be  ashamed to serve this food of this quality. My friend and I were hungry and desperate so we ate most if it. However, I will not be returning in the future with so many other options down the street.\n\nThe restaurant itself was your typical dingy Chinese place. Somewhat sticky and uneven tables.

This place is frequented mainly by Chinatown locals and regulars, most of whom are old and ain't got time for any nonsense. You will hear Chinese spoken throughout the room. Once you order, you will get a pot of hot tea which will be your best friend as you slurp down delicious dim sum dumplings and buns.\n\nMost menu items are well prepared, delicious and very simply flavored -- nothing over complicated, experimental, frou frou, or designer farm-to-table here. A few faves: the deep fried shrimp balls, steamed pork buns (very abundant with tasty, flavorful filling), shrimp and chive dumplings, chicken nests (a chunk of chicken wrapped in a nest of clear cellophane noodles). We're talking solid, old school, traditional dim sum. And if frugality is an Olympic sport for you, you will be scoring gold medals here. It just doesn't get any cheaper than this for really solid dim sum.

I'm all for changing the motto.  First thing--we scour and spy on neighboring tables to see what's thee dish to get- turns out it tin can with spareribs over rice.  Well then we have to get that.  Such a simple dish and it was satiating.  it has the perfect balance of flavor with tender ribs.  Since we sat right by the kitchen opening I got to ooooo and aaahhh at the dishes being made.  The one dish constantly churning out were the ribs over rice.   Most of the dim sum dishes are requested since there is one cart lady catering to all the tables.

However, service was friendly and we did not feel rushed.\n\nThey were quick to give us tea, and our chopsticks and plates, so we were ready to go. There was only one woman with a cart, but she was regularly coming out with fresh new items. You can easily see into the open kitchen, so you can see them preparing all the new dishes to bring out. \n\nEven though the two us ordered at least two more dishes after we were already stuffed (and took home our leftovers: 2 large fried shrimp dumplings, 2 turnips cakes, and 2 pieces of beef crepe), we left so stuffed and it all cost less than $20 total.

It wasn't the cleanest (I saw an elderly woman spit on the floor and keep on eating), but I wouldn't say it was out of place if that makes sense.  Pork buns were good, so were chives.  Many people on Yelp raved about the ribs but I think I ordered the wrong thing, as it was mostly bone and not very good.

My bf was the only white boy in there the whole time.  The place is dive-y with not much of a decor, faded awning outside and super busy inside.  Not the cleanest walls and windows.  \n\nI speak Mandarin and I even had a little trouble ordering.  The lady that pushed the cart around didn't speak Mandarin nor English... and I made the assumption that she didn't speak Spanish either, I pulled out my best point-and-nod skills.\n\nNot really a fan of their har-gao (shrimp dumpling), the dough was really thick and I've had better in Denver.  The foil wrapped Chicken was awesome!  Saw a lady walked in for a take-out order and she got 3 orders (3 pieces per order) of those foil chickens.  I think it's the top segment of the chicken leg, wrapped and cooked in foil.  It's got awesome flavor throughout the whole chicken and super tasty!  I'm so glad I got it even though she couldn't tell me what was inside.  \n\nHad pork spareribs, their most famous dish.  Most of the older Chinese crowd gets it over rice, we just got it standalone and it was delicious!  A little fattier than what I'm used to, it has great flavor with the black beans.  Also ordered the beef meatballs and they were delicious as well with chopped up water chestnuts inside.  Fried stuffed tofu triangles were delicious as well, just wish they were hot when we got them.  \n\nLove their homemade chili sauce, not very spicy but it's different than anywhere else I've ever been to.  They used dried daikon (white radish), black bean and chili flake to make it.. not sure if there's a little garlic in it too.  Yummy!\n\nFor all 5 dishes with oolong tea came out to $16 after tax.  I don't think the waitress there gets tipped because when I handed her $2 she quickly grabbed it, smile and nod at me, and shoved the money in her apron as if that was the first tip she's got all day or that she didn't want others to see.  I know older Chinese people don't usually tip and that's the majority of the customers there.  \n\nI would recommend if you tip, give it to the person that took care of you directly and not just leave it up at the front counter when you pay.  The lady behind the counter is not the nicest person and people have a tendency to cut in front of you.  If you give the tip to the lady upfront she will take it and not sure if she even distributes it to other workers.  Waiting in line is not really the best qualities of Chinese people and it shows at this restaurant.  \n\nOverall, knowing what I was getting myself into, this place is awesome.  Been here 4 years ago when visited San Francisco and now coming back again for more.  And if you don't want people sharing tables with you, this might not be the place to try.  However, this is the cheapest and the best dim sum in the area with the best prices!", "author": "Sara C."}

Located in the heart of Chinatown, DH follows the old-style dim sum tea houses, minus the birds in cages and spit buckets, but keep the 70+ year olds and brusque service.\n\nSeeing that it was a large group of 20s and 30s somethings, our hostess* asked the 2 older gentlemen (who reminded me of my grandpas - RIP) in the only large table to move to a smaller table. We felt bad and absolutely didn't mind sharing the table, but the gentle and kind grandpas assured us in Toisan that they were more than happy to move. Naturally, we helped them with their plates. \n\nThe service is an acquired taste. If you're not used to the abrasiveness that older Chinese restaurants offers, you'll definitely be turned off. But hey, my friends and I grew up in the mean streets of Flushing and Chinatown in NYC. If we can't appreciate this, we might as well swear off Chinese food forever. \n\nFood is great! It's only 1 cart with 1 lady pushing the cart, so they try to fit as much as they can on it. And you never know what they come out with, but feel free to put in orders! Reading Yelp, we did see that the marinated meats over rice were the must-gets. So we tried the spare ribs over rice, chicken over rice, and pork patty with preserved fish over rice. All three gets the thumbs up. So good that we each ordered the spare ribs & chicken versions to go for our flight home. Would've gone with the pork patty w/ preserved fish as well, but not everyone appreciates the aroma and goodness of this dish.\n\nIf you're in SF, please go! Set your judgments aside and enjoy the old-style charm and the food! \n\n\n*Hostess is used very loosely here. You pretty much have to fight for survival once you're seated.", "author": "Lily C."}

Which is exactly what we did.\n\nRoaming around the streets trying to find a dim sum place for Sunday lunch, we crammed ourselves in with other locals (and tourists!). Dried goods line almost every grocery store, fresh produce just right beside, and the smell of BBQ pork everywhere!\n\nWe ended up finding Dol Ho, a small dim sum restaurant that offered to go items. Definitely a hole in the wall place, with minimal seating but packed to the brim with locals aside from one group of confused tourists seated communally with a group of seniors. As we entered, we increased the tourist count, and likewise, were seated with a couple of elderly ladies, happily chatting away and eating a bowl of rice and spare ribs.\n\nWhen we were seated, we quickly became confused as well. Items coming in from the back kitchen were lost in translation as none of the servers could speak English! Although we're both Asian and had a rough idea of what we wanted to eat, we had to go with the tried and true method of \"look, point, and eat.\" Time to experiment! Our first dish: a shrimp batter nested inside sliced eggplants. Normally not a fan of eggplant, this dish was actually well done. The shrimp batter was nice and light and the eggplant added quite a bit of substance to the dish. It surprisingly held its shape during the preparation and wasn't mushy at all, contrary to a lot of eggplant dishes that I had tried.\n\nOur usual dishes started to roll out at this point: dumplings! The traditional pork siu mai dumpling, along with variations of shrimp and vegetable dumplings. Delicious! The couple sharing our table smiled at our selections and nudged the soy sauce and chili condiments towards us. Not that it required any of it, as they were all well seasoned.\n\nBy the time we finished our dumplings, we were in a bit of a lull. Not knowing what else to order from the carts and definitely craving to try something other than dumplings, we waited. When a different cart pulled up, our chatting tablemates pointed to a steamed rice and pork dish that they previously shared. Taking the cue, we nodded and tried it out. Pretty good! And although I had no idea what the pricing was on any of these dishes, I imagined this was the cheapest because it was not a seafood dish. Bang for your buck? Knowing the elderly Asian population, that's probably why they urged us to try it. It filled the rest of our bellies up and we called it a day!\n\nMy thoughts? Although not your tourist trap, and trust me, we saw them along the streets, Don Ho ended up being pretty decent dim sum. It's nothing particularly special, just some home-style cooked food, freshly steamed dumplings, and a chance to try new dishes at the suggestion of your new San Francisco friends. The price? For the two of us, it ended up being a tad less than $20. Bonus! No wonder the two women shared a rice bowl and left smiling!\n\nWashing down our dim sum eats, which can be a heavier lunch than most, I opted for some guava bubble tea down the street. A nice relaxing day! Highly suggested if you've finished your tour of the Wharf and the piers and want to check out what else San Francisco has to offer.", "author": "Cindy N."}

This place serves comfort food more than anything else (although I only tried spareribs over rice and steamed salted fish & pork paste over rice). I think anything over rice is basically comfort food lol. I wonder how I've never been to this place; it's so good! We ordered 2 (orders of) fung zao [chicken feet], 2 siu mai, 2 nu mai gai [sweet rice with chicken] (jumbo size!), 2 ha gao, 2 chiang foon [rolled rice noodle], 2 pai goo't fan [spareribs over rice], and 1 ham ngui ji fan [salted fish & pork paste over rice]. Probably the best 'Mom n Pops' place I've ever been to. \n\nI came here with my grandma and 3 of my aunts so they did all the ordering for us. They also didn't give a menu (probably assuming we know what we can order, which is correct) but I basically memorized all the basic dim sum items I really like. The staff was really helpful when I spilled my whole cup of tea on the table which was embarrassing to say the least. I'd say you can't go wrong with any dishes they serve because it got the rural mainland China taste. Kind of hard to come by outside of China.\n\n*They serve their stuff (dim sum included) in metal so don't be too surprised if it's really hot. The plates and tea cups are ceramic. They also have soy sauce and the spicy mix that's served in most Asian restaurants, which is the bomb diggity even though it looks weird. I saw in one of the reviews for this restaurant that the customer was complaining that the spareribs have tiny bones.

The older folks would sit around reading the morning paper while some catch up with their friends in between their market time. Many people stream in and out of the caf\u00e9 to buy take-away breakfast.\n\nWe sat by a table near the entrance and watched the on going action in the caf\u00e9 while enjoying our dim sum and tea. \n\nThe one word I can describe the dim sum in this caf\u00e9 is 'down-to-earth'. No frills, a hole-in-the-wall place where you rub elbows with the locals. As we sat down the hostess promptly delivered a hot pot of Chinese tea and the freshly prepared dim sum varieties on a cart. \n\nThe dumpling was steaming hot as I bite into it. I can taste the freshness of the meat and shrimp, no MSG and somehow the texture was not oily like most dim sum does. Not that I mind if the dim sum is oily since I love eating fat. But I guess that's what most people would like. It was delicious!\n\nWe enjoy eating the 3 different types of steamed dumplings and decided to try a bake item. I picked the BBQ pork pastry puff. When the plate landed on our table, my first impression was the puff was too big. I begin to imagine the texture to be thick and firm with very little BBQ pork fillings in it.\n\nAs I break open one into half with a pair of chopsticks, the whole puff fell apart easily. The pastry was thin and soft, and filled with plenty of BBQ pork cube fillings. I took a bite. The BBQ pork was not too sweet and the pastry just melts in the mouth.\n\nIt was one of the best tasting BBQ pork puff I ever had.

This place is absolutely ridiculously CHEAP!  One of the cheapest places I've ever had dim sum at (I've gone all my life as I'm asian).  There were three of us and we ordered 8 dishes - total was $24 after tip. Ridiculous. Oh how I wish I lived in San Francisco.\n\nAnyways, as people have previously said, the place is hole in the wall but it's not really dirty. It's essentially your typical asian restaurant - very bare and minimal.  We came here on a weekday around 1pm so we probably missed the lunch rush but there were still lots of old asian grandma's/grandpa's.  Looks like they constantly come here all the time.  We did see one caucasian couple and the person in the front was nice enough to help them order (think she may be the only one that speaks english).\n\nFor the food, we ordered regular dishes that we normally get when we go for dim sum (har gow, siu mai are staples). There was 4 of them per dish which was nice! We also tried the har cheung fun (shrimp rice noodle rolls), their famous pai gwut fan (rice with spare ribs), shrimp fried balls and the wu gock (taro dumplings/balls), the last two dishes came in 3's and were enormous.  We also tried two other dishes, not sure of their names but they were steamed dumplings with shrimp and pork.  The only bad dish we had was the wu gock as it was cold.  Food is a bit on the salty side but that's what hot tea is for! Haha, the best was my dad went into the back to re-fill our tea. We'd fit in perfectly with the locals!\n\nParking is INSANE.  One thing I would definitely recommend for tourists is to park at the Portsmouth Square (it's underground parking for $3/hr which is reasonable). The address is: 733 Kearny Street, write it down and put it in the GPS.  Trust me on this, you'll save lots of time and headaches of trying to look for street parking which is ridiculous with the hills and constant people crossing the street.  If you do street parking, there is the ones with yellow parking meters (only for 30 minutes max) vs. black meters (1 hour parking max) although maybe you'll get lucky and find 2 hours?\n\nAnyways, I know there are lots of places to get dim sum in San Francisco but if you want something cheap and good, this is a good bet.

The quality is decent for the price you pay. It is no upscale restaurant, more run down than anything. We came here knowing what to expect after reading the reviews so we were just anticipating some decent dim sum and we got that. The service was quick. The server doesn't know much English. There is no menu given unless you ask for it and I think its just their items on an 8x11 piece of paper with no price. They reuse this piece of paper fairly often too. Every time our order came out, instead of marking the item on the sheet, she would just pull out another used sheet which had the designated amount of dishes that came out. It was hilarious.

In between Pacific and Stockton street there is Dol Ho!  In front you can barely see the inside because of the large tray's that are steaming to keep the buns warm.\n\nThis place is full of senior citizens and old folks from around and far.  Mostly just having Dim sum and enjoying tea.  In translation of Dim Sum to Chinese, it refers to drink tea.  Majority of the folks here are reading the newspaper and  having small bites of their food.\n\nUsually one or two people run a cart of food.  The first cart usually is a variety of Dim Sum.  Har Gow, Shu Mai, Fung jao etc.. From shrimp to park dumplings to the delicate of chicken feet.  A lot to choose from and cheap.  Then another cart rolls out with these stainless steel pots full of goodies.  Spare rib over rice or pork cake over rice.  This is the entree of this place, famous for their spare rib over rice.\n\nA small stainless tall bowl will surprisingly fill you up easy.  At $2.75 a pop is fair game and enough to fill you up.  Majority of the time its a self service place here.  All the folks who finish their hot water in their tea pot will go self service to refill hot water because the people working here are busy.  Right, i know bad customer service? It's a tradition and the people who enjoy coming here don't mind and just want to get more water and enjoy more tea and eat.\n\nOverall this is a family run business, over decades literally.  Still the same good stuff and hope this place will stay open forever.  Everyone always order the spare rib over rice.  People order more than one order of this goodie.  They also sell raw spare ribs marinade and ready to steam at home.  They sell it by the zip lock bag.  \n\nThis place is a hole in a wall and great.  This place have so many regulars that if there is a chair open and table half empty someone will sit across or next to you so they can enjoy their food and not have to wait.\n\n**parking**\n\nThis will be tough, best bet park far or park in the parking structure at Portsmouth square or Vallejo street garage.\n\nCASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLYCASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH", "author": "Kenneth Y."}

With a kind of run-down feeling, it can definitely be a little intimidating, especially if you're a first-timer or not familiar with Cantonese. The tables filled with old pau paus and gung gungs (Chinese grandmas and grandpas) should give you an indication of the typical clientele. \n\nOnce you're seated (and be warned, you may be seated with strangers if you have a small party or are by yourself), most usuals get up and grab tea from the back room, as service is minimal here. Pushcarts with ha gao and siu mai come around periodically but when the pai gwut fan, or pork spareribs over rice, comes out, the usuals will run up to the server and take a couple of the silver bowls of goodness. You better be on your toes if you want a chance of eating it cause it seriously goes fast. \n\nStop by Dol Ho for an authentic cheap meal. Bring a Cantonese translator if at all possible.  \n\n\nP.S.

If you want white tablecloth, go to Yank Sing, though you WILL spend 5-6 times as much as at Dol Ho. 3 people can eat very well here for less than $20\n\nIt is VERY popular for lunch. You basically need to seat yourself next to anyone who has a spare seat at the table. The locals/regulars will actually go into the kitchen for their own tea. There are two teas: black and jasmine. The waitstaff (don't speak English, of course) will generally give you jasmine unless you know enough Cantonese...\n\nThey do have a \"menu\" but I suspect it's actually from a different dim sum joint, as I don't think they have half the stuff on it, and the best stuff they have is not on it.\n\nWhat to order: pork spare-ribs over rice (all the locals eat this), or beef or chicken if you don't want to deal with the bones.  It's the only place I know of in the city to get dried shrimp rice crepe (Xia Mi Chow Fun), though this is not on the menu and difficult to get if you're not a regular or don't speak cantonese. The steamed beef balls are awesome - light and fluffy. The shrimp dumplings and the shrimp & veg dumplings are great - nice thin wrappers. The fried taro cakes are good IF hot, but in general the fried foods are to be avoided if they're not right out of the fryer (they tend to push them around all day...)\n\nFinish up with their steamed custard buns. If you want custard cups or baked goods, you're out of luck. Go right around the corner to Wah Li bakery for their custard cups.\n\nThey close for one month of the year to go to China. It's so popular that they are absolutely packed the day they get back!", "author": "Aaron N."}

These reviews are very accurate.  Before I go into my experience with Dol Ho, let me date myself a bit.\n\nWhen I was a kid, this was the location of Tung Fong. TF was a part of the weekend Chinatown dim sum circuit that included Hong Kong Tea House across the street on Pacific (now another restaurant) and Canton Restaurant on Stockton (now a grocery store, RIP).  Tung Fong had the most amazing foil wrapped chicken, and it was my absolute favorite dish. The closest current reproduction I could find to TF's foil wrapped chicken is the overpriced one offered at Yank Sing.  That is, until today.\n\nDol Ho is definitely not the same restaurant, and no trace of Tung Fong exists other than the take out dim sum counter to the left of the entrance. The interior is very basic, even canteen-like.\n\nSpare ribs with rice, foil wrapped chicken, steamed beef meatballs, and a pot of tea was $8.70, not including tip. The spare ribs with rice was good and the foil wrapped chicken took me back to my childhood.  I wouldn't order the beef again.", "author": "Eating Sleeping T."}

In fact, I afectionately refer to this place as \"Old People Dim Sum\" due to all the old Cantonese folks that frequent this joint.  And while I've moved on to better dim-sum pastures, I come back here every now and then for the atmosphere and simple tasty selections at decent prices. \n\nA word of caution.  Despite the large senior crowd, this place is only for the brave.  Meaning, you must be comfortable being stared at if you are not Chinese, and not much English is spoken.  Luckily staring does not bother me, and my child-like Mandarin gets me by.  This place is not for tourists and Caucasians, or anyone else expecting to be pampered.  Learn Chinese and the culture. Don't bring your expectations here.  Just enjoy the food.\n\nTheir limited selection means that they make a few things pretty good, including the ha gao, fried taro, and pai gu (pork ribs).

I didnt check what new asia got for reviews on yelp yet, but i took a look at the carts going around and it looked like a bad dim sum restaurant over in the OC called Kim Su.\n\nThe seating was pretty ridiculous.. we were waiting to get seated but no one came, so we decided to talk to the person and we were seated with a complete stranger who was reading a newspaper.  There seemed to be one of these guys at every table in the restaurant.  \n\nThere were no carts around for about 5 minutes or so then one rolled out with all the dumpling stuffs.  The shui mai was pretty good and the ha cao was really good (Both the shrimp and the vegetable one).  Patty didnt enjoy the chicken feet that much.\n\nAfter we finished all the dumplings, we waited another 10 minutes or so till the next cart rolled out, this time with all the fried stuffs.  The sesame ball with yellow bean was really good.. it had a nice thickness to it and the bean curd inside wasn't overly sweet and was very smooth.  We also got the fried shrimp ball and the egg rolls.  The egg rolls smelt weird... not something you would normally smell with regular egg rolls.  They tasted alright though.  The shrimp ball was good.  I liked how they made it look kind of like a fireball.  After we finished those dishes, we asked the waiter for the shrimp in rice noodle rolls (I dont know what its called in canto, just viet haha).  The noodles were thick and killed the texture of the dish itself.  We were pretty satisfied in terms of how full we were, but i really wanted a cha shiu bao, but i didnt want to wait for one.\n\nWe spent $30 for the whole meal, which isnt bad for 5 people (3 being heavy eaters including me and patty).  It seemed like there were 4 dim sum places at every block in chinatown haha, so i probably wont come back here again.  At least we were joking around with the old guy reading the newspaper.", "author": "Patty L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-24", "description": "Decent. As a visitor to SF where everyone raves about the dim sum, I was expecting more. But, this place does have the old hong kong feel as far as being somewhat dingy, not so well lit, and the perfect place to grab a seat, have a few tins of dumplings, and read the morning paper. These aren't dainty dimsum bites as many of the dumplings are pretty hefty and it's tough to come and eat as a party of 1 or 2 and get to try everything you want (because you'll be full). Most of the filling used in various dishes was very meaty which, just as the hefty portions, can be both a good and a bad thing with dimsum. At the end of the day, I've had better and nothing was particularly memorable.", "author": "Manesh P."}

However, the space is really small (and not the cleanest place), so if there's a large crowd, you may have to wait.  But the wait is well worth it.\n\nIt is WAY cheaper than Gold Mountain or New Asia and the food is definitely fresh, made right out from the kitchen.  The ambiance (or lack thereof) definitely plays a big part in making you appreciate the food.  The service isn't that great, but it's authentic Chinatown dim sum; none of that touristy stuff should be found here so ignore the glass cases at the register and sit your butt down for lunch.\n\nDol Ho is the spot that the locals know, visit, and most importantly, EAT at, but recently, more touristy folks have been coming to try the \"pai gwut fan\" and the dim sum, so get there a little earlier if you want seats!", "author": "Connie Z."}

It needs negative stars.\n\nTheir offerings made my gf have a sad, betrayed face as she stared at the 8 inedible (purportedly) dim sum dishes in front of her.  \n\nI've always liked dim sum (though mostly in boston chinatown) and my gf grew up on it.  Neither of us have run across something like this before.\n\nAs one example: the initially normal sized chicken feet were inflated to godzilla proportions with rancid grease and then allowed to become tepid before being placed in front of us, where they lurked malevolently for the 4 minutes it took for us to summon up the breach of ettiquette to leave the resturant despite doing little besides push the food around and stare silently at each other (and getting stared at silently by the whole resturant while doing so).\n\nGoing here was a huge mistake.

It is cheap alright, but you get what you pay for.  We were seated next to the loudest guy ever, screaming in chinese to this other table about how to cook some type of chicken stew.  He literally gave me a migraine.  It was almost 90 degrees outside, but this place is so cheap that they didn't even turn on the stained and dusty revolving fans that they had on the walls.  We asked for ice water and they came back with tepid water straight from the faucet; they have no ice they said.  We had the usual dim sum affair: har gaw(terrible sticky thick wrapping), sui mai (awful chunks of fatty pork), bean curd roll (again fatty chunks of pork rolled in greasy tofu sheet, soaked in grease), chicken feet(just inedible), beef rice roll (gritty thick rice roll with unflavored beef).  We were trying to wait for the notable spare rib bowls, but after waiting 20 minutes for them to cook it, between with the deaf guy next to us screaming and the sweltering heat and atrocious food we already tried, we decided it was just not worth the wait.  We paid our $25 and went on our way; leaving Dol Ho was the best part of the experience.", "author": "Helene H."}
