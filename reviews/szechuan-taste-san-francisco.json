The betrayal. Luckily, Szechuan Taste came through.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nEverything here is solid. We ordered the set menu for 3, which came with fried salt and pepper shrimp, fried spareribs, fried flounder, saut\u00e9ed greens, and soup/sliced oranges. (I turned to my sister and asked \"That's a lot of fried things.\" and she raised her eyebrow as if to say \"And?\" ) We also ordered a Fujian fried rice. Nothing to complain about here in terms of taste and quality. The soup wasn't just thickened broth, it was chock full of tofu and meat. It wasn't the most amazing Chinese food I've ever hard, but it was classic. Reminded me of childhood dinners with family where we got 3 dishes for $18.99. \n\nI've also had their lobster noodles before and it wasn't bad. Nothing to write home about. \n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\nThe value here is ridiculous. Almost everything is under $10, closer to $8 per plate. They don't skimp on serving sizes. Our fried flounder was huge. I believe the set menu for 3 was $28. I think we paid around $40 for our party of four and we left with leftovers. \n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThis is an authentic Chinese restaurant. If they bring you tea and don't pick their nose over your food, you are thrilled. That being said, the waiters and waitresses here are efficient. When our waiter put one hand behind his back as he ladled out our portions of soup, we knew he meant business. The waiters mostly spoke Cantonese, but they could also communicate in Mandarin and English.\n\nBonus star because this is probably one of the cheapest places for legit Chinese food in the area. Apparently, Asian parents all over the Bay know of and love this place. I have run into family friends from Palo Alto and San Jose at this restaurant. It is a true SF classic. Anyways, there are tons of menu recommendations written on the wall in Chinese that I want to come try next time.", "author": "Abby W."}

I used to swim at Wawona Pool located not far from the haunted model airplane where it used to sit in the middle of the park.  At night, the residence in the area would hear it howl!!  I kid you not.  It was on the news a lot. Eventually, the plane haunted so many residence that the City took it away.\n\nSo as I was saying, I would pay a visit to Szechuan Taste after swimming practice and I took my coins out of my pocket and counted them one by one, and hope that it would add up to so many dollars because I was that starving kid that needed food in his tummy, especially after swimming practice.  Funny thing, even today the food remains the same from the last time I visited. Some were good, and some were bland.  And if you are looking for suggestions, try their whole crab and half chicken.  They were actually pretty good.  Their clams with black bean sauce was so so and a bit overcooked. In terms of flavor, I was expecting a bit more spicy and more fragrant which Szechuan is known for. But overall, it's decent.  Oh speaking off Szechuan, if you are not familiar where it is in China, it is located in the Southwest Region of Mainland China, not far from Guangzhou Province (Canton).  If you've heard of Yangtze River (longest river in Asia about 3,000 miles and third in the world), then you are in the right location and also not far from Guilin (very famous town).  By the way, many Americans have retired in Guilin and have become a miniature Berkeley California with a bunch of bohemian hippies, dressed with their Tommy Bahama, wondering around with their flip flops eating with their chopstick.  Most of them are actually college professors.  So if you're looking to retire in China, this might be an option for you.\n\nSzechuan Taste haven't changed a bit.  Though they've updated and remolded here and there, but overall, this is still a nice hole in the wall where you can get decent food with decent prices (not overpriced).  The staff here remains super nice and they have quite a long time follower.  They are also very busy up until closing on most days especially weekend.  I'd definitely come back here to eat if I am in the area again.\n\nUntil then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p", "author": "Edwin R."}

The meat was tender and I liked the taste of the sauce along with the little spicy kick it had to it.\n- spicy salted pork spare ribs - I would say that this was the star of the meal. For pork these pieces were favor tender. So tender I thought I was eating fish.\n- deep fried sanddab with soy sauce - I really enjoy fried fish but having it drenched in a plate of soy sauce made the fish fall apart too easily.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-23", "description": "The quality of Szechuan Taste Restaurant has sadly declined over the years. We've ordered takeout from this dingy establishment since I was in fifth grade, and for some reason, we keep on going back. The food is by far not the best, but the prices are very competitive for an Asian restaurant. I still remember getting dropped off as a little boy on the weekend, carrying $30 in cash, running straight to the register, and telling the cashier that I've ordered something for takeout. We usually call in around 30 minute ahead of time, and they always say the food will be done in 15-20 minutes. We always seem to fall for the trap and get there 20 minutes after we call. The cashier then nonchalantly tells me to \"wait a bit kid, the food's still cooking!\" Though the cashiers have changed through the years, I still get a bit confused when my food isn't ready even though they told me to come at this time! Waiting there for 10 minutes, I noticed that the only people that eat here are Chinese construction workers. Conclusion? It's a really affordable place.\n\nWe generally like ordering the fried rice and chow mein dishes. On this occasion, probably our 20th time? man, time really flies, we ordered the Pan Fried Chicken Chow Mein, Yangchow Fried Rice w/Shrimp and Pork, and Singapore-style Rice Vermicelli. These are extremely common Cantonese-styled dishes that you can find at most typical Chinese restaurants in the U.S. of A. \n\nYANGCHOW FRIED RICE W/SHRIMP AND PORK ($6): The most solid of the three dishes, this yangchow fried rice LACKED FLAVOR and the pieces of char siu (BBQ pork), if there was much at all, were extremely hard and reminded me of bacon bits. I usually find solace in eating this dish, but even after eating 3 cups of this, I still WASN'T SATISFIED.\n\nCHICKEN CHOW MEIN ($6): This dish was \"MEH\". Nothing really to complain about, a generous heaping of bok choy, and chicken strips that could be cut with a sharper knife.\n\nSINGAPORE-STYLE RICE VERMICELLI ($6): the most underwhelming of the three dishes. The chef really needed to add some more curry power or salt or something cause it was BLAND. The SHRIMP WAS CLEAN, which is one of my huge pet peeves, so they get bonus points for that! The char sui was dry and not up to standard.\n\nTASTE: 2-3 Stars--Food is \"meh\".\nSERVICE: can't say cause I came here for takeout!\nPRICE: 4-5 Stars--you can't beat the price--seriously!\nTOTAL: 3 Stars--I would give it 3.5 for the price, but the food is really of a \"meh\" quality.\n\nBottom Line: THIS PLACE IS SUPER CHEAP. If you can find a place in SF where you can eat a good amount for only $6 a plate, message me! However, cheap doesn't mean good. The food here really is \"MEH\". Would I come again? If I'm hungry and need a quick cheap bite, sure!", "author": "Andrew C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-24", "description": "I've been coming here time to time for years, and overall I feel the quality at best is just okay, if not slowly inching downhill. If you desperately need Chinese food in a pinch you could swing on by but there are so many better options available out there, so I overall do not recommend coming here and don't find myself coming back here anytime soon.\n\n-The sanitation is poor, both the menus and tables are oddly kinda sticky to the touch, which is a huge turn off for my mindset because if your menus let alone tables aren't clean, can I trust that the plates my food will later be on will be clean as well? Also, turns out the guy heavily smoking in the front of the restaurant that I passed entering the restaurant was going to be my server, so it was fun watching him finish his smoke break and then just walk right in and take my order immediately without washing up his hands or anything else at all, whoopie. The bathrooms gets a low scoring mark as well, although it's definitely not the dirtiest bathroom I've ever seen, it certainly isn't the cleanest by a long shot. I normally never comment on sanitation for buisnesses but I've never been that disgusted in restaurant's sanitation before, so...\n\nThe food itself was a hit and miss.\n   -Ordered Chow Fun with Beef, overall the noodle strips(?) were decent but seemed kinda greasy despite the fact it wasn't even that flavorful. The beef was also decent and it came with a couple pieces of broccoli to I guess balance out the greasieness of the dish. Overall it was okay, nothing extraordinary.\n  -Hong Kong Style Crab was a tad flavorless, and considering how expensive crab already is you would think you'd be paying for a really great quality crab, but despite the size of the crab it's not seasoned very well. Overall kinda bland and not very flavorful at all.\n  -The real and probably the only star of the show was probably the salt and pepper pork chops, which was I thought was pretty good, well seasoned, and flavorful compared to the other dishes I tried. The pork was fried nicely, chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Probably the only thing I liked about this place, and if I ever come back I would definitely order this. Mmmhmm.\n\n-It also occurred to me that this was the place where I officially stopped my old love of Honey Walnut Prawns because quite frankly I believe this place ruined it for me. I know a lot of people on Yelp rave about it, but I just can't agree with that considering my terrible past experience that I had here once before. I used to be a huge fan of Honey Walnut Prawns and I remember the last time I ever had it was here a couple of years ago. I remembered the walnuts were a tad too sweet & sticky and the mayonaise shrimp was maybe coated with too much mayonaise? \n\n Ok, I'll admit, maybe it wasn't entirely this places' fault completely, maybe it was a combination of things from an entire day's worth of things I had eaten, but I remember eating a lot of this particular dish and within half an hour or so after leaving the restaurant I did not feel too particularly well. What happened next was when I got home I found myself with severe food poisoning and threw up everywhere. Needless to say now everytime I see Honey Walnut Prawns or oddly mayonaise (because the shrimp is coated in a thick layer of it) everywhere else I gag, and I now avoid the dish like the plague. Needless to say I do NOT recommend the Honey Walnut Shrimp.\n\nJust overall not really the best place to go and grab Chinese food,  but if you're in a bind I guess it'll make do. And judging from the next to empty people sitting inside eating, I shouldn't have been so surprised. Needless to say I'd skip past here and go somewhere else.", "author": "Allison O."}

I mean $5.95 for a quick plate of sweet and sour chicken and an abundance of rice, as well as other options such as Mongolian beef? You can't beat it that easily. The only con for the latter is that the onion to beef ratio is 2:1 in favor of onions. But when factoring in cheap price and the portion, you can't go wrong!\n\nLet's face it. This is your hole-in-the-wall restaurant that knows no garish decors, unlike that one restaurant I reviewed (or roasted) a few blocks down a few months ago.

It can be a little dirty at times; flies will be flying around, or some leftover food might be under the table, but I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone. The lunch specials are great and affordable and is a for sure place to eat for some decent Chinese food. We usually order Mongolian beef, Spicy tofu with shredded pork, saute green beans with pork, spinach with pork, and usually alternate between saute eggplants with pork, claypot chicken, and steamed eggs (see the specials menu)\n\nPOST 2012 MANAGEMENT/CHEF CHANGE - All the dishes were extremely sweet....tasted like a lot of MSG! It was really shocking to find out the chef had changed. I was disappointed because even dishes that are supposed to be spicy, ie the Mongolian beef has become a grossly sweet dish.  We ordered the stuff we always do and almost all of the dishes had shrunk significantly in proportion and the taste was just OFF.

This is the last time I will come here.  I'd rather starve, and if you know me, that is a big deal. LOL  I really don't give a damn how awesome the food is for dirt cheap.  You don't have to sacrifice a clean atmosphere for yummy and cheap.  It makes you wonder if the chef picks up a piece of meat off the grease stained floor and throws it back in the wok.\n\nSzechuan Taste is exemplary in depicting the typical mess of clashing colors, disorganized composition of beautiful Chinese artwork and taped paper menus on the walls that seem to plague the interiors of Chinese restaurants in general.  Oddly enough, there were no pink table cloths, but alas, they worked it in the scheme with the other purple and silver paper lanterns dangling from the ceiling.  Someone must have been seeing black and white with the hunter green tablecloths, red chairs and striped red carpet under the pastel colored lanterns.  Ahhhh...the carpet...  The stale, putrid scents captured by this red devil are pretty much what hits your nose as soon as you walk in here.  This leads me to the final nails in the coffin for this place.\n\nSince, I decided to keep my mouth shut about coming here, I politely placed my head in the sand and decided not to read the Yelp reviews.  That was a prudent choice.  However, after lunch, my stomach churned after I read about the closing of this restaurant by the Health Department due to vermin a couple years ago.  Then, there's Earl G. who found a maggot in his bok choy.   Nice.  It really makes me wonder what the hell has changed here.  I've eaten at cleaner restaurants in China sitting outdoors in a dumpy city called Kaiping!!  \n\nNew management must be a joke.  Last time we sat in the middle away from walls.  There is less to notice there.  There were also no aggressive flies. This time we sat in front of the store front window.  I turn towards the window to cast my eyes on dust and dead bugs near the seam where the glass front meets the shelf.  *shutter*  - blow number two to my appetite after the foul smelling carpet!  There was one dirty plate and a dirty spoon we had to send back.  Yes, it continues. Time to eat off my chipped plate!  Our steamed rice arrived in a plastic container stricken with third degree burns.  Yes, our rice pot was deformed.  I had to keep from laughing when I helped myself to some rice.  Yes, it gets better!   Enter the horror of the restroom.  Wow, it looked like a guy had got hold of a fire hose in there if you know what I mean.  I need not expand on the ghastly conditions of this restroom.  I was holding my breath as long as I could and gasping for air after exiting this cesspool.\n\nAs I end this review, I am no longer hungry for the snack I intended on reaching for prior to this review.

The dishes here are also pretty good - not the best, but good tasting and very comforting.\n\nBetween 3 of us, we ordered a whole Fried Fish (I think the slab), House Special Tofu, and Shrimp Fried Rice. The Fried Fish was really good - crispy, tasty, and complimented very well with the accompanying sauce. I also really liked their House Special Tofu - Tofu was good, sauce was delicious, and I liked the combination of toppings that came with it - seafood, pork, etc. Fried Rice was really good and prepared the way I like my fried rice - light in color, right amount of saltiness, and very tasty.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

The English name is Szechuan Taste. While I have only been here once, I don't recall there being any authentic Sichuan/Szechuan dishes here, and unless they used Sichuan peppercorns, you can toss Tobasco sauce on fried rice and hope nobody notices. \n\nThe Chinese name of this restaurant, ironically is Tsang Jiang Hakka in Mandarin or Tseurng Gong Hakka in Cantonese (TK referring to one of the more famous rivers in China, and of course Hakka referring to a tribe of family oriented migrants that eventually settled from the North into the South of China, including Canton Province, and many emigrated to Taiwan, particularly Hsin Chu in SW Taipei County and developed many superb unique receipes and flavors not found anywhere else). Hakka cuisine and Sichuan food are two completely different things.\n\nIf this place offers Hakka Cantonese style food, I certainly don't see the connection here anywhere. Maybe really poor stripped down versions, or a tease of the real thing but substituted with grease, MSG, salt, canned materials, all hoping that you the budget minded gourmet, might not notice, know, or even care (do you really?)\n\nMaybe this place might work with non Chinese diners, or those whose tastebuds have been so dumbed down that they are complacent with these kinds of places (similar to 8 Immortals much further down the block, for cheap ok value but not necessarily refined Cantonese). There certainly are more Cantonese/Chinese restaurants on Taraval, that likely offer better quality for bargain values. Definitely no need for me at least to come here.\n\nBut the best and most ironic part is that years and years ago, my ex's sister witnessed the most hilarious event here. A waitress running out of the restaurant, telling a customer \"hey you didn't tip!\". Embarassing enough that the budget minded Asian Cheapness customer (aren't we all) did not tip, but even more embarassing that a waitress had to remind this person. \n\nSome say a restaurant is only as good as your desire to want to work there.

I also don't understand why they put THREE deep-fried items on the same menu, plus a very oily vegetable dish.\n\nThe only good thing was how cheap it all was, so we could just ignore the fish. The fried pork chops were pretty good, as well as the salt/pepper shrimp, but god was that fish disgusting... \n\nWait, did I remember to mention the fried fish?", "author": "Winnie K."}

The waiters, all twenty-something HK ragamuffins, still slap each other on the butt when they pass. Okay, the decor is a little different. When I was in high school the owners removed the faux-ski-lodge wall panels. But besides this I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nI have a hundred stories to tell about this place. One time when I was in college my family took my roommate here. Being from Boston, he hadn't tried much authentic Chinese food before, but he came away a fan of ST. (He didn't comment, though, on our table in a narrow section next to the restrooms - or the constant stream of patrons who bumped into our table on their way.)  On a recent visit with my mother, the joint was packed and we were seated at the same table as a young Caucausian couple. The man, an Irish emigre, apparently had never had Chinese food before; he asked his companion, a fetching Russian girl, what chow mein was. The girl asked the waiter about an item on the menu. Following ST custom, the waiter responded, \"Very good choice!\" Five minutes later, a sumptuous plate of fried rice came for the gentleman, and for the devushka: a small dish of cold gelatinous offal. The Russian asked her friend to share the food. His reply: \"No bloody way I'm eating that!\"\n\nWhen Oprah talks about comfort food, she means a bucket of fried chicken. When I talk about comfort food, I mean a plate of fried salt and pepper pork chops at Szechuan Taste. If you want service and ambience go to Tommy Toy's. If you want the first choice in the Sunset for Chinese food chosen by contractors on their lunch break, Filipino families after church, and multi-generational households of Chinese Americans, take the L line to Szechuan Taste.", "author": "William L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-09", "description": "My regular go-to for Chinese. Clientele largely Asian. Service fast but frantic. Don't expect subtlety here in decor, service, atmosphere. Wildly vibrant paint and a faint aura of grunge, but sanitary enough. But the food is great, if you stay away from all the predictable stuff like chicken broccoli. Get the whole fried sand dab, or the steamed oysters, or the very cheap shrimp in egg custard. Delicious. Tip: Look around and see what the Asians are having. (It may not be on the menu.) Point and click, and the waiters will  bring it. Guilty pleasure: Walnut prawns, in something that looks like mayonnaise. What could it be?", "author": "Antonio P."}

I have to admit, the ambience need a lot of makeover....especially the bathroom (Don't go in there unless you REALLY have to!)  But the food and prices makes up the difference.  \n\nWhere would you find a 5 item dinner for $18.  It's enough to feed over 4 ppl.  (Minced beef soup; fried prawns; mustard greens; fried flounder; bejing spareribs, and dessert - Mango tapioca & orange).\n\nIf not the set dinner menu, there's always the separate items for $3.50.  If you can read chinese (I can bare read) they also offer some good items plastered all over the walls in chinese.\n\nGood food, good prices", "author": "Gary Y."}

We all came out really full and even had leftovers which me and my sister are enjoying for dinner right now.  Yes, the decor is a bit dirty and bland, but those are the type of restaurants with the best food and its cheap!  They don't even charge for rice (for lunch at least)!", "author": "Erika C."}

The service at this restaurant was not good, probably worse than the average Chinese restaurant.  The waiter simply ignored you so you would have to call or wave your hands to get any service.  The food came out really quick though.  But I think there was a reason because the chef simply deep fried all the meat or seafood dishes as a first step.  I could see and taste it.  They lemon chicken was really dry because of the deep fry.   All dishes we ordered taste okay but they were way too greasy for me, even the vegetable dishes.   I can a layer of oil at the bottom of my vegetable.    The crab was also deep fried before seasoning so it kinda ruin the freshness of the crab meat.   I was not hugely disappointed because the price is very cheap and I did not expect greatness for the price they charged.  I also like the steam egg and lamb clay pot.  They tasted good and not as greasy as other dishes.\nIn summary, I felt the restaurant was okay but I probably won't come back just because I don't like the amount of oil they put in my food.", "author": "Ben c."}

The service is very friendly and the prices are rock bottom.  I love the TV with the Cantonese programing; not that I can speak a lick as I'm Caucasian, but nevertheless it adds character.  The pot stickers are small yet delectable crispy golden morsiles with a perfect ground pork, cabbage, and ginger filling; perfect topped with a little sweet & sour sauce.  The chicken corn soup is large as are all the portions; plan on taking leftovers home.!  The soup is a large bowl of creamed corn, bits of chicken with a bit of grizzle yet still pretty good in a thick yet light broth.  The Mongolian beef is tender with onions and carrots over crispy rice noodles in a spicy chili garlic sauce that will pack enough punch to wake up your tastebuds yet not clear your sinuses.  The seafood chow mein, though a little oily tasting, was still worth it with soft noodles, fresh vegetables, prawns, scallops, and squid; it would have been cool if they would have had the yee mein.  The steamed rice is firm not soggy.  The tea is wonderful as are the fresh oranges for dessert.  So, for excellent Hakka & Szechuan cuisine at rock bottom prices in a clean no frills atmosphere with friendly service, Szechuan Taste cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

I pass by the area from time to time and I am surprised that people actually continue to eat there.  I ate there once for someone's birthday dinner and never came back.  Basically the food was pretty good, I'm not going to lie.  However, the restroom was filthy.  All of the toilets overflowed and there was water all-over the floor.  There was no soap dispensers or soap in the bathroom.  I find that disturbing especially after I saw one of the employees use the restroom before me and then washed her hands without using soap.  To top it all off, there was a roach in the take-out box.  Disgusting!  never again.  I heard stories about the place afterwords.  If I knew it would be that unsanitary, I would have never attended the dinner party.  An ex-coworker of mine ate there a year after and also complained because a roach fell from the ceiling and onto his plate.  I really want this nasty place shut down.

There is no question - their salt and pepper pork chops (over rice to go) is a favorite of many.  They have several LARGE tables - many families drop by for dinner.  The portions are large, service is fast, food is tasty - excellent value for the money.  Keep in mind you are not paying for 5 star accommodations and you'll be well satisfied.

I give it credit because places like these ensure me that decent Chinese food still exists and that I shouldn't lose faith in Chinese Food (i.e. P.F Chang and Panda Express). I've lived in the neighborhood for most of my life and my family regulars this place like every other month. Our favorite dishes are clams in black bean sauce, this deep fried fish (if you go you can see a lot of people getting it), this steamed fish, some soup with scallops(sorry for my vagueness in menu items, I can't recall the names of the dishes on top of my head), and fried rice. For the most part, the portions are OKAY, but definately over the years they've downsized their portions. When I was younger, we would get a mountain of clams, and now I think at most there are about six.... Yeah... that doesn't sound too good. Overall, good for a quick and DECENT Chinese fix.", "author": "Julie L."}

The place is absolutely filthy, FILTHY.. I have no idea how they haven't been shut down.  Our glasses and dishware had dried food stuck to it, the carpets and walls are disgusting, and there were hundreds of tiny fruit flies swarming around us during our meal.  The service was terrible and the food was even worse.  The three of us that went ate a total of 6 bites before waiting 30 minutes to get our check.  I could go on and on, but I think that you get the point.  If you read this, and you still eat there, then you deserve the experience that you will have.  I literally just came home and joined YELP to warn the world about this restaurant.  I am going to go vomit now, thanks for reading.", "author": "Steve O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-13", "description": "In three words, the food at this place can be described as, cheap, greasy, and cheap.  This is not gourmet fare.  It is chinese comfort food, and its has some of the lowest prices you can find for a restaurant in the Sunset, which is already pretty low.  I come here with such great frequency, that the waitstaff(one of whom speaks english, along with the woman who takes the money) commented when I cut my hair.  I've never eaten inside, if only because I would be embarrassed to take a friend there, since the decor consists of dirty curtains, bare white walls with the occasional picture of one of those waterfalls where the water moves in some kind of screen.  How do those work, btw?  This restaraunt is like a guilty pleasure.  And I love it.  It's perfect for when you need food, need food now, and need food cheap.  You can feed yourself for a day and half one one order of 4.00 chow mein, which I highly reccomend.  It's on Taraval at 19th, next door to the Shannon Arms.  Big yellow awning.  Every sunseter should have them on speed dial.  Its like putting smiles into your belly, is one way to think about it.", "author": "Mike C."}

The comments on rats and insects are nonsense (though my table might have been wiped down a little more thoroughly before I arrived).

I can not find a res truant with this price in the whole bay area. As they say, they are really the king of restaurant in bay area. I just make it easy \" The half price of the fast food, and you can get more full then the fast food. I don't care the environment because you have to understand, it was a old restaurant, how can you expect it every thing is new. If they are not good how can they survive.
