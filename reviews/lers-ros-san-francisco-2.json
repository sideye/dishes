I have to always remember that in Thai restaurants, mild is still spicy.  This dish was good, but I've had better. My lazy self wished the cabbage wasn't still in a wedge and shredded so I didn't have to mix it into the sauce and cut it. The sauce for the salad was good - your typically papaya salad mix. The prawns weren't memorable and of course wasn't much portion. It's good, but for the price I probably wouldn't order this dish here again since there's so many other better dishes this restaurant serves. \n\nDish: Pad Thai\nCost: $13.95\nRating: 4/5\nReview: Pad Thai is probably my favorite Thai dish of all time so I usually order it everywhere I go :p It was good here but not my favorite. It's so pricey for a normal sized portion!\n\nThere are 3 locations I believe but this review was from the Larkin Street one in the TL district. Parking can be scarce but not impossible! Located in a sketchy neighborhood so don't leave any valuables! You can make reservations here and I highly suggest making reservations!

The place is located in the Little Saigon area on the other side of the Tenderloin, and it wasn't too crowded when we went, but there was a big table. Because of that though, I felt service was a bit slow and we didn't get much attention until after the big table left.\n\nThe food itself was okay, I had the two item combo and I got the green curry and the Pad Kra Pow Kai. The curry itself was pretty flavorful, but beyond that there wasn't really anything special about it, just standard of what you would get elsewhere. The ground chicken was just okay, it benefitted from adding a bit of lime and chili to it. \n\nOne of the main drawbacks though is that they didn't provide me with the various chili, peppers etc. toppings that usually come with most Thai meals. Instead I had to ask for some of it on the side, and ended up just getting sliced fresh peppers (which were good, but not what I had expected).\n\nOtherwise an average Thai place, plenty of other great options in the city.", "author": "Tyler T."}

On a Friday evening it was packed to the brim with people waiting outside for a table. I was hesitant to get something but as I simply wanted something to-go I walked in and ordered.\n\nI decided to get the Kuay Tiew Rua ($11.95) which is just a fancy name for Thai Boat Noodle soup. After ordering I paid and then proceeded to wait outside. I waited and waited and then waited some more. Without exaggeration I waited about 40 minutes in the cold for a simple order of boat noodle soup. Each time I asked about the progress I was told it was it was almost done. Finally, when I asked for the order to be cancelled they gave me the soup. \n\nI good news is that I got 2 containers one with the noodles and the other with the broth which keeps the noodles from becoming soggy. The bad news is that the broth lacked seasoning. It had a ton of spices as I had asked for spicy but they seemed to be simply added to the broth rather than being properly cooked with it. Another issue was that the quantity of noodles in the order was very little and were all clumped together. Goes without saying I did not like what I got. \n\nPrice-wise this was about 20% more than the same dish in Pak Nam Thai noodle bar and 10% less than Lapats Thai Noodle Bar both of which are just a block down the road. Unfortunately, the quality is nowhere even close to what you can get at the other two places. I had high hopes for Lers Ros given its high ratings but I was thoroughly disappointed with my visit.

Every bit of the basil chicken was very flavorful and the texture went perfectly with the rice. The chicken in the curry probably could've been more tender. \n\nFor dessert, we went with a pretty popular choice here: fried banana with strawberry ice-cream.

Last two visits were with larger groups, so I definitely had a chance twice to try a large variety of their dishes. I feel I'm \"supposed\"to like it, because of all the hype and restaurant-generated pr that they definitely excel at. Every single time, though, I left wondering if it was me who ordered the wrong dishes, or if I was just missing something. It wasn't me. This place knows how to pump up the pr, but little else. \n\nFood - Many dishes were pretty salty, like the frog and their red curry dishes. Eel was cut into super tiny pieces and were small and bony to get any meat off the eels. Fail. Other places have way more meaty slices. Total waste. roast duck was mostly a soggy glob of fat.\n Tried both the chicken and pork pad see yuck (yes, I mean yuck). Strange, the pork one was super salty and the chicken one was bland, but both had mushy flat noodles. These rice noodles can be difficult to cook, especially if they're not super fresh. I suspect the latter is true.  Clearly, not much effort is made into presentation either, as many of their dishes were accompanied with the same sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and cilantro garnish.\n\n DIshes I did like were the deep fried tofu and the deep fried crab ball-like appetizer.\n\nService was certainly no stand out. Seems that you need to ask for any and all water refills. Our waitress was polite, but really wasn't able to sufficiently address questions I had about some dishes I was contemplating between. I sensed a language barrier, on her part.\n\nNothing special at all about the ambiance inside, but...\n\nTOURISTS BEWARE:\nNow the ambiance outside, well, anyone coming here needs to know it's really a sketchy hood that has gotten even worst in recent years. If you don't mind walking by people who are shooting up, drugged out, drunk, in need of serious mental health services, or are asleep on the ground propped up against the wall, then you should be fine. And you need to be ok with the more than normal San Francisco stench of urine all over. If that's hip for you, go at it. Not for me. The food, service and atmosphere is so not worth that! And of course, don't forget the higher than normal rate of car break-ins here in the Tenderloin. Knowing all this in advance, I Ubered here.\n\nGave it more than a fair chance.

If I'm feeling particularly lazy, I just call in my order and pick it up. There is a bit of a language barrier sometimes, depending on who picks up the phone, so I try to keep my questions and requests a bit more basic. I've also dined in here and have found the service to be just fine. \n\nI've had:\n1. Red curry (with duck and also with beef separate times) - very creamy, with a lot of flavor and a bit on the spicy side. I've noticed that they do not ask you how spicy you'd like this, and when it comes out, it's a little on the spicy side, however, it's not too spicy for me to handle. I absolutely love this with the duck, as the meat is so tender. I don't recall much about the beef, so I feel like that was just fine.\n\n2. Tom yum soup - very good here. The perfect amount of sour.\n\n3. Papaya salad with prawns - I love love love the papaya salad here. My bf is not a fan of it as it's made with a bit more fish sauce than other Thai places, however, I do not mind this at all. One time, I requested this to be spicy, which was the worst decision I have ever made in my life. My mouth was on fire; I actually started picking out the Thai bird peppers in the salad and eventually ended up with a huge mound of peppers. In short, do not get this spicy.\n\n4. Pad Thai - Slightly better than your typical pad thai. Good flavor plus the lime on the side adds the sour element that I love. However, it's just pad thai, you know?\n\n5. Stir fry pork belly - one of the famed items here. I thought it was good and a nice choice out of your \"typical\" Thai orders.

We were in the TL neighborhood over the weekend and decided to come here for any early dinner.  We were seated right away and the prices on the overwhelming menu definitely skyrocketed!  Everything was over $13+, even for appetizers.  Fine, I guess it's the cost of living in SF, right?  \n\nWe were genuinely overwhelmed with the 2 different menus and asked the waitress for some recommendations.  She pointed like 20 different things (very fast) and didn't really help narrowing down the choices.  \n\nWe ordered 4 dishes for 4 of us to share.  One of the waitress's recommendation was a crispy pork belly in sauce.  Their crispy pork belly is basically the Chinese roast pork smothered with sauce.  The sauce was tasty but I didn't think it was so special to warrant a $16 price tag.  The crab fried rice, the Pad See Eew and the Yellow Curry were all, meh.  I didn't think the dishes were that spectacular and the service was also almost non-existent.  \n\nAn additional star shaved off their ratings due to the poor design of their tables/chairs and bathrooms.  The chairs are basically wooden stools so (1) they are very uncomfortable because you can't lean back and (b)  you don't have any place to hang your purse or your coat.  It's the most unrelaxing environment at a restaurant I experienced, having to balance my bulking jacket and my purse on my lap the whole time!  * we had 4 people and were seated at a table with 4 chairs/stools.  \n\nThe bathroom is upstairs and the ceiling is so low I walk in fear that I will hit my head somewhere and I'm only 5'7\".  All that time I'm thinking how is this legal and pass the building/planning department.  \n\nSo yeah, not coming back anytime soon.", "author": "Jannie Q."}

The food is so good here! I came here for lunch because my best friend was raving about the dry noodles. \n\nYes. Get the dry noodles because they are amazing. There is so much sweet, sour, and salt and yet it's not overpowering at all. I seriously recommend this dish. The noodles were cooked well and I loved the sauce. Mix everything up well before consuming. \n\nWe also ordered the duck salad. If you like the gaminess in duck, you'll like this. It's a mixture of flavors and textures that are so addicting. \n\nWe also ordered the tom yum because we couldn't skip out on it. It was good. I don't remember it being as amazing as the dry noodles, but still very good. \n\nThe curry puffs were a yummy way to start. It was a nice shareable item while we waited for the other goods. \n\nI would definitely come here again.

First off the location is a bit dicey, but once you get past that you're in for some really awesome Thai food.  Was on holiday in SF and I heard the Asian food is quite good over here.  I had also been craving some really good Thai as I had yet to have some actual authentic Thai food, have pretty much been settling so far.  Came for lunch and it was pretty quiet - a Tuesday.  This place has a bar as well if you want to have some drinks.\n\nActually we ended up coming back here again so this review is for both visits.  We ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp, Lunch special with Chicken Red Curry and Kai Pad Khing and on the second visit the Pad See Ew with Beef, Green Curry and Kao Pad.\n\nPad Thai with Shrimp ($12.95) - I was a bit worried this was going to be overly sweet or something, sometimes you can't tell even when a place has really great reviews.  I asked for extra spicy and it was perfect - just the right amount of spice and it tasted soooo good!!! Really awesome and proper authentic Pad Thai, they had infused the spice so it wasn't just chillies all over the place - definitely recommend trying this dish, it was a standout.\nLunch Special, Red Curry Chicken and Kai Pad Khing ($11.95) - The ginger in the Kai Pad Khing was really fresh and strong - in a good way.  But I would suggest not getting the lunch specials/combos, they seem like they're quite standard, you can't make any changes like asking for extra spicy so guess they must be buffet style - go a la carte.  It wasn't bad but tasted a bit food courtish (not a word I know).\nPad See Ew with Beef ($12.95) - At first the waitress said that they couldn't do extra spicy for this but got her to check with the chef, as I got the Pad Thai extra spicy the day before so was sure they could do the same for this - and they can.  Again another awesome dish, great taste and good spice level - it was quite spicy but just right   Wouldn't suggest beef though, was a bit chewy, would try the shrimp next time.\nKang Keaw Wan - Green Curry ($14.95) - Really great too, flavourful and good quantity.\nThai Fried Rice ($11.95) - Delicious, just like the Kao Pad in Thailand, Australia and NZ - both of which also have super authentic Thai places.\n\nQuantity - Great quantity, we couldn't finish it all, of course on the second day we did overorder.\nAmbience - Small casual scene, went during weekday lunch times so not sure how it is during dinner time.\nService - Great service, accommodating and attentive.\nSpice - 4/5, Perfect amount of spice, actually bordering on a 5 since I did ask for extra but it wasn't an overkill which real Thai hot can be.\nTaste - Amazing, reminded me of the authentic Thai which was on every corner in AU and NZ and which I haven't had in the longest time.\n\nOverall the best Thai I've had in US so far, and I've tried a few now in Atlanta, Dallas and NJ.  This place was so good we had to have it again, actually had it 3 times as we ordered it through uber eats for dinner as well - it's that good and couldn't risk trying something else that I wouldn't love.  Get the Pad Thai, I'd say it was the best item I tried and seems to be a signature dish for the restaurant.  And if you like spice, go ahead and ask for extra spicy, it's worth it", "author": "Jacqui H."}

It was the first time I've seen Chang on the menu since I was in Thailand so I got one of those and my go to: pad kee mao with shrimp. The portion was huge, and very fresh flavors with a generous portion of shrimp. My friends ordered a duck stir fry and truly one of the best pad thai I've ever tasted. \n\nThe service was a little odd, the duck came out first, followed 5 minutes later by my noodles, then 10 minutes later the pad thai, so I'm not sure if it's all meant to be shared or if the kitchen was just backed up that night.

Besides the seriously bad location, everything from the layout to the service to the food was subpar.  \n\nSince we were a group of 20, we made reservations in advance and instead of giving us the large long table (which was unoccupied) they split our group into 2 sets of 10 which was just logistically a nightmare. In addition, the food came out at all different times, which normally would have been fine except that our 3 vegetarian friends, who had ordered first, literally had to wait for an hour and a half for their food. I live near the Hayes Valley location, and have gone often enough that I've tasted many of the more popular dishes. That being said, this location did not balance the flavors well. Many dishes lacked the wonderful complex, savory aspects that the same dishes at other locations have. Other dishes were just way too spicy and overall, I would recommend by-passing this place and consider going to the Hayes Valley location.", "author": "Quinn Li O."}

Given that this place is pretty popular, I was expecting a short wait for our group of 3, but we got seated within minutes.\n\nI opted for a lighter meal as I wasn't too hungry. The garlic and pepper rabbit on their daily specials menu caught my attention, so I went with that as it's been years since I last had rabbit meat. The server warned me that the dish would be very bony, but I grew up eating meat off of bones, so I wasn't too worried. Both of my friends ordered different curries.\n\nOur food came out within a reasonable amount of time. The garlic and pepper rabbit was indeed full of bones like our server had warned me, so keep that in mind if you're looking to get it. It was exactly what I wanted though, which was something light to nibble on while my friends ate. \n\nThere wasn't too much meat on each piece, but it was extremely garlic-y, to the point where I couldn't taste any other flavors on the meat (or the natural taste of the meat itself). It was overly salty too, so I had to eat each bite of the meat with some rice.

Glad you asked, I have 3 good reasons: a) nowhere else in San Francisco (or this continent) will you find this tropical fruit, b) it's seasonal, so Lers Ros doesn't even always have it, and c) it's the most deliciously sweet and rich fruit you'll ever try. Ever. No fruit on the face of this planet is as rich in flavor as the durian. You can hold your nose if you can't stand the smell, but you have got to try it.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the group to share. Pretty much every dish we ordered was tasty and seems pretty authentic. I recommend getting sticky rice to eat along with your food! So much better than white rice. \n\nNuer Tod (Fried Sun-Dried Beef) This tastes kind of like beef jerky to me as it was chewy. You'll like this dish if you like beef jerky. It comes with a chili sauce that you dip your meat in. The sauce is spicy, but super good. \n\nKor moo yang (Grilled Pork) The dish contains mouth-watering pieces of pork shoulders. They were soft, tender, and flavorful. It also comes with a spicy dipping sauce like the Nuer Tod. I liked this one better than the beef dish above.\n\nNam tok moo (Thai Spicy Pork Salad) This was my favorite dish. The pork was crispy and crunchy and godly. \n\nThai Herb Sausage. The sausage had a lot of spices in it and was pretty good.\n\nKana moo grob (Stir Fried Pork Belly and Chinese Broccoli) This was unbelievably delicious!! It features crispy pork belly (three whole layers of pork) with Chinese broccoli stir fried with garlic and possibly oyster sauce. Fattening, but delicious.\n\nYum talay (Thai Seafood Salad) This was my least favorite dish among what we ordered. The seafood is half-cooked and mixed in for the salad. There was not a lot of taste in it.\n\nAfter I've finished eating, my lips were kinda burning from the spiciness of all the foods, but so worth it!

Its like 4 blocks from civic, so its a decent walk to build your appetite. On your walk to the restaurant you'll pass bu the street natives and the smelly smells but what can you say...its San Francisco. The restaurant is small in size but you can fit a a nice party. It has a cool color scheme that makes the environment stress free. Its small so i hope you don't mind giving up a little personal space but then again in San Francisco personal space does not exist. The food is phenomenal! I LOVE getting the spring rolls because their peanut sauce is off the hook. I think they have a pretty good peanut sauces and i've tried a few so take my word! I ordered the number 57 (Kao Pad Kai Tod). Its crispy chicken over fried rice with their vinegar sauce! F**** delicious! The chicken had a thin layer of crispy batter that made the chicken and vinegar combo the best. The fried rice was perfect and i've tried a lot of different Thai Fried Rices so take my WORD!

It was a miracle that the waitress even heard the phone now that I think back on it. \nRegardless, the food was pretty good. We got the duck larb, pad see ew, and green curry. The duck larb was my favorite. Slightly sour, full of spice and flavor, all rolled into a cabbage slice. YUMS. Then the pad see ew (vegetarian) satisfied my noodle craving.

My condolences to those with a peanut allergy.\n- Lek Tom Yum Haeng (specialty rice noodle w/ fish cake and roasted & minced pork)- Nice and neat presentation.

The flavors fuse together so perfectly that I struggled with every mouthful fearing I would get closer and closer to finishing my bowl. The roasted pork was amazing with extra crispy skin and soft meat. The last few bites had to the best with all the pork bits and chewy noodles soaked in sauce at the bottom of the bowl. Ugh, never knew food could make me feel this type of way.\n\nAmbiance is trendy and hip.

For two, we ordered the Pad See Ew with Beef ($13), Red Curry with Roasted Duck ($15), BBQ Marinated Pork ($11), and a side of Jasmine Rice ($2). Not a single item disappointed, which is amazing. We started with the BBQ pork skewers, which came in four huge pieces. The grilled flavor topped with their spicy sauce was so delicious. Be careful if you can't handle spicy, though! The pad see ew is a classic that I always order at any Thai restaurant and it was hefty and delicious. But my shockingly favorite dish here had to be the red curry! Make sure to get the rice for the curry, which just compliments the dish so well between the roasted duck, bell peppers, pineapples and cucumbers. The curry is packed with flavor that had me sipping it straight off the bowl. \n\nWe were stuffed by the end of the meal despite still wanting to eat everything because it was so good. We took the pad see ew to-go, which was still just as delicious as leftovers. I had to say that the food here is delicious. A couple things I'd advise for management is a place to put our bags/jackets because the chairs are basically stools --awkward.

There's been a lot of new Thai restaurants on the scene (Farmhouse, Kin Khao) but Lers Ros remains my fav. Last visit, I came without a reservation and a couple minutes before my friend who arrived just on time. The hostess said a table would be open shortly and was nice enough offer to hold it for up to 10 mins. Luckily, my friend popped in just after and we were seated shortly.\n\nService was pretty attentive about the good things like refilling water and not too pushy about adding more to your order. The entrees are filling but not too heavy and I love that you can get it a la carte without rice for cheaper, which I don't eat rice anyways. Most entrees are $9 - $14 and filling. The only downside is the food is a touch too salty for my taste.\n\nTom Kha Kai - Really fresh and vibrant lemongrass flavor. The coconut milk broth is the right amount of richness without being overly creamy. My only complaint is it it's sometimes overly salty, especially when you get to the bottom. Admittedly, I have really positive associations with this soup, it's so comforting and warm, my ideal soup for recovering from a cold.\n\nLarb Phed Yang - Roasted duck salad. A good amount of soft and fatty duck pieces but the seasoning is on point. So much umami and flavor, tangy kick from the lime, mildly spicy chili, a little sweetness from the onion and scallion.

The red curry is definitely one of the better ones in the Bay Area with some Thai kick, and to me that is enough to go with a whole plate of brown rice. But as we are certainly striving to consume less carbs, there are many vegetables to choose from. My mixed vegetables with tofu tastes pretty home styled except the tofu smelled a lil questionable. But since I'm still healthily writing this comment two days after, I will question my paranoia instead. The basil chicken is flavorful and appetizing too ! Certainly a spot I would revisit, for the curry, generous portion and comfortable environment. Just be sure to arrive before the lunch crowd around noon ! Kap kun kap !", "author": "Chean L."}

First impressions are already memorable as soon as you walk into the doors. They have very simple furniture which makes you feel like you're getting real Thai street food. I love the quotes they have on the wall as well. \n\nWe ordered some pad thai as well as Tom kha soup. Both weren't as spicy as we liked but that's okay since...I haven't actually been able to find any spicy thai food here compared to Portland. The flavor though was definitely great. The pad thai came in a rather large portion and was sauced well. It was definitely affordable at $12, but doesn't necessarily stand out like Osha Thais. \n\nThe tom kha though, was superb. It came out on a flaming pot, which is awesome because I hate when my soup cools down during my meal. It wasn't too much coconut like some places have, and slightly sour but they give you plenty of meat, as well as mushrooms. It was also a very large portion for only $12.95 and I had to take some home. \n\nOverall, this place is definitely homie and has decent Thai food. I would love to come back to try some of their speciality items, and their prices are a big selling point for me.", "author": "My N."}

It is worth noting that none of the curry or salad dishes came with rice, and you had to order it separately. It came out to about $75, which I think isn't too bad if we were sitting down, but for takeout, it's a bit much.\n\nThe fried tofu appetizer was fine, although it might be worth ordering fresh, since it tends to get soggy when trapped in a takeout container. The papaya salad was excellent, although I just wish there was more of it for $10. The duck salad was also decent, but there just didn't seem to be enough duck, especially since the duck wasn't really deboned. Both pad see-ew dishes were pretty on point, but I also feel that flat noodles are the easiest to execute from a takeout/delivery perspective. The green chicken curry had some really good flavors, but was a touch too greasy for my tastes. \n\nOverall, we found the food delicious, but given the smaller portion size, it's hard to find the value. I'd probably order from Lers Ros again if I was was jonesin' for Thai food, but wasn't feeling particularly hungry. Perhaps I might be underestimating the costs of Thai food in San Francisco, but it just didn't seem like a good deal. I also like House of Thai when it comes to takeout, but the good thing about Lers Ros is that their delivery seems just a touch faster and the food quality is just a little better, so you can take that into account.", "author": "Eric J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-17", "description": "Came here back in 2013 and just went back last night. For 2 years, I used to live in LA where I was exposed to their amazing Thai town and community with excellent access to Thai food. Just to put this out there, Thai food in LA is a whole 'nother beast that cannot be compared in the same league as any other Thai food (such as in SF). Now that I've returned to SF and had my first Thai craving, I'd have to say that Lers Ros did satisfy my hunger. \n\nBetween my bf and I, we ordered originally 3 dishes, but then added on the 4th when we realized that the dishes were on the smaller side (ugh). But in the end, we were glad that we ordered all 4 because we did really want to try a little of everything.\n\n1) Pad Thai w/ Shrimp - this restaurant is able to execute the dish very well. The gravy with the noodles is on point here - they provide a lot of gravy, which goes great with the soft noodles. Nothing is worse than Pad Thai with no gravy, so it's dry...yucks. But this place does it well. I wasn't a huge fan of the shrimp though. Perhaps if they used the jumbo shrimp it would've turned out better.\n\n2) Eggplant with tofu - Great dish! This dish might convince you to become a vegetarian. It's super spicy but so delicious. It has the red bell peppers, red chili peppers, basil, eggplant and large squares of tofu. YUM.\n\n3) Green curry - decent dish. My bf and I were deciding between the green and red curry, and wanted the spicier one - and the waitress said green curry. To be honest, it wasn't spicy at all, maybe mild if anything lol. But it was pretty good. \n\n4) Garlic shrimp - pretty good, but nothing like what I've had in LA. The shrimps were that same medium size that they used in the pad thai, and I wish they were the jumbo ones. Also, it would have helped if the shrimps were deep fried too (well, when would that never help? lol)\n\nIf you are big rice eaters like my bf and I, you'll have to order an additional rice, which has never really happened to us at a Thai restaurant before. Usually they give you that large silver rice bowl which has at least 5 bowls of rice, but the silver bowl they gave us only gave us maybe 2, so we had to order more. \n\nService was excellent. Really loved our waitress who was very sweet and smily. I'd definitely come back here if I had my Thai craving again. Probably the best Thai food in SF.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

It's only a few walking blocks away from the theater, however when we got out of the restaurant around 11pm on a Tuesday night walking the streets is unsafe if you are going alone. Lots of pan handlers, drugees, and other fiends out.\n\nI tried the Alligator dish, coconut drink, and a shot of cold sake, which was around $30+ right there. Our party of 4 bill was $92 + I  left a $20 cash tip. \n\nThe Alligator meat was a little tough and chewy. I thought the way they served me was kind of weird. We all had empty plate settings on the table, but they gave us our entre dishes on separate plates as well. The rice was in a giant metal container and the waitress served me with a serving spoonful on the empty plate. She also put the rice metal container next to my friends dish, so I had no clue that was for me. Lol\n\nThey have a few dishes I'd probably go back to check out: frog chunks (which doesn't really sound appealing), rabbit, and a boar dish.\n\nI thought it was weird near the end, this guy asked us if we wanted our water refilled, 3 of us said yes, but he only filled one cup. \n\nI most likely won't be coming back to this place again. I'd rather find another place that has exotic dishes to go to. \n\nIf I had to recommend coming here, I'd tell friends to only go there earlier and not later at night although they open until midnight, if they're going for the food. \n\nThis place is great for drinks though. They have noodle items around $15, they have tofu noodle dishes for Vegetarians, the Alligator dish I had was $23, which I thought was reasonable. So to sum, I'd go back here for the drinks.

I highly recommend considering Lers Ros for your next event. \n\nThank you again to the Lers Ros team for ensuring that everything went without a hitch, for feeding us so deliciously, and for being so easy to work with!", "author": "Sonja L."}

Had to only wait for about 15 minutes or so at a party of 3. Place was what you call fine dining compared to most Thai restaurants I've been to. \n\nThis place was definitely more upscale, which made the experience more enjoyable if you wanted to have an intimate conversation with your date. You don't really have to worry about the entire restaurant hearing your conversation due to the noise level. \n\nWe ordered the Thai Iced Tea, which came out sweet and delicious. We decided to do family style so we ordered a couple dishes so that way everyone can share. \n\nThe Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew were both really amazing. Each dish had an enjoyable flavor to it that Gabe uniqueness to the dish. I kind of wished instead of saying medium, get something with a bit more heat. \n\nWe also ordered the Kang Karee, which had an extremely flavorful Coconut Milk curry flavor to it that makes me want to drink the whole dish. I don't normally eat curry but this dish was one of the best I've had. \n\nI highly recommend this place if you're craving true authentic Thai food, be prepared to pay the price but it's definitely worth it!", "author": "John L."}

I love Thai food yet also think it is one of the most overdone cuisines with the majority of Thai restaurants being forgettable and also blueprints of each other in terms of menu and flavor.  \n\nThere have been some standouts.  I've long loved Marnee Thai when I lived in SF and I also loved King of Thai's more street food like take on fried rice plates and soup noodles that you rarely see at more mainstream Thai restaurants.  \n\nI've also been burned by a couple of critically acclaimed spots, most memorable Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas that boasted unusual flavors and unique dishes that were quite different from every Thai restaurant but that I simply did not like and found mediocre.  \n\nEnter Ler Ros.  With dishes like their famous pork belly and duck larb salad as well as their more exotic fare of alligator, frogs, and fresh deep fried fish, I knew I'd likely have a very unique meal.  I ordered a sampling of all their popular items and if I had more time, I'd likely have sampled even more from their impressive 100+ item menu.  \n\n#9 - Koo Moo Yang - Smoked Pork Shouder Appetizer.  Rich and fatty and perfect to dip in the tangy and savory sauce.  It's a great appetizer, but like many of the dishes decadent.  I definitely should have ordered plain white rice or soup noodles to counteract all my rich dishes.\n\n#25 Duck Larb Salad - 7x7 Magazine's famous item and worthy of the hype.  I've tried Larb Salad at Champa Garden and while it was tasty, I didn't love it.  The roast duck here is so good and there are so many herbs, onions, and spices, that it's easy to see why this is a hit.  It's a flavor explosion.\n\n#37 Roasted Duck Red Curry - this is a more mainstream item and I wanted to see how flavorful their curries were.  It was excellent.  Lots of depth and a slight tinge of heat with the medium spicy version.  Great with white rice and with lots of vegetables to balance the fatty duck.\n\n#54 Kao Pad - Fried Rice with Crab Meat.  I love this dish at King of Thai and it's similar here. Nice wok heat.  Lots of crab meat.  A touch oily but order some white rice and you'll have better balance. \n\n#62 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob - another must order from most people.  It's crispy pork belly (or Chinese roasted pork) stir fried with herbs including basil.  The sauce is delicious. The pork pieces are super fatty and delicious.  You'll gain a million calories but it's definitely worth ordering once you're here.\n\n#76 - Pad Kee Mow - I usually order Pad See Ew or Pad Thai, but most recommend to try this noodle dish instead.  It's a touch spicy and more flavorful and salty than the other milder dishes.  Overall, good but not as strong as their notable items.  \n\nPluses from Ler Ros is that they have free delivery over $25 and within 2 miles of their locations and it comes all nicely packaged and hot.  \n\nOverall, I loved my meal here and while there is a lot of fatty, fried, and oily items, I think eating in house I'd order more soups or white rice to balance all the amazing flavors.  But the hype fit the bill and I'm glad to have added Ler Ros to my repertoire.  \n\nLer Ros accepts credit cards, including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

I was in town visiting with my husband and we made it a point to come here for an early-ish dinner after a day of walking. We arrived around 6:30 and probably waited around 20 mins (not bad at all). Now the neighborhood is absolutely sketchy, but being a previous resident I was fully prepared. My guests, on the other hand, were traumatized.\n\nThis place has a lot of exotic meat such as alligator, quail, frog legs, etc which i have tried in the past but this time we had a finicky 13 year old with us so we laid off the unfamiliar.\n\nWe ordered a beef pad see ew, seafood Tom Yum soup ( it was 60 degrees outside), fish cakes, and a whole fried tilapia in chili sauce with a side of brown rice. Everything was amazing as usual, but i guess the server didn't put in our request for the spice level on the fish entree as it was mild mild mild. Also, the only downside to the meal was that the soup was very overpriced for the measly portion and it arrived with coconut cream mixed in, which wasn't mentioned on the menu. The mister has a strong distaste for anything coconut so we had to send it back. But seriously, $15 for a medium sized bowl of soup is a bit much. \n\nIn any case, this will remain an all-time, albeit expensive, thai spot whenever I visit my old hood.", "author": "R H."}

I made reservations for 3 on a Sunday night around 8PM. Thank goodness I thought ahead! The place was jammed packed with people waiting around for tables to open up.  We were seated around 5-10 minutes after our reservation time. \n\nThe menu is pretty extensive - so much to choose from and they all sounded and looked (from Yelp pictures) amazing. We decided to order family style and share 3 dishes - the papaya salad (medium spice level), crispy pork belly, fried trout. \nAll three dishes were outstanding! The papaya salad and crisp and fresh with just the right amount of heat. I'm glad we didn't choose my normal Thai spicy because the medium definitely had me sweating. The pork belly was very well executed. Great flavors and tender meat with the crispy skin. Good size portion as well for the three of us. The trout was fried to perfection and served with a delicious spicy vinegar sauce. \n\nService was quick and straight to the point.  The space is small and simple, but the food is far from that.

I should have known to take O'Farrell or Market, but noooooo, I walked straight through the (fragrant and colorful) heart of the Tenderloin. What a noob.\n\nMy #17 pork salad came with plenty of untrimmed sliced pork (complete with chewy tendon and a layer of fat), scallions and onion on a leaf of lettuce, with a wedge of cabbage on the side. My place setting came with a fork and spoon, so I wasn't really sure how to eat the cabbage. Let's just say it wasn't pretty, to be polite, but my friend didn't seem to care about my lack of daintiness. \n\nMy friend's Pad Thai with prawns was yummy. Carbs and sugary sauce.

The noodles had a good bite. \n\nOverall, a decent not overly-Americanized Thai lunch option at an affordable price.

He said he liked it. The crab fried rice had a lot of crab in it, which was good, but the garlic flavor just over powered the entire plate. It was aright, could have gone without it. The pad Thai was really good though, even though I think the chicken would have tasted better than the beef. \n\nThe seating here is where I am giving them less stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-13", "description": "I have been coming here ever since this was the only Lers Ros location -- before all the hype from SF's 7x7 magazine, before it was even on the map for what it has morphed into today: overpriced hipster Thai food. Let me take you back when this was my go-to Thai place that served up the most amazing Thai-style street food. Having been to Thailand and also being able to speak the language fluently and raised in this culture, I know my Thai food. The food was always consistent with the perfect balance of flavors that highlight the spicy, salty, sweet, and sour that is so characteristic of Thailand's cuisine. \n\nNow, fast forward to the new Lers Ros where it has expanded into the more chic neighborhoods (think Hayes Valley) and gotten lauded by more than one major foodie publications. I get that food prices have increased, and I do not mind paying good money for great food, but I do take issue with paying good money for not-so-great food. \n\nFood: We ordered a smorgasbord of the usual just to see if it would meet our earlier expectations, and I have to say that while I love that extra bit of sour in my dishes, I felt that the chef was having one hell of a day because it was as if she dumped the whole pint of lime juice into the majority of our dishes. You really had to wince as you took each bite, and the funny thing was that the heavy-handed sourness was apparent in nearly all the dishes we ordered. \n\nAppetizers/Salad:\n- Some Tum Koong (Papaya salad with grilled shrimp) - Spicy, but too sour.\n- Koh Moo Yang (Grilled pork shoulder) - Pork was tender, but the portion was definitely not commensurate with the price tag. Also, the chili dipping sauce was way too sour.\n- Larb Phed Yang (Roasted duck salad larb) - Normally, this is my FAVORITE dish on the menu (partially bc this dish essentially put them on the map), but dang, they plucked and squeezed all the limes from one tree into this dish so I could barely eat it.\n\nSoup:\n- Tom Kha Gai (Coconut chicken soup) - Again, way too sour. Normally, the flavors are balanced and I love how they serve it in a fire pot and sprinkle some chili oil on top. \n\nEntrees:\n- Pad See-Ew (Flat Noodle Chow Fun) - This was the ONLY dish that was well balanced and perfectly charred. We actually took this dish home because we loved it so much.\n- Pad Ka-na Moo Krob (Crispy fried 3-layer pork belly with Chinese gailan) - This dish was way too salty as it was prepared that day. Normally, it's also one of the best things on the menu for me since the pork is nice and crispy and the gailan is so fresh. Also, you can ask them to top it with a fried sunny side up egg for the authentic experience.\n\nPrice vs. Value: Our bill came up to $100+ (with tax & tip) for lunch, and it appears that everything on their menu is pegged at an average price point of close to $12. Times have definitely changed; I just wished the consistency of the food had not done the same. If you want to try it for yourself, be my guest. Just don't complain if you have to blink a few times as you take a bite. And then, once more when your bill comes out.\n\nService: The service is great. Very prompt and attentive and I have to give it to Lers Ros for not changing this aspect of their business.", "author": "Chan K."}

My dining companion and I arrived for lunch as they opened and ordered the papaya salad (som tum) with raw crab,  duck curry, and a dry noodle dish called Lek Tom Yum Haeng--and there wasn't a single dish that wasn't amazing. The papaya salad was nicely spiced and the funky aroma of the raw crab was a great complement. The duck curry was delicious and full of unusual vegetables (though the duck was a little bit fatty for my taste), and the noodle dish came with the most delicious, crispy (and not overly fatty!) pork belly I've ever had.

We got waters. Some people in our group got hot water. They put the hot water also in their glass cups. It wasn't a problem, but the lady kept on saying we can put it in a different cup so it's not too hot. We said it was ok. Also, she totally forgot my cup of cold water. Everyone else got water and I was like... Where's mine? When we ordered our food I requested another cup for water. The prices are pretty high and the food was ok. The food came out pretty fast. I was expecting better quality of food and a bigger portion for the price and especially in San Francisco. The dishes were really small. You pay $17 for a noodle dish compared to elsewhere 10-12 dollars and it feeds more people. At the end of our meal since no one was coming in we stayed and chatted.

Lers Ros USES FISH SAUCE in their \"VEGETARIAN\" pad thai noodles and ALL of their curries, and cannot be replaced because the sauces are pre-made.\n\nThis is FALSE ADVERTISING and extremely misleading for those who want to avoid eating meat.\n\nI was shocked that the lady I spoke to over the phone said that other customers are ok with fish sauce in their vegetarian food. If they eat fish, they are NOT VEGETARIAN. And besides, it's not like she was the one who offered the information - I was the one who had to ask about whether or not they use shrimp paste and fish sauce in their vegetarian food (some Thai/Asian restaurants do). \n\nA mistake on labeling is one thing, but to know that the food contains animal product and blatantly misleading customers into thinking otherwise is NOT OK.\n\nONE STAR FOR THE REMAINING FOOD like Pad See Ew made vegetarian to order.

Overall, I would say that the food is probably a 3.5 stars.  There are some good choices, so just stick with those.    It does pack a lot of flavor and a lot of spicy.  Beware that some of the dishes are spicier than most other Thai restaurants.   If you do find yourself at the restaurant, here are the noteworthy dishes: \nOrder:\n- Spare ribs were awesome.  Flavorful and wonderful\n- Get the combo platter with the chicken & papaya salad\n- Get the mango sticky rice for dessert.  A perfect ending to the meal.  \nPass:\n- Pork and green beans only if you like something with a hint of sweet\n- The seafood soup was super spicy.  I could barely taste the flavor of the seafood and broth.\n- Pad see ew was ok.  Love the salty duck egg.  \n\nDetails:\nThis place has quite the decor. You will find many food quotes on the walls in the restaurant.  The restaurant's name is also pretty clever too.  They also take reservations if you want to. When things I don't like about the restaurant is at the bar takes up way too much space. You can't fit a lot of seats at the bar.  Though it's nice that they do serve alcohol at this restaurant.  I see a lot of people ordering their wines with the meal.  \n\nThe food:\n- Spare ribs were delectable.  Very flavorful and juicy.  All the spices just melts in your mouth.  \n- The pork and green beans seems really plain.  It was also too sweet for my taste.  At least the beans weren't limpy.  \n- They really overpowered the peanut sauce on the beef with peanut sauce dish.  It was really sweet and the sauce was a weird consistency as well. I wished the beef was a bit more tender.  However it's not too bad when they drench the dish with the sauce.  \n- I was a bit disappointed in the seafood soup.  I always enjoy a nice bowl of Thai restaurants' tangy seafood soup.  I felt that Lers Ros' could've added more flavors & spices to the soup.  They overpowered the spiciness, but the different spices themselves didn't absorb in the soup.  I also noticed that a couple of the clams didn't open up in the soup as well.  \n- I definitely enjoyed the combo platter.  The chicken in there was amazing.  Super tender and juicy.  It melted in my mouth.  The papaya salad was also better than most Thai restaurants.  Their sticky was awesome amazing.  100x better than the regular rice.  I would just order this as a meal by itself.  \n- The pad see ew was only ok.  I enjoyed the salty egg in the dish more than the actual pad see ew itself.  It tasted pretty bland.  I've had better\n- The mango sticky rice was awesome.  The mango itself was amazing.  So juicy and soft.  The sticky rice wasn't that sweet either.  It was a softer consistency than some of the other places I've had, but I actually like this more.  \n\nOne thing I do like about this restaurant is that it takes multiple credit cards.", "author": "Shirley C."}

I went to a Michelin starred Thai restaurant a few days ago before Lers Ros Thai and I thought this restaurant was WAY better! Also, after ordering 5 dishes, total was only ~$25 per person. Portions were generous and more importantly, damn delicious!\n\nAlso... you'll probably have the most flavorful SALAD of your life here. The papaya salad was sooo amazing, I'd come back for that. Even my boyfriend, who acts like a kid and still doesn't eat vegetables, really liked it. It's very spicy though, so be careful! \n\nAnyway, more about the restaurant... this place is constantly packed. We ate a late dinner at 9pm, and we saw people still coming in at 11:30pm! It also gets super warm inside, probably because of those soups and pots of food on top of fire (I was sweating...). The chairs there also don't have a backrest so you can't really put your coat anywhere. Service here was okay -- we were pretty much ignored the whole time.\n\nOnto the food...\n- Papaya salad: a must. I'd say it's the best papaya salad I've ever had. Even better than the one I had in Thailand!\n- Pad thai: solid and delicious! Wish they could've put more shrimp in it...\n- Fried rabbit: not a super huge fan, but everyone else really liked this. Especially the men. The meat didn't taste or looked fried at all. Hopefully that meant it's not too fattening.\n- Green curry: I LOVE green curry. So I might be biased, but I thought it was awesome, flavorful, and generous in size. Yum!\n- Pork shoulder: a must order appetizer. All 4 of us were fighting for the last piece!\n\nI'm totally coming back here! The menu is overwhelming and I can't wait to try the rest of the dishes. I'm seeing here on Yelp that delivery is free?!

The Pork shoulder appetizer. It is pure orgasm in your mouth good. The taste is just amazing, and the chili sauce it comes with it amazing, too. So please, if you're able to eat pork, try it. Could I be hyping it up too much? No. I brought a friend here to try once after giving the same pitch about the pork shoulder and she also fell in love with it.\n\nAnyway, besides that the food is delicious. Compared to other thai restaurants, they have got it down. The Pad See Ew and Pad Thai are my baseline comparisons. You can't really go wrong with it, but they have really got these dishes figured out. 5 spices duck + rice. Also great. However, I would not recommend getting the Rad Na unless they go easy on the sauce and give you more food. Too much sauce and not enough actual food.\n\nThe desserts are also amazing! Mango sticky rice etc... yum! The hot tea is also delicious, very sweet taste to it.\n\nApart from that, the staff is super friendly and nice.

I don't know about anybody else, but this is in my top five of cuisine revelations. The Chef Recommends something like twenty items -- off the list I know I have to come back and try Pad Cha Rockfish Fillet, Steamed Seabass with Lemongrass & Lime, Stir-Fried Pork Belly with Basil, Thai Herb Sausage, Garlic Quail and Pad Phed Alligator. Because I'm the adventurous type, that's why. \n\nProblem is I already got a number one:\n\nHouse Special LEK TOM YUM HAENG -- Steamed skinny rice noodles with ground pork, sliced fish cake, crispy pork belly, and dry tom yum noodle (tastes like crushed peanuts, it adds an elegant crunch to each bite). I love noodle squishiness, I love spongy fish cake, I love ground pork quaintly fiery, I love pork belly tamed fatty with that crispy-scorched outside. You put all those element together, and you have enchantment. Funny how there's not a lot of reviews that mention this dish, so I'm glad it's in mine. We discovered it by accident (\"Let's try something new!\" and so we chose randomly). It's a problem, if you were wondering, only because it's gonna be a must-order dish every time I come in now, pushing everything else to second priority.\n\nI have had several other dishes. I don't need to get all blustery about what else is good. This is first-class Thai, everything is excellent. But sure, any coconut soup or lemongrass fish or ground pork or prawns with specialty sides is going to be magnificent.

It might be the best I've found thus far.\nTheir Khao Moo yang is off the chain though. I mean this dish is a Mike Tyson uppercut to the jaw knock out taste. This is probably the best dish I've had from them. Beautifully cooked pork shoulder lightly coated with lime and mixed with chilli, green onions, thai basil, and so on. This took me back to some of my favorite culinary spots in Bangkok, Amphawa, and Cha'Am. \nHeck even the Thai Iced Tea \"Chai Yen\" is great. It's not too sweet, but just sweet enough. They give a good amount of it and it's not ridiculously expensive either.\nAlso the sticky rice with Durian is friken insane. It's absolutely delicious. If you try it and you don't like it you need to scrape the taste buds out of your mouth and find some new ones because this ish is crazy good.  \n\nNow, because I'm a bit picky I have a few gripes & suggestions. \nThe staff can be a bit cold. They need to work on their people skills a bit.\n\nAlso, for effect, I wish they played more, if not all Thai music. Stream some Green Wave online and it's all good.

When we first ordered it, our server warned us - \"this thing is stinky and spicy\" - it sounded like a challenge! It was awesome, and went well with our other things we ordered as well.\n\nMy only complaints are that their chairs don't have backs to them and the waitstaff seems a little young. When I was taking my friends over for the first time, excitedly explaining how tasty the food was, my friend asked, \"Are the chairs comfortable?\" and I had to say that they were not. My friend felt the chairs were fine when we got there, but they don't have backs to them and are just simple wooden stools really. It's unfortunate b/c it's great to be able to relax at a restaurant, but I guess the little stools mean more people can fit in the restaurant.\n\nAnd the waitstaff looks young. My partner noticed it, and its hard not to.

We were approached by intoxicated individuals even in broad daylight. Despite that,  the inside of the restaurant is relatively nice and you forget the outside atmosphere. There are both regular seating options and traditional, where you sit at a long connected table alongside other patrons. If you order more than 3 dishes, this may get a bit tight and you'll have to adjust so that your dishes dont get on to the other table. Inside: 3 stars, outside: 0?\n\nAppetizers: We started with the curry puffs which is like a puff pastry samosa with a satay style curry sauce to match. It was hot, fresh, and had a nice flavor. Next we ordered the tom yum soup with vegetables. The presentation was great; it comes in a simmering hot pot with a fire underneath and literally was boiling! Great for cooler weather. My only critique would be that the soup was a bit too lemony/sour, even for a dish that is supposed to have a lemon grass and lime flavor profile traditionally. 3.5 stars\n\nMain course: We had the prawn pad Thai which was better than average, with fresh shrimp, but once again I felt that one flavor overwhelmed the rest -this time it was too sweet. I think if the sweetness was less, I would have enjoyed it much more. But overall it was fair. Others in the party had the basil chicken and also thought it was fair, not amazing. 3 stars\n\nOverall it was a good experience, better than most, but imo the flavors could be improved.", "author": "Sara A."}

Double or triple check with the kitchen before you order.\n\nAs a Thai fiend, I don't know why it took me so long to finally try out Lers Ros seeing as I often see it on many \"best of\" lists. Thai food had long been my favorite until recently being displaced by Vietnamese. Lers Ros is trying to win me back.\n\nSince Thai Idea was closed, we ended up here for an Independence Day meal. At first I was disappointed I didn't get to take my babygirl to try  the Vegan goodness of Thai Idea for her first time. But then we tasted the food at Lers Ros...\n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable and the interior is a lot nicer than the gritty TL neighborhood location would suggest. I don't feel like I have to worry about fish sauce in the \"vegetarian\" dishes as you sometimes do with lesser Thai places that use a pre-made curry paste. These reasons alone would place Lers Ros high on my list. Oh but the food...\n\nThe Pad Thai came out perfect and looked every bit as good as it tasted. I rarely order Pad Thai anymore and I don't know why. This dish brought me back to why I love Thai food. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lers-ros-thai-san-francisco?select=Mv5EeBsxgZ0qhZEzpdraxg#Df-wQc6TCbYViX31yu_Ang\n\nI usually judge Thai restaurants on their Green Curry since it's my favorite thing on the menu. Lers Ros' version did not let me down. At first I thought the color was a bit off and more brown than green. Then my girl fed me the first bite and I realized the only thing that was off was my eyeballs... I can say Lers Ros green curry is the best in SF! While it was a bit thin at first glance, the flavor more than backed up Lers Ros street cred as best Thai restaurant in town. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lers-ros-thai-san-francisco?select=Mv5EeBsxgZ0qhZEzpdraxg#AjoWkVxZshlN3os_c3omLw\n\nWe chose to end our substantial meal with an order of mango with sticky rice. Not because we were so much hungry, as rather we wanted to try more food to make sure we didn't miss anything. Especially since we didn't know when we would get another chance to come here. Maybe not the wisest move, yet I managed to stuff the majority of that sweet, cocnutty rice and mango down the hatch before I succumbed to the effects of all that I just ate. Totally worth it!\n\nThe only downside is it can get pretty packed thanks to its popularity. Fortunately if you manage to score a table, the small army of waitresses should be able to handle the entire room with little trouble. I believe I counted ten of them for such a small space. I guess they're ready to handle the responsibility that comes with being #1. Yes, even better than my beloved Thai Idea.", "author": "John B."}

I love Thai's take on fried rice. They like to add different kinds of flavors into the mix to keep things interesting.

It overwhelmed my palette and told me never to go back again.  The chicken was nothing special and I now know that I don't like sticky rice.  It's too too sticky for me.\n! - Pad Thai - 7x7 magazine said this is the finest pad thai I would ever eat.  Ding dong...nope.  Had better.  I mean, it taste decent, it wasn't bad but it didn't give out that smokey flavor that the article mentioned, which disappointed me to the core.  \n! - Hot tea - they charged a $1.50 for watered down tea.  I've recently turned into a tea snob and have been noticing the teas that are served at every restaurant are not up to my standards.  Including this one.  I wish I can bring my own tea leaves and just order hot water instead.  I guess I'm mad because they charged $1.50 when it should be free instead.  \n\nWe got here at 5:30pm on a Saturday, so, we got a seat within 5 minutes.

It's a big piece with thin slices; some are lean and some have a 1 cm of fat attached.  I wouldn't expect a tender piece of meat but something that's more smokey and almost veering towards jerky (although not quite).  They really know how to work their sauces here because it was a great balance and not as tart as the salad.\n\nPork belly was a dish I couldn't find on the online menu but on the physical menu at the restaurant, it's number 60-something.  I would say this was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  The pork was roasted Chinese style with an uber crispy skin.  Again, some pieces were tougher than others but I'm thinking that's just how they do things here.  Don't expect the succulent, braised juicy pork belly with the glistening fat you're used to seeing; this is a more raw, homemade version.  Medium spiciness is a good level because you get the spice but that's not all you're thinking about.  Unlike the previous two dishes I mentioned, which were more appetizers, this dish is saucy and goes well with rice.\n\nPla Rad Prik (whole fried tilapia) surprised me that it was on the house specials list. Given that they do not make it generic with bottled chili sauce like other Thai restaurants, it does start tasting similar so I might have scratched this out to get a curry or soup for next time.  Website claims that fresh fish is guaranteed each day but it's hard to tell because it's fried to very well done and I couldn't distinguish the flaky texture of typical fresh fish.\n\nRad Nah (house secret gravy sauce with marinated pork and flat noodle) was another regret.  We wanted a noodle dish to fill us up and balance out the other dishes but this was more of a gravy entree with a small chunk of noodles, lots of veggies, and marinated pork.  Pork seems to be the theme of the night also so by this dish, I was porked out.  BUT...if you're craving rad nah, the gravy is pretty solid and goes well over your rice.\n\nPlaces like these shame generic Thai restaurants.  Like a Chinese person craving Panda Express, I suppose there will be moments where I'll just want a pad thai and the closest joint is good enough for that.  Lers Ros is definitely a special place though and I would gladly take anyone who claims they like Thai food.  We'll see what they know!  Also, service is fantastic.  Hostess joked with us and the server was cute as a button.  Our waters were refilled over 5 times that night!", "author": "Shannon L."}

Nonetheless, the food is AMAZING!  The duck in the duck larb salad isn't greasy at all, and the lime dressing gives the perfect contrast to the salty & fatty flavor of the duck.  The pork belly was tantalizing and yes...still hot even though we requested mild, but I do like my spicy (spicy enough) food.  The yellow curry & the tofu with veggies were pretty good too, but the stars of this meal were of course the guilty pleasures of the fatty pork belly & their highly regarded duck larb salad.

With that said, I have no issue with going to restaurants that look like a dump but have great food.  In the case of Lers Ros Thai you will get the best of both worlds, great food in a modern CLEAN restaurant setting.\n\nOnly one simple recommendation.  Stay away from the basic Pad Thai dishes.  Not that they are aren't good, but this is a place where you want to experience real Thai food. Pick from their \"Specialties\" menu and you won't be disappointed, plus you may run across a flavor you have never experienced before.", "author": "Jim G."}

I was very excited to dine here and was looking forward to tasting the house specials. \n\nThe food was great and the menu did not disappoint.\n\nPapaya salad was delicious and very flavorful. The fish sauce was prominent but in a pleasant way. My \"mild\" spice level salad was quiet spicy (which I suspected would be the case and glad I asked for mild). Too bad that the generic tomatoes were used instead of the cherry or grape. The other two dishes - alligator and venison in light coconut curry had more than a kick. The alligator was so good that I almost ordered another. And for desert, of course, it was mango sticky rice. The rice was a bit al dente but still succulent. \n\nI usually don't care too much about the service (unless it's (amazing or bluntly shitty) but today's service was worth writing about. I don't even know where to start except from its core definition - dysfunctional. When we arrived, there was a substantial line outside. We came inside to put our names on the list. It only took 5 minutes. The running sting waiters seem to be too busy to pay attention to us. Then we tried to ask whether we could sit by the bar and the waitress would run by us with \"just a moment please.\" She did that 4 times. I started to feel amused . 20 minutes later we received an invitation to sit by the bar (that was empty during this time) and a long explanation of some imaginary process. Ok...busy night, no problem. We ordered our food. 30+ minutes later, we received our appetizer. Then a relatively short wait to the main course. During the meal, we asked for water and beer. The beer was served quickly but I had to ask for water 3 times, despite that it was already poured and waiting to be given to a certain individual (at that point) dying of thirst. And then, I had nerve to ask about ones. A blank look later, I gave up. \n\n\nTips:\n\n1. Do not come here if in a hurry and in any case, make sure to bring a healthy dose of patience. The service is utterly dysfunctional - slow, confused and disorganized. \n\n2. It's pretty spicy. The mild (as in my papaya salad) means at least medium. \n\n3.

The defaults are defaults, because, well, they're pretty damn good: the papaya salad is nice and refreshing, yet with a fairly strong kick to it; the pad thai and crab fried rice, while being fairly typical dishes, are done very well, with the pad thai not made as sweet as at many a Thai restaurant; and the pork belly is simply awesome delicious.\n\nOther dishes I've tried, and recall, include their tom yum soup (also quite good), their sweet and sour chicken, and their fried tofu, both of which were a bit lackluster in comparison.\n\nTheir free delivery within SF is certainly a huge plus, usually delivered within 45 minutes to an hour after you call in. And if it tastes this good delivered, it can only be better in person right? RIght - especially for things like the pork belly and tofu, where their crispy skins suffer from being steamed in the take-out boxes. So, if you can, go in person.

A lot of other yelpers have said that the pork belly was delicious, but my friend and I have definitely have had better pork belly from other places. The pork belly, or I should say pork rinds, because that's what they were basically, were resting on a pool of salty oil. The bell peppers were my favorite part of that particular dish.\n\nThe waitresses are very friendly and very attentive despite the fact that I could barely hear my friend in conversation.

The waitress didn't reach us for about 10 minutes after we sat down and my husband's food came about 10 minutes before mine arrived. It's a bit awkward to receive your food after your husband is already halfway finished his own dish. \n\nOverall, great atmosphere and great food for the price.", "author": "Joyce P."}

The food was quite good. My husband and I shared the vegetarian yellow curry and an eggplant tofu dish (both a la carte) with brown rice and sticky rice. The curry was smaller than we were expecting. The eggplant dish was quite spicy. Overall, we liked both dishes. \n\nThe big complaint I have is that there were a lot of dishes listed in the vegetarian section of the menu that had fish sauce... For example, the yellow curry was the only one of three curries listed that could be made without fish sauce. This was misleading and had us changing our choices on the spot. Please list the details on the menu or don't put it under the vegetarian menu!!!!\n\nOtherwise, I would have given it four stars. Service was polite and food pretty good.", "author": "S S."}

I had come here with my family on a busy Friday night. We had called in and placed a reservation an hour ahead and had no issues getting a table at 7:30. The service was friendly and food came out promptly. We had ordered the green papaya salad with shrimp (som Tom koong yang ) and Tom kha Kai vegetarian which were both a delight. Watch out for the spice level on the salad. The medium spicy was quite fiery! Their standards are probably straight from Bangkok. The soup was wonderful with the oyster mushrooms. As for the dishes we had the red curry vegetarian , garlic chili basil eggplant with tofu, BBQ Thai chicken , and pad thai. All were made to perfection. This place has the best pad thai I've tried thus far. Absolutely divine. \nOh and did I say we had dessert? \n\n\nMmmmm yesss we had the mango sticky rice of course.

Nothing fancy; no white table cloth or anything like that.\n\nThey have a large menu. Personally, I'm not a fan of restaurants with over 100 menu options. Seems a bit excessive to me. I ordered the #93 ( stir-fried beef, bell peppers, onions, garlic, and basil chili sauce). It was a generous serving. And I ordered a side of brown rice to go with it. But to be perfectly honest, the spiciness of the sauce overpowered everything. And they certainly didn't skimp out on the garlic. Thank God I didn't have a date that night.\n: )\n\nMy co-workers ordered Pad Thai (which looked good), spring rolls, and a Tom Yum soup (beautifully presented, but rather bland in flavor).\n\nThe service was fine. The waitress kept refilling my water glass every five minutes (she must have known how spicy my dish was). \n\nAll in all, Lers Ros Thai is a decent lunch option in the Loin. It's not as Americanized-Thai as Osha, but it still delivers stellar food at a reasonable price. But unless you're in the neighborhood, I wouldn't venture out here for a meal.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Cooked in a delicious sauce that can be perfectly enjoyed drizzled over white rice. \n\nPork shoulder - this one stole the show for me.  The pork shoulder was thinly sliced and grilled, where you can taste the char.  It's served with a spectacular dipping sauce. I think I could eat this one all by myself but I decided to share.  Sharing is caring right? That way I can still have room to sample the other delicious dishes. \n\nDuck larb - this came in a close second.  I love larb and I love duck.

The other half sat there and waited at least another 30-40 mins for our food, while everyone else finished eating. Always an awkward situation. \n\nWe asked at least 4 passing waiters/waitresses to check on our order, but most of them just dismissed us, if not straight up ignored us. \n\nFood was decent, but the horrible service already left a bad taste. I ordered my usual, the kha moo (pork leg stew), which was good but the meat to rice ratio was poor and the egg was overcooked.\n\nMy recommendation: avoid this location and go to the Mission or Hayes ones - no wait, better service, and just as good food.", "author": "Vivian H."}

This mean that for the weak of spice, you may be a bit overwhelmed, so order accordingly (stay away from papaya salad!).\n\nThe service was good.

I like it because they give it to you in a pretty big glass and it's authentic Thai tea so it's flavorful and awesome.\n\nThe salt & pepper rabbit was okay. I've never had rabbit before so I can't compare but...not sure if that rabbit we had was not meaty enough or if rabbits are just always really bony. It got really irritating to eat it with so many bones and not too much meat. The way it was cooked wasn't especially exciting. Just fried and seasoned with salt & pepper. By itself, it was kind of dry but it went well with the sweet and spicy sauce. I expected something better (or more) for the price. \n\nThe duck larb was by far my favorite dish. They give you a good amount of duck pieces in the entire salad and it's flavored really well with tons of lime and hints of green onions. There were bits of cilantro everywhere which is a plus for me. Definitely the best larb dish I've ever had. \n\nOverall, great restaurant but some items on the menu are hit or miss.", "author": "Sofia R."}

However, upon entering the facility, I realized I made reservations for one instead of 2. The host was extremely helpful and sat us down within 3 minutes upon arrival. Not only that, but the host (male, didn't get his name) was able to accommodate other couples (walk-ins) in a speedy fashion. I haven't been to many restaurants that are as flexible and accommodating as this one. Don't speak Thai? No problem, the restaurant has #'s next to each dish.  Be prepared to sit next to complete strangers at this establishment. The long tables in the center of the restaurant are 3-4 tables joined together. So while you and your party will be at one of those tables, it is possible that someone else from a different party will be sitting next to you. I will say that most of the restaurants we visited during our stay in SF had close seating with limited privacy tables. I enjoyed making friends at each restaurant, but if compact spaces are not your thing, you may want to ask to sit at the bar which has seating for 4. I knew from the previous reviews to order the #12 Som Tom Poo, papaya salad with raw crab. The crab is raw and does come in it's shell, but if you are used to eating sushi, then order this dish. The flavor combos are surreal. I tasted ginger, soy sauce, fish sauce, chili pepper, and possibly lemongrass. My mouth is salivating as I type. The salad is on the spicy side, most likely a 5/10 on the hot scale. Don't fret if spicy is not your thing, they give complimentary water and with as many refills as necessary. The menu features 80 options but is organized in a way that doesn't give anyone an anxiety attack. I recommend viewing the menu ahead of time to get a consensus of what you may order to save time. The wait staff is very helpful in answering any questions so feel free to ask away. I ordered the #34, yellow curry with prawns and my husband ordered #35, beef red curry. We both ordered hot. We probably should have ordered Thai hot because it was not that hot, but the depth of flavor was on point. The yellow curry had almost a sweet taste to it which was delicious. Vegans and Vegetarians: there are menu options for you and if you don't see something or want a dish without meat, they can do that for you, just ask. If we ever visit San Francisco again, we will be sure to come back. Hopefully we will save room for dessert next time ;).\n\nPrice 5*\nTaste 5*\nService 6* (accommodations)\nAtmosphere 5*\nOptions 5*", "author": "Kristina Nichole D."}

We came on a Friday night not really knowing what to expect, and knowing that they don't take reservations.  When we got there, we were cramped into the doorway waiting to put our name down.  After waiting about 30 minutes, we were finally seated in the front corner of the restaurant, which was actually kind of nice since it was away from all of the big groups of people there.  Anyway, after sitting down and having had a long time to peruse the menu, we decided on the following dishes to share:\n\n-Nuer Yang (Broiled top sirloin beef, sliced and served with lime juice): One my favorite dishes at Thai restaurants, and this certainly did not disappoint.  In fact, I think it was one of the best things we ate!\n-Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (Crispy pork belly with a side of rice): Well OF COURSE we were going to get the one thing that is advertised as being absolutely amazing here!  This dish was also delicious, and I finished the whole thing almost by myself.  I guess the one tiny hang up on this was that some of the pork was overcooked so it was incredibly hard to chew through a few of the pieces.  That being said, I would certainly recommend trying this dish!\n-Chicken Pad Thai: This was Greg's dish, and he asked for chicken since he's not a fan of prawns.  I was too full to completely try this, but Greg's first impression was that it was too sweet.  That was before he knew to squeeze the limes over the dish.  After doing that, he said that it was the best Pad Thai he's had in San Francisco.\n\nFor the three dishes and three or four beers, the check came out to being fairly reasonable.  In my opinion, dishes like Pad Thai are difficult to elevate.  That being said, other dishes such as the beef and pork dishes we had were what made Lers Ros Thai the best place for Thai food in the city.  We don't always have the itch for Thai, but when the craving hits next, we'll hit up Lers Ros again.  \n\n\nps. They do delivery - winrar!", "author": "Lisa I."}

The balance of sweet, salty, and sour that is so integral to Thai cuisine is now gone, scrapped in favor of what is perceived to be the white man's affinity for sweet flavors, a sentiment echoed by many in the local Thai community today. Ler Ros once served food that was true to it's heart, but it now takes the same route as many of the other \"Thai\" restaurants in the city nowadays, watering down it's flavor with too much sugar.  Put it simply, the food is just too sweet now, and has lost the authentic edge that once set Ler Ros apart from the others.\n\nWhere the crowd of diners inside the restaurant was once an eclectic mix of Thais and the adventurous, you will now only find \"foodies\" who don't have the slightest clue what Thai food is.\n\nDespite the food not being as good as it was when Ler Ros first arrived on the scene, credit should be given for the fact that their menu still offers dishes far beyond your typical pad Thai, curries, and basil stir frys, and presented in their original format as well (no carrots or peas in your tom yum here). Portions are still generous in comparison to other Thai restaurants as well.", "author": "Mike A."}

I immediately thought of the Tenderloin. The crowd is mixed, I can trust a spot if I see non-Asians eating at a Tenderloin restaurant. We were immediately seated and looked at their great select and the special menu (alligator, rabit, etc). Interesting items on that special menu. However, we let my homegirl who is part Thai do the ordering. The staff never rushed us out and we took our time eating and catching up!! Damaged done was nearly $80 bucks but my friends said it was well worth it.\n\nGARLIC FROG ($9.95) - House special dish, fried Frog with a rich flavor of garlic, served with hot sauce. FYI, I DON'T EAT KEROPPI, SO I PASSED. However my friends were trying it for the first time and they were huge fans of it. I just couldn't do it.\n\nSOM TOM POO ($9.95) - Shredded green papaya salad with chili, tomatoes, lime based salad dressing and RAW CRABs. She asked for \"Laos\" style which I have no idea what the difference is but the wait staff new what she was talking about. I've never seen papaya salad with crab but I think this must be normal in Thailand. I dabbled in it since my friend order it extra spicy and it was pretty tasty. We ended up getting two orders of this.\n\nKUAY TIEW RUA ($8.25) - Native Thai style herb & meat boiled soup with noodle. I think my homegirl was expecting something different as she had this in Thailand and said it wasn't the same but it was still good. Just reminded me of Korean chicken soup.\n\nNUER PAD PRIK ($11.95) - Tender beef, stir-fried with fresh chili, bell peppers, yellow onion, bamboo shoot, basil and hot chili sauce. This was pretty good. It has a little bit of heat but the good kind of heat. \n\nPAD WOON SEN($8.95) - Silver noodles stir-fried with Prawns, Eggs and Napa Cabbage and Tomatoes. I think I have the right dish down. At first glance, it really looks like pancit (Filipino noodles) but the taste was different and SO GOOD. It looked so simple but tasted really really really cracking!!!\n\nKAI YANG ($11.95) - Marinated barbequed chicken, served with sweet and sour sauce. Reminded me of baked chicken. nothing really special. The only thing that stood out was that the chicken was very tender and easy to eat. We got two orders of this and not sure why when we only could finished one order.\n\nWill I be back? YES.\n\nJABA APPROVED. Until the next review...", "author": "Jane A."}

Ever since then, I've been wanting to try and I finally did yesterday. I went around 6pm with two of my coworkers and there was no wait!\n\nWe started off the raw shrimp salad. I really liked this dish. The sauce that came with it blended well with the shrimp. The server asked how spicy we wanted it from 1-10 and we said \"7.\" And it was pretty spicy... but that good kind of spicy.\n\nFor our meal, we ordered the quick fried fish, yellow curry with chicken, and pork shoulder. The quick fried fish was my favorite dish. It was a whole fried trout, and it came with a mango sauce that was just amazing. The yellow curry with chicken was just alright. Maybe it's cause I usually don't care for curry. The pork shoulder was nice and tender. The sauce that came with it paired well with it too. Its originally an appetizer but we asked for it to come out as an entree.\n\nI really liked the decor of the place. The place was very clean and modern. The service here was excellent.

Just mind your business while walking around and you'll be fine. The service is good and they try and accommodate you as best as they can. It also gets pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended. The atmosphere is fun and loud and you constantly catch people looking at other tables to see what they ordered. They have tons of items that look appetizing so it's hard to choose if you're a bit confused. \n\nMy favorites: \n\nLarb Phed Yang (Duck Larb Salad) - It has the perfect mix of sour, sweet and spice. The thai basil's flavor is pronounced but not overpowering and the duck is perfectly cooked. \n\nTom Kha Kai (Coconut Sour Soup) - This is a MUST try!

I think most people are talking over the music to hear the person across or next to them, which probably adds to the fact that you can't hear.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant reminds me a hip version of thai restaurant.

It was quite the experience.\n\nThe dishes.. .they serve a wide range. Alligator, boar, pork, chicken, frogs... etc. They have it all. I didn't dare try outside my comfort circle. We ordered the basil shrimp. It's spicy, but pretty okay. Not an array of veggies as I would've liked, but it does the trick. The crispy chicken over fried rice was also delish. I really liked the fried rice. And we also ordered the pad see ew... it was good. A bit too salty and saucy for me. so next time less soy. The chicken noodle with flat rice noodles was also good.

This was crispy, tasty and not too spicy.)\n2. Kang Keaw Wan, aka Green Curry (This dish was a little spicier but was a well made traditional green curry.)\n3. Rad Nah (House secret gravy sauce and marinated pork topping on the seasoned flat noodle, pictured below. That pork was so crispy I felt like I was eating pork grinds! This was a little spicy as well but by far, my favorite dish so far here). \n4. Sticky Rice with Durian (Durian! OMG, they have durian! My friends had never tried durian before. 1 hated it and the other 2 were indifferent. That just meant more durian for me! The durian flavor wasn't even that strong compared to it's fresh form but for all you durian lovers (vs haters) out there, this is a must try.

I ate past the point of fullness and then ate some more!\n\nSpicy Scale:\nMild- Probably the equivalent of hot cheetos and siracha\nMedium- You will need water. Your mouth will be stinging  and you will be doing that hissing thing sssk sssk.\nSpicy- All the ice and milk in the world won't help you now.\n\nWe ordered:\nLarb- Really good! Authentic to what I tried in Phuket. Great sharing portion and they aren't heavy with the rice powder so the texture and flavor is really good! For all you healthnuts, this is a really great dish that packs a ton of flavor\n\nPad Kee Mow- flavorful and not an insane amount of grease that will leave you all lip glossy. :) I really enjoyed this dish a lot\n\nPork Belly (Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob)- DELISH!! Def not the healthiest...obviously a bit greasy but so worth it! Great texture, definitely crunchy and the sauce goes well with it.. not too overwhelming. Must try! It's different from most dishes I have had at other thai joints. I would not advise leaving any left over because it tastes best fresh.\n\nMango sticky rice- This was very good and quite different from the other ones that I have tried. They don't give you a lot of mango, but the rice to mango ratio was perfect anyways. The rice his more moist than I usually have but it was amazing. I think they use more coconut milk in their recipe. Also the sesame crunchy thingies sprinkled on top is such a great addition to this dish.", "author": "Jenn L."}

We arrived around 11:30pm and the place still had a decent amount of people in it. Surprisingly, we weren't the last ones to show up!\n\nWe were hungry so we ordered a couple dishes to share. We barely had to wait, food came out very, very quickly. We had:\n- One of the noodle dishes on their daily special page ($9-10) - noodles with vegetables and pork. I'm a sucker for any type of noodle dish and this one was great.\n- Frog ($14) - came with vegetables and bite sized pieces of frog (think chicken wings). Very tasty but my dad didn't like how there wasn't much meat on them. Guess it's a specialty for a reason.\n- Kang keaw wan ($12) - green curry with eggplant, bamboo shoots, red peppers, lime leaves and chicken. So delicious and perfect with the rice.\n- Jasmine rice ($1.50)\n\nEverything was delicious and the service was crazy fast. Love how this place is open so late!

I do, however, highly recommend coming here for your authentic dose of noms noms if you should ever find yourself fiending for real Thai food like all the crackheads for dope on every street corner here in the TL.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons why I am more of a die hard fan of Lers Ros Thai than I am of watching Krappernick play as our QB.  Here's a few of them...\n\nI love how their grilled selection is done so authentically well that it brings me back to all those moments where I'd be at a random food cart in Thailand picking up perfectly grilled marinated pork neck, pork shoulder, and juicy chicken leg quarters with sticky rice served hot in clear plastic medium sized sandwich bags.  My Thai friends and I would pig out straight from those bags of grilled goodies and rice... no forks, no spoons, no knives, no toothpicks, no napkins. Just all out good ole primative chomping action. \n\nWhen we got to enjoy these grilled meats at a restaurant setting throughout Thailand, they would be served with a ridiculously appetizing dipping sauce made up mainly of lime juice, onions, rice powder, white pepper, cilantro, and often a few other spices.  I NEED that sauce in my life during my Thai dine ins ALWAYS these days.  They have that here.  I feel more complete with it by my side when taking down that delicious juicy fatty tender pork neck for the most part (my most favorite and nostalgic choice of meats).  \n\nWhat I go nuts for is their selection of meats that sends me into a daydream of being back in Bangkok... the frog, the boar, the alligator, the tiger prawns, the raw shrimp, the rabbit, the quail, and then some.  I cannot deny my love for their menu for just those reasons alone, but I love them even more that there is more to love.  \n\nTheir lip smacking savory sweet spicy curries have those little eggplants that you don't normally see in restaurants here in SF, but these are just the same exact little eggplants you'll surely find on your travels there.  Then there's the stir fried rice noodle plates like pad see ew, pad kee mao, pad thai, and rad nar that I would assume is more addictive than the dope they sell just around the block.  It's impossible not to fall for the sweet savory exotic and spicy flavors that Thai food is so specially known for.  So addictive it should really be illegal in my honest opinion along with that pork shoulder and pork neck.\n\nMy visitors and clients can't get enough of this place once I put them on game.  Should you ever come here due to my review here on Yelp though, be sure that your addiction for real authentic Thai food doesn't get you mistaken for a dope fiend here in the Tenderloin.

We came dining at 4pm so obviously there was none in the restaurant, only us. And the restaurant is pretty big and there is no line whatsoever. I was busy catching up with my friend and sat there for over an hour and this waiter kept checking on us every five minutes which was annoying. Can't we just talk in peace for more than 10 mins without your interruption or your weird stare from the register, for Christ sake? \n\nAll in all, the food is nice but don't expect to chill or hang around in this restaurant after your meal because the waiters will keep checking on you or giving you weird look!

First time for me visiting this location, but have been to other Lers Ros a couple of times before. We got seated right away, and after about 5 minutes we were able to flag down the male server to take our order. When i told him i wanted number 101 his response was \"What is that? I don't know what that is, you got to tell me the name.\" After hearing that our party just looked at each other in disbelief. Is this guy friggin serious? Isn't it your job to know what these numbers are? How can a person that lazy be hired at your establishment? \n\nFirst of all, there's a reason you put numbers on your menu, which i believe is to ease the ordering process of your 100+ items that you offer. Secondly, the names on the menu is not the easiest to pronounce. The numbers corresponding to said hard names are supposed to help with that, i would think. What is so hard about writing 101, 107, and so on so forth?  Now i don't know if you require your servers to study the menu at all like at other restaurants, but the least he could have done was look them up himself before submitting the order to the kitchen. Then to make matters worse, when one of my colleagues told him that she wanted to order a fried rice, and asked what kind you have, guess what his response was? \"We have many fried rice, you got to look in the menu.\" We received 3 sets of menu per person that consisted of one 6-page folded main menu, one back-to-back single page specials menu, and another single page drinks menu. It can be a little overwhelming to go through them especially when you don't have a lot of time to spend. Then he had the nerve afterwards to say \" i don't think you guys are ready to order, i will come back in a few minutes.\" My other colleague was so livid and told him that he needs to come back with a better attitude. He responded, \"Ok i will,\" with the fakest smile and sashayed away to the back of the bar area. \n\nI could go on and on about the lack of service we received throughout our meal, but these 2 incidents alone is enough to turn us off and convince us never to come back here again. This is SF Bay 2015, where good Thai food is a dime a dozen now. No one should put up with such bad attitude while dining anywhere. Ironic that on the wall it writes \"Lers means excellence,\" but it was so far from it for us yesterday. Good luck coming here!

Lets just say that my dress shirt was slightly drenched. But it was a good pleasurable pain haha.  I ordered brown rice to accompany the dish.\n\nThe flavors of this salad was just terrific. They provide heaps of this succulent pork shoulder in slices dusted with several spices. I tasted crushed star-anise and white pepper.

The service is very quick and we only waited 10 minutes before being seated. I want to give this restaurant 5 stars for the food but I am reducing one star since a worker used a floor broom to clean a table and dust everything on to a floor and use the same broom to sweep it up! I do not think anyone should ever use anything that they use for a floor on a table where people eat! Ok! that said!, we ordered the papaya salad with shrimp, ground chicken and basil, shrimp paste fried rice, and fried pork belly! The papaya salad with shrimp was so good and so fresh! The shrimp really made a difference. I am not a fan of pork belly in general but it tasted amazing. Same with fried rice! I tried some and it was very amazing as well! The shrimp paste wasn't overpowering and it really worked well!  I highly recommend this place and I really look forward to going back!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-25", "description": "First of all, it's a pleasure to go to any Thai restaurant that doesn't have the words \"Osha\" or \"King\" in it. The scene de cuisine has gotten so predictable on the Thai front that I find myself defaulting to Vietnamese a lot. Lucky for Lers Ros that Pagolac across the street is closed on Sundays because Jamie W. and I would not have noticed this place except friends recently raved about it to me. No wonder since the chef here says the two magic words that are ambrosia to my ears - Pork Belly!\n\nLocated on an unsavory block of Larkin between Ellis and O'Farrell, Lers Ros doesn't look that impressive at first sight - drop tiles on the ceiling, formica tables but with a nice black finish, big spherical fountain to remind you of the Zen serenity of the Tenderloin. But it does feel more contemporary and welcoming to the bourgeoisie than a lot of similar establishments in the 'hood. Lots of temptations on the abundant menu including a whole array of game meats like venison, boar and even alligator in their signature dishes. \n\nWe first went for one of their flaming hotpot soups - the $8.25 Tom Kha Kai, which is a coconut milk-based broth chock full of tofu cubes, hot red peppers, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, mushrooms, broccoli florets, carrots, and cabbage (see photos). The spices and the citrus flavor lent a certain sharpness to the milky flavor. The blandest of the three dishes we ordered was the $7.50 Pad See-Ew, which was basically a chicken chow fun dish with savory noodles mixed with green onions in a black bean sauce. It was good and hearty but none too distinctive on its own. \n\nThe best dish - and no big surprise to me - was the $8.95 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob, a sensational dish that mixes stir-fried pork belly chunks with the crispy rind and basil leaves and red peppers (see photo). So good that I thought I was in an upscale Italian restaurant in Bangkok and not at the Hilton either. I would order that again in a heartbeat. Service was what I would describe as mildly attentive - good at first but distracted by the neediness of larger parties as they took up more and more of the combined mind share of the wait staff. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...2 out of 3 dishes were excellent, not a bad average, especially with a pork belly standout to knock your socks off...if you wear socks \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...nice try at hip and contemporary, but it is the 'Loin after all \nSERVICE - 3 stars...attentive to spotty depending on how busy they get \nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely a terrific find in a tough 'hood", "author": "Ed U."}

When we ate here I had no knowledge of the menu or how good all the other food is.  Pad Thai is like a safety dish for me.  So one night a couple months later I searched \"pork belly\" on Yelp and Lers Ros pops up.  I look at the menu on their website and I saw \"stir fried pork belly with crispy rind\" SOLD.  Ever since then I was fixated on coming back to try this infamous pork belly.\n\nI was finally able to return this week to order this pork belly dish I'd been dreaming of.  Let me tell you...this dish exceeded all expectations I had.  I think it was actually better than I had imagined it to be.  The pork belly rind is similar to Chinese roasted pork, the one thats usually hanging in the windows of Chinese deli's with the crispy skin on the outside, but this wasn't crispy skin, its just crispy fat.  And its some fucking GOOOOOOD crispy fat.  The generous portions of pork belly came served with a basil and red pepper sauce.  There is a LITTLE heat to the sauce but it won't make you break a sweat.  What really impressed me is how tender the pork belly was..and the crispy rind NEVER got soggy, even after sitting in the sauce for a while.  I ate this with brown rice and it was amazing.  I could order this every single time I eat here and not be sick of it.  Seriously.\n\nMy gf & I also ordered the papaya salad with grilled shrimp.  We made the mistake of ordering this spicy rather than medium.  I love spicy food, so does she.  We can handle all kinds of spicy food..but damn..we could NOT handle this salad.  They do not fuck around with chili here when you say you want something spicy.  The first few bites weren't so bad...but somewhere in the middle my head started to hurt and my mouth was on fire.  I guzzled 3 glasses of water and it just got worse and worse.  The salad was supposed to be refreshing but it ended up...not being refreshing, lol.  We sat there giggling at each other because it was so hot we could barely handle it.\n\nWe decided we need to return in a couple of weeks and order the same thing..but papaya salad MEDIUM.

It's a small restaurant, poorly lit, and pretty cramped, so except a fairly intimate dining environment.\n\nWe ordered the tong yum gong soup, som tom koong yang (papaya salad with grilled prawns) and the pad ped moo pah (stir fried boar).  \n\nThe soup and the papaya salad were good, although I don't know if I'd make a trek out just for them.  It was true that the ingredients tasted like they were of better quality than some of the cheaper Thai joints, although I'm not sure if the price point matched the level of premium ingredients.\n\nWe ordered the stir fried boar because we knew that Les Ros was well known for their more exotic meats.  It was thinly sliced and came with a splash of vegetables and Thai spices.  In some ways it resembled Sichuanese food, and the actual meat itself was kind of gamey as you'd expect.  \n\nService:  They're extremely busy here.  You might have to be a bit on the louder end to get someone's attention.\n\nBottom line:  Not the world's best Thai - perhaps the city's? - but I'd be back to sample more of their exotic meats.  It's certainly a step up from your neighborhood Thai hole in the wall.", "author": "Denny C."}

I've actually been to Thailand once and tried their dishes, and have also tried most of the Thai places in SF. This spot is definitely the best. \n\nHere's what I've tried and how I liked it:\n\n-Som Tom Poo  - Shredded green papaya salad with chili, tomatoes, lime based salad dressing and RAW CRABs \n*So yummy! Great dish to start with, Raw crab actually tastes pretty good! \n\n- Tom Yum Koong  - Traditional spicy and sour soup with Prawn, lemongrass, mushrooms and kaffir lime leaves\n*Delicious soup, highly recommend!!! \n\n-Pad See-Ew  - Pan-fried flat noodle, served with chicken or pork (beef / prawns 9.95 , seafood11.95) $8.95\n-Pad Thai  - Traditional Thai style pan-fried rice noodle, Prawns; serve with crushed peanut, Bean sprout and sliced lemon\n*Can't go wrong with either of them.. both very flavorful. \n\n-Tom Yum Pla Kra Pong  - Whole fresh sea bass in spicy and sour soup\n**This is a hit or miss, the first time we tried it, it was cooked perfectly. But the last 2 times, it was a little overcooked and made the fish very chewy. \n\n-Thai Iced Tea is also good \n\nAside from being in the middle of the hood, this place is well worth trying.

Maybe 10 minutes later the place was  PACKED. Wow we were so lucky haha\n\nAlthough we were tempted by the frog, crocodile and other exotic meats.. ok not! ..maybe next time.. we ended up ordering the Nuer Tod for appetizer (fried Sun dried beef). I really really really loved it!! I'm still dreaming about it today. I can't wait to go back and have it again. So yummy.. but then again I love jerky so maybe that's why haha. For main dish.. so much to choose from but ended up with Pad Thai (my partner's way to test how good a Thai place is) and I had the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (stir-fried pork belly with crispy rind and basil leaves). Pad thai was prob the best we've had, and the pork belly dish was awesomely delicious.

How do we decipher what is good and what isn't in this dense community of \"good\" food? Its tough, I'm from LA and the food in SF is suppose to be superior...I've heard. Not convinced at all, yet.  Especially when everything in SF is 4+ stars. As Jay-Z says, \"overrated or underpaid.\" I guess its the motto here. SF is overrated for its local rating system. I can argue that most people don't have a car or don't want to go far in the city to get good food (since there is traffic and no place to park), so it boils down to what is good by proximity, which then elevates the value of the eatery. Bogus! \n\nBut wait, there is a place! I'm down with this spot. Not the best papaya salad compared to most. But I will give it to them for handling their business on a staple - patai was pretty darn good, I would argue some of the best in the city or any other spot. Good job. \n\nShady neighborhood, but its the city. The eatery it self is nice, cleaner and newer paint. Friendly staff and a lot to choose from on the menu.\n\nOther than the papaya salad and patai, I had the pork shoulder, this was good too.

Finally decided to write a review since I pretty much tried half of their menu last night.  We got here around 6 on a Tuesday so it wasn't too busy and we were able to get a table for 9.  \n\nWe started with appetizers which included a papaya salad, the curry puffs, fried beef, and duck larb.   Most of it was really good.  The papaya salad we got had the raw crab.  A bit on the sour side, but still good.  The curry puffs were so, so, nothing spectacular or worth ordering again.  The fried beef was really good, pretty much the same thing as a Cambodian beef jerky I used to eat at home growing up.  And of course the Duck Larb is still the best thing their menu!  So flavorful with the complex mix of onion, herbs, duck, lime, and ground up roasted rice!  \n\nFor the main entrees we had the Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mow, Fried Fish, Steamed Fish, Pork Soulder, Pork Belly, Fried Quail, and Friend Frog Legs, and a couple of more things i don't really remember.  Let me just focus on the standouts.  \n\nThe Fried fish was really good.  Although it was fried, the meat inside was still moist and flavorful, not fried flavored, which is good.  The Pork Should we really good, but not quite as good as Sai Jai's, more fatty and the dipping sauce too sour.  The Pork Belly was a stir fry with fresh peppers.  This plate was really good, but I was at the point where I was just picking at food when it came out, but still took 2 or 3 more bites that I should have.  Every thing else was solid, just not exceptionally good.  \n\nThe staff is really friendly, but pushy when it comes to telling you how much food to order (they always err on the too much food side, not a bad thing I guess, haha).  They are also quite a bit eager to clear your plates, even plates that were only half done.  They don't really ask, they just take, so be vigilant if you are saving any last morsels.\n\nA very good, solid Thai place, will definitely come back.

PERIOD.\n\nOk, ok so I know \"orgasmic\" and \"salad\" is an oxymoron but Lers Ros makes a salad that will tantalize your taste buds, set fireworks off in your mouth and make your eyes roll the f*ccccck back into your head. \n\nYum Koh Moo Yang (Pork Shoulder Salad w/ Spicy Lime Dressing - $9.95) is all you need to know. It even has \"yum\" in its name so know it's YUMtastic.

Slightly caramelized and crisp around the edges, the marinated roast pork shoulder is a taste and texture sensation in your mouth. The well-seasoned slice packs an intense rich buttery mouth-feel (not oily or greasy) full of subtle spices with a tinge of garlic. Each slice will leave you salivating for more. The lime dressing hits the pork with a fiery citrus punch while the basil, scallions, and cilantro give a fresh herbaceousness. As the icing on the cake, sprinkle some crushed peanuts for a nutty crunch. BEST. SALAD.EVER.\n\nORGASM GUARANTEED. DIET-FRIENDLY?

We weren't attended to in a reasonable amount of time (another table actually walked out without being served and, as the host chased them down to tell them a server would be with them, they said they waited too long and wouldn't be back).

There was a severe lack of vegetable on the plate and so I ate the few slices of meat I was allotted.

It was empty--we were probably the first or second group there. It def filled up around noon, so if you want to beat the crowd, head there early.\n\nWe ordered the duck larb, prawns asparagus, and green curry with beef.\n\nAt first we ordered the pork belly stir fry since the server said it was his favorite. We waited for our food for a while, but 5 or 10 minutes later, the server came back and said something about not being able to do the pork belly. Not exactly sure why. But we got the larb instead.\n\nThe duck larb turned out to be my favorite dish. It was super flavorful with lots of depth and spice to it. Not like any other larb I've had before. I'd go back here just for some of that stuff.\n\nThe other dishes were good too. Green curry (always one of my favorites at any thai place) was delicious and flavorful. The prawns asparagus was all right but didn't really live up to the hype that I heard about it. Or it was just overshadowed by the larb and the curry.\n\nFor two people and 3 dishes, it came out to about $46. Pretty pricey, but you do get quality food. For my regular thai cravings, there are definitely places just as good for cheaper. It's still worth a try and would be nice for more special occasions. Careful though, cause the area did seem a little sketchy.", "author": "Evelyn S."}

I wasn't sure if I was being overly generous with the 5 stars but after going to 2 different Thai places in the last month and attempting to order the same dishes, this place is the best if you're craving  these: \n\n1.  Tom Kha Kai  - Coconut milk based soup with Chicken , lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves Choice of Tom Kha with Prawn -  the soup is rich and flavorful.  every sip is a blast full of lemons, coconut, mushroom and chicken flavor.  i am SO addicted.  it comes out hot and it makes your belly warm and comforted.  it's got a little kick to it too so don't think you can order it when you're feeling sick because it will probably make u feel worse.  it's slightly spicy, but very subtle so you get the full effect of flavor in every spoon.\n\n2. Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob  - Stir-fried pork belly with crispy rind and Basil leaves - CRUNCHY AND DELIGHTFUL!  wowowowowow.  it's pretty difficult to make pork belly that is juicy but has the full crunch to it and they definitely do the job.  i am such a fan!  the other two places we went the meat was either dry or the skin soggy but they manager to do both.  it's got the right amount of salty and i cant' seem to get enough.  again, it's got a little spicy kick to it too so it gives it an extra yummyness.  basil leaves + pork belly = a winner as well with it's full flavor and brings out more of the fatty taste.\n\nI WANT TO GO RIGHT NOW!", "author": "Sandy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-07", "description": "I really thought that LRT was going to knock out THE (Thai House Express) as king of late night Thai food dining, when they first opened last year. THE was open until 1am, while LRT decided to stay open until 2am. LRT has an extensive menu and many unique items, plus the place is new so decor is nicer & cleaner inside. But in the end THE steady cooking consistency prevailed.\n\nPlease note that they both have since revised their hours, to close at midnight.\n\nWhen I first dined here some time ago I would have given LRT 5 stars, but after months of late night (after 10pm) dining I have to say that the late night kitchen crew just doesn't measure up. THE's late night kitchen cooks are more experienced, so food consistency is way better than LRT. Some of the irregularities I found were that:\n\n1 - the chicken meat on curry dishes was a little dry. Meat cooked in coconut milk should not be dry, unless it was precooked and combined later - I think that the night kitchen crew precooked the meats to save time. Chicken green curry (#36) dish http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/QUFC-saM20oGdnrF3SdcoA/l\n\n2 - so far, the night cooks just don't know how to do stir-fry noodles right. I ordered a few stir-fried flat noodle dishes during several days, and they always came out clumped, even the soupy Rad Na (#79) dish had clumped flat noodles. Worst version of a Pad see ew (#77) dish I've ever had - edible, but with mushed and clumped flat noodles. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/fRgMUz-N4rsJkXxJkJWHow/l\n\nBut don't get me wrong, I still consider this restaurant a favorite (2nd best Thai place, behind THE). Friendly and pleasant service, in addition to an extensive menu (can be overwhelming) that includes many unique dishes not found elsewhere, plus items like rabbit, frog, venison, alligator, etc. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/FxSPi6lVEOshX1Iv5kEM4w/l\n\nMy favorite appetizer is the pork shoulder (#9), although the sauce can be a little gritty. And it takes some time to make, so it often arrives after the entrees. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uNFrKF-275yaP41J-EWTmw/l I don't mind since it's that good (when done right). http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/cLgDmm4yHFR0hdqRfrmA2Q/l\n\nAmong the starters, the chicken satay (#2) is very tender and tasty, http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cpHZUcLskWsr4kmCPTDu3w/l and the Thai curry puff (#1C) is also good, similar to a samosa. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/F1ZZoFTKm7eYSYEdSJtArQ/l The herb sausage (#4) has good flavor and was not greasy. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/4bgvTr-ivtpAquSyXw6T8A/l\n\nOne of my favorite entrees is pork belly with crispy rind (#62), http://media4.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RmiiK5RI77VG5rRQVAQyGQ/l meaty cubes of pork w/crispy skin, http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/kD8usyczXVVKMYISwPwJXA/l delicious! http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/akFi_TN0pK2Bqd2uKgR89Q/l\n\nMost customers order the rice plates (#52-65). Pad kee mow (#76), noodles and bean sprouts, http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o6ckrAceCa-TlW2nr5baEg/l is another standard dish that's good when done right.\n\nAmong the specials, garlic & pepper rabbit was deep fried too long (dry), and has a lot of small bones. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/_sTtaR2lxO3MxJTkh6-h8Q/l And Pad ped pla lai (eel with peppercorns and spicy chili) is somewhat difficult to eat because the eel has not been deboned, but sliced cross section. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/XSTF1PNp7Y29Z7WepcNFkw/l\n\nVenison pad prik thai had the potential to be a winning dish, but it contained too many whole black peppercorns that had no flavor or spice (maybe too old, or not stored properly). http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/q2IxIN9bVN8oWs6j4wx26Q/l\n\nThe deep fried trout special was well made, crispy and tender. It's deboned, so you could eat everything including the crispy small bones at the edge. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/tS6fh5RIQlBeRtdq8Ix1uQ/l\n\nSimilar to THE, the restrooms are upstairs but u don't need a key.", "author": "Luis C."}

Everything was pretty decent, but there was always something that either held the food back, or wasn't enough to get them over the hump to \"awesome\".  That is, until my friends and I dropped in for dinner last week.  Maybe it's because we did a better job of ordering this time around, but I was pretty impressed.  I guess what they say is true - the third time really is the charm!\n\nCompared to my first couple of trips, people have definitely found out about Lers Ros.  While the wait for a table wasn't terrible, the place was still pretty darn crowded!  After we got settled at our table in the back, we put in our orders: \n\n- Koh Moo Yang (Grilled Pork Shoulder appetizer with Chili Sauce) - one of my favorite Thai dishes anywhere (Chan Pad Poo at Marnee Thai being another).  I've had it every time I've been to Lers Ros and it has never failed me.  Tender and perfectly seasoned, the spicy chili sauce isn't necessary, but adds that much more flavor.  Freaking delicious!\n\n- Kang Keaw Wan (Green Curry with Thai Eggplant, Red Bell Peppers, Kaffir Lime Leaves and Chicken) - maybe it's because of the coconut milk base, but I loved the the richness of the curry.  It's got a little heat to it, but in a good way...one of my favorite Thai curries.\n\n- Pad Krapow - (Ground Pork stir-fried with Basil and house special sauce) - really savory and oh so delicious.  Their house sauce is really what makes the dish, and whatever they put in there is definitely special.\n\n- Rad Nah (Marinated Pork with House Secret Gravy on Flat Noodles) - a little different than I had expected (didn't expect there to be THAT much sauce), but still liked it regardless.  A little heavy on the white pepper, but I was okay with it.\n\nIn addition, we also ordered a couple of vegetarian dishes, but I held off from trying them to make sure our friend had enough to eat.  From what I could see though, both looked pretty tasty (one was stir fried eggplant, the other Pad Kee Mao?).\n\nIf it weren't for the neighborhood (on the edge of the Tenderloin), I would probably come here all the time if I could.  Even though there are plenty of good alternatives in SF, I haven't found a place that can match both the authenticity of their food and the quality of the dishes.

Fresh herbs and spices accompanied by perfectly prepared proteins seems to be the theme here; they definitely pack on the flavor and are not shy with their use of spices. The duck larb, sun-dried beef, catfish salad and Yum Woon Sen salad are a few of my favorites and I always get one of these items each time I go.  \n\nBeing adventurous pays off in a big way at Les Ros. Don't shy away from exotic ingredients or modify dishes -- their plates are very well balanced as they come. Two things to keep in mind: many of their fish, frog and quail dishes come bone-in which can be difficult to eat around though worth the challenge. They do have many of these dishes available de-boned if you prefer. Also, I am not kidding about the spice factor, I love spicy food and can't order anything above medium spice. \n\n Oh, one last thing, ALWAYS get the sticky rice!", "author": "Elisa P."}

Normally, I don't really like Pad Thai because the sugar and starchiness from the noodles, creates a brainy texture of the noodles and it's just not my style, BUT Ler ros somehow perfectly creates their dish. ALL their meat dishes are going to be really good, so don't even trip about trying something new, it will always be SUPER good.

If you're adventurous, try items on the chef's specials.

They were both pleasing, but the alligator couldn't be tasted through the spiciness, which we happened to have requested. At least we know this place will give you food that's verifiably spicy if you ask for it.\n\nSomething I found interesting was the setup of the staff. When we walked in, 4 or 5 servers were standing in one spot toward the back. Every once in a while, one or more of them would walk to another area, pause for some length of time, then repeat. They resembled non-playable characters in video games. Speaking of games, can the servers instead drive go-karts around the tables and throw turtle shells at each other? I'd pay extra to see that.\n\nWe incidentally paid extra anyway, for it wasn't till after getting home that we realized our servers never brought us change from the bill. We should've paid some attention along with that extra cash. I believe most or all of the overflow was indeed intended as tip, but still.

It can get crowded but it's definitely a step above the numerous Thai places in the vicinity.\n\nI try something new every time I go back, and each time I regret not getting what I had the first time, the Pad Thai.\n\nYou can gain a measure of the establishment by their treatment of the flagship dish of their culture's cuisine, and this Pad Thai is the best I've had so far in the city. The noodles are fresh and hold sauce superbly without congealing into a thick, sticky mess. The sauce is not overly sweetened, allowing the underlying layers of umami fish sauce and garlic/pepper spice bring balance to the dish. I appreciate a dish that lets the ingredients talk, rather than assault you with sugar and spice as a cop out. \n\nBottom line, this is a solid spot. Portions are large and service is good too. The pickled jalape\u00f1os on the side are super tasty and not spicy, either. \n\nIf you're curious about the prawn/garlic/mint \"salad\", first it's not a salad so much as butterflied raw prawns with mint leaves on top. Second, be prepared for almost a clove of raw sliced garlic on each prawn. It tasted like a mouthful of fiery raw garlic with some slimy mid-quality raw shrimp and not enough mint to cover up the terrible experience.

With an endorsement like that, the bar was set pretty high. \n\nI definitely wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was modern, clean, and beautiful. we came at noon and both times were seated right away (although half an hour later I noticed a line out the door). Bonus: You can make a reservation online so if you're worried about waiting, just hop on the web to make a ressie. \n\nI've been twice and tried a variety of dishes. My brother ordered the papaya salad to start which was SPICY but delicious. He raved about it. Apparently it was pretty bomb. We also had chicken pad thai which was pretty good although I can't say I thought it was too different than pad thai I've had at other restaurants. \n\nThe standout dishes included a thai fried chicken with ginger rice - not something you find on many thai restaurant menus but authentically thai and absolutely delicious. I also had a dish with black pepper, and green and white onions which was so so so good. Red Curry also made an impression with plenty of protein, veggies, and the perfect amonunt of spice.\n\nService was decent, although during busier periods, it may take awhile to get water or other things requests after you've submitted your order. \n\nAll in all, the food at this place was spectacular and the menu was extremely comprehensive. I need to make several more trips to try the pork belly and the spiced roast duck.\n\nPS. The restaurant is in the Tendorloin but on the outskirts of it so it's slightly less sketch than the other parts. There's only street parking but I didn't feel worried about leaving my car unattended, unlike most places in the 'loin. Food was definitely worth a trip out there.", "author": "Carmen K."}

We had the Yum Pla Duk Foo (duck salad recommended by the waitress), Koh Moo Yang (pork shoulder appetizer), and Pad Thai (big surprise).

The pork shoulder appetizer was flavorful and drenched in fat/oil.... The pad thai was pad thai. There were more bean sprouts on the side and I didn't know if I was supposed to mix those in... since there were already some mixed in the dish. \n\nOverall, it was a great thai meal, however, not recommended before going bar hopping because it really makes you feel bloated, especially with the salty, carb-loady dishes.

This was a minor thing but we were all pretty famished. \n\nAt first, I was kinda digging the cute little wooden chairs thinking that it was unique seating, but once we were sat, I realized how inconvenient these stupid chairs were. I had to sit on my coat, scarf, and purse because there were no backs to the chairs nor was there a coat rack or anything. I looked around and saw people with coats on their laps but what a terrible idea for me since I tend to spill. \n\nWe asked for straws for our waters and our server clearly forgot so we asked another passing server and when she finally came back with our straws, she saw that we now had them and threw them down with a stink face. Oops. Well we wouldn't have asked a second time if we had gotten them in the first place. \n\nI usually order green curry, my favorite out of the three kinds, and usually the spice level is pretty mild, but not here. The flavor was really good but much too spicy for me to enjoy so I thought to ask if they could lighten it up with some coconut milk or something. The server said they can't do that because the curry was premade but I could swap it out for yellow curry instead. I was a little reluctant but went ahead and was pleased with the trade. This transaction went mostly smoothly but I always hesitate a little before sending food back thinking I had offended someone and then subsequently having spit in my replacement food. I'll never know.\n\nService got slow towards the end when we wanted to ask for boxes and then the bill.

Neither of which are the case for me however.\n\nLers Ros is the spot to go to for Thai food when you don't want Thai food like pad thai, pad see ew, green curry, etc.  This restaurant does make the aforementioned standards, though in all honesty it's not my go-to spot for such dishes, but they also do so much more and it's evident by their \u00e0 la Chinese-restaurant-sized extensive menu.\n\nFrog legs, quail and rabbit?  They serve it.  Haven't tried it yet though.  Recently had the stir fried pork belly with rice, the five spice roast duck over rice, and the duck larb.  The stir fried pork belly is excellent -- diced and cubed juicy pieces of pork belly with crispy and crunchy rinds.  The five spice duck meat is juicy and very flavorful.  The duck larb is vinegary, fish saucy, basily, and flavorful meaty goodness.  Red curry with duck is also very good, though quite spicy.  I highly recommend these dishes.\n\nOverall, the food here is very good, it's reasonably priced, and service is pretty friendly.", "author": "Erich D."}

The tables are very densely packed within the restaurant and it is hot / stuffy as s* in the restaurant so be prepared. All the waitresses seem to be Thai and the hospitality is Thai quality (as in very very good).\n\nHere's what we tried:\n- Chicken laab (ground chicken salad): We asked for medium spicy because quite frankly, I'm scared of \"Thai spicy\" although I'm an avid spice-aholic. The laab itself was good but I probably could have gone a little spicier. You should definitely try this with some sticky rice. The two are perfect complements.\n- Pad kee mow: I loved loved loved the noodles here! Often times, pad kee mow can be drenched in sauce or oil, but the noodles here were extremely flavorful sans excessive sauce / oil. The noodles themselves were perfectly cooked and not clumped together (another problem that I've experienced with this dish at other places).\n- Garlic quail: Super flavorful with clumps of fried garlic on top.

I think this restaurant is good for a casual date night, as I saw some couples in the restaurant. Not too fancy or too dingy. Though I don't mind going on a date to a dingy place as long as the food good and won't give me stomachache.\n\nFood: I like the PORK BELLY!!! I like how they make the skin very crunchy!

We have both dined at Lers Ros for both lunch and dinner. \n\nThe lunch menu is very cheap. At under $10, you have a choice of various appetizers and you select two entrees. (also served with rice) \nHowever, the ambience and quality of food is almost night and day. The fluorescent lighting cheapens the environment and although we ordered the same entrees both times, the food was much more flavorful at dinner. Coming in at dinner, the environment is much more warm and inviting. \n\nSome of our favorites...\n\nTom Yum Goong (Hot and sour soup with shrimp) \nGreat if it's cold out, or if you're catching one.\nAvoid it if you do not enjoy eating cilantro or lemongrass. The presentation is pretty exciting. \n\nSticky Rice is one of our favorite cause it is very authentic and made the same way the local Thai's serve in Thailand. Especially paired with the next two entrees below.\n\nSom Tam (Spicy Papaya Salad) A good indicator of a good Thai restaurant is their som tam. This dish is the best papaya salad I've tried in the City. *It can get VERY spicy, and I'd advise you to get it mild and don't forget to add the shrimp!\n\nKai Yang (Thai BBQ style chicken) is another delicious dish and it goes very well with the Papaya salad. However, it is very filling. \n\nThai Iced Tea pairs well with the dishes, especially the spicy ones. However, I would forgo getting it to-go because comes in a cup half the size the one they serve in the restaurant.\n\nOverall, we have not had any bad experiences with Les Ros and would highly recommend this place.

I'll be specific.\n\nWe ordered two different appetizers.  Half an order of the first one came soon, but the second half never came, nor did the second appetizer.  We asked the waitress and she said the second half was coming, which it did, just as the entrees began to arrive.  The other appetizer never came, and when we reminded her about it, she said we never ordered it and then brought it halfway through the meal.  One of the drinks--an iced tea--never arrived.  We reminded the waitress three times before she finally brought it.  Each time she acted as if we had never ordered it and never asked for it the previous times.\n\nOne person ordered sticky rice, which arrived ten minutes before any of the food and was cold by the time the food arrived.\n\nThe entrees came out over about a fifteen minute period.  Two different dishes were delivered that weren't ordered, and two entrees didn't arrive.  When we asked about those, the waitress said the one was coming and insisted we hadn't ordered the other.  (The computer-generated bill showed the correct order for everything, and we had given the number as well as the name of the dish when ordering to be helpful.)  After a long argument she agreed to bring that one, which eventually came.\n\nThe other entree never arrived.  On the second reminder, she again said it was coming.  On the third reminder, she asked what dish we were talking about and suggested we hadn't ordered it.  The fourth time we asked the host to intercede.  The last entree finally arrived after everyone else was done eating (the person who ordered it is somewhat limited in what he eats so was not able to borrow food from the other dishes ordered by others in our party).  The waitress did not apologize or offer any explanation and, indeed, seemed at best disinterested and at worst put out by us from the beginning.\n\nWe were a mid-sized party and had ordered about half an hour before the dinner rush really got going.  We sat next to a much larger party that arrived after we did, got its food before we did, and seemed to have no issues with service.  They had a different waiter.  \n\nThe host was aware of the service problems we were having but made no effort to correct them or to offer an explanation.\n\nWe will not be returning, which is unfortunate because, as I say, the food that did show up was quite good.

Fast foward to 2015 and it's just not the same.  The curry's texture was pretty thin in comparison/noticably on the watery side,  and, while the pieces of duck were much bigger, the meat was tough to the point that it didnt feel blended with the curry or part of the dish. The flavor was fine, but the change in consistency made it less enjoyable.  It's 3 stars in that...I mean, it still tastes pretty good,  but I just use to remember it to be mind blowing.

Everything looked really great. I finally settled on the Cucumber Salad and Original Thai Style soup #109 ( I don't remember the full name) It was basically a seafood and vegetable medley in chili paste soup.\n\nThe soup was very disappointing. While the flavor was decent, it was mostly just broth and barely any filling. There were about 4-5 prawns and a couple florets of cauliflower. For 13.95 I was extremely disappointed. My boyfriend had ordered the Garlic and Pepper Rabbit special and while the flavor was good, the meat was extremely tough and a bit dry. Not very much either since they left all the bones in. The Garlic and Ginger fried rice was very good however. Another friend ordered the #58, 5 Spice Duck over rice. When her dish came out, there was about 1/2 a cup of diced duck on top of 4 cups of rice. The duck was also overcooked to boot.\n\nI had heard a lot of great things about Lers Ros and I really wanted to like it, but the experience was really upsetting and the food was average at best. I could have gone to King of Thai Noodle or Osha Thai for better food at a better price.

And as such, I would recommend to anyone trying this place for the first time to venture beyond their comfort zone. We got some interesting things like sauteed rabbit and spicy alligator (!) And of course on a menu that large there are going to be some duds. We tried this deep fried pork thing that was really bad because the bones were actually still in some of the pieces. We left that but seriously we had 9 other dishes that had rocked our socks off so we weren't about to make a stink about it.\n\nI don't know whether I like this place or Sai Jai Thai better.. but they're so close to each other, who cares?", "author": "Josh K."}

I've come here twice - once on a date with the bf and the other for my law school grad dinner. This is also my roommate's favorite place.  I've always had a pleasant experience here, despite the long waits.  And you will most likely be waiting for some time before you get to eat.  The prices are a little on the high end for a Thai restaurant but I think most of what you are paying for is the experience to try exotic meats and dishes you normally wouldn't find in any other Thai restaurant.\n\nThe Garlic Frog here is great.  It's chopped up into small little pieces, fried, and served with a Thai chili sauce.  Frog can sometimes taste a little fishy yet retain the texture of chicken.  I didn't get that awkward fishy taste here and the meat was pleasantly juicy.\nI've also had the Pad Thai, though I won't go into it since it's fairly easy for Thai restaurants to get right.  Let's just say that it was good.  \n\nThe duck curry is the bf's favorite here.  Sadly, they don't give you a lot of duck meat.  But whatever bits of duck meat you are able to scrounge up, you'll find that it is fairly tasty.  The curry itself is good - pretty consistent with every other Thai restaurant I've been to.\n\nThe Tom Yum Pla Kra Pong is terrific.  It is a whole sea bass in a sweet and sour soup served in a tub.  The fish is fresh and the soup goes so well over rice.  My mom also loves this dish, and that's saying something because she can cook her ass off in terms of this dish.  Well, my mom's cooking in general rocks but you get the gist.\nI've heard the Duck Larb is the thing to try but surprisingly I have yet to try it.

In all honesty I had no idea what larb meant (I had to look it up), and to save you any confusion, it's kind of a sour and kinda spicy meat salad. This was my favorite dish of the night. A MUST try if you haven't already!\n\nThe pork shoulder was also amazing. The meat was already delicious on its own, but the sauce that it came with definitely knocked it out of the park.\n\nPork belly was perfectly cooked. The skin was nice and crispy while the meat was tender and flavorful. \n\nWe also ordered the Pad Kee Mao.

(Is it just me, or are there a lot of really good restaurants here?) The wait time for two was fairly fast, but I'm not sure how long it would take to seat a larger party.\n\nWhat I really like about this restaurant is that they serve tons of Thai dishes that I have never been exposed to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-03", "description": "*4.5 stars*\n\nLers Ros Thai may or may not be the best Thai food in the city, but it's definitely the most exciting. It's like homecooked Thai food amped up ten-fold -- there are Thai dishes I've never seen on a menu before, and there are variations to typical Thai staples that will blow your mind. The pungent flavors and fire-hot spiciness here are phenomenal, packing punches harder than with any Thai food I've had outside of Thailand. After my first visit, I was absolutely hooked, and now when I feel like eating Thai food, I'm essentially saying that I feel like eating Lers Ros.\n\n------------------\nFOOD:\n\nCrispy Pork Belly = It's weird, this dish lacks consistency, even within the same plate. When the piece is done right, it's possibly the best crispy pork belly in the city. The spice, the intense flavor, the ultra-crispy skin, the tender meat -- it all just blends together perfectly. However, within the same plate, there are also pieces that are too tough, too dry, and too overcooked. There are also other pieces where the skin is soggy rather than crispy. It's really strange and somewhat disappointing. But because I know how DELICIOUS the good pieces are, I always keep ordering this dish and will probably continue to order this dish for as long as I eat at Lers Ros.\n\nYum Koh Moo Yang (Pork Shoulder Salad) = Tender pieces of pork shoulder that go incredibly well with the salad.\n\nPapaya Salad w/ Grilled Prawns = My vote for the best papaya salad in SF. The spice level here is through the roof, making this a dangerous dish for people who can't handle their peppers. The prawns are well-cooked, the papaya is nice and crunchy, and everything just works together excellently.\n\nFried Quail = Pretty good. This dish rides a dangerously-thin line, since it could easily be tough and overcooked. I had pieces that were, for sure, but when it's done well, it's delicious.\n\nGreen Curry = Very good. Green curry is one of those dishes that's tough to get wrong, and Lers Ros definitely doesn't get it wrong. Again, the intense spice is what makes this a winner.\n\n------------------\n\nLers Ros Thai breathes unique and exciting life into your typical Thai fare. With Basil Thai and Marnee Thai, among others, there's tons of great Thai food competition in the city; but Lers Ros is definitely the one that stands out for its ingenuity and boldness.", "author": "Roy C."}

However, when I called to confirm my order 2 days before the birthday party, they first confirmed my order, but then just 5 minutes later, they called back and said they couldn't do it, because they were \"remodeling\" their kitchen.  We were totally shocked!  The woman I talked to on the phone had no explanation for why Lers Ros hadn't bothered to inform me about this before.    \nSo if I hadn't called to confirm my order, I'd have ended up having NO FOOD for my kid's party?  This is totally not acceptable.  We had to scramble over the weekend to find a replacement caterer.", "author": "Elena L."}

Like \"I can't feel my mouth I can't eat this anymore\" spicy. I'm pretty good with eating spicy foods but this was so much that it totally affected my dining experience. And first impressions are important. I had the green curry and the spicy pad see yew. I didn't specify that I didn't want it that spicy but I've had enjoyable green curry at other thai places. My experience here wasn't enjoyable bc my mouth was on fire. The ambiance is nice though and servers are friendly. The service was fast. I would specify next time NOT to add the spiciness. Also the thai iced tea was $5 which is pretty expensive... They also charged $1.50 for the rice that is supposed to come with the curry. Like what!", "author": "Cherie L."}

The first time I went here was mid-day on a Saturday.  We were the only ones there and it looked like any other small restaurant in the tenderloin.  At night - the place has a totally different vibe.  Both were fantastic. \n\nLast night I got the duck larb after reading numerous reviews.  I had no idea what Larb was, but I'll try anything once.  I think I have a new favorite Thai dish.  It was spicy but sweet, too - crunchy and warm.  Listed in the salad section, I wasn't sure it would be enough for dinner, but it was perfect.  I opted for the sticky rice as per the waitress's suggestion.  It was a little difficult to eat wrapped in the lettuce provided, so I opted to just go at it with a fork.  I ate everything on the plate (save for the 3 chiles which were big enough for me to see and avoid).  There's a reason this place and this dish are so popular.\n\nThe place was busy but we didn't have to wait long for a seat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-06", "description": "The power of Yelp to bring people together can never be underestimated as I had the pleasure of joining a total of 25 Yelpers from Stockton, Los Angeles, East Bay and San Francisco at a recent Private UYE that included Maybelline C, Anthony N and his sister Linda, Valerie C,  Jenny B, Shannon F, Amy C and her boyfriend Jason, Tom R, Toni M and husband Alan, Paul K, Tammy C, Marti L and boyfriend Sam, Danny L, Jonathan W and girlfriend Marie G, Maureen G and husband Bob, Hube N, Manabu M, Sarah O, and Alma R. Everyone arrived promptly and we were seated at the center table which was vertically arranged that stretched from the kitchen door all the way to the front entrance. With seating arranged by the level of spiciness, I had the pleasure of surrounding myself with Toni, Alan, Manabu and Shannon. \n\nBy studying the menu in advance, we were able to order 20 family style dishes with many that were doubled to feed the size of our group. To name a few highlights, I enjoyed the Chicken Satay, Thai Herb Sausage, Fried Spare Ribs, Pork Belly, and Ginger with Chicken, Sliced Tender Beef with Young Peppercorn and Galingale, and chunky Frog with Basil Leaves. My absolute favorites were the spicy fried Tilapia and tender Sea Bass where the meat fell off the bones ever so beautifully. The Red and Green Curries and Curry Puffs that looked like samosas were really outstanding too.\n\nThe dishes that I thought needed improvements were the Green Papaya Salad with Raw Crabs and the Spicy and Sour Seafood Soup which was too sour for me. The Beef Tendon Stew was not a good choice as it was difficult to share, and I thought the Eggplant was decent but not the best I've had. I didn't have a chance to sample the Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew but they looked pretty good too. Several people had complained about the clams, but otherwise people were super full by the end of the meal. My side dish of prik nam pla was powerful as I always appreciate the chance to boost my level of spiciness up another notch. \n\nService was a bit inconsistent throughout the meal. They were a bit understaffed and the wait time between each dish was filled with gaps here and there. On the other hand, I also appreciated the fact that they went out of their way to buy crabs from the market in the morning just so we could have it, and they were extremely generous for not charging us a mandatory gratuity and cake cutting fee in the end. They went above and beyond to serve us by keeping our fresh cherries and saint honore cake refrigerated, and without asking they provided us fresh plate settings whenever it was needed--including dessert which we didn't order from them. In the end we had the chance to get out of our seats to mingle with each other, and this also allowed us to take over the entire restaurant with plenty of room to roam. The restaurant was also airing the World Cup at the time which further added to the festivity as people reacted to the different phases of the game.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect meal by any stretch of the imagination. I think their evening chef might be better but I also believe we couldn't ask for better service given the size of our group. In the end we each paid $27 including tax and gratuity--not bad considering the range of dishes we were able to cover throughout the meal. I'm very thankful for all the Yelpers who attended the event, and for Jonathan W's fresh picked Brentwood cherries and Manabu M's invitation to hang out at the rooftop of his home to overlook the skyline afterwards. Maybelline, Anthony and Valerie were wonderful organizers that brought everyone together. It was a memorable meal as Lers Ros has once again proven to be my #1 go-to Thai restaurant ahead of all others.", "author": "Daniel L."}

I wasn't impressed by the garlic rabbit or the spicy noodle, but I shall return!\n\nThe Tale of the Girl Who Dined with Peter Rabbit Before a Giants Game:\nAfter watching, Check Please! Bay Area, I had to check this place out. Boyfriend and I got off Civic Center and walked over and arrived at 4:50pm on a Tuesday. \n\nWe ordered the house special, Garlic Rabbit and Spicy Noodle. We also tried out one of the recommendations from a Check Please! reviewer: Thai Herb Sausage.\n\nI appreciated that the food came out in good time.\n\nThe sausage was definitely the highlight of the meal. I liked eating the sausage with the dainty slices of chili pepper, mixed with some cilantro, peanuts, and ginger. It was spicy! The small pieces of lime helped quell my self-induced, tongue-burns, however as dainty as the lime slices were, it was kind of annoying how small they were, and they were difficult to hold onto while peeling the lime flesh with my enormous teeth. Maybe I should have just popped them in my mouth. I might have misjudged the significance of dining etiquette. \n\nBoyfriend was quiet throughout dinner, thinking about the Thai Iced Tea that never came. \n\nNext we had the spicy noodle, which maybe after the awesomeness of the Herb Sausage didn't really compare. We were looking for something new and interesting. Spicy noodle wasn't that interesting. It had a few bits of red bell pepper. \n\nSimultaneously, we had the Garlic Rabbit. It tasted like chicken. I've had a similar Filipino chicken dish. Small pieces of chicken deep fried golden. And just like in the Filipino dish, there were small bits of bone shards once every 6 pieces. I was eating the meat carefully, because I didn't want to eat bones. I had to carefully eat around the bones, even though they easily could have chewed. Eating the small bits of rabbit took a long time. Can bone shards cut your GI epithelia? **\n\nIn fact, after one minute of waiting to see if the waitress would look over to figure out we wanted our check, I walked straight up to the lot of them huddling in a circle and held out my card. Then, we sped walked to AT&T park to get our free snow globes. Almost missed the snow globes by 10 minutes(I watched from above timing it). And exactly at bottom of the 6th inning, I finally dislodged the last of the rabbit bone shards from my teeth.\n\nLike the last two reviews I've posted recently, I would come back! Even rabbit bone shards have not pacified my interest to try out new menu items! (Eating REAL Filipino food emboldens me to try out anything!) I wish more Thai restaurants would offer more interesting things!\n\nAnd like my last review, I'm holding out on my 4- or 5-star rating until I'm really impressed. For the credit of the Garlic Rabbit, if I was at home with my family, watching the game on my couch, I probably would not have minded snacking on Peter Rabbit.\n\n** http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1790837/", "author": "Poiuytrewq A."}

Well that's what we could have used to have hauled all of our overly stuffed self's away form this fabulous place! \n\nThanks to Daniel L, maybelline C. Anthony N. and Valerie C.They really did a fantastic job on finding a perfect gathering place for us yelper's to indulge in some wonderful food. \n\nThis place is cute and small but with a decent amount of seating. It's certainly nothing fancy though, nice and well kept. \n\nI really can't recall what half of the dishes were called, though I do believe we just about covered every item on the menu. \n\nThere seemed to be about 20 people that joined us this day, as well as 20 different dishes we indulged in. \n\nThe appetizers were delightful. Our first trying was of some sort of stuffed puff treat that came with a dipping sauce- It was soft and chewy and incredibly flavorful. The Thai Herb Sausage was quite tasty though, a little too spicy for my liking. The Chicken Satay was great -Chicken was cooked well, flavor was nice and the peanut sauce is always a great companion. \n\nGarlic Frog (My first trying of frog legs) was surprisingly delicious- Crunchy, yummy and jam packed with savory flavor. \n\nThe Som Tom Poo- Which is shredded green papaya salad with tomatoes and raw crabs. This was nice but definitely not my favorite- The salad had a nice fresh flavor unfortunately, I just really was not crazy about the raw crab parts mixed with in it (which seemed to have a scarce amount of meat as well) \n\nThe Phad Thai was phenomenal! I have only had Phad Thai a few times and this one has to be one of the better ones I have tried. \n\nThere was some kind of Lemongrass soup with scallops, clams and shrimp that was tasty in a very refreshing way, a little overwhelming with the lemongrass, though still light and flavorful. \n\nA Red Curry dish that was incredibly delicious - Still on the spicy side though not enough to push it away-very nice!! \n\nA sea bass dish that was outstanding!! The fish was cooked perfectly to where it just fell of the bones and the flavor was fantastic!! \n\nOverall, most of the dishes were outstanding!

Despite the crowd, we were told that we would have a table in 15 minutes--which was unlikely, and turned out that we waited much longer. Much. \n\nDespite the long wait, we then treated ourselves to some of the best dishes on the menu. \n\nThe Duck Larb - Still a favorite! Little diced pieces of duck combined with cilantro, red onions, and spices in a lime dressing is excellent. We tend to eat it like lettuce-wraps, but that could be just us. \n\nPork Belly - After a whole evening of discussing when we first discovered our love of pork belly dishes--we had to give this one a try! This was not a disappointment--in fact, there was just the right amount of crispness to the pork belly in a spicy sauce. \n\nTom Yum Soup - This was a tad a bit too spicy for me. As much as I enjoy Tom Yum, I could barely taste it over the spice. I will remember to tell them to tone it down next time on the soup. \n\nAs for desserts....\n\nFried Banana with ice cream - The fried bananas were in crispy shells with ice cream on the side. Did I mention there are ice cream choices? Vanilla, Pistachio and Toasted Almond were among some of the choices. We went for Toasted Almond, and it went perfectly with the friend bananas. \n\nCrystal Chestnuts - I've never seen or heard of a dessert like this before, but it showed up on so many foodspotting pics we had to check it out for ourselves. It's a dessert dish with shaved ice and coconut milk with gel-covered chestnuts in the dessert. I actually liked it but I think my friends weren't superfans of it. Once the fried bananas showed up, they were all over that, instead. Whatever! More for me! \n\nAll-in-all a great place for food. As an afterthought, we considered whether it would be a great date place. All things considered, if you're still getting to know each other, it's a little busy and loud to go on one of your first dates, but if you're just there for good food and don't mind a wait, this might work out for you.", "author": "Lorraine D."}

The reality is that Lers Ros is OK at providing meh service and OK food.\n\nMy first major complaint is with whoever is in charge of seating customers. I get that it can be incredibly hard to take down a list of walk-ins and seat guests based on availability. I am super patient and have no issue waiting 20+ minutes to be seated - I get it. What I am not patient towards is when the individual in charge of managing that list seems incapable of doing it correctly. On two separate occasions I have arrived, put my name on the list, and watched as my wait time moved from 20-50 minutes as groups who arrived after me were seated. Both times when I complained I found my name had already been scratched off.\n\nAs for the food - it is just OK. Is it the best Thai food I have ever had, no. Is it worth a 30-40 minute wait in the tenderloin, no. In fact I would say it is comparable to Osha Thai, with the addition of more frog and alligator on the menu. \n\nFinally, they have done a great job making the dining area look great (except for the backless stool tables) - However, I wouldn't recommend using the restrooms.

I'm sure they have delicious options on their menu, and I usually like to compare places based off a common dish i.e. pad thai, but this time I made the mistake of ordering something off their current \"Specials\" menu. Their Lers Ros combo platter was underwhelming for the price, but the most disgusting dish was the garlic pepper rabbit. Something that is considered a delicacy should never be fried to oblivion where you can no longer tell what it is. There was no mention on the menu that it was deep fried and that it had so many bones. There was so little meat in all the fried gunk that Panda Express orange chicken can put this dish to shame. Having more fried gunk than meat is a complete cop-out to hide something that clearly tastes unfresh. I cringingly ate half of it because I was starving and tried to give it a chance. DO NOT ORDER their specials here. Literally one of the most disgusting and laughable excuses for a dish served at a reputable restaurant.

Hands down the most flavorful Tom Kha Gai I've ever had, perfect blend of flavor and spice. Definitely the best green papaya salad I've ever had, many thai places make it so spicy it ruins the rest of your meal. This was spicy but you could still taste the absolutely perfect dressing with salted eggs... Fabulous.\n\nOur local thai restaurant Thai Square has them beat on the red curry with chicken and thai iced tea. The red curry had sliced carrots which I felt added an odd flavor but it was still really good. My husband had Seafood Pad Thai and decided it was the best he's ever had.

First, I'm sure there are those \"scared for my life\" types that will be put off by its T'loin location. Second, this place is slightly more heavy handed in the spice department than other places, so keep that in mind when you order.\n\nIt's hard to differentiate Thai food because from a flavor profile standpoint, there isn't much variation. Ask me what the difference is between Osha and King of Thai, and I'll quickly reply \"price.\" With Lers Ros, there's something about the cooking here that leaves an extra lushness after you take a bite that stands above other Thai restaurants in the City. I guess the equivalent in today's urban lingo would be, and I hope I'm creating a new phrase here, \"flavor swag.\" \n\nI must confess that I've only limited myself to a couple go-to dishes because they're frickin' delicious (hence the four star rating). However a quick survey of the menu clearly shows a wide variety of standard Thai dishes found in any Thai restaurant, and ones truly unique to Lers Ros (i.e. boar, frog). I almost always end up getting chicken Pad Kee Mow and the crispy fried pork belly dish. They just never mess these two dishes up for me. I tried the duck larb that was noted on the most recent edition of the 7x7 list, and they clearly missed the mark by not putting in the crispy fried pork belly. While the duck larb was fine, it had a strong vinegar flavor that made continued eating less and less enticing. \n\n$33 should get you 3 standard entrees. They deliver, so that's also a plus. \n\nOh, and to those \"scared for my life\" types, Lers Ros opened up a location in Hayes Valley.

Their medium was... on a thai level though, which I am okay with since I LOVE spicy things, but something to keep in mind if your palette cannot take spice too well. I'm a soup person so - 5 stars\n\nPork Shoulder Appetizer - SOO delicious, make sure you get this if you like pork shoulder, I would come back again just to get this! It comes with a dipping sauce, but I think it kind of overpowers the pork so I ate most of mine without the dipping sauce and if I used it - I would just use a smidgen to make sure it didn't overkill the pork. This was amazing, do order! - 5 stars\n\nPad Kee Mao with Beef (Medium Spicy) - This was good as well, with most places the proportion of noodles to meat is often heavy on the noodles side and barely any meat. At Lers Ros, I would almost say the beef to noodle ratio was even. This was great in my opinion since I'm trying to cut back on the carbs. -5 stars\n\nReally glad we stumbled upon this place, I will have to take note to come back here soon!\n\nHandy Tip:\nI think their spice levels are a little skewed towards the spicy side so make sure your take that into consideration when you're ordering. Also, I read in some other reviews that there was a long wait for them, try coming on Sundays for lunch! Even when we were leaving at about 12:30 ish there was still no wait.", "author": "Melissa L."}

Beware of the chopped chilies they have in there, they're extremely spicy! The portion of the noodles was perfect for 2 hungry people or 3 portion-controlled eaters. The flavor was on point, but I could've done with a little bit less vegetables. \n\nThe soup was delicious, and although we ordered medium spicy for both items, the soup was much less spicy. We got our tofu fried and it was delicious. Make sure to order the \"a la carte\" option for the soup if you want to share. \n\nThe service was good and the food was served pretty quickly.

Papaya salad had good spice but too salty and drenched with dressing.  Had to hold up each bite for awhile before eating.  Fried pork did not looked fried and very salty.  Perhaps the server took the wrong order but hard to imagine since I was pointing out the number on the menu. Steamed sea bass was cooked well with nice spice however once again too salty and killed the real taste of the fish.  At $32 price tag, I expect better.  Green curry was the best part of the meal.

I rarely have great things to say about food places, but I have to tip my hat to Lers Ros, it's got great food.\n\nOne thing I'm very unhappy about is their reservations. Two or three times I've asked to make a reservation for two, and they insisted that it wasn't busy and to just come in (I live close by).

Not sure how I managed not to know about Lers Ros given my love of Thai food, but so glad it's now on my radar!!  The food is unbeatable.  So much \"flame\" in it's Thai dishes!  And so much of it.  Price appear higher than some Thai places in the city -- but portions are much bigger.\n\nA few of my table (presumably Thai newbies) ordered generic dishes like Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and Broccoli Beef which were good -- but I would recommend trying something more unique so you can taste what Lers Ros has to offer above your normal Thai takeout place.  Consider doing family style.  The menu is a bit insane and it'd take a while to try it all, but what we had I loved:\n--Garlic Quail ($10) -- like a teeny tiny bucket of KFC, but extra miniature and covered in garlic goodness.  Not much meat here, but oh so tasty.\n--Papaya salad with raw crabs ($10) - yes raw, and no I didn't know you can eat crab raw either.  But it tasted like a yummy Thai ceviche.  \n--Crispy Pork (not sure where it is on the menu or costs, but it was amazing) Basically super fatty and yummy crispy pork \"Siu Yok\" in a chili sweet basil sauce.  a MUST get.\n--Whole fried Tilapia with house chili sauce ($16) -- giant fish served whole and fried, covered in a tangy chili sauce.  Very fresh.  Lots of bones to navigate but well worth it.\n\nStaff was attentive though at times seemed a bit overwhelmed and scattered.  I think the restaurant has a few more tables than it should, as I got my share of back bumps  from those heading to the washroom.   And hopefully they'll considered a coat check at some point since the stool seats forces you to hold your coats and get all kinds of yummy sauces on them...

The menu is very extensive which makes it kinda hard to decide what to get. Customer service is great, they greet you and try to accommodate you if you don't have a reservation. I had a party of 5 which was odd for their tables because they mostly fit 4 unless you combine some tables, but they asked if I would mind having a seat on the side, which was fine by me. Throughout the experience, they always had someone check up on us to see if we needed more water or napkins. What impressed me is that since I had a seat blocking the way of some other tables, they always walked around to fill water or supply napkins without inconveniencing me. \n\nI love spicy foods so this place is perfect, if you aren't I would suggest to you to express your spicy level otherwise you won't be able to enjoy the food. My party couldn't take the spicy-ness of the seafood soup, so I ended up drinking it all hahah... \n \nIf you have a large group, you better make reservations otherwise you can expect to wait at least 30mins and don't complain. I love how this place takes reservations when other places are good but have a small seating area and don't take reservations. As good as they are, I don't like to wait to be seated when I'm with a large group.\n\nLast off, I work in the customer service field and a Thai customer of mine agreed with me that Lers Ros is one of the best and it's hard to find really good Thai Restaurants, so give this place a try!

Or maybe it's just me.\n\nIt was a casual dinner with my friends and I thought that I would have to order my usual Pad See Ew. Nope! Browsing through the menu, I discovered a couple of exotic dishes featuring meats like rabbit and alligator! One thing I love about eating is trying new and unusual dishes!\n\nWe went for the Red Curry, Stewed Pork Leg and the Pad Ped Alligator. The Red Curry was well-executed with good consistency flavor. The Stew Pork Leg was served on a bed of assorted vegetables ranging from simple greens and pickled vegetables. The pork was very juicy and moist as was the skin of the leg. Even so, the skin and fat could be somewhat overwhelming on its own unless eaten with something else like the rice or vegetables. The gator was quite an adventure! From the looks, you might think it's pork or dark chicken meat. The texture is similar to pork, but the flavor is funky. In a way, it's gamey and has a flavor of where its been. The chili peppers doesn't really help with masking that gaminess, but it's good in its own way. \n\nThe service was efficient and friendly. No problems there.

That accompanied by rice and coconut milk soup with shrimp completed a meal that made me feel like finally, there was a restaurant that understood the true meaning of authenticity.

Like, I honestly don't know what it is about this place.  It looks normal enough but then there is the odd, neat little decorative things that stand out from the normal Thai experience.  I hesitate to call it 'Americanized', but you'll know what I mean.\n\nI don't remember exactly what I ate but it tasted so fresh and the menu was so non-traditional I was really blow away by the choices they offered.

The food is just consistently awesome, and the menu has amazing options.\n\nMy top picks:\n\n*Papaya salad with prawns (keep in mind, even when you ask for mild here, it will still burn your mouth!  But they give you a big chunk of cabbage to chew on to help ease your fiery mouth, it really helps actually)\n\n*Yum Woon Sen - silver noodle salad with dried shrimps, mushrooms, peanuts and ground pork (its da bomb, and mild will also burn your mouth)\n\n*Pad See Ew - always delicious, the chinese broccoli is crunchy, and the noodles are perfectly seasoned\n\n*Green Curry - they use Thai eggplants, which are a small green circular vegetable, and I love them! my only complaint is that they don't put more of those in the curry. I usually get it with chicken or pork.\n\n*Clams - I've never seen clams on a thai menu before but these ones are good! They have a unique thai flavor to them.\n\n*Fried tilapia or sea bass - they serve you a whole fish (bone included) and its always super tasty.  I tried the steamed sea bass last time, and i think the fried is better\n\n*Pork belly with rind - everyones favorite, its just so damn good\n\nSoups:\nUnfortunately i am not a big fan of their Tom Yum or Tom Kha, i think they are way too salty.\nTheir noodle soups are really good though, they are in a different part of the menu than the other soups.  Reminds me of noodle soups I would order on the street in Thailand.\n\nEnjoy!!!", "author": "Liz C."}

One of the truly great things about Lers Ros is that it is open until midnight, and when I arrived, slightly after 10:30p, there were quite a few tables for that time of night still occupied.  I sat at the bar.  I chatted in my pigeon-Thai with the servers and asked them if they could prepare vegetarian food for me (without fish sauce, without oyster sauce, and without MSG).  I knew they could; I've read the reviews.  I also wanted to know whether they could make the food really spicy, as I'm a sucker for spice.\n\nAt the direction of my server, I ordered the Por Pia Tod Jay (vegetarian fried spring rolls) and the Pad Kee Mao (sometimes referred to as \"Drunken Noodles\").  The spring rolls were impressively plump, served piping hot, and full of a lot of ingredients other than just noodles and cabbage.  There was a staleness to the flavor, however (I'm not suggesting they weren't fresh, but maybe the oil was overdue to be changed?).  The sauce didn't taste homemade either, as it was too artificially sweet.  I wouldn't likely order them again, but in theory, they could be good.\n\nThe Pad Kee Mao was super greasy.  There were a good amount of vegetables in the dish -- which I liked -- and the portion was large, but it was just so damn greasy.  I compare it to recent noodle dishes I recently had a two Thai restaurants in Los Angeles (Bulan Thai and Bodhi Thai), and the amount of grease was striking.  Can't say I'd order that again either.  I may try -- particularly if it's a late night and nothing else is open -- a curry or a spicy basil tofu dish should I ever return, but I can't say that this was a particularly memorable outing.  In fact, it was exactly on par with all of the other overrated greasy Thai joints that pepper the Bay Area but that everyone seems to love so much.  I ate at three different Thai restaurants during my latest visit to Los Angeles, and while each had its shortcomings, each was more satisfying and less greasy than my experience here at Lers Ros.\n\nI'm kinda bummed.  I would have liked to have finally found a go-to Thai place.  I haven't been to Modern Thai in quite some time and I've only tried Marnee Thai and Thai Idea once.  I wonder how those would stack up should I revisit.  \n\nFor now, Lers Ros is only going to be a late-night Union Square/Tenderloin backup, should I need to get a later-night fix on Thai delights.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Back then, there were a big buzz around Thai community about this place and how \"Exotic\" their food were (they indeed had a lot of Thai Exotic foods in their menu). But once I tried  their food, I really felt that they were  just OK for me, not super bad but I really had better Thai food  from other Thai places. \n\n   Months later when another friend of mine (who had not tried this place yet) also wanted to come to this place, first I refused base on my first experience but I decided to give them a second chance since by then I had read a lot positive reviews about this place and thought that they had changed or  improved their food. On that day, we ordered a lot of food as my friends intended to take the left over for her next meals. And once we tasted the food that we ordered, I realized that nothing had changed around here.Especially a fish disc that we ordered was so salty, we could not eat it. At the end, my friend decided  not to take any left over home.\n\n    Their service was pretty good but for me, as a Thai,  It' s all about the food. I always have my own high standard for Thai food.

Fortunately, my phone is GENIUS and I have the yelp app.\n\nLow and behold, we discover Lers Ros Thai on the app.  It was within walking distance of our horrendous abode (Rodeway Inn, if your curious mind must know).  The walk through the TL to our destination was less sketch than anticipated.  It was well, well worth it.  I can't even explain how eating at this restaurant on night one of our ten day road trip from SD to SEA completely set the stage for awesomeness but it did.\n\nFirst off, the prices are fantastic for a city like San Francisco.  My friend and I were delightfully full when we left and spent only a whopping $34.61 before tip.  Secondly, the staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful.  The ambiance was pleasant as was the music (ambient and well-fitting to the place without being overly loud and drowning out the conversation my friend and I were having).  \n\nBeing the pseudo vegetarian that I am, I ordered the spicy tofu with rice (#46R).  The tofu was crisped and tossed with chili, peppers, garlic, bamboo shoots and basil.  I am a huge fan of fresh basil. My carnivorous friend ordered Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62R), which is pork belly with crisped rind and basil leaves.  Both entrees were under $10 each.  Sapporo and sake for two completed the meal for a very nominal price.\n\nThe menu is extensive - 10 pages online alone - so there is definitely something for everyone's palate if you are even remotely a lover of Thai food.

My lips were tingly and on the verge of burning so it was perfect.\n\nEntrees:\nPad Kee Mao with Chicken and  \nKoong Kra Prow( Prawns stir-fried with BASIL and hot chili sauce) were great.  \n\nThe Kee Mao came with a side of fresh bean sprouts so that was tasty to mix together.

I know I would appreciate a list like this because the other day I came here, their menu confused me - there was just way too much writing and different types of food):\n- tom yum goong soup: typical soup that all Thai places will offer, but this one here will burn your tongue and stomach, but in the end, you will undoubtedly think it was worth the pain, cause it's just THAT good, I tell you.\n- fried rice: listen to me and order this and tell them you want it with brown rice. Remember to ask for brown rice and you will not forget their fried rice\n- stir fried pork belly: so fatty and delicious. This one's my favorite - everything about it is just great \n- catfish in spicy sauce: don't know the exact name, but this one is a must have - again, it's hot hot hot, but too good to miss out on\n\nBefore I forget, make sure you grab a handful of the candies they have before leaving because they are so good! Guava flavored candies - I think I ate 10 of them in 15 minutes haha\n\nYou can skip dessert here, because their sticky rice with mango isn't too great - there was only like...4 pieces of mango. Not worth it.\nBut if you must, go ahead and order the fried banana with toasted almond ice cream (I highly recommend this flavor especially if you're tired of the plain old vanilla ice cream but is not feeling too adventurous to try other bolder flavors).\nTotal bill for our party of 6 came up to $120ish and that was for dinner. Everyone left feeling full and content, so all is well. \nOh, the only downside is their music playlist - they'd play Benny Benassi's Cinema, Aviici's Levels, etc, which... doesn't quite suit the whole Thai atmosphere, but I guess that's okay. And the waitresses don't speak English very well, so it was kind of confusing when she repeated our orders.", "author": "Melissa S."}

There's a Thai place on the corner we're thinking about patronizing...until we see it only has three stars on Yelp (lots of one-star reviews).  I trust the hip SF Yelpers, so a quick search for \"Thai delivery\" brings up Lers Ros Thai.  Free delivery over $15?  Yes please!\n\nPlusses:\nAlthough they didn't tell us when the food would arrive over the phone, everything arrived within 40 minutes (around 6 p.m. on a Saturday night).  The food was well packaged, we could pay with a credit card over the phone and add a tip on the receipt, and we got 4 dishes a la carte for under $50 (including tip).\n\nTofu was steamed or braised with the curry, not separately fried or added in, which was tasty and healthy to boot.  Also, all the packaging except the delivery bag was recyclable.\n\nMinuses/things to note:\nThe rice plates are a half portion of food with rice, and the a la carte plates are the full portion of the entree without rice.  The default level of spice is quite spicy, even for folks like us used to spicy food.  Might want to let them know your preference when you order.\n\nLike many places, they repeated our credit card over the phone in the restaurant as we told it to them.  Oh well!\n\nOverall:\nThe menu is extremely varied, so props to them for that, and Lers Ros also makes good (and spicy) renditions of Thai stand-bys like green curry.

With over 100 dishes on the menu, this is definitely a late night repeat.\n\nKoh Moo Yang: Most slow roasted pork comes in the form of stringy pulled pork.  This one came in slices that looked tough, but were still melt in your mouth soft.  They described the dipping sauce as simply chili powder sauce, but it was so much more complex than that!\n\nPad Kra Prow Moo Krob: I am so sick of Asian joints that serve mushy pork belly.  This was chicharr\u00f3n crispy even after absorbing all the awesome base sauce.  I think there were some veggies too, but totally forgot them when having all this better-than-bacon dish.\n\nPad Thai: Had to try this because it is the one dish guaranteed to be at any Thai restaurant.  It wasn't as sticky and peanut buttery as at lesser restaurants.  The spices and sauces were great and I liked how there were so many fresh bean sprouts on the side.\n\nKaeng Som Cha-Om Khai Tod: I like to call this an omelet soup.  I don't think I've ever had acacia in anything before so it was a nice treat to have it in these egg squares.   The tamarind and chili broth was full of flavor and spice.  Perfect for me, but too spicy for my dining companion.  The bland green beans were a good contrast.\n\nSticky Rice with Durian: It didn't make me puke!

Actually except for one that's why I give 4.5 stars.  I tried the pork belly dish as recommended by you Yelpers.  The flavor was good, but the fried prok belly was not fresh, it hurt my teeth.  Now I know when it's freshly fried coz I'm familiar with lechon kawali a Philippine dish, some yummy goodness.  I give credit to them for the good flavor though.\n\nAs for the rest of the food, awesome!  Flavor was great!  Although I was satisfied that they don't have panang beef, the other curry satisfied me well.  Good portions and quick service.  I would actually compare this to Marnee Thai, yea shoot me!  I go to Marnee Thai for their wings and panang beef, but over here... I'd go for whatever they have.  They have so many choices I'd like to try.  Plus the parking isn't bad here, it's easier to find parking, although, the neighborhood can be iffy.  Oh yea I think it's cheaper here too.\n\nThe inside is nice but crowded.  I was sitting very close to the next table.  You actually won't know what the restaurant name is until you come close, coz I believe it's in Thai writing.

I was spoiled with good authentic Thai food by my friend Thanya Suwansawaad who owned Thanya & Salee on Potrero Hill.  Since she sold the biz my jones for real Thai only gets satisfied when I get invited to Thanya's home.  Well, sorry Thanya... not anymore.  \n\nI'm lovin' Lers Ros... in the heart of the 'Loin we have a clean, efficient, somewhat trendy (let's get a makeover team there and make it HOT!), that serves some straight up great Thai.  The first time I went was alone on a Saturday afternoon:  needed to have Yum Pla Dook Foo and did a Yelp search, resulting in Lers Ros.  The dish is pounded, shredded catfish filet, deep friend and served atop lettuce with a side of spicy lime/fish sauce dressing. Oh my. Delish.  Only comment from me is that I think the chef should julienne the red bell pepper into thinner strips.  Less bulky, more subtle and attractive that way, pairing the julienned green mango.  \n\nI also had the garlic fried quail. Ooooh.... little crunchable tasties.  I felt like Southeast Asian royalty daintily biting the little bird meat of the bones. Simple, fried, tasty, served with a typical sweet spicy sauce.  Not wanting to leave without another favorite in tow, I ordered the Thai home-made suausage appetizer to go:  slices of sausage on the bias, served with slivers of ginger and red onion, tiny lime wedges, peanuts, Thai pepper bits... pile all on top of your sausage slice and pop in da mout, brah! OMG.\n\nSo last night, I returned with my partner and a good friend and the three of us ordered the same apps as above on my reommendation and for dinner we had the pork belly with crispy rind stir fry, the Thai style spare rib sautee, and beef larb (which is usally a starter).  As my friend and I are both Filipino, we took to the pork belly like, well, Filipinos to pork. It was similar to our lechon kawali and oh so tasty.  The larb was good chopped sirloin, not lazy ground beef like you might find in less reputed Thai restaurants.  My anglo partner got the ribs dish as he wasn't sure about the pork belly (but after so many years together with a Pinoy, you know he couldn't say no to da pig).  \n\nWe got there around 6 pm.  In less than an hour the place was packed with a waiting line to boot.  We shared the traditional fried banana with toasted almond ice cream.  Four large rounds of fried banana a generous scoop of ice cream... large enough to definitely be shared by four people, each to have a mouthful!  They have an interesting selection of ice creams as well, including pistachio! \n\nToday, I'm hoping to try out the whole trout, fried and sauteed in a chili sauce since that was out-voted last night.

It came out with four dumpling size crispy curry flavored \"pillows of wonder\", a small dish of the peanut sauce, and a small dish of some sort of pickled cucumber that was also very good. (get extra peanut sauce, it's very good on steamed rice!!)\nNext came dinner. My wife had Tofu Curry Veggies, and I had the Spicy Chili Talapia. Ok... So I panicked...I was still reading the review from \"Janice C\" who was raving about the Talapia when the waitress arrived. I ordered it before I finished reading. I didn't realize the whole fish would soon be on the plate....just sitting there....smiling at me. It was actually was fairly good however, but I usually don't prefer to work that hard for my meal, picking thru the bones....I would have preferred a filet.\n\nThe service in this place was outstanding. They were all about refilling the water and checking up on you. It thought it a tad funny that the minute your paper napkin became \"soiled\" they were right there giving you a new one!! I was a tiny bit self conscious...the waitresses are all just kind of standing there....watching you...ya know...eat. You know the feeling...when someone you DON'T know is watching you eat....it's like \"what\"??!!!\n\nWe didn't stay for dessert as I was in search of a good gellato (see my Naia review) I can't speak to that area. The total bill for the two of us with the drinks came to about $50 with tip, about average for a decent restaurant. I would probably return here if I lived in the area, but there are a whole lotta other places to try in the ci-tay (ala Steve Perry) and in the end I gave it four out of five stars.", "author": "David C M."}

In terms of the Thai flavors I enjoy (spicy + sour.. aka Thai food from the Eesan region), Lers Ros HITS THE SPOT on my taste buds. I can't even.. Already drooling just thinking about it--and I went there over 3 weeks ago. Oy oy oy.\n\nMy cousin (thankyouthankyouthankyou for introducing me) brought me here.. although the location isn't too grand, it makes this gem stand out even more. Okay, I'm really trying not to exaggerate, but I almost never get to eat food like \"Kaw Mu Yang\". KAW freakin MU YANG. The last time I had that was either a) in Thailand or b) at home.\n\nKaw mu yang: WONDERFUL. This is the one dish that I for once did not feel bad about devouring all those not-so-healthy lipids because it was that delicious. \n\nSom Tum Kai Khem (salty egg papaya salad)-never tried this version of som tum before, but the salty egg was a very interesting contrast to the effing spicy/sour taste. \n\nSticky rice:  warm, chewy, deeeeericious.\n\nGai Yang: Sooooo gooooood. Juicy and seasoned very well. Took it togo, and it was still good when I ate the rest at home.\n\nHungry.. again. If I'm pretty much dead-tired while writing this Yelp review, it must mean something.. right? Shoot, I'm hella hungry now. Thanks a lot, Lers Ros. No, REALLY. THANKS.\n\nOn a side note, the interior was modern-ish, and the plates were funky (white AND black AND a bit of red?).

The seasoning of the dish was good; the problem was, some of the seasoning should have been taken out.  What I mean is, there were pieces of bay leaf and the dish included galingale, which was good for flavoring but not so pleasant to eat. I kept having to pick these things out.

I usually ask for recommendations, and the servers always seem to know their food.\n\nI also had durian sticky rice as dessert. OMG, where else can I find durian?

It is a nicer sit down place, not hole in the wall, and the portions are large -- my friend and I both went home with leftovers (I got the eggplant tofu, she got tom kha with tofu). The tom kha was reallllly good, they have a really good variety of mushrooms in it, not just button like at some cheaper places. Decently spicy -- I like it when tom kha has the whole chilis floating in it oozing red, and this definitely had it. We showed up just in time to not wait and they even nicely reseated us quickly when a third person showed up. It was surprisingly crowded for a Monday night so be aware.

The wait is long if you dine in especially on thurs-fri night. For apps I always get the Thai herb sausage. Curries are fantastic and they are very generous with the meat in their curry dishes. I also love the garlic quail and basil clams. I recommend the last 2 for takeout because it can get pretty messy. Seating is not the most comfortable because it's all very low seating on small stools. If you're a large person you may not be that comfortable eating here. Service is very friendly.

Sure I know many won't give it five stars because of the atmosphere, locale, etc...but really great food is really great food and I have to give it up for this place. This is as real as it gets outside of Thailand. I travel all the time, have eaten in Thailand and live in NYC. Thai food is not a cuisine that impresses me unless it's something special. Since I do not live in SanFrancisco I have only been here twice but it knocked me out both times!\n\nHere are the things I don't think you should miss:\n\nThe dishes:\n\n1) Papaya Salad w/salted Egg- seasoned perfectly and the right ingredients..ex. real palm sugar, the SE asia thin green beans. the salted egg was amazing....prepared in a way that all the moisture was extracted which gave a consistency like cheese!\n\n2) Garlic and Ginger Rice- as far as i could tell it was simply steamed rice but mixed lightly toasted garlic and lightly sauteed ginger leaves(or stems maybe) that is a little more subtle and fragrant than using the root which gave it a little oily richness but with a nice smokey, nuttiness from the garlic. So simple and amazing yet so different..\n\n3) Whole Sea Bass in Lime and Chili- (check the picture, I have it as my profile picture...it say's it all!!) I almost feel like I don't have to say anything if it wasn't so mind blowing! On the menu the guarantee that the fish is fresh each day...they didn't lie. Comes out basically cooking in this broth of lime and other juices that I believe are just created with the various herbs that are in there like whole sections of lemon grass, slices of garlic, what looks like the top parts and leaves of celery stalks but may be some other herb that i'm not recognizing, chili and some other things minced that may also be pre-sauteed because there is a little oil in the broth all mixed with the natural fish juices. Comes out cooking in that stuff and just the smell knocks you out. It's like a whole fish in a SE Asia bouillabaisse. As you eat the fish you can and remove the bones and drink the soup...it's crazy good! and spoon some of that garlic ginger rice in there...oh man!! \n\n4)Tom Yum Soup- a classic but an amazing version. super fresh lemongrass. lime leaf and galangal and a fresh Thai mushroom that i had to look up because i never have seen it before called \"hed lom\" or \"wind mushroom\"...the stuff is obviously imported but how it's so fresh i don't know...? maybe the old couple in the kitchen grow the stuff or something..??\n\n\nSomewhat of a hidden gem in SF I believe.

We got the chicken satay, thai herb sausage, and some appetizer special puffs.  Although they weren't bad, they were indistinguishable from any other restaurant.  If you must have them, go ahead but there won't be any wow factor.\n \n * The same hold true for the curries.  I would go so far as to say you may want to avoid them.  The curries are missing that pleasing blend of sour (lime), sweet and hot.  Instead they rely mostly on creamy (coconut) and sweet.\n\n* The Larb Moo is okay, but like I said in my original review, not as good as Ozone Thai.  It suffers from the same flavor profile problems as the curry.  My Thai friend was really not impressed.\n\n\nRecommend to order:\n\n* Any soups.  Last time we ordered the Tom Kreang Nai and despite the oddness of the entrails (which I tried not to think about) it was delicious.  The same goes for the less stomach churning Tom Yum Koong.

I would order it again. The pork belly really is that good. The piece of the fried pork rind is chewy and full of porky deliciousness. #62, people! Eight dollars. So good. \n\nVery attentive service. Apparently Thai women are very high up on the list of efficient people. Their goal is to get you super-tasty Thai food super-fast. Which, last night, was mission accomplished. \n\nCivic Center Bart Station. Raw Crab Papaya Salad. Pork Belly with Basil.

I was very surprised when I got the dish: #25) a chunk of roasted duck mixed with rice powder, chili powder and lime based salad dressing, along with some leafy lettuce, basil, cilantro, red onions, scallions and a couple of hot peppers thrown in. It tasted like an explosion of flavor in my mouth! The lime dressing aroma was something you definitely couldn't miss!\n\nI think if I could pick a favorite 7x7 item, this might just be it. And I've already done 67 of them out of 100!\n\nOn a non-food note, this place is also a good place to come to with very good customer service and a very clean restaurant.

My friends insisted that this place has amazing food. Considering he is my Northern California food guide, I went with him to indulge. The place is found in the Tenderloin district, which is not the nicest part of the neighborhood. The restaurant was fairly empty since we got there around 6pm, before the big dinner rush. This place is nicer than your average hole in the wall joint, it's clean and it has some flat screens where they are usually playing sports. \n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\nKoh Moo Yang\nTom Kha Kai\nKao Na Phed\n\nThe first course was Koh Moo Yang, which is grilled slices of pork shoulder, served with a chili powder sauce. Let me tell you, this dish is very, very tasty. The pork is juicy and is ultra tender. Dipping it in the chili powder sauce adds to the taste. SO GOOD! I would have been happy with just this one dish, but there were two more on the way!\n\nUp next was the Tom Kha Kai, a coconut milk based soup with chicken , lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. One popular Thai dish that I really don't like is Tom Yum Gai, and based on it's standard description of spicy, sour, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf chicken soup, sounds very similar to Tom Kha Kai. I was very skeptical about trying this dish with my severe dislike for Tom Yum Gai, but what the hey, I was on vacation and up for anything. To my surprise, this soup was yummy. It was a mix between a panang curry and tom yum gai, and the combination of the two was deilcious. I forgot to take a picture when it first came out due to it being so tasty so the half eaten shot below was all I could get!\n\nOur last dish of the night was the five spices duck over rice, served with chili and vinegar sauce, or otherwise known as: Kao Na Phed . At this point, I'm stuffed, but I had to make room for at least a bite of this. I only had one piece, but the one piece I had was perfect. The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. Another dish you just cannot go wrong with. \n\nAll in all, another highly recommended San Francisco gem.

I didn't think Lers Ros need any more comment about its food. the food selection on menu alreay shows us how real this place is\n\nanyway,  advices here for all yelpers to enjoy eating at Lers Ros\n\nTake yourself away from your comfort zone...skip Pad Thai,Pad Kee Mao, Tom Yum and Curries (except duck red curry, THIS ONE IS DONE DEAL FOR ME. SO GOOD!!)-- go for roast duck laab--Tom  zap , BBQ pork shoulder, any fish related dishes are all good to go for...or ask them which dishes Thais ordered the most...\n\nThais don't do individual plate for person ( except noodles) ..we share a la carte or main dishes..If you have entier curry bowl or entier plate of food by yourself.they would be too much for one to handle with those greasiness and rich texture...why?!?!..because Thai foods were born to be HEAVY...healthy==maybe but not in way you want to experience THai food...and simple to understand the concept:\n\nif we want something crispy--ok sir no broiling or baking..deep fried all the way..if you want curry--don't worry, please put as much as coconut milk to make it rich and thick...if you want stir fly or saute meals..please  make it sweet/salty or sour as much as you want. just make sure it's strong enough that they would not lose the flavor when I have it with rice...\n\nhope this comment is useful and yes...Ler Ros is the best choice now", "author": "Yada S."}

Some good and some not so good.  \n\nI came here a couple of weeks with a pretty large group, so we got to try a bunch of stuff on the menu. \n\nWe started off with the tom kha kai soup. \nI thought this was really good.  There was the nice background of lemongrass and some spiciness.  Be careful though, we had a person at our table eat an actual piece of lemongrass, which was not a good idea.  Hilarious when it someone else eats eat, but you don't want it to be you.\n\nI think the best things on the menu were the pad see ew and the pad kee mao. The pad see ew was slightly sweet and soy-saucy.  The pad kee mao had a nice burn and a good assortment of veggies in it.\n\nThe pad thai was nice and fresh, but I felt like something was missing in it. Maybe not enough acid? Still trying to figure it out. Not the best I've had, but still solid.\n\nWe had several of the meat dishes as well including the ribs, but the taste of those all were pretty similar to me. All pretty equally tasty.\n\nI would avoid the papaya salad with the raw prawn.  It had a lot of potential, but it had that old fishy taste to it.  Too bad because it really did look good.  If you don't like sweet, the yellow curry is also one to stay away from.  I think a lot of people at the table liked this one, but I wasn't really into it.  It was hard to taste anything beside sugar in this dish.\n\nService was efficient and friendly.  This place is pretty busy, and they know how to move people and out without being rude or annoying.  I think I would venture this way again if I were in the neighborhood but wouldn't make a special trip this way.", "author": "Jumi Y."}

I went with kai yang and stir fried pork. The kai yang is generously portioned and well seasoned but unfortunately dried out.  The stir-fried pork was dry and too sweet. I opt for sticky rice but was deeply disappointed by how dried up it was. it tasted like leftover rice that they just microwaved for me.\n\nthe Mrs. ordered the tom yum noodle which came surprisingly under-seasoned.  it was not spicy at all, as in a 0 on a spice scale of 5.  \n\ntrying to save our lunch experience, I throw up a hail mary and asked for shrimp paste. to our surprised, the waitress responded kindly (with the oh you know nam phrik kapi?) look.  she came back with a plate of stinking good shrimp paste hot sauce and we thought we were making a comeback out of this lunch!\n\nthen I got greedy, feeling the heart beat I want to go for two to win it with an order of pad kee mao.  we were excited, we were ready to finish with a bang only to see the flat noodle embarrassed itself with a fumble in front of the end zone.  it was terrible, overly sweet and borderline uneatable as if the chef accidently drop half a bottle of sweet soy sauce in it. \n\nwe left with disappointment, wondering what this could've been.  then I started questioning myself, is it me? maybe I need to do better with the play calling.  looking at pictures of duck larb, crispy pork, fried whole fish, I wonder maybe we just came at the wrong time and ordered the wrong food.\n\nI should not have gave in to yelp hype and probably not even Michelin hype.  the lunch menu items were very underwhelming.

That's a pretty hefty statement.  I stand by it.  Even Van Damme couldn't keep me away with a split kick to the head.  I've been here a ton of times, and the food is consistently good.  I think I've actually gotten tired of the pork belly, I've ordered it that many times.  Their grilled pork shoulder is amazing( I think it's actually pork neck).  The fried trout is another must have, you can eat the whole thing, head spine, and fins.  They have an amazing pork liver salad with that sour thai marinade, if you're into offal.  It's not on the menu, so you'd have to request it.  \n\nFor the d-bags that rate this place on a long delivery time (who the hell orders tofu and curry chicken from an authentic Thai place anyways, live a little and try something new, perhaps one of the dishes that countless Yelpers recommend, instead of boring Thai staples that farangs always order.

We ordered the shrimp fried rice. It was nicely done and very spicy. If you can't eat spicy food then order extra white rice on the side and mixed the fried rice on your own to tone down the spiciness.  I loved this fried rice.\n\nWe also ordered the sea bass and it was nicely done. I'm very picky when it comes to seafood. It's gotta be fresh, well seasoned and not dried. This dish got it all! The meat is white, which means it's fresh. The sauce is very tasty with a good kick of spiciness and lemon flavor but not too strong to cover up all the seafood taste. Finally the fish just cooked to the perfection that it is just cooked and moist in the sauce/soup. Very nice.\n\nAt last we tried the sticky rice and mango. Very standard and simple dish. I personally do not like desserts and I think that dish is good and I would order it again with friends. The sticky rice texture is a bit watery and we were in doubt at first.

I had the appetizer ribs (hard to eat, fried to a leathery exterior) the admittedly touristic sweet and sour pork (not their crowning glory) and the utterly average cucumber salad. It was all ok, but nothing to write home to Bangkok about. It would definitely be the best Thai restaurant in Kingsburg, though. \n\nThis is the second Thai restaurant in town about which all knowing white people have assured me that their never identified \"Thai friends\" swear it  is just like home.

Asking for extra Costco paper napkins, which are handed over with great reluctance and only  after a vigorous investigation, is like asking the Turkish government to admit the Armenian Genocide.

Needless to say, I was besides myself when I saw the Garlic Frog, alligator, rabbit, and boar!\n\nAlthough my sister has dined in here several times, he never ventured in trying unfamiliar items so, with his saying, \"get whatever you like,\" I decided the Garlic Frog ($9.95) was going to be a good starter in helping him branch out his taste buds. I didn't want to overwhelm him by ordering other \"exotic\" food items. He did like it even though there were minor complaints. I didn't care because I got him to taste something different which he ended up liking. We also ordered chicken satay ($7.95); chicken was juicy and tender; KRA DOOK MOO PAD PED (Tender Pork Spare Ribs $13.95) which was absolutely delicious and satisfying, with brown rice. \n\nFor drinks, we ordered the HANA-KOHAKU \"PLUM SAKE\" ($15.00) which we shared with each other. I could have easily consumed it by myself, but, I didn't want to be a \"lush\" as he often accusingly calls me. \n\nThe food was so good and I guess my appetite was quite big that night that all of the food was gone; even so much that the waitress outwardly commented on my healthy appetite. Of course, she did it behind my back and told my sister. Regardless, the clean plates were an indication of how yummy their food was. I definitely would come back. \n\nThe service was pretty good but then again, it was near closing, and there weren't too many other diners...\n\nThey close at 11pm so if you happen to be craving up-scale Thai food that you can't find anywhere else, do come here and make yourself comfortable!", "author": "Doc V."}

We were able to find parking about a block away. Just make sure not to leave anything valuable in your car as you are parked in the Tenderloin.. We waited about 10-15 minutes to be seated as the restaurant was packed. As I was scrolling through the menu, I noticed that they had alligator and rabbit listed. I was debating on whether to get it or not, but decided to change my mind and not take the risk as I may not like it. We decided to share the Pork Belly, Roasted Duck Curry, and the Sticky Rice with Mango for dessert. The pork belly reminded me of the roast pork I eat at home. It was a bit salty and dry at the same time, while other pieces were crispy. Nonetheless, the dish was a really big portion. For the roasted duck curry, I wish there were more pieces of the duck. The curry was pretty decent. I was just way too full that I barely ate any of the sticky rice with mango. There was so much sticky rice! It was pretty yummy and authentic.

Amazing!\" Boy, did I get the experience from Lers Ros Thai and NOT a good one.\n\nI ordered for delivery, a very small order for 2 people which consisted of 1 appetizer and 2 entrees. It took 1 HOUR & 22 MINUTES (yes, I timed it) to get delivery. \n\nWhen I made the order the woman on the phone said said, \"15 minutes for delivery.\" I even repeated what she said, \"You said FIFTEEN minutes? Really?\" And she said, \"Yes 15 minutes delivery.\" An hour later I call and she says, \"No, I said 50 minutes. It can take anywhere from 50 minutes to 1 hour and half.\" Um, if that was the biggest crock of sh*t I had ever heard from anyone as far as delivery time goes. It's not like we live very far from the location, I can drive to their location in less than 10 minutes.\n\nI called back twice within that 1 HOUR & 22 MINUTES that I was waiting for my food (once at the 45 MINUTE mark and second at the 1 HOUR mark), she didn't seem to know what she was doing. \"Just wait another 5-10 minutes they will be there.\" - Second call - \"Just wait another 5-10 minutes.\" What is this a canned response when you don't know what is going on with your delivery person?\n\nThe guy finally arrived. Seemed like a decent sort and was relatively apologetic. But seemed to blame it on other things rather than his own punctuality. Now, I understand that sometimes things go wrong, but a call would have been a nice courtesy, \"Hey, we'll be a bit longer...\" If they had done that they would have gotten a 3.\n\nNow lets talk about the food.\n\nMy food was gross - I asked for VERY SPICY and I got mild. The tofu was barely cooked and the portions were scanty. My boyfriend liked his yellow chicken curry. It tasted decent over rice. \n\nThe appetizer, was gross. The fried tofu tasted hardly fried by the time we got it. It was soggy and rubbery. \n\nI'd be willing to go to the location itself but not order for delivery.

There is a daily lunch special menu, FYI, but nothing totally appealed that day. We settled on papaya salad, golden fried tofu with some kind of crack-based dipping sauce, basil shrimp and tom ka soup with chicken. The soup was by far the most outstanding - the flavors were spicy and complex, and the coconut wasn't overwhelming or heavy which often happens in this dish. My only regret was that we didn't have a place to store leftovers, otherwise I totally would have been taking everything to my home sweet hotel.\n\nService can be....leisurely....so if you're in a hurry, you best let them know and that might help.

Here are the memorable hits and misses:\n\nPad kra prow moo krob: Their famous pork belly dish. I was really excited about this dish b/c it seemed like a thai version of lechon kawali (Filipino deep fried pork belly). Lers Ros takes this dish a step further and stirfries deep fried pork belly with chili, basil and a sweet sauce. I was disappointed that the crispness of the fried pork belly was a bit soggy, but I attributed this to delivery. I plan on trying this at their restaurant location. \n\nSteamed sea bass: A whole steamed sea bass served in a coconut broth. The fish was very fresh and tender and perfectly accented by the light broth. This was a hit with my family and the favorite dish of the night. \n\nPad thai: Pretty standard. I prefer my pad thai to be sweeter. \n\nBbq chicken: YUM! I order this without fail every single time. The chicken is  flavorful and perfect with the Thai chili sauce. It remains surprisingly tender when served as leftovers the next day. \n\nPad kee mow: My bf's favorite noodle dish here.  Broad rice noodles, soy sauce, fish sauce, garlic, meat or tofu, bean sprouts, and various seasonings. Chili and basil give it a nice kick!\n\nYellow curry: Delicious! After all the chicken is gone, I like to save the curry broth and eat it with rice the next day. \n\nI've also been to the restaurant location and was pleasantly surprised by the classy decor and attentive service.

It reminds me of the smokiness of Nopa's pork chops and with the dipping sauce it just adds another dimension. \n\nHad the Pad Kee Mow (spicy flat noodles) with chicken and Tom Kha Kai (coconut milk based soup) with shrimp for the entrees. Pad Kee Mow wasn't anything special from what I've had before. The Tom Kha Kai comes in a showboating flaming pot which I'm sure can gain points if taking a date.

The restaurant has a casual updated feel to it upon arriving. We started off the dinner with a Thai beer and glass of house wine. The wine tasted like a cheap version you would get at the local liquor store around the corner and was way to sweet. We actually had to send it back and just stick with the Thai beer. For dinner we had the pla koong (salad), tom kha gai (soup) and the seafood in green curry sauce. All the food was fresh, authentic and tasty but it was just way to SPICY for me.

I ordered sticky rice with mango and they were out! On a Friday night at 7 pm BEFORE the dinner rush and they've already run out? Strike one. So they bring us the bill since we don't want any other Dessert and we pay it and stay and chat for maybe 5 minutes. They start taking away our placemats and all our stuff basically pushing us out. I recognize they're busy, but that was just rude. They also allowed one of their waiting patrons to stand next to our table that was in the back of the restaurant and hover pressuring us to go. This was really inappropriate and causes them to deserve this two star rating. The rest of the experience is what keeps them from 1 star.", "author": "Lisa C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-07", "description": "I think this place is slightly overrated; either that or my expectations were skewed thanks to positive Yelp reviews. Whatever the reason was that brought me here to eat lunch yesterday, I cannot see myself coming back.\n\nI give this Thai restaurant 3-stars because it truly is just average. My workplace is located around Western Addition/Fillmore and occasionally likes to order here for lunch parties (not to say this restaurant caters--my office just eats family-style). Yesterday, I trekked down to this restaurant for a pick-up order. As I like to do whenever I venture to a Thai restaurant I am not familiar with, I order my stapple: Pad See Ew with chicken. \n\nMy issues with this restaurant:\n1. Their website menu is not up to date in prices and there is no price differentiation for lunch and dinner. I ordered my Pad See Ew from their website expecting it to be $8.95 (pre-tax) but I was annoyed to find out when I paid that it cost a smidgen short of $10 pre-tax and over $10 including tax. \n2. The size of the take-out drinks are about half the size of dine-in drinks. \nSo I initially ordered only Pad See Ew but after seeing so many Thai-iced teas around me as I was paying, my inhibitions gave way and I ordered one for myself to-go. OH man was I disappointed. The to-go cup was PUNY! I brought this size difference to the waitress's/cashier's attention and she just tried to explain it away saying the amounts that the dine-in glasses and plastic to-go cups can hold are the same. I wish I had taken a picture of the cup size difference or wish I had asked the waitress to literally demonstrate for me that the volume of the dine-in glasses and to-go cups were the same. \n3. Location is not the most ideal.\nI suppose since it is located near the 38 and other bus lines, it isn't a horrible location. But you have to walk through a decent amount of the less-than-glamorous side of San Francisco to get to it. To top that off, the only parking nearby are meters and overpriced parking lots. \n\nOverall, I wish I had gone to a different Thai restaurant, especially since the quality of the Pad See Ew is comparable to King of Thai and other chains like it but costs more for lunch. The time you would spend getting to this location plus the smelly, dingy, less-than-safe state of its surrounding area makes it not worth the trip to pay for average-tasting Thai food.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

The place wasn't super packed, but by the time we were finished, there were only a couple of empty tables. You can tell that Lers Ros is authentic by the amount of tables that were speaking Thai. Just from looking at their menu, they had a pretty large selection of dishes, including dishes that you wouldn't normally find at a typical Thai restaurant.  \n\nThe appetizers were pretty solid. \n\n1. Larb - Probably my favorite dish of the night. It's an eastern Thai dish with ground pork, basil, green onion, lemon juice and other spices. Hard to describe, but if you like Thai papaya salad, and you like meat, I would recommend this dish. Order it with sticky rice to balance out the spiciness. Also, if you can't handle spicy food, make sure to specify - mild. \n\n2. Chicken Satay - It's pretty hard to mess up grilled chicken skewers and peanut sauce, so I'm not going to rave about this dish. The chicken could have been cut thinner, but it doesn't ruin the dish. I would order it again. \n\nMain Course \n\n1. Kuay Jub - I believe this is the first Thai restaurant in the bay area to serve this noodle soup. This is my favorite noodle soup by far, and it is pretty decent and Lers Ros. It's a little on the sweet side, so I think I will ask for less sugar next time, but I would still order this again. I don't like eating organs (intestine, blood, liver, etc.), so I ordered it without. This soup is a brown broth with rolls of rice noodles, crispy pork and egg. I normally eat it with dried red peppers, but it also goes well with the vinegar jalepeno sauce for those with an affinity towards sour foods. \n\n2. Pork Belly - Fried pork belly with a brown sauce. Decent entree. Pretty lean meat. \n\n3. Pad Thai - Standard dish everywhere. Not the best Pad Thai I've had, but it is definitely tasty. \n\n4. Khao Mun Gai - Hainanese Chicken - I was actually too full at this point to taste the dish, but a heads up - In Thailand, this dish is normally served with boiled chicken, but some vendors will boil the chicken and then fry it with salt and pepper. When you order the fried khao mun gai, that isn't what you are getting. You are actually just getting a breaded fried chicken with sweet sauce, and not the spicy brown garlicy sauce that it is traditionally served with.

We ordered the papaya salad with raw blue crab, and it was excellent. I loved the spice, they don't hold back. The raw blue crab was delicious and exceptionally fresh, giving the right amount of sea-salty goodness to the dish.\n\nWe also ordered the curry puffs, which were good, but not mindblowing.\n\nMy friend ordered a duck rice plate, which she said was delicious. \n\nMy vegetarian pad thai without egg was a disappointment, though. The rice noodles were not cooked all the way through and the vegetables were still raw. Perhaps another 5 minutes in the wok on med/high heat would have been sufficient to tenderize the veggies and soften the rice noodles. \n\nFlavors were good overall, but the pacing and execution of some of the dishes need work. We got our appetizers, and then 2 minutes later, had our entrees plopped down on the table as well. It was difficult to work with 4 plates AND our appetizer plates on a two-top. \n\nWhen I start eating meat again, I'll go back to try other specialties.", "author": "May T."}

Many of the complaints are simply mistaken:  the authentic Thai food apparently has not been sufficiently Americanised.  Too salty?  Too spicy? Welcome to Thailand!  Not enough meat?  Try no meat!  Too little English?  Stay away from Asian restaurants.  Too noisy?  Welcome to San Francisco! \n\nOK, it has been Americanised that way, but it's no noisier than dozens of other, less appealing places.  So blame the clients who insist on shouting, not the restaurant, which has actually installed baffling in the ceiling.\n\nThis place is especially appealing to vegetarians, who know that good vegetarian food isn't simply replacing meat with tofu, and that eggplant doesn't by itself make a vegetarian dish exciting.\n\nThis was a fantastic experience.  Moderate prices, large portions, great taste,  beautiful presentation, excellent service.  Woohoo!  It doesn't get any better than this!\n\nIncidentally, I'm normally quite conservative in my ratings, rarely giving five stars.

I knew I'd be in for a treat, so R and I braved the streets of the TL and made our way over from Union Square. I think it's a good idea to make a reservation, as waiting can take up to almost an hour on a busy night and you really don't want to be 1. waiting inside and smelling all the tantalizing food or 2. nervously huddling outside of the restaurant in the dark night. \n\nI wish we were hungrier so we could have eaten more. I also wish they weren't out of the Thai herb sausage appetizer. We couldn't bear to replace our order so we just went without it while wistfully wondering what it would have tasted like. More incentive to come back!\n\nWe got the Pad Thai (I know..but the articles outside mentioned it and I had been harboring a longtime craving!) with prawns, and the pork belly, which upon reading the reviews was a MUST GET. Also what you MUST GET with the pork belly is rice. \n\nI loved the Pad Thai! It was absolutely tasty and each element was flawless, from the crunchy bean sprouts to the chewiness of the noodles. \n\nThe pork belly was surprising to me, first because I'm not used to having such a large platter of pork belly, and second because the crunch took me for a loop. Each piece is like a little party in your mouth. First comes the crispy layer, then the soft, fall apart in your mouth texture, and then the melting of the fat on your tongue... oh my my. The flavor is marvelous and there is the perfect amount of heat in this dish. However because it is so flavorful, don't skimp on the rice!\n\nAnyway I wish we came on a less busy day, I wish we had a better table, and I wish our appetites were bigger!

The medium-hot heat level was even good enough to get the nose running a bit.  The PAPAYA SALAD was fresh and crispy with the perfect amount of heat and fish sauce taste.  The popular crispy PORK BELLY dish lived up to the hype with its flavorful buttery soft meat and a crispy skin.  As a basic baseline for comparison I always order some PAD THAI, and this place was better than average - fresh, not too greasy.  My favorite dish was the PLA RAD PRIK (WHOLE FRIED TALAPIA) - beautiful presentation, and a taste to match.\n\nI thought the service and ambience were both great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-30", "description": "Lers Ros has the most delicious, mouthwatering, can't-wait-to-try-more Thai food you'll ever eat in San Francisco. It boasts a menu of over 120 items but some of the dishes are so tasty and memorable, you'll have to fight every urge not to stick to your favorites. I've been here 2 or 3 dozen times and never been disappointed.\n\nI have a weakness for pork so my favorite starter is the Koh Moo Yang (#9, $8.25). Grilled, smokey, tender pork shoulder is thinly sliced and fanned over crisp lettuce leaves. The melt-in-your-mouth unctuous fat on the pork is cut with an intense tart, spicy chili sauce with bits of red onion and cilantro for that perfect punch of tang, heat, and freshness.\n\nMy brother is a connoisseur of Lark Kai salad (#24, $7.25) and during a visit from out of town, he claimed Lers Ros' rendition is the best he's had outside of Thailand. Minced chicken and onions are mixed with chili, mint, rice powder, and lime juice dressing. It's savory, it's tangy, it's fresh, and oh man, is it spicy! It's an exciting taste and really perks up the taste buds for entrees.\n\nTheir signature dish is the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62, $8.95). Frequent visitors know to order this piece of porky heaven by its number: 62. Ever seen the huge slabs of fatty pork with glistening fried crispy skin hanging from hooks in Chinese butcher shops? Yeah, they take that and stir-fry it with a mix of red bell pepper, diced green bean, garlic, and strands of green peppercorn bound with a savory, dark, braising sauce that begs out to be ladled over rice.\n\nI've made many a late night run for the Kao Pad Kai Tod (#57, $7.25). Crispy, sliced strips of battered, golden fried chicken are rested on moist egg and onion fried rice. A small dish of sweet chili sauce is served on the side for dipping the fried chicken but I find it ties the whole dish together so I just drizzle it all onto the dish.\n\nMy dining companions rave about their Pad Thai (#78, $7.50) and say it's a notch above the Pad Thai at the other independent and chain Thai restaurants around town. The chicken Tom Kha Gai soup (#27, $8.25) is rich and creamy and a great way to start the meal. It's served in a circular firepot which never fails to draw glances from other tables. When eating with a large party (I've been in a party of 14 here and they don't break a sweat), you can try the Pla Kra Pong Nuang Manow (#112, $23.95), a whole sea bass with chili and fresh lime juice. The fish is cooked in a light sauce and is wonderfully moist, tender, and light. I would prefer that they use a different sustainable fish but the occasional indulgence is to be enjoyed.\n\nOn a recent visit, I tried the Pad Makuer Tofu (#46, $7.25) and while the eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu were cooked nicely with a garlic, chili, and basil sauce, they lacked the punch of other stellar dishes. Subtlety isn't an asset on their menu: order with gusto and don't look back!\n\nLines can get long on Friday and weekend evenings but after you've put in the time, got a table, and ordered, the plates come out fast and furious. For a small, busy restaurant, the service is attentive and efficient. Glasses are refilled without having to look around and they even change your plates following appetizers and soup.\n\nBest of all, they even offer delivery until close at midnight. I can't think of any other \"Best of\" restaurants, let alone decent restaurant that serves and delivers food this late.", "author": "Patrick W."}

Went at 7pm, Monday night & the place was already packed. \n\nOrdered Chang & Singha beers - both light & refreshing with the food.\n\nAppetizer: #3 Fish Cake\nYUM!  A bit on the greasy side from being fried but solid. 4 little fish rounds served with a side of addicting cucumber/sweet chili sauce. The cukes are thickly sliced, the oil is perfectly balanced with heat & sweet, & the crushed peanuts on top add a little crunch. \n\nMe: #25 Larb Phed Yang\nReally? I had no idea Thai could be this GOOD! I usually get pad thai or chicken curry but I was blown away by the subtleness yet complexity of this dish. Duck wasn't overly fatty, seared tender, flaked & served (including skin) on a bed of iceberg lettuce, herbs & (beware!) whole chili peppers. I didn't touch them (I'm a spice-wuss) but they were small, red & fiery-looking. \n\nOrdered sticky rice which is what is just that: sticky. Served in a cute woven basket, impossible to spread like regular steamed rice. It's a glob that's more texture than taste. My favorite presentation: take a section of iceberg, slice of sticky rice & top with duck larb...insert in mouth & enjoy! \n\nHim: #34 Kang Karee (I think)\nI had 1 bite of his yellow (orangish to me) curry with chicken & it was good. I've had good curry before so I didn't taste anymore. Nice sized chicken pieces with chunky veggies. Steamed rice was also ordered for this which was served in a pretty silver bowl. \n\nOnly spoons & forks brought to table though, we never had a knife offered. A little different but I used 1 spoon as knife & all was fine!\n\nI will happily go back again & again as the menu is impossibly long (usually something I stay away from but they seem to know what they're doing).

They offer the usual curries, noodle dishes, and papaya salads, but what really will strike most first timers will be the things like alligator and rabbit that make appearances on their sizable menu.\n\nComing in with my friend Miyuki who's been here all the time and always brings in new friends to eat, I let her go to work on the dishes.  She ordered the house specialty steamed seabass and pork belly.  I chimed in with the staple red beef curry, which was perfectly satisfactory, but lacked the luster of the other two dishes.\n\nThe seabass melts away so well and the pork belly.. well, there's nothing bad that could be said about pork belly.  I was warned that everything will be served on the spicy side, but things actually came out rather mild.  Just be wary if you're looking at ordering some of the more naturally spicy foods.\n\nI'll definitely be back next time I'm in SF and hankering for some good, authentic Thai fare.

We arrived around 9:30 and were told we would have to put our names on the list and wait 10-15 minutes-- which is fine, we've been there many times so we know the drill. Then after around 10 minutes a tourist bus with around 30 passengers pulls up and after a quick interaction with the tour bus leader the woman in charge tells us she would have to sit all these passengers ahead of us because \"they showed up early.\" I informed her that we've been waiting, and we were here first so she should seat us first following the \"first come, first served rule\" but she just wouldn't acknowledge our pleas, though clearly we were in the right. She told us she'd sit these 30 people ahead of our party (and everyone else after us on the list) and we would now have to wait another 15-20 minutes. She kept apologizing yet would not do the right thing-- clearly she prioritized the larger revenue to be generated by this group of 30 rather than doing what is right, which is to adhere to their first come first served rule.

Three isn't quite enough and four is just not right. So...\n\nI was at Lers Ros a few nights ago with my daughter who spent three months earlier this year living in Thailand. From the get-go she said this was the most authentic Thai place she's visited in the US. Everything from the music on the radio to the Chang Beer logos on the cooler. She was smiling ear-to-ear. We got the (voluminous) menu and began ordering. I started with the Larb Kai (chicken) and then I went with the Rad Nah (#79 - \"house secret gravy sauce and marinated pork topping on the seasoned flat noodle\"). I ordered a Fat Tire Ale.\n\nThe ambiance is what I would call serviceable.  The service is what I'd call serviceable although the place was packed and there were lines at the door so I really can't complain. In true Thai restaurant fashion, there were TVs on the wall. The food came in a few minutes.\n\nThe Larb Kai was very favorable for the first few bites. Then the heat set in. Now, I think I have a pretty manly palate and can handle heat but when sweat is running down the back of my neck and my scalp is damp I'd say they were serving up the heat. Throwing sanity to the wind I finished the salad and waited just a moment for my entree to arrive. Now, ya know when you've eaten really spicy hot food and the beer isn't doing the job of quelling the fire and the next dish is really steaming hot? Just how difficult that is to eat? Ah. That's where I was. Now, the Rad Nah was very good...delicious for the parts of it that I could actually taste. I managed to eat most of it through long sips of beer and ice water. So...lessons learned?\n\nThe food here is good but be careful of how hot it can get. Have cold water on the table just in case. Make a reservation (it seems to have a large fan base). Enjoy.\n\n3.5 stars.", "author": "Gary C."}

It's suck-on-ice-cubes for 20 minutes until your mouth works again spicy.  It's you-know-it-the-next-day spicy.  It's sweaty scalp, drugged out euphoria, six-napkins of drippy nose spicy.   But so tasty you eat the whole thing.\n\nThe \"immature peppercorn\" dishes are spicy in a whole new way.  Other things, like the porridge soups (very not like jook) and the fried tofu appetizer are not spicy at all.  I really like the pork leg over mustard greens.  If you're adventurous you can have eel, boar, vennison, and lots of other game meat.  If not, they do have some of the typical thai dishes, though cooked with a twist that makes me think it's either extra-authentic or regional.\n\nStaff is friendly and sweet if not super-attentive.  Decor is straightforward Asian restaurant, though dim enough that it has a bit of class.  There's a one page list of beer, wine, sake, and miscellaneous nonalcoholic drinks.  Food comes out fast.  Prices are reasonable - $6 to $9 for the standard fare, and up to $20 for things like a whole fresh steamed fish, also highly recommended.\n\nIt's good for large groups, also good to come alone, although the portions seem geared to share.

It's my Thai restaurant mainstay. I find that often the broth is overly sweet, way too thick and doesn't pack the lime punch on the end that I love so much. The Lers Ros take on Thom Kha Kai pushed me over the edge of Thai dining heaven. The broth was perfectly coconuty without being too sweet, had a great lime flavor and was full of fresh ingredients including fresh mushrooms and bamboo. No canned ingredients here, although I do like canned straw mushrooms in my Thom Kha Kai. The use of fresh lemongrass, chilies, galangal, lime and basil really gave the broth a depth that I haven't tasted in other versions of Thom Kha Kai. \n\nThere were about five other menu items I wanted to try, but my dining partner kept me in check and reminded me that I can always come back another time, which is what I plan on doing; many times.", "author": "Lee H."}

It was so bad then that I felt like puking, and vowed never to touch the stuff again. It put me off not just Thai food but most curries in general (at least until I got more into Indian food).  Over the years, I would try it again once in a while, trying to keep an open mind, and while those experiences were not bad, definitely not even close to the first time, I was kinda meh about the cuisine in general and I never craved it.\n\nThat is, until I tried Lers Ros!  This place is famous at my other favorite foodie online hangout, Chowhound, that when I got the chance I figured I'd give Thai food another try.  I was in the Nob Hill area and initially wanted brunch-y food with my friends, but after unsuccessful attempts to get tables at Canteen and farm:table, we wound up here.  We started off with a spicy coconut soup...it came in a cool container with a flame in the middle to keep the food warm.  I'm normally not the greatest fan of coconut, but I think the spiciness of the dish made it work.  We were all a little hung over from the night before so we all opted for the greasy stuff to coat our bellies.  I doubled up on the fried stuff, getting the fried rice AND the fried chicken.  It totally hit the spot in the best possible way, and settled my queasy tummy immediately.  The rice was just so flavorful, and the chicken very crispy and juicy.  The sweet chili sauce that came with it was good but I needed a bit more of a kick and added some of their chili paste (they have 4-5 different condiments on the table that you can add).\n\nThe meal was very cheap, wound up costing under $15/pp.  It was the perfect hangover food, but I would enjoy it even if I wasn't hung over.

Fantastic!\n\n#62 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob - Pork belly that's deep fried with crispy skin.  The pork belly is then cubed and stir fried with basil and bell peppers.  The pork belly itself is a lot like Cantonese suckling pig.  Again, the flavors are very bold.  It's outstanding!\n\n#80 Pad Woon Sen -  Stir fried mung bean noodles with eggs and prawns.  It's a nice dish to go with the spicy pork and duck.\n\nI am very excited that there's a Thai restaurant that serves authentic Thai food.  I cannot wait to try their other menu items.", "author": "Paul K."}

That said, I would say just order from the entree menu... you can't go wrong.. everything on the entree menu was delicious and good portion.

Not only had Lers Ros Thai not jacked up their prices like so many other places do on this night... they even gave everyone in our party a complimentary glass of champagne.  Now that's classy!\n\nThat was just the start of a very fine evening here.  No, wait, that's not quite true.  I had called them no fewer than four times to inquire about reservations, make reservations, change reservations, etc.  And each time, they were unfailingly helpful and polite.\n\nWhen I came in to the restaurant way earlier than my friends and waited for them, they brought me my champagne early, plus water, and lots of smiles.  These folks are attentive, friendly, and helpful!\n\nAll our dishes were tasty, but one of them -- the one I requested to be \"medium spicy\" was, for my friends and I, just too spicy.  When I mentioned this to the waitress, asking if there was any sort of add-on to make it less spicy (like yogurt in an Indian restaurant) she said, no, no, let us make you a brand new dish that'll be better for you... any dish you want, free of charge.  I was stunned and couldn't decide so I had her pick a different beef dish, and oh boy, did that beef just melt-in-your-mouth (and yes, it was much less spicy!)\n\nAnd wow, everything is so affordable!  Most entrees are around $8-$9, with just a few dishes (particularly specials) being appreciably more.  Much of the wine is a reasonable $5/glass.  Take THAT, mostly-overpriced-SF-Thai-restaurants!\n\nSadly, no one else but me had room for dessert so I passed on it as well... but next time I'm getting the fried-banana-with-mitchell's-ice-cream!\n\nOnly nitpicks?\n- Mints with the check would have been a nice touch.\n- Dangit, why isn't this in Mountain View where I live?! :D\n\nI can't wait to go back!", "author": "Adam L."}

Luckily, my friends and I escaped these threats along the way.\n\nThe restaurant is organized and clean and the waitresses are very nice people. Menu has a huge selection; it took awhile just to look through the items. It features very traditional dishes and some I have never even heard of. They have weird meats like rabbit but they also got the typical Pad Thai. I went for the seafood curry which was very mediocre. The curry itself had great spices and flavors but the seafood sucked. It consisted of mostly fishballs and like a shrimp. Osha Thai still has the best one in my book. The sticky rice was cool; it comes in a little cylinder box and was sticky as hell. Pad Thai was also legit, doesn't taste like ketchup like at other places.

Well, thanks to the almighty power of Yelp the Dynamic Duo of J. Drew decided to hit a popular choice, Lers Ros Thai. In a nutshell (how did I get into this nutshell?) we thoroughly enjoyed what Lers Ros had to offer. Quite flavorful and boldly spiced, both dishes were spot on and we will definitely return. \n\nThe place was packed upon our arrival with a young, hip crowd present in the dining room (BTW, where do the old farts dine in San Fran?). We quickly were seated at the last available table and tried to make some sense of the immense number of choices available. If you are adventurous they do offer quail, boar and frog. (Pass, pass and um, yeah pass).\n\nThe beautiful J. of our tandem went with # 76, Pad Kee Mow with zero meat, all veggies. (She is a vegetarian after all, well except for bacon, pork carnitas and all forms of hamburgers). She loved it and devoured her dish with great aplomb. She ordered it medium spicy and reported it as being perfectly spiced. Her cleared out sinuses have never been happier! \n\nMyself, I went with the #114, the whole fried tilapia. I saw a few other diners had ordered it and it certainly looked divine. It was indeed ripe with divinity and enormous in size! My tilapia was just slightly smaller than a large pizza. Either that or in a tragic accident they actually caught Charlie the Tuna the mascot for StarKist and fileted the poor bastard. Regardless it was very good but the secret ingredient that totally kicked it over the top was the Chili sauce that came on the side. It was awesome! It looked good, smelled great and tasted even better. I think it would be the perfect companion for any food : nachos, popcorn or tilapia. It made the dish and gets the highest possible recommendation. After the meal both of our noses were running faster than a scalded dog. In a good way!!!\n\nService was very good and efficient. Our waitress took good care of us despite having to work with a huge party of 15 hot twenty-somethings (Wassup Rose K.) And to top it all off the place was pretty damn cheap. Two meals for under $25, in San Fran???\n\nRock on wich yer bad self, Lers Ros Thai!", "author": "Drew M."}

I have been exposed to authentic Thai food, from Thai Town in Los Angeles to the Thai Wats throughout California. Every time I go there to eat it's like an adventure,which you can always count on being a great one\n\nNestled in the Tenderloin, Lers Ros Thai lives up to the saying how some of the best Southeast Asian Foods come from the \"Loin\".  Having a meal during the day you see a lot of Thai Natives, mostly students, and at night you would see the same type of students with the addition of chefs/servers from \"OTHER\" Thai Restaurants.  Now that tells you something doesn't it?  For sure.  The food is so good there.\n\nSome of my favs:\n\nKor Moo Yang (Grilled Pork Neck/Shoulder) is a MUST.  \nPa Ped Moo Ba (Wild Boar cooked fresh green peppercorn) is so deliciously exotic.\nYum Pla Dook Foo (Fried Catfish Salad) will blow away your tastes buds as you try to figure out where the fish is.\nFrom time to time they will have some authentic kanoms (desserts).\n\nThere is so much more to order, but you can't go wrong trying anything on the menu.

However, two of these dishes blew me away.  I just kept saying: \"Wow. Wow. Wow.\"  And this was because they tasted like dishes you would have in Bangkok, at really good places.\n\nSo far I've had 6 dishes:\n\n1) Kha Nah Moo Krob.  Confusingly, they put this on the menu under \"Rice Soup.\"  Unappetizingly, they call it Stir-Fired Pork with Crispy Rind.  But it's awesome -- the fatback pork is freshly fried to perfection, the chinese broccoli (that's the \"kha nah\") is fleshy with perfectly peeled stems, and the sauce is not just seriously umami -- it's also spiced in a way only confident Thai cooks will dare.  My friend says she gets this dish every time she goes, and I can see why.\n\n2) Kao Kha Moo.  Officially, this is whole stewed pig leg on rice, but if you can find it at all in the US, it's generally a pleasantly spiced simmered pork chopped into small pieces. (The flavor is a mixture of star anise and five spice, I believe.)  Here, though, it's a real piece of pork leg, slowly cooked in a five-spice mixture until fork tender (yes, it's Thai, you can use forks) -- and the kicker is the big layer of brown rendered skin with it.  It's soft and collageny and yummy... reminding me of hot evenings at the night market at Soi Thonglor.  And there was a lot of it.  (No hard boiled egg, which is normally standard, but I don't give a rat's ass about egg.  Fat is where it's at.)\n\n3) Koh Moo Yang.  This is grilled side of pork, very simple, with a spicy sauce that reminds me of that perfect sauce made by a Thai lady who used to grill chicken on top of the klong (from a cart perched on a large plywood board over an open sewer.)   This is an excellent and brutal dish, hotter than most things you will ever eat in US Thai restaurants.\n\n(A tip to all of you: \"moo\" means pig/pork. Yes, it's confusing to Muslims. Anyway, I think these guys know pork. Look for the \"moo.\")\n\n4) Pad See You.  The standard classic with pan-fried wide rice noodles, meat, egg, and a green vegetable -- Chinese broccoli in this case.  This was good rendition -- fairly \"burny\" -- but not as good as Thai Noodles.  The pork, however, was very tender, which reminded me of Bangkok.  I don't know what they do to the meat (maybe I don't want to know), but it took me back.\n\n5) Radna.  This dish (the simpler, weirder sister of Pad See You) is composed of a wide, chow-fun style rice noodle, stir fried with pork and chinese broccoli, and covered with a kind of gravy.  I've generally found that it is impossible to get a good version of this dish in the US -- usually the meat is overtough and the gravy is thin and insipid.  Sadly, I still remain unsatisfied -- while the meat was tender, the gravy had the usual problems.  On the other hand, there are two awesome dishes just waiting for you.\n\n6) Pad Ka Prao Krung Nai Gai.  This is basil stir fry with chicken entrails (gizzards, livers, etc.).  A very bold, spicy dish, but unfortunately, you almost never get real, licoricey Thai basil in the US -- and you still don't here.   However, this one is about as fierce and chewy (mmm, entrails) as you will ever get in the US.  Throw a little sugar or vinegar on to mellow this one out.\n\nSo the top 3 dishes both whipped the pants off my usual fave, Thai Noodle -- and the others were quite authentic too.  So San Franziskaners: forget Osha, Thep Phanom, and all those other places, and go here.  It's cheap and the menu is huge, with things I've never seen outside of Thailand. Oh, and they have one of the best selections of availabe condiments I've seen in a restaurant here.\n\nSee you there!\n\nTo see my other Thai food reviews, see my Thai Food list here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=9hnaS-bdeM5uKzKSgGBAOg", "author": "Daniel S."}

There's nothing 'fusion' or fancy about this legit place in the Tenderloin\nIt's my go-to place and i've been there countless times; below is a quick summary of my faves\n\nSummary:\n- Fish Cake- good, juicy but fairly normal. nothing spectacular\n- Pad Thai- a tad better than Most pad thai i've had in this country. definitely fried with tamarind and NOT ketchup (thank you). but it was little too sweet for my liking\n- Fried Garlic Frog- yummy; sorry to say it tasted like chicken, but it really did. it was deep fried, garlicky...but the only thing that was a little  awkward to maneuver was the little bone in the middle of the chopped pieces\n- Crispy Chicken on Fried Rice- YUMMY. the chicken was delish and the fried rice was pretty standard, but in a good way\n- Stewed Pork- I've never had this before, and i was cautious...but it was very tasty; sweet and fell right off the bone\n- Rad Nah- OMG. SO good. had a great wok-fried taste to it; tasted like authentic street food in Southeast Asia. YUM YUM. Still dreaming about it\n- Pad See Ew- Very tasty dish; we had it with shrimp, which was great. Flavorful, again, great wok-fried flavor and done perfectly\n- Red Curry with Roasted Duck- YUMMY. Very flavorful, roasted duck was so good\n- Larb with Roasted Duck- Wow. Best larb i've ever had. i've always had mediocre and much-too-salty larb; this larb was So juicy, flavorful and just plain yummy\n- Green Papaya Salad with Salted Egg yolk- I had a small portion of it since everyone had Inhaled it right away; but the slivers i got were very tasty\n- Thai Iced Coffee- fairly standard, not too sweet. Good\n- Crispy Pork Belly: Absolutely delicious\n\nSuper efficient; you can get in and out of this place in less than 30 mins for a full meal", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

Most of the time when I'm craving Thai, Thai House Express is where I go. The last time I went and walked past Lers Ros Thai, it was packed! I made a mental note to try it out. \nOne Thai craving later, I ended up here. First things first- the decor and atmosphere. It was kind of early for dinner (5:30pm) so there were only 2 other tables occupied. The furniture was meh and it kind of smelled funny. Funny smell aside, I was hungry and ready to let my eyes do their thing and scan the menu. I had read about the pork with crispy edges but the green seafood curry caught my eye and made my stomach tingle with delight. The bf ordered crispy chicken over fried rice and we shared a chicken satay appetizer. \n\nAppetizer- 4 pieces of yummy chicken, peanut sauce and cucumbers with red onion. Really good altogether. \n\nGreen seafood curry- surprisingly big. No rice and kind of spicy so I had to order a side of rice (which is really a container of rice, like 2 servings). It included squid, prawns, bamboo, bell peppers, basil and fish balls in a deliciously fragrant and flavorful green curry. Yum! I couldn't finish it all so I took it home and it will get in my tummy tomorrow for lunch. \n\nCrispy chicken over fried rice- ok portion of strips of crispy chicken with sweet & sour sauce (bravo on the sauce!) over fried rice. Pretty darn good! The bf saved some peanut sauce to pour over his rice... so smart, that one. \n\nService- above average. She was very attentive and I didn't have to search long to find her when I needed something. \n\nDrinks- an unusually large variety of alcohol! They served reds, whites, sakes. They also have a bar despite their small size.\n\nA note about the menu that a few of the other Yelpers have already mentioned but I will echo- the menu is definitely more adventurous than usual Thai restaurants. There are the usual pad thai, pad kee mow but I also saw alligator over  fried rice and frog leg appetizers. \n\nSo... definitely worth trying, especially if you've done the Thai thing more than a couple times in the neighborhood.", "author": "Amanda W."}

I'm a habitual user of their free delivery service (don't judge me, its hard to get dressed & go out for food when there's an SVU marathon). \n\nIt's always kind of like playing roulette when I order because there's so much crap on the menu! Many of the items are pretty unique & things I've never heard of, so it makes experimentation pretty fun. \n\nStand-out dishes for me were: tom yum soup, fried rice, larb & pork belly. I would skip on the rad-nah, grilled meatballs & marinated barbecue chicken (boring). The pad see ew is just okay. I don't know if its different for dining in, but I feel like the delivery portions are a little bit skimpy. The delivery boxes are the smaller kind & even then, my pad see ew order didn't quite fill the box even half-way. & for larb & sliced sirloin beef orders, the meat portion can fit into a small rice bowl, so it comes with a huge wedge of cabbage takes up most of the space. \n\nDelivery can be really slow sometimes (up to an hour & a half!), but I really like the food & prices.", "author": "Ruby H."}

Neither of us are familiar with San Francisco, and as we were walking I realized we were heading straight through the Tenderloin District. A little shady but not so different from Boston's Chinatown so we kept on walking and almost walked past Lers Ros.\n\nLers Ros is a slick modern place with a cafeteria-style feel to it, with tile on the floor and black plastic and chrome chairs and  tables. The menu is chockful with tasty Thai treats that we hardly knew what to order. We settled on sharing the Pad See Ew and the red curry with duck and pineapple. Note: rice does not come included in the price of curry but is an extra $3. That being said, it was a super-generous serving of rice, plenty enough for the two of us to soak up all the delish curry sauce. The food was well were generous portions; the curry was extremely flavorful and I enjoyed the duck, though there were a few too many hunks of fat. The Pad See Ew was a savory combo of noodles and vegetables, a solid comfort dish. We left completely satisfied, and waddled back through the Tenderloin contentedly.\n\nOh, and it only cost like $30.

It is authentic. \n\nParking can be a problem but if you overcome that you will enjoy the food. We will be back again. Although not late night since as with any place in SF, lots of homeless.

I went with three Thai friends and all of them attest to how good the food is.  The place serves up very authentic dishes that you may not see very often outside of Thailand.  The crispy catfish salad is a must and a dish that I have only seen in Bangkok.  I have tried a range of dishes from the friend fish to the saut\u00e9ed Chinese broccoli with pork belly.  The stir fried noodles also have a nice carmelization on the outside which is a sign that they have a really hot burner in the kitchen and they didn't rush the cooking.  All of the dishes all had a very nice balance of crispiness of texture with sweet, salty and sour flavors layered in.  They also deliver a good amount of heat with the dish.  I could say so much more about this place, but everything that I had was executed just right.", "author": "Scott C."}

I went to Thailand for two weeks and made a point to eat at only authentic places and not fall for the tourist Thai food places. Anyways, about the service first. When we came into the restaurant, one server was ready with our menus and a smile. She asked us how many and then proceeded to set up the chairs - no wait time!! After a few minutes, another server came and took our time. He was very patient considering we kept changing our orders and displayed a sense of humor. In the end, I ordered the Tom yum noodle soup and my companions the prawn pad Thai. The Tom Yum tasted extremely authentic but wasn't as spicy as expected. Pad Thai is extremely hard to make well, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found the pad Thai was not too wet and the prawns cooked just right.

The fast asian waitresses are like ninjas. One minute my rice bowl was gone and another it reappeared. They are quick to change your plates, switch bowls and utensils.\n\nOur table decided to do family style with everything, which we were glad to do since all of our food came out in different times. The soup noodles came out way before the curry dishes and other entrees. We started off with some spicy shrimp and cabbage dish. Of course, it was super loud inside, so it was hard to hear from the other people from the other side of the table. Although it was spicy, it wasn't unbearable. It was also a little sour, so it opened up my appetite for the soup noodles. The tom yom came in a flaming pot, there was fire coming out in the middle!! Get any closer and you might need to tattoo your eyebrows on afterwards. I got the meat stuffed cuttlefish soup noodle. I would have to say it was very interesting, the meat was good and soft, but the cuttlefish was pretty chewy. I did like my clear broth with fish balls, tofu, and napa cabbage. It was soothing and countered the spicy appetizer really well. Then came our chicken skewers .. always tender and just enough curry and paired well with the peanut sauce. I think next was the pad siew (noodle dish), which I love already. The only thing that was a disappointment was the rabbit dish. It was overly fried, which made the meat dry. It's normally pretty juicy and tender.\n\nAlso, try the duck curry. Just enough spice, but great when soaked in the rice.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

My friend an I had lunch here yesterday, and I have to admit, there's definitely a reason why I keep coming back (besides the fact that the space inside is so clean and spacious that I forget that I live in the Tenderloin).  The food is great!  \n\nI've been to Lers Ros several times already in the past month.  It's a good and reliable Thai restaurant with good food, large quantities (for lunch I always have to take portions of my food home as leftovers), and cheap prices (consider I have to take food home, that's like two meals for the price of ~$8-9.  Not bad.). \n\nThe lunch specials let you choose two dishes to go with rice, and it comes with a salad.  I ordered the red curry with pork, as well as the Kai Yang (marinated barbecued chicken, served with sweet and sour sauce).  My friend ordered an eggplant tofu dish (pad makuer tofu) and the yellow curry with pork.\n\nWe first had the salad.  I think this was the weakest point of the meal.  The dressing was a little too sweet and overpowering.  I'm not sure what type of dressing they use-- a derivative of sweet and sour sauce, perhaps?  It's a simple salad-- just cabbage and some shavings of carrot-- and the dressing was just too strong for the simplicity of the salad.  I would recommend toning down the amount of sweetness in the dressing.\n\nHowever, despite the salad, all our dishes were excellent.  The red curry was just spicy enough to take the edge off the cold from outside without being too spicy (SF weather has been-- well, SF weather has been, period.  It blows cold a lot, and it has definitely been blowing very cold and wet recently), and I really enjoyed the smokiness of the barbecued chicken.  It was an entire leg of chicken-- which is a TON of food for me.  So I brought half a leg of chicken home.  My curry, on the other hand, was too good to save, and I polished it off in record time (much to the dismay of my diet plans).  My friend finished off ALL her dishes.  In other words, she loved it.  :D\n\nUltimately, this place is excellent.  The food is flavorful, the restaurant itself is clean and spacious (none of that squished, Tenderloin muck bleeding in!), and the service is good.", "author": "Jeanne Y."}

I've been to this establishment twice, where the first time I was like \"okay, near the 20th Century tittie bar and the neighborhood...not the best.\"  But I was SO impressed with the atmosphere, the service and the food, even with the stuff that made my mouth burn so bad it went numb (it's the Squid salad appetizer...do not be fooled.  It should have that robot from Lost in Space flailing about screaming \"DANGER! DANGER!\") LOL! \n   \n    Aside from me being a super gringo (or Gringa for those paying attention) in that I can't handle anything really above their medium spiciness (which is my \"AHHH! HOT!\"), I love their food.  They're the only place I've seen in the city  thus far that has on their menu fried Frog(Super delicious but watch for the bones) and alligator(which I've heard is extremely good and in a perverse way, makes you feel good eating it because you know if it was between you and the Gater in a fight, you'd loose).  Their menu has the English translated name of the food along with the thai written name and all after a number, because who likes to try and pronounce a word(s) and look like a jackass when you butcher it?  Super big plus.  \n   \n  Their coconut milk curries are so good...I had the green one (number 36) and yes, medium spicy, but HOT for me.  I asked the waitress her opinion and she said that that one is her favorite among the curries.  Last time had a 37 with the roasted duck and yes, it was also beyond expectation. I recommend trying any of their noodle dishes, even the soups, as I've had one of them, but now as I look at the menu, I can't recollect which one I had.\n   \n   Mmm...another great point is their beer selection.  Though limited, super good beers at a super great price for imports and specialties (Sapporo, Singha, and others are $3.50).\n  \n   So just try it...it's better than Thai Stick and I'll say second-to-none with traditional, creative, and satisfying food for a little dinero.", "author": "Veronica S."}

I chose to play it safe considering this was my first time at this place. I have eaten at many Thai restaurants and pan fried noodles is something that takes skill to MESS UP, pause. The definition of Thai food does not mean something drenched in Tamarind Chili/Pepper. \n\nLastly, I tried the yellow curry. My gripe with this dish was that it was 75% onions, and 25% everything else. This dish also had a little kick to it, which is unexpected since yellow curry is usually the least spicy of the curries.  \n\nUltimately, I gave this restaurant one star due to the fact that multiple people at my party proclaimed this to be the worst Thai food they have ever had, and have sworn off Thai food since the time we all ate there (3 months ago).

We had the pork belly (#62), pad kee mow (#76), duck salad (#25), and possibly the catfish salad (#26 - this one was a little puzzling as we couldn't find the catfish... but it was good, whatever it was). So, overall, the seasoning on all of the dishes was outstanding. I have to admit that I had been a little nervous about all the comments on how unusual and spicy everything was - I like spicy stuff but not if it's too hot (for me) to enjoy. But I really loved all the flavors on these dishes - especially all the lime. The pad kee mow did have a little bit of a burned flavor but it wasn't bad or overwhelming. The meat in general was not the best part of the dishes - it was fine, rather than incredible, on its own, but the sauces and seasoning more than compensated. Having said that, the duck was excellent. It was mainly the pork belly that wasn't perfect - it was a little tough, but definitely still tasted good. I can't wait to go back and try other things - the menu is huge and I'm sure there's a lot more I'd like.\n\nThe service we had was very good - the waitresses were very friendly and kept our water glasses full.

While I understand that people don't flock to Tenderloin restaurants because of the \"service\" experience, there's definite room for improvement.  I'm not holding the restaurant to the same expectations of high end restaurants or anything, but think that basic principles should be honored: (1) people should be seated in order of arrival.  (2) food should be delivered to those who ordered first.  (3)  apologies (at the very least) should be offered when mistakes are made.\n\nOn a recent visit, I arrived with a ravenous hunger and ordered the two dishes I was craving.  Shortly after, a girl walked in and sat at the next table.  After a few minutes she finally made her selection, and I overheard \"curry\" as one of her choices.  When my food came out, the server brought it to her table, and she, in a hurry, began to eat.  I politely informed the server that I think my order went to the wrong table.  No apologies, no explanation, another long wait for my food.  In the meantime, they brought out the other customer's order and gave it to her, in addition to my order that she was already eating.  What the what?!  I was the one who was not only starving, but now had waited about 15-20 minutes for my food.  When my order finally appeared, there was again no apology or explanation.  \n\nAnother visit brought another observation.  The restaurant has a great lunch special deal where you can choose two dishes for a set price.  I went with some friends on a holiday, and we were told that there is \"no special on holidays\".  Fine, we just ordered from the regular dinner menu.  However, during the same lunch service, another table requested the lunch menu from a different server, and was able to order from it.

When my friends showed up, they sat down for less than a minute and the waitress came over and asked them what they were ordering. \n\nThroughout the meal they kept coming over to our table and looked over our food to see whether we were almost done eating or not. They did not come over to ask whether everything was okay, how the food tasted, or if we needed anything else. They were trying to kick us out fast in order to make room for other customers. They did this to us because we had no reservations and I noticed they did not do that to any of the other big groups either. It doesn't matter if we made reservations or not because we are still PAYING customers!\n\nAfter some of us finished eating, they took away the plates but then they also tried to take away plates that were still half full and rushing us out! At this point I was extremely irritated and It pained me that they had to charge us gratuity because if it was up to me I would have given them $0 tips if I could. \n\nThe food is okay and a little more expensive than other Thai restaurants that I've been too. Also, not as delicious. However, the food wasn't terrible, hence the 2 stars. I definitely do not recommend this place.", "author": "T H."}

So, on the first night, we checked out Yelp for some Thai places and found Lers Ros. The reviews were high and my fiance said the pictures of the food looked very authentic. We walked from our hotel, the Intercontinental, and got there in about 20 minutes. The only reason I mention this is because if any of you are going to try this restaurant and are staying close to where we stayed do yourself a favor and take a cab! It's not that I don't like to walk, but we found out the hard way that you have to walk through some pretty sketchy areas. Some parts of the walk reminded me of a smaller version of skid row in L.A. Anyway, the walk was definitely worth it as both the food and the staff at Lers Ros were frickin' awesome! And since we were not driving I was able to have my favorite Thai beer, Singha. The food was seriously so good that we ended up eating dinner here 3 of the 4 nights we were in SF. And as all of you know, there is no shortage of restaurants in the city. But when you find a place with seriously perfect food and a restaurant full of nothing but the best staff ever, why go anywhere else? My fiance and I reminisce about this restaurant at least twice a month. Just about every time we eat Thai food we end the meal by saying \"It was good, but not nearly as good as that place in San Francisco!\" Not sure when we'll be back to the city, but when we do, this will be the first place we go!

And so was everything else that we ordered during our trip to Lers Ros. But, especially the pork belly. It's cooked so perfectly, the meat so tender and flavorful with just the right amount of fat. It is pretty oily, but to me, that's heaven. And the sauce it was in was amazing, I was soaking all my leftover rice in that after I was done with the meat. It is spicy (for me since I'm a total wimp when it comes to spicy food) but I managed pretty well til then end when it was just rice and sauce. Then it got pretty painful heh. Family ordered bbq chicken and catfish rice plates and they enjoyed both very much. I got to taste a little, and I would definitely try the catfish next time I'm here. Also ordered the pad see-ew, which was pretty standard. The noodles were kinda sticking together and the chicken was a little dry, but it's not as sweet as other places', which is totally a-ok with me.\n\nIt is a little more expensive than other Thai restaurants I've been to, but I think they make up for that not only in the quality of their food, but also in atmosphere and service. The place is well lighted and very clean. I usually don't really care too much about service, as efficiency is my only concern. But I was impressed by Ler Ros' servers. They were nice, attentive and efficient, much better service than in some fancier, more expensive restaurants I've been to.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try the quail and rabbit!", "author": "Amanda K."}

I appreciate great Thai, but at the exorbitant prices some places charge these days, it doesn't make me a happy camper nor does it make me inclined to go out of my way to eat it (I don't live in a neighborhood that has particularly many Thai restaurants).  For the two of us, the total came out to about $30 for an appetizer and two entrees.\n- DELICIOUS drunken noodles - you have to try them here as they have just the right amount of spice and the noodles are cooked well\n- fast and efficient!  we came for dinner on a friday night and we were in and out of there in less than an hour.\n\nI do have to say, however, that I was underwhelmed by the fried tofu app (flavorless without the accompanying sauce) and red curry entree (not spicy enough and not the greatest flavor) that we ordered.  I was also turned off by the fact that they charge $1.50 for a cup of tea.  Many other places I've been to give you free tea, even when you are getting food to go!!

One of our friends was literally picking every piece of meat off the tiny bones by the end. Tried both the beef and venison versions with galingale and young peppercorns, which tasted great though the meat was a little overcooked on both occassions. The Tom Kha soup was also a favorite, though I thought it was just ok. After all the great things said about the pork belly, we got an order of that too, but had mixed reviews.

I *know* these people should have the talent to pull it off, but really, for one reason or another, they failed to properly prepare the basic staples of their cuisine... and in the case of their chicken coconut soup, they were amateurishly off the mark. \n\nTheir mild yellow chicken curry was about a medium. That, in itself, is forgivable.  What isn't is that their food evidenced quick & dirty cooking techniques that noticeably detracted from the experience, as if several of the ingredients were thrown in at the last minute... bland chicken and undercooked boiled potatoes. The end result, ulttmately, is a distinct lack of the richness you would get by cooking it all together. Compare this to those places that lightly brown the potatoes first, then let them simmer in the curry, giving you a richer taste and better texture and the difference becomes obvious.\n\nLikewise, their chicken coconut soup felt similarly thrown together. While their mild was, in fact, mild in this case, the chicken had no flavor and didn't taste like it simmered in the soup, there was a distressing lack of vegetables other than mushrooms, and nary a single piece of galangal, lemongrass, or kafir lime leaves were anywhere to be seen, while the best places put it in the soup and expect you to deal with it, because the flavor is simply is much, much better that way.  \n\nReally... what shortcuts did they do to avoid actually seasoning their soup properly? Rather than having the lemongrass, galangal, kafir lime leaves, heat, and coconut milk driving the flavor, the broth's taste was driven primarily by nam pla -- fish sauce.  Mmmm... fishy flavorless chicken soup?! Not!  Really, it's inexcusable, and simply not the dish that was ordered by the standards one would expect of a real restaurant. \n\nDefinite props for having delivery... but something tells me that this place is either horribly inconsistent, cutting corners, or a victim of their own success if they can't be bothered to nail down the staples. I suspect the frog and alligator are better, primarily because they're actually bothering to cook them without all the short cuts.\n\nI might try the place again someday, perhaps... but when I do, I will be sure to order in-house during off-hours, in the hope they will actually prepare my meal.", "author": "Mark K."}

Most of the dishes we had ordered in the last 4 visits have been consistently good. \n\nSome of the highlights are: \n\n1) Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62) - stir fried pork belly with crispy rind. We have ordered this dish every time. \n2) Pla Trout Tod Nam Pla (#113) - fried whole trout, served with mango sauce. Not for people who do not like to see fish head on the place. You can eat from the head to the tail since it is deep fried. \n3) Hoy Lai Pad Prik Pao (#102) - stir fried clams with chili and basil leaves. Definitely will order this again. \n4) Yum Nam Tok (#19) with pork - sliced pork with spicy lime dressing. It's basically the larb with sliced pork instead of ground meat. Yet another excellent dish that I do repeat order. \n\nOther dishes tried: \n- Som Tom Koong Yang (#13) & Som Tom Poo Dong (#12) - shredded green papaya salad with grilled shrimp, or raw crabs. Both solid. dish \n- Koh Moo Yang (#9) - grilled pork shoulder with a nice spicy dipping sauce. \n- Larb Phed Yang (#25) - duck larb. I liked it quite a bit, but it did not have a lot of duck meat and mostly skins. \n- Tom Kreang Nai (#30) - spicy and sour soup with pork entrails. I am not a huge fan of pork innards, but this was well executed. \n- Rad Nah (#79) - probably the least favorite dishes I tried at Lers Ros so far. The sauce is too sweet for me, and the quality of pork in the dish was a bit questionable. \n- Kang Keaw Wan (#36) - green curry with thai eggplants. Better than the version from Thai House Express, but not the best green curry I ever had either. \n- Pad Kee Mow (#76) - good, but not memorable. \n\nOne more thing to note - I had the food delivered to SOMA once and will never ever do that again. It took 1.5 hours and the food was cold.", "author": "Yuko K."}

However, it totally blew me away.  \n\nI was initially impressed by the wide variety of dishes on the menu; definitely more extensive than your typical Thai spot.  Fortunately, there were 10 of us there for dinner so we had a great chance to try a bunch of dishes.  In particular, I was a fan of a few things:\n\n-Garlic frog appetizer - lightly fried chunks of frog with a sweet chilli dipping sauce\n-The duck salad and calamari salad - great balance of spice, tart, and sweet in both, well cooked slices of duck\n-Pork belly - fried in a rich and flavorful sauce\n-Whole fish - we got the fried trout and the steamed sea bass.  Both with great texture, fresh, well prepared/flavored, and good sized fish to boot.\n\nWe had a couple of people with less flexible palates who went with some of the Thai classics (veg. yellow curry, veg. khee mao noodle) which I didn't think were all that amazing; you could likely do better elsewhere.  But the more interesting items on the menu are truly outstanding.  I enjoyed eating here more than Sripraphai in Woodside (hopefully for you ex-NY'ers this will mean something).\n\nAlso another reason to love this spot is the value: with shared apps, a ton of food, a Chang beer, plus tax + tip: $20 a person.

It's by far, the best \"authentic\" Thai cuisine in the Bay Area--i.e., spicy, pungent, peppery, rich and textured, and not drenched in sugar. \n\nUnlike Americanized local faves, the curries appropriately sting to allow the full intensity of the authentic flavors (e.g., galangal, kefir lime, etc.) to come through. The non-curry dishes--e.g., noodles, rice, and stir-fries--are delicately prepared with rich and subtle flavors. \n\nAnyone giving this place low scores simply has not had (or does not like) authentic Thai food.

In LA or Chicago, Lers Ros might not be exceptional, but it's here, and there's no better Thai food around -- excepting, maybe, some of the temples on feast days. Lers Ros isn't Americanised or Sinicised at all (well, a few dishes are, but they're easy enough to avoid). I love that the meats have different textures. There's no tyranny of tenderness here -- they choose the right cut for the job, and sometimes that cut is chewy or gristly or squishy. I love that they realise that a high capsaicinoid count is only part of what makes great Thai food. There's a freshness to their sauces that, of the Bay Area Thai places I've tried, only Thai House Express comes close to. I love that they give you the option of having your papaya salad with raw crab, even if I find it much easier to take the crab away to eat at home.\n\nThe easy listening background music is pretty horrific though.", "author": "Brad L."}

Boyfriend's mom usually orders and I just eat whatever.  \n\nKao mun gai is probably my favorite Thai dish.  I had it approximately a million times when I was vacationing in Thailand and haven't found it at a Thai place since....until Lers Ros.  It seems like a super plain dish - boiled chicken over garlic rice with a chili/ginger/soy sauce sauce - but it is yummy to the max.  It's really the sauce that makes the dish because it's hard to eff up the chicken and rice.  Lers Ros makes it just like Thailand pretty much\n\nMy other favorite dish at Lers Ros was the spicy spare rib soup.  I know how to say it in Thai (thom saep gadoog moo awn).  Thai people don't play around with their spicy-ness, and that is awesome.  The soup is flavorful and served over a flame to keep it hot.  The spice doesn't get in the way of the flavor at all.  \n\nThe last time I went, we also got kang ped (duck curry).  The duck wasn't extremely fatty, which I liked.  I couldn't tell how spicy it was since all of our other dishes were way spicy.  Hard to tell where the spicy was coming from after a while.\n\nThe chrysanthemum tea (and their other juices, I think) were served in HUGE mugs.

We were the first people in the place. We ordered chicken satay, garlic frog, and kra duk moo tod. Service was a bit strange here, we didn't get the satay for 30 minutes. I waited to dig in(the satay was solely for me while the other two appetizers were for my bf), until my bf got his apps. Waited another 10 minutes for the other two apps, but things were looking bleak so I started eating. The satay was good, but it was cold by the time I started eating. A few minutes later the frog was brought to our table, and it took another ten minutes for the pork ribs. It was confusing to see the other tables of people who had walked in and ordered after us get there food(including their entrees, and at the same time) before we even got our three appetizers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-30", "description": "this restaurant tastes different from all the other thai restaurants in the city I've been to.  And it is now, IMHO, the best thai restaurant in the city.  They use galingale instead of normal ginger, and almost always have fresh young peppercorns in the stirfried dishes.  they use thai eggplant (these little round, tomato-shaped eggplants) instead of chinese or western eggplants.  And every dish defaults to spicy, by my own chinese tastes.\n\nI've only come here twice so far, and both on friday nights.  always the place has been full of thai people--at least asians that can speak thai.  The food is really good and seems really authentic to me, though I've never been to thailand.\n\nDish by dish review (stuff I've had)\n1) pad ped alligator.  Stir fried in a heavy galingale, garlic, and chili sauce, this dish was quite interesting.  alligator tastes like a cross between chicken and fish, and was quite tender, despite what you might think.  quite tasty!\n2) stir-fried eel.  the eel were cut cross wise, with the spine still in it, so this dish was surprisingly difficult to eat.  taste was good, and it had almost the same sauce as the alligator (except no eggplant, if I remember correctly).  \n3) stuffed calamari soup.  This was kind of a chinese style clear broth--simple and flavorful stock.  Then they added ground pork stuffed calamari.  I expected them to have neglected to remove the \"spine\" of the calamari, but they did.  the calamari was relatively fresh and cooked to a perfect tender consistency. I'd definitely recommend this.\n4) lers ros special combination:  green papaya salad, bbq chicken leg, and steamed sticky rice (aka sweet rice).  The green papaya salad defaults to SPICY HOT as my thai friends have told me it should be, so be warned.  you may want to ask to get it mild.  It comes with little grilled shrimp, slightly smoky and quite good.  The BBQ Chicken is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME--well marinated, charred, and with a great smoky flavor from being actually grilled.  And it comes with a home-made sweet-and sour dipping sauce (caramellized, and not the typical glow-in-the-dark red).  The first time I came here, I smelled the chicken grilling, while I was still outside the door, and I was hoping it was coming from lers ros! :)\n5) green curry with prawns.  Pretty classic green curry. fresh and perhaps a little sweet for my tastes, but still good.  There also were thai eggplants in this dish.  great with rice as usual.\n6) THE BEST PAD THAI I'VE HAD IN THE BAY AREA.  The noodles were a perfect chewy al dente, and stir-fried to perfection, with the nice smoky flavor from a hot wok.  Well flavored with your typical eggs, fish sauce, and the chicken and shrimp were cooked just right.  Raw bean sprouts on top completed it, and gave the nice fresh texture break from the perfect noodles.\n7) Garlic pepper rabbit.  This was not what I expected, and a little disappointing.  They dry-fried the rabbit, without much of a batter, which was a mistake I think.  Rabbit is typically very lean and has small bones, so after frying, the outside of the rabbit chunks became hard, the meat was dry, and the small bones got mixed up with the hard \"skin\" of the chunks.  Made it difficult to eat, though the spices were good, and the chili sauce they served with it was very tasty.\n\nNote, they have a bunch of offal dishes I haven't tried yet (most of my local friends are...not so adventurous), but I will be stopping by for takeout/delivery a lot I think, so I'll be trying them bit by bit, until some of my high school friends come to town :)", "author": "Fong L."}

What am I talking about??\n\nI love Thai food, I eat Thai food all the time. Lers Ros' menu is super expansive with lots of more unique offerings that appeal to my curious foodie side.  We straggled in around 10pm last nite, so we decided to opt for a smattering of the foods that have come highly recommended.  We ordered :1 ) Garlic quail which came with a hot dipping sauce; 2)Som Tom Koong Yang (Shredded green papaya salad with chili, tomatoes, lime based salad dressing & GRILLED PRAWNs); 3) the highly recommended Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob (Stir-fried pork belly with crispy rind, Basil leaves, with red bell peppers, and green beans cut up to look like scallions); and 4) Kaeng Pah Pla Hed-Khon (Smelt fish in broth made from house made chili paste, young pepper corn and galingale).  The food was delicious and spicy and full of heat, save the fact for the papaya salad which was CRAZY spicy and packed with both dried chili flakes and chili seeds. The super duper heat kicked my ass, burned my throat, and left a bitter sensation in my mouth. I was concerned for about 5 minutes, as I ate the cabbage on the plate, and the cucumbers from the fried quail, all the while drinking water, as I tried to get rid of the bitter sensation from my mouth. I wasn't enjoying the flavors of the papaya salad since all I could feel was heat and the bitter sensation.\n\nOnce my taste buds came around, and the bitter sensation went away, I enjoyed the rest of my meal. I don't think I would order the fried quail again. I rather enjoy quail, but deep frying it makes the meat rather dry, and I like the meat to be more moist and tender.  The pork belly was delicious, the sauce was great, the crispy rind is reminiscent of a great Asian style roast pork.  I loved the smelt fish broth! The broth is like a spicy tom yum gong soup. The young peppercorn and galingale add a whole new level of spiciness to the soup. The bamboo shoots complimented the dish well. It was delicious.\n\nAfter we both got a handle on the heat level of the food, we were able to adjust our spiciness threshold and conquer the papaya salad. Although, if I were to order that dish again, I would ask for mild (which I'm sure will still pack a fair amount of heat). We left satisfied and quite full at around 11:15pm. A family with 3 little kids came in, and other couples were still streaming in. Oh, did I also mention that a majority of the menu items (save the sea bass and trout dishes and a few other specialities) all clock in at under 10 dollars? Delicious, affordable, with definite kick your ass abilities.", "author": "Annie Y."}

Missed them so much since moving from NY 12 yrs ago.  went last Sat. no reservation for 7pm, waited perhaps 10 mins seated promptly.  Service was excellent and even though not much english was spoken, smiling goes along way and received plenty of those!  Didn't have to wait for anything.  Chose about 5 appetizers and one main meal to share with 3 - some spare to take home!  No frogs legs spare though - could have done with a few  more but then that's me being greedy!

My mind was simply blown. At the suggestion of my fellow yelpers, I tried to green papaya salad with prawns. So spicy, and packed full of wonderful different textures, with a nice smokey prawn flavor. We also decided to order some fried chicken over fried rice, the stir-fried pork belly and the catfish. I loved everything but the catfish had the skin and bones still attached to it and for novice fisheaters it wouldn't be very ideal. Also we had some of the best thai iced coffee and tea... it was amazing. The service was quite attentive, and even though we arrived close midnight we didn't feel rushed to finish our food and get out.

The pork was not crispy so much as it was dried out like jerky.  Overlooking that, the seasoning just wasn't a showstopper.\n\nStir fried chicken w/ homemade chili sauce - again the sauce was nothing special even though I could see fibers of herbs and it was clearly homemade.\n\nMinced catfish salad - the catfish was right on as was the dressing.  But the salad part was just a bunch of iceberg, a couple slices of bell pepper, a little cilantro, maybe a few shreds of papaya.  Half of it was good and the other half was disappointing.  I much prefer Chai Thai's version in Oakland.\n\nPlus:  very friendly and very bright and clean\nMinus:  a little on the expensive side\n\nNext time we're in the area, we'll go to Sai Jai which was much, much better.

We arrived for an early dinner at 5:30 and within 30m, the whole doorway was blocked by people waiting for tables. Good sign. Service was really fast and attentive enough. The menu is pretty overwhelming, because they have a ton of choices. Ordered combo pad thai, prad prik king (spicy green beans) with beef and fried tilapia with house hot and sweet sauce (originally ordered the fried trout with mango sauce but they ran out). The pad thai had a ton of meat (beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, and tofu) and was your standard preparation. Nicely done. The green beans were super spicy and crunchy. The fish was big and crispy. It had a decent amount of meat, but I think the pomfret that most other Thai restos use for this dish has more meat than the tilapia. They pour a ton of garlicky, sweet and spicy sauce over the fish, and it totally makes the dish. If you eat the fish alone, it's a bit bland but the sauce sends it through the roof. My only complaint is that the beef that they use (in both the beans dish and the pad thai) was so chewy and difficult to eat. They need to use a better cut or tenderize their meat. Nasty.

Delicious, but be warned that it's spicy!  \n\nStewed pork leg: I'm not normally a fan of stewed meats, but this was cooked just right  - not too tough, and not overly soft.  Subtle flavors made this a popular dish at the table. \n\nCrispy chicken with fried rice: they must've put crack in this.  It's definitely Asian-style fried chicken, but with a slightly sweet flavor.  The fried rice that comes with it is some of the best fried rice I've ever had - they must put crack in it!\n\nFish paste green curry: It's probably not a dish for everyone, but if you want green curry with non-fishy fish in chunks with a consistency similar to fish cakes this is the dish for you.  The green curry had just enough spice in it and was flavorful.  I could probably just have the curry with rice and I'd be happy.\n\nRad nah: not one of my favorite Thai dishes (I prefer the drier noodles), but this was still tasty with a not-too-watery, not-too-thick gravy and plenty of meat and veggies.", "author": "Irene W."}

Seriously.  I love peanut sauce; I'll put that shit on anything, but these were so good that I kept having trouble deciding whether to just eat them alone, or dip them in the sauce.\nThai herb sausage appetizer - also fantastic.  Not too greasy, and fantastic flavor.\nPad Thai - honestly, I'd never met a Pad Thai I was a big fan of before this.  It has a richness, sweetness and intensity of flavor that just really turned me on.  The only oddity was that the noodles seemed slightly undercooked (they were decidedly al dente).  Not sure if that was intentional or not, but it left them pretty chewy.\nGreen curry chicken - plenty of kick, all white-meat chicken, and a great mixed pile of veggies in it including red bell pepper and Thai eggplant, but the flavor was only so-so.  I think Basil Thai still makes my favorite green curry in SF (in terms of the sauce itself).\n\nBut by the end of the evening, we'd had 4 dishes, 2 Thai teas, were totally stuffed, and had a bunch of leftovers for a whopping... $30.\nAwesome.\nYou're damn right I'll be back.", "author": "Don H."}

For me presentation plays a major role in helping me to decide whether i'll return for more or tell everyone to stay away ! The service here is not too shabby, i can always count of my water being filled after i drink it half way. The food here is great, the curry is awesome, the service is good, the waitresses there are like hawks waiting for their customers to give them a look and a whole group of them will come over to your table to help you out. more attention than we wanted, but it's cool at least it would be nearly impossible for them to screw up with more than 3 people standing at your table. street parking was pretty easy, our bill did not come out to more than 25 plus tip =)  excellent place to go to when you're working with a budget !", "author": "Jeff C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-14", "description": "These reviews are part of a series where my Vancouverite friend wanted to try a bunch of food carts all weekend.  We ended up deviating to some other cheap eats.\n\nThe contestants:  Lers Ros Thai, Fritzj, Adobo Hobo, Pizza Hacker, Gumbo Cart, Lumpia Cart, Bi-Rite Creamery, El Farolito, Bacon Dog Cart, Pho Garden, Zante's Indian Pizza\n\nThis review is about Lers Ros Thai.  When my visiting friend wanted to try some authentic Thai, the first place I thought of was Lers Ros Thai.  It is just as good as Sai Jai Thai but not as crowded and I would venture to say even marginally better.  The one drawback is that it does not have Sai Jai Thai's supposedly-ridiculously-amazing mango and sticky rice dessert that Sai Jai Thai has when mangoes are in season.  (Personally don't like that dessert but even I had to say it was not bad there)\n\nThis was my fourth time eating here and my tips on food are:\nChicken Satay - pretty good but not amazing\nPapaya Salad with Salted Duck egg - oh so delectable!  Maybe I'm biased because I love salty duck eggs but the salad definitely tastes better than most I've had.  I'm a glutton for punishment but for most people, their \"mild or spicy\" translates  to \"spicy or killer\"\nTom Kreang Nai - I love sour soups but this dish didn't go so well with the others\nPad See Ew - Excellent!  Noodles and Chinese broccoli cooked to perfection\nRad Nah - my personal favorite.  Take this and pour the gravy all over some of their rice (to be ordered separately).  It's the Southern gal in me coming out!\nKuay Tiew Phed Toon - nobody's favorite.  It was okay and I was the only one who kept drinking the strangely dark and full-bodied soup.  Also, I was the only one who felt sick afterwards so.... Draw your own conclusions....\nPad Kraw Pow?? -  This was one of my absolutely favorite new dishes but I can't remember the name.   It is NOT larb but is ground pork stir fried with some red bell pepper.  Will update this review when I go back but it was SO DELECTABLE!\nRice soups are okay, like a version of congee where the rice is not as mushed up.\n\nUnless you are going in the daytime, I usually avoid this area.  Take out is always an option though!  They are incredibly fast with that!  (~10m)", "author": "Susan L."}

So far none and this is my fist ever review about any thing because If I don't write a review I dont feel justified for THE DELICIOUS & AUTHENTIC  Thai food from Lers Ros. It was THe BEST Thai food In bay area. I lived in Thailand for 7 years and I could find none of the Thai restaurant In Santa Clara, San Jose, Sunnyvale , Stockton, Sacramento and San diego come close to the real taste of Thai food. Thank God I finally found THE PLACE where I get all the Authentic dishes with authentic taste.KOh moo yang and  Moo Krob, which, I couldn't find in any of the Thai restaurant I had been before. I do want to mention their Tom Yum Gai (tom yum chicken soup, which is not in the menu but they will make it) , which is one of the best , as tasty as you drink from a Bangkok street restaurant.  We went there yesterday ( Sunday) after noon it was not crowded, not much wait time, free parking on the street (its week end), and the authentic Thai food!! . WHAT A PERFECT AFTERNOON!!\n\nwe had,\n\nlarb phed Yang # 25 - superb!\n\nKoh moo yang #9 -- Can't describe, Thought I was back in Thailand\n\nTom yum Kai  #28- the best tom yum in bay area so far\n\nKao pad kai thod - good'\n\nkaeng keaw wan taley #100 - good\n\nPad Kra Prow Moo Krob (#62 - superb!\n\nFried banana  with ice cream - Aroi Mak !!!\n\nAll reasonably priced!!", "author": "T T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-08", "description": "This place will kick your butt....that is if you like spicy food to the extreme! They are not shy with ethnic flavors like stinky and tasty shrimp paste...a definite acquired taste and not for the meek. We tried the larb duck salad and it packed so much heat I had to go towel off in the restroom. The flavors were so intense I could have eaten 5 bowls of rice with it and been done! The duck was very guttural as it was hacked into tiny pieces and there were still some bone chips in the salad. The fish cake special was the best dish we had as the cakes were freshly made and the kaffir lime leaves and chili paste added real kapow to another super-spiced dish. The curry was pedestrian and still packed a punch...and even the shrimp paste fried rice with duck eggs was over the top as I had to add white rice to it to tone it down. Most restaurants cannot keep the flavors this intense as the public milder palate will push the owners to mute the flavors but then this place is known for kicking it up a wholenathalevel! Really ***1/2 as service is very nice!!!", "author": "Gregory C."}

I was drawn to items like Frogs, Rabbits and steamed sea bass. When we arrived, we were given free champagne because it was new years eve. We were very happy even though it was very little like 1/4 of glass.  It is the thought that counts.\n\nWe had these dishes.\n\n1. Papaya salad with RAW crab \nI like surprises, but this one I did not like. I got raw blue crab in shells and legs. After a long day, I just want something easy to eat, not to have to pick/dig the meat out of small raw crab.  \n2. The only famous Sausage on the menu\n   Two of us love it,  two of us did not like it. It was spiced well, and texture of the meat was perfect, not too chewy or dry.  I liked it.\n3. Soup in flaming pot with stuffed Squid\nEverybody else got a flaming pot, our wasn't flaming. That took fun out of the soup.  I can't rave about the soup. No special taste.\n4. Eggplant with vegetables/tofu\n   This dish was good, not too spicy. Well balanced\n5. Stir Fry calamari\n    We hated this dish. Awful spicy sauce. Will never order again.\n6. Stir Fry calms\n   Last dish and best of the entire evening. The sauce was perfect. We licked every calm and sauce.\n\nOverall 2.5  stars for the food.\nI had high of expectation from the rave reviews. But when I got there, the rabbit and frog were served deep fried. So I had to skip the dishes.\nYou can get steamed sea bass or steamed fish at many Chinese restaurants. The papaya salad was a huge letdown. Out of the 6 dishes we ordered, only one we really like. I tried to get our group to go back and taste more dishes, I thought maybe we ordered the wrong dishes. Nobody wanted to go back. Oh well. \n\nAbout the service. 2.5 stars\nThe table we had was so small it cannot fit all the food when it comes. it was so crowded my friend knock off his champagne and did not have a sip yet. We wipe the table ourselves. I ask for a table cloth, the girl came with 4 thin slices of the napkin and did not refill his champagne even though he did not even get to sip it yet.  Also, we had to bus our own table because the table was so small, we would pile up two dishes of food into one plate to make more space, and give the dirty plate to the ladies standing. \n\nAs a result of combining two dishes into one dish;  due to the dark light, by accident, I took a piece of green hot pepper and chewed on it, and it was like someone lit a fire inside my mouth. My eyes were watering. I was purging out fire and coughing for a while. It was so dark, my friends could not see how much I was suffering.  I drink ice water for like a half hour. I would not eat and taste anything for a while. \n\nIt wasn't a perfect evening, but hey it is the company you are with. At least that was 4 stars. \n\nParking can be painful", "author": "A Z."}

I would eat both of these dishes again.  We came here in search of non touristy authentic thai food.  \n\nI ordered a spicy wide noodle dish...the name escapes me.  After trying the red curry and spicy tofu, I was expecting to  be blown away by the flavors.  Instead I got what tasted like a bland pad see ew.  I started to wonder if I had the right dish so when the waitress came by asking how things were, I asked if this was the spicy noodle dish?  She said, oh is it not spicy?  I said, not at all, but if this is it, I'll just add spice to it myself.  She insisted on fixing it, so she took the plate back.  Out came a new dish with red bell peppers added to it that the original didn't have, plus more thai basil.  \n\nThe issue was it was MACH 5 hot.  You could visibly see the entire plate and each noodle coated in red pepper seeds. I couldn't even pick them off.  I tried to eat it, I swear, but after a few bites, I could no longer feel my tongue, my head was going to explode and I was sweating terribly.  My boyfriend said I looked like I was crying and VERY red.  \n\nThe waitress noticing my state comes back over and my mouth is so scorched I'm downing my beer so my boyfriend tells her its so hot we can't eat it.   So she insists on taking it back.  It comes back out with the added thai basil and the red bell peppers, and more sauce, but this time without the heat.  \n\nAll I can say is, be VERY specific when commenting about your food because the good thing is they will try to get it right, but I'm not sure what got lost in translation between the table, the waitress and the kitchen.", "author": "Julie C."}

The chicken in Pad See Yew was just bone dry and unpalatable, while the Yellow curry tasted overwhelmingly of coriander spice.  Food portions are extremely small for a la carte, which didn't matter even though we were four as the taste didn't pass muster.  Seating is quite cramped.  The entrees are served on large plates with little food in the center and the table just couldn't hold 4 dishes.   Given the neighborhod and decor inside, don't think Lers Ros should attempt haute Thai cuisine.   Felt let down by the very high rating on Yelp.

Little did we know there were such interesting things on the menu. After carefully selecting the alligator, rabbit and venison we were all excited. The rabbit came out first. Drenched in fried garlic, the little boned creature was quite tasty. Next the venison. This was done in a cracked black pepper sauce, with pepper corns the size of golf balls. Bite in to one of them by accident and straight to the dentist you go. Finally the alligator. Soaked in ginger and fresh peppercorn. (I have never had fresh pepper corn still attached to the branch) Pretty interesting. Overall the meal was a little disappointing. The rabbit might as well have been chicken, the venison could have been beef and the alligator tasted exactly like pork. I was happy that these items where on the menu, but was hoping for something really tasty and exotic. Overall, the dishes were simply overpriced chicken, pork and beef. 3 dishes + 2 beers = $85 including tip. Kind of pricey for Thai food. Tip: Stick with the normal dishes.", "author": "Howard C."}

Most places in the US cater to the American palate and create Ameri-Thai dishes.  Ler Ros (along with Marnee Thai and a few others in the city) do a good job creating Thai dishes.  This is one of the only places that I know of that you can get Muu Grop (fried pork belly).  The quality of the food makes it 5 stars, but the portion size is more like a true Thai portion size. This is somewhat frustrating since you pay much more for the food than you would in Thailand.  All in all though definitely worth the trip to this restaurant.", "author": "Joshua J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-03", "description": "Had a lunch with three others at Lers Ros today.  My mother is Thai so my tastebuds have experienced everything that Thai food can be over the years.  Bottom line: Lers Ros definitely beats anything I've had in the Bay Area so far (excepting not having yet tried Thai House Express), but doesn't quite rise to the level of \"top-notch quality Thai food\" that can be found on rare occasions in this country.  As much as there was subtlety and complexity in the flavors, which were very much authentic, the interplay of spices, heat, and ingredients can be taken to another level or two.  In recent personal experience, Thai Siam in Arrington, VA (hole in the wall place with four tables run by a retired woman who grows most of the ingredients she uses and widely considered the best Thai currently on the East Coast) is dish for dish superior to Lers Ros.  That said, here's a rundown of our impressions of the dishes today - \n\n#27 Tom ka gai - the balance of flavors was about 90% there - chicken quality was high but a bit skimpy on the amount of chicken.  Flavors should have included a bit more intensity in the kaffir lime (and no additional option of adding squeezed lime was provided).  All in all, a fine rendition, but there was one or two layers of flavor disappointingly absent (yet more layers than I've discovered in your run-of-the-mill Thai eatery).  Perhaps it needed more lemongrass?  Or pepper?  Something...\n\n#9 - Kao moo yang - I really enjoyed this dish.  Pork had a subtly smokey flavor to it, but not overwhelming.  Interplayed extremely well with the chili powder sauce.  I appreciated that the intensity of the spiciness was set at just the right level to allow for both the under- and overtones of distinct flavors to come together. \n\n#4 Thai herb sausage - judging by scoop amount, I seemed to like this dish more than others in my party did.  It was a very pleasant rendition of the SE Asian-style sausage, which is one of my favorite Asian products to begin with.  So maybe I have a lower threshold for giving my stamp of approval on this one, but I could find no faults.  Tender, juicy, flavorful, not greasy.  A winner in my book.\n\n#13 - Som Tom - green papaya salad.  hmm - I thought this dish failed just a bit.  Kitchen really went hog wild on the spice level, which in itself is not automatically a criticism.  Problem was that they let spiciness be the one and only star here.  The prawns were flavorless, and the lime dressing seemed strangely diluted.  The dish lacked cohesiveness - all of the flavors were distinct elements and just didn't come together.  \n\n\"Chicken puff\" special: samosas, basically, with a peanut dipping sauce.  The puffs and filling were quite nice - crispy outside without being too crunchy, and soft flavorful filling.  I found the peanut sauce to be lacking, however.  There wasn't enough kick to the sauce, and frankly it reminded me of the \"dumbed down\" version of peanut sauces one finds much too often in Americanized Thai restaurants.  Instead of a goo, in my opinion a peanut sauce that was more granular in nature, and with a brighter flavor to its base, would have provided a better texture combination with the puff filing. \n\n#62 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob stir-fried pork with crispy rind and basil leaves. Unlike some other reviews, I didn't find the pork to be swimming excessively in sauce, or the sauce to be particularly fatty.  I enjoyed the crispy rind on the pork too - a nice contrast in flavor and texture.  This was a very \"comforting\" dish - but I could see the addition of one or two more flavor undertones would really make this dish come alive more than it did. \n\n#77 Pad See Ew - deliberately chosen to be our \"bread and butter\" dish.  One of ubiquity so as to directly compare a comfort food staple with others.  Verdict: eh.  They really phoned this one in.  I appreciated the use of gai lan as opposed to Western broccoli, but still there was nothing to this dish over that which you can find in any Thai place.  The noodles were somewhat goupy.  Kitchen really didn't do much to accentuate the complexities that this dish, despite being a dark sauce dish, can achieve if you really put some interest into it. \n\n#113 - Quick fried marinated trout with mango sauce - YES SIR!  This was an absolute winner, and is worth the trip in itself.  Definitely the star of the meal.  Perfectly crispy, bones, tail, skin, everything edible.  The quintessential Thai \"fish and chips\" (where the \"chips\" are actually the extra crispy parts of the fish!).  Wonderful flavoring to the fry itself, and equally wonderful pairing of mango sauce.  \n\nFinal verdict - if all dishes had been on the level of the #113, Lers Ros would be up there with some of the best I'd experienced in this country (Thai Siam in rural Virginia, the late Zab-e-lee in Atlanta before the good owner moved back to Thailand, Thai House in Anchorage, Alaska, the old Bangkok Thai Cuisine in Mobile, AL).

The green curry w/tofu and Pra Ram Pak was delicous. The green curry serving was generous but the pra ram pak was a bit small and left me craving for more which is the only reason I'm giving it a 4.  I wish there was a little more tofu in both of the dishes too but we had some green curry left overs at the end.  The green curry was a little spicy for me but I can't really handle spicy food too well. This only slowed me down but didn't stop me from eating it.  The atmosphere was nice and the place was busy for 10:15 pm on a Sunday night and I wish that we had ate it there. I'll have to visit again next time I'm in town and dine there.

Definatly one of, if not the, best thai food I've had in many years. Easily located in downtown SF, this place really blew my mind. Started out with some Thai iced tea which is always fabulous and freshly prepared here; then we moved on to a spicy beef salad which when I say spicy, I mean SPICY. It always bothers me when restaurants claim that a dish is spicy and yet the dish comes out with very little, to no, spiciness. Not the case in this restaurant, spicy is no object here since I needed a refill of my thai iced tea to just calm my palate down. For the second and final course we ordered the fried pork belly and curried beef noodles; the noodles were a little too over cooked for my taste and were kind of lost in the sauce (which was good on its own). The pork belly was out of this world though; perfectly crispy skin with soft, dark meat underneath. All in all I would highly recommend the restaurant...", "author": "Andrew M."}

I am not a big fan of Thai food in general; I find the flavors generic and mundane, with many restaurants preparing food with far too much sugar (what is it about sweet Thai food?).  That said, Lers Ros is a very welcome departure from my typical Thai experience.\nI have been here several times and sampled the menu.  Their coconut soup is better than any other that I've had.  Rich flavors, well balanced with good quality ingredients.  \nThe pork belly dish is also a must.  Tender belly fried with the rind still on, giving it a ton of flavor and interesting textures.  \nFor a contrast to the belly, they offer a slow cooked (I think they refer to it as stewed) pork leg that is also delicious.  Very rich gravy, tender meet served with pickled greens.\nOn a different note I have never been disappointed with their whole fish.  We have had two from the menu and each has been delicious.\nI would pass on the vegetarian silver noodles... go with the meat-based entrees if you'd like to experience the best of this place.  \nA very unique and satisfying Thai restaurant.

Destined for the TL, more specifically Little Saigon, we were in search of something great, preferably hole in the wall.  While Lers Ros isn't really hole in the wall, it was great.  We shared a Som Tom green papaya salad (very spicy) with raw crab, which was interesting--sweet, but very hard to get out of the shells.  The curry puffs with peanut sauce are screaming to be made available for street food consumption (preferably close to where I live).  I had a Tom Kha soup, which was aromatic and rich as it should be and had lots of delicious oyster mushrooms (rather than the canned brown buttons that will sometimes be sneaked in).  My boyfriend had a pork belly dish that was utterly succulent.  Next time we go back we'll be more adventurous and order some of the fried quail, frogs leg, pig entrails...well, not that last one.  Maybe this place was so good because we just happened upon it, but I have a feeling a return visit will be just as wonderful, especially since the waitresses were so nice.

I decided to ignore this because the food is suppose to be good right?  Wrong!  I ordered the green curry chicken, it didn't have any eggplant like it said it would and the chicken was so tough I could barely cut it with my fork.  I was disappointed.  My husband had the tofu with mixed vegetables.  The tofu was mushy and it was way too spicy.  One of our friends had the shrimp and veggies, the shrimp was mushy and again too hot!
