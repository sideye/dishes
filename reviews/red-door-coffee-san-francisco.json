Pleasantly surprised with the chai flavor not compromised by added caffeine. Well balanced, smooth, and pre-sweetened.\n\nOCD alert - some people I know complain about that if the seam of the coffee cup is aligned a certain way, coffee can drip into shirts etc. but this cup *actually* has markings for barista to align the sip hole for coffee lids... I guess there are more people who care about this than I originally thought. Personally, I am not particular as to coffee seam/sip hole issues, but I admired the ergonomics of the coffee cup lid. Guess these are the things that make coffee worth $5 :P but at least I feel it better justified with all the extras you get at Red Door versus some other $5 spots in FiDi...!", "author": "S J."}

We went to Red Door Coffee, a place that I used to frequent quite often for both coffee in the morning and afternoon and drinks in the evening.  However, this last time I went there I was rudely KICKED OUT with my 2 year old son at 845am while having coffee and while my son was mid-bite in his salted caramel donut (which is terrible and sticky, btw).  I was confronted by someone claiming to be the manager that children were not allowed in the coffee shop, because the art gallery is 21 and over.  AGAIN, this was 845am in the morning and everyone was peacefully drinking their coffee or eating whatever pastry they ordered.   I asked him \"are you serious? it's 845am\" and also \"who is telling us to leave?\" he claimed it was the Owners of the place.  Everyone started looking at us, what I hope was in shock, that an asshole was kicking out a father and toddler from having coffee and a donut in the morning.  I am hoping that this was just a lapse in this inexperienced manager's judgment and not something worst like being racist, which also crossed my mind.  I tried calling into the establishment a few times and no-one picked up, and only got voicemail, but I hope they see this review and re-think how they approach this next time.  I know for sure that I certainly won't be going here anymore as their COFFEE SHOP is clearly not kid welcoming.  \n\nPS - I was trying to snap a photo of my son eating his donut, but actually caught him looking at the guy instead as he wouldn't even let him finish his bite of the shitty donut before asking us to leave.", "author": "Kyle I."}

The menu is minimal but you can't leave unsatisfied with what they do offer: coffee, donuts, and toast. The coffee is four barrel coffee, the donuts are from Dynamo Donuts, and the toast is from Josey Baker Bread (plus you slather jams/butter on top).\n\nI typically grab a small cup of coffee -- no room -- and wheat toast with butter and plum jam. I've only gotten donuts once because I was so excited to see them, but knowing they're there gives me a strange sense of comfort. \n\nThe ambiance is amazing. The furniture is modern but earthy. You get a strong sense of space when you walk in. It feels like a place where you can take a moment to sit and eat your toast without worrying about the wifi password. And of course it also serves as an art gallery so you'll be surrounded with some interesting if not attractive pieces that constantly rotate so you never get too stale. \n\nI think people complained about service. It's been fine to me. Not perky and cheerful, but not dismissive either -- just calm. I dig it.\n\nSo why the missing star? Their set of three menu items is inconsistent. Some days there'll be toast but no donuts, donuts but no toast, and on the worst days no toast OR donuts (the horror!). If they could get a consistent menu going I would definitely give them that fifth star. I'd also not be embarrassed about the three whole times I've invited my coworker to try the toast only to discover they weren't serving it.\n\nEither way, I see this place getting better and I like where it's heading.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-26", "description": "I gotta up this place to a 5/5 because it's closer to a 5 than a 4, and I hardly give a 5.  The drip coffee has dramatically improved.  Environmentally friendly and healthy is noticed in nearly every aspect of what they do, from compostable packaging to Straus organic milk to local/organic Dynamo Donuts.  What I found interesting is these details are not highlighted anywhere.  For example, they could easily display \"We use Straus organic milk\" somewhere which I'm sure would bring in business.  Recently I also noticed manual drip cones and a new case to display the donuts.  I also love the music selection and art.  The ambiance is fantastic.  You can't really ask for much more.\n\nUpdate: They started serving Josey Baker Bread toast a few months ago with toppings like butter, cream cheese, and various fruit spreads by June Taylor.  I was amazed how such simple ingredients put together could be so delicious.  It is one of, if not the best bread I've ever had.\n\nUpdate 2: Found out the butter used for the toast is by Berkeley Farms, an odd choice considering other ingredients used are from top notch suppliers including Straus, Four Barrel, and TCHO.  Dear RDC, I'd gladly pay an extra 25 cents for higher quality butter such as Kerrygold, or Straus or Organic Valley if it must be local.  Then again, how much can a pat of butter possibly eat into profits?\n\nUpdate 3: Dear RDC, please dump that nasty bottle of liquid sugar (what is supposed to be \"simple\" syrup but it's not really simple) for the real stuff.  It has HFCS and preservatives in it which is a stark contrast to your other high quality ingredients.\n\nUpdate on Update 2: After contacting RDC, the manager switched to Sierra Nevada butter within a few weeks.  Now that's listening to your customers!", "author": "Nader Z."}

Because really, what is Blue Bottle without latte art?!\n\nI'm still giving it 4 stars because it's a cool place with art on the walls and a nice vibe. Also because I've worked as a barista, and I know how much morning rushes suck. However, people pay top dollar for quality, not mediocrity.

I asked what he recommended and he replied with, \"it's pretty basic here, coffee, tea, cocoa. We don't have syrup, and there's toast/doughnuts over there...\" THATS IT!? What's your best drink ? What the hell is YOUR favorite drink? I felt like he almost didn't want new customers coming in.. All in all we spent a little over $16 on some \"basic\" coffee and bread.

After going to the coffee shop 3 times I have now decided that I can no longer go there. They need a serious wake up call to being competitive. \n\nAfter ordering a triple shot latte (as there coffee is so weak- like Starbucks weak) and asking for less milk (as even the small has too much milk compared to coffee (and is still  too weak) they charged me $6!! $6 for a weak latte that doesn't even match the standard of the worst coffee shop in NY or Internationally.\n\nThe staff are also rude here - even when you go out of your way to extra nice to them they act as if they are doing you a favor. These guys need to get real and realize that they are not competitive and I will continue my search for good coffee downtown - watch out SF coffee stores the new players are coming to SF and you will be out of business when you get an education on what real coffee should taste like and what real service is!", "author": "Jen M."}

Though I'd prefer individual pourover, this is a very reasonable compromise when you need an excellent cup, fast.  Price is right - $2/cup.  One word of caution -  medium to lighter roasts are the focus here so if you prefer dark roasts (eg Peets, Starbucks, etc), this might not be your style.   Full complement of espresso drinks are equally good.  \n\nFood is rather limited.  Mostly thick cut toast and donuts.\n\nService is warm and friendly.  No 'tude or pretentiousness.
