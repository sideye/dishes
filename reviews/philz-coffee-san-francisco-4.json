Personally, I love a good unsweetened black iced coffee on the daily but Philz makes the best coffee drink out there. This was the first location I ever went but am so glad they have expanded all over California and even to DC. I'm impatiently waiting for a NYC location to open one day. \n\nThe Mint Mojito usually comes sweet and creamy with delicious iced coffee, made fresh right before your eyes on a simple drip device. The drink is served with a fresh mint leaf stem, giving the drink its unique incredibly fresh mint flavor. The flavors come together in perfect harmony for the best tasting coffee drink you can imagine.\n\nThis place is a must for locals and tourists alike and should definitely be on your list!", "author": "Courtney B."}

Recommended to me by several different people this chain specializes in the classic pour over in a variety of different flavors. I told my friend it was a must, at least for one of the days we were here, so I'm happy that we were finally able to cross if off our list.\n\nWe arrived around 8 AM on a Friday morning. When we walked in they had just opened and had only one person waiting for their coffee. The space itself is not too large, but it shares a seating area with another coffee shop adjacent to it within the same building. Within the space where you order your beverage they also have a counter with pastries you're able to purchase as well.\n\nWhen it came time to order I settled on the Philtered Soul and an Almond croissant (around $8 all together). I was surprised the second I sipped on my drink. I usually put a half a sugar in my coffee for flavor purposes but this drink was amazing as is! Not too sweet and not too bland, they definitely knew the right proportion of hazelnut and chocolate flavoring to make it an exceptional cup of coffee. I was extremely impressed.\n\nAll I can say is that if they had this chain on the East coast, especially in NYC, I'd almost certainly be making a trip here every week.", "author": "Nicholas C."}

Otherwise, after ordering and paying, you'll stand and wait at a small gap between the ordering-line and the register. The register is opposite side of the coffee station (odd setup really).\n\nThe times I've gone (late mornings and early afternoons) there's been no line to a line out the door so YMMV whenever you show up.

All I get is the mint mojito, which is dangerously addicting!! The barista was kind and shared much of his knowledge of how to make a delicious mint mojito. He told me the details of a drip coffee machine, how to get a strong mint flavor, and how to make the milk extra frothy. They put a generous amount of heavy whipping cream, which gave the drink such a decadent, rich flavor. Only complaint is that the mint mojito is quite pricey for the large cup: $5.60. That doesn't seem sustainable... I'm also kind of confused about the layout of the place. So you have the actual Philz place, which only has one 2-person table, and you have a common area across the cafe in a separate room. Unlike some other branches, there are very limited food options. Other Philz stores have avocado toast and many other goodies.", "author": "Louis Suo L."}

Today when I went I got a large mocha Tesoro and there was coco powder overpowering my drink and making it taste chalky. As you can see in the picture. On top of that there are always loud grungy kids hanging around there that don't buy anything. The people who work there are lazy and joke around.

Ordering and sitting areas are separated. Probably because of how the building is. It's actually kind of nice, because it makes the sitting area a little quieter :P\n\nMy recommendations:\n- My favorite blends to drink black are probably Philtered Soul and Hazelnut.\n- Sometimes I like doing half Philtered Soul and half Yerba Mate, which gives the coffee a more herbal flavor. Not everyone's cup of tea (haha get it), but it's an interesting alternative if you wanna try something different.\n- If you want something on the sweet side, go for a White Christmas - 1/2 Greater Alarm + 1/2 Hazelnut with cinnamon and nutmeg in the filter, sweet and creamy.\n- On a hot day, look no further than the Iced Coffee, extra sweet, extra creamy. Terrible for the arteries, wonderful for the soul :) The Mint Mojito and iced Mocha Tesora are also great options!\n\nParking is... Well, what you'd expect for SF.

I bought a cup of coffee to go struggled to get the top to fit on the cup, and then it appeared to fit on and I left.  After getting in my car I put the cup in my cupholder, while I was driving I picked up the cup and attempted to take a sip from the cup and the cap fell off when I tipped it into my mouth and hot coffee spilled all over me.  The frightening thing about it all is that it stunned me and I had to slam on my brakes almost causing an accident.  \n\nI had to pull over to collect myself and wipe the coffee off of my chest, neck, etc.. What really makes all of this much worse is when I called the store to tell them what had happened some guy got on the phone and was incredibly rude and then started to tell me it was my fault, followed by some other sarcastic comments. \n\nThis afternoon I went to Reveille on 18th in the Castro and they had the same cup and paid particular attention to the top and how it fit on the cup so as not to have another incident like the day before and their tops are different than the ones used by Philz and fit securely and clearly made for that cup.  Philz charges close to $5 for a the cup I bought as does Reveille\u200b and cutting corners on tops that do not fit their cups is pretty absurd, as was rude and defensive guy on the phone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-27", "description": "Oh, Philz. I first had Philz Coffee at the Santa Monica location in So Cal, and it may have been my imagination, but it just tasted better in San Fran.\n\nMy friend and I made a stop at Philz early in the morning before going out for brunch on a Saturday (we were going to Brenda's French Soul Food, and this location was super close to it). Because it was around 7:30 a.m. on the weekend, we didn't even have to wait in line at Philz ... in fact, there was no line. \n\nI liked this Philz immediately because of the adjoining room, where there were outlets and multiple tables where you could just hang out and enjoy your coffee. We both only ordered coffee because we were on our way to brunch, but the pastries and snacks at Philz definitely were tempting ... they all looked delicious.\n\nService is always great at Philz, meaning the baristas have always been helpful to me and great at making recommendations ... and not getting impatient when I can't make up my mind. My friend and I went with our tried-and-true favorites during this visit.\n\nNote: If you bring your own cup/mug, you can pay the price of a small at Philz (or so I was told). Great way to cut down on cup costs.\n\nHere's what we got: \n\n\"Mint Mojito Ice Coffee\": This is one of the most well known drinks at Phiz. It's minty, sweet and creamy. I don't love mint, but my friend does, so this is one of her favorite drinks. It's refreshing because of the mint and it's something totally different (not your traditional latte). This drink has to be one of the most photogenic items on the menu because of that signature mint leaf. \n\n\"Mocha Tesora\": While you can get this drink hot or iced, I opted for a hot drink because it was a chilly morning. I got the Mocha Tesora during my previous Philz visit in So Cal, and it was as good as I remembered it to be. This specialty coffee consisted of fine cocoa and it was earthy and rich. The menu description embodies this drink perfectly. I felt like I could taste the cocoa grains in each sip, and I loved the rich, dark, earthy, chocolate taste. This is a great option for anyone that loves mocha. I ordered mine with soy and was grateful that there was no extra charge. \n\n\"Gingersnap Ice Coffee\": This drink came highly recommended, and since I love gingerbread, I contemplated ordering it for a moment. But, given that I had to choose between this and Mocha Tesora, the mocha (chocolate) won. If I'm ever wanting to try something different, though, I want to order this option. It's spicy, sweet and creamy, the perfect option for anyone that especially likes ginger. I also wanted a hot drink, and this one was recommended as staying iced. Perhaps if I'm in town on a hot day, I'll opt for this best seller. \n\n\"Philtered Soul\": This was another drink I had contemplated ordering, just because the ingredients sounded so good. The \"Philtered Soul\" is a medium roast and includes hazelnut, cocoa and syrup. I love hazelnut, so I was curious about this drink. Perhaps, one of these days, I will deviate from the Mocha Tesora I love so much and try something new. I'm sure I would like this because there's hazelnut in it.", "author": "Kelli S."}

Even if the barista was \"having a bad day,\" there is absolutely no excuse to treat customers like she did. Everything could have been handled very differently. \n\nInstead of a simple apology from a manager or the barista, her friends have sent us messages accusing us of being *gasp* \"selfish, greedy techies ruining the \"uniqueness of the Bay Area.\" Because only techies can be upset by unprofessional, rude behavior? Which is a viewpoint that I'm sure Philz would not want to be perpetuated. Smh...\n\nWe ordered ahead 4 iced coffees on Caviar.

The barista at the end hadn't produced any coffees and her antagonistic behavior was escalating. First she complained aloud about working her station and the iced coffees orders. Then she said she wanted to KILL herself in front of everyone in the store as her coworkers laughed it off and the customers looked around at each other. ???\n\nSeeing that she was overwhelmed, we continued to wait patiently. She continued to slam coffee liners down and complain aloud about her job. After another 5 minutes, two people dared to ask about their orders. She scolded both of them with, \"Whats your name? I don't know you! I can't make your coffee if I don't know you're here.\" (Um, wait what??) After she made their coffees, I asked about our order and she pointed to a line of small print on one of their signs saying to let her \"know you're here\" and that she NEVER makes iced coffee ahead to leave on the counter because it gets watery.\n\nRudeness aside, I can accept that we missed the memo to explicitly tell her to make our coffee, but it could have been kindly pointed out to us.

A quick Google search showed us that there was a location semi-close to the hotel we were staying at, so we decided to pop in on Sunday afternoon.\n\nI had the Ecstatic iced coffee (supposedly with notes of nuts and toffee), which was good. It had a nice flavor to it but it wasn't anything outstanding. But my friend had the Mint Mojito (+$1), which is also iced, and I really liked it. I liked it so much that we hunted down another Philz location in the area we happened to be exploring the next day, and ordered myself one. It sounds a little weird and you'll probably think of the alcoholic drink - but it isn't really anything like that. It's sweet and creamy, and has a light mint flavor.  I would say it's as if somebody blended a piece of Andes chocolates into your iced coffee.\n\nThe reason for the three stars is really just due to its price and their speed. At $4.50 for a mint mojito, that isn't something I can really justify getting everyday if I lived in San Francisco. As for the speed, if you're in a rush, it's probably best to skip Philz. I'm sure it takes extra time for the baristas to craft one of the drinks, but I just can't find myself to silence the New Yorker in me.

TLDR; the barista working when I came to this location was horrendous!!\n\nMy group of 4 ordered ahead using the Caviar app, because we were kinda in a rush and we know that good coffee takes some time. We walked in and let one of the baristas know we were here for an online order. He told us that we could pick it up at the last station. The barista looked busy doing stuff, so we figured she was making our coffee. We stood right in front of the station, in sight of the barista, and patiently waited.\n\nThings got really awkward when the barista started complaining to her coworkers about how she \"wanted off this station\" because there were sooooo many online orders and how she was \"going to kill (her)self\"... I'll also add that she did not complain quietly and was basically yelling this out loud in front of our group and other customers in the store. \n\nAfter about 10min, 2 other people stood next to us, waiting for online orders, and one guy asked if his was ready. The same barista who was complaining earlier sharply told him....\"Well what's your name?! I don't know you...\" GEEZ!! He told her and she quickly made his coffee.\n\nThe same interaction happened with the other girl who had ordered online and with our group. She was extremely sassy and rude... telling us to \"read the sign\" and that \"she doesn't know who we are\"... she basically blamed us for the 30 min wait. I completely understand she doesn't know us, but there are good and bad ways to handle the situation. Not to mention, she made the worst mint mojito I've ever had. The other employees weren't rude, but weren't very helpful either because they saw us standing there and didn't say anything.\n\nShe completely ruined my Philz experience, which is usually like a small taste of heaven.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be coming back to this location.", "author": "Tia O."}

If you're into Feng Shui, I bet it would be full of bad Feng Shui, with doorways and spaces running into each other and having totally the wrong flow. It's on Van Ness, a big boulevard that's odd, foggy, chilly and uncomfortable itself. There's a reason Opera Plaza's theater is \"only\" about $10 for regular tickets - people don't want to hang out in that area. \n\nThey have the oddest two-storefront getup here - the counter, register, and a small table are on the right side, and the main seating area is at another storefront right next door. You have to enter one store to buy the drink, then go out and enter the store next door to sit down. And that main seating area has always felt awkward and uncomfortable. \n\nEmployees have gone way downhill since Philz first opened, when it was a renegade indie coffee shop with a supposed passion for Turkish-inspired coffee. Philz used to specialize in excellent, warm customer service and very knowledgeable employees - but now the employees seem cold, indifferent, and dumber than rocks. \n\nThe last time I was here, the young hipster girl with the clear glasses and cutoff shorts actually asked me, \"Did you order at the bar?\" WHAT? She thought I didn't belong at Philz, and singled me out for that question, when I've been to that location and all other Philz in SF many times.

There was hardly any greeting but I didn't care about that. Male barista was juggling 3-4 orders already and asked what I wanted. I said \"large iced mint mojito, medium sugar and cream\" and then I waited. It took maybe about 10 minutes tops, and I paid at the cashier while waiting for my drink. Cashier dude was nice, hence the extra star.\n\nAfter a little while, I noticed a (medium-sized) drink was sitting on the counter by its lonesome self and I wasn't quite sure if it was mine. Eventually, more customers were leaving and I was one of the few remaining so I went up there to ask if this was my drink. My barista said yes, so I proceeded to ask him if this was a large since this looks like a medium. He dryly said, \"I heard you said medium.\" When I nicely corrected that I said large size but medium sugar & cream, he just shrugged and \"re-made\" the drink (although I'm pretty sure he poured the same drink into a larger cup since he basically gave it back to me after 10 sec). There was no apology or anything about the misunderstanding. On top of that, another barista was talking shit about another customer that had left, right in front of me. I'm not against shit-talking, but working in customer service myself, I'm pretty sure you should wait until other customers are gone.", "author": "Tee C."}

Nah, you don't have to be a hipster, tech yuppie, or wanderlust to enjoy one of their many unique caffeinated concoctions.\n\nTheir mint mojito iced coffee is best enjoyed on a warm summer day - rare in foggy SF, I know - but leaves an amazing aftertaste following every sip. The drink is on the lighter side on coffee and is sweeter as well.\n\nThe Philtered Soul is a medium roast with hazelnut. I opted for a bit of non-fat milk and a small pump of hazelnut flavoring, which didn't overshadow the bold brew. I definitely struggled to finish the larger size!\n\nThe menu can be a bit overwhelming as everything looks so good and the names are pretty catchy! the staff are friendly and provide great recommendations. Here's to hoping they'll consider opening a location in San Diego!", "author": "Christina T."}

On this trip to SF, I was excited to be in the birthplace of Philz because I would finally be able to have it in its hometown. However, I was quite disappointed with my first Philz experience in San Francisco. I didn't go to the original location, I went to the one nearest to my hotel. I ordered my usual large mint Mojito iced coffee. It just did not taste good. It tasted watered down and burnt/acidic. I drank most of it because I felt I had to but I couldn't finish the whole drink because it was just a cup that was too full of disappointment. It pains me to give it 2 stars! It should be 1, but it's Philz!\n\nThe space itself looks like an express Philz. There is a separate seating area across the way where there were many people working on their laptops. The staff appeared to be friendly. When there were no customers (other than my friend and I sitting at the little table near the front counter), they were sword fighting with a child (I think she was one of their kids?) and just messing around, running around the tiny shop.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-03", "description": "I heard a lot of raves about Philz Coffee for a long time before I made my first visit.  $3.50 for a small coffee and $4.50 for a large.  The large was really just a medium-sized coffee.  It was a smooth and tasty, medium roast.  I'm not partial to fancy coffees, however.  A lot of fuss and preparation went into making my coffee, which I found needlessly pompous.  \"Want me to recommend something for you?\" the young male cashier asked me when I told him I just wanted a regular cup of coffee.  I noticed on the board over our heads listing the coffee menu that there were no prices for any coffee and no offerings for organic coffee either.  \n\nWhile the coffee server was friendly and the cashier polite, the place was dark and no one offered to tell me where to find napkins or extra cream if I wanted any.  The staff impressed me as young people who cater familiarly only to regulars, not newcomers.  (As I paid for my coffee, I heard the cashier recite to a female customer what the code was to use the lady's bathroom.) The sweet offerings on display in a glass case nearby the cash register were pricey as well. I felt I was visiting the financial district -- except the prissy decor was absent.\n\nI had to exit the shop and walk through another doorway to enter the coffee shop proper where seating was.  The music was jazz-rap and it was unpleasantly heavy in volume.  Nobody came in to clean up the detritus left by other customers.  \n\nPoor lads and students with connoisseur taste in coffee find this place \"cool.\"  But outside of the tasty if pricey coffee itself, this hangout place to be was little more than a claustrophobic, noisy, oversized closet with one picture window. I removed myself from a table to avoid the loud music and took another table farther away, but the removal made no difference at all.  The sound someone deemed \"music\" continued to penetrate irritatingly everywhere in equal measure.  \n\nThe H20 Caf\u00e9 on Polk Street, which is frequented by the homeless and crazy as well as the working class, has a coffeehouse ambiance that, by comparison, actually is one step above this place if you want to read, study, concentrate or work.  That is, the music isn't as loud, the coffee is cheaper, and there's no connoisseur pretense whatsoever.", "author": "Charles S."}

If you come here this is one of the coffee shops you have to visit (No joke). Why?\n\nPros-\n-There's only 29 locations as of January 2016 and it's pretty good at making the drop coffee there and also a major player in making third wave coffee. \n- The baristas there are very sweet and would recommend you try it first before you leave the store so you can be satisfied with your drink! They all seem very professional. \n- The Mint Mojito Ice Coffee here (A classic favorite here) is delicious and priced at $5.00. Not bad!\n- No taxes here!\n- Famous drinks here that are exclusive to only the West Coast! \n\n\nCons-\n- If you want to get coffee before you go to work, good luck. The line here are pretty busy here in the morning around 6-8 AM in the morning!\n- The coffee is pretty if you ask me. Was it worth it? I personally thought it was but I wouldn't drink it everyday. I would be broke by the end of the week if I ordered the coffee here everyday which can be ranging from 5-10 dollars per drink! \n- There are usually no seats here unless you get here really early or come when it's less busy.\n- The coffee takes a while to make especially when there is a lot of people. \n\nHelpful tips-\nThe ordering here is kind of different. What happens if that you get in line and order your drink. After you order, you pay where the cashier is. You do NOT pay your barista.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-14", "description": "I worked at this Philz and I'm here to give you my honest opinion about the place and a little run-down of how Philz works in comparison to other coffee places. I think it's safe to say that compared to most coffee chains, Philz offers a richer, stronger cup of coffee. And one of the reasons for that is that they grind the beans individually for each cup and each cup is a pour-over single. So the blend you chose is prepared in a single serving just for you. \n\nBeing someone who has a pretty low tolerance for caffeine I can say that this coffee IS strong/ stronger than most places. If you are looking for that mega caffeine boost this is the place, and you can get it without the espresso shots, because the coffee is truly that strong (varying between lighter and darker roasts of course). But if you're looking for lots of sweet, whip cream covered specialty drinks, this is not the place for you (although we do have a few specialty drinks). Philz specializes more in straight up coffee blends.\n\nSo here's how this place works: the menu is about 3/4 coffee blends broken up into (light, medium and dark blends). Each blend is unique and it might take a while for you to find the blend that is your favorite. (Literally every regular customer has a different favorite. Mine is the Ambrosia, but that's just me!) \n\nOnce you've selected your blend and size you specify to the barista how you want it creamed and sweetened. The baristas do all the adding of cream and sugar themselves, which is different from most places, therefor you just let them know how you usually take your coffee. The standard cream and sugar options are heavy whipping cream (before it's been fully whipped into whipped cream) and brown sugar. I like that the modifiers to the drinks are so pure and straightforward. There's no syrups or artificial flavoring, just good ol'fashioned cream and brown sugar. You also have the choice of different cream options if you prefer: whole milk, nonfat milk, 2%, almond milk, soy milk and vanilla soy milk. For sugars they do keep the main alternative sugars on hand (Splenda, Equal, Stevia etc). \n\nAnd that's it! Once you're drink is done the barista will usually ask you to taste it and let them know how it is (except if it's black of course). This is because they add the sugar and cream themselves so they wanna make sure they get it to taste. Please DON'T BE SHY about asking for more or less of anything. It's no trouble at all for the baristas and they do it all day. \n\nIn addition to the blends, Philz features a few specialty drinks: a mocha, a chai, a sweet, minty drink called the Mint Mojito, a sweet, spicy drink called the Gingersnap and hot chocolate. The Mint Mojito is clearly the most popular on Yelp and in the store this proves true too. Perhaps it's the fun, photogenic mint leaves on top. However, I must say the Gingersnap is by far my favorite of the two. Absolutely deliciously sweet and spicy like a Gingersnap cookie. \n\n(Pro Tip: A secret menu specialty drink is The Oatmeal Cookie. Also DELICIOUS and somehow defying all science tastes exactly like a liquified oatmeal cookie)\n\nFinally, there are several teas: green, black, Yerba mate and chamomile, in addition to a few specialty teas as well. I don't recommend the green tea, the black tea is decent, I personally despise the Yerba mate and the chamomile tea is decent. But in general, if you're a tea connoisseur, go to a tea shop and not a coffee shop. Coffee shops know coffee better than tea generally speaking. With that said the Istanbul Treat (one of the specialty teas) is quite nice with a little honey. (Honey is also always an option if your prefer). \n\nAnd there it is!

Go here. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nI'm not particularly picky when it comes to my coffee (or more commonly, my tea), but after walking what must have been three miles or so around SFO with a friend, I was desperate for something cold and caffeinated. My experience at Philz provided much needed relief in addition to showing me how a true coffee shop should be run. At the end of the day, does it make sense for you to place your order with someone who is simply going to relay it to the actual barista? Of course not! At Philz they've split the process, and they've done so for the better. You place your order with your actual barista, who is full of knowledge and helpful tips. After that, you turn around and you pay at the counter, handing over your cash to a quick and friendly man in my case who kept me laughing. Brilliant. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\n\"What can I get you?\" the barista asks, in a way that's friendly but tells me that this man is an expert of his craft. Goodness me what do I want? I know very little about coffee, but I know that I like things low on the sweetness scale but with some good flavor. Oh and I want it iced for sure. \"Ecstatic Ice Coffee would be your best bet - I can tone down the sweetness\". Let's do it. A large? $4.00. Brilliant. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nWow. Again, this was seriously some fantastic coffee, and that's coming from someone who has little appreciation for good coffee. My barista dished up exactly what I was looking for at the time and temperature that I wanted it, and I was smitten with the blend. The one downside was that there was an absolutely ridiculous amount of ice in my cup, which quickly melted and dulled the flavor pretty quickly. Besides that? This was excellent. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nI absolutely would.

Today on the other hand, I walked in and was told to wait near the end of the store for my online order. Zoe continued to go on and on about complaining about essentially doing her job (while not doing it, she made 1 coffee when I was there for 15 minutes patiently waiting). We finally asked for our coffees after waiting and she rolled her eyes and said I don't know who you are how am I supposed to make your coffee? I order online so I wouldn't have to wait for my coffee... if I had to check in with her I would've just ordered it at the store. She proceeded to make my coffee orders, sighing, slamming coffee filters, etc. and then placed them on the table. Three iced mint mojito's (no mint provided...) and one ice tesora. I looked at the cups and tried to figure out which was my personal order, the iced tesora. She rudely stated \"tesora is written on the top...\" and proceeded to roll her eyes, again...

I'm not sure why maybe I stood in here dazed or maybe I was wired even before they served me my iced caffeine.\n\nAnyways what I do remember clearly was that my wife ordered their most talked about MInt Mojito Iced Coffee. She shared it with me and that tasted awesome! I never had anything like this before but hey its highly recommended! Just don't try to be funny like what my wife was doing when she plays with those mojito leaves on her tongue to expose at me, while drinking it.\n\nOverall excellent joint! I've been to a few coffee places that serve boring standard coffees but this place wins with its uniqueness for Iced coffee, that feeds Iced blooded hounds like myself!", "author": "Jon B."}

They also don't put the ice until you arrive if you order iced drinks so it doesn't get watered down. \n- They offer bagels next door with a larger seating area unlike the other Philz locations where it is all combined. \n\nImprovements\n- When it gets crowded, there isn't much space to stand and wait around. \n\nTips\n- Parking can be difficult since it is all metered parking on a busy street or the smaller shadier side streets.

The each cup made to order approach is noteworthy. They'll add cream and sugar for you if you'd like.

After all, this is my 4th Philz review and the 4th time I'm giving him five stars. Granted this is a different location, but what is the point of being so redundant? Because I think Philz is still in the upper echelon of caffeine nirvana. Sure, I like Blue Bottle, Stumptown, Ritual, Four Barrel, Sightglass, and all the other usual suspects, but good ol' Phil is like the uncle that embarrassed you at family get-togethers when you were little and he had his undershorts on outside his pants. I don't see him often (...weddings, funerals and the occasional bar mitzvah), but when I do, it's comforting and what's more, I get a first-class cup of handmade java.\n\nJamie W. and I just happened to be walking on Van Ness, a rarity for us since Van Ness always makes us feel like we're walking on the side of a highway and that we should be wearing orange jumpsuits and picking up trash. Alas, I tend to forget this Philz is even here since it's on the compact, nondescript side with a surprise adjacent room for actual socializing. For the first time, I tried the $4 large cup of the Silken Splendor, which is what I believe is one of their newer blends. Buttery and chocolaty but not overly so like a mocha. It's medium-dark and plenty rich enough for me to savor as I brave the crosswalk to Opera Plaza. OK, maybe this review wasn't that pointless.\n\nCOFFEE - 5 stars...oh Uncle Phil, put your underwear away\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...tight quarters here\nSERVICE - 4 stars...waiting for the drip is all there is\nTOTAL - 5 stars...it's about the flavor, stupid", "author": "Ed U."}

After a 20 minute cab ride we finally arrived and surprisingly, it was not that busy. The way you order there can be a bit confusing because you go up to the barista first to order and then they your order while you are paying, or at least that was what happened with us. I honestly did not look at the menu because I knew what I wanted, but I know that everything there was purely brewed coffee. My boyfriend isn't much of a coffee drinker, but he ordered the same drink that i did, except the only difference was his is on the creamier, sweeter side. They brew each order in batches or individually, but they are all hand poured which I am a big fan of. \n\nWhen our order was ready the barista asked us to try it first before we left to insure it was to our liking which it was! The taste is SO different, but in a good way. There are a lot of mint leaves at the bottom, but I do not mind and I take it out before it become too overpowering.

Could not understand why because the aroma is extraordinary and many cafes which I passed by has no aroma at all! Finally understood today as they sell freshly grind coffee powder from beans in the store. \n\nStepped into the cafe and was very surprised that as a coffee lover myself, I was taken aback by the names on the menu board! First time ever, I didn't know how and what coffee to order! They classify their coffee beans according to dark, medium and light roast with fanciful and elaborated names (see photo attached).\nNo worries about that as the barista here is extremely friendly and approachable. I told the barista that this is my first time here and I ask for his recommendation as the names are too fanciful for me. Barista Chargo (sorry if I spell the name incorrectly) is very passionate and very confident about his coffee. He said he could make me the coffee he drinks and if I don't like it, he could make me another one.\nI was immediately convinced by his confidence and professionalism. I told him my preference of strong tasting coffee with milk but I needed to sleep so higher caffeine content is not the requirement. He clearly understood and recommended a customised blend of silken splendor plus philtered best. Good on him! \nI went to the cashier to pay and chitchatted with the extremely friendly cashier and the other barista. The whole experience was very pleasant.\n\nThen my coffee was ready and I took my first sip of the freshly made coffee. Barista Chargo asked if I liked the coffee and was concerned. I was astonished by the unique taste of the well blended coffee with the very balance taste of milk. The aroma of the coffee lingered on still in my room as I wrote this review live. \nI told Chargo that I rate his coffee 4.7 upon 5 and he was very pleased. His passion for coffee is so deep you can see it from his expression if joy. It is thanks to people like him that makes coffee so awesome for us coffee lover to enjoy! \nI will definitely come back and will definitely become a fan of Philz coffee. I will forget about Pts and SBucks. Those seem like a joke ever since I knew this very high standard Philz coffee.\nGood job and keep up the excellence!

I didn't really want to. We gave it a shot in therapy and I followed the therapists recommendation. Try new things. Try to be different. Try to be less selfish. I tried it all. And I came up with the same result. The coffee sucks! I used to love it! I used to enjoy every drop in the cup, but something happened. I know what it was too. I started drinking real coffee from real coffee producers. I've dated Victrola in Seattle, Stumptown in Portland, Verve is Santa Cruz. Verve is smokin' hot right now too. After all of those amazing coffees I'd come back to this gal and she was still the same girl I knew from way back when. I just decided to say it. Say it out loud to be heard by all. So the other night, after another date, I was all like, IT'S NOT YOU.... IT'S ME!!!!! \n\nI used to love her, but now she's just a girl. A girl who isn't that much fun anymore and now she's less adventurous and I am SUPER adventurous n stuff. So, allow me to say it from the rooftop for Yelp to hear. This coffee just isn't for me. It's boring, it doesn't taste good, it is way better than Evil Mermaid, but that's the thing. I don't get down with that broad either! So, a quick note to the person who is going to drop me a message in my Yelp inbox, don't sweat it hun. I still love all y'all. I love Phil, his hat, his Mo. Love em all. I'd even suggest that a friend try it out if they have never been. I just can't drink sub par to bad coffee anymore. \n\nI know it's tough to cut the cord and often times that starts, for me at least, with ripping up pictures, defriending from FB and blocking your calls. Done, done and yes, done. \n\nThanks for showing me that coffee needs to be better. Thanks for giving me the space to feel my feelings, to understand my high maintenance approach to coffee.

You may not have noticed because it's split into two areas - the coffee shop side and the deli side. The deli side has many many tables. I spent several hours there working last week. It might not be in the fanciest part of town, but I didn't once feel uncomfortable and I wouldn't warn anyone away from going there because of it. \n\nI'm primarily an espresso drinker. I rarely enjoy the taste of brewed coffee because it's rarely done well. Trader Joe's cold press is by far the best I've experienced anywhere. \n\nBUT Philz has made a believer out of me. They have a huge selection of different coffees and they do a pour over style, so the coffee is super fresh. Several have light creams and sugars in them, if that's your thing. I had a nutty with hints of caramel coffee with a little soy milk and it was quite tasty (and they didn't charge me extra for soy)! Again, I'm really not a straight up coffee kind of woman, but I would gladly go back to Philz.\n\nThe staff was outrageously friendly and helpful.

Not sure if he skipped out on the sugar entirely and just added creamer? Anyways, I knew that there was no way I could take another sip of it without some sweetener so I ran back in and asked if he could make it a LOT more sweeter- emphasis on the \"LOT.\" After finishing up his other drinks, he gladly obliged and fixed up my drink. I grabbed it, and jolted out the door yet again. Shook it a little, took a sip, and it tasted EXACTLY the same. I'm not sure if he did anything at all or just handed me back my old drink. At this point, I was already a block away and it was pretty much undrinkable so I just tossed it. \n\nThe barista looked really occupied with the rush so I understand how that can be difficult to manage, but I just hope that next time they'll pay more attention to detail :(", "author": "Marny N."}

One area with cafe tables, free wifi and a clean bathroom and another area for coffee and pastry ordering.  We split a Tesora Mocha and thought it was coffee-chocolate deliciousness at it's finest.  We asked for vegan pastries and they pointed to the Big Oat Bar and said \"this is pretty much Vegan\".  Uh, what is \"pretty much Vegan?\".  I read the ingredients and it had nonfat yogurt in it which makes it Non-Vegan.  We bought it anyways to try and was disappointed that it was dry, flavorless and less satisfying than something you buy from Quaker Oats in a box.  \n\nMinus 1 star for the lame pastry and lack of professionalism to dietary restrictions.

They grind it on the spot if requested. Make sure that you tell them what method of coffee brewing you are using because it requires different coffee textures.

I had raved and raved about it to my friend and he said, \"GET OUTTA HERE, PHILZ IS BETTER\" so I decided to take him on his word and came here to study with my BF. One word to describe my experience here: ADDIIICTTIIVEEE!\n\nWithin a span of a couple hours here, I had already ordered two different types of coffee. Man, my first sip into that Mint Mojito was like no other. The mint mojito is a perfect blend of sweet, mint and coffee. Somehow miraculously, all those flavors blend soooo well with each other. If you're in for something stronger and not so much a \"dessert coffee\" person in MY words, go for their \"Philtered Soul\" Definitely a darker blend but still UH-MAZING. I also ended up trying their \"Tesora\" today but will have to say I like the Philtered Soul better although the Tesora definitely does taste darker. \n\nI think the best part about this place is that I've never been to a coffee shop where they create such unique coffee drinks. Most places have you standard fraps, mochas, lattes etc. Here, they add your milk and sugar to your choice of coffee blend and somehow they create a love prodigy baby of amazing coffeeness? Too weird? Sorry.\n\nAnyway, they also have a bagel side bar. We tried their lox and bagel and it was definitely pretty good as well. You can study in the separate room they have across the coffee shop (it's separate) where they have several tables and plenty of outlets. Their internet is free too! It's usually pretty crowded so you should come early. \n\nBest part? I can get a large BOMB-DIGGITY coffee for less than $4. GET OUT OF HERE STARBUCKS. So at the end of the day the question is, \"Is Philz REALLY better than Blue Bottle?\" Yes and no. They're both different in the types of drinks they have and both have their own uniqueness to them. Both are DEFINITELY a MUST TRY if you're in the city.", "author": "Vicki L."}

He recommended the mocha tesora, a.k.a. the house blend, for the BF. It was phenomenal-- the coffee was rich and satisfying, not at all bitter or acidic! I had the ecstatic iced coffee, which was awesome too. I love the touch of mint in both, and the fact that we don't have to add the cream/sugar ourselves. It was simply magic!\n\nI read a poster explaining Philz's commitment to being green-- apparently you can bring in your own mug, at any size, and only be charged for the price of a small coffee. At $3.25, what a steal! So bring your own mugs! The atmosphere was great too-- it was nice and quiet, and easy to find places to sit and relax. I wouldn't have minded spending an afternoon in there, but the SF weather was too beautiful to stay indoors. \n\nBottom line: it was so good that we came back the next day and each bought a cup to-go for our six hour drive back to LA. :)", "author": "Allison S."}

I live in Sunnyvale, and frequent the Cupertino location, which almost always has a line out the door. Nonetheless, the service is friendly and drinks are almost always perfect. \n\nA friend and I decided to pop in this Philz on our walk to Brenda's French Soul Food one Saturday afternoon. This location is split into two parts, one with just tables and seats, and another with the cashier, pastries, counter, and a table and two chairs. I was surprised to see that there wasn't a line, and only 4 or 5 other customers waiting for their drinks. When I walked up to the counter, I almost thought I had walked up to the wrong one because the barista didn't say anything to me. Instead, she just ignored me and started fixing her hair - not that I have anything against that, I don`t want hair in my drinks, but she could have at least acknowledged me, or said that she would be right with me. \n\nAnyhow, after a minute of uncomfortable silence as I waited for her to finish with her hair, I ordered my drink [small Mint Mojito] to the inexplicably grumpy barista, and went to pay at the cashier - who was a bit more friendly. Then I headed to the restroom. After coming out, two people were getting their drinks. Supposedly, they had ordered two large Mint Mojitos, but the barista made one large and one small. During the confusion, I mentioned that I had ordered a small, and while the barista looked at me, they all ignored me. The couple then decided it was okay and left. With what I`m sure was my drink, because I ended up sitting down with my friend afterwards and waiting for another 5-10 minutes, and getting nothing.\n\nFinally, the cashier came over to the counter and realized that we were staring in her direction. She asked if I was waiting for something, so I told her my order, and she made it for me. While the barista I ordered the drink with was off doing nothing. And no one even offered to upgrade it to a large for the trouble, which is what they would have done at Cupertino. The drink itself was okay. But 50% of the cup was crammed with mint leaves, and 25% of the remaining space was ice! It was like they were trying to get rid of all the mint leaves before they went bad or something. I was surprised to see that there was no line, and so few customers - except for the people in the other section who were studying and using WIFI - in an SF location on a Saturday afternoon, but now I`m not surprised.", "author": "Elizabeth H."}

I'm just glad I don't get to frequent Philz, because I'd be broke otherwise. Oh, wait, I'm broke anyway. Oops.\n\nThis location is a bit funky in that you go in and kind of line up to order. I say kind of because it really looks more like a crowd of people in the narrow space between the order/ pick up counter and the cashier counter. Despite the remote semblance of a line, you have to ask people every time, \"Are you in line?\" And after you finally order at the counter, you walk away and wait for your order to be called out. It would be perfectly fine if each barista made one drink at a time. But no... They take a few orders and make drinks in batches. And they don't take down your name, so the mere calling-out of drink names quite puzzles me. It's amazing that people are still willing to \"line up\" for such seeming disorganization. It's amazing that I am still willing to do so, too. Most importantly, it's amazing that Philz somehow makes it work, despite the hundreds of spills that must happen every day because people have to squeeze by each other to get to the counter to pay.\n\nBut it's okay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-25", "description": "I typically come to this Philz after filling my tummy with a large delicious bowl of pho at Them Ky. It is so conveniently located that I often stick around to do my work and use the space as a home office for the rest of the day. In addition to their reliable free wifi, their coffee is the best in the City and their customer service never fails. The place is managed by the relative of Phil Jaber, the founder of Philz, and their list of coffee and pastries is the same as all other locations. The primary difference that makes this particular store unique is the new but smaller and cleaner facility. The caf\u00e9 also attracts the on-the-go professional crowd with which resulted in a more transient store culture than their 24th Street hangout.\n\nThere are three things to like and remember about Philz: Freshness, customization, and personalization. They get new beans once or twice a week and each cup is made to order by hand. They use cardamom and mint leafs as baseline enhancers for taste and presentation, and it is up to the customers to determine how dark, strong, and sweet they want it to be. Personally, I don't buy into their motto of \"one cup at a time\" since I often sit through multiple cups with each visit. For $3.50, a large cup can be had and I'm typically asked to taste it on the spot with offers for a new cup in case it wasn't satisfactory.\n\nTheir staff is highly knowledgeable about every bean in store and the process with which to make a good drip. As for me, I tend to stick to Tesora (medium roast) as the go-to cup and if I need something stronger I would opt for the Arabic or Tantalizing Turkish. Lately I've been enjoying their Either (dark roast) and I typically take it with a splash of vanilla soymilk and three bags of Splenda. I've also tried their Mocha Tesora but thought the chocolate was sweet but not dark enough to keep me intrigued. This is how I like my coffee, strong and dark, since I like the sensation of using my computer with hands that tremble. Somehow that plays a part in easing my stress.\n\nIn all, Philz regardless of the location is a special place that brings it.

But Philz is located on the busy streets of Van Ness Ave. Unless you're in a helicopter with miliitary personnels, there are no sight of endangerment happening in the Bay Area. \"We hope not!\" \n\nBut my emergency-stop did land me at the newest Philz for the \"Code 33\" coffee drink. For $4.00, I get one of the strongest and highly-octane coffee drink the coffee shop has to offer in a small 12 ounce cup. The workers will guarantee that I'll be dancing all night on Halloween. Or in my case, \"dancing dangerously in the air\".\n\nA potent coffee beverage that is most definitely right up my alley, despite my decrease in caffeine-intake within recent months. But unfortunately, my busy Halloween-night for the last 12 years has been a working night. This strong drink absolutely has done its job in keeping me up for a long and busy night.\n\nAll coffees are manually dripped, so you know you'll definitely get a fresh cup of coffee.

I stopped here shortly before meeting one of my friends for lunch on our overnight stay in San Francisco.\n\nPhilz is a small cafe, and I have to admit the setup was a bit different so I was confused as to how things worked at first.  Like typical places you make your order first, but unlike typical places, you don't pay at the same place you order. Instead, that is reserved for a counter that sits across from the coffee bar.  My barista was very helpful on her recommendations and descriptions of the beans and drinks.\n\nAlso a bit confusing, I found that a lot of people were picking up their orders before me, even if I had ordered before they even stepped into the store.  I had to wait past 7 people who ordered after me before I got my drink, but they had pretty much ordered the same thing that I ordered. \n\nBased on reviews, I got the Philtered soul for myself and a Mint mojito for my wife.  She had a headache and I thought that it would be refreshing for her.  I have to admit, I really liked the Mint Mojito much more than the Philtered soul and if I find myself at Philz again, I may just order that.  Additionally, I purchased two bags of whole bean coffee, the Jack and the Tesora.

Tried it at another place down in SD and it was nothing comparable to Philz! My now go-to spot for coffee whenever I'm back in SF. Their Mint Mojito has the perfect texture to it. Nice, smooth, creamy with a minty flavor to it. It does not have a strong minty flavor to it just a hint of it to complete the drink. For around $4.25 for a medium sized cup it's a bit cheaper than Starbucks. My friend who is not fond of coffee went with their Mint Tea and she was amazed at how great it tasted! I believe hers was around $3. I tried it and it was delicious! Great for those non-coffee drinkers! She now goes there to get their mint tea crave fixed! Both the mint mojito iced coffee and the mint tea was very flavorful! Especially recommend it if you like minty things as well but don't expect it to have a strong mint taste to it! \n\nThis location is conveniently located near the City Hall so it was easy to get to! Parking wise, eh. Probably have to park near the Tenderloin, not sure if that's so safe. As for the store it's pretty small compared to their lounge area that is 2x the actual store area. I thought it was kind of weird how you place your order then go pay and not pay after you order. Maybe that's just me. The lounge area is great for those who wants to chill at a coffee place to catch up on their work/study. Free WIFI! Typically only those who are working since it is SO quiet in there!

On the right is where you order your coffee and food, and on the left is where you sit and drink. \n\nFor you (Van Ness) Philz noobs: walk up to a barista and tell them what you would like. I'm usually a black coffee drinker, but at Philz I always get cream and sugar. \nIn the corner is also a bagel station, and I usually get something (any, cause they're all good) while I wait for my coffee.  Walk up to the register and tell them what you ordered. Leave this part of Philz and walk straight across to the other side with tables and couches (through the door). \nLog on to their free wifi or chat with your coffee buddy.\n\nThe lounge-y section usually isn't too crowded in the morning. Most people get their coffee and go, with a handful reading newspaper or killing time.\n\nMint Mojito Iced Coffee or Tesora are my favorites.\nFor you non-coffee drinkers (like I once was), the Mint tea is amazing and my favorite.

It was a complete 180 compared to the other Philz. Instead of a warm homey and rustic feel with dim lighting and old school couches, this place had a sleek look brought on by modern furniture and plenty of lighting. Aside from the hipster music and the laid back look of all the employees, this place definitely fit the downtown feel of the surrounding area.\n\nI liked that there was a second room for people to set up their work or study stations. Even with all that extra seating, it was really crowded when we went. We ended up standing around and then pouncing on a table once it opened up. \n\nFor some reason, I remember the coffee being tastier during my first visit, but I was still satisfied with my beverage.

Truthfully, I was not a fan of either, and I happen to enjoy mint and ginger flavored drinks. To me, the mint mojito tasted like I was drinking coffee after having brushed my teeth and gargling with mouthwash (which is not a good thing). Maybe it was on off night.\n\nToday, Hubby happened to be near a philz coffee and got me an iced mocha tesora. Holy hell this drink was good. I do appreciate that they used real cocoa to make the drink, and that the baristas ask their customers to taste their drink before leaving in case it needs tweaking. \n\nHubby also ordered an iced Jamaican blue mountain, which I thought was nice as well,  but not $120/lb nice. \n\nIf coffee wasn't so damn expensive, I would probably go out of my way more often to get another iced mocha tesora. Otherwise, it's a nice every-once-in-awhile treat.", "author": "Isabel D."}

They also never charge extra for soy instead of dairy milk.  Also, have you seen their standard-issue insulated paper cups?  These fancy yet understated cups keep drinks extra hot or cold.  \n\nAs for drinks, as a mocha lover I find the mocha tesora (with a little cream and sugar)  unparalleled.  The mint mojito iced coffee -- a souped up iced mocha with fresh mint leaves -- is also worthy of all of the hype.  These chocolatey beverages are flavored with cocoa powder, rather than the more commonly-used chocolate syrup.  The difference, though subtle, is noticeable if you prefer your drinks moderately sweet.  \n\nPhilz's version of a chai latte is also uniquely made with chai brewed from tea bags, not processed chai-flavored syrup, which gives it a rare freshness and spiciness.  \n\nThe only drawback about this Philz location is the lack of convenient parking.", "author": "Chris T."}

I walked here from my hotel in Marina/Cow Hollow (a 5 mile round-trip) as I'd read that the coffee is great. I ordered an Aztec Mocha (coffee with Bittersweet Cocoa Powder) and asked them to add a little almond milk. The coffee was awesome. Like, \"mmm\" inducing awesome every single sip. It was a little cooler than I prefer but I consider myself a newbie and had I known the almond milk would cool the coffee so much I would have ordered it \"extra hot\". Well, now I know. I really hope I get to return to Philz someday. The Mint Mojito Coffee looks amazing as well. My husband also got the Aztec Mocha no milk and really enjoyed it. We agreed there's definitely some sugar in the cocoa powder as the drink was moderately sweet.", "author": "Amanda Z."}

When I go to Starbucks and I order a coffee, it should taste like the same coffee I ordered 5 months ago at a Starbucks 3,000 miles away. So tell me why I ordered mint mojito iced coffees from this same location in the same week (made by 2 different baristas) and they tasted so different? \n\nThe guy barista makes it exactly how I like it. Strong coffee flavor, sweet and he crushes the mint so that the whole drink has the minty flavor incorporated into every sip. Now they have this chick back there, who made it and it tasted like watery garbage. Not sweet at all, minty to the point of herbal medicine, and watery to boot. I asked her to remake my drink since it didn't taste right and although she was sweet about it, the second time was just as bad! I wanted to say, \"Excuse me, can you get your other coworker to make it? Because whenever you make it, it tastes like I paid $5 for a cup of brown herbal water.\" \n\nWorst part was that I was bragging about how good their mint mojito iced coffees were and my two friends with me were definitely not impressed.

Ordered an Istanbul Cream Tea with Mint Leaves! Their menu was quite extensive & their coffee's looked really lovely. I'd like to try them sometime. What I liked about Philz Coffee was how happy every customer seemed with their Drinks. Everyone seemed pleasantly surprised and left with a bit of spark in their eye which a nice change of pace from the likes of Starbucks & Peet's. Philz seems more like a place you want to have coffee and sit down with someone and have a nice conversation or read a book or do some writing. It feels more about taking time out to enjoy every sip and not rush in and out. Their pastries are self serve and in a case of their own which was great too! I love that they have fresh mints and herbs and ingredients and I can't wait to try more beverages from their menu!", "author": "Julian I."}

Fact uncontested. \n\nAlways get your coffee with a little bit of cream (and sugar). They use manufacturing cream, which has a high fat content and makes the coffee delightfully buttery. \n\nMy absolute favorite is the mocha tesora. Imagine a hot fudge-brownie sundae in liquid form. If you have a low tolerance for sugar, ask the barista to use less cocoa powder. If you like mint-flavored anything, definitely try the Mint Mojito iced coffee. They overload it with ice cubes so you want to ask for easy ice.\n\nAlmost everything I have had here has been amazing, with the exception of Anesthesia.

I would just look at my iPhone.\n  \nYesterday Anna wanted to get up at 6:30 so she had time for a shower before school. I usually set the alarm in my iPhone.

I set the alarm in my iPad and put it next to my iBed. iSlept.\n\nI awoke with the clock flashing 6:00 AM. It was dark outside and the deep rumble of the foghorn made my bones vibrate. I went to the kitchen. I made a pot of strong coffee - I was drinking something menacingly deep from Philz's called \"Ether\" - and drank a cup. I read the morning news on my iPad.\n\nAt 6:30 I went up and tried to wake Anna but she begged for another 15 minutes. I went back to the kitchen. I had another cup of Ether. At 6:45 I started back upstairs. Odd that it was so dark. The foghorn was still moaning so we must be really socked in today. I got to Anna's room and sat on the edge of her bed. She hadn't moved - Wow, she was really sleeping hard. I hated to wake her. I put my hand on her shoulder and gave her a shake. But then I noticed her clock - it said 3:45. \n\nI went back to the other room and grabbed my iPad. It said 6:45. I went upstairs and found my iPhone, now fully charged. It agreed with Anna's clock.

There is no coffee place in California or otherwise that is quite as good. That includes Blue Bottle.\n\nI would replace every bodily fluid I have with this coffee if I could. I'd crack open my eyeballs, drain the aqueous and vitreous humors, and pour Tesora in if meant I could see in some cool \"coffee vision.\"\n\nPhilz could easily be the douchiest coffee bar on the planet. I was scared that I would be met with a smug hippie attitude when I first came. The worker was wearing a freaking afghan and had facial hair that screamed \"bongo lover.\" Suddenly I felt very metropolitan and out of place. I didn't know how to order their coffee, was I to be mocked? SF can create dens of smuggery at times, and I feared I had entered one.\n\nBut everyone here, hippie or otherwise is nice as can be. They don't judge, they know that flavor is subjective and everyone has their preferences. Reading up on the philosophy of the place really shows that they are PROUD of everything they serve, so whatever you order is fine by them.\n\nDo you want lots of cream and lots of sugar? No problem. My lady orders it like that all the time and they've never raised an eyebrow. In fact just about every order is met the same way. \"No problem, coming right up.\" Or maybe, \"Right on bro.\"\n\nOh right, so the coffee. It's fantastic. Every blend is unique and you should experiment to find your favorite. The flavors in these coffee will show you what coffee is capable of if you were like me and had only frequented a Starbucks prior to this. My favorite is Anesthesia To the Upside. I have NO clue where they get these names from ...\n\nThey actually have recently added a bagel bar in the corner and it's REALLY good. I like the Mediterranean bagel the best.

Although I think VERY highly of Nespresso coffee and would prefer Nespresso, (even though I've only had one taste of it in the downtown location in SF), Philz coffee is BY FAR the best tasty retail/chain coffee ever that doesn't go sour in two seconds.

I was told it was a medium roast coffee with a smooth, yet strong finish.  It was definitely a medium roast.  It smelled wonderful, but was a little too light-bodied for me.  You must tell the barista how you like your coffee (sugar?  milk?) and they will add everything for you.  I found it difficult to get everything \"just right\" for myself, as they were so busy that I felt I was being a nuisance to keep asking for my drink to be adjusted.\n\nFor our non-coffee drinker we ordered a mint hot tea.  They actually put real fresh mint in the tea!\n\nI didn't have it, but my friend loves their mocha and the grasshopper coffee beverages.  \n\nLoved the fresh bagel stand at the side of the coffee bar/counter, but they didn't have anything we wanted to eat.  We tried their potato samosa, which they kindly toasted up for us.  It was a bit greasy for my taste, but very flavorful.\n\nWish we could fix our coffees the way we wanted, but the coffees themselves were pretty good.

All in my very first encounter and sip of the MINT MOJITO ICED COFFFFAAAY! \n\nI can still remember this very day. It was a warm day. Perhaps 70 degrees where the sun was shining as if it were singing and radiating beams of rays in the air as it anticipated my first encounter with Philz. Having heard so much about this coffee shop, I was enthralled by this so called \"Philz,\" that seemed to sound too cool for itself. Leap leap leap, I happily skipped into the store and behold! A fresh, breathtaking whiff of air that screamed of angels that were high on coffee caught my sinuses. Whoa. That was Whoa like Usher would say. \n\nAs I curiously approached the counter, not sure what to order due to my asymmetrical tastes that are opposite of a hardcore coffee addict. I prefer the taste of sweeter and creamier coffee that still carries the aroma of the freshly ground coffee beans, but is not equivalent of a 40% milk, 40% sugar and 20% coffee concoction. I still want to feel and pretend to be somewhat like a suave and sophisticated coffee go-er ya know... \n\nThe barista kindly suggests that I try the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee. In my head I'm thinking \"mint in coffee? Pish posh- you must be loco.\" \n\nOf course, having seen a customer that just received their freshly brewed mint mojito iced coffee who drank with such glee and delight, I had no choice. I opted for the seemingly pretentious and unusual beverage. \n\nHOLY MOLY. I drank the coffee as if it were melted Godiva dark chocolate. Chilled ice coffee that was a perfect blend of cream, coffee and sugar, mixed in with the mint that surprisingly complimented the sweetness of the sugar perfectly (this taste & sensation can be comparable to a lighter version of mint chocolate chip ice cream) to the point where I was smiling bigger than my already big mouth and smile could accommodate. My only disappointment was that I wished I had ordered the largest size they carried since I later found myself jamming my straw in between the cubes of ice at the end struggling and trying to suck every last droplet of happiness. \n\nI love you MMIC.

So I waited.\n\nWhen my coffee was served, the barrista told me to take a sip.  I did.  \nThen I lied.  \nI said, \"Mmm...nice.\"  \nIt wasn't nice.  It tasted like a very watered down cross between a more robust Tim Hortons and a Fair Trade McDonalds.  Now, what got me was that Tesoro is supposed to be their intro to the world of Philz Coffee; this is the brew that is supposed to lure you in to a quality cup.  Who exactly is their target audience?  Even someone who lived under a rock next to Starbucks would find this underwhelming.\n\nMy sidekick had the Turkish and she liked it, so that's a plus.  They were also playing Queen's Flash Gordon which deserves 5 stars in and of itself, yet upon further thought, perhaps it was a sign.  \"Just a man, with a man's courage.

I didn't ask for any special requests (sugar or cream or what not) and they didn't ask. Normal? However my friend also got a mocha with like half the sugar and 30% cream or something customized like that. But when it came time to pick up our orders, we asked which is which and the girl making the drinks replied very nonchalantly (ie like she could care less) that they were the same. I highly doubt they were the same because I bet she forgot my friends special requests and just made it normally. That kind of irked me. But we were like whatever and just paid.

My expression wasn't because the coffee tasted bad, but because I was in shock of how good it tasted!!!\n\nBarista was extra nice as well.  he made sure I liked my cup of coffee before I left.  When we did leave, although he was extremely busy, he stopped what he was doing to say bye to us.

I like quality coffee, and I also like to have control over how much sugar is in it and what kind of sugar and what kind of non-dairy cream, etc, so I often feel it's easier to just make the damn drink myself at home to accomplish the flavor I want, than to be that one pain in the ass customer in line.  But Philz service is so top notch, they ENCOURAGE you to specify any request you may have.  In any other coffee shop, you might feel rude saying, \"I'd like a small coffee, lightly sweet, half stevia with a pinch of sugar and 1/3 vanilla almond milk with two fresh mint leaves please.\"  But at Philz they'll make your irritatingly specific beverage wishes come true without judgment AND ask you to taste it before you buy, just in case your delicate little tastebuds have any more requests they can fulfill for you!  They'll make you feel actually good about your food allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, or discriminating taste.  And when you taste it, you'll feel you got your money's worth.

I ended up ordering the mint mojito (asked for less suger and it came out perfect). My drink also came with some fresh mint on top. So yummy and refreshing! \n\nIf I was a student...I would come here to study. The coffee shop has a whole different room across the actual shop for studying.

The first thing that occurred upon entering Philz was the aroma. Split into two, Philz has a dedicated area for coffee and even a mini stand for bagels; the other area is for their tables. Our barista, even though busy, was still very helpful for us newbies. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a large Tesora and I tried a large Tantalizing Turkish. I never fully appreciated coffee until I came here. With just a touch of cream to both cups, I was instantly awaken to what coffee should taste like. Their Tantalizing Turkish was bold but that smell of Turkish coffee was affirmative and it was very different to have it in such a large portion. Their Tesora lived up to its description and was a great beginner Philz drink for anyone new to their franchise. Plus with the extra dose of hyper-activeness I experienced afterwards, I was quite pleased with our curiosity of trying out their coffee.", "author": "Jamie L."}

It's super smooth, creamy, and has a nice lingering coffee flavor. It's not too bitter, too acidic, or too sweet & sugary.\n\nI've had some great coffee in San Diego, New York, and here in San Francisco. While all these great flavors have been good in a different way, the most important thing to me has been a coffee shop's consistency and their attention to detail.\n\nOther things that are important IMO about a good coffee shop: How well thought out is each individual drink served, how knowledgeable is the staff behind the counter, how is their coffee when it finally hits your palette? Does it take a while for you to like it? Or is it perfect from the first sip?\n\nPhilz is perfect from the first sip to the last. Hot, iced, or black, the coffee is a super smooth elixir. If you get it black, they aerate your drink to make sure it's slightly cooled down and also not as acidic on the tongue. If you get it with milk, they make sure to add the perfect amount to your blend. If you get it iced, they serve it from a special cold brew they have on the side. If you ask them about your coffee, they'll make sure they give you a good talking to... just to make sure you know what you're getting into.\n\nI'm not from SF or even visit that often.

She always went to the nicest little cafes and bought the best beans to make at home; she didn't use drip, only french press.\n\nLet me tell you, if you have been to a lot of coffee shops and been disappointed, I don't think you will be at Philz. This is not a place for European coffee-drink snobs; they do not have mochas, \"non-fat-latte\" this or any of that other crap you might find in a Starbucks or Seattles Best. No, this is a true coffee shop. True to the name at least.\n\nPhilz has over 40 different types of coffee I believe (for those who don't drink coffee regularly, that means they are sourced, grown and roasted differently; ALL OF THEM. If you like wine, you know what I'm talking about) and most of them are excellent. They literally have something for everyone here, so don't dismiss this place just because you can't get a cappuccino (you can, but I wouldn't recommend it). Get a nice cup of traditionally brewed \"cafe\" as they would say in \"San Francisco\"; San Francisco is a spanish town, with spanish roots. People get serious about their coffee here!\n\nIf you've ever been to Seattle, then Philz probably won't be that blow-your-mind coffee shop. But considering most coffee in San Francisco (and the bay area in general) sucks, Philz is a refreshing departure from the trend.", "author": "Angel M."}

I felt bad that we took up 3 tables and stayed so long, but the workers were not bothered at all by us staying for so long. I had no idea what to order and told the guy behind the bar that I'd like something bold and milky.  He nodded and whipped up a Jacobs Wonderbar and it was AMAZING! It had a very distinct taste but felt incredibly smooth and rich going down. I like how they hand you a cup and make absolute certain that you like the drink, and that they would remake your drink if you weren't satisfied.\n\nAfter a couple hours, I decided to try another cup and got the Ambrosia and it was equally delicious and COMPLETELY different from my first drink! It was very rich and delicious as well. My friends got all different drinks and I loved them ALL! A Mint Mojito Coffee.... what??? It was amazing. Great job on the creativity and imagination department, Mr. Philz!\n\nOn my 4th or 5th hour there at the coffee shop, a worker signaled me to come over to him. I thought I was in trouble for being too loud or for staying too long, but he just poured some coffee into a few cups and asked us to try it out. So nice!!! The vibe is hipster-ish, but not annoying hipster-ish, if you know what I mean. They're very down to earth and chill.\n\nI bought a bag of Anesthesia to the Upside and it was fantastic for a french press.

I decided to wait until I found something to write about because I felt my first two visits left something to be desired. I talked to my good friend Mark about Philz, Mark is a fan, he said if I wasn't happy with my coffee perhaps I hadn't found the right coffee. I usually order a double espresso but Philz makes drip coffee only. I found the coffee at Philz to taste almost like hot water, didn't have any body or flavor to it at all. Mark suggested I try their Turkish coffee, wow, what a difference that made, nice a strong, felt like I was drinking something other than hot water and there's a spice in Philz brew that I think was cardomon, it certainly enhanced my drink without overwhelming it.\n\nThe staff are always nice and friendly and want to make sure they get your drink order to your liking and for $3.75 for a large coffe that's a good thing!\n\n Would I go back again? Absolutely now that I found a drink that I like!\n\nSaturday, 3/24/12\nRainy day, Philz is doing a good business, the other room where you eat, use the free wifi is packed.

Since I have not had brekkie and it is going on 430p I ordered one of their burrito's, the Black Bean Breakfast Burrito. They are made in Sonoma, kept in a fridge (always a good sign) and reheated in the micro. Made with Flour Tortilla, potatoes, eggs, black beans, jack and chedder and seasonings.

I'm disappointed in myself. Why did I not give Philz a chance until just now? Because I'm an idiot.\n\nMy friend was driving me to the airport the other day, and before we left she told me I HAD to try Philz Coffee. She's been talking about it for a while now. Now I know why.\n\nI walk in around 9:45am on a Saturday, and the place is packed with happy people. The line was decent, but literally 2 minutes after I walked in, the line was out the door. I had no idea what I wanted to order, all I knew was I was getting a large (I went out the night before, I needed to wake up). I wanted something light, and smooth, with no yucky coffee aftertaste. I asked the baristo (I don't know, can I call I guy barista that?) what his favorite light coffee blend was. He recommended the \"Soooo Good\" (I'm a little unsure as to how many o's there actually were in the word \"so\". Please note that this is just an estimate). I got cream and sugar as well.\n\nIt took a little while to get my coffee as it was so slammed. I loved the way they had all the beans in different containers behind them, all labeled with their fun coffee names. Each barista/baristo had 4 coffee filtering cups in front as to make 4 orders at a time. It was such a fun thing to watch, maybe because I'm easily amused, or maybe it's just actually that cool to watch people make my coffee.\n\nI paid my $3.50 for a large, took a nice large sip (PERFECT temp), and exhaled a sigh of contentment. I also exhaled my want for Starbucks ever again.\n\nAs a side note, I heard a TON of people ordering \"the Jacobs.\" It must be their most popular blend. I might have to get a cup of that during my next Philz trip, which probably would have been right now, but I'm in North Carolina this week (hence the airport trip mentioned earlier). \n\nPhil, you're my new boyfriend.

I'd never been to the Van Ness location before (I frequent the Berkeley one way more often to get work done) and was a bit confused about the set-up. There are two different entrances within the same building--the one on the right is where you order/pick-up and the one on the left is the seating area shared with a sandwich shop.\n\nFortunately, there was one empty table right next to an outlet that I was able to snag. I dropped my stuff off and went to order. There was only one person ahead of me and the barista was really helpful and friendly in terms of answering my questions and telling me what was in it. I then looked to see what pastries they had to offer and didn't see any vegan ones other than the ABC cookies that seem to be the vegan option at every vegan-friendly cafe in the universe. I passed. After ordering and paying, I waited only thirty seconds for my drink and the barista apologized for the wait. I was surprised because I thought it was very fast and told her so. She didn't ask me what I thought of my drink (as is customary with the other Philz), but I told her I enjoyed it anyway. It basically tasted like what autumn would taste like and figured that's why my friend recommended it--he knows how much I love pumpkin flavors.\n\nIf you're able to find a table, this is a great place to work for a couple hours or so. Everyone's busy doing their own thing and it's not too loud of an environment that you can't listen to music on your headphones.\n\nMy only complaint is how long it's taken for any employee to realize the compost/recycle bins are overflowing.

It's unique, flavorful, creative, and really sets itself apart from all the other places.\n\nFirst off, this place has over 30 different roasts to choose from. The best part is that they have very detailed descriptions of each roast and the drinks that are made, so that you can find the best drink suited to your own taste buds (this is especially important to me even though it's a pretty small detail, and I must have spent a good 5-10 minutes reading the descriptions to pick out what I liked)\n\nThe other thing that really caught my attention is the level of detail and care they put into their drinks. This isn't your typical coffee joint - each barista custom makes each drink, filtering a fresh batch of finely ground roast. I was pretty impressed; even as the barista that was taking my order was making several drinks, he still took the time to talk about various roasts with me.\n\nEnded up trying the mint mojito iced coffee; the honest truth? It wasn't my favorite thing. I'm used to drinking coffee black, no sugar and cream, and I'll admit that it was a definite step in the other direction and the drink wasn't exactly for me. What I will say was that it was very flavorful and creamy, with a nice hint of mint that you could definitely taste, but not overbearing (I'm here for the coffee really, so I'm glad that it wasn't super strong)\n\nEven though the drink I ordered didn't suit my tastes, I am absolutely certain that with the amount of knowledge and care taken for each drink, that there is something on the menu for me, and I am certain that drink is going to be pretty much perfect.

I call up Philz to have someone give me a better verbal description of what it is/how it was roasted, etc to see if I could find something comparable out here and the guy who answers the phone, frustratingly reminds me of the Hispanic house keeper on Family Guy... OMG! I tried being really patient, speaking slowly and clearly, but... It was getting to the point where I needed to politely thank him and gracefully say good bye or I was seriously going to end up snapping ....aaannd, I don't like to do that. He probably thought he spoke really good English.", "author": "Tanis G."}

I took 2 sips of their iced mint mojito and was already addicted!\n\n After hearing people raving about how good Philz coffees are I had to try it for myself. There isn't a lot of locations in the city so for me to get to one is rather challenging. Since I work in downtown and the nearest Philz is still rather far away. I finally took advantage of my day off and made a drive to their Van Ness location.  Parking was super easy on a weekday afternoon and the line wasn't bad. \n\nI of course, ordered the iced mint mojito =) the 1st sip was definitely very minty and it was something I wasn't used to in my coffee.  But the 2nd was what made me fall madly in love with this drink! The coffee is rich and creamy, the mint flavor leaves a cooling and waking feeling in my mouth and it's super refreshing. \n\nI wish they will open up a location in the heart of downtown! Until then, I cant wait to meet with Philz and their addicting iced mini mojito coffee.", "author": "Jenny G."}

I don't know a thing about Philz, but before we could even order the lady behind the counter simply declared \"One Iced Coffee\", and I'm so happy she did because it was insanely memorable and overwhelmingly satisfactory.\n\nI haven't read any of the reviews on Philz yet because I want to make sure others agree before I start thinking that I was just on the verge of too-drunk, if such a thing even exists.

I'm ashamed to say, I would often confuse them with a chain like Java City. I'll wait a bit. After more insisting, I finally decided to go check it out with Tina T as we were in the area. I may have just came across one of the best specialty coffee places in my life. I'm swooned, Philz. I am swooned and you have opened my floodgates to a new addiction: your mint mojito iced coffee. \n\nWho thought of this? Ingenious! When I usually drink specialty coffees, I get this heavy bloated feeling in what I thought was lactose intolerance (if I am, I'm in denial). The mint mojito iced coffee is sweet but it was sooo light and refreshing!

Reviewers called it a life-changing experience and I rolled my eyes....then I went there and had a cup and told everyone and their mom, \"Oh my GOD, this coffee changed my life!\" Believe the hype. Believe in the power of mint leaves.\n\nSo I work graveyard shifts for a news wire at Market and Polk several days a week, and I decided that since it's logistically closer to my work I would make the Van Ness Philz my new guilty pleasure stop. And as much as I love the Castro, this location puts that one to shame. Well, as ashamed as a place as awesome as Philz can be.\n\nThis location (I'm here right now) is so clean, you seriously forget that you're a half block from the heart of the TL. The bathroom is super big and clean, and I always appreciate places that can even make a pee a pleasant experience. There's plenty of seating (tables and couches), and, obviously, FREE WI-FI!\n\nBut that's not what makes this Philz more than the best Philz, but one of the best singular coffee shops in the entire city. It's the people who work here. I swear these are the most happy, light-hearted little joy spreaders I've ever met. They greet everyone with the biggest, most sincere smile and really care about making you a drink you'll really enjoy; they're not pushing an agenda with no regard to whether you like it or not. They'll make your coffee extra sweet and creamy or totally black, just like you like it. And they'll remember you when you come back.\n\nI came in here one morning around 7:30 a.m. after a long, grueling overnight shift. To paint a picture for you, let it be known that phrases like \"I honestly hope someone tries to start a fight with me on the street after my night shift just so I have an outlet for the aggression it causes\" get thrown around by my colleagues, so when I dragged my tired self into Philz that morning I wasn't exactly chipper. But the brew master behind the bar was so full of smiles and energy that by the time we had decided on the coffee I was going to try that day (I like to mix it up) I was already at least three times as energetic as when I walked in. Then he clapped his hands and said, \"Alright! Let's bring you back!\" And he did: as I walked out with that treasured brown cup in my hands I was smiling from ear to ear and practically skipping down the street.\n\nBig kahuna bonus life points to the VN Philz folks on this one: if you drive here and park your car out front, they make announcements warning people with cars when meter maids are rolling through to help you avoid those dreaded love notes on your windshield!

Philz started in the Mission District in 2003 and they are famous for their Mint Mojito Iced Coffee. Trust me it exceeds all the hype! The iced coffee itself is creamy, but not too sweet, while the mint provides a very refreshing flavor. Also, you can barely taste the coffee's bitterness as you gulp it down. The service here is very friendly and efficient. Walk in, order your drink, and pay for it in a separate line off to the right. I haven't had a chance to try anything else here, except the Tesora blend coffee. The Tesora fit my ideal characteristics in a cup of coffee (full-bodied and smooth), but didn't really stand out in any way; maybe I'm just too partial to my Peet's Sumatra and Arabian Mocha Java beans. As a bonus, all Philz locations have free Wi-Fi and there are plenty of tables next door for catching up or studying. Just keep in mind it may get pretty loud for a coffee shop, especially in the afternoons, so bring some headphones if you don't want distractions.

First, I have been grinding beans and making espresso at home for longer than the staff at van ness have been alive. I've grown in appreciation of good coffee from my first experience with Peet's French roast at cedar store when I was in grad school over 30 years ago.  And have passed through a few boutique coffees before finding blue bottle and most recently Philz.  And Philz \"It's the Best\" will remain our bean of choice for home espresso.\n\nBUT.... This past Sunday We had stayed in sf for a one night staycation and wanted a morning latte.... Used yelp to find Philz and just assumed they made lattes...seeing espresso on the chalk board.  So I ordered one for me and one for my wife.  I was excited as I'd never had a latte at philz, just bought beans for home use.  I was only half paying attention but I saw the Barista pour brewed coffee through the grounds... Never had seen that... Didn't even occur to me that this was a Philz espresso.  So I said I'd never seen that before.  When she said 'that's your latte,' I was stunned.   When I registered confusion she acted like I was some kind of coffee neanderthal, clueless about the nuances of philzdom... I objected and said that when I ordered a latte she should have said that they dont make lattes or they make 'turkish' lattes....(which is also a misnomer as Turkish coffee is not twice brewed but who is counting...). Bottom line pouring coffee through grounds twice doesn't create espresso, it creates Luke warm coffee.  I would have been ok with all of this, but Barista was so unapologetic and rude that I decided to brave the wave of 5's on yelp and offer a countering view.\n\nHaving said all this, we will continue to get Philz it's the best beans, cuz they are the best,", "author": "Paul G."}

After seeing multiple photos of their mint mojito iced coffee all over my Facebook newsfeed, I decided to try it for myself.\n\nAfter finishing a meal at Turtle Tower, we had about 24 minutes left on the meter, so we decided to walk around the corner for some coffee and be back at our car with time to spare. Once I walked into Philz, it was pretty empty, and I was excited to get to try my first mint mojito iced coffee. I placed my order promptly with a woman near the espresso machine, and was told that I would pay after getting my drink. Fair enough, I thought. About a minute later, 3 people walked in. Then 2 more. All of them ordered some kind of hot drink, and 10 minutes later, I was curious as to where my drink was. 3 of the people that came in after me already got their drinks - and I thought OKAY, maybe this iced coffee concoction takes some sort of special prep... I've worked at a coffee shop before, and I KNOW that hot drinks take longer to make than iced drinks just because of the extra step of having to steam the milk. It still seemed a little ridiculous of a wait to me, considering that I was there before any of the other patrons, and the fact that I ordered a cold drink. Five more minutes pass by, and at this point, I am STARING DOWN THE BARISTA because this was such a ridiculous wait for coffee! If I knew it would take so long, I wouldn't have come. FINALLY, she calls out \"MINT MOJITO ICED COFFEE\" and puts two on the counter. One was mine, and the other belonged to a customer that was there for probably about 2 minutes. WHAT THE HELL. I angrily paid at the register and rushed back to the car, hoping that the meter didn't expire. \n\nFirstly, my coffee was not presented in the way that all the pictures of the mint mojitos were depicted. Mine just looked like regular coffee.\nSecondly, the drink was INCREDIBLY watered down. I've had my fair share of different coffees, but this drink was similar to a McDonald's iced coffee (think a crap ton of milk and little to no espresso). While I enjoyed the minty cool flavor of the drink, this was in no way worth the wait or the ~$4. \n\nI am hoping that the Berkeley location of Philz won't disappoint, but the kind of customer service and lack of quality control here was unacceptable.", "author": "Janice W."}

I visited it in the morning, and closing, and both times the employees (same people) were extremely friendly. There was no rush for me to pay, and the coffee came out extremely fast.

Philz prepares their drip coffee individually to order (I LOVE that trend here!) and has many options to choose from. I've sampled the two that they recommended first when I asked for a dark roast: \"Jacob's Wonderbar\" and \"Tantalizing Turkish.\" They were both excellent, but I preferred the latter.\n\nThe Turkish blend includes a subtle hint of cardamom, and all of their coffees offer an optional mint leaf. Now, I've steered clear of flavored coffees ever since I graduated from french vanilla \"coffee\" at Dunkin Donuts to real black coffee about two weeks after I started drinking the stuff, but the cardamom and mint are subtle enough to be a nice touch. The mint adds a freshness that you don't get with pure black coffee. \n\nAnyway, if you appreciate great coffee, flip a coin. Heads is Philz, tails is Blue Bottle.

I also think Peet's across the street serves up a great cup of coffee at probably about 65% of the price.  \n\nThe taste was quite good -- but I could see this as being an expensive habit if enjoyed daily!  \n\nAll in all a great cup of coffee -- definitely original and worth checking out if you're in San Fran.", "author": "John O."}

The folks that brew your brew are friendly and will help you pick from among the many roasts.  \n\nIt's a bit pricey, but there must be more overhead if you brewing each cup indvidually.  It's worth it!  If you want an inexpensive cup, brew it at home.  The mint mojito is truly magic.", "author": "Kat M."}

They grind and brew one cup at a time, and they prepare it to your liking (cream, sugar etc) instead of leaving it up to you.  At first this seemed odd, like I would have to keep giving it back to them to get it right, but they know what they're doing and can easily accommodate your preferences.\n\nSo far my favorites are the Turkish and Julie's Ultimate, both dark roasts.  I've had some of the pastries too, which are decent.  The plain croissant was great, the mini cupcakes were ok, and the scone I had was pretty good.\n\nThe only downside really is the price.  I think the cheapest cup is $2.75, and they go up to I think $3.25 for a small.  The price is fair when you consider the quality, but it keeps this from being an everyday kind of place for me.

She's not a coffee drinker, but I am an avid coffee drinker so I knew I would have to procure coffee by myself.  I used to live in SF, so I knew that I could go to Peet's down the block from her.  However, lo and behold, there was a new coffee shop that was much closer!\n\nI stopped by and it happened to be their first day open.  It was quiet so I was able to chat with the owner Phil for a while.  I was surprised to learn that they had several coffee shops and they were rated best coffee for 5 years in a row in SF.  How is it that I did not know about this coffee?\n\nSince it was slow, I got to taste several different blends.  I love the unique way that they make their coffee.  They grind the beans then put it in a coffee filter hanging over a carafe and pour the hot water onto the coffee.  What comes out on the other side into the carafe is pure coffee heaven!\n\nThe drinks are based on light,medium, or dark roasts and there are descriptions of what it tastes like (kind of like wine descriptions, but for coffee).  I tried several medium and dark roasts and really liked their coffee.\n\nI visited the cafe every day and progressed to the turkish delight, a very strong brew that was delicious!  I fell in love with the coffee (and a little bit with the personable owner) and on my return to Philadelphia, I took 2lbs of beans with me.  I will have to have them ship beans to me when I'm out.\n\nI've tried Blue Bottle and Ritual and thought they were OK, I LOVE philz!", "author": "Jean C."}

I moved over a bit, and was starting to look at what their pastry offerings were.  Guy 2, the one I didn't care for, asked if I needed help.  I told him his friend helped us, but I think I am going to order something from the case.  He proceeds to tell me that they are all about the coffee, and the items in the case come second.  Great, well my coffee is ordered, now I am ready for something from the case.  Crappy guy says, ....we like to focus on the coffee.  Great.  He stands there doing nothing for 2 more minutes, and then asks me if he can get me something from the case.  Uhggg.  \n\nHe seemed to act this way to most patrons.

My husband, who picked up the drinks for me, said it wasn't even ready when he go there. My order was set to be done at 405. He got there at about 415. Now, I find I'm forcing myself to drink it because its $4, but I mean, why this sudden decline in quality?! I just had one from the 24th x douglass location on Sunday! Tasting exactly as it should. Pitty. Looks like I'm going to have to start waking up even earlier and going to the 24x Folsom location before work. Too bad they don't use order ahead... Sorry Van Ness team, I really was starting to love you.", "author": "Kelly Marie C."}

The employees there are stuck-up and not very helpful. \n\nWhen my husband and I walked in (mind you, we have never been there before) we stayed near the door to let others order before us. The first thing the girl says at the register does is laugh at us and says, \"come on in, don't be scared.\" Ummm, we're not. We're being considerate to other customers and letting them go in line while we figure out what we want. So my husband says, \"we've actually never been here before, so what would you recommend?\" The girl responds by shrugging her shoulders and pointing to the menu. Really????????? That's service? Wow. \n\nWe ended up ordering something that we had seen pop up on several Yelp reviews. The barista asks us, \"do you want it perfect?\" So we ask, \"what's perfect?\" Again, he shrugs his shoulders and says, \"uhhhhhh, perfect?!?!?!\" Ok, seriously? What kind of service is that? If you expect to attract new customers and retain them, quit it with the attitude. \n\nI definitely won't be going back to this location.

While you wait in line, decide what type of coffee you are in the mood for today.They have an astonishingly eclectic assortment of very interesting beans that they will brew just for you. You tell them your hearts desire and they brew your choice, one cup at a time. \n\nI'm coming to realize as I write reviews of the coffee shops that I have frequented, that what I like is more than great coffee. i make great coffee at home. But I am willing to drive across the city and pay top dollar for a cup of coffee or a latte, for a moment in the day where someone is catering to me.  It's about having a moment in the day where someone who can make a cup of coffee as good as I can, is able to  take care of me for a moment. And maybe even offer me a variation, that delights the senses for a moment, but without the attitude that they are going to impose their taste profile on me. There are a lot of different cups of coffee out there. And a lot of Baristas who don't want to create a perfect moment for me or you.  At Philiz you can find a cup that's perfect for you, and a barista that is happy to style you out with a perfect moment of service. \n\n(I feel like I should be apologetic for this \"me\" attitude, but when it comes to coffee, its sort of about that- if I want black coffee or weak milky coffee or whatever, its really about someone indulging my desires that makes the experience worth the time and money.)", "author": "Kari J."}

You can't see the menu that describes each blend until you are at the counter needing to order. So you don't have time to read thru all the descriptions without being rushed into a decision because of the long line behind you. The menu that describes each blend needs to be visible a lot sooner in the process as there are lots of blends to choose from. I went with the Philharmonic because I like word games and I heard it being called out a few times so thought it must be popular for a reason. It is sooooooooooo sooooo good (not to be confused with the light roast blend they have called sooo soooo good). Honestly, I felt the need to call people right away and tell them how good this coffee is. That's how good it is.\nThe turkey sausage and egg breakfast sandwich on the other hand - just meh. \nAlso, I paid by debit and they don't have you sign anything, which is a nice convenience but I couldn't tip.

However, the process of getting the coffee was very byzantine--bordering on hipster douchery.  First time at Philz, and a friend and I are waiting in a long line going out the door.  Eventually, we caught sight of the menu...however, there are only metaphorical coffee names and prices...nothing indicating *what* was being served. Confused, and approaching the first coffee jockey, I blurt out one of the dark blends.  Next, I go to pay, and wait for my coffee.  When they eventually call it out, I look around for cream and sugar.  Nope.  Not available.  Where is it?  You were supposed to tell the coffee jockey that.  What?  I have to \"describe\" how sweet and creamy I want my coffee before I've even tasted it?  Yes.  Let's make this process as full of douchebaggery as possible.  If you don't let us put in our own ideas of cream and sugar, you just might ruin the drink that you bought for yourself to drink.  WTF?  Get a grip.  You shouldn't have to guess how to order coffee, nor should you be treated like you are incapable of determining the proper amount of cream and sugar in your own coffee.

Saw the HUGE list of coffees available, but never tried it, because (a) gimme a break (b) why pay more (c) never felt guilty enough.  \nWell, one day I had to sit for a bit longer, and I figured it was finally time to contribute to the business, so I figured sure. . .I'll buy a cup of overpriced, you're-taking-yourself-WAY-too-seriously coffee.  I walk up to the counter, ponder the selection, and decide to be safe & order a mocha.\nUh-oh.\nThe immediate barrage of questions was simultaneously amusing and annoying (Do you like acidic or smooth?  Full?  Dark?  Cream? How sweet?  Lebron James, or Kobe?)  Now, I'm FULLY convinced that these folks take their coffee *way* too seriously.  I heave a huge sigh, and just say: \"Gimme a normal, everyday, the way you always make it mocha, Please?\" \nThe barrista (does that apply to male and female?  Gotta check) smiles, relentlessly cheerful, and nods, and goes into his routine. . .I mean, picture Tom Cruise in \"Cocktail\", only in a caf\u00e9.  It's still in that hinterland between aggravation and laugh-out-loud funny, but I deal w/it and finally he deposits a slightly-more-than-warm cup in front of me.\n\"Try that. . .tell me how it is.  We want to make sure it's just right for you.\"\nI give him the New Yorker Who's Seen It All nod, and pick up the cup, and turn away, raising the cup to take a sip as I return to my laptop and WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW\n*What* was I just doing?  Where am I, again?  What?  What, what, what. . .WHAT?\nTaste *explosion*. \nLong story short (TOO LATE!) This is the Best. Coffee. I've. Ever. Had.  Period. I'm not a believer now, I'm an embarrassing acolyte.  That's right; I'm one of those silly people that brags that their coffeeshop is better than yours.\nBecause it is.  Trust.\nPostscript: Although I don't drink coffee from anywhere else unless I have to, there are a couple of times I've had to, and realized that *Incredibly*, Philz is actually CHEAPER than many places (COUGHStarbucksCOUGH). My small mocha is just 3 bucks; which means it's a bit cheaper than the colored water that other folks are serving up.

They enjoy what they do and really care about making sure people get the right cup of coffee. Unfortunately I have to go out of my way to go here, or else I would go more often.

The second best is the Philz by the AT&T park.  They are always consistent as well.  I would say my least favorite is the location on van ness. Everyone working there is amazing, but I have never had a good mint mojito iced coffee there.

Wednesday when I felt some \"will probably have an emotional streetside meltdown if I don't get coffee and a snack in the next 30 minutes\" tummy rumblings.  Just then Philz popped out of nowhere.  After admitting I had never heard of this apparent San Francisco staple, I was ushered in by my very enthusiastic friend.\nI'm not gonna lie - the confusing menu completely threw me off, and I ended up having the following conversation with the guy behind the counter:\n(Me) Uhm, tall americano? Do you have a tall americano? Please? Where is Starbucks? I'm scared.\n(Guy) *patient world-wise chuckle* Actually all of our drinks are different blends of coffee.  I can help you find something you'll like.\n(Me) *Two-year-old on the verge of pouting glare* But...I don't like coffee. I like americanos.\n(Guy) Okay. Just trust me. It's 3:00 in the afternoon. It's the middle of the week. I assume you want something that'll pick you up and coast you into the evening.  Nothing too crazy, but a little caffeine, right?\n(Me) *mute nodding*\n(Guy) Alright, sugar and cream? (More mute nodding)  I'm blending you a Jacob's Special, but I'm also mixing in some Ethiopian decaf, so you don't get too wild. (I feel I am beginning to trust him)\nFive minutes later he hands me his creation.  As I raise the cup to my lips he says \"You're going to like it.  The Ethiopian blend adds some chocolate notes to the cup.\" (Now, I'm the type of person who likes wine tasting because it gets you drunk, not because I can taste the \"hint of asparagus\" in that 07 chardonnay - but seriously, you could taste the chocolate!!!)\nAnyway, I went to pay and picked up a lentil sambosa (SO good - spicy and light) on the way.  At $3.00 for a cup of coffee, it's definitely not the cheapest joint in town.  That said, it is an awesome treat, and I was definitely impressed by the counter guy's ability to make me something I would like based on the 30 seconds of semi-coherent ramblings that fell out of my mouth when we walked in the door.

The coffee and tea drinks are very fresh each time.  The baristas take their time in making the drinks and always and always ask whether it is to my taste.

Everyone raves about it, the service is super friendly, and there's one just around the corner from me.  That said, I can't get past the fact that I'm paying over 3$ for a cup of coffee.  To be clear: this is drip coffee.  A regular cup.  It's good coffee, sure, and there's a wide selection of beans.  But is it all that special?  Maybe people are too used to coffee sitting in an urn all day, or from a pot on a burner in the office.  I make fresh coffee daily (drip, french press, moka, etc.) with decent beans and get something of similar quality to this - not bitter, custom cream and sugar (ooh!) - in a few more minutes than the baristas at Philz, no special tricks or anything.

I've gone to Philz often and am a pretty patient person overall but today was the last straw. I've had multiple instances where the baristas are just rude.\n \n*I ask for a mojito and I get glared at by the barista. She's looking at me while making the drink and just giving me dirty looks. I don't know why \"can I get a mint mojito please\" pisses her off but I head over to the purchase line to finish the transaction. I write it off to her having a bad day.\n\n*I come back a different time and I get the same barista (bad news!). I think fine, no problem. I ask for an iced coffee and when I pick it up, the taste is off. I ask for it to be sweetened more and again, I get the glare again while she adds the sweetener. How dare I feel that the drink isn't perfect. \n\n*I order a coffee and ask for a cup of water. I'm told, \"yeah it's over there.\"  The cashier person looks at the sink across the room and then then moves to the next person in line. I don't receive the water and am just stunned. If I could get it myself I would, but it's behind the counter and I don't have access to it. \n\n*I walk in and I hear someone say \"can I help you?\" I look around and no one is looking at me but the barista looks like she's looking down and making drinks and a worker heads over to the bagel stand. I don't know who spoke to me. The barista is making drinks so I look at the menu for the non-coffee options. I'm just looking and decide on a tea. A dude pops up behind the counter, we share eye contact, so I think it's okay to order my tea. After I order, he then tells me to order through the barista because it can get busy during peak hours and to essentially follow the system. Notice, I'm the only one in line because it's NOT BUSY AT ALL. I get it, follow the system. I wouldn't mind that and I usually do order through the barista first but there's no reason to look like you bit into a lemon with a sour look on your face when I try to explain my mistake. WHen the barista calls my order, she's looking at the customers ahead of her and not at the counter when setting the tea down. The cup spills over some tea. Thank you for making me feel special. \n\nI'm not making a blanket statement that all the baristas are rude. After all, they are actually very pleasant generally and make good suggestions for drinks. However, when spending $3 per cup for coffee/tea, I have higher standards for customer service. It's okay to have bad days but please don't take it out on me.", "author": "Melanie A."}

Let me start by saying that I'm not really a coffee fan...I don't care for the way it tastes, but unfortunately law school made it somewhat mandatory.  That being said, Philz coffee is like nothing I've ever had...doesn't taste like your usual cup of coffee, but I can't put my finger on what's so different about it; it's the silkiest coffee I've ever had.  And it gets me wired, which is a super-plus for us students.  My favorite blends are the Tesora and Amborsia.  If you're a first-timer there, I suggest you start with the Tesora, which is like their \"staple\" blend.  The barista's are super friendly and cheerful and will take the time to ask you how you like your coffee so that they can suggest the perfect cup for you (coffee or tea? what kind of roast? milk? sweet?).  The manager here is also super friendly and makes sure to wave at me through the window every day I walk by.

I told the barista that I tried to make my own version of Philz using their beans at home and could not make it taste the same. I asked him why and he said I was missing the secret ingredient...LOVE. Not true...I do love Philz coffee.", "author": "Alana S."}

Yes, their coffee is wonderful, but it is their mint iced tea that has won me over.  It is the most refreshing and fresh iced tea I have ever had and I never tire of it.  I have my co-workers hooked and one of my co-workes calls me a \"pusher\".  And, the staff strives for perfection with each cup made.", "author": "Bernie B."}

The manufacturer's cream is unbelievably creamy and comes highly recommended. Only been there a handful of times but I have to say this was easily one of the best and most memorable coffee houses I've had the pleasure of setting foot in.", "author": "Andres G."}

Just about every weekend this is the place I look forward to for a treat. I love to sit there, people watch, chat with the friendly staff and also, sip my beloved beverage, Ambrosia, with cream (real cream) - heavenly and sinful. I make a passable effort to watch my fat intake, but this delicious cream is tough to resist...  come for the boutique coffee and relaxed atmosphere!!!", "author": "Vat S."}

I don't consider myself a coffee addict anymore although I do occasionally enjoy having coffee because I like the taste and I enjoy the caffeine rush. By pleasant coincidence, I was headed out to the War Memorial Opera House for an event, and some friends and I decided to go nearby for a hot drink before the event started. I noticed that there was a Philz a couple of blocks away so we went there. The people working there are super friendly and helpful. And, their drinks were yummy. I love that they ask you to taste your drink and give your approval or they will fix it for you. That's a true sign of good customer service. I enjoyed it so much that I brought another friend there a few days ago for a lovely afternoon tea break. I think I love their tea as much or even more than their coffee. The green tea made with cream, honey, and special Philz spices is delicious. I can't wait to go back! (^_^)", "author": "Lisa M."}

I just want it to taste good and have a lot of caffeine in it.  So when I go into Philz, I ask for strong coffee, taste-wise and caffeine-wise.  I don't know what it is that they give me, but it tastes perfect.  Best coffee ever.  And the people who work there are really nice.", "author": "M M."}

I love the care with which the server handles all the orders.  How can someone make it so perfect to taste when the only thing I said was \"not too sweet\" please?!  He politely asked me how I liked my drink and noted that he can fix it to the way I want it after already having spent 2mins on preparing it for the first try.  I know that this level of service is not to be expected if this place gets crowded like the castro or mission locations.  I know because I have been to all of them, and trust me, I can tell the difference in the quality.  I selfishly want the business to be slow here :) and make this my little secret.", "author": "Adele W."}

Also, someone already mentioned a barista guy was really kind and explained well about their coffee. Another thing i like there was a variety of coffee beens.  They have many different kinds of beens behind a bar. So, if you guys want to try something different, why don't you go and grab a cup of coffee?", "author": "WONIL P."}

It's about the slow talking barrista whose arrogance and smugness would make George W. Bush Jr. look like a lamb.  Upon arriving at Philz we were waiting in the wrong spot - how could we know?. The barrista admonished us in a condescending voice \"This is more like a bar than a coffee shop. Come over here.\" Then he proceeded to talk about himself the entire time he was making  our coffee. After I had burnt myself due to his overfilling the cup, instead of asking me how I was, he criticized the way I put the top on.", "author": "Yanni G."}

When I went in this morning to get my coffee, I was so excited to have a delicious cup of Philz spectacular coffee.  Its a pricey splurge for me.  First two interactions with people working there, lovely.  (Wish I'd gotten names) Let me make it clear, there were NO people in line, so there was clearly time to give decent customer service. Then this happened:  I started out by telling the person who took my order what I would like.  Instead of teaching me with kindness by asking me questions about what I wanted and helping me to understand the best way to ask for it, the person making the coffee decided to look at me like I had three heads, *tell* me what I wanted and then crack jokes about me to his co-worker while I had to stand there waiting for my coffee, hearing every word.  Thanks for a really craptacular start to my morning. The half-assed \"take care\"  raised the craptacular bar even higher. I really love Philz coffee, and was happy to have an alternative to Peet's, but I'm not going to give my money to a store that makes me feel like I don't \"belong\" there.  Such a drag. Really, such a drag.", "author": "Jim E."}

They personalize your coffee to your standards and they're extremely friendly.  They treat you like family.  Ever since our first experience I buy coffee there frequently.  Just last week, they were closing for the night when my fiance and I arrived.  To my astonishment they reopened the shop just so we can buy 2 cups of coffee.  HOW AMAZING IS THAT!  They actually treat you like family.  On top of that, it's the best coffee I've ever tasted.", "author": "Janelle F."}
