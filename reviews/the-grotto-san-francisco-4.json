The main reason I chose this place was because of the seating and it's indoors which was needed on the day I was there, a bit on the cold side.\nI ordered the crab melt sandwich which consisted of dungenous crab meat mixed into a salad a slice of pickle and American cheese. The sandwich was rather tasty and fresh, though I bit too small for the price.\n\nThe service was what's expected at a boardwalk food establishment, okay I guess.\n\nOver all i enjoyed the place, though if you asked me to recommend it, I'll say if you need a place to sit and eat then go for it.", "author": "Enrique O."}

The upstairs area was waaay fancier than I expected but it has sweeping views of the marina, city and part of the bridge. Even on a foggy day it was a nice lunch time view. You get complimentary sourdough bread which was hot, fresh and delicious! Not that I needed more bread because literally within minutes of placing my order the waiter showed up with a giant bread bowl filled with clam chowder. The chowder had a great flavor - creamy, rich and the leeks are perfect.

The fish was beer battered snapper (if memory serves). The fish was just a bit mushy; not sure if that's because fish & chips is typically a flakier cod. Not that big of a deal, except the fish wasn't seasoned under the batter. \n\nExperience:  quick seating with a good view of Fisherman's Wharf.

Sadly it has lost its charm and flavor. \n\nMenu was overpriced, lacked a fish of the day and most of it wasn't local. \n\nCaesar salad was large portion but ruined with cucumbers and sprinkled with paprika. Why? Maybe it's to compensate for the lack of crunch from the soggy croutons and drowned Parmesan or lack of freshly cracked black pepper. \n\nEntree was crab stuffed sole (one of two \"local\" fish on menu) but didn't have choice on preparation. Crab stuffing tasted like cafeteria tuna salad with its red bell peppers and celery. The sole was undercooked and sat on an island of mashed potatoes with spinach in a sea of butter sauce. \n\nThe service, view, sourdough bread and wine were the positives and Mauricio was good enough to comp the entree that wasn't eaten. \n\nAdvice to owner - keep it clean and simple.

Being here before, I recommended it to some friends from out of town. After our visit last night, I'm highly upset that they didn't receive what what great before.\n\nAlthough it didn't look busy, we made reservations ahead of time just to speed up the process. We got a table within 10 minutes, even though the wait time without reservations was about 20 minutes.\n\nFirst impressions are key. My friends immediately hated the place because they thought it looked beat up and old. It's actually upstairs. Walk through the closed, ugly door and walk up the nice staircase. The restaurant atmosphere is really nice and spacious. It's a good place, I think, to have large parties.\n\nWe sat down. Staff member poured us water. Fresh, hot sourdough bread and butter placed on the table. Everything's going good so far. Things started going south quickly after.\n\nBeing courteous, we told her right off the bat that we'd like split checks. We thought it would make her life a little easier, but she insisted on assigning seat numbers and working from that. Sure, we'll go with that. Whatever floats her boat right? Fast forward to the end of the meal, we reminded her again that we'd like split checks. She comes back with ONE bill. Alright, maybe she didn't hear us. We got her attention and told her that there was a mistake and she didn't give us two separate checks. She comes back with two checks, but the mistake wasn't fixed. At that point, I would have just left cash and been on my way, but that mistake was around $15. No way were we paying $15 for something that was too raw to consume.\n\nOkay, the food. We got - the crab melt with fries, fish and chips, shrimp and chips, clam chowder in a bowl, lobster mac and cheese, and seared scallops with risotto. Pros, they give you lots of fries. It was literally so much that I regretted not getting a salad instead. Crab melt and fish and chips were good. A little too much batter on the fish. The shrimps looked huge, which was initially a yay, but you know it's bad when the kid is peeling off all the breading and just attacking the shrimp. My friends got the mac and risotto. Long story short, mac was decent, but risotto was raw. She would have been okay with it, but even the scallops weren't cooked correctly. Not worth the stomach ache. We sent it back. They offered to recook it, but she went with fish and chips because it's something you can't go wrong with. They also ordered clam chowder in a bowl. The received a bread bowl. It's a measly $2, but that just showed how inattentive our server was.\n\nI'm sorry I took my friends back here, but I'm even more sorry that they couldn't really enjoy fresh seafood in San Francisco on their visit. Do yourself a favor and skip going here. You're better off going to the street vendors. Save you some money and taste how good food on the wharf is.

We searched on here to find something to eat and I chose this place. So we made an online reservation and walked our way to the grotto. Upon approaching the front, we thought we were being deceived because the place looked janky and out of business. Eventually we figured it out and walked up the stairs to a more elegant and formal dining area. We were seated and the fresh and hot sourdough bread were placed on our table. My boyfriend and I ordered a clam chowder bowl to start. For entrees, we ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and seared scallops. The clam chowder came out but the server gave it to us in a BREAD bowl. I... I didn't want more bread... but whatever I didn't make it a big deal. What's $2 more I guess. The clam chowder itself was delicious. Flavorful and just the right consistency. The entrees looked delicious. I went in to cut my scallops and they looked translucent. So I touched it with my finger and it was lukewarm. But I pride myself on a strong stomach so I just took a bite anyways. Okay takes good. The dish came with risotto so I took a bite out of that and as Gordon Ramsey would say, \" IT'S RAAAAAAAW!\" The risotto was still crunchy and starchy. I took another bite so I didn't mistaken it, but again it was starchy and gritty. So disappointing. I was contemplating on whether I should just deal with it but naw no way I ain't paying $30 for raw upset stomachs and uncooked rice. So we told a different server and sent it back. I got fish and chips instead because you can't go wrong with fish and chips. Right? Anyways as I was waiting for the new order, I was picking at my boyfriends lobster mac. It was good but they were stingy on the lobster. Hmm. Well on to the fish and chips. The fish was good. Well seasoned. The batter was a bit thick but it was beer batter so it's going to be thick regardless. The slaw was bomb definitely cut through the heaviness of the fish. And their tartar sauce was excellent. \n\nSo at the end of the meal, we asked for our checks and in the beginning we told our server that we wanted split checks between us and our friends. And that we swapped the seared scallops for the fish and chips instead. We got our checks and 1. They were not split. 2. They didn't swap out the seared scallops. So we told the server again and she got the first part right but this time she just left out the seared scallops. Soooooo we told her AGAIN and she finally got it right. But everytime she's walk away it would take so long for her to come back. My boyfriend never even got a refill on his drink. \n\nSo all in all, service really sucked and the food was ok to alright. It's so overpriced but I guess they can charge that for being in the heart of Pier 39. I just wouldn't come here again. Better off getting the same food in the stands outside. Also it'd be cheaper.

The hostess was incredibly sweet, and let us sit in the dining area (even though it wasn't technically for happy hour). The bar tender/ person who served us was SO SWEET. She was extremely attentive, and made sure we were always taken care of. I had 4 glasses of wine (don't judge), my bf had a beer & 3 cocktails. Only 5 dollars for wine and 4 for cocktails during happy hour!!\nI'm not a fan of calamari, but my bf was craving it so we bought some during happy hour ($9). IT WAS SO YUMMY. I have switched to liking calamari just because of this restaurant. \nThe oysters also had delicious sauces on the side (let's get real, the sauces are the best part) and were a great deal ($9 for 6!!).

The waiter was rude and asked which card we will be using to  leave him a tip. The were many flys around the seafood displayed areas, which made us question the cleanliness of the place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-18", "description": "Dropped by today (aug. 18th) not knowing where to eat in San Francisco.  I'm here for my birthday weekend and I've never experienced such a HORRIBLE service from any restaurant.  This behavior was unacceptable.  We stopped here because Fisherman's Wharf is a must do in San Francisco, the restaurant looked nice and what caught my attention was the Smoked Salmon plate with bagel.  But what REALLY caught my attention was when the host outside said they had an upstairs seating section with the view of the Golden Gate Bridge, who doesn't want to see that?  \n\nTo the food now, the food was ok.  The appetizers were better than the actual meal.  We are there eating our appetizers then our food comes.  Our server starts taking our dishes away without asking us if we were ok.  We had about 8 more shrimp to eat and he took it.  We all starred at each other with a WTF face.  I look at my plate and my greens looked pale, they felt warm.  The bagel, it wasn't a bagel, it felt and tasted like a brioche bun.  The red onions looked old.  The ONLY thing that was cold and looked legit were the tomatoes and just because they were seasoned with salt and pepper after they had sliced them.  My boyfriends crab Benedict did not include the Canadian bacon, he specifically said can you please add the crab, he did NOT say to substitute the Canadian bacon for crab, he wanted both.   The server was nowhere to be seen so we asked a busser that we needed service.  The server comes to us within minutes and said what's wrong, we explained but he didn't apologize, he just said I'll bring it right now, he didn't make an effort to take the plate back and remake it.  The friend then asked for hot sauce, he only offered her tobasco but she can't have tobasco and she asked if they had anything else and he said \"you're going to have to wait because I have to go downstairs and grab it for you, so you'll have to wait\". That was SO uncalled for.  Minutes later he comes back with the hot sauce and REGULAR BACON.  My boyfriend at that point lost his appetite.  He did NOT want to eat anymore, we called over the busser again because we didn't see our server and within seconds the server comes and asks what's wrong.  I explained everything.  He wanted to make things right by taking back the plate and actually doing it right but we said no, he said he had spoken to the manager and that the plate was taken off our bill, we didn't ask them to, we told him we would gladly pay for it.  I then lost my appetite and so did my friend, we ask for the bill and the server comes and SLAMS the check on the table saying HERE YOU GO! I stare and my friend and say WOW! That right there did it for me.  I would NEVER, in a million years act like that towards anyone if I were a server, which I AM!  This was SO unprofessional and rude, I was just shocked.  This is my first time visiting this city and I already hate it.  You sir need to check your attitude before starting your shift, leave your problems behind because once you clock in...you're working for someone who is paying you to treat their customers right, if you don't serve people YOU don't get paid.  \n\nI will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again, not even after having spoken to the manager which offered me to come back, I just can't believe what I experienced here today.  \n\n\nI usually don't read reviews before visiting a restaurant because I want to have my OWN experience but after reading their reviews it must say, THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE....do NOT come here if you want a nice experience, it's NOT worth it.", "author": "Alfredo S."}

The place looks decent from outside but nobody was at the door to greet us so we seated ourselves at the outside dining area. Few minutes later, an Asian man (seemed to be the one in-charged) approached us and mentioned that part of the outside dining area is still closed until 11:30am. He pointed on the other side for us to stay and suggested to buy our food from the self-serve counter. My family seated themselves at the available table in the area where he pointed out. While I was in line waiting for my turn to place an order, this same  arrogant Asian man approached me again for the second time to tell me that the table for 4 where my family had occupied will be for other customers that comes in group. (There are four of us, by the way). Technically, he is kicking us out.  I felt so embarrassed after my mother asked me why we were being discriminated.

I'm my experience I paid for the ambiance and view. I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was bland had a total of 5 shrimp, for $30 it's not what I was expecting. My son had a quesadilla that was cold and overpriced $10, it came with some stale chips and unimpressive gu\u00e1calamole. The worst was my husband meal, after waiting for over 40 minutes to finally get his crab, it came with a nice black hair in it too.", "author": "Samantha R."}

We started out with the calamari and pop corn shrimp. Our server was Armando, he caterd to our every need and I never had to ask him for anything. His service was on point. The MOD was Marvin and he came to our table a few times to check on us and ask us how we were and talked to us. I personally like when Managers engage with customers it makes the experience even better and more personal. My crab was cooked perfectly. Butter on the side and a ton of fresh garlic in the sauce. My son had chicken fingers and even got a small treat of ice cream and cookies after. I'll definitely be coming back to the Grotto for the service and food. Hope to see both of them again.

The redesign is nice, and I really like the bar area with the fireplace -- it's modern, mod and clean. The food was ok to good but the service was slow and unattentive. The waiter was not very friendly and seemed aloof. I noticed they had a lot of staff on site although it wasn't very busy so I was confused to why the service was so slow. I had to ask for my cocktail twice and it only arrived when my food came. I also ordered crab, and the crab utensils (e.g., cracker/tongs) didn't come out until a few minutes after the crab -- therefore, my meal was cold.", "author": "Jessica S."}

My dining partner asked about a spinach that was with the stuffed sole and his explanation of the dish was to read back the label on the menu. . . .poor guy was not trained at all. Bottom line is that the new owners had a wonderful chance to carry on a S.F. tradition and sadly IMHO they failed miserably.
