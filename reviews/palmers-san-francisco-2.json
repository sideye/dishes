Ever since I moved here, this has been my \"go to\" spot. \n\nDespite the service subpar to put it mildly, the patio and mussels kept me coming back. \n\nTo be honest, after tonight I don't think I'll go back. The service was worse than usual. The server only refilled my water upon my request and I had to ask for more drinks and flag him down each time. He left the table for over an hour without coming back. If they are THAT busy, they need to hire more help. Without getting into a ton of detail, the waiter that works the cocktail area on Friday nights is an entitled prick in my opinion. He's lazy and gives lousy service. Tips are based on performance and I refuse to leave 20% just for the sake of social norm. I waited tables all thorough under grad so I have been there and I get it. \nThey recently changed their supplier for the mussels as well and they are fishy tasting and I won't be ordering them again.

The food isn't anything to go out of your way for, but this was conveniently located across the street from the Clay Theater, so we pre-gamed here before one of their midnight showings. There is definitely a loud, happening vibe here on Friday nights. \n\nRESERVATIONS: We made reservations just a few days in advance online (8 people, 9pm, Friday). They were very flexible and let us sit late, when only 3 of us were there. Our group filtered in slowly over the next hour, and we had basically a private booth in the back (there was a curtain that drew closed around it!\n\nTHE COST: $211.11 before tax/tip for drinks and some dishes for 6 people.  Overall I felt their food was overpriced, but the drinks were fair. \n\n* Bee's Knees cocktail ($12) - 4.5 stars\nDelicious! Refreshing, well-balanced, not overly sweet.\n\n* Penicillin cocktail ($13) - 4 stars\nI rarely like scotch cocktails, yet this one was really well made, with a good balance of flavors. \n\n* Spicy meatballs ($16.75) - 3 stars\nNot very impressive.

We decided not to stay for dinner because immediately the experience was off to a bad start. We weren't greeted, and finally when he came (15 minutes later, I mean seriously I sat there staring for what felt like forever) it was \"what would you like\". Simple and nothing more. \n\nBiggest complaint was the fact that we always received food before our drinks. Such a let down. And one of the drinks was forgotten for 20 minutes, and then randomly slid onto the table watered down. No acknowledgement of the fact that my boyfriend had to wait 20 minutes for his scotch. \n\nThe food was bland, we ordered a kale salad- came with some other lettuce. The sauce was pretty nice actually. But the leaves were too tough, they should have sat for a moment to soften. \n\nThe drinks were strange too. You could barely taste the alcohol in one, and it tasted like there was just pure sweet lime juice and nothing else in my Parisian bouquet. \n\nThe truffle fries were actually pretty good. But the only person around the whole time was the bus staff. The bussers were fast, on top of things, and more than happy to grab us anything we needed (water and sauces and stuff) because the waiter was never around.\n\nDeviled eggs were the worst. I don't know who's idea it was to combine all those random things, and put green oil on it, but it was GROSS. \n\nFunny enough both tables next to us we're also not pleased- and one gentleman said the bbq sauce with his ribs tasted like pure ketchup. \n\nThe hostess would seat a table and it would take about 10-15 min for people to get greeted. \n\nWe came in for a drink and app and the experience ended up taking an hour and a half. It makes me sad. Just a little more detail and intention and this place could be really great. \n\nJust maybe encourage your wait staff to say a \"welcome in, how are you?\" here and there. Sometimes personality can outweigh ALOT OF OTHER ISSUES. \n\nAlso- the faster you are to get the liquor to the table, the more likely people are to spend. Buzzed means you order more. He probably couple have got 2-3 more drinks out of us had that been the case. Booze = money.", "author": "Sierra B."}

In practically every one of their reviews, the words \"happy hour\" would come up.  Which suited us just fine since a good happy hour on Fillmore was exactly what we were looking for!  And apparently, if I was ever going to check them out, it should be for happy hour!\n\nStepping inside of Palmer's, it almost felt like stepping back in time.  Harry's down the street has a similar \"old San Francisco\" vibe, but it's much stronger here.  The wood paneling, the light fixtures, the metal studded leather furniture, the mounted animal heads perched above the bar...all of it adds to that retro sort of feel.  Fortunately, the menu didn't look have the same dated look, as it offered a solid mix of starters to choose from (much needed, current photos below).\n\nHappy Hour: Daily, 4-6pm\n- Food Menu (as of 10/2016): (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/palmers-san-francisco-2?select=tv6UHw1o3Kbry3XObB698Q)\n- Drink Menu (as of 10/2016): (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/palmers-san-francisco-2?select=wLL2AX3eJ2LhDp5IIP71VA)\n\n-- PIMM'S CUP - Pimm's No. 1, Cucumber, Lime, Mint, Ginger Beer...$8\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/palmers-san-francisco-2?select=wbNh8nKZy-vwBBPRzDNOgQ)\nIf you've never had a Pimm's Cup before, it's like a cross between a Mojito and a Moscow Mule.  Sadly though, this wasn't as enjoyable as either one.  I don't know if it was the Pimm's, the ginger beer, or the mint, but the drink had a weird tinge to it that took some getting used to, in addition to being a bit sweet.\n\n-- DEVILED EGGS...$2.50 (2 Pieces)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/palmers-san-francisco-2?select=4MqBa2OUADGOWatmWWA0YQ)\nI love deviled eggs, but ironically, I actually liked the rest of the components better.  That's not to say the egg was bad though; it's just that the taste of the yolk portion didn't amaze.  However, I liked the bacon and jalapenos, as well as the pickled onions, as they added salty and acidic elements.\n\n-- CURRIED FRIES...$4\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/palmers-san-francisco-2?select=TqDh3aQj_BXT3uO4r_IgTA)\nWhile it didn't have a strong curry flavor specifically (rather, it just wasn't what I expected), this was great!  Not only were the fries cooked to the perfect crispiness, but they were seasoned really well (not heavy handed, but enough to pack a punch).  I'd definitely recommend this.\n\nGiven how little of their food and drinks we tried, I can't say with a ton of confidence how Palmer's ranks overall.  However, after skimming through their dinner menu online, I can see why everyone says happy hour is the best time to come here.  From what I can tell, a lot of the same starters can be had, but at notably lower prices (though still kind of pricey compared to other HH menus I've seen).  In any case, Palmer's may not be a bad bet...for happy hour, at least.", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-31", "description": "Disclaimer: This review is exclusively for the front bar. Palmer's is a gem. As a happy Pacific Heights resident, I actually find it difficult to find restaurants or bars that are on my wavelength. My friends cheekily remind me that I've been living in the wrong 'hood and should be in NoPa or Hayes Valley. That said, when I finally stopped by Palmer's the other night with some friends I was relieved to know there's a place on Fillmore I'd happily return to. My two friends and I wanted an early evening cocktail to end our weekend. We went in around 7 PM and sat at the bar. We were quickly greeted by the bartender and he provided us with menus. You can order food at the bar as evidenced by the well-dressed gentleman who sat next to me savoring a hearty meal. But, as I mentioned, my party was there for a cocktail party. I ordered a Parisian Bouquet which had gin, elderflower, lime, grapefruit, and basil. It was refreshing and bright. You also have a choice of vodka instead of gin. My friend ordered a delicious chardonnay from their impressive wine list (On a related note: he'd been to Palmer's before and found it charming the first time.) His boyfriend ordered a scotch-based cocktail which he enjoyed. We sat there for a little over an hour and during that time the bartender checked up on us twice to make sure we were good with drinks and whatnot. I appreciated that he maintained his distance but was still attentive -- so few know how to strike that balance nowadays. Another bartender rang us up on the way out and she too was delightful.\n\nThe overall restaurant is handsomely appointed: rich colors/fabrics and rustic tavern-like lighting and mood. The ambiance is lively but not painfully loud nor crowded. In other words, it's bustling but you have elbow room. The clientele (at least that night) is a mixed bag of older neighborhood sophisticates, 40-something couples in classic Ralph Lauren, handsome men and lovely women wearing Patagonia, and 30-something ladies in Scotch & Soda-like attire enjoying beverages and juicy gossip. \n\nPalmer's is now on my list as a go-to spot for a laid-back environment appropriate for friend time.", "author": "James Z."}

You're only supposed to drink here, and only during happy hour when you can get great deals on food.  Mea culpa.  I brunched here, late on a Saturday afternoon, without first reading the yelp instructions:  happy hour happy hour happy hour.   \n\nBut let me tell you about brunch.  \n\nThe inside was dead as can be and, as a result, looked like a completely inhospitable place to brunch unless one sought alone time with one's newspaper, a bloody mary, a stiff cuppa joe, and food.  There's a market for that and if you're that market, welcome to Palmer's.\n\nThere's several sidewalk tables which bring you a little more up-front and center with humanity and signal the onset of a good time.  Of course I brunched there and since I'd done no reconnaissance my expectations were low.  The result?  A tasty fennel sausage omelet, good home-fried potatoes, oft-refilled coffee, and a perfectly chilled bottle of Ros\u00e9.  Another dish, an exuberant breakfast flatbread, received a similar stamp of approval from my tablemates. \n\nPalmer's isn't trying to be the latest thing which probably accounts for the reason it'd never before wound up on my radar.  But often, one just wants brunch, and not from the trendiest spot in town.  Palmer's is nice looking inside and serves up a good brunch and, apparently, a great happy hour.

Huzzah for the arrival of the Chosen One, Palmer's, which has weathered the buffeting winds of exorbitant rents and fickle patrons! But, of course, it's owned by the pair who have made Leopold's on Polk (that awesome Austrian gasthaus you look into sometimes, where everyone seems to be having more fun than you have ever had in your whole life and are all holding massive boots of beer) so successful. I imagine those two could single-handedly revive half the failing restaurants in this city. \n\nThings to love: \nThe atmosphere. Very unique and cool, with gleaming wooden surfaces and floors, comfortable, studded, ruby leather chairs, glittering mirrors lined with bottles, high ceilings with elegant light fixtures, and arresting, controversial, and (in my mind) beautiful animal heads jutting from wooden panels above the bar.\n\nThe Happy Hour: Unlike some bars, which like to play games by putting their least alcoholic, least delicious selections on their cheap list, Palmer's puts some of its best here--and it has some of the best Happy Hour prices in the whole city. The best drinks: the Old Pal, the Boulvardier, and the Parisian Bouquet (get it with gin)\n\nThe Cocktail List: Extensive and fantastic--especially their whiskey drinks. Even when it's not Happy Hour, the prices aren't too bad considering the heights to which so many others appear to have risen in the last year. No idea, though, why the list isn't on their website--there is literally no way to see it unless you walk past the restaurant. Seeing that this is the best thing about the place, I'd recommend posting that menu!\n\nThing (yes, singular) to less-than-love: the food prices. If it's not Happy Hour, the food here is too expensive. It's not bad, but it's also not great. Were they to decrease the prices a little, or perhaps add some entree options that were less than $20, I might eat here more regularly. As is, this is my Go-To Happy Hour place but not where I take anyone for meals.", "author": "Ali M."}

When it came down to dinner time we referenced Yelp for a suggestion.  The couple of places were either closed or had too long of a wait time that we did not want to deal with.  We decided to go to the Fillmore and we had a back plan of La Mediterranee - my wife and my first date together - a Classic and a sure thing on reminiscing alone.   As we finally found parking, we walked by Palmer's and I was enamored by the small groups of people eating outside and enjoying a nice libation out in the little bit of sunshine the City had to offer.  We continued to walk towards La Med when I came to a complete stop.  The thought of eating potentially good food in an old world bar atmosphere seemed like a good idea.  I talked my wife and eleven year old son into popping our heads in to explore a little bit more.  We decided to give it a go!\n\nWe ordered a deviled egg each which was topped with a small slice of bacon and a pickeled jalapeneo.  It was also served with pickled onions, carrots and cauliflower.  My son opted for the small plates of mac and cheese and creamed spinach - and a large glass of milk - which our server stated, \"Hadn't heard that in a while.\"   My wife opted for the burger on a Brioche bun with curried fries.  I had the pan roasted chicken that was served with Gruyere mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed kale.  And a Ballast Point Sculpin.\n\nThe food was delicious - the atmosphere was the type where you could spend hours just sipping on a drink and eating at a slow leisurely pace.

We were a group of six, looking for a table at 8pm on a Saturday evening. We called up Palmer's and to our surprise they had a booth for us. When we arrived the place was hopping. Super loud, do not go for an intimate dinner for two. Unless you are cool people watching, and not being able to hear yourself think. We had company from London, so with the thought that we wanted to hear each other, the hostess moved us to a back booth with a curtain. Perfect space to dine like a King.\n\nWe started off with cocktails and deviled eggs. Cocktails were imaginative and delightful. Loved the Bee's Knees. Deviled eggs were good, and were able to order bacon free if you so desire.\n\nNext we ordered a bunch of plates and shared family style. We ordered the vegetarian gnocchi, burratta with peas, beet salad, flatbread, mussels and burger with curry fries. All except the burratta were much better then expected. I somehow thought it would be mediocre bar food, but was definitely an elevated meal. The big disappointment was the burratta, which was tasteless and crying out for salt, pepper, olive oil and/or aged balsamic. I'm a huge burratta fan, and was bummed that is arrived so bland.\n\nThe knockdown from five stars to four was for their dessert options. The menu selection was so boring we didn't even order a dessert to share. They definitely need to kick it up a notch in the desserts.\n\nStaff was friendly and attentive.

The gnocchi was excellent, slightly crisped but soft on the inside sitting on top of duck bolognese. I got full about halfway through but it tasted so good I forced myself to eat the rest. My husband ordered the salmon which was also cooked to perfection. If you're in the mood for something light but flavorful this is the dish for you. It came with some crunchy vegetables which was a great touch if you're able to include some in every bite. \n\nUnfortunately the dessert was nothing like the entrees. We ordered two vanilla bean creme burlees for a table of 6 to share and we ended up sending both back. The entire thing (both of them) were freezing cold and gelatinous, the caramel on top tasted burnt and was crunchy only in the center and not on the sides.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-10", "description": "Stopped here with a friend on Sunday afternoon (just before 5pm). We had appetizers which were pretty good: deviled eggs, pulled pork sliders, and brussels sprouts. The eggs were excellent and we were happy with the other appetizers as well. Our server was nice, although it was a little hard to get her attention sometimes, I think because she was very busy, but still good service overall for the meal. We had four appetizers for $33 --  the quality of the food was great for the price.\n\nIt's at an appealing location and the decor overall is nice except for 1) creepy dead animals mounted above the bar, and 2) inlaid Amish-style woodwork around the flat screen tv. This is like one of the bars where the owner decides to add their own special touches instead of using a professional, and the staff are too afraid to complain. At the same time, I really liked the lightning, chairs, and overall decor. The bathrooms were clean and beautiful. It was a nice space.\n\nThe only thing preventing this place from being 4 stars is the Sunday afternoon bar service. After the meal, we asked if we could move to the bar to get some cocktails. They wanted us to have the cocktails at our table, which was next to some really loud people shouting that they should short LinkedIn (even though MSFT already bought them). We wanted to get away from these people, and the bar was empty. We also wanted cocktails, so we insisted that we wanted to move to the bar, and the server asked if we could close out our table ticket, which we happily did and then sat down ready for a drink.\n\nIt was hard to get the bartender's attention even though there was one bartender and one assistant at the bar, and only about 5 other people sitting with us in the entire bar. Both the barhop and the bartender were only about 3 feet from us, washing dishes, having small talk, adjusting bottles, making drinks, and doing what people do on a fairly quiet Sunday afternoon. \n\nWe sat there for 15 minutes and no one asked us for our order. No one even said \"I'll be with you in a moment\". We waited. Then we waited some more.  Then I said saying \"excuse me, we'd like to order\", but was ignored. At that point, I suspected why the waitress wanted to be the one to get our drinks. I waited 5 more minutes and tried a little louder \"We'd like to order\", and was still ignored. Finally I had to raise my hand (hate doing that) and loudly say \"Excuse me, We'd like to order!\" at which point the barhop (and not the bartender) asked what we wanted. \n\nA note to the owner: A good bartender sees everything. Where a normal person would see a throng of people clamoring for drinks, the bartender knows who's standing where and for how long, how many drinks each person had, who is alone or with a friend or on a date. They see all.  You only need to make eye contact, and most of the time not even that. You don't need to say \"I'd like to order\", as you are at their bar without a drink. You should *never* have to raise your hand or gesticulate to get service at a bar, and waiting for 30 minutes is inexcusable outside of a club of Friday night type environment. This bartender just didn't have a vision of what his customers were up to. He was more in the mode of needing to be prompted for drinks and delivering them -- like someone working at the back of the house rather than at the front. \n\nEven then, no one offered to give us a drink menu or tried to promote any house specials.  I ordered a Sazerac and was given a very sweet drink which tasted like a splash of vermouth added to an ounce of Jim Bean bourbon and an ounce of simple syrup. They used one of the hip big square ice cubes which would be nice if the drink wasn't supposed to be chilled. A desiccated orange peel was placed across the top of the bucket.  The only thing they got right about this drink was that it's best served in a bucket, although if the bartender knew how to make it, he'd want to serve it in a cocktail glass. \n\nSo our experience was that the meal was good, prices were reasonable, bar was poor, and the dead animals were just creepy.

She asked me more than an okay number of times (at least six during the entire evening) if I wasn't going to order more food. I had other friends there with me who received the obviously friendlier service because they actually ordered a ginormous burger, sides, and drinks. \nOkay, maybe I should have ordered more since I was seated In a nice, cozy, dim-lit balcony but c'mon I was with friends- and the place was packed, let me be for goodness sake!\n\n\nFood: first of all, I got the wrong order- so I asked the waitress that she probably had misheard me and she resorted to arguing with me (in a passive-aggressive way with smiles and all) that she absolutely DID NOT mishear. All three of my friends at the table heard what I had ordered and kept supporting me but it took her at least five minutes to give up. Wow. Someone help this chick take her stubbornness elsewhere! \nThe food was all extremely oily and salty. I would not order the saut\u00e9ed/grilled vegetables ever again there. \n...Need I write more into trying to defend my reason for the sour rating?

Restaurants everywhere seemed crowded and had wait times, and Palmer's doesn't take reservations, but luckily they were able to take us right away when we arrived, so in we went.\n\nAnd I am so glad we did! From the outside, Palmer's is nondescript and very easy to miss among all the other shops and restaurants. On the inside, it's classy, intimate, and even a little historic, with deer heads and lots of photo frames mounted all over wooden walls. There is also a bar area, which makes it more comfortable. I ordered the entree special, which was a shortrib served on pappardelle and vegetables (25), and the shortrib was super duper tender. Other people got the steak (35), gnocchi (20), trout (24), salmon (25), and lamb (27 and massive), and everyone really liked their food.\n\nTo top it off, the waitress overhead us talking about our friend's birthday, and surprised her at the end with ice cream and a candle!\n\nNext time I'll try getting that curtained little table in the back corner.

And you know, maybe that's true on some nights, but it wasn't the night my lady and I ended up at Palmer's after our own little Fillmore cocktail crawl. \n\nAnd what a great place to end up. We sat at the bar, and enjoyed watching the bartender (a big, tattooed gent bedecked in a strong beard and a classic white barkeeper jacket), lovingly create each cocktail. He and the other keep were nice guys--friendly and talkative, but not so talkative as to be annoying. \n\nI don't remember which cocktails we ordered, but they were served in the old-timey glasses. In general, I'd say Palmer's is paying homage to the 1920s Jazz-era Fillmore Street: a vintage feel with lots of solid wood and incandescent lighting. I like it a lot--it's speakeasy-ish without the pretense.\n\nWe also had some food: the burger and the side of brussel sprouts. Both were well-priced, largely portioned, and delicious. Particular shout out for the brussel sprouts, which were cooked in balsamic, and cost only four dollars, for as many veges as you normally be able to buy for $4.

I have a small service animal due to a medical condition and he goes everywhere with me. We have been in Palmers more times than I can count. Yesterday I dropped in mid-afternoon and asked to sit in my usual spot. The hostess was unfamiliar to me and immediately started stressing about my dog being with me per usual, 100% of the time I go there. She said I couldn't be seated unless he was placed on the floor. I explained that wouldn't work for us since he needs to be close in order to manage my condition. I offered his paperwork and tags. She was not listening to me. Wait am I a customer, am I a human or something else to her? She stopped making eye contact and became abrupt and rude. It was if I was nothing.\n\nSome of you might be thinking oh a service dog, a bogus claim to get into a restaurant like so many in San Francisco. That's not the case. He is silent, trained, always swaddled and covered on my lap so as not to get on any furniture and as he has been trained.  He was professionally trained for 8 weeks as a puppy. He never ever gets near food, begs, etc. In fact, nobody ever notices him unless I am entering or leaving.\n\nShe didn't care she didn't want to see my paperwork which by the way is illegal to ask for. She's breaking the law in fact by even asking. I am sure if I were blind or deaf or with a large dog she would have rolled out the red carpet for me. I am not blind I have a chronic illness covered under the ADA that requires him to be with me.\n\nOne of the worst parts of this experience was that I am a regular customer with no familiar faces to greet me and an uncaring person treating me like I was nothing.

But this experience is like poison that I have to get out of me by telling someone.\n\nMy experience is solely with the bartenders/drinks.  I can't comment on food.  My story begins with a perfectly reasonable cocktail, Diablo something, ordered from a friendly bartender at a reasonable $8.50.  I went back and wanted something a little stiffer.  This is where my tale begins.  \n\nI asked for a double Makers on the the rocks.  The bartender types in a Makers into the POS.  Its $9.  I can SEE this with the EYES I have on my head.  He then clearly is puzzled as to how to put a double Makers into the system.  He heads off to my right to speak with what must have been the manager.  He comes back with my drink and my receipt.  \"$27 dollars.\"  Im rather surprised that a double makers cost $18 more than a single.  \"27 dollars?\", I say.  \"So you are telling me a single cost $14.50.\"  Looking me right in the eye - \"Yes.\"  \n\nI don't argue with restaurants, I don't send food back, and I never complain to anyone.    I wasn't about to start here.  I sign the check, even give a tip.  The point here is instead of checking on something that seemed wrong, ie a $27 dollar drink, he looks me in the face and charges me that amount.  Screw you dude.  Check on that.  \n\nI wish my story ends there.  However after drinking my cocktail I want just one more.  I head back to the bar and avoid eye contact with previous bartender.  I don't want to complain, I don't want him to comp anything, I just want to avoid the situation and get charged properly.  I also don't want to order a single Makers and seem like I am \"testing\" the price on him.  Just trying not to be a jerk here.  \n\nTo avoid any confusion and keep the price down, I order a \"whiskey on the rocks\".  When asked \"What kind of whiskey would you like,\" I respond \"whatever is fine\".  Mind you today is not my first rodeo - I have ordered drinks before.  Generally, when a patron does not specify the type of drink they would like, they want the cheapest you have because they are indifferent.  However, the bartender elected to serve me a $10 whiskey.  My bill was $10.  The brand was 4 shamrocks or something like that.  Again, possibly i should have specified that I would in fact not like your most expensive whiskey, but rather the cheapest.  So maybe its on me. But I don't think so. \n\nEither way, this is my experience, and my tale.  Screw you bartenders at Palmers.  I wish the same fate as Long Bar upon your establishment.", "author": "Matt L."}

Our bread order should have been a clear signal of where our meal was headed.

The Hostesses and our bartenders were outstanding, OUTSTANDING.   Our amazing hostess saved us from who I am guessing is the owner (obnoxious German(?) guy with the filthy rag hanging out of his pants), She looked mortified about how he carried himself and profusely apologized for his actions which I will get into later.  Our bartenders made an impeccable old fashioned, my favorite.  The bar staff were knowledgeable, fast and skilled.  It truly is a good looking bar.\n\nMy coworker and I have been on a Gastropub kick lately and wanted to check out the new place on Fillmore.  Note: website is under construction and Facebook goes to a German Lingerie company (I will expand later).  So based on yelp I left my Amex card at home (Lame business practice; considering our corporate cards are all Amex) and we took a cab on up the hill.  From the outside the place looks great, but it got creepy the moment we hit the door.  We walked in planning on having a drink or two then dinner, per the norm.  The instant we enter I see this larger fellow charging straight for us wiping his hands on some filthy rag hanging out of his pants, before we can breathe he puts his hand on my coworkers shoulder (the one that was just wiped on the disgusting rag) and shouts in what we both guess is a German accent \"Table for two?\" Normally I would be happy for prompt service however, we did not have a chance to look or breathe before he tried to usher us off, and he almost knocked the hostess down while interrupting her.  Very rude.  \n\nWe steer for the bar after putting our name in for dinner.  The bar has a great selection of elixirs and the drinks are a reasonable price.  After a libation we smile at the hostess and she carts us off to a table.  I sit down and Thomas decides to go wash his hands (still grossed out about the rag), it is during this time that our waiter swings by the table and informs me he is not serving an incomplete party, before I can say a word.  When he is done filling me in on the rules I reply: \"That's nice my guest is in the restroom I know what he would like to ..\" and he walks off in the middle of my sentence.  Did we offend the service gods?  I worked in a restaurant in college so I doubt it.  Thomas returns and so does our waiter, \"Hi my name is Erick, I will be taking care of you tonight.\"  I had told Thomas about the incomplete party bit and we both chuckled, Erick, your authority trip must be a great ride.  Our drinks show up and they are outstanding, we order the chicken and the steak for dinner.  \n\nI have lived in San Francisco since 2003 and I should tell you the city is known for great food and drink.  Palmers, your food is terrible for the level of restaurant you want to be.  If we were in some dive bar it would be fine, but when I want frozen food I will go to a dive bar.  The chicken was rubber dry and tasted like dirt, have your chef season his food.  The steak was a steak, tough and over cooked, I am guessing it was a lower quality beef then you have written on the menu.  The sides with the steak were offensive, both the fries and the greens must have come out of the frozen foods section at Safeway then microwaved to limp mediocrity.  Palmers perhaps use quality ingredients like the other taverns in town, something fresh perhaps.  When our waiter asked we mentioned that the chicken and the steak were tough and both overcooked, he informed us that the chef had studied in France and blah blah, not offering to correct the problem.  I stopped listening, and asked for the check.  I am guessing that Erick does not realize we can hear him when he is speaking next to the computer, because guess what, we did hear you.  Thanks for calling us assholes and mentioning that we know nothing about food.  I have not had an experience like this and I had to think on it for about a week or so before writing this review.  How are you employed is a puzzle I will never solve.\n\nOf course The Chronicles food critic reviews the place the Sunday after we go and his review was spot on, if not a little generous.  The one thing we saw he might be wrong about, my coworker has been living in Sweden and noticed that the name of the restaurant, font and logo are the EXACT same as a German Lingerie company.  It is one of the top searches when you look up PALMERS on FB.  So the little story I read about a family friends place in Canada has to be nonsense.  This place is either owned by a German company that produces (Very Hot) ladies underwear or the owner has zero creativity and just copied everything down to the color of the lettering.  It is somewhat sad.  To see for yourself:  http://www.palmers.at", "author": "Dr I."}

Spoiler alert: the food was not one of them.\n\nSERVICE: very attentive; the food came out quickly, and we also didn't wait long for our drinks.  Because it's a new restaurant, we were given a survey at the end to help them gauge how well they were doing so far.  I really appreciated the fact that they were open to taking feedback and making Palmer's a long-term success.\n\nDRINKS: The drink selection is great and not *too* outrageously priced.  I'd come back here for drinks if I want a bar option in Pac Heights that isn't Harry's. \n\nFOOD: This is where I don't have a lot of positive things to say, and I was really surprised at the quality of the food given that I've always had great meals at Leopold's (owners' other restaurant).  The food just seemed a notch below everything else at Palmer's; my green beans looked/tasted like they were of the frozen variety, my fries were salted beyond repair, and the steak, while cooked to the correct temperature, didn't seem to be a high-quality cut of meat.\n\nDECOR: I see other reviews think the antlers/animals on the walls are weird, but I think it gives off a cool, Italian-mob-in-a-bar kind of vibe.  I like it.\n\nOTHER PATRONS: meh.  Someone who knew the owner sat next to us and were disgusted to (over)hear that we didn't love our food when we filled out our post-meal survey.  They then proceeded to insult us for a good five minutes, calling us \"ignorant young people\".

The decor and atmosphere lived up to exactly what I had hoped for, but the drinks fell a little short. The cocktail list was reasonably priced by SF standards ($8.75 for all drinks on their menu), yet the list was a bit weak, lacking a good variety of drinks or anything very unique. I got the Pimm's cup which was fine, but just went for a gin and tonic after.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-04", "description": "The fifth star is for the best trout preparation ever (and I came from Trout Land before I came from the Cool Grey City of Love, and my trout-loving lover has even deeper exposure to the mountain-farmed fish), which is what got us into the restaurant in the first place.\n\nOur experience actually started in my old neighborhood, on Polk just north of Union, where I wanted to try the replacement for an Italian place that I had liked there.  Leopold's is Austrian, with an impressive beer list, and a group of noisy techies playing mating games at the window table.  My companion's eyes lit upon a trout wrapped in pancetta; it is rare that she passes a trout dish on a restaurant menu. I had  the pappardelle, and we shared a beet and endive salad.  Had I done my Yelp duty then, I would have given Leopold's 5 stars.  Alas, I no longer can.  \n\nSo a few weeks later we were back in the City, and I asked, back to Leopold's whose menu I want to explore further, or (since we were in a pet-friendly motel near the west end of Lombard) take the 22 up and check out the lower-Pacific-Heights restaurants?  Long pause.  The trout sounded good. But, being born to be wild, we went out in search of Adventure, and headed for the best bus line in San Francisco. \n\nThe last place we looked at had the appearance of a youth-oriented meat market, but we are rather pretty for old people and I lack the shame gene, so we dared to approach the entry-way menu.  The first thing my eye saw?  Pancetta-wrapped trout.  In we went.\n\nIt is indeed an attractive, well-designed restaurant with a classic dark-wood look appropriate for the concept.  The animal heads, well, read on.\n\nMy partner's choice being already made, I dug into the menu.  Hey, look, roast-beet salad, the last one we had at Leopold's was awesome.  Wait a minute...pappardelle, with parsnips?  I mean, it was really good at Leopold's, but this is supposed to be a New American place, the other restaurant with the same interesting menu has Austrian heraldry  all over the walls, along with a truly impressive collection of ungulate heads.\n\nSo yes, Palmers is owned by a man who came to San Francisco 20 years ago from Salzburg,  opened in a primo Russian Hill location a few years ago, and now has a hot spot on Fillmore.  Congratulations.\n\nI ended up with the lamb shank, which was just as good as everything else.  Then after Christmas we took my sisters and brother-in-law for a reunion dinner (all of us now from out of town), because my elder sister has as long and deep a love affair with the trout of our home mountains as does my companion.  So more samples were made of the trout (and I got my tastes in), and we got a wide exploration of appetizers (roast marrow!  Yum!) and main courses.  Every single dish was interesting and done well.  The food really is based on the somewhat rural tastes of  Mountain Austria.  I can only imagine what they would do with venison.  That means somewhat less gimcrackery around bizarre high-tech preparations of food ingredients.  At both Leopolds and Palmers, you can recognize what you are eating.  The kitchen celebrates the ingredients, which drives this reviewer to celebrate the kitchen.\n\nThis is one busy place, and new.  I see that Dr. I had a dinner from hell.  It may be that his server recognized a diner from hell.  I can say that the servers were very busy, but I thought handled the press (we were there at prime time on a Friday night) very well.  If Palmer's is not yet at the top of its game, (1) I did not see it, the place was ticking beautifully, and (2) it has only been open a few months, there may still be some glitches which will undoubtedly be identified and worked out.  If it continues on track it is a hit restaurant.  \n\nSo about the trout.\n\nIt is served apparently whole, wrapped in pancetta and pan-fried, with fixin's. Raised on trout that is pan-fried and served whole, with the diner carefully lifting the tail to leave one cooked filet behind then flipping the carcass and repeating (a process that removes most but never all of the skeleton), we approached the fish with care.  The pancette tied everything together:  our at-table filet technique would not work.  So we dove in with a sharp knife, and found:\n\nNo bones.  Flesh still moist, some of it due no doubt to the basting of the surrounding pancetta.  Still no bones.  That was at Leopold's.  What was it about the Palmer's prep that made it slightly better than what I had declared, 6 weeks earlier \"the best trout preparation ever\"? It is the reason I couldn't 5-star Leopold's.  I should have said \"best trout yet,\" then repeated that pronouncement  the next time we had the dish, and then again the time after that.\n\nThis is a not-uncommon preparation for trout in Salzburger Province,  enjoyed by a native of that beautiful mountainous region who has brought his skills, drive, and favorite dishes to a new home in California.  We are lucky to have him.", "author": "Marcus S."}

Bartenders were all vey friendly and efficient.\n\nDinner was excellent (heirloom tomato salad, shared aged beef, and coconut cake dessert) .  Portions are on the small side but I thought reasonably priced..... And nice not to get portions where I either have to leave half of it behind, or take it home and then never eat it.  The prime rib was exceptional and cooked perfectly.\n\nMy only complaint was the potato bread...... Undercooked and over priced.  If I hadn't ordered this starter I would have given them a 5 star rating!  \n\nAll in all, I am sorry this isn't my local restaurant.", "author": "Marion E."}

We started with the Shrimp appetizer, the shrimp were so large they were the size of lobsters. We then had the Trout wrapped in pancetta, which was to die for. I'm a huge fan of trout, and this was by far the best! Our waiter Eric was fantastic, our entire dinner went so smoothly even on a very busy night. After talking with him we learned that he used to wait tables at the Slanted Door, so I'm sure he's accustomed to high volume restaurants. The entire staff was just so wonderful, including the owner, Albert, who stopped by to greet us. We will certainly be going back!", "author": "Debi D."}

You enter to a great bar/restaurant with a flat screen over the bar showing sports highlights.  Then you look around and listen...it's a sandbox of lonely Pac-Heights \"girls\" that sit at the bar talking smack about their \"friends\" in shrill voices!  If they could hear themselves they would be embarrassed...or I would hope!  Such a sad experience for a great location.", "author": "Randy M."}

I heard they made some changes since its early weeks, so I thought I would give a neighborhood joint a second shot.  I was more than pleased with my visit.  My filet mignon and my wife's chicken w/ fries were delicious.  We finished up with the coconut cake, which was sublime.  The drinks were liberal in pour and judicious in price.  Nice to have a good go to place on Fillmore.", "author": "Niall V."}

I loved the attention to detail from the sconces,old photographs to the mounted animal heads and swordfish. The jazz was the perfect accompaniment to my classic cocktail. The owner was also very attentive - without me having to ask, he closed the front door to keep me from getting too chilly from the breeze. Cant comment on the food, since I didn't try but I hope they focus on adjusting that based on the reviews below. Super excited that I don't have to go to Harry's anymore!", "author": "Kristin G."}

Unfortunately, that describes Palmer's all too well. My friends and I have been waiting for months (literally) to try Palmer's.  We live very close and were excited for a new neighborhood watering hole.  Excitement has now turned to extreme disappointment. \n\nHere is my Palmer's story:\n\nThe first thing I notice is that we are the ONLY people under age 35 at this place.  So if you are looking to meet \"young\" individuals, this is not the right place. Upon walking in, I was forced to keep my sunglasses on due to sun rays blazing into the bar.  Apparently blinds were never discussed during the years of renovations.  \n\nThere was ONE table occupied and everyone else was standing in the bar area. After asking the hostess for a table, she rudely (this is a common theme) tells us that you must order food to sit down.  After little discussion, we decide to order an appetizer so that we can sit down at a table.  We inform the hostess that there will be four people total, although only 3 are present.  She, once again, rudely tells us that everyone must be present in order to be sat at a table--we quickly changed our magic number to three and figured our friend could squeeze in when she arrived.  I understand the not-seated-until-entire-party-is-here rule, but this is not Nick's Tacos on a Tuesday night--this is a brand new bar with one table occupied.  Give me a God-damn break!  On our way to the table in the back, I am beyond puzzled as to why this \"tavern\" is so un-accomodating  This hostess must have missed the training day about being polite to customers, in addition to lacking common manners.  \n\nThe menu was less-than impressive, but I was willing to try something in order to avoid getting sunburned inside. After sitting at the table for what seemed like 15 minutes without seeing a server, we decided to leave.  And never come back.", "author": "Susanne W."}

The atmosphere, service and cocktails are top notch. The only reason I am giving 4 and not 5 stars is the dinner portions seem small. I had the Squash Blossoms (delicious) but the portion seemed more like an appetizer, for a  $17 entree I would like to feel full. A friend had the Hen which was also delicious but the portions were again small for an entree. Can't wait to go back, I know I am going to be a regular i just hope they put a bit more on the plate.", "author": "Lauren M."}

I had the sage gnocchi with bolognese sauce and it is now one of my go-to favorites.

I would highly recommend the flatbread and spicy meatballs. Some of the best I've ever had in the city!", "author": "Grant K."}

Thought maybe he was having a bad night the first time and let it go (my friend from out of town could not believe how rude and dismissive he was to us both, didn't acknowledge us sitting at the bar for a good 10 minutes even though the place was empty).  I blow it off and go back and SAME THING.  What the hell!?  Be nice dude!!!!   Wake up and BE NICE!!!  This is a BAR and people want to feel welcome at the very least.  Ever seen \"Cheers\" and heard the term \"where everyone knows your name?\"  My god, once was bad but twice!?  Figure it out, you're in the service industry, if you don't like being nice to people ... Then get another job.  There are like NO good bars on Fillmore Street and this place should be a welcome change and exciting place for the neighborhood but I am astounded at my experiences here.  I was so excited when it opened since I live just a couple blocks away and the street really really needs a great bar.  But I will probably never go back again.

The d\u00e9cor is very 1940's with plush red leather booths, animal trophy heads on the walls and lovely vintage looking lighting fixtures... love it!  All the meals I've had are excellent and their curry fries are stellar. They serve them in a tall narrow glass wrapped in paper which keeps them hot for a very long time... how clever is that?

Only complaint was they couldn't find the peppermill to give us fresh ground pepper. Decided to try it tonite on a Sunday.  I sat down to get a drink while waiting on a friend. 5 minutes went by.  A girl and a guy bartender, no one made eye contact. Finally got a glass of wine. Then my friend came in, she sat there for at least 10 minutes, when she finally got the bartenders attention he bought her drink because she was obviously upset.  Just got worse. We had one appetizer and another drink. We sat there with empty glasses while no one made eye contact once again. We left and went down the street to the Elite where we got good service and food.  No more Palmer's for me. Sorry Long Bar went away.", "author": "Nel M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-10-19", "description": "We live in the neighborhood and have been anxious to try this spot, since it would be so convenient and also because we could use another great local place.  On the plus side, special cocktails were $8.75 which are a bargain. Also, our waiter was responsive especially when I didn't actually like the cocktail that I ordered.  When our filet arrived done versus medium rare, he also didn't skip a beat to return it.  Portion sizes were actually quite large as well - the flatbread could have worked for 3-4 people. Unfortunately, I would agree with a lot of the other comments - service is not pro-active. Water glasses continued to sit empty even when the tables next to us had their water refilled. Silverware would disappear and we would have to ask for more. The food was also not remarkable - the flatbread was the best part of the meal. The pappardelle with mushrooms was very gummy - which we felt must have meant that it was sitting for a while. The spinach side dish was very runny and had no flavor. The decor was very odd with the deer heads, and some decor reminiscent of the 30s or 40s but the menu didn't quite go and neither did some of the other decor on the walls. All in all, it felt very disjointed. We won't return as there are too many other great restaurants in the city - and even in the 'hood.", "author": "SY K."}

So I didn't have super high expectations as to the menu.  Being this was my first visit I was unaware that a megaphone was necessary to communicate with others in our party.  EXTREMELY LOUD!  Like 1st row at a rock concert loud.  Not sure why they don't opt for some sound boards strategically placed to cut down on the decimals.  It was a Friday night but really it was totally ridiculously loud. Our server was really nice but didn't mention the specials, I just happen to over hear her  yell to the table next to us they had specials.  I was bummed because the Burrata starter sounded so much better than the salad I ordered.  Our wedge salad arrived shortly and it was truly terrible. Soaked with vinegar dressing and little to no blue cheese which is just weird.  My husband thought it was ok but I couldn't eat it so I ordered the Burrata which was just ok. We had the hamburger which was nicely prepared and the fries were good, but they never did bring us ketchup which would have been nice.  At the end of the day the food was just ok at best.  I will say this we were surprised at how reasonable the price of the bill was.  One of our less expensive dinners in the city to date.  In my opinion if you serve food in this city you better get it right and it better be great. Too much competition. I can't see myself going back for anything else other than an early afternoon quick drink with friends then move on to any number or restaurants in the neighborhood that offer amazing cuisine and allow you to actually hear what others have to say in your party.", "author": "Lisa T."}

I tried it out with a group of five foodie friends and we all loved it.  The ambiance is romantic, old style SF -- makes a lady want to wear fishnets and a gardenia in her hair and snuggle with a beau in those red leather booths.   My perfect Manhattan was perfect and everyone else loved their house specialty cocktails  -- also high marks for the delicious dry Riesling.  Everything we ate was superb -- standouts were the just right meaty, meaty burger with divine housemade chips, squash blossoms and farro, kobe beef, roast chicken and we all loved the heirloom tomato salad.  Service was sassy and friendly -- just as it should be in a retro tavern.   Can't wait to go back!!!", "author": "Susie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-05", "description": "Palmer's has a bit of an identity crisis.  Is it an upscale bar with good food or is it an upscale restaurant with a bar area?  It seems they are trying to be the latter, which is a problem, because the food was average-to-bad at a premium price.  My burger was just ok; I expected a lot more for $13  Just down the street you could do a lot better at Harry's or Roam.  My friend got the wagyu beef, which he dared me to try, and it was so rubbery that I couldn't swallow it and had to spit it out.  The atmosphere however was great.  They retained the charm of Long Bar.  They took away a TV or two along with a communal bar stool table which was above the bar area, so it is no longer a good place to watch a sporting event.  I think everyone in Pac Heights was sad to see Long Bar go and are excited to see Palmer's do well.  I just don't see how it will with overpriced, unsatisfactory food in a city like SF, where everyone knows good food.  Honestly, to draw customers from Harry's or Elite Cafe (both a few blocks down on Fillmore), Palmer's is going to have to do a lot better.", "author": "Andrew E."}
