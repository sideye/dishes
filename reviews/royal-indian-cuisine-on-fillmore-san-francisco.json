There are some things which are standard and you need to stick to what they are when you are naming them.What you served was a Three course meal and not a Thali.\nAnd to the point where you said we questioned only when the bill came up,of course we were taken aback to see 85$ for 2 Thalis which would have normally costed us less than 50$.And in the beginning when we were given 4 samosas the server told us that 2 Thalis were a lot of food,then I immediately told we will cancel one and he said no you cannot as we already brought the samosas!(if he would have cancelled then, all this chaos wouldn't have happened)\nSo the whole situation arose because you used a Standard item Thali and made it into whatever you want.You are free to do it but it's your responsibility to explain it to your customers and not think that it's a headache to the servers.\nYou wasted our time,money and we left your restaurant completely disappointed with your hospitality.", "author": "Ramya R."}

Decided to get delivery through Eat24 on Saturday, September 22nd. I placed my lunch order at 2:45pm. It arrived at 3:45pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Samosa: Homemade crispy Indian pastry stuffed with spiced peas and potatoes, Served with homemade mint chutney, hot and sour and tamarind chutney, All batters are signature chickpea (garbanzo batter) prepared by our chef ($4.95)\n*Chicken Momo: Nepali delicacy cooked with ground chicken and Himalayan spices filled in cover with thin flour dough and steamed ($8.95)\n*Chicken Tikka Masala: Roasted chicken breast cooked in creamy tomato and onion sauce, Extra spicy ($12.95)\n*Garlic Naan: Naan layered with freshly minced garlic and chopped cilantro ($2.95)\n*Serrano Chili Naan: Naan brushed with blended green chili ($2.95)\n\nI adored the curry. It was creamy and comforting. Could have used a little more spice as I wanted it extra spicy, but it had a good amount of heat. The naan were both soft with a nice chew. Though, I do think they could have used more garlic and chili. The flavors weren't strong enough for me. The samosas were good. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Though their mint chutney was very bland and watery. Didn't really stick to the samosas. I love dumplings so the momos were tasty. The dipping sauce complemented them well.\n\nIndian is my comfort food and this hit the spot. Especially since I was feeling a little delicate that day.", "author": "Elena N."}

No, I was fully clothed and feeling quite serene in here, even though I recall taking advantage of their busy all-you-can-eat buffet more than a decade back, probably stuffing my gullet with chewy naan and saucy korma. Those gluttonous days are gone (fingers crossed), and I decided to keep it light, at least as light as my head was feeling. A complimentary flat of papadum arrived on my table with three flavorful dipping sauces (photo: http://bit.ly/2iL45vC).\n\nJust wished there was more papadum. From there, I started my true order with the $4.95 Cucumber Tomato Salad, a simple and small plate of freshness with tomato slices covered fort-like by cucumber slices lightly seasoned with chat masala and accompanied by a vinegary dipping sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2kl1Y1N). For my entree, I ordered an old veggie favorite, the $10.95 Baigan Bharta, clay oven-roasted eggplant cooked into a stew-like consistency with green peas & spices in an onion & tomato gravy (photo: http://bit.ly/2BwU6O9). Quite hearty and tasty with plenty of umami flavor and complemented nicely by the $2.95 dish of Basmati Rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2AoBGSr).

The downside is naan or rice are not included with the entrees, so you have to order them separately. I ordered a serrano chili naan, which I really loved and recommend.\n\nWe came during lunch time on a Sunday, and it was pretty busy. Turns out, this place is owned by the same people who run Om Indian Cuisine in Haight-Ashbury, and they just opened another restaurant as well. The ambience is alright, a little dark (I think Om does a better job here). Service was also a little slow.

I ordered food two nights in a row. The first day, the food was delivered on time at the room (motel) & the delivery man got his tip from us. \n\nThe second night, the delivery guy called up 5 minutes before reaching and asked me to collect the food from the street. It MAY be linked to me having paid the tip online.\n\nThen, on opening the food containers, we realized that the order was mixed up.  And basically, the chicken dish was missing. I tried calling twice but wasn't any use.\n\n\nSo, to summarize. Good food.\n\nBad delivery system. So you guys should either eat in, or find some place else to deliver.

The tomato sauce was clearly just added to the cooked lamb shank right before they served it. Basmati rice was also not cooked well. Chicken tandoori, we asked for dark meat only and our waiter confirmed the order but still we got breast pieces and thigh. They are audio loading like 1.5 pounds of onion on top of this tandoori to make it look like a large dish. You don't fool anyone.\nWaiter forgot to bring us Jeera rice. Then instead of bringing it, he said he will go check if we ordered it. \n\nWe last more that half of what we ordered on the table and asked for check. The waiter did not even ask why the lamb shank was untouched and most of the 3 orders of basmati rice was not eaten. \n\nTo those San Francisco folks who think this is awesome Indian food, you have not had good Indian food.

I've been there four times now (after their makeover and shift away from buffet style) and at least three of those times I've received either pushy or forgetful service, and had multiple interactions that made me just feel weird by how the staff acted.  And this does NOT happen most other places with me.  \n\nTonight my waiter was downright rude when he dropped the check by pushing it under my hand practically so I had to \"pay attention\" to it and him, and instead of being polite he stared at me and looked down at the check, like pay it now.  Then, as there were two other tables full of people in the restaurant, he came by again after about two minutes and asked if I was ready.  I was not.  Still munching on food. I can't remember exactly what he said but he bordered on aggressive in insisting I need to pay immediately.  Food in my mouth. Still sipping the (warm) water that was just poured in my glass.  I think he said \"you are ready\".  I replied I was not.  I've just eaten a full meal, not stopping chomping from the second they dropped the food.  And they want me to pay and leave.  With two other tables with multiple people still eating and laughing and chatting.  Not only that, when I arrived there were three empty tables.  One of those a two-top about 4 feet from the front door.  I was offered either the table by the door or a table that hadn't been cleared, but definitely NOT the other two clean, set, and empty tables.  I said I'd like the table away from the door that hadn't been cleared.  In case you missed it, there were two other clean tables empty, mind you.  So I proceeded to wait patiently for what seemed like 10 minutes while the bussman took his sweet time clearing and setting multiple tables.  Not just the table he was asked to set for me by the waiter.  Then as I'm waiting patiently (but starting to get frustrated at how distracted the bussman seems to be already) a group arrives and the bussman stops setting my table and starts getting water, menus, and whatever else for this new group, while a waiter stands there and chats.  The whole time there are three other waiters not taking orders but rather talking amongst themselves or to the new group that has arrived. Finally the man I presume was the bartender or something comes over and asks if I've been helped. I mention that I was waiting for said table but the bussman seemed to be distracted attending to other things.    The waiter came by and must have heard of my comment to bartender and mentioned that they were tired, \"twelve hour shift, you know\" and did apologize for the wait.  This did make me feel better.  But it makes me think, maybe you shouldn't all work twelve hour shifts!  I've been in fine dining service and I can't imagine ever being asked to work from noon to midnight, or whatever.\n\nTo continue in this forgetful/slow fashion, the papadam arrived ten minutes after I sat down and two minutes before my meal was served.  And I'm pretty sure the stack of three papadam was not for me but for the full table behind me, as I saw the same man walk back a minute later with a shorter stack of papadam for them. Not a big deal, but also not good service. \n\nThen after being served and eating non-stop I get the downright rude check drop and subsequent aggressive attitude with the check.\n\nJust left me feeling crappy leaving there, again.  And I walked in very relaxed and happy.  I thought I'd give them another chance.  But it seems they just don't get the fine(r) dining that the have shifted to, since their makeover (and new ownership?)\n\nYuk.", "author": "Bill s."}

The rice was good although I can't think of words to describe rice. I guess good is the best I can do.. The naan bread was different than any naan I have ever had. It was flat and sort of doughy. I thought it could have used some salt and overall was kind of tasteless although good when dipped in the sauce. \nAs I sat there and waited from my order, the staff was very welcoming and offer a cup of chai that was very tasty and not overly sweet. \nIf I am at a hotel near the Royal Indian I will definitely be back.

Royal Indian Cuisine's matar paneer was a huge disappointment. I usually get medium but decided to go for mild, but the dish that I was served had not the slightest hint of a kick. In fact, it tasted like they'd forgotten spices in general. There was such a lack of flavor that it mostly tasted like peas and the oil in the paneer cubes (they were fried, which is a bit unusual in my experience). The consistency was more like soup. I ended up taking it home and adding a lot of chana masala and a bit of hot ground red pepper to make it enjoyable. The other things we ordered were okay, but not amazing, so I really don't understand how this place currently has 4.5 stars.

Let me tell you, after crunching down on a couple of those you get very timid about your next bite! The dish had the appearance of having been thrown together from just rice and some precooked lamb pieces, not prepared together.\n\nI picked up some seasoned rice that was better. A small portion of cumin and turmeric seasoned basmati - not exactly the typical saffron rice one might be used to.\n\nI tried a couple of breads - paratha and a buttered naan that were nice.

The chicken tikka masala is extraordinary, filled with large chunks of white meat chicken garnished with a rich spicy sauce.  Kudos to the chicken curry as and lamb korma as well!

I'm pretty sad, that not only is that no longer available, but the prices have dramatically increased.  Now it's just like any other mainstream Indian Restaurant, and I'm not impressed.  The chickpea nan sounded awesome.  It was dry, and hard to eat, even after dipped in the curry.  Lamb Saag was just okay.  Lower Pac Heights prices, but average food.  I'll be pursuing new Indian locations, that have food that is worth the pricing.

With all the restaurants on Fillmore, I just never got around to trying it.  My loss.  Finally went for the first time today.  Charming decor and pleasant ambiance, very attractive table service.  My companion, a vegetarian, had quite a long selection of vegetarian dishes to choose from.  He ordered samosas and the vegetable momo, a Nepali dish very like light steamed dumplings.  He loved the spice combinations in both the samosa filling and the momo.  I ordered the vegetable soup and the Kashmiri chicken.  The soup was spicy and very tasty.  Since I hadn't been here before, I decided discretion was the better part of valor and ordered the spice level on the chicken \"mild.\"  It was a delicious  dish but even for my timid taste buds it could have been spicier.  Will definitely ordered \"medium\" spicy next time and there certainly will be a next time.  For me the servings were generous and I took about half the chicken dish home in a box.  One caveat, service was slow.  We were in no hurry and felt the dishes were prepared to order and not just dished up from a steam table.  Therefore, it was worth the wait.", "author": "Claire L."}

Saffron Grill has gone downhill these days, it used to be my go to place. So I was really hoping for a new place to pop up, but anytime you see a crazy number of 5-star reviews by a predominantly newbie crowd, you tend to be suspicious, as I was. But the chicken tikka masala was pretty decent, the bhindi masala good, and the saag paneer passed my wife's saag paneer test. Don't get me wrong, I am grading on a curve here..but expectations exceeded, so will order again. If the quality drops, I reserve the right to reconsider my generosity.", "author": "Gibu T."}
